She eventually decides that bringing a message of salvation to people who have plenty will be more fulfilling and genuine than converting the starving in return for bread.\nAlthough Barbara initially regards the Salvation Army's acceptance of Undershaft's money as hypocrisy, Shaw did not intend that it should be thought so by the audience. Shaw wrote a preface for the play's publication, in which he derided the idea that charities should only take money from \"morally pure\" sources. He points out that donations can always be used for good, whatever their provenance, and he quotes a Salvation Army officer, \"they would take money from the devil himself and be only too glad to get it out of his hands and into God's\".Lady Britomart Undershaft, the daughter of a British earl, and her son Stephen discuss a source of income for her grown daughters Sarah, who is engaged to Charles Lomax, and Barbara, who is engaged to Adolphus Cusins (a scholar of Greek literature). Lady Britomart leads Stephen to accept her decision that they must ask her estranged husband, Andrew Undershaft, for financial help. Mr. Undershaft is a successful and wealthy businessman who has made millions of pounds from his munitions factory, which manufactures the world famous Undershaft guns, cannons, torpedoes, submarines and aerial battleships.\nWhen their children were still small, the Undershafts separated; now grown, the children have not seen their father since, and Lady Britomart has raised them by herself. During their reunion, Undershaft learns that Barbara is a major in The Salvation Army who works at their shelter in West Ham, east London. Barbara and Mr. Undershaft agree that he will visit Barbara's Army shelter, if she will then visit his munitions factory.\nWhen he visits the shelter, Mr. Undershaft is impressed with Barbara's handling of the various people who seek social services from the Salvation Army: she treats them with patience, firmness, and sincerity. Undershaft and Cusins discuss the question of Barbara's commitment to The Salvation Army, and Undershaft decides he must overcome Barbara's moral horror of his occupation. He declares that he will therefore \"buy\" the Salvation Army. He makes a sizeable donation, matching another donation from a whisky distiller. Barbara wants the Salvation Army to refuse the money because it comes from the armaments and alcohol industries, but her supervising officer eagerly accepts it. Barbara sadly leaves the shelter in disillusionment.\nAccording to tradition, the heir to the Undershaft fortune must be an orphan who can be groomed to run the factory. Lady Britomart tries to convince Undershaft to bequeath the business to his son Stephen, but he will not. He says that the best way to keep the factory in the family is to find a foundling and marry him to Barbara. Later, Barbara and the rest of her family accompany her father to his munitions factory. They are all impressed by its size and organisation. Cusins declares that he is a foundling, and is thus eligible to inherit the business. Undershaft eventually overcomes Cusins' moral scruples about the nature of the business. Cusins' acceptance makes Barbara more content to marry him, not less, because bringing a message of salvation to the factory workers, rather than to London slum-dwellers, will bring her more fulfilment.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Major Barbara, by George Bernard Shaw\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

A large and\ncomfortable settee is in the middle of the room, upholstered in\ndark leather. A person sitting on it [it is vacant at present]\nwould have, on his right, Lady Britomart's writing table, with\nthe lady herself busy at it; a smaller writing table behind him\non his left; the door behind him on Lady Britomart's side; and a\nwindow with a window seat directly on his left. Near the window\nis an armchair.\n\nLady Britomart is a woman of fifty or thereabouts, well dressed\nand yet careless of her dress, well bred and quite reckless of\nher breeding, well mannered and yet appallingly outspoken and\nindifferent to the opinion of her interlocutory, amiable and yet\nperemptory, arbitrary, and high-tempered to the last bearable\ndegree, and withal a very typical managing matron of the upper\nclass, treated as a naughty child until she grew into a scolding\nmother, and finally settling down with plenty of practical\nability and worldly experience, limited in the oddest way with\ndomestic and class limitations, conceiving the universe exactly\nas if it were a large house in Wilton Crescent, though handling\nher corner of it very effectively on that assumption, and being\nquite enlightened and liberal as to the books in the library, the\npictures on the walls, the music in the portfolios, and the\narticles in the papers.\n\nHer son, Stephen, comes in. He is a gravely correct young man\nunder 25, taking himself very seriously, but still in some awe of\nhis mother, from childish habit and bachelor shyness rather than\nfrom any weakness of character.\n\nSTEPHEN. What's the matter?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Presently, Stephen.\n\nStephen submissively walks to the settee and sits down. He takes\nup The Speaker.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't begin to read, Stephen. I shall require all\nyour attention.\n\nSTEPHEN. It was only while I was waiting--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't make excuses, Stephen. [He puts down The\nSpeaker]. Now! [She finishes her writing; rises; and comes to the\nsettee]. I have not kept you waiting very long, I think.\n\nSTEPHEN. Not at all, mother.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Bring me my cushion. [He takes the cushion from\nthe chair at the desk and arranges it for her as she sits down on\nthe settee]. Sit down. [He sits down and fingers his tie\nnervously]. Don't fiddle with your tie, Stephen: there is nothing\nthe matter with it.\n\nSTEPHEN. I beg your pardon. [He fiddles with his watch chain\ninstead].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Now are you attending to me, Stephen?\n\nSTEPHEN. Of course, mother.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. No: it's not of course. I want something much\nmore than your everyday matter-of-course attention. I am going to\nspeak to you very seriously, Stephen. I wish you would let that\nchain alone.\n\nSTEPHEN [hastily relinquishing the chain] Have I done anything to\nannoy you, mother? If so, it was quite unintentional.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [astonished] Nonsense! [With some remorse] My poor\nboy, did you think I was angry with you?\n\nSTEPHEN. What is it, then, mother? You are making me very uneasy.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [squaring herself at him rather aggressively]\nStephen: may I ask how soon you intend to realize that you are a\ngrown-up man, and that I am only a woman?\n\nSTEPHEN [amazed] Only a--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't repeat my words, please: It is a most\naggravating habit. You must learn to face life seriously,\nStephen. I really cannot bear the whole burden of our family\naffairs any longer. You must advise me: you must assume the\nresponsibility.\n\nSTEPHEN. I!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes, you, of course. You were 24 last June.\nYou've been at Harrow and Cambridge. You've been to India and\nJapan. You must know a lot of things now; unless you have wasted\nyour time most scandalously. Well, advise me.\n\nSTEPHEN [much perplexed] You know I have never interfered in the\nhousehold--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. No: I should think not. I don't want you to order\nthe dinner.\n\nSTEPHEN. I mean in our family affairs.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Well, you must interfere now; for they are\ngetting quite beyond me.\n\nSTEPHEN [troubled] I have thought sometimes that perhaps I ought;\nbut really, mother, I know so little about them; and what I do\nknow is so painful--it is so impossible to mention some things to\nyou--[he stops, ashamed].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I suppose you mean your father.\n\nSTEPHEN [almost inaudibly] Yes.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. My dear: we can't go on all our lives not\nmentioning him. Of course you were quite right not to open the\nsubject until I asked you to; but you are old enough now to be\ntaken into my confidence, and to help me to deal with him about\nthe girls.\n\nSTEPHEN. But the girls are all right. They are engaged.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [complacently] Yes: I have made a very good match\nfor Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is\nten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under\nthe terms of his father's will allow him more than 800 pounds a\nyear.\n\nSTEPHEN. But the will says also that if he increases his income\nby his own exertions, they may double the increase.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Charles Lomax's exertions are much more likely to\ndecrease his income than to increase it. Sarah will have to find\nat least another 800 pounds a year for the next ten years; and\neven then they will be as poor as church mice. And what about\nBarbara? I thought Barbara was going to make the most brilliant\ncareer of all of you. And what does she do? Joins the Salvation\nArmy; discharges her maid; lives on a pound a week; and walks in\none evening with a professor of Greek whom she has picked up in\nthe street, and who pretends to be a Salvationist, and actually\nplays the big drum for her in public because he has fallen head\nover ears in love with her.\n\nSTEPHEN. I was certainly rather taken aback when I heard they\nwere engaged. Cusins is a very nice fellow, certainly: nobody\nwould ever guess that he was born in Australia; but--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Oh, Adolphus Cusins will make a very good\nhusband. After all, nobody can say a word against Greek: it\nstamps a man at once as an educated gentleman. And my family,\nthank Heaven, is not a pig-headed Tory one. We are Whigs, and\nbelieve in liberty. Let snobbish people say what they please:\nBarbara shall marry, not the man they like, but the man I like.\n\nSTEPHEN. Of course I was thinking only of his income. However, he\nis not likely to be extravagant.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't be too sure of that, Stephen. I know your\nquiet, simple, refined, poetic people like Adolphus--quite\ncontent with the best of everything! They cost more than your\nextravagant people, who are always as mean as they are second\nrate. No: Barbara will need at least 2000 pounds a year. You see\nit means two additional households. Besides, my dear, you must\nmarry soon. I don't approve of the present fashion of philandering\nbachelors and late marriages; and I am trying to arrange something\nfor you.\n\nSTEPHEN. It's very good of you, mother; but perhaps I had better\narrange that for myself.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Nonsense! you are much too young to begin\nmatchmaking: you would be taken in by some pretty little nobody.\nOf course I don't mean that you are not to be consulted: you know\nthat as well as I do. [Stephen closes his lips and is silent].\nNow don't sulk, Stephen.\n\nSTEPHEN. I am not sulking, mother. What has all this got to do\nwith--with--with my father?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. My dear Stephen: where is the money to come from?\nIt is easy enough for you and the other children to live on my\nincome as long as we are in the same house; but I can't keep four\nfamilies in four separate houses. You know how poor my father is:\nhe has barely seven thousand a year now; and really, if he were\nnot the Earl of Stevenage, he would have to give up society. He\ncan do nothing for us: he says, naturally enough, that it is\nabsurd that he should be asked to provide for the children of a\nman who is rolling in money. You see, Stephen, your father must\nbe fabulously wealthy, because there is always a war going on\nsomewhere.\n\nSTEPHEN. You need not remind me of that, mother. I have hardly\never opened a newspaper in my life without seeing our name in it.\nThe Undershaft torpedo! The Undershaft quick firers! The\nUndershaft ten inch! the Undershaft disappearing rampart gun! the\nUndershaft submarine! and now the Undershaft aerial battleship!\nAt Harrow they called me the Woolwich Infant. At Cambridge it was\nthe same. A little brute at King's who was always trying to get\nup revivals, spoilt my Bible--your first birthday present to\nme--by writing under my name, \"Son and heir to Undershaft and\nLazarus, Death and Destruction Dealers: address, Christendom and\nJudea.\" But that was not so bad as the way I was kowtowed to\neverywhere because my father was making millions by selling\ncannons.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It is not only the cannons, but the war loans\nthat Lazarus arranges under cover of giving credit for the\ncannons. You know, Stephen, it's perfectly scandalous. Those two\nmen, Andrew Undershaft and Lazarus, positively have Europe under\ntheir thumbs. That is why your father is able to behave as he\ndoes. He is above the law. Do you think Bismarck or Gladstone or\nDisraeli could have openly defied every social and moral\nobligation all their lives as your father has? They simply\nwouldn't have dared. I asked Gladstone to take it up. I asked The\nTimes to take it up. I asked the Lord Chamberlain to take it up.\nBut it was just like asking them to declare war on the Sultan.\nThey WOULDN'T. They said they couldn't touch him. I believe they\nwere afraid.\n\nSTEPHEN. What could they do? He does not actually break the law.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Not break the law! He is always breaking the law.\nHe broke the law when he was born: his parents were not married.\n\nSTEPHEN. Mother! Is that true?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Of course it's true: that was why we separated.\n\nSTEPHEN. He married without letting you know this!\n\nLADY BRITOMART [rather taken aback by this inference] Oh no. To\ndo Andrew justice, that was not the sort of thing he did.\nBesides, you know the Undershaft motto: Unashamed. Everybody\nknew.\n\nSTEPHEN. But you said that was why you separated.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes, because he was not content with being a\nfoundling himself: he wanted to disinherit you for another\nfoundling. That was what I couldn't stand.\n\nSTEPHEN [ashamed] Do you mean for--for--for--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't stammer, Stephen. Speak distinctly.\n\nSTEPHEN. But this is so frightful to me, mother. To have to speak\nto you about such things!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It's not pleasant for me, either, especially if\nyou are still so childish that you must make it worse by a\ndisplay of embarrassment. It is only in the middle classes,\nStephen, that people get into a state of dumb helpless horror\nwhen they find that there are wicked people in the world. In our\nclass, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people;\nand nothing should disturb our self possession. Now ask your\nquestion properly.\n\nSTEPHEN. Mother: you have no consideration for me. For Heaven's\nsake either treat me as a child, as you always do, and tell me\nnothing at all; or tell me everything and let me take it as best\nI can.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Treat you as a child! What do you mean? It is\nmost unkind and ungrateful of you to say such a thing. You know I\nhave never treated any of you as children. I have always made you\nmy companions and friends, and allowed you perfect freedom to do\nand say whatever you liked, so long as you liked what I could\napprove of.\n\nSTEPHEN [desperately] I daresay we have been the very imperfect\nchildren of a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me\nalone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my\nfather wanting to set me aside for another son.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [amazed] Another son! I never said anything of the\nkind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of\ninterrupting me.\n\nSTEPHEN. But you said--\n\nLADY BRITOMART [cutting him short] Now be a good boy, Stephen,\nand listen to me patiently. The Undershafts are descended from a\nfoundling in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft in the city.\nThat was long ago, in the reign of James the First. Well, this\nfoundling was adopted by an armorer and gun-maker. In the course\nof time the foundling succeeded to the business; and from some\nnotion of gratitude, or some vow or something, he adopted another\nfoundling, and left the business to him. And that foundling did\nthe same. Ever since that, the cannon business has always been\nleft to an adopted foundling named Andrew Undershaft.\n\nSTEPHEN. But did they never marry? Were there no legitimate sons?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Oh yes: they married just as your father did; and\nthey were rich enough to buy land for their own children and\nleave them well provided for. But they always adopted and trained\nsome foundling to succeed them in the business; and of course\nthey always quarrelled with their wives furiously over it. Your\nfather was adopted in that way; and he pretends to consider\nhimself bound to keep up the tradition and adopt somebody to\nleave the business to. Of course I was not going to stand that.\nThere may have been some reason for it when the Undershafts could\nonly marry women in their own class, whose sons were not fit to\ngovern great estates. But there could be no excuse for passing\nover my son.\n\nSTEPHEN [dubiously] I am afraid I should make a poor hand of\nmanaging a cannon foundry.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Nonsense! you could easily get a manager and pay\nhim a salary.\n\nSTEPHEN. My father evidently had no great opinion of my capacity.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Stuff, child! you were only a baby: it had\nnothing to do with your capacity. Andrew did it on principle,\njust as he did every perverse and wicked thing on principle. When\nmy father remonstrated, Andrew actually told him to his face that\nhistory tells us of only two successful institutions: one the\nUndershaft firm, and the other the Roman Empire under the\nAntonines. That was because the Antonine emperors all adopted\ntheir successors. Such rubbish! The Stevenages are as good as the\nAntonines, I hope; and you are a Stevenage. But that was Andrew\nall over. There you have the man! Always clever and unanswerable\nwhen he was defending nonsense and wickedness: always awkward and\nsullen when he had to behave sensibly and decently!\n\nSTEPHEN. Then it was on my account that your home life was broken\nup, mother. I am sorry.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Well, dear, there were other differences. I\nreally cannot bear an immoral man. I am not a Pharisee, I hope;\nand I should not have minded his merely doing wrong things: we\nare none of us perfect. But your father didn't exactly do wrong\nthings: he said them and thought them: that was what was so\ndreadful. He really had a sort of religion of wrongness just as\none doesn't mind men practising immorality so long as they own\nthat they are in the wrong by preaching morality; so I couldn't\nforgive Andrew for preaching immorality while he practised\nmorality. You would all have grown up without principles, without\nany knowledge of right and wrong, if he had been in the house.\nYou know, my dear, your father was a very attractive man in some\nways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it\nto put the wickedest ideas into their heads, and make them quite\nunmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but\nnothing can bridge over moral disagreement.\n\nSTEPHEN. All this simply bewilders me, mother. People may differ\nabout matters of opinion, or even about religion; but how can\nthey differ about right and wrong? Right is right; and wrong is\nwrong; and if a man cannot distinguish them properly, he is\neither a fool or a rascal: that's all.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [touched] That's my own boy [she pats his cheek]!\nYour father never could answer that: he used to laugh and get out\nof it under cover of some affectionate nonsense. And now that you\nunderstand the situation, what do you advise me to do?\n\nSTEPHEN. Well, what can you do?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I must get the money somehow.\n\nSTEPHEN. We cannot take money from him. I had rather go and live\nin some cheap place like Bedford Square or even Hampstead than\ntake a farthing of his money.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. But after all, Stephen, our present income comes\nfrom Andrew.\n\nSTEPHEN [shocked] I never knew that.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Well, you surely didn't suppose your grandfather\nhad anything to give me. The Stevenages could not do everything\nfor you. We gave you social position. Andrew had to contribute\nsomething. He had a very good bargain, I think.\n\nSTEPHEN [bitterly] We are utterly dependent on him and his\ncannons, then!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Certainly not: the money is settled. But he\nprovided it. So you see it is not a question of taking money from\nhim or not: it is simply a question of how much. I don't want any\nmore for myself.\n\nSTEPHEN. Nor do I.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. But Sarah does; and Barbara does. That is,\nCharles Lomax and Adolphus Cusins will cost them more. So I must\nput my pride in my pocket and ask for it, I suppose. That is your\nadvice, Stephen, is it not?\n\nSTEPHEN. No.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [sharply] Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN. Of course if you are determined--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I am not determined: I ask your advice; and I am\nwaiting for it. I will not have all the responsibility thrown on\nmy shoulders.\n\nSTEPHEN [obstinately] I would die sooner than ask him for another\npenny.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [resignedly] You mean that I must ask him. Very\nwell, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You will be glad to know\nthat your grandfather concurs. But he thinks I ought to ask\nAndrew to come here and see the girls. After all, he must have\nsome natural affection for them.\n\nSTEPHEN. Ask him here!!!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Do not repeat my words, Stephen. Where else can I\nask him?\n\nSTEPHEN. I never expected you to ask him at all.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Now don't tease, Stephen. Come! you see that it\nis necessary that he should pay us a visit, don't you?\n\nSTEPHEN [reluctantly] I suppose so, if the girls cannot do\nwithout his money.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Thank you, Stephen: I knew you would give me the\nright advice when it was properly explained to you. I have asked\nyour father to come this evening. [Stephen bounds from his seat]\nDon't jump, Stephen: it fidgets me.\n\nSTEPHEN [in utter consternation] Do you mean to say that my\nfather is coming here to-night--that he may be here at any\nmoment?\n\nLADY BRITOMART [looking at her watch] I said nine. [He gasps. She\nrises]. Ring the bell, please. [Stephen goes to the smaller\nwriting table; presses a button on it; and sits at it with his\nelbows on the table and his head in his hands, outwitted and\noverwhelmed]. It is ten minutes to nine yet; and I have to\nprepare the girls. I asked Charles Lomax and Adolphus to dinner\non purpose that they might be here. Andrew had better see them in\ncase he should cherish any delusions as to their being capable of\nsupporting their wives. [The butler enters: Lady Britomart goes\nbehind the settee to speak to him]. Morrison: go up to the\ndrawingroom and tell everybody to come down here at once.\n[Morrison withdraws. Lady Britomart turns to Stephen]. Now\nremember, Stephen, I shall need all your countenance and\nauthority. [He rises and tries to recover some vestige of these\nattributes]. Give me a chair, dear. [He pushes a chair forward\nfrom the wall to where she stands, near the smaller writing\ntable. She sits down; and he goes to the armchair, into which he\nthrows himself]. I don't know how Barbara will take it. Ever\nsince they made her a major in the Salvation Army she has\ndeveloped a propensity to have her own way and order people about\nwhich quite cows me sometimes. It's not ladylike: I'm sure I\ndon't know where she picked it up. Anyhow, Barbara shan't bully\nme; but still it's just as well that your father should be here\nbefore she has time to refuse to meet him or make a fuss. Don't\nlook nervous, Stephen, it will only encourage Barbara to make\ndifficulties. I am nervous enough, goodness knows; but I don't\nshow it.\n\nSarah and Barbara come in with their respective young men,\nCharles Lomax and Adolphus Cusins. Sarah is slender, bored, and\nmundane. Barbara is robuster, jollier, much more energetic. Sarah\nis fashionably dressed: Barbara is in Salvation Army uniform.\nLomax, a young man about town, is like many other young men about\ntown. He is affected with a frivolous sense of humor which\nplunges him at the most inopportune moments into paroxysms of\nimperfectly suppressed laughter. Cusins is a spectacled student,\nslight, thin haired, and sweet voiced, with a more complex form\nof Lomax's complaint. His sense of humor is intellectual and\nsubtle, and is complicated by an appalling temper. The lifelong\nstruggle of a benevolent temperament and a high conscience\nagainst impulses of inhuman ridicule and fierce impatience has\nset up a chronic strain which has visibly wrecked his constitution.\nHe is a most implacable, determined, tenacious, intolerant person\nwho by mere force of character presents himself as--and indeed\nactually is--considerate, gentle, explanatory, even mild and\napologetic, capable possibly of murder, but not of cruelty or\ncoarseness. By the operation of some instinct which is not merciful\nenough to blind him with the illusions of love, he is obstinately\nbent on marrying Barbara. Lomax likes Sarah and thinks it will be\nrather a lark to marry her. Consequently he has not attempted to\nresist Lady Britomart's arrangements to that end.\n\nAll four look as if they had been having a good deal of fun in\nthe drawingroom. The girls enter first, leaving the swains\noutside. Sarah comes to the settee. Barbara comes in after her\nand stops at the door.\n\nBARBARA. Are Cholly and Dolly to come in?\n\nLADY BRITOMART [forcibly] Barbara: I will not have Charles called\nCholly: the vulgarity of it positively makes me ill.\n\nBARBARA. It's all right, mother. Cholly is quite correct\nnowadays. Are they to come in?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes, if they will behave themselves.\n\nBARBARA [through the door] Come in, Dolly, and behave yourself.\n\nBarbara comes to her mother's writing table. Cusins enters\nsmiling, and wanders towards Lady Britomart.\n\nSARAH [calling] Come in, Cholly. [Lomax enters, controlling his\nfeatures very imperfectly, and places himself vaguely between\nSarah and Barbara].\n\nLADY BRITOMART [peremptorily] Sit down, all of you. [They sit.\nCusins crosses to the window and seats himself there. Lomax takes\na chair. Barbara sits at the writing table and Sarah on the\nsettee]. I don't in the least know what you are laughing at,\nAdolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better\nfrom Charles Lomax.\n\nCUSINS [in a remarkably gentle voice] Barbara has been trying to\nteach me the West Ham Salvation March.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I see nothing to laugh at in that; nor should you\nif you are really converted.\n\nCUSINS [sweetly] You were not present. It was really funny, I\nbelieve.\n\nLOMAX. Ripping.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now listen to me, children.\nYour father is coming here this evening. [General stupefaction].\n\nLOMAX [remonstrating] Oh I say!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You are not called on to say anything, Charles.\n\nSARAH. Are you serious, mother?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Of course I am serious. It is on your account,\nSarah, and also on Charles's. [Silence. Charles looks painfully\nunworthy]. I hope you are not going to object, Barbara.\n\nBARBARA. I! why should I? My father has a soul to be saved like\nanybody else. He's quite welcome as far as I am concerned.\n\nLOMAX [still remonstrant] But really, don't you know! Oh I say!\n\nLADY BRITOMART [frigidly] What do you wish to convey, Charles?\n\nLOMAX. Well, you must admit that this is a bit thick.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [turning with ominous suavity to Cusins] Adolphus:\nyou are a professor of Greek. Can you translate Charles Lomax's\nremarks into reputable English for us?\n\nCUSINS [cautiously] If I may say so, Lady Brit, I think Charles\nhas rather happily expressed what we all feel. Homer, speaking of\nAutolycus, uses the same phrase.\n\nLOMAX [handsomely] Not that I mind, you know, if Sarah don't.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [crushingly] Thank you. Have I your permission,\nAdolphus, to invite my own husband to my own house?\n\nCUSINS [gallantly] You have my unhesitating support in everything\nyou do.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Sarah: have you nothing to say?\n\nSARAH. Do you mean that he is coming regularly to live here?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Certainly not. The spare room is ready for him if\nhe likes to stay for a day or two and see a little more of you;\nbut there are limits.\n\nSARAH. Well, he can't eat us, I suppose. I don't mind.\n\nLOMAX [chuckling] I wonder how the old man will take it.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Much as the old woman will, no doubt, Charles.\n\nLOMAX [abashed] I didn't mean--at least--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You didn't think, Charles. You never do; and the\nresult is, you never mean anything. And now please attend to me,\nchildren. Your father will be quite a stranger to us.\n\nLOMAX. I suppose he hasn't seen Sarah since she was a little kid.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Not since she was a little kid, Charles, as you\nexpress it with that elegance of diction and refinement of\nthought that seem never to desert you. Accordingly--er-- [impatiently]\nNow I have forgotten what I was going to say. That comes of your\nprovoking me to be sarcastic, Charles. Adolphus: will you kindly\ntell me where I was.\n\nCUSINS [sweetly] You were saying that as Mr Undershaft has not\nseen his children since they were babies, he will form his\nopinion of the way you have brought them up from their behavior\nto-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly\ncareful to conduct ourselves well, especially Charles.\n\nLOMAX. Look here: Lady Brit didn't say that.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [vehemently] I did, Charles. Adolphus's\nrecollection is perfectly correct. It is most important that you\nshould be good; and I do beg you for once not to pair off into\nopposite corners and giggle and whisper while I am speaking to\nyour father.\n\nBARBARA. All right, mother. We'll do you credit.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Remember, Charles, that Sarah will want to feel\nproud of you instead of ashamed of you.\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say! There's nothing to be exactly proud of, don't\nyou know.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Well, try and look as if there was.\n\nMorrison, pale and dismayed, breaks into the room in unconcealed\ndisorder.\n\nMORRISON. Might I speak a word to you, my lady?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Nonsense! Show him up.\n\nMORRISON. Yes, my lady. [He goes].\n\nLOMAX. Does Morrison know who he is?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Of course. Morrison has always been with us.\n\nLOMAX. It must be a regular corker for him, don't you know.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Is this a moment to get on my nerves, Charles,\nwith your outrageous expressions?\n\nLOMAX. But this is something out of the ordinary, really--\n\nMORRISON [at the door] The--er--Mr Undershaft. [He retreats in\nconfusion].\n\nAndrew Undershaft comes in. All rise. Lady Britomart meets him in\nthe middle of the room behind the settee.\n\nAndrew is, on the surface, a stoutish, easygoing elderly man,\nwith kindly patient manners, and an engaging simplicity of\ncharacter. But he has a watchful, deliberate, waiting, listening\nface, and formidable reserves of power, both bodily and mental,\nin his capacious chest and long head. His gentleness is partly\nthat of a strong man who has learnt by experience that his\nnatural grip hurts ordinary people unless he handles them very\ncarefully, and partly the mellowness of age and success. He is\nalso a little shy in his present very delicate situation.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Good evening, Andrew.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. How d'ye do, my dear.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You look a good deal older.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [apologetically] I AM somewhat older. [With a touch of\ncourtship] Time has stood still with you.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [promptly] Rubbish! This is your family.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [surprised] Is it so large? I am sorry to say my\nmemory is failing very badly in some things. [He offers his hand\nwith paternal kindness to Lomax].\n\nLOMAX [jerkily shaking his hand] Ahdedoo.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I can see you are my eldest. I am very glad to meet\nyou again, my boy.\n\nLOMAX [remonstrating] No but look here don't you know--[Overcome]\nOh I say!\n\nLADY BRITOMART [recovering from momentary speechlessness] Andrew:\ndo you mean to say that you don't remember how many children you\nhave?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well, I am afraid I--. They have grown so much--er.\nAm I making any ridiculous mistake? I may as well confess: I\nrecollect only one son. But so many things have happened since,\nof course--er--\n\nLADY BRITOMART [decisively] Andrew: you are talking nonsense. Of\ncourse you have only one son.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Perhaps you will be good enough to introduce me, my\ndear.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. That is Charles Lomax, who is engaged to Sarah.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My dear sir, I beg your pardon.\n\nLOMAX. Not at all. Delighted, I assure you.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. This is Stephen.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [bowing] Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr Stephen.\nThen [going to Cusins] you must be my son. [Taking Cusins' hands\nin his] How are you, my young friend? [To Lady Britomart] He is\nvery like you, my love.\n\nCUSINS. You flatter me, Mr Undershaft. My name is Cusins: engaged\nto Barbara. [Very explicitly] That is Major Barbara Undershaft,\nof the Salvation Army. That is Sarah, your second daughter. This\nis Stephen Undershaft, your son.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My dear Stephen, I beg your pardon.\n\nSTEPHEN. Not at all.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Mr Cusins: I am much indebted to you for explaining\nso precisely. [Turning to Sarah] Barbara, my dear--\n\nSARAH [prompting him] Sarah.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Sarah, of course. [They shake hands. He goes over to\nBarbara] Barbara--I am right this time, I hope.\n\nBARBARA. Quite right. [They shake hands].\n\nLADY BRITOMART [resuming command] Sit down, all of you. Sit down,\nAndrew. [She comes forward and sits on the settle. Cusins also\nbrings his chair forward on her left. Barbara and Stephen resume\ntheir seats. Lomax gives his chair to Sarah and goes for\nanother].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Thank you, my love.\n\nLOMAX [conversationally, as he brings a chair forward between the\nwriting table and the settee, and offers it to Undershaft] Takes\nyou some time to find out exactly where you are, don't it?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [accepting the chair] That is not what embarrasses me,\nMr Lomax. My difficulty is that if I play the part of a father, I\nshall produce the effect of an intrusive stranger; and if I play\nthe part of a discreet stranger, I may appear a callous father.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. There is no need for you to play any part at all,\nAndrew. You had much better be sincere and natural.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [submissively] Yes, my dear: I daresay that will be\nbest. [Making himself comfortable] Well, here I am. Now what can\nI do for you all?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You need not do anything, Andrew. You are one of\nthe family. You can sit with us and enjoy yourself.\n\nLomax's too long suppressed mirth explodes in agonized neighings.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [outraged] Charles Lomax: if you can behave\nyourself, behave yourself. If not, leave the room.\n\nLOMAX. I'm awfully sorry, Lady Brit; but really, you know, upon\nmy soul! [He sits on the settee between Lady Britomart and\nUndershaft, quite overcome].\n\nBARBARA. Why don't you laugh if you want to, Cholly? It's good\nfor your inside.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Barbara: you have had the education of a lady.\nPlease let your father see that; and don't talk like a street\ngirl.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Never mind me, my dear. As you know, I am not a\ngentleman; and I was never educated.\n\nLOMAX [encouragingly] Nobody'd know it, I assure you. You look\nall right, you know.\n\nCUSINS. Let me advise you to study Greek, Mr Undershaft. Greek\nscholars are privileged men. Few of them know Greek; and none of\nthem know anything else; but their position is unchallengeable.\nOther languages are the qualifications of waiters and commercial\ntravellers: Greek is to a man of position what the hallmark is to\nsilver.\n\nBARBARA. Dolly: don't be insincere. Cholly: fetch your concertina\nand play something for us.\n\nLOMAX [doubtfully to Undershaft] Perhaps that sort of thing isn't\nin your line, eh?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I am particularly fond of music.\n\nLOMAX [delighted] Are you? Then I'll get it. [He   goes upstairs\nfor the instrument].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Do you play, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA. Only the tambourine. But Cholly's teaching me the\nconcertina.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Is Cholly also a member of the Salvation Army?\n\nBARBARA. No: he says it's bad form to be a dissenter. But I don't\ndespair of Cholly. I made him come yesterday to a meeting at the\ndock gates, and take the collection in his hat.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It is not my doing, Andrew. Barbara is old enough\nto take her own way. She has no father to advise her.\n\nBARBARA. Oh yes she has. There are no orphans in the Salvation\nArmy.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Your father there has a great many children and\nplenty of experience, eh?\n\nBARBARA [looking at him with quick interest and nodding] Just so.\nHow did you come to understand that? [Lomax is heard at the door\ntrying the concertina].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Come in, Charles. Play us something at once.\n\nLOMAX. Righto! [He sits down in his former place, and preludes].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. One moment, Mr Lomax. I am rather interested in the\nSalvation Army. Its motto might be my own: Blood and Fire.\n\nLOMAX [shocked] But not your sort of blood and fire, you know.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My sort of blood cleanses: my sort of fire purifies.\n\nBARBARA. So do ours. Come down to-morrow to my shelter--the West\nHam shelter--and see what we're doing. We're going to march to a\ngreat meeting in the Assembly Hall at Mile End. Come and see the\nshelter and then march with us: it will do you a lot of good. Can\nyou play anything?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. In my youth I earned pennies, and even shillings\noccasionally, in the streets and in public house parlors by my\nnatural talent for stepdancing. Later on, I became a member of\nthe Undershaft orchestral society, and performed passably on the\ntenor trombone.\n\nLOMAX [scandalized] Oh I say!\n\nBARBARA. Many a sinner has played himself into heaven on the\ntrombone, thanks to the Army.\n\nLOMAX [to Barbara, still rather shocked] Yes; but what about the\ncannon business, don't you know? [To Undershaft] Getting into\nheaven is not exactly in your line, is it?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Charles!!!\n\nLOMAX. Well; but it stands to reason, don't it? The cannon\nbusiness may be necessary and all that: we can't get on without\ncannons; but it isn't right, you know. On the other hand, there\nmay be a certain amount of tosh about the Salvation Army--I\nbelong to the Established Church myself--but still you can't deny\nthat it's religion; and you can't go against religion, can you?\nAt least unless you're downright immoral, don't you know.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You hardly appreciate my position, Mr Lomax--\n\nLOMAX [hastily] I'm not saying anything against you personally,\nyou know.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Quite so, quite so. But consider for a moment. Here I\nam, a manufacturer of mutilation and murder. I find myself in a\nspecially amiable humor just now because, this morning, down at\nthe foundry, we blew twenty-seven dummy soldiers into fragments\nwith a gun which formerly destroyed only thirteen.\n\nLOMAX [leniently] Well, the more destructive war becomes, the\nsooner it will be abolished, eh?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Not at all. The more destructive war becomes the more\nfascinating we find it. No, Mr Lomax, I am obliged to you for\nmaking the usual excuse for my trade; but I am not ashamed of it.\nI am not one of those men who keep their morals and their\nbusiness in watertight compartments. All the spare money my trade\nrivals spend on hospitals, cathedrals and other receptacles for\nconscience money, I devote to experiments and researches in\nimproved methods of destroying life and property. I have always\ndone so; and I always shall. Therefore your Christmas card\nmoralities of peace on earth and goodwill among men are of no use\nto me. Your Christianity, which enjoins you to resist not evil,\nand to turn the other cheek, would make me a bankrupt. My\nmorality--my religion--must have a place for cannons and\ntorpedoes in it.\n\nSTEPHEN [coldly--almost sullenly] You speak as if there were half\na dozen moralities and religions to choose from, instead of one\ntrue morality and one true religion.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. For me there is only one true morality; but it might\nnot fit you, as you do not manufacture aerial battleships. There\nis only one true morality for every man; but every man has not\nthe same true morality.\n\nLOMAX [overtaxed] Would you mind saying that again? I didn't\nquite follow it.\n\nCUSINS. It's quite simple. As Euripides says, one man's meat is\nanother man's poison morally as well as physically.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Precisely.\n\nLOMAX. Oh, that. Yes, yes, yes. True. True.\n\nSTEPHEN. In other words, some men are honest and some are\nscoundrels.\n\nBARBARA. Bosh. There are no scoundrels.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Indeed? Are there any good men?\n\nBARBARA. No. Not one. There are neither good men nor scoundrels:\nthere are just children of one Father; and the sooner they stop\ncalling one another names the better. You needn't talk to me: I\nknow them. I've had scores of them through my hands: scoundrels,\ncriminals, infidels, philanthropists, missionaries, county\ncouncillors, all sorts. They're all just the same sort of sinner;\nand there's the same salvation ready for them all.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. May I ask have you ever saved a maker of cannons?\n\nBARBARA. No. Will you let me try?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well, I will make a bargain with you. If I go to see\nyou to-morrow in your Salvation Shelter, will you come the day\nafter to see me in my cannon works?\n\nBARBARA. Take care. It may end in your giving up the cannons for\nthe sake of the Salvation Army.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Are you sure it will not end in your giving up the\nSalvation Army for the sake of the cannons?\n\nBARBARA. I will take my chance of that.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. And I will take my chance of the other. [They shake\nhands on it]. Where is your shelter?\n\nBARBARA. In West Ham. At the sign of the cross. Ask anybody in\nCanning Town. Where are your works?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. In Perivale St Andrews. At the sign of the sword. Ask\nanybody in Europe.\n\nLOMAX. Hadn't I better play something?\n\nBARBARA. Yes. Give us Onward, Christian Soldiers.\n\nLOMAX. Well, that's rather a strong order to begin with, don't\nyou know. Suppose I sing Thou'rt passing hence, my brother. It's\nmuch the same tune.\n\nBARBARA. It's too melancholy. You get saved, Cholly; and you'll\npass hence, my brother, without making such a fuss about it.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Really, Barbara, you go on as if religion were a\npleasant subject. Do have some sense of propriety.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I do not find it an unpleasant subject, my dear. It\nis the only one that capable people really care for.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [looking at her watch] Well, if you are determined\nto have it, I insist on having it in a proper and respectable\nway. Charles: ring for prayers. [General amazement. Stephen rises\nin dismay].\n\nLOMAX [rising] Oh I say!\n\nUNDERSHAFT [rising] I am afraid I must be going.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You cannot go now, Andrew: it would be most\nimproper. Sit down. What will the servants think?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My dear: I have conscientious scruples. May I suggest\na compromise? If Barbara will conduct a little service in the\ndrawingroom, with Mr Lomax as organist, I will attend it\nwillingly. I will even take part, if a trombone can be procured.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't mock, Andrew.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [shocked--to Barbara] You don't think I am mocking, my\nlove, I hope.\n\nBARBARA. No, of course not; and it wouldn't matter if you were:\nhalf the Army came to their first meeting for a lark. [Rising]\nCome along. Come, Dolly. Come, Cholly. [She goes out with\nUndershaft, who opens the door for her. Cusins rises].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I will not be disobeyed by everybody. Adolphus:\nsit down. Charles: you may go. You are not fit for prayers: you\ncannot keep your countenance.\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say! [He goes out].\n\nLADY BRITOMART [continuing] But you, Adolphus, can behave\nyourself if you choose to. I insist on your staying.\n\nCUSINS. My dear Lady Brit: there are things in the family prayer\nbook that I couldn't bear to hear you say.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. What things, pray?\n\nCUSINS. Well, you would have to say before all the servants that\nwe have done things we ought not to have done, and left undone\nthings we ought to have done, and that there is no health in us.\nI cannot bear to hear you doing yourself such an unjustice, and\nBarbara such an injustice. As for myself, I flatly deny it: I\nhave done my best. I shouldn't dare to marry Barbara--I couldn't\nlook you in the face--if it were true. So I must go to the\ndrawingroom.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [offended] Well, go. [He starts for the door]. And\nremember this, Adolphus [he turns to listen]: I have a very\nstrong suspicion that you went to the Salvation Army to worship\nBarbara and nothing else. And I quite appreciate the very clever\nway in which you systematically humbug me. I have found you out.\nTake care Barbara doesn't. That's all.\n\nCUSINS [with unruffled sweetness] Don't tell on me. [He goes\nout].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Sarah: if you want to go, go. Anything's better\nthan to sit there as if you wished you were a thousand miles\naway.\n\nSARAH [languidly] Very well, mamma. [She goes].\n\nLady Britomart, with a sudden flounce, gives way to a little gust\nof tears.\n\nSTEPHEN [going to her] Mother: what's the matter?\n\nLADY BRITOMART [swishing away her tears with her handkerchief]\nNothing. Foolishness. You can go with him, too, if you like, and\nleave me with the servants.\n\nSTEPHEN. Oh, you mustn't think that, mother. I--I don't like him.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. The others do. That is the injustice of a woman's\nlot. A woman has to bring up her children; and that means to\nrestrain them, to deny them things they want, to set them tasks,\nto punish them when they do wrong, to do all the unpleasant\nthings. And then the father, who has nothing to do but pet them\nand spoil them, comes in when all her work is done and steals\ntheir affection from her.\n\nSTEPHEN. He has not stolen our affection from you. It is only\ncuriosity.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [violently] I won't be consoled, Stephen. There is\nnothing the matter with me. [She rises and goes towards the\ndoor].\n\nSTEPHEN. Where are you going, mother?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. To the drawingroom, of course. [She goes out.\nOnward, Christian Soldiers, on the concertina, with tambourine\naccompaniment, is heard when the door opens]. Are you coming,\nStephen?\n\nSTEPHEN. No. Certainly not. [She goes. He sits down on the\nsettee, with compressed lips and an expression of strong\ndislike].\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nThe yard of the West Ham shelter of the Salvation Army is a cold\nplace on a January morning. The building itself, an old\nwarehouse, is newly whitewashed. Its gabled end projects into the\nyard in the middle, with a door on the ground floor, and another\nin the loft above it without any balcony or ladder, but with a\npulley rigged over it for hoisting sacks. Those who come from\nthis central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to\nthe street on their left, with a stone horse-trough just beyond\nit, and, on the right, a penthouse shielding a table from the\nweather. There are forms at the table; and on them are seated a\nman and a woman, both much down on their luck, finishing a meal\nof bread [one thick slice each, with margarine and golden syrup]\nand diluted milk.\n\nThe man, a workman out of employment, is young, agile, a talker,\na poser, sharp enough to be capable of anything in reason except\nhonesty or altruistic considerations of any kind. The woman is a\ncommonplace old bundle of poverty and hard-worn humanity. She\nlooks sixty and probably is forty-five. If they were rich people,\ngloved and muffed and well wrapped up in furs and overcoats, they\nwould be numbed and miserable; for it is a grindingly cold, raw,\nJanuary day; and a glance at the background of grimy warehouses\nand leaden sky visible over the whitewashed walls of the yard\nwould drive any idle rich person straight to the Mediterranean.\nBut these two, being no more troubled with visions of the\nMediterranean than of the moon, and  being compelled to keep more\nof their clothes in the pawnshop, and less on their persons, in\nwinter than in summer, are not depressed by the cold: rather are\nthey stung into vivacity, to which their meal has just now given\nan almost jolly turn. The man takes a pull at his mug, and then\ngets up and moves about the yard with his hands deep in his\npockets, occasionally breaking into a stepdance.\n\nTHE WOMAN. Feel better otter your meal, sir?\n\nTHE MAN. No. Call that a meal! Good enough for you, props; but\nwot is it to me, an intelligent workin man.\n\nTHE WOMAN. Workin man! Wot are you?\n\nTHE MAN. Painter.\n\nTHE WOMAN [sceptically] Yus, I dessay.\n\nTHE MAN. Yus, you dessay! I know. Every loafer that can't do\nnothink calls isself a painter. Well, I'm a real painter:\ngrainer, finisher, thirty-eight bob a week when I can get it.\n\nTHE WOMAN. Then why don't you go and get it?\n\nTHE MAN. I'll tell you why. Fust: I'm intelligent--fffff! it's\nrotten cold here [he dances a step or two]--yes: intelligent\nbeyond the station o life into which it has pleased the\ncapitalists to call me; and they don't like a man that sees\nthrough em. Second, an intelligent bein needs a doo share of\nappiness; so I drink somethink cruel when I get the chawnce.\nThird, I stand by my class and do as little as I can so's to\nleave arf the job for me fellow workers. Fourth, I'm fly enough\nto know wots inside the law and wots outside it; and inside it I\ndo as the capitalists do: pinch wot I can lay me ands on. In a\nproper state of society I am sober, industrious and honest: in\nRome, so to speak, I do as the Romans do. Wots the consequence?\nWhen trade is bad--and it's rotten bad just now--and the\nemployers az to sack arf their men, they generally start on me.\n\nTHE WOMAN. What's your name?\n\nTHE MAN. Price. Bronterre O'Brien Price. Usually called Snobby\nPrice, for short.\n\nTHE WOMAN. Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it? You said you was a\npainter.\n\nPRICE. Not that kind of snob, but the genteel sort. I'm too\nuppish, owing to my intelligence, and my father being a Chartist\nand a reading, thinking man: a stationer, too. I'm none of your\ncommon hewers of wood and drawers of water; and don't you forget\nit. [He returns to his seat at the table, and takes up his mug].\nWots YOUR name?\n\nTHE WOMAN. Rummy Mitchens, sir.\n\nPRICE [quaffing the remains of his milk to her] Your elth, Miss\nMitchens.\n\nRUMMY [correcting him] Missis Mitchens.\n\nPRICE. Wot! Oh Rummy, Rummy! Respectable married woman, Rummy,\ngittin rescued by the Salvation Army by pretendin to be a bad un.\nSame old game!\n\nRUMMY. What am I to do? I can't starve. Them Salvation lasses is\ndear good girls; but the better you are, the worse they likes to\nthink you were before they rescued you. Why shouldn't they av a\nbit o credit, poor loves? They're worn to rags by their work. And\nwhere would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on\nwe're no worse than other people? You know what ladies and\ngentlemen are.\n\nPRICE. Thievin swine! Wish I ad their job, Rummy, all the same.\nWot does Rummy stand for? Pet name props?\n\nRUMMY. Short for Romola.\n\nPRICE. For wot!?\n\nRUMMY. Romola. It was out of a new book. Somebody me mother\nwanted me to grow up like.\n\nPRICE. We're companions in misfortune, Rummy. Both on us got\nnames that nobody cawnt pronounce. Consequently I'm Snobby and\nyou're Rummy because Bill and Sally wasn't good enough for our\nparents. Such is life!\n\nRUMMY. Who saved you, Mr. Price? Was it Major Barbara?\n\nPRICE. No: I come here on my own. I'm goin to be Bronterre\nO'Brien Price, the converted painter. I know wot they like. I'll\ntell em how I blasphemed and gambled and wopped my poor old\nmother--\n\nRUMMY [shocked] Used you to beat your mother?\n\nPRICE. Not likely. She used to beat me. No matter: you come and\nlisten to the converted painter, and you'll hear how she was a\npious woman that taught me me prayers at er knee, an how I used\nto come home drunk and drag her out o bed be er snow white airs,\nan lam into er with the poker.\n\nRUMMY. That's what's so unfair to us women. Your confessions is\njust as big lies as ours: you don't tell what you really done no\nmore than us; but you men can tell your lies right out at the\nmeetins and be made much of for it; while the sort o confessions\nwe az to make az to be wispered to one lady at a time. It ain't\nright, spite of all their piety.\n\nPRICE. Right! Do you spose the Army'd be allowed if it went and\ndid right? Not much. It combs our air and makes us good little\nblokes to be robbed and put upon. But I'll play the game as good\nas any of em. I'll see somebody struck by lightnin, or hear a\nvoice sayin \"Snobby Price: where will you spend eternity?\" I'll\nave a time of it, I tell you.\n\nRUMMY. You won't be let drink, though.\n\nPRICE. I'll take it out in gorspellin, then. I don't want to\ndrink if I can get fun enough any other way.\n\nJenny Hill, a pale, overwrought, pretty Salvation lass of 18,\ncomes in through the yard gate, leading Peter Shirley, a half\nhardened, half worn-out elderly man, weak with hunger.\n\nJENNY [supporting him] Come! pluck up. I'll get you something to\neat. You'll be all right then.\n\nPRICE [rising and hurrying officiously to take the old man off\nJenny's hands] Poor old man! Cheer up, brother: you'll find rest\nand peace and appiness ere. Hurry up with the food, miss: e's\nfair done. [Jenny hurries into the shelter]. Ere, buck up, daddy!\nShe's fetchin y'a thick slice o breadn treacle, an a mug o\nskyblue. [He seats him at the corner of the table].\n\nRUMMY [gaily] Keep up your old art! Never say die!\n\nSHIRLEY. I'm not an old man. I'm ony 46. I'm as good as ever I\nwas. The grey patch come in my hair before I was thirty. All it\nwants is three pennorth o hair dye: am I to be turned on the\nstreets to starve for it? Holy God! I've worked ten to twelve\nhours a day since I was thirteen, and paid my way all through;\nand now am I to be thrown into the gutter and my job given to a\nyoung man that can do it no better than me because I've black\nhair that goes white at the first change?\n\nPRICE [cheerfully] No good jawrin about it. You're ony a\njumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turned-out incurable of an ole\nworkin man: who cares about you? Eh? Make the thievin swine give\nyou a meal: they've stole many a one from you. Get a bit o your\nown back. [Jenny returns with the usual meal]. There you are,\nbrother. Awsk a blessin an tuck that into you.\n\nSHIRLEY [looking at it ravenously but not touching it, and crying\nlike a child] I never took anything before.\n\nJENNY [petting him] Come, come! the Lord sends it to you: he\nwasn't above taking bread from his friends; and why should you\nbe? Besides, when we find you a job you can pay us for it if you\nlike.\n\nSHIRLEY [eagerly] Yes, yes: that's true. I can pay you back: it's\nonly a loan. [Shivering] Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He turns to the table\nand attacks the meal ravenously].\n\nJENNY. Well, Rummy, are you more comfortable now?\n\nRUMMY. God bless you, lovey! You've fed my body and saved my\nsoul, haven't you? [Jenny, touched, kisses her] Sit down and rest\na bit: you must be ready to drop.\n\nJENNY. I've been going hard since morning. But there's more work\nthan we can do. I mustn't stop.\n\nRUMMY. Try a prayer for just two minutes. You'll work all the\nbetter after.\n\nJENNY [her eyes lighting up] Oh isn't it wonderful how a few\nminutes prayer revives you! I was quite lightheaded at twelve\no'clock, I was so tired; but Major Barbara just sent me to pray\nfor five minutes; and I was able to go on as if I had only just\nbegun. [To Price] Did you have a piece of bread?\n\nPAIGE [with unction] Yes, miss; but I've got the piece that I\nvalue more; and that's the peace that passeth hall hannerstennin.\n\nRUMMY [fervently] Glory Hallelujah!\n\nBill Walker, a rough customer of about 25, appears at the yard\ngate and looks malevolently at Jenny.\n\nJENNY. That makes me so happy. When you say that, I feel wicked\nfor loitering here. I must get to work again.\n\nShe is hurrying to the shelter, when the new-comer moves quickly\nup to the door and intercepts her. His manner is so threatening\nthat she retreats as he comes at her truculently, driving her\ndown the yard.\n\nBILL. I know you. You're the one that took away my girl. You're\nthe one that set er agen me. Well, I'm goin to av er out. Not\nthat I care a curse for her or you: see? But I'll let er know;\nand I'll let you know. I'm goin to give er a doin that'll teach\ner to cut away from me. Now in with you and tell er to come out\nafore I come in and kick er out. Tell er Bill Walker wants er.\nShe'll know what that means; and if she keeps me waitin it'll be\nworse. You stop to jaw back at me; and I'll start on you: d'ye\nhear? There's your way. In you go. [He takes her by the arm and\nslings her towards the door of the shelter. She falls on her hand\nand knee. Rummy helps her up again].\n\nPRICE [rising, and venturing irresolutely towards Bill]. Easy\nthere, mate. She ain't doin you no arm.\n\nBILL. Who are you callin mate? [Standing over him threateningly].\nYou're goin to stand up for her, are you? Put up your ands.\n\nRUMMY [running indignantly to him to scold him]. Oh, you great\nbrute--  [He instantly swings his left hand back against her\nface. She screams and reels back to the trough, where she\nsits down, covering her bruised face with her hands and rocking\nand moaning with pain].\n\nJENNY [going to her]. Oh God forgive you! How could you strike an\nold woman like that?\n\nBILL [seizing her by the hair so violently that she also screams,\nand tearing her away from the old woman]. You Gawd forgive me\nagain and I'll Gawd forgive you one on the jaw that'll stop you\nprayin for a week. [Holding her and turning fiercely on Price].\nAv you anything to say agen it? Eh?\n\nPRICE [intimidated]. No, matey: she ain't anything to do with me.\n\nBILL. Good job for you! I'd put two meals into you and fight you\nwith one finger after, you starved cur. [To Jenny] Now are you\ngoin to fetch out Mog Habbijam; or am I to knock your face off\nyou and fetch her myself?\n\nJENNY [writhing in his grasp] Oh please someone go in and tell\nMajor Barbara--[she screams again as he wrenches her head down;\nand Price and Rummy, flee into the shelter].\n\nBILL. You want to go in and tell your Major of me, do you?\n\nJENNY. Oh please don't drag my hair. Let me go.\n\nBILL. Do you or don't you? [She stifles a scream]. Yes or no.\n\nJENNY. God give me strength--\n\nBILL [striking her with his fist in the face] Go and show her\nthat, and tell her if she wants one like it to come and interfere\nwith me. [Jenny, crying with pain, goes into the shed. He goes to\nthe form and addresses the old man]. Here: finish your mess; and\nget out o my way.\n\nSHIRLEY [springing up and facing him fiercely, with the mug in\nhis hand] You take a liberty with me, and I'll smash you over the\nface with the mug and cut your eye out. Ain't you satisfied--young\nwhelps like you--with takin the bread out o the mouths of your\nelders that have brought you up and slaved for you, but you\nmust come shovin and cheekin and bullyin in here, where the bread\no charity is sickenin in our stummicks?\n\nBILL [contemptuously, but backing a little] Wot good are you, you\nold palsy mug? Wot good are you?\n\nSHIRLEY. As good as you and better. I'll do a day's work agen you\nor any fat young soaker of your age. Go and take my job at\nHorrockses, where I worked for ten year. They want young men\nthere: they can't afford to keep men over forty-five. They're\nvery sorry--give you a character and happy to help you to get\nanything suited to your years--sure a steady man won't be long\nout of a job. Well, let em try you. They'll find the differ. What\ndo you know? Not as much as how to beeyave yourself--layin your\ndirty fist across the mouth of a respectable woman!\n\nBILL. Don't provoke me to lay it acrost yours: d'ye hear?\n\nSHIRLEY [with blighting contempt] Yes: you like an old man to\nhit, don't you, when you've finished with the women. I ain't seen\nyou hit a young one yet.\n\nBILL [stung] You lie, you old soupkitchener, you. There was a\nyoung man here. Did I offer to hit him or did I not?\n\nSHIRLEY. Was he starvin or was he not? Was he a man or only a\ncrosseyed thief an a loafer? Would you hit my son-in-law's\nbrother?\n\nBILL. Who's he?\n\nSHIRLEY. Todger Fairmile o Balls Pond. Him that won 20 pounds off\nthe Japanese wrastler at the music hall by standin out 17 minutes\n4 seconds agen him.\n\nBILL [sullenly] I'm no music hall wrastler. Can he box?\n\nSHIRLEY. Yes: an you can't.\n\nBILL. Wot! I can't, can't I? Wot's that you say [threatening\nhim]?\n\nSHIRLEY [not budging an inch] Will you box Todger Fairmile if I\nput him on to you? Say the word.\n\nBILL. [subsiding with a slouch] I'll stand up to any man alive,\nif he was ten Todger Fairmiles. But I don't set up to be a\nperfessional.\n\nSHIRLEY [looking down on him with unfathomable disdain] YOU box!\nSlap an old woman with the back o your hand! You hadn't even the\nsense to hit her where a magistrate couldn't see the mark of it,\nyou silly young lump of conceit and ignorance. Hit a girl in the\njaw and ony make her cry! If Todger Fairmile'd done it, she\nwouldn't a got up inside o ten minutes, no more than you would if\nhe got on to you. Yah! I'd set about you myself if I had a week's\nfeedin in me instead o two months starvation. [He returns to the\ntable to finish his meal].\n\nBILL [following him and stooping over him to drive the taunt in]\nYou lie! you have the bread and treacle in you that you come here\nto beg.\n\nSHIRLEY [bursting into tears] Oh God! it's true: I'm only an old\npauper on the scrap heap. [Furiously] But you'll come to it\nyourself; and then you'll know. You'll come to it sooner than a\nteetotaller like me, fillin yourself with gin at this hour o the\nmornin!\n\nBILL. I'm no gin drinker, you old liar; but when I want to give\nmy girl a bloomin good idin I like to av a bit o devil in me:\nsee? An here I am, talkin to a rotten old blighter like you sted\no givin her wot for. [Working himself into a rage] I'm goin in\nthere to fetch her out. [He makes vengefully for the shelter\ndoor].\n\nSHIRLEY. You're goin to the station on a stretcher, more likely;\nand they'll take the gin and the devil out of you there when they\nget you inside. You mind what you're about: the major here is the\nEarl o Stevenage's granddaughter.\n\nBILL [checked] Garn!\n\nSHIRLEY. You'll see.\n\nBILL [his resolution oozing] Well, I ain't done nothin to er.\n\nSHIRLEY. Spose she said you did! who'd believe you?\n\nBILL [very uneasy, skulking back to the corner of the penthouse]\nGawd! There's no jastice in this country. To think wot them\npeople can do! I'm as good as er.\n\nSHIRLEY. Tell her so. It's just what a fool like you would do.\n\nBarbara, brisk and businesslike, comes from the shelter with a\nnote book, and addresses herself to Shirley. Bill, cowed, sits\ndown in the corner on a form, and turns his back on them.\n\nBARBARA. Good morning.\n\nSHIRLEY [standing up and taking off his hat] Good morning, miss.\n\nBARBARA. Sit down: make yourself at home. [He hesitates; but she\nputs a friendly hand on his shoulder and makes him obey]. Now\nthen! since you've made friends with us, we want to know all\nabout you. Names and addresses and trades.\n\nSHIRLEY. Peter Shirley. Fitter. Chucked out two months ago\nbecause I was too old.\n\nBARBARA [not at all surprised] You'd pass still. Why didn't you\ndye your hair?\n\nSHIRLEY. I did. Me age come out at a coroner's inquest on me\ndaughter.\n\nBARBARA. Steady?\n\nSHIRLEY. Teetotaller. Never out of a job before. Good worker. And\nsent to the knockers like an old horse!\n\nBARBARA. No matter: if you did your part God will do his.\n\nSHIRLEY [suddenly stubborn] My religion's no concern of anybody\nbut myself.\n\nBARBARA [guessing] I know. Secularist?\n\nSHIRLEY [hotly] Did I offer to deny it?\n\nBARBARA. Why should you? My own father's a Secularist, I think.\nOur Father--yours and mine--fulfils himself in many ways; and I\ndaresay he knew what he was about when he made a Secularist of\nyou. So buck up, Peter! we can always find a job for a steady man\nlike you. [Shirley, disarmed, touches his hat. She turns from him\nto Bill]. What's your name?\n\nBILL [insolently] Wot's that to you?\n\nBARBARA [calmly making a note] Afraid to give his name. Any\ntrade?\n\nBILL. Who's afraid to give his name? [Doggedly, with a sense of\nheroically defying the House of Lords in the person of Lord\nStevenage] If you want to bring a charge agen me, bring it. [She\nwaits, unruffled]. My name's Bill Walker.\n\nBARBARA [as if the name were familiar: trying to remember how]\nBill Walker? [Recollecting] Oh, I know: you're the man that Jenny\nHill was praying for inside just now. [She enters his name in her\nnote book].\n\nBILL. Who's Jenny Hill? And what call has she to pray for me?\n\nBARBARA. I don't know. Perhaps it was you that cut her lip.\n\nBILL [defiantly] Yes, it was me that cut her lip. I ain't afraid\no you.\n\nBARBARA. How could you be, since you're not afraid of God? You're\na brave man, Mr. Walker. It takes some pluck to do our work here;\nbut none of us dare lift our hand against a girl like that, for\nfear of her father in heaven.\n\nBILL [sullenly] I want none o your cantin jaw. I suppose you\nthink I come here to beg from you, like this damaged lot here.\nNot me. I don't want your bread and scrape and catlap. I don't\nbelieve in your Gawd, no more than you do yourself.\n\nBARBARA [sunnily apologetic and ladylike, as on a new footing\nwith him] Oh, I beg your pardon for putting your name down, Mr.\nWalker. I didn't understand. I'll strike it out.\n\nBILL [taking this as a slight, and deeply wounded by it] Eah! you\nlet my name alone. Ain't it good enough to be in your book?\n\nBARBARA [considering] Well, you see, there's no use putting down\nyour name unless I can do something for you, is there? What's\nyour trade?\n\nBILL [still smarting] That's no concern o yours.\n\nBARBARA. Just so. [very businesslike] I'll put you down as\n[writing] the man who--struck--poor little Jenny Hill--in the\nmouth.\n\nBILL [rising threateningly] See here. I've ad enough o this.\n\nBARBARA [quite sunny and fearless] What did you come to us for?\n\nBILL. I come for my girl, see? I come to take her out o this and\nto break er jaws for her.\n\nBARBARA [complacently] You see I was right about your trade.\n[Bill, on the point of retorting furiously, finds himself, to his\ngreat shame and terror, in danger of crying instead. He sits down\nagain suddenly]. What's her name?\n\nBILL [dogged] Er name's Mog Abbijam: thats wot her name is.\n\nBARBARA. Oh, she's gone to Canning Town, to our barracks there.\n\nBILL [fortified by his resentment of Mog's perfidy] is she?\n[Vindictively] Then I'm goin to Kennintahn arter her. [He crosses\nto the gate; hesitates; finally comes back at Barbara]. Are you\nlyin to me to get shut o me?\n\nBARBARA. I don't want to get shut of you. I want to keep you here\nand save your soul. You'd better stay: you're going to have a bad\ntime today, Bill.\n\nBILL. Who's goin to give it to me? You, props.\n\nBARBARA. Someone you don't believe in. But you'll be glad\nafterwards.\n\nBILL [slinking off] I'll go to Kennintahn to be out o the reach o\nyour tongue. [Suddenly turning on her with intense malice] And if\nI don't find Mog there, I'll come back and do two years for you,\nselp me Gawd if I don't!\n\nBARBARA [a shade kindlier, if possible] It's no use, Bill. She's\ngot another bloke.\n\nBILL. Wot!\n\nBARBARA. One of her own converts. He fell in love with her when\nhe saw her with her soul saved, and her face clean, and her hair\nwashed.\n\nBILL [surprised] Wottud she wash it for, the carroty slut? It's\nred.\n\nBARBARA. It's quite lovely now, because she wears a new look in\nher eyes with it. It's a pity you're too late. The new bloke has\nput your nose out of joint, Bill.\n\nBILL. I'll put his nose out o joint for him. Not that I care a\ncurse for her, mind that. But I'll teach her to drop me as if I\nwas dirt. And I'll teach him to meddle with my Judy. Wots iz\nbleedin name?\n\nBARBARA. Sergeant Todger Fairmile.\n\nSHIRLEY [rising with grim joy] I'll go with him, miss. I want to\nsee them two meet. I'll take him to the infirmary when it's over.\n\nBILL [to Shirley, with undissembled misgiving] Is that im you was\nspeakin on?\n\nSHIRLEY. That's him.\n\nBILL. Im that wrastled in the music all?\n\nSHIRLEY. The competitions at the National Sportin Club was worth\nnigh a hundred a year to him. He's gev em up now for religion; so\nhe's a bit fresh for want of the exercise he was accustomed to.\nHe'll be glad to see you. Come along.\n\nBILL. Wots is weight?\n\nSHIRLEY. Thirteen four. [Bill's last hope expires].\n\nBARBARA. Go and talk to him, Bill. He'll convert you.\n\nSHIRLEY. He'll convert your head into a mashed potato.\n\nBILL [sullenly] I ain't afraid of him. I ain't afraid of\nennybody. But he can lick me. She's done me. [He sits down\nmoodily on the edge of the horse trough].\n\nSHIRLEY. You ain't goin. I thought not. [He resumes his seat].\n\nBARBARA [calling] Jenny!\n\nJENNY [appearing at the shelter door with a plaster on the corner\nof her mouth] Yes, Major.\n\nBARBARA. Send Rummy Mitchens out to clear away here.\n\nJENNY. I think she's afraid.\n\nBARBARA [her resemblance to her mother flashing out for a moment]\nNonsense! she must do as she's told.\n\nJENNY [calling into the shelter] Rummy: the Major says you must\ncome.\n\nJenny comes to Barbara, purposely keeping on the side next Bill,\nlest he should suppose that she shrank from him or bore malice.\n\nBARBARA. Poor little Jenny! Are you tired? [Looking at the\nwounded cheek] Does it hurt?\n\nJENNY. No: it's all right now. It was nothing.\n\nBARBARA [critically] It was as hard as he could hit, I expect.\nPoor Bill! You don't feel angry with him, do you?\n\nJENNY. Oh no, no, no: indeed I don't, Major, bless his poor\nheart! [Barbara kisses her; and she runs away merrily into the\nshelter. Bill writhes with an agonizing return of his new and\nalarming symptoms, but says nothing. Rummy Mitchens comes from\nthe shelter].\n\nBARBARA [going to meet Rummy] Now Rummy, bustle. Take in those\nmugs and plates to be washed; and throw the crumbs about for the\nbirds.\n\nRummy takes the three plates and mugs; but Shirley takes back his\nmug from her, as there it still come milk left in it.\n\nRUMMY. There ain't any crumbs. This ain't a time to waste good\nbread on birds.\n\nPRICE [appearing at the shelter door] Gentleman come to see the\nshelter, Major. Says he's your father.\n\nBARBARA. All right. Coming. [Snobby goes back into the shelter,\nfollowed by Barbara].\n\nRUMMY [stealing across to Bill and addressing him in a subdued\nvoice, but with intense conviction] I'd av the lor of you, you\nflat eared pignosed potwalloper, if she'd let me. You're no\ngentleman, to hit a lady in the face. [Bill, with greater things\nmoving in him, takes no notice].\n\nSHIRLEY [following her] Here! in with you and don't get yourself\ninto more trouble by talking.\n\nRUMMY [with hauteur] I ain't ad the pleasure o being hintroduced\nto you, as I can remember. [She goes into the shelter with the\nplates].\n\nBILL [savagely] Don't you talk to me, d'ye hear. You lea me\nalone, or I'll do you a mischief. I'm not dirt under your feet,\nanyway.\n\nSHIRLEY [calmly] Don't you be afeerd. You ain't such prime\ncompany that you need expect to be sought after. [He is about to\ngo into the shelter when Barbara comes out, with Undershaft on\nher right].\n\nBARBARA. Oh there you are, Mr Shirley! [Between them] This is my\nfather: I told you he was a Secularist, didn't I? Perhaps you'll\nbe able to comfort one another.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [startled] A Secularist! Not the least in the world:\non the contrary, a confirmed mystic.\n\nBARBARA. Sorry, I'm sure. By the way, papa, what is your\nreligion--in case I have to introduce you again?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My religion? Well, my dear, I am a Millionaire. That\nis my religion.\n\nBARBARA. Then I'm afraid you and Mr Shirley wont be able to\ncomfort one another after all. You're not a Millionaire, are you,\nPeter?\n\nSHIRLEY. No; and proud of it.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [gravely] Poverty, my friend, is not a thing to be\nproud of.\n\nSHIRLEY [angrily] Who made your millions for you? Me and my like.\nWhat's kep us poor? Keepin you rich. I wouldn't have your\nconscience, not for all your income.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I wouldn't have your income, not for all your\nconscience, Mr Shirley. [He goes to the penthouse and sits down\non a form].\n\nBARBARA [stopping Shirley adroitly as he is about to retort] You\nwouldn't think he was my father, would you, Peter? Will you go\ninto the shelter and lend the lasses a hand for a while: we're\nworked off our feet.\n\nSHIRLEY [bitterly] Yes: I'm in their debt for a meal, ain't I?\n\nBARBARA. Oh, not because you're in their debt; but for love of\nthem, Peter, for love of them. [He cannot understand, and is\nrather scandalized]. There! Don't stare at me. In with you; and\ngive that conscience of yours a holiday [bustling him into the\nshelter].\n\nSHIRLEY [as he goes in] Ah! it's a pity you never was trained to\nuse your reason, miss. You'd have been a very taking lecturer on\nSecularism.\n\nBarbara turns to her father.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Never mind me, my dear. Go about your work; and let\nme watch it for a while.\n\nBARBARA. All right.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. For instance, what's the matter with that out-patient\nover there?\n\nBARBARA [looking at Bill, whose attitude has never changed, and\nwhose expression of brooding wrath has deepened] Oh, we shall\ncure him in no time. Just watch. [She goes over to Bill and\nwaits. He glances up at her and casts his eyes down again,\nuneasy, but grimmer than ever]. It would be nice to just stamp on\nMog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill?\n\nBILL [starting up from the trough in consternation] It's a lie: I\nnever said so. [She shakes her head]. Who told you wot was in my\nmind?\n\nBARBARA. Only your new friend.\n\nBILL. Wot new friend?\n\nBARBARA. The devil, Bill. When he gets round people they get\nmiserable, just like you.\n\nHILL [with a heartbreaking attempt at devil-may-care\ncheerfulness] I ain't miserable. [He sits down again, and\nstretches his legs in an attempt to seem indifferent].\n\nBARBARA. Well, if you're happy, why don't you look happy, as we\ndo?\n\nBILL [his legs curling back in spite of him] I'm appy enough, I\ntell you. Why don't you lea me alown? Wot av I done to you? I\nain't smashed your face, av I?\n\nBARBARA [softly: wooing his soul] It's not me that's getting at\nyou, Bill.\n\nBILL. Who else is it?\n\nBARBARA. Somebody that doesn't intend you to smash women's faces,\nI suppose. Somebody or something that wants to make a man of you.\n\nBILL [blustering] Make a man o ME! Ain't I a man? eh? ain't I a\nman? Who sez I'm not a man?\n\nBARBARA. There's a man in you somewhere, I suppose. But why did\nhe let you hit poor little Jenny Hill? That wasn't very manly of\nhim, was it?\n\nBILL [tormented] Av done with it, I tell you. Chock it. I'm sick\nof your Jenny Ill and er silly little face.\n\nBARBARA. Then why do you keep thinking about it? Why does it keep\ncoming up against you in your mind? You're not getting converted,\nare you?\n\nBILL [with conviction] Not ME. Not likely. Not arf.\n\nBARBARA. That's right, Bill. Hold out against it. Put out your\nstrength. Don't let's get you cheap. Todger Fairmile said he\nwrestled for three nights against his Salvation harder than he\never wrestled with the Jap at the music hall. He gave in to the\nJap when his arm was going to break. But he didn't give in to his\nsalvation until his heart was going to break. Perhaps you'll\nescape that. You haven't any heart, have you?\n\nBILL. Wot dye mean? Wy ain't I got a art the same as ennybody\nelse?\n\nBARBARA. A man with a heart wouldn't have bashed poor little\nJenny's face, would he?\n\nBILL [almost crying] Ow, will you lea me alown? Av I ever offered\nto meddle with you, that you come noggin and provowkin me lawk\nthis? [He writhes convulsively from his eyes to his toes].\n\nBARBARA [with a steady soothing hand on his arm and a gentle\nvoice that never lets him go] It's your soul that's hurting you,\nBill, and not me. We've been through it all ourselves. Come with\nus, Bill. [He looks wildly round]. To brave manhood on earth and\neternal glory in heaven. [He is on the point of breaking down].\nCome. [A drum is heard in the shelter; and Bill, with a gasp,\nescapes from the spell as Barbara turns quickly. Adolphus enters\nfrom the shelter with a big drum]. Oh! there you are, Dolly. Let\nme introduce a new friend of mine, Mr Bill Walker. This is my\nbloke, Bill: Mr Cusins. [Cusins salutes with his drumstick].\n\nBILL. Goin to marry im?\n\nBARBARA. Yes.\n\nBILL [fervently] Gawd elp im! Gawd elp im!\n\nBARBARA. Why? Do you think he won't be happy with me?\n\nBILL. I've only ad to stand it for a mornin: e'll av to stand it\nfor a lifetime.\n\nCUSINS. That is a frightful reflection, Mr Walker. But I can't\ntear myself away from her.\n\nBILL. Well, I can. [To Barbara] Eah! do you know where I'm goin\nto, and wot I'm goin to do?\n\nBARBARA. Yes: you're going to heaven; and you're coming back here\nbefore the week's out to tell me so.\n\nBILL. You lie. I'm goin to Kennintahn, to spit in Todger\nFairmile's eye. I bashed Jenny Ill's face; and now I'll get me\nown face bashed and come back and show it to er. E'll it me\nardern I it er. That'll make us square. [To Adolphus] Is that\nfair or is it not? You're a genlmn: you oughter know.\n\nBARBARA. Two black eyes wont make one white one, Bill.\n\nBILL. I didn't ast you. Cawn't you never keep your mahth shut? I\nast the genlmn.\n\nCUSINS [reflectively] Yes: I think you're right, Mr Walker. Yes:\nI should do it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek\nwould have done.\n\nBARBARA. But what good will it do?\n\nCUSINS. Well, it will give Mr Fairmile some exercise; and it will\nsatisfy Mr Walker's soul.\n\nBILL. Rot! there ain't no sach a thing as a soul. Ah kin you tell\nwether I've a soul or not? You never seen it.\n\nBARBARA. I've seen it hurting you when you went against it.\n\nBILL [with compressed aggravation] If you was my girl and took\nthe word out o me mahth lawk thet, I'd give you suthink you'd\nfeel urtin, so I would. [To Adolphus] You take my tip, mate. Stop\ner jawr; or you'll die afore your time. [With intense expression]\nWore aht: thets wot you'll be: wore aht. [He goes away through\nthe gate].\n\nCUSINS [looking after him] I wonder!\n\nBARBARA. Dolly! [indignant, in her mother's manner].\n\nCUSINS. Yes, my dear, it's very wearing to be in love with you.\nIf it lasts, I quite think I shall die young.\n\nBARBARA. Should you mind?\n\nCUSINS. Not at all. [He is suddenly softened, and kisses her over\nthe drum, evidently not for the first time, as people cannot kiss\nover a big drum without practice. Undershaft coughs].\n\nBARBARA. It's all right, papa, we've not forgotten you. Dolly:\nexplain the place to papa: I haven't time. [She goes busily into\nthe shelter].\n\nUndershaft and Adolpbus now have the yard to themselves.\nUndershaft, seated on a form, and still keenly attentive, looks\nhard at Adolphus. Adolphus looks hard at him.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I fancy you guess something of what is in my mind, Mr\nCusins. [Cusins flourishes his drumsticks as if in the art of\nbeating a lively rataplan, but makes no sound]. Exactly so. But\nsuppose Barbara finds you out!\n\nCUSINS. You know, I do not admit that I am imposing on Barbara. I\nam quite genuinely interested in the views of the Salvation Army.\nThe fact is, I am a sort of collector of religions; and the\ncurious thing is that I find I can believe them all. By the way,\nhave you any religion?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes.\n\nCUSINS. Anything out of the common?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Only that there are two things necessary to\nSalvation.\n\nCUSINS [disappointed, but polite] Ah, the Church Catechism.\nCharles Lomax also belongs to the Established Church.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. The two things are--\n\nCUSINS. Baptism and--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. No. Money and gunpowder.\n\nCUSINS [surprised, but interested] That is the general opinion of\nour governing classes. The novelty is in hearing any man confess\nit.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Just so.\n\nCUSINS. Excuse me: is there any place in your religion for honor,\njustice, truth, love, mercy and so forth?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes: they are the graces and luxuries of a rich,\nstrong, and safe life.\n\nCUSINS. Suppose one is forced to choose between them and money or\ngunpowder?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Choose money and gunpowder; for without enough of\nboth you cannot afford the others.\n\nCUSINS. That is your religion?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes.\n\nThe cadence of this reply makes a full close in the conversation.\nCusins twists his face dubiously and contemplates Undershaft.\nUndershaft contemplates him.\n\nCUSINS. Barbara won't stand that. You will have to choose between\nyour religion and Barbara.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. So will you, my friend. She will find out that that\ndrum of yours is hollow.\n\nCUSINS. Father Undershaft: you are mistaken: I am a sincere\nSalvationist. You do not understand the Salvation Army. It is the\narmy of joy, of love, of courage: it has banished the fear and\nremorse and despair of the old hellridden evangelical sects: it\nmarches to fight the devil with trumpet and drum, with music and\ndancing, with banner and palm, as becomes a sally from heaven by\nits happy garrison. It picks the waster out of the public house\nand makes a man of him: it finds a worm wriggling in a back\nkitchen, and lo! a woman! Men and women of rank too, sons and\ndaughters of the Highest. It takes the poor professor of Greek,\nthe most artificial and self-suppressed of human creatures, from\nhis meal of roots, and lets loose the rhapsodist in him; reveals\nthe true worship of Dionysos to him; sends him down the public\nstreet drumming dithyrambs [he plays a thundering flourish on the\ndrum].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You will alarm the shelter.\n\nCUSINS. Oh, they are accustomed to these sudden ecstasies of\npiety. However, if the drum worries you-- [he pockets the\ndrumsticks; unhooks the drum; and stands it on the ground\nopposite the gateway].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Thank you.\n\nCUSINS. You remember what Euripides says about your money and\ngunpowder?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. No.\n\nCUSINS [declaiming]\n\n                      One and another\nIn money and guns may outpass his brother;\nAnd men in their millions float and flow\nAnd seethe with a million hopes as leaven;\nAnd they win their will; or they miss their will;\nAnd their hopes are dead or are pined for still:\n    But whoe'er can know\n    As the long days go\nThat to live is happy, has found his heaven.\n\nMy translation: what do you think of it?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I think, my friend, that if you wish to know,\nas the long days go, that to live is happy, you must first\nacquire money enough for a decent life, and power enough to be\nyour own master.\n\nCUSINS. You are damnably discouraging. [He resumes his\ndeclamation].\n\n      Is it so hard a thing to see\n      That the spirit of God--whate'er it be--\nThe Law that abides and changes not, ages long,\nThe Eternal and Nature-born: these things be strong.\nWhat else is Wisdom? What of Man's endeavor,\nOr God's high grace so lovely and so great?\nTo stand from fear set free? to breathe and wait?\nTo hold a hand uplifted over Fate?\nAnd shall not Barbara be loved for ever?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Euripides mentions Barbara, does he?\n\nCUSINS. It is a fair translation. The word means Loveliness.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. May I ask--as Barbara's father--how much a year she\nis to be loved for ever on?\n\nCUSINS. As Barbara's father, that is more your affair than mine.\nI can feed her by teaching Greek: that is about all.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Do you consider it a good match for her?\n\nCUSINS [with polite obstinacy] Mr Undershaft: I am in many ways a\nweak, timid, ineffectual person; and my health is far from\nsatisfactory. But whenever I feel that I must have anything, I\nget it, sooner or later. I feel that way about Barbara. I don't\nlike marriage: I feel intensely afraid of it; and I don't know\nwhat I shall do with Barbara or what she will do with me. But I\nfeel that I and nobody else must marry her. Please regard that as\nsettled.--Not that I wish to be arbitrary; but why should I waste\nyour time in discussing what is inevitable?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You mean that you will stick at nothing not even the\nconversion of the Salvation Army to the worship of Dionysos.\n\nCUSINS. The business of the Salvation Army is to save, not to\nwrangle about the name of the pathfinder. Dionysos or another:\nwhat does it matter?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [rising and approaching him] Professor Cusins you are\na young man after my own heart.\n\nCUSINS. Mr Undershaft: you are, as far as I am able to gather, a\nmost infernal old rascal; but you appeal very strongly to my\nsense of ironic humor.\n\nUndershaft mutely offers his hand. They shake.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [suddenly concentrating himself] And now to business.\n\nCUSINS. Pardon me. We were discussing religion. Why go back to\nsuch an uninteresting and unimportant subject as business?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Religion is our business at present, because it is\nthrough religion alone that we can win Barbara.\n\nCUSINS. Have you, too, fallen in love with Barbara?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes, with a father's love.\n\nCUSINS. A father's love for a grown-up daughter is the most\ndangerous of all infatuations. I apologize for mentioning my own\npale, coy, mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Keep to the point. We have to win her; and we are\nneither of us Methodists.\n\nCUSINS. That doesn't matter. The power Barbara wields here--the\npower that wields Barbara herself--is not Calvinism, not\nPresbyterianism, not Methodism--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Not Greek Paganism either, eh?\n\nCUSINS. I admit that. Barbara is quite original in her religion.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [triumphantly] Aha! Barbara Undershaft would be. Her\ninspiration comes from within herself.\n\nCUSINS. How do you suppose it got there?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [in towering excitement] It is the Undershaft\ninheritance. I shall hand on my torch to my daughter. She shall\nmake my converts and preach my gospel.\n\nCUSINS. What! Money and gunpowder!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes, money and gunpowder; freedom and power; command\nof life and command of death.\n\nCUSINS [urbanely: trying to bring him down to earth] This is\nextremely interesting, Mr Undershaft. Of course you know that you\nare mad.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [with redoubled force] And you?\n\nCUSINS. Oh, mad as a hatter. You are welcome to my secret since I\nhave discovered yours. But I am astonished. Can a madman make\ncannons?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Would anyone else than a madman make them? And now\n[with surging energy] question for question. Can a sane man\ntranslate Euripides?\n\nCUSINS. No.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [reining him by the shoulder] Can a sane woman make a\nman of a waster or a woman of a worm?\n\nCUSINS [reeling before the storm] Father Colossus--Mammoth\nMillionaire--\n\nUNDERSHAFT [pressing him] Are there two mad people or three in\nthis Salvation shelter to-day?\n\nCUSINS. You mean Barbara is as mad as we are!\n\nUNDERSHAFT [pushing him lightly off and resuming his equanimity\nsuddenly and completely] Pooh, Professor! let us call things by\ntheir proper names. I am a millionaire; you are a poet; Barbara\nis a savior of souls. What have we three to do with the common\nmob of slaves and idolaters? [He sits down again with a shrug of\ncontempt for the mob].\n\nCUSINS. Take care! Barbara is in love with the common people. So\nam I. Have you never felt the romance of that love?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [cold and sardonic] Have you ever been in love with\nPoverty, like St Francis? Have you ever been in love with Dirt,\nlike St Simeon? Have you ever been in love with disease and\nsuffering, like our nurses and philanthropists? Such passions are\nnot virtues, but the most unnatural of all the vices. This love\nof the common people may please an earl's granddaughter and a\nuniversity professor; but I have been a common man and a poor\nman; and it has no romance for me. Leave it to the poor to\npretend that poverty is a blessing: leave it to the coward to\nmake a religion of his cowardice by preaching humility: we know\nbetter than that. We three must stand together above the common\npeople: how else can we help their children to climb up beside\nus? Barbara must belong to us, not to the Salvation Army.\n\nCUSINS. Well, I can only say that if you think you will get her\naway from the Salvation Army by talking to her as you have been\ntalking to me, you don't know Barbara.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My friend: I never ask for what I can buy.\n\nCUSINS [in a white fury] Do I understand you to imply that you\ncan buy Barbara?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. No; but I can buy the Salvation Army.\n\nCUSINS. Quite impossible.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You shall see. All religious organizations exist by\nselling themselves to the rich.\n\nCUSINS. Not the Army. That is the Church of the poor.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. All the more reason for buying it.\n\nCUSINS. I don't think you quite know what the Army does for the\npoor.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Oh yes I do. It draws their teeth: that is enough for\nme--as a man of business--\n\nCUSINS. Nonsense! It makes them sober--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I prefer sober workmen. The profits are larger.\n\nCUSINS. --honest--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Honest workmen are the most economical.\n\nCUSINS. --attached to their homes--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. So much the better: they will put up with anything\nsooner than change their shop.\n\nCUSINS. --happy--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. An invaluable safeguard against revolution.\n\nCUSINS. --unselfish--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Indifferent to their own interests, which suits me\nexactly.\n\nCUSINS. --with their thoughts on heavenly things--\n\nUNDERSHAFT [rising] And not on Trade Unionism nor Socialism.\nExcellent.\n\nCUSINS [revolted] You really are an infernal old rascal.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [indicating Peter Shirley, who has just came from the\nshelter and strolled dejectedly down the yard between them] And\nthis is an honest man!\n\nSHIRLEY. Yes; and what av I got by it? [he passes on bitterly and\nsits on the form, in the corner of the penthouse].\n\nSnobby Price, beaming sanctimoniously, and Jenny Hill, with a\ntambourine full of coppers, come from the shelter and go to the\ndrum, on which Jenny begins to count the money.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [replying to Shirley] Oh, your employers must have got\na good deal by it from first to last. [He sits on the table, with\none foot on the side form. Cusins, overwhelmed, sits down on the\nsame form nearer the shelter. Barbara comes from the shelter to\nthe middle of the yard. She is excited and a little overwrought].\n\nBARBARA. We've just had a splendid experience meeting at the\nother gate in Cripps's lane. I've hardly ever seen them so much\nmoved as they were by your confession, Mr Price.\n\nPRICE. I could almost be glad of my past wickedness if I could\nbelieve that it would elp to keep hathers stright.\n\nBARBARA. So it will, Snobby. How much, Jenny?\n\nJENNY. Four and tenpence, Major.\n\nBARBARA. Oh Snobby, if you had given your poor mother just one\nmore kick, we should have got the whole five shillings!\n\nPRICE. If she heard you say that, miss, she'd be sorry I didn't.\nBut I'm glad. Oh what a joy it will be to her when she hears I'm\nsaved!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Shall I contribute the odd twopence, Barbara? The\nmillionaire's mite, eh? [He takes a couple of pennies from his\npocket.]\n\nBARBARA. How did you make that twopence?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. As usual. By selling cannons, torpedoes, submarines,\nand my new patent Grand Duke hand grenade.\n\nBARBARA. Put it back in your pocket. You can't buy your Salvation\nhere for twopence: you must work it out.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Is twopence not enough? I can afford a little more,\nif you press me.\n\nBARBARA. Two million millions would not be enough. There is bad\nblood on your hands; and nothing but good blood can cleanse them.\nMoney is no use. Take it away. [She turns to Cusins]. Dolly: you\nmust write another letter for me to the papers. [He makes a wry\nface]. Yes: I know you don't like it; but it must be done. The\nstarvation this winter is beating us: everybody is unemployed.\nThe General says we must close this shelter if we cant get more\nmoney. I force the collections at the meetings until I am\nashamed, don't I, Snobby?\n\nPRICE. It's a fair treat to see you work it, miss. The way you\ngot them up from three-and-six to four-and-ten with that hymn,\npenny by penny and verse by verse, was a caution. Not a Cheap\nJack on Mile End Waste could touch you at it.\n\nBARBARA. Yes; but I wish we could do without it. I am getting at\nlast to think more of the collection than of the people's souls.\nAnd what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence? We want\nthousands! tens of thousands! hundreds of thousands! I want to\nconvert people, not to be always begging for the Army in a way\nI'd die sooner than beg for myself.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [in profound irony] Genuine unselfishness is capable\nof anything, my dear.\n\nBARBARA [unsuspectingly, as she turns away to take the money\nfrom the drum and put it in a cash bag she carries] Yes, isn't\nit? [Undershaft looks sardonically at Cusins].\n\nCUSINS [aside to Undershaft] Mephistopheles! Machiavelli!\n\nBARBARA [tears coming into her eyes as she ties the bag and\npockets it] How are we to feed them? I can't talk religion to a\nman with bodily hunger in his eyes. [Almost breaking down] It's\nfrightful.\n\nJENNY [running to her] Major, dear--\n\nBARBARA [rebounding] No: don't comfort me. It will be all right.\nWe shall get the money.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. How?\n\nJENNY. By praying for it, of course. Mrs Baines says she prayed\nfor it last night; and she has never prayed for it in vain: never\nonce. [She goes to the gate and looks out into the street].\n\nBARBARA [who has dried her eyes and regained her composure] By\nthe way, dad, Mrs Baines has come to march with us to our big\nmeeting this afternoon; and she is very anxious to meet you, for\nsome reason or other. Perhaps she'll convert you.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I shall be delighted, my dear.\n\nJENNY [at the gate: excitedly] Major! Major! Here's that man back\nagain.\n\nBARBARA. What man?\n\nJENNY. The man that hit me. Oh, I hope he's coming back to join\nus.\n\nBill Walker, with frost on his jacket, comes through the gate,\nhis hands deep in his pockets and his chin sunk between his\nshoulders, like a cleaned-out gambler. He halts between Barbara\nand the drum.\n\nBARBARA. Hullo, Bill! Back already!\n\nBILL [nagging at her] Bin talkin ever sense, av you?\n\nBARBARA. Pretty nearly. Well, has Todger paid you out for poor\nJenny's jaw?\n\nBILL. NO he ain't.\n\nBARBARA. I thought your jacket looked a bit snowy.\n\nBILL. So it is snowy. You want to know where the snow come from,\ndon't you?\n\nBARBARA. Yes.\n\nBILL. Well, it come from off the ground in Parkinses Corner in\nKennintahn. It got rubbed off be my shoulders see?\n\nBARBARA. Pity you didn't rub some off with your knees, Bill! That\nwould have done you a lot of good.\n\nBILL [with your mirthless humor] I was saving another man's knees\nat the time. E was kneelin on my ed, so e was.\n\nJENNY. Who was kneeling on your head?\n\nBILL. Todger was. E was prayin for me: prayin comfortable with me\nas a carpet. So was Mog. So was the ole bloomin meetin. Mog she\nsez \"O Lord break is stubborn spirit; but don't urt is dear art.\"\nThat was wot she said. \"Don't urt is dear art\"! An er bloke--thirteen\nstun four!--kneelin wiv all is weight on me. Funny, ain't it?\n\nJENNY. Oh no. We're so sorry, Mr Walker.\n\nBARBARA [enjoying it frankly] Nonsense! of course it's funny.\nServed you right, Bill! You must have done something to him\nfirst.\n\nBILL [doggedly] I did wot I said I'd do. I spit in is eye. E\nlooks up at the sky and sez, \"O that I should be fahnd worthy to\nbe spit upon for the gospel's sake!\" a sez; an Mog sez \"Glory\nAllelloolier!\"; an then a called me Brother, an dahned me as if I\nwas a kid and a was me mother washin me a Setterda nawt. I adn't\njust no show wiv im at all. Arf the street prayed; an the tother\narf larfed fit to split theirselves. [To Barbara] There! are you\nsettisfawd nah?\n\nBARBARA [her eyes dancing] Wish I'd been there, Bill.\n\nBILL. Yes: you'd a got in a hextra bit o talk on me, wouldn't\nyou?\n\nJENNY. I'm so sorry, Mr. Walker.\n\nBILL [fiercely] Don't you go bein sorry for me: you've no call.\nListen ere. I broke your jawr.\n\nJENNY. No, it didn't hurt me: indeed it didn't, except for a\nmoment. It was only that I was frightened.\n\nBILL. I don't want to be forgive be you, or be ennybody. Wot I\ndid I'll pay for. I tried to get me own jawr broke to settisfaw\nyou--\n\nJENNY [distressed] Oh no--\n\nBILL [impatiently] Tell y'I did: cawn't you listen to wot's bein\ntold you? All I got be it was bein made a sight of in the public\nstreet for me pains. Well, if I cawn't settisfaw you one way, I\ncan another. Listen ere! I ad two quid saved agen the frost; an\nI've a pahnd of it left. A mate n mine last week ad words with\nthe Judy e's goin to marry. E give er wot-for; an e's bin fined\nfifteen bob. E ad a right to it er because they was goin to be\nmarrid; but I adn't no right to it you; so put anather fawv bob\non an call it a pahnd's worth. [He produces a sovereign]. Ere's\nthe money. Take it; and let's av no more o your forgivin an\nprayin and your Major jawrin me. Let wot I done be done and paid\nfor; and let there be a end of it.\n\nJENNY. Oh, I couldn't take it, Mr. Walker. But if you would give\na shilling or two to poor Rummy Mitchens! you really did hurt\nher; and she's old.\n\nBILL [contemptuously] Not likely. I'd give her anather as soon as\nlook at er. Let her av the lawr o me as she threatened! She ain't\nforgiven me: not mach. Wot I done to er is not on me mawnd--wot\nshe [indicating Barbara] might call on me conscience--no more\nthan stickin a pig. It's this Christian game o yours that I won't\nav played agen me: this bloomin forgivin an noggin an jawrin that\nmakes a man that sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im. I won't av\nit, I tell you; so take your money and stop throwin your silly\nbashed face hup agen me.\n\nJENNY. Major: may I take a little of it for the Army?\n\nBARBARA. No: the Army is not to be bought. We want your soul,\nBill; and we'll take nothing less.\n\nBILL [bitterly] I know. It ain't enough. Me an me few shillins is\nnot good enough for you. You're a earl's grendorter, you are.\nNothin less than a underd pahnd for you.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come, Barbara! you could do a great deal of good with\na hundred pounds. If you will set this gentleman's mind at ease\nby taking his pound, I will give the other ninety-nine [Bill,\nastounded by such opulence, instinctively touches his cap].\n\nBARBARA. Oh, you're too extravagant, papa. Bill offers twenty\npieces of silver. All you need offer is the other ten. That will\nmake the standard price to buy anybody who's for sale. I'm not;\nand the Army's not. [To Bill] You'll never have another quiet\nmoment, Bill, until you come round to us. You can't stand out\nagainst your salvation.\n\nBILL [sullenly] I cawn't stend aht agen music all wrastlers and\nartful tongued women. I've offered to pay. I can do no more. Take\nit or leave it. There it is. [He throws the sovereign on the\ndrum, and sits down on the horse-trough. The coin fascinates\nSnobby Price, who takes an early opportunity of dropping his cap\non it].\n\nMrs Baines comes from the shelter. She is dressed as a Salvation\nArmy Commissioner. She is an earnest looking woman of about 40,\nwith a caressing, urgent voice, and an appealing manner.\n\nBARBARA. This is my father, Mrs Baines. [Undershaft comes from\nthe table, taking his hat off with marked civility]. Try what you\ncan do with him. He won't listen to me, because he remembers what\na fool I was when I was a baby.\n\n[She leaves them together and chats with Jenny].\n\nMRS BAINES. Have you been shown over the shelter, Mr Undershaft?\nYou know the work we're doing, of course.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [very civilly] The whole nation knows it, Mrs Baines.\n\nMRS BAINES. No, Sir: the whole nation does not know it, or we\nshould not be crippled as we are for want of money to carry our\nwork through the length and breadth of the land. Let me tell you\nthat there would have been rioting this winter in London but for\nus.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You really think so?\n\nMRS BAINES. I know it. I remember 1886, when you rich gentlemen\nhardened your hearts against the cry of the poor. They broke the\nwindows of your clubs in Pall Mall.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [gleaming with approval of their method] And the\nMansion House Fund went up next day from thirty thousand pounds\nto seventy-nine thousand! I remember quite well.\n\nMRS BAINES. Well, won't you help me to get at the people? They\nwon't break windows then. Come here, Price. Let me show you to\nthis gentleman [Price comes to be inspected]. Do you remember the\nwindow breaking?\n\nPRICE. My ole father thought it was the revolution, ma'am.\n\nMRS BAINES. Would you break windows now?\n\nPRICE. Oh no ma'm. The windows of eaven av bin opened to me. I\nknow now that the rich man is a sinner like myself.\n\nRUMMY [appearing above at the loft door] Snobby Price!\n\nSNOBBY. Wot is it?\n\nRUMMY. Your mother's askin for you at the other gate in Crippses\nLane. She's heard about your confession [Price turns pale].\n\nMRS BAINES. Go, Mr. Price; and pray with her.\n\nJENNY. You can go through the shelter, Snobby.\n\nPRICE [to Mrs Baines] I couldn't face her now; ma'am, with all\nthe weight of my sins fresh on me. Tell her she'll find her son\nat ome, waitin for her in prayer. [He skulks off through the\ngate, incidentally stealing the sovereign on his way out by\npicking up his cap from the drum].\n\nMRS BAINES [with swimming eyes] You see how we take the anger and\nthe bitterness against you out of their hearts, Mr Undershaft.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. It is certainly most convenient and gratifying to all\nlarge employers of labor, Mrs Baines.\n\nMRS BAINES. Barbara: Jenny: I have good news: most wonderful\nnews. [Jenny runs to her]. My prayers have been answered. I told\nyou they would, Jenny, didn't I?\n\nJENNY. Yes, yes.\n\nBARBARA [moving nearer to the drum] Have we got money enough to\nkeep the shelter open?\n\nMRS BAINES. I hope we shall have enough to keep all the shelters\nopen. Lord Saxmundham has promised us five thousand pounds--\n\nBARBARA. Hooray!\n\nJENNY. Glory!\n\nMRS BAINES. --if--\n\nBARBARA. \"If!\" If what?\n\nMRS BAINES. If five other gentlemen will give a thousand each to\nmake it up to ten thousand.\n\nBARBARA. Who is Lord Saxmundham? I never heard of him.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [who has pricked up his ears at the peer's name, and\nis now watching Barbara curiously] A new creation, my dear. You\nhave heard of Sir Horace Bodger?\n\nBARBARA. Bodger! Do you mean the distiller? Bodger's whisky!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. That is the man. He is one of the greatest of our\npublic benefactors. He restored the cathedral at Hakington. They\nmade him a baronet for that. He gave half a million to the funds\nof his party: they made him a baron for that.\n\nSHIRLEY. What will they give him for the five thousand?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. There is nothing left to give him. So the five\nthousand, I should think, is to save his soul.\n\nMRS BAINES. Heaven grant it may! Oh Mr. Undershaft, you have some\nvery rich friends. Can't you help us towards the other five\nthousand? We are going to hold a great meeting this afternoon at\nthe Assembly Hall in the Mile End Road. If I could only announce\nthat one gentleman had come forward to support Lord Saxmundham,\nothers would follow. Don't you know somebody? Couldn't you?\nWouldn't you? [her eyes fill with tears] oh, think of those poor\npeople, Mr Undershaft: think of how much it means to them, and\nhow little to a great man like you.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [sardonically gallant] Mrs Baines: you are\nirresistible. I can't disappoint you; and I can't deny myself the\nsatisfaction of making Bodger pay up. You shall have your five\nthousand pounds.\n\nMRS BAINES. Thank God!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You don't thank me?\n\nMRS BAINES. Oh sir, don't try to be cynical: don't be ashamed of\nbeing a good man. The Lord will bless you abundantly; and our\nprayers will be like a strong fortification round you all the\ndays of your life. [With a touch of caution] You will let me have\nthe cheque to show at the meeting, won't you? Jenny: go in and\nfetch a pen and ink. [Jenny runs to the shelter door].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Do not disturb Miss Hill: I have a fountain pen.\n[Jenny halts. He sits at the table and writes the cheque. Cusins\nrises to make more room for him. They all watch him silently].\n\nBILL [cynically, aside to Barbara, his voice and accent horribly\ndebased] Wot prawce Selvytion nah?\n\nBARBARA. Stop. [Undershaft stops writing: they all turn to her in\nsurprise]. Mrs Baines: are you really going to take this money?\n\nMRS BAINES [astonished] Why not, dear?\n\nBARBARA. Why not! Do you know what my father is? Have you\nforgotten that Lord Saxmundham is Bodger the whisky man? Do you\nremember how we implored the County Council to stop him from\nwriting Bodger's Whisky in letters of fire against the sky; so\nthat the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not\nwake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of\ntheir deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign? Do you know that the\nworst thing I have had to fight here is not the devil, but\nBodger, Bodger, Bodger, with his whisky, his distilleries, and\nhis tied houses? Are you going to make our shelter another tied\nhouse for him, and ask me to keep it?\n\nBILL. Rotten drunken whisky it is too.\n\nMRS BAINES. Dear Barbara: Lord Saxmundham has a soul to be saved\nlike any of us. If heaven has found the way to make a good use of\nhis money, are we to set ourselves up against the answer to our\nprayers?\n\nBARBARA. I know he has a soul to be saved. Let him come down\nhere; and I'll do my best to help him to his salvation. But he\nwants to send his cheque down to buy us, and go on being as\nwicked as ever.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [with a reasonableness which Cusins alone perceives to\nbe ironical] My dear Barbara: alcohol is a very necessary\narticle. It heals the sick--\n\nBARBARA. It does nothing of the sort.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well, it assists the doctor: that is perhaps a less\nquestionable way of putting it. It makes life bearable to\nmillions of people who could not endure their existence if they\nwere quite sober. It enables Parliament to do things at eleven at\nnight that no sane person would do at eleven in the morning. Is\nit Bodger's fault that this inestimable gift is deplorably abused\nby less than one per cent of the poor? [He turns again to the\ntable; signs the cheque; and crosses it].\n\nMRS BAINES. Barbara: will there be less drinking or more if all\nthose poor souls we are saving come to-morrow and find the doors\nof our shelters shut in their faces? Lord Saxmundham gives us the\nmoney to stop drinking--to take his own business from him.\n\nCUSINS [impishly] Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly!\nBless dear Bodger! [Barbara almost breaks down as Adolpbus, too,\nfails her].\n\nUNDERSHAFT [tearing out the cheque and pocketing the book as he\nrises and goes past Cusins to Mrs Baines] I also, Mrs Baines, may\nclaim a little disinterestedness. Think of my business! think of\nthe widows and orphans! the men and lads torn to pieces with\nshrapnel and poisoned with lyddite [Mrs Baines shrinks; but he\ngoes on remorselessly]! the oceans of blood, not one drop of\nwhich is shed in a really just cause! the ravaged crops! the\npeaceful peasants forced, women and men, to till their fields\nunder the fire of opposing armies on pain of starvation! the bad\nblood of the fierce little cowards at home who egg on others to\nfight for the gratification of their national vanity! All this\nmakes money for me: I am never richer, never busier than when the\npapers are full of it. Well, it is your work to preach peace on\nearth and goodwill to men. [Mrs Baines's face lights up again].\nEvery convert you make is a vote against war. [Her lips move in\nprayer]. Yet I give you this money to help you to hasten my own\ncommercial ruin. [He gives her the cheque].\n\nCUSINS [mounting the form in an ecstasy of mischief] The\nmillennium will be inaugurated by the unselfishness of Undershaft\nand Bodger. Oh be joyful! [He takes the drumsticks from his\npockets and flourishes them].\n\nMRS BAINES [taking the cheque] The longer I live the more proof I\nsee that there is an Infinite Goodness that turns everything to\nthe work of salvation sooner or later. Who would have thought\nthat any good could have come out of war and drink? And yet their\nprofits are brought today to the feet of salvation to do its\nblessed work. [She is affected to tears].\n\nJENNY [running to Mrs Baines and throwing her arms round her] Oh\ndear! how blessed, how glorious it all is!\n\nCUSINS [in a convulsion of irony] Let us seize this unspeakable\nmoment. Let us march to the great meeting at once. Excuse me just\nan instant. [He rushes into the shelter. Jenny takes her\ntambourine from the drum head].\n\nMRS BAINES. Mr Undershaft: have you ever seen a thousand people\nfall on their knees with one impulse and pray? Come with us to\nthe meeting. Barbara shall tell them that the Army is saved, and\nsaved through you.\n\nCUSINS [returning impetuously from the shelter with a flag and a\ntrombone, and coming between Mrs Baines and Undershaft] You shall\ncarry the flag down the first street, Mrs Baines [he gives her\nthe flag]. Mr Undershaft is a gifted trombonist: he shall intone\nan Olympian diapason to the West Ham Salvation March. [Aside to\nUndershaft, as he forces the trombone on him] Blow, Machiavelli,\nblow.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [aside to him, as he takes the trombone] The trumpet\nin Zion! [Cusins rushes to the drum, which he takes up and puts\non. Undershaft continues, aloud] I will do my best. I could vamp\na bass if I knew the tune.\n\nCUSINS. It is a wedding chorus from one of Donizetti's operas;\nbut we have converted it. We convert everything to good here,\nincluding Bodger. You remember the chorus. \"For thee immense\nrejoicing--immenso giubilo--immenso giubilo.\" [With drum\nobbligato] Rum tum ti tum tum, tum tum ti ta--\n\nBARBARA. Dolly: you are breaking my heart.\n\nCUSINS. What is a broken heart more or less here? Dionysos\nUndershaft has descended. I am possessed.\n\nMRS BAINES. Come, Barbara: I must have my dear Major to carry the\nflag with me.\n\nJENNY. Yes, yes, Major darling.\n\nCUSINS [snatches the tambourine out of Jenny's hand and mutely\noffers it to Barbara].\n\nBARBARA [coming forward a little as she puts the offer behind her\nwith a shudder, whilst Cusins recklessly tosses the tambourine\nback to Jenny and goes to the gate] I can't come.\n\nJENNY. Not come!\n\nMRS BAINES [with tears in her eyes] Barbara: do you think\nI am wrong to take the money?\n\nBARBARA [impulsively going to her and kissing her] No, no:\nGod help you, dear, you must: you are saving the Army. Go; and\nmay you have a great meeting!\n\nJENNY. But arn't you coming?\n\nBARBARA. No. [She begins taking off the silver brooch from her\ncollar].\n\nMRS BAINES. Barbara: what are you doing?\n\nJENNY. Why are you taking your badge off? You can't be going to\nleave us, Major.\n\nBARBARA [quietly] Father: come here.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [coming to her] My dear! [Seeing that she is going to\npin the badge on his collar, he retreats to the penthouse in some\nalarm].\n\nBARBARA [following him] Don't be frightened. [She pins the badge\non and steps back towards the table, showing him to the others]\nThere! It's not much for 5000 pounds is it?\n\nMRS BAINES. Barbara: if you won't come and pray with us, promise\nme you will pray for us.\n\nBARBARA. I can't pray now. Perhaps I shall never pray again.\n\nMRS BAINES. Barbara!\n\nJENNY. Major!\n\nBARBARA [almost delirious] I can't bear any more. Quick march!\n\nCUSINS [calling to the procession in the street outside] Off we\ngo. Play up, there! Immenso giubilo. [He gives the time with his\ndrum; and the band strikes up the march, which rapidly becomes\nmore distant as the procession moves briskly away].\n\nMRS BAINES. I must go, dear. You're overworked: you will be all\nright tomorrow. We'll never lose you. Now Jenny: step out with\nthe old flag. Blood and Fire! [She marches out through the gate\nwith her flag].\n\nJENNY. Glory Hallelujah! [flourishing her tambourine and\nmarching].\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Cusins, as he marches out past him easing the\nslide of his trombone] \"My ducats and my daughter\"!\n\nCUSINS [following him out] Money and gunpowder!\n\nBARBARA. Drunkenness and Murder! My God: why hast thou forsaken\nme?\n\nShe sinks on the form with her face buried in her hands. The\nmarch passes away into silence. Bill Walker steals across to her.\n\nBILL [taunting] Wot prawce Selvytion nah?\n\nSHIRLEY. Don't you hit her when she's down.\n\nBILL. She it me wen aw wiz dahn. Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me\nown back?\n\nBARBARA [raising her head] I didn't take your money, Bill. [She\ncrosses the yard to the gate and turns her back on the two men to\nhide her face from them].\n\nBILL [sneering after her] Naow, it warn't enough for you.\n[Turning to the drum, he misses the money]. Ellow! If you ain't\ntook it summun else az. Were's it gorn? Blame me if Jenny Ill\ndidn't take it arter all!\n\nRUMMY [screaming at him from the loft] You lie, you dirty\nblackguard! Snobby Price pinched it off the drum wen e took ap iz\ncap. I was ap ere all the time an see im do it.\n\nBILL. Wot! Stowl maw money! Waw didn't you call thief on him, you\nsilly old mucker you?\n\nRUMMY. To serve you aht for ittin me acrost the face. It's cost\ny'pahnd, that az. [Raising a paean of squalid triumph] I done\nyou. I'm even with you. I've ad it aht o y--. [Bill snatches up\nShirley's mug and hurls it at her. She slams the loft door and\nvanishes. The mug smashes against the door and falls in\nfragments].\n\nBILL [beginning to chuckle] Tell us, ole man, wot o'clock this\nmorrun was it wen im as they call Snobby Prawce was sived?\n\nBARBARA [turning to him more composedly, and with unspoiled\nsweetness] About half past twelve, Bill. And he pinched your\npound at a quarter to two. I know. Well, you can't afford to lose\nit. I'll send it to you.\n\nBILL [his voice and accent suddenly improving] Not if I was to\nstarve for it. I ain't to be bought.\n\nSHIRLEY. Ain't you? You'd sell yourself to the devil for a pint o\nbeer; ony there ain't no devil to make the offer.\n\nBILL [unshamed] So I would, mate, and often av, cheerful. But she\ncawn't buy me. [Approaching Barbara] You wanted my soul, did you?\nWell, you ain't got it.\n\nBARBARA. I nearly got it, Bill. But we've sold it back to you for\nten thousand pounds.\n\nSHIRLEY. And dear at the money!\n\nBARBARA. No, Peter: it was worth more than money.\n\nBILL [salvationproof] It's no good: you cawn't get rahnd me nah.\nI don't blieve in it; and I've seen today that I was right.\n[Going] So long, old soupkitchener! Ta, ta, Major Earl's Grendorter!\n[Turning at the gate] Wot prawce Selvytion nah? Snobby Prawce!\nHa! ha!\n\nBARBARA [offering her hand] Goodbye, Bill.\n\nBILL [taken aback, half plucks his cap off then shoves it on\nagain defiantly] Git aht. [Barbara drops her hand, discouraged.\nHe has a twinge of remorse]. But thet's aw rawt, you knaow.\nNathink pasnl. Naow mellice. So long, Judy. [He goes].\n\nBARBARA. No malice. So long, Bill.\n\nSHIRLEY [shaking his head] You make too much of him, miss, in\nyour innocence.\n\nBARBARA [going to him] Peter: I'm like you now. Cleaned out, and\nlost my job.\n\nSHIRLEY. You've youth an hope. That's two better than me. That's\nhope for you.\n\nBARBARA. I'll get you a job, Peter, the youth will have to be\nenough for me. [She counts her money]. I have just enough left\nfor two teas at Lockharts, a Rowton doss for you, and my tram and\nbus home. [He frowns and rises with offended pride. She takes his\narm]. Don't be proud, Peter: it's sharing between friends. And\npromise me you'll talk to me and not let me cry. [She draws him\ntowards the gate].\n\nSHIRLEY. Well, I'm not accustomed to talk to the like of you--\n\nBARBARA [urgently] Yes, yes: you must talk to me. Tell me about\nTom Paine's books and Bradlaugh's lectures. Come along.\n\nSHIRLEY. Ah, if you would only read Tom Paine in the proper\nspirit, miss! [They go out through the gate together].\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nNext day after lunch Lady Britomart is writing in the library in\nWilton Crescent. Sarah is reading in the armchair near the\nwindow. Barbara, in ordinary dresss, pale and brooding, is on the\nsettee. Charley Lomax enters. Coming forward between the settee\nand the writing table, he starts on seeing Barbara fashionably\nattired and in low spirits.\n\nLOMAX. You've left off your uniform!\n\nBarbara says nothing; but an expression of pain passes over\nher face.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [warning him in low tones to be careful] Charles!\n\nLOMAX [much concerned, sitting down sympathetically on the settee\nbeside Barbara] I'm awfully sorry, Barbara. You know I helped you\nall I could with the concertina and so forth. [Momentously]\nStill, I have never shut my eyes to the fact that there is a\ncertain amount of tosh about the Salvation Army. Now the claims\nof the Church of England--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. That's enough, Charles. Speak of something suited\nto your mental capacity.\n\nLOMAX. But surely the Church of England is suited to all our\ncapacities.\n\nBARBARA [pressing his hand] Thank you for your sympathy, Cholly.\nNow go and spoon with Sarah.\n\nLOMAX [rising and going to Sarah] How is my ownest today?\n\nSARAH. I wish you wouldn't tell Cholly to do things, Barbara. He\nalways comes straight and does them. Cholly: we're going to the\nworks at Perivale St. Andrews this afternoon.\n\nLOMAX. What works?\n\nSARAH. The cannon works.\n\nLOMAX. What! Your governor's shop!\n\nSARAH. Yes.\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say!\n\nCusins enters in poor condition. He also starts visibly when he\nsees Barbara without her uniform.\n\nBARBARA. I expected you this morning, Dolly. Didn't you guess\nthat?\n\nCUSINS [sitting down beside her] I'm sorry. I have only just\nbreakfasted.\n\nSARAH. But we've just finished lunch.\n\nBARBARA. Have you had one of your bad nights?\n\nCUSINS. No: I had rather a good night: in fact, one of the most\nremarkable nights I have ever passed.\n\nBARBARA. The meeting?\n\nCUSINS. No: after the meeting.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You should have gone to bed after the meeting.\nWhat were you doing?\n\nCUSINS. Drinking.\n\n  LADY BRITOMART. }{ Adolphus!\n  SARAH.          }{ Dolly!\n  BARBARA.        }{ Dolly!\n  LOMAX.          }{ Oh I say!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. What were you drinking, may I ask?\n\nCUSINS. A most devilish kind of Spanish burgundy, warranted free\nfrom added alcohol: a Temperance burgundy in fact. Its richness\nin natural alcohol made any addition superfluous.\n\nBARBARA. Are you joking, Dolly?\n\nCUSINS [patiently] No. I have been making a night of it with the\nnominal head of this household: that is all.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew made you drunk!\n\nCUSINS. No: he only provided the wine. I think it was Dionysos\nwho made me drunk. [To Barbara] I told you I was possessed.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You're not sober yet. Go home to bed at once.\n\nCUSINS. I have never before ventured to reproach you, Lady Brit;\nbut how could you marry the Prince of Darkness?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It was much more excusable to marry him than to\nget drunk with him. That is a new accomplishment of Andrew's, by\nthe way. He usen't to drink.\n\nCUSINS. He doesn't now. He only sat there and completed the wreck\nof my moral basis, the rout of my convictions, the purchase of my\nsoul. He cares for you, Barbara. That is what makes him so\ndangerous to me.\n\nBARBARA. That has nothing to do with it, Dolly. There are larger\nloves and diviner dreams than the fireside ones. You know that,\ndon't you?\n\nCUSINS. Yes: that is our understanding. I know it. I hold to it.\nUnless he can win me on that holier ground he may amuse me for a\nwhile; but he can get no deeper hold, strong as he is.\n\nBARBARA. Keep to that; and the end will be right. Now tell me\nwhat happened at the meeting?\n\nCUSINS. It was an amazing meeting. Mrs Baines almost died of\nemotion. Jenny Hill went stark mad with hysteria. The Prince of\nDarkness played his trombone like a madman: its brazen roarings\nwere like the laughter of the damned. 117 conversions took place\nthen and there. They prayed with the most touching sincerity and\ngratitude for Bodger, and for the anonymous donor of the 5000\npounds. Your father would not let his name be given.\n\nLOMAX. That was rather fine of the old man, you know. Most chaps\nwould have wanted the advertisement.\n\nCUSINS. He said all the charitable institutions would be down on\nhim like kites on a battle field if he gave his name.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. That's Andrew all over. He never does a proper\nthing without giving an improper reason for it.\n\nCUSINS. He convinced me that I have all my life been doing\nimproper things for proper reasons.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Adolphus: now that Barbara has left the Salvation\nArmy, you had better leave it too. I will not have you playing\nthat drum in the streets.\n\nCUSINS. Your orders are already obeyed, Lady Brit.\n\nBARBARA. Dolly: were you ever really in earnest about it? Would\nyou have joined if you had never seen me?\n\nCUSINS [disingenuously] Well--er--well, possibly, as a collector\nof religions--\n\nLOMAX [cunningly] Not as a drummer, though, you know. You are a\nvery clearheaded brainy chap, Cholly; and it must have been\napparent to you that there is a certain amount of tosh about--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Charles: if you must drivel, drivel like a\ngrown-up man and not like a schoolboy.\n\nLOMAX [out of countenance] Well, drivel is drivel, don't you\nknow, whatever a man's age.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. In good society in England, Charles, men drivel\nat all ages by repeating silly formulas with an air of wisdom.\nSchoolboys make their own formulas out of slang, like you. When\nthey reach your age, and get political private secretaryships and\nthings of that sort, they drop slang and get their formulas out\nof The Spectator or The Times. You had better confine yourself to\nThe Times. You will find that there is a certain amount of tosh\nabout The Times; but at least its language is reputable.\n\nLOMAX [overwhelmed] You are so awfully strong-minded, Lady Brit--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Rubbish! [Morrison comes in]. What is it?\n\nMORRISON. If you please, my lady, Mr Undershaft has just drove up\nto the door.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Well, let him in. [Morrison hesitates]. What's\nthe matter with you?\n\nMORRISON. Shall I announce him, my lady; or is he at home here,\nso to speak, my lady?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Announce him.\n\nMORRISON. Thank you, my lady. You won't mind my asking, I hope.\nThe occasion is in a manner of speaking new to me.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Quite right. Go and let him in.\n\nMORRISON. Thank you, my lady. [He withdraws].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Children: go and get ready. [Sarah and Barbara go\nupstairs for their out-of-door wrap]. Charles: go and tell\nStephen to come down here in five minutes: you will find him in\nthe drawing room. [Charles goes]. Adolphus: tell them to send\nround the carriage in about fifteen minutes. [Adolphus goes].\n\nMORRISON [at the door] Mr Undershaft.\n\nUndershaft comes in. Morrison goes out.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Alone! How fortunate!\n\nLADY BRITOMART [rising] Don't be sentimental, Andrew. Sit down.\n[She sits on the settee: he sits beside her, on her left. She\ncomes to the point before he has time to breathe]. Sarah must\nhave 800 pounds a year until Charles Lomax comes into his\nproperty. Barbara will need more, and need it permanently,\nbecause Adolphus hasn't any property.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [resignedly] Yes, my dear: I will see to it. Anything\nelse? for yourself, for instance?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I want to talk to you about Stephen.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [rather wearily] Don't, my dear. Stephen doesn't\ninterest me.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. He does interest me. He is our son.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Do you really think so? He has induced us to bring\nhim into the world; but he chose his parents very incongruously,\nI think. I see nothing of myself in him, and less of you.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew: Stephen is an excellent son, and a most\nsteady, capable, highminded young man. YOU are simply trying to\nfind an excuse for disinheriting him.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My dear Biddy: the Undershaft tradition disinherits\nhim. It would be dishonest of me to leave the cannon foundry to\nmy son.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It would be most unnatural and improper of you to\nleave it to anyone else, Andrew. Do you suppose this wicked and\nimmoral tradition can be kept up for ever? Do you pretend that\nStephen could not carry on the foundry just as well as all the\nother sons of the big business houses?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes: he could learn the office routine without\nunderstanding the business, like all the other sons; and the firm\nwould go on by its own momentum until the real Undershaft--probably\nan Italian or a German--would invent a new method and cut him out.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. There is nothing that any Italian or German could\ndo that Stephen could not do. And Stephen at least has breeding.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. The son of a foundling! nonsense!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. My son, Andrew! And even you may have good blood\nin your veins for all you know.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. True. Probably I have. That is another argument in\nfavor of a foundling.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew: don't be aggravating. And don't be\nwicked. At present you are both.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. This conversation is part of the Undershaft\ntradition, Biddy. Every Undershaft's wife has treated him to it\never since the house was founded. It is mere waste of breath. If\nthe tradition be ever broken it will be for an abler man than\nStephen.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [pouting] Then go away.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [deprecatory] Go away!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes: go away. If you will do nothing for Stephen,\nyou are not wanted here. Go to your foundling, whoever he is; and\nlook after him.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. The fact is, Biddy--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't call me Biddy. I don't call you Andy.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I will not call my wife Britomart: it is not good\nsense. Seriously, my love, the Undershaft tradition has landed me\nin a difficulty. I am getting on in years; and my partner Lazarus\nhas at last made a stand and insisted that the succession must be\nsettled one way or the other; and of course he is quite right.\nYou see, I haven't found a fit successor yet.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [obstinately] There is Stephen.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. That's just it: all the foundlings I can find are\nexactly like Stephen.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew!!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I want a man with no relations and no schooling: that\nis, a man who would be out of the running altogether if he were\nnot a strong man. And I can't find him. Every blessed foundling\nnowadays is snapped up in his infancy by Barnardo homes, or\nSchool Board officers, or Boards of Guardians; and if he shows\nthe least ability, he is fastened on by schoolmasters; trained to\nwin scholarships like a racehorse; crammed with secondhand ideas;\ndrilled and disciplined in docility and what they call good\ntaste; and lamed for life so that he is fit for nothing but\nteaching. If you want to keep the foundry in the family, you had\nbetter find an eligible foundling and marry him to Barbara.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Ah! Barbara! Your pet! You would sacrifice\nStephen to Barbara.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Cheerfully. And you, my dear, would boil Barbara to\nmake soup for Stephen.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew: this is not a question of our likings and\ndislikings: it is a question of duty. It is your duty to make\nStephen your successor.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Just as much as it is your duty to submit to your\nhusband. Come, Biddy! these tricks of the governing class are of\nno use with me. I am one of the governing class myself; and it is\nwaste of time giving tracts to a missionary. I have the power in\nthis matter; and I am not to be humbugged into using it for your\npurposes.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew: you can talk my head off; but you can't\nchange wrong into right. And your tie is all on one side. Put it\nstraight.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [disconcerted] It won't stay unless it's pinned [he\nfumbles at it with childish grimaces]--\n\nStephen comes in.\n\nSTEPHEN [at the door] I beg your pardon [about to retire].\n\nLADY BRITOMART. No: come in, Stephen. [Stephen comes forward to\nhis mother's writing table.]\n\nUNDERSHAFT [not very cordially] Good afternoon.\n\nSTEPHEN [coldly] Good afternoon.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Lady Britomart] He knows all about the tradition,\nI suppose?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes. [To Stephen] It is what I told you last\nnight, Stephen.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [sulkily] I understand you want to come into the\ncannon business.\n\nSTEPHEN. _I_ go into trade! Certainly not.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [opening his eyes, greatly eased in mind and manner]\nOh! in that case--!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Cannons are not trade, Stephen. They are\nenterprise.\n\nSTEPHEN. I have no intention of becoming a man of business in any\nsense. I have no capacity for business and no taste for it. I\nintend to devote myself to politics.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [rising] My dear boy: this is an immense relief to me.\nAnd I trust it may prove an equally good thing for the country. I\nwas afraid you would consider yourself disparaged and slighted.\n[He moves towards Stephen as if to shake hands with him].\n\nLADY BRITOMART [rising and interposing] Stephen: I cannot allow\nyou to throw away an enormous property like this.\n\nSTEPHEN [stiffly] Mother: there must be an end of treating me as\na child, if you please. [Lady Britomart recoils, deeply wounded\nby his tone]. Until last night I did not take your attitude\nseriously, because I did not think you meant it seriously. But I\nfind now that you left me in the dark as to matters which you\nshould have explained to me years ago. I am extremely hurt and\noffended. Any further discussion of my intentions had better take\nplace with my father, as between one man and another.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Stephen! [She sits down again; and her eyes fill\nwith tears].\n\nUNDERSHAFT [with grave compassion] You see, my dear, it is only\nthe big men who can be treated as children.\n\nSTEPHEN. I am sorry, mother, that you have forced me--\n\nUNDERSHAFT [stopping him] Yes, yes, yes, yes: that's all right,\nStephen. She wont interfere with you any more: your independence\nis achieved: you have won your latchkey. Don't rub it in; and\nabove all, don't apologize. [He resumes his seat]. Now what about\nyour future, as between one man and another--I beg your pardon,\nBiddy: as between two men and a woman.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [who has pulled herself together strongly] I quite\nunderstand, Stephen. By all means go your own way if you feel\nstrong enough. [Stephen sits down magisterially in the chair at\nthe writing table with an air of affirming his majority].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. It is settled that you do not ask for the succession\nto the cannon business.\n\nSTEPHEN. I hope it is settled that I repudiate the cannon\nbusiness.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come, come! Don't be so devilishly sulky: it's\nboyish. Freedom should be generous. Besides, I owe you a fair\nstart in life in exchange for disinheriting you. You can't become\nprime minister all at once. Haven't you a turn for something?\nWhat about literature, art and so forth?\n\nSTEPHEN. I have nothing of the artist about me, either in faculty\nor character, thank Heaven!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. A philosopher, perhaps? Eh?\n\nSTEPHEN. I make no such ridiculous pretension.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Just so. Well, there is the army, the navy, the Church,\nthe Bar. The Bar requires some ability. What about the Bar?\n\nSTEPHEN. I have not studied law. And I am afraid I have not the\nnecessary push--I believe that is the name barristers give to\ntheir vulgarity--for success in pleading.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Rather a difficult case, Stephen. Hardly anything\nleft but the stage, is there? [Stephen makes an impatient\nmovement]. Well, come! is there anything you know or care for?\n\nSTEPHEN [rising and looking at him steadily] I know the\ndifference between right and wrong.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [hugely tickled] You don't say so! What! no capacity\nfor business, no knowledge of law, no sympathy with art, no\npretension to philosophy; only a simple knowledge of the secret\nthat has puzzled all the philosophers, baffled all the lawyers,\nmuddled all the men of business, and ruined most of the artists:\nthe secret of right and wrong. Why, man, you're a genius, master\nof masters, a god! At twenty-four, too!\n\nSTEPHEN [keeping his temper with difficulty] You are pleased to\nbe facetious. I pretend to nothing more than any honorable\nEnglish gentleman claims as his birthright [he sits down\nangrily].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Oh, that's everybody's birthright. Look at poor\nlittle Jenny Hill, the Salvation lassie! she would think you were\nlaughing at her if you asked her to stand up in the street and\nteach grammar or geography or mathematics or even drawingroom\ndancing; but it never occurs to her to doubt that she can teach\nmorals and religion. You are all alike, you respectable people.\nYou can't tell me the bursting strain of a ten-inch gun, which is\na very simple matter; but you all think you can tell me the\nbursting strain of a man under temptation. You daren't handle\nhigh explosives; but you're all ready to handle honesty and\ntruth and justice and the whole duty of man, and kill one another\nat that game. What a country! what a world!\n\nLADY BRITOMART [uneasily] What do you think he had better do,\nAndrew?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Oh, just what he wants to do. He knows nothing; and\nhe thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political\ncareer. Get him a private secretaryship to someone who can get\nhim an Under Secretaryship; and then leave him alone. He will\nfind his natural and proper place in the end on the Treasury\nbench.\n\nSTEPHEN [springing up again] I am sorry, sir, that you force\nme to forget the respect due to you as my father. I am an\nEnglishman; and I will not hear the Government of my country\ninsulted. [He thrusts his hands in his pockets, and walks angrily\nacross to the window].\n\nUNDERSHAFT [with a touch of brutality] The government of your\ncountry! _I_ am the government of your country: I, and Lazarus.\nDo you suppose that you and half a dozen amateurs like you,\nsitting in a row in that foolish gabble shop, can govern\nUndershaft and Lazarus? No, my friend: you will do what pays US.\nYou will make war when it suits us, and keep peace when it\ndoesn't. You will find out that trade requires certain measures\nwhen we have decided on those measures. When I want anything to\nkeep my dividends up, you will discover that my want is a\nnational need. When other people want something to keep my\ndividends down, you will call out the police and military. And in\nreturn you shall have the support and applause of my newspapers,\nand the delight of imagining that you are a great statesman.\nGovernment of your country! Be off with you, my boy, and play\nwith your caucuses and leading articles and historic parties and\ngreat leaders and burning questions and the rest of your toys.\n_I_ am going back to my counting house to pay the piper and call\nthe tune.\n\nSTEPHEN [actually smiling, and putting his hand on his father's\nshoulder with indulgent patronage] Really, my dear father, it is\nimpossible to be angry with you. You don't know how absurd all\nthis sounds to ME. You are very properly proud of having been\nindustrious enough to make money; and it is greatly to your\ncredit that you have made so much of it. But it has kept you in\ncircles where you are valued for your money and deferred to for\nit, instead of in the doubtless very oldfashioned and\nbehind-the-times public school and university where I formed my\nhabits of mind. It is natural for you to think that money governs\nEngland; but you must allow me to think I know better.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. And what does govern England, pray?\n\nSTEPHEN. Character, father, character.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Whose character? Yours or mine?\n\nSTEPHEN. Neither yours nor mine, father, but the best elements in\nthe English national character.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Stephen: I've found your profession for you. You're a\nborn journalist. I'll start you with a hightoned weekly review.\nThere!\n\nStephen goes to the smaller writing table and busies himself with\nhis letters.\n\nSarah, Barbara, Lomax, and Cusins come in ready for walking.\nBarbara crosses the room to the window and looks out. Cusins\ndrifts amiably to the armchair, and Lomax remains near the door,\nwhilst Sarah comes to her mother.\n\nSARAH. Go and get ready, mamma: the carriage is waiting. [Lady\nBritomart leaves the room.]\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Sarah] Good day, my dear. Good afternoon, Mr.\nLomax.\n\nLOMAX [vaguely] Ahdedoo.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Cusins] quite well after last night, Euripides,\neh?\n\nCUSINS. As well as can be expected.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. That's right. [To Barbara] So you are coming to see\nmy death and devastation factory, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA [at the window] You came yesterday to see my salvation\nfactory. I promised you a return visit.\n\nLOMAX [coming forward between Sarah and Undershaft] You'll find\nit awfully interesting. I've been through the Woolwich Arsenal;\nand it gives you a ripping feeling of security, you know, to\nthink of the lot of beggars we could kill if it came to fighting.\n[To Undershaft, with sudden solemnity] Still, it must be rather\nan awful reflection for you, from the religious point of view as\nit were. You're getting on, you know, and all that.\n\nSARAH. You don't mind Cholly's imbecility, papa, do you?\n\nLOMAX [much taken aback] Oh I say!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Mr Lomax looks at the matter in a very proper spirit,\nmy dear.\n\nLOMAX. Just so. That's all I meant, I assure you.\n\nSARAH. Are you coming, Stephen?\n\nSTEPHEN. Well, I am rather busy--er-- [Magnanimously] Oh well,\nyes: I'll come. That is, if there is room for me.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I can take two with me in a little motor I am\nexperimenting with for field use. You won't mind its being rather\nunfashionable. It's not painted yet; but it's bullet proof.\n\nLOMAX [appalled at the prospect of confronting Wilton Crescent in\nan unpainted motor] Oh I say!\n\nSARAH. The carriage for me, thank you. Barbara doesn't mind what\nshe's seen in.\n\nLOMAX. I say, Dolly old chap: do you really mind the car being a\nguy? Because of course if you do I'll go in it. Still--\n\nCUSINS. I prefer it.\n\nLOMAX. Thanks awfully, old man. Come, Sarah. [He hurries out to\nsecure his seat in the carriage. Sarah follows him].\n\nCUSINS. [moodily walking across to Lady Britomart's writing table]\nWhy are we two coming to this Works Department of Hell? that is\nwhat I ask myself.\n\nBARBARA. I have always thought of it as a sort of pit where lost\ncreatures with blackened faces stirred up smoky fires and were\ndriven and tormented by my father? Is it like that, dad?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [scandalized] My dear! It is a spotlessly clean and\nbeautiful hillside town.\n\nCUSINS. With a Methodist chapel? Oh do say there's a Methodist\nchapel.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. There are two: a primitive one and a sophisticated\none. There is even an Ethical Society; but it is not much\npatronized, as my men are all strongly religious. In the High\nExplosives Sheds they object to the presence of Agnostics as\nunsafe.\n\nCUSINS. And yet they don't object to you!\n\nBARBARA. Do they obey all your orders?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I never give them any orders. When I speak to one of\nthem it is \"Well, Jones, is the baby doing well? and has Mrs\nJones made a good recovery?\" \"Nicely, thank you, sir.\" And that's\nall.\n\nCUSINS. But Jones has to be kept in order. How do you maintain\ndiscipline among your men?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I don't. They do. You see, the one thing Jones won't\nstand is any rebellion from the man under him, or any assertion\nof social equality between the wife of the man with 4 shillings a\nweek less than himself and Mrs Jones! Of course they all rebel\nagainst me, theoretically. Practically, every man of them keeps\nthe man just below him in his place. I never meddle with them. I\nnever bully them. I don't even bully Lazarus. I say that certain\nthings are to be done; but I don't order anybody to do them. I\ndon't say, mind you, that there is no ordering about and snubbing\nand even bullying. The men snub the boys and order them about;\nthe carmen snub the sweepers; the artisans snub the unskilled\nlaborers; the foremen drive and bully both the laborers and\nartisans; the assistant engineers find fault with the foremen;\nthe chief engineers drop on the assistants; the departmental\nmanagers worry the chiefs; and the clerks have tall hats and\nhymnbooks and keep up the social tone by refusing to associate on\nequal terms with anybody. The result is a colossal profit, which\ncomes to me.\n\nCUSINS [revolted] You really are a--well, what I was saying\nyesterday.\n\nBARBARA. What was he saying yesterday?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Never mind, my dear. He thinks I have made you\nunhappy. Have I?\n\nBARBARA. Do you think I can be happy in this vulgar silly dress?\nI! who have worn the uniform. Do you understand what you have\ndone to me? Yesterday I had a man's soul in my hand. I set him in\nthe way of life with his face to salvation. But when we took your\nmoney he turned back to drunkenness and derision. [With intense\nconviction] I will never forgive you that. If I had a child, and\nyou destroyed its body with your explosives--if you murdered\nDolly with your horrible guns--I could forgive you if my\nforgiveness would open the gates of heaven to you. But to take a\nhuman soul from me, and turn it into the soul of a wolf! that is\nworse than any murder.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Does my daughter despair so easily? Can you strike a\nman to the heart and leave no mark on him?\n\nBARBARA [her face lighting up] Oh, you are right: he can never be\nlost now: where was my faith?\n\nCUSINS. Oh, clever clever devil!\n\nBARBARA. You may be a devil; but God speaks through you\nsometimes. [She takes her father's hands and kisses them]. You\nhave given me back my happiness: I feel it deep down now, though\nmy spirit is troubled.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You have learnt something. That always feels at first\nas if you had lost something.\n\nBARBARA. Well, take me to the factory of death, and let me learn\nsomething more. There must be some truth or other behind all this\nfrightful irony. Come, Dolly. [She goes out].\n\nCUSINS. My guardian angel! [To Undershaft] Avaunt! [He follows\nBarbara].\n\nSTEPHEN [quietly, at the writing table] You must not mind Cusins,\nfather. He is a very amiable good fellow; but he is a Greek\nscholar and naturally a little eccentric.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Ah, quite so. Thank you, Stephen. Thank you. [He goes\nout].\n\nStephen smiles patronizingly; buttons his coat responsibly; and\ncrosses the room to the door. Lady Britomart, dressed for\nout-of-doors, opens it before he reaches it. She looks round far\nthe others; looks at Stephen; and turns to go without a word.\n\nSTEPHEN [embarrassed] Mother--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Don't be apologetic, Stephen. And don't forget\nthat you have outgrown your mother. [She goes out].\n\nPerivale St Andrews lies between two Middlesex hills, half\nclimbing the northern one. It is an almost smokeless town of\nwhite walls, roofs of narrow green slates or red tiles, tall\ntrees, domes, campaniles, and slender chimney shafts, beautifully\nsituated and beautiful in itself. The best view of it is obtained\nfrom the crest of a slope about half a mile to the east, where\nthe high explosives are dealt with. The foundry lies hidden in\nthe depths between, the tops of its chimneys sprouting like huge\nskittles into the middle distance. Across the crest runs a\nplatform of concrete, with a parapet which suggests a\nfortification, because there is a huge cannon of the obsolete\nWoolwich Infant pattern peering across it at the town. The cannon\nis mounted on an experimental gun carriage: possibly the original\nmodel of the Undershaft disappearing rampart gun alluded to by\nStephen. The parapet has a high step inside which serves as a\nseat.\n\nBarbara is leaning over the parapet, looking towards the town. On\nher right is the cannon; on her left the end of a shed raised on\npiles, with a ladder of three or four steps up to the door, which\nopens outwards and has a little wooden landing at the threshold,\nwith a fire bucket in the corner of the landing. The parapet\nstops short of the shed, leaving a gap which is the beginning of\nthe path down the hill through the foundry to the town. Behind\nthe cannon is a trolley carrying a huge conical bombshell, with a\nred band painted on it. Further from the parapet, on the same\nside, is a deck chair, near the door of an office, which, like\nthe sheds, is of the lightest possible construction.\n\nCusins arrives by the path from the town.\n\nBARBARA. Well?\n\nCUSINS. Not a ray of hope. Everything perfect, wonderful, real.\nIt only needs a cathedral to be a heavenly city instead of a\nhellish one.\n\nBARBARA. Have you found out whether they have done anything for\nold Peter Shirley.\n\nCUSINS. They have found him a job as gatekeeper and timekeeper.\nHe's frightfully miserable. He calls the timekeeping brainwork,\nand says he isn't used to it; and his gate lodge is so splendid\nthat he's ashamed to use the rooms, and skulks in the scullery.\n\nBARBARA. Poor Peter!\n\nStephen arrives from the town. He carries a fieldglass.\n\nSTEPHEN [enthusiastically] Have you two seen the place? Why did\nyou leave us?\n\nCUSINS. I wanted to see everything I was not intended to see; and\nBarbara wanted to make the men talk.\n\nSTEPHEN. Have you found anything discreditable?\n\nCUSINS. No. They call him Dandy Andy and are proud of his being a\ncunning old rascal; but it's all horribly, frightfully,\nimmorally, unanswerably perfect.\n\nSarah arrives.\n\nSARAH. Heavens! what a place! [She crosses to the trolley]. Did\nyou see the nursing home!? [She sits down on the shell].\n\nSTEPHEN. Did you see the libraries and schools!?\n\nSARAH. Did you see the ballroom and the banqueting chamber in the\nTown Hall!?\n\nSTEPHEN. Have you gone into the insurance fund, the pension fund,\nthe building society, the various applications of co-operation!?\n\nUndershaft comes from the office, with a sheaf of telegrams in\nhis hands.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well, have you seen everything? I'm sorry I was\ncalled away. [Indicating the telegrams] News from Manchuria.\n\nSTEPHEN. Good news, I hope.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Very.\n\nSTEPHEN. Another Japanese victory?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Oh, I don't know. Which side wins does not concern us\nhere. No: the good news is that the aerial battleship is a\ntremendous success. At the first trial it has wiped out a fort\nwith three hundred soldiers in it.\n\nCUSINS [from the platform] Dummy soldiers?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. No: the real thing. [Cusins and Barbara exchange\nglances. Then Cusins sits on the step and buries his face in his\nhands. Barbara gravely lays her hand on his shoulder, and he\nlooks up at her in a sort of whimsical desperation]. Well,\nStephen, what do you think of the place?\n\nSTEPHEN. Oh, magnificent. A perfect triumph of organization.\nFrankly, my dear father, I have been a fool: I had no idea of\nwhat it all meant--of the wonderful forethought, the power of\norganization, the administrative capacity, the financial genius,\nthe colossal capital it represents. I have been repeating to\nmyself as I came through your streets \"Peace hath her victories\nno less renowned than War.\" I have only one misgiving about it\nall.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Out with it.\n\nSTEPHEN. Well, I cannot help thinking that all this provision for\nevery want of your workmen may sap their independence and weaken\ntheir sense of responsibility. And greatly as we enjoyed our tea\nat that splendid restaurant--how they gave us all that luxury and\ncake and jam and cream for threepence I really cannot imagine!--still\nyou must remember that restaurants break up home life. Look at the\ncontinent, for instance! Are you sure so much pampering is really\ngood for the men's characters?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well you see, my dear boy, when you are organizing\ncivilization you have to make up your mind whether trouble and\nanxiety are good things or not. If you decide that they are,\nthen, I take it, you simply don't organize civilization; and\nthere you are, with trouble and anxiety enough to make us all\nangels! But if you decide the other way, you may as well go\nthrough with it. However, Stephen, our characters are safe here.\nA sufficient dose of anxiety is always provided by the fact that\nwe may be blown to smithereens at any moment.\n\nSARAH. By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. In separate little sheds, like that one. When one of\nthem blows up, it costs very little; and only the people quite\nclose to it are killed.\n\nStephen, who is quite close to it, looks at it rather scaredly,\nand moves away quickly to the cannon. At the same moment the door\nof the shed is thrown abruptly open; and a foreman in overalls\nand list slippers comes out on the little landing and holds the\ndoor open for Lomax, who appears in the doorway.\n\nLOMAX [with studied coolness] My good fellow: you needn't get\ninto a state of nerves. Nothing's going to happen to you; and I\nsuppose it wouldn't be the end of the world if anything did. A\nlittle bit of British pluck is what you want, old chap. [He\ndescends and strolls across to Sarah].\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to the foreman] Anything wrong, Bilton?\n\nBILTON [with ironic calm] Gentleman walked into the high\nexplosives shed and lit a cigaret, sir: that's all.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Ah, quite so. [To Lomax] Do you happen to remember\nwhat you did with the match?\n\nLOMAX. Oh come! I'm not a fool. I took jolly good care to blow it\nout before I chucked it away.\n\nBILTON. The top of it was red hot inside, sir.\n\nLOMAX. Well, suppose it was! I didn't chuck it into any of your\nmesses.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Think no more of it, Mr Lomax. By the way, would you\nmind lending me your matches?\n\nLOMAX [offering his box] Certainly.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Thanks. [He pockets the matches].\n\nLOMAX [lecturing to the company generally] You know, these high\nexplosives don't go off like gunpowder, except when they're in a\ngun. When they're spread loose, you can put a match to them\nwithout the least risk: they just burn quietly like a bit of\npaper. [Warming to the scientific interest of the subject] Did\nyou know that Undershaft? Have you ever tried?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Not on a large scale, Mr Lomax. Bilton will give you\na sample of gun cotton when you are leaving if you ask him. You\ncan experiment with it at home. [Bilton looks puzzled].\n\nSARAH. Bilton will do nothing of the sort, papa. I suppose it's\nyour business to blow up the Russians and Japs; but you might\nreally stop short of blowing up poor Cholly. [Bilton gives it up\nand retires into the shed].\n\nLOMAX. My ownest, there is no danger. [He sits beside her on the\nshell].\n\nLady Britomart arrives from the town with a bouquet.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [coming impetuously between Undershaft and the\ndeck chair] Andrew: you shouldn't have let me see this place.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Why, my dear?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Never mind why: you shouldn't have: that's all.\nTo think of all that [indicating the town] being yours! and that\nyou have kept it to yourself all these years!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. It does not belong to me. I belong to it. It is the\nUndershaft inheritance.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It is not. Your ridiculous cannons and that noisy\nbanging foundry may be the Undershaft inheritance; but all that\nplate and linen, all that furniture and those houses and orchards\nand gardens belong to us. They belong to me: they are not a man's\nbusiness. I won't give them up. You must be out of your senses to\nthrow them all away; and if you persist in such folly, I will\ncall in a doctor.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [stooping to smell the bouquet] Where did you get the\nflowers, my dear?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Your men presented them to me in your William\nMorris Labor Church.\n\nCUSINS [springing up] Oh! It needed only that. A Labor Church!\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Yes, with Morris's words in mosaic letters ten\nfeet high round the dome. NO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ANOTHER\nMAN'S MASTER. The cynicism of it!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. It shocked the men at first, I am afraid. But now\nthey take no more notice of it than of the ten commandments in\nchurch.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Andrew: you are trying to put me off the subject\nof the inheritance by profane jokes. Well, you shan't. I don't\nask it any longer for Stephen: he has inherited far too much of\nyour perversity to be fit for it. But Barbara has rights as well\nas Stephen. Why should not Adolphus succeed to the inheritance? I\ncould manage the town for him; and he can look after the cannons,\nif they are really necessary.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I should ask nothing better if Adolphus were a\nfoundling. He is exactly the sort of new blood that is wanted in\nEnglish business. But he's not a foundling; and there's an end of\nit.\n\nCUSINS [diplomatically] Not quite. [They all turn and stare at\nhim. He comes from the platform past the shed to Undershaft]. I\nthink--Mind! I am not committing myself in any way as to my\nfuture course--but I think the foundling difficulty can be got\nover.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. What do you mean?\n\nCUSINS. Well, I have something to say which is in the nature of a\nconfession.\n\n  SARAH.             }\n  LADY BRITOMART.    } Confession!\n  BARBARA.           }\n  STEPHEN.           }\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say!\n\nCUSINS. Yes, a confession. Listen, all. Until I met Barbara I\nthought myself in the main an honorable, truthful man, because I\nwanted the approval of my conscience more than I wanted anything\nelse. But the moment I saw Barbara, I wanted her far more than\nthe approval of my conscience.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Adolphus!\n\nCUSINS. It is true. You accused me yourself, Lady Brit, of\njoining the Army to worship Barbara; and so I did. She bought my\nsoul like a flower at a street corner; but she bought it for\nherself.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. What! Not for Dionysos or another?\n\nCUSINS. Dionysos and all the others are in herself. I adored what\nwas divine in her, and was therefore a true worshipper. But I was\nromantic about her too. I thought she was a woman of the people,\nand that a marriage with a professor of Greek would be far beyond\nthe wildest social ambitions of her rank.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Adolphus!!\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say!!!\n\nCUSINS. When I learnt the horrible truth--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. What do you mean by the horrible truth, pray?\n\nCUSINS. That she was enormously rich; that her grandfather was an\nearl; that her father was the Prince of Darkness--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Chut!\n\nCUSINS.--and that I was only an adventurer trying to catch a rich\nwife, then I stooped to deceive about my birth.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Your birth! Now Adolphus, don't dare to make up a\nwicked story for the sake of these wretched cannons. Remember: I\nhave seen photographs of your parents; and the Agent General for\nSouth Western Australia knows them personally and has assured me\nthat they are most respectable married people.\n\nCUSINS. So they are in Australia; but here they are outcasts.\nTheir marriage is legal in Australia, but not in England. My\nmother is my father's deceased wife's sister; and in this island\nI am consequently a foundling. [Sensation]. Is the subterfuge\ngood enough, Machiavelli?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [thoughtfully] Biddy: this may be a way out of the\ndifficulty.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Stuff! A man can't make cannons any the better\nfor being his own cousin instead of his proper self [she sits\ndown in the deck chair with a bounce that expresses her downright\ncontempt for their casuistry.]\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Cusins] You are an educated man. That is against\nthe tradition.\n\nCUSINS. Once in ten thousand times it happens that the schoolboy\nis a born master of what they try to teach him. Greek has not\ndestroyed my mind: it has nourished it. Besides, I did not learn\nit at an English public school.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Hm! Well, I cannot afford to be too particular: you\nhave cornered the foundling market. Let it pass. You are\neligible, Euripides: you are eligible.\n\nBARBARA [coming from the platform and interposing between Cusins\nand Undershaft] Dolly: yesterday morning, when Stephen told us\nall about the tradition, you became very silent; and you have\nbeen strange and excited ever since. Were you thinking of your\nbirth then?\n\nCUSINS. When the finger of Destiny suddenly points at a man in\nthe middle of his breakfast, it makes him thoughtful. [Barbara\nturns away sadly and stands near her mother, listening perturbedly].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Aha! You have had your eye on the business, my young\nfriend, have you?\n\nCUSINS. Take care! There is an abyss of moral horror between me\nand your accursed aerial battleships.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Never mind the abyss for the present. Let us settle\nthe practical details and leave your final decision open. You\nknow that you will have to change your name. Do you object to\nthat?\n\nCUSINS. Would any man named Adolphus--any man called Dolly!--object\nto be called something else?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Good. Now, as to money! I propose to treat you\nhandsomely from the beginning. You shall start at a thousand a\nyear.\n\nCUSINS. [with sudden heat, his spectacles twinkling with\nmischief] A thousand! You dare offer a miserable thousand to\nthe son-in-law of a millionaire! No, by Heavens, Machiavelli! you\nshall not cheat me. You cannot do without me; and I can do\nwithout you. I must have two thousand five hundred a year for two\nyears. At the end of that time, if I am a failure, I go. But if I\nam a success, and stay on, you must give me the other five\nthousand.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. What other five thousand?\n\nCUSINS. To make the two years up to five thousand a year. The two\nthousand five hundred is only half pay in case I should turn out\na failure. The third year I must have ten per cent on the\nprofits.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [taken aback] Ten per cent! Why, man, do you know what\nmy profits are?\n\nCUSINS. Enormous, I hope: otherwise I shall require twenty-five\nper cent.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. But, Mr Cusins, this is a serious matter of business.\nYou are not bringing any capital into the concern.\n\nCUSINS. What! no capital! Is my mastery of Greek no capital? Is\nmy access to the subtlest thought, the loftiest poetry yet\nattained by humanity, no capital? my character! my intellect! my\nlife! my career! what Barbara calls my soul! are these no\ncapital? Say another word; and I double my salary.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Be reasonable--\n\nCUSINS [peremptorily] Mr Undershaft: you have my terms. Take them\nor leave them.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [recovering himself] Very well. I note your terms; and\nI offer you half.\n\nCUSINS [disgusted] Half!\n\nUNDERSHAFT [firmly] Half.\n\nCUSINS. You call yourself a gentleman; and you offer me half!!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I do not call myself a gentleman; but I offer you\nhalf.\n\nCUSINS. This to your future partner! your successor! your\nson-in-law!\n\nBARBARA. You are selling your own soul, Dolly, not mine. Leave me\nout of the bargain, please.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come! I will go a step further for Barbara's sake. I\nwill give you three fifths; but that is my last word.\n\nCUSINS. Done!\n\nLOMAX. Done in the eye. Why, _I_ only get eight hundred, you\nknow.\n\nCUSINS. By the way, Mac, I am a classical scholar, not an\narithmetical one. Is three fifths more than half or less?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. More, of course.\n\nCUSINS. I would have taken two hundred and fifty. How you can\nsucceed in business when you are willing to pay all that money to\na University don who is obviously not worth a junior clerk's\nwages!--well! What will Lazarus say?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Lazarus is a gentle romantic Jew who cares for\nnothing but string quartets and stalls at fashionable theatres.\nHe will get the credit of your rapacity in money matters, as he\nhas hitherto had the credit of mine. You are a shark of the first\norder, Euripides. So much the better for the firm!\n\nBARBARA. Is the bargain closed, Dolly? Does your soul belong to\nhim now?\n\nCUSINS. No: the price is settled: that is all. The real tug of\nwar is still to come. What about the moral question?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. There is no moral question in the matter at all,\nAdolphus. You must simply sell cannons and weapons to people\nwhose cause is right and just, and refuse them to foreigners and\ncriminals.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [determinedly] No: none of that. You must keep the\ntrue faith of an Armorer, or you don't come in here.\n\nCUSINS. What on earth is the true faith of an Armorer?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. To give arms to all men who offer an honest price for\nthem, without respect of persons or principles: to aristocrat and\nrepublican, to Nihilist and Tsar, to Capitalist and Socialist, to\nProtestant and Catholic, to burglar and policeman, to black man\nwhite man and yellow man, to all sorts and conditions, all\nnationalities, all faiths, all follies, all causes and all\ncrimes. The first Undershaft wrote up in his shop IF GOD GAVE THE\nHAND, LET NOT MAN WITHHOLD THE SWORD. The second wrote up ALL\nHAVE THE RIGHT TO FIGHT: NONE HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE. The third\nwrote up TO MAN THE WEAPON: TO HEAVEN THE VICTORY. The fourth had\nno literary turn; so he did not write up anything; but he sold\ncannons to Napoleon under the nose of George the Third. The fifth\nwrote up PEACE SHALL NOT PREVAIL SAVE WITH A SWORD IN HER HAND.\nThe sixth, my master, was the best of all. He wrote up NOTHING IS\nEVER DONE IN THIS WORLD UNTIL MEN ARE PREPARED TO KILL ONE\nANOTHER IF IT IS NOT DONE. After that, there was nothing left for\nthe seventh to say. So he wrote up, simply, UNASHAMED.\n\nCUSINS. My good Machiavelli, I shall certainly write something up\non the wall; only, as I shall write it in Greek, you won't be\nable to read it. But as to your Armorer's faith, if I take my\nneck out of the noose of my own morality I am not going to put it\ninto the noose of yours. I shall sell cannons to whom I please\nand refuse them to whom I please. So there!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. From the moment when you become Andrew Undershaft,\nyou will never do as you please again. Don't come here lusting\nfor power, young man.\n\nCUSINS. If power were my aim I should not come here for it.\nYOU have no power.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. None of my own, certainly.\n\nCUSINS. I have more power than you, more will. You do not drive\nthis place: it drives you. And what drives the place?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [enigmatically] A will of which I am a part.\n\nBARBARA [startled] Father! Do you know what you are saying; or\nare you laying a snare for my soul?\n\nCUSINS. Don't listen to his metaphysics, Barbara. The place is\ndriven by the most rascally part of society, the money hunters,\nthe pleasure hunters, the military promotion hunters; and he is\ntheir slave.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Not necessarily. Remember the Armorer's Faith. I will\ntake an order from a good man as cheerfully as from a bad one. If\nyou good people prefer preaching and shirking to buying my\nweapons and fighting the rascals, don't blame me. I can make\ncannons: I cannot make courage and conviction. Bah! You tire me,\nEuripides, with your morality mongering. Ask Barbara: SHE\nunderstands. [He suddenly takes Barbara's hands, and looks\npowerfully into her eyes]. Tell him, my love, what power really\nmeans.\n\nBARBARA [hypnotized] Before I joined the Salvation Army, I was in\nmy own power; and the consequence was that I never knew what to\ndo with myself. When I joined it, I had not time enough for all\nthe things I had to do.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [approvingly] Just so. And why was that, do you\nsuppose?\n\nBARBARA. Yesterday I should have said, because I was in the power\nof God. [She resumes her self-possession, withdrawing her hands\nfrom his with a power equal to his own]. But you came and showed\nme that I was in the power of Bodger and Undershaft. Today I\nfeel--oh! how can I put it into words? Sarah: do you remember the\nearthquake at Cannes, when we were little children?--how little\nthe surprise of the first shock mattered compared to the dread\nand horror of waiting for the second? That is how I feel in this\nplace today. I stood on the rock I thought eternal; and without\na word of warning it reeled and crumbled under me. I was safe\nwith an infinite wisdom watching me, an army marching to\nSalvation with me; and in a moment, at a stroke of your pen in a\ncheque book, I stood alone; and the heavens were empty. That was\nthe first shock of the earthquake: I am waiting for the second.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come, come, my daughter! Don't make too much of your\nlittle tinpot tragedy. What do we do here when we spend years of\nwork and thought and thousands of pounds of solid cash on a new\ngun or an aerial battleship that turns out just a hairsbreadth\nwrong after all? Scrap it. Scrap it without wasting another hour\nor another pound on it. Well, you have made for yourself\nsomething that you call a morality or a religion or what not. It\ndoesn't fit the facts. Well, scrap it. Scrap it and get one that\ndoes fit. That is what is wrong with the world at present. It\nscraps its obsolete steam engines and dynamos; but it won't scrap\nits old prejudices and its old moralities and its old religions\nand its old political constitutions. What's the result? In\nmachinery it does very well; but in morals and religion and\npolitics it is working at a loss that brings it nearer bankruptcy\nevery year. Don't persist in that folly. If your old religion\nbroke down yesterday, get a newer and a better one for tomorrow.\n\nBARBARA. Oh how gladly I would take a better one to my soul! But\nyou offer me a worse one. [Turning on him with sudden vehemence].\nJustify yourself: show me some light through the darkness of this\ndreadful place, with its beautifully clean workshops, and\nrespectable workmen, and model homes.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Cleanliness and respectability do not need\njustification, Barbara: they justify themselves. I see no\ndarkness here, no dreadfulness. In your Salvation shelter I saw\npoverty, misery, cold and hunger. You gave them bread and treacle\nand dreams of heaven. I give from thirty shillings a week to\ntwelve thousand a year. They find their own dreams; but I look\nafter the drainage.\n\nBARBARA. And their souls?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I save their souls just as I saved yours.\n\nBARBARA [revolted] You saved my soul! What do you mean?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I fed you and clothed you and housed you. I took care\nthat you should have money enough to live handsomely--more than\nenough; so that you could be wasteful, careless, generous. That\nsaved your soul from the seven deadly sins.\n\nBARBARA [bewildered] The seven deadly sins!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Yes, the deadly seven. [Counting on his fingers]\nFood, clothing, firing, rent, taxes, respectability and children.\nNothing can lift those seven millstones from Man's neck but\nmoney; and the spirit cannot soar until the millstones are\nlifted. I lifted them from your spirit. I enabled Barbara to\nbecome Major Barbara; and I saved her from the crime of poverty.\n\nCUSINS. Do you call poverty a crime?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. The worst of crimes. All the other crimes are virtues\nbeside it: all the other dishonors are chivalry itself by\ncomparison. Poverty blights whole cities; spreads horrible\npestilences; strikes dead the very souls of all who come within\nsight, sound or smell of it. What you call crime is nothing: a\nmurder here and a theft there, a blow now and a curse then: what\ndo they matter? they are only the accidents and illnesses of\nlife: there are not fifty genuine professional criminals in\nLondon. But there are millions of poor people, abject people,\ndirty people, ill fed, ill clothed people. They poison us morally\nand physically: they kill the happiness of society: they force us\nto do away with our own liberties and to organize unnatural\ncruelties for fear they should rise against us and drag us down\ninto their abyss. Only fools fear crime: we all fear poverty.\nPah! [turning on Barbara] you talk of your half-saved ruffian in\nWest Ham: you accuse me of dragging his soul back to perdition.\nWell, bring him to me here; and I will drag his soul back again\nto salvation for you. Not by words and dreams; but by thirty-eight\nshillings a week, a sound house in a handsome street, and a permanent\njob. In three weeks he will have a fancy waistcoat; in three months\na tall hat and a chapel sitting; before the end of the year he\nwill shake hands with a duchess at a Primrose League meeting, and\njoin the Conservative Party.\n\nBARBARA. And will he be the better for that?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You know he will. Don't be a hypocrite, Barbara. He\nwill be better fed, better housed, better clothed, better\nbehaved; and his children will be pounds heavier and bigger. That\nwill be better than an American cloth mattress in a shelter,\nchopping firewood, eating bread and treacle, and being forced to\nkneel down from time to time to thank heaven for it: knee drill,\nI think you call it. It is cheap work converting starving men\nwith a Bible in one hand and a slice of bread in the other. I\nwill undertake to convert West Ham to Mahometanism on the same\nterms. Try your hand on my men: their souls are hungry because\ntheir bodies are full.\n\nBARBARA. And leave the east end to starve?\n\nUNDERSHAFT [his energetic tone dropping into one of bitter and\nbrooding remembrance] I was an east ender. I moralized and\nstarved until one day I swore that I would be a fullfed free man\nat all costs--that nothing should stop me except a bullet,\nneither reason nor morals nor the lives of other men. I said\n\"Thou shalt starve ere I starve\"; and with that word I became\nfree and great. I was a dangerous man until I had my will: now I\nam a useful, beneficent, kindly person. That is the history of\nmost self-made millionaires, I fancy. When it is the history of\nevery Englishman we shall have an England worth living in.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Stop making speeches, Andrew. This is not the\nplace for them.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [punctured] My dear: I have no other means of\nconveying my ideas.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Your ideas are nonsense. You got oil because you\nwere selfish and unscrupulous.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Not at all. I had the strongest scruples about\npoverty and starvation. Your moralists are quite unscrupulous\nabout both: they make virtues of them. I had rather be a thief\nthan a pauper. I had rather be a murderer than a slave. I don't\nwant to be either; but if you force the alternative on me, then,\nby Heaven, I'll choose the braver and more moral one. I hate\npoverty and slavery worse than any other crimes whatsoever. And\nlet me tell you this. Poverty and slavery have stood up for\ncenturies to your sermons and leading articles: they will not\nstand up to my machine guns. Don't preach at them: don't reason\nwith them. Kill them.\n\nBARBARA. Killing. Is that your remedy for everything?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. It is the final test of conviction, the only lever\nstrong enough to overturn a social system, the only way of saying\nMust. Let six hundred and seventy fools loose in the street; and\nthree policemen can scatter them. But huddle them together in a\ncertain house in Westminster; and let them go through certain\nceremonies and call themselves certain names until at last they\nget the courage to kill; and your six hundred and seventy fools\nbecome a government. Your pious mob fills up ballot papers and\nimagines it is governing its masters; but the ballot paper that\nreally governs is the paper that has a bullet wrapped up in it.\n\nCUSINS. That is perhaps why, like most intelligent people, I\nnever vote.\n\nUNDERSHAFT Vote! Bah! When you vote, you only change the names of\nthe cabinet. When you shoot, you pull down governments,\ninaugurate new epochs, abolish old orders and set up new. Is that\nhistorically true, Mr Learned Man, or is it not?\n\nCUSINS. It is historically true. I loathe having to admit it. I\nrepudiate your sentiments. I abhor your nature. I defy you in\nevery possible way. Still, it is true. But it ought not to be\ntrue.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Ought, ought, ought, ought, ought! Are you going to\nspend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?\nTurn your oughts into shalls, man. Come and make explosives with\nme. Whatever can blow men up can blow society up. The history of\nthe world is the history of those who had courage enough to\nembrace this truth. Have you the courage to embrace it, Barbara?\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Barbara, I positively forbid you to listen to\nyour father's abominable wickedness. And you, Adolphus, ought to\nknow better than to go about saying that wrong things are true.\nWhat does it matter whether they are true if they are wrong?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. What does it matter whether they are wrong if they\nare true?\n\nLADY BRITOMART [rising] Children: come home instantly. Andrew: I\nam exceedingly sorry I allowed you to call on us. You are\nwickeder than ever. Come at once.\n\nBARBARA [shaking her head] It's no use running away from wicked\npeople, mamma.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. It is every use. It shows your disapprobation of\nthem.\n\nBARBARA. It does not save them.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. I can see that you are going to disobey me.\nSarah: are you coming home or are you not?\n\nSARAH. I daresay it's very wicked of papa to make cannons; but I\ndon't think I shall cut him on that account.\n\nLOMAX [pouring oil on the troubled waters] The fact is, you know,\nthere is a certain amount of tosh about this notion of wickedness.\nIt doesn't work. You must look at facts. Not that I would say a\nword in favor of anything wrong; but then, you see, all sorts of\nchaps are always doing all sorts of things; and we have to fit\nthem in somehow, don't you know. What I mean is that you can't\ngo cutting everybody; and that's about what it comes to. [Their\nrapt attention to his eloquence makes him nervous] Perhaps I\ndon't make myself clear.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. You are lucidity itself, Charles. Because Andrew\nis successful and has plenty of money to give to Sarah, you will\nflatter him and encourage him in his wickedness.\n\nLOMAX [unruffled] Well, where the carcase is, there will the\neagles be gathered, don't you know. [To Undershaft] Eh? What?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Precisely. By the way, may I call you Charles?\n\nLOMAX. Delighted. Cholly is the usual ticket.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [to Lady Britomart] Biddy--\n\nLADY BRITOMART [violently] Don't dare call me Biddy. Charles\nLomax: you are a fool. Adolphus Cusins: you are a Jesuit.\nStephen: you are a prig. Barbara: you are a lunatic. Andrew: you\nare a vulgar tradesman. Now you all know my opinion; and my\nconscience is clear, at all events [she sits down again with a\nvehemence that almost wrecks the chair].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My dear, you are the incarnation of morality. [She\nsnorts]. Your conscience is clear and your duty done when you\nhave called everybody names. Come, Euripides! it is getting late;\nand we all want to get home. Make up your mind.\n\nCUSINS. Understand this, you old demon--\n\nLADY BRITOMART. Adolphus!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Let him alone, Biddy. Proceed, Euripides.\n\nCUSINS. You have me in a horrible dilemma. I want Barbara.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Like all young men, you greatly exaggerate the\ndifference between one young woman and another.\n\nBARBARA. Quite true, Dolly.\n\nCUSINS. I also want to avoid being a rascal.\n\nUNDERSHAFT [with biting contempt] You lust for personal\nrighteousness, for self-approval, for what you call a good\nconscience, for what Barbara calls salvation, for what I call\npatronizing people who are not so lucky as yourself.\n\nCUSINS. I do not: all the poet in me recoils from being a good\nman. But there are things in me that I must reckon with: pity--\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Pity! The scavenger of misery.\n\nCUSINS. Well, love.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I know. You love the needy and the outcast: you love\nthe oppressed races, the negro, the Indian ryot, the Pole, the\nIrishman. Do you love the Japanese? Do you love the Germans? Do\nyou love the English?\n\nCUSINS. No. Every true Englishman detests the English. We are the\nwickedest nation on earth; and our success is a moral horror.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?\n\nCUSINS. May I not love even my father-in-law?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Who wants your love, man? By what right do you take\nthe liberty of offering it to me? I will have your due heed and\nrespect, or I will kill you. But your love! Damn your impertinence!\n\nCUSINS [grinning] I may not be able to control my affections, Mac.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. You are fencing, Euripides. You are weakening: your\ngrip is slipping. Come! try your last weapon. Pity and love have\nbroken in your hand: forgiveness is still left.\n\nCUSINS. No: forgiveness is a beggar's refuge. I am with you\nthere: we must pay our debts.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Well said. Come! you will suit me. Remember the words\nof Plato.\n\nCUSINS [starting] Plato! You dare quote Plato to me!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Plato says, my friend, that society cannot be saved\nuntil either the Professors of Greek take to making gunpowder, or\nelse the makers of gunpowder become Professors of Greek.\n\nCUSINS. Oh, tempter, cunning tempter!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come! choose, man, choose.\n\nCUSINS. But perhaps Barbara will not marry me if I make the wrong\nchoice.\n\nBARBARA. Perhaps not.\n\nCUSINS [desperately perplexed] You hear--\n\nBARBARA. Father: do you love nobody?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. I love my best friend.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. And who is that, pray?\n\nUNDERSHAFT. My bravest enemy. That is the man who keeps me up to\nthe mark.\n\nCUSINS. You know, the creature is really a sort of poet in his\nway. Suppose he is a great man, after all!\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Suppose you stop talking and make up your mind, my\nyoung friend.\n\nCUSINS. But you are driving me against my nature. I hate war.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Hatred is the coward's revenge for being intimidated.\nDare you make war on war? Here are the means: my friend Mr Lomax\nis sitting on them.\n\nLOMAX [springing up] Oh I say! You don't mean that this thing is\nloaded, do you? My ownest: come off it.\n\nSARAH [sitting placidly on the shell] If I am to be blown up, the\nmore thoroughly it is done the better. Don't fuss, Cholly.\n\nLOMAX [to Undershaft, strongly remonstrant] Your own daughter,\nyou know.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. So I see. [To Cusins] Well, my friend, may we expect\nyou here at six tomorrow morning?\n\nCUSINS [firmly] Not on any account. I will see the whole\nestablishment blown up with its own dynamite before I will get up\nat five. My hours are healthy, rational hours eleven to five.\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Come when you please: before a week you will come at\nsix and stay until I turn you out for the sake of your health.\n[Calling] Bilton! [He turns to Lady Britomart, who rises]. My\ndear: let us leave these two young people to themselves for a\nmoment. [Bilton comes from the shed]. I am going to take you\nthrough the gun cotton shed.\n\nBILTON [barring the way] You can't take anything explosive in\nhere, Sir.\n\nLADY BRITOMART. What do you mean? Are you alluding to me?\n\nBILTON [unmoved] No, ma'am. Mr Undershaft has the other\ngentleman's matches in his pocket.\n\nLADY BRITOMART [abruptly] Oh! I beg your pardon. [She goes into\nthe shed].\n\nUNDERSHAFT. Quite right, Bilton, quite right: here you are. [He\ngives Bilton the box of matches]. Come, Stephen. Come, Charles.\nBring Sarah. [He passes into the shed].\n\nBilton opens the box and deliberately drops the matches into the\nfire-bucket.\n\nLOMAX. Oh I say! [Bilton stolidly hands him the empty box].\nInfernal nonsense! Pure scientific ignorance! [He goes in].\n\nSARAH. Am I all right, Bilton?\n\nBILTON. You'll have to put on list slippers, miss: that's all.\nWe've got em inside. [She goes in].\n\nSTEPHEN [very seriously to Cusins] Dolly, old fellow, think.\nThink before you decide. Do you feel that you are a sufficiently\npractical man? It is a huge undertaking, an enormous responsibility.\nAll this mass of business will be Greek to you.\n\nCUSINS. Oh, I think it will be much less difficult than Greek.\n\nSTEPHEN. Well, I just want to say this before I leave you to\nyourselves. Don't let anything I have said about right and wrong\nprejudice you against this great chance in life. I have satisfied\nmyself that the business is one of the highest character and a\ncredit to our country. [Emotionally] I am very proud of my\nfather. I-- [Unable to proceed, he presses Cusins' hand and goes\nhastily into the shed, followed by Bilton].\n\nBarbara and Cusins, left alone together, look at one another\nsilently.\n\nCUSINS. Barbara: I am going to accept this offer.\n\nBARBARA. I thought you would.\n\nCUSINS. You understand, don't you, that I had to decide without\nconsulting you. If I had thrown the burden of the choice on you,\nyou would sooner or later have despised me for it.\n\nBARBARA. Yes: I did not want you to sell your soul for me any\nmore than for this inheritance.\n\nCUSINS. It is not the sale of my soul that troubles me: I have\nsold it too often to care about that. I have sold it for a\nprofessorship. I have sold it for an income. I have sold it to\nescape being imprisoned for refusing to pay taxes for hangmen's\nropes and unjust wars and things that I abhor. What is all human\nconduct but the daily and hourly sale of our souls for trifles?\nWhat I am now selling it for is neither money nor position nor\ncomfort, but for reality and for power.\n\nBARBARA. You know that you will have no power, and that he has\nnone.\n\nCUSINS. I know. It is not for myself alone. I want to make power\nfor the world.\n\nBARBARA. I want to make power for the world too; but it must be\nspiritual power.\n\nCUSINS. I think all power is spiritual: these cannons will not go\noff by themselves. I have tried to make spiritual power by\nteaching Greek. But the world can never be really touched by a\ndead language and a dead civilization. The people must have\npower; and the people cannot have Greek. Now the power that is\nmade here can be wielded by all men.\n\nBARBARA. Power to burn women's houses down and kill their sons\nand tear their husbands to pieces.\n\nCUSINS. You cannot have power for good without having power for\nevil too. Even mother's milk nourishes murderers as well as\nheroes. This power which only tears men's bodies to pieces has\nnever been so horribly abused as the intellectual power, the\nimaginative power, the poetic, religious power that can enslave\nmen's souls. As a teacher of Greek I gave the intellectual man\nweapons against the common man. I now want to give the common man\nweapons against the intellectual man. I love the common people. I\nwant to arm them against the lawyer, the doctor, the priest, the\nliterary man, the professor, the artist, and the politician, who,\nonce in authority, are the most dangerous, disastrous, and\ntyrannical of all the fools, rascals, and impostors. I want a\ndemocratic power strong enough to force the intellectual\noligarchy to use its genius for the general good or else perish.\n\nBARBARA. Is there no higher power than that [pointing to the\nshell]?\n\nCUSINS. Yes: but that power can destroy the higher powers just as\na tiger can destroy a man: therefore man must master that power\nfirst. I admitted this when the Turks and Greeks were last at\nwar. My best pupil went out to fight for Hellas. My parting gift\nto him was not a copy of Plato's Republic, but a revolver and a\nhundred Undershaft cartridges. The blood of every Turk he shot--if\nhe shot any--is on my head as well as on Undershaft's. That act\ncommitted me to this place for ever. Your father's challenge has\nbeaten me. Dare I make war on war? I dare. I must. I will. And\nnow, is it all over between us?\n\nBARBARA [touched by his evident dread of her answer] Silly baby\nDolly! How could it be?\n\nCUSINS [overjoyed] Then you--you--you-- Oh for my drum! [He\nflourishes imaginary drumsticks].\n\nBARBARA [angered by his levity] Take care, Dolly, take care. Oh,\nif only I could get away from you and from father and from it\nall! if I could have the wings of a dove and fly away to heaven!\n\nCUSINS. And leave me!\n\nBARBARA. Yes, you, and all the other naughty mischievous children\nof men. But I can't. I was happy in the Salvation Army for a\nmoment. I escaped from the world into a paradise of enthusiasm\nand prayer and soul saving; but the moment our money ran short,\nit all came back to Bodger: it was he who saved our people: he,\nand the Prince of Darkness, my papa. Undershaft and Bodger: their\nhands stretch everywhere: when we feed a starving fellow\ncreature, it is with their bread, because there is no other\nbread; when we tend the sick, it is in the hospitals they endow;\nif we turn from the churches they build, we must kneel on the\nstones of the streets they pave. As long as that lasts, there is\nno getting away from them. Turning our backs on Bodger and\nUndershaft is turning our backs on life.\n\nCUSINS. I thought you were determined to turn your back on the\nwicked side of life.\n\nBARBARA. There is no wicked side: life is all one. And I never\nwanted to shirk my share in whatever evil must be endured,\nwhether it be sin or suffering. I wish I could cure you of\nmiddle-class ideas, Dolly.\n\nCUSINS [gasping] Middle cl--! A snub! A social snub to ME! from\nthe daughter of a foundling!\n\nBARBARA. That is why I have no class, Dolly: I come straight out\nof the heart of the whole people. If I were middle-class I should\nturn my back on my father's business; and we should both live in\nan artistic drawingroom, with you reading the reviews in one\ncorner, and I in the other at the piano, playing Schumann: both\nvery superior persons, and neither of us a bit of use. Sooner\nthan that, I would sweep out the guncotton shed, or be one of\nBodger's barmaids. Do you know what would have happened if you\nhad refused papa's offer?\n\nCUSINS. I wonder!\n\nBARBARA. I should have given you up and married the man who\naccepted it. After all, my dear old mother has more sense than\nany of you. I felt like her when I saw this place--felt that I\nmust have it--that never, never, never could I let it go; only\nshe thought it was the houses and the kitchen ranges and the\nlinen and china, when it was really all the human souls to be\nsaved: not weak souls in starved bodies, crying with gratitude or\na scrap of bread and treacle, but fullfed, quarrelsome, snobbish,\nuppish creatures, all standing on their little rights and\ndignities, and thinking that my father ought to be greatly\nobliged to them for making so much money for him--and so he\nought. That is where salvation is really wanted. My father shall\nnever throw it in my teeth again that my converts were bribed\nwith bread. [She is transfigured]. I have got rid of the bribe of\nbread. I have got rid of the bribe of heaven. Let God's work be\ndone for its own sake: the work he had to create us to do because\nit cannot be done by living men and women. When I die, let him be\nin my debt, not I in his; and let me forgive him as becomes a\nwoman of my rank.\n\nCUSINS. Then the way of life lies through the factory of death?\n\nBARBARA. Yes, through the raising of hell to heaven and of man to\nGod, through the unveiling of an eternal light in the Valley of\nThe Shadow. [Seizing him with both hands] Oh, did you think my\ncourage would never come back? did you believe that I was a\ndeserter? that I, who have stood in the streets, and taken my\npeople to my heart, and talked of the holiest and greatest things\nwith them, could ever turn back and chatter foolishly to\nfashionable people about nothing in a drawingroom? Never, never,\nnever, never: Major Barbara will die with the colors. Oh! and I\nhave my dear little Dolly boy still; and he has found me my place\nand my work. Glory Hallelujah! [She kisses him].\n\nCUSINS. My dearest: consider my delicate health. I cannot stand\nas much happiness as you can.\n\nBARBARA. Yes: it is not easy work being in love with me, is it?\nBut it's good for you. [She runs to the shed, and calls,\nchildlike] Mamma! Mamma! [Bilton comes out of the shed, followed\nby Undershaft].

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":615,"split":"train"}
