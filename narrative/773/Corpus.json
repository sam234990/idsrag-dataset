God creates the first humans Adam and Eve and all the animals in the Garden of Eden but instructs them not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A talking serpent, portrayed as a deceptive creature or trickster, entices Eve into eating it anyway, and she entices Adam, whereupon God curses them and throws them out in the fall of man. Eve bears two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain kills Abel after God accepts Abel's offering but not Cain's. God then curses Cain. Eve bears another son, Seth, to take Abel's place.\nAfter many generations of Adam have passed from the lines of Cain and Seth, the world becomes corrupted by the sin of man and Nephilim, and God determines to wipe out mankind. First, he instructs the righteous Noah and his family to build a huge boat and put examples of all the animals on it. Then God sends a great flood to wipe out the rest of the world. When the waters recede, God promises that he will not destroy the world a second time with water with the rainbow as the symbol of his promise. But upon seeing mankind cooperating to build a great tower city, the Tower of Babel, God divides humanity with many languages and sets them apart with confusion.\nGod instructs Abram to travel from his home in Mesopotamia to the land of Canaan. There, God makes a covenant with Abram, promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars, but that people will suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years, after which they will inherit the land \"from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.\" Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to Sarah, and circumcision of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant. Because Sarah is old, she tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden, Hagar, as a second wife. Through Hagar, Abraham fathers Ishmael.\nGod resolves to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah for the sins of their people. Abraham protests and gets God to agree not to destroy the cities if 10 righteous men can be found. Angels save Abraham's nephew Lot and his family, but his wife looks back on the destruction against their command and is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot's daughters, concerned that they are fugitives who will never find husbands, get him drunk to become pregnant by him, and give birth to the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites.\nAbraham and Sarah go to the foreign land of Gerar, pretending to be brother and sister (they are half-siblings). The King of Gerar takes Sarah for his wife, but God warns him to return her, and he obeys. God sends Sarah a son to be named Isaac, through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence, Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation.\nGod tests Abraham by demanding that he sacrifice Isaac. As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants. On the death of Sarah, Abraham purchases Machpelah (believed to be modern Hebron) for a family tomb and sends his servant to Mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for Isaac, and Rebekah is chosen. Other children are born to Abraham by another wife, Keturah, among whose descendants are the Midianites, and he dies in a prosperous old age and is buried in his tomb at Hebron.\nIsaac's wife Rebecca gives birth to the twins Esau, father of the Edomites, and Jacob. Through deception, Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing. He flees to his uncle where he prospers and earns his two wives, Rachel and Leah. Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and by his wives and their handmaidens he has twelve sons, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, and a daughter, Dinah.\nJoseph, Jacob's favorite son, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospers, after hardship, with God's guidance of interpreting Pharaoh's dream of upcoming famine. He is then reunited with his father and brothers, who don't recognize him but who plead for food. After much manipulation, he reveals himself and lets them and their households into Egypt, where Pharaoh assigns to them the land of Goshen. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and reveals their future before he dies. Joseph lives to an old age and exhorts his brethren, if God should lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Genesis A, by Anonymous\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

COOK, EDITOR\n\nXLVIII\n\nGENESIS A\n\nTRANSLATED FROM THE OLD ENGLISH\n\nBY\n\nLAWRENCE MASON, PH.D.\n\nINSTRUCTOR IN ENGLISH IN YALE COLLEGE\n\nNEW YORK\n\nHENRY HOLT AND COMPANY\n\n1915\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThe purpose of the translator in offering to the public this\nversion of the _Genesis_ is to aid in forwarding--be it by but one\njot or tittle--the general knowledge and appreciation of Old English\nliterature. Professed students in this department will always have\nan incentive to master the language; but to the public at large the\nstrangeness of this medium will prove an insurmountable barrier, and\nthe general reader must therefore either remain in ignorance of our\nolder literary monuments or else employ translations. The present\ncontribution[1] to the growing body of such translations possesses,\nperhaps, more than a single interest or appeal, in that it renders\naccessible not only a poem of considerable intrinsic worth, a poem\nassociated with the earliest of the great names in English literary\nhistory, and a forerunner and possible source of _Paradise Lost_, but\nalso an important example of a literary _genre_ once immensely popular,\nthough now quite fallen into abeyance--namely, the lengthy versified\nScriptural paraphrase. For some idea of the prominent part played by\nthis form, even so late as the seventeenth century, the reader is\nreferred to any comprehensive manual of English literature.\n\nIn this translation, prose has been employed instead of verse, for two\nreasons. In the first place, no metrical form has yet been found which,\nin the writer's judgment, at all adequately represents in modern English\nthe effect of the Old English alliterative verse, or stave-rime. And in\nthe second place, to the writer's thinking, no one but a poet should\nattempt to write verse: and on that principle, translations would be few\nand far between, unless prose were used.\n\nBut even granting the value of the _Genesis_ as a fit subject for\ntranslation, and the necessity for the employment of prose, the reader\nmay still quarrel with the particular _kind_ of prose hereinbelow\nessayed; so a brief explanation and, it is hoped, vindication of the\ntheory of translation here followed would seem desirable, inasmuch as\nconsiderable divergence is intended from the methods adopted by the\nvarious translators of the _Beowulf_, for example. First, Biblical\nphraseology has been eschewed, partly because in a modern writer it\nsavors of affectation, but chiefly because his Bible was the point\nof departure for the Old English author, and to return now in the\ntranslation to our Bible would be a stultification of his purposes by a\nsort of _argumentum in circulo_. Secondly, archaisms, poetic diction,\nand unusual constructions (the \"translation English\" anathematized by\nthe Rhetorics) have been so far as possible avoided, contrary to the\npractice of most translators from Old English poetry, because it is\nfelt strongly that such usages will not produce upon modern readers the\neffect that this poetry produced originally upon the readers or hearers\nfor whom it was intended. For this poetry could not have seemed alien\nor exotic to its original public: either through familiar poetic\nconvention, or owing to the staccato and ejaculatory character of\nordinary spoken language at the time, this spasmodic, apostrophic poetry\nmust have seemed natural and beautiful, in the seventh or eighth\ncentury. But--\n\n  Why take the style of those heroic times?\n  For nature brings not back the mastodon,\n  Nor we those times.\n\nTo translate is to modernize. This rendering, therefore, is not an\nartificial, pseudo-antique hybrid, but frankly endeavors to convey its\noriginal to modern readers in idiomatic modern literary English, devoid\nof any conscious mannerisms whatsoever. The writer has aimed at the\nutmost literal fidelity consistent with the observance of all the usages\nof current standard English; he has not attempted, however, to convert\nthe explosive appositions, with prevailing asyndeton and excessive\nsynonymy, of his original into the easy, flowing sentences more familiar\nto modern eyes and ears, for the change would sacrifice altogether too\nmuch of the distinctive character and flavor of Old English poetry.\n\nThe text upon which this work is based is that of the Grein-W\u00c3\u00bclker\n_Bibliothek der Angels\u00c3\u00a4chsischen Poesie,_ 1894, save for a few minor\nchanges in punctuation and the few departures recorded in the Notes.\nGrein's translation of the poem into modern German stave-rime, 1857, has\nbeen frequently consulted, but the writer's real indebtedness to it is\nfelt to be slight. He takes great pleasure, finally, in acknowledging\nhis deep sense of obligation, on many grounds, to the general editor of\nthis series, Professor Albert S. Cook; the work was undertaken at his\nsuggestion, and he has been most kind in giving advice and criticism.\n\nLawrence Mason.\n\n  YALE UNIVERSITY,\n  _July 17, 1913._\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n  With Specification of the Biblical Chapters and Verses\n            represented in each Section of the Poem\n\n                                                               PAGE\n\n  PREFACE                                                 III (135)\n\n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                                        VI (138)\n\n  GENESIS A:\n\n  Section I[2]                                              1 (141)\n  Section II (Gen. 1.1-5)                                   3 (143)\n  Section III (Gen. 1.4-10)                                 4 (144)\n  Lines 169-234 (Gen. 1.28, 31; 2.10-14, 18, 21, 22)        5 (145)\n  Lines 852-871 (Gen. 3.8-10)                               7 (147)\n  Section X (Gen. 3.11-15)                                  7 (147)\n  Section XI (Gen. 3.16, 17, 19, 21, 24; 4.1-5, 8)          9 (149)\n  Section XII (Gen. 4.9-19, 21)                            11 (151)\n  Section XIII (Gen. 4.22-26; 5.3-14)                      13 (153)\n  Section XIV (Gen. 5.15-29, 32)                           15 (155)\n  Section XV (Gen. 6.1-8, 11-19, 22)                       17 (157)\n  Section XVI (Gen. 7.1-7, 11, 12, 16-23)                  18 (158)\n  Section XVII (Gen. 8.1-4, 6-12)                          20 (160)\n  Section XVIII (Gen. 8.15-18, 20; 9.1-9, 11-19)           22 (162)\n  Section XIX (Gen. 9.20-28; 10.1, 2, 6, 8-10; 11.1)       24 (164)\n  Section XX (Gen. 10.1, 20, 21; 11.2, 4-8, 10, 26, 27)    26 (166)\n  Section XXI (Gen. 11.29-32; 12.1-8)                      28 (168)\n  Section XXII (Gen. 12.8, 10-20; 13.1-4)                  30 (170)\n  Section XXIII (Gen. 13.5-13)                             32 (172)\n  Section XXIV (Gen. 14.1, 2, 4, 10-16)                    33 (173)\n  Section XXV (Gen. 14.17-24; 15.1)                        37 (177)\n  Section XXVI (Gen. 15.2-5, 7, 18; 16.1-6)                39 (179)\n  Section XXVII (Gen. 16.6-12, 15, 16; 17.1, 2, 10-14, 19) 41 (181)\n  Section XXVIII (Gen. 17.17-21, 23, 24, 27; 18.12-14)     43 (183)\n  Section XXIX (Gen. 18.16, 17, 20-22)                     44 (184)\n  Section XXX (Gen. 19.1-13, 18-26)                        45 (185)\n  Section XXXI (Gen. 19.27-30, 33, 35-38)                  49 (189)\n  Section XXXII (Gen. 20.1-10)                             50 (190)\n  Section XXXIII (Gen. 20.11, 13-18; 21.1-4)               51 (191)\n  Section XXXIV (Gen. 21.5, 8-14, 22-24, 27)               53 (193)\n  Section XXXV (Gen. 21.33, 34; 22.1-13)                   55 (195)\n  NOTES                                                    58 (198)\n\n\n\n\nGENESIS A\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nOurs is a great duty--to praise in word and love at\nheart the heavens' Ruler, the glorious King of Hosts:\nHe is the substance of all power, the head of all high\nthings, the Lord Almighty. Origin or beginning was                     5\nnever made for Him, nor shall an end ever come to the\neternal God: but, on the contrary, He is for ever supreme\nby His high puissance over the heavenly kingdoms;\njust and mighty, He rules the mansions of the sky,                    10\nwhich were established far and wide through the power\nof God for the sons of glory, the keepers of souls.\n\nThese angelic hosts were wont to feel joy and rapture,\ntranscendent bliss, in the presence of their Creator:\ntheir beatitude was measureless. Glorious ministers                   15\nmagnified their Lord, spoke his praise with zeal, lauded\nthe Master of their being, and were excellently happy\nin the majesty of God. They had no knowledge of\nworking evil or wickedness, but dwelt in innocence                    20\nforever with their Lord: from the beginning they wrought\nin heaven nothing but righteousness and truth, until\na Prince of angels through pride strayed into sin: then\nthey would consult their own advantage no longer, but\nturned away from God's lovingkindness. They had                       25\nvast arrogance, in that by the might of multitudes they\nsought to wrest from the Lord the celestial mansions,\nspacious and heaven-bright. Then there fell upon\nthem, grievously, the envy, presumption, and pride\nof the Angel who first began to carry out the evil plot,              30\nto weave it and promote it, when he boasted by word--\nas he thirsted for conflict--that he wished to own the\nhome and high throne of the heavenly kingdom to the\nnorth. Thereupon God became angered and hostile                       35\ntowards the beings whom he had formerly exalted in\nbeauty and glory: he created for the traitors a marvelous\nabode as penalty for their action, namely the pangs of\nHell, bitter afflictions; Our Lord called forth that                  40\nabysmal joyless house of punishment to wait for the\noutcast keepers of souls.[3] When he knew that it was\nready, he enveloped it in eternal night and equipped it\nwith torment, filling it with fire and fearful cold, with\nfume and red flame: then he commanded the terrors\nof suffering to increase throughout that hapless place.               45\n\nThey had committed a dire sin against God: on that\naccount dire punishment befell them. They asserted,\nin fierce mood, that they wished to seize the kingdom\nand could easily do so: but this presumption mocked\nthem when their Lord, the high King of heaven, lifted                 50\nup his almighty hand against the throng. The mad\nrebels, accursed ones, could not make head against God,\nbut the Highest troubled their spirits and humbled their\npride, for he was incensed; he stripped the sinners of                55\nvictory and might, of dominion and honor, and further\ntook from his foes happiness, peace, and all joys, as well\nas bright glory, and finally, with his own exceeding power,\nwreaked his wrath on his adversaries in mighty ruin.                  60\nHe was stern in mood, grimly embittered, and seized\nupon his foes with resistless grasp and broke them in\nhis grip, enraged at heart, and deprived his opponents of\ntheir native seat,[4] their bright abodes on high. For                65\nour Creator dismissed and banished from heaven the\noverweening band of angels: the Lord sent away on a\nlong journey the faithless multitude, the hateful host,\nthe miserable spirits; their pride was broken, their threat           70\noverthrown, their glory shattered, and their beauty\ndimmed; thenceforth they abode in desolation, because\nof their dark exile. They did not dare to laugh aloud,\nbut lived wearied by the torments of hell and became\nfamiliar with woes, bitterness, and sorrow; covered with              75\ndarkness, they bore their pain,--a heavy sentence,\nbecause they had begun to battle against God.\n\nThen, as formerly, true peace existed in heaven, fair\namity: for the Lord was dear to all, the Sovereign to his             80\nservants; and the majesty of the joyful angelic hosts\nincreased, through the favor of the Almighty.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nSo those who inhabited the sky, home of glory, were\nat peace; hatred was gone, as well as sorrow and strife\namong angels, ever since the rebellious hosts, bereft of the          85\nlight, had relinquished heaven. Behind them stood in\ngrandeur their seats rich in glorious workmanship, teeming\nwith blessings in God's kingdom, bright and perennially\nbountiful,--but all devoid of occupants, ever since the               90\nmiserable spirits had gone to their place of punishment,\ntheir vile prison. Then our Lord bethought him, in\nmeditative mood, how he might people again, and with\na better race, his high creation, the noble seats and glory-          95\ncrowned abodes which the haughty rebels had left\nvacant, high in heaven. Therefore Holy God willed by\nhis plenteous power that under the circle of the firma-\nment the earth should be established, with sky above and             100\nwide water, a world-creation in place of the foes whom\nin their apostasy he hurled from bliss.\n\nAs yet there was nothing at all created here, except\nshadows, but this broad earth stood deep and dim, idle               105\nand useless, alien even to God himself; on it the King\nwhose purpose never falters turned his eyes and beheld\nthe place void of joy; he saw dark clouds, black under\nthe firmament, throng in the eternal night, dun and                  110\nwaste, until this world-creation came to pass through\nthe word of the King of Glory. First the everlasting\nLord, protector of all things, created heaven and earth;\nas the almighty King put forth the firmament and with                115\nvictorious might established this ample world. The\nearth was as yet unadorned by vegetation: the ocean\ncovered it far and wide, turbid waves in the eternal\nnight. Then was the glorious Spirit of heaven's guardian             120\nborne over the sea with sovereign virtue. For the King\nof the angels commanded Light, dispenser of life, to\ncome forth over the broad expanse: quickly was the\nArch-King's mandate fulfilled, and Holy Light appeared               125\nover the waste spaces, as the Creator had ordained it.\nThe Wielder of Victory next sundered light from darkness,\nshadow from radiance, over the surge of the sea. Then\nhe formed the two names of the dispensers of life: light\nwas first called \"Day\" by the word of the Lord, a                    130\nbeauteous creation. This period of creation greatly\npleased God, in the beginning: the first day saw the\ndark shadows duskily flee away over the wide earth.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTime now went forth over the frame-work of the                       135\nworld: after this shining splendor, the Lord our Creator\nfashioned the first evening, but on its track rushed a\nthronging welter of darkness which the Lord himself\ncalled by the name of \"Night.\" Our Saviour sundered                  140\nthese two: ever since then they have ceaselessly wrought\nand fulfilled the will of the Lord over the earth.\nThen the second day advanced, light after darkness;\nand the Ruler of Life straightway commanded a glad                   145\nsky-substance to appear in the midst of the flood: our\nMaster parted the waves and wrought there the found-\nations of the firmament: this the Mighty One, omnipotent\nKing, reared aloft from the earth through his own word.              150\nThe flood was divided under the high heavens by holy\npower, the waters from the waters, and still they remain\nso under the firmament which roofs all nations.\n\nThen swiftly came advancing over the world the third                 155\ngreat morn. Nor were the spreading lands and ways\nyet deemed needful by our Lord, but the earth stood\ngirt fast by water. Through his word, the Ruler of\nthe angels bade the waters be gathered together, which\nnow hold their course beneath the skies in an appointed              160\nplace. Then speedily the broad ocean stood all together\nunder heaven, as the Holy One commanded, for the\nflood was sundered from the dry land. Thereupon\nLife's Ruler looked upon the dry land, the Preserver of\nmankind [found it] widely visible, and the King of                   165\nGlory called it \"Earth.\" He established a proper\nchannel for the waves, the broad flood, and fettered....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n(_Lacuna in MS._[5])\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Ruler of Heaven did not think it fitting that                    170\nAdam, the keeper of Paradise and shepherd of the new\ncreation, should be alone any longer: so the supreme\nKing, Ruler Almighty, made a companion for him--\ncreated Woman, and gave this helpmate to his cherished               175\nMan as the first and fruitful light of his life. He took his\nmaterial from Adam's body and skilfully removed a\nrib from his side: the latter was deep in repose and\nslumbered peacefully; he felt no pain, though a little               180\nuneasiness, nor did a drop of blood come from the wound,\nbut the Prince of the Angels took from his body a living\nbone while the man was unwounded. From this God\nfashioned a noble woman, and put into her the breath\nof life and an immortal soul: these two were like the                185\nangels. Thus was Adam's bride[6] endowed with a\nliving spirit. They were both radiantly beautiful in their\nyouthfulness, in the world prepared by the might of\nthe Lord: they did not know how to undertake or                      190\nwork evil, but on the contrary there was in the breast\nof each a burning love of God. Then the benign King,\nRuler of everyone born of the race of man, blessed these\nfirst two creatures, father and mother, woman and\nman. Thereafter he spoke these words:                                195\n\n\"Be fruitful now and increase; fill the verdant earth\nwith progeny, your race, both sons and daughters. Under\nyour sway shall be the salt water and all the created\nworld. Enjoy prosperous days, [ruling over] both                     200\nthe fishes of the deep and the fowls of the air. Into\nyour power are given the sacred herd and the wild beasts\nand every living thing that walks the earth; all breath-\ning creatures, whatsoever the sea brings forth over the              205\nwhale-paths, all things belong to you two.\"\n\nThen our Maker beheld the beauty of his works and\nthe fullness of his abundance, his new creations. Pa-\nradise stood, good and holy, filled with blessings, ever-            210\nlasting bounty. That kindly soil was beauteously\nwatered by the rushing seas and springing fountains;\nfor never yet had clouds dark with wind brought down\nrains over the broad earth: but none the less the ground\nstood crowned with its harvest. From this new Garden                 215\nfour noble river-streams have their outflow: these were\nall partitioned out of one fair-shining water by the might\nof the Lord, when he created the earth, and [were thus]              220\nsent out into the world. Men dwelling on the earth,\nthe peoples of the nations, call one of these Fison, which\nbroadly girdles with its bright streams a quarter of the\nearth beyond Hebeleac[7]: in that ancestral soil the sons            225\nof men, nations near and far, find the best gold and\nprecious stones,[8] as the books tell us. Then the second\n[river], whose name is Geon, girdles the land and govern-\nment of Ethiopia, an ample kingdom. The third is                     230\nTigris, a foaming stream which encircles the people of\nAssyria. Such likewise is the fourth, which men among\nmany a nation now widely call Eufrates....[9]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n(_Genesis B intervenes here_.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the Almighty King, the great Lord, came forth\ninto the garden about mid-day, by his divine will; for               855\nour Saviour and merciful Father wished to find out\nwhat his children were doing: he knew that they were\nsinful to whom he had given perfection. Bereft of\ntheir beatitude and stricken in spirit, they avoided his\npresence by retreating among the shadows of the trees;               860\nthey hid themselves in dark recesses, when they heard\nthe holy word of the Lord and feared him. Straight-\nway the King of Heaven began to call for the keeper\nof the [newly] created world; the mighty Lord bade\nhis son come to him forthwith. He answered him then,                 865\nthe wretched one himself, destitute of clothing, [and]\nsaid:\n\n\"Lord of my life, I am hiding myself here because\nunclothed; basely sinful, I am covering my shame with\nleaves: my pain is cruel, most bitter in my heart. I dare            870\nnot now go forth before thy presence: I am all naked!\"\n\n\n\n\nX.[10]\n\n\nTo him then God at once replied:\n\n\"Tell me this, my son: why do you seek the shadows,\nin shame? You certainly received no disgrace at my                   875\nhands, but on the contrary delight in all things! How\ncome you to know evil and hide shame and behold sor-\nrow and cover your body with leaves and, saddened and\ncrushed by the woes of life, say that you need clothing,\nunless you have tasted of an apple from the tree which               880\nI forbade to you by express command?\"\n\nAdam then answered him again:\n\n\"The woman, my Lord, the fair woman gave into\nmy hand this fruit, which I accepted in sin against thee.            885\nNow I bear this manifest sign in myself: I know so much\nthe more of sorrow!\"\n\nThen Almighty God asked Eve about this:\n\n\"Why did you forfeit these plenteous delights, daughter,\nthe new creations of paradise, abundant blessings, when              890\nin your cupidity you seized on the trunk and took the\nfruit from the branch of the tree and ate the accursed\nthing in defiance of me, and gave of the apple to Adam,\nwhen you both by my prohibition were so strictly for-                895\nbidden to do so?\"\n\nThen the fair maiden, the woman overcome by shame,\nanswered him:\n\n\"The serpent tempted me and urgently prompted me\nto sin; through fair words the worm goaded me into\naccursed frowardness, until I basely performed the                   900\ndeadly act, committed the crime, and robbed the tree in\nthe grove, as it was not lawful to do, and ate the fruit.\"\n\nThen our Saviour, the Lord Almighty, ordained wide\nwanderings for the serpent, the venomous worm, and                   905\nspoke further in these words:\n\n\"To far distant times shalt thou, an outcast, crawl\nover the broad earth on thy breast, thy belly; without\nfeet shalt thou move about, so long as life and breath\nremain in thee. Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy              910\nlife, since thou hast accomplished so evil a deed here.\nThee the woman shall war against, and hate thee\n[worse than anything else] under heaven, and shall tread\nupon thine accursed head with her feet; thou shalt lie\nin wait at her heels, in ever-new conflict: for there\nshall be war between thy offspring and her offspring                 915\nalways, as long as the earth exists under the cloudy\nskies. Now dost thou understand and know, baleful\ndestroyer of mankind, how thou shalt live!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nThen God wrathfully spoke to Eve:\n\n\"Depart now from bliss! Thou shalt be ever under\nthe sway of men; with fear of men cruelly oppressed,                 920\nthou shalt sorrowfully endure the heinousness of thine\noffence and wait for death, and with weeping and wailing\nand great anguish bring into the world thy sons and\ndaughters!\"\n\nLikewise to Adam did the Eternal Lord, Source of                     925\nLight and Life, declare a cruel edict:\n\n\"Thou shalt seek another country, a joyless dwelling-\nplace, and wander in exile, naked and needy, driven                  930\naway from the blessings of paradise; the separation of\nsoul and body is now ordained for thee. Lo, thou hast\nwickedly originated sin: therefore thou shalt toil, and\nwin thy sustenance on earth by thyself, acquire it by\nthe sweat of thy face, and thus eat thy bread so long                935\nas thou livest here,--until ungentle disease, which thou\ndidst recently take to thyself with the apple, strikes\nthee cruelly to the heart: then shalt thou die.\"\n\nBehold, we learn thus how bitter afflictions and uni-                940\nversal miseries came upon us.\n\nThereupon the Guardian of Glory, our Creator, girded\nthem with clothing; the Lord bade them cover their\nnakedness with some simple garments, and bade them\nset forth and depart from paradise into a harder life.\nBehind them, by God's command, a holy angel with a                   945\nfiery sword shut the gate of their blissful home of peace\nand joy; nor may any guileful sin-stained man ever fare\nthither again, for the warder has might and strength                 950\nwho keeps for the Lord that greater life rich in glories.\nYet the Almighty, our First Father, would not take\naway all comforts from Adam and Eve, though they had\nfallen away from him: but he still let the lofty roof                955\nstudded with holy stars stand as a solace for them, and\ngave them ample possessions, and bade the seas and\nland bring forth for the pair multitudes of each of the\nyoung-producing species [necessary] for the sustenance               960\nof this life. So, after their sin, they inhabited a more\nsorrowful land, a dwelling and country less fertile in\nevery kind of blessing than their former abode had\nbeen, from which they had been driven out after their\nmisdeed.\n\nThen they began, by God's command, to produce                        965\nchildren, as the Lord had charged them. To begin\nwith, by Adam and Eve were brought into the world\ntwo fair first-born sons, Cain and Abel. The books\ntell us how these first toilers, loving brothers, gained             970\ntheir subsistence, riches and food: the one who was\nelder born tilled the earth with his strength; the second\nkept the flocks, helping his father, until a great number            975\nof days passed. They both brought an offering to the\nLord: the Prince of the Angels, King of all things, looked\nupon Abel's offering with [favorable] eyes, but would\nnot consider the sacrifice of Cain; that caused strong\nindignation in the heart of the man: rage arose in the               980\nyouth's breast, livid hatred, and wrath by reason of\nenvy: then he wrought evil deeds with his hands, slew\nhis kinsman, his own brother, shed his blood,--yea,                  985\nCain [shed] Abel's. And the earth soaked up this blood\nshed by murder, the life-blood of a man.\n\nAfter this fatal blow woe was aroused, the long train\nof afflictions: since then from this twig have hatefully\nsprouted ever longer and stronger bitter branches: these             990\nbranches of calamity spread far and wide over the nations\nof men: hardly and sorely did the twigs of misery strike\nthe sons of men (and so they still do), from which the\nbroad leaves of all suffering began to spring. We may                995\ntearfully lament this account, this death-bringing fatal-\nity, and not in vain: but the fair woman injured us\n[more] severely through the first sin which men dwelling\non earth ever committed against the Lord, since Adam                1000\nwas filled with the breath of life by the mouth of God!\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nThen the Master of Splendor asked Cain through his\nword, where Abel was, upon the earth. Quickly there-\nupon the wicked worker of slaughter answered him:                   1005\n\n\"I know not Abel's coming or going, my kinsman's\ncourse: I was not my brother's keeper!\"\n\nThen the Prince of Angels, the Spirit rich in good\nthings, spoke to him again:\n\n\"Why didst thou cast that virtuous man, thy brother,                1010\non his death-bed with thy violent hands, and his blood\nnow calleth and crieth unto me? For this murder\nshalt thou undergo punishment and wander in exile                   1015\naccursed unto distant ages: nor shall the earth, fair\nfor all necessary sustenance, yield thee harvest, for it\ndrank sacred blood at thy hands: therefore the earth,\nverdant in beauty, denies thee its bounties. Infamous,\nthou shalt sorrowfully wander from thy native land,\nbecause thou hast been Abel's murderer: thou shalt                  1020\ngo forth an outcast over a long road, hateful to all thy\nrelatives!\"\n\nThen Cain answered him[11]:\n\n\"Now I dare not hope for any grace in the kingdoms\nof the world, for I have forfeited, O high King of heaven,          1025\nthy favor as well as love and peace: therefore shall I\ntravel far ways in expectation of woes, whensoever any\none far or near shall find me, in my guilt, who may\nremember my crime, my brother's murder: I shed his                  1030\nblood, his life-blood on the ground. On this day thou\ndost banish me from comfort and drive me from my\nnative land: someone of my foes shall be my murderer;\naccursed, O God, shall I wander from thy sight.\"                    1035\n\nThen the Lord of Victory spoke to him:\n\n\"Thou needst not as yet dread the terror of death\nand murder, though thou shalt depart far from thy\nfriends, an outcast. If any man by his own hand                     1040\ndeprives thee of life, then shall come upon him sevenfold\nvengeance for his sin, as penalty for his deed.\"\n\nOur Ruler and glorious Lord set on him a sign, the                  1045\nMaster [set] a symbol of immunity, so that none of his\nfoes far or near might dare to approach him with warlike\nintent; then he bade the wicked one leave forever his\nmother and sons, all his family. Thereupon Cain set\nout and departed sorrowing from before the face of God,             1050\na joyless exile, and built himself a dwelling to the east,\na habitation far from his fatherland: there a fair maiden,\na woman of the country, bore him offspring.\n\nThe eldest was called Enos, first-born of Cain; he                  1055\nbegan at once to build a city, with his kinsfolk: that\nwas the first beneath the clouds of all the fortifications\nwhich heroes and swordsmen have caused to be built.                 1060\nTherein his offspring first arose, born of his wife in the\ncitadel: the eldest son of Enos was called Jared. Thence\narose the tribe of Cain, which increased the numbers                1065\nof its race. Next to Jared, Malalehel was the keeper\nof the heritage after his father, until he passed away.\nAfterwards Mathusal shared the royal treasures with\nhis kinsfolk, with his brothers, scion after scion, until           1070\nwise through length of days he had to consummate\nhis departure from the world and forsake life. After\nhis father's day, Lamech received the household\ngoods and domestic wealth: two wives, Ada and                       1075\nSella, women of the country, bore offspring to him: of\nthese one was Jabal by name, son of Lamech, who\nthrough skilful cunning first of dwellers here below\nawoke by his hands the song of the harp, that melo-                 1080\ndious sound.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nLikewise, at this same time, there was in this family\na man called Tubal Cain, a son of Lamech, who through\nthe abundance of his skill was a master-smith, and first            1085\namong men through the craft of his mind he was the\ninventor of agricultural implements upon earth: since\nthen the sons of men dwelling in cities have known far\nand wide how to use brass and iron.\n\nOnce on a time Lamech himself made in words a wicked                1090\nconfession to his two wives, his dear bed-fellows, Ada\nand Sella:\n\n\"In murder I have slain a certain one among my near\nrelations; I stained my hands with the gory death of                1095\nCain, destroyed with my hands the father of Enos, the\nslayer of Abel, and poured on the ground the life-blood\nof a man. Well knew I that for this shall come at last\nthe sevenfold vengeance of the King of Truth, great                 1100\naccording to the crime: my fall and destruction shall\nbe more sternly meted out, with grim horror, when I\ndepart!\"--\n\nNow, there came to Adam in Abel's place another                     1105\nheir born in legal wedlock, an upright son, whose name\nwas Seth: he was happy and contributed greatly to the\ncomfort of his parents, Adam and Eve, his father and\nmother, and took Abel's place in worldly affairs.                   1110\n\nThen the first of men spoke these words:\n\n\"The Eternal Lord of Victory and Ruler of Life has\ngiven me a son in place of the dear one whom Cain\nslew, and our God has driven my grievous sorrow from                1115\nmy heart with this man-child: to Him be praise for this!\"\nWhen he began again to raise up another son to him-\nself by his wife, to be his heir, Adam the vigorous cham-\npion had [numbered] 130 winters of this life in the world.          1120\nThe Scriptures tell us that on earth here for 800 years\nafter that, Adam increased his family with maidens\nand youths: in all he had 930[12] winters, when he had to           1125\ngive over this world through the departure of his spirit.\nAfter him Seth ruled over the people,[13] the son held\nthe heritage after the parents, and took unto himself               1130\na wife: he counted 105 winters when he first began to\nincrease the numbers of his family by sons and daughters.\nThe eldest son of Seth was called Enos: he first of all             1135\nthe children of man called upon God,[14] since Adam\nstepped upon the green grass, endowed with the spirit\nof life. Seth was happy, and afterwards begot sons\nand daughters for 807 winters: in all he had 912, when              1140\nthe time was fulfilled that he should accomplish his\ndeparture.\n\nAfter him, when he departed out of the world, Enos\nheld the heritage, after the earth had received the body            1145\nof Seth, fruitful in the Lord. He was dear to God, and\nlived here 90 winters before he begot children here by\nhis wife through intercourse: to him then was Cainan\nfirst born, an heir in his ancestral home. Afterwards               1150\nfor 815 winters[15] in the peace of God, the wise hero\nbegot offspring, sons and daughters: he died, the sage\npatriarch, when he had [fulfilled] 905 [years].\n\nAfter Enos, Cainan was chieftain, keeper, and leader                1155\nof his race: he had [numbered] 70 winters before a son\nwas born to him: when an heir was born for the patri-\nmony, this son of Cainan was called Malalehel. There-               1160\nafter for 840 [years] he increased the number of his\nfamily by [begetting] children. In all, the son of Enos\nhad [lived] 910 winters, when he left this world, when              1165\nthe number of his appointed days under the expanse of\nthe skies was fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nAfter him Malalehel kept the land and inheritance for\nmany seasons. The chieftain had [lived] 65 winters,                 1170\nwhen he began to beget children by his wife. His wife\nbrought a son to him, the woman to the man: this son\nin his childhood, as I have heard, the man-child in his\nyouth, was called Jared. After this Malalehel lived                 1175\nlong and rejoiced in [his] blessings, [all] the delights of\nmen here below and worldly treasures: 895 winters had\nhe numbered when he departed; to his son he left the                1180\nland and the government.\n\nAfter him for a long while Yeared dispensed gold to\nthe people; the chieftain was noble, a pious hero, and a\nruler dear to his subjects; 165 expectant winters he                1185\nlived his life in this world, when his happiness arrived,\nfor his wife brought a son into the world: this son was\ncalled Enoch, his fair first-born. But the father still\nadded descendants to the number of his race, for 800                1190\n[years]: in all he had [counted] 965 [years] by night-\nreckoning when he departed, the ancient patriarch,\nwhen he gave up this world. And Yeared left land and                1195\ngovernment to his wise [son], the dear leader.\n\nAfter this Enoch raised aloft the sovereignty, the sagaci-\nous leadership of the people: in no wise did he let fall the\ndominion and authority[16] while he was guardian of his             1200\nkinsfolk: he enjoyed days of happiness, and begot sons,\nfor 300 winters; the Lord, the Ruler of the Skies, was\ngracious to him. From this world the hero sought in\nthe body the joy and bliss of the Lord; in no wise did              1205\nhe die the death of this earth, as men [ordinarily] do\nhere, young and old, when God takes away from them\ntheir possessions and substance, [all] earth's treasures,\nand their life as well: but while living he set forth with          1210\nthe King of Angels out of this transitory life into bliss,[17]\n[clad] in the robes which his spirit received before his\nmother brought him forth to men. He left the people\nto his to his eldest son, his first-born; 365 winters had he        1215\n[numbered] when he left the world.\n\nFor some time after him, his son Mathusal held the\ninheritance, who for the longest space of time enjoyed              1220\nthe pleasures of the world in this body: he begot a\nmultitude of sons and daughters, before the day of his\ndeath. When he had to depart from among men, the\nvenerable hero had [enjoyed] 970 winters.\n\nAfter him, his son Lamech held the government: for                  1225\na long time thereafter he ruled over the world; he had\n[lived] 102 winters when the season came for the chief-\ntain to begin to beget noble heirs, sons and daughters.\n\nAfter this the lord and chief of the people lived 595               1230\n[years], enjoyed many a winter under the skies, ruled\nthe race well, and begot children: youths and maidens\narose as heirs to him. The eldest of them he named\nNoe, who reigned over the land among men after Lamech               1235\ndeparted.\n\nThis sage ruler of the noblemen was 500 years old\nwhen he first began to beget children, as the books tell.\nThe eldest son of Noe was called Sem, the next Cham,                1240\nthe third Jafeth.\n\nThe people multiplied widely under the skies: the\nrace of men increased in number over the earth, by                  1245\n[the birth of] sons and daughters. Now the descendants\nof Seth, that beloved leader of the people, were still\nvery much cherished, dear to the Lord and prosperous.\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nBut when the sons of God began to seek brides among\nthe race of Cain, the accursed folk, and chose wives                1250\nfrom among them against the will of God, the children\nof men from among the sinful maidens, beautiful and\nbright, then the Ruler of the heavens pronounced his\nwrath against mankind and spoke these words:\n\n\"The men of Cain's race have not been absent from                   1255\nmy mind, but that stock has sorely offended me. Now\nthe sons of Seth renew my wrath and take to themselves\nthe maidens of my enemies as wives: the fairness of the             1260\nwomen, the maidens' faces, and the eternal Fiend have\nshamefully captivated the multitude of men who were\nformerly in peace.\"\n\nAfter that, for 120 winters, duly numbered, exile\nafflicted the accursed race in this world; then the Lord            1265\nwished to inflict punishment upon the covenant-breakers,\nand to smite with death the doers of evil, the giant folk\nunloved by God, the great and sinful foes hateful to the\nLord, when the Wielder of Victory himself saw what                  1270\nwas man's wickedness on earth, and how they all were\nbold in crime and utterly vicious. He thought to\npunish rigorously the races of men, to seize upon the               1275\npeoples grimly and sorely, with cruel might: he repented\nexceedingly that he had ever created the author of the\nnations, the source of the peoples, when he fashioned\nAdam. He said that on account of the sins of men he\nwould utterly blot out all that there was on earth,                 1280\ndestroy every one of the bodies in whose bosom the\nbreath of life was concealed: all that came near to the\nsons of men, the Lord determined to annihilate.\n\nNoe, the son of Lamech, just and honorable, was dear                1285\nto God, the Preserver. The Lord knew that the virtue\nof the true man prevailed in the innermost thoughts of\nhis breast; therefore the Lord, holy in helpfulness, Pro-           1290\ntector of all men, told him by revelation what he pur-\nposed inflicting upon the wicked ones: for he saw the\nearth full of unrighteousness, the broad plains laden\nwith sin, polluted with foulness. Then spoke the Al-                1295\nmighty, our Saviour, and said to Noe:\n\n\"I am resolved to destroy humanity by means of a\ndeluge, and also every kind of living thing that the air\nand waters produce and support, both beast and bird:\nbut thou shalt have shelter, with thy sons, when the                1300\ndark waters, the black floods of death, destroy mankind,\nthe vile sinners. Begin to build thee a ship, a mighty\nsea-house, in which thou shalt give a place of refuge\nto many a one and a safe home to every species on earth,            1305\nafter thine own. Build partitions in the midst of the\nship. Make the boat fifty cubits wide, thirty high,\nthree hundred long, and joint it stoutly against the                1310\nassault of the waves. There shall be a creature of every\nliving species, a scion of every race on earth, led within\nthat wooden fortress; so must the Ark be the greater!\"\n\nNoe did as the Lord commanded him, obeyed the                       1315\nholy King of Heaven, began at once to build that Ark,\nthe mighty sea-chest; he told his kinsmen that there\nwas a horrible thing impending over the people, dire\npunishment: but they heeded this not at all. Then,                  1320\nafter several winters, the Changeless Lord saw that the\nvast sea-house, Noe's vessel, towered up in readiness,\nstrengthened within and without with the best earth-\nlime, against the waves; it is unique in its kind: the\nharder the fierce waters of the dark billows beat it, the           1325\nstouter does it ever become.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nThen our Preserver spoke to Noe: \"I give thee my\npledge for this, O dearest of mankind, that thou mayst\nnow take up thy course with the creatures of all kinds              1330\nwhich thou shalt bear across the deep water for many\ndays, in the bosom of thy vessel. Lead on board the\nArk, as I bid thee, thy sons, the three first-born, and\nyour four wives. And do thou take into the sea-house                1335\nseven [members] duly counted of each of the species that\nlive to [supply] nourishment for men, and two of each\nof the others: likewise take on the Ark some of all plants\ngrowing on earth used for food by the people who are                1340\nto sail over the floods with thee. Feed freely the differ-\nent species of animals, until I shall prepare a place under\nheaven by my Word for those who are saved from this\nwatery journey. Depart now with thy household into                  1345\nthe Ark, with the multitude of dependent things; I know\nthee for a good and true man: thou art worthy of\nsafety and mercy, with thy sons. In seven nights now I\nshall let the deadly rain fall from above upon the face             1350\nof the broad earth. For forty days will I set my ven-\ngeance against mankind, and with a deluge blot out all\nthe possessions and possessors that are beyond the sides\nof the Ark, when the black storm begins to descend.\"                1355\n\nThen Noe left him, as our Preserver commanded, in\norder to lead his children on board the Ark, men and their\nwives together on the great ship; and all that God Al-\nmighty wished to preserve for perpetuating their spe-\ncies, went on board to their food-giver, as the Almighty            1360\nLord of Hosts bade them through his word. With his\nown hands, the Guardian of Heaven, Wielder of Victory,\nlocked the entrance of the sea-house behind them, and               1365\nour Saviour blessed [all] within the Ark with his own\ngrace. Noe, the son of Lamech, had 600 winters when\nhe embarked with his sons, at God's command,--that                  1370\nwise man, with the young people, his dear kinsfolk.\n\nThe Lord sent rain from heaven, and likewise let\nthe springs from every source rush upon the world far\nand wide, [let] the dark ocean-streams burst forth in               1375\ntumult: the seas rose up over the boundaries of the\nshore. Strong and stern was He who ruled the waters,\nfor he covered and shrouded with wan waters the accursed\nwickedness of the sons of the earth and devastated the              1380\nland and homes of men: the Lord wreaked [his fury]\nupon men for their offences. The sea cruelly gripped\nthe wretched folk for forty days, and nights as many\nbitter was the suffering then, cruelly fateful to men.\nThe waves of the King of Glory drove the souls of the               1385\nvicious ones forth from their bodies. The flood covered\neverything; turbid under the sky [it covered] the high\nmountains over the broad earth, and on its crest raised\nthe Ark aloft from the ground, and its noble crew with it,\n[the Ark] which the Lord Himself, our Creator, blessed,             1390\nwhen he locked the ship. Thereafter this best of ships\nrode widely under the skies over the circle of the sea,\nfared [forth] with its freight: the terrors of the flood            1395\nwould have seized them with violence in the sea-traver-\nsing vessel, but the Holy God led and preserved them.\nFifteen ells deep, by man's measure, stood the deluge\nover the hills. That is a memorable occurrence: there               1400\nwas nothing at hand for [the Ark] but destruction,\nexcept that it was raised aloft into the upper air when\nthe inundation killed all creatures upon earth other than\nthose whom the Lord of Heaven saved on board the Ark,\nwhen the Holy God everlasting, the steadfast King, let              1405\n[the flood] rise up with ever-increasing[18] stream.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nThen God, Wielder of Victory, was mindful of those\nfloating on the deep, the son of Lamech and all his                 1410\nfamily, whom the Source of Light and Life had locked\nup against the water in the bosom of the ship. The\nLord of mankind led the heroes by his Word over far\nlands. Soon the flood began to abate; the deluge ebbed,\ndark under the sky: the true God had turned back again              1405\nthe foaming waves, for his children; the Glorious One\n[had] stilled the cataracts of rain. For 150 nights under\nthe skies the foamy ship floated, from the time when\nthe well-nailed sides of this best of boats first arose\nupon the flood until this number of days of dire time               1420\nhad passed. Then the Ark of Noe, greatest of ocean-\nhomes, settled on high with its burden on the hills which\nare called Armenia: there the pious son of Lamech                   1425\nawaited the sure promises for a long time, when the\nKeeper of Life, the Almighty King, gave him relief from\nthe perilous chances which he had long undergone,\nwhen the dark waves bore him abroad on the deep over                1430\nfar countries.\n\nThe flood was sinking; the sea-farers, the heroes and\ntheir wives, longed [for the time] when they might\nventure to step out of their straitened quarters over the\nwell-nailed side out on the bank, and take their goods              1435\nout of their crowded home. So the guardian of the ship\ntried to find out whether the waters were still sinking\nunder the clouds: accordingly, after many days from the\ntime the high mountain-sides received the possessions               1440\nand persons of the races of earth, the son of Lamech\nlet a black raven fly out of the Ark over the high flood.\nNoe believed that if it found no land in its flight, it             1445\nwould zealously seek him again on the ship over the wide\nwater. But this hope failed him; for the evil [bird]\nalighted upon a floating corpse: the dark-feathered fowl\nwould not seek [further]. Then again after a week he sent\nfrom the Ark a purple dove to fly over the high water               1450\nafter the dark raven, for the purpose of finding out\nwhether the foamy sea, the ocean, had given up any\nportion of the green earth, as yet. Widely she sought               1455\nher desired object, and flew afar: nowhere did she find\na resting-place, since she could not settle on land on foot\nbecause of the flood, nor alight on a leaf of a tree\nbecause of the waves; for the steep mountain-sides were             1460\nhidden by the waters. The wild bird set out in the\nevening to seek the Ark over the dusky flood, and sank\nweary and famished in the hands of the pious hero.\nThen after a week the wild-dove was again sent out                  1465\nfrom the Ark: she flew far, until greatly rejoicing she\nfound a fair place for rest and settled with her feet on\na tree; she exulted glad at heart, because exceedingly\nweary [as she was] she could sit in the bright branches             1470\nof a tree: she shook out her wings and started to fly\nback again with her gift, [for she] brought in her flight\nan olive twig, green leaves, into the hands of one [on\nboard]. Then quickly the leader of the voyagers per-                1475\nceived that solace had come, relief from their perilous\nexperience. So again after a third week the happy\nman sent out a wild dove; it did not come flying back\nto the ship, for it found land, green groves: the glad              1480\ncreature did not wish to show itself ever again under the\npitch-smeared roof on the Ark, when there was no need.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nThen to Noe spoke our Preserver, Ruler of Heaven,\nwith holy voice:\n\n\"For you is a dwelling-place again appointed, fair                  1485\non the dry land, joys on earth and rest after your voyage.\nDepart in peace out of the Ark, and lead forth upon the\nbosom of the earth out of this lofty structure your com-\npanions and all the creatures which I mercifully preserved          1490\nfrom the peril of the flood, while the deluge held sway\n[and] covered your home with its abundance.[19]\"\n\nHe did so, and obeyed the Lord, stood forth upon the\nstrand, as the Voice bade him, and with great joy led               1495\nout of the ship the survivors of these perils.\n\nThen Noe began to institute a sacrifice to our Preserver,\nand immediately took a part of all his possessions which\nthe Lord had given to him for his comfort, and then,                1500\nzealous for the offering, even to God Himself, King of\nthe Angels, the clear-souled man proffered the sacrifice.\nCertainly our Saviour let it be known, when he blessed              1505\nNoe and his sons too, that [the patriarch] had given Him\nthis offering acceptably and in his youth had merited\nby his good deeds that Almighty God, Glorious in\nSplendor, should be gracious to him with all blessings.             1510\nThen again the Lord, Ruler of Glory, spoke a word to\nNoe:\n\n\"Increase now and multiply, enjoy your honor, with\nthe gladness of peace: fill the earth, make all things teem.\nInto your possession is given a noble heritage, the produce         1515\nof the sea, the fowls of heaven, and the wild beasts,--\nthe verdant earth and every treasure. You shall\nnever dishonorably procure your food through bloodshed,             1520\nsinfully stricken in its life-blood. Each one first of all\ninjures himself in the riches of the spirit, who with the\nedge of the sword takes the life of another: nor shall\nhe dare to rejoice in thought over the spoils, for I will\navenge a man's death all the more severely upon the                 1525\nslayer and upon the fratricide, in proportion as blood-\nshed, the slaughter of a man with weapons, or murder by\n[violent] hands, seems to succeed. Man was first created\nin the likeness of God: every man has the form of the               1530\nLord and of the Angels, whose virtues follow my holy\nwill. Increase and multiply, enjoy riches and honor on\nearth. Fill the countries of the world with people, your\noffspring, sons and daughters. I will set up for you this           1535\nmy pledge, that I will never again let loose the floods\nupon the earth, the waters over the broad lands: you\nmay see this witness frequently upon the clouds, when               1540\nI show my rainbow, [as proof] that I will certainly keep\nthis bond with men, while the world lasts.\"\n\nThus was the prudent son of Lamech, the keeper of\nthe heritage, disembarked from his ship after the flood             1545\nwith his three sons; and their four wives were named\nPercoba, Olla, Olliva, and Ollivani,[20] saved from the\nwaters by the true God. The stout-minded heroes,                    1550\nthe sons of Noe, were called Sem and Cham, and the third\nIafeth: from these warriors the nations sprang and all\nthis earth was filled with the children of men.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\nThen for the second time Noe began to establish his                 1555\nhome, with his kinsfolk, and to till the earth for food;\nhe struggled and toiled, planted a vineyard, sowed many\nseeds and tended them carefully, so that the green                  1560\nearth, with its fertile boon, brought him fair harvests.\n\nThen it befell once that the blessed man was in his\ndwelling, drunken with wine; weary of feasting he slept,\nand thrust the robe from his body, as was not fitting, and          1565\nlay there with naked limbs: little he noticed that it went\nso ill with him in his hall, when intoxication in his breast\ngripped his heart in the holy house. In this torpor his             1570\nintelligence was cruelly crippled, so that he could not\ncall to mind [the necessity for] covering himself with his\nclothing and concealing his nakedness, as was ordained\nfor men and women, ever since the minister of Glory                 1575\nlocked the native abode of life behind our [first father]\nand mother, with a fiery sword. Now Cam, the son\nof Noe, chanced to come in where his father lay bereft\nof consciousness: thereupon would he dutifully no honor             1580\nshow to his own father nor at least conceal the dis-\ngrace from his kinsmen; but laughing aloud he told\nhis brothers how the patriarch rested in the house.\nThey repaired thither speedily, their faces carefully               1585\nveiled under cloaks, so that they bore aid to the dear\nman: they were both good men, Sem and Iafeth.\n\nThen the son of Lamech awoke from his sleep and\nsoon perceived that Cham would not show him, the nobly              1590\nborn, any affection and duty, when honor was due him.\nThat was bitter to the heart of the holy man, and he\nbegan to curse his son with [harsh] words: he said that\nHam should be humbled under the heavens, the servant                1595\nof his kinsfolk on earth: on him and his race those\nbaneful words have fallen heavily, ever since. Then\nNoe enjoyed his broad heritage with his sons, free men,\nfor 350 winters of this life after the flood: then he passed        1600\naway.\n\nAfter that his sons dispensed the treasures: they\nbegot children: great was their wealth. Thus to Iafeth\nwas progeny born, a pleasing family of promising young              1605\nones, sons and daughters. He was a good man [and]\never prosperously held his patrimony, [sharing his]\nabundance with his children, until the treasure of his\nbreast, his spirit longing for release, was summoned to             1610\nthe judgment of God: thereupon Geomor, Iafeth's son,\nshared his father's property with his friends, dear ones,\nand relatives; with his descendants was filled by genera-\ntion no small portion of the earth.--\n\nSons of Cham were born, likewise, heirs for the pa-                 1615\ntrimony: the eldest were called Chus and Cham, very\nnoble of soul, the first-born of Cham. Chus was the\nchief of the leaders, dispenser of treasure and worldly             1620\nriches to his brothers, the private property of his father,\nafter Cham fared forth from the body when death fell\nto his lot. This leader of the people delivered judgments           1625\nfor his race until the number of his days had run: then\nthe hero yielded up this world's goods and sought another\nlife. After that, the son of Chus, first-born of the\nbrothers, ruled the paternal[21] heritage, a widely known           1630\nman. So the Scriptures tell us, that he had the greatest\nmight and strength of all mankind, in those days: he\nwas a prince of the Babylonian Empire, and first of the\nnobles raised, spread, and exalted its fame. At that                1635\ntime one tongue was still common to all dwellers on\nearth.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\nLikewise from Cam's stock sprang many descendants,\nand to these numerous people great families were born.--\n\nFurthermore many sons and daughters were born into                  1640\nthe world to Sem, noble folk, before the ruler of men\ntook to his death-bed, in the course of years. In this\nfamily were good men, of whom one was called Eber, a                1645\nson of Sem: from this chief sprang a multitude of people,\nwhom all nations and earth-dwellers now call Hebrews.\n\nThey set out then to take their posssesions from the\neastward, live-stock and treasure; the people were un-              1650\nanimous: the vigorous heroes sought a less crowded land,\nuntil the migrating folk in great multitudes came where\ntheir noble leaders firmly took possession. The rulers              1655\nof the people settled with their dear followers in Sennar,\nample and broad; in the years of their life the fields\nwere ever verdant and the earth fair for the people at\nthat time, with increasing abundance of each [kind of]      1661\ntreasure.\n\nThen many a man argued with his dear friend, one\nresolute hero with another, that for their greater glory,\nbefore the masses of the people should scatter again over           1665\nthe earth, numbers of the nation in search of land, they\nshould build a city and raise up a tower to the stars of\nheaven as a sign that they had sought Sennar fields because\nthe mighty fore-fathers of the race, the patriarchs, long           1670\nlived there with pleasure: with craft the people wrought,\nin labor and industry, until in arrogance and rashness they\nshowed their skill, built a fortress and raised aloft scaling-      1675\nladders towards heaven, mightily erected a solid stone wall\nbeyond man's measure, eager for glory:--[all this did] the\nheroes with their hands. Then Holy God came to inspect\nthe work of the race of men, the fortress of the warriors,          1680\nand that beacon-tower likewise which the sons of Adam\nbegan to rear up to the skies; and the steadfast King\nachieved the prevention of this evil design, when in\nwrath he distributed different languages among the                  1685\ninhabitants of earth, so that they no longer had control\nof their speech. They found then multitudes at the\ntower with victorious strength, leaders of work in vast\nbattalions: but not one of the tribes understood what               1690\nanother was saying. It could not be, that they should\nbuild up the stone wall further; but they wretchedly\nparted in bands separated by their speech: one had\nbecome to another a strange race, after the Lord by the             1695\nfullness of his might had confused the speech of men.\nThe disunited sons of the patriarchs then parted in\nfour directions to seek land: behind them, both the                 1700\nmighty tower of stone and the lofty city stood on Sennar\n[plain] together, half-finished.\n\nThen the race of Sem increased and multiplied under\nthe clouds, until a man arose in the number of that\nkingly people, a sagacious man, prudent in habit. To                1705\nthis nobleman sons were born, two free children were\nborn in Babylon, and these chieftains, strong-minded\nheroes, were called Abraham and Aaron. The Sovereign                1710\nof the Angels was friend and guide to both these leaders.\nThen to Aaron was born a son, upright in life, whose\nname was Loth. Thereafter the righteous heroes,\nAbraham and Loth, throve nobly in the Lord's sight, as              1715\nthe inheritance in the kingdom came to them from their\nparents; therefore they widely glorified the sons of men\nwith gifts.\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\nNow the period of time had come when Abraham                        1720\nbrought a wife, a fair and free-born bride to his house,\nwhere he possessed a dwelling: the woman was named\nSarra, as the books tell us. They enjoyed life thus for\nmany winters, held the property together in peace for               1725\nmany years. But it was not vouchsafed to Abraham\nas yet that his bright-faced bride should bring into the\nworld a guardian for his heritage, that Sarra [should\nbear] sons and daughters to Abraham.\n\nThen Abraham's father set out with his family and                   1730\n[all] his substance to pass through the Caldean country:\nhe wisely wished to seek the land of Canan, with his\nhousehold. The cousins chosen by the Lord, Abraham\nand Loth, went with him out of their heritage. Then                 1735\nthe nobly-born sons of the patriarchs took up their\ndwelling in Carran, the men with their wives. In his\nhome here Abraham's father departed this life, the                  1740\nsteadfast worthy: he had told 205 winters, in all, when\nhe fared forth ripe in years to meet his fate.\n\nThen the holy Guardian of the heavenly kingdom, the                 1745\nEternal Lord, spoke to Abraham:\n\n\"Set forth now, and take thy movable possessions and\nfertile herds with thee. Give up Carran, thy father's\ndwelling-place. Depart, as I bid thee, O dearest of\nmen, and heed well my instructions, and seek the land               1750\nwhich I shall show thee, a broad verdant country. Thou\nshalt live blessed under my protection: if any of the\ndwellers on earth greet thee with evil, I will set upon             1755\nthem my curse and my hatred, long-lasting affliction;\nand I shall give favors, abundance of blessings, to those\nwho treat thee well. Through thee shall all earth-\ndwellers, sons of man, receive peace and friendship,                1760\nmy grace and blessing, in this world. Far spreading\nunder the sun shall be the number of thy race by [the\nbirth of] sons and daughters, until many a region of the            1765\nearth shall be filled with thy progeny.\"\n\nThen Abraham, pre\u00c3\u00abminently upright, rich, and blessed\nwith gold and silver, set out to take his flocks and\npossessions from Carran into the country of Egipt, as               1770\nthe Warder of Victory, our Ruler, bade him through his\nWord: they sought the land and nation of Canan. Thus\nthe man dear to God came to lead his wife, his dear bed-            1775\nfellow, and his nephew's wife, into this inheritance, into\nhappiness. He had [numbered] 75 winters when he\nhad to fare forth, to give up Carran and his kinsfolk.\nSo Abraham set out, mindful of the instructions of the              1780\nFather Almighty, to look for the broad land beyond\nthese nations, at his Lord's command, until prospering\nin his journey the courageous man came to Siem, of the\nCananite race. Then the Lord and King of the Angels,\nSovereign of men, manifested himself to Abraham and                 1785\nsaid:\n\n\"This is the country, verdant and bright and adorned\nwith fruits, that I intend to give into the power of thy\ndescendants, an ample kingdom!\"                                     1790\n\nThen the good man built an altar and offered sacrifice\nto the Ruler of Life and Source of Light, the Protector\nof souls. Thereupon Abraham traveled still further from\nthe east in order to search with his eyes for the choicest          1795\nof lands (he remembered the favors, God's promises,\nwhich the King of Victory Himself truthfully declared\nto him through his holy word), until the people came with\ntheir possessions to the place where the town is called\nBethlem: the glad-hearted chieftain and his brother's               1800\nson, pious men, went forward over the storied land from\nthe east, with their possessions, over the precipitous\nmountain-sides, and chose a dwelling-place for them-\nselves where the fields seemed bright and fair to them.             1805\n\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\n\nThere Abraham for the second time built an altar:\nthere he called upon God with noble words, and offered\nsacrifice to the Lord of his life. Not at all sparingly\ndid God, through His own hand, give him reward for\nthis,--rich bounty, in the very place of sacrifice.                 1810\n\nThere for a while the wise leader dwelt in his home\nand enjoyed happiness, the hero with his bride, until a\nfrightful calamity began to press upon the Cananite\nrace, cruel hunger, deadly to home-staying men. Then                1815\nthe wise Abraham, chosen by the Lord, went into Egypt\nto seek sustenance; the sage fled before evil: the plague\nwas too strong. Abraham spoke,--for he saw the white                1820\npinnacled halls of Egypt and the tall cities shining\nbrightly,--and then the ruler, the sagacious man, began\nto instruct his wife, in these words:\n\n\"When many haughty Egyptians shall gaze with\ntheir eyes upon thy countenance, then should the nobly-             1825\nborn chieftains suppose, O woman fair as a goddess, that\nthou art my bright bed-fellow whom some one of the\nwarriors will wish to have for himself, then I may well\nfear for myself lest some one of my foes may deprive                1830\nme of life with the edge of his sword by reason of his\namorous desire. Say then, Sarra, that thou art my\nsister, my blood-relation, when the strange men ask\nthee what degree of familiarity may exist between us                1835\ntwo foreigners, who come from so far away: hold fast\ntrue speech from them, and thus thou shalt preserve\nmy life,--if the Lord of Peace, our Almighty Ruler,\ngrant me longer life in this world, as he did before, who           1840\nordained these travels for us in order that we might seek\naid and secure sustenance for ourselves in Egipt.\"\n\nThereupon Abraham, the vigorous leader, proceeded                   1845\nwith his possessions into Egypt, where the people were\nstrange to him, and friends unknown. Many haughty\nmen spoke of the beauty of his wife in their remarks,\nmen distinguished by their wealth: to many high-spirited            1850\nmen, vassals of the king, his wife seemed noble in counte-\nnance. They brought the news to their liege-lord, and[22]\nfew women did they repute fairer before the king, but\nthey lauded exceedingly Sarra's countenance for its                 1855\ngreat beauty, until he bade them bring the lovely woman\nto his own hall. The ruler of the people and chief of\nthe nobles bade them enrich Abraham with treasures.\nBut the Lord God became aggrieved and incensed against              1860\nFarao for his love of the woman: the joy of his house-\nhold[23] bore this wrath hardly with his intimates. How-\never, the ruler of the people perceived what the Lord\nwas sending upon him for punishment: urged on by                    1865\nfear, the king of Egipt called Abraham to him and gave\nhim his bride, [returned] his wife into his keeping, bade\nhim seek friends elsewhere, noblemen of another race.\nThen the ruler of the country ordered his vassals and               1870\nministers to escort him out of their land again, honor-\nably, uninjured in any respect, so that he might be in\npeace.\n\nThen Abraham took [all his] possessions out of the\ncountry of Egypt: these worthy heroes took their wives,             1875\nboth brides and rings, while they brought their flocks\nto Bethlem, a familiar dwelling-place, [brought] their\nwomenfolk and treasures and their worldly goods.                    1880\nThen they began to build there, and to erect their city\nand settle their homes, and renew their prosperity.\nThe men built an altar in the meadows near the one that\nAbraham had formerly reared to his Lord, when he\ncame to this western land: there the fortunate man                  1885\nexalted the Name of the Eternal Lord once more; the\nhigh-minded ruler offered sacrifice to the King of the\nAngels, thanked exceedingly the Source of Light and\nLife for his happiness and honor.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\n\nAbraham and Loth lived in these dwellings and had                   1890\nabundance of prosperity, ruled over their heritage, until\nthey could not enjoy plenty together any longer in that\nland and keep the possessions of both there, but the\nworthy warriors had to seek broader seats elsewhere.                1895\nThere were often dissensions among the followers of the\nsteadfast heroes, quarrels among the herdsmen. Then\nthe blessed Abraham, mindful of their honor, began to\nspeak fairly to Loth:                                               1900\n\n\"I am thy father's born brother, thou art my nephew;\nquarrels shall not wax great between us, nor anger\ngrow: may God forbid that! But we are blood-re-\nlations: between us shall nothing be except, most fit-              1905\ntingly, long-enduring love. Now bethink thee, Loth,\nthat about our borders dwell mighty men, powerful\npeoples with lords and vassals, the Cananite and Feretite\nnations, with energetic warriors: their landed property             1910\nwill not make any more room for us. Therefore shall\nwe remove our differences from this place and seek\nbroader dwelling-places for ourselves: I speak what is\nbest for us both, son of Aron, a true saying. I leave               1915\nthe choice to thee, dear friend. Ponder with thyself\nand consider in thy heart in which direction thou wilt\ntake thy departure, go forth with thy herds: now I have\nyielded thee the choice!\"\n\nThen Loth left him to seek land by the Iordan, fertile              1920\ncountry: it was refreshed with waters and enriched with\nfruits, bright with rivers, and like to the earthly par-\nadise of God, until God the Saviour because of men's                1925\nsins gave Sodoma and Gomorra to destruction, to the\ndark flames. So the son of Aron chose his dwelling-\nplace there, a settlement in the city of Sodoma, and\nbrought[24] thither all his possessions, rings and private          1930\nproperty from Bethlem, goods, and wrought gold. For\nmany years thereafter he dwelt by the Iordan: fair\ndwelling-places were there, but vicious men also, hateful\nto the Lord. The people of Sodoma were bold in sin,                 1935\nshameful in their deeds: they brought upon themselves\neternal woe. Loth would never adopt the customs of\nthe country, but he always eschewed the habits of this\npeople, [their] evil and sin, even though he had to live            1940\nin their land, and kept himself pure, virtuous, and pa-\ntient, even in this nation, just as if--mindful of [his\nLord's] teaching--he did not know what these people\nwere doing.\n\nAbraham dwelt by the habitations of the Cananites:                  1945\nthe King of the Angels, Lord of mankind, held him under\nhis protection, with abundance of good things and\nworldly treasures, love and joy; therefore the races of             1950\nmen, children of baptism, sing his praise widely under\nthe clouds. Pious and prudent, he freely obeyed the\nLord in his land as long as he enjoyed the heritage:\nnever need a defenceless human being ever become in\nany way a terrified and fearful man before the Lord,                1955\nif he will always, until his departure from life, thank\nHim heedfully in speech and in heart, by word and deed,\nwith wise mind after every favor.[25]\n\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\n\nThen I found that the king of the Elamites, Orlahomar,              1960\na pious leader, made an expedition: in aid of him Am-\nbrafel set forth from Sennar with a great multitude.\nFour kings then set out with mighty power to seek                   1965\nSodoma and Gomorra, southward from there. Then was\nthe country of the men by Iordan widely besieged by\nwarriors, the land [was surrounded] by foes. Many\na terrified pale-cheeked maiden would have to go trem-              1970\nbling to the embrace of a stranger: the defenders of\nthe brides and rings would fall, weak with wounds.\nAgainst them with warlike zeal five kings came forth                1975\nfrom the south, with their armies, who wished to rid\nthe city of Sodoma of its foes: for twelve winters before\nof necessity they had had to yield tribute and pay\nindemnity to the men of the north, until the people\nno longer would enrich the king of the Elamites with                1980\ntheir own treasures, but revolted from him.\n\nIn rage the slaughter-hordes came together: the jav-\nelins were loud; the dark fowl sang among the flying\nweapons, the dewy-feathered [raven] looked for the slain.           1985\nThe warriors rushed on in cohorts with unfaltering cour-\nage, until the nations' armies had come together widely,\nfrom south and north, protected by their helmets. There\nwas bitter struggle, exchanges of deadly spears, great              1990\ntumult of war, loud din of conflict. The heroes drew\nfrom the sheath with their hands the ring-mailed sword,\nkeen of edge. Then was booty easy to find for the\nchieftain who before this was not readily sated with                1995\nbattle! The northern men were fatal to the southern\nmen: the men of Sodoma and Gomorra, dispensers of\ngold, were bereft of their dear allies at the shield-clash-\ning. They went forth from their homesteads to save                  2000\nthemselves by flight; behind them the youths of the race\nfell, slain by the sword, [and] their allies [were] cleft with\nthe edge. The leader of the army of the Elamites had                2005\nvictory in battle, was master of the battlefield. The\nsurvivors of the weapons fled to seek fastnesses. The\nenemy seized upon gold, robbed with devastation the\ntreasure-cities of the people, Sodoma and Gomorra. Then\nmisery requited the great strongholds; the maidens,                 2010\nwives, and widows, deprived of friends, departed from\ntheir homesteads. The enemy led out with them from\nthe city of Sodoma, with their spoils, the kinsman of\nAbraham.\n\nWe may now relate this true history further, as to\nwhat was the fate of the war-wolves after the battle,               2015\nwho carried off Loth and the goods of the people, the\ntreasures of the southlanders, [and] exulted in victory.\n\nA warrior, a survivor of the sword who was spared\nin battle, escaped from them suddenly, to seek Abraham:             2020\nhe reported to the Ebrew chieftain the outcome of the\nfray,--the people of Sodoma sorely stricken, the nation's\nwealth, and Loth's situation. Thereupon Abraham re-\nported the evil tidings to his friends; the steadfast hero          2025\nrequested aid of his favorite companions, Aner, Mamre,\nand thirdly Escol, saying that it would be gall to his\nheart and bitterest grief if his nephew should have to              2030\nsuffer slavery: bade the warriors famed in battle think of\nsome plan so that his dear kinsman might be freed, the\nhero with his bride. In reply the three brothers, famed\nin war, with great readiness assuaged his grief by their            2035\nhardy words, and pledged their troth to Abraham that\nthey would avenge his injury upon his foes, with him,\nor else fall in battle.\n\nThen the holy man bade his companions take their                    2040\nweapons: he found there 318 spear-bearing warriors,\nloyal to their ruler, of whom he knew that every one\ncould well support the tawny linden-shield in an onset.             2045\nSo Abraham set out with the three chieftains who had\njust pledged their troth to him, and the band of their\nfollowers. He wished to rescue his kinsman at least,\nLoth, from suffering.[26] These warriors were famous:\nthey bore their shields forth boldly on the march. The              2050\nwar-wolves, [meanwhile], had nearly reached their\ncamping-place: then the prudent man, the son of Thare,\nspoke to his war-leaders in these words, (great was his\nneed!), that they[27] should advance on the enemy in two            2055\ndivisions with grim conflict and hard swordplay: said,\n[further], that the Holy Lord Everlasting might easily\ngive him success in the spear-fight.\n\nThen I heard how under the cover of night the heroes                2060\nventured on into battle: the din of shields and shafts\narose in their sleeping-quarters, the slaughter of archers\nand impact of battle-arrows; sharp swords smote hate-\nfully under the breast of men, and the bodies of foes               2065\nfell thickly, where the exulting heroes and comrades\nwere bringing together the spoil. Victory, men's glory\nin war, turned aside again from the battle of the north-\nmen. Abraham gave armed conflict and not in any                     2070\nwise wrought gold, as ransom for his nephew; he slew\nand felled the enemy in fair fight: to aid him, the Guard-\nian of the heavenly kingdom took [a part in the fray].\nThe four armies were put to flight, [with] the kings and\nleaders of the people: behind them pressed the joyful               2075\nband and [there] the heroes were slain; the others were\ngiven over to flight,--those who had stolen the gold of\nSodom and Gomorra, and robbed the stewards: fiercely did            2080\nthe uncle of Loth requite them for it. The noble leaders\nof the Elamites were fleeing, bereft of power, until they\nwere not far from Domascus. Then Abraham set out on                 2085\nthe war-track to see the retreat of the wicked men. Lot\nwas freed, the chieftain with his possessions, [while] the\nwomen [and] wives were restored to joy. Far and wide\nthey saw the birds of prey rending the murderers of free-\nmen in sword-slaughter. Abraham brought back again                  2090\nthe treasure and brides of the southlanders, the children\nof the nobles nearer their homes, the maidens to their\nfamilies. Of all men living here [on earth], no one ever\nachieved a more worthy military expedition with a                   2095\nsmall force which was attacking so great a multitude.\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\n\nThen the people of Sodoma was southward from\nthere, to bear the news as to what rout of their fierce\nfoes had occurred. Forthwith the king of the people,\nbereft of his nobles and stripped of friends, went out to\nmeet Abraham; he brought with him the master of the                 2100\ntreasure of Solomia: that was the great Melchisedec,\nbishop of the people. He came with gifts to greet fairly\nthe prince of the warriors, [to approach] Abraham honor-            2105\nably, and he pronounced upon him the blessing of God\nand spoke thus:\n\n\"Highly wert thou exalted among the number of heroes\nbefore the eyes of Him who gave thee the glory of the ash-\nspear in battle: that is God himself, who mightily de-\nstroyed the forces of the hostile armies and let thee with          2110\nthy weapons hew out bloody paths broadly [through the\nfoe], regain the booty, and fell the warriors. They were\nencamped by the way: nor could the withdrawing army\nprevail in hand-to-hand conflict, but God put it to flight,         2115\nwho with His own hands preserved thee with thy warriors\nin the fight, against the terror of superior numbers, and\n[so likewise] the sacred pledge [preserved thee] which thou\nrightfully holdest with the Keeper of the skies.\"\n\nWith his own hand the hero gave him a return for this               2120\nblessing, and Abraham bestowed upon the bishop of God\nthe value of every tenth part of the army's booty. Then\nspoke the war-king, ruler of Sodoma, bereft of his people,\nto Abraham, (to him mercy was needful):                             2125\n\n\"Give me back the maidens of my people, whom thou\nby the might of thy army hast snatched from the deadly\nbonds of the foe. Keep thou the wrought gold which\nformerly was the property of our people, [keep] the                 2130\nherds and the treasure. Only let me lead back again\nin freedom, to their hearths and desolated homes, the\nchildren of the people, the wives and boys and wretched\nwidows. The young men, my companions, who should have               2135\nheld the borders with me, are dead, [all] but a very few.\"\n\nThen Abraham answered him straightway, in the pres-\nence of the chieftains exalted in valor, power, and vic-\ntory, and nobly said:\n\n\"Ruler of the people, I pledge to thee this my word,                2140\nbefore the Holy One who is sole Master of heaven and\nthis earth: there is no worldly treasure that I will take\nfor my own, neither riches nor money of thine which I\nhave rescued from the [hostile] bowmen, O great king,\nprotector of thy nobles, lest thou oft hereafter say that           2145\nI became rich on earth through the treasure and former\nwealth of the kingdom of Sodom;[28] but thou shalt\ntake hence the booty which I regained for thee in battle,           2150\nall except the shares of these noble warriors, Aner, and\nMamre, and Escol. I am unwilling to deprive these\nwarriors of their rights: for they stood by me in the\ncombat, and fought in your behalf. Go now and take\nhome the wrought gold and the beloved maidens, the                  2155\nwomenfolk of thy people. Thou needst not fear for\na while the attack of the hostile warriors, the battle\nof the northmen, for the birds of prey sit all smeared\nwith blood, among the fastnesses of the mountains, well             2160\ngorged with the slaughter of the armies.\"\n\nSo the king set out on his return home with the spoils\nwhich the pious lord of the Hebrews, regardful of honor,\ngave up to him.\n\nThen again to Abraham the High-King of Heaven                       2165\nshowed himself, with holy speech comforted the wise-\nhearted man, and spoke to him thus:\n\n\"Great are thy rewards. Let not now thy heart\ngrow idle, thou steadfast [doer] of my will. Nor needst\nthou fear anyone, while thou heedest my commandment,\nfor with my own hands will I shelter and shield thee                2170\nduring thy life-time here against every woe: thou\nneedst not be fearful.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\n\nThen Abraham, famed for his deeds, answered his\nLord and asked Him, in the fullness of his days:\n\n\"O Ruler of spirits, what dost thou give me for free-               2175\nmen's solace, now that I am thus solitary? I have no\nneed to found an ancestral seat for any sons of mine, but\nafter me shall my distant kinsmen dispose of my goods;\nthou hast not given me a son, and therefore sorrows\nweigh upon me very heavily in my heart; I myself can                2180\nnot devise any counsel. My steward goes rejoicing in\nhis sons, and is firmly persuaded in his thoughts that\nafter me his sons shall be the keepers of the heritage:\nthey see that no children are born to me of my bride.\"\n\nTo him then at once God answered:                                   2185\n\n\"Never shall thy steward possess the heritage of thy\nsons: but thine own children shall hold the treasure,\nwhen thy flesh lies [in the grave]. Behold the sky. Count\nthose jewels, the stars of heaven, which now freely scatter         2190\ntheir glorious radiance far and wide to shine brilliantly\nover the broad surface of the sea. Such shall be the\nmultitude of thy descendants, rich in progeny. Let not\nthy heart be bound by sorrow. A son shall yet be born               2195\nto thee, a child born of thy wife by ordinary birth, who\nafter thee shall be the keeper of the inheritance, rich in\nproperty. Grieve no more: I am the Lord, who many\nwinters ago led thee out of the stronghold of Caldea                2200\nwith but few followers, and promised thee a broad\ndwelling-place for thy possession: I give thee now my\npledge, man of the Hebrews, that many a broad land\non this earth shall be peopled with thy progeny, regions            2205\nof the world as far as Eufrates even from the borders\nof Egypt, as many men and as wide a kingdom as the\nNile cuts off and the sea bounds: all this shall thy sons           2210\nown, each of the countries, as these three waters sur-\nround with their streams the lofty cities of stone, the\nfoamy floods [surround] the refuge of the people.\"\n\nThen Sarra was grieved at heart that no son had come                2215\nto Abraham through their wedlock, a free-born heir for\ntheir solace; so the sorrowful one began to speak to her\nhusband in these words:\n\n\"The Ruler of heaven has denied me this, that I                     2220\nmight augment the number of thy family under the\nskies with sons of thine own. Now I am hopeless that\nan heir will ever be given us together: I am too old, in\nmy misery. My lord, do as I bid thee. Here is a                     2225\nwoman, a fair damsel, an Egiptian maid in our possession:\nbid her now repair to thy bed forthwith, and see if\nthe Lord will allow any heir for thy goods to come into             2230\nthe world through this woman!\"\n\nThen the holy man yielded to the advice of his wife,\nand bade the handmaiden go to his couch as a bride.[29]             2235\nHer spirit exalted itself, when she had become pregnant\nwith a man-child by Abraham; stiff-necked in scorn she\nbegan to despise her mistress, showed insolence, was\noverweening, and was unwilling to endure servitude but              2240\nboldly began to resist Sarra strongly.\n\nThen I heard how the wife spoke to her husband in the\nsorrow of her heart, with these words; sad in mind she\nspoke, and said bitterly:\n\n\"Thou dost not deal properly and rightfully with me.                2245\nThou hast hitherto allowed it to happen that my hand-\nmaiden afflict me every day by deed and word, ever\nsince Agar entered thy bed in place of thy wife, as was\nmy entreaty: she shall pay for this mercilessly, if I               2250\nmay still control mine own before thee, dear Abraham;\nof this may the Almighty Lord of Lords be judge\nbetween us two!\"\n\nThe wise-minded man then answered her at once in                    2255\nthese words:\n\n\"Never shall I leave thee without honor, while we\nboth live; but thou must manage thine own maid as\npleases thy heart!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\n\nThen Abraham's queen became unkind, wrathful in                     2260\nheart towards her serving-maid, hard and cruel, spoke\nbitter insults to the woman. Thereupon the latter fled\nfrom threat and thraldom: she would not endure evil\nand retribution for what she had formerly done to Sarra,            2265\nbut went forth on a journey to go into the wilderness.\nThere a servant of glory, an angel of the Lord, found her\nsorrowing; he eagerly asked her:\n\n\"Whither do you intend to push your journey, my                     2270\npoor woman? Sarre owns thy service!\"\n\nShe answered him at once:\n\n\"Deprived of every pleasure, jeered out of the house\nby the hatred of my mistress, I have fled from woes,\nafflictions, and injuries. Now with tear-stained cheek\nmust I await my fate[30] in the wilderness, [the time]              2275\nwhen hunger or a wolf removes life and sorrow together\nfrom my heart.\"\n\nThen the angel answered her:\n\n\"Seek not thou in flight far hence to avoid thy con-                2280\ncubinage, but return again, earn honor for thyself, begin\nsubmissively to cultivate dutifulness, become dear to\nthy master. Thou shalt, Agar, bring a son into the world\nto Abraham: with my word I tell thee now that this                  2285\nman-child shall be called Ismahel, among men. He\nshall be rough, warlike, hostile to the races of men and\nto his own kinsfolk: many a one shall struggle against              2290\nhim in wrath, with assault of arms. From this prince\nnations shall spring, numberless peoples. Depart now\nto seek thy master again: live with those who own thee!\"\n\nIn accordance with the angel's command, she at once\nreturned to her lord, as the holy spirit-messenger of God           2295\nbade her, in sapient speech. Thus was Ismael born to\nAbraham, even when he had [lived] 86 winters in the\nworld. The son grew and flourished, as the angel, the               2300\ntrue minister of peace, had promised to the woman by\nhis own word.\n\nAbout thirteen years after that, the Lord and Ever-\nlasting King spoke with Abraham:\n\n\"Dear man, as I command thee, so do thou keep well\nour covenant: I will to all time exalt thee in blessings.           2305\nBe thou zealously observant of my will in thy deeds:\nI will still further confirm with truth the pledge which\nI gave to thee as earnest of comfort, when thy spirit\ngrieved. Thou shalt hallow thy household: set a true                2310\nsign of victory on each one of the male sex, if thou wilt\nhave in me a Master or dear Friend of thy race. I shall\n[always] be keeper and sustainer of this people, if thou            2315\ndost obey me in thy innermost thoughts and art willing\nto fulfil my commands. In his infancy shall every\nindividual of the male sex in this race, about seven nights\nafter he comes into the world, be marked for me with                2320\nthe sign of victory, or from the face of the earth be\ndriven far through my hostility, thrust out from his\npossessions. Do as I bid: I will be true to you all, if\nye bear that sign with true faith. Thou shalt possess               2325\na son, a child by thy wife, whom men shall all call Isaac.\nNor needst thou be ashamed of this son: but I will give\nto this man-child my divine gifts, by the might of the\nspirit, abundance of friends, with prosperity. He shall             2330\nreceive my grace and blessing, love and favor. From\nthis prince shall come broad nations, shall arise many\nfamous warriors, keepers of kingdoms, world-kings widely            2335\nrenowned.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\n\nThen Abraham in haste laid his cheek on the earth,\nand with scorn turned over these words in his mind, the\nthoughts of his heart: at that period of time he himself            2340\ndid not believe that Sarra, his grey-haired bride, could\nbring a son into the world to him; he knew well that his\nwife had already numbered at least one hundred winters,\nby actual reckoning. So then, wise in years, he spoke               2345\nthus to the Lord:\n\n\"May Ismael live according to Thy commandments,\nLord, and give thee thanks with wise and steady mind\nand stout heart, doing Thy will day and night in word               2350\nand deed!\"\n\nThen the Almighty King and Everlasting Lord an-\nswered him fairly:\n\n\"Though much worn in years, Sarra shall bring a son\ninto the world to thee; the future shall truly proceed in           2355\naccordance with these words here pronounced. I will now\nbless with my grace Ismael, as thou art petitioner, for\nthy first born, so that he may dwell many days in the\nkingdom of this world with spreading progeny; be thou               2360\nsure of that! But Isaac thy son, the young child who\nhas not yet come into the world, I will distinguish ex-\nceedingly with abundance of joys and every kind of\nriches, in his days, and certainly leave in his heart my            2365\npledge and holy faith, and be kind to him.\"\n\nAbraham did as the Eternal bade him, set the sign\nof peace on his son, by the Lord's command, and bade                2370\nevery one of his household of the male sex bear that\nhigh sign,--wise in heart, and mindful of the pledge\nwhich God had given him as assurance of good faith,--\nand then himself received the exalted sign. The Lord                2375\nand Just King continually advanced his glory in the\nkingdom of this world, with blessings: He wrought this\nfor him as soon as he might first perform the will of his\nMaster in [every] expedition....[31]\n\nThen the woman laughed at the Lord of Mankind not                   2380\nat all mirthfully, but full of years she laid away this\npromise in her mind with much scorn: she did not\nbelieve it true that the fulfilment of this promise was to\nfollow. But when the Ruler of Heaven heard that the                 2385\nwife of Abraham had given way to hopeless laughter,\nin her bower, then the Holy God said:\n\n\"Sarra will not believe in the truth of my word:\nnevertheless this decree shall be fulfilled, as I promised          2390\nthee at first. I tell thee truth, at this very season a son\nshall be born of thy wife: when I return to this same\ndwelling another time, then shall my promise of increase\nbe fulfilled: thou shalt look upon a son, thine own child,          2395\ndear Abraham!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIX.\n\n\nThen at once, after this speech, they departed with\nspeed, eager to be gone; from the place of the confer-\nence, the holy spirits made their way (the power[32] of             2400\nlight itself was in their midst!) until they could look\nupon Sodom, the lofty city: they saw palaces tower up\nabove treasures, halls above red gold. Then the right-\neous Ruler of the skies began to speak with Abraham,                2405\ngave him no little information.\n\n\"In this city I hear tumult, the din of sinners ex-\nceedingly loud, the vain-glory of those drunk with ale;\nevil speech have the people, behind their walls: for the            2410\nsins of the race, of the treacherous apostates, are heavy.\nI will now find out what the men are doing, O man of\nthe Hebrews, [to see] whether they [actually] commit\nsins so grossly in their habits and thoughts as they\nperversely speak of crimes and vices: sulphur and black             2415\nflame, sorely and grimly, hotly and vehemently, shall\navenge this on the heathenish people.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX.\n\n\nThe men with their wives were approaching their\npunishment, sufferings within their walls: arrogant in\nriches, they requited the Lord for their prosperity with            2420\ninsult, until the Protector of spirits, the Source of Light\nand Life, would tolerate their offence no longer: but to\nthem the steadfast King sent two strong messengers\nof his, who arrived at eventide at the fortress of Sodoma,          2425\nin their traveling. At the city-gate they found the\nwarrior, the son of Aron, sitting by himself, so that they\nappeared before the eyes of the wise man as young men.\nThen the servant of the Lord arose before the spirits,              2430\nwent forward to greet the strangers civilly, thought their\ndemeanor very proper and agreeable, and invited the\nmen to be his guests for the night. The noble messengers\nof our Preserver answered him thus:\n\n\"For the courtesy which you have extended to us,                    2435\naccept our thanks. In this street we expect quietly\nto wait for the time when the Lord shall let the sun\n[go] forth again for the morning.\"\n\nThen humbly Loth[33] bowed at the feet of the strangers             2440\nand eagerly offered them the repose and refreshments\nand shelter and service of his dwelling. They accepted\nthankfully the benevolence of the good man, and followed\nhim forthwith inside his walls, as the Hebrew chieftain\ninvited them. There in his hall the generous wise-                  2445\nsouled man gave them fair hospitality, until twilight\ndeparted: then came night, after the close of day, and\nveiled with darkness the lake-streams, seas, and broad              2450\nland, and [all] the pomp of this life. Then the men of\nSodoma came, young and old, hateful to God, to demand\nthe strangers, with a great throng so that they surrounded          2455\nLoth and his guests by the multitude of their force;\nthey bade [him] lead out of the lofty hall the holy mess-\nengers [and put] the men in their power; they said\nopenly in words that they would have intercourse with\nthe men shamefully, and had no regard for decency. Then             2460\nLoth, who often knew what was best, quickly arose in his\nhouse, and went out at once; and the son of Aron, mindful\nof his cunning, spoke thus over all the mass of people:\n\n\"Here are within two spotless [maidens], my daughters:              2465\nneither of these damsels knows intercourse as yet through\nsleeping with a man: do then as I bid you, and cease\nfrom this sin. I give them both to you, before you\ncommit this vileness against nature, heinous evil against           2470\nthe sons of men. Receive these maidens and let my\nguests go free, since I will defend them against you as\nwell as I can, before God!\"\n\nThereupon the crowd, the shameless race, answered                   2475\nhim through common consent:\n\n\"It seems very right and fitting that thou shouldst\ndepart out of this neighborhood, thou who bereft of\nfriends and with the step of an exile soughtest this people\nfrom afar, in thy need: wilt thou, if thou mayst, be our            2480\nruler here, the teacher of the people?\"\n\nThen I heard of Loth how the heathen masses gripped\nhim with their hands, with hostile grasp: his guests\naided him well and the righteous strangers drew him                 2485\nout of the clutches of the enemy back within the walls,\nand then speedily closed fast the eyesight of every one\nof the people of Sodoma standing around: the whole                  2490\ncrowd of citizens forthwith became blind; nor could\nthey, in their evil rage, break into the house after the\nguests, as they intended, but the messengers of God\nwere [too] active for them; the stranger had power, irre-           2495\nsistible vigor, and was very severe upon the people in\n[inflicting] punishment. Then the dear ministers of\npeace spoke fairly to Loth, in these words:\n\n\"If thou hast a son, or dear relative, or any friend\namong these people besides these maidens whom we see                2500\nhere, lead out of this city those who are dear to thee, with\ngreat haste, and save thine own life, lest thou perish\nwith these law-breakers. For the Lord has commanded\nus, because of the people's sins, to give over Sodoma and           2505\nGomorra to black flame and fire, and to slay these people,\n[striking] the race in their cities with deadly horrors,\nand so wreak His wrath [upon them]. It has nearly\nreached the appointed time. Set out on thy way, to\nsave thy life: the Lord is merciful to thee....\"[34]                2510\n\nLoth then hastily answered them:\n\n\"I cannot, with these womenfolk, seek my safety\nso far from here in a journey on foot. You manifest\nto me kindness and fair friendship, you grant me grace              2515\nand good-will. I know a lofty town near here, a little\nfortress: leave me there, in honor and peace, so that we\nmay seek safety above, in Sigor. If you will protect that           2520\nlofty fastness from the fire, we can abide in that place\nunharmed, in safety, and so preserve our lives.\"\n\nThen the righteous angels answered him benevol-                     2525\nently:\n\n\"Thou shalt be successful in this petition, now thou\nspeakest about that city: withdraw immediately to that\nfastness. We shall keep thee in peace and safety. We\nmust not wreak the wrath of God upon these law-                     2530\nbreakers and destroy the sinful race, before thou hast\nled thy children and wife likewise into S\u00c3\u00a6gor.\"\n\nThen the kinsman of Abraham set out for the fastness:\nthe chieftain did not spare the pace for his womenfolk,             2535\nbut he pushed his steps most hastily until he had brought\nhis wife and children to the citadel of S\u00c3\u00a6gor. When the\nsun rose, [when] the peaceful luminary of the nations\nwent forth, then, I have heard, the Master of Glory sent            2540\nsulphur out of heaven, and swart flame for the punish-\nment of men, swelling fire, since they had offended the\nLord for a long period in former days: thus the Ruler of\nspirits gave them retribution. Utmost terror seized upon            2545\nthe heathen race: tumult arose in the city, the outcry\nof the accursed race over shameful death, just beginning.\nThe flame seized upon all that it found green, in the rich\ncity, just as around outside no small portion of the broad          2550\nearth was filled with conflagration and terror: trees\nand earth's harvests turned to ashes and embers, even\nas far as the avenging curse direly extended over the               2555\nbroad country of the people. The devastating fire\nrushing on in tumult devoured all things together, far\nand wide, that men had owned in the cities of Sodoma\nand Gomorra: all this, together with the people, God                2560\nthe Lord destroyed.\n\nWhen Loth's wife, his bride in the city, heard the din\nof fire, the death of the people, then she looked back-\nward [to see] this devastation. The Scriptures tell us\nthat she immediately turned into the likeness of a pillar\nof salt: ever since then this statue has stood there                2565\nmotion less (this is a strange story), where she incurred\nthis severe penalty because she would not obey the\nministers of glory in their commands: now, stiff and\nerect, she will have to await her doom in that place, at            2570\nthe Lord's Judgment Day, when the world has com-\npleted its [allotted] number of years. This is one of\nthe miracles which the King of Glory has wrought.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI.\n\n\nThen Abraham went forth alone, at dawn, so that he                  2575\nagain stood in the place where the pious leader had\nformerly spoken with his Lord in words. He saw the\nreek of death and destruction ascending widely from\nthe earth. Riches and feasting preoccupied [the people]\nto such an extent that they had become bold in wicked               2580\ndeeds, eager for sin: they forgot the Truth and God's\ncommandments, and who had given them prosperity\nand wealth in their cities; therefore the King of the\nAngels sent his fervid fire to punish them. Our faithful            2585\nLord then remembered Abraham mercifully, the dear\nman, as he often had done, and saved his kinsman, Loth,\nwhen the multitude perished. The [latter] hero, famed\nfor his deeds, did not dare to tarry longer in the strong-          2590\nhold for fear of the Lord, but Loth departed from the\ncity with his children to seek a dwelling-place far from\nthe place of slaughter, until they found a cave in the\nside of a high dune: there the pious Loth, dear to his              2595\nLord, dwelt in righteousness for a great number of days,\nwith his two daughters....[35]\n\nThey did thus with the drunken man: ... the elder\nof the two went first to her father's bed. Nor did the              2600\nvenerable man know when the two maidens ... were\nwith him in the manner of a bride, fast bound [as he\nwas] in heart, mind, and memory, drunken with wine,                 2605\nso that he could not escape the enterprise of the maidens.\nThe young women became pregnant, and the devoted\nsisters brought men-children into the world, sons to\ntheir old father. One of these noble children was called\nMoab by his mother, that daughter of Loth who was the               2610\nelder in years of life; the Scriptures tell us, the sacred\nBooks, that the younger called her son Ammon. From\nthese princes sprang numberless people, the glories of              2615\ntwo nations: one of these nations all earth-dwellers call\nMoabites, a widely famed race; the other, men and\nsons of heroes call Ammonites.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII.\n\n\nThen the brother of Aron set out with his wife to take              2620\nhis possessions and his household to Abimelech. Abra-\nham told all men that Sarra was his sister, [and] thus\npreserved his life by his words: he knew very well that             2625\nhe had few relatives and friends among that people.\nThen the king sent his ministers and bade them bring\nto him [the wife of Abraham].[36] Thus for the second\ntime in a foreign land, the wife of Abraham was taken               2630\nfrom her husband to the embrace of a stranger. Then\nthe eternal Lord assisted him, as he had often done:\nour Preserver came himself by night to where the king\nlay drunken with wine. Thereupon the Lord of Truth                  2635\nbegan to speak to the king through a dream, and threat-\nened him in wrath:\n\n\"Thou hast taken Abraham's wife, his bride from the\nhero; for that deed death shall tear thy soul from thy\nbreast!\"\n\nTo him thus the sinner, gorged with feasting, replied               2640\nin his sleep:\n\n\"What! Wilt Thou ever, High King of the Angels,\nthrough thy wrath let him be deprived of life who lives             2645\nhere in righteous habits, [who] in his counsel is upright\nin mind, and who asks mercy of Thyself? In her own\nwords, unasked, this woman told me first that she was               2650\nAbraham's sister. I have not sinned against her, nor\nwrought any evil at all, up to this time!\"\n\nThen again the Eternal Lord and True God spoke to\nhim straightway through that dream:\n\n\"Give back this woman to Abraham, his wife, into                    2655\nhis possession, if thou wishest for life any longer in this\nworld, as protector of the nobles. He is good and wise,\nand may himself speak with [God] and see the King of\nGlory. Thou shalt die, with thy flocks and thy sub-\nstance, if thou deniest his wife to the warrior: if he will         2660\nat once honestly and patiently prefer to me thy earnest\nwishes, he may obtain his request that I yet allow thee\nliving to enjoy pleasures and prosperity in thy days,               2665\n[allow thee] in sound health [to enjoy thy] riches.\"\n\nThen the keeper of the people broke forth from sleep,\nbade his councillors come to him; shaken with terror,\nAbimeleh quickly told the nobles the word of the Master.\nThe men dreaded [as retribution] for this deed, blows               2670\nfrom the hand of the Lord in accordance with the dream.\nThe king himself bade them bring Abraham before him,\nin great haste. Then the ruler of the kingdom spoke:\n\n\"Man of the Ebrews! this wilt thou now tell me in                   2675\nwords: what have I done that, since thou broughtest\nthy possessions into this country among us, Abraham,\nthou hast thus bitterly contrived a plot against me?\nThou, a foreigner, wouldst deceive us in this country               2680\nwith evil and pollute us with sin: thou saidest in plain\nwords that Sarra was thy sister, thy blood relation;\nthrough that woman thou wouldst have foully put upon\nme sin, measureless evil! We received thee honorably,               2685\nand in friendship gave thee a dwelling-place among this\npeople, land at thy pleasure: now thou makest return\nand thankest us [most] ungratefully for our favors!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.\n\n\nAbraham then answered:                                              2690\n\n\"I did that, not for evil nor for hostility nor for any\nwoe that I might bring upon thee. But by this strat-\nagem, O ruler of men, I protected myself against blows\nof the fierce sword, far from my kinsfolk [as I was]\nSince the Holy One[37] first led me from the family of              2695\nthe prince, my father, I have sought out many peoples,\nstrange allies, and this woman with me, destitute of\nfriends: I always kept this peril in mind, when some foe            2700\nshould deprive me--a stranger--of my life, who wished\nto have this woman for his own. Therefore I have told\nwarriors in plain words that Sarra was my sister, wher-             2705\never on this earth we have had to contend against\nforeigners in our exile. I did the same thing in this\ncountry, great king, after I chose thy protection: nor\nwas there any knowledge in my heart as to whether                   2710\nthe fear of God Almighty was in this race, when I first\ncame here; therefore I concealed from thy ministers and\nfrom thyself as well as possible the true statement that\nSarra was wont to enter my bed with me as my wife.\"                 2715\n\nThen Abim\u00c3\u00a6leh began to enrich Abraham with worldly\ntreasures and returned his wife to him: he gave him\nto boot, when he received his wife, live stock and bright\nsilver and serving-folk. The protector of the nobles                2720\nspoke further to Abraham, in these words:\n\n\"Dwell with us and choose thee a dwelling-place in\nthis land, a noble site where it is most to thy liking: I\nmust have thee; be a faithful friend to us; we will give            2725\nthee riches.\"\n\nThen quickly the dispenser of treasure spoke further\nto Sarra, in other words:\n\n\"Nor need Abraham, thy lord and master, set it in\nreproach against thee that thou hast trodden the ways\nof my dwelling, O woman goddess-fair: for I have richly             2730\nrepaired thine offence with him, with white silver. Do\nnot trouble yourselves to seek riches and strange friends\naway from this land, but dwell here.\"\n\nAbraham did as his king bade him, and at the ruler's                2735\nbehest accepted friendship, love, and peace. He was\ndear to God: therefore he enjoyed tranquility happily\nand proceeded under the shadow of his Creator, covered              2740\nby His protecting wings, while he lived. But God\nwas still angry at Abimeleh for the sin which he had\ncommitted against Sarra and Abraham, when he sepa-\nrated these two loving ones, the wife and the husband.              2745\nHe received a severe penalty for this deed: for neither\nfree nor slave women could reward[38] the men their\nmasters with children, for the Lord prevented it, until\nthe holy Abraham began to pray Eternal God for grace                2750\nin behalf of his king. The Protector of the Angels granted\nhim his prayer, and restored to the king the fertility\nof the free and the enslaved, men and women; again\nthe Ruler of the skies allowed the number of their off-             2755\nspring to increase, their prosperity and possessions: the\nAlmighty Keeper of Mankind became mild in heart\ntowards Abimeleh, as Abraham entreated Him.\n\nThen the Almighty Lord came to Sarra, as He Himself                 2760\npromised: Our Master, the Ruler of Life, had fulfilled His\npromise to the dear man and woman. A son was be-\ngotten of Abraham upon his wife, whom the Prince of\nthe Angels named Isaac even before the mother was great             2765\nwith child by the chieftain. Abraham with his own hand\nset the sign upon him, as the Lord glorious in splendor\nbade him, about a week from the time when his mother                2770\nbrought him into the world to mankind.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV.\n\n\nThe boy grew and throve, inasmuch as noble [traits]\nwere native to him from his ancestors. Abraham had\n[numbered] 100 years when, to his joy, his wife bore him\na son: he had waited for this for a long time, since the            2775\nLord first through His own word foretold this day of\nhappiness. Now the matter so happened that his wife\nonce saw Ismael playing before Abraham where they\nwere both seated at a banquet, holy in heart, and all               2780\ntheir household retainers were drinking and singing.\nThen the noble woman spoke, as wife to husband:\n\n\"Forgive me, my dear lord, keeper of the ring! But\nbid Agar depart elsewhere, and take Ismael with her.                2785\nWe should no longer be together, for my pleasure, if I\nmight have my way. Never shall Ismael share the\nheritage with Isaac, my own son, after thee, when thou\nyieldest up thy spirit from the body.\"                              2790\n\nThen was Abraham heavy at heart, because he must\ndrive away his own son into exile; then speedily the\nTrue God came to his aid, for He knew that the heart\nof the man was in dire straits. The King of the Angels,             2795\nthe Eternal Lord, spoke to Abraham:\n\n\"Let the sorrow and heart-felt grief slip from thy\nbreast, and obey the woman, thy wife. Bid both Agar\nand Ismael to go away, [send] the boy from thy home.                2800\nI will make his race far-spreading and powerful in the\nnumber of its sons, prosperous in blessings, as I promised\nthee by my word.\"\n\nThen the man obeyed his Master and drove from his\nhome the sad-minded pair, [drove] from his patrimony                2805\nthe woman and his own son....[39]\n\n\"Clear it is and manifest that the True God, the King\nof Glory, is on thy side, since he gives thee the victory,\nwith wise power, and strengthens thy heart[40] with                 2810\ndivine gifts. Therefore thou hast succeeded hitherto\nin whatsoever thou hast begun to perform against\nfriend or foe, in word or deed. The Lord our Master\nthrusteth forward thy desires with His own hands:\nthat is widely known among men. I pray thee now,                    2815\nchief of the Ebrews, by my words, to give me a faithful\nassurance of thy pledge that thou wilt be a true friend\nto me, in return for the good things which I have given             2820\nfor thy glory, since thou camest solitary from afar into\nthis country with the tread of an exile. Requite me\nnow with thy favor, so that I may not be sparing of land\nand pleasure to thee. Be propitious now to this people              2825\nand city of mine, if Our Almighty Lord who holdeth the\nfates will grant that thou mayst further distribute riches\nand pleasing treasures, and set up thy landmarks, among             2830\nthe warriors in this country.\"\n\nThen Abraham gave pledges to Abimeleh that he would\n[do] thus.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV.\n\n\nAfter this the holy son of Thare, chief of the Ebrews,\nwas a dweller in the Filistine nation for a long time,              2835\nalone amid strangers. The Lord of the Angels showed\nhim a dwelling-place which the men dwelling in the city\ncalled the land of Bersaba. There the pious man built\na high hall, constructed a place of shelter and planted             2840\na grove, erected an altar and on the sacrificial stone\nmade an offering, an oblation, at once, to his Master\nwho had given him a prosperous life under the sky.\n\nThen the powerful King began to try this hero,                      2845\ntested stringently what the noble one's fortitude was,\nand spoke to him in stern words with his voice:\n\n\"Go forth now speedily, Abraham, hasten thy steps,                  2850\nand take with thee thine own child. Thou shalt thyself\noffer up Isaac to me, thy son as a sacrifice. After thou\nascendest on foot the steep dune, the bordering circle of\nthat high land which I shall show thee from here, there             2855\nthou shalt prepare a funeral pyre, the death-pile of thy\nson, and then thyself sacrifice thy son with the edge\nof the sword and then burn his dear body with black\nflame, and thus make offering to me.\"\n\nHe did not decline the expedition, but straightway\nbegan to hasten the procedure: the word of the King                 2860\nof Angels was sacred to him, and his Master was beloved.\nThen the pious Abraham forsook his nightly repose,\nwith no resistance at all to the command of the Saviour,\nbut the holy man girded himself with his grey sword                 2865\nand declared that the fear of the Keeper of Spirits\ndwelt in his breast. Worn with age, the dispenser of\ngold began to harness his asses, and bade two young men\ngo with him: his own son was the third and he himself\nthe fourth. Without delay he then set out to lead Isaac             2870\nfrom his own home, the ungrown child, as the Lord\nbade him; hastened exceedingly and hurried forth on\nthe way, as the Lord showed him the paths over the\nwastes, until the glorious beginning of the third day               2875\narose across deep water. There the worthy man saw\na high dune rise, as the King of Glory had foretold to\nhim. So Abraham spoke to his servants:\n\n\"My men! Remain ye here in this place. We shall                     2880\nreturn, after we have offered to the King of Spirits what\nwas entrusted to us both.\"\n\nThe noble man then departed with his own son toward                 2885\nthe designated spot which the Lord showed him, striding\nthrough the forest; the son bore the wood, the father\nfire and sword. Then the man young in years began\nto ask Abraham about the affair, in these words:\n\n\"We have here fire and sword, my lord: where is the                 2890\nnoble victim that you expect to bring as a burnt-offering\nto God?\"\n\nAbraham replied (he had once for all decided that he\nwould do as the Lord directed him):\n\n\"That the True King, Guardian of mankind, will                      2895\nhimself provide, as it seemeth to him meet.\"\n\nThen with unfaltering purpose he ascended the steep\ndune, with his son, as the Eternal had bidden him, until\nhe stood on the crest of the high land, on the [spot][41]\nwhich the mighty, faithful Lord had shown him in his                2900\nwords. Forthwith he began to build the funeral-pyre\nand kindle the fire, and he bound his son hand and foot,\nand then laid young Isaac on the pile, and then straight-\nway grasped the sword by the hilt: he was resolved to               2905\nkill his son with his own hands and allay the flames with\nhis child's blood.\n\nAt that moment a minister of God, one of the angels,\ncalled Abraham from above, with a loud voice. Motion-\nless he answered the angel and awaited the herald's                 2910\nspeech. To him then forthwith God's glorious spirit-\nmessenger spoke from above, out of heaven, in these\nwords:\n\n\"Beloved Abraham! Do not slay thine own son, but\ntake the boy alive from the pile, thy child. The God                2915\nof Glory has spared him. Prince of the Ebrews, through\nthe holy hand of the King of Heaven thou shalt thyself\nreceive recompense and true rewards of victory, ample\ngifts: the Keeper of Spirits will enrich thee with blessings,       2920\nbecause his peace and favor were dearer to thee than\nthine own child.\"\n\nThe pyre stood there blazing. The Lord of mankind\nhad made joyful the breast of Abraham, kinsman of\nLoth, when he gave him back his son, Isaac, alive. Then             2925\nthe holy hero looked about over his shoulder, and there\nnot far from him the brother of Aron beheld a ram\nstanding alone, caught fast in the thorn-bushes. Abra-\nham took this and laid it on the pyre with great zeal,              2930\nin place of his own son, brandished the sword, and dec-\norated the burnt-offering, the smoking altar, with the\nblood of the ram, offered that oblation to God, [and fin-\nally] gave thanks for these blessings and for all those[42]\nmercies which, late and early, the Lord had bestowed                3935\nupon him....[43]\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Thorpe's translation of the _Genesis_, published with his\nedition, in 1828, was not accessible to the present writer and\npresumably will not be accessible to the general public, so that on the\nmere score of availability it seems high time for the appearance of\nanother translation; moreover, in the last eighty-five years critical\nscholarship has produced a greatly improved text of the poem.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Aside from necessary omissions made for _Genesis B_, the\nSections are numbered consecutively in this translation (regardless of\nvagaries in the original MS. numbering), on the assumption that each\nilluminated capital in the MS. was intended to indicate the beginning of\na new Section. After the excision of _Genesis B_, the numbering has been\nresumed with X instead of XV, because the XIII at line 440 in the MS.\nmust really represent VIII.--Cf. Note 8, page 59, inf. (page 199, inf.)]\n\n[Footnote 3: ll. 39b-41a. _Wr\u00c3\u00a6cna_, gen. pl. with _bidan_, = _outcasts_; I\ntake _weardas_ as in apposition with it (the acc. being either a scribal\nerror or an anacoluthon), and then translate _wr\u00c3\u00a6cna_ as an adjective\nfor the sake of idiomatic fluency. For _gasta weardas_ as an epithet for\nangels, though then unfallen, cf. line 12a, sup.--The passage has given\nscholars much trouble and is unsatisfactory, at best.]\n\n[Footnote 4: line 63b. I take \u00c3\u00a6\u00c3\u00b0ele as a form of \u00c3\u00a6\u00c3\u00b0elu = nobilitas,\nprincipatus, natales, origo, genus, etc. Grein's _Sprachschatz_, 1.52.]\n\n[Footnote 5: line 168a. Three pages seem to be missing in the MS.\nDoubtless the remaining events of the third day, with those of the\nfourth, fifth, and perhaps first part of the sixth, days, including the\ncreation of man, (i.e., apparently the contents of Gen. 1.11-2.17,\nincl.) were retold in these pages.]\n\n[Footnote 6: line 186b. This line is apparently imperfect, metrically,\nfor the second hemistich seems to be wanting. As the sense is complete,\nwithout emendation, I have not followed the various scholars who would\ninsert after \"Adam's bride\" some such clause as, \"Whom God named Eve.\"]\n\n[Footnote 7: ll. 221-224a. The text here is corrupt and scholars differ\nwidely in their conjectural emendations and interpretations. Since none\nof their versions is satisfactory or convincing, I venture upon an\nindependent reading. _Hebeleac_, of course, is the Scriptural Havilah\n(Gen. 2.11); _Fison_ is obviously Pison, and _Geon_, 230b inf., is\nGihon.]\n\n[Footnote 8: ll. 226, 227a. I construe _the best_ with _gold and gems_,\nrather than with _sons of men_, because of Gen. 2.12.]\n\n[Footnote 9: ll. 235-851. After line 234 there is a break in the MS.\nSievers has shown that the following 617 lines, called _Genesis B_, were\nwritten and interpolated later, by a different hand, and have Old Saxon\naffiliations. _Genesis B_ describes the Fall of Man and also gives a new\nversion of the revolt and overthrow of Satan. _Genesis A_ begins again,\nat line 852, with the conversation between Adam and Eve and Jehovah\n(Gen. 3.8 ff.).]\n\n[Footnote 10: line 872. I follow the divisions of the MS. This line\nbegins with the tenth large decorative initial, the others having\noccurred at ll. 1, 82, 135, 246, 389, 442, 547, 684, and 821. Where the\neditors so widely disagree as to the proper subdivisions of the poem, it\nseems safer to follow the original initializing (but not the marginal\nnumbering of the original MS.: this skips from VII to XIII at line\n440--doubtless accidentally substituting X for V--and is otherwise\nirregular). Cf. footnote, page vi, sup.--For lines 869-70, cf. _Jour.\nEng. Germ. Phil._, 12.257.]\n\n[Footnote 11: line 1022. A hemistich seems to be missing here,\nmetrically.]\n\n[Footnote 12: line 1125. A hemistich seems to be missing here,\nmetrically.]\n\n[Footnote 13: line 1128. I here adopt Grein's emendation, reading _leod_\nfor _leof_.]\n\n[Footnote 14: line 1137. Cf. Gen. 4.26, with cross-references,\nalternative translation, etc.]\n\n[Footnote 15: line 1150. I follow Grein in supplying _wintra_ to\ncomplete a metrically imperfect line.]\n\n[Footnote 16: line 1199. A hemistich seems to be missing here,\nmetrically; and surely the sense requires the interpolation of several\nlines, to record the birth of Methuselah in Enoch's 65th year. Cf. Gen.\n5.21.]\n\n[Footnote 17: line 1211. We may restore the last word of this line,\n_fan_ in the MS., either as tautological _frean_, with Dietrich, or as\ntautological _feran_, with Grein.]\n\n[Footnote 18: line 1405. I follow Dietrich in reading\n_edniowe = self-renewing_, for the meaningless _edmonne_ in the MS.]\n\n[Footnote 19: line 1492. This difficult passage may be clarified by\nreading _\u00c3\u00b0ry\u00c3\u00b0e = strength, copious power_, in place of the meaningless\n_\u00c3\u00b0ridda = third_, in the MS., and at the same time making _\u00c3\u00berymme_ the\nobject of _h\u00c3\u00a6fde_ (reading _\u00c3\u00berymmas_, if necessary).]\n\n[Footnote 20: line 1549. At least one line is missing, in the MS. here.\nI have healed the breach by altering the case of _w\u00c3\u00a6rf\u00c3\u00a6st metod_, in\npreference to supplying conjectural material.]\n\n[Footnote 21: line 1628a. The difficulty here may be obviated, with\nslight emendation, by letting _F\u00c3\u00a6derne_ modify _yrfestole_, and changing\n_bre\u00c3\u00b0er_, as a genitive plural, to _bro\u00c3\u00b0ra_.]\n\n[Footnote 22: ll. 1852b-1853. I follow Dietrich, who seems to me to make\nthe best of this bad business.]\n\n[Footnote 23: line 1862b. _H\u00c3\u00a6gstealdra wyn_ refers to Pharaoh, of\ncourse.]\n\n[Footnote 24: line 1929a. A hemistich is missing here, in the MS., and a\nverb must be supplied; I adopt Grein's suggestion, _l\u00c3\u00a6dde_.]\n\n[Footnote 25: line 1956b. The alliteration is defective, unless a word\nbe supplied; but the sense may be preserved, without emendation, by\nconstruing _\u00c3\u00a6fter_ with _sped_.]\n\n[Footnote 26: line 2047a. Metrically, a hemistich seems to be missing.]\n\n[Footnote 27: line 2055a. Metrically, a word or two seem to be missing.]\n\n[Footnote 28: line 2148b. Metrically, a hemistich seems to be missing.]\n\n[Footnote 29: line 2234b. _Larum_ here seems to be tautological, perhaps\na scribal error. It might be taken with _bryde_, in an absolute\nconstruction: _after the example_, or _in the manner, of a bride_. The\nreading _lastum_ is supported by line 2715a.]\n\n[Footnote 30: line 2275b.

Grein remarks that a page is missing here from\nthe MS.]\n\n[Footnote 32: line 2400b. I read here _m\u00c3\u00a6gn_ for _m\u00c3\u00a6g_;--cf. line 2494b.\nOr, retaining _m\u00c3\u00a6g_, the line might be translated: \"The Father of Light\nHimself was\" etc. Cf. Gen. 18.1, 16.]\n\n[Footnote 33: line 2439b. Defective metre and sense, owing to the loss\nof a hemistich, but the sense is complete.

Some words are evidently missing here. In the\nbrackets I give the emendation supported by most scholars.]\n\n[Footnote 37: line 2695b.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":773,"split":"train"}
