Following an incident at a party where Sidney accidentally lets a pig loose, he is hired to work for an affluent magazine in New York City. He is hired by Clayton Harding (Jeff Bridges), editor of Sharps magazine, a man Sidney had previously satirised in his own magazine.\nSidney frustrates the staff he works with, first Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), who is only there to pay the bills whilst she finishes her book, then his boss Lawrence Maddox (Danny Huston). He also dares to target the star clients of power publicist Eleanor Johnson (Gillian Anderson). He then meets new rising star Sophie Maes (Megan Fox); however, he is told by Lawrence not to talk to her. Sidney makes it his mission to become a somebody within the business; however, it is almost ruined when he accidentally kills Sophie's dog Cuba; trying to play with the dog, Sidney threw a ball that accidentally went out his office window and as he stopped the dog from going out the window he unfortunately proceeded to cause a vase to fall onto the dog. Luckily, Alison covers for him and nobody else finds out it was him.\nAt a party, Alison and Sidney's relationship strengthens when she reveals she has just ended an affair with Lawrence. Sidney stops her from driving home drunk, causing him to miss his opportunity to sleep with Sophie. At a later party, however, just when Sidney was about to ask her out, it is revealed Lawrence has left his wife and that he and Alison are officially together. In an eager attempt to boost his career, he begs Eleanor to publish a piece on Vincent (Max Minghella), a director he intensely dislikes.\nThe next day at work Clayton reveals that both Alison and Lawrence have left, and he promotes Sidney. Sidney finally becomes successful, attracting all the girls that were previously repulsed by him and even catching the eye of Sophie. The night before the awards ceremony she stated that if he gave her his late mother's ring and she won best actress, she would have sex with him. Going to the ceremony the next day he sees Lawrence, now being someone he used to be, stating that he and Alison split up as she was in love with Sidney. When Sophie is announced as the winner, as she is going to collect her award, he realizes he does not truly love her and asks for his ring back, then, after a heated argument, he steals back the ring from Sophie, and inadvertently (because of anger) reveals that he killed Cuba. A furious Sophie assaults him and a huge fight ensues. After the fight, Sidney leaves, quitting his job at Sharps and heads back to New York.\nHe meets Alison in the park, where they were showing her favourite movie, La Dolce Vita. She has finished her book and the two finally get together, with him giving her his mother's ring. The movie ends with him accidentally throwing the book onto a candle and jumping for it to stop it from burning into flames.\n<html>\n<head><title>How to Lose Friends & Alienate People Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People script, How to Lose Friends & Alienate People movie script, How to Lose Friends & Alienate People film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
