{"ori_id":"0bec3c185ffe7f716108fce8bd4a1558d4cd4a54","title":"Mute Witness","context":"Mute Witness\n Billy (Marina Zudina), an FX make up artist who does not have the physical ability to speak, is in Moscow working on a low budget slasher film directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy (Evan Richards). On one particular night Billy returns to the set to fetch a piece of equipment for the next day's shoot when she is accidentally locked in the studio. Being unable to speak but having the ability to communicate with her sister Karen (Fay Ripley), Billy makes several telephone calls but is interrupted when she discovers a small film crew working after hours to shoot a cheap porno film. Watching unseen, Billy is amused until the performed sex becomes sadistic. When a masked actor pulls out a knife and stabs the actress (Olga Tolstetskaya), Billy reacts and is discovered. She flees pursued by the homicidal film crew.\nBilly narrowly escapes and manages to tell her story to her sister and the police, but the snuff film crew manages to convince the authorities that the onscreen 'murder' was a cinematic special effect. However, the events bring forward Larsen (Oleg Yankovsky), an undercover detective who is tracking the activities of the covert film crew and their connection to a shadowy criminal mastermind called \"The Reaper\". The Reaper (Alec Guinness) is a financier of an international underground snuff ring. He tells the criminal film crew that Billy is a witness and must be eliminated, thus motivating the snuff film director, his thug assistant and a host of subsidiary criminals to retrieve a missing computer disc from her and dispatch it. As more and more factions get involved in killing and saving Billy the action becomes wild and fantastic and hard to discern what's real from movie magic.\n<html>\n<head><title>Mute Witness Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Mute Witness script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Mute Witness script, Mute Witness movie script, Mute Witness film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We hear the sound of a radio with a\n lot of statics. Apparently, someone is scanning the channels.\n After we've heard different channels, the scanning stops on a\n channel with jazz music.\n\n With a loud sound, the credits stop, the black screen moves away\n to the right and is replaced by :\n\n<b> FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b> (it is actually day-time, but the scene in the film being shot is\n supposed to take place during the night. So all the artificial\n lights make us believe it is night-time)\n\n We still hear the sound of the radio.\n\n We are on a film set, even though we don't know it yet. The way it\n is filmed makes us believe we are in a real bedroom.\n\n A bedroom, seen through a window. Nice, clean, elegantly furnished\n and very well lit. Large bed. On the other side of the room from\n the window, a young woman is seated in front of desk facing the\n wall. The young woman stands up, with a paper document in her\n hand. She is wearing thick hoses, large slippers and a man's white\n shirt, which hangs down to the middle of her thighs.\n\n She walks out of the bedroom, to the next room. The window opens,\n and the camera, which acts as the eyes of the intruder, looks\n around the room.\n\n<b>       VOICE ON THE RADIO\n<\/b>       We interrupt this program to bring you a special news\n       bulletin.\n\n The camera moves to the next room :\n\n FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\n A dining-room with a large mantlepiece. In the center of the room,\n a round dining table with four chairs around it. The table is set,\n ready for dinner.\n\n<b>       VOICE ON THE RADIO\n<\/b>       Ernest Strohbecker and two accomplices escaped from a\n       maximum-security ward in Bellevue Hospital last night...\n\n The camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) keeps on\n looking around the room and then focus on the radio set sitting on\n a small table.\n\nClose shot on the radio. The volume of the radio goes up.\n\n<b>       VOICE ON THE RADIO\n<\/b>       ... after brutally stabbing two nurses and a custodian to\n       death. Strohbecker is extremely dangerous, brutal and\n       unpredict...\n\n The radio is suddenly switched off.\n\n The camera moves upward to show us the corridor and the open door\n of the bathroom in the corridor.\n\n       THE YOUNG WOMAN (Voice over)\n       Harry ?\n\n FILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\n Close shot on the mirror, in front of which the young woman is\n standing. She looks a bit surprised by the sudden silence of the\n radio, but very soon goes back to her make-up.\n\nFILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nThe camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) moves along\nthe corridor, toward the door of the bathroom. It stops very\nshortly to look at the young woman, still taking care of her make-\nup, and moves away to look at the open door on the other side of\nthe corridor.\n\nFILM SET - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nA kitchen. There is no light and the room is very dark. Close shot\non the row of knives hanging on the wall. A man's hand takes one\nof the knives.\n\nFILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nThe young woman opens a small closet, temporarily hiding her face\nto the camera. She takes a lipstick and start doing her lips.\n\nClose-up shot on the woman's lips, with the lipstick moving around\nthem.\n\nBack to the mirror, showing the reflection of the young woman. She\nopens the small closet. In the mirror, which covers the door of\nthe closet, we see a man approaching slowly, with a knife in his\nhand.\n\nClose-up shot on the woman's lips.\n\nFILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nHigh-angle shot of the corridor, seen from the ceiling.\n\nThe woman comes out of the bathroom. She sees something, stops and\nwalks slightly backward.\n\n<b>       THE YOUNG WOMAN\n<\/b>       Harry ?\nShe walks to an half-open door and closes the door.\n\n<b>       THE YOUNG WOMAN\n<\/b>       Harry ?\n\nWhen she closes the door, a corpse, who was hidden by the half-\nopen door, falls, face down, on the floor. The woman screams.\n\nThe corpse on the floor. It is a man with blood on his face. The\nwoman bends down on the man and shakes him.\n\n<b>       THE YOUNG WOMAN\n<\/b>       Harry !\n\nShe turns him around to look at his face. We see the white shadow\nof a man coming out of a room.\n\nFILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nA white telephone in the foreground. The girl runs toward the\ntelephone. She dials on the phone. We see the mysterious man in\nthe background, slowly walking into the room, coming from the\ncorridor. The girl has the telephone handset on her ear, but\napparently, she gets no tone. She frenetically taps on the\ntelephone hook to make it work. Then she sees the cut wire on the\nphone and picks it up. The man is coming closer to her. He has a\nblack mask on his face, and a white apron covered with blood.\n\nThe woman sees the man. She drops the phone and walks back until\nshe reaches the wall. She moves out of the room to :\n\nFILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nThe woman walks back until she reaches the bed. The man, covered\nwith blood, has his knife raised above his head. The woman falls\nbackward on the bed. The man raises his knife above the woman's\nbody. The woman screams. The man stabs repeatedly the woman with\nhis knife, and then moves away from the bed.\nFILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nThe man enters the room and takes the mask away from his face.\n\nFILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nApparently, the woman is not dead and she walks to the desk.\n\nFILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)\n\nThe man crosses the room.\n\nThe bedroom can be seen through the large open door between the\ntwo rooms. The woman tries to steady herself by holding on the\ndesk, but she falls down on the floor, and the desk with her.\n\nThe man sits himself on a table, and searches the breast pocket of\nhis shirt for a cigarette.\n\nThe woman crawls on the floor toward the dining room. She is\nholding her stabbed stomach.\nThe man rolls a cigarette.\n\nThe woman stands up, holding on bookshelves set on the wall\nbetween the two rooms.\n\nThe man licks the paper of his cigarette.\n\nThe woman still holds on the bookshelves.\n\nThe man has put the cigarette in his mouth. A hand moves into the\nshot, holding a lit match to his cigarette.\n\nThe woman falls on the floor, with the bookshelves falling on top\nof her.\n\nThe two men, the one who stabbed the girl and Arkadi, the one who\nlit the other man's cigarette, they both look at the woman and\nlaugh.\n\nThe woman crawls out from underneath the bookshelves. She stands\nup, holding on the table.\n\nBack to the two men. A hand comes into the shot, holding a metal\nflask to Arkadi. He doesn't take it and the camera moves on the\nright to a third man sitting near the two other ones. He drinks\nfrom the flask.\n\nThe camera moves to the right of the shot, and the title of the\nfilm appears in white letters on a dark screen. The camera keeps\non moving from one face to another, apparently the faces of the\nmembers of the film crew. And on those faces, we see :\n\nCREDITS (Part Two)\n\nIn the background, we hear the noises of the girl who keeps on\nfalling down and breaking the furniture.\nClose up on a dial. A needle is moving on the dial, on which,\nbesides numbers, is written \u00abGroove Depth\u00bb and \u00abBatteries\u00bb.\n\nThe woman falls down. Since she was holding on the tablecloth, the\ntablecloth comes away with her, and everything that was on the\ntable falls down on the floor.\n\nArkadi and the \u00abmurderer\u00bb are laughing.\n\nClose shot on the face of the sound engineer, with the earphones\non his ears.\n\nBy now, we've started to understand that what we have seen up till\nnow is not real, but is part of the shooting of a film, a strange,\na bit gory film, but still a film.\n\nThe sound engineer shushes the two laughing man down, and looks\ndown at his tape recorder.\n\nClose shot of the tape recorder.\n\nThe camera moves to the right, and shows a female hand writing on\na clipboard, then moves up and shows a large stopwatch hanging\nfrom a cord around the neck of the writing girl. The camera keeps\non moving up to show the face of the writing girl. She is Karen\nHughes, the assistant director and girlfriend of the director. She\nlooks at what is going on around the set and squints her eyes,\napparently not liking it.\n\nThe camera moves to the right and shows the face of Billy Hughes,\nKaren's sister and FX make-up artist.\n\nBack to the actress playing the part of the stabbed woman. She\nholds the corner of a chest of drawer, and makes everything on top\nof that piece of furniture fall on the floor, including several\nbottles of alcohol.\n\nBack to Karen and Billy. Billy represses a laughter behind her\nhand.\n\nClose shot on Lyosha, a young assistant camera operator, looking\nat Billy and smiling. Then close shot on Billy's face.\n\nThe actress holds the drapes of the nearest window. She falls down\non the floor tearing the drapes and breaking the curtain-rod off\nthe wall.\n\nKaren and Billy are both laughing silently.\n\nThe actress gets slowly out from under the torn drapes.\n\nLyosha looks at the actress, and then at Billy.\n\nBilly looks at the actress, and then at Lyosha.\n\nClose up shot on Lyosha's face, smiling.\n\nBilly walks behind Karen's back to the other side of Karen. Karen\nlooks at her, and then looks in the direction into which Billy is\nlooking.\nLyosha keeps on smiling.\n\nKaren whispers in Billy's ear.\n\n       KAREN (whispering)\n       He has the hots for you.\n\nBilly answers in sign language. We understand that Billy cannot\nspeak, but she isn't deaf.\n\n       BILLY (in sign language)\n       For me ? No.\n\nThe actress, half-covered with the drape, drags the curtain-rod\nbehind her.\n\nBilly is smiling and Karen is looking at the scene with her mouth\nhalf open.\n\nClose shot on a smiling bearded film crew member. The camera then\nmoves to the right, to an open ring binder, with a hand following\nwhatever is written on the document. The camera keeps on panning\non the right, showing part of instruments and people's hands,\nwhile we hear some whining noises coming from the actress.\n\n<b>END OF CREDITS\n<\/b>\nThe camera stops on a close shot on Andy Clarke's face. Andy is\nthe film director.\n\nThe actress looks like a ghost with the drape covering her. She\nslowly falls down on the floor, among the mess she has created by\nbreaking and dropping every prop in sight.\n\nAndy looks thunderstruck by what he sees on the set.\n\nClose up shot on the camera. A button just switched off, showing\nthat there is no more film inside the camera.\n\nAndy looks at the camera and sighs.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Cut. Brilliant.\n\nHe puts his hands on his eyes.\n\nThe actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, raises the\ndrape to look at Andy.\n\n       ANDY (yelling)\n       Natasha !\n\nHe stands up.\n\nBoth Andy and Natasha, the interpreter, walks toward the still\nlying actress and squats around her.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here.\nNatasha translates in Russian what Andy just said.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       When I said \u00abmore\u00bb...\n\nNatasha translates.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       ...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.\n\nNatasha translates.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just\n       another victim.\n\nNatasha translates.\n\nThe actress tries to understand what Andy tells her through\nNatasha.\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       You get stabbed. You die.\n\nNatasha translates\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       I want to see the pain.\n\nNatasha translates.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       I want to see the blood spurting.\n\nNatasha translates. Andy turns around to Billy and Karen standing\namong the film crew members.\n\n       ANDY (voice over)\n       Billy, where was the blood ? I want to see her bleed to\n       death.\n\nBilly answers in sign language.\n\n       ANDY (to Billy)\n       Okay ?\n       (to the actress)\n       Okay ?\n\nThe actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, nods her\nhead.\n\n       ANDY (voice over)\n       Let's do it again, folks !\n\nA man yells some orders in Russian. Billy walks to the actor\nplaying the murderer, sitting on a prop. She checks his blood\ndevice. She takes the knife and plugs a tube coming from the man's\nshirt on the knife's handle. She explains, by signs, how the knife\nworks, and he nods. Billy fixes something inside his shirt and he\nreacts when Billy touches his stomach.\n\n<b>       THE ACTOR\n<\/b>       Oh !\n\nHe smiles. Billy squeezes a small bag full of fake blood. She has\njust taken that bag from the inside of the man's shirt. The actor\nkeeps on smiling and Billy doesn't seem to like the man's smile.\nShe puts the bag back inside the actor's shirt. Then Billy signs\nher sister for her to come. Karen joins Billy, who explains to the\nactor what he has to do, and Karen translates Billy's sign\nlanguage.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your\n       elbow.

Another one, a tall man with a beard, talks very\nangrily in Russian.\n\nAndy, still seated on his chair, looks at his Russian assistant.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       What's the holdup ?\nThe angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian.\n\nAndy looks and listens at him and then turns toward his Russian\nassistant, trying to speak, but is cut off twice by the angry\nvoice of the man.\n\nThe bearded Russian man walks away. Then he comes back and shows\nhis wristwatch, saying a few more angry words in Russian.\n\nAndy looks up at his Russian assistant.\n\n<b>         ANDY\n<\/b>         What is he saying ?\n\n<b>         THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT\n<\/b>         He says he's awfully sorry, but he needs at least a day to\n         redress the set.\n\n         ANDY (yelling)\n         A day ?\n\n<b>         THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT\n<\/b>         Yeah.\n\nAndy stands up and slaps his thighs, looking very nervous.\n\n<b>         ANDY\n<\/b>         Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now,\n         and that'll wrap it for today.\n\nThe Russian assistant says a few words in Russian.

So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a\n         slow zoom into the puddle of blood...\nOn another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels\ndown in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk.\n\nOn the lid of the trunk is written, in white large capital\nletters : \u00abKEEP OUT ! BILLY'S BOX\u00bb. Billy opens the trunk. Inside,\non the inside part of the lid, various props, and in the trunk\nitself, a big square plastic bottle and, in a plastic box, plenty\nof smaller bottles.\n\nBehind   Billy, who is still kneeling in front of the trunk, we see\nLyosha   walking around. He looks at Billy, who feels she is being\nlooked   at. She turns around and looks at Lyosha.

Lyosha comes to help Billy pull the\nbottle out of the trunk. They both slowly put the bottle down on\nthe floor. Billy looks up at Lyosha, who is smiling to her. Then\nhe walks away. Billy, kneeling on the floor, opens the bottle.\nKaren walks in from behind the trunk. She leans on the open lid of\nthe trunk.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       So, he's kind of cute.\n\nBilly is pouring a bag of sugar in the bottle.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights...\n\nBilly smiles.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Just a thought.\n\nBilly makes several language signs.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Billy, that's what Mom would say.\n\nBilly looks at her sister.\n\nAnother part of the set, near the entrance of the set. The\nbuilding janitor, wearing a more or less official cap, just walked\nin. Karen sees the janitor and waves at him. Billy looks in the\njanitor's direction.\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Hi.\n\nBilly waves at the janitor, who waves back at the girls. Then he\nyells something in Russian. Billy and Karen look at each other.\nThey seem to understand what he says. Billy shows two finger to\nhim. The janitor says something in Russian and walks away.\n\nThe dining-room set. The young Russian actress is sitting on the\nfloor among the debris she has created and she is putting lipstick\non her lips, looking at her face in a small pocket mirror. Billy\nwalks in with a small plastic case in her hands. She sits on the\nfloor next to the actress and puts the box down beside her. She\ntakes the lipstick and the mirror away from the actress' hands,\nand puts them down on the floor. Then she gives her a little piece\nof white cotton to wipe the lipstick out of her lips. The actress\ntakes it and starts wiping her lips. Then Billy takes some make-up\nto put it on the actress' face. A male hand puts a light meter\nclose to the actress' face.\n\nA strong light starts playing on Billy's face, and we hear a\nRussian voice who seems to come from a loudspeaker.\n\nThe upper part of the film set. Three big spotlights on a rack. An\nelectrician is playing with one of them.\n\nBilly puts her hand above her eyes to try to locate who is sending\nthat strong light on her face.\n\nThe electrician says a few words in Russian.\n\nThe actress looks up to see who is talking.\n\nCloser shot on the electrician sitting on the spotlight rack. He\nis Arkadi, the man who was sitting next to the actor playing the\nmurderer, and who offered him a light for his cigarette. He speaks\nin Russian with a queer smile on his face.\n\nNatasha squats down near Billy and the actress, to speak to Billy.\n\n<b>       NATASHA\n<\/b>       He says use more white like a real dead body.\n\nBilly covers her eyes and looks up at the spotlight rack.\n\nArkadi smiles and winks to Billy.\n\nBilly closes her plastic case.\n\nThe actress eats a piece of cake. She lies down on the floor.\n\n       ANDY (voice over)\n       Okay, Boris, get everyone ready.\n\nBilly, using a pair of tweezers, puts something, which looks like\na cherry, out of a small bottle and into the actress' mouth.\n\n<b>       A VOICE OVER WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT\n<\/b>       Out of frame, Billy.\nBilly stands up and walks away.\n\nThe camera, and the group of people around it. Andy is sitting on\nhis director's chair, and Karen is kneeling on the other side of\nthe camera, writing on a clipboard. A clapperboard girl walks in\nfront of the camera, says a few words in Russian, claps her\nclapperboard and walks away. We hear a loud noise, and most of the\nspotlights are suddenly switched off. Andy looks up at the\nspotlight racks.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       What... what is going on now ?\n\nBilly, standing in the half-dark set with her plastic case in\nfront of her, looks up around her as more spotlights are switched\noff with loud noises.\n\nAlex, who must be the assistant producer, walks toward Andy,\ntapping his wristwatch.\n\n<b>       ALEX\n<\/b>       Andy.

Andy\nwaves his hand at one of them.\n\nAndy and Billy come to a white car parked near a red car. Karen is\nwalking on the other side of the white car. She opens the driver's\ndoor. Billy is standing near the red car, and looking for\nsomething in her purse. She can't find it and looks disappointed.\nShe taps on the roof of her car.\n\nKaren was ready to get inside her car, but, when she hears Billy's\ntapping, she looks up. Billy explains something in sign language.\nAndy doesn't understand and turns towards Karen\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       She needs to go get Strohbecker's face.\n\nAndy claps his hands.\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Ohh !

On the box\nsomething is written in large capital Russian letters. Around\nBilly, a lot of props are scattered around. Apparently, Billy\ncan't find what she is looking for, and sits back on her heels in\ndespair. She hears a loud noise. She sits up when she hears the\nnoise. She tries to figure out what that noise means. She stands\nup and runs toward a window.\n\nThe sky is darker. The night is coming soon. Billy looks through\nthe window.\nOn the parking lot, seen trough the bars of the window, the\njanitor is crossing the yard with his dog.\n\nBilly opens the window and turns around, looking for something to\nhit the metal bars of the window. She takes a spear from a suit of\narmor. Then she bangs on the bars of the window with the long\nhandle of the spear.\n\nOn the parking lot, seen through the bars of the window, the\njanitor keeps on walking around with his dog, apparently not\nhearing the noise made by Billy. Then he closes the main door of\nthe studio parking lot.\n\nBilly drops the spear on the floor and runs away from the window.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nA large corridor.

Andy makes the round\nspice rack spin around very fast and picks up a jar from the rack.\nThen he pours spices from two different jars with both hands, in\nrhythm with the music, miming a drummer beating his drums with his\nsticks. Then he pours tomato sauce from a can into a saucepan. He\nthrows the empty can away.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Yeah !\n\nHe takes another spice jar.

She tries to cover her face from the\nblows she is getting repeatedly.\nLyosha smiles, looking very happy with what is happening on the\nset.\n\nThe woman tries to get the man away from her. She grabs his mask\nand throws it away. Underneath the mask, the man has another black\nvery close-fitting fabric mask hiding his face, which could be a\nblack stocking. He grabs both her hands with one of his hands, and\nholds them above her head. Then he takes a black strong ribbon\nfrom under the bed and ties her hands with it. The woman is now\nvery frightened and tries to get free. The man slaps her very\nhard.\n\nClose shot on a pillow being lifted by the hand of the man. Under\nthe pillow, there is a long very sharp knife.\n\nBilly can't believe what she sees.\n\nThe man takes the knife and slowly lifts the knife above his head.\n\nBilly looks more and more frightened. She has tears in her eyes.\nShe is crying silently with her fist in her mouth.\nThe man start stabbing the woman. Her blood is splashing on the\nwall and the man's T-shirt. The woman is covered with her own\nblood.\n\nBilly starts walking away from the window and across the set.\n\nThe woman doesn't seem to move anymore, but the man is still\nstabbing her.\n\nBilly walks backward across the set and she bumps into a hatstand\nwhich falls down. Everything that was in the open purse hanging on\nthe hatstand - hairbrush, keys, lighter, make-up things, etc. -\nfalls on the floor. A plastic diskette-case skids on the floor and\nslips under a big wooden wardrobe.\n\nLyosha, alerted by the noise, stands up from his camera.\n\nBilly is kneeling on the floor near the fallen hatstand.\n\nLyosha goes back to his camera.\n\nBilly, kneeling on the floor, puts everything back into the purse.\nThen she stands up, puts the hatstand back on its legs and walks\naway from it. She hides behind the large wooden wardrobe. Lyosha\nwalks slowly toward the place where Billy is hiding. Billy walks\naway and Lyosha stops near the hatstand.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThe long dark corridor. In the foreground on the left, the\nstaircase, the only part of the set where there is light\n(apparently coming from the windows and the street lights). Billy\nis running upstairs. She enters the corridor, where she starts\nrunning, just when Lyosha appears in the staircase, running after\nBilly. When he reaches the landing, Lyosha switches on the lights\nin the corridor. Just before Lyosha enters the corridor, in the\nbackground, we see Billy hiding in a nook, a small partition, in\nthe corridor.\n\nLyosha looks for her. Billy seems suddenly interested by something\nup on the wall across from her. It is a sign for an emergency\nexit. Billy looks in the direction the sign is pointing at. It is\nthe emergency exit.\n\nLyosha is coming toward Billy's hiding. He stops to listen for a\nmeaningful noise. He opens a door to look into a room. Billy peeks\nfrom behind her hiding nook. She runs toward the emergency exit,\nwhich is located toward the end of the long corridor.\n\nThe open door, and just behind it, Lyosha looking into the room.\nHe switches the light off, just as Billy reaches the emergency\nexit. He walks out of the room, and closes slowly the door behind\nhim. He looks at the far end of the corridor.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       Hey !\n\nHe walks a couple of steps and stops. He turns around and says a\nfew words in Russian.\nBilly is hiding behind a big red vending machine at the far end of\nthe corridor. Lyosha looks around him and Billy looks at the\nemergency exit.\n\nClose shot on the handle of the emergency door. Then the camera\npans on the left and stops on the red emergency box, with the door\nkey inside. Near the key, is posted a long notice in Russian.\n\nLyosha walks slowly toward Billy. He tries to open a door, but it\nis locked. We hear him talking in Russian.\n\nBilly is still hidden behind the red vending machine.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       Hello ?\n\nLyosha keeps on walking slowly toward Billy.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       Is anyone there ?\n\nLyosha is looking at the far end of the corridor. He crosses\ntoward a door.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       I can explain.\n\nHe opens the door and walks inside the room.\n\nBilly peeks cautiously from behind the machine, and sees the open\ndoor. She runs toward the emergency exit. She breaks the glass\nwith her hand and grabs the key.\n\n       LYOSHA (voice over)\n       Ho ?\n\nBilly runs back toward the vending machine, behind which she hides\nagain.\n\nLyosha walks out of the room, leaving the door open, and looks at\nthe far end of the corridor.\n\nBilly is still hidden behind the vending machine. Lyosha is coming\ntoward her. Billy moves slowly along the wall, keeping her back as\nclose as possible of the wall. She opens a door and enters a dark\nroom. She closes the door behind her.\n\nLyosha reaches the vending machine, and starts running toward the\nemergency exit. He stops near the emergency box with its broken\nglass. He looks inside the emergency box. His finger comes out of\nthe box, with the tip covered with Billy's blood. He tries to open\nthe emergency door, which is locked.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - STORE ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nA dark store room, with large windows. The door opens and Lyosha\nwalks in. He runs to the window. He looks outside, but seeing\nnothing significant, he turns around and walks a couple of steps\ninside the room. He stops and looks around. He starts walking\nagain across the room. Suddenly something catches his eye.\n\nClose shot on the bottom of a long drape. There is a thin space\nbetween the bottom of the drape and the floor. And on this thin\nspace, the tip of a shoe is showing. Lyosha walks slowly toward\nthe drape. He pulls the drape open with a very quick movement.\nSeveral racks of shoes were actually hidden by the drape.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nA door opens in the back of the room and Billy walks in the room.\nThere is some light coming from the door. Billy walks to the main\ndoor of the room and opens it. She raises her arm and grabs the\nbell at the top of the door to silence it. She walks out of the\nroom.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThe long corridor. The lights are still on. Billy walks out of her\nworkshop and closes the door. She starts running along the\ncorridor toward the emergency exit. She suddenly stops, when she\nhears a door opening. She runs back toward the staircase and hides\nnear the entrance of the staircase. In the background, we see\nLyosha coming out of a room. The camera pans toward the staircase\nand Billy. A door opens on the floor below, and the large shadow\nof a man is projected on the wall of the staircase. Billy runs on\nthe other side of the landing, while the man starts climbing the\nstairs. He is Arkadi, the electrician working on Andy's film, and\nthe one who was playing with a spotlight on Billy's face. He is\nbare-chested, which makes us believe he was the poor actress'\nmurderer. He reaches the landing and stops.\n\nBilly is still hiding in a dark corner. She sees Arkadi coming on\nthe landing.\n\n<b>       ARKADI\n<\/b>       Lyosha !\nLyosha is coming to meet Arkadi. They speak in Russian.\n\nBilly looks at the two men, then she moves silently away from\nthem. She reaches the door of the elevator, which is supposed to\nbe out of order, and opens it. She puts the key of the emergency\nexit door in her mouth, and start climbing down the elevator shaft\nemergency ladder.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly climbs down the emergency ladder, trying not to miss the\nsteps.\n\nHer face is now on the level of the bottom of the door of the\nelevator. There is a small gap between the bottom of the door and\nthe floor, which enables Billy to peek at what is going on in the\ncorridor.\n\nA shoe appears in the gap between the door and the floor.\n\nClose shot on the small window at the top of the elevator door.\nArkadi's face appears in the window. He looks around inside the\nelevator shaft.\n\nBilly is not in front of the gap anymore, but hiding in the dark.\nShe puts the key in front of the gap.\n\nArkadi tries to open the door of the elevator. But it is locked.\nThe blood on his hand proves that Arkadi was actually the poor\nactress' murderer. Through the small window, he looks around in\nthe shaft.\n\nBilly tries not to be seen through the gap.\n\nArkadi still looks around in the shaft. He turns his head to talk\nin Russian to Lyosha.\n\nBilly has got the key back between her teeth. We hear the two men\ntalking in Russian.\n\nArkadi's face moves away from the window. Some lights are switched\noff, making the window slightly darker.\n\nBilly moves away from the wall of the shaft and falls. She catches\nthe elevator cables.\n\nClose shot on Billy's face. She is holding the cables. She makes a\nface because of the pain. She doesn't have the key in her mouth\nanymore.\n\nClose shot on a concrete ledge somewhere along the shaft. The\nemergency door key drops on it, then moves away from it.\n\nBilly is trying to climb back up to the door.\n\nWe see the elevator cabin at the bottom the shaft, and Billy in\nthe foreground, trying to climb back up. There is some light in\nthe cabin. We hear some strange noise in the shaft. Billy looks\ndown at where the noise is coming from.\nClose shot on the key, seen through the chicken wire roof of the\ncabin, and resting on the floor of the cabin.\n\nBilly, still holding the cables, starts going slowly down. She\nmisses a step but holds on the cables. She keeps on going down the\nshaft. She eventually reaches the roof of the cabin. We hear\nmuffled voices talking in Russian.\n\nBilly sits down on the roof of the cabin to rest a little. Through\nthe chicken wire that covers the roof of the cabin, she sees the\nkey on the floor of the cabin. She tries to open a panel in the\nchicken wire. It is stuck but she eventually succeeds in opening\nit. She moves the panel on its hinges and rests it against the\nwall. We still hear the muffled voices talking in Russian. Billy\nstarts climbing down in the opening in the chicken wire.\n\nBilly drops down on the floor of the cabin. The front door of the\ncabin is wide open showing the well lit store room in front of the\ncabin. But the cabin is not completely at the same level as the\nroom : it is slightly higher. We hear banging noises in the\nbackground.\nBilly looks at the room and is suddenly frightened by something.\nShe stands up and looks up at the roof of the cabin. She climbs\nback toward the roof. We see Lyosha in the room, walking toward\nthe elevator.\n\nLyosha is coming closer, carrying a large plastic trash bag on his\nshoulder. When he reaches the elevator, he takes the bag down from\nhis shoulder, and drops it in the gap between the bottom of the\ncabin and the floor of the room. The plastic bag drops down to the\nbottom of the shaft.\n\nBilly, lying on the roof of the cabin, is looking through the\nchicken wire.\n\nArkadi is walking toward the elevator, carrying a bag on his\nshoulder, and pulling another one on the floor.\n\nClose shot on the key, which was not actually on the floor of the\ncabin, but on the floor of the room, just outside the cabin. The\nplastic bag, pushed by Arkadi under the cabin, pushes the key in\nthe gap.\n\nLyosha and Arkadi are standing just outside the cabin. Lyosha is\npushing another bag in the gap. The two men then walk away from\nthe cabin.\n\nBilly climbs down from the roof of he cabin and stands up on the\ncabin floor. Seeing Lyosha, she squats down, but Lyosha walks\naway.\n\nBilly climbs out of the cabin. Then she enters the gap and starts\nclimbing down the shaft, using the emergency ladder.\n\nThe bottom of the shaft is full of plastic bags and various\ndebris. Billy reaches the bottom and steps on the bags. She kneels\ndown and starts searching for her key. Suddenly, we hear a very\nloud noise. Billy, startled by the noise, stands up.\nLyosha is looking through the gap at the bottom of the shaft. He\nturns around and talks in Russian to Arkadi.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       Arkadi !\n\nBilly is hiding among the plastic bags.\n\nLyosha is still calling Arkadi.\n\n<b>       LYOSHA\n<\/b>       Arkadi !\n\nHe talks to him in Russian.\n\nArkadi comes near Lyosha with a powerful flashlight, and, with it,\nhe looks into the bottom of the shaft. The light from the\nflashlight is playing on the bags.\n\nClose shot of Billy's face, hidden among the bags. The light moves\nnear Billy's face, then moves to a transparent bag, near Billy,\nwith a head inside. Billy looks up at the bag. She screams\nnoiselessly. Suddenly she turns around, because she has seen\nsomething else.\n\nClose shot of the emergency door key, lying among the debris,\nbrightly lit by Arkadi's flashlight.\n\nArkadi walks away from the elevator, followed by Lyosha. Before\nleaving, they close the outside door of the elevator. After the\ndoor has been closed shut, the elevator shaft becomes completely\ndark.\n\nBilly slowly comes out of the bags. She takes the key. Then she\nslowly stands up, puts the key in the pocket of her sleeveless\njacket and starts climbing the emergency ladder along the wall of\nthe shaft. She climbs just a few step to reach the first door, the\nbasement door.\n\nClose shot of the small window on the door of the elevator, seen\nfrom outside the shaft. Billy's face appears in the window. The\nbasement is completely dark.\n\nBilly tries to open the door, but it is locked. She bangs on it\nwith her hand. Then she shakes it violently. She looks up, on the\nverge of tears. She sighs. Then she hears some steps.\n\nArkadi is coming carrying a powerful lamp.\n\nBilly looks very frightened. The light from the lamp plays on her\nface.\n\nBilly moves away from the door.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nArkadi stops near the locked door of the elevator, puts his lamp\ndown on the floor, and takes a key out of his pocket.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>Billy climbs on the emergency ladder in the shaft\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nArkadi opens the door of the elevator.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly looks very frightened.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nArkadi is kneeling down by the lamp.

Arkadi is coming back, and Billy moves around the\npillar to be hidden from Arkadi's eyes. Arkadi stops near the\nelevator. He opens the elevator's door.\n\nBilly runs away. She trips on something and makes a little noise.\nShe stops.\n\nArkadi, coming out of the elevator, looks in Billy's direction.\n\nBilly opens a door and walks out.\n\nArkadi slowly walks away from the elevator door.\n\nThe door closes smoothly behind Billy.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly is walking rapidly upstairs.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThe door of the set opens and Billy walks in.

It is not permitted to cross Red Square during the night.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       What... what are you doing ? That... that's Red Square.\n\n<b>MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThe car rushes toward the roadblock.\n\n<b>KAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT.\n<\/b>\nWhen he sees the roadblock coming toward him, Andy slides down\nunder the dashboard.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Oh, perfect.\n<b>MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nWithout even slowing down, Karen's car smashes through the\nroadblock. The debris are flying around. And the car keeps on\ndriving full speed toward Red Square.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nWartschuk and his passenger are walking on the empty yard, guns in\nhand. Voices are coming from their walkie-talkie. Several cars are\nentering the parking lot behind them. The cars stop in front of\nthe building. Men carrying machine guns are coming out of the\ncars.\n\nWartschuk directs the whole operation with his walkie-talkie.\n\nA man tries to open the big metal door, but it's locked. He yells\nsomething in Russian to Wartschuk, who answers him and points at\nsomething. Apparently, he tells him to go around the building,\nbecause the man starts running away.\n\nJust outside the parking lot, Karen's car is coming to a stop near\nthe entrance. We hear the Russian voices in the parking lot. Karen\nand Andy get out of the car. Karen walks to the entrance of the\nparking lot and peeks inside. Andy joins her, trying to make his\ngun work.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       This damn gun, I can't work the safety.\n\nKaren shushes him down. They both peek inside, and they are\nsurprised to see such a number of big black cars.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Holy shit !\n\nWartschuk is giving orders through his walkie-talkie. A man with a\nmachine-gun walks away from him.\nBack to Karen and Andy, still standing outside the entrance.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Around the back.\n\nThey run across the entrance. The men, all looking toward the\nbuilding, don't see them.\n\nWartschuk is still giving orders. All the men with machine-guns\nare scattering around the building. Someone is calling Wartschuk\nthrough his talkie. Wartschuk smiles. He walks away from his men.\n\nOn the other side of the studio compound, Karen and Andy are\nentering the place by climbing over the wall. Karen is already in\nthe place and she is helping Andy to join her. For the moment, he\nis sitting on top of the wall and he throws the two guns to her.\nThen he goes down himself. Karen holds his legs.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you.\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       What ?\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       I got you. I got you.\n\nAndy falls down heavily on the ground.\n\nOn a balcony on a near building, a man is watching the yard with a\nflashlight. This is the balcony which Billy fell from.\n\nAndy and Karen are crossing the yard, trying to be as discrete as\npossible.\n\nWartschuk is climbing rapidly up an emergency ladder to meet the\nman with the flashlight.\n\nKaren and Andy, lying low, are coming slowly toward the building.\n\nWartschuk has reached the balcony where the man is watching the\nyard. They whisper in Russian. Then Wartschuk goes inside,\nactually through that same emergency door through which Billy\ntried earlier to escape. The watcher closes the door behind him.\n\nAndy and Karen are still crawling slowly toward the building.\n\nOn the balcony, the man is smoking a cigarette.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThis is the set where the poor actress was murdered.\n\nLarsen is trying to use a telephone on the wall.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       It's no use. All lines are cut.\n\nBilly is watching Larsen. Behind her, we see Wartschuk peeking\nthrough the half-open door.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Where is it ?\n\nBilly shows him the ancient-looking wardrobe under which the\ndiskette is hidden. He bends down. Then he raises and takes a\npiece of wood from a rack. He slides the piece of wood under the\nwardrobe.\n\nWartschuk enters silently on the set.\n\nLarsen gets the diskette out of its hiding place. Billy picks it\nup. Behind her, Wartschuk has got his gun out. Billy stands up\nwith the diskette in her hand. She smiles. Wartschuk grabs her\nfrom the back. She throws the diskette. Larsen catches it.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you.\n\nLarsen puts discreetly the diskette in Wartschuk's pocket.\n<b>       WARTSCHUK\n<\/b>       The Reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all\n       night and witnessed a live snuff.\n\nHe gives his gun to Larsen.\n\n<b>       WARTSCHUK\n<\/b>       He wants you to do it.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you\n       die.\n\nBilly spits in Larsen's face. Then she yells silently, because\nWartschuk is squeezing her a little tighter. Larsen wipes the spit\nfrom his face. Larsen raises his gun, holding it by the barrel.\nBilly looks very frightened, because she knows that Larsen is\ngoing to knock her out. But the butt of the gun lands violently...\non Wartschuk's head, who screams and falls heavily on the floor.\nBilly looks from Larsen to the falling man, not understanding\nclearly what happened.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR\n<\/b>\nAndy is hiding behind a trash can. He looks up at the watcher on\nthe balcony. He finally comes out of his hiding place, but bumps\ninto a beer can lying on the ground. The watcher says something in\nRussian and points his flashlight toward Andy.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Nice night, isn't it ?\n\nKaren is slowly going around the pile of empty film boxes on which\nBilly fell earlier.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just...\nThe watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the\nladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the\nwatcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and\nrolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties\nhis wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy\nseems very happy about the successful operation.\n\nThe Reaper's black limousine is entering the parking lot.\n\nKaren, who has started to go up the steps of the ladder, looks at\nthe limousine.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Who the hell is that ?\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Well, whoever it is, they're coming here.\n\nThey reach the balcony and enter the building.\n\nThe Reaper's car is driving toward the building, with all the men,\nequipped with machine guns, watching his arrival.\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nKaren and Andy are running along the long corridor.

She\nbends down, and makes him bend down.\n\n       THE REAPER (voice over from the talkie)\n       Larsen, are you reading me ?\n\n       KAREN (whispering)\n       Somebody's coming.\n\n       ANDY (whispering)\n       I'm waiting.\n\nDown below, on the set itself, Billy is walking, with Larsen\nbehind her, pointing a gun in her back.\n\n       LARSEN (answering The Reaper)\n       I'm bringing her out now.\n\nOn the gallery, Andy is still trying to work his gun.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Shoot him.

God.\n\nKaren runs along the gallery, while Andy shoots and misses again.\nAnd once again. Then he realizes that the gun is empty and he\ndrops it on the floor of the gallery. He runs after Karen.\n\nDown below, Larsen brings Billy near the big metal door opening on\nthe outside. He unlocks the padlock that he had put earlier on the\nbolt of the door.\n\nKaren rushes toward them.\n\n       KAREN (yelling)\n       Billy !\n\nLarsen pulls the bolt open. Billy is very surprised to see her\nsister. Larsen points his gun at her and yells something in\nRussian.\n\nKaren stops running, but Billy makes large signs to her, signs she\ndoesn't seem to understand. Karen hides, and then comes out.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Stay where you are !\n\nKaren throws a piece of metal at Larsen. The piece of metal hits\nhis hand and he drops his gun.\n       KAREN (yelling)\n       Run, Billy. Run ! Run !\n\nBilly opens the big metal door. Andy runs in to join Karen. Larsen\npicks up his gun, and points it at Billy.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Stand back !\n\nBut Billy is already out of the building.\n\n       KAREN (yelling)\n       Not out there !\n\nAndy grabs Karen and pulls her out of Larsen's gun.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly runs out of the building. An army of men, armed with\nmachine-guns, is waiting for her. The cars' drivers all switched\ntheir headlights on high beams. With all that light in front of\nher, Billy doesn't see anymore where she is going and stops\nrunning.\n\nThe Reaper, still in his car, bends down to look at her. He takes\nhis walkie-talkie.\n\n<b>       THE REAPER\n<\/b>       Kill her, Larsen.\n\nLarsen walks out of the building, and we hear the end on The\nReaper's sentence coming from his own walkie-talkie.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nKaren and Andy rush to the window, to look at what is happening on\nthe parking lot.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly looks at the men in front of her with a frightened face. She\nturns around to look at Larsen pointing his gun at her. Then she\nturns back to the men in front of her, and especially The Reaper,\nlooking at her from his car. Behind her, Larsen aims his gun at\nher.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nKaren and Andy are still looking through the window.\n\n       KAREN (yelling)\n       No !\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nLarsen closes one eye before shooting. He shoots seven times. We\nsee the bullets going through Billy's body from the back, and\ncoming out through the front, making red bloody spots on her white\nsweater. Billy falls down on her stomach, and remains motionless\non the ground with her arms spread apart.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nKaren, still standing behind the window, can't believe what she\njust saw.\n\nThrough the window, we see Billy's body lying on the ground, with\nall the big black cars surrounding her.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThrough the half-open door, Larsen shows The Reaper the diskette\nhe has found on the set.\n\nThe Reaper smiles. The big metal door closes as Larsen goes back\ninside.\n\nAll the men go back inside their cars. The engines start. And the\ncars start driving out, The Reaper's car being the first one to\ngo.\nBilly is still lying motionless on the ground, her blood flowing\nslowly on the tarmac.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nKaren is in Andy's arms, crying.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nThe last cars are leaving the parking lot.\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nAndy, with Karen crying on his laps, looks at Larsen coming back\nin and closing the door.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Now please, let me explain.

Karen hits Larsen very hard with both her fists. Andy picks\nup the gun and points it at Larsen. Larsen pushes Karen away from\nhim. Karen takes the legs of a statue and hits Larsen with it.\nThen she grabs Larsen by the ears and throws him on the metal\ndoor. She turns toward Andy.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Kill him.\n\nKaren opens the door and walks out.\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBilly, still lying on the ground, opens one eye and smiles.\n\nKaren runs out of the building and rushes toward her sister, who\nstands up when she sees her. Karen stops and looks at her. Karen\nsits up and raises her sweatshirt.\n\nUnderneath, she is equipped with the special effect system she\nuses to pretend people are being shot. Little bags, full of fake\nblood, explode one by one, tearing the piece of clothing in front\nof them, and pouring the blood through the fabric. For the\nspectator, it does looks like bullet going through a body and\nblood spurting out.\n\nKaren rushes to Billy and hugs her.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       You genius !\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>Larsen is still kneeling on the floor.

Okay !\n\nHe shoots at Larsen, who doesn't react and walks closer to him. He\nshoots twice more, walking backward. He bumps into a prop and\nfalls down on his back... next to Wartschuk, all tied up and with\na large piece of tape across his mouth. Wartschuk moans, Andy\nscreams and gets quickly up. He rushes out of the building while\nLarsen is trying to get over what just happened to him\n\n<b>CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nAndy rushes out of the building and sees Karen cleaning Billy's\nface.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Billy !

Larsen comes behind her and takes her by\nthe shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something\nin sign language to Karen.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       A cop ?\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       A cop ?\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Oh, my God, I'm sorry.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Sorry.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Forget it.

He turns toward\nKaren.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       What ?\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       That was an invitation to dinner sometime.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       How you say ?... It would be a pleasure.\n\nBilly mouthes the word \u00abPleasure\u00bb and then makes the sign for it,\nwhich is rubbing you stomach. Larsen makes the same sign. Then he\nstops and seems to think about something.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       I still don't understand.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       What ?\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       I don't understand why The Reaper didn't take the diskette\n       off me.\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Who ?\n\nThe sound of a shot, and a blood bag explodes under Billy's\nsweater. Karen screams. Since she was just in front of Billy, her\nface is covered with fake blood. Andy looks at them, the remote\ncontrol in his hand.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Whoops !... Shit. I'm sorry.\n\nThey all look at him. Larsen smiles.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Big cowboy.\n\nA little later.\n\nAndy drives his car near the entrance of the building. Billy walks\ntoward the car, looking at Wartschuk, his mouth still gagged,\nbeing forced by Larsen to go inside his car. He moans\nincomprehensible words, and seems not to want to get inside the\ncar.\n\nAndy waves to Larsen.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       Ciao !...\n\nAndy opens the back door of his own car to let Billy inside. But\nshe doesn't climb in, still surprised by Wartschuk's attitude.\n\nFinally, Larsen succeeds in putting his prisoner in the back of\nhis car, where another prisoner, also gagged, is already waiting\n(certainly the man that Andy had handcuffed earlier on the\nemergency ladder).\n\nBefore climbing into the driver's seat, Larsen waves to Billy.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Billy, tomorrow !\n\nHe makes the \u00abpleasure\u00bb sign. Billy waves back to him.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Tomorrow !\n\nBilly looks at Wartschuk inside the car. She seems worried.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       What's the matter ?\n\nBilly makes several signs. Andy doesn't understand, but he looks\nat Larsen. Larsen smiles back to him.\n\n<b>       LARSEN\n<\/b>       Big cowboy.\n\nKaren is already seated in the car, and doesn't understand the\nreason for the delay.\n\n<b>       KAREN\n<\/b>       Guys, could we get out of here, please ?\n\nClose shot on Wartschuk's face, who is trying to tell them\nsomething.\n\nAndy eventually understand what Billy is trying to tell him. It is\nthe word he learned earlier in the restaurant.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       The expression ?\n\nBilly nods \u00abYes\u00bb. Larsen smiles to her and starts his car. Billy\nslams violently on the roof of Andy's car. She seems frightened by\nsomething. She yells silently.\n\n<b>       ANDY\n<\/b>       The car ?\n\nBilly keeps on yelling silently and moving her arms.

Get out of the car !\n\nWatching Billy and Andy, Larsen has suddenly a worried look on his\nface. He is beginning to understand that something is wrong. He\ngets out of his car, walks a few steps, and then his car explodes\nand he falls on the ground.\n\nAndy, Billy and Karen, who is now out of her car, they all look at\nthe car burning and at the motionless Larsen lying on the ground.\nBilly looks very sad.\n\nBut, slowly, Larsen begins to move. He sits up and looks at Billy.\n\nBilly is crying and smiling at the same time. We get to understand\nshe must be in love with Larsen.\n\n<b>CREDITS\n<\/b>\nWhite letters on a black screen.\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Mute-Witness.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Mute Witness<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Anthony Waller\" title=\"Scripts by Anthony Waller\">Anthony Waller<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Mute Witness Script.html#comments\" title=\"Mute Witness comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":50,"split":"train"}
