{"ori_id":"a49568c001cfa6403a22f0138c5668d8b211c9e8","title":"Django Unchained","context":"Django Unchained\n In 1858 Texas, the Speck brothers, Ace and Dicky, drive a group of black slaves on foot. Among the shackled slaves is Django (Jamie Foxx), sold off and separated from his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from D\u7aefsseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a group of outlaws for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant. Schultz, a superior gunslinger, immediately kills Ace with a Fast draw. King insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him at the mercy of the newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down. After tracking and killing the Brittles, the liberated Django partners with Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and felt morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill for good luck.\nIn 1859, Django and Schultz travel to Mississippi, where they learn the identity of Broomhilda's owner: Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called Mandingo fights. Schultz and Django meet Candie at his gentleman's club in Greenville and submit their offer to buy one of his best fighters. Intrigued, Candie invites them to his ranch at Candyland. After secretly briefing the German-speaking Broomhilda, Schultz claims to be charmed by her and offers to buy her as well. During dinner, Candie's staunchly loyal house slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) becomes suspicious of Schultz and Django's motives. Deducing that Django and Broomhilda know each other and that the sale of the Mandingo fighter is a ruse, Stephen alerts Candie and admonishes him for his greed. Candie offers an alteration of the original deal, with Broomhilda taking the Mandingo fighter's place at the same price, and threatens her death should the deal be rejected. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Candie smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake, which Schultz initially refuses. When Candie threatens again to kill Broomhilda, Schultz snaps and kills Candie with a concealed derringer. Candie's bodyguard Butch Pooch kills Schultz and Django kills him in turn, and an extensive gunfight begins. Django guns down a great number of his opponents, but surrenders when Broomhilda is taken hostage.\nThe next morning, Stephen tells Django that he will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route to the mine, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them the handbill that Schultz said was good luck from his first kill. He convinces them that there is a large bounty for criminals hiding at Candyland, and promises that they would receive the majority of the money if they free him. The escorts release him and give him a pistol, which he uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of dynamite.\nAt the plantation, Django kills more of Candie's henchmen, takes Broomhilda's freedom papers from the dead Schultz's pocket, bids goodbye to his late friend and frees his wife from a nearby cabin. When Candie's mourners return from his burial, Django kills the remaining henchmen and Candie's sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen. Django then ignites the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion, and he and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes with the incapacitated Stephen inside, before riding off together.\n<html>\n<head><title>Django Unchained Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Django Unchained script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Django Unchained script, Django Unchained movie script, Django Unchained film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

                    Written by\n\n                                     Quentin Tarantino\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                         I\n<\/b>\n<b>          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY\n<\/b>\n          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own\n          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless\n          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,\n          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.\n\n          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,\n          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just\n          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville\n          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,\n          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).\n\n          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg\n          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small \"r\" burned into his\n          cheek (\"r\" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which\n          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.\n\n          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery\n          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering\n          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet\n          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the\n          skin off ankles.\n\n          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.\n          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the\n          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most\n          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters\n          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the\n          Greenville Auction.\n\n<b>                         DJANGO\n<\/b>          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the\n          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.\n\n          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,\n          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he\n          hears the Auctioneer yell; \"Sold.\" Then she's taken away to whereabouts\n          unknown, never to be seen again.\n\n          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;\n\n          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN\n          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed\n          for forty.\n\n          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him\n          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area\n          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the\n          structure.\n\n          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front\n          of the auction block.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                         2\n<\/b>\n<b>                         DJANGO\n<\/b>          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS\n          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing\n          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on\n          the block.\n          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full\n          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.\n\n<b>                         DJANGO\n<\/b>          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white\n          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.\n\n          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK\n          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on\n          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to\n          buy Niggers, who look up to him.\n          His heart fills with poison.\n\n<b>          BACK TO DJANGO\n<\/b>          walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the\n          blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.\n\n<b>          THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE\n<\/b>          end.\n\n\n<b>          \/--\" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing\n          their black skinned cargo forward.\n          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to\n          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed\n          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on\n          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.\n          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,\n          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the\n          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and\n          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,\n          resemble a human locomotive.\n          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck\n          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white\n          fur collars.\n\n<b>          WHEN...\n<\/b>          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road.
