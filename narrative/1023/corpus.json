The crew are whale hunters that voyage every year down to New Zealand. After an unsuccessful season of hunting, as they plan to return the wife of the owner of the hunting firm, Mrs Weldon, her five-year-old son Jack Weldon and her cousin, B\u00e9n\u00e9dict, an entomologist ask for a return passage to San Francisco. Several days into the journey they save five shipwrecked passengers from another ship and a dog who was with them at the time (Tom, Act\u00e9on, Austin, Bat, Nan, Hercule and Dingo (the dog)). Towards the end of their passage, they notice a whale and the crew, hoping for some profit after a bad season, decide to hunt it. Captain Hull reluctantly leaves Dick responsible for the ship. But the hunt goes awry and all the crew members are killed. Now Dick is left in charge of the ship with no experienced sailors to help him. He tries to teach the five survivors of the shipwreck and tries to reach the coast of South America, but Negoro, the ship's cook manages to trick them, breaking one of their compasses and their speed measuring device and eventually, after making sure the rest were lost, leads them to equatorial Africa.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Dick Sands the Boy Captain, by Jules Verne\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

She was\na schooner, the property of James W. Weldon, a wealthy Californian\nship-owner who had fitted her out at San Francisco, expressly for the\nwhale-fisheries in the southern seas.\n\nJames Weldon was accustomed every season to send his whalers both to\nthe Arctic regions beyond Behring Straits, and to the Antarctic Ocean\nbelow Tasmania and Cape Horn; and the \"Pilgrim,\" although one of the\nsmallest, was one of the best-going vessels of its class; her\nsailing-powers were splendid, and her rigging was so adroitly adapted\nthat with a very small crew she might venture without risk within sight\nof the impenetrable ice-fields of the southern hemisphere: under\nskilful guidance she could dauntlessly thread her way amongst the\ndrifting ice-bergs that, lessened though they were by perpetual shocks\nand undermined by warm currents, made their way northwards as far as\nthe parallel of New Zealand or the Cape of Good Hope, to a latitude\ncorresponding to which in the northern hemisphere they are never seen,\nhaving already melted away in the depths of the Atlantic and Pacific\nOceans.\n\nFor several years the command of the \"Pilgrim\" had been entrusted to\nCaptain Hull, an experienced seaman, and one of the most dexterous\nharpooners in Weldon's service. The crew consisted of five sailors and\nan apprentice. This number, of course, was quite insufficient for the\nprocess of whale-fishing, which requires a large contingent both for\nmanning the whale-boats and for cutting up the whales after they are\ncaptured; but Weldon, following the example of other owners, found it\nmore economical to embark at San Francisco only just enough men to work\nthe ship to New Zealand, where, from the promiscuous gathering of\nseamen of well-nigh every nationality, and of needy emigrants, the\ncaptain had no difficulty in engaging as many whalemen as he wanted for\nthe season. This method of hiring men who could be at once discharged\nwhen their services were no longer required had proved altogether to be\nthe most profitable and convenient.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" had now just completed her annual voyage to the Antarctic\ncircle. It was not, however, with her proper quota of oil-barrels full\nto the brim, nor yet with an ample cargo of cut and uncut whalebone,\nthat she was thus far on her way back. The time, indeed, for a good\nhaul was past; the repeated and vigourous attacks upon the cetaceans\nhad made them very scarce; the whale known as \"the Right whale,\" the\n\"Nord-kapper\" of the northern fisheries, the \"Sulpher-boltone\" of the\nsouthern, was hardly ever to be seen; and latterly the whalers had had\nno alternative but to direct their efforts against the Finback or\nJubarte, a gigantic mammal, encounter with which is always attended\nwith considerable danger.\n\nSo scanty this year had been the supply of whales that Captain Hull had\nresolved next year to push his way into far more southern latitudes;\neven, if necessary, to advance to the regions known as Clarie and\nAd\u00c3\u00a9lie Lands, of which the discovery, though claimed by the American\nnavigator Wilkes, belongs by right to the illustrious Frenchman Dumont\nd'Urville, the commander of the \"Astrolabe\" and the \"Z\u00c3\u00a9lee.\"\n\nThe season had been exceptionally unfortunate for the \"Pilgrim.\" At the\nbeginning of January, almost in the height of the southern summer, long\nbefore the ordinary time for the whalers' return, Captain Hull had been\nobliged to abandon his fishing-quarters. His hired contingent, all men\nof more than doubtful character, had given signs of such\ninsubordination as threatened to end in mutiny; and he had become aware\nthat he must part company with them on the earliest possible\nopportunity. Accordingly, without delay, the bow of the \"Pilgrim\" was\ndirected to the northwest, towards New Zealand, which was sighted on\nthe 15th of January, and on reaching Waitemata, the port of Auckland,\nin the Hauraki Gulf, on the east coast of North Island, the whole of\nthe gang was peremptorily discharged.\n\nThe ship's crew were more than dissatisfied. They were angry. Never\nbefore had they returned with so meagre a haul. They ought to have had\nat least two hundred barrels more. The captain himself experienced all\nthe mortification of an ardent sportsman who for the first time in his\nlife brings home a half-empty bag; and there was a general spirit of\nanimosity against the rascals whose rebellion had so entirely marred\nthe success of the expedition.\n\nCaptain Hull did everything in his power to repair the disappointment;\nhe made every effort to engage a fresh gang; but it was too late; every\navailable seaman had long since been carried off to the fisheries.\nFinding therefore that all hope of making good the deficiency in his\ncargo must be resigned, he was on the point of leaving Auckland, alone\nwith his crew, when he was met by a request with which he felt himself\nbound to comply.\n\nIt had chanced that James Weldon, on one of those journeys which were\nnecessitated by the nature of his business, had brought with him his\nwife, his son Jack, a child of five years of age, and a relation of the\nfamily who was generally known by the name of Cousin Benedict. Weldon\nhad of course intended that his family should accompany him on his\nreturn home to San Francisco; but little Jack was taken so seriously\nill, that his father, whose affairs demanded his immediate return, was\nobliged to leave him behind at Auckland with his wife and Cousin\nBenedict.\n\nThree months had passed away, little Jack was convalescent, and Mrs.\nWeldon, weary of her long separation from her husband, was anxious to\nget home as soon as possible. Her readiest way of reaching San\nFrancisco was to cross to Australia, and thence to take a passage in\none of the vessels of the \"Golden Age\" Company, which run between\nMelbourne and the Isthmus of Panama: on arriving in Panama she would\nhave to wait the departure of the next American steamer of the line\nwhich maintains a regular communication between the Isthmus and\nCalifornia. This route, however, involved many stoppages and changes,\nsuch as are always disagreeable and inconvenient for women and\nchildren, and Mrs. Weldon was hesitating whether she should encounter\nthe journey, when she heard that her husband's vessel, the \"Pilgrim,\"\nhad arrived at Auckland. Hastening to Captain Hull, she begged him to\ntake her with her little boy, Cousin Benedict, and Nan, an old negress\nwho had been her attendant from her childhood, on board the \"Pilgrim,\"\nand to convey them to San Francisco direct.\n\n\"Was it not over hazardous,\" asked the captain, \"to venture upon a\nvoyage of between 5000 and 6000 miles in so small a sailing-vessel?\"\n\nBut Mrs. Weldon urged her request, and Captain Hull, confident in the\nsea-going qualities of his craft, and anticipating at this season\nnothing but fair weather on either side of the equator, gave his\nconsent.\n\nIn order to provide as far as possible for the comfort of the lady\nduring a voyage that must occupy from forty to fifty days, the captain\nplaced his own cabin at her entire disposal.\n\nEverything promised well for a prosperous voyage. The only hindrance\nthat could be foreseen arose from the circumstance that the \"Pilgrim\"\nwould have to put in at Valparaiso for the purpose of unlading; but\nthat business once accomplished, she would continue her way along the\nAmerican coast with the assistance of the land breezes, which\nordinarily make the proximity of those shores such agreeable quarters\nfor sailing.\n\nMrs. Weldon herself had accompanied her husband in so many voyages,\nthat she was quite inured to all the makeshifts of a seafaring life,\nand was conscious of no misgiving in embarking upon a vessel of such\nsmall tonnage. She was a brave, high-spirited woman of about thirty\nyears of age, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and for her the sea\nhad no terrors. Aware that Captain Hull was an experienced man, in whom\nher husband had the utmost confidence, and knowing that his ship was a\nsubstantial craft, registered as one of the best of the American\nwhalers, so far from entertaining any mistrust as to her safety, she\nonly rejoiced in the opportuneness of the chance which seemed to offer\nher a direct and unbroken route to her destination.\n\nCousin Benedict, as a matter of course, was to accompany her. He was\nabout fifty; but in spite of his mature age it would have been\nconsidered the height of imprudence to allow him to travel anywhere\nalone. Spare, lanky, with a bony frame, with an enormous cranium, and a\nprofusion of hair, he was one of those amiable, inoffensive _savants_\nwho, having once taken to gold spectacles, appear to have arrived at a\nsettled standard of age, and, however long they live afterwards, seem\nnever to be older than they have ever been.\n\nClaiming a sort of kindredship with all the world, he was universally\nknown, far beyond the pale of his own connexions, by the name of\n\"Cousin Benedict.\" In the ordinary concerns of life nothing would ever\nhave rendered him capable of shifting for himself; of his meals he\nwould never think until they were placed before him; he had the\nappearance of being utterly insensible to heat or cold; he vegetated\nrather than lived, and might not inaptly be compared to a tree which,\nthough healthy enough at its core, produces scant foliage and no fruit.\nHis long arms and legs were in the way of himself and everybody else;\nyet no one could possibly treat him with unkindness. As M. Prudhomme\nwould say, \"if only he had been endowed with capability,\" he would have\nrendered a service to any one in the world; but helplessness was his\ndominant characteristic; helplessness was ingrained into his very\nnature; yet this very helplessness made him an object of kind\nconsideration rather than of contempt, and Mrs. Weldon looked upon him\nas a kind of elder brother to her little Jack.\n\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Cousin Benedict was either idle\nor unoccupied. On the contrary, his whole time was devoted to one\nabsorbing passion for natural history. Not that he had any large claim\nto be regarded properly as a natural historian; he had made no\nexcursions over the whole four districts of zoology, botany,\nmineralogy, and geology, into which the realms of natural history are\ncommonly divided; indeed, he had no pretensions at all to be either a\nbotanist, a mineralogist, or a geologist; his studies only sufficed to\nmake him a zoologist, and that in a very limited sense. No Cuvier was\nhe; he did not aspire to decompose animal life by analysis, and to\nrecompose it by synthesis; his enthusiasm had not made him at all\ndeeply versed in vertebrata, mollusca, or radiata; in fact, the\nvertebrata--animals, birds, reptiles, fishes--had had no place in his\nresearches; the mollusca--from the cephalopoda to the bryozia--had had\nno attractions for him; nor had he consumed the midnight oil in\ninvestigating the radiata, the echmodermata, acaleph\u00c3\u00a6, polypi, entozoa,\nor infusoria.\n\nNo; Cousin Benedict's interest began and ended with the articulata; and\nit must be owned at once that his studies were very far from embracing\nall the range of the six classes into which \"articulata\" are\nsubdivided; viz, the insecta, the mynapoda, the arachnida, the\ncrustacea, the cinhopoda, and the anelides; and he was utterly unable\nin scientific language to distinguish a worm from a leech, an earwig\nfrom a sea-acorn, a spider from a scorpion, a shrimp from a\nfrog-hopper, or a galley-worm from a centipede.\n\nTo confess the plain truth, Cousin Benedict was an amateur\nentomologist, and nothing more.\n\nEntomology, it may be asserted, is a wide science; it embraces the\nwhole division of the articulata; but our friend was an entomologist\nonly in the limited sense of the popular acceptation of the word; that\nis to say, he was an observer and collector of insects, meaning by\n\"insects\" those articulata which have bodies consisting of a number of\nconcentric movable rings, forming three distinct segments, each with a\npair of legs, and which are scientifically designated as hexapods.\n\n[Illustration: Cousin Benedict]\n\nTo this extent was Cousin Benedict an entomologist; and when it is\nremembered that the class of insecta of which he had grown up to be the\nenthusiastic student comprises no less than ten[1] orders, and that of\nthese ten the coleoptera and diptera alone include 30,000 and 60,000\nspecies respectively, it must be confessed that he had an ample field\nfor his most persevering exertions.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: These ten orders are (1) the orthoptera, _e.g._\ngrasshoppers and crickets; (2) the neuroptera, _e.g._ dragon-flies; (3)\nthe hymenoptera, _e.g._ bees, wasps, and ants; (4) the lepidoptera,\n_e.g._ butterflies and moths; (5) the hemiptera, _e.g._ cicadas and\nfleas; (6) the coleoptera, _e.g._ cockchafers and glow-worms; (7) the\ndiptera, _e.g._ gnats and flies; (8) the rhipiptera, _e.g._ the\nstylops; (9) the parasites, _e.g._ the acarus; and (10) the thysanura,\n_e.g._ the lepisma and podura.]\n\n\nEvery available hour did he spend in the pursuit of his favourite\nscience: hexapods ruled his thoughts by day and his dreams by night.\nThe number of pins that he carried thick on the collar and sleeves of\nhis coat, down the front of his waistcoat, and on the crown of his hat,\ndefied computation; they were kept in readiness for the capture of\nspecimens that might come in his way, and on his return from a ramble\nin the country he might be seen literally encased with a covering of\ninsects, transfixed adroitly by scientific rule.\n\nThis ruling passion of his had been the inducement that had urged him\nto accompany Mr. and Mrs. Weldon to New Zealand. It had appeared to him\nthat it was likely to be a promising district, and now having been\nsuccessful in adding some rare specimens to his collection, he was\nanxious to get back again to San Francisco, and to assign them their\nproper places in his extensive cabinet.\n\nBesides, it never occurred to Mrs. Weldon to start without him. To\nleave him to shift for himself would be sheer cruelty. As a matter of\ncourse whenever Mrs. Weldon went on board the \"Pilgrim,\" Cousin\nBenedict would go too.\n\nNot that in any emergency assistance of any kind could be expected from\nhim; on the contrary, in the case of difficulty he would be an\nadditional burden; but there was every reason to expect a fair passage\nand no cause of misgiving of any kind, so the propriety of leaving the\namiable entomologist behind was never suggested.\n\nAnxious that she should be no impediment in the way of the due\ndeparture of the \"Pilgrim\" from Waitemata, Mrs. Weldon made her\npreparations with the utmost haste, discharged the servants which she\nhad temporarily engaged at Auckland, and accompanied by little Jack and\nthe old negress, and followed mechanically by Cousin Benedict, embarked\non the 22nd of January on board the schooner.\n\nThe amateur, however, kept his eye very scrupulously upon his own\nspecial box. Amongst his collection of insects were some very\nremarkable examples of new staphylins, a species of carnivorous\ncoleoptera with eyes placed above their head; it was a kind supposed to\nbe peculiar to New Caledonia. Another rarity which had been brought\nunder his notice was a venomous spider, known among the Maoris as a\n\"katipo;\" its bite was asserted to be very often fatal. As a spider,\nhowever, belongs to the order of the arachnida, and is not properly an\n\"insect,\" Benedict declined to take any interest in it. Enough for him\nthat he had secured a novelty in his own section of research; the\n\"Staphylin Neo-Zelandus\" was not only the gem of his collection, but\nits pecuniary value baffled ordinary estimate; he insured his box at a\nfabulous sum, deeming it to be worth far more than all the cargo of oil\nand whalebone in the \"Pilgrim's\" hold.\n\nCaptain Hull advanced to meet Mrs. Weldon and her party as they stepped\non deck.\n\n\"It must be understood, Mrs. Weldon,\" he said, courteously raising his\nhat, \"that you take this passage entirely on your own responsibility.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Captain Hull,\" she answered; \"but why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Simply because I have received no orders from Mr. Weldon,\" replied the\ncaptain.\n\n[Illustration: Captain Hull advanced to meet Mrs. Weldon and her party.]\n\n\"But my wish exonerates you,\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Besides,\" added Captain Hull, \"I am unable to provide you with the\naccommodation and the comfort that you would have upon a passenger\nsteamer.\"\n\n\"You know well enough, captain,\" remonstrated the lady \"that my husband\nwould not hesitate for a moment to trust his wife and child on board\nthe 'Pilgrim.'\"\n\n\"Trust, madam! No! no more than I should myself. I repeat that the\n'Pilgrim' cannot afford you the comfort to which you are accustomed.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon smiled.\n\n\"Oh, I am not one of your grumbling travellers. I shall have no\ncomplaints to make either of small cramped cabins, or of rough and\nmeagre food.\"\n\nShe took her son by the hand, and passing on, begged that they might\nstart forthwith.\n\nOrders accordingly were given; sails were trimmed; and after taking the\nshortest course across the gulf, the \"Pilgrim\" turned her head towards\nAmerica.\n\nThree days later strong easterly breezes compelled the schooner to tack\nto larboard in order to get to windward. The consequence was that by\nthe 2nd of February the captain found himself in such a latitude that\nhe might almost be suspected of intending to round Cape Horn rather\nthan of having a design to coast the western shores of the New\nContinent.\n\nStill, the sea did not become rough. There was a slight delay, but, on\nthe whole, navigation was perfectly easy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE APPRENTICE.\n\n\nThere was no poop upon the \"Pilgrim's\" deck, so that Mrs. Weldon had no\nalternative than to acquiesce in the captain's proposal that she should\noccupy his own modest cabin.\n\nAccordingly, here she was installed with Jack and old Nan; and here she\ntook all her meals, in company with the captain and Cousin Benedict.\n\nFor Cousin Benedict tolerably comfortable sleeping accommodation had\nbeen contrived close at hand, while Captain Hull himself retired to the\ncrew's quarter, occupying the cabin which properly belonged to the\nchief mate, but as already indicated, the services of a second officer\nwere quite dispensed with.\n\nAll the crew were civil and attentive to the wife of their employer, a\nmaster to whom they were faithfully attached. They were all natives of\nthe coast of California, brave and experienced seamen, and united by\ntastes and habits in a common bond of sympathy. Few as they were in\nnumber, their work was never shirked, not simply from the sense of\nduty, but because they were directly interested in the profits of their\nundertaking; the success of their labours always told to their own\nadvantage. The present expedition was the fourth that they had taken\ntogether; and, as it turned out to be the first in which they had\nfailed to meet with success, it may be imagined that they were full of\nresentment against the mutinous whalemen who had been the cause of so\nserious a diminution of their ordinary gains.\n\n[Illustration: Negoro.]\n\nThe only one on board who was not an American was a man who had been\ntemporarily engaged as cook. His name was Negoro; he was a Portuguese\nby birth, but spoke English with perfect fluency. The previous cook had\ndeserted the ship at Auckland, and when Negoro, who was out of\nemployment, applied for the place, Captain Hull, only too glad to avoid\ndetention, engaged him at once without inquiry into his antecedents.\nThere was not the slightest fault to be found with the way in which the\ncook performed his duties, but there was something in his manner, or\nperhaps, rather in the expression of his countenance, which excited the\nCaptain's misgivings, and made him regret that he had not taken more\npains to investigate the character of one with whom he was now brought\ninto such close contact.\n\nNegoro looked about forty years of age. Although he had the appearance\nof being slightly built, he was muscular; he was of middle height, and\nseemed to have a robust constitution; his hair was dark, his complexion\nsomewhat swarthy. His manner was taciturn, and although, from\noccasional remarks that he dropped, it was evident that he had received\nsome education, he was very reserved on the subjects both of his family\nand of his past life. No one knew where he had come from, and he\nadmitted no one to his confidence as to where he was going, except that\nhe made no secret of his intention to land at Valparaiso. His freedom\nfrom sea-sickness demonstrated that this could hardly be his first\nvoyage, but on the other hand his complete ignorance of seamen's\nphraseology made it certain that he had never been accustomed to his\npresent occupation. He kept himself aloof as much as possible from the\nrest of the crew, during the day rarely leaving the great cast-iron\nstove, which was out of proportion to the measurement of the cramped\nlittle kitchen; and at night, as soon as the fire was extinguished,\ntook the earliest opportunity of retiring to his berth and going to\nsleep.\n\nIt has been already stated that the crew of the \"Pilgrim\" consisted of\nfive seamen and an apprentice. This apprentice was Dick Sands.\n\nDick was fifteen years old; he was a foundling, his unknown parents\nhaving abandoned him at his birth, and he had been brought up in a\npublic charitable institution. He had been called Dick, after the\nbenevolent passer-by who had discovered him when he was but an infant a\nfew hours old, and he had received the surname of Sands as a memorial\nof the spot where he had been exposed, Sandy Hook, a point at the mouth\nof the Hudson, where it forms an entrance to the harbour of New York.\n\nAs Dick was so young it was most likely he would yet grow a little\ntaller, but it did not seem probable that he would ever exceed middle\nheight, he looked too stoutly and strongly built to grow much. His\ncomplexion was dark, but his beaming blue eyes attested, with scarcely\nroom for doubt, his Anglo-Saxon origin, and his countenance betokened\nenergy and intelligence. The profession that he had adopted seemed to\nhave equipped him betimes for fighting the battle of life.\n\nMisquoted often as Virgil's are the words\n\n  \"Audaces fortuna juvat!\"\n\nbut the true reading is\n\n  \"Audentes fortuna juvat!\"\n\nand, slight as the difference may seem, it is very significant. It is\nupon the confident rather than the rash, the daring rather than the\nbold, that Fortune sheds her smiles; the bold man often acts without\nthinking, whilst the daring always thinks before he acts.\n\nAnd Dick Sands was truly courageous; he was one of the daring. At\nfifteen years old, an age at which few boys have laid aside the\nfrivolities of childhood, he had acquired the stability of a man, and\nthe most casual observer could scarcely fail to be attracted by his\nbright, yet thoughtful countenance. At an early period of his life he\nhad realized all the difficulties of his position, and had made a\nresolution, from which nothing tempted him to flinch, that he would\ncarve out for himself an honourable and independent career. Lithe and\nagile in his movements, he was an adept in every kind of athletic\nexercise; and so marvellous was his success in everything he undertook,\nthat he might almost be supposed to be one of those gifted mortals who\nhave two right hands and two left feet.\n\nUntil he was four years old the little orphan had found a home in one\nof those institutions in America where forsaken children are sure of an\nasylum, and he was subsequently sent to an industrial school supported\nby charitable aid, where he learnt reading, writing, and arithmetic.\nFrom the days of infancy he had never deviated from the expression of\nhis wish to be a sailor, and accordingly, as soon as he was eight, he\nwas placed as cabin-boy on board one of the ships that navigate the\nSouthern Seas. The officers all took a peculiar interest in him, and he\nreceived, in consequence, a thoroughly good grounding in the duties and\ndiscipline of a seaman's life. There was no room to doubt that he must\nultimately rise to eminence in his profession, for when a child from\nthe very first has been trained in the knowledge that he must gain his\nbread by the sweat of his brow, it is comparatively rare that he lacks\nthe will to do so.\n\nWhilst he was still acting as cabin-boy on one of those\ntrading-vessels, Dick attracted the notice of Captain Hull, who took a\nfancy to the lad and introduced him to his employer. Mr. Weldon at once\ntook a lively interest in Dick's welfare, and had his education\ncontinued in San Francisco, taking care that he was instructed in the\ndoctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, to which his own family\nbelonged.\n\nThroughout his studies Dick Sands' favourite subjects were always those\nwhich had a reference to his future profession; he mastered the details\nof the geography of the world; he applied himself diligently to such\nbranches of mathematics as were necessary for the science of\nnavigation; whilst for recreation in his hours of leisure, he would\ngreedily devour every book of adventure in travel that came in his way.\nNor did he omit duly to combine the practical with the theoretical; and\nwhen he was bound apprentice on board the \"Pilgrim,\" a vessel not only\nbelonging to his benefactor, but under the command of his kind friend\nCaptain Hull, he congratulated himself most heartily, and felt that the\nexperience he should gain in the southern whale-fisheries could hardly\nfail to be of service to him in after-life. A first-rate sailor ought\nto be a first-rate fisherman too.\n\nIt was a matter of the greatest pleasure to Dick Sands when he heard to\nhis surprise that Mrs. Weldon was about to become a passenger on board\nthe \"Pilgrim.\" His devotion to the family of his benefactor was large\nand genuine. For several years Mrs. Weldon had acted towards him little\nshort of a mother's part, and for Jack, although he never forgot the\ndifference in their position, he entertained well-nigh a brother's\naffection. His friends had the satisfaction of being assured that they\nhad sown the seeds of kindness on a generous soil, for there was no\nroom to doubt that the heart of the orphan boy was overflowing with\nsincere gratitude. Should the occasion arise, ought he not, he asked,\nto be ready to sacrifice everything in behalf of those to whom he was\nindebted not only for his start in life, but for the knowledge of all\nthat was right and holy?\n\nConfiding in the good principles of her prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, Mrs. Weldon had no\nhesitation in entrusting her little son to his especial charge. During\nthe frequent periods of leisure, when the sea was fair, and the sails\nrequired no shifting, the apprentice was never weary of amusing Jack by\nmaking him familiar with the practice of a sailor's craft; he made him\nscramble up the shrouds, perch upon the yards, and slip down the\nback-stays; and the mother had no alarm; her assurance of Dick Sands'\nability and watchfulness to protect her boy was so complete that she\ncould only rejoice in an occupation for him that seemed more than\nanything to restore the colour he had lost in his recent illness.\n\nTime passed on without incident; and had it not been for the constant\nprevalence of an adverse wind, neither passengers nor crew could have\nfound the least cause of complaint. The pertinacity, however, with\nwhich the wind kept to the east could not do otherwise than make\nCaptain Hull somewhat concerned; it absolutely prevented him from\ngetting his ship into her proper course, and he could not altogether\nsuppress his misgiving that the calms near the Tropic of Capricorn, and\nthe equatorial current driving him on westwards, would entail a delay\nthat might be serious.\n\n[Illustration: Dick and little Jack.]\n\nIt was principally on Mrs. Weldon's account that the Captain began to\nfeel uneasiness, and he made up his mind that if he could hail a vessel\nproceeding to America he should advise his passengers to embark on her;\nunfortunately, however, he felt that they were still in a latitude far\ntoo much to the south to make it likely that they should sight a\nsteamer going to Panama; and at that date, communication between\nAustralia and the New World was much less frequent than it has since\nbecome.\n\nStill, nothing occurred to interrupt the general monotony of the voyage\nuntil the 2nd of February, the date at which our narrative commences.\n\nIt was about nine o'clock in the morning of that day that Dick and\nlittle Jack had perched themselves together on the top-mast-yards. The\nweather was very clear, and they could see the horizon right round\nexcept the section behind them, hidden by the brigantine-sail on the\nmain-mast. Below them, the bowsprit seemed to lie along the water with\nits stay-sails attached like three unequal wings; from the lads' feet\nto the deck was the smooth surface of the fore-mast; and above their\nheads nothing but the small top-sail and the top-mast. The schooner was\nrunning on the larboard tack as close to the wind as possible.\n\nDick Sand was pointing out to Jack how well the ship was ballasted, and\nwas trying to explain how it was impossible for her to capsize, however\nmuch she heeled to starboard, when suddenly the little fellow cried\nout,--\n\n\"I can see something in the water!\"\n\n\"Where? what?\" exclaimed Dick, clambering to his feet upon the yard.\n\n\"There!\" said the child, directing attention to the portion of the\nsea-surface that was visible between the stay-sails.\n\nDick fixed his gaze intently for a moment, and then shouted out\nlustily,--\n\n\"Look out in front, to starboard! There is something afloat. To\nwindward, look out!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nA RESCUE.\n\n\nAt the sound of Dick's voice all the crew, in a moment, were upon the\nalert. The men who were not on watch rushed to the deck, and Captain\nHull hurried from his cabin to the bows. Mrs. Weldon, Nan, and even\nCousin Benedict leaned over the starboard taffrails, eager to get a\nglimpse of what had thus suddenly attracted the attention of the young\napprentice. With his usual indifference, Negoro did not leave his\ncabin, and was the only person on board who did not share the general\nexcitement.\n\nSpeculations were soon rife as to what could be the nature of the\nfloating object which could be discerned about three miles ahead.\nSuggestions of various character were freely made. One of the sailors\ndeclared that it looked to him only like an abandoned raft, but Mrs.\nWeldon observed quickly that if it were a raft it might be carrying\nsome unfortunate shipwrecked men who must be rescued if possible.\nCousin Benedict asserted that it was nothing more nor less than a huge\nsea-monster; but the captain soon arrived at the conviction that it was\nthe hull of a vessel that had heeled over on to its side, an opinion\nwith which Dick thoroughly coincided, and went so far as to say that he\nbelieved he could make out the copper keel glittering in the sun.\n\n\"Luff, Bolton, luff!\" shouted Captain Hull to the helmsman; \"we will at\nany rate lose no time in getting alongside.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the helmsman, and the \"Pilgrim\" in an instant\nwas steered according to orders.\n\nIn spite, however, of the convictions of the captain and Dick, Cousin\nBenedict would not be moved from his opinion that the object of their\ncuriosity was some huge cetacean.\n\n\"It is certainly dead, then,\" remarked Mrs. Weldon; \"it is perfectly\nmotionless.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's because it is asleep,\" said Benedict, who, although he\nwould have willingly given up all the whales in the ocean for one rare\nspecimen of an insect, yet could not surrender his own belief.\n\n\"Easy, Bolton, easy!\" shouted the captain when they were getting nearer\nthe floating mass; \"don't let us be running foul of the thing; no good\ncould come from knocking a hole in our side; keep out from it a good\ncable's length.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied the helmsman, in his usual cheery way; and by an\neasy turn of the helm the \"Pilgrim's\" course was slightly modified so\nas to avoid all fear of collision.\n\nThe excitement of the sailors by this time had become more intense.\nEver since the distance had been less than a mile all doubt had\nvanished, and it was certain that what was attracting their attention\nwas the hull of a capsized ship. They knew well enough the established\nrule that a third of all salvage is the right of the finders, and they\nwere filled with the hope that the hull they were nearing might contain\nan undamaged cargo, and be \"a good haul,\" to compensate them for their\nill-success in the last season.\n\nA quarter of an hour later and the \"Pilgrim\" was within half a mile of\nthe deserted vessel, facing her starboard side. Water-logged to her\nbulwarks, she had heeled over so completely that it would have been\nnext to impossible to stand upon her deck. Of her masts nothing was to\nbe seen; a few ends of cordage were all that remained of her shrouds,\nand the try-sail chains were hanging all broken. On the starboard flank\nwas an enormous hole.\n\n\"Something or other has run foul of her,\" said Dick.\n\n\"No doubt of that,\" replied the captain; \"the only wonder is that she\ndid not sink immediately.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I hope the poor crew have been saved!\" exclaimed Mrs Weldon.\n\n\"Most probably,\" replied the captain, \"they would all have taken to the\nboats. It is as likely as not that the ship which did the mischief\nwould continue its course quite unconcerned.\"\n\n\"Surely, you cannot mean,\" cried Mrs Weldon, \"that any one could be\ncapable of such inhumanity?\"\n\n\"Only too probable,\" answered Captain Hull, \"unfortunately, such\ninstances are very far from rare.\"\n\nHe scanned the drifting ship carefully and continued,--\n\n\"No, I cannot see any sign of boats here, I should guess that the crew\nhave made an attempt to get to land, at such a distance as this,\nhowever, from America or from the islands of the Pacific I should be\nafraid that it must be hopeless.\"\n\n\"Is it not possible,\" asked Mrs Weldon, \"that some poor creature may\nstill survive on board, who can tell what has happened?\"\n\n\"Hardly likely, madam; otherwise there would have been some sort of a\nsignal in sight. But it is a matter about which we will make sure.\"\n\nThe captain waved his hand a little in the direction in which he wished\nto go, and said quietly,--\n\n\"Luff, Bolton, luff a bit!\"\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" by this time was not much more than three cables' lengths\nfrom the ship, there was still no token of her being otherwise than\nutterly deserted, when Dick Sands suddenly exclaimed,--\n\n\"Hark! if I am not much mistaken, that is a dog barking!\"\n\nEvery one listened attentively; it was no fancy on Dick's part, sure\nenough a stifled barking could be heard, as if some unfortunate dog had\nbeen imprisoned beneath the hatchways; but as the deck was not yet\nvisible, it was impossible at present to determine the precise truth.\n\nMrs Weldon pleaded,--\n\n\"If it is only a dog, captain, let it be saved.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, mamma, the dog must be saved!\" cried little Jack; \"I\nwill go and get a bit of sugar ready for it.\"\n\n[Illustration: Negoro had approached without being noticed by any one]\n\n\"A bit of sugar, my child, will not be much for a starved dog.\"\n\n\"Then it shall have my soup, and I will do without,\" said the boy, and\nhe kept shouting, \"Good dog! good dog!\" until he persuaded himself that\nhe heard the animal responding to his call.\n\nThe vessels were now scarcely three hundred feet apart; the barking was\nmore and more distinct, and presently a great dog was seen clinging to\nthe starboard netting. It barked more desperately than ever.\n\n\"Howick,\" said Captain Hull, calling to the boatswain, \"heave to, and\nlower the small boat.\"\n\nThe sails were soon trimmed so as to bring the schooner to a standstill\nwithin half a cable's length of the disabled craft, the boat was\nlowered, and the captain and Dick, with a couple of sailors, went on\nboard. The dog kept up a continual yelping; it made the most vigourous\nefforts to retain its hold upon the netting, but perpetually slipped\nbackwards and fell off again upon the inclining deck. It was soon\nmanifest, however, that all the noise the creature was making was not\ndirected exclusively towards those who were coming to its rescue, and\nMrs. Weldon could not divest herself of the impression that there must\nbe some survivors still on board. All at once the animal changed its\ngestures. Instead of the crouching attitude and supplicating whine with\nwhich it seemed to be imploring the compassion of those who were\nnearing it, it suddenly appeared to become bursting with violence and\nfurious with rage.\n\n\"What ails the brute?\" exclaimed Captain Hull.\n\nBut already the boat was on the farther side of the wrecked ship, and\nthe captain was not in a position to see that Negoro the cook had just\ncome on to the schooner's deck, or that it was obvious that it was\nagainst him that the dog had broken out in such obstreperous fury.\nNegoro had approached without being noticed by any one; he made his way\nto the forecastle, whence, without a word or look of surprise, he gazed\na moment at the dog, knitted his brow, and, silent and unobserved as he\nhad come, retired to his kitchen.\n\nAs the boat had rounded the stern of the drifting hull, it had been\nobserved that the one word \"Waldeck\" was painted on the aft-board, but\nthat there was no intimation of the port to which the ship belonged. To\nCaptain Hull's experienced eye, however, certain details of\nconstruction gave a decided confirmation to the probability suggested\nby her name that she was of American build.\n\nOf what had once been a fine brig of 500 tons burden this hopeless\nwreck was now all that remained. The large hole near the bows indicated\nthe place where the disastrous shock had occurred, but as, in the\nheeling over, this aperture had been carried some five or six feet\nabove the water, the vessel had escaped the immediate foundering which\nmust otherwise have ensued; but still it wanted only the rising of a\nheavy swell to submerge the ship at any time in a few minutes.\n\nIt did not take many more strokes to bring the boat close to the\nlarboard bulwark, which was half out of the water, and Captain Hull\nobtained a view of the whole length of the deck. It was clear from end\nto end. Both masts had been snapped off within two feet of their\nsockets, and had been swept away with shrouds, stays, and rigging. Not\na single spar was to be seen floating anywhere within sight of the\nwreck, a circumstance from which it was to be inferred that several\ndays at least had elapsed since the catastrophe.\n\nMeantime the dog, sliding down from the taffrail, got to the centre\nhatchway, which was open. Here it continued to bark, alternately\ndirecting its eyes above deck and below.\n\n\"Look at that dog!\" said Dick; \"I begin to think there must be somebody\non board.\"\n\n\"If so,\" answered the captain, \"he must have died of hunger; the water\nof course has flooded the store-room.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick; \"that dog wouldn't look like that if there were nobody\nthere alive.\"\n\n[Illustration: The dog began to swim slowly and with manifest weakness\ntowards the boat.]\n\nTaking the boat as close as was prudent to the wreck, the captain and\nDick called and whistled repeatedly to the dog, which after a while let\nitself slip into the sea, and began to swim slowly and with manifest\nweakness towards the boat. As soon as it was lifted in, the animal,\ninstead of devouring the piece of bread that was offered him, made its\nway to a bucket containing a few drops of fresh water, and began\neagerly to lap them up.\n\n\"The poor wretch is dying of thirst!\" said Dick.\n\nIt soon appeared that the dog was very far from being engrossed with\nits own interests. The boat was being pushed back a few yards in order\nto allow the captain to ascertain the most convenient place to get\nalongside the \"Waldeck,\" when the creature seized Dick by the jacket,\nand set up a howl that was almost human in its piteousness. It was\nevidently in a state of alarm that the boat was not going to return to\nthe wreck. The dog's meaning could not be misunderstood. The boat was\naccordingly brought against the larboard side of the vessel, and while\nthe two sailors lashed her securely to the \"Waldeck's\" cat-head,\nCaptain Hull and Dick, with the dog persistently accompanying them,\nclambered, after some difficulty, to the open hatchway between the\nstumps of the masts, and made their way into the hold. It was half full\nof water, but perfectly destitute of cargo, its sole contents being the\nballast sand which had slipped to larboard, and now served to keep the\nvessel on her side.\n\nOne glance was sufficient to convince the captain that there was no\nsalvage to be effected.\n\n\"There is nothing here; nobody here,\" he said.\n\n\"So I see,\" said the apprentice, who had made his way to the extreme\nfore-part of the hold.\n\n\"Then we have only to go up again,\" remarked the captain.\n\nThey ascended the ladder, but no sooner did they reappear upon the deck\nthan the dog, barking irrepressibly, began trying manifestly to drag\nthem towards the stern.\n\nYielding to what might be called the importunities of the dog, they\nfollowed him to the poop, and there, by the dim glimmer admitted by the\nsky-light, Captain Hull made out the forms of five bodies, motionless\nand apparently lifeless, stretched upon the floor.\n\nOne after another, Dick hastily examined them all, and emphatically\ndeclared it to be his opinion, that not one or them had actually ceased\nto breathe; whereupon the captain did not lose a minute in summoning\nthe two sailors to his aid, and although it was far from an easy task,\nhe succeeded in getting the five unconscious men, who were all negroes,\nconveyed safely to the boat.\n\nThe dog followed, apparently satisfied.\n\nWith all possible speed the boat made its way back again to the\n\"Pilgrim,\" a girt-line was lowered from the mainyard, and the\nunfortunate men were raised to the deck.\n\n\"Poor things!\" said Mrs. Weldon, as she looked compassionately on the\nmotionless forms.\n\n\"But they are not dead,\" cried Dick eagerly; \"they are not dead; we\nshall save them all yet!\"\n\n\"What's the matter with them?\" asked Cousin Benedict, looking at them\nwith utter bewilderment.\n\n\"We shall hear all about them soon, I dare say,\" said the captain,\nsmiling; \"but first we will give them a few drops of rum in some water.\"\n\nCousin Benedict smiled in return.\n\n\"Negoro!\" shouted the captain.\n\nAt the sound of the name, the dog, who had hitherto been quite passive,\ngrowled fiercely, showed his teeth, and exhibited every sign of rage.\n\nThe cook did not answer.\n\n\"Negoro!\" again the captain shouted, and the dog became yet more angry.\n\nAt this second summons Negoro slowly left his kitchen, but no sooner\nhad he shown his face upon the deck than the animal made a rush at him,\nand would unquestionably have seized him by the throat if the man had\nnot knocked him back with a poker which he had brought with him in his\nhand.\n\nThe infuriated beast was secured by the sailors, and prevented from\ninflicting any serious injury.\n\n\"Do you know this dog?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Know him? Not I! I have never set eyes on the brute in my life.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" muttered Dick to himself; \"there is some mystery here. We\nshall see.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE SURVIVORS OF THE \"WALDECK.\"\n\n\nIn spite of the watchfulness of the French and English cruisers, there\nis no doubt that the slave-trade is still extensively carried on in all\nparts of equatorial Africa, and that year after year vessels loaded\nwith slaves leave the coasts of Angola and Mozambique to transport\ntheir living freight to many quarters even of the civilized world.\n\nOf this Captain Hull was well aware, and although he was now in a\nlatitude which was comparatively little traversed by such slavers, he\ncould not help almost involuntarily conjecturing that the negroes they\nhad just found must be part of a slave-cargo which was on its way to\nsome colony of the Pacific; if this were so, he would at least have the\nsatisfaction of announcing to them that they had regained their freedom\nfrom the moment that they came on board the \"Pilgrim.\"\n\nWhilst these thoughts were passing through his mind, Mrs. Weldon,\nassisted by Nan and the ever active Dick Sands, was doing everything in\nher power to restore consciousness to the poor sufferers. The judicious\nadministration of fresh water and a limited quantity of food soon had\nthe effect of making them revive; and when they were restored to their\nsenses it was found that the eldest of them, a man of about sixty years\nof age, who immediately regained his powers of speech, was able to\nreply in good English to all the questions that were put to him. In\nanswer to Captain Hull's inquiry whether they were not slaves, the old\nnegro proudly stated that he and his companions were all free American\ncitizens, belonging to the state of Pennsylvania.\n\n[Illustration: Mrs. Weldon, assisted by Nan and the ever active Dick\nSands, was doing everything in her power to restore consciousness to\nthe poor sufferers.]\n\n\"Then, let me assure you, my friend,\" said the captain, \"you have by no\nmeans compromised your liberty in having been brought on board the\nAmerican schooner 'Pilgrim.'\"\n\nNot merely, as it seemed, on account of his age and experience, but\nrather because of a certain superiority and greater energy of\ncharacter, this old man was tacitly recognized as the spokesman of his\nparty; he freely communicated all the information that Captain Hull\nrequired to hear, and by degrees he related all the details of his\nadventures.\n\nHe said that his name was Tom, and that when he was only six years of\nage he had been sold as a slave, and brought from his home in Africa to\nthe United States; but by the act of emancipation he had long since\nrecovered his freedom. His companions, who were all much younger than\nhimself, their ages ranging from twenty-five to thirty, were all\nfree-born, their parents having been emancipated before their birth, so\nthat no white man had ever exercised upon them the rights of ownership.\nOne of them was his own son; his name was Bat (an abbreviation of\nBartholomew); and there were three others, named Austin, Act\u00c3\u00a6on, and\nHercules. All four of them were specimens of that stalwart race that\ncommands so high a price in the African market, and in spite of the\nemaciation induced by their recent sufferings, their muscular,\nwell-knit frames betokened a strong and healthy constitution. Their\nmanner bore the impress of that solid education which is given in the\nNorth American schools, and their speech had lost all trace of the\n\"nigger-tongue,\" a dialect without articles or inflexions, which since\nthe anti-slavery war has almost died out in the United States.\n\nThree years ago, old Tom stated, the five men had been engaged by an\nEnglishman who had large property in South Australia, to work upon his\nestates near Melbourne. Here they had realized a considerable profit,\nand upon the completion of their engagement they determined to return\nwith their savings to America. Accordingly, on the 5th of January,\nafter paying their passage in the ordinary way, they embarked at\nMelbourne on board the \"Waldeck.\" Everything went on well for seventeen\ndays, until, on the night of the 22nd, which was very dark, they were\nrun into by a great steamer. They were all asleep in their berths, but,\nroused by the shock of the collision, which was extremely severe, they\nhurriedly made their way on to the deck. The scene was terrible; both\nmasts were gone, and the brig, although the water had not absolutely\nflooded her hold so as to make her sink, had completely heeled over on\nher side. Captain and crew had entirely disappeared, some probably\nhaving been dashed into the sea, others perhaps having saved themselves\nby clinging to the rigging of the ship which had fouled them, and which\ncould be distinguished through the darkness rapidly receding in the\ndistance. For a while they were paralyzed, but they soon awoke to the\nconviction that they were left alone upon a half-capsized and disabled\nhull, twelve hundred miles from the nearest land. Mrs. Weldon was loud\nin her expression of indignation that any captain should have the\nbarbarity to abandon an unfortunate vessel with which his own\ncarelessness had brought him into collision. It would be bad enough,\nshe said for a driver on a public road, when it might be presumed that\nhelp would be forthcoming, to pass on unconcerned after causing an\naccident to another vehicle; but how much more shameful to desert the\ninjured on the open sea, where the victims of his incompetence could\nhave no chance of obtaining succour! Captain Hull could only repeat\nwhat he had said before, that incredibly atrocious as it might seem,\nsuch inhumanity was far from rare.\n\nOn resuming his story, Tom said that he and his companions soon found\nthat they had no means left for getting away from the capsized brig;\nboth the boats had been crushed in the collision, so that they had no\nalternative except to await the appearance of a passing vessel, whilst\nthe wreck was drifting hopelessly along under the action of the\ncurrents. This accounted for the fact of their being found so far south\nof their proper course.\n\nFor the next ten days the negroes had subsisted upon a few scraps of\nfood that they found in the stern cabin; but as the store room was\nentirely under water, they were quite unable to obtain a drop of\nanything to drink, and the freshwater tanks that had been lashed to the\ndeck had been stove in at the time of the catastrophe. Tortured with\nthirst, the poor men had suffered agonies, and having on the previous\nnight entirely lost consciousness, they must soon have died if the\n\"Pilgrim's\" timely arrival had not effected their rescue.\n\nAll the outlines of Tom's narrative were fully confirmed by the other\nnegroes; Captain Hull could see no reason to doubt it; indeed, the\nfacts seemed to speak for themselves.\n\nOne other survivor of the wreck, if he had been gifted with the power\nof speech, would doubtless have corroborated the testimony. This was\nthe dog who seemed to have such an unaccountable dislike to Negoro.\n\nDingo, as the dog was named, belonged to the fine breed of mastiffs\npeculiar to New Holland. It was not, however, from Australia, but from\nthe coast of West Africa, near the mouth of the Congo, that the animal\nhad come. He had been picked up there, two years previously, by the\ncaptain of the \"Waldeck,\" who had found him wandering about and more\nthan half starved. The initials S. V. engraved upon his collar were the\nonly tokens that the dog had a past history of his own. After he had\nbeen taken on board the \"Waldeck,\" he remained quite unsociable,\napparently ever pining for some lost master, whom he had failed to find\nin the desert land where he had been met with.\n\nLarger than the dogs of the Pyrenees, Dingo was a magnificent example\nof his kind. Standing on his hind legs, with his head thrown back, he\nwas as tall as a man. His agility and strength would have made him a\nsure match for a panther, and he would not have flinched at facing a\nbear. His fine shaggy coat was a dark tawny colour, shading off\nsomewhat lighter round the muzzle, and his long bushy tail was as\nstrong as a lion's. If he were made angry, no doubt he might become a\nmost formidable foe, so that it was no wonder that Negoro did not feel\naltogether gratified at his reception.\n\nBut Dingo, though unsociable, was not savage. Old Tom said that, on\nboard the \"Waldeck,\" he had noticed that the animal seemed to have a\nparticular dislike to negroes; not that he actually attempted to do\nthem any harm, only he uniformly avoided them, giving an impression\nthat he must have been systematically ill-treated by the natives of\nthat part of Africa in which he had been found. During the ten days\nthat had elapsed since the collision, Dingo had kept resolutely aloof\nfrom Tom and his companions; they could not tell what he had been\nfeeding on; they only knew that, like themselves, he had suffered an\nexcruciating thirst.\n\nSuch had been the experience of the survivors of the \"Waldeck.\" Their\nsituation had been most critical. Even if they survived the pangs of\nwant of food, the slightest gale or the most inconsiderable swell might\nat any moment have sunk the water-logged ship, and had it not been that\ncalms and contrary winds had contributed to the opportune arrival of\nthe \"Pilgrim,\" an inevitable fate was before them; their corpses must\nlie at the bottom of the sea.\n\nCaptain Hull's act of humanity, however, would not be complete unless\nhe succeeded in restoring the shipwrecked men to their homes. This he\npromised to do. After completing the unlading at Valparaiso, the\n\"Pilgrim\" would make direct for California, where, as Mrs. Weldon\nassured them, they would be most hospitably received by her husband,\nand provided with the necessary means for returning to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe five men, who, as the consequence of the shipwreck, had lost all\nthe savings of their last three years of toil, were profoundly grateful\nto their kind-hearted benefactors; nor, poor negroes as they were, did\nthey utterly resign the hope that at some future time they might have\nit in their power to repay the debt which they owed their deliverers.\n\n[Illustration: The good natured negroes were ever ready to lend a\nhelping hand.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nDINGO'S SAGACITY.\n\n\nMeantime the \"Pilgrim\" pursued her course, keeping as much as possible\nto the east, and before evening closed in the hull of the \"Waldeck\" was\nout of sight.\n\nCaptain Hull still continued to feel uneasy about the constant\nprevalence of calms; not that for himself he cared much about the delay\nof a week or two in a voyage from New Zealand to Valparaiso, but he was\ndisappointed at the prolonged inconvenience it caused to his lady\npassenger. Mrs. Weldon, however, submitted to the detention very\nphilosophically, and did not utter a word of complaint.\n\nThe captain's next care was to improvise sleeping accommodation for Tom\nand his four associates. No room for them could possibly be found in\nthe crew's quarters, so that their berths had to be arranged under the\nforecastle; and as long as the weather continued fine, there was no\nreason why the negroes, accustomed as they were to a somewhat rough\nlife, should not find themselves sufficiently comfortable.\n\nAfter this incident of the discovery of the wreck, life on board the\n\"Pilgrim\" relapsed into its ordinary routine. With the wind invariably\nin the same direction, the sails required very little shifting; but\nwhenever it happened, as occasionally it would, that there was any\ntacking to be done, the good-natured negroes were ever ready to lend a\nhelping hand; and the rigging would creak again under the weight of\nHercules, a great strapping fellow, six feet high, who seemed almost to\nrequire ropes of extra strength made for his special use.\n\nHercules became at once a great favourite with little Jack; and when\nthe giant lifted him like a doll in his stalwart arms, the child fairly\nshrieked with delight.\n\n\"Higher! higher! very high!\" Jack would say sometimes.\n\n\"There you are, then, Master Jack,\" Hercules would reply as he raised\nhim aloft.\n\n\"Am I heavy?\" asked the child,\n\n\"As heavy as a feather.\"\n\n\"Then lift me higher still,\" cried Jack; \"as high as ever you can\nreach.\"\n\nAnd Hercules, with the child's two feet supported on his huge palm,\nwould walk about the deck with him like an acrobat, Jack all the time\nendeavouring, with vain efforts, to make him \"feel his weight.\"\n\nBesides Dick Sands and Hercules, Jack admitted a third friend to his\ncompanionship. This was Dingo. The dog, unsociable as he had been on\nboard the \"Waldeck,\" seemed to have found society more congenial to his\ntastes, and being one of those animals that are fond of children, he\nallowed Jack to do with him almost anything he pleased. The child,\nhowever, never thought of hurting the dog in any way, and it was\ndoubtful which of the two had the greater enjoyment of their mutual\nsport. Jack found a live dog infinitely more entertaining than his old\ntoy upon its four wheels, and his great delight was to mount upon\nDingo's back, when the animal would gallop off with him like a\nrace-horse with his jockey. It must be owned that one result of this\nintimacy was a serious diminution of the supply of sugar in the\nstore-room. Dingo was the delight of all the crew excepting Negoro, who\ncautiously avoided coming in contact with an animal who showed such\nunmistakable symptoms of hostility.\n\nThe new companions that Jack had thus found did not in the least make\nhim forget his old friend Dick Sands, who devoted all his leisure time\nto him as assiduously as ever. Mrs. Weldon regarded their intimacy with\nthe greatest satisfaction, and one day made a remark to that effect in\nthe presence of Captain Hull.\n\n[Illustration: \"There you are, then, Master Jack!\"]\n\n\"You are right, madam,\" said the captain cordially; \"Dick is a capital\nfellow, and will be sure to be a first-rate sailor. He has an instinct\nwhich is little short of a genius; it supplies all deficiencies of\ntheory. Considering how short an experience and how little instruction\nhe has had, it is quite wonderful how much he knows about a ship.\"\n\n\"Certainly for his age,\" assented Mrs. Weldon, \"he is singularly\nadvanced. I can safely say that I have never had a fault to find with\nhim. I believe that it is my husband's intention, after this voyage, to\nlet him have systematic training in navigation, so that he may be able\nultimately to become a captain.\"\n\n\"I have no misgivings, madam,\" replied the captain; \"there is every\nreason to expect that he will be an honour to the service.\"\n\n\"Poor orphan!\" said the lady; \"he has been trained in a hard school.\"\n\n\"Its lessons have not been lost upon him,\" rejoined Captain Hull; \"they\nhave taught him the prime lesson that he has his own way to make in the\nworld.\"\n\nThe eyes of the two speakers turned as it were unwittingly in the\ndirection where Dick Sands happened to be standing. He was at the helm.\n\n\"Look at him now!\" said the captain; \"see how steadily he keeps his eye\nupon the fore; nothing distracts him from his duty; he is as much to be\ndepended on as the most experienced helmsman. It was a capital thing\nfor him that he began his training as a cabin-boy. Nothing like it.\nBegin at the beginning. It is the best of training for the merchant\nservice.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" interposed Mrs. Weldon, \"you would not deny that in the\nnavy there have been many good officers who have never had the training\nof which you are speaking?\"\n\n\"True, madam; but yet even some of the best of them have begun at the\nlowest step of the ladder. For instance, Lord Nelson.\"\n\nJust at this instant Cousin Benedict emerged from the stern-cabin, and\ncompletely absorbed, according to his wont, in his own pursuit, began\nto wander up and down the deck, peering into the interstices of the\nnetwork, rummaging under the seats, and drawing his long fingers along\nthe cracks in the floor where the tar had crumbled away.\n\n\"Well, Benedict, how are you getting on?\" asked Mrs Weldon.\n\n\"I? Oh, well enough, thank you,\" he replied dreamily; \"but I wish we\nwere on shore.\"\n\n\"What were you looking for under that bench?\" said Captain Hull.\n\n\"Insects, of course,\" answered Benedict; \"I am always looking for\ninsects.\"\n\n\"But don't you know, Benedict,\" said Mrs. Weldon, \"that Captain Hull is\nfar too particular to allow any vermin on the deck of his vessel?\"\n\nCaptain Hull smiled and said,--\n\n\"Mrs Weldon is very complimentary; but I am really inclined to hope\nthat your investigations in the cabins of the 'Pilgrim' will not be\nattended with much success.\"\n\nCousin Benedict shrugged his shoulders in a manner that indicated that\nhe was aware that the cabins could furnish nothing attractive in the\nway of insects.\n\n\"However,\" continued the captain, \"I dare say down in the hold you\ncould find some cockroaches; but cockroaches, I presume, would be of\nlittle or no interest to you.\"\n\n\"No interest?\" cried Benedict, at once warmed into enthusiasm; \"why,\nare they not the very orthoptera that roused the imprecations of Virgil\nand Horace? Are they not closely allied to the _Periplaneta orientalis_\nand the American Kakerlac, which inhabit--\"\n\n\"I should rather say infest,\" interrupted the captain.\n\n\"Easy enough to see, sir,\" replied Benedict, stopping short with\namazement, \"that you are not an entomologist!\"\n\n\"I fear I must plead guilty to your accusation,\" said the captain\ngood-humouredly.\n\n\"You must not expect every one to be such an enthusiast in your\nfavourite study as yourself.\" Mrs. Weldon interposed; \"but are you not\nsatisfied with the result of your explorations in New Zealand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Benedict, with a sort of hesitating reluctance; \"I\nmust not say I was dissatisfied; I was really very delighted to secure\nthat new staphylin which hitherto had never been seen elsewhere than in\nNew California; but still, you know, an entomologist is always craving\nfor fresh additions to his collection.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, Dingo, leaving little Jack, who was romping with\nhim, came and jumped on Benedict, and began to fawn on him.\n\n\"Get away, you brute!\" he exclaimed, thrusting the dog aside.\n\n\"Poor Dingo! good dog!\" cried Jack, running up and taking the animal's\nhuge head between his tiny hands.\n\n\"Your interest in cockroaches, Mr. Benedict,\" observed the captain,\n\"does not seem to extend to dogs.\"\n\n\"It isn't that I dislike dogs at all,\" answered Benedict; \"but this\ncreature has disappointed me.\"\n\n\"How do you mean? You could hardly want to catalogue him with the\ndiptera or hymenoptera?\" asked Mrs Weldon laughingly.\n\n\"Oh, not at all,\" replied Benedict, with the most unmoved gravity. \"But\nI understood that he had been found on the West Coast of Africa, and I\nhoped that perhaps he might have brought over some African hemiptera in\nhis coat; but I have searched his coat well, over and over again,\nwithout finding a single specimen. The dog has disappointed me,\" he\nrepeated mournfully.\n\n\"I can only hope,\" said the captain, \"that if you had found anything,\nyou were going to kill it instantly.\"\n\nBenedict looked with mute astonishment into the captain's face. In a\nmoment or two afterwards, he said,--\n\n\"I suppose, sir, you acknowledge that Sir John Franklin was an eminent\nmember of your profession?\"\n\n\"Certainly; why?\"\n\n\"Because Sir John would never take away the life of the most\ninsignificant insect; it is related of him that when he had once been\nincessantly tormented all day by a mosquito, at last he found it on the\nback of his hand and blew it off, saying, 'Fly away, little creature,\nthe world is large enough for both you and me!'\"\n\n\"That little anecdote of yours, Mr. Benedict,\" said the captain,\nsmiling, \"is a good deal older than Sir John Franklin. It is told, in\nnearly the same words, about Uncle Toby, in Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy';\nonly there it was not a mosquito, it was a common fly.\"\n\n\"And was Uncle Toby an entomologist?\" asked Benedict; \"did he ever\nreally live?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the captain, \"he was only a character in a novel.\"\n\nCousin Benedict gave a look of utter contempt, and Captain Hull and Mrs\nWeldon could not resist laughing.\n\nSuch is only one instance of the way in which Cousin Benedict\ninvariably brought it about that all conversation with him ultimately\nturned upon his favourite pursuit, and all along, throughout the\nmonotonous hours of smooth sailing, while the \"Pilgrim\" was making her\nlittle headway to the east, he showed his own devotion to his pet\nscience, by seeking to enlist new disciples. First of all, he tried his\npowers of persuasion upon Dick Sands, but soon finding that the young\napprentice had no taste for entomological mysteries, he gave him up and\nturned his attention to the negroes. Nor was he much more successful\nwith them; one after another, Tom, Bat, Act\u00c3\u00a6on, and Austin had all\nwithdrawn themselves from his instructions, and the class at last was\nreduced to the single person of Hercules; but in him the enthusiastic\nnaturalist thought he had discovered a latent talent which could\ndistinguish between a parasite and a thysanura.\n\nHercules accordingly submitted to pass a considerable portion of his\nleisure in the observation of every variety of coleoptera; he was\nencouraged to study the extensive collection of stag-beetles,\ntiger-beetles and lady-birds; and although at times the enthusiast\ntrembled to see some of his most delicate and fragile specimens in the\nhuge grasp of his pupil, he soon learned that the man's gentle docility\nwas a sufficient guarantee against his clumsiness.\n\nWhile the science of entomology was thus occupying its two votaries,\nMrs. Weldon was giving her own best attention to the education of\nMaster Jack. Reading and writing she undertook to teach herself, while\nshe entrusted the instruction in arithmetic to the care of Dick Sands.\nUnder the conviction that a child of five years will make a much more\nrapid progress if something like amusement be combined with his\nlessons, Mrs. Weldon would not teach her boy to spell by the use of an\nordinary school primer, but used a set of cubes, on the sides of which\nthe various letters were painted in red. After first making a word and\nshowing it to Jack, she set him to put it together without her help,\nand it was astonishing how quickly the child advanced, and how many\nhours he would spend in this way, both in the cabin and on deck. There\nwere more than fifty cubes, which, besides the alphabet, included all\nthe digits; so that they were of service for Dick Sands' lessons as\nwell as for her own. She was more than satisfied with her device.\n\nOn the morning of the 9th an incident occurred which could not fail to\nbe observed as somewhat remarkable. Jack was half lying, half sitting\non the deck, amusing himself with his letters, and had just finished\nputting together a word with which he intended to puzzle old Tom, who,\nwith his hand sheltering his eyes, was pretending not to see the\ndifficulty which was being labouriously prepared to bewilder him; all\nat once, Dingo, who had been gambolling round the child, made a sudden\npause, lifted his right paw, and wagged his tail convulsively. Then\ndarting down upon a capital S, he seized it in his mouth, and carried\nit some paces away.\n\n\"Oh, Dingo, Dingo! you mustn't eat my letters!\" shouted the child.\n\nBut the dog had already dropped the block of wood, and coming back\nagain, picked up another, which he laid quietly by the side of the\nfirst. This time it was a capital V. Jack uttered an exclamation of\nastonishment which brought to his side not only his mother, but the\ncaptain and Dick, who were both on deck. In answer to their inquiry as\nto what had occurred, Jack cried out in the greatest excitement that\nDingo knew how to read. At any rate he was sure that he knew his\nletters.\n\nDick Sands smiled and stooped to take back the letters. Dingo snarled\nand showed his teeth, but the apprentice was not frightened; he carried\nhis point, and replaced the two blocks among the rest. Dingo in an\ninstant pounced upon them again, and having drawn them to his side,\nlaid a paw upon each of them, as if to signify his intention of\nretaining them in his possession. Of the other letters of the alphabet\nhe took no notice at all.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" said Mrs. Weldon; \"he has picked out S V again.\"\n\n\"S V!\" repeated the captain thoughtfully; \"are not those the letters\nthat form the initials on his collar?\"\n\nAnd turning to the old negro, he continued,--\n\n\"Tom didn't you say that this dog did not always belong to the captain\nof the 'Waldeck'?\"\n\n\"To the best of my belief,\" replied Tom, \"the captain had only had him\nabout two years. I often heard him tell how he found him at the mouth\nof the Congo.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that he never knew where the animal came from, or to\nwhom he had previously belonged?\" asked Captain Hull.\n\n\"Never,\" answered Tom, shaking his head; \"a lost dog is worse to\nidentify than a lost child; you see, he can't make himself understood\nany way.\"\n\nThe captain made no answer, but stood musing; Mrs. Weldon interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"These letters, captain, seem to be recalling something to your\nrecollection.\n\n\"I can hardly go so far as to say that, Mrs. Weldon,\" he replied; \"but\nI cannot help associating them with the fate of a brave explorer.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean? said the lady.\n\n\"In 1871, just two years ago,\" the captain continued, \"a French\ntraveller, under the auspices of the Geographical Society of Paris, set\nout for the purpose of crossing Africa from west to east. His\nstarting-point was the mouth of the Congo, and his exit was designed to\nbe as near as possible to Cape Deldago, at the mouth of the River\nRovouma, of which he was to ascertain the true course. The name of this\nman was Samuel Vernon, and I confess it strikes me as somewhat a\nstrange coincidence that the letters engraved on Dingo's collar should\nbe Vernon's initials.\"\n\n[Illustration: Jack cried out in the greatest excitement that Dingo\nknew how to read]\n\n\"Is nothing known about this traveller?\" asked Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Nothing was ever heard of him after his first departure. It appears\nquite certain that he failed to reach the east coast, and it can only\nbe conjectured either that he died upon his way, or that he was made\nprisoner by the natives; and if so, and this dog ever belonged to him,\nthe animal might have made his way back to the sea-coast, where, just\nabout the time that would be likely, the captain of the 'Waldeck'\npicked him up.\"\n\n\"But you have no reason to suppose, Captain Hull, that Vernon ever\nowned a dog of this description?\"\n\n\"I own I never heard of it,\" said the captain; \"but still the\nimpression fixes itself on my mind that the dog must have been his; how\nhe came to know one letter from another, it is not for me to pretend to\nsay. Look at him now, madam! he seems not only to be reading the\nletters for himself, but to be inviting us to come and read them with\nhim.\"\n\nWhilst Mrs. Weldon was watching the dog with much amusement, Dick\nSands, who had listened to the previous conversation, took the\nopportunity of asking the captain whether the traveller Vernon had\nstarted on his expedition quite alone.\n\n\"That is really more than I can tell you, my boy,\" answered Captain\nHull; \"but I should almost take it for granted that he would have a\nconsiderable retinue of natives.\"\n\nThe captain spoke without being aware that Negoro had meanwhile quietly\nstolen on deck. At first his presence was quite unnoticed, and no one\nobserved the peculiar glance with which he looked at the two letters\nover which Dingo still persisted in keeping guard. The dog, however, no\nsooner caught sight of the cook than he began to bristle with rage,\nwhereupon Negoro, with a threatening gesture which seemed half\ninvoluntary, withdrew immediately to his accustomed quarters.\n\nThe incident did not escape the captain's observation.\n\n\"No doubt,\" he said, \"there is some mystery here;\" and he was pondering\nthe matter over in his mind when Dick Sands spoke.\n\n\"Don't you think it very singular, sir, that this dog should have such\na knowledge of the alphabet?\"\n\nJack here put in his word.\n\n\"My mamma has told me about a dog whose name was Munito, who could read\nas well as a schoolmaster, and could play dominoes.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon smiled.\n\n\"I am afraid, my child, that that dog was not quite so learned as you\nimagine. I don't suppose he knew one letter from another; but his\nmaster, who was a clever American, having found out that the animal had\na very keen sense of hearing, taught him some curious tricks.\"\n\n\"What sort of tricks?\" asked Dick, who was almost as much interested as\nlittle Jack.\n\n\"When he had to perform in public,\" continued Mrs. Weldon, \"a lot of\nletters like yours, Jack, were spread out upon a table, and Munito\nwould put together any word that the company should propose, either\naloud or in a whisper, to his master. The creature would walk about\nuntil he stopped at the very letter which was wanted. The secret of it\nall was that the dog's owner gave him a signal when he was to stop by\nrattling a little tooth-pick in his pocket, making a slight noise that\nonly the dog's ears were acute enough to perceive.\"\n\nDick was highly amused, and said,--\n\n\"But that was a dog who could do nothing wonderful without his master.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" answered Mrs. Weldon; \"and it surprises me very much to see\nDingo picking out these letters without a master to direct him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Negoro, with a threatening gesture that seemed half\ninvoluntary, withdrew immediately to his accustomed quarters.]\n\n\"The more one thinks of it, the more strange it is,\" said Captain Hull;\n\"but, after all, Dingo's sagacity is not greater than that of the dog\nwhich rang the convent bell in order to get at the dish that was\nreserved for passing beggars; nor than that of the dog who had to turn\na spit every other day, and never could be induced to work when it was\nnot his proper day. Dingo evidently has no acquaintance with any other\nletters except the two S V; and some circumstance which we can never\nguess has made him familiar with them.\"\n\n\"What a pity he cannot talk!\" exclaimed the apprentice; \"we should know\nwhy it is that he always shows his teeth at Negoro.\"\n\n\"And tremendous teeth they are!\" observed the captain, as Dingo at that\nmoment opened his mouth, and made a display of his formidable fangs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nA WHALE IN SIGHT.\n\n\nIt was only what might be expected that the dog's singular exhibition\nof sagacity should repeatedly form a subject of conversation between\nMrs. Weldon, the captain, and Dick. The young apprentice in particular\nbegan to entertain a lurking feeling of distrust towards Negoro,\nalthough it must be owned that the man's conduct in general afforded no\ntangible grounds for suspicion.\n\nNor as it only among the stern passengers that Dingo's remarkable feat\nwas discussed; amongst the crew in the bow the dog not only soon gained\nthe reputation of being able to read, but was almost credited with\nbeing able to write too, as well as any sailor among them; indeed the\nchief wonder was that he did not speak.\n\n\"Perhaps he can,\" suggested Bolton, the helmsman, \"and likely enough\nsome fine day we shall have him coming to ask about our bearings, and\nto inquire which way the wind lies.\"\n\n\"Ah! why not?\" assented another sailor; \"parrots talk, and magpies\ntalk; why shouldn't a dog? For my part, I should guess it must be\neasier to speak with a mouth than with a beak.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Howick, the boatswain; \"only a quadruped has\nnever yet been known to do it.\"\n\nPerhaps, however, the worthy fellow would have been amazed to hear that\na certain Danish _savant_ once possesed a dog that could actually\npronounce quite distinctly nearly twenty different words, demonstrating\nthat the construction of the glottis, the aperture at the top of the\nwindpipe, was adapted for the emission of regular sounds: of course the\nanimal attached no meaning to the words it uttered any more than a\nparrot or a jay can comprehend their own chatterings.\n\n[Illustration: \"This Dingo is nothing out of the way.\"]\n\nThus, unconsciously, Dingo had become the hero of the hour. On several\nseparate occasions Captain Hull repeated the experiment of spreading\nout the blocks before him, but invariably with the same result; the dog\nnever failed, without the slightest hesitation, to pick out the two\nletters, leaving all the rest of the alphabet quite unnoticed.\n\nCousin Benedict alone, somewhat ostentatiously, professed to take no\ninterest in the circumstance.\n\n\"You cannot suppose,\" he said to Captain Hull, after various\nrepetitions of the trick, \"that dogs are to be reckoned the only\nanimals endowed with intelligence Rats, you know, will always leave a\nsinking ship, and beavers invariably raise their dams before the\napproach of a flood. Did not the horses of Nicomedes, Scanderberg and\nOppian die of grief for the loss of their masters? Have there not been\ninstances of donkeys with wonderful memories? Birds, too, have been\ntrained to do the most remarkable things; they have been taught to\nwrite word after word at their master's dictation; there are cockatoos\nwho can count the people in a room as accurately as a mathematician;\nand haven't you heard of the old Cardinal's parrot that he would not\npart with for a hundred gold crowns because it could repeat the\nApostles' creed from beginning to end without a blunder? And insects,\"\nhe continued, warming into enthusiasm, \"how marvellously they vindicate\nthe axiom--\n\n  'In minimis maximus Deus!'\n\nAre not the structures of ants the very models for the architects of a\ncity? Has the diving-bell of the aquatic argyroneta ever been surpassed\nby the invention of the most skilful student of mechanical art? And\ncannot fleas go through a drill and fire a gun as well as the most\naccomplished artilleryman? This Dingo is nothing out of the way. I\nsuppose he belongs to some unclassed species of mastiff. Perhaps one\nday or other he may come to be identified as the 'canis alphabeticus'\nof New Zealand.\"\n\nThe worthy entomologist delivered this and various similar harangues;\nbut Dingo, nevertheless, retained his high place in the general\nestimation, and by the occupants of the forecastle was regarded as\nlittle short of a phenomenon. The feeling, otherwise universal, was not\nin any degree shared by Negoro, and it is not improbable that the man\nwould have been tempted to some foul play with the dog if the open\nsympathies of the crew had not kept him in check. More than ever he\nstudiously avoided coming in contact in any way with the animal, and\nDick Sands in his own mind was quite convinced that since the incident\nof the letters, the cook's hatred of the dog had become still more\nintense.\n\nAfter continual alternations with long and wearisome calms the\nnorth-east wind perceptibly moderated, and on the both, Captain Hull\nreally began to hope that such a change would ensue as to allow the\nschooner to run straight before the wind. Nineteen days had elapsed\nsince the \"Pilgrim\" had left Auckland, a period not so long but that\nwith a favourable breeze it might be made up at last. Some days however\nwere yet to elapse before the wind veered round to the anticipated\nquarter.\n\nIt has been already stated that this portion of the Pacific is almost\nalways deserted. It is out of the line of the American and Australian\nsteam-packets, and except a whaler had been brought into it by some\nsuch exceptional circumstances as the \"Pilgrim,\" it was quite unusual\nto see one in this latitude.\n\nBut, however void of traffic was the surface of the sea, to none but an\nunintelligent mind could it appear monotonous or barren of interest.\nThe poetry of the ocean breathes forth in its minute and almost\nimperceptible changes. A marine plant, a tuft of seaweed lightly\nfurrowing the water, a drifting spar with its unknown history, may\nafford unlimited scope--for the imagination; every little drop passing,\nin its process of evaporation, backwards and forwards from sea to sky,\nmight perchance reveal its own special secret; and happy are those\nminds which are capable of a due appreciation of the mysteries of air\nand ocean.\n\n[Illustration: Occasionally Dick Sands would take a pistol, and now and\nthen a rifle.]\n\nAbove the surface as well as below, the restless flood is ever teaming\nwith animal life; and the passengers on board the \"Pilgrim\" derived no\nlittle amusement from watching great flocks of birds migrating\nnorthwards to escape the rigour of the polar winter, and ever and again\ndescending in rapid flight to secure some tiny fish. Occasionally Dick\nSands would take a pistol, and now and then a rifle, and, thanks to Mr.\nWeldon's former instructions, would bring down various specimens of the\nfeathered tribe.\n\nSometimes white petrels would congregate in considerable numbers near\nthe schooner; and sometimes petrels of another species, with brown\nborders on their wings, would come in sight; now there would be flocks\nof damiers skimming the water; and now groups of penguins, whose clumsy\ngait appears so ludicrous on shore; but, as Captain Hull pointed out,\nwhen their stumpy wings were employed as fins, they were a match for\nthe most rapid of fish, so that sailors have often mistaken them for\nbonitos.\n\nHigh over head, huge albatrosses, their outspread wings measuring ten\nfeet from tip to tip, would soar aloft, thence to swoop down towards\nthe deep, into which they plunged their beaks in search of food. Such\nincidents and scenes as these were infinite in their variety, and it\nwas accordingly only for minds that were obtuse to the charms of nature\nthat the voyage could be monotonous.\n\nOn the day the wind shifted, Mrs. Weldon was walking up and down on the\n\"Pilgrim's\" stern, when her attention was attracted by what seemed to\nher a strange phenomenon. All of a sudden, far as the eye could reach,\nthe sea had assumed a reddish hue, as if it were tinged with blood.\n\nBoth Dick and Jack were standing close behind her, and she cried,--\n\n\"Look, Dick, look! the sea is all red. Is it a sea-weed that is making\nthe water so strange a colour?\n\n\"No,\" answered Dick, \"it is not a weed; it is what the sailors call\nwhales' food; it is formed, I believe, of innumerable myriads of minute\ncrustacea.\"\n\n\"Crustacea they may be,\" replied Mrs. Weldon, \"but they must be so\nsmall that they are mere insects. Cousin Benedict no doubt will like to\nsee them.\"\n\nShe called aloud,--\n\n\"Benedict! Benedict! come here! we have a sight here to interest you.\"\n\nThe amateur naturalist slowly emerged from his cabin followed by\nCaptain Hull.\n\n\"Ah! yes, I see!\" said the captain; \"whales' food; just the opportunity\nfor you, Mr. Benedict; a chance not to be thrown away for studying one\nof the most curious of the crustacea.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" ejaculated Benedict contemptuously; \"utter nonsense!\"\n\n\"Why? what do you mean, Mr. Benedict?\" retorted the captain; \"surely\nyou, as an entomologist, must know that I am right in my conviction\nthat these crustacea belong to one of the six classes of the\narticulata.\"\n\nThe disdain of Cousin Benedict was expressed by a repeated sneer.\n\n\"Are you not aware, sir, that my researches as an entomologist are\nconfined entirely to the hexapoda?\"\n\nCaptain Hull, unable to repress a smile, only answered\ngood-humouredly,--\n\n\"I see, sir, your tastes do not lie in the same direction as those of\nthe whale.\"\n\nAnd turning to Mrs. Weldon, he continued,--\n\n\"To whalemen, madam, this is a sight that speaks for itself. It is a\ntoken that we ought to lose no time in getting out our lines and\nlooking to the state of our harpoons. There is game not far away.\"\n\nJack gave vent to his astonishment.\n\n\"Do you mean that great creatures like whales feed on such tiny things\nas these?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy,\" said the captain; \"and I daresay they are as nice to\nthem as semolina and ground rice are to you.\n\n\"When a whale gets into the middle of them he has nothing to do but to\nopen his jaws, and, in a minute, hundreds of thousands of these minute\ncreatures are inside the fringe or whalebone around his palate, and he\nis sure of a good mouthful.\"\n\n\"So you see, Jack,\" said Dick, \"the whale gets his shrimps without the\ntrouble of shelling them.\"\n\n\"And when he has just closed his snappers is the very time to give him\na good taste of the harpoon,\" added Captain Hull.\n\nThe words had hardly escaped the captain's lips when a shout from one\nof the sailors announced,--\n\n\"A whale to larboard!\"\n\n\"There's the whale!\" repeated the captain. All his professional\ninstincts were aroused in an instant, and he hurried to the bow,\nfollowed in eager curiosity by all the stern passengers.\n\nEven Cousin Benedict loitered up in the rear, constrained, in spite of\nhimself, to take a share in the general interest.\n\nThere was no doubt about the matter. Four miles or so to windward an\nunusual commotion in the water betokened to experienced eyes the\npresence of a whale; but the distance was too great to permit a\nreasonable conjecture to be formed as to which species of those\nmammifers the creature belonged.\n\nThree distinct species are familiarly known. First there is the Right\nwhale, which is ordinarily sought for in the northern fisheries. The\naverage length of this cetacean is sixty feet, though it has been known\nto attain the length of eighty feet. It has no dorsal fin, and beneath\nits skin is a thick layer of blubber. One of these monsters alone will\nyield as much as a hundred barrels of oil.\n\nThen there is the Hump-back, a typical representative of the species\n\"bal\u00c3\u00a6noptera,\" a definition which may at first sight appear to possess\nan interest for an entomologist, but which really refers to two white\ndorsal fins, each half as wide as the body, resembling a pair of wings,\nand in their formation similar to those of the flying-fish. It must be\nowned, however, that a flying whale would decidedly be a _rara avis_.\n\nLastly, there is the Jubarte, commonly known as the Finback. It is\nprovided with a dorsal fin, and in length not unfrequently is a match\nfor the gigantic Right whale.\n\nWhile it was impossible to decide to which of the three species the\nwhale in the distance really belonged, the general impression inclined\nto the belief that it was a jubarte.\n\nWith longing eyes Captain Hull and his crew gazed at the object of\ngeneral attraction. Just as irresistibly as it is said a clockmaker is\ndrawn on to examine the mechanism of every clock which chance may throw\nin his way, so is a whaleman ever anxious to plunge his harpoon into\nany whale that he can get within his reach. The larger the game the\nmore keen the excitement; and no elephant-hunter's eagerness ever\nsurpasses the zest of the whale-fisher when once started in pursuit of\nthe prey.\n\nTo the crew the sight of the whale was the opening of an unexpected\nopportunity, and no wonder they were fired with the burning hope that\neven now they might do something to supply the deficiency of their\nmeagre haul throughout the season.\n\nFar away as the creature still was, the captain's practised eye soon\nenabled him to detect various indications that satisfied him as to its\ntrue species. Amongst other things that arrested his attention, he\nobserved a column of water and vapour ejected from the nostrils. \"It\nisn't a right whale,\" he said; \"if so, its spout would be smaller and\nit would rise higher in the air. And I do not think it is a hump-back.\nI cannot hear the hump-back's roar. Dick, tell me, what do you think\nabout it?\"\n\nWith a critical eye Dick Sands looked long and steadily at the spout.\n\n\"It blows out water, sir,\" said the apprentice, \"water, as well as\nvapour. I should think it is a finback. But it must be a rare large\none.\"\n\n\"Seventy feet, at least!\" rejoined the captain, flushing with his\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"What a big fellow!\" said Jack, catching the excitement of his elders.\n\n[Illustration: \"What a big fellow!\"]\n\n\"Ah, Jack, my boy,\" chuckled the captain, \"the whale little thinks who\nare watching him enjoy his breakfast!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the boatswain; \"a dozen such gentlemen as that would\nfreight a craft twice the size of ours; but this one, if only we can\nget him, will go a good way towards filling our empty barrels.\"\n\n\"Rather rough work, you know,\" said Dick, \"to attack a finback!\"\n\n\"You are right, Dick,\" answered the captain; \"the boat has yet to be\nbuilt which is strong enough to resist the flap of a jubarte's tail.\"\n\n\"But the profit is worth the risk, captain, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You are right again, Dick,\" replied Captain Hull, and as he spoke, he\nclambered on to the bowsprit in order that he might get a better view\nof the whale.\n\nThe crew were as eager as their captain. Mounted on the fore-shrouds,\nthey scanned the movements of their coveted prey in the distance,\nfreely descanting upon the profit to be made out of a good finback and\ndeclaring that it would be a thousand pities if this chance of filling\nthe casks below should be permitted to be lost.\n\nCaptain Hull was perplexed. He bit his nails and knitted his brow.\n\n\"Mamma!\" cried little Jack, \"I should so much like to see a whale\nclose,--quite close, you know.\"\n\n\"And so you shall, my boy,\" replied the captain, who was standing by,\nand had come to the resolve that if his men would back him, he would\nmake an attempt to capture the prize.\n\nHe turned to his crew,--\n\n\"My men! what do you think? shall we make the venture? Remember, we are\nall alone; we have no whalemen to help us; we must rely upon ourselves;\nI have thrown a harpoon before now; I can throw a harpoon again; what\ndo you say?\"\n\nThe crew responded with a ringing cheer,--\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir! Ay, ay!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR AN ATTACK.\n\n\nGreat was the excitement that now prevailed, and the question of an\nattempt to capture the sea-monster became the ruling theme of\nconversation. Mrs. Weldon expressed considerable doubt as to the\nprudence of venturing upon so great a risk with such a limited number\nof hands, but when Captain Hull assured her that he had more than once\nsuccessfully attacked a whale with a single boat, and that for his part\nhe had no fear of failure, she made no further remonstrance, and\nappeared quite satisfied.\n\nHaving formed his resolve, the captain lost no time in setting about\nhis preliminary arrangements. He could not really conceal from his own\nmind that the pursuit of a finback was always a matter of some peril,\nand he was anxious, accordingly, to make every possible provision which\nforethought could devise against all emergencies.\n\nBesides her long-boat, which was kept between the two masts, the\n\"Pilgrim\" had three whale-boats, two of them slung to the starboard and\nlarboard davits, and the third at the stern, outside the taffrail.\nDuring the fishing season, when the crew was reinforced by a hired\ncomplement of New Zealand whalemen, all three of these boats would be\nbrought at once into requisition, but at present the whole crew of the\n\"Pilgrim\" was barely sufficient to man one of the three boats. Tom and\nhis friends were ready to volunteer their assistance, but any offers of\nservice from them were necessarily declined; the manipulation of a\nwhale-boat can only be entrusted to those who are experienced in the\nwork, as a false turn of the tiller or a premature stroke of the oar\nmay in a moment compromise the safety of the whole party. Thus\ncompelled to take all his trained sailors with him on his venturous\nexpedition, the captain had no alternative than to leave his apprentice\nin charge of the schooner during his absence. Dick's choice would have\nbeen very much in favour of taking a share in the whale-hunt, but he\nhad the good sense to know that the developed strength of a man would\nbe of far greater service in the boat, and accordingly without a murmur\nhe resigned himself to remain behind.\n\nOf the five sailors who were to man the boat, there were four to take\nthe oars, whilst Howick the boatswain was to manage the oar at the\nstern, which on these occasions generally replaces an ordinary rudder\nas being quicker in action in the event of any of the side oars being\ndisabled. The post of harpooner was of course assigned to Captain Hull,\nto whose lot it would consequently fall first to hurl his weapon at the\nwhale, then to manage the unwinding of the line to which the harpoon\nwas attached, and finally to kill the creature by lance-wounds when it\nshould emerge again from below the sea.\n\nA method sometimes employed for commencing an attack is to place a sort\nof small cannon on the bows or deck of the boat and to discharge from\nit either a harpoon or some explosive bullets, which make frightful\nlacerations on the body of the victim; but the \"Pilgrim\" was not\nprovided with apparatus of this description; not only are all the\ncontrivances of this kind very costly and difficult to manage, but the\nfishermen generally are averse to innovations, and prefer the\nold-fashioned harpoons. It was with these alone that Captain Hull was\nnow about to encounter the finback that was lying some four miles\ndistant from his ship.\n\nThe weather promised as favourably as could be for the enterprise. The\nsea was calm, and the wind moreover was still moderating, so that there\nwas no likelihood of the schooner drifting away during the captain's\nabsence.\n\nWhen the starboard whale-boat had been lowered, and the four sailors\nhad entered it, Howick passed a couple of harpoons down to them, and\nsome lances which had been carefully sharpened; to these were added\nfive coils of stout and supple rope, each 600 feet long, for a whale\nwhen struck often dives so deeply that even these lengths of line\nknotted together are found to be insufficient. After these implements\nof attack had been properly stowed in the bows, the crew had only to\nawait the pleasure of their captain.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim,\" before the sailors left her, had been made to heave to,\nand the yards were braced so as to secure her remaining as stationary\nas possible. As the time drew near for the captain to quit her, he gave\na searching look all round to satisfy himself that everything was in\norder; he saw that the halyards were properly tightened, and the sails\ntrimmed as they should be, and then calling the young apprentice to his\nside, he said,--\n\n\"Now, Dick, I am going to leave you for a few hours: while I am away, I\nhope that it will not be necessary for you to make any movement\nwhatever. However, you must be on the watch. It is not very likely, but\nit is possible that this finback may carry us out to some distance. If\nso, you will have to follow; and in that case, I am sure you may rely\nupon Tom and his friends for assistance.\"\n\nOne and all, the negroes assured the captain of their willingness to\nobey Dick's instructions, the sturdy Hercules rolling up his capacious\nshirt-sleeves as if to show that he was ready for immediate action.\n\nThe captain went on,--\n\n\"The weather is beautifully fine, Dick, and I see no prospect of the\nwind freshening; but come what may, I have one direction to give you\nwhich I strictly enforce. You must not leave the ship. If I want you to\nfollow us, I will hoist a flag on the boat-hook.\"\n\n\"You may trust me, sir,\" answered Dick; \"and I will keep a good\nlook-out.\"\n\n\"All right, my lad; keep a cool head and a good heart. You are second\ncaptain now, you know. I never heard of any one of your age being\nplaced in such a post; be a credit to your position!\"\n\nDick blushed, and the bright flush that rose to his cheeks spoke more\nthan words.\n\n\"The lad may be trusted,\" murmured the captain to himself; \"he is as\nmodest as he is courageous. Yes; he may be trusted.\"\n\nIt cannot be denied that the captain was not wholly without compunction\nat the step he was taking; he was aware of the danger to which he was\nexposing himself, but he beguiled himself with the persuasion that it\nwas only for a few hours; and his fisherman's instinct was very keen.\nIt was not only for himself; the desire upon the part of the crew was\nalmost irresistibly strong that every opportunity ought to be employed\nfor making the cargo of the schooner equal to her owner's expectations.\nAnd so he finally prepared to start.\n\n\"I wish you all success!\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Many thanks!\" he replied.\n\nLittle Jack put in his word,--\n\n\"And you will try and catch the whale without hurting him much?\"\n\n\"All right, young gentleman,\" answered the captain; \"he shall hardly\nfeel the tip of our fingers!\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Cousin Benedict, as if he had been pondering the\nexpedition in relation to his pet science, \"sometimes there are strange\ninsects clinging to the backs of these great mammifers; do you think\nyou are likely to procure me any specimens?\"\n\n\"You shall soon have the opportunity of investigating for yourself,\"\nwas the captain's reply.\n\n\"And you, Tom; we shall be looking to you for help in cutting up our\nprize, when we get it alongside,\" continued he.\n\n\"We shall be quite ready, sir,\" said the negro.\n\n\"One thing more, Dick,\" added the captain; \"you may as well be getting\nup the empty barrels out of the hold; they will be all ready.\"\n\n\"It shall be done, sir,\" answered Dick promptly.\n\nIf everything went well it was the intention that the whale after it\nhad been killed should be towed to the side of the schooner, where it\nwould be firmly lashed. Then the sailors with their feet in spiked\nshoes would get upon its back and proceed to cut the blubber, from head\nto tail, in long strips, which would first be divided into lumps about\na foot and a half square, the lumps being subsequently chopped into\nsmaller portions capable of being stored away in casks. The ordinary\nrule would be for a ship, as soon as the flaying was complete, to make\nits way to land where the blubber could be at once boiled down, an\noperation by which it is reduced by about a third of its weight, and by\nwhich it yields all its oil, the only portion of it which is of any\nvalue. Under present circumstances, however, Captain Hull would not\nthink of melting down the blubber until his arrival at Valparaiso, and\nas he was sanguine that the wind would soon set in a favourable\ndirection, he calculated that he should reach that port in less than\nthree weeks, a period during which his cargo would not be deteriorated.\n\nThe latest movement with regard to the \"Pilgrim\" had been to bring her\nsomewhat nearer the spot where the spouts of vapour indicated the\npresence of the coveted prize. The creature continued to swim about in\nthe reddened waters, opening and shutting its huge jaws like an\nautomaton, and absorbing at every mouthful whole myriads of animalcula.\nNo one entertained a fear that it would try to make an escape; it was\nthe unanimous verdict that it was \"a fighting whale,\" and one that\nwould resist all attacks to the very end.\n\nAs Captain Hull descended the rope-ladder and took his place in the\nfront of the boat, Mrs. Weldon and all on board renewed their good\nwishes.\n\nDingo stood with his fore paws upon the taffrail, and appeared as much\nas any to be bidding the adventurous party farewell.\n\nWhen the boat pushed off, those who were left on board the \"Pilgrim\"\nmade their way slowly to the bows, from which the most extensive view\nwas to be gained.\n\nThe captain's voice came from the retreating boat,--\n\n\"A sharp look-out, Dick; a sharp look-out; one eye on us, one on the\nship!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Captain's voice came from the retreating boat. _Page\n72_]\n\n[Illustration: \"I must get you to keep your eye upon that man\" _Page\n73._]\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied the apprentice.\n\nBy his gestures the captain showed that he was under some emotion; he\ncalled out again, but the boat had made such headway that it was too\nfar off for any words to be heard.\n\nDingo broke out into a piteous howl.\n\nThe dog was still standing erect, his eye upon the boat in the\ndistance. To the sailors, ever superstitious, the howling was not\nreassuring. Even Mrs. Weldon was startled.\n\n\"Why, Dingo, Dingo,\" she exclaimed, \"this isn't the way to encourage\nyour friends. Come here, sir; you must behave better than that!\"\n\nSinking down on all fours the animal walked slowly up to Mrs. Weldon,\nand began to lick her hand.\n\n\"Ah!\" muttered old Tom, shaking his head solemnly, \"he doesn't wag his\ntail at all. A bad omen.\"\n\nAll at once the dog gave a savage growl.\n\nAs she turned her head, Mrs Weldon caught sight of Negoro making his\nway to the forecastle, probably actuated by the general spirit of\ncuriosity to follow the maneuvers of the whale-boat. He stopped and\nseized a handspike as soon as he saw the ferocious attitude of the dog.\n\nThe lady was quite unable to pacify the animal, which seemed about to\nfly upon the throat of the cook, but Dick Sands called out loudly,--\n\n\"Down, Dingo, down!\"\n\nThe dog obeyed; but it seemed to be with extreme reluctance that he\nreturned to Dick's side; he continued to growl, as if still remembering\nhis rage. Negoro had turned very pale, and having put down the\nhandspike, made his way cautiously back to his own quarters.\n\n\"Hercules,\" said Dick, \"I must get you to keep your eye upon that man.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" he answered, significantly clenching his fists.\n\nDick took his station at the helm, whence he kept an earnest watch upon\nthe whale-boat, which under the vigourous plying of the seamen's oars\nhad become little more than a speck upon the water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nA CATASTROPHE.\n\n\nExperienced whaleman as he was, Captain Hull knew the difficulty of the\ntask he had undertaken, he was alive to the importance of making his\napproach to the whale from the leeward, so that there should be no\nsound to apprize the creature of the proximity of the boat. He had\nperfect confidence in his boatswain, and felt sure that he would take\nthe proper course to insure a favourable result to the enterprise.\n\n\"We mustn't show ourselves too soon, Howick,\" he said.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Howick, \"I am going to skirt the edge of the\ndiscoloured water, and I shall take good care to get well to leeward.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the captain answered, and turning to the crew said, \"now,\nmy lads, as quietly as you can.\"\n\nMuffling the sound of their oars by placing straw in the rowlocks, and\navoiding the least unnecessary noise, the men skilfully propelled the\nboat along the outline of the water tinged by the crustacea, so that\nwhile the starboard oars still dipped in the green and limpid sea, the\nlarboard were in the deep-dyed waves, and seemed as though they were\ndripping with blood.\n\n\"Wine on this side, water on that,\" said one of the sailors jocosely.\n\n\"But neither of them fit to drink,\" rejoined the captain sharply, \"so\njust hold your tongue!\"\n\nUnder Howick's guidance the boat now glided stealthily on to the greasy\nsurface of the reddened waters, where she appeared to float as on a\npool of oil. The whale seemed utterly unconscious of the attack that\nwas threatening it, and allowed the boat to come nearer without\nexhibiting any sign of alarm.\n\n[Illustration: The whale seemed utterly unconscious of the attack that\nwas threatening it]\n\nThe wide circuit which the captain had thought it advisable to take had\nthe effect of considerably increasing the distance between his boat and\nthe \"Pilgrim,\" whilst the strange rapidity with which objects at sea\nbecome diminished in apparent magnitude, as if viewed through the wrong\nend of a telescope, made the ship look farther away than she actually\nwas.\n\nAnother half-hour elapsed, and at the end of it the captain found\nhimself so exactly to leeward that the huge body of the whale was\nprecisely intermediate between his boat and the \"Pilgrim.\" A closer\napproach must now be made; every precaution must be used; but the time\nhad come to get sufficiently near for the harpoon to be discharged.\n\n\"Slowly, my men,\" said the captain, in a low voice; \"slowly and softly!\"\n\nHowick muttered something that implied that the whale had ceased\nblowing so hard, and that it was aware of their approach; the captain,\nupon this, enjoined the most perfect silence, but urged his crew\nonwards, until, in five or six minutes, they were within a cable's\nlength of the finback. Erect at the stern the boatswain stood, and\nmanoeuvred to get the boat as close as possible to the whale's left\nflank, while he made it an object of special care to keep beyond the\nreach of its formidable tail, one stroke of which could involve them\nall in instantaneous disaster.\n\nThe manipulation of the boat thus left to the boatswain, the captain\nmade ready for the arduous effort that was before him. At the extreme\nbow, harpoon in hand, with his legs somewhat astride so as to insure\nhis equilibrium, he stood prepared to plunge his weapon into the mass\nthat rose above the surface of the sea. By his side, coiled in a pail,\nand with one end firmly attached to the harpoon, was the first of the\nfive lines which if the whale should dive to a considerable depth,\nwould have to be joined end to end, one after another.\n\n\"Are you ready, my lads?\" said he, hardly above a whisper.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied Howick, speaking as gently as his master, and\ngiving a firmer grip to the rudder-oar that he held in his hands.\n\n\"Then, alongside at once,\" was the captain's order, which was promptly\nobeyed, so that in a few minutes the boat was only about ten feet from\nthe body of the whale. The animal did not move. Was it asleep? In that\ncase there was hope that the very first stroke might be fatal. But it\nwas hardly likely. Captain Hull felt only too sure that there was some\ndifferent cause to be assigned for its remaining so still and\nstationary; and the rapid glances of the boatswain showed that he\nentertained the same suspicion. But it was no time for speculation; the\nmoment for action had arrived, and no attempt was made on either hand\nto exchange ideas upon the subject.\n\nCaptain Hull seized his weapon tightly by the shaft, and having poised\nit several times in the air, in order to make more sure of his aim, he\ngathered all his strength and hurled it against the side of the finback.\n\n\"Backwater!\" he shouted.\n\nThe sailors pushed back with all their might, and the boat in an\ninstant was beyond the range of the creature's tail.\n\nAnd now the immoveableness of the animal was at once accounted for.\n\n\"See; there's a youngster!\" exclaimed Howick.\n\nAnd he was not mistaken. Startled by the blow of the harpoon the\nmonster had heeled over on to its side, and the movement revealed a\nyoung whale which the mother had been disturbed in the act of suckling.\nIt was a discovery which made Captain Hull aware that the capture of\nthe whale would be attended with double difficulty; he knew; that she\nwould defend \"her little one\" (if such a term can be applied to a\ncreature that was at least twenty feet long) with the most determined\nfury; yet having made what he considered a successful commencement of\nthe attack, he would not be daunted, nor deterred from his endeavour to\nsecure so fine a prize.\n\nThe whale did not, as sometimes happens, make a precipitate dash upon\nthe boat, a proceeding which necessitates the instant cutting of the\nharpoon-line, and an immediate retreat, but it took the far more usual\ncourse of diving downwards almost perpendicularly. It was followed by\nits calf; very soon, however, after rising once again to the surface\nwith a sudden bound, it began swimming along under water with great\nrapidity.\n\nBefore its first plunge Captain Hull and Howick had sufficient\nopportunity to observe that it was an unusually large balaenoptera,\nmeasuring at least eighty feet from head to tail, its colour being of a\nyellowish-brown, dappled with numerous spots of a darker shade.\n\nThe pursuit, or what may be more aptly termed \"the towing,\" of the\nwhale had now fairly commenced. The sailors had shipped their oars, and\nthe whale-boat darted like an arrow along the surface of the waves. In\nspite of the oscillation, which was very violent, Howick succeeded in\nmaintaining equilibrium, and did not need the repeated injunctions with\nwhich the agitated captain urged his boatswain to be upon his guard.\n\nBut fast as the boat flew along, she could not keep pace with the\nwhale, and so rapidly did the line run out that except proper care had\nbeen taken to keep the bucket in which it was coiled filled with water,\nthe friction against the edge of the boat would inevitably have caused\nit to take fire. The whale gave no indication of moderating its speed,\nso that the first line was soon exhausted, and the second had to be\nattached to its end, only to be run out with like rapidity. In a few\nminutes more it was necessary to join on the third line; it was evident\nthat the whale had not been hit in a vital part, and so far from rising\nto the surface, the oblique direction of the rope indicated that the\ncreature was seeking yet greater depths.\n\n\"Confound it!\" exclaimed the captain; \"it seems as if the brute is\ngoing to run out all our line.\"\n\n\"Yes; and see what a distance the animal is dragging us away from the\n'Pilgrim,'\" answered Howick.\n\n\"Sooner or later, however,\" said Captain Hull, \"the thing must come to\nthe surface; she is not a fish, you know.\"\n\n\"She is saving her breath for the sake of her speed,\" said one of the\nsailors with a grin.\n\nBut grin as he might, both he and his companions began to look serious\nwhen the fourth line had to be added to the third, and more serious\nstill when the fifth was added to the fourth. The captain even began to\nmutter imprecations upon the refractory brute that was putting their\npatience to so severe a test.\n\nThe last line was nearly all uncoiled, and the general consternation\nwas growing very great, when there was observed to be a slight\nslackening in the tension.\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" cried the captain; \"the beast has tired herself out at\nlast.\"\n\nCasting his eye towards the \"Pilgrim,\" he saw at a glance that she\ncould not be less than five miles to leeward. It was a long distance,\nbut when, according to his arrangement, he had hoisted the flag on the\nboat-hook which was to be the signal for the ship to approach, he had\nthe satisfaction of seeing that Dick Sands and the negroes at once\nbegan bracing the yards to get as near as possible to the wind. The\nbreeze, however, blew only in short, unsteady puffs, and it was only\ntoo evident that the \"Pilgrim\" would have considerable difficulty in\nworking her way to the whale-boat, even if she succeeded at last.\n\nMeantime, just as had been expected, the whale had risen to the surface\nof the water, the harpoon still fixed firmly in her side. She remained\nmotionless, apparently waiting for her calf, which she had far\nout-distanced in her mad career. Captain Hull ordered his men to pull\ntowards her as rapidly as they could, and on getting close up, two of\nthe sailors, following the captain's example, shipped their oars and\ntook up the long lances with which the whale was now to be attacked.\nHowick held himself in readiness to sheer off quickly in the event of\nthe finback making a turn towards the boat.\n\n\"Now, my lads!\" shouted the captain. \"Look out! take a good aim! no\nfalse shots! Are you ready, Howick?\"\n\n\"Quite ready, captain,\" answered the boatswain, adding, \"but it\nperplexes me altogether to see the brute so quiet all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"It looks suspicious,\" said the captain; \"but never mind; go on!\nstraight ahead!\"\n\nCaptain Hull was becoming more excited every moment.\n\nDuring the time the boat was approaching, the whale had only turned\nround a little in the water without changing its position. It was\nevidently still looking for its calf, which was not to be seen by its\nside. All of a sudden it gave a jerk with its tail which carried it\nsome few yards away.\n\nThe men were all excited. Was the beast going to escape again? Was the\nfatiguing pursuit all to come over a second time? Must not the chase be\nabandoned? Would not the prize have to be given up?\n\nBut no: the whale was not starting on another flight; it had merely\nturned so as to face the boat, and now rapidly beating the water with\nits enormous fins, it commenced a frantic dash forwards.\n\n\"Look out, Howick, she's coming!\" shouted Captain Hull.\n\nThe skilful boatswain was all on the alert; the boat swerved, as if by\ninstinct, so as to avoid the blow, and as the whale passed furiously\nby, she received three tremendous thrusts from the lances of the\ncaptain and the two men, who all endeavoured to strike at some vital\npart. There was a sudden pause. The whale spouted up two gigantic\ncolumns of blood and water, lashed its tail, and, with bounds and\nplunges that were terrible to behold, renewed its angry attack upon the\nboat.\n\nNone but the most determined of whalemen could fail to lose their head\nunder such an assault. Calm and collected, however, the crew remained.\nOnce again did Howick adroitly sheer aside, and once again did the\nthree lances do their deadly work upon the huge carcase as it rolled\nimpetuously past; but this time, so great was the wave that was caused\nby the infuriated animal, that the boat was well-nigh full of water,\nand in imminent danger of being capsized.\n\n\"Bale away, men!\" cried the captain.\n\nPutting down their oars, the other sailors set to work baling with all\ntheir might. Captain Hull cut the harpoon-line, now no longer required,\nbecause the whale, maddened with pain and grief for the loss of its\noffspring, would certainly make no further attempt to escape, but would\nfight desperately to the very end.\n\nThe finback was obviously bent on a third onslaught upon the boat,\nwhich, being in spite of all the men's exertions still more than half\nfull of water, no longer answered readily to the rudder-oar.\n\nNo one thought of flight. The swiftest boat could be overtaken in a\nvery few bounds. There was no alternative but to face the encounter. It\nwas not long in coming. Their previous good fortune failed them. The\nwhale in passing caught the boat with such a violent blow from its\ndorsal fin, that the men lost their footing and the lances missed their\nmark.\n\n\"Where's Howick?\" screamed the captain in alarm.\n\n\"Here I am, captain; all right!\" replied the boatswain, who had\nscrambled to his feet only to find that the oar with which he had been\nsteering was snapped in half.\n\n\"The rudder's smashed,\" he said.\n\n\"Take another, Howick; quick!\" cried the captain.\n\nBut scarcely had he time to replace the broken oar, when a bubbling was\nheard a few yards away from the boat, and the young whale made its\nappearance on the surface of the sea. Catching sight of it instantly,\nthe mother made a fresh dash in its direction, the maternal instincts\nwere aroused, and the contest must become more deadly than ever.\n\nCaptain Hull looked towards the \"Pilgrim,\" and waved his signal\nfrantically above his head. It was, however, with no hope of succour;\nhe was only too well aware that no human efforts could effectually\nhasten the arrival of the ship. Dick Sands indeed had at once obeyed\nthe first summons: already the wind was filling the sails, but in\ndefault of steam power her progress at best could not be otherwise than\nslow. Not only did Dick feel convinced that it would be a useless waste\nof time to lower a boat and come off with the negroes to the rescue,\nbut he remembered the strict orders he had received on no account to\nquit the ship. Captain Hull, however, could perceive that the\napprentice had had the aft-boat lowered, and was towing it along, so\nthat it should be in readiness for a refuge as soon as they should get\nwithin reach.\n\n[Illustration: The boat was well nigh full of water, and in imminent\ndanger of being capsized]\n\nBut the whale, close at hand, demanded attention that could ill be\nspared for the yet distant ship. Covering her young one with her body,\nshe was manifestly designing another charge full upon the boat.\n\n\"On your guard, Howick! sheer off!\" bellowed the captain.\n\nBut the order was useless. The fresh oar that the boatswain had taken\nto replace the broken one was considerably shorter, and consequently it\nfailed in lever-power. There was, in fact, no helm for the boat to\nanswer. The sailors saw the failure, and convinced that all was lost\nuttered one long, despairing cry that might have been heard on board\nthe \"Pilgrim.\" Another moment, and from beneath there came a tremendous\nblow from the monster's tail that sent the boat flying in the air. In\nfragments it fell back again into a sea that was lashed into fury by\nthe angry flapping of the finback's fins.\n\nWas it not possible for the unfortunate men, bleeding and wounded as\nthey were, still to save themselves by clinging to some floating spar?\nCaptain Hull is indeed seen endeavouring to hoist the boatswain on to a\ndrifting plank. But all in vain. There is no hope. The whale, writhing\nin the convulsions of death, returns yet once again to the attack; the\nwaters around the struggling sailors seethe and foam. A brief turmoil\nfollows as if there were the bursting of some vast waterspout.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour afterwards, Dick Sands, with the negroes,\nreaches the scene of the catastrophe. All is still and desolate. Every\nliving object has vanished. Nothing is visible except a few fragments\nof the whale-boat floating on the blood-stained water.\n\n[Illustration: There is no hope.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nDICK'S PROMOTION.\n\n\nThe first feeling experienced by those on board the \"Pilgrim,\" after\nwitnessing the terrible disaster was one of grief and horror at the\nfearful death that had befallen the victims. Captain Hull and his men\nhad been swept away before their very eyes, and they had been powerless\nto assist. Not one was saved; the schooner had reached the spot too\nlate to offer the least resistance to the attacks of the formidable\nsea-monster.\n\nWhen Dick and the negroes returned to the ship after their hopeless\nsearch, with only the corroboration of their sad foreboding that\ncaptain and crew had disappeared for ever, Mrs. Weldon sank upon her\nknees; little Jack knelt beside her crying bitterly; and Dick, old Nan,\nand all the negroes stood reverently around her whilst with great\ndevoutness the lady offered up the prayer of commendation for the souls\nof the departing. All sympathized heartily with her supplications, nor\nwas there any diminution of their fervour when she proceeded to implore\nthat the survivors might have strength and courage for their own hour\nof need.\n\nThe situation was indeed very grave. Here was the \"Pilgrim\" in the\nmiddle of the Pacific, hundreds of miles away from the nearest land,\nwithout captain, without crew, at the mercy of the wind and waves. It\nwas a strange fatality that had brought the whale across their path; it\nwas a fatality stranger still that had induced her captain, a man of no\nordinary prudence, to risk even his life for the sake of making good a\ndeficient cargo. It was an event almost unknown in the annals of\nwhale-fishing that not a single man in the whale-boat should escape\nalive; nevertheless, it was all too true; and now, of all those left on\nboard, Dick Sands, the apprentice-boy of fifteen years of age, was the\nsole individual who had the slightest knowledge of the management of a\nship; the negroes, brave and willing as they were, were perfectly\nignorant of seamen's duties; and, to crown all, here was a lady with\nher child on board, for whose safety the commander of the vessel would\nbe held responsible.\n\nSuch were the facts which presented themselves to the mind of Dick as,\nwith folded arms, he stood gazing gloomily at the spot where Captain\nHull, his esteemed benefactor, had sunk to rise no more. The lad raised\nhis eyes sadly; he scanned the horizon with the vain hope that he might\nperchance descry some passing vessel to which he could confide Mrs.\nWeldon and her son; for himself, his mind was made up; he had already\nresolved that nothing should induce him to quit the \"Pilgrim\" until he\nhad exhausted every energy in trying to carry her into port.\n\nThe ocean was all deserted. Since the disappearance of the whale\nnothing had broken the monotonous surface either of sea or sky. The\napprentice, short as his experience was, knew enough to be aware that\nhe was far out of the common track alike of merchantmen or whalers; he\nwould not buoy himself up with false expectations; he would look his\nsituation full and fairly in the face; he would do his best, and trust\nhopefully in guidance from the Power above.\n\nThus absorbed in his meditations he did not observe that he was not\nalone. Negoro, who had gone below immediately after the catastrophe,\nhad again come back upon deck. What this mysterious character had felt\nupon witnessing the awful calamity it would be impossible to say.\nAlthough with his eye he had keenly taken in every detail of the\nmelancholy spectacle, every muscle of, his face had remained unmoved;\nnot a gesture, not a word betrayed the least emotion. Even if he had\nheard, he had taken no part, nor evinced the faintest interest in Mrs.\nWeldon's outpouring of prayer.\n\nHe had made his way to the stern, where Dick Sands was pondering over\nthe responsibilities of his own position, and stood looking towards the\napprentice without interrupting his reverie.\n\nCatching sight of him, Dick roused himself in an instant, and said,--\n\n\"You want to speak to me?\"\n\n\"I must speak either to the captain or the boatswain,\" answered the man.\n\n\"Negoro,\" said Dick sharply, \"you know as well as I do, that they are\nboth drowned.\"\n\n\"Then where am I to get my orders from?\" asked the fellow insolently.\n\n\"From me,\" promptly rejoined the apprentice.\n\n\"From you! from a boy of fifteen?\"\n\n\"Yes, from me,\" repeated Dick, in a firm and resolute voice, looking at\nthe man until he recoiled under his gaze. \"From _me_.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon had heard what passed.\n\n\"I wish every one on board to understand,\" she interposed, \"that Dick\nSands is captain now. Orders must be taken from him, and they must be\nobeyed.\"\n\nNegoro frowned, bit his lip, sneered, and having muttered something\nthat was unintelligible, made his way back to his cabin.\n\nMeantime, the schooner under the freshening breeze had been carried\nbeyond the shoal of the crustaceans. Dick cast his eye first at the\nsails, then along the deck, and seemed to become more and more alive to\nthe weight of the obligation that had fallen upon him; but his heart\ndid not fail him; he was conscious that the hopes of the passengers\ncentred in himself, and he was determined to let them see that he would\ndo his best not to disappoint them.\n\nAlthough he was satisfied of his capability, with the help of the\nnegroes, to manipulate the sails, he was conscious of a defect of the\nscientific knowledge which was requisite for properly controlling the\nship's course. He felt the want of a few more years' experience. If\nonly he had had longer practice he would, he thought, have been as able\nas Captain Hull himself, to use the sextant, to take the altitude of\nthe stars, to read the time from his chronometer; sun, moon, and\nplanets, should have been his guides; from the firmament, as from a\ndial-plate, he would have gathered the teachings of his true position;\nbut all this was beyond him as yet; his knowledge went no further than\nthe use of the log and compass, and by these alone he must be content\nto make his reckonings. But he kept up his courage, and did not permit\nhimself for one moment to despair of ultimate success.\n\nMrs. Weldon needed little penetration to recognize the thoughts which\nwere passing in the mind of the resolute youth.\n\n\"I see you have come to your decision, Dick,\" she said. \"The command of\nthe ship is in your hands; no fear but that you will do your duty; and\nTom, and the rest of them, no doubt, will render you every assistance\nin their power.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Weldon,\" rejoined Dick brightly; \"and before long I shall\nhope to make them good seamen. If only the weather lasts fair,\neverything will go on well enough; and if the weather turns out bad, we\nmust not despond; we will get safe ashore.\"\n\nHe paused a moment and added reverently,--\n\n\"God helping us.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon proceeded to inquire whether he had any means of\nascertaining the \"Pilgrim's\" present position. He replied that the\nship's chart would at once settle that. Captain Hull had kept the\nreckoning accurately right up to the preceding day.\n\n\"And what do you propose to do next?\" she asked. \"Of course you\nunderstand that in our present circumstances we are not in the least\nbound to go to Valparaiso if there is a nearer port which we could\nreach.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Dick; \"and therefore it is my intention to\nsail due east, as by following that course we are sure to come upon\nsome part of the American coast.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Oh, we shall soon be on shore!\"]\n\n\"Do your best, Dick, to let us get ashore somewhere.\"\n\n\"Never fear, madam,\" he answered; \"as we get nearer land we shall be\nalmost sure to fall in with a cruiser which will put us into the right\ntrack. If the wind does but remain in the north-west, and allow us to\ncarry plenty of sail, we shall get on famously.\"\n\nHe spoke with the cheery confidence of a good sailor who knows the good\nship beneath his feet. He had moved off a few steps to go and take the\nhelm, when Mrs. Weldon, calling him back, reminded him that he had not\nyet ascertained the true position of the schooner. Dick confessed that\nit ought to be done at once, and going to the captain's cabin brought\nout the chart upon which the ill-fated commander had marked the\nbearings the evening before. According to this dead-reckoning they were\nin lat. 43\u00c2\u00b0 35', S., and long. 164\u00c2\u00b0 13', W.; and as the schooner had\nmade next to no progress during the last twenty-four eventful hours,\nthe entry might fairly be accepted as representing approximately their\npresent position.\n\nTo the lady's inexperienced eye, as she bent over the outspread chart,\nit seemed that the land, as represented by the brown patch which\ndepicted the continent of South America extending like a barrier\nbetween two oceans from Cape Horn to Columbia, was, after all, not so\nvery far distant; the wide space of the Pacific was not so broad but\nthat it would be quickly traversed.\n\n\"Oh, we shall soon be on shore!\" she said.\n\nBut Dick knew better. He had acquaintance enough with the scale upon\nwhich the chart was constructed to be aware that the \"Pilgrim\" herself\nwould have been a speck like a microscopic infusoria on the vast\nsurface of that sea, and that hundreds and hundreds of weary miles\nseparated her from the coast.\n\nNo time was to be lost. Contrary winds had ceased to blow; a fresh\nnorth-westerly breeze had sprung up, and the _cirri_, or curl-cloud:\noverhead indicated that for some time at least the direction of the\nwind would be unchanged.\n\nDick appealed to the negroes, and tried to make them appreciate the\ndifficulty of the task that had fallen to his lot. Tom answered, in\nbehalf of himself and all the rest, that they were not only willing,\nbut anxious, to do all they could to assist him, saying that if their\nknowledge was small, yet their arms were strong, and added that they\nshould certainly be obedient to every order he gave.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Dick, addressing them in reply; \"I shall make it a\npoint of myself taking the helm as much as possible. But you know I\nmust have my proper rest sometimes. No one can live without sleep. Now,\nTom, I intend you to stand by me for the remainder of the day. I will\ntry and make you understand how to steer by the aid of the compass. It\nis not difficult. You will soon learn. I shall have to leave you when I\ngo to my hammock for an hour or two.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing,\" said little Jack, \"that I can learn to do?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Jack; you shall keep the wind in order,\" answered Dick,\nsmiling.\n\n\"That I will!\" cried the child, clapping his hands, while the mother\ndrew him to her side.\n\n\"And now, my men,\" was Dick's first order to his crew, \"we must brace\nin the yards to sail fair. I will show you how.\"\n\n\"All right, Captain Sands; we are at your service,\" said old Tom\ngravely.\n\n[Illustration: \"Oh yes, Jack; you shall keep the wind in order.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE NEW CREW.\n\n\nDick Sands, captain of the \"Pilgrim,\" would not lose a moment in\ngetting his ship under sail. His prime object was to land his\npassengers safely at Valparaiso or some other American port, and to\naccomplish his purpose it was in the first place necessary that he\nshould ascertain the schooner's rate of speed and the direction that\nshe was taking. This information was to be obtained readily enough by\nmeans of the log and compass, and the result of each day's observations\nwould be entered regularly on the chart.\n\nThe log on board was a patent log, with a dial-plate and screw, by\nmeans of which the distance that is travelled can be measured\naccurately for any definite time; it was an instrument so simple that\nthe negroes were very soon taught its use. The slight error in the\nreckoning caused by the action of the currents could only be rectified\nby astronomical observations, which, as already has been stated, were\nbeyond Dick's attainments to make.\n\nThe idea more than once crossed Dick's mind whether he would not take\nthe \"Pilgrim\" back again to New Zealand; the distance was considerably\nless than it was to America, and had the wind remained in the quarter\nwhence it had been blowing so long, it is more than likely he would\nhave determined to retrace his course. But as the wind had now veered\nto the north-west, and there was every probability that it was settled\nfor a time, he came to the conclusion that he had better take advantage\nof it and persevere in making his way towards the east. Accordingly he\nlost no time in putting his ship before the wind.\n\nOn a schooner the fore-mast usually carries four square sails; on the\nlower mast a fore-sail; on the top-mast a top-sail; on the top-gallant\na top-gallant-sail and a royal. The main-mast carries only a main-sail\nand a top-sail. Between the masts upon the fore-stays can be hoisted a\ntriple tier of triangular sails; while the bowsprit with its jib-boom\nwill carry the three jibs.\n\nThe jibs, the main-sail, the main-top-sail and the staysails are all\nmanaged with comparative ease, because they can be hoisted from the\ndeck without the necessity of ascending the mast to let fly the\nrobbins, by which they are fastened to the yards. With the sails on the\nfore-mast it is altogether a more difficult business. In order either\nto unfurl them, to take them in, or to reef them, it is necessary for a\nman to clamber up by the shrouds, either to the fore-top, or to the\ntop-gallant cross-trees, and thence mounting by loose ropes, extended\nbelow the yards, to hold on by one hand whilst he does his work with\nthe other. The operation requires alike the head and arm of an\nexperienced mariner; and when a fresh breeze has been blowing, it is a\ncasualty far from uncommon that a sailor, confused by the flapping of\nthe canvas and the pitching of the vessel, should be blown overboard in\nthe act. For the unpractised negroes the danger would necessarily be\nvery great. However, the wind at present was very moderate, and the\nship ploughed her way over the waves without any violent oscillations.\n\nAt the time when Dick Sands, in obedience to the signal he received\nfrom Captain Hull, proceeded to make his way to the scene of the\ndisaster, the \"Pilgrim,\" as she lay to, was carrying only her jibs,\nmain-sail, fore-sail, and fore-top-sail. In order, therefore, to put\nher as near as possible to the wind, it had been merely necessary to\ncounter-brace the fore-sail yard, a manoeuvre in which the negroes had\nrendered all the assistance that was necessary. It was requisite now to\ndo something more. To enable him to get straight before the wind Dick\nwanted to increase his sail, and was desirous of hoisting the\ntop-gallant, the royal, the main-top-sail, and the stay-sails.\n\nHe was himself standing at the wheel.\n\n\"Now, my men,\" he shouted to the negroes; \"I want your help. Do exactly\nas I tell you. Bear away, Tom!\"\n\nTom looked puzzled.\n\n\"Bear away! unfasten that rope, I mean. And, Bat, come along; do the\nsame as Tom.\"\n\nThe men did what they were bidden.\n\n\"That's right!\" continued Dick, and calling to Hercules, said,--\n\n\"Now, Hercules; a good strong pull!\"\n\nTo give such a direction to Hercules was somewhat imprudent; the\nrigging creaked again under his giant strength.\n\n\"Gently, gently, my good fellow!\" said Dick, laughing; \"you will have\nthe mast down.\"\n\n\"I declare I hardly touched the rope,\" answered Hercules.\n\n\"Well, next time, you must only pretend to touch it,\" said Dick; and,\ncontinuing his orders, shouted, \"Now slacken! let fly! make fast! now\nbrace in the yards! all right! that's capital!\"\n\nThe yards were loosened, the foresails turned slowly round, and,\ncatching the breeze, gave a slight impetus to the ship. Dick's next\norders were for the jib-sheets to be set free, and then he called the\nmen to the stern.\n\n\"Now,\" said he; \"we must look to the main-mast; but take care,\nHercules, not to have it down.\"\n\n\"I will be as careful as possible, Mr. Dick,\" submissively replied\nHercules, as though he were afraid to commit himself to any rash\npromise.\n\nThe manoeuvre was simple enough. The main-sheet was gradually\nslackened, the great sail took the wind and added its powerful action\nto that of the fore-sails. The main-top-sail was next brought to bear;\nit was only clewed up, so that there was nothing to do except to pull\nthe halyards, haul it aboard the tack, and unfurl it. But in pulling at\nthe halyards the muscular energy of Hercules, which was supplemented by\nthat of Act\u00c3\u00a6on, not to forget little Jack, who had volunteered his\nassistance, proved to be overpowering, and the rope snapped in two. All\nthree of them, of course, fell flat upon the deck; but fortunately\nneither of them was hurt, and Jack laughed heartily at his tumble as an\nexcellent joke.\n\n\"Up with you!\" cried Captain Dick; \"there's no harm done; splice the\nrope, and haul away more gently next time.\"\n\nIt took but a few minutes to execute the order, and the \"Pilgrim\" was\nsoon sailing away rapidly with her head to the east.\n\n\"Well done, my friends!\" said Dick, who had not left his post at the\nhelm; \"you will be first-rate sailors before the end of the voyage.\"\n\n\"We shall do our best, I promise you, Captain Sands,\" replied Tom,\nmaking it a point to give the young commander his proper title.\n\nMrs. Weldon also congratulated the new crew upon the success of their\nfirst attempt.\n\n\"I believe it was Master Jack who broke that rope,\" said Hercules, with\na sly twinkle in his eye; \"he is very strong, I can tell you.\"\n\nJack looked as though he thoroughly appreciated the compliment, and\nevidenced his satisfaction by giving his huge friend a hearty shake of\nthe hand.\n\nThere were still several sails that were not yet set. Running well\nbefore the wind as the \"Pilgrim\" was, Dick nevertheless felt that the\ngallant, royal, and stay-sails, if brought into service, would\nmaterially assist her progress, and he determined not to dispense with\ntheir help. The stay-sails could be hoisted from below, but to bring\nthe gallant and royal into play demanded more experience than any of\nhis crew had had. Knowing that he could not entrust the task to them,\nand yet resolved not to be baulked of his wish to set them, he\nundertook the task himself. He first put Tom to the helm, showing him\nhow to keep the schooner's head in the right direction, and having\nplaced the other four at the royal and top-gallant halyards, proceeded\nto mount the foremast.\n\n[Illustration: All three of them fell flat upon the deck.]\n\nTo clamber up the foreshrouds and the top-shrouds on to the cross-trees\nwas mere child's play to the active apprentice. In a few minutes he had\nunfurled the top-gallant-sail, mounted to the royal-yard, unfurled the\nroyal, again reached the cross-trees, and having caught hold of one of\nthe starboard backstays, had descended to the deck; there he gave the\nnecessary directions, and the two sails were made fast, and both yards\nbraced.\n\nNor did this content him. The stay-sails were set between the masts,\nand thus the \"Pilgrim\" was running along, crowded to the full, with all\nher canvas. The only additional sails which Dick could possibly have\nemployed would have been some studding-sails to larboard, but as the\nsetting of these was a matter of some difficulty, and they were not\nalways readily struck in the case of a sudden squall, he contented\nhimself without them.\n\nAgain he took his place at the helm. The breeze was manifestly\nfreshening, and the \"Pilgrim,\" almost imperceptibly heeling to\nstarboard, glided rapidly along the surface of the water, leaving\nbehind her a wake, smooth and clean, that bore plain witness to the\ntrue adjustment of her water-line.\n\n\"This is good progress, Mrs. Weldon,\" he said; \"may Heaven grant the\nwind and weather may continue thus favourable!\"\n\nThe lady, in silence, shook the boy's hand; and then, worn-out with the\nexcitement of the past hours, went to her cabin, where she lay down and\nfell into a troubled doze.\n\nThe new crew remained on watch. They were stationed on the forecastle,\nin readiness to make any alteration which the sails might require, but\nthe wind was so steady and unshifting that no need arose for their\nservices.\n\nAnd Cousin Benedict? all this time, where was he? and what had he been\ndoing?\n\nHe was sitting in his cabin; he had a magnifying-glass in his hand and\nwas studying an articulata of the order orthoptera, an insect of the\nBlattidae family; its characteristics are a roundish body, rather long\nwings, flat elytra, and a head hidden by the prothorax. He had been on\ndeck at the time of the calamity; the ill-fated captain with the crew\nhad been drowned before his very eyes; but he said nothing; not that he\nwas unmoved; to think that he was not struck with horror would be to\nlibel his kind and pitying nature. His sympathy was aroused, especially\nfor his cousin; he pressed her hand warmly as if he would assure her of\nhis truest commiseration; but he said nothing; he hurried off towards\nhis cabin; and who shall deny that it was to devise some wonderfully\nenergetic measures that he would take in consequence of this melancholy\nevent?\n\nPassing the kitchen, however, he caught sight of Negoro in the act of\ncrushing a blatta, an American species of cockroach. He broke out into\na storm of invective, and in tones of indignation demanded the\nsurrender of the insect, which Negoro made with cool contempt. In a\nmoment Captain Hull and his partners in death were all forgotten; the\nenthusiast had secured a prize with which he hastened to his own little\ncompartment, where he was soon absorbed in proving to his own\nsatisfaction, in opposition to the opinion of other entomologists, that\nthe blattae of the phoraspous species, which are remarkable for their\ncolours, differ in their habits from blattae of the ordinary sort.\n\nFor the remainder of the day perfect order reigned on board the\n\"Pilgrim.\" Though they were unable to shake off the sickening feeling\nof horror roused by the frightful disaster, and felt that they had\nsustained a startling shock, all the passengers seemed mechanically to\nfall into their usual routine. Dick Sands, though avowedly at the\nwheel, seemed to be everywhere, with an eye for every thing, and his\namateur crew obeyed him readily, and with the promptness of a willing\nactivity.\n\nNegoro made no further overt attempt to question the young captain's\nauthority, but remained shut up in his kitchen. Dick made no secret of\nhis determination to place the cook in close confinement if he\nexhibited any future sign of insubordination. Hercules was ready to\ncarry him off bodily to the hold, and old Nan was equally ready to take\nhis place in the cooking department. Probably Negoro was aware of all\nthis; at any rate he did not seem disposed to give any further cause of\noffence at present.\n\n[Illustration: Jack evidenced his satisfaction by giving his huge\nfriend a hearty shake of the hand.]\n\nAs the day advanced the wind continued to freshen; but no shifting of\nthe sails seemed necessary. The \"Pilgrim\" was running well. There was\nno need to diminish her spread of canvas. Masts as solid and rigging as\nstrong as hers could stand a far heavier breeze.\n\nAs a general rule, it is deemed prudent in case of a squall to shorten\nsail at night, and especially to take in gallants and royal; but the\nweather prospects now were all so promising and satisfactory that Dick\npersuaded himself he was under no necessity to take this precaution; he\nrather felt himself bound to take the strongest measures he could to\nexpedite his reaching less unfrequented waters. He made up his mind,\nhowever, not to leave the deck at all that night.\n\nThe young captain made every effort to get an approximate reckoning of\nthe schooner's progress. He heaved the log every half-hour and duly\nregistered the result of each successive examination. There were two\ncompasses on board; one in the binnacle, close under the eye of the\nhelmsman, the other, an inverted compass, being attached to the rafters\nof the captain's cabin, so that without leaving his berth he could see\nwhether the man in charge of the wheel was holding a proper course.\n\nEvery vessel that is duly furnished for a lengthened voyage has always\nnot only two compasses but two chronometers, one to correct the other.\nThe \"Pilgrim\" was not deficient in this respect, and Dick Sands made a\nstrong point of admonishing his crew that they should take especial\ncare of the compasses, which under their present circumstances were of\nsuch supreme importance.\n\nA misfortune, however, was in store for them. On the night of the 12th,\nwhile Dick was on watch, the compass in the cabin became detached from\nits fastening and fell on the floor. The accident was not discovered\nuntil the following morning. Whether the metal ferule that had attached\nthe instrument to the rafters had become rusty, or whether it had been\nworn away by additional friction it seemed impossible to settle. All\nthat could be said was that the compass was broken beyond repair. Dick\nwas extremely grieved at the loss; but he did not consider that any one\nwas to be blamed for the mishap, and could only resolve for the future\nto take extra care of the compass in the binnacle.\n\nWith the exception of this _contretemps_, everything appeared to go on\nsatisfactorily on board. Mrs. Weldon, reassured by Dick's confidence,\nhad regained much of her wonted calmness, and was besides ever\nsupported by a sincere religious spirit. She and Dick had many a long\nconversation together. The ingenuous lad was always ready to take the\nkind and intelligent lady into his counsel, and day by day would point\nout to her on the chart the registers he made as the result of his dead\nreckoning; he would then try and satisfy her that under the prevailing\nwind there could be no doubt they must arrive at the coast of South\nAmerica: moreover, he said that, unless he was much mistaken, they\nshould sight the land at no great distance from Valparaiso.\n\nMrs. Weldon had, in truth, no reason to question the correctness of\nDick's representations; she owned that provided the wind remained in\nthe same favourable quarter, there was every prospect of their reaching\nland in safety; nevertheless at times she could not resist the\nmisgiving that would arise when she contemplated what might be the\nresult of a change of wind or a breaking of the weather.\n\nWith the light-heartedness that belonged to his age, Jack soon fell\nback into his accustomed pursuits, and was to be seen merrily running\nover the deck or romping with Dingo. At times, it is true, he missed\nthe companionship of Dick; but his mother made him comprehend that now\nthat Dick, was captain, his time was too much occupied to allow him;\nany leisure for play, and the child quite understood that he must not\ninterrupt his old friend in his new duties.\n\n[Illustration: A light shadow glided stealthily along the deck.]\n\nThe negroes performed their work with intelligence, and seemed to make\nrapid progress in the art of seamanship. Tom had been unanimously\nappointed boatswain, and took one watch with Bat and Austin, the\nalternate watch being discharged by Dick himself with Hercules and\nAct\u00c3\u00a6on. One of them steered so that the other two were free to watch at\nthe bows. As a general rule Dick Sands managed to remain at the wheel\nall night; five or six hours' sleep in the daytime sufficed for him,\nand during the time when he was lying down he entrusted the wheel to\nTom or Bat, who under his instructions had become very fair helmsmen.\nAlthough in these unfrequented waters there was little chance of\nrunning foul of any other vessel, Dick invariably took the precaution\nof lighting his signals, carrying a green light to starboard and a red\nlight to port. His exertions, however, were a great strain upon him,\nand sometimes during the night his fatigue would induce a heavy\ndrowsiness, and he steered, as it were, by instinct more than by\nattention.\n\nOn the night of the 13th, he was so utterly worn-out that he was\nobliged to ask Tom to relieve him at the helm whilst he went down for a\nfew hours' rest. Act\u00c3\u00a6on and Hercules remained on watch on the\nforecastle.\n\nThe night was very dark; the sky was covered with heavy clouds that had\nformed in the chill evening air, and the sails on the top-masts were\nlost in the obscurity. At the stern, the lamps on either side of the\nbinnacle cast a faint reflection on the metal mountings of the wheel,\nleaving the deck generally in complete darkness.\n\nTowards three o'clock in the morning Tom was getting so heavy with\nsleepiness that he was almost unconscious. His eye, long fixed steadily\non the compass, lost its power of vision, and he fell into a doze from\nwhich it would require more than a slight disturbance to arouse him.\n\nMeantime a light shadow glided stealthily along the deck. Creeping\ngradually up to the binnacle, Negoro put down something heavy that he\nhad brought in his hand. He stole a keen and rapid glance at the dial\nof the compass, and made his way back, unseen and unheard as he had\ncome.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, Tom awakened from his slumber. His eye\nfell instinctively on the compass, and he saw in a moment that the ship\nwas out of her proper course. By a turn of the helm he brought her head\nto what he supposed to be the east. But he was mistaken. During his\nbrief interval of unconsciousness a piece of iron had been deposited\nbeneath the magnetic needle, which by this means had been diverted\nthirty degrees to the right, and, instead of pointing due north,\ninclined far towards north-east.\n\nConsequently it came to pass that the \"Pilgrim,\" supposed by her young\ncommander to be making good headway due east, was in reality, under the\nbrisk north-west breeze, speeding along towards the south-east.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nROUGH WEATHER.\n\n\nDuring the ensuing week nothing particular occurred on board. The\nbreeze still freshened, and the \"Pilgrim\" made on the average 160 miles\nevery twenty-four hours. The speed was as great as could be expected\nfrom a craft of her size.\n\nDick grew more and more sanguine in his anticipations that it could not\nbe long before the schooner would cross the track of the mail-packets\nplying between the eastern and western hemispheres. He had made up his\nmind to hail the first passing vessel, and either to transfer his\npassengers, or what perhaps would be better still, to borrow a few\nsailors, and, it might be, an officer to work the \"Pilgrim\" to shore.\nHe could not help, however, a growing sense of astonishment, when day\nafter day passed, and yet there was no ship to be signalled. He kept\nthe most vigourous look-out, but all to no purpose. Three voyages\nbefore had he made to the whale-fisheries, and his experience made him\nsure that he ought now to be sighting some English or American vessel\non its way between the Equator and Cape Horn.\n\nVery different, however, was the true position of the \"Pilgrim\" from\nwhat Dick supposed; not only had the ship been carried far out of her\ndirect course by currents, the force of which there were no means of\nestimating, but from the moment when the compass had been tampered with\nby Negoro, the steering itself had put the vessel all astray.\n\nUnconscious of both these elements of disturbance, Dick Sands was\nconvinced that they were proceeding steadily eastwards, and was\nperpetually encouraging Mrs. Weldon and himself by the assurance that\nthey must very soon arrive within view of the American coast; again and\nagain asserting that his sole concern was for his passengers, and that\nfor his own safety he had no anxiety.\n\n\"But think, Dick,\" said the lady, \"what a position you would have been\nin, if you had not had your passengers. You would have been alone with\nthat terrible Negoro; you would have been rather alarmed then.\"\n\n\"I should have taken good care to put it out of Negoro's power to do me\nany mischief, and then I should have worked the ship by myself,\"\nanswered the lad stoutly.\n\nHis very pluck gave Mrs. Weldon renewed confidence. She was a woman\nwith wonderful powers of endurance, and it was only when she thought of\nher little son that she had any feeling of despair; yet even this she\nendeavoured to conceal, and Dick's undaunted courage helped her.\n\nAlthough the youth of the apprentice did not allow him to pretend to\nany advanced scientific knowledge, he had the proverbial \"weather-eye\"\nof the sailor. He was not only very keen in noticing any change in the\naspect of the sky, but he had learnt from Captain Hull, who was a\nclever meteorologist, to draw correct conclusions from the indications\nof the barometer; the captain, indeed, having taken the trouble to make\nhim learn by heart the general rules which are laid down in\nVorepierre's _Dictionnaire Illustr\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\nThere are seven of these rules:--\n\n1. If after a long period of fine weather the barometer falls suddenly\nand continuously, although the mercury may be descending for two or\nthree days before there is an apparent change in the atmosphere, there\nwill ultimately be rain; and the longer has been the time between the\nfirst depression and the commencement of the rain, the longer the rain\nmay be expected to last.\n\n2. _Vice vers\u00c3\u00a2_, if after a long period of wet weather the barometer\nbegins to rise slowly and steadily, fine weather will ensue; and the\nlonger the time between the first rising of the mercury and the\ncommencement of the fine weather, the longer the fine weather may be\nexpected to last.\n\n3. If immediately after the fall or rise of the mercury a change of\nweather ensues, the change will be of no long continuance.[1]\n\n4. A gradual rise for two or three days during rain forecasts fine\nweather; but if there be a fall immediately on the arrival of the fine\nweather, it will not be for long. This rule holds also conversely.\n\n5. In spring and autumn a sudden fall indicates rain; in the summer, if\nvery hot, it foretells a storm. In the winter, after a period of steady\nfrost, a fall prognosticates a change of wind with rain and hail;\nwhilst a rise announces the approach of snow.\n\n6. Rapid oscillations of the mercury either way are not to be\ninterpreted as indicating either wet or dry weather of any duration;\ncontinuance of either fair or foul weather is forecast only by a\nprolonged and steady rise or fall beforehand.\n\n7. At the end of autumn, after a period of wind and rain, a rise may be\nexpected to be followed by north wind and frost.\n\nNot merely had Dick got these rules by rote, but he had tested them by\nhis own observations, and had become singularly trustworthy in his\nforecasts of the weather. He made a point of consulting the barometer\nseveral times every day, and although to all appearances the sky\nindicated that the fine weather was settled, it did not escape his\nobservation that on the 20th the mercury showed a tendency to fall.\nDick knew that rain, if it came, would be accompanied by wind; an\nopinion in which he was very soon confirmed by the breeze freshening,\ntill the air was displaced at the rate of nearly sixty feet a second,\nor more[1] than forty miles an hour; and he recognized the necessity of\nat once shortening sail. He had already used the precaution to take in\nthe royal, the main-top-sail, and the flying jib, but he now at once\nresolved likewise to take in the top-gallant, and to have a couple of\nreefs in the foretop-sail.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This and several of the other rules are concisely\nconcentrated in the couplet--\n\n  Long foretold, long last;\n  Short notice, soon past.]\n\n\nTo an inexperienced crew, the last operation was far from easy; but\nthere was no symptom of shrinking from it. Followed by Bat and Austin,\nDick mounted the rigging of the foremast, and with little trouble got\nto the top-gallant. Had the weather been less unpromising he would have\nbeen inclined to leave the two yards as they were, but anticipating the\nultimate necessity of being obliged to lower the mast, he unrigged\nthem, and let them down to the deck; he knew well enough that in the\nevent of the gale rising as he expected, the lowering of the mast as\nwell as the shortening of sail would contribute to diminish the strain\nand stress upon the vessel.\n\nIt was the work of two hours to get this preliminary operation over.\nThere still remained the task of taking in the reefs in the top-sail.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" in one respect differed from most modern vessels. She did\nnot carry a double foretop, which would very much have diminished the\ndifficulty attending the reefing. It was consequently necessary to\nproceed as before; to mount the rigging, by main force to haul in the\nflapping canvas, and to make the fastening secure. But critical and\ndangerous as the task was, it was successfully accomplished, and the\nthree young men, having descended safely to the deck, had the\nsatisfaction of seeing the schooner run easily before the wind, which\nhad further increased till it was blowing a stiff gale.\n\nFor three days the gale continued brisk and hard, yet without any\nvariation in its direction. But all along the barometer was falling;\nthe mercury sank to 28\u00c2\u00b0 without symptom of recovery. The sky was\nbecoming overcast; clouds, thick and lowering, obscured the sun, and it\nwas difficult to make out where it rose or where it set. Dick did his\nbest to keep up his courage, but he could not disguise from himself\nthat there was cause for uneasiness. He took no more rest than was\nabsolutely necessary, and what repose he allowed himself he always took\non deck; he maintained a calm exterior, but he was really tortured with\nanxiety.\n\n[Illustration: For half an hour Negoro stood motionless.]\n\nAlthough the violence of the wind seemed to lull awhile, Dick did not\nsuffer himself to be betrayed into any false security; he knew only too\nwell what to expect, and after a brief interval of comparative quiet,\nthe gale returned and the waves began to run very high.\n\nAbout four o'clock one afternoon, Negoro (a most unusual thing for him)\nemerged from his kitchen, and skulked to the fore. Dingo was fast\nasleep, and did not make his ordinary growl by way of greeting to his\nenemy. For half an hour Negoro stood motionless, apparently surveying\nthe horizon. The heavy waves rolled past; they were higher than the\ncondition of the wind warranted; their magnitude witnessed to a storm\npassing in the west, and there was every reason to suspect that the\n\"Pilgrim\" might be caught by its violence.\n\nNegoro looked long at the water; he then raised his eyes and scanned\nthe sky. Above and below he might have read threatening signs. The\nupper stratum of cloud was travelling far more rapidly than that\nbeneath, an indication that ere long the masses of vapour would\ndescend, and, coming in contact with the inferior current, would change\nthe gale into a tempest, which probably would increase to a hurricane.\n\nIt might be from ignorance or it might be from indifference, but there\nwas no indication of alarm on the face of Negoro; on the other hand\nthere might be seen a sort of smile curling on his lip. After thus\ngazing above him and around him, he clambered on to the bowsprit, and\nmade his way by degrees to the very gammonings; again he rested and\nlooked about him as if to explore the horizon; after a while he\nclambered back on deck, and soon stealthily retreated to his own\nquarters.\n\nNo doubt there was much to cause concern in the general aspect of the\nweather; but there was one point on which they never failed to\ncongratulate each other;--that the direction of the wind had never\nchanged, and consequently must be carrying them in the desired course.\nUnless a storm should overtake them, they could continue their present\nnavigation without peril, and with every prospect of finding a port\nupon the shore where they might put in. Such were their mutual and\nacknowledged hopes; but Dick secretly felt the misgiving lest, without\na pilot, he might in his ignorance fail to find a harbour of refuge.\nNevertheless, he would not suffer himself to meet trouble half-way, and\nkept up his spirits under the conviction that if difficulties came he\nshould be strengthened to grapple with them or make his escape.\n\nTime passed on, and the 9th of March arrived without material change in\nthe condition of the atmosphere. The sky remained heavily burdened, and\nthe wind, which occasionally had abated for a few hours, had always\nreturned with at least its former violence. The occasional rising of\nthe mercury never encouraged Dick to anticipate a permanent improvement\nin the weather, and he discerned only too plainly that brighter times\nat present were not to be looked for.\n\nA startling alarm had more than once been caused by the sudden breaking\nof storms in which thunderbolts had seemed to fall within a few cables'\nlengths of the schooner. On these occasions the torrents of rain had\nbeen so heavy that the ship had appeared to be in the very midst of a\nwhirlpool of vapour, and it was impossible to see a yard ahead.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" pitched and rolled frightfully. Fortunately Mrs. Weldon\ncould bear the motion without much personal inconvenience, and\nconsequently was able to devote her attention to her little boy, who\nwas a miserable sufferer. Cousin Benedict was as undisturbed as the\ncockroaches he was investigating; he hardly noticed the increasing\nmadness of either wind or wave, but went on with his studies as calmly\nas if he were in his own comfortable museum at San Francisco. Moreover,\nit was fortunate that the negroes did not suffer to any great degree\nfrom sea-sickness, and consequently were able to assist their captain\nin his arduous task, Dick was far too experienced a sailor himself to\nbe inconvenienced by any oscillations of the vessel, however violent.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" still made good headway, and Dick, although he was aware\nthat ultimately it would probably be necessary again to shorten sail,\nwas anxious to postpone making any alteration before he was absolutely\nobliged. Surely, he reasoned with himself, the land could not now be\nfar away; he had calculated his speed; he had kept a diligent reckoning\non the chart; surely, the shore must be almost in sight. He would not\ntrust his crew to keep watch; he was aware how easily their\ninexperienced eyes would be misled, and how they might mistake a\ndistant cloud-bank for the land they coveted to see; he kept watch for\nhimself; his own gaze was ever fixed upon the horizon; and in the\neagerness of his expectation he would repeatedly mount to the\ncross-trees to get a wider range of vision.\n\nBut land was not to be seen.\n\nNext day as Dick was standing at the bow, alternately considering the\ncanvas which his ship carried and the aspect presented by the sky, Mrs.\nWeldon approached him without his noticing her. She caught some\nmuttered expressions of bewilderment that fell from his lips, and asked\nhim whether he could see anything.\n\nHe lowered the telescope which he had been holding in his hand, and\nanswered,--\n\n\"No, Mrs. Weldon, I cannot see anything; and it is this Hiat perplexes\nme so sorely. I cannot understand why we have not already come in sight\nof land. It is nearly a month since we lost our poor dear captain.\nThere has been no delay in our progress; no stoppage in our rate of\nspeed. I cannot make it out.\"\n\n\"How far were we from land when we lost the captain?\"\n\n\"I am sure I am not far out in saying that we were scarcely more than\n4500 miles from the shores of America.\"\n\n\"And at what rate have we been sailing?\"\n\n\"Not much less than nine score knots a day.\"\n\n\"How long, then, do you reckon, Dick, we ought to be in arriving at the\ncoast?\"\n\n\"Under six-and-twenty days,\" replied Dick.\n\nHe paused before he spoke again, then added,--\n\n\"But what mystifies me even more than our failing to sight the land is\nthis: we have not come across a single vessel; and yet vessels without\nnumber are always traversing these seas.\"\n\n\"But do you not think,\" inquired Mrs. Weldon, \"that you have made some\nerror in your reckoning? Is your speed really what you have supposed?\"\n\n\"Impossible, madam,\" replied Dick, with an air of dignity, \"impossible\nthat I should have fallen into error. The log has been consulted,\nwithout fail, every half-hour. I am about to have it lowered now, and I\nwill undertake to show you that we are at this present moment making\nten miles an hour, which would give considerably over 200 miles a day.\"\n\nHe then called out to Tom,--\n\n\"Tom, lower the log!\"\n\nThe old man was quite accustomed to the duty. The log was fastened to\nthe line and thrown overboard. It ran out regularly for about\nfive-and-twenty fathoms, when all at once the line slackened in Tom's\nhand.\n\n\"It is broken!\" cried Tom; \"the cord is broken!\"\n\n\"Broken?\" exclaimed Dick: \"good heavens! we have lost the log!\"\n\nIt was too true. The log was gone.\n\nTom drew in the rope. Dick took it up and examined it. It had not\nbroken at its point of union with the log; it had given way in the\nmiddle, at a place where the strands in some unaccountable way had worn\nstrangely thin.\n\nDick's agony of mind, in spite of his effort to be calm, was intensely\ngreat. A suspicion of foul play involuntarily occurred to him. He knew\nthat the rope had been of first-rate make; he knew that it had been\nquite sound when used before; but he could prove nothing; he could only\nmourn over the loss which committed him to the sole remaining compass\nas his only guide.\n\nThat compass, too, although he knew it not, was misleading him entirely!\n\nMrs. Weldon sighed as she witnessed the grief which the loss manifestly\ncaused poor Dick, but in purest sympathy she said nothing, and retired\nthoughtfully to her cabin.\n\nIt was no longer possible to reckon the rate of progress, but there was\nno doubt that the \"Pilgrim\" continued to maintain at least her previous\nspeed.\n\nBefore another four-and-twenty hours had passed the barometer had\nfallen still lower, and the wind was threatening to rise to a velocity\nof sixty miles. Resolved to be on the safe side, Dick determined not\nonly to strike the top-gallant and the main-top-mast, but to take in\nall the lower sails. Indeed, he began to be aware that no time was to\nbe lost. The operation would not be done in a moment, and the storm was\napproaching. Dick made Tom take the helm; he ascended the shrouds with\nBat, Austin, and Act\u00c3\u00a6on, making Hercules stay on deck to slacken the\nhalyards as required.\n\nBy dint of arduous exertion, and at no little risk of being thrown\noverboard by the rolling of the ship, they succeeded in lowering the\ntwo masts; the fore-top-sail was then reefed, and the fore-sail\nentirely struck, so that the only canvas that the schooner carried was\nthe reefed fore-top and the one stay. These, however, made her run with\na terrific speed.\n\nEarly on the morning of the 12th, Dick noted with alarm that the\nbarometer had not ceased to fall, and now registered only 27.9\u00c2\u00b0. The\ntempest had continued to increase, till it was unsafe for the ship to\ncarry any canvas at all. The order was given for the top-sail to be\ntaken in, but it was too late; a violent gust carried the sail\ncompletely away, and Austin, who had made his way to the fore-top-yard,\nwas struck by the flying sheet; and although he was not seriously hurt,\nhe was obliged at once to return to deck.\n\nDick Sands became more uneasy than ever; he was tortured by\napprehensions of reefs outlying the shore, to which he imagined he must\nnow be close; but he could discern no rocks to justify his fears, and\nreturned to take his place at the helm.\n\nThe next moment Negoro appeared on deck; he pointed mysteriously to the\nfar-off horizon, as though he discerned some object, as a mountain,\nthere; and looking round with a malevolent smile, immediately left the\ndeck, and went back to his cabin.\n\n[Illustration: Under bare poles]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHOPE REVIVED.\n\n\nThe wind had now increased to a hurricane; it had veered to the\nsouth-west, and had attained a velocity little short of ninety miles an\nhour. On land, the most substantial of erections could with difficulty\nhave withstood its violence, and a vessel anchored in a roadstead must\nhave been torn from its moorings and cast ashore. The memorable storm\nthat had devastated the Island of Guadaloupe on the 25th of July, 1825,\nwhen heavy cannon were lifted from their carriages, could scarcely have\nbeen more furious, and it was only her mobility before the blast and\nthe solidity of her structure that gave the \"Pilgrim\" a hope of\nsurviving the tempest.\n\nA few minutes after the topsail had been lost, the small jib was\ncarried away. Dick Sands contemplated the possibility of throwing out a\nstorm-jib, made of extra strong canvas, as a means of bringing the ship\na little more under his control, but abandoned the idea as useless. It\nwas, therefore, under bare poles that the \"Pilgrim\" was driven along;\nbut in spite of the lack of canvas, the hull, masts, and rigging, gave\nsufficient purchase to the wind, and the progress of the schooner was\nprodigiously rapid; sometimes, indeed, she seemed to be literally\nlifted from the water, and scudded on, scarcely skimming its surface.\nThe rolling was fearful. Enormous waves followed in quick succession,\nand as they travelled faster than the ship, there was the perpetual\nrisk of one of them catching her astern. Without sail, there were no\nmeans of escaping that peril by increase of speed; the adroit\nmanagement of the helm was the only chance of avoiding the hazardous\nshocks, and even this repeatedly failed.\n\nTo prevent his being washed overboard Dick lashed himself to his place\nat the wheel by a rope round his waist, and made Tom and Bat keep close\nat hand, ready to give him assistance, in case of emergency. Hercules\nand Act\u00c3\u00a6on, clinging to the bitt, kept watch at the bow. Mrs. Weldon\nand her party, at Dick's special request, remained inside the stern\ncabin, although the lady, for her own part, would much rather have\nstayed on deck; she had, however, yielded to the representation that\nshe would thus be exposing herself to unnecessary danger.\n\nThe hatchways were hermetically closed, and it was to be hoped that\nthey would withstand the heavy sea that was dashing over them; only let\none of them give way to the pressure, and the vessel must inevitably\nfill and founder. It was a matter of congratulation that the stowage\nhad been done very carefully, so that notwithstanding all the lurchings\nof the ship, the cargo did not shift in the least.\n\nThe heroic young commander had still further curtailed his periods of\nrest, and it was only at the urgent entreaty of Mrs. Weldon, who feared\nthat he would exhaust himself by his vigilance, that he was induced to\nlie down for a few hours' sleep on the night of the 13th.\n\nAfter Tom and Bat had been left alone at the wheel they were, somewhat\nto their surprise, joined by Negoro, who very rarely came aft. He\nseemed inclined to enter into conversation, but found little\nencouragement to talk on the part either of Tom or his son. All at once\na violent roll of the ship threw him off his feet, and he would have\ngone overboard if he had not been saved by falling against the binnacle.\n\nOld Tom was in a frantic state of alarm lest the compass should be\nbroken. He uttered a cry of consternation so loud that it roused Dick\nfrom the light slumber into which he had fallen in the cabin, and he\nrushed to the deck. By the time he had reached the stern, Negoro had\nnot only regained his feet, but had managed successfully to conceal the\nbit of iron which he had again extracted from beneath the binnacle\nwhere he had himself laid it. Now that the wind had shifted to the\nsouth-west, it suited his machinations that the magnetic needle should\nindicate its true direction.\n\n[Illustration: Quick as lightning, Dick Sands drew a revolver from his\npocket.]\n\n\"How now?\" asked Dick eagerly; \"what is the meaning of all this noise?\"\n\nTom explained how the cook had fallen against the binnacle, and how he\nhad been terrified lest the compass should be injured. Dick's heart\nsank at the thought of losing his sole remaining compass, and his\nanxiety betrayed itself in his countenance as he knelt down to examine\nits condition; but he breathed freely as he ascertained that the\ninstrument had sustained no damage; by the dim light he saw the needle\nresting on its two concentric circles, and felt his fears at once\nrelieved; of course, he was quite unconscious of the fact that the\nremoval of the bit of iron had made the magnet change its pointing. The\nincident, however, excited his misgiving; although he felt that Negoro\ncould not be held responsible for an accidental fall, the very presence\nof the man in such a place at such a time perplexed him.\n\n\"And what brings you here, this hour of the night?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's not your business,\" retorted Negoro insolently.\n\n\"It is my business,\" replied Dick resolutely; \"and I mean to have an\nanswer; what brought you here?\"\n\nNegoro answered sullenly that he knew of no rule to prevent his going\nwhere he liked and when he liked.\n\n\"No rule!\" cried Dick; \"then I make the rule now. From this time\nforward, I make the rule that you shall never come astern. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nRoused from his accustomed doggedness, the man seemed to make a\nthreatening movement. Quick as lightning, Dick Sands drew a revolver\nfrom his pocket.\n\n\"Negoro, one act, one word of insubordination, and I blow out your\nbrains!\"\n\nNegoro had no time to reply; before he could speak he was bowed down\ntowards the deck by an irresistible weight. Hercules had grasped him by\nthe shoulder.\n\n\"Shall I put him overboard, captain? he will make a meal for the\nfishes; they are not very particular what they eat,\" said the negro,\nwith a grin of contempt.\n\n\"Not yet,\" quietly answered Dick.\n\nThe giant removed his hand, and Negoro stood upright again, and began\nto retreat to his own quarters, muttering, however, as he passed\nHercules,--\n\n\"You cursed nigger! You shall pay for this!\"\n\nThe discovery was now made that the wind apparently had taken a sudden\nshift of no less than forty-five degrees; but what occasioned Dick the\ngreatest perplexity was that there was nothing in the condition of the\nsea to correspond with the alteration in the current of the air;\ninstead of being directly astern, wind and waves were now beating on\nthe larboard. Progress in this way must necessarily be full of danger,\nand Dick was obliged to bring his ship up at least four points before\nhe got her straight before the tempest.\n\nThe young captain felt that he must be more than ever on the alert; he\ncould not shake off the suspicion that Negoro had been concerned in the\nloss of the first compass, and had some further designs upon the\nsecond. Still he was utterly at a loss to imagine what possible motive\nthe man could have for so criminal an act of malevolence, as there was\nno plausible reason to be assigned why he should not be as anxious as\nall the rest to reach the coast of America. The suspicion continued,\nhowever, to haunt him, and when he mentioned it to Mrs. Weldon he found\nthat a similar feeling of distrust had agitated her, although she, like\nhimself, was altogether unable to allege a likely motive why the cook\nshould contemplate so strange an act of mischief. It was determined\nthat a strict surveillance should be kept upon all the fellow's\nmovements.\n\nNegoro, however, manifested no inclination to disobey the captain's\nperemptory order; he kept strictly to his own part of the ship; but as\nDingo was now regularly quartered on the stern, there was a tolerably\nsure guarantee that the cook would not be found wandering much in that\ndirection.\n\nA week passed, and still the tempest showed no signs of abating; the\nbarometer continued to fall, and not once did a period of calmer\nweather afford an opportunity of carrying sail. The \"Pilgrim\" still\nmade her way northeast. Her speed could not be less than two hundred\nmiles in twenty-four hours. But no land appeared. Vast as was the range\nof the American continent, extending for 120 degrees between the\nAtlantic and the Pacific, it was nowhere to be discerned. Was he\ndreaming? was he mad? Dick would perpetually ask himself: had he been\nsailing in a wrong direction? had he failed to steer aright?\n\nBut no: he was convinced there was no error in his steering. Although\nhe could not actually see it for the mist, he knew that day after day\nthe sun rose before him, and that it set behind him. Yet he was\nconstrained in bewilderment to ask, what had become of those shores of\nAmerica upon which, when they came in sight, there was only too great a\nfear the ship should be dashed? what had become of them? where were\nthey? whither had this incessant hurricane driven them? why did not the\nexpected coast appear?\n\nTo all these bewildering inquiries Dick could find no answer except to\nimagine that his compass had misled him. Yet he was powerless to put\nhis own misgivings to the test; he deplored more than ever the\ndestruction of the duplicate instrument which would have checked his\nregisters. He studied his chart; but all in vain; the position in which\nhe found himself as the result of Negoro's treachery, seemed to baffle\nhim the more, the more he tried to solve the mystery.\n\nThe days were passing on in this chronic state of anxiety, when one\nmorning about eight o'clock, Hercules, who was on watch at the fore,\nsuddenly shouted,--\n\n\"Land!\"\n\nDick Sands had little reliance upon the negro's inexperienced eye, but\nhurried forward to the bow.\n\n\"Where's the land?\" he cried; his voice being scarcely audible above\nthe howling of the tempest.\n\n\"There! look there!\" said Hercules, nodding his head and pointing over\nthe larboard side, to the north-east.\n\nDick could see nothing.\n\nMrs. Weldon had heard the shout. Unable to restrain her interest, she\nhad left her cabin and was at Dick's side. He uttered an expression of\nsurprise at seeing her, but could not hear anything she said, as her\nvoice was unable to rise above the roaring of the elements; she stood,\nher whole being as it were concentrated in the power of vision, and\nscanned the horizon in the direction indicated by Hercules. But all to\nno purpose.\n\nSuddenly, however, after a while, Dick raised his hand.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said; \"yes; sure enough, yonder is land.\"\n\nHe clung with excitement to the netting; and Mrs Weldon, supported by\nHercules, strained her eyes yet more vehemently to get a glimpse of a\nshore which she had begun to despair of ever reaching.\n\nBeyond a doubt an elevated peak was there. It must be about ten miles\nto leeward. A break in the clouds soon left it more distinct. Some\npromontory it must be upon the American coast. Without sails, of\ncourse, the \"Pilgrim\" had no chance of bearing down direct upon it; but\nat least there was every reason to believe that she would soon reach\nsome other portion of the shore; perhaps before noon, certainly in a\nfew hours, they must be close to land.\n\nThe pitching of the ship made it impossible for Mrs. Weldon to keep\nsafe footing on the deck; accordingly, at a sign from Dick, Hercules\nled her back again to her cabin.\n\nDick did not remain long at the bow, but went thoughtfully back to the\nwheel.\n\nHe had, indeed, a tremendous responsibility before him. Here was the\nland, the land for which they had longed so eagerly; and now that their\nanticipations were on the point of being realized, what was there, with\na hurricane driving them on towards it, to prevent that land being\ntheir destruction? What measures could he take to prevent the schooner\nbeing dashed to pieces against it?\n\n[Illustration: \"There! look there!\"]\n\nAt the very moment when the promontory was just abreast of them, Negoro\nappeared on deck; he nodded to the peak familiarly, as he might have\nsaluted a familiar friend, and retired as stealthily as he had come.\n\nTwo hours later, and the promontory was lying to the larboard wake.\nDick Sands had never relaxed his watchfulness, but he had failed to\ndiscover any further indications of a coast-line. His perplexity could\nonly increase; the horizon was clear; the Andes ought to be distinct;\nthey would be conspicuous twenty miles or more away. Dick took up his\ntelescope again and again; he scrutinized the eastern horizon with\nminutest care; but there was nothing to be seen; and as the afternoon\nwaned away the last glimpse had been taken of the promontory that had\nawakened their expectation; it had vanished utterly from their gaze; no\nindication of shore could be seen from the \"Pilgrim's\" deck.\n\nDick Sands uttered a sigh of mingled amazement and relief. He went into\nMrs. Weldon's cabin, where she was standing with her party.\n\n\"It was only an island!\" he said; \"only an island!\"\n\n\"How? why? what island? what do you mean?\" cried Mrs. Weldon\nincredulously; \"what island can it be?\"\n\n\"The chart perhaps will tell us,\" replied Dick; and hurrying off to his\nown cabin, he immediately returned with the chart in his hands.\n\nAfter studying it attentively for a few minutes, he said,--\n\n\"There, Mrs. Weldon; the land we have just passed, I should suppose\nmust be that little speck in the midst of the Pacific. It must be\nEaster Island. At least, there seems to be no other land which possibly\nit could be.\"\n\n\"And do you say,\" inquired Mrs. Weldon, \"that we have left it quite\nbehind us?\"\n\n\"Yes, entirely; almost to windward.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon commenced a searching scrutiny of the map that was\noutspread before her.\n\n\"How far is this,\" she said, after bending a considerable time over the\nchart; \"how far is this from the coast of America?\"\n\n\"Thirty-five degrees,\" answered Dick; \"somewhere about 2500 miles.\"\n\n\"What ever do you mean?\" rejoined the lady astonished; \"if the\n'Pilgrim' is still 2500 miles from shore, she has positively made no\nprogress at all. Impossible!\"\n\nIn thoughtful perplexity, Dick passed his hand across his brow. He did\nnot know what to say. After an interval of silence, he said,--\n\n\"I have no account to give for the strange delay. It is inexplicable to\nmyself, except upon that one hypothesis, which I cannot resist, that\nthe readings of the compass, somehow or other, have been wrong.\"\n\nHe relapsed into silence. Then, brightening up, he added,--\n\n\"But, thank God! at least we have now the satisfaction of knowing where\nwe really are; we are no longer lost upon the wide Pacific; if only\nthis hurricane will cease, long as the distance seems, we are on our\nproper course to the shores of America.\"\n\nThe tone of confidence with which the youthful captain spoke had the\neffect of inspiring new hope into all who heard him; their spirits\nrose, and to their sanguine mood it seemed as if they were approaching\nto the end of all their troubles, and had hardly more to do than to\nawait the turning of a tide to bring them into a glad proximity to port.\n\nEaster Island, of which the true name is Vai-Hoo, was discovered by\nDavid in 1686 and visited by Cook and Lap\u00c3\u00a9rouse. It lies in lat. 27\u00c2\u00b0\nS., and long. 112 E.; consequently, it was evident that during the\nraging of the hurricane the schooner had been driven northwards no less\nthan fifteen degrees. Far away, however, as she was from shore, the\nwind could hardly fail within ten days to carry her within sight of\nland; and then, if the storm had worn itself out, (as probably it\nwould,) the \"Pilgrim\" would again hoist sail, and make her way into\nsome port with safety. Anyhow, the discovery of his true position\nrestored a spirit of confidence to Dick Sands, and he anticipated the\ntime when he should no longer be drifting helplessly before the storm.\n\nTo say the truth, the \"Pilgrim\" had suffered very little from the\nprolonged fury of the weather. The damage she had sustained was limited\nto the loss of the topsail and the small jib, which could be easily\nreplaced. The caulking of the seams remained thoroughly sound, and no\ndrop of water had found its way into the hold. The pumps, too, were\nperfectly free. Dick Sands did not fear for the stability of his ship;\nhis only anxiety was lest the weather should not moderate in time. Only\nlet the wind subside, and the schooner once more would be under his\ncontrol; but he never forgot that the ordering of the winds and waves\nwere in the hands of the Great Disposer of all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nLAND AT LAST.\n\n\nIt was not long before Dick's sanguine expectations were partially\nrealized, for on the very next day, which was the 27th, the barometer\nbegan to rise, not rapidly, but steadily, indicating that its elevation\nwould probably continue. The sea remained exceedingly rough, but the\nviolence of the wind, which had veered slightly towards the west, had\nperceptibly diminished. The tempest had passed its greatest fury, and\nwas beginning to wear itself out.\n\nNot a sail, however, could yet be hoisted; the smallest show of canvas\nwould have been carried away in an instant; nevertheless Dick hoped\nthat before another twenty-four hours were over, the \"Pilgrim\" might be\nable to carry a storm-jib.\n\nIn the course of the night the wind moderated still more and the\npitching of the ship had so far diminished that the passengers began to\nreappear on deck. Mrs. Weldon was the first to leave her enforced\nimprisonment. She was anxious to speak to Dick, whom she might have\nexpected to find looking pale and wan after his almost superhuman\nexertions and loss of sleep. But she was mistaken; however much the lad\nmight suffer from the strain in after-years, at present he exhibited no\nsymptoms of failing energy.\n\n\"Well, Captain Dick, how are you?\" she said, as she advanced towards\nhim holding out her hand.\n\nDick smiled.\n\n\"You call me captain, Mrs. Weldon,\" he answered, \"but you do not seem\ndisposed to submit implicitly to captain's orders. Did I not direct you\nto keep to your cabin?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"You have acquitted yourself like a man.\"]\n\n\"You did,\" replied the lady; \"but observing how much the storm had\nabated, I could not resist the temptation to disobey you.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, the weather is far more promising; the barometer has not\nfallen since yesterday morning, and I really trust the worst is over\nnow.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" she replied, and after a few moments' silence, she\nadded.--\n\n\"But now, Dick, you must really take some rest; you may perhaps not\nknow how much you require it; but it is absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"Rest!\" the boy repeated; \"rest! I want no rest. I have only done my\nduty, and it will be time enough for me to concern myself about my own\nrest, when I have seen my passengers in a place of safety.\"\n\n\"You have acquitted yourself like a man,\" said Mrs. Weldon; \"and you\nmay be assured that my husband, like myself, will never forget the\nservices you have rendered me. I shall urge upon him the request which\nI am sure he will not refuse, that you shall have your studies\ncompleted, so that you may be made a captain for the firm.\"\n\nTears of gratitude rose to Dick's eyes. He deprecated the praise that\nwas lavished upon him, but rejoiced in the prospect that seemed opening\nupon his future. Mrs. Weldon assured him that he was dear as a son to\nher, and pressed a gentle kiss upon his forehead. The lad felt that he\nwas animated, if need be, to yet greater hardships in behalf of his\nbenefactors, and resolved to prove himself even more worthy of their\nconfidence.\n\nBy the 29th, the wind had so far moderated that Dick thought he might\nincrease the \"Pilgrim's\" speed by hoisting the foresail and topsail.\n\n\"Now, my men, I have some work for you to-day,\" he said to the negroes\nwhen he came on deck at daybreak.\n\n\"All right, captain,\" answered Hercules, \"we are growing rusty for want\nof something to do.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you blow with your big mouth?\" said little Jack; \"you could\nhave beaten the wind all to nothing.\"\n\nDick laughed, and said, \"Not a bad idea, Jack; if ever we get becalmed,\nwe must get Hercules to blow into the sails.\"\n\n\"I shall be most happy,\" retorted the giant, and he inflated his huge\nchecks till he was the very impersonation of Boreas himself.\n\n\"But now to work!\" cried Dick; \"we have lost our topsail, and we must\ncontrive to hoist another. Not an easy matter, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I dare say we shall manage it,\" replied Act\u00c3\u00a6on.\n\n\"We must do our best,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Can't I help?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Of course you can,\" answered Dick; \"run along to the wheel, and assist\nBat.\"\n\nJack strutted off, proud enough of his commission.\n\nUnder Dick's directions, the negroes commenced their somewhat difficult\ntask. The new topsail, rolled up, had first of all to be hoisted, and\nthen to be made fast to the yard; but so adroitly did the crew carry\nout their orders, that in less than an hour the sail was properly set\nand flying with a couple of reefs. The foresail and second jib, which\nhad been taken down before the tempest, were hoisted again, and before\nten o'clock the \"Pilgrim\" was running along under the three sails which\nDick considered were as much as it was prudent to carry. Even at her\npresent speed, the schooner, he reckoned, would be within sight of the\nAmerican shore in about ten days. It was an immense relief to him to\nfind that she was no longer at the mercy of the waves, and when he saw\nthe sails properly set he returned in good spirits to his post at the\nhelm, not forgetting to thank the temporary helmsman for his services,\nnor omitting his acknowledgment to Master Jack, who received the\ncompliment with becoming gravity.\n\nAlthough the clouds continued to travel all the next day with great\nrapidity they were very much broken, and alternately the \"Pilgrim\" was\nbathed in sunlight and enveloped in vapours, which rolled on towards\nthe east. As the weather cleared, the hatchways were opened in order to\nventilate the ship, and the outer air was allowed again to penetrate\nnot only the hold, but the cabin and crew's quarters The wet sails were\nhung out to dry, the deck was washed down, for Dick Sands was anxious\nnot to bring his ship into port without having \"finished her toilet,\"\nand he found that his crew could very well spare a few hours daily to\nget her into proper trim.\n\n[Illustration: They both examined the outspread chart.]\n\nNotwithstanding the loss of the log, Dick had sufficient experience to\nbe able to make an approximate estimate of the schooner's progress, and\nafter having pointed out to Mrs. Weldon what he imagined was the\n\"Pilgrim's\" true position, he told her that it was his firm impression\nthat land would be sighted in little more than a week.\n\n\"And upon what part of South America do you reckon we are likely to\nfind ourselves?\" she asked.\n\n\"That is more than I dare venture to promise,\" replied Dick; \"but I\nshould think somewhere hereabouts.\"\n\nHe was pointing on the chart to the long shore-line of Chili and Peru.\n\nThey both examined the outspread chart with still closer attention.\n\n\"Here, you see,\" resumed Dick, \"here is the island we have just left;\nwe left it in the west; the wind has not shifted; we must expect to\ncome in sight of land, pretty nearly due east of it. The coast has\nplenty of harbours. From any one of them you will be able easily to get\nto San Francisco. You know, I dare say, that the Pacific Navigation\nCompany's steamers touch at all the principal ports. From any of them\nyou will be sure to get direct passage to California.\"\n\n\"But do you mean,\" asked Mrs. Weldon, \"that you are not going yourself\nto take the schooner to San Francisco?\"\n\n\"Not direct,\" replied the young captain; \"I want to see you safe on\nshore and satisfactorily on your homeward way. When that is done, I\nshall hope to get competent officers to take the ship to Valparaiso,\nwhere she will discharge her cargo, as Captain Hull intended; and\nafterwards I shall work our way back to San Francisco.\"\n\n\"Ah, well; we will see all about that in due time.\" Mrs. Weldon said,\nsmiling; and, after a short pause, added, \"At one time, Dick, you\nseemed to have rather a dread of the shore.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" answered Dick; \"but now I am in hopes we may fall in with\nsome passing vessel; we want to have a confirmation as to our true\nposition. I cannot tell you how surprised I am that we have not come\nacross a single vessel. But when we near the land we shall be able to\nget a pilot.\"\n\n\"But what will happen if we fail to get a pilot?\" was Mrs. Weldon's\ninquiry. She was anxious to learn how far the lad was prepared to meet\nany emergency.\n\nWith unhesitating promptness Dick replied,--\n\n\"Why, then, unless the weather takes the control of the ship out of my\nhands, I must patiently follow the coast until I come to a harbour of\nrefuge. But if the wind should freshen, I should have to adopt other\nmeasures.\"\n\n\"What then, Dick, what then?\" persisted Mrs. Weldon.\n\nThe boy's brow knitted itself together in resolution, and he said\ndeliberately,--\n\n\"I should run the ship aground.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon started.\n\n\"However,\" Dick continued, \"there is no reason to apprehend this. The\nweather has mended and is likely to mend. And why should we fear about\nfinding a pilot? Let us hope all will be well.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon at least had satisfied herself on one point. She had\nascertained that although Dick did not anticipate disaster, yet he was\nprepared in the case of emergency to resort to measures from which any\nbut the most experienced seaman would shrink.\n\nBut although Dick's equanimity had been successful in allaying any\nmisgivings on Mrs. Weldon's part, it must be owned that the condition\nof the atmosphere caused him very serious uneasiness.\n\nThe wind remained uncomfortably high, and the barometer gave very\nominous indications that it would ere long freshen still more. Dick\ndreaded that the time was about to return in which once again he must\nreduce his vessel to a state of bare poles; but so intense was his\naversion to having his ship so wrested as it were from his own\nmanagement, that he determined to carry the topsail till it was all but\ncarried away by the force of the blast. Concerned, moreover, for the\nsafety of his masts, the loss of which he acknowledged must be fatal,\nhe had the shrouds well overhauled and the backstays considerably\ntightened.\n\nMore than once another contingency occurred to his mind, and gave him\nsome anxiety. He could not overlook the possibility of the wind\nchanging all round. What should he do in such a case? He would of\ncourse endeavour by all means to get the schooner on by incessant\ntacking; but was there not the certainty of a most hazardous delay? and\nworse than this, was there not a likelihood of the \"Pilgrim\" being once\nagain driven far out to sea?\n\nHappily these forebodings were not realized. The wind, after chopping\nabout for several days, at one time blowing from the north, and at\nanother from the south, finally settled down into a stiffish gale from\nthe west, which did nothing worse than severely strain the masts.\n\nIn this weary but hopeful endurance time passed on. The 5th of April\nhad arrived. It was more than two months since the \"Pilgrim\" had\nquitted New Zealand; it was true that during the first three weeks of\nher voyage she had been impeded by protracted calms and contrary winds;\nbut since that time her speed had been rapid, the very tempests had\ndriven her forwards with unwonted velocity; she had never failed to\nhave her bow towards the land, and yet land seemed as remote as ever;\nthe coast line was retreating as they approached it. What could be the\nsolution of the mystery?\n\nFrom the cross-trees one or other of the negroes was kept incessantly\non the watch. Dick Sands himself, telescope in hand, would repeatedly\nascend in the hope of beholding some lofty peak of the Andes emerging\nfrom the mists that hung over the horizon. But all in vain.\n\nFalse alarms were given more than once. Sometimes Tom, sometimes\nHercules, or one of the others would be sure that a distant speck they\nhad descried was assuredly a mountain ridge; but the vapours were\ncontinually gathering in such fantastic forms that their unexperienced\neyes were soon deceived, and they seldom had to wait long before their\nfond delusion was all dispelled.\n\nAt last, the expected longing was fulfilled. At eight o'clock one\nmorning the mists seemed broken up with unusual rapidity, and the\nhorizon was singularly clear. Dick had hardly gone aloft when his voice\nrung out,--\n\n\"Land! Land ahead!\"\n\nAs if summoned by a spell, every one was on deck in an instant: Mrs.\nWeldon, sanguine of a speedy end to the general anxiety; little Jack,\ngratified at a new object of curiosity; Cousin Benedict, already\nscenting a new field for entomological investigation; old Nan; and the\nnegroes, eager to set foot upon American soil; all, with the exception\nof Negoro, all were on deck; but the cook did not stir from his\nsolitude, or betray any sympathy with the general excitement.\n\nWhatever hesitation there might be at first soon passed away; one after\nanother soon distinguished the shore they were approaching, and in half\nan hour there was no room for the most sceptical to doubt that Dick was\nright. There was land not far ahead.\n\nA few miles to the east there was a long low-lying coast; the chain of\nthe Andes ought to be visible; but it was obscured, of course, by the\nintervening clouds.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim\" bore down rapidly towards the land, and in a short time\nits configuration could be plainly made out. Towards the north-east the\ncoast terminated in a headland of moderate height sheltering a kind of\nroadstead; on the south-east it stretched out in a long and narrow\ntongue. The Andes were still wanting to the scene; they must be\nsomewhere in the background; but at present, strange to say, there was\nonly a succession of low cliffs with some trees standing out against\nthe sky. No human habitation, no harbour, not even an indication of a\nriver-mouth, could anywhere be seen.\n\nThe wind remained brisk, and the schooner was driving directly towards\nthe land, with sails shortened as seemed desirable; but Dick realized\nto himself the fact that he was utterly incapable of altering her\ncourse. With eager eyes he scrutinized his situation. Straight ahead\nwas a reef over which the waves were curling, and around which the surf\nmust be tremendous. It could hardly be more than a mile away. The wind\nseemed brisker than before.\n\nAfter gazing awhile, Dick seemed to have come to a sudden resolution.\nHe went quickly aft and took the helm. He had seen a little cove, and\nhad made up his mind that he would try and make his way into it. He did\nnot speak a word; he knew the difficulty of the task he had undertaken;\nhe was aware from the white foam, that there was shallow water on\neither hand; but he kept the secret of the peril to himself, and sought\nno counsel in coming to his fixed resolve.\n\nDingo had been trotting up and down the deck. All at once he bounded to\nthe fore, and broke out into a piteous howl. It roused Dick from his\nanxious cogitations. Was it possible that the animal recognized the\ncoast? It almost seemed as if it brought back some painful associations.\n\nThe howling of the dog had manifestly attracted Negoro's attention; the\nman emerged from his cabin, and, regardless of the dog, stood close to\nthe netting; but although he gazed at the surf, it did not seem to\noccasion him any alarm. Mrs. Weldon, who was watching him, fancied she\nsaw a flush rise to his face, which involuntarily suggested the thought\nto her mind that Negoro had seen the place before.\n\nEither she had no time or no wish to express what had struck her, for\nshe did not mention it to Dick, who, at that moment, left the helm, and\ncame and stood beside her.\n\nDick looked as if he were taking a lingering farewell of the cove past\nwhich they were being carried beyond his power to help.\n\nIn a few moments he turned round to Mrs. Weldon, and said quietly,--\n\n\"Mrs. Weldon, I am disappointed. I hoped to get the schooner into\nyonder cove; but there is no chance now; if nothing is done, in half an\nhour she will be upon that reef. I have but one alternative left. I\nmust run her aground. It will be utter destruction to the ship, but\nthere is no choice. Your safety is the first and paramount\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that there is no other course to be taken, Dick?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" said Dick decidedly.\n\n\"It must be as you will,\" she said.\n\nForthwith ensued the agitating preparations for stranding. Mrs. Weldon,\nJack, Cousin Benedict, and Nan were provided with life belts, while\nDick and the negroes made themselves ready for being dashed into the\nwaves. Every precaution that the emergency admitted was duly taken.\nMrs. Weldon was entrusted to the special charge of Hercules; Dick made\nhimself responsible for doing all he could for little Jack; Cousin\nBenedict, who was tolerably calm, was handed over to Bat and Austin;\nwhile Act\u00c3\u00a6on promised to look after Nan. Negoro's nonchalance implied\nthat he was quite capable of shifting for himself.\n\nDick had the forethought also to order about a dozen barrels of their\ncargo to be brought in front, so that when the \"Pilgrim\" struck, the\noil escaping and floating on the waves would temporarily lull their\nfury, and make smoother water for the passage of the ship.\n\nAfter satisfying himself that there was no other measure to be taken to\nameliorate the peril, Dick Sands returned to the helm. The schooner was\nall but upon the reef, and only a few cables' length from the shore;\nher starboard quarter indeed was already bathed in the seething foam,\nand any instant the keel might be expected to grate upon the\nunder-lying rock. Presently a change of colour in the water was\nobserved; it revealed a passage between the rocks. Dick gave the wheel\na turn; he saw the chance of getting aground nearer to the shore than\nhe had dared to hope, and he made the most of it. He steered the\nschooner right into the narrow channel; the sea was furious, and dashed\nvehemently upon the crags on either hand.\n\n[Illustration: The sea was furious, and dashed vehemently upon the\ncrags on either hand]\n\n\"Now, my lads!\" he cried to his crew, \"now's your time; out with your\noil! let it run!\"\n\nReady for the order, the negroes poured out the oil, and the raging\nwaters were stilled as if by magic. A few moments more and perchance\nthey would rage more vehemently than ever. But for the instant they\nwere lulled.\n\nThe \"Pilgrim,\" meanwhile, had glided onwards, and made dead for the\nadjacent shore. There was a sudden shock. Caught by an enormous wave\nthe schooner had been hurled aground; her masts had fallen, fortunately\nwithout injury to any one on board. But the vessel had parted\namidships, and was foundering; the water was rushing irresistibly into\nthe hold.\n\nThe shore, however, was not half a cable's length away; there was a\nlow, dark ridge of rocks that was united to the beach; it afforded\nample means of rescue, and in less than ten minutes the \"Pilgrim's\"\ncaptain, crew, and passengers were all landed, with their lives, at the\nfoot of the overhanging cliff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nASHORE.\n\n\nThus, after a voyage of seventy-four days, the \"Pilgrim\" had stranded.\nMrs. Weldon and her fellow-voyagers joined in thanksgiving to the kind\nProvidence that had brought them ashore, not upon one of the solitary\nislands of Polynesia, but upon a solid continent, from almost any part\nof which there would be no difficulty in getting home.\n\nThe ship was totally lost. She was lying in the surf a hopeless wreck,\nand few must be the hours that would elapse before she would be broken\nup in scattered fragments; it was impossible to save her.\nNotwithstanding that Dick Sands bewailed the loss of a valuable ship\nand her cargo to the owner, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he\nhad been instrumental in saving what was far more precious, the lives\nof the owner's wife and son.\n\nIt was impossible to do more than hazard a conjecture as to the part of\nthe South American coast on which the \"Pilgrim\" had been cast. Dick\nimagined that it must be somewhere on the coast of Peru; after sighting\nEaster Island, he knew that the united action of the equatorial current\nand the brisk wind must have had the effect of driving the schooner far\nnorthward, and he formed his conclusion accordingly. Be the true\nposition, however, what it might, it was all important that it should\nbe accurately ascertained as soon as possible. If it were really in\nPeru, he would not be long in finding his way to one of the numerous\nports and villages that lie along the coast.\n\nBut the shore here was quite a desert. A narrow strip of beach, strewn\nwith boulders, was enclosed by a cliff of no great height, in which, at\nirregular intervals, deep funnels appeared as chasms in the rock. Here\nand there a gentle slope led to the top.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile to the north was the mouth of a little river\nwhich had not been visible from the sea. Its banks were overhung by a\nnumber of \"rhizophora,\" a species of mangrove entirely distinct from\nthat indigenous to India. It was soon ascertained that the summit of\nthe cliff was clothed by a dense forest, extending far away in\nundulations of verdure to the mountains in the background. Had Cousin\nBenedict been a botanist, he could not have failed to find a new and\ninteresting field for his researches; there were lofty baobabs (to\nwhich an extraordinary longevity has often been erroneously ascribed),\nwith bark resembling Egyptian syenite; there were white pines,\ntamarinds, pepper-plants of peculiar species, and numerous other plants\nunfamiliar to the eye of a native of the North; but, strange to say,\nthere was not a single specimen of the extensive family of palms, of\nwhich more than a thousand varieties are scattered in profusion in so\nmany quarters of the globe.\n\nAbove the shore hovered a large number of screeching birds, mostly of\nthe swallow tribe, their black plumage shot with steelly blue, and\nshading off to a light brown at the top of the head. Now and then a few\npartridges of a greyish colour rose on wing, their necks entirely bare\nof feathers: the fearless manner in which the various birds all allowed\nthemselves to be approached made Mrs. Weldon and Dick both wonder if\nthe shores upon which they had been thrown were not so deserted that\nthe sound of fire-arms was not known.\n\nOn the edge of the reefs some pelicans (of the species known as\n_pelicanus minor_) were busily filling their pouches with tiny fish,\nand some gulls coming in from the open sea began to circle round the\nwreck: with these exceptions not a living creature appeared in sight.\nBenedict, no doubt, could have discovered many entomological novelties\namongst the foliage, but these could give no more information than the\nbirds as to the name of their habitat. Neither north, nor south, nor\ntowards the forest, was there trace of rising smoke, or any footprint\nor other sign to indicate the presence of a human being.\n\nDick's surprise was very great. He knew that the proximity of a native\nwould have made Dingo bark aloud; but the dog gave no warning; he was\nrunning backwards and forwards, his tail lowered and his nose close to\nthe ground; now and again he uttered a deep growl.\n\n\"Look at Dingo!\" said Mrs. Weldon; \"how strange he is! he seems to be\ntrying to discover a lost scent.\"\n\nAfter watching the dog for a time, she spoke again:--\n\n\"Look, too, at Negoro! he and the dog seem to be on the same purpose!\"\n\n\"As to Negoro,\" said Dick, \"I cannot concern myself with him now; he\nmust do as he pleases; I have no further control over him; his service\nexpires with the loss of the ship.\"\n\nNegoro was in fact walking to and fro, surveying the shore with the air\nof a man who was trying to recall some past experience to his\nrecollection. His dogged taciturnity was too well known for any one to\nthink of questioning him; every one was accustomed to let him go his\nown way, and when Dick noticed that he had gone towards the little\nriver, and had disappeared behind the cliff, he thought no more about\nhim. Dingo likewise had quite forgotten his enemy, and desisted from\nhis growling.\n\nThe first necessity for the shipwrecked party was to find a temporary\nshelter where they might take some refreshment. There was no lack of\nprovisions; independently of the resources of the land, the ebbing tide\nhad left upon the rocks the great bulk of the \"Pilgrim's\" stores, and\nthe negroes had already collected several kegs of biscuit, and a number\nof cases of preserved meat, besides a variety of other supplies. All\nthat they rescued they carefully piled up above high-water mark. As\nnothing appeared to be injured by the sea-water, the victualling of the\nparty all seemed to be satisfactorily secure for the interval which\nmust elapse (and they all believed it would not be long,) before they\nreached one of the villages which they presumed were close at hand.\nDick, moreover, took the precaution of sending Hercules to get a small\nsupply of fresh water from the river hard by, and the good-natured\nfellow returned carrying a whole barrel-full on his shoulder.\n\n[Illustration: Surveying the shore with the air of a man who was trying\nto recall some past experience]\n\nPlenty of fuel was lying about, and whenever they wanted to light a\nfire they were sure of having an abundance of dead wood and the roots\nof the old mangroves. Old Tom, an inveterate smoker, always carried a\ntinder box in his pocket; this had been too tightly fastened to be\naffected by the moisture, and could always produce a spark upon\noccasion.\n\nStill they must have a shelter. Without some rest it was impossible to\nstart upon a tour of exploration; accordingly, all interests were\ndirected towards ascertaining where the necessary repose could be\nobtained.\n\nThe honour of discovering where the desired retreat could be found fell\nto the lot of little Jack. Trotting about at the foot of the cliff, he\ncame upon one of those grottoes which are constantly being found\nhollowed out in the rock by the vehement action of the waves in times\nof tempest.\n\n\"Here, look here!\" cried the child; \"here's a place!\"\n\n\"Well done, Jack!\" answered his mother; \"your lucky discovery is just\nwhat we wanted. If we were going to stay here any time we should have\nto do the same as the Swiss Family Robinson, and name the spot after\nyou!\"\n\nIt was hardly more than twelve or fourteen feet square, and yet the\ngrotto seemed to Jack to be a gigantic cavern. But narrow as its limits\nwere, it was capacious enough to receive the entire party. It was a\ngreat satisfaction to Mrs. Weldon to observe that it was perfectly dry,\nand as the moon was just about her first quarter there was no\nlikelihood of a tide rising to the foot of the cliff. At any rate, it\nwas resolved that they might take up their quarters there for a few\nhours.\n\nShortly after one o'clock the whole party were seated upon a carpet of\nseaweed round a repast consisting of preserved meat, biscuit, and water\nflavoured with a few drops of rum, of which Bat had saved a quart\nbottle from the wreck. Even Negoro had returned and joined the group;\nprobably he had not cared to venture alone along the bank of the stream\ninto the forest. He sat listening, as it seemed indifferently, to the\nvarious plans for the future that were being discussed, and did not\nopen his mouth either by way of remonstrance or suggestion.\n\nDingo was not forgotten, and had his share of food duly given him\noutside the grotto, where he was keeping guard.\n\nWhen the meal was ended, Mrs. Weldon, passing her arms round Jack, who\nwas lounging half asleep with excitement and fatigue at her side, was\nthe first to speak.\n\n\"My dear Dick,\" she said, \"in the name of us all, let me thank you for\nthe services you have rendered us in our tedious time of difficulty. As\nyou have been our captain at sea, let me beg you to be our guide upon\nland. We shall have perfect confidence in your judgment, and await your\ninstructions as to what our next proceedings shall be.\"\n\nAll eyes were turned upon Dick. Even Negoro appeared to be roused to\ncuriosity, as if eager to know what he had to say.\n\nDick did not speak for some moments. He was manifestly pondering what\nstep he should advise. After a while he said,--\n\n\"My own impression, Mrs. Weldon, is that we have been cast ashore upon\none of the least-frequented parts of the coast of Peru, and that we are\nnear the borders of the Pampas. In that case I should conclude that we\nare at a considerable distance from any village. Now, I should\nrecommend that we stay here altogether for the coming night. To-morrow\nmorning, two of us can start off on an exploring expedition. I\nentertain but little doubt that natives will be met with within ten or\na dozen miles.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon looked doubtful. Plainly she thought unfavourably of the\nproject of separating the party. She reflected for a considerable time,\nand then asked,--\n\n\"And who is to undertake the task of exploring?\"\n\nPrompt was Dick's answer:--\n\n\"Tom and I.\"\n\n\"And leave us here?\" suggested the lady.\n\n\"Yes; to take care of you, there will be Hercules, Bat, Act\u00c3\u00a6on and\nAustin. Negoro, too, I presume, means to remain here,\" said Dick,\nglancing towards the cook.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Negoro, sparing as ever of his words.\n\n\"We shall take Dingo,\" added Dick; \"likely enough he may be useful.\"\n\nAt the sound of his name the dog had entered the grotto. A short bark\nseemed to testify his approval of Dick's proposal.\n\nMrs. Weldon was silent. She looked sad and thoughtful. It was hard to\nreconcile herself to the division of the party. She was aware that the\nseparation would not be for long, but she could not suppress a certain\nfeeling of nervousness. Was it not possible that some natives,\nattracted by the wreck, would assault them in hopes of plunder?\n\nEvery argument he could think of, Dick brought forward to reassure the\nlady. He told her that the Indians were perfectly harmless, and\nentirely different to the savage tribes of Africa and Polynesia; there\nwas no reason to apprehend any mischief, even if they should chance to\nencounter them, which was itself extremely unlikely. No doubt the\nseparation would have its inconveniences, but they would be\ninsignificant compared with the difficulty of traversing the country\n_en masse_. Tom and he would have far greater freedom if they went\nalone, and could make their investigations much more thoroughly.\nFinally he promised that if within two days they failed to discover\nhuman habitation, they would return to the grotto forthwith.\n\n\"I confess, however,\" he added, \"that I have little expectation of\nbeing able to ascertain our true position, until I have penetrated some\ndistance into the country.\"\n\nThere was nothing in Dick's representations but what commanded Mrs.\nWeldon's assent as reasonable. It was simply her own nervousness, she\nacknowledged, that made her hesitate; but it was only with extreme\nreluctance that she finally yielded to the proposition.\n\n\"And what, Mr. Benedict, is your opinion of my proposal?\" said Dick,\nturning to the entomologist.\n\n\"I?\" answered Cousin Benedict, looking somewhat bewildered, \"Oh, I am\nagreeable to anything. I dare say I shall find some specimens. I think\nI will go and look at once.\"\n\n\"Take my advice, and don't go far away,\" replied Dick.\n\n\"All right; I shall take care of myself.\"\n\n\"And don't be bringing back a lot of mosquitoes,\" said old Tom\nmischievously.\n\nWith his box under his arm, the naturalist left the grotto.\n\nNegoro followed almost immediately. He did not take the same direction\nas Benedict up the cliff, but for the second time bent his steps\ntowards the river, and proceeded along its bank till he was out of\nsight.\n\nIt was not long before Jack's exertions told upon him, and he fell into\na sound sleep. Mrs. Weldon having gently laid him on Nan's lap,\nwandered out and made her way to the water's edge. She was soon joined\nby Dick and the negroes, who wanted to see whether it was possible to\nget to the \"Pilgrim,\" and secure any articles that might be serviceable\nfor future use. The reef on which the schooner had stranded was now\nquite dry, and the carcase of the vessel which had been partially\ncovered at high water was lying in the midst of _debris_ of the most\npromiscuous character. The wide difference between high and low-water\nmark caused Dick Sands no little surprise. He knew that the tides on\nthe shores of the Pacific were very inconsiderable; in his own mind,\nhowever, he came to the conclusion that the phenomenon was to be\nexplained by the unusually high wind that had been blowing on the coast.\n\nNot without emotion could Mrs. Weldon, or indeed any of them, behold\nthe unfortunate ship upon which they had spent so many eventful days,\nlying dismasted on her side. But there was little time for sentiment.\nIf they wished to visit the hull before it finally went to pieces there\nmust be no delay.\n\nHoisting themselves by some loose rigging that was hanging from the\ndeck, Dick and several of the negroes contrived to make their way into\nthe interior of the hull. Dick left his men to gather together all they\ncould in the way of food and drink from the store-room, and himself\nwent straight to the stern cabin, into which the water had not\npenetrated. Here he found four excellent Purday's Remington rifles and\na hundred cartridges; with these he determined to arm his party, in\ncase they should be attacked by Indians. He also chose six of the\nstrongest of the cutlasses that are used for slicing up dead whales;\nand did not forget the little toy gun which was Jack's special\nproperty. Unexpectedly he found a pocket-compass, which he was only too\nglad to appropriate. What a boon it would have been had he discovered\nit earlier! The ship's charts in the fore-cabin were too much injured\nby water to be of any further service. Nearly everything was either\nlost or spoiled, but the misfortune was not felt very acutely because\nthere was ample provision for a few days, and it seemed useless to\nburden themselves with more than was necessary. Dick hardly needed Mrs.\nWeldon's advice to secure all the money that might be on board, but\nafter the most diligent search he failed to discover more than five\nhundred dollars. This was a subject of perplexity. Mrs. Weldon herself\nhad had a considerably larger sum than this, and Captain Hull was known\nalways to keep a good reserve in hand. There was but one way to solve\nthe mystery. Some one had been beforehand to the wreck. It could not be\nany of the negroes, as not one of them had for a moment left the\ngrotto. Suspicion naturally fell upon Negoro, who had been out alone\nupon the shore. Morose and cold-blooded as the man was, Dick hardly\nknew why he should suspect him of the crime of theft; nevertheless, he\ndetermined to cross-examine him, and, if need be, to have him searched,\nas soon as he came back.\n\n[Illustration: Not without emotion could Mrs. Weldon, or indeed any of\nthem, behold the unfortunate ship.]\n\nThe day wore onwards to its close. The sun was approaching the vernal\nequinox, and sank almost perpendicularly on to the horizon. Twilight\nwas very short, and the rapidity with which darkness came on confirmed\nDick in his belief that they had got ashore at some spot lying between\nthe tropic of Capricorn and the equator.\n\nThey all assembled in the grotto again for the purpose of getting some\nsleep.\n\n\"Another rough night coming on!\" said Tom, pointing to the heavy clouds\nthat hung over the horizon.\n\n\"No doubt, Tom!\" answered Dick, \"and I think we may congratulate\nourselves on being safe out of our poor ship.\"\n\nAs the night could not be otherwise than very dark, it was arranged\nthat the negroes should take their turns in keeping guard at the\nentrance of the grotto. Dingo also would be upon the alert.\n\nBenedict had not yet returned. Hercules shouted his name with the full\nstrength of his capacious lungs, and shortly afterwards the\nentomologist was seen making his way down the face of the cliff at the\nimminent risk of breaking his neck. He was in a great rage. He had not\nfound a single insect worth having, scorpions, scolopendra, and other\nmyriapoda were in the forest in abundance; but not one of these of\ncourse could be allowed a place in his collection.\n\n\"Have I come six thousand miles for this?\" he cried: \"have I endured\nstorm and shipwreck only to be cast where not a hexapod is to be seen?\nThe country is detestable! I shall not stay in it another hour!\"\n\nEver gentle to his eccentricities, Mrs. Weldon soothed him as she would\na child, she told him that he had better take some rest now, and most\nlikely he would have better luck to-morrow.\n\nCousin Benedict had hardly been pacified when Tom remarked that Negoro\ntoo had not returned.\n\n\"Never mind!\" said Bat, \"his room is as good as his company.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I altogether think so. The man is no favourite of\nmine, but I like him better under my own eye,\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Perhaps he has his own reasons for keeping away,\" said Dick, and\ntaking Mrs. Weldon aside, he communicated to her his suspicions of the\nfellow's dishonesty.\n\nHe found that she coincided with him in her view of Negoro's conduct;\nbut she did not agree with him in his proposal to have him searched at\nonce. If he returned, she should be convinced that he had deposited the\nmoney in some secret spot; and as there would be no proof of his guilt,\nit would be better to leave him, at least for a time, uninterrogated.\n\n[Illustration: The entomologist was seen making his way down the face\nof the cliff at the imminent risk of breaking his neck.]\n\nDick was convinced by her representations, and promised to act upon her\nadvice.\n\nBefore they resigned themselves to sleep, they had repeatedly summoned\nNegoro back, but he either could not or would not hear. Mrs. Weldon and\nDick scarcely knew what to think; unless he had lost his way; it was\nunaccountable why he should be wandering about alone on a dark night in\na strange country.\n\nPresently Dingo was heard barking furiously. He had left the opening of\nthe grotto, and was evidently down at the water's edge. Imagining that\nNegoro must be coming, Dick sent three of the negroes in the direction\nof the river to meet him; but when they reached the bank not a soul\ncould be seen, and as Dingo was quiet again, they made their way back\nto the grotto.\n\nExcepting the man left on watch, they now all lay down, hoping to get\nsome repose. Mrs. Weldon, however, could not sleep. The land for which\nshe had sighed so ardently had been reached, but it had failed to give\neither the security or the comfort which she had anticipated!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA STRANGER.\n\n\nAt daybreak, next morning, Austin, who happened to be on guard, heard\nDingo bark, and noticed that he started up and ran towards the river.\nArousing the inmates of the grotto, he announced to them that some one\nwas coming.\n\n\"It isn't Negoro,\" said Tom; \"Dingo would bark louder than that if\nNegoro were to be seen.\"\n\n\"Who, then, can it be?\" asked Mrs. Weldon, with an inquiring glance\ntowards Dick.\n\n\"We must wait and see, madam,\" replied Dick quietly.\n\nBidding Bat, Austin, and Hercules follow his example, Dick Sands took\nup a cutlass and a rifle, into the breach of which he slipped a\ncartridge. Thus armed, the four young men made their way towards the\nriver bank. Tom and Act\u00c3\u00a6on were left with Mrs. Weldon at the entrance\nof the grotto.\n\nThe sun was just rising. Its rays, intercepted by the lofty range of\nmountains in the east, did not fall directly on the cliff; but the sea\nto its western horizon was sparkling in the sunbeams as the party\nmarched along the shore. Dingo was motionless as a setter, but did not\ncease barking. It soon proved not to be his old enemy who was\ndisturbing him. A man, who was not Negoro, appeared round the angle of\nthe cliff, and advancing cautiously along the bank of the stream,\nseemed by his gestures to be endeavouring to pacify the dog, with which\nan encounter would certainly have been by no means desirable.\n\n\"That's not Negoro!\" said Hercules.\n\n[Illustration: \"Good morning, my young friend.\"]\n\n\"No loss for any of us,\" muttered Bat.\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Dick; \"perhaps he is a native; let us hope he\nmay be able to tell us our whereabouts, and save us the trouble of\nexploring.\"\n\nWith their rifles on their shoulders, they advanced steadily towards\nthe new arrival. The stranger, on becoming aware of their approach,\nmanifested great surprise; he was apparently puzzled as to how they had\nreached the shore, for the \"Pilgrim\" had been entirely broken up during\nthe night, and the spars that were floating about had probably been too\nfew and too scattered to attract his attention. His first attitude\nseemed to betray something of fear; and raising to his shoulder a gun\nthat had been slung to his belt, he began to retrace his steps; but\nconciliatory gestures on the part of Dick quickly reassured him, and\nafter a moment's hesitation, he continued to advance.\n\nHe was a man of about forty years of age, strongly built, with a keen,\nbright eye, grizzly hair and beard, and a complexion tanned as with\nconstant exposure to the forest air. He wore a broad-brimmed hat, a\nkind of leather jerkin, or tunic, and long boots reaching nearly to his\nknees. To his high heels was fastened a pair of wide-rowelled spurs,\nwhich clanked as he moved.\n\nDick Sands in an instant saw that he was not looking upon one of the\nroving Indians of the pampas, but upon one of those adventurers, often\nof very doubtful character, who are not unfrequently to be met with in\nthe remotest quarters of the earth. Clearly this was neither an Indian\nnor a Spaniard. His erect, not to say rigid deportment, and the reddish\nhue with which his hair and beard were streaked, betokened him to be of\nAnglo-Saxon origin, a conjecture which was at once confirmed when upon\nDick's wishing him \"good morning,\" he replied in unmistakable English,\nwith hardly a trace of foreign accent,--\n\n\"Good morning, my young friend.\"\n\nHe stepped forward, and having shaken hands with Dick, nodded to all\nhis companions.\n\n\"Are you English?\" he asked.\n\n\"No; we are Americans,\" replied Dick.\n\n\"North or South?\" inquired the man.\n\n\"North,\" Dick answered.\n\nThe information seemed to afford the stranger no little satisfaction,\nand he again wrung Dick's hand with all the enthusiasm of a\nfellow-countryman.\n\n\"And may I ask what brings you here?\" he continued.\n\nBefore, however, Dick had time to reply, the stranger had courteously\nraised his hat, and, looking round, Dick saw that his bow was intended\nfor Mrs. Weldon, who had just reached the river-bank. She proceeded to\ntell him the particulars of how they had been shipwrecked, and how the\nvessel had gone to pieces on the reefs.\n\nA look of pity crossed the man's face as he listened, and he cast his\neye, as it might be involuntarily, upon the sea, in order to discern\nsome vestige of the stranded ship.\n\n\"Ah! there is nothing to be seen of our poor schooner!\" said Dick\nmournfully; \"the last of her was broken up in the storm last night.\"\n\n\"And now,\" interposed Mrs. Weldon, \"can you tell us where we are?\"\n\n\"Where?\" exclaimed the man, with every indication of surprise at her\nquestion; \"why, on the coast of South America, of course!\"\n\n\"But on what part? are we near Peru?\" Dick inquired eagerly.\n\n\"No, my lad, no; you are more to the south; you are on the coast of\nBolivia; close to the borders of Chili.\"\n\n\"A good distance, I suppose, from Lima?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"From Lima? yes, a long way; Lima is far to the north.\"\n\n\"And what is the name of that promontory?\" Dick said, pointing to the\nadjacent headland.\n\n\"That, I confess, is more than I am able to tell you,\" replied the\nstranger; \"for although I have travelled a great deal in the interior\nof the country, I have never before visited this part of the coast.\"\n\nDick pondered in thoughtful silence over the information he had thus\nreceived. He had no reason to doubt its accuracy; according to his own\nreckoning he would have expected to come ashore somewhere between the\nlatitudes of 27\u00c2\u00b0 and 30\u00c2\u00b0; and by this stranger's showing he had made\nthe latitude 25\u00c2\u00b0; the discrepancy was not very great; it was not more\nthan might be accounted for by the action of the currents, which he\nknew he had been unable to estimate; moreover, the deserted character\nof the whole shore inclined him to believe more easily that he was in\nLower Bolivia.\n\nWhilst this conversation was going on, Mrs. Weldon, whose suspicions\nhad been excited by Negoro's disappearance, had been scrutinizing the\nstranger with the utmost attention; but she could detect nothing either\nin his manner or in his words to give her any cause to doubt his good\nfaith.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" she said presently; \"but you do not seem to me to be a\nnative of Peru?\"\n\n\"No; like yourself, I am an American, Mrs. ----;\" he paused, as if\nwaiting to be told her name.\n\nThe lady smiled, and gave her name; he thanked her, and continued,--\n\n\"My name is Harris. I was born in South Carolina; but it is now twenty\nyears since I left my home for the pampas of Bolivia; imagine,\ntherefore, how much pleasure it gives me to come across some countrymen\nof my own.\"\n\n\"Do you live in this part of the province, Mr. Harris?\" Mrs. Weldon\nasked.\n\n\"No, indeed; far away; I live down to the south, close to the borders\nof Chili. At present I am taking a journey north-eastwards to Atacama.\"\n\n\"Atacama!\" exclaimed Dick; \"are we anywhere near the desert of Atacama?\"\n\n\"Yes, my young friend,\" rejoined Harris, \"you are just on the edge of\nit. It extends far beyond those mountains which you see on the horizon,\nand is one of the most curious and least explored parts of the\ncontinent.\"\n\n\"And are you travelling through it alone?\" Mrs. Weldon inquired.\n\n\"Yes, quite alone; and it is not the first time I have performed the\njourney. One of my brothers owns a large farm, the hacienda of San\nFelice, about 200 miles from here, and I have occasion now and then to\npay him business visits.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"He is my little son.\"]\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, as if he were weighing a sudden thought,\nhe continued,--\n\n\"I am on my way there now, and if you will accompany me I can promise\nyou a hearty welcome, and my brother will be most happy to do his best\nto provide you with means of conveyance to San Francisco.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon had hardly begun to express her thanks for the proposal\nwhen he said abruptly,--\n\n\"Are these negroes your slaves?\"\n\n\"Slaves! sir,\" replied Mrs. Weldon, drawing herself up proudly; \"we\nhave no slaves in the United States. The south has now long followed\nthe example of the north. Slavery is abolished.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, madam. I had forgotten that the war of 1862 had\nsolved that question. But seeing these fellows with you, I thought\nperhaps they might be in your service,\" he added, with a slight tone of\nirony.\n\n\"We are very proud to be of any service to Mrs. Weldon,\" Tom interposed\nwith dignity, \"but we are no man's property. It is true I was sold for\na slave when I was six years old; but I have long since had my freedom;\nand so has my son. Bat here, and all his friends, were born of free\nparents.\"\n\n\"Ah! well then, I have to congratulate you,\" replied Harris, in a\nmanner that jarred very sensibly upon Mrs. Weldon's feelings; but she\nsaid nothing.\n\nHarris added,--\n\n\"I can assure you that you are as safe here in Bolivia as you would be\nin New England.\"\n\nHe had not finished speaking, when Jack, followed by Nan, came out of\nthe grotto. The child was rubbing his eyes, having only just awakened\nfrom his night's sleep. Catching sight of his mother, he darted towards\nher.\n\n\"What a charming little boy!\" exclaimed Harris.\n\n\"He is my little son,\" said Mrs. Weldon, kissing the child by way of\nmorning greeting.\n\n\"Ah, madam, I am sure you must have suffered doubly on his account.\nWill the little man let me kiss him too?\"\n\nBut there was something in the stranger's appearance that did not take\nJack's fancy, and he shrank back timidly to his mother's side.\n\n\"You must excuse him, sir; he is very shy.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Harris; \"we shall be better acquainted by-and-by.\nWhen we get to my brother's, he shall have a nice little pony to ride.\"\n\nBut not even this tempting offer seemed to have any effect in coaxing\nJack into a more genial mood. He kept fast hold of his mother's hand,\nand she, somewhat vexed at his behaviour, and anxious that no offence\nshould be given to a man who appeared so friendly in his intentions,\nhastened to turn the conversation to another topic.\n\nMeantime Dick Sands had been considering Harris's proposal. Upon the\nwhole, the plan of making their way to the hacienda of San Felice\nseemed to commend itself to his judgment; but he could not conceal from\nhimself that a journey of 200 miles across plains and forests, without\nany means of transport, would be extremely fatiguing. On expressing his\ndoubts on this point, he was met with the reply,--\n\n\"Oh, that can be managed well enough, young man; just round the corner\nof the cliff there I have a horse, which is quite at the disposal of\nthe lady and her son; and by easy stages of ten miles or so a day, it\nwill do the rest of us no harm to travel on foot. Besides,\" he added,\n\"when I spoke of the journey being 200 miles, I was thinking of\nfollowing, as I usually do, the course of the river; but by taking a\nshort cut across the forest, we may reduce the distance by nearly\neighty miles.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon was about to say how grateful she was, but Harris\nanticipated her.\n\n\"Not a word, madam, I beg you. You cannot thank me better than by\naccepting my offer. I confess I have never crossed this forest, but I\nam so much accustomed to the pampas that I have little fear of losing\nmy way. The only difficulty is in the matter of provisions, as I have\nonly supplied myself with enough to carry me on to San Felice.\"\n\n\"As to provisions,\" replied Mrs. Weldon, \"we have enough and to spare;\nand we shall be more than willing to share everything with you.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" answered Harris; \"then there can be no reason why we\nshould not start at once.\"\n\nHe was turning away with the intention of fetching his horse, when Dick\nSands detained him. True to his seaman's instincts, the young sailor\nfelt that he should be much more at his ease on the sea-shore than\ntraversing the heart of an unknown forest.\n\n\"Pardon me, Mr. Harris,\" he began, \"but instead of taking so long a\njourney across the desert of Atacama, would it not be far better for us\nto follow the coast either northwards or southwards, until we reach the\nnearest seaport?\"\n\nA frown passed over Harris's countenance.\n\n\"I know very little about the coast,\" he answered; \"but I know enough\nto assure you that there is no town to the north within 300 or 400\nmiles.\"\n\n\"Then why should we not go south?\" persisted Dick.\n\n\"You would then have to travel to Chili, which is almost as far; and,\nunder your circumstances, I should not advise you to skirt the pampas\nof the Argentine Republic. For my own part, I could not accompany you.\"\n\n\"But do not the vessels which ply between Chili and Peru come within\nsight of this coast?\" interposed Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"No, madam; they keep out so far to sea that there would not be the\nfaintest chance of your hailing one.\"\n\n\"You seem to have another question to ask Mr. Harris,\" Mrs. Weldon\ncontinued, addressing Dick, who still looked rather doubtful.\n\nDick replied that he was about to inquire at what port he would be\nlikely to find a ship to convey their party to San Francisco.\n\n\"That I really cannot tell you, my young friend,\" rejoined Harris; \"I\ncan only repeat my promise that we will furnish you with the means of\nconveyance from San Felice to Atacama, where no doubt you will obtain\nall the information you require.\"\n\n\"I hope you will not think that Dick is insensible to your kindness,\nMr. Harris,\" said Mrs. Weldon, apologetically.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" promptly observed Dick; \"I fully appreciate it; I\nonly wish we had been cast ashore upon a spot where we should have had\nno need to intrude upon his generosity.\"\n\n\"I assure you, madam, it gives me unbounded pleasure to serve you in\nany way,\" said Harris; \"it is, as I have told you, not often that I\ncome in contact with any of my own countrymen.\"\n\n\"Then we accept your offer as frankly as it is made,\" replied the lady,\nadding; \"but I cannot consent to deprive you of your horse. I am a very\ngood walker.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Harris, with a bow, \"and consequently I intend you and\nyour little son to ride. I am used to long tramps through the pampas.\nBesides, it is not at all unlikely that we shall come across some of\nthe workpeople belonging to the hacienda; if so, they will be able to\ngive us a mount.\"\n\nConvinced that it would only be thwarting Mrs. Weldon's wishes to throw\nany further impediment in the way, Dick Sands suppressed his desire to\nraise fresh obstacles, and simply asked how soon they ought to start.\n\n\"This very day, at once,\" said Harris quickly.\n\n\"So soon?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"Yes. The rainy season begins in April, and the sooner we are at San\nFelice the better. The way through the forest is the safest as well as\nthe shortest, for we shall be less likely to meet any of the nomad\nIndians, who are notorious robbers.\"\n\nWithout making any direct reply, Dick proceeded to instruct the negroes\nto choose such of the provisions as were most easy of transport, and to\nmake them up into packages, that every one might carry a due share.\nHercules with his usual good nature professed himself willing to carry\nthe entire load; a proposal, however, to which Dick would not listen\nfor a moment.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow, Hercules\" said Harris, scrutinizing the giant\nwith the eye of a connoisseur; \"you would be worth something in the\nAfrican market.\"\n\n\"Those who want me now must catch me first,\" retorted Hercules, with a\ngrin.\n\nThe services of all hands were enlisted, and in a comparatively short\ntime sufficient food was packed up to supply the party for about ten\ndays' march.\n\n\"You must allow us to show you what hospitality is in our power,\" said\nMrs. Weldon, addressing her new acquaintance; \"our breakfast will be\nready in a quarter of an hour, and we shall be happy if you will join\nus.\"\n\n\"It will give me much pleasure,\" answered Harris, gaily; \"I will employ\nthe interval in fetching my horse, who has breakfasted already.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you,\" said Dick.\n\n\"By all means, my young friend; come with me, and I will show you the\nlower part of the river.\"\n\nWhile they were gone, Hercules was sent in search of Cousin Benedict,\nwho was wandering on the top of the cliff in quest of some wonderful\ninsect, which, of course, was not to be found. Without asking his\npermission, Hercules unceremoniously brought him back to Mrs. Weldon,\nwho explained how they were about to start upon a ten days' march into\nthe interior of the country. The entomologist was quite satisfied with\nthe arrangement, and declared himself ready for a march across the\nentire continent, as long as he was free to be adding to his collection\non the way.\n\nThus assured of her cousin's acquiescence in her plans; Mrs. Weldon\nproceeded to prepare such a substantial meal as she hoped would\ninvigorate them all for the approaching journey.\n\nHarris and Dick Sands, meantime, had turned the corner of the cliff,\nand walked about 300 paces along the shore until they came to a tree to\nwhich a horse was tethered. The creature neighed as it recognized its\nmaster. It was a strong-built animal, of a kind that Dick had not seen\nbefore, although its long neck and crupper, short loins, flat shoulders\nand arched forehead indicated that it was of Arabian breed.\n\n[Illustration: They came to a tree to which a horse was tethered.]\n\n\"Plenty of strength here,\" Harris said, as after unfastening the horse,\nhe took it by the bridle and began to lead it along the shore.\n\nDick made no reply; he was casting a hasty glance at the forest which\nenclosed them on either hand; it was an unattractive sight, but he\nobserved nothing to give him any particular ground for uneasiness.\n\nTurning round, he said abruptly,--\n\n\"Did you meet a Portuguese last night, named Negoro?\"\n\n\"Negoro? who is Negoro?\" asked Harris, in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"He was our ship's cook; but he has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Drowned, probably,\" said Harris indifferently.\n\n\"No, he was not drowned; he was with us during the evening, but left\nafterwards; I thought perhaps you might have met him along the\nriver-side, as you came that way.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harris, \"I saw no one; if your cook ventured alone into the\nforest, most likely he has lost his way; it is possible we may pick him\nup upon our road.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the grotto, they found breakfast duly prepared.\nLike the supper of the previous evening it consisted mainly of corned\nbeef and biscuit. Harris did ample justice to the repast.\n\n\"There is no fear of our starving as we go,\" he observed to Mrs.\nWeldon; \"but I can hardly say so much for the unfortunate Portuguese,\nyour cook, of whom my young friend here has been speaking.\"\n\n\"Ah! has Dick been telling you about Negoro?\" Mrs. Weldon said.\n\nDick explained that he had been inquiring whether Mr. Harris had\nhappened to meet him in the direction he had come.\n\n\"I saw nothing of him,\" Harris repeated; \"and as he has deserted you,\nyou need not give yourselves any concern about him.\" And apparently\nglad to turn the subject, he said, \"Now, madam, I am at your service;\nshall we start at once?\"\n\nIt was agreed that there was no cause for delay. Each one took up the\npackage that had been assigned him. Mrs. Weldon, with Hercules' help,\nmounted the horse, and Jack, with his miniature gun slung across his\nshoulder, was placed astride in front of her. Without a thought of\nacknowledging the kindness of the good-natured stranger in providing\nhim so enjoyable a ride, the heedless little fellow declared himself\nquite capable of guiding the \"gentleman's horse,\" and when to indulge\nhim the bridle was put into his hand, he looked as proud as though he\nhad been appointed leader of the whole caravan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHROUGH THE FOREST.\n\n\nAlthough there was no obvious cause for apprehension, it cannot be\ndenied that it was with a certain degree of foreboding that Dick Sands\nfirst entered that dense forest, through which for the next ten days\nthey were all to wend their toilsome way.\n\nMrs. Weldon, on the contrary, was full of confidence and hope. A woman\nand a mother, she might have been expected to be conscious of anxiety\nat the peril to which she might be exposing herself and her child; and\ndoubtless she would have been sensible of alarm if her mind had not\nbeen fully satisfied upon two points; first, that the portion of the\npampas they were about to traverse was little infested either by\nnatives or by dangerous beasts; and secondly, that she was under the\nprotection of a guide so trustworthy as she believed Harris to be.\n\nThe entrance to the forest was hardly more than three hundred paces up\nthe river. An order of march had been arranged which was to be observed\nas closely as possible throughout the journey. At the head of the troop\nwere Harris and Dick Sands, one armed with his long gun, the other with\nhis Remington; next came Bat and Austin, each carrying a gun and a\ncutlass, then Mrs. Weldon and Jack, on horseback, closely followed by\nTom and old Nan, while Act\u00c3\u00a6on with the fourth Remington, and Hercules\nwith a huge hatchet in his waist-belt, brought up the rear. Dingo had\nno especial place in the procession, but wandered to and fro at his\npleasure. Ever since he had been cast ashore Dick had noticed a\nremarkable change in the dog's behaviour; the animal was in a constant\nstate of agitation, always apparently on the search for some lost\nscent, and repeatedly giving vent to a low growl, which seemed to\nproceed from grief rather than from rage.\n\nAs for Cousin Benedict, his movements were permitted to be nearly as\nerratic as Dingo's; nothing but a leading-string could possibly have\nkept him in the ranks. With his tin box under his arm, and his\nbutterfly net in his hand, and his huge magnifying-glass suspended from\nhis neck, he would be sometimes far ahead, sometimes a long way behind,\nand at the risk of being attacked by some venomous snake, would make\nfrantic dashes into the tall grass whenever he espied some attractive\northoptera or other insect which he thought might be honoured by a\nplace in his collection.\n\nIn one hour after starting Mrs. Weldon had called to him a dozen times\nwithout the slightest effect. At last she told him seriously that if he\nwould not give up chasing the insects at a distance, she should be\nobliged to take possession of his tin box.\n\n\"Take away my box!\" he cried, with as much horror as if she had\nthreatened to tear out his vitals.\n\n\"Yes, your box and your net too!\"\n\n\"My box and my net! but surely not my spectacles!\" almost shrieked the\nexcited entomologist.\n\n\"Yes, and your spectacles as well!\" added Mrs. Weldon mercilessly; \"I\nam glad you have reminded me of another means of reducing you to\nobedience!\"\n\nThe triple penalty of which he was thus warned had the effect of\nkeeping him from wandering away for the best part of the next hour, but\nhe was soon once more missing from the ranks; he was manifestly\nincorrigible; the deprivation of box, net, and spectacles would, it was\nacknowledged, be utterly without avail to prevent him from rambling.\nAccordingly it was thought better to let him have his own way,\nespecially as Hercules volunteered to keep his eye upon him, and to\nendeavour to guard the worthy naturalist as carefully as he would\nhimself protect some precious specimen of a lepidoptera. Further\nanxiety on his account was thus put to rest.\n\n[Illustration: The way across the forest could scarcely be called a\npath.]\n\nIn spite of Harris's confident assertion that they were little likely\nto be molested by any of the nomad Indians, the whole company rejoiced\nin feeling that they were well armed, and they resolved to keep in a\ncompact body. The way across the forest could scarcely be called a\npath; it was, in fact, little more than the track of animals, and\nprogress along it was necessarily very slow; indeed it seemed\nimpossible, at the rate they started, to accomplish more than five or\nsix miles in the course of twelve hours.\n\nThe weather was beautifully fine; the sun ascended nearly to the\nzenith, and its rays, descending almost perpendicularly, caused a\ndegree of heat which, as Harris pointed out, would have been\nunendurable upon the open plain, but was here pleasantly tempered by\nthe shelter of the foliage.\n\nMost of the trees were quite strange to them. To an experienced eye\nthey were such as were remarkable more for their character then for\ntheir size. Here, on one side, was the bauhinia, or mountain ebony;\nthere, on the other, the molompi or pterocarpus, its trunk exuding\nlarge quantities of resin, and of which the strong light wood makes\nexcellent oars or paddles; further on were fustics heavily charged with\ncolouring matter, and guaiacums, twelve feet in diameter, surpassing\nthe ordinary kind in magnitude, yet far inferior in quality.\n\nDick Sands kept perpetually asking Harris to tell him the names of all\nthese trees and plants.\n\n\"Have you never been on the coast of South America before?\" replied\nHarris, without giving the explicit information that was sought.\n\n\"Never,\" said Dick; \"never before. Nor do I recollect ever having seen\nany one who has.\"\n\n\"But surely you have explored the coasts of Columbia or Patagonia,\"\nHarris continued.\n\nDick avowed that he had never had the chance.\n\n\"But has Mrs. Weldon never visited these parts? Our countrymen, I know,\nare great travellers.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Mrs. Weldon; \"my husband's business called him\noccasionally to New Zealand, but I have accompanied him nowhere else.\nWith this part of Lower Bolivia we are totally unacquainted.\"\n\n\"Then, madam, I can only assure you that you will see a most remarkable\ncountry, in every way a very striking contrast to the regions of Peru,\nBrazil, and the Argentine republic. Its animal and vegetable products\nwould fill a naturalist with unbounded wonder. May I not declare it a\nlucky chance that has brought you here?\"\n\n\"Do not say chance, Mr. Harris, if you please.\"\n\n\"Well, then, madam; providence, if you prefer it,\" said Harris, with\nthe air of a man incapable of recognizing the distinction.\n\nAfter finding that there was no one amongst them who was acquainted in\nany way with the country through which they were travelling, Harris\nseemed to exhibit an evident pleasure in pointing out and describing by\nname the various wonders of the forest. Had Cousin Benedict's\nattainments included a knowledge of botany he would have found himself\nin a fine field for researches, and might perchance have discovered\nnovelties to which his own name could be appended in the catalogues of\nscience. But he was no botanist; in fact, as a rule, he held all\nblossoms in aversion, on the ground that they entrapped insects into\ntheir coroll\u00c3\u00a6, and poisoned them sometimes with venomous juices. New\nand rare insects, however, seemed hereabouts to be wanting.\n\nOccasionally the soil became marshy, and they all had to wend their way\nover a perfect network of tiny rivulets that were affluents of the\nriver from which they had started. Sometimes these rivulets were so\nwide that they could not be passed without a long search for some spot\nwhere they could be forded; their banks were all very damp, and in many\nplaces abounded with a kind of reed, which Harris called by its proper\nname of papyrus.\n\nAs soon as the marshy district had been passed, the forest resumed its\noriginal aspect, the footway becoming narrow as ever. Harris pointed\nout some very fine ebony-trees, larger than the common sort, and\nyielding a wood darker and more durable than what is ordinarily seen in\nthe market. There were also more mango-trees than might have been\nexpected at this distance from the sea; a beautiful white lichen\nenveloped their trunks like a fur; but in spite of their luxuriant\nfoliage and delicious fruit, Harris said that there was not a native\nwho would venture to propagate the species, as the superstition of the\ncountry is that \"whoever plants a mango, dies!\"\n\n[Illustration: Occasionally the soil became marshy.]\n\nAt noon a halt was made for the purpose of rest and refreshment. During\nthe afternoon they arrived at some gently rising ground, not the first\nslopes of hills, but an insulated plateau which appeared to unite\nmountains and plains. Notwithstanding that the trees were far less\ncrowded and more inclined to grow in detached groups, the numbers of\nherbaceous plants with which the soil was covered rendered progress no\nless difficult than it was before. The general aspect of the scene was\nnot unlike an East Indian jungle. Less luxuriant indeed than in the\nlower valley of the river, the vegetation was far more abundant than\nthat of the temperate zones either of the Old or New continents. Indigo\ngrew in great profusion, and, according to Harris's representation, was\nthe most encroaching plant in the whole country; no sooner, he said,\nwas a field left untilled, than it was overrun by this parasite, which\nsprang up with the rank growth of thistles or nettles.\n\nOne tree which might have been expected to be common in this part of\nthe continent seemed entirely wanting. This was the caoutchouc. Of the\nvarious trees from which India-rubber is procured, such as the Ficus\nprinoides, the Castilioa elastica, the Cecropia peltata, the Callophora\nutilis, the Cameraria latifolia, and especially the Siphonia elastica,\nall of which abound in the provinces of South America, not a single\nspecimen was to be seen. Dick had promised to show Jack an\nIndia-rubber-tree, and the child, who had conjured up visions of\nsqueaking dolls, balls, and other toys growing upon its branches, was\nloud and constant in his expressions of disappointment.\n\n\"Never mind, my little man,\" said Harris; \"have patience, and you shall\nsee hundreds of India-rubber-trees when you get to the hacienda.\"\n\n\"And will they be nice and elastic?\" asked Jack, whose ideas upon the\nsubject were of the vaguest order.\n\n\"Oh, yes, they will stretch as long as you like,\" Harris answered,\nlaughing. \"But here is something to amuse you,\" he added, and as he\nspoke, he gathered a fruit that looked as tempting as a peach.\n\n\"You are quite sure that it is safe to give it him?\" said Mrs. Weldon\nanxiously.\n\n\"To satisfy you, madam, I will eat one first myself.\"\n\nThe example he set was soon followed by all the rest. The fruit was a\nmango; that which had been so opportunely discovered was of the sort\nthat ripens in March or April; there is a later kind which ripens in\nSeptember. With his mouth full of juice, Jack pronounced that it was\nvery nice, but did not seem to be altogether diverted from his sense of\ndisappointment at not coming to an India-rubber-tree. Evidently the\nlittle man thought himself rather injured.\n\n\"And Dick promised me some humming-birds too!\" he murmured.\n\n\"Plenty of humming-birds for you, when you get to the farm; lots of\nthem where my brother lives,\" said Harris.\n\nAnd to say the truth, there was nothing extravagant in the way the\nchild's anticipations had been raised, for in Bolivia humming-birds are\nfound in great abundance. The Indians, who weave their plumage into all\nkinds of artistic designs, have bestowed the most poetical epithets\nupon these gems of the feathered race. They call them \"rays of the\nsun,\" and \"tresses of the day-star;\" at one time they will describe\nthem as \"king of flowers,\" at another as \"blossoms of heaven kissing\nblossoms of earth,\" or as \"the jewel that reflects the sunbeam.\" In\nfact their imagination seems to have shaped a suitable distinction for\nalmost every one of the 150 known species of this dazzling little\nbeauty.\n\nBut however numerous humming-birds might be expected to be in the\nBolivian forest, they proved scarce enough at present, and Jack had to\ncontent himself with Harris's representations that they did not like\nsolitude, but would be found plentifully at San Felice, where they\nwould be heard all day long humming like a spinning-wheel. Already Jack\nsaid he longed to be there, a wish that was so unanimously echoed by\nall the rest, that they resolved that no stoppage should be allowed\nbeyond what was absolutely indispensable.\n\nAfter a time the forest began to alter its aspect. The trees were even\nless crowded, opening now and then into wide glades. The soil, cropping\nup above its carpet of verdure, exhibited veins of rose granite and\nsyenite, like plates of lapis lazuli; on some of the higher ground, the\nfleshy tubers of the sarsaparilla plant, growing in a hopeless\nentanglement, made progress a matter of still greater difficulty than\nin the narrow tracks of the dense forest.\n\nAt sunset the travellers found that they had accomplished about eight\nmiles from their starting-point. They could not prognosticate what\nhardships might be in store for them on future days, but it was certain\nthat the experiences of the first day had been neither eventful nor\nvery fatiguing. It was now unanimously agreed that they should make a\nhalt for the night, and as little was to be apprehended from the\nattacks either of man or beast, it was considered unnecessary to form\nanything like a regular encampment. One man on guard, to be relieved\nevery few hours, was presumed to be sufficient. Admirable shelter was\noffered by an enormous mango, the spreading foliage of which formed a\nkind of natural verandah, sweeping the ground so thoroughly that any\none who chose could find sleeping-quarters in its very branches.\n\nSimultaneously with the halting of the party there was heard a\ndeafening tumult in the upper boughs. The mango was the roosting place\nof a colony of grey parrots, a noisy, quarrelsome, and rapacious race,\nof whose true characteristics the specimens seen in confinement in\nEurope give no true conception. Their screeching and chattering were\nsuch a nuisance that Dick Sands wanted to fire a shot into the middle\nof them, but Harris seriously dissuaded him, urging that the report of\nfirearms would only serve to reveal their own presence, whilst their\ngreatest safety lay in perfect silence.\n\nSupper was prepared. There was little need of cooking. The meal, as\nbefore, consisted of preserved meat and biscuit. Fresh water, which\nthey flavoured with a few drops of rum, was obtained from an adjacent\nstream which trickled through the grass. By way of dessert they had an\nabundance of ripe mangoes, and the only drawback to their general\nenjoyment was the discordant outcry which the parrots kept up, as it\nwere in protest against the invasion of what they held to be their own\nrightful domain.\n\nIt was nearly dark when supper was ended. The evening shade crept\nslowly upwards to the tops of the trees, which soon stood out in sharp\nrelief against the lighter background of the sky, while the stars, one\nby one, began to peep. The wind dropped, and ceased to murmur through\nthe foliage; to the general relief, the parrots desisted from their\nclatter; and as Nature hushed herself to rest, she seemed to be\ninviting all her children to follow her example.\n\n\"Had we not better light a good large fire?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"By no means,\" said Harris; \"the nights are not cold, and under this\nwide-spreading mango the ground is not likely to be damp. Besides, as I\nhave told you before, our best security consists in our taking care to\nattract no attention whatever from without.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon interposed,--\n\n\"It may be true enough that we have nothing to dread from the Indians,\nbut is it certain that there are no dangerous quadrupeds against which\nwe are bound to be upon our guard?\"\n\nHarris answered,--\n\n\"I can positively assure you, madam, that there are no animals here but\nsuch as would be infinitely more afraid of you than you would be of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Are there any woods without wild beasts?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"All woods are not alike, my boy,\" replied Harris; \"this wood is a\ngreat park. As the Indians say, 'Es como el Pariso;' it is like\nParadise.\"\n\nJack persisted,--\n\n\"There must be snakes, and lions, and tigers.\"\n\n\"Ask your mamma, my boy,\" said Harris, \"whether she ever heard of lions\nand tigers in America?\"\n\nMrs. Weldon was endeavouring to put her little boy at his ease on this\npoint, when Cousin Benedict interposed, saying that although there were\nno lions or tigers, there were plenty of jaguars and panthers in the\nNew World.\n\n\"And won't they kill us?\" demanded Jack eagerly, his apprehensions once\nmore aroused.\n\n\"Kill you?\" laughed Harris; \"why, your friend Hercules here could\nstrangle them, two at a time, one in each hand!\"\n\n\"But, please, don't let the panthers come near me!\" pleaded Jack,\nevidently alarmed.\n\n\"No, no, Master Jack, they shall not come near you. I will give them a\ngood grip first,\" and the giant displayed his two rows of huge white\nteeth.\n\nDick Sands proposed that it should be the four younger negroes who\nshould be assigned the task of keeping watch during the night, in\nattendance upon himself; but Act\u00c3\u00a6on insisted so strongly upon the\nnecessity of Dick's having his full share of rest, that the others were\nsoon brought to the same conviction, and Dick was obliged to yield.\n\nJack valiantly announced his intention of taking one watch, but his\nsleepy eyelids made it only too plain that he did not know the extent\nof his own fatigue.\n\n\"I am sure there are wolves here,\" he said.\n\n\"Only such wolves as Dingo would swallow at a mouthful,\" said Harris.\n\n\"But I am sure there are wolves,\" he insisted, repeating the word\n\"wolves\" again and again, until he tumbled off to sleep against the\nside of old Nan. Mrs. Weldon gave her little son a silent kiss; it was\nher loving \"good night.\"\n\nCousin Benedict was missing. Some little time before, he had slipped\naway in search of \"cocuyos,\" or fire-flies, which he had heard were\ncommon in South America.\n\nThose singular insects emit a bright bluish light from two spots on the\nside of the thorax, and their colours are so brilliant that they are\nused as ornaments for ladies' headdresses. Hoping to secure some\nspecimens for his box, Benedict would have wandered to an unlimited\ndistance; but Hercules, faithful to his undertaking, soon discovered\nhim, and heedless of the naturalist's protestations and vociferations,\npromptly escorted him back to the general rendezvous.\n\nHercules himself was the first to keep watch, but with this exception,\nthe whole party, in another hour, were wrapped in peaceful slumber.\n\n[Illustration: Hercules himself was the first to keep watch.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMISGIVINGS.\n\n\nMost travellers who have passed a night in a South American forest have\nbeen roused from their slumbers by a _matin\u00c3\u00a9e musicale_ more fantastic\nthan melodious, performed by monkeys, as their ordinary greeting of the\ndawn. The yelling, chattering, screeching, howling, all unite to form a\nchorus almost unearthly in its hideousness.\n\nAmongst the various specimens of the numerous family of the quadrumana\nought to be recognized the little marikina; the sagouin, with its\nparti-coloured face; the grey mora, the skin of which is used by the\nIndians for covering their gun-locks; the sapajou, with its singular\ntuft over the forehead, and, most remarkable of all, the guariba\n(_Simia Beelzebul_) with its prehensile tail and diabolical countenance.\n\nAt the first streak of daylight the senior member, as choragus, will\nstart the key-note in a sonorous barytone, the younger monkeys join in\ntenor and alto, and the concert begins. But this morning there was no\nconcert at all. There was nothing of the wonted serenade to break the\nsilence of the forest. The shrill notes resulting from the rapid\nvibration of the hyoid bones of the throat were not to be heard.\nIndians would have been disappointed and perplexed; they are very fond\nof the flesh of the guariba when smoked and dried, and they would\ncertainly have missed the chant of the monkey \"paternosters;\" but Dick\nSands and his companions were unfamiliar with any of these things, and\naccordingly the singular quietude was to them a matter of no surprise.\n\nThey all awoke much refreshed by their night's rest, which there had\nbeen nothing to disturb. Jack was by no means the latest in opening his\neyes, and his first words were addressed to Hercules, asking him\nwhether he had caught a wolf with his teeth. Hercules had to\nacknowledge that he had tasted nothing all night, and declared himself\nquite ready for breakfast. The whole party were unanimous in this\nrespect, and after a brief morning prayer, breakfast was expeditiously\nserved by old Nan. The meal was but a repetition of the last evening's\nsupper, but with their appetites sharpened by the fresh forest air, and\nanxious to fortify themselves for a good day's march, they did not fail\nto do ample justice to their simple fare. Even Cousin Benedict, for\nonce in his life at least, partook of his food as if it were not\nutterly a matter of indifference to him; but he grumbled very much at\nthe restraint to which he considered himself subjected; he could not\nsee the good of coming to such a country as this, if he were to be\nobliged to walk about with his hands in his pockets; and he protested\nthat if Hercules did not leave him alone and permit him to catch\nfire-flies, there would be a bone to pick between them. Hercules did\nnot look very much alarmed at the threat. Mrs. Weldon, however, took\nhim aside, and telling him that she did not wish to deprive the\nenthusiast entirely of his favourite occupation, instructed him to\nallow her cousin as much liberty as possible, provided he did not lose\nsight of him.\n\nThe morning meal was over, and it was only seven o'clock when the\ntravellers were once more on their way towards the east, preserving the\nsame marching-order as on the day before.\n\nThe path was still through luxuriant forest. The vegetable kingdom\nreigned supreme. As the plateau was immediately adjacent to tropical\nlatitudes, the sun's rays during the summer months descended\nperpendicularly upon the virgin soil, and the vast amount of heat thus\nobtained combined with the abundant moisture retained in the subsoil,\ncaused vegetation to assume a character which was truly magnificent.\n\nDick Sands could not overcome a certain sense of mystification. Here\nthey were, as Harris told them, in the region of the pampas, a word\nwhich he knew in the Quichna dialect signifies \"a plain;\" but he had\nalways read that these plains were characterized by a deficiency alike\nof water, of trees, and rocks; he had always understood that during the\nrainy season, thistles spring up in great abundance and grow until they\nform thickets that are well-nigh impenetrable; he had imagined that the\nfew dwarf trees and prickly shrubs that exist during the summer only\nstamp the general scene with an aspect of yet more thorough bareness\nand desolation. But how different was everything to all this! The\nforest never ceased to stretch away interminably to the horizon. There\nwere no tokens of the rough nakedness that he had expected. Dick seemed\nto be driven to the conclusion that Harris was right in describing this\nplateau of Atacama, which he had for his part most firmly believed to\nbe a vast desert between the Andes and the Pacific, as a region that\nwas quite exceptional in its natural features.\n\nIt was not in Dick's character to keep his reflections to himself. In\nthe course of the morning he expressed his extreme surprise at finding\nthe pampas answer so little to his preconceived ideas.\n\n\"Have I not understood correctly,\" he said, \"that the pampas is similar\nto the North American savannahs, only less marshy?\"\n\nHarris replied that such was indeed a correct description of the pampas\nof Rio Colorado, and the Ilanos of Venezuela and the Orinoco.\n\n\"But,\" he continued, \"I own I am as much astonished as yourself at the\ncharacter of this region; I have never crossed the plateau before, and\nI must confess it is altogether different to what you find beyond the\nAndes towards the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that we are going to cross the Andes?\" said Dick, in\nsudden alarm.\n\nHarris smiled.\n\n\"No, no, indeed. With our limited means of transport such an\nundertaking would have been rash in the extreme. We had better have\nkept to the coast for ever rather than incur such a risk. Our\ndestination, San Felice, is on this side of the range, and in order to\nreach it, we shall not have to leave the plateau, of which the greatest\nelevation is but little over 1500 feet.\"\n\n\"And you say,\" Dick persisted, \"that you have really no fear of losing\nyour way in a forest such as this, a forest into which you have never\nset foot before?\"\n\n\"No fear whatever,\" Harris answered; \"so accustomed am I to travelling\nof this kind, that I can steer my way by a thousand signs revealing\nthemselves in the growth of the trees, and in the composition of the\nsoil, which would never present themselves to your notice. I assure you\nthat I anticipate no difficulties.\"\n\nThis conversation was not heard by any of the rest of the party. Harris\nseemed to speak as frankly as he did fearlessly, and Dick felt that\nthere might be, after all, no just grounds for any of his own\nmisgivings.\n\nFive days passed by, and the 12th of April arrived without any special\nincident. Nine miles had been the average distance accomplished in a\nday; regular periods of rest had been taken, and, except that Jack's\nspirits had somewhat flagged, the fatigue did not seem to have\ninterfered with the general good health of the travellers.\n\nFirst disappointed of his India-rubber-tree, and then of his humming\nbirds, Jack had inquired about the beautiful parrots which he had been\nled to expect he should see in this wonderful forest. Where were the\nbright green macaws? where were the gaudy aras with their bare white\ncheeks and pointed tails, which seem never to light upon the ground?\nand where, too, were all the brilliant parroquets, with their feathered\nfaces, and indeed the whole variety of those forest chatterers of which\nthe Indians affirm that they speak the language of nations long extinct?\n\nIt is true that there was no lack of the common grey parrots with\ncrimson tails, but these were no novelty; Jack had seen plenty of them\nbefore, for owing to their reputation of being the most clever in\nmimickry of the Psittacid\u00c3\u00a6, they have been domesticated everywhere in\nboth the Old and New worlds.\n\n[Illustration: \"Don't Fire!\"]\n\nBut Jack's dissatisfaction was nothing compared to Cousin Benedict's.\nIn spite of being allowed to wander away from the rank, he had failed\nto discover a single insect which was worth the pursuit; not even a\nfire-fly danced at night; nature seemed to be mocking him, and his\nill-humour increased accordingly.\n\nIn this way the journey was continued for four days longer, and on the\n16th it was estimated that they must have travelled between eighty and\nninety miles north-eastwards from the coast. Harris positively asserted\nthat they could not be much more than twenty miles from San Felice, and\nthat by pushing forwards they might expect in eight-and-forty hours to\nfind themselves lodged in comfortable quarters.\n\nBut although they had thus succeeded in traversing this vast\ntable-land, they had not seen one human inhabitant. Dick was more than\never perplexed, and it was a subject of bitter regret to him that they\nhad not stranded upon some more frequented part of the shore, near some\nvillage or plantation where Mrs. Weldon might long since have found a\nsuitable refuge.\n\nDeserted, however, as the country apparently was by man, it had\nlatterly shown itself much more abundantly tenanted by animals. Many a\ntime a long, plaintive cry was heard, which Harris attributed to the\ntardigrades or sloths often found in wooded districts, and known by the\nname of \"ais;\" and in the middle of the dinner-halt on this day, a loud\nhissing suddenly broke upon the air which made Mrs. Weldon start to her\nfeet in alarm.\n\n\"A serpent!\" cried Dick, catching up his loaded gun.\n\nThe negroes, following Dick's example, were in a moment on the alert.\n\n\"Don't fire!\" cried Harris.\n\nThere was indeed nothing improbable in the supposition that a \"sucuru,\"\na species of boa, sometimes measuring forty feet in length, had just\nmoved itself in the long grass at their side, but Harris affirmed that\nthe \"sucuru\" never hisses, and declared that the noise had really come\nfrom animals of an entirely inoffensive character.\n\n\"What animals?\" asked Dick, always eager for information, which it must\nbe granted Harris seemed always equally anxious to give.\n\n\"Antelopes,\" replied Harris; \"but, hush! not a sound, or you will\nfrighten them away.\"\n\n\"Antelopes!\" cried Dick; \"I must see them; I must get close to them.\"\n\n\"More easily said than done,\" answered Harris, shaking his head; but\nDick was not to be diverted from his purpose, and, gun in hand, crept\ninto the grass. He had not advanced many yards before a herd of about a\ndozen gazelles, graceful in body, with short, pointed horns, dashed\npast him like a glowing cloud, and disappeared in the underwood without\ngiving him time to take a shot.\n\n\"I told you beforehand what you would have to expect,\" said Harris, as\nDick, with a considerable sense of disappointment, returned to the\nparty.\n\nImpossible, however, as it had been fairly to scrutinize the antelopes,\nsuch was hardly the case with another herd of animals, the\nidentification of which led to a somewhat singular discussion between\nHarris and the rest.\n\nAbout four o'clock on the afternoon of the same day, the travellers\nwere halting for a few moments near an opening in the forest, when\nthree or four large animals emerged from a thicket about a hundred\npaces ahead, and scampered off at full speed. In spite of what Harris\nhad urged, Dick put his gun to his shoulder, and was on the very point\nof firing, when Harris knocked the rifle quickly aside.\n\n\"They were giraffes!\" shouted Dick.\n\nThe announcement awakened the curiosity of Jack, who quickly scrambled\nto his feet upon the saddle on which he was lounging.\n\n\"My dear Dick,\" said Mrs. Weldon, \"there are no giraffes in America!\"\n\n[Illustration: A herd of gazelles dashed past him like a glowing cloud.]\n\n\"Certainly not,\" cried Harris; \"they were not giraffes, they were\nostriches which you saw!\"\n\n\"Ostriches with four legs! that will never do! what do you say. Mrs.\nWeldon?\"\n\nMrs. Weldon replied that she had certainly taken the animals for\nquadrupeds, and all the negroes were under the same impression.\n\nLaughing heartily, Harris said it was far from an uncommon thing for an\ninexperienced eye to mistake a large ostrich for a small giraffe; the\nshape of both was so similar, that it often quite escaped observation\nas to whether the long necks terminated in a beak or a muzzle; besides,\nwhat need of discussion could there be when the fact was established\nthat giraffes are unknown in the New World? The reasoning was plausible\nenough, and Mrs Weldon and the negroes were soon convinced. But Dick\nwas far from satisfied.\n\n\"I did not know that there was an American ostrich!\" he again objected.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Harris promptly, \"there is a species called the\nnandu, which is very well known here; we shall probably see some more\nof them.\"\n\nThe statement was correct; the nandu is common in the plains of South\nAmerica, and is distinguished from the African ostrich by having three\ntoes, all furnished with claws. It is a fine bird, sometimes exceeding\nsix feet in height; it has a short beak, and its wings are furnished\nwith blue-grey plumes. Harris appeared well acquainted with the bird,\nand proceeded to give a very precise account of its habits. In\nconcluding his remarks, he again pressed upon Dick his most urgent\nrequest that he should abstain from firing upon any animal whatever. It\nwas of the utmost consequence.\n\nDick made no reply. He was silent and thoughtful. Grave doubts had\narisen in his mind, and he could neither explain nor dispel them.\n\nWhen the march was resumed on the following day, Harris asserted his\nconviction that another four-and-twenty hours would bring them to the\nhacienda.\n\n\"And there, madam,\" he said, addressing Mrs. Weldon, \"we can offer you\nevery essential comfort, though you may not find the luxuries of your\nown home in San Francisco.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon repeated her expression of gratitude for the proffered\nhospitality, owning that she should now be exceedingly glad to reach\nthe farm, as she was anxious about her little son, who appeared to be\nthreatened with the symptoms of incipient fever.\n\nHarris could not deny that although the climate was usually very\nhealthy, it nevertheless did occasionally produce a kind of\nintermittent fever during March and April.\n\n\"But nature has provided the proper remedy,\" said Dick; and perceiving\nthat Harris did not comprehend his meaning, he continued, \"Are we not\nin the region of the quinquinas, the bark of which is notoriously the\nmedicine with which attacks of fever are usually treated? for my part,\nI am amazed that we have not seen numbers of them already.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, yes; I know what you mean,\" answered Harris, after a moment's\nhesitation; \"they are trees, however, not always easy to find; they\nrarely grow in groups, and in spite of their large leaves and fragrant\nred blossom, the Indians themselves often have a difficulty in\nrecognizing them; the feature that distinguishes them most is their\nevergreen foliage.\"\n\nAt Mrs. Weldon's request, Harris promised to point out the tree if he\nshould see one, but added that when she reached the hacienda, she would\nbe able to obtain some sulphate of quinine, which was much more\nefficacious than the unprepared bark.[1]\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This bark was formerly, reduced to powder, known as\n\"Pulvis Jesuiticus,\" because in the year 1649 the Jesuits in Rome\nimported a large quantity of it from their missionaries in South\nAmerica.]\n\n\nThe day passed without further incident. No rain had fallen at present,\nthough the warm mist that rose from the soil betokened an approaching\nchange of weather; the rainy season was certainly not far distant, but\nto travellers who indulged the expectation of being in a few hours in a\nplace of shelter, this was not a matter of great concern.\n\n[Illustration: A halt was made for the night beneath a grove of lofty\ntrees.]\n\nEvening came, and a halt was made for the night beneath a grove of\nlofty trees. If Harris had not miscalculated, they could hardly be more\nthan about six miles from their destination; so confirmed, however, was\nDick Sands in his strange suspicions, that nothing could induce him to\nrelax any of the usual precautions, and he particularly insisted upon\nthe negroes, turn by turn, keeping up the accustomed watch.\n\nWorn out by fatigue, the little party were glad to lie down, but they\nhad scarcely dropped off to sleep when they were aroused by a sharp cry.\n\n\"Who's that? who's there? what's the matter?\" exclaimed Dick, the first\nto rise to his feet.\n\n\"It is I,\" answered Benedict's voice; \"I am bitten. Something has\nbitten me.\"\n\n\"A snake!\" exclaimed Mrs. Weldon in alarm.\n\n\"No, no, cousin, better than that! it was not a snake; I believe it was\nan orthoptera; I have it all right,\" he shouted triumphantly.\n\n\"Then kill it quickly, sir; and let us go to sleep again in peace,\"\nsaid Harris.\n\n\"Kill it! not for the world! I must have a light, and look at it!\"\n\nDick Sands indulged him, for reasons of his own, in getting a light.\nThe entomologist carefully opened his hand and displayed an insect\nsomewhat smaller than a bee, of a dull colour, streaked with yellow on\nthe under portion of the body. He looked radiant with delight.\n\n\"A diptera!\" he exclaimed, half beside himself with joy, \"a most famous\ndiptera!\"\n\n\"Is it venomous?\" asked Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Not at all to men; it only hurts elephants and buffaloes.\"\n\n\"But tell us its name! what is it?\" cried Dick impetuously.\n\nThe naturalist began to speak in a slow, oracular tone.\n\n\"This insect is here a prodigy; it is an insect totally unknown in this\ncountry,--in America.\"\n\n\"Tell us its name!\" roared Dick.\n\n\"It is a tzetzy, sir, a true tzetzy.\"\n\nDick's heart sank like a stone. He was speechless. He did not, dared\nnot, ask more. Only too well he knew where the tzetzy could alone be\nfound. He did not close his eyes again that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nA TERRIBLE DISCOVERY.\n\n\nThe morning of the 18th dawned, the day on which, according to Harris's\nprediction, the travellers were to be safely housed at San Felice. Mrs.\nWeldon was really much relieved at the prospect, for she was aware that\nher strength must prove inadequate to the strain of a more protracted\njourney. The condition of her little boy, who was alternately flushed\nwith fever, and pale with exhaustion, had begun to cause her great\nanxiety, and unwilling to resign the care of the child even to Nan his\nfaithful nurse, she insisted upon carrying him in her own arms. Twelve\ndays and nights, passed in the open air, had done much to try her\npowers of endurance, and the charge of a sick child in addition would\nsoon break down her strength entirely.\n\nDick Sands, Nan, and the negroes had all borne the march very fairly.\nTheir stock of provisions, though of course considerably diminished,\nwas still far from small. As for Harris, he had shown himself\npre-eminently adapted for forest-life, and capable of bearing any\namount of fatigue. Yet, strange to say, as he approached the end of the\njourney, his manner underwent a remarkable change; instead of\nconversing in his ordinary frank and easy way, he became silent and\npreoccupied, as if engrossed in his own thoughts. Perhaps he had an\ninstinctive consciousness that \"his young friend,\" as he was in the\nhabit of addressing Dick, was entertaining hard suspicions about him.\n\nThe march was resumed. The trees once again ceased to be crowded in\nimpenetrable masses, but stood in clusters at considerable distances\napart. Now, Dick tried to argue with himself, they must be coming to\nthe true pampas, or the man must be designedly misleading them; and yet\nwhat motive could he have?\n\nAlthough during the earlier part of the day there occurred nothing that\ncould be said absolutely to justify Dick's increasing uneasiness, two\ncircumstances transpired which did not escape his observation, and\nwhich, he felt, might be significant. The first of these was a sudden\nchange in Dingo's behaviour. The dog, throughout the march, had\nuniformly run along with his nose upon the ground, smelling the grass\nand shrubs, and occasionally uttering a sad low whine; but to-day he\nseemed all agitation; he scampered about with bristling coat, with his\nhead erect, and ever and again burst into one of those furious fits of\nbarking, with which he had formerly been accustomed to greet Negoro's\nappearance upon the deck of the \"Pilgrim.\"\n\nThe idea that flitted across Dick's mind was shared by Tom.\n\n\"Look, Mr. Dick, look at Dingo; he is at his old ways again,\" said he;\n\"it is just as if Negoro....\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Dick to the old man, who continued in a lower voice,--\n\n\"It is just as if Negoro had followed us; do you think it is likely?\"\n\n\"It might perhaps be to his advantage to follow us, if he doesn't know\nthe country; but if he does know the country, why then....\"\n\nDick did not finish his sentence, but whistled to Dingo. The dog\nreluctantly obeyed the call.\n\nAs soon as the dog was at his side, Dick patted him, repeating,--\n\n\"Good dog! good Dingo! where's Negoro?\"\n\nThe sound of Negoro's name had its usual effect; it seemed to irritate\nthe animal exceedingly, and he barked furiously, and apparently wanted\nto dash into the thicket.\n\nHarris had been an interested spectator of the scene, and now\napproached with a peculiar expression on his countenance, and inquired\nwhat they were saying to Dingo.\n\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" replied Tom; \"we were only asking him for news of a\nlost acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Ah, I suppose you mean that Portuguese cook of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom; \"we fancied from Dingo's behaviour, that Negoro\nmust be somewhere close at hand.\"\n\n\"Why don't you send and search the underwood? perhaps the poor wretch\nis in distress.\"\n\n\"No need of that, Mr. Harris; Negoro, I have no doubt, is quite capable\nof taking care of himself.\"\n\n\"Well, just as you please, my young friend,\" said Harris, with an air\nof indifference.\n\nDick turned away; he continued his endeavours to pacify Dingo, and the\nconversation dropped.\n\nThe other thing that had arrested Dick's attention was the behaviour of\nthe horse. If they had been as near the hacienda as Harris described,\nwould not the animal have pricked up its ears, sniffed the air, and\nwith dilated nostril, exhibited some sign of satisfaction, as being\nupon familiar ground?\n\nBut nothing of the kind was to be observed; the horse plodded along as\nunconcernedly as if a stable were as far away as ever.\n\nEven Mrs. Weldon was not so engrossed with her child, but what she was\nfain to express her wonder at the deserted aspect of the country. No\ntrace of a farm-labourer was anywhere to be seen! She cast her eye at\nHarris, who was in his usual place in front, and observing how he was\nlooking first to the left, and then to the right, with the air of a man\nwho was uncertain of his path, she asked herself whether it was\npossible their guide might have lost his way. She dared not entertain\nthe idea, and averted her eyes, that she might not be harassed by his\nmovements.\n\nAfter crossing an open plain about a mile in width, the travellers once\nagain entered the forest, which resumed something of the same denseness\nthat had characterized it farther to the west. In the course of the\nafternoon, they came to a spot which was marked very distinctly by the\nvestiges of some enormous animals, which must have passed quite\nrecently. As Dick looked carefully about him, he observed that the\nbranches were all torn off or broken to a considerable height, and that\nthe foot-tracks in the trampled grass were much too large to be those\neither of jaguars or panthers. Even if it were possible that the prints\non the ground had been made by ais or other taidigrades, this would\nfail to account in the least for the trees being broken to such a\nheight. Elephants alone were capable of working such destruction in the\nunderwood, but elephants were unknown in America. Dick was puzzled, but\ncontrolled himself so that he would not apply to Harris for any\nenlightenment; his intuition made him aware that a man who had once\ntried to make him believe that giraffes were ostriches, would not\nhesitate a second time to impose upon his credulity.\n\nMore than ever was Dick becoming convinced that Harris was a traitor,\nand he was secretly prompted to tax him with his treachery. Still he\nwas obliged to own that he could not assign any motive for the man\nacting in such a manner with the survivors of the \"Pilgrim,\" and\nconsequently hesitated before he actually condemned him for conduct so\nbase and heartless. What could be done? he repeatedly asked himself. On\nboard ship the boy captain might perchance have been able to devise\nsome plan for the safety of those so strangely committed to his charge,\nbut here on an unknown shore, he could only suffer from the burden of\nthis responsibility the more, because he was so utterly powerless to\nact.\n\nHe made up his mind on one point. He determined not to alarm the poor\nanxious mother a moment before he was actually compelled. It was his\ncarrying out this determination that explained why on subsequently\narriving at a considerable stream, where he saw some huge heads,\nswollen muzzles, long tusks and unwieldy bodies rising from amidst the\nrank wet grass, he uttered no word and gave no gesture of surprise; but\nonly too well he knew, at a glance, that he must be looking at a herd\nof hippopotamuses.\n\n[Illustration: \"Look here! here are hands, men's hands.\"]\n\nIt was a weary march that day; a general feeling of depression spread\ninvoluntarily from one to another; hardly conscious to herself of her\nweariness, Mrs. Weldon was exhibiting manifest symptoms of lassitude;\nand it was only Dick's moral energy and sense of duty that kept him\nfrom succumbing to the prevailing dejection.\n\nAbout four o'clock, Tom noticed something lying in the grass, and\nstooping down he picked up a kind of knife; it was of peculiar shape,\nbeing very wide and flat in the blade, while its handle, which was of\nivory, was ornamented with a good deal of clumsy carving. He carried it\nat once to Dick, who, when he had scrutinized it, held it up to Harris,\nwith the remark,--\n\n\"There must be natives not far off.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my young friend; the hacienda must be a very few miles\naway,--but yet, but yet....\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"You don't mean that you are not sure of your way,\" said Dick sharply.\n\n\"Not exactly that,\" replied Harris; \"yet in taking this short cut\nacross the forest, I am inclined to think I am a mile or so out of the\nway. Perhaps I had better walk on a little way, and look about me.\"\n\n\"No; you do not leave us here,\" cried Dick firmly.\n\n\"Not against your will; but remember, I do not undertake to guide you\nin the dark.\"\n\n\"We must spare you the necessity for that. I can answer for it that\nMrs. Weldon will raise no objection to spending another night in the\nopen air. We can start off to-morrow morning as early as we like, and\nif the distance be only what you represent, a few hours will easily\naccomplish it.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" answered Harris with cold civility.\n\nJust then, Dingo again burst out into a vehement fit of barking, and it\nrequired no small amount of coaxing on Dick's part to make him cease\nfrom his noise.\n\nIt was decided that the halt should be made at once. Mrs. Weldon, as it\nhad been anticipated, urged nothing against it, being preoccupied by\nher immediate attentions to Jack, who was lying in her arms, suffering\nfrom a decided attack of fever. The shelter of a large thicket had just\nbeen selected by Dick as a suitable resting-place for the night, when\nTom, who was assisting in the necessary preparations, suddenly gave a\ncry of horror.\n\n\"What is it, Tom?\" asked Dick very calmly.\n\n\"Look! look at these trees! they are spattered with blood! and look\nhere! here are hands, men's hands, cut off and lying on the ground!\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Dick, and in an instant was at his side.\n\nHis presence of mind did not fail him; he whispered,--\n\n\"Hush! Tom! hush! not a word!\"\n\nBut it was with a shudder that ran through his veins that he witnessed\nfor himself the mutilated fragments of several human bodies, and saw,\nlying beside them, some broken forks, and some bits of iron chain.\n\nThe sight of the gory remains made Dingo bark ferociously, and Dick,\nwho was most anxious that Mrs. Weldon's attention should not be called\nto the discovery, had the greatest difficulty in driving him back; but\nfortunately the lady's mind was so engrossed with her patient, that she\ndid not observe the commotion. Harris stood aloof; there was no one to\nnotice the change that passed over his countenance, but the expression\nwas almost diabolical in its malignity.\n\nPoor old Tom himself seemed perfectly spell-bound. With his hands\nclenched, his eyes dilated, and his breast heaving with emotion, he\nkept repeating without anything like coherence, the words,--\n\n\"Forks! chains! forks! ... long ago ... remember ... too well ...\nchains!\"\n\n\"For Mrs. Weldon's sake, Tom, hold your tongue!\" Dick implored him.\n\nTom, however, was full with some remembrance of the past; he continued\nto repeat,--\n\n\"Long ago ... forks ... chains!\" until Dick led him out of hearing.\n\nA fresh halting-place was chosen a short distance further on, and\nsupper was prepared. But the meal was left almost untasted; not so much\nthat hunger had been overcome by fatigue, but because the indefinable\nfeeling of uneasiness, that had taken possession of them all, had\nentirely destroyed all appetite.\n\n[Illustration: The man was gone, and his horse with him.]\n\nGradually the night became very dark. The sky was covered with heavy\nstorm-clouds, and on the western horizon flashes of summer lightning\nnow and then glimmered through the trees. The air was perfectly still;\nnot a leaf stirred, and the atmosphere seemed so charged with\nelectricity as to be incapable of transmitting sound of any kind.\n\nDick, himself, with Austin and Bat in attendance, remained on guard,\nall of them eagerly straining both eye and ear to catch any light or\nsound that might disturb the silence and obscurity. Old Tom, with his\nhead sunk upon his breast, sat motionless, as in a trance; he was\ngloomily revolving the awakened memories of the past. Mrs. Weldon was\nengaged with her sick child. Scarcely one of the party was really\nasleep, except indeed it might be Cousin Benedict, whose reasoning\nfaculties were not of an order to carry him forwards into any future\ncontingencies.\n\nMidnight was still an hour in advance, when the dull air seemed filled\nwith a deep and prolonged roar, mingled with a peculiar kind of\nvibration.\n\nTom started to his feet. A fresh recollection of his early days had\nstruck him.\n\n\"A lion! a lion!\" he shouted.\n\nIn vain Dick tried to repress him; but he repeated,--\n\n\"A lion! a lion!\"\n\nDick Sands seized his cutlass, and, unable any longer to control his\nwrath, he rushed to the spot where he had left Harris lying.\n\nThe man was gone, and his horse with him!\n\nAll the suspicions that had been so long pent up within Dick's mind now\nshaped themselves into actual reality. A flood of light had broken in\nupon him. Now he was convinced, only too certainly, that it was not the\ncoast of America at all upon which the schooner had been cast ashore!\nit was not Easter Island that had been sighted far away in the west!\nthe compass had completely deceived him; he was satisfied now that the\nstrong currents had carried them quite round Cape Horn, and that they\nhad really entered the Atlantic. No wonder that quinquinas, caoutchouc,\nand other South American products, had failed to be seen. This was\nneither the Bolivian pampas nor the plateau of Atacama. They were\ngiraffes, not ostriches, that had vanished down the glade; they were\nelephants that had trodden down the underwood; they were hippopotamuses\nthat were lurking by the river; it was indeed the dreaded tzetsy that\nCousin Benedict had so triumphantly discovered; and, last of all, it\nwas a lion's roar that had disturbed the silence of the forest. That\nchain, that knife, those forks, were unquestionably the instruments of\nslave-dealers; and what could those mutilated hands be, except the\nrelics of their ill-fated victims?\n\nHarris and Negoro must be in a conspiracy!\n\nIt was with terrible anguish that Dick gnashed his teeth and muttered,--\n\n\"Yes, it is too true; we are in Africa! in equatorial Africa! in the\nland of slavery! in the very haunt of slave-drivers!\"\n\n\n\nEND OF FIRST PART.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND.\n\n\n[Illustration: WEST COAST OF CENTRAL AFRICA.]\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE DARK CONTINENT.\n\n\nThe \"slave-trade\" is an expression that ought never to have found its\nway into any human language. After being long practised at a large\nprofit by such European nations as had possessions beyond the seas,\nthis abominable traffic has now for many years been ostensibly\nforbidden; yet even in the enlightenment of this nineteenth century, it\nis still largely carried on, especially in Central Africa, inasmuch as\nthere are several states, professedly Christian, whose signatures have\nnever been affixed to the deed of abolition.\n\nIncredible as it should seem, this barter of human beings still exists,\nand for the due comprehension of the second part of Dick Sands' story\nit must be borne in mind, that for the purpose of supplying certain\ncolonies with slaves, there continue to be prosecuted such barbarous\n\"man-hunts\" as threaten almost to lay waste an entire continent with\nblood, fire, and pillage.\n\nThe nefarious traffic as far as regards negroes does not appear to have\narisen until the fifteenth century. The following are said to be the\ncircumstances under which it had its origin. After being banished from\nSpain, the Mussulmans crossed the straits of Gibraltar and took refuge\nupon the shores of Africa, but the Portuguese who then occupied that\nportion of the coast persecuted the fugitives with the utmost severity,\nand having captured them in large numbers, sent them as prisoners into\nPortugal. They were thus the first nucleus of any African slaves that\nentered Western Europe since the commencement of the Christian era. The\nmajority, however, of these Mussulmans were members of wealthy\nfamilies, who were prepared to pay almost any amount of money for their\nrelease; but no ransom was exorbitant enough to tempt the Portuguese to\nsurrender them; more precious than gold were the strong arms that\nshould work the resources of their young and rising colonies. Thus\nbaulked in their purpose of effecting a direct ransom of their captured\nrelatives, the Mussulman families next submitted a proposition for\nexchanging them for a larger number of African negroes, whom it would\nbe quite easy to procure. The Portuguese, to whom the proposal was in\nevery way advantageous, eagerly accepted the offer; and in this way the\nslave-trade was originated in Europe.\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century this odious traffic had become\npermanently established; in principle it contained nothing repugnant to\nthe semi-barbarous thought and customs then existing; all the great\nstates recognized it as the most effectual means of colonizing the\nislands of the New World, especially as slaves of negro blood, well\nacclimatized to tropical heat, were able to survive where white men\nmust have perished by thousands. The transport of slaves to the\nAmerican colonies was consequently regularly effected by vessels\nspecially built for that purpose, and large d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4ts for this branch of\ncommerce were established at various points of the African coast. The\n\"goods\" cost comparatively little in production, and the profits were\nenormous.\n\nYet, after all, however indispensable it might be to complete the\nfoundation of the trans-atlantic colonies, there was nothing to justify\nthis shameful barter of human flesh and blood, and the voice of\nphilanthropy began to be heard in protestation, calling upon all\nEuropean governments, in the name of mercy and common humanity, to\ndecree the abolition of the trade at once.\n\nIn 1751, the Quakers put themselves at the head of the abolitionist\nmovement in North America, that very land where, a hundred years later,\nthe war of secession burst forth, in which the question of slavery bore\nthe most conspicuous part. Several of the Northern States, Virginia,\nConnecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania prohibited the trade,\nliberating the slaves, in spite of the cost, who had been imported into\ntheir territories.\n\nThe campaign, thus commenced, was not limited to a few provinces of the\nNew World; on this side of the Atlantic, too, the partisans of slavery\nwere subject to a vigourous attack. England and France led the van, and\nenergetically beat up recruits to serve the righteous cause. \"Let us\nlose our colonies rather than sacrifice our principles,\" was the\nmagnanimous watchword that resounded throughout Europe, and\nnotwithstanding the vast political and commercial interests involved in\nthe question, it did not go forth in vain. A living impulse had been\ncommunicated to the liberation-movement. In 1807, England formally\nprohibited the slave-trade in her colonies; France following her\nexample in 1814. The two great nations then entered upon a treaty on\nthe subject, which was confirmed by Napoleon during the Hundred Days.\n\nHitherto, however, the declaration was purely theoretical. Slave-ships\ncontinued to ply their illicit trade, discharging their living cargo at\nmany a colonial port. It was evident that more resolute and practical\nmeasures must be taken to impress the enormity. Accordingly the United\nStates in 1820, and Great Britain in 1824, declared the slave-trade to\nbe an act of piracy and its perpetrators to be punishable with death.\nFrance soon gave in her adherence to the new treaty, but the Southern\nStates of America, and the Spanish and Portuguese, not having signed\nthe act of abolition, continued the importation of slaves at a great\nprofit, and this in defiance of the recognized reciprocal right of\nvisitation to verify the flags of suspected ships.\n\nBut although the slave-trade by these measures was in a considerable\nmeasure reduced, it continued to exist; new slaves were not allowed,\nbut the old ones did not recover their liberty. England was now the\nfirst to set a noble example. On the 14th of May, 1833, an Act of\nParliament, by a munificent vote of millions of pounds, emancipated all\nthe negroes in the British Colonies, and in August, 1838, 670,000\nslaves were declared free men. Ten years later, in 1848, the French\nRepublic liberated the slaves in her colonies to the number of 260,000,\nand in 1859 the war which broke out between the Federals and\nConfederates in the United States finished the work of emancipation by\nextending it to the whole of North America.\n\nThus, three great powers have accomplished their task of humanity, and\nat the present time the slave-trade is carried on only for the\nadvantage of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, or to supply the\nrequirements of the Turkish or Arab populations of the East. Brazil,\nalthough she has not emancipated her former slaves, does not receive\nany new, and all negro children are pronounced free-born.\n\nIn contrast, however, to all this, it is not to be concealed that, in\nthe interior of Africa, as the result of wars between chieftains waged\nfor the sole object of making captives, entire tribes are often reduced\nto slavery, and are carried off in caravans in two opposite directions,\nsome westwards to the Portuguese colony of Angola, others eastwards to\nMozambique. Of these miserable creatures, of whom a very small\nproportion ever reach their destination, some are despatched to Cuba or\nMadagascar, others to the Arab or Turkish provinces of Asia, to Mecca\nor Muscat. The French and English cruisers have practically very little\npower to control the iniquitous proceedings, because the extent of\ncoast to be watched is so large that a strict and adequate surveillance\ncannot be maintained. The extent of the odious export is very\nconsiderable; no less than 24,000 slaves annually reach the coast, a\nnumber that hardly represents a tenth part of those who are massacred\nor otherwise perish by a deplorable end. After the frightful\nbutcheries, the fields lie devastated, the smouldering villages are\nvoid of inhabitants, the rivers reek with bleeding corpses, and wild\nbeasts take undisputed possession of the soil. Livingstone, upon\nreturning to a district, immediately after one of these ruthless raids,\nsaid that he could never have recognized it for the same that he had\nvisited only a few months previously; and all other travellers, Grant,\nSpeke, Burton, Cameron, Stanley, describe the wooded plateau of Central\nAfrica as the principal theatre of the barbarous warfare between chief\nand chief. In the region of the great lakes, throughout the vast\ndistrict which feeds the market of Zanzibar, in Bornu and Fezzan,\nfurther south on the banks of the Nyassa and Zambesi, further west in\nthe districts of the Upper Zaire, just traversed by the intrepid\nStanley, everywhere there is the recurrence of the same scenes of ruin,\nslaughter, and devastation. Ever and again the question seems to be\nforced upon the mind whether slavery is not to end in the entire\nannihilation of the negro race, so that, like the Australian tribes of\nSouth Holland, it will become extinct. Who can doubt that the day must\ndawn which will herald the closing of the markets in the Spanish and\nPortuguese colonies, a day when civilized nations shall no longer\ntolerate the perpetration of this barbarous wrong?\n\nIt is hardly too much to say that another year ought to witness the\nemancipation of every slave in the possession of Christian states. It\nseems only too likely that for years to come the Mussulman nations will\ncontinue to depopulate the continent of Africa; to them is due the\nchief emigration of the natives, who, torn from their provinces, are\nsent to the eastern coast in numbers that exceed 40,000 annually. Long\nbefore the Egyptian expedition the natives of Sennaar were sold to the\nnatives of Darfur and _vice versa_; and even Napoleon Buonaparte\npurchased a considerable number of negroes, whom he organized into\nregiments after the fashion of the mamelukes. Altogether it may be\naffirmed, that although four-fifths of the present century have passed\naway, slave-traffic in Africa has been increased rather than diminished.\n\nThe truth is that Islamism really nurtures the slave-trade. In\nMussulman provinces, the black slave has taken the place of the white\nslave of former times; dealers of the most questionable character bear\ntheir part in the execrable business, bringing a supplementary\npopulation to races which, unregenerated by their own labour, would\notherwise diminish and ultimately disappear.\n\nAs in the time of Buonaparte, these slaves often become soldiers; on\nthe Upper Niger, for instance, they still form half the army of certain\nchieftains, under circumstances in which their lot is hardly, if at\nall, inferior to that of free men. Elsewhere, where the slave is not a\nsoldier, he counts merely as current coin; and in Bornu and even in\nEgypt, we are told by William Lejean, an eye-witness, that officers and\nother functionaries have received their pay in this form.\n\nSuch, then, appears to be the present actual condition of the\nslave-trade; and it is stern justice that compels the additional\nstatement that there are representatives of certain great European\npowers who still favour the unholy traffic with an indulgent\nconnivance, and whilst cruisers are watching the coasts of the Atlantic\nand of the Indian Ocean, kidnapping goes on regularly in the interior,\ncaravans pass along under the very eyes of certain officials, and\nmassacres are perpetrated in which frequently ten negroes are\nsacrificed in the capture of a single slave.\n\nIt was the knowledge, more or less complete, of all this, that wrung\nfrom Dick Sands his bitter and heart-rending cry:--\n\n\"We are in Africa! in the very haunt of slave-drivers!\"\n\nToo true it was that he found himself and his companions in a land\nfraught with such frightful peril. He could only tremble when he\nwondered on what part of the fatal continent the \"Pilgrim\" had\nstranded. Evidently it was at some point of the west coast, and he had\nevery reason to fear that it was on the shores of Angola, the\nrendezvous for all the caravans that journey in that portion of Africa.\n\nHis conjecture was correct; he really was in the very country that a\nfew years later and with gigantic effort was to be traversed by Cameron\nin the south and Stanley in the north. Of the vast territory, with its\nthree provinces, Congo, Angola, and Benguela, little was then known\nexcept the coast. It extends from the Zaire on the north to the Nourse\non the south, and its chief towns are the ports of Benguela and of St.\nPaul de Loanda, the capital of the colony, which is a dependency of the\nkingdom of Portugal. The interior of the country had been almost\nentirely unexplored. Very few were the travellers who had cared to\nventure far inland, for an unhealthy climate, a hot, damp soil\nconducive to fever, a permanent warfare between the native tribes, some\nof which are cannibals, and the ill-feeling of the slave-dealers\nagainst any stranger who might endeavour to discover the secrets of\ntheir infamous craft, all combine to render the region one of the most\nhazardous in the whole of Equatorial Africa.\n\nIt was in 1816 that Tuckey ascended the Congo as far as the Yellala\nFalls, a distance not exceeding 203 miles; but the journey was too\nshort to give an accurate idea of the interior of the country, and\nmoreover cost the lives of nearly all the officers and scientific men\nconnected with the expedition.\n\nThirty-seven years afterwards, Dr. Livingstone had advanced from the\nCape of Good Hope to the Upper Zambesi; thence, with a fearlessness\nhitherto unrivalled, he crossed the Coango, an affluent of the Congo,\nand after having traversed the continent from the extreme south to the\neast he reached St. Paul de Loanda on the 31st of May, 1854, the first\nexplorer of the unknown portions of the great Portuguese colony.\n\nEighteen years elapsed, and two other bold travellers crossed the\nentire continent from east to west, and after encountering unparalleled\ndifficulties, emerged, the one to the south, the other to the north of\nAngola.\n\nThe first of these was Verney Lovett Cameron, a lieutenant in the\nBritish navy. In 1872, when serious doubts were entertained as to the\nsafety of the expedition sent out under Stanley to the relief of\nLivingstone in the great lake district, Lieutenant Cameron volunteered\nto go out in search of the noble missionary explorer. His offer was\naccepted, and accompanied by Dr. Dillon, Lieutenant Cecil Murphy, and\nRobert Moffat, a nephew of Livingstone, he started from Zanzibar.\nHaving passed through Ugogo, he met Livingstone's corpse, which was\nbeing borne to the eastern coast by his faithful followers. Unshaken in\nhis resolve to make his way right across the continent, Cameron still\npushed onwards to the west. He passed through Unyanyembe and Uganda,\nand reached Kawele, where he secured all Livingstone's papers. After\nexploring Lake Tanganyika he crossed the mountains of Bambarre, and\nfinding himself unable to descend the course of the Lualaba, he\ntraversed the provinces devastated and depopulated by war and the\nslave-trade, Kilemba, Urua, the sources of the Lomami, Ulanda, and\nLoval\u00c3\u00a9, and having crossed the Coanza, he sighted the Atlantic and\nreached the port of St. Philip de Benguela, after a journey that had\noccupied three years and five months. Cameron's two companions, Dr.\nDillon and Robert Moffat, both succumbed to the hardships of the\nexpedition.\n\nThe intrepid Englishman was soon to be followed into the field by an\nAmerican, Mr. Henry Moreland Stanley. It is universally known how the\nundaunted correspondent of the _New York Herald_, having been\ndespatched in search of Livingstone, found the veteran missionary at\nUjiji, on the borders of Lake Tanganyika, on the 31st of October, 1871.\nBut what he had undertaken in the course of humanity Stanley longed to\ncontinue in the interests of science, his prime object being to make a\nthorough investigation of the Lualaba, of which, in his first\nexpedition, he had only been able to get a partial and imperfect\nsurvey. Accordingly, whilst Cameron was still deep in the provinces of\nCentral Africa, Stanley started from Bagamoyo in November, 1874.\nTwenty-one months later he quitted Ujiji, which had been decimated by\nsmall-pox, and in seventy-four days accomplished the passage of the\nlake and reached Nyangwe, a great slave-market previously visited both\nby Livingstone and Cameron. He was also present at some of the horrible\nrazzias, perpetrated by the officers of the Sultan of Zanzibar in the\ndistricts of the Marunzu and Manyuema.\n\nIn order to be in a position to descend the Lualaba to its very mouth,\nStanley engaged at Nyangwe 140 porters and nineteen boats. Difficulties\narose from the very outset, and not only had he to contend with the\ncannibals of Ugusu, but, in order to avoid many unnavigable cataracts,\nhe had to convey his boats many miles by land. Near the equator, just\nat the point where the Lualaba turns north-north-west, Stanley's little\nconvoy was attacked by a fleet of boats, manned by several hundred\nnatives, whom, however, he succeeded in putting to flight. Nothing\ndaunted, the resolute American pushed on to lat. 20\u00c2\u00b0 N. and\nascertained, beyond room for doubt, that the Lualaba was really the\nUpper Zaire or Congo, and that, by following its course, he should come\ndirectly to the sea.\n\nBeset with many perils was the way. Stanley was in almost daily\ncollision with the various tribes upon the river-banks; on the 3rd of\nJune, 1877, he lost one of his companions, Frank Pocock, at the passage\nof the cataracts of Massassa, and on the 18th of July he was himself\ncarried in his boat into the Mbelo Falls, and escaped by little short\nof a miracle.\n\nOn the 6th of August the daring adventurer arrived at the village of Ni\nSanda, only four days from the sea; two days later he received a supply\nof provisions that had been sent by two Emboma merchants to Banza\nM'buko, the little coast-town where, after a journey of two years and\nnine months, fraught with every kind of hardship and privation, he\ncompleted his transit of the mighty continent. His toil told, at least\ntemporarily, upon his years, but he had the grand satisfaction of\nknowing that he had traced the whole course of the Lualaba, and had\nascertained, beyond reach of question, that as the Nile is the great\nartery of the north, and the Zambesi of the east, so Africa possesses\nin the west a third great river, which in a course of no less than 2900\nmiles, under the names of the Lualaba, Zaire, and Congo, unites the\nlake district with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn 1873, however, the date at which the \"Pilgrim\" foundered upon the\ncoast, very little was known of the province of Angola, except that it\nwas the scene of the western slave-trade, of which the markets of Bih\u00c3\u00a9,\nCassanga, and Kazunde were the chief centres. This was the country in\nwhich Dick Sands now found himself, a hundred miles from shore, in\ncharge of a lady exhausted with fatigue and anxiety, a half-dying\nchild, and a band of negroes who would be a most tempting bait to the\nslave-driver.\n\nHis last illusion was completely dispelled. He had no longer the\nfaintest hope that he was in America, that land where little was to be\ndreaded from either native, wild beast, or climate; he could no more\ncherish the fond impression that he might be in the pleasant region\nbetween the Cordilleras and the coast, where villages are numerous and\nmissions afford hospitable shelter to every traveller. Far, far away\nwere those provinces of Bolivia and Peru, to which (unless a criminal\nhand had interposed) the \"Pilgrim\" would certainly have sped her way.\nNo: too truly this was the terrible province of Angola; and worse than\nall, not the district near the coast, under the surveillance of the\nPortuguese authorities, but the interior of the country, traversed only\nby slave caravans, driven under the lash of the havildars.\n\nLimited, in one sense, was the knowledge that Dick Sands possessed of\nthis land of horrors; but he had read the accounts that had been given\nby the missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, by the\nPortuguese traders who frequented the route from St. Paul de Loanda, by\nSan Salvador to the Zaire, as well as by Dr. Livingstone in his travels\nin 1853, and consequently he knew enough to awaken immediate and\ncomplete despair in any spirit less indomitable than his own.\n\nAnyhow, his position was truly appalling.\n\n[Illustration: They were seated at the foot of an enormous banyan-tree.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nACCOMPLICES.\n\n\nOn the day following that on which Dick Sands and his party had made\ntheir last halt in the forest, two men met by appointment at a spot\nabout three miles distant.\n\nThe two men were Harris and Negoro, the one lately landed from New\nZealand, the other pursuing his wonted occupation of slave-dealer in\nthe province of Angola. They were seated at the foot of an enormous\nbanyan-tree, on the banks of a rushing torrent that streamed between\ntall borders of papyrus.\n\nAfter the conversation had turned awhile upon the events of the last\nfew hours, Negoro said abruptly,--\n\n\"Couldn't you manage to get that young fifteen-year-old any farther\ninto the interior?\"\n\n\"No, indeed; it was a hard matter enough to bring him thus far; for the\nlast few days his suspicions have been wide awake.\"\n\n\"But just another hundred miles, you know,\" continued Negoro, \"would\nhave finished the business off well, and those black fellows would have\nbeen ours to a dead certainty.\"\n\n\"Don't I tell you, my dear fellow, that it was more than time for me to\ngive them the slip?\" replied Harris, shrugging his shoulders. \"Only too\nwell I knew that our young friend was longing to put a shot into my\nbody, and that was a sugar-plum I might not be able to digest.\"\n\nThe Portuguese gave a grunt of assent, and Harris went on,--\n\n\"For several days I succeeded well enough. I managed to palm off the\ncountry as the forest of Atacama, which you may recollect I once\nvisited; but when the youngster began to ask for gutta-percha and\nhumming-birds, and his mother wanted quinquina-trees, and when that old\nfool of a cousin was bent on finding cocuyos, I was rather nonplussed.\nOne day I had to swear that giraffes were ostriches, but the young\ncaptain did not seem to swallow the dose at all easily. Then we saw\ntraces of elephants and hippopotamuses, which of course are as often\nseen in America as an honest man in a Benguela penitentiary; then that\nold nigger Tom discovered a lot of forks and chains left by some\nrunaway slaves at the foot of a tree; but when, last of all, a lion\nroared,--and the noise, you know, is rather louder than the mewing of a\ncat,--I thought it was time to take my horse and decamp.\"\n\nNegoro repeated his expression of regret that the whole party had not\nbeen carried another hundred miles into the province.\n\n\"It really cannot be helped,\" rejoined the American; \"I have done the\nbest I could; and I think, mate,\" he added confidentially, \"that you\nhave done wisely in following the caravan at a good distance; that dog\nof theirs evidently owes you a grudge, and might prove an ugly\ncustomer.\"\n\n\"I shall put a bullet into that beast's head before long,\" growled\nNegoro.\n\n\"Take care you don't get one through your own first,\" laughed Harris;\n\"that young Sands, I warn you, is a first-rate shot, and between\nourselves, is rather a fine fellow of his kind.\"\n\n\"Fine fellow, indeed!\" sneered Negoro; \"whatever he is, he is a young\nupstart, and I have a long score to wipe off against him;\" and, as he\nspoke, an expression of the utmost malignity passed over his\ncountenance.\n\nHarris smiled.\n\n\"Well, mate,\" he said; \"your travels have not improved your temper, I\nsee. But come now, tell me what you have been doing all this time. When\nI found you just after the wreck, at the mouth of the Longa, you had\nonly time to ask me to get this party, somehow or other, up into the\ncountry. But it is just upon two years since you left Cassange with\nthat caravan of slaves for our old master Alvez. What have you been\ndoing since? The last I heard of you was that you had run foul of an\nEnglish cruiser, and that you were condemned to be hanged.\"\n\n\"So I was very nearly,\" muttered Negoro.\n\n\"Ah, well, that will come sooner or later,\" rejoined the American with\nphilosophic indifference; \"men of our trade can't expect to die quietly\nin our beds, you know. But were you caught by the English?\"\n\n\"No, by the Portuguese.\"\n\n\"Before you had got rid of your cargo?\"\n\nNegoro hesitated a moment before replying.\n\n\"No,\" he said, presently, and added, \"The Portuguese have changed their\ngame: for a long time they carried on the trade themselves, but now\nthey have got wonderfully particular; so I was caught, and condemned to\nend my days in the penitentiary at St. Paul de Loanda.\"\n\n\"Confound it!\" exclaimed Harris, \"a hundred times better be hanged!\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" the Portuguese replied, \"for when I had been\nat the galleys about a fortnight I managed to escape, and got into the\nhold of an English steamer bound for New Zealand. I wedged myself in\nbetween a cask of water and a case of preserved meat, and so managed to\nexist for a month. It was close quarters, I can tell you, but I\npreferred to travel incognito rather than run the risk of being handed\nover again to the authorities at Loanda.\"\n\n\"Well done!\" exclaimed the American, \"and so you had a free passage to\nthe land of the Maoris. But you didn't come back in the same fashion?\"\n\n\"No; I always had a hankering to be here again at my old trade; but for\na year and a half....\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and grasped Harris by the arm.\n\n\"Hush,\" he whispered, \"didn't you hear a rustling in that clump of\npapyrus?\"\n\nIn a moment Harris had caught up his loaded gun; and both men, starting\nto their feet, looked anxiously around them.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" said Harris presently; \"the stream is swollen by the\nstorm, that is all; your two years' travelling has made you forget the\nsounds of the forest, mate. Sit down again, and go on with your story.\nWhen I know the past, I shall be better able to talk about the future.\"\n\nThey reseated themselves, and Negoro went on,--\n\n\"For a whole year and a half I vegetated at Auckland. I left the hold\nof the steamer without a dollar in my pocket, and had to turn my hand\nto every trade imaginable in order to get a living.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! I daresay you even tried the trade of being an honest\nman,\" put in the American.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Negoro, \"and in course of time the 'Pilgrim,' the\nvessel by which I came here, put in at Auckland. While she was waiting\nto take Mrs. Weldon and her party on board, I applied to the captain\nfor a post, for I was once mate on board a slaver, and know something\nof seamanship. The 'Pilgrim's' crew was complete, but fortunately the\nship's cook had just deserted; I offered to supply his place; in\ndefault of better my services were accepted, and in a few days we were\nout of sight of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"I have heard something about the voyage from young Sands,\" said\nHarris, \"but even now I can't understand how you reached here.\"\n\n\"Neither does he,\" said Negoro, with a malicious grin. \"I will tell you\nnow, and you may repeat the story to your young friend if you like.\"\n\n\"Well, go on,\" said Harris.\n\n\"When we started,\" continued Negoro, \"it was my intention to sail only\nas far as Chili: that would have brought me nearly half way to Angola;\nbut three weeks after leaving Auckland, Captain Hull and all his crew\nwere lost in chasing a whale, and I and the apprentice were the only\nseamen left on board.\"\n\n\"Then why in the name of peace didn't you take command of the ship?\"\nexclaimed Harris.\n\n[Illustration: Both men, starting to their feet, looked anxiously\naround them.]\n\n\"Because there were five strong niggers who didn't trust me; so, on\nsecond thoughts, I determined to keep my old post as cook.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean to say that it was mere accident that brought you to\nthe coast of Africa?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it; the only accident,--and a very lucky one it was--was\nmeeting you on the very spot where we stranded. But it was my doing\nthat we got so far. Young Sands understood nothing more of navigation\nthan the use of the log and compass. Well, one fine day, you\nunderstand, the log remained at the bottom of the sea, and one night\nthe compass was tampered with, so that the 'Pilgrim,' scudding along\nbefore a tempest, was carried altogether out of her course. You may\nimagine the young captain was puzzled at the length of the voyage; it\nwould have bewildered a more experienced head than his. Before he was\naware of it, we had rounded Cape Horn; I recognized it through the\nmist. Then at once I put the compass to rights again, and the 'Pilgrim'\nwas carried north-eastwards by a tremendous hurricane to the very place\nI wanted. The island Dick Sands took for Easter Island was really\nTristan d'Acunha.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Harris; \"I think I understand now how our friends have\nbeen persuaded to take Angola for Bolivia. But they are undeceived now,\nyou know,\" he added.\n\n\"I know all about that,\" replied the Portuguese.\n\n\"Then what do you intend to do?\" said Harris.\n\n\"You will see,\" answered Negoro significantly; \"but first of all tell\nme something about our employer, old Alvez; how is he?\"\n\n\"Oh, the old rascal is well enough, and will be delighted to see you\nagain,\" replied Harris.\n\n\"Is he at the market at Bih\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"No, he has been at his place at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 for a year or more.\"\n\n\"And how does business go on?\"\n\n\"Badly enough, on this coast,\" said Harris; \"plenty of slaves are\nwaiting to be shipped to the Spanish colonies, but the difficulty is\nhow to get them embarked. The Portuguese authorities on the one hand,\nand the English cruisers on the other, almost put a stop to exportation\naltogether; down to the south, near Mossamedes, is the only part where\nit can be attempted with any chance of success. To pass a caravan\nthrough Benguela or Loande is an utter impossibility; neither the\ngovernors nor the chef\u00c3\u00a9s[1] will listen to a word of reason. Old Alvez\nis therefore thinking of going in the other direction towards Nyangwe\nand Lake Tanganyika; he can there exchange his goods for slaves and\nivory, and is sure to do a good business with Upper Egypt and the coast\nof Mozambique, which supplies Madagascar. But I tell you, Negoro,\" he\nadded gravely, \"I believe the time is coming when the slave-trade will\ncome to an end altogether. The English missionaries are advancing into\nthe interior. That fellow Livingstone, confound him! has finished his\ntour of the lakes, and is now working his way towards Angola; then\nthere is another man named Cameron who is talking about crossing the\ncontinent from east to west, and it is feared that Stanley the American\nwill do the same. All this exploration, you know, is ruinous to our\nbusiness, and it is to our interest that not one of these travellers\nshould be allowed to return to tell tales of us in Europe.\"\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Subordinate Portuguese governors at secondary stations.]\n\n\nHarris spoke like a merchant embarrassed by a temporary commercial\ncrisis. The atrocious scenes to which the slave-dealers are accustomed\nseems to render them impervious to all sense of justice or humanity,\nand they learn to regard their living merchandize with as small concern\nas though they were dealing with chests of tea or hogsheads of sugar.\n\nBut Harris was right when he asserted that civilization must follow the\nwake of the intrepid pioneers of African discovery. Livingstone first,\nand after him, Grant, Speke, Burton, Cameron, Stanley, are the heroes\nwhose names will ever be linked with the first dawnings of a brighter\nage upon the dark wilds of Equatorial Africa.\n\nHaving ascertained that his accomplice had returned unscrupulous and\ndaring as ever, and fully prepared to pursue his former calling as an\nagent of old Alvez the slave dealer, Harris inquired what he proposed\ndoing with the survivors of the \"Pilgrim\" now that they were in his\nhands.\n\n\"Divide them into two lots,\" answered Negoro, without a moment's\nhesitation, \"one for the market, the other....\"\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but the expression of his countenance\nwas an index to the malignity of his purpose.\n\n\"Which shall you sell?\" asked the American.\n\n\"The niggers, of course. The old one is not worth much, but the other\nfour ought to fetch a good price at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" said Harris; \"American-born slaves, with plenty\nof work in them, are rare articles, and very different to the miserable\nwretches we get up the country. But you never told me,\" he added,\nsuddenly changing the subject, \"whether you found any money on board\nthe 'Pilgrim'!\"\n\n\"Oh, I rescued a few hundred dollars from the wreck, that was all,\"\nsaid the Portuguese carelessly; \"but I am expecting....\" he stopped\nshort.\n\n\"What are you expecting?\" inquired Harris eagerly.\n\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing,\" said Negoro, apparently annoyed that he had\nsaid so much, and immediately began talking of the means of securing\nthe living prey which he had been taking so many pains to entrap.\nHarris informed him that on the Coanza, about ten miles distant, there\nwas at the present time encamped a slave caravan, under the control of\nan Arab named Ibn Hamish; plenty of native soldiers were there on\nguard, and if Dick Sands and his people could only be induced to travel\nin that direction, their capture would be a matter of very little\ndifficulty. He said that of course Dick Sands' first thought would\nnaturally be how to get back to the coast; it was not likely that he\nwould venture a second time through the forest, but would in all\nprobability try to make his way to the nearest river, and descend its\ncourse on a raft to the sea. The nearest river was undoubtedly the\nCoanza, so that he and Negoro might feel quite sure of meeting \"their\nfriends\" upon its banks.\n\n\"If you really think so,\" said Negoro, \"there is not much time to be\nlost; whatever young Sands determines to do, he will do at once: he\nnever lets the grass grow under his feet.\"\n\n\"Let us start, then, this very moment, mate,\" was Harris's reply.\n\nBoth rose to their feet, when they were startled by the same rustling\nin the papyrus which had previously aroused Negoro's fears. Presently a\nlow growl was heard, and a large dog, showing his teeth, emerged from\nthe bushes, evidently prepared for an attack.\n\n\"It's Dingo!\" exclaimed Harris.\n\n\"Confound the brute! he shall not escape me this time,\" said Negoro.\n\nHe caught up Harris's gun, and raising it to his shoulder, he fired\njust as the dog was in the act of springing at his throat. A long whine\nof pain followed the report, and Dingo disappeared again amongst the\nbushes that fringed the stream. Negoro was instantly upon his track,\nbut could discover nothing beyond a few blood-stains upon the stalks of\nthe papyrus, and a long crimson trail upon the pebbles on the bank.\n\n\"I think I have done for the beast now,\" was Negoro's remark as he\nreturned from his fruitless search.\n\nHarris, who had been a silent spectator of the whole scene, now asked\ncoolly,--\n\n\"What makes that animal have such an inveterate dislike to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is an old score to settle between us,\" replied the\nPortuguese.\n\n\"What about?\" inquired the American.\n\nNegoro made no reply, and finding him evidently disinclined to be\ncommunicative on the subject, Harris did not press the matter any\nfurther.\n\nA few moments later the two men were descending the stream, and making\ntheir way through the forest towards the Coanza.\n\n[Illustration: Dingo disappeared again amongst the bushes]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nON THE MARCH AGAIN.\n\n\n\"Africa! Africa!\" was the terrible word that echoed and re-echoed in\nthe mind of Dick Sands. As he pondered over the events of the preceding\nweeks he could now understand why, notwithstanding the rapid progress\nof the ship, the land seemed ever to be receding, and why the voyage\nhad been prolonged to twice its anticipated length. It remained,\nhowever, a mystery inexplicable as before, how and when they had\nrounded Cape Horn and passed into another ocean. Suddenly the idea\nflashed upon him that the compass must have been tampered with; and he\nremembered the fall of the first compass; he recalled the night when he\nhad been roused by Tom's cry of alarm that Negoro had fallen against\nthe binnacle. As he recollected these circumstances he became more and\nmore convinced that it was Negoro who was the mainspring of all the\nmischief; that it was he who had contrived the loss of the \"Pilgrim,\"\nand compromised the safety of all on board.\n\nWhat had been the career, what could be the motives of a man who was\ncapable of such vile machinations?\n\nBut shrouded in mystery as were the events of the past, the present\noffered a prospect equally obscure.\n\nBeyond the fact that he was in Africa and a hundred miles from the\ncoast, Dick knew absolutely nothing. He could only conjecture that he\nwas in the fatal province of Angola, and assured as he was that Harris\nhad acted the traitor, he was led to the conclusion that he and Negoro\nhad been playing into each other's hands. The result of the collision,\nhe feared, might be very disastrous to the survivors of the \"Pilgrim.\"\nYet, in what manner would the odious stratagem be accomplished? Dick\ncould well understand that the negroes would be sold for slaves; he\ncould only too easily imagine that upon himself Negoro would wreak the\nvengeance he had so obviously been contemplating; but for Mrs. Weldon\nand the other helpless members of the party what fate could be in store?\n\nThe situation was terrible, but yet Dick did not flinch; he had been\nappointed captain, and captain he would remain; Mrs. Weldon and her\nlittle son had been committed to his charge, and he was resolved to\ncarry out his trust faithfully to the end.\n\nFor several hours he remained wrapped in thought, pondering over the\npresent and the future, weighing the evil chances against the good,\nonly to be convinced that the evil much preponderated. At length he\nrose, firm, resolute, calm. The first glimmer of dawn was breaking upon\nthe forest. All the rest of the party, except Tom, were fast asleep.\nDick Sands crept softly up to the old negro, and whispered:--\n\n\"Tom, you know now where we are!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Dick, only too well I know it. We are in Africa!\"\n\nThe old man sighed mournfully.\n\n\"Tom,\" said Dick, in the same low voice, \"you must keep this a secret;\nyou must not say a word to let Mrs. Weldon or any of the others know.\"\n\nThe old man murmured his assent, and Dick continued:--\n\n\"It will be quite enough for them to learn that we have been betrayed\nby Harris, and that we must consequently practise extra care and\nwatchfulness; they will merely think we are taking precautions against\nbeing surprised by nomad Indians. I trust to your good sense, Tom, to\nassist me in this.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon me, Mr. Dick; and I can promise you that we will\nall do our best to prove our courage, and to show our devotion to your\nservice.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"You must keep this a secret\"]\n\nThus assured of Tom's co-operation, Dick proceeded to deliberate upon\nhis future line of action. He had every reason to believe that the\ntreacherous American, startled by the traces of the slaves and the\nunexpected roaring of the lion, had taken flight before he had\nconducted his victims to the spot where they were to be attacked, and\nthat consequently some hours might elapse before he would be joined by\nNegoro, who (to judge from Dingo's strange behaviour) had undoubtedly\nfor the last few days been somewhere on their track.\n\nHere was a delay that might be turned to good account, and no time was\nto be lost in taking advantage of it to commence their return journey\nto the coast. If, as Dick had every reason to suppose, he was in\nAngola, he hoped to find, either north or south, some Portuguese\nsettlement whence he could obtain the means of transporting his party\nto their several homes.\n\nBut how was this return journey to be accomplished? It would be\ndifficult, not to say imprudent, to retrace their footsteps through the\nforest; it would merely bring them to their starting-point, and would,\nmoreover, afford an easy track for Negoro or his accomplices to follow.\nThe safest and most secret means of reaching the coast would assuredly\nbe by descending the course of some river. This would have to be\neffected by constructing a strong raft, from which the little party,\nwell armed, might defend themselves alike from attacks either of the\nnatives or of wild beasts, and which would likewise afford a\ncomfortable means of transport for Mrs. Weldon and her little boy, who\nwere now deprived of the use of Harris's horse. The negroes, it is\ntrue, would be only too pleased to carry the lady on a litter of\nbranches, but this would be to occupy the services of two out of five,\nand under the circumstances it was manifestly advisable that all hands\nshould be free to act on the defensive. Another great inducement\ntowards the plan was that Dick Sands felt himself much more at home in\ntravelling by water than by land, and was longing to be once again upon\nwhat to him was, as it were, his native element. He little dreamt that\nhe was devising for himself the very plan that Harris, in his\nspeculations, had laid down for him!\n\nThe most urgent matter was now to find such a stream as would suit\ntheir purpose. Dick had several reasons for feeling sure that one\nexisted in the neighbourhood. He knew that the little river, which fell\ninto the Atlantic near the spot where the \"Pilgrim\" stranded, could not\nextend very far either to the north or east, because the horizon was\nbounded in both directions by the chain of mountains which he had taken\nfor the Cordilleras. If the stream did not rise in those hills it must\nincline to the south, so that in either case Dick was convinced he\ncould not be long in discovering it or one of its affluents. Another\nsign, which he recognized as hopeful, was that during the last few\nmiles of the march the soil had become moist and level, whilst here and\nthere the appearance of tiny rivulets indicated that an aqueous network\nexisted in the subsoil. On the previous day, too, the caravan had\nskirted a rushing torrent, of which the waters were tinged with oxide\nof iron from its sloping banks.\n\nDick's scheme was to make his way back as far as this stream, which\nthough not navigable itself would in all probability empty itself into\nsome affluent of greater importance. The idea, which he imparted to\nTom, met with the old negro's entire approval.\n\nAs the day dawned the sleepers, one by one, awoke. Mrs. Weldon laid\nlittle Jack in Nan's arms. The child was still dozing; the fever had\nabated, but he looked painfully white and exhausted after the attack.\n\n\"Dick,\" said Mrs. Weldon, after looking round her, \"where is Mr.\nHarris? I cannot see him.\"\n\n\"Harris has left us,\" answered Dick very quietly.\n\n\"Do you mean that he has gone on ahead?\"\n\n\"No, madam, I mean that he has left us, and gone away entirely: he is\nin league with Negoro.\"\n\n\"In league with Negoro!\" cried Mrs. Weldon, \"Ah, I have had a fancy\nlately that there has been something wrong: but why? what can be their\nmotive?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am unable to tell you,\" replied Dick; \"I only know that we\nhave no alternative but to return to the coast immediately if we would\nescape the two rascals.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Harris has left us\"]\n\n\"I only wish I could catch them,\" said Hercules, who had overheard the\nconversation; \"I would soon knock their heads together;\" and he shook\nhis two fists in giving emphasis to his words.\n\n\"But what will become of my boy?\" cried Mrs. Weldon, in tones of\ndespondency; \"I have been so sanguine in procuring him the comforts of\nSan Felice.\"\n\n\"Master Jack will be all right enough, madam, when we get into a more\nhealthy situation near the coast,\" said Tom.\n\n\"But is there no farm anywhere near? no village? no shelter?\" she\npleaded.\n\n\"None whatever, madam; I can only repeat that it is absolutely\nnecessary that we make the best of our way back to the sea-shore.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure, Dick, that Mr. Harris has deceived us?\"\n\nDirk felt that he should be glad to avoid any discussion on the\nsubject, but with a warning glance at Tom, he proceeded to say that on\nthe previous night he and Tom had discovered the American's treachery,\nand that if he had not instantly taken to his horse and fled he would\nhave answered for his guilt with his life. Without, however, dwelling\nfor a moment more than he could avoid upon the past, he hurried on to\ndetail the means by which he now proposed to reach the sea, concluding\nby the assertion that he hoped a very few miles' march would bring them\nto a stream on which they might be able to embark.\n\nMrs. Weldon, thoroughly ignoring her own weakness, professed her\nreadiness not only to walk, but to carry Jack too. Bat and Austin at\nonce volunteered to carry her in a litter; of this the lady would not\nhear, and bravely repeated her intention of travelling on foot,\nannouncing her willingness to start without further delay. Dick Sands\nwas only too glad to assent to her wish.\n\n\"Let me take Master Jack,\" said Hercules; \"I shall be out of my element\nif I have nothing to carry.\"\n\nThe giant, without waiting for a reply, took the child from Nan's arms\nso gently that he did not even rouse him from his slumber.\n\nThe weapons were next carefully examined, and the provisions, having\nbeen repacked into one parcel, were consigned to the charge of Act\u00c3\u00a6on,\nwho undertook to carry them on his back.\n\nCousin Benedict, whose wiry limbs seemed capable of bearing any amount\nof fatigue, was quite ready to start. It was doubtful whether he had\nnoticed Harris's disappearance; he was suffering from a loss which to\nhim was of far greater importance. He had mislaid his spectacles and\nmagnifying-glass. It had happened that Bat had picked them up in the\nlong grass, close to the spot where the amateur naturalist had been\nlying, but acting on a hint from Dick Sands, he said nothing about\nthem; in this way the entomologist, who, without his glasses could\nscarcely see a yard beyond his face, might be expected to be kept\nwithout trouble in the limits of the ranks, and having been placed\nbetween Act\u00c3\u00a6on and Austin with strict injunctions not to leave their\nside, he followed them as submissively as a blind man in\nleading-strings.\n\nThe start was made. But scarcely had the little troop advanced fifty\nyards upon their way, when Tom suddenly cried out,--\n\n\"Where's Dingo?\"\n\nWith all the force of his tremendous lungs, Hercules gave a series of\nreverberating shouts:--\n\n\"Dingo! Dingo! Dingo!\"\n\nNot a bark could be distinguished in reply\n\n\"Dingo! Dingo! Dingo!\" again echoed in the air.\n\nBut all was silence.\n\nDick was intensely annoyed at the non-appearance of the dog; his\npresence would have been an additional safeguard in the event of any\nsudden surprise.\n\n\"Perhaps he has followed Harris,\" suggested Tom.\n\n\"Far more likely he is on the track of Negoro,\" rejoined Dick.\n\n\"Then Negoro, to a dead certainty,\" said Hercules, \"will put a bullet\ninto his head.\"\n\n\"It is to be hoped,\" replied Bat, \"that Dingo will strangle him first.\"\n\nDick Sands, disguising his vexation, said,\n\n\"At any rate, we have no time to wait for the animal now: if he is\nalive, he will not fail to find us out. Move on, my lads! move on!\"\n\nThe weather was very hot; ever since daybreak heavy clouds had been\ngathering upon the horizon, and it seemed hardly likely that the day\nwould pass without a storm. Fortunately the woods were sufficiently\nlight to ensure a certain amount of freshness to the surface of the\nsoil. Here and there were large patches of tall, rank grass enclosed by\nclumps of forest trees. In some places, fossilized trunks, lying on the\nground, betokened the existence of one of the coal districts that are\ncommon upon the continent of Africa. Along the glades the carpet of\nverdure was relieved by crimson stems and a variety of flowers;\nginger-blossoms, blue and yellow, pale lobelias, and red orchids\nfertilized by the numerous insects that incessantly hovered about them.\nThe trees did not grow in impenetrable masses of one species, but\nexhibited themselves in infinite variety. There was also a species of\npalm producing an oil locally much valued; there were cotton-plants\ngrowing in bushes eight or ten feet high, the cotton attached in long\nshreds to the ligneous stalks; and there were copals from which,\npierced by the proboscis of certain insects, exudes an odorous resin\nthat flows on to the ground and is collected by the natives. Then there\nwere citrons and wild pomegranates and a score of other arborescent\nplants, all testifying to the fertility of this plateau of Central\nAfrica. In many places, too, the air was fragrant with the odour of\nvanilla, though it was not possible to discover the shrub from which\nthe perfume emanated.\n\nIn spite of it being the dry season, so that the soil had only been\nmoistened by occasional storms, all trees and plants were flourishing\nin great luxuriance. It was the time of year for fever, but, according\nto Dr. Livingstone's observation, the disorder may generally be cured\nby quitting the locality where it has been contracted. Dick expressed\nhis hope that, in little Jack's case, the words of the great traveller\nwould be verified, and in encouragement of this sanguine view, pointed\nout to Mrs. Weldon that although it was past the time for the\nperiodical return of the fever, the child was still slumbering quietly\nin Hercules' arms.\n\nThe march was continued with as much rapidity as was consistent with\ncaution. Occasionally, where the bushes and brushwood had been broken\ndown by the recent passage of men or beasts, progress was comparatively\neasy; but much more frequently, greatly to Dick's annoyance, obstacles\nof various sorts impeded their advance. Climbing plants grew in such\ninextricable confusion that they could only be compared to a ship's\nrigging involved in hopeless entanglement; there were creepers\nresembling curved scimitars, thickly covered with sharp thorns; there\nwere likewise strange growths, like vegetable serpents, fifty or sixty\nfeet long, which seemed to have a cruel faculty for torturing every\npassenger with their prickly spines. Axe in hand, the negroes had\nrepeatedly to cut their road through these bewildering obstructions\nthat clothed the trees from their summit to their base.\n\nAnimal life was no less remarkable in its way than the vegetation.\nBirds in great variety flitted about in the ample foliage, secure from\nany stray shot from the little band, whose chief object it was to\npreserve its incognito. Guinea-fowls were seen in considerable numbers,\nfrancolins in several varieties, and a few specimens of the bird to\nwhich the Americans, in imitation of their note, have given the name of\n\"whip-poor-will.\" If Dick had not had too much evidence in other ways\nto the contrary, he might almost have imagined himself in a province of\nthe New World.\n\nHitherto they had been unmolested by any dangerous wild beasts. During\nthe present stage of their march a herd of giraffes, startled by their\nunexpected approach, rushed fleetly past; this time, however, without\nbeing represented as ostriches. Occasionally a dense cloud of dust on\nthe edge of the prairie, accompanied by a sound like the roll of\nheavily-laden chariots, betokened the flight of a herd of buffaloes;\nbut with these exceptions no animal of any magnitude appeared in view.\n\n[Illustration: The march was continued with as much rapidity as was\nconsistent with caution.]\n\nFor about two miles Dick followed the course of the rivulet, in the\nhope that it would emerge into a more important stream, which would\nconvey them without much difficulty or danger direct to the sea.\n\nTowards noon about three miles had been accomplished, and a halt was\nmade for rest. Neither Negoro nor Harris had been seen, nor had Dingo\nreappeared. The encampment for the midday refreshment was made under\nthe shelter of a clump of bamboos, which effectually concealed them\nall. Few words were spoken during the meal. Mrs. Weldon could eat\nnothing; she had again taken her little boy into her arms, and seemed\nwholly absorbed in watching him. Again and again Dick begged her to\ntake some nourishment, urging upon her the necessity of keeping up her\nstrength.\n\n\"We shall not be long in finding a good current to carry us to the\ncoast,\" said the lad brightly.\n\nMrs. Weldon raised her eyes to his animated features. With so sanguine\nand resolute a leader, with such devoted servants as the five negroes\nin attendance, she felt that she ought not utterly to despair. Was she\nnot, after all, on friendly soil? what great harm could Harris\nperpetrate against her or her belongings? She would hope still, hope\nfor the best.\n\nRejoiced as he was to see something of its former brightness return to\nher countenance, Dick nevertheless had scarcely courage steadily to\nreturn her searching gaze. Had she known the whole truth, he knew that\nher heart must fail her utterly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nROUGH TRAVELLING.\n\n\nJust at this moment Jack woke up and put his arms round his mother's\nneck. His eyes were brighter, and there was manifestly no return of\nfever.\n\n\"You are better, darling!\" said Mrs. Weldon, pressing him tenderly to\nher.\n\n\"Yes, mamma, I am better; but I am very thirsty.\"\n\nSome cold water was soon procured, which the child drank eagerly, and\nthen began to look about him. His first inquiry was for his old\nfriends, Dick and Hercules, both of whom approached at his summons and\ngreeted him affectionately.\n\n\"Where is the horse?\" was the next question.\n\n\"Gone away, Master Jack; I am your horse now,\" said Hercules.\n\n\"But you have no bridle for me to hold,\" said Jack, looking rather\ndisappointed.\n\n\"You may put a bit in my mouth if you like, master Jack,\" replied\nHercules, extending his jaws, \"and then you may pull as hard as you\nplease.\"\n\n\"O, I shall not pull very hard,\" said Jack; \"but haven't we nearly come\nto Mr. Harris's farm?\"\n\nMrs. Weldon assured the child that they should soon be where they\nwanted to be, and Dick, finding that the conversation was approaching\ndangerous ground, proposed that the journey should be now resumed. Mrs.\nWeldon assented; the encampment was forthwith broken up and the march\ncontinued as before.\n\n[Illustration: It was a scene only too common in Central Africa]\n\nIn order not to lose sight of the watercourse, it was necessary to cut\na way right through the underwood: progress was consequently very slow;\nand a little over a mile was all that was accomplished in about three\nhours. Footpaths had evidently once existed, but they had all become\nwhat the natives term \"dead,\" that is, they had become entirely\novergrown with brushwood and brambles. The negroes worked away with a\nwill; Hercules, in particular, who temporarily resigned his charge to\nNan, wielded his axe with marvellous effect, all the time giving vent\nto stentorian groans and grunts, and succeeded in opening the woods\nbefore him as if they were being consumed by a devouring fire.\n\nFortunately this heavy labour was not of very long duration.\n\nAfter about a mile, an opening of moderate width, converging towards\nthe stream and following its bank, was discovered in the underwood. It\nwas a passage formed by elephants, which apparently by hundreds must be\nin the habit of traversing this part of the forest. The spongy soil,\nsoaked by the downpour of the rainy season, was everywhere indented\nwith the enormous impressions of their feet.\n\nBut it soon became evident that elephants were not the only living\ncreatures that had used this track. Human bones gnawed by beasts of\nprey, whole human skeletons, still wearing the iron fetters of slavery,\neverywhere strewed the ground. It was a scene only too common in\nCentral Africa, where like cattle driven to the slaughter, poor\nmiserable men are dragged in caravans for hundreds of weary miles, to\nperish on the road in countless numbers beneath the trader's lash, to\nsuccumb to the mingled horrors of fatigue, privation, and disease, or,\nif provisions fail, to be butchered, without pity or remorse, by sword\nand gun.\n\nThat slave-caravans had passed that way was too obvious to permit a\ndoubt. For at least a mile, at almost every step Dick came in contact\nwith the scattered bones; while ever and again huge goat suckers,\ndisturbed by the approach of the travellers, rose with flapping wings,\nand circled round their heads.\n\nThe youth's heart sank with secret dismay lest Mrs. Weldon should\ndivine the meaning of this ghastly scene, and appeal to him for\nexplanation, but fortunately she had again insisted on carrying her\nlittle patient, and although the child was fast asleep, he absorbed her\nwhole attention. Nan was by her side, almost equally engrossed. Old Tom\nalone was fully alive to the significance of his surroundings, and with\ndowncast eyes he mournfully pursued his march. Full of amazement, the\nother negroes looked right and left upon what might appear to them as\nthe upheaval of some vast cemetery, but they uttered no word of inquiry\nor surprise.\n\nMeantime the bed of the stream had increased both in breadth and depth,\nand the rivulet had in a degree lost its character of a rushing\ntorrent. This was a change which Dick Sands observed hopefully,\ninterpreting it as an indication that it might itself become navigable,\nor would empty itself into some more important tributary of the\nAtlantic. His resolve was fixed: he would follow its course at all\nhazards. As soon, therefore, as he found that the elephant's track was\nquitting the water's edge, he made up his mind to abandon it, and had\nno hesitation in again resorting to the use of the axe. Once more,\nthen, commenced the labour of cutting a way through the entanglement of\nbushes and creepers that were thick upon the soil. It was no longer\nforest through which they were wending their arduous path; trees were\ncomparatively rare; only tall clumps of bamboos rose above the grass,\nso high, however, that even Hercules could not see above them, and the\npassage of the little troop could only have been discovered by the\nrustling in the stalks.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon, the soil became soft and marshy. It was\nevident that the travellers were crossing plains that in a long rainy\nseason must be inundated. The ground was carpeted with luxuriant mosses\nand graceful ferns, and the continual appearance of brown hematite\nwherever there was a rise in the soil, betokened the existence of a\nrich vein of metal beneath.\n\nRemembering what he had read in Dr. Livingstone's account of these\ntreacherous swamps, Dick bade his companions take their footing warily.\nHe himself led the way. Tom expressed his surprise that the ground\nshould be so soaked when there had been no rain for some time.\n\n\"I think we shall have a storm soon,\" said Bat,\n\n\"All the more reason, then,\" replied Dick, \"why we should get away from\nthese marshes as quickly as possible. Carry Jack again, Hercules; and\nyou, Bat and Austin, keep close to Mrs. Weldon, so as to be able to\nassist her if she wants your help. But take care, take care, Mr.\nBenedict!\" he cried out in sudden alarm; \"what are you doing, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm slipping in,\" was poor Benedict's helpless reply. He had trodden\nupon a kind of quagmire and, as though a trap had been opened beneath\nhis feet, was fast disappearing into the slough. Assistance was\nimmediately rendered, and the unfortunate naturalist was dragged out,\ncovered with mud almost to his waist, but thoroughly satisfied because\nhis precious box of specimens had suffered no injury. Act\u00c3\u00a6on undertook\nfor the future to keep close to his side, and endeavour to avoid a\nrepetition of the mishap.\n\nThe accident could not be said to be altogether free from unpleasant\nconsequences. Air-bubbles in great numbers had risen to the surface of\nthe mire from which Benedict had been extricated, and as they burst\nthey disseminated an odious stench that was well-nigh intolerable. The\npassage of these pestilential districts is not unfrequently very\ndangerous, and Livingstone, who on several occasions waded through them\nin mud that reached to his breast, compares them to great sponges\ncomposed of black porous earth, in which every footstep causes streams\nof moisture to ooze out.\n\nFor well nigh half a mile they had now to wend their cautious way\nacross this spongy soil. Mrs. Weldon, ankle-deep in the soft mud, was\nat last compelled to come to a stand-still; and Hercules, Bat, and\nAustin, all resolved that she should be spared further discomfort, and\ninsisted upon weaving some bamboos into a litter, upon which, after\nmuch reluctance to become such a burden, she was induced, with Jack\nbeside her, to take her place.\n\nAfter the delay thus caused, the procession again started on its\nperilous route. Dick Sands continued to walk at the head, in order to\ntest the stability of the footing; Action followed, holding Cousin\nBenedict firmly by the arm; Tom took charge of old Nan, who without his\nsupport would certainly have fallen into the quagmire; and the three\nother negroes carried the litter in the rear. It was a matter of the\ngreatest difficulty to find a path that was sufficiently firm; the\nmethod they adopted was to pick their way as much as possible on the\nlong rank grass that on the margin of the swamps was tolerably tough;\nbut in spite of the greatest precaution, there was not one of them who\nescaped occasionally sinking up to his knees in slush.\n\nAt about five o'clock they were relieved by finding themselves on\nground of a more clayey character; it was still soft and porous below,\nbut its surface was hard enough to give a secure foothold. There were\nwatery pores that percolated the subsoil, and these gave evident\nwitness to the proximity of a river-district.\n\nThe heat would have been intolerably oppressive if it had not been\ntempered by some heavy storm-clouds which obstructed the direct\ninfluence of the sun's rays. Lightning was observed to be playing\nfaintly about the sky, and there was now and again the low growl of\ndistant thunder. The indications of a gathering storm were too manifest\nto be disregarded, and Dick could not help being very uneasy. He had\nheard of the extreme violence of African storms, and knew that torrents\nof rain, hurricanes that no tree could resist, and thunderbolt after\nthunderbolt were the usual accompaniment of these tempests. And here in\nthis lowland desert, which too surely would be completely inundated,\nthere would not be a tree to which they could resort for shelter, while\nit would likewise be utterly vain to hope to obtain a refuge by\nexcavation, as water would be found only two feet below the surface.\n\n[Illustration: Another brilliant flash brought the camp once again into\nrelief.]\n\nAfter scrutinizing the landscape, however, he noticed some low\nelevations on the north that seemed to form the boundary of the marshy\nplain. A few trees were scattered along their summits; if his party\ncould get no other shelter here, he hoped they would be able to find\nthemselves free from any danger caused by the rising flood.\n\n\"Push on, friends, push on!\" he cried; \"three miles more, and we shall\nbe out of this treacherous lowland.\"\n\nHis words served to inspire a fresh confidence, and in spite of all the\nprevious fatigue, every energy was brought into play with renewed\nvigour. Hercules, in particular, seemed ready to carry the whole party,\nif it had been in his power.\n\nThe storm was not long in beginning. The rising ground was still two\nmiles away. Although the sun was above the horizon, the darkness was\nalmost complete; the overhanging volumes of vapour sank lower and lower\ntowards the earth, but happily the full force of the deluge which must\nultimately come did not descend as yet. Lightning, red and blue,\nflashed on every side and appeared to cover the ground with a network\nof flame.\n\nEver and again the little knot of travellers were in peril of being\nstruck by the thunderbolts which, on that treeless plain, had no other\nobject of attraction. Poor little Jack, who had been awakened by the\nperpetual crashes, buried his face in terror in Hercules' breast,\nanxious, however, not to distress his mother by any outward exhibition\nof alarm. The good-natured negro endeavoured to pacify him by promises\nthat the lightning should not touch him, and the child, ever confident\nin the protection of his huge friend, lost something of his nervousness.\n\nBut it could not be long before the clouds would burst and discharge\nthe threatened down-pour.\n\n\"What are we to do, Tom?\" asked Dick, drawing up close to the negro's\nside.\n\n\"We must make a rush for it; push on with all the speed we can.\"\n\n\"But where?\" cried Dick.\n\n\"Straight on,\" was the prompt reply; \"if the rain catches us here on\nthe plain we shall all be drowned.\"\n\n\"But where are we to go?\" repeated Dick, in despair; \"if only there\nwere a hut! But look, look there!\"\n\nA vivid flash of lightning had lit up the country, and Dick declared\nthat he could see a camp which could hardly be more than a quarter of a\nmile ahead.\n\nThe negro looked doubtful.\n\n\"I saw it too,\" he assented: \"but if it be a camp at all it would be a\ncamp of natives; and to fall into that would involve us in a worse fate\nthan the rain.\"\n\nAnother brilliant flash brought the camp once again into relief; it\nappeared to be made up of about a hundred conical tents, arranged very\nsymmetrically, each of them being from twelve to fifteen feet in\nheight. It had the appearance, from a distance, of being deserted; if\nit were really so, it would afford just the shelter that was needed;\notherwise, at all hazards, it must be most carefully avoided.\n\n\"I will go in advance,\" said Dick, after a moment's reflection, \"and\nreconnoitre it.\"\n\n\"Let one of us, at least, go with you,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"No, stay where you are; I shall be much less likely to be discovered\nif I go alone.\"\n\nWithout another word, he darted off, and was soon lost in the sombre\ndarkness that was only broken by the frequent lightning.\n\nLarge drops of rain were now beginning to fall.\n\nTom and Dick had been walking some little distance in advance of the\nrest of the party, who consequently had not overheard their\nconversation. A halt being made, Mrs. Weldon inquired what was the\nmatter. Tom explained that a camp or village had been noticed a little\nway in front, and that the captain had gone forward to investigate it.\nMrs. Weldon asked no further questions, but quietly waited the result.\nIt was only a few minutes before Dick returned.\n\n\"You may come on,\" he cried.\n\n\"Is the camp deserted?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"It is not a camp at all; it is a lot of ant-hills!\"\n\n\"Ant-hills!\" echoed Benedict, suddenly aroused into a state of\nexcitement.\n\n[Illustration: One after another, the whole party made their way inside]\n\n\"No doubt of it, Mr. Benedict.\" replied Dick; \"they are ant-hills\ntwelve feet high at least: and I hope we shall be able to get into\nthem.\"\n\n\"Twelve feet!\" the naturalist repeated; \"they must be those of the\ntermites, the white ants; there is no other insect that could make\nthem. Wonderful architects are the termites.\"\n\n\"Termites, or whatever they are, they will have to turn out for us,\"\nsaid Dick.\n\n\"But they will eat us up!\" objected Benedict.\n\n\"I can't help that,\" retorted Dick; \"go we must, and go at once.\"\n\n\"But stop a moment,\" continued the provoking naturalist; \"stop, and\ntell me: I can't be wrong: I always thought that white ants could never\nbe found elsewhere than in Africa.\"\n\n\"Come along, sir, I say; come along, quick!\" shouted Dick, terrified\nlest Mrs. Weldon should have overheard him.\n\nThey hurried on. A wind had risen; large spattering drops were now\nbeginning to fall more heavily on the ground and in a few minutes it\nwould be impossible to stand against the advancing tempest. The nearest\nof the accumulation of ant-hills was reached in time, and however\ndangerous their occupants might be, it was decided either to expel\nthem, or to share their quarters. Each cone was formed of a kind of\nreddish clay, and had a single opening at its base. Hercules took his\nhatchet, and quickly enlarged the aperture till it would admit his own\nhuge body. Not an ant made its appearance. Cousin Benedict expressed\nhis extreme surprise. But the structure unquestionably was empty, and\none after another the whole party made their way inside.\n\nThe rain by this time was descending in terrific torrents, strong\nenough to extinguish, one would think, the most violent explosions of\nthe electric fluid. But the travellers were secure in their shelter,\nand had nothing to fear for the present; their tenement was of greater\nstability than a tent or a native hut. It was one of those marvellous\nstructures erected by little insects, which to Cameron appeared even\nmore wonderful than the upraising of the Egyptian pyramids by human\nhands. To use his own comparison, it might be likened to the\nconstruction of a Mount Everest, the loftiest of the Himalayan peaks,\nby the united labour of a nation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nWHITE ANTS.\n\n\nThe storm had now burst in full fury, and fortunate it was that a\nrefuge had been found. The rain did not fall in separate drops as in\ntemperate zones, but descended like the waters of a cataract, in one\nsolid and compact mass, in a way that could only suggest the outpour of\nsome vast aerial basin containing the waters of an entire ocean.\nContrary, too, to the storms of higher latitudes, of which the duration\nseems ordinarily to be in inverse ratio to their violence, these\nAfrican tempests, whatever their magnitude, often last for whole days,\nfurrowing the soil into deep ravines, changing plains to lakes and\nbrooks to torrents, and causing rivers to overflow and cover vast\ndistricts with their inundations. It is hard to understand whence such\nvolumes of vapour and electric fluid can accumulate. The earth, upon\nthese occasions, might almost seem to be carried back to the remote\nperiod which has been called \"the diluvian age.\"\n\nHappily, the walls of the ant-hill were very thick; no beaver-hut\nformed of pounded earth could be more perfectly water-tight, and a\ntorrent might have passed over it without a particle of moisture making\nits way through its substance.\n\nAs soon as the party had taken possession of the tenement, a lantern\nwas lighted, and they proceeded to examine the interior. The cone,\nwhich was about twelve feet high inside, was eleven feet wide at the\nbase, gradually narrowing to a sugar-loaf top. The walls and partitions\nbetween the tiers of cells were nowhere less than a foot thick\nthroughout.\n\nThese wonderful erections, the result of the combined labour of\ninnumerable insects, are by no means uncommon in the heart of Africa.\nSmeathman, a Dutch traveller of the last century, has recorded how he\nand four companions all at one time occupied the summit of one of them\nin Lound\u00c3\u00a9. Livingstone noticed some made of red clay, of which the\nheight varied from fifteen to twenty feet; and in Nyangw\u00c3\u00a9, Cameron\nseveral times mistook one of these colonies for a native camp pitched\nupon the plain. He described some of these strange edifices as being\nflanked with small spires, giving them the appearance of a\ncathedral-dome.\n\nThe reddish clay of which the ant-hill was composed could leave no\ndoubt upon the mind of a naturalist that it had been formed by the\nspecies known as \"termes bellicosus;\" had it been made of grey or black\nalluvial soil, it might have been attributed to the \"termes mordax\" or\n\"termes atrox,\" formidable names that must awaken anything but pleasure\nin the minds of all but enthusiast entomologists.\n\nIn the centre was an open space, surrounded by roomy compartments,\nranged one upon another, like the berths of a ship's cabin, and lined\nwith the millions of cells that had been occupied by the ants. This\ncentral space was inadequate to hold the whole party that had now made\ntheir hurried resort to it, but as each of the compartments was\nsufficiently capacious to admit one person to occupy it in a sitting\nposture, Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Nan, and Cousin Benedict were exalted to\nthe upper tier, Austin, Bat, and Act\u00c3\u00a6on occupied the next story, whilst\nTom and Hercules, and Dick Sands himself remained below.\n\nDick soon found that the soil beneath his feet was beginning to get\ndamp, and insisted upon having some of the dry clay spread over it from\nthe base of the cone.\n\n\"It is a long time,\" he said, \"since we have slept with a roof over our\nheads; and I am anxious to make our refuge as secure as possible. It\nmay be that we shall have to stay here for a whole day or more; on the\nfirst opportunity I shall go and explore; it may turn out that we are\nnear the stream we are seeking; and perhaps we shall have to build a\nraft before we start again.\"\n\n[Illustration: Cousin Benedict's curiosity was awakened.]\n\nUnder his direction, therefore, Hercules took his hatchet, and\nproceeded to break down the lowest range of cells and to spread the\ndry, brittle clay of which they were composed a good foot thick over\nthe damp floor, taking care not in any way to block up the aperture by\nwhich the fresh air penetrated into the interior.\n\nIt was indeed fortunate that the termites had abandoned their home; had\nit swarmed with its multitudes of voracious Neuroptera, the ant-hill\nwould have been utterly untenable for human beings. Cousin Benedict's\ncuriosity was awakened, and he was intensely interested in the question\nof the evacuation, so that he proceeded at once to investigate, if he\ncould, whether the emigration had been recent or otherwise. He took the\nlantern, and as the result of his scrutiny he soon discovered in a\nrecess what he described as the termites' \"storehouse,\" or the place\nwhere the indefatigable insects keep their provisions. It was a large\ncavity, not far from the royal cell, which, together with the cells for\nthe reception of the young larvae, had been destroyed by Hercules in\nthe course of his flooring operations. Out of this receptacle Benedict\ndrew a considerable quantity of gum and vegetable juices, all in a\nstate so liquid as to demonstrate that they had been deposited there\nquite recently.\n\n\"They have only just gone,\" he exclaimed, with an air of authority, as\nif he imagined that some one was about to challenge his assertion.\n\n\"We are not going to dispute your word, Mr. Benedict,\" said Dick; \"here\nwe are; we have taken their place, and shall be quite content for them\nto keep out of the way, without caring when they went, or where they\nhave gone.\"\n\n\"But we must care,\" retorted Benedict testily; \"why they have gone\nconcerns us a good deal; these juices make it evident, from the liquid\nstate in which we find them, that the ants were here this morning, they\nhave not only gone, but they have carried off their young larvae with\nthem; they have been sagacious enough to take warning of some impending\ndanger.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they heard that we were coming,\" said Hercules, laughing.\n\nA look of withering scorn was the only answer that the entomologist\ndeigned to give.\n\n\"Yes, I say,\" repeated Hercules, \"perhaps they heard that we were\ncoming.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Benedict contemptuously; \"do you imagine they would be\nafraid of you? they would reduce your carcase to a skeleton in no time,\nif they found it across their path.\"\n\n\"No doubt, if I were dead,\" replied Hercules, \"they could pick my bones\npretty clean; but while I had the use of my limbs I think I could crush\nthem by thousands.\"\n\n\"Thousands!\" ejaculated Benedict, with increasing warmth; \"you think\nyou could demolish thousands; but what if they were hundreds of\nthousands, millions, hundreds of millions? Alive as much as dead, I\ntell you, they wouldn't be long in consuming every morsel of you.\"\n\nDuring this brisk little discussion Dick Sands had been pondering over\nwhat Benedict had said. There was no doubt that the amateur naturalist\nwas well acquainted with the habits of white ants, and if, as he\naffirmed, the insects had instinctively quitted their abode on account\nof some approaching danger, Dick asked himself whether it was safe or\nprudent for his party to remain. But the fury of the storm was still so\ngreat that all possibility of removing from the shelter seemed\nprecluded for the present, and, without inquiring farther into the\nmystery, he merely said,\n\n\"Although the ants, Mr. Benedict, have left us their provisions, we\nmust not forget that we have brought our own. We will have our supper\nnow, and to-morrow, when the storm is over, we will see what is to be\ndone.\"\n\nFatigue had not taken away the appetite of the energetic travellers,\nand they gladly set about the preparation of their meal. The\nprovisions, of which they had enough for another two days, had not been\ninjured by the rain. For some minutes the crunching of hard biscuit was\nthe only sound to be heard; Hercules, in particular, seemed to pound\naway with his huge jaws as with a pair of millstones.\n\n[Illustration: The naturalist now fairly mounted on a favourite hobby.]\n\nMrs. Weldon was the only one of the party who ate little; and that\nlittle was only taken at Dick's earnest solicitation; he could not help\nnoticing, with much concern, that although Jack seemed to be\nsatisfactorily recovering, and, without sign of fever, was sleeping\ncalmly enough on a bed made up of clothes spread out in one of the\ncells, yet his mother had lost much of her courage, and seemed\npreoccupied and depressed.\n\nCousin Benedict did due honour to the simple evening repast; not on\naccount of its quantity or quality, but because it gave him an\nopportunity of holding forth upon the subject of termites. He was much\nvexed that he had been unable to discover a single specimen in the\ndeserted anthill with which he might illustrate his lecture, but\nnotwithstanding this deficiency he continued to talk, heedless whether\nany one was listening.\n\n\"They are wonderful insects,\" he said; \"they belong to the order of the\nNeuroptera, which have the antennae longer than the head; their\nmandibles are well-developed, and the inferior pair of wings is\ngenerally as large as the superior. There are five families of them;\nthe Panorpide, the Myrmellonide, the Hemerobiide, the Termitine, and\nthe Perlide. I need hardly say that what we are now occupying is a\ndwelling of the Termitine.\"\n\nAt this point Dick became all attention; he was anxious to ascertain\nwhether this discovery of white ants had aroused any suspicion in\nBenedict's mind that they must be on African soil. The naturalist, now\nfairly mounted on a favourite hobby, went on with his discourse.\n\n\"I am sorry not to have a specimen to show you, but these Termitine\nhave four joints in the tarsi, and strong horny mandibles. The family\nincludes, as genera, the Mantispa, the Raphidia, and the Termes, the\nlast commonly known as white ants, amongst which are 'Termes fatalis,\nTermes lucifugans, Termes mordax,' and several others more or less\nrare.\"\n\n\"And which of them built this ant-hill?\" inquired Dick.\n\n\"The bellicosi!\" replied Benedict, pronouncing the name with as much\npride as if he were eulogizing the Macedonians or some warlike nation\nof antiquity. \"Bellicosi,\" he continued, \"are to be found of every\nsize. There is as much difference between the largest and the smallest\nof them as there is between Hercules and a dwarf; the workers are about\none-fifth of an inch long; the soldiers, or fighting-ants, are half an\ninch; whilst the males and females measure four fifths of an inch.\nThere is another curious species, called 'sirafoos,' which are about\nhalf an inch long, and have pincers instead of mandibles, and heads\nlarger than their bodies, like sharks. In fact, if sharks and sirafoos\nwere placed in competition, I should be inclined to back the sharks.\"\n\n\"And where are these sirafoos most generally to be found?\" said Dick\ncautiously.\n\n\"In Africa, in the southern and central provinces. Africa may truly be\ntermed the land of ants. Livingstone, in the notes brought home by\nStanley, describes a battle which he was fortunate enough to witness\nbetween an army of black ants and an army of red. The black ants, or\ndrivers, which are what the natives call sirafoos, got the best of it;\nand the red ants, or 'tchoongoos,' after a very resolute defence, were\nobliged to retire defeated, carrying their eggs and young ones with\nthem. Livingstone avows that he never saw the warlike instinct so\nstrongly developed as in these sirafoos; the stoutest man, the largest\nanimal, a lion or an elephant, quails before the grip of their\nmandibles: no obstacle impedes their progress; no tree is too lofty for\nthem to scale, and they contrive to cross wide streams by forming their\nown bodies into a kind of suspension bridge. Equally amazing are their\nnumbers; Du Chaillu, another African traveller, relates how it took\nmore than twelve hours for a column of ants to file pass him, without a\nmoment's pause in their march. These numbers, however cease to be so\nsurprising when it is explained that their fecundity is such that a\nsingle female of the termites bellicosi has been estimated to produce\nas many as sixty thousand eggs a day. These Neuroptera furnish the\nnatives with a favourite food, grilled ants being considered a great\ndelicacy.\"\n\n\"Have you ever tasted them?\" asked Hercules, with a grin.\n\n\"Never,\" answered the naturalist; \"but I am in hopes I shall have a\nchance of doing so very soon.\"\n\n\"Surely you don't imagine yourself in Africa!\" said Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Africa! no; why should I?\" replied Benedict; \"but, as I have already\nseen a tzetsy in America, I do not despair of having the satisfaction\nof discovering white ants there too. You do not know the sensation I\nshall make in Europe when I publish my folio volume and its\nillustrations.\"\n\nIt was evident that no inkling of the truth had yet entered poor\nBenedict's brain, and it seemed likely that it would require\ndemonstration far more striking than any natural phenomena to undeceive\nthe minds of such of the party as were not already in possession of the\nfatal secret.\n\nAlthough it was nine o'clock, Cousin Benedict went on talking\nincessantly, regardless of the fact that one by one his audience were\nfalling to sleep in their separate cells. Dick Sands did not sleep, but\nneither did he interrupt the entomologist by farther questions;\nHercules kept up his attention longer than the rest, but at length he\ntoo succumbed to weariness, and his eyes and ears were closed to all\nexternal sights and sounds.\n\nBut endurance has limits, and at last Cousin Benedict, having worn\nhimself out, clambered up to the topmost cell of the cone, which he had\nchosen for his dormitory, and fell into a peaceful slumber.\n\nThe lantern had been already extinguished. All was darkness and silence\nwithin, whilst the storm without still raged with a violence that gave\nno sign of abatement.\n\nDick Sands himself was the only one of the party who was not partaking\nin the repose that was so indispensable to them all; but he could not\nsleep; his every thought was absorbed in the responsibility that rested\non him to rescue those under his charge from the dangers that\nthreatened them. Again and again he recalled every incident that had\noccurred since the loss of Captain Hull and his crew; he remembered the\noccasion when he had stood with his pistol pointed at Negoro's head;\nwhy, oh why, had his hand faltered then? why had he not at that moment\nhurled the miserable wretch overboard, and thus relieved himself and\nhis partners in trouble from the catastrophe that had since befallen\nthem? Peril was still staring them in the face, and his sole drop of\nconsolation in the bitter cup of despondency was that Mrs. Weldon was\nstill ignorant of their real situation.\n\nAt that moment, just in the fever of his agony, he felt a light breath\nupon his forehead; a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a gentle\nvoice murmured in his ear,--\n\n\"My poor boy, I know everything. God will help us! His will be done!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"My poor boy, I know everything.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nA DIVING-BELL.\n\n\nThis sudden revelation that Mrs. Weldon was acquainted with the true\nstate of things left Dick speechless. Even had he been capable of\nreplying, she gave him no opportunity, but immediately retired to the\nside of her son. The various incidents of the march had all gradually\nenlightened her, and perhaps the exclamation of Cousin Benedict on the\npreceding evening had crowned them all; anyhow the brave lady now knew\nthe worst. Dick felt, however, that she did not despair; neither would\nhe.\n\nHe lay and longed for the dawn, when he hoped to explore the situation\nbetter, and perchance to find the watercourse which he was convinced\ncould not be far distant. Moreover, he was extremely anxious to be out\nof the reach of the natives whom, it was only too likely, Negoro and\nHarris might be putting on their track.\n\nBut as yet no glimmer of daylight penetrated the aperture of the cone,\nwhilst the heavy rumblings, deadened as they were by the thickness of\nthe walls, made it certain that the storm was still raging with\nundiminished fury. Attentively Dick listened, and he could distinctly\nhear the rain beating around the base of the ant-hill; the heavy drops\nsplashed again as they fell, in a way altogether different to what they\nwould upon solid ground, so that he felt sure that the adjacent land\nwas by this time completely flooded. He was getting very drowsy when it\nsuddenly occurred to him that it was not unlikely the aperture was\ngetting blocked up with damp clay; in that case he knew that the breath\nof the inmates would quickly vitiate the internal atmosphere. He crept\nalong the ground and had the satisfaction of finding that the clay\nembankment was still perfectly dry; the orifice was quite unobstructed,\nallowing not only a free passage to the air, but admitting the glare of\nthe occasional flashes of lightning, which the descending volumes of\nwater did not seem to stay.\n\nHaving thus far satisfied himself that all was well, and that there was\nno immediate danger, Dick thought that he might now resign himself to\nsleep as well as the rest: he took the precaution, however, of\nstretching himself upon the embankment within easy reach of the\nopening, and with his head supported against the wall, after a while\ndozed off.\n\nHow long his light slumber had lasted he could not say, when he was\naroused by a sensation of cold. He started up, and to his horror\ndiscovered that the water had entered the ant-hill and was rising\nrapidly; it could not be long, he saw, before it reached the cells\nwhich were occupied by Hercules and Tom. He woke them at once, and told\nthem what he had observed. The lantern was soon lighted, and they set\nto work to ascertain what progress the water was making It rose for\nabout five feet, when it was found to remain stationary.\n\n\"What is the matter, Dick?\" inquired Mrs. Weldon, disturbed by the\nmovements of the men.\n\n\"Nothing very alarming,\" answered Dick promptly; \"only some water has\nfound its way into the lower part of the place; it will not reach your\nupper cells; probably some river has overflowed its boundaries.\"\n\n\"The very river, perhaps,\" suggested Hercules assuringly, \"that is to\ncarry us to the coast.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon made no reply.\n\nCousin Benedict was still sleeping as soundly as if he were himself a\nwhite ant; the negroes were peering down on to the sheet of water which\nreflected back the rays of the lantern, ready to carry out any orders\ngiven by Dick, who was quietly gauging the inundation, and removing the\nprovisions and fire-arms out of its reach.\n\n[Illustration: They set to work to ascertain what progress the water\nwas making.]\n\n\"Did the water get in at the opening, Mr. Dick?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Yes, Tom, and consequently we are coming to the end of our stock of\nfresh air,\" was Dick's reply.\n\n\"But why should we not make another opening above the water level?\" Tom\ninquired.\n\n\"A thing to be thought about,\" said Dick; \"but we have to remember that\nif we have five feet of water here inside, there is probably a depth of\nsix or seven outside. In rising here the flood has compressed the air,\nand made it an obstacle to further progress, but if we allow the air to\nescape, we may perhaps only be letting the water rise too high for our\nsafety. We are just as if we were in a diving-bell.\"\n\n\"Then what is to be done?\" asked the old negro.\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied Dick, \"we must proceed very cautiously. An\ninconsiderate step will jeopardize our lives.\" Dick Sands was quite\ncorrect in comparing the cone to an immersed diving-bell. In that\nmechanical contrivance, however, the air can always be renewed by means\nof pumps, so that it can be occupied without inconvenience beyond what\nis entailed by a somewhat confined atmosphere; but here the interior\nspace had already been reduced by a third part through the encroachment\nof the water, and there was no method of communicating with the outer\nair except by opening a new aperture, an operation in which there was\nmanifest danger.\n\nDick did not entertain the slightest apprehension that the ant-hill\nwould be carried away bodily by the inundation; he knew that it would\nadhere to its base as firmly as a beaver-hut; what he really dreaded\nwas that the storm would last so long that the flood would rise high\nabove the plain, perhaps submerging the ant-hill entirely, so that\nultimately all air would be expelled by the persistent pressure.\n\nThe more he pondered the more he felt himself driven to the conviction\nthat the inundation would be wide and deep. It could not be, he felt\nsure, entirely owing to the downpour from the clouds that the rapid\nflood was rising; there must have been the sudden overflowing of some\nstream to cause such a deluge over the low-lying plain. It could not be\nproved that the ant hill was not already under water, so that escape\nmight be no longer possible, even from its highest point.\n\nWith all Dick's courage, it was yet evident that he was very uneasy; he\ndid not know what to do, and asked himself again and again whether\npatient waiting or decisive action would be his more prudent course.\n\nIt was now about three o'clock in the morning. All within the ant-hill\nwere silent and motionless, listening to the incessant turmoil which\ntold that the strife of the elements had not yet ceased.\n\nPresently, old Tom pointed out that the height of the water was\ngradually increasing, but only by very slow ascent. Dick could only say\nthat if the flood continued to rise, however slowly, it must inevitably\ndrive out the air.\n\nAs if struck by a sudden thought, Bat called out,--\n\n\"Let me try and get outside. Perhaps I might dive and get through the\nopening.\"\n\n\"I think I had better make that experiment myself,\" answered Dick.\n\n\"That you never shall,\" interposed Tom peremptorily; \"you must let Bat\ngo. It may not be possible to get back, and your presence is\nindispensable here. Think, sir, think of Mrs. Weldon, and Master Jack,\"\nhe added in a lower tone.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Dick assented, \"if it must be so, Bat shall go.\"\n\nAnd turning to Bat, he continued,\n\n\"Do not try to come back again; we will try, if we can, to follow you\nthe same way; but if the top of the cone is still above water, knock\nhard on it with your hatchet, and we shall take it as a signal that we\nmay break our way out. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"All right!\" he said, \"all right, sir.\"\n\nAnd after wringing his father's hand, he drew a long breath, and\nplunged into the water that filled the lower section of the ant-hill.\n\nIt was an exploit that required considerable agility; the diver would\nhave to find the orifice, make his way through it, and, without loss of\na moment, let himself rise to the surface outside. Full half a minute\nelapsed, and Dick was making sure that the negro had been successful in\nhis effort, when his black head emerged from the water. There was a\ngeneral exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"It is blocked up,\" gasped Bat, as soon as he had recovered breath\nenough to speak.\n\n\"Blocked up?\" cried Tom.\n\n\"Yes,\" Bat affirmed; \"I have felt all round the wall very carefully\nwith my hand, and I am sure there is no hole left; I suppose the water\nhas dissolved the clay.\"\n\n\"If you cannot find a hole,\" exclaimed Hercules, \"I can very soon make\none;\" and he was just about to plunge his hatchet into the side of the\nant-hill, when Dick prevented him.\n\n\"Stop, stop! you must not be in such a hurry!\"\n\nHe reflected for a few moments, and went on,--\n\n\"We must be cautious; an impetuous step may be destruction; perhaps the\nwater is over the top; if it is allowed to enter, then at once is an\nend of all.\"\n\n\"But whatever we do,\" urged Tom, \"must be done at once; there is no\ntime to lose.\"\n\nHe was right; the water had risen till it was quite six feet deep; none\nbut Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Nan, and Cousin Benedict, who were lodged in the\nupper cells, were fairly above its surface.\n\nDick now came to his determination. At about a foot above the\nwater-level, that is, about seven feet from the ground, he resolved to\nbore a hole through the clay. If he should find himself in\ncommunication with the open air, he would have the proof he desired\nthat the top of the cone was still uncovered; if, on the other hand, he\nshould ascertain that he had pierced the wall below the surface of the\nexternal water, he would be prepared to plug up the hole\ninstantaneously, and repeat the experiment higher up. It was true that\nthe inundation might have risen even fifteen feet above the plain; in\nthat case the worst had come, and there was no alternative but that\nthey must all die of asphyxia.\n\nCarefully considering the chances of his undertaking, Dick calmly and\nsteadily set about his task. The best instrument that suggested itself\nfor his purpose was the ramrod of a gun, which, having a sort of\ncorkscrew at the end for extracting the wadding, would serve as an\nauger. The hole would be very small, but yet large enough for the\nrequisite test. Hercules showed him all the light he could by holding\nup the lantern. There were several candles left, so that they were not\nin fear of being altogether in darkness.\n\nThe operation hardly took a minute; the ramrod passed through the clay\nwithout difficulty; a muffled sound was distinguished as of air-bubbles\nrushing through a column of water. As the air escaped, the water in the\ncone rose perceptibly. The hole had been pierced too low. A handful of\nclay was immediately forced into the orifice, which was thus\neffectually plugged; and Dick turned round quietly, and said,--\n\n\"We must try again.\"\n\nThe water had again become stationary, but its last rise had diminished\nthe amount of breathing space by more than eight inches. The supply of\noxygen was beginning to fail, respiration was becoming difficult, and\nthe flame of the candle burned red and dim.\n\nAbout a foot higher than the first hole, Dick now set about boring a\nsecond. The experiment might again prove a failure, and the water rise\nyet higher in the cone; but the risk must be run.\n\nJust as the auger was being inserted, a loud exclamation of delight was\nheard proceeding from Cousin Benedict's cell. Dick paused, and Hercules\nturned the lantern towards the excited naturalist, who seemed beaming\nwith satisfaction.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I see it all well enough,\" he cried; \"I know now why the\ntermites left their home; they were wide-awake; they were more clever\nthan we are; they knew that the storm was coming!\"\n\nFinding that this was all the worthy entomologist had to communicate,\nDick, without comment, turned back again to his operation. Again the\ngurgling noise! again the water's upward rush! For the second time he\nhad failed to effect an aperture to the outer air!\n\n[Illustration: All fired simultaneously at the nearest boat.]\n\nThe situation was to the last degree alarming. The water had all but\nreached Mrs. Weldon, and she was obliged to take her boy into her arms.\nEvery one felt nearly stifled. A loud singing was heard in the ears,\nand the lantern showed barely any light at all. A few minutes more and\nthe air would be incapable of supporting life. One chance alone\nremained. They must bore another hole at the very summit of the cone.\nNot that they were unaware of the imminent danger of this measure, for\nif the ant-hill were really submerged the water from below would\nimmediately expel the remaining air and death must be instantaneous. A\nfew brief words from Dick explained the emergency of the crisis. Mrs.\nWeldon recognized the necessity,--\n\n\"Yes, Dick, do it; there is nothing else to be done.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking the light flickered out, and they were in total\ndarkness.\n\nMounted on the shoulders of Hercules, who was crouching in one of the\nside-cells, his head only just above water, Dick proceeded to force the\nramrod into the clay, which at the vertex of the ant-hill was\nconsiderably harder and thicker than elsewhere.\n\nA strange mingling of hope and fear thrilled through Dick Sands as he\napplied his hand to make the opening which was to admit life and air,\nor the flood of death!\n\nThe silence of the general expectation was broken by the noise of a\nsharp hissing; the water rose for eight inches, but all at once it\nceased to rise; it had found its level. No need this time to close the\norifice; the top of the ant-hill was higher than the top of the flood;\nand for the present, at least, they could all rejoice that their lives\nwere spared!\n\nA general cheer, led by the stentorian voice of Hercules, involuntarily\nbroke from the party; cutlasses were brought into action, and the clay\ncrumbled away beneath the vigorous assault that was made upon it. The\nwelcome air was admitted through the new-made aperture, bringing with\nit the first rays of the rising sun. The summit of the ant-hill once\nremoved, it would be quite easy to clamber to the top, whence it was\nhoped they would soon get away to some high ground out of reach of the\nflood.\n\nDick was the first to mount the summit; but a cry of dismay burst from\nhis lips!\n\nA sound only too well known to travellers in Africa broke upon his ear;\nthat sound was the whizzing of arrows.\n\nHardly a hundred yards away was a large encampment; whilst, in the\nwater, quite close to the ant-hill where he stood, he saw some long\nboats full of natives. From one of these had come the volley of arrows\nwhich had greeted his appearance above the opening of the cone.\n\nTo tell his people what had happened was the work of a moment. He\nseized his gun, and made Hercules, Bat, and Act\u00c3\u00a6on take theirs, and all\nfired simultaneously at the nearest boat. Several of the natives were\nseen to fall; but shouts of defiance were raised, and shots were fired\nin return.\n\nResistance was manifestly useless. What could they do against a hundred\nnatives? they were assailed on every hand. In accordance with what\nseemed a preconcerted plan, they were carried off from the ant-hill\nwith brutal violence, in two parties, without the chance of a farewell\nword or sign.\n\nDick Sands saw that Mrs. Weldon, Jack, and Cousin Benedict were placed\non board one boat, and were conveyed towards the camp, whilst he\nhimself, with the five negroes and old Nan, was forced into another,\nand taken in a different direction. Twenty natives formed a body-guard\naround them, and five boats followed in their rear.\n\nUseless though it were, Dick and the negroes made one desperate attempt\nto maintain their freedom; they wounded several of their antagonists,\nand would doubtless have paid their lives as a penalty for their\ndaring, if there had not been special orders given that they should be\ntaken alive.\n\nThe passage of the flood was soon accomplished. The boat had barely\ntouched the shore, when Hercules with a tremendous bound sprang on to\nthe land. Instantly two natives rushed upon him. The giant clave their\nskulls with the butt end of his gun, and made off. Followed though he\nwas by a storm of bullets, he escaped in safety, and disappeared\nbeneath the cover of the woods.\n\n[Illustration: The giant clave their skulls with the butt end of his\ngun.]\n\nDick Sands and the others were guarded to the shore, and fettered like\nslaves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nA SLAVE CARAVAN.\n\n\nThe storm of the previous night, by swelling the tributaries of the\nCoanza, had caused the main river to overflow its banks. The inundation\nhad entirely changed the aspect of the country, transforming the plain\ninto a lake, where the peaks of a number of ant-hills were the sole\nobjects that emerged above the watery expanse.\n\nThe Coanza, which is one of the principal rivers of Angola, falls into\nthe Atlantic about a hundred miles from the spot at which the \"Pilgrim\"\nwas stranded. The stream, which a few years later was crossed by\nCameron on his way to Benguela, seems destined to become the chief\nhighway of traffic between Angola and the interior; steamers already\nply upon its lower waters, and probably ten years will not elapse\nbefore they perform regular service along its entire course.\n\nDick Sands had been quite right in searching northwards for the\nnavigable stream he had been so anxious to find; the rivulet he had\nbeen following fell into the Coanza scarce a mile away, and had it not\nbeen for this unexpected attack he and his friends might reasonably\nhave hoped to descend the river upon a raft, until they reached one of\nthe Portuguese forts where steam vessels put in. But their fate was\nordered otherwise.\n\nThe camp which Dick had descried from the ant-hill was pitched upon an\neminence crowned by an enormous sycamore-fig, one of those giant trees\noccasionally found in Central Africa, of which the spreading foliage\nwill shelter some five hundred men. Some of the non-fruit-bearing kind\nof banyan-trees formed the background of the landscape.\n\nBeneath the shelter of the sycamore, the caravan which had been\nreferred to in the conversation between Negoro and Harris had just made\na halt. Torn from their villages by the agents of the slave-dealer\nAlvez, the large troop of natives was on its way to the market of\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, thence to be sent as occasion required either to the west\ncoast, or to Nyangw\u00c3\u00a9, in the great lake district, to be dispersed into\nUpper Egypt or Zanzibar.\n\nImmediately on reaching the camp, the four negroes and old Nan were\nplaced under precisely the same treatment as the rest of the captives.\nIn spite of a desperate resistance, they were deprived of their\nweapons, and fastened two and two, one behind another, by means of a\npole about six feet long, forked at each end, and attached to their\nnecks by an iron bolt. Their arms were left free, that they might carry\nany burdens, and in order to prevent an attempt to escape a heavy chain\nwas passed round their waists. It was thus in single file, unable to\nturn either right or left, they would have to march hundreds of miles,\ngoaded along their toilsome road by the havildar's whip. The lot of\nHercules seemed preferable, exposed though undoubtedly he would be in\nhis flight to hunger, and to the attacks of wild beasts, and to all the\nperils of that dreary country. But solitude, with its worst privations,\nwas a thing to be envied in comparison to being in the hands of those\npitiless drivers, who did not speak a word of the language of their\nvictims, but communicated with them only by threatening gestures or by\nactual violence.\n\nAs a white man, Dick was not attached to any other captive. The drivers\nwere probably afraid to subject him to the same treatment as the\nnegroes, and he was left unfettered, but placed under the strict\nsurveillance of a havildar. At first he felt considerable surprise at\nnot seeing Harris or Negoro in the camp, as he could not entertain a\ndoubt that it was at their instigation the attack had been made upon\ntheir retreat; but when he came to reflect that Mrs. Weldon, Jack, and\nCousin Benedict had not been allowed to come with them, but had been\ncarried off in some other direction, he began to think it probable that\nthe two rascals had some scheme to carry out with regard to them\nelsewhere.\n\nThe caravan consisted of nearly eight hundred, including about five\nhundred slaves of both sexes, two hundred soldiers and freebooters, and\na considerable number of havildars and drivers, over whom the agents\nacted as superior officers.\n\nThese agents are usually of Portuguese or Arab extraction; and the\ncruelties they inflict upon the miserable captives are almost beyond\nconception; they beat them continually, and if any unfortunate slave\nsinks from exhaustion, or in any way becomes unfit for the market, he\nis forthwith either stabbed or shot. As the result of this brutality it\nrarely happens that fifty per cent of the slaves reach their\ndestination; some few may contrive to escape, and many are left as\nskeletons along the line of route.\n\nSuch of the agents as are Portuguese are (as it may well be imagined)\nof the very lowest dregs of society, outlaws, escaped criminals, and\nmen of the most desperate character; of this stamp were the associates\nof Negoro and Harris, now in the employ of Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Alvez, one of\nthe most notorious of all the slave-dealers of Central Africa, and of\nwhom Commander Cameron has given some curious information.\n\nMost frequently the soldiers who escort the captives are natives hired\nby the dealers, but they do not possess the entire monopoly of the\nforays made for the purpose of securing slaves; the native negro kings\nmake war upon each other with this express design, and sell their\nvanquished antagonists, men, women, and children, to the traders for\ncalico, guns, gunpowder and red beads; or in times of famine, according\nto Livingstone, even for a few grains of maize.\n\nThe escort of old Alvez' caravan was an average specimen of these\nAfrican soldiers. It was simply a horde of half-naked banditti,\ncarrying old flint-locked muskets, the barrels of which were decorated\nwith copper rings. The agents are very often put to their wits' end to\nknow how to manage them; their orders are called in question, halts are\ncontinually demanded, and in order to avert desertion they are\nfrequently obliged to yield to the obstreperous will of their\nundisciplined force.\n\nAlthough the slaves, both male and female, are compelled to carry\nburdens whilst on their march, a certain number of porters, called\n_pagazis_, is specially engaged to carry the more valuable merchandize,\nand principally the ivory. Tusks occasionally weigh as much as 160\nlbs., and require two men to carry them to the d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4ts, whence they are\nsent to the markets of Khartoom, Natal, and Zanzibar. On their arrival\nthe _pagazis_ are paid by the dealers according to contract, which is\ngenerally either by about twenty yards of the cotton stuff known as\n_merikani_, or by a little powder, by a handful or two of cowries, by\nsome beads, or if all these be scarce, they are paid by being allotted\nsome of the slaves who are otherwise unsalable.\n\nAmong the five hundred slaves in the caravan, very few were at all\nadvanced in years. The explanation of this circumstance was that\nwhenever a raid is made, and a village is set on fire, every inhabitant\nabove the age of forty is mercilessly massacred or hung upon the\nneighbouring trees; only the children and young adults of both sexes\nare reserved for the market, and as these constitute only a small\nproportion of the vanquished, some idea may be formed of the frightful\ndepopulation which these vast districts of Equinoctial Africa are\nundergoing.\n\nNothing could be more pitiable than the condition of this miserable\nherd. All alike were destitute of clothing, having nothing on them but\na few strips of the stuff known as _mbuza_, made from the bark of\ntrees; many of the women were covered with bleeding wounds from the\ndrivers' lashes, and had their feet lacerated by the constant friction\nof the road, but in addition to other burdens were compelled to carry\ntheir own emaciated children; young men, too, there were who had lost\ntheir voices from exhaustion, and who, to use Livingstone's expression,\nhad been reduced to \"ebony skeletons\" by toiling under the yoke of the\nfork, which is far more galling than the galley-chain. It was a sight\nthat might have moved the most stony-hearted, but yet there was no\nsymptom of compassion on the part of those Arab and Portuguese drivers\nwhom Cameron pronounces \"worse than brutes.\"[1]\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Cameron says, \"In order to obtain the fifty women of whom\nAlvez is the owner, ten villages, containing altogether a population of\nnot less than 1500, were totally destroyed. A few of the inhabitants\ncontrived to escape, but the majority either perished in the flames,\nwere slain in defending their families, or were killed by hunger or\nwild beasts in the jungle.... The crimes which are perpetuated in\nAfrica, by men who call themselves Christians, seem incredible to the\ninhabitants of civilized countries. It is impossible that the\ngovernment at Lisbon can be aware of the atrocities committed by those\nwho boast of being subject to her flag.\" _Tour du Monde_.\n\nN.B.--Against these assertions of Cameron, loud protestations have been\nmade in Portugal.]\n\n\nThe guard over the prisoners was so strict that Dick Sands felt it\nwould be utterly useless for him to make any attempt to seek for Mrs.\nWeldon. She and her son had doubtless been carried off by Negoro, and\nhis heart sank when he thought of the dangers to which too probably she\nwould be exposed. Again and again he repeated his reproaches on himself\nthat he had ever allowed either Negoro or Harris to escape his hands.\nNeither Mrs. Weldon nor Jack could expect the least assistance from\nCousin Benedict; the good man was barely able to consult for himself.\nAll three of them would, he conjectured, be conveyed to some remote\ndistrict of Angola; the poor mother, like some miserable slave, would\ninsist upon carrying her own sick son until her strength failed her,\nand, exhausted by her endurances, she sank down helpless on the way.\n\nA prisoner, and powerless to help! the very thought was itself a\ntorture to poor Dick. Even Dingo was gone! It would have been a\nsatisfaction to have had the dog to send off upon the track of the lost\nones. One only hope remained. Hercules still was free. All that human\nstrength could attempt in Mrs. Weldon's behalf, Hercules would not fail\nto try. Perhaps, too, under cover of the night, it was not altogether\nimprobable that the stalwart negro would mingle with the crowd of\nnegroes (amongst whom his dark skin would enable him to pass\nunnoticed), and make his way to Dick himself; then might not the two\ntogether elude the vigilance of the watch? might they not follow after\nand overtake Mrs. Weldon in the forest? would they not perchance be\nable either by stealth or by force to liberate her, and once free they\nwould effect an escape to the river, and finally accomplish the\nundertaking in which they had been so lamentably frustrated. Such were\nthe sanguine visions in which Dick permitted himself to indulge; his\ntemperament overcame all tendency to despair, and kept him alive to the\nfaintest chance of deliverance.\n\nThe next thing of importance was to ascertain the destination of the\ncaravan. It was a matter of the most serious moment whether the convoy\nof slaves were going to be carried to one of the d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4ts of Angola, or\nwhether they were to be sent hundreds of miles into the interior to\nNyangwe, in the heart of the great lake district that Livingstone was\nthen exploring. To reach the latter spot would occupy some months, and\nto return thence to the coast, even if they should be fortunate enough\nto regain their liberty, would be a work of insuperable difficulty.\n\nHe was not long left in suspense. Although he could not understand the\nhalf-African, half-Arab dialect that was used by the leaders of the\ncaravan, he noticed that the word Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 occurred very frequently,\nand knowing it as the name of an important market in the province, he\nnaturally concluded that it was there the slaves were to be disposed\nof; whether for the advantage of the king of the district, or of one of\nthe rich traders, he had no means of telling. Unless his geographical\nknowledge was at fault, he was aware that Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 must be about 400\nmiles from S. Paul de Loanda, and consequently that it could hardly be\nmore than 250 miles from the part of the Coanza where they were now\nencamped. Under favourable circumstances it was a journey that could\nnot be accomplished in less than twelve or fourteen days, but allowing\nfor the retarded progress of a caravan already exhausted by a\nlengthened march, Dick was convinced that they could not reach the\nplace for at least three weeks.\n\nHe was most anxious to communicate to his companions in adversity his\nimpression that they were not to be carried into the heart of the\ncountry, and began to cogitate whether some plan could not be devised\nfor exchanging a few words with them.\n\nForked together, as it has been said, two and two, the four negroes\nwere at the right-hand extremity of the camp; Bat attached to his\nfather, Austin to Act\u00c3\u00a6on. A havildar, with twelve soldiers, formed\ntheir guard. Dick, at first, was about fifty yards away from the group,\nbut being left free to move about, contrived gradually to diminish the\ndistance between himself and them. Tom seemed to apprehend his\nintention, and whispered a word to his companions that they should be\non the look-out. Without moving they were all on their guard in a\nmoment. Dick, careful to conceal his design, strolled backward with a\nfeigned indifference, and succeeded in getting so near that he might\nhave called out and informed Tom that they were going to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. But\nhe was desirous of accomplishing more than this; he wanted to get an\nopportunity of having some conversation as to their future plans, and\nhe ventured to approach still nearer. His heart beat high as he\nbelieved he was on the point of attaining his object, when all at once\nthe havildar, becoming aware of his design, rushed upon him like a\nmadman, summoned some soldiers, and with considerable violence sent him\nback to the front. Tom and the others were quickly removed to another\npart of the encampment.\n\nExasperated by the rough attack that was made upon him, Dick had seized\nthe havildar's gun and broken it, almost wrenching it from his hands,\nwhen several soldiers simultaneously assailed him, and would have\nstruck him down and killed him upon the spot, had not one of the\nchiefs, an Arab of huge stature and ferocious countenance, interfered\nto stop them.\n\nThis Arab was the Ibn Hamish of whom Harris had spoken to Negoro. He\nsaid a few words which Dick could not understand, and the soldiers,\nwith manifest reluctance, relaxed their hold and retired. It was\nevident that although Dick was not to be permitted to hold any\ncommunication with the rest of his party, orders had been given that\nhis life was to be protected.\n\n[Illustration: The start was made.]\n\nIt was now nine o'clock, and the beating of drums and the blowing of\ncoodoo[1] horns gave the signal that the morning march was to be\ncontinued. Instantly chiefs, soldiers, porters, and slaves were upon\ntheir feet, and arranged themselves in their various groups with a\nhavildar bearing a bright-coloured banner at their head.\n\n\n[Footnote: Coodoo, a ruminant common in Africa.]\n\n\nThe order was given; the start was made. A strange song was heard\nrising in the air. It was a song, not of the victors, but of the\nvanquished. The slaves were chanting an imprecation on their\noppressors; and the burden of the chorus was that captured, tortured,\nslain--after death they would return and avenge their wrongs upon their\nmurderers!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nNOTES BY THE WAY.\n\n\nThe storm of the preceding evening had now passed away, but the sky was\nstill cloudy and the weather far from settled. It was the 19th of\nApril, the time of the _masika_, or second period of the rainy season,\nso that for the next two or three weeks the nights might be expected to\nbe wet.\n\nOn leaving the banks of the Coanza the caravan proceeded due east.\nSoldiers marched at the head and in the rear, as well as upon the\nflanks of the troop; any escape of the prisoners, therefore, even if\nthey had not been loaded with their fetters, would have been utterly\nimpossible. They were all driven along without any attempt at order,\nthe havildars using their whips unsparingly upon them whenever they\nshowed signs of flagging. Some poor mothers could be seen carrying two\ninfants, one on each arm, whilst others led by the hand naked children,\nwhose feet were sorely cut by the rough ground over which they had trod.\n\nIbn Hamish, the Arab who had interfered between Dick and the havildar,\nacted as commander to the caravan, and was here, there, and everywhere;\nnot moved in the least by the sufferings of the captives, but obliged\nto be attentive to the importunities of the soldiers and porters, who\nwere perpetually clamouring for extra rations, or demanding an\nimmediate halt. Loud were the discussions that arose, and the uproar\nbecame positively deafening when the quarrelsome voices rose above the\nshrieks of the slaves, many of whom found themselves treading upon soil\nalready stained by the blood of the ranks in front.\n\n[Illustration: If ever the havildar strolled a few yards away, Bat took\nthe opportunity of murmuring a few words of encouragement to this poor\nold father.]\n\nNo chance again opened for Dick to get any communication with his\nfriends, who had been sent to the van of the procession. Urged on by\nthe whip they continued to march in single file, their heads in the\nheavy forks. If ever the havildar strolled a few yards away, Bat took\nthe opportunity of murmuring a few words of encouragement to his poor\nold father, while he tried to pick out the easiest path for him, and to\nrelax the pace to suit his enfeebled limbs. Large tears rolled down old\nTom's cheeks when he found that his son's efforts only resulted in\nbringing down upon his back some sharp cuts of the havildar's whip.\nAct\u00c3\u00a6on and Austin, subject to hardly less brutality, followed a few\nsteps behind, but all four could not help feeling envious at the luck\nof Hercules, who might have dangers to encounter, but at least had his\nliberty.\n\nImmediately upon their capture, Tom had revealed to his companions the\nfact that they were in Africa, and informing them how they had been\nbetrayed by Harris, made them understand that they had no mercy to\nexpect.\n\nOld Nan had been placed amongst a group of women in the central ranks.\nShe was chained to a young mother with two children, the one at the\nbreast, the other only three years old, and scarcely able to walk.\nMoved by compassion, Nan took the little one into her own arms, thus\nnot only saving it from fatigue, but from the blows it would very\nlikely have received for lagging behind. The mother shed tears of\ngratitude, but the weight was almost too much for Nan's strength, and\nshe felt as if she must break down under her self-imposed burden. She\nthought fondly of little Jack, and imagining him borne along in the\narms of his weary mother, could not help asking herself whether she\nshould ever see him or her kind mistress again.\n\nFar in the rear, Dick could not see the head of the caravan except\noccasionally, when the ground was rather on the rise. The voices of the\nagents and drivers, harsh and excited as they were, scarcely roused him\nfrom his melancholy reflections. His thoughts were not of himself nor\nof his own sufferings; his whole attention was absorbed in looking for\nsome traces of Mrs. Weldon's progress; if she, too, was being taken to\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, her route must also lie this way. But he could discover no\ntrace of her having been conducted by this line of march, and could\nonly hope that she was being spared the cruelties which he was himself\nwitnessing.\n\nThe forest extended for about twenty miles to the east of the Coanza,\nbut whether it was that the trees had been destroyed by the ravages of\ninsects, or broken down before they had made their growth by being\ntrampled on by elephants, they were growing much less thickly than in\nthe immediate vicinity of the river. There were numbers of\ncotton-trees, seven or eight feet high, from which are manufactured the\nblack-and-white striped stuffs that are worn in the interior of the\nprovince; but, upon the whole, progress was not much impeded either by\nshrubs or underwood. Occasionally the caravan plunged into jungles of\nreeds like bamboos, their stalks an inch in diameter, so tall that only\nan elephant or giraffe could have reared above them, and through which\nnone excepting such as had a very intimate knowledge of the country\ncould possibly have made their way.\n\nStarting every morning at daybreak they marched till noon, when an\nhour's halt was made. Packets of manioc were then unfastened, and doled\nout in sparing quantities among the slaves; sometimes, when the\nsoldiers had plundered some village, a little goat's flesh or some\nsweet potatoes were added to the meal; but generally the fatigue,\naggravated by inadequate rest, took away the appetite, and when\nmeal-time arrived many of the slaves could hardly eat at all. During\nthe first eight days' march from the Coanza no less than twenty\nunfortunate wretches had fallen upon the road, and had been left\nbehind, a prey to the lions, panthers, and leopards that prowled in the\nwake. As Dick heard their roars in the stillness of the night, he\ntrembled as he thought of Hercules. Nevertheless, had the opportunity\noffered itself, he would not for a moment have hesitated in making his\nown escape to the wilderness.\n\n[Illustration: The caravan had been attacked on the flank by a dozen or\nmore crocodiles.]\n\nThe two hundred and fifty miles between the river and Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 were\naccomplished in what the traders call marches of ten miles each,\nincluding the halts at night and midday. The journey cannot be better\ndescribed than by a few rough notes that Dick Sands made upon his way.\n\n_April 25th_.--Saw a village surrounded with bamboo palisading, eight\nor nine feet high. Fields round planted with maize, beans, and sorghum.\nTwo negroes captured, fifteen killed, rest took to flight.\n\n_26th_.--Crossed a torrent 150 yards wide. Bridge formed of trunks of\ntrees and creepers. Piles nearly gave way; two women fastened to a\nfork; one of them, carrying a baby, fell into the water. Water quickly\ntinged with blood; crocodiles seen under bridge; risk of stepping into\ntheir very jaws.\n\n_28th_.--Crossed a forest of bauhinias; great trees, the iron-wood of\nthe Portuguese. Heavy rain; ground sodden; marching difficult. Caught\nsight of Nan in the middle of caravan; she was toiling along with a\nblack child in her arms; the woman with her limping, and blood\ntrickling from her shoulder.\n\n_29th_.--Camp at night under a huge baobab, with white flowers and\nlight green leaves. Lions and leopards roaring all night. A soldier\nfired at a panther. What has become of Hercules?\n\n_30th_.--Rainy season said to be over till November. First touch of\nAfrican winter. Dew very heavy. Plains all flooded. Easterly winds:\ndifficulty of respiration; susceptibility to fever. No trace of Mrs.\nWeldon; cannot tell whether she is ahead. Fear Jack may have a return\nof fever.\n\n_May 5th_.--Forced to march several stages across flooded plains, water\nup to the waist; many leeches sticking to the skin. Lotus and papyrus\nupon higher ground. Great heavy leaves, like cabbages, beneath the\nwater, make many stumble as they walk. Saw large numbers of little\nfish, silurus-species; these are caught by the natives, and sold to the\ncaravans.\n\n_7th_.--Plain still inundated. Last night, no halting-place to be\nfound. Marched on through the darkness. Great misery. Except for Mrs.\nWeldon, life not worth having; for her sake must hold out. Loud cries\nheard. Saw, by the lightning, soldiers breaking large boughs from the\nresinous trees that emerged from the water. The caravan had been\nattacked on the flank by a dozen or more crocodiles; women and children\nseized and carried off to what Livingstone calls their \"pasture-lands,\"\nthe holes where they deposit their prey until it is decomposed. Myself\ngrazed by the scales of one of them. A slave close beside me torn out\nof the fork, which was snapped in half. How the poor fellow's cry of\nagony rings in my ear! This morning, twenty missing. Tom and the\nothers, thank God! are still alive. They are on in front. Once Bat made\na sharp turn, and Tom caught sight of me. Nothing to be seen of Nan;\nwas she, poor creature, one of those that the crocodiles had got?\n\n_8th_.--After twenty-four hours in the water we have crossed the plain.\nWe have halted on a hill. The sun helps to dry us. Nothing to eat\nexcept a little manioc and a few handfuls of maize. Only muddy water to\ndrink. Impossible for Mrs. Weldon to survive these hardships; I hope\nfrom my heart that she has been taken some other way. Small-pox has\nbroken out in the caravan; those that have it are to be left behind.\n\n_9th_.--Started at dawn. No stragglers allowed; sick and weary must be\nkept together by havildars' whip; the losses were considerable. Living\nskeletons all round. Rejoiced once more to catch sight of Nan. She was\nnot carrying the child any longer; she was alone; the chain was round\nher waist, but she had the loose end thrown over her shoulder. I got\nclose to her; suppose I am altered, as she did not know me. After I had\ncalled her by name several times she stared at me, and at last said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Dick, is it you? you will not see me here much longer.\" Her\ncadaverous look pained my very soul, but I tried to speak hopefully.\nPoor Nan shook her head. \"I shall never see my dear mistress again; no,\nnor master Jack; I shall soon die.\" Anxious to help her, I would gladly\nhave carried the end of the chain which she had been obliged to bear\nbecause her fellow-prisoner was dead. A rough hand was soon upon my\nshoulder; a cruel lash had made Nan retreat to the general crowd,\nwhilst, at the bidding of an Arab chief, I was hustled back to the very\nhindmost rank of the procession. I overheard the word Negoro, in a way\nthat convinced me that it is under the direction of the Portuguese that\nI am subject to this hard indignity.\n\n[Illustration: [**no caption, or it is cut off]]\n\n_11th_.--Last night encamped under some large trees on the skirts of a\nforest. Several escaped prisoners recaptured; their punishment\nbarbarously cruel. Loud roaring of lions and hyenas heard at nightfall,\nalso snorting of hippopotamuses; probably some lake or water-course not\nfar off. Tired, but could not sleep; heard a rustling in the grass;\nfelt sure that something was going to attack me; what could I do? I had\nno gun. For Mrs. Weldon's sake, must, if possible, preserve my life.\nThe night was dark; no moon; two eyes gleamed upon me; I was about to\nutter a cry of alarm; fortunately, I suppressed it; the creature that\nhad sprung to my feet was Dingo! The dog licked my hands all over,\npersisting in rubbing his neck against them, evidently to make me feel\nthere; found a reed fastened to the well-known collar upon which the\ninitials S.V. had so often awakened our curiosity; breaking open the\nreed, I took a note from inside; it was too dark for me to see to read\nit. I tried, by caressing Dingo, to detain him; but the dog appeared to\nknow that his mission with me was at an end; he licked my hands\naffectionately, made a sudden bound, and disappeared in the long grass\nas mysteriously as he had come. The howling of the wild beasts\nincreased. How I dreaded that the faithful creature would become their\nprey! No more sleep this night for me. It seemed that daylight would\nnever dawn; at length it broke with the suddenness that marks a\ntropical morn. I was able cautiously to read my note; the handwriting,\nI knew at a glance, was that of Hercules; there were but a few lines in\npencil:--\n\n\"Mrs. Weldon and Jack carried away in a kitanda.\n\n\"Harris and Negoro both with them. Mr. Benedict too. Only a few marches\nahead, but cannot be communicated with at present. Found Dingo wounded\nby a gun-shot. Dear Mr. Dick, do not despair; keep up your courage. I\nmay help you yet.\n\n\"Your ever true and faithful\n\n\"HERCULES.\"\n\nAs far as it went, this intelligence was satisfactory. A kitanda, I\nknow, is a kind of litter made of dry grass, protected by a curtain,\nand carried on the shoulders of two men by a long bamboo. What a relief\nto know that Mrs. Weldon and Jack have been spared the miseries of this\ndreadful march! May I not indulge the hope of seeing them at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9?\n\n_12th_.--The prisoners getting more and more weary and worn out.\nBlood-stains on the way still more conspicuous. Many poor wretches are\na mass of wounds. One poor woman for two days has carried her dead\nchild, from which she refuses to be parted.\n\n_16th_.--Small-pox raging; the road strewn with corpses. Still ten days\nbefore we reach Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. Just passed a tree from which slaves who had\ndied from hunger were hanging by the neck.\n\n_18th_.--Must not give in, but I am almost exhausted. Rains have\nceased. We are to make what the dealers call _trikesa_, extra marches\nin the after-part of the day. Road very steep; runs through _nyassi_,\ntall grass of which the stalks scratch my face, and the seeds get under\nmy tattered clothes and make my skin smart painfully. My boots\nfortunately are thick, and have not worn out. More slaves sick and\nabandoned to take their chance. Provisions running very short; soldiers\nand pagazis must be satisfied, otherwise they desert; consequently the\nslaves are all but starved. \"They can eat each other,\" say the agents.\nA young slave, apparently in good health, dropped down dead. It made me\nthink of Livingstone's description of how free-born men, reduced to\nslavery, will suddenly press their hand on their side, and die of a\nbroken heart.\n\n[Illustration: More slaves sick, and abandoned to take their chance.]\n\n_24th_.--Twenty captives, incapable any longer of keeping pace with the\nrest, put to death by the havildars, the Arab chief offering no\nopposition. Poor old Nan one of the victims of this horrible butchery.\nMy foot struck her corpse as I passed, but I was not permitted to give\nher a decent burial. Poor old Nan! the first of the survivors of the\n\"Pilgrim\" to go to her long rest! Poor old Nan!\n\nEvery night I watch for Dingo; but he never comes. Has Hercules nothing\nmore to communicate? or has any mishap befallen him? If he is alive he\nwill do what mortal strength can do to aid us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nKAZONND\u00c3\u0089.\n\n\nBy the 26th of May, when the caravan reached Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 the number of the\nslaves had diminished by more than half, so numerous had been the\ncasualties along the road. But the dealers were quite prepared to make\na market of their loss; the demand for slaves was very great, and the\nprice must be raised accordingly.\n\nAngola at that time was the scene of a large negro-traffic, and as the\ncaravans principally wended their way towards the interior, the\nPortuguese authorities at Loanda and Benguela had practically no power\nto prevent it. The barracks on the shore were crowded to overflowing\nwith prisoners, the few slave-ships that managed to elude the cruisers\nbeing quite inadequate to embark the whole number for the Spanish\ncolonies to America.\n\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, the point whence the caravans diverge to the various parts of\nthe lake district, is situated three miles from the mouth of the\nCoanza, and is one of the most important _lakonis_, or markets of the\nprovince. The open marketplace where the slaves are exposed for sale is\ncalled the _chitoka_.\n\nAll the larger towns of Central Africa are divided into two distinct\nparts; one occupied by the Arab, Portuguese, or native merchants, and\ncontaining their slave-barracks; the other being the residence of the\nnegro king, often a fierce drunken potentate, whose rule is a reign of\nterror, and who lives by subsidies allowed him by the traders.\n\nThe commercial quarter of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 now belonged to Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Alvez.\nIt was his largest d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t, although he had another at Bih\u00c3\u00a9, and a third\nat Cassang\u00c3\u00a9, where Cameron subsequently met him. It consisted of one\nlong street, on each side of which were groups of flat-roofed houses\ncalled _temb\u00c3\u00a9s_, built of rough earth, and provided with square yards\nfor cattle. The end of it opened into the _chitoka_, which was\nsurrounded by the barracks. Above the houses some fine banyan-trees\nwaved their branches, surmounted here and there by the crests of\ngraceful palms. There was at least a score of birds of prey that\nhovered about the streets, and came down to perform the office of\npublic scavengers. At no great distance flowed the Loohi, a river not\nyet explored, but which is supposed to be an affluent or sub-affluent\nof the Congo.\n\n[Illustration: Adjoining the commercial quarter was the royal\nresidence.]\n\nAdjoining the commercial quarter was the royal residence, nothing more\nnor less than a collection of dirty huts, extending over an area of\nnearly a square mile.\n\nSome of these huts were unenclosed; others were surrounded by a\npalisade of reeds, or by a hedge of bushy figs.\n\nIn an enclosure within a papyrus fence were about thirty huts\nappropriated to the king's slaves, another group for his wives, and in\nthe middle, almost hidden by a plantation of manioc, a _temb\u00c3\u00a9_ larger\nand loftier than the rest, the abode of the monarch himself.\n\nHe had sorely declined from the dignity and importance of his\npredecessors, and his army, which by the early Portuguese traders had\nbeen estimated at 20,000, now numbered less than 4000 men; no longer\ncould he afford, as in the good old time, to order a sacrifice of\ntwenty-five or thirty slaves at one offering.\n\nHis name was Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga. Little over fifty, he was prematurely aged\nby drink and debauchery, and scarcely better than a maniac. His\nsubjects, officers, and ministers, were all liable to be mutilated at\nhis pleasure, and noses and ears, feet and hands, were cut off\nunsparingly whenever his caprice so willed it. His death would have\nbeen a cause of regret to no one, with the exception, perhaps, of\nAlvez, who was on very good terms with him. Alvez, moreover, feared\nthat in the event of the present king's death, the succession of his\nchief wife, Queen Moena, might be disputed, and that his dominions\nwould be invaded by a younger and more active neighbour, one of the\nkings of Ukusu, who had already seized upon some villages dependent on\nthe government of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, and who was in alliance with a rival trader\nnamed Tipo-Tipo, a man of pure Arab extraction, from whom Cameron\nafterwards received a visit at Nyangw\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nTo all intents and purposes Alvez was the real sovereign of the\ndistrict, having fostered the vices of the brutalized king till he had\nhim completely in his power. He was a man considerably advanced in\nyears; he was not (as his name might imply) a white man, but had merely\nassumed his Portuguese title for purposes of business; his true name\nwas Kend\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9, and he was a pure negro by birth, being a native of Dondo\non the Coanza. He had commenced life as a slave-dealer's agent, and was\nnow on his way towards becoming a first-class trader; that is to say,\nhe was a consummate rascal under the guise of an honest man. He it was\nwhom Cameron met at the end of 1874 at Kilemba, the capital of Urua, of\nwhich Kasongo is chief, and with whose caravan he travelled to Bih\u00c3\u00a9, a\ndistance of seven hundred miles.\n\nIt was midday when the caravan entered Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. The journey from the\nCoanza had lasted thirty-eight days, more than five weeks of misery as\ngreat as was within human power to endure. Amidst the noise of drums\nand coodoo-horns the slaves were conducted to the marketplace. The\nsoldiers of the caravan discharged their guns into the air, and old\nAlvez' resident retinue responded with a similar salute. The bandits,\nthan which the soldiers were nothing better, were delighted to meet\nagain, and would celebrate their return by a season of riot and excess.\n\nThe slaves, reduced to a total of about two hundred and fifty, were\nmany of them almost dead from exhaustion; the forks were removed from\ntheir necks, though the chains were still retained, and the whole of\nthem were driven into barracks that were unfit even for cattle, to\nawait (in company with 1200 to 1500 other captives already there) the\ngreat market which would be held two days hence.\n\nThe _pagazis_, after delivering their loads of ivory, would only stay\nto receive their payment of a few yards of calico or other stuff, and\nwould then depart at once to join some other caravan.\n\nOn being relieved from the forks which they had carried for so many\nweary days, Tom and his companions heartily wrung each other's hands,\nbut they could not venture to utter one word of mutual encouragement.\nThe three younger men, more full of life and vigour, had resisted the\neffects of the fatigue, but poor old Tom was nearly exhausted, and had\nthe march been protracted for a few more days he must have shared Nan's\nfate and been left behind, a prey to the wild beasts.\n\nUpon their arrival all four were packed into a narrow cell, where some\nfood was provided, and the door was immediately locked upon them.\n\nThe _chitoka_ was now almost deserted, and Dick Sands was left there\nunder the special charge of a havildar: he lost no opportunity of\npeering into every hut in the hope of catching a glimpse of Mrs.\nWeldon, who, if Hercules had not misinformed him, had come on hither\njust in front.\n\nBut he was very much perplexed. He could well understand that Mrs.\nWeldon, if still a prisoner, would be kept out of sight, but why Negoro\nand Harris did not appear to triumph over him in his humiliation was\nquite a mystery to him. It was likely enough that the presence of\neither one or the other of them would be the signal for himself to be\nexposed to fresh indignity, or even to torture, but Dick would have\nwelcomed the sight of them at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, were it only as an indication\nthat Mrs. Weldon and Jack were there also.\n\nIt disappointed him, too, that Dingo did not come back. Ever since the\ndog had brought him the first note, he had kept an answer written ready\nto send to Hercules, imploring him to look after Mrs. Weldon, and to\nkeep him informed of everything. He began to fear that the faithful\ncreature must be dead, perhaps perished in some attempt to reach\nhimself; it was, however, quite possible that Hercules had taken the\ndog in some other direction, hoping to gain somed\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t in the interior.\n\nBut so thoroughly had Dick persuaded himself that Mrs. Weldon had\npreceded him to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 that his disappointment became more and more\nkeen when he failed to discover her. For a while he seemed to yield to\ndespair, and sat down sorrowful and sick at heart.\n\nSuddenly a chorus of voices and trumpets broke upon his ear; he was\nstartled into taking a new interest in what was going on.\n\n\"Alvez! Alvez!\" was the cry again and again repeated by the crowd.\n\nHere, then, was the great man himself about to appear. Was it not\nlikely that Harris or Negoro might be with him?\n\nDick stood erect and resolute, his eye vivid with expectation; he felt\nall eagerness to stand face to face with his betrayers; boy as he was,\nhe was equal to cope with them both.\n\nThe _kitanda_, which came in sight at the end of the street, was\nnothing more than a kind of hammock covered by a faded and ragged\ncurtain. An old negro stepped out of it. His attendants greeted him\nwith noisy acclamations.\n\nThis, then, was the great trader, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Alvez.\n\nImmediately following him was his friend Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, son of the chief\nCo\u00c3\u00afmbra of Bih\u00c3\u00a9, and, according to Cameron, the greatest blackguard in\nthe province. This sworn ally of Alvez, this organizer of his\nslave-raids, this commander, worthy of his own horde of bandits, was\nutterly loathsome in his appearance, his flesh was filthily dirty, his\neyes were bloodshot, his skin yellow, and his long hair all\ndishevelled. He had no other attire than a tattered shirt, a tunic made\nof grass, and a battered straw hat, under which his countenance\nappeared like that of some old hag.\n\nAlvez himself, whose clothes were like those of an old Turk the day\nafter a carnival, was one degree more respectable in appearance than\nhis satellite, not that his looks spoke much for the very highest class\nof African slave-dealers. To Dick's great disappointment, neither\nHarris nor Negoro was among his retinue.\n\nBoth Alvez and Co\u00c3\u00afmbra shook hands with Ibn Hamish, the leader of the\ncaravan, and congratulated him on the success of the expedition. Alvez\nmade a grimace on being told that half the slaves had died on the way,\nbut on the whole he seemed satisfied; he could meet the demand that at\npresent existed, and would lose no time in bartering the new arrival\nfor ivory or _hannas_, copper in the shape of a St. Andrew's cross, the\nform in which the metal is exported in Central Africa.\n\nAfter complimenting the havildars upon the way in which they had done\ntheir work, the trader gave orders that the porters should be paid and\ndismissed. The conversations were carried on in a mixture of Portuguese\nand native idioms, in which the African element abounded so largely\nthat a native of Lisbon would have been at a loss to understand them.\nDick, of course, could not comprehend what was said, and it was only\nwhen he saw a havildar go towards the cell in which Tom and the others\nwere confined, that he realized that the talk was about himself and his\nparty.\n\nWhen the negroes were brought out, Dick came close up, being anxious to\nlearn as much as he could of what was in contemplation. The old\ntrader's eyes seemed to brighten as he glanced upon the three strapping\nyoung men who, he knew, would soon be restored to their full strength\nby rest and proper food. They at least would get a good price; as for\npoor old Tom, he was manifestly so broken down by infirmity and age,\nthat he would have no value in the market.\n\nIn a few words of broken English, which Alvez had picked up from some\nof his agents, he ironically gave them all a welcome.\n\n\"Glad to see you!\" he said, with a diabolical grin.\n\nTom knew what he meant, and drew himself up proudly.\n\n\"We are free men!\" he protested, \"free citizens of the United States!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" replied Alvez, grinning, \"you are Americans; very glad to\nsee you!\"\n\n\"Very glad to see you!\" echoed Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, and walking up to Austin he\nfelt his chest and shoulders, and then proceeded to open his mouth in\norder to examine his teeth.\n\nA blow from Austin's powerful fist sent the satellite staggering\nbackwards.\n\nSome soldiers made a dash and seized the young negro, evidently ready\nto make him pay dearly for his temerity; but Alvez was by no means\nwilling to have any injury done to his newly-acquired property, and\ncalled them off. He hardly attempted to conceal his amusement at\nCo\u00c3\u00afmbra's discomfiture, although the blow had cost him one of his front\nteeth.\n\nAfter he had recovered somewhat from the shock, Co\u00c3\u00afmbra stood scowling\nat Austin, as if mentally vowing vengeance on some future occasion.\n\nDick Sands was now himself brought forward in the custody of a\nhavildar. It was clear that Alvez had been told all about him, for\nafter scanning him for a moment, he stammered out in his broken\nEnglish,--\n\n\"Ah! ah! the little Yankee!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Dick; \"I see you know who I am. What are you going to do\nwith me and my friends?\"\n\n\"Yankee! little Yankee!\" repeated the trader, who either did not or\nwould not comprehend the meaning of Dick's question.\n\nDick turned to Co\u00c3\u00afmbra and made the same inquiry of him; in spite of\nhis degraded features, now still farther disfigured by being swollen\nfrom the blow, it was easy to recognize that he was not of native\norigin. He refused to answer a word, and only stared again with the\nvicious glare of malevolence.\n\nMeanwhile, Alvez had begun to talk to Ibn Hamish. Dick felt sure that\nthey intended to separate him from the negroes, and accordingly took\nthe opportunity of whispering a few words to them.\n\n\"My friends, I have heard from Hercules. Dingo brought me a note from\nhim, tied round his neck. He says Harris and Negoro have carried off\nMrs. Weldon, Jack, and Mr. Benedict. He did not know where. Have\npatience, and we will find them yet.\"\n\n[Illustration: With a yell and a curse, the American fell dead at his\nfeet.]\n\n\"And where's Nan?\" muttered Tom, in a low voice.\n\n\"Dead,\" replied Dick, and was about to add more, when a hand was laid\nupon his shoulder, and a voice that he knew too well exclaimed,--\n\n\"Well, my young friend, how are you? I am glad to see you again.\"\n\nHe turned round quickly. Harris stood before him.\n\n\"Where is Mrs. Weldon?\" asked Dick impetuously.\n\n\"Ah, poor thing!\" answered Harris, with an air of deep commiseration.\n\n\"What! is she dead?\" Dick almost shrieked; \"where is her child?\"\n\n\"Poor little fellow!\" said Harris, in the same mournful tone.\n\nThese insinuations, that those in whose welfare he was so deeply\ninterested had succumbed to the hardships of the journey, awoke in\nDick's mind a sudden and irresistible desire for vengeance. Darting\nforwards he seized the cutlass that Harris wore in his belt, and\nplunged it into his heart.\n\nWith a yell and a curse, the American fell dead at his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMARKET-DAY.\n\n\nSo sudden was Dick's action that it had been impossible to parry his\nblow. Several of the natives rushed on him, and in all likelihood would\nhave struck him down upon the spot had not Negoro arrived at that very\nmoment. At a sign from him the natives drew back, and proceeded to\nraise and carry away Harris's corpse.\n\nAlvez and Co\u00c3\u00afmbra were urgent in their demand that Dick should\nforthwith be punished by death, but Negoro whispered to them that they\nwould assuredly be the gainers by delay, and they accordingly contented\nthemselves with ordering the youth to be placed under strict\nsupervision.\n\nThis was the first time that Dick had set eyes upon Negoro since he had\nleft the coast; nevertheless, so heartbroken was he at the intelligence\nhe had just received, that he did not deign to address a word to the\nman whom he knew to be the real author of all his misery. He cared not\nnow what became of him.\n\nLoaded with chains, he was placed in the dungeon where Alvez was\naccustomed to confine slaves who had been condemned to death for mutiny\nor violence. That he had no communication with the outer world gave him\nno concern; he had avenged the death of those for whose safety he had\nfelt himself responsible, and could now calmly await the fate which he\ncould not doubt was in store for him; he did not dare to suppose that\nhe had been temporarily spared otherwise than that he might suffer the\ncruellest tortures that native ingenuity could devise. That the\n\"Pilgrim's\" cook now held in his power the boy captain he so thoroughly\nhated was warrant enough that the sternest possible measure of\nvengeance would be exacted.\n\n[Illustration: Accompanied by Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, Alvez himself was one of the\nfirst arrivals.]\n\nTwo days later, the great market, the _lakoni_, commenced. Although\nmany of the principal traders were there from the interior, it was by\nno means exclusively a slave-mart; a considerable proportion of the\nnatives from the neighbouring provinces assembled to dispose of the\nvarious products of the country.\n\nQuite early the great _chitoka_ of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 was all alive with a\nbustling concourse of little under five thousand people, including the\nslaves of old Alvez, amongst whom were Tom and his three partners in\nadversity--an item by no means inconsiderable in the dealer's stock.\n\nAccompanied by Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, Alvez himself was one of the first arrivals. He\nwas going to sell his slaves in lots to be conveyed in caravans into\nthe interior. The dealers for the most part consisted of half-breeds\nfrom Ujiji, the principal market on Lake Tanganyika, whilst some of a\nsuperior class were manifestly Arabs.\n\nThe natives that were assembled were of both sexes, and of every\nvariety of age, the women in particular displaying an aptitude in\nmaking bargains that is shared by their sisters elsewhere of a lighter\nhue; and it may be said that no market of the most civilized region\ncould be characterized by greater excitement or animation, for amongst\nthe savages of Africa the customer makes his offer in equally noisy\nterms as the vendor.\n\nThe _lakoni_ was always considered a kind of f\u00c3\u00a8te-day; consequently the\nnatives of both sexes, though their clothing was scanty in extent, made\na point of appearing in a most lavish display of ornaments. Their\nhead-gear was most remarkable. The men had their hair arranged in every\nvariety of eccentric device; some had it divided into four parts,\nrolled over cushions and fastened into a chignon, or mounted in front\ninto a bunch of tails adorned with red feathers; others plastered it\nthickly with a mixture of red mud and oil similar to that used for\ngreasing machinery, and formed it into cones or lumps, into which they\ninserted a medley of iron pins and ivory skewers; whilst the greatest\ndandies had a glass bead threaded upon every single hair, the whole\nbeing fastened together by a tattooing-knife driven through the\nglittering mass.\n\nAs a general rule, the women preferred dressing their hair in little\ntufts about the size of a cherry, arranging it into the shape of a cap,\nwith corkscrew ringlets on each side of the face. Some wore it simply\nhanging down their backs, others in French fashion, with a fringe\nacross the forehead; but every _coiffure_, without exception, was\ndaubed and caked either with the mixture of mud and grease, or with a\nbright red extract of sandal-wood called _nkola_.\n\nBut it was not only on their heads that they made this extraordinary\ndisplay of ornaments; the lobes of their ears were loaded till they\nreached their shoulders with a profusion of wooden pegs, open-work\ncopper rings, grains of maize, or little gourds, which served the\npurpose of snuff-boxes; their necks, arms, wrists, legs, and ankles\nwere a perfect mass of brass and copper rings, or sometimes were\ncovered with a lot of bright buttons. Rows of red beads, called\n_sames-sames_, or _talakas_, seemed also very popular. As they had no\npockets, they attached their knives, pipes and other articles to\nvarious parts of their body; so that altogether, in their holiday\nattire, the rich men of the district might not inappropriately be\ncompared to walking shrines.\n\nWith their teeth they had all played the strangest of vagaries; the\nupper and lower incisors had generally been extracted, and the others\nhad been filed to points or carved into hooks, like the fangs of a\nrattle-snake. Their fingernails were allowed to grow to such an\nimmoderate length as to render the hands well-nigh useless, and their\nswarthy skins were tattooed with figures of trees, birds, crescents and\ndiscs, or, not unfrequently, with those zigzag lines which Livingstone\nthinks he recognizes as resembling those observed in ancient Egyptian\ndrawings. The tattooing is effected by means of a blue substance\ninserted into incisions previously made in the skin. Every child is\ntattooed in precisely the same pattern as his father before him, and\nthus it may always be ascertained to what family he belongs. Instead of\ncarrying his armorial bearings upon his plate or upon the panels of his\ncarriage, the African magnate wears them emblazoned on his own bosom!\n\nThe garments that were usually worn were simply aprons of\nantelope-skins descending to the knees, but occasionally a short\npetticoat might be seen made of woven grass and dyed with bright\ncolours. The ladies not unfrequently wore girdles of beads attached to\ngreen skirts embroidered with silk and ornamented with bits of glass or\ncowries, or sometimes the skirts were made of the grass cloth called\n_lambda_, which, in blue, yellow, or black, is so much valued by the\npeople of Zanzibar.\n\nGarments of these pretensions, however, always indicated that the\nwearers belonged to the upper classes; the lower orders, such as the\nsmaller dealers, as well as the slaves, had hardly any clothes at all.\n\nThe women commonly acted as porters, and arrived at the market with\nhuge baskets on their backs, which they secured by means of straps\npassed across the forehead. Having deposited their loads upon the\nchitoka, they turned out their goods, and then seated themselves inside\nthe empty baskets.\n\nAs the result of the extreme fertility of the country all the articles\noffered for sale were of a first-rate quality. There were large stores\nof rice, which had been grown at a profit a hundred times as great as\nthe cost, and maize which, producing three crops in eight months,\nyielded a profit as large again as the rice. There were also sesame,\nUrua pepper stronger than Cayenne, manioc, nutmegs, salt, and palm-oil.\nIn the market, too, were hundreds of goats, pigs and sheep, evidently\nof a Tartar breed, with hair instead of wool; and there was a good\nsupply of fish and poultry. Besides all these there was an attractive\ndisplay of bright-coloured pottery, the designs of which were very\nsymmetrical.\n\nIn shrill, squeaky voices, children were crying several varieties of\nnative drinks; banana-wine, _pomb\u00c3\u00a9_, which, whatever it was, seemed to\nbe in great demand; _malofoo_, a kind of beer compounded of bananas,\nand mead, a mixture of honey and water, fermented with malt.\n\nBut the most prominent feature in the whole market was the traffic in\nstuffs and ivory. The pieces could be counted by thousands of the\nunbleached _mcrikani_ from Salem in Massachusetts, of the blue cotton,\n_kaniki_, thirty-four inches wide, and of the checked _sohari_, blue\nand black with its scarlet border. More expensive than these were lots\nof silk _diulis_, with red, green, or yellow grounds, which are sold in\nlengths of three yards, at prices varying from seven dollars to eighty,\nwhen they are interwoven with gold.\n\nThe ivory had come from well-nigh every part of Central Africa, and was\ndestined for Khartoom, Zanzibar, and Natal, many of the merchants\ndealing in this commodity exclusively.\n\nHow vast a number of elephants must be slaughtered to supply this ivory\nmay be imagined when it is remembered that over 200 tons, that is,\n1,125,000 lbs., are exported annually to Europe. Of this, much the\nlarger share goes to England, where the Sheffield cutlery consumes\nabout 382,500 lbs. From the West Coast of Africa alone the produce is\nnearly 140 tons.\n\nThe average weight of a pair of tusks is 28 lbs., and the ordinary\nvalue of these in 1874 would be about 60_l_.; but here in Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 were\nsome weighing no less than 165 lbs., of that soft, translucent quality\nwhich retains its whiteness far better than the ivory from other\nsources.\n\nAs already mentioned, slaves are not unfrequently used as current money\namongst the African traders, but the natives themselves usually pay for\ntheir goods with Venetian glass beads, of which the chalk-white are\ncalled _catchokolos_, the black _bubulus_, and the red\n_sikunderetches_. Strung in ten rows, or _khet\u00c3\u00a9s_, these beads are\ntwisted twice round the neck, forming what is called a _foondo_, which\nis always reckoned of considerable value.\n\nThe usual measure by which they are sold is the _frasilah_, containing\na weight of about 70 lbs. Livingstone, Cameron and Stanley always took\ncare to be well provided with this kind of currency. In default of\nbeads, the pic\u00c3\u00a9, a Zanzibar coin worth something more than a farthing,\nand _vioon-gooas,_ shells peculiar to the East Coast, are recognized as\na medium of exchange in the market. Amongst the cannibal tribes a\ncertain value is attached to human teeth, and at the lakoni some\nnatives might be seen wearing strings of teeth, the owners of which\nthey had probably, at some previous time, devoured. This species of\ncurrency, however, was falling rapidly into disuse.\n\nTowards the middle of the day the excitement of the market reached its\nhighest pitch, and the uproar became perfectly deafening. The voices of\nthe eager sellers mingled with those of indignant and overcharged\ncustomers; fights were numerous, and as there was an utter absence of\nany kind of police, no effort was made to restore peace or order\namongst the unruly crowd.\n\nIt was just noon when Alvez gave orders that the slaves he wished to\ndispose of should be placed on view. Thereupon nearly two thousand\nunfortunates were brought forward, many of whom had been confined in\nthe dealer's barracks for several months. Most of the stock, however,\nhad been so carefully attended to that they were in good condition, and\nit was only the last batch that looked as if they would be improved by\nanother month's rest; but as the demand upon the East Coast was now\nvery large, Alvez hoped to get a good price for all, and determined to\npart with even the last arrivals for whatever sum he could obtain.\n\nAmongst these latter, whom the havildars drove like a herd of cattle\ninto the middle of the chitoka, were Tom and his three friends. They\nwere closely chained, and rage and shame were depicted in their\ncountenances.\n\nBat passed a quick and scrutinizing gaze around him, and said to the\nothers,--\n\n\"I do not see Mr. Dick.\"\n\nTom answered mournfully,--\n\n\"Mr. Dick will be killed, if he is not dead already. Our only hope is\nthat we may now all be bought in one lot; it will be a consolation to\nus if we can be all together.\"\n\nTears rose to Bat's eyes as he thought of how his poor old father was\nlikely to be sold, and carried away to wear out his days as a common\nslave.\n\nThe sale now commenced. The agents of Alvez proceeded to divide the\nslaves, men, women and children, into lots, treating them in no respect\nbetter than beasts in a cattle-market. Tom and the others were paraded\nabout from customer to customer, an agent accompanying them to proclaim\nthe price demanded. Strong, intelligent-looking Americans, quite\ndifferent to the miserable creatures brought from the banks of the\nZambesi and Lualaba, they at once attracted the observation of the Arab\nand half-breed dealers. Just as though they were examining a horse, the\nbuyers felt their limbs, turned them round and round, looked at their\nteeth, and finally tested their paces by throwing a stick to a distance\nand making them run to fetch it.\n\nAll the slaves were subjected to similar humiliations; and ail alike,\nexcept the very young children, seemed deeply sensible of their\ndegradation. The cruelty exhibited towards them was very vile. Co\u00c3\u00afmbra,\nwho was half drunk, treated them with the utmost brutality; not that\nthey had any reason to expect any gentler dealings at the hands of the\nnew masters who might purchase them for ivory or any other commodity.\nChildren were torn away from their parents, husbands from their wives,\nbrothers from sisters, and without even the indulgence of a parting\nword, were separated never to meet again.\n\nThe scenes that occur at such markets as this at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 are too\nheartrending to be described in detail.\n\nIt is one of the peculiar requirements of the slave-trade that the two\nsexes should have an entirely different destination. In fact, the\ndealers who purchase men never purchase women. The women, who are\nrequired to supply the Mussulman harems, are sent principally to Arab\ndistricts to be exchanged for ivory; whilst the men, who are to be put\nto hard labour, are despatched to the coast, East and West, whence they\nare exported to the Spanish colonies, or to the markets of Muscat or\nMadagascar.\n\nTo Tom and his friends the prospect of being transported to a slave\ncolony was far better than that of being retained in some Central\nAfrican province, where they could have no chance of regaining their\nliberty; and the moment, to them, was accordingly one of great suspense.\n\nAltogether, things turned out for them better than they dared\nanticipate. They had at least the satisfaction of finding that as yet\nthey were not to be separated. Alvez, of course, had taken good care to\nconceal the origin of this exceptional lot, and their own ignorance of\nthe language thoroughly prevented them from communicating it; but the\nanxiety to secure so valuable a property rendered the competition for\nit very keen; the bidding rose higher and higher, until at length the\nfour men were knocked down to a rich Arab dealer, who purposed in the\ncourse of a few days to take them to Lake Tanganyika, and thence to one\nof the dept\u00c3\u00b4s of Zanzibar.\n\nThis journey, it is true, would be for 1500 miles across the most\nunhealthy parts of Central Africa, through districts harassed by\ninternal wars; and it seemed improbable that Tom could survive the\nhardships he must meet; like poor old Nan, he would succumb to fatigue;\nbut the brave fellows did not suffer themselves to fear the future,\nthey were only too happy to be still together; and the chain that bound\nthem one to another was felt to be easier and lighter to bear.\n\nTheir new master knew that it was for his own interest that his\npurchase should be well taken care of; he looked to make a substantial\nprofit at Zanzibar, and sent them off at once to his own private\nbarracks; consequently they saw no more of what transpired at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nA BOWL OF PUNCH.\n\n\nThe afternoon was passing away, and it was now past four o'clock, when\nthe sound of drums, cymbals, and a variety of native instruments was\nheard at the end of the main thoroughfare. The market was still going\non with the same animation as before; half a day's screeching and\nfighting seemed neither to have wearied the voices nor broken the limbs\nof the demoniacal traffickers; there was a considerable number of\nslaves still to be disposed of, and the dealers were haggling over the\nremaining lots with an excitement of which a sudden panic on the London\nStock Exchange could give a very inadequate conception.\n\nBut the discordant concert which suddenly broke upon the ear was the\nsignal for business to be at once suspended. The crowd might cease its\nuproar, and recover its breath. The King of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga, was\nabout to honour the _lakoni_ with a visit.\n\nAttended by a large retinue of wives, officers, soldiers, and slaves,\nthe monarch was conveyed to the middle of the market-place in an old\npalanquin, from which he was obliged to have five or six people to help\nhim to descend. Alvez and the other traders advanced to meet him with\nthe most exaggerated gestures of reverence, all of which he received as\nhis rightful homage.\n\nHe was a man of fifty years of age, but might easily have passed for\neighty. He looked like an old, decrepit monkey. On his head was a kind\nof tiara, adorned with leopards' claws dyed red, and tufts of\ngreyish-white hair; this was the usual crown of the sovereigns of\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. From his waist hung two skirts of coodoo-hide, stiff as\nblacksmiths' aprons, and embroidered with pearls. The tattooings on his\nbreast were so numerous that his pedigree, which they declared, might\nseem to reach back to time immemorial. His wrists and arms were encased\nin copper bracelets, thickly encrusted with beads; he wore a pair of\ntop-boots, a present from Alvez some twenty years ago; in his left hand\nhe carried a great stick surmounted by a silver knob; in his right a\nfly-flapper with a handle studded with pearls; over his head was\ncarried an old umbrella with as many patches as a Harlequin's coat,\nwhilst from his neck hung Cousin Benedict's magnifying-glass, and on\nhis nose were the spectacles which had been stolen from Bat's pocket.\n\n[Illustration: The potentate beneath whose sway the country trembled\nfor a hundred miles round]\n\nSuch was the appearance of the potentate beneath whose sway the country\ntrembled for a hundred miles round.\n\nBy virtue of his sovereignty Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga claimed to be of celestial\norigin; and any subject who should have the audacity to raise a\nquestion on this point would have been despatched forthwith to another\nworld. All his actions, his eating and drinking, were supposed to be\nperformed by divine impulse. He certainly drank like no other mortal;\nhis officers and ministers, confirmed tipplers as they were, appeared\nsober men in comparison with himself, and he seemed never to be doing\nanything but imbibing strong pomb\u00c3\u00a9, and over-proof spirit with which\nAlvez kept him liberally supplied.\n\nIn his harem Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga had wives of all ages from forty to fourteen,\nmost of whom accompanied him on his visit to the _lakoni_. Moena, the\nchief wife, who was called the queen, was the eldest of them all, and,\nlike the rest, was of royal blood. She was a vixenish-looking woman,\nvery gaily attired; she wore a kind of bright tartan over a skirt of\nwoven grass, embroidered with pearls; round her throat was a profusion\nof necklaces, and her hair was mounted up in tiers that toppled high\nabove her head, making her resemble some hideous monster. The younger\nwives, all of them sisters or cousins of the king, were less\nelaborately dressed. They walked behind her, ready at the slightest\nsign to perform the most menial services. Did his Majesty wish to sit\ndown, two of them would immediately stoop to the ground and form a seat\nwith their bodies, whilst others would have to lie down and support his\nfeet upon their backs: a throne and footstool of living ebony.\n\nAmidst the staggering, half-tipsy crowd of ministers, officers, and\nmagicians that composed Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga's suite, there was hardly a man to\nbe seen who had not lost either an eye, an ear, or hand, or nose. Death\nand mutilation were the only two punishments practised in Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, and\nthe slightest offence involved the instant amputation of some member of\nthe body. The loss of the ear was considered the severest penalty, as\nit prevented the possibility of wearing earrings!\n\nThe governors of districts, or _kilolos_, whether hereditary or\nappointed for four years, were distinguished by red waistcoats and\nzebra-skin caps; in their hands they brandished long rattans, coated at\none extremity with a varnish of magic drugs.\n\nThe weapons carried by the soldiers consisted of wooden bows adorned\nwith fringes and provided with a spare bowstring, knives filed into the\nshape of serpents' tongues, long, broad lances, and shields of palm\nwood, ornamented with arabesques. In the matter of uniform, the royal\narmy had no demands to make upon the royal treasury.\n\nAmongst the attendants of the king there was a considerable number of\nsorcerers and musicians. The sorcerers, or _mganga_, were practically\nthe physicians of the court, the savages having the most implicit faith\nin divinations and incantations of every kind, and employing fetishes,\nclay or wooden figures, representing sometimes ordinary human beings\nand sometimes fantastic animals. Like the rest of the retinue, these\nmagicians were, for the most part, more or less mutilated, an\nindication that some of their prescriptions on behalf of the king had\nfailed of success.\n\nThe musicians were of both sexes, some performing on shrill rattles,\nsome on huge drums, whilst others played on instruments called\n_marimbas_, a kind of dulcimer made of two rows of different-sized\ngourds fastened in a frame, and struck by sticks with india-rubber\nballs at the end. To any but native ears the music was perfectly\ndeafening.\n\n[Illustration: Alvez advanced and presented the king with some fresh\ntobacco.]\n\nSeveral flags and banners were carried in the procession, and amongst\nthese was mixed up a number of long pikes, upon which were stuck the\nskulls of the various chiefs that Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga had conquered in battle.\n\nAs the king as helped out of his palanquin, the acclamations rose\nhigher and higher from every quarter of the market place The soldiers\nattached to the caravans fired off their old guns, though the reports\nwere almost too feeble to be heard above the noisy vociferations of the\ncrowd; and the havildars rubbed their black noses with cinnabar powder,\nwhich they carried in bags, and prostrated themselves. Alvez advanced\nand presented the king with some fresh tobacco, \"the appeasing herb,\"\nas it is called in the native dialect; and certainly Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga\nseemed to require some appeasing, as, for some unknown reason, he was\nin a thoroughly bad temper.\n\nCo\u00c3\u00afmbra, Ibn Hamish and the dealers all came forward to pay their court\nto the monarch, the Arabs greeting him with the cry of _marhaba_, or\nwelcome; others clapped their hands and bowed to the very ground; while\nsome even smeared themselves with mud, in token of their most servile\nsubjection.\n\nBut Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga scarcely took notice of any of them; he went\nstaggering along, rolling like a ship upon a stormy sea, and made his\nway past the crowds of slaves, each of whom, no less than their\nmasters, trembled lest he should think fit to claim them for his own.\n\nNegoro, who kept close at Alvez' side, did not fail to render his\nhomage along with the rest. Alvez and the king were carrying on a\nconversation in the native language, if that could be called a\nconversation in which Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga merely jerked out a few\nmonosyllables from his inflamed and swollen lips. He was asking Alvez\nto replenish his stock of brandy.\n\n\"We are proud to welcome your majesty at the market of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9,\" Alvez\nwas saying.\n\n\"Get me brandy,\" was all the drunken king's reply.\n\n\"Will it please your majesty to take part in the business of the\n_lakoni_?\" Alvez tried to ask.\n\n\"Drink!\" blurted out the king impatiently.\n\nAlvez continued,--\n\n\"My friend Negoro here is anxious to greet your majesty after his long\nabsence.\"\n\n\"Drink!\" roared the monarch again.\n\n\"Will the king take pomb\u00c3\u00a9 or mead?\" asked Alvez, at last obliged to\ntake notice of the demand.\n\n\"Brandy! give me fire-water!\" yelled the king, in a fury. \"For every\ndrop you shall have ...\"\n\n\"A drop of a white man's blood!\" suggested Negoro, glancing at Alvez.\n\n\"Yes, yes; kill a white man,\" assented Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga, his ferocious\ninstincts all aroused by the proposition.\n\n\"There is a white man here,\" said Alvez, \"who has killed my agent. He\nmust be punished for his act.\"\n\n\"Send him to King Masongo!\" cried the king; \"Masongo and the Assuas\nwill cut him up and eat him alive.\"\n\nOnly too true it is that cannibalism is still openly practised in\ncertain provinces of Central Africa. Livingstone records that the\nManyuemas not only eat men killed in war, but even buy slaves for that\npurpose; it is said to be the avowal of these Manyuemas that \"human\nflesh is slightly salt, and requires no seasoning.\" Cameron relates how\nin the dominions of Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Booga dead bodies were soaked for a few days\nin running water as a preparation for their being devoured; and Stanley\nfound traces of a widely-spread cannibalism amongst the inhabitants of\nUkusu.\n\nBut however horrible might be the manner of death proposed by Moen\u00c3\u00a9\nLoonga, it did not at all suit Negoro's purpose to let Dick Sands out\nof his clutches.\n\n\"The white man is here,\" he said to the king; \"it is here he has\ncommitted his offence, and here he should be punished.\"\n\n\"If you will,\" replied Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga; \"only I must have fire-water; a\ndrop of fire-water for every drop of the white man's blood.\"\n\n\"Yes, you shall have the fire-water,\" assented Alvez, \"and what is\nmore, you shall have it all alight. We will give your majesty a bowl of\nblazing punch.\"\n\nThe thought had struck Alvez, and he was himself delighted with the\nidea, that he would set the spirit in flames. Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga had\ncomplained that the \"fire-water\" did not justify its name as it ought,\nand Alvez hoped that perhaps, administered in this new form, it might\nrevivify the deadened membranes of the palate of the king.\n\nMoen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga did not conceal his satisfaction. Wives and courtiers\nalike were full of anticipation. They had all drunk brandy, but they\nhad not drunk brandy alight. And not only was their thirst for alcohol\nto be satisfied; their thirst for blood was likewise to be indulged;\nand when it is remembered how, even amongst the civilized, drunkenness\nreduces a man below the level of a brute, it may be imagined to what\nbarbarous cruelties Dick Sands was likely to be exposed. The idea of\ntorturing a white man was not altogether repugnant to the coloured\nblood of either Alvez or Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, while with Negoro the spirit of\nvengeance had completely overpowered all feeling of compunction.\n\nNight, without any intervening twilight, was soon drawing on, and the\ncontemplated display could hardly fail to be effective. The programme\nfor the evening consisted of two parts; first, the blazing punch-bowl;\nthen the torture, culminating in an execution.\n\nThe destined victim was still closely confined in his dark and dreary\ndungeon; all the slaves, whether sold or not, had been driven back to\nthe barracks, and the chitoka was cleared of every one except the\nslave-dealers, the havildars, and the soldiers, who hoped, by favour of\nthe king, to have a share of the flaming punch.\n\nAlvez did not long delay the proceedings. He ordered a huge caldron,\ncapable of containing more than twenty gallons, to be placed in the\ncentre of the market-place. Into this were emptied several casks of\nhighly-rectified spirit, of a very inferior quality, to which was added\na supply of cinnamon and other spices, no ingredient being omitted\nwhich was likely to give a pungency to suit the savage palate.\n\nThe whole royal retinue formed a circle round the king. Fascinated by\nthe sight of the spirit, Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga came reeling up to the edge of\nthe punch-bowl, and seemed ready to plunge himself head foremost into\nit. Alvez held him back, at the same time placing a lucifer in his hand.\n\n\"Set it alight!\" cried the slave-dealer, grinning slily as he spoke.\n\nThe king applied the match to the surface of the spirit. The effect was\ninstantaneous. High above the edge of the bowl the blue flame rose and\ncurled. To give intensity to the process Alvez had added a sprinkling\nof salt to the mixture, and this caused the fire to cast upon the faces\nof all around that lurid glare which is generally associated with\napparitions of ghosts and phantoms. Half intoxicated already, the\nnegroes yelled and gesticulated; and joining hands, they performed a\nfiendish dance around their monarch. Alvez stood and stirred the spirit\nwith an enormous metal ladle, attached to a pole, and as the flames\nrose yet higher and higher they seemed to throw a more and more\nunearthly glamour over the ape-like forms that circled in their wild\ncareer.\n\nMoen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga, in his eagerness, soon seized the ladle from the\nslave-dealer's hands, plunged it deep into the bowl, and bringing it up\nagain full of the blazing punch, raised it to his lips.\n\nA horrible shriek brought the dancers to a sudden standstill. By a kind\nof spontaneous combustion, the king had taken fire internally; though\nit was a fire that emitted little heat, it was none the less intense\nand consuming. In an instant one of the ministers in attendance ran to\nthe king's assistance, but he, almost as much alcoholized as his\nmaster, caught fire as well, and soon both monarch and minister lay\nwrithing on the ground in unutterable agony. Not a soul was able to\nlend a helping hand. Alvez and Negoro were at a loss what to do; the\ncourtiers dared not expose themselves to so terrible a fate; the women\nhad all fled in alarm, and Co\u00c3\u00afmbra, awakened to the conviction of the\ninflammability of his own condition, had rapidly decamped.\n\n[Illustration: The king had taken fire internally.]\n\nTo say the truth, it was impossible to do anything; water would have\nproved unavailing to quench the pale blue flame that hovered over the\nprostrate forms, every tissue of which was so thoroughly impregnated\nwith spirit, that combustion, though outwardly extinguished, would\ncontinue its work internally.\n\nIn a few minutes life was extinct, but the bodies continued long\nafterwards to burn; until, upon the spot where they had fallen, a few\nlight ashes, some fragments of the spinal column, some fingers and some\ntoes, covered with a thin layer of stinking soot, were all that\nremained of the King of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 and his ill fated minister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nROYAL OBSEQUIES.\n\n\nOn the following morning the town of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 presented an aspect of\nunwonted desolation. Awe-struck at the event of the previous evening,\nthe natives had all shut themselves up in their huts. That a monarch\nwho was to be assumed as of divine origin should perish with one of his\nministers by so horrible a death was a thing wholly unparalleled in\ntheir experience. Some of the elder part of the community remembered\nhaving taken part in certain cannibal preparations, and were aware that\nthe cremation of a human body is no easy matter, yet here was a case in\nwhich two men had been all but utterly consumed without any extraneous\napplication. Here was a mystery that baffled all their comprehension.\n\nOld Alvez had also retired to the seclusion of his own residence;\nhaving been warned by Negoro that he would probably be held responsible\nfor the occurrence, he deemed it prudent to keep in retirement.\nMeanwhile Negoro industriously circulated the report that the king's\ndeath had been brought about by supernatural means reserved by the\ngreat Manitoo solely for his elect, and that it was sacred fire that\nhad proceeded from his body. The superstitious natives readily received\nthis version of the affair, and at once proceeded to honour Moen\u00c3\u00a9\nLoonga with funeral rites worthy of one thus conspicuously elevated to\nthe rank of the gods. The ceremony (which entailed an expenditure of\nhuman blood incredible except that it is authenticated by Cameron and\nother African travellers) was just the opportunity that Negoro required\nfor carrying out his designs against Dick, whom he intended to take a\nprominent part in it.\n\nThe natural successor to the king was the queen Moena. By inaugurating\nthe funeral without delay and thus assuming the semblance of authority,\nshe forestalled the king of Ukusu or any other rival who might venture\nto dispute her sovereignty; and moreover, by taking the reins of\ngovernment into her hands she avoided the fate reserved for the other\nwives who, had they been allowed to live, might prove somewhat\ntroublesome to the shrew. Accordingly, with the sound of coodoo horns\nand marimbas, she caused a proclamation to be made in the various\nquarters of the town, that the obsequies of the deceased monarch would\nbe celebrated on the next evening with all due solemnity.\n\nThe announcement met with no opposition either from the officials about\nthe court or from the public at large. Alvez and the traders generally\nwere quite satisfied with Moena's assumption of the supremacy, knowing\nthat by a few presents and a little flattery they could make her\nsufficiently considerate for their own interests.\n\nPreparations began at once. At the end of the chief thoroughfare flowed\na deep and rapid brook, an affluent of the Coango, in the dry bed of\nwhich the royal grave was to be formed. Natives were immediately set to\nwork to construct a dam by means of which the water should be diverted,\nuntil the burial was over, into a temporary channel across the plain;\nthe last act in the ceremonial being to undam the stream and allow it\nto resume its proper course.\n\nNegoro had formed the resolution that Dick Sands should be one of the\nvictims to be sacrificed upon the king's tomb. Thoroughly aware as he\nwas that the indignation which had caused the death of Harris extended\nin at least an equal degree to himself, the cowardly rascal would not\nhave ventured to approach Dick under similar circumstances at the risk\nof meeting a similar fate; but knowing him to be a prisoner bound hand\nand foot, from whom there could be nothing to fear, he resolved to go\nto him in his dungeon-*\n\nNot only did he delight in torturing his victims, but he derived an\nespecial gratification from witnessing the torture.\n\nAbout the middle of the day, accordingly, he made his way to the cell\nwhere Dick was detained under the strict watch of a havildar. There,\nbound with fetters that penetrated his very flesh, lay the poor boy;\nfor the last four and twenty hours he had not been allowed a morsel of\nfood, and would gladly have faced the most painful death as a welcome\nrelief to his miseries.\n\nBut at the sight of Negoro all his energy revived; instinctively he\nmade an effort to burst his bonds, and to get a hold upon his\npersecutor; but the strength of a giant would have been utterly\nunavailing for such a design. Dick felt that the struggle he had to\nmake was of another kind, and forcing himself to an apparent composure,\nhe determined to look Negoro straight in the face, but to vouchsafe no\nreply to anything he might say.\n\n\"I felt bound,\" Negoro began, \"to come and pay my respects to my young\ncaptain, and to tell him how sorry I am that he has not the same\nauthority here that he had on board the 'Pilgrim.'\"\n\nFinding that Dick returned no answer, he continued,--\n\n\"You remember your old cook, captain: I have come to know what you\nwould like to order for your breakfast.\"\n\nHere he paused to give a brutal kick at Dick's foot, and went on,--\n\n\"I have also another question to ask you, captain; can you tell me how\nit was that you landed here in Angola instead of upon the coast of\nAmerica?\"\n\nThe way in which the question was put more than ever confirmed Dick's\nimpression that the \"Pilgrim's\" course had been altered by Negoro, but\nhe persevered in maintaining a contemptuous silence.\n\n\"It was a lucky thing for you, captain,\" resumed the vindictive\nPortuguese, \"that you had a good seaman on board, otherwise the ship\nwould have run aground on some reef in the tempest, instead of coming\nashore here in a friendly port.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Your life is in my hands!\"]\n\nWhilst he was speaking, Negoro had gradually drawn nearer to the\nprisoner, until their faces were almost in contact. Exasperated by\nDick's calmness, his countenance assumed an expression of the utmost\nferocity, and at last he burst forth in a paroxysm of rage.\n\n\"It is my turn now! I am master now! I am captain here! You are in my\npower now! Your life is in my hands!\"\n\n\"Take it, then,\" said Dick quietly; \"death has no terrors for me, and\nyour wickedness will soon be avenged.\"\n\n\"Avenged!\" roared Negoro; \"do you suppose there is a single soul to\ncare about you? Avenged! who will concern himself with what befalls\nyou? except Alvez and me, there is no one with a shadow of authority\nhere; if you think you are going to get any help from old Tom or any of\nthose niggers, let me tell you that they are every one of them sold and\nhave been sent off to Zanzibar.\"\n\n\"Hercules is free,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Hercules!\" sneered Negoro; \"he has been food for lions and panthers\nlong ago, I am only sorry that I did not get the chance of disposing of\nhim myself.\"\n\n\"And there is Dingo,\" calmly persisted Dick; \"sure as fate, he will\nfind you out some day.\"\n\n\"Dingo is dead!\" retorted Negoro with malicious glee: \"I shot the brute\nmyself, and I should be glad if every survivor of the 'Pilgrim' had\nshared his fate.\"\n\n\"But remember,\" said Dick, \"you have to follow them all yourself;\" and\nhe fixed a sharp gaze upon his persecutor's eye.\n\nThe Portuguese villain was stung to the quick; he made a dash towards\nthe youth, and would have strangled him upon the spot, but remembering\nthat any such sudden action would be to liberate him from the torture\nhe was determined he should undergo, he controlled his rage, and after\ngiving strict orders to the havildar, who had been a passive spectator\nof the scene, to keep a careful watch upon his charge, he left the\ndungeon.\n\nSo far from depressing Dick's spirits, the interview had altogether a\ncontrary effect; his feelings had undergone a reaction, so that all his\nenergies were restored. Possibly Negoro in his sudden assault had\nunintentionally loosened his fetters, for he certainly seemed to have\ngreater play for his limbs, and fancied that by a slight effort he\nmight succeed in disengaging his arms. Even that amount of freedom,\nhowever, he knew could be of no real avail to him; he was a\nclosely-guarded prisoner, without hope of succour from without; and now\nhe had no other wish than cheerfully to meet the death that should\nunite him to the friends who had gone before.\n\nThe hours passed on. The gleams of daylight that penetrated the\nthatched roof of the prison gradually faded into darkness; the few\nsounds on the chitoka, a great contrast to the hubbub of the day,\nbecame hushed into silence, and night fell upon the town of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nDick Sands slept soundly for about a couple of hours, and woke up\nconsiderably refreshed. One of his arms, which was somewhat less\nswollen than the other, he was able to withdraw from its bonds; it was\nat any rate a relief to stretch it at his pleasure.\n\nThe havildar, grasping the neck of a brandy-bottle which he had just\ndrained, had sunk into a heavy slumber, and Dick Sands was\ncontemplating the possibility of getting posssession of his gaoler's\nweapons when his attention was arrested by a scratching at the bottom\nof the door. By the help of his liberated arm he contrived to crawl\nnoiselessly to the threshold, where the scratching increased in\nviolence. For a moment he was in doubt whether the noise proceeded from\nthe movements of a man or an animal. He gave a glance at the havildar,\nwho was sound asleep, and placing his lips against the door murmured\n\"Hercules!\"\n\nA low whining was the sole reply.\n\n\"It must be Dingo,\" muttered Dick to himself; \"Negoro may have told me\na lie; perhaps, after all, the dog is not dead.\"\n\nAs though in answer to his thoughts, a dog's paw was pushed below the\ndoor. Dick seized it eagerly; he had no doubt it was Dingo's; but if\nthe dog brought a message, it was sure to be tied to his neck, and\nthere seemed to be no means of getting at it, except the hole\nunderneath could be made large enough to admit the animal's head. Dick\ndetermined to try and scrape away the soil at the threshold, and\ncommenced digging with his nails. But he had scarcely set himself to\nhis task when loud barkings, other than Dingo's, were heard in the\ndistance. The faithful creature had been scented out by the native\ndogs, and instinct dictated an immediate flight. Alarm had evidently\nbeen taken, as several gun-shots were fired; the havildar half roused\nhimself from his slumber, and Dick was fain to roll himself once more\ninto his corner, there to await the dawn of the day which was intended\nto be his last.\n\n[Illustration: All his energies were restored.]\n\nThroughout that day, the grave-digging was carried on with unremitted\nactivity. A large number of the natives, under the superintendence of\nthe queen's prime minister, were set to work, and according to the\ndecree of Moena, who seemed resolved to continue the rigorous sway of\nher departed husband, were bound, under penalty of mutilation, to\naccomplish their task within the proscribed time.\n\nAs soon as the stream had been diverted into its temporary channel,\nthere was hollowed out in the dry river bed a pit, fifty feet long, ten\nfeet wide, and ten feet deep. This, towards the close of the day, was\nlined throughout with living women, selected from Moen\u00c3\u00a9 Loonga's\nslaves; in ordinary cases it would have been their fate to be buried\nalive beside their master; but in recognition of his miraculous death\nit was ordained that they should be drowned beside his remains.[1]\n\n\n[Footnote 1: The horrible hecatombs that commemorate the death of any\npowerful chief in Central Africa defy all description. Cameron relates\nthat more than a hundred victims were sacrificed at the obsequies of\nthe father of the King of Kassongo.]\n\n\nGenerally, the royal corpse is arrayed in its richest vestments before\nbeing consigned to the tomb, but in this case, when the remains\nconsisted only of a few charred bones, another plan was adopted. An\nimage of the king, perhaps rather flattering to the original, was made\nof wicker-work; inside this were placed the fragments of bones and\nskin, and the effigy itself was then arrayed in the robes of state,\nwhich, as already mentioned, were not of a very costly description.\n\nCousin Benedict's spectacles were not forgotten, but were firmly\naffixed to the countenance of the image. The masquerade had its\nludicrous as well as its terrible side.\n\nWhen the evening arrived, a long procession was seen wending its way to\nthe place of interment; the uproar was perfectly deafening; shouts,\nyells, the boisterous incantations of the musicians, the clang of\nmusical instruments, and the reports of many old muskets, mingled in\nwild confusion.\n\nThe ceremony was to take place by torch-light, and the whole population\nof Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, native and otherwise, was bound to be present. Alvez,\nCo\u00c3\u00afmbra, Negoro, the Arab dealers and their havildars all helped to\nswell the numbers, the queen having given express orders that no one\nwho had been at the lakoni should leave the town, and it was not deemed\nprudent to disobey her commands.\n\nThe remains of the king were carried in a palanquin in the rear of the\ncort\u00c3\u00a9ge, surrounded by the wives of the second class, some of whom were\ndoomed to follow their master beyond the tomb. Queen Moena, in state\narray, marched behind the catafalque.\n\nNight was well advanced when the entire procession reached the banks of\nthe brook, but the resin-torches, waved on high by their bearers, shed\na ruddy glare upon the teeming crowd. The grave, with its lining of\nliving women, bound to its side by chains, was plainly visible; fifty\nslaves, some resigned and mute, others uttering loud and piteous cries,\nwere there awaiting the moment when the rushing torrent should be\nopened upon them.\n\nThe wives who were destined to perish had been selected by the queen\nherself and were all in holiday-attire. One of the victims, who bore\nthe title of second wife, was forced down upon her hands and knees in\nthe grave, in order to form a resting-place for the effigy, as she had\nbeen accustomed to do for the living sovereign; the third wife had to\nsustain the image in an upright position, and the fourth lay down at\nits feet to make a footstool.\n\nIn front of the effigy, at the end of the grave, a huge stake, painted\nred, was planted firmly in the earth. Bound to this stake, his body\nhalf naked, exhibiting marks of the tortures which by Negoro's orders\nhe had already undergone, friendless and hopeless, was Dick Sands!\n\n[Illustration: Friendless and hopeless.]\n\nThe time, however, for opening the flood-gate had not yet arrived.\nFirst of all, at a sign from the queen, the fourth wife, forming the\nroyal footstool had her throat cut by an executioner, her blood\nstreaming into the grave. This barbarous deed was the commencement of a\nmost frightful butchery. One after another, fifty slaves fell beneath\nthe slaughterous knife, until the river-bed was a very cataract of\nblood. For half an hour the shrieks of the victims mingled with the\nimprecations of their murderers, without evoking one single expression\nof horror or sympathy from the gazing crowd around.\n\nAt a second signal from the queen, the barrier, which retained the\nwater above, was opened. By a refinement of cruelty the torrent was not\nadmitted suddenly to the grave, but allowed to trickle gradually in.\n\nThe first to be drowned were the slaves that carpeted the bottom of the\ntrench, their frightful struggles bearing witness to the slow death\nthat was overpowering them. Dick was immersed to his knees, but he\ncould be seen making what might seem one last frantic effort to burst\nhis bonds.\n\nSteadily rose the water; the stream resumed its proper course; the last\nhead disappeared beneath its surface, and soon there remained nothing\nto indicate that in the depth below there was a tomb where a hundred\nvictims had been sacrificed to the memory of the King of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nPainful as they are to describe, it is impossible to ignore the reality\nof such scenes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nIN CAPTIVITY.\n\n\nSo far from Mrs. Weldon and Jack having succumbed to the hardships to\nwhich they had been exposed, they were both alive, and together with\nCousin Benedict were now in Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. After the assault upon the\nant-hill they had all three been conveyed beyond the encampment to a\nspot where a rude palanquin was in readiness for Mrs. Weldon and her\nson. The journey hence to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 was consequently accomplished\nwithout much difficulty; Cousin Benedict, who performed it on foot, was\nallowed to entomologize as much as he pleased upon the road, so that to\nhim the distance was a matter of no concern. The party reached their\ndestination a week sooner than Ibn Hamish's caravan, and the prisoners\nwere lodged in Alvez' quarters.\n\nJack was much better. After leaving the marshy districts he had no\nreturn of fever, and as a certain amount of indulgence had been allowed\nthem on their journey, both he and his mother, as far as their health\nwas concerned, might be said to be in a satisfactory condition.\n\nOf the rest of her former companions Mrs. Weldon could hear nothing.\nShe had herself been a witness of the escape of Hercules, but of course\nknew nothing further of his fate; as for Dick Sands, she entertained a\nsanguine hope that his white skin would protect him from any severe\ntreatment; but for Nan and the other poor negroes, here upon African\nsoil, she feared the very worst.\n\nBeing entirely shut off from communication with the outer world, she\nwas quite unaware of the arrival of the caravan; even if she had heard\nthe noisy commotion of the market she would not have known what it\nmeant, and she was in ignorance alike of the death of Harris, of the\nsale of Tom and his companions, of the dreadful end of the king, and of\nthe royal obsequies in which poor Dick had been assigned so melancholy\na share. During the journey from the Coanza to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, Harris and\nNegoro had held no conversation with her, and since her arrival she had\nnot been allowed to pass the inclosure of the establishment, so that,\nas far as she knew, she was quite alone, and being in Negoro's power,\nwas in a position from which it seemed only too likely nothing but\ndeath could release her.\n\nFrom Cousin Benedict, it is needless to repeat, she could expect no\nassistance; his own personal pursuits engrossed him, and he had no care\nnor leisure to bestow upon external circumstances. His first feeling,\non being made to understand that he was not in America, was one of deep\ndisappointment that the wonderful things he had seen were no\ndiscoveries at all; they were simply African insects common on African\nsoil. This vexation, however, soon passed away, and he began to believe\nthat \"the land of the Pharaohs\" might possess as much entomological\nwealth as \"the land of the Incas.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he would exclaim to Mrs. Weldon, heedless that she gave him\nlittle or no attention, \"this is the country of the manticor\u00c3\u00a6, and\nwonderful coleoptera they are, with their long hairy legs, their sharp\nelytra and their big mandibles; the most remarkable of them all is the\ntuberous manticora. And isn't this, too, the land of the golden-tipped\ncalosomi? and of the prickly-legged goliaths of Guinea and Gabon? Here,\ntoo, we ought to find the spotted anthidia, which lay their eggs in\nempty snail-shells; and the sacred atenchus, which the old Egyptians\nused to venerate as divine.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes;\" he would say at another time, \"this is the proper habitat\nof those death's-head sphinxes which are now so common everywhere; and\nthis is the place for those 'Idias Bigoti,' so formidable to the\nnatives of Senegal. There must be wonderful discoveries to be made here\nif only those good people will let me.\"\n\nThe \"good people\" referred to were Negoro and Harris, who had restored\nhim much of the liberty of which Dick Sands had found it necessary to\ndeprive him. With freedom to roam and in possession of his tin box,\nBenedict would have been amongst the most contented of men, had it not\nbeen for the loss of his spectacles and magnifying-glass, now buried\nwith the King of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. Reduced to the necessity of poking every\ninsect almost into his eyes before he could discover its\ncharacteristics, he would have sacrificed much to recover or replace\nhis glasses, but as such articles were not to be procured at any price,\nhe contented himself with the permission to go where he pleased within\nthe limits of the palisade. His keepers knew him well enough to be\nsatisfied that he would make no attempt to escape, and as the enclosure\nwas nearly a mile in circumference, containing many shrubs and trees\nand huts with thatched roofs, besides being intersected by a running\nstream, it afforded him a very fair scope for his researches, and who\nshould say that he would not discover some novel specimen to which, in\nthe records of entomological science, his own name might be assigned?\n\nIf thus the domain of Antonio Alvez was sufficient to satisfy Benedict,\nto little Jack it might well seem immense. But though allowed to ramble\nover the whole place as he liked, the child rarely cared to leave his\nmother; he would be continually inquiring about his father, whom he had\nnow so long been expecting to see: he would ask why Nan and Hercules\nand Dingo had gone away and left him; and perpetually he would be\nexpressing his wonder where Dick could be, and wishing he would come\nback again. Mrs. Weldon could only hide her tears and answer him by\ncaresses.\n\nNothing, however, transpired to give the least intimation that any of\nthe prisoners were to be treated otherwise than they had been upon the\njourney from the Coanza. Excepting such as were retained for old Alvez'\npersonal service, all the slaves had been sold, and the storehouses\nwere now full of stuffs and ivory, the stuffs destined to be sent into\nthe central provinces and the ivory to be exported. The establishment\nwas thus no longer crowded as it had been, and Mrs. Weldon and Jack\nwere lodged in a different hut to Cousin Benedict. All three, however,\ntook their meals together and were allowed a sufficient diet of mutton\nor goats'-flesh, vegetables, manioc, sorghum and native fruits. With\nthe traders' servants they held no communication, but Halima, a young\nslave who had been told off to attend to Mrs. Weldon, evinced for her\nnew mistress an attachment which, though rough, was evidently sincere.\n\n[Illustration: He contented himself with the permission to go where he\npleased within the limits of the palisade.]\n\nOld Alvez, who occupied the principal house in thed\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t, was rarely\nseen; whilst the non-appearance of either Harris or Negoro caused Mrs.\nWeldon much surprise and perplexity. In the midst of all her troubles,\ntoo, she was haunted by the thought of the anxiety her husband must be\nsuffering on her account. Unaware of her having embarked on board the\n\"Pilgrim,\" at first he would have wondered at steamer after steamer\narriving at San Francisco without her. After a while the \"Pilgrim\"\nwould have been registered amongst the number of missing ships; and it\nwas certain the intelligence would be forwarded to him by his\ncorrespondents, that the vessel had sailed from Auckland with his wife\nand child on board. What was he to imagine? he might refuse to believe\nthat they had perished at sea, but he would never dream of their having\nbeen carried to Africa, and would certainly institute a search in no\nother direction than on the coast of America, or amongst the isles of\nthe Pacific. She had not the faintest hope of her whereabouts being\ndiscovered, and involuntarily her thoughts turned to the possibility of\nmaking an escape. She might well feel her heart sink within her at the\nbare idea; even if she should succeed in eluding the vigilance of the\nwatch, there were two hundred miles of dense forest to be traversed\nbefore the coast could be reached; nevertheless, it revealed itself to\nher as her last chance, and failing all else, she resolved to hazard it.\n\nBut, first of all, she determined, if it were possible, to discover the\nultimate design of Negoro. She was not kept long in suspense. On the\n6th of June, just a week after the royal funeral, the Portuguese\nentered the dep\u00c3\u00b3t, in which he had not set foot since his return, and\nmade his way straight to the hut in which he knew he should find the\nprisoner. Benedict was out insect-hunting; Jack, under Halima's charge,\nwas being taken for a walk. Mrs. Weldon was alone.\n\nNegoro pushed open the door, and said abruptly,--\n\n\"Mrs. Weldon, I have come to tell you, that Tom and his lot have been\nsold for the Ujiji market; Nan died on her way here; and Dick Sands is\ndead too.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon uttered a cry of horror.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Weldon,\" he continued; \"he has got what he deserved; he shot\nHarris, and has been executed for the murder. And here you are alone!\nmark this! alone and in my power!\"\n\nWhat Negoro said was true; Tom, Bat, Act\u00c3\u00a6on, and Austin had all been\nsent off that morning on their way to Ujiji.\n\nMrs. Weldon groaned bitterly.\n\nNegoro went on.\n\n\"If I chose, I could still further avenge upon you the ill-treatment I\ngot on board that ship; but it does not suit my purpose to kill you.\nYou and that boy of yours, and that idiot of a fly-catcher, all have a\ncertain value in the market. I mean to sell you.\"\n\n\"You dare not!\" said Mrs. Weldon firmly; \"you know you are making an\nidle threat; who do you suppose would purchase people of white blood?\"\n\n\"I know a customer who will give me the price I mean to ask,\" replied\nNegoro with a brutal grin.\n\nShe bent down her head; only too well she knew that such things were\npossible in this horrid land.\n\n\"Tell me who he is!\" she said; \"tell the name of the man who ...\"\n\n\"James Weldon,\" he answered slowly.\n\n\"My husband!\" she cried; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean what I say. I mean to make your husband buy you back at my\nprice; and if he likes to pay for them, he shall have his son and his\ncousin too.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"I suppose Weldon will not mind coming to fetch you?\"]\n\n\"And when, and how, may I ask, do you propose to manage this?\" replied\nMrs. Weldon, forcing herself to be calm.\n\n\"Here, and soon too. I suppose Weldon will not mind coming to fetch\nyou.\"\n\n\"He would not hesitate to come; but how could he know we are here?\"\n\n\"I will go to him. I have money that will take me to San Francisco.\"\n\n\"What you stole from the 'Pilgrim'?\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Just so,\" replied Negoro; \"and I have plenty more I suppose when\nWeldon hears that you are a prisoner in Central Africa, he will not\nthink much of a hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"But how is he to know the truth of your statement?\"\n\n\"I shall take him a letter from you. You shall represent me as your\nfaithful servant, just escaped from the hands of savages.\"\n\n\"A letter such as that I will never write; never,\" said Mrs. Weldon\ndecisively.\n\n\"What? what? you refuse?\"\n\n\"I refuse.\"\n\nShe had all the natural cravings of a woman and a wife, but so\nthoroughly was she aware of the treachery of the man she had to deal\nwith, that she dreaded lest, as soon as he had touched the ransom, he\nwould dispose of her husband altogether.\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\n\"You will write that letter,\" said Negoro.\n\n\"Never!\" repeated Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Remember your child!\"\n\nMrs. Weldon's heart beat violently, but she did not answer a word.\n\n\"I will give you a week to think over this,\" hissed out Negoro.\n\nMrs. Weldon was still silent.\n\n\"A week! I will come again in a week; you will do as I wish, or it will\nbe the worse for you.\"\n\nHe gnashed his teeth, turned on his heel, and left the hut.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nA RAY OF HOPE.\n\n\nMrs. Weldon's first feeling on being left alone was a sense of relief\nat having a week's respite. She had no trust in Negoro's honesty, but\nshe knew well enough that their \"marketable value\" would secure them\nfrom any personal danger, and she had time to consider whether some\ncompromise might be effected by which her husband might be spared the\nnecessity of coming to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. Upon the receipt of a letter from\nherself, he would not hesitate for a moment in undertaking the journey,\nbut she entertained no little fear that after all perhaps her own\ndeparture might not be permitted; the slightest caprice on the part of\nQueen Moena would detain her as a captive, whilst as to Negoro, if once\nhe should get the ransom he wanted, he would take no further pains in\nthe matter.\n\nAccordingly, she resolved to make the proposition that she should be\nconveyed to some point upon the coast, where the bargain could be\nconcluded without Mr. Weldon's coming up the country.\n\nShe had to weigh all the consequences that would follow any refusal on\nher part to fall in with Negoro's demands. Of course, he would spend\nthe interval in preparing for his start to America, and when he should\ncome back and find her still hesitating, was it not likely that he\nwould find scope for his revenge in suggesting that she must be\nseparated from her child.\n\nThe very thought sent a pang through her heart, and she clasped her\nlittle boy tenderly to her side.\n\n\"What makes you so sad, mamma?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I was thinking of your father, my child,\" she answered; \"would you not\nlike to see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; is he coming here?\"\n\n\"No, my boy, he must not come here.\"\n\n\"Then let us take Dick, and Tom, and Hercules, and go to him.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon tried to conceal her tears.\n\n\"Have you heard from papa?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why do you not write to him?\"\n\n\"Write to him?\" repeated his mother, \"that is the very thing I was\nthinking about.\"\n\nThe child little knew the agitation that was troubling her mind.\n\nMeanwhile Mrs. Weldon had another inducement which she hardly ventured\nto own to herself for postponing her final decision. Was it absolutely\nimpossible that her liberation should be effected by some different\nmeans altogether?\n\nA few days previously she had overheard a conversation outside her hut,\nand over this she had found herself continually pondering.\n\nAlvez and one of the Ujiji dealers, discussing the future prospects of\ntheir business, mutually agreed in denouncing the efforts that were\nbeing made for the suppression of the slave-traffic, not only by the\ncruisers on the coast, but by the intrusion of travellers and\nmissionaries into the interior.\n\nAlvez averred that all these troublesome visitors ought to be\nexterminated forthwith.\n\n\"But kill one, and another crops up,\" replied the dealer.\n\n\"Yes, their exaggerated reports bring up a swarm of them,\" said Alvez.\n\nIt seemed a subject of bitter complaint that the markets of Nyangw\u00c3\u00a9,\nZanzibar, and the lake-district had been invaded by Speke and Grant and\nothers, and although they congratulated each other that the western\nprovinces had not yet been much persecuted, they confessed that now\nthat the travelling epidemic had begun to rage, there was no telling\nhow soon a lot of European and American busy-bodies might be among\nthem. Thed\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4ts at Cassange and Bihe had both been visited, and\nalthough Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 had hitherto been left quiet, there were rumours\nenough that the continent was to be tramped over from east to west.[1]\n\n\n[Footnote: This extraordinary feat was, it is universally known,\nsubsequently accomplished by Cameron.]\n\n\n\"And it may be,\" continued Alvez, \"that that missionary fellow,\nLivingstone, is already on his way to us; if he comes there can be but\none result; there must be freedom for all the slaves in Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Freedom for the slaves in Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9!\" These were the words which in\nconnexion with Dr. Livingstone's name had arrested Mrs. Weldon's\nattention, and who can wonder that she pondered them over and over\nagain, and ventured to associate them with her own prospects?\n\nHere was a ray of hope!\n\nThe mere mention of Livingstone's name in association with this story\nseems to demand a brief survey of his career.\n\nBorn on the 19th of March, 1813, David Livingstone was the second of\nsix children of a tradesman in the village of Blantyre, in Lanarkshire.\nAfter two years' training in medicine and theology, he was sent out by\nthe London Missionary Society, and landed at the Cape of Good Hope in\n1840, with the intention of joining Moffat in South Africa. After\nexploring the country of the Bechuanas, he returned to Kuruman, and,\nhaving married Moffat's daughter, proceeded in 1843 to found a mission\nin the Mabotsa valley.\n\nAfter four years he removed to Kolobeng in the Bechuana district, 225\nmiles north of Kuruman, whence, in 1849, starting off with his wife,\nthree children, and two friends, Mr. Oswell and Mr. Murray, he\ndiscovered Lake Ngami, and returned by descending the course of the\nZouga.\n\nThe opposition of the natives had prevented his proceeding beyond Lake\nNgami at his first visit, and he made a second with no better success.\nIn a third attempt, however, he wended his way northwards with his\nfamily and Mr. Oswell along the Chob\u00c3\u00a9, an affluent of the Zambesi, and\nafter a difficult journey at length reached the district of the\nMakalolos, of whom the chief, named Sebituan\u00c3\u00a9, joined him at Linyant\u00c3\u00a9.\nThe Zambesi itself was discovered at the end of June, 1851, and the\ndoctor returned to the Cape for the purpose of sending his family to\nEngland.\n\n[Illustration: Dr. Livingstone. _Page_ 408.]\n\nHis next project was to cross the continent obliquely from south to\nwest, but in this expedition he had resolved that he would risk no life\nbut his own. Accompanied, therefore, by only a few natives, he started\nin the following June, and skirting the Kalahari desert entered\nLitoubarouba on the last day of the year; here he found the Bechuana\ndistrict much ravaged by the Boers, the original Dutch colonists, who\nhad formed the population of the Cape before it came into the\npossession of the English. After a fortnight's stay, he proceeded into\nthe heart of the district of the Bamangonatos, and travelled\ncontinuously until the 23rd of May, when he arrived at Linyant\u00c3\u00a9, and\nwas received with much honour by Sekeletoo, who had recently become\nsovereign of the Makalolos. A severe attack of fever detained the\ntraveller here for a period, but he made good use of the enforced rest\nby studying the manners of the country, and became for the first time\nsensible of its terrible sufferings in consequence of the slave-trade.\n\nDescending the course of the Chob\u00c3\u00a9 to the Zambesi, he next entered\nNaniele, and after visiting Katonga and Libonta, advanced to the point\nof confluence of the Leeba with the Zambesi, where he determined upon\nascending the former as far as the Portuguese possessions in the west;\nit was an undertaking, however, that required considerable preparation,\nso that it was necessary for him to return to Linyant\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nOn the 11th of November he again started. He was accompanied by\ntwenty-seven Makalolos, and ascended the Leeba till, in the territory\nof the Balonda, he reached a spot where it received the waters of its\ntributary the Makondo.\n\nIt was the first time a white man had ever penetrated so far.\n\nProceeding on their way, they arrived at the residence of Shint\u00c3\u00a9, the\nmost powerful of the chieftains of the Balonda, by whom they were well\nreceived, and having met with equal kindness from Kateema, a ruler on\nthe other side of the Leeba, they encamped, on the 20th of February,\n1853, on the banks of Lake Dilolo.\n\nHere it was that the real difficulty commenced; the arduous travelling,\nthe attacks of the natives, and their exorbitant demands, the\nconspiracies of his own attendants and their desertions, would soon\nhave caused any one of less energy to abandon his enterprise; but David\nLivingstone was not a man to be daunted; resolutely he persevered, and\non the 4th of April reached the banks of the Coango, the stream that\nforms the frontier of the Portuguese possessions, and joins the Zaire\non the north.\n\nSix days later he passed through Cassang\u00c3\u00a9. Here it was that Alvez had\nseen him. On the 31st of May he arrived at St. Paul de Loanda, having\ntraversed the continent in about two years.\n\nIt was not long, however, before he was off again. Following the banks\nof the Coanza, the river which was to bring such trying experiences to\nDick Sands and his party, he reached the Lomb\u00c3\u00a9, and having met numbers\nof slave-caravans on his way, again passed through Cassange, crossed\nthe Coango, and reached the Zambesi at Kewawa. By the 8th of the\nfollowing June he was again at Lake Dilolo, and descending the river,\nhe re-entered Linyant\u00c3\u00a9. Here he stayed till the 3rd of November, when\nhe commenced his second great journey, which was to carry him\ncompletely across Africa from west to east.\n\nAfter visiting the famed Victoria Falls, the intrepid explorer quitted\nthe Zambesi, and took a north-easterly route. The transit of the\nterritory of the Batokas, a people brutalized by the inhalation of\nhemp; a visit to Semalemboni the powerful chief of the district; the\npassage of the Kafoni; a visit to king Mbourouma; an inspection of the\nruins of Zumbo, an old Portuguese town; a meeting with the chief\nMpend\u00c3\u00a9, at that time at war with the Portuguese, these were the\nprincipal events of this journey, and on the 22nd of April, Livingstone\nleft Tet\u00c3\u00a9, and having descended the river as far as its delta, reached\nQuiliman\u00c3\u00a9, just four years after his last departure from the Cape. On\nthe 12th of July he embarked for the Mauritius, and on the 22nd of\nDecember, 1856, he landed in England after an absence of sixteen years.\n\n[Illustration: With none to guide him except a few natives.]\n\nLoaded with honours by the Geographical Societies of London and Paris,\nbrilliantly entertained by all ranks, it would have been no matter of\nsurprise if he had surrendered himself to a well-earned repose; but no\nthought of permanent rest occurred to him, and on the 1st of March,\n1858, accompanied by his brother Charles, Captain Bedingfield, Dr.\nKirk, Dr. Miller, Mr. Thornton, and Mr. Baines, he started again, with\nthe intention of exploring the basin of the Zambesi, and arrived in due\ntime at the coast of Mozambique.\n\nThe party ascended the great river by the Kongone mouth; they were on\nboard a small steamer named the \"Ma-Robert,\" and reached Tet\u00c3\u00a9 on the\n8th of September.\n\nDuring the following year they investigated the lower course of the\nZambesi, and its left affluent the Shir\u00c3\u00a9, and having visited Lake\nShirwa, they explored the territory of the Manganjas, and discovered\nLake Nyassa. In August, 1860, they returned to the Victoria Falls.\n\nEarly in the following year, Bishop Mackenzie and his missionary staff\narrived at the mouth of the Zambesi.\n\nIn March an exploration of the Rovouma was made on board the \"Pioneer,\"\nthe exploring party returning afterwards to Lake Nyassa, where they\nremained a considerable time. The 30th of January, 1862, was signalized\nby the arrival of Mrs. Livingstone, and by the addition of another\nsteamer, the \"Lady Nyassa;\" but the happiness of reunion was very\ntransient; it was but a short time before the enthusiastic Bishop\nMackenzie succumbed to the unhealthiness of the climate, and on the\n27th of April Mrs. Livingstone expired in her husband's arms.\n\nA second investigation of the Rovouma soon followed and at the end of\nNovember the doctor returned to the Zambesi, and reascended the Shire.\nIn the spring of 1803 he lost his companion Mr. Thornton, and as his\nbrother and Dr. Kirk were both much debilitated, he insisted upon their\nreturn to Europe, while he himself returned for the third time to Lake\nNyassa, and completed the hydrographical survey which already he had\nbegun.\n\nA few months later found him once more at the mouth of the Zambesi;\nthence he crossed over to Zanzibar, and after five years' absence\narrived in London, where he published his work, \"The exploration of the\nZambesi and its affluents.\"\n\nStill unwearied and insatiable in his longings, he was back again in\nZanzibar at the commencement of 1866, ready to begin his fourth\njourney, this time attended only by a few sepoys and negroes.\nWitnessing on his way some horrible scenes which were perpetrated as\nthe result of the prosecution of the slave-trade, he proceeded to\nMokalaos\u00c3\u00a9 on the shores of Lake Nyassa, where nearly all his attendants\ndeserted him, and returned to Zanzibar with the report that he was dead.\n\nDr. Livingstone meanwhile was not only alive, but undaunted in his\ndetermination to visit the country between the two lakes Nyassa and\nTanganyika. With none to guide him except a few natives, he crossed the\nLoangona, and in the following April discovered Lake Liemmba. Here he\nlay for a whole month hovering between life and death, but rallying a\nlittle he pushed on to the north shore of Lake Moero. Taking up his\nquarters at Cazemb\u00c3\u00a9 for six weeks, he made two separate explorations of\nthe lake, and then started farther northwards, intending to reach\nUjiji, an important town upon Lake Tanganyika; overtaken, however, by\nfloods, and again abandoned by his servants, he was obliged to retrace\nhis steps. Six weeks afterwards he had made his way southwards to the\ngreat lake Bangweolo, whence once more he started towards Tanganyika.\n\nThis last effort was most trying, and the doctor had grown so weak that\nhe was obliged to be carried, but he reached Ujiji, where he was\ngratified by finding some supplies that had been thoughtfully forwarded\nto him by the Oriental Society at Calcutta.\n\n[Illustration: \"You are Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\"]\n\nHis great aim now was to ascend the lake, and reach the sources of the\nNile. On the 21st of September he was at Bambarr\u00c3\u00a9, in the country of\nthe cannibal Manyuema, upon the Lualaba, the river afterwards\nascertained by Stanley to be the Upper Zaire or Congo. At Mamobela the\ndoctor was ill for twenty-four days, tended only by three followers who\ncontinued faithful; but in July he made a vigorous effort, and although\nhe was reduced to a skeleton, made his way back to Ujiji.\n\nDuring this long time no tidings of Livingstone reached Europe, and\nmany were the misgivings lest the rumours of his death were only too\ntrue. He was himself, too, almost despairing as to receiving any help.\nBut help was closer at hand than he thought. On the 3rd of November,\nonly eleven days after his return to Ujiji, some gun shots were heard\nwithin half a mile of the lake. The doctor went out to ascertain whence\nthey proceeded, and had not gone far before a white man stood before\nhim.\n\n\"You are Dr. Livingstone, I presume,\" said the stranger, raising his\ncap.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am Dr. Livingstone, and am happy to see you,\" answered the\ndoctor, smiling kindly.\n\nThe two shook each other warmly by the hand.\n\nThe new arrival was Henry Stanley, the correspondent of the _New York\nHerald_, who had been sent out by Mr. Bennett, the editor, in search of\nthe great African explorer. On receiving his orders in October, 1870,\nwithout a day's unnecessary delay he had embarked at Bombay for\nZanzibar, and, after a journey involving considerable peril, had\narrived safely at Ujiji.\n\nVery soon the two travellers found themselves on the best of terms, and\nset out together on an excursion to the north of Tanganyika. They\nproceeded as far as Cape Magala, and decided that the chief outlet of\nthe lake must be an affluent of the Lualaba, a conclusion that was\nsubsequently confirmed by Cameron.\n\nTowards the end of the year Stanley began to prepare to return.\nLivingstone accompanied him as far as Kwihara, and on the 3rd of the\nfollowing March they parted.\n\n\"You have done for me what few men would venture to do; I am truly\ngrateful,\" said Livingstone.\n\nStanley could scarcely repress his tears as he expressed his hope that\nthe doctor might be spared to return to his friends safe and well.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" said Stanley, choked with emotion.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" answered the veteran feebly.\n\nThus they parted, and in July, 1872, Stanley landed at Marseilles.\n\nAgain David Livingstone resumed his researches in the interior.\n\nAfter remaining five months at Kwihara he gathered together a retinue\nconsisting of his faithful followers Suzi, Chumah, Amoda, and Jacob\nWainwright, and fifty-six men sent to him by Stanley, and lost no time\nin proceeding towards the south of Tanganyika. In the course of the\nensuing month the caravan encountered some frightful storms, but\nsucceeded in reaching Moura. There had previously been an extreme\ndrought, which was now followed by the rainy season, which entailed the\nloss of many of the beasts of burden, in consequence of the bites of\nthe tzetsy.\n\nOn the 24th of January they were at Chitounkw\u00c3\u00a9, and in April, after\nrounding the east of Lake Bangweolo, they made their way towards the\nvillage of Chitambo. At this point it was that Livingstone had parted\ncompany with certain slave-dealers, who had carried the information to\nold Alvez that the missionary traveller would very likely proceed by\nway of Loanda to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nBut on the 13th of June, the very day before Negoro reckoned on\nobtaining from Mrs. Weldon the letter which should be the means of\nsecuring him a hundred thousand dollars, tidings were circulated in the\ndistrict that on the 1st of May Dr. Livingstone had breathed his last.\n\nThe report proved perfectly true. On the 29th of April the caravan had\nreached the village of Chitambo, the doctor so unwell that he was\ncarried on a litter. The following night he was in great pain, and\nafter repeatedly murmuring in a low voice, \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" he fell\ninto a kind of stupor. A short time afterwards he called up Suzi, and\nhaving asked for some medicine, told his attendant that he should not\nrequire anything more.\n\n\"You can go now.\"\n\nAbout four o'clock next morning, when an anxious visit was made to his\nroom, the doctor was found kneeling by the bed-side, his head in his\nhands, in the attitude of prayer. Suzi touched him, but his forehead\nwas icy with the coldness of death. He had died in the night.\n\nHis body was carried by those who loved him, and in spite of many\nobstacles was brought to Zanzibar, whence, nine months after his death,\nit was conveyed to England. On the 12th of April, 1874, it was interred\nin Westminster Abbey, counted worthy to be deposited amongst those whom\nthe country most delights to honour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nAN EXCITING CHASE.\n\n\nTo say the truth, it was the very vaguest of hopes to which Mrs. Weldon\nhad been clinging, yet it was not without some thrill of disappointment\nthat she heard from the lips of old Alvez himself that Dr. Livingstone\nhad died at a little village on Lake Bangweolo. There had appeared to\nbe a sort of a link binding her to the civilized world, but it was now\nabruptly snapped, and nothing remained for her but to make what terms\nshe could with the base and heartless Negoro.\n\nOn the 14th, the day appointed for the interview, he made his\nappearance at the hut, firmly resolved to make no abatement in the\nterms that he had proposed, Mrs. Weldon, on her part, being equally\ndetermined not to yield to the demand.\n\n\"There is only one condition,\" she avowed, \"upon which I will\nacquiesce. My husband shall not be required to come up the country\nhere.\"\n\nNegoro hesitated; at length he said that he would agree to her husband\nbeing taken by ship to Mossamedes, a small port in the south of Angola,\nmuch frequented by slavers, whither also, at a date hereafter to be\nfixed, Alvez should send herself with Jack and Benedict; the\nstipulation was confirmed that the ransom should be 100,000 dollars,\nand it was further made part of the contract that Negoro should be\nallowed to depart as an honest man.\n\nMrs. Weldon felt she had gained an important point in thus sparing her\nhusband the necessity of a journey to Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, and had no\napprehensions about herself on her way to Mossamedes, knowing that it\nwas to the interest of Alvez and Negoro alike to attend carefully to\nher wants.\n\nUpon the terms of the covenant being thus arranged, Mrs. Weldon wrote\nsuch a letter to her husband as she knew would bring him with all speed\nto Mossamedes, but she left it entirely to Negoro to represent himself\nin whatever light he chose. Once in possession of the document, Negoro\nlost no time in starting on his errand. The very next morning, taking\nwith him about twenty negroes, he set off towards the north, alleging\nto Alvez as his motive for taking that direction, that he was not only\ngoing to embark somewhere at the mouth of the Congo, but that he was\nanxious to keep as far as possible from the prison-houses of the\nPortuguese, with which already he had been involuntarily only too\nfamiliar.\n\nAfter his departure, Mrs. Weldon resolved to make the best of her\nperiod of imprisonment, aware that it could hardly be less than four\nmonths before he would return. She had no desire to go beyond the\nprecincts assigned her, even had the privilege been allowed her; but\nwarned by Negoro that Hercules was still free, and might at any time\nattempt a rescue, Alvez had no thought of permitting her any\nunnecessary liberty. Her life therefore soon resumed its previous\nmonotony.\n\nThe daily routine went on within the enclosure pretty much as in other\nparts of the town, the women all being employed in various labours for\nthe benefit of their husbands and masters. The rice was pounded with\nwooden pestles; the maize was peeled and winnowed, previously to\nextracting the granulous substance for the drink which they call\n_mtyell\u00c3\u00a9_; the sorghum had to be gathered in, the season of its\nripening being marked by festive observances; there was a fragrant oil\nto be expressed from a kind of olive named the _mpafoo_; the cotton had\nto be spun on spindles, which were hardly less than a foot and a half\nin length; there was the bark of trees to be woven into textures for\nwearing; the manioc had to be dug up, and the cassava procured from its\nroots; and besides all this, there was the preparation of the soil for\nits future plantings, the usual productions of the country being the\n_moritsan\u00c3\u00a9_ beans, growing in pods fifteen inches long upon stems\ntwenty feet high, the _arachides_, from which they procure a\nserviceable oil, the _chilob\u00c3\u00a9_ pea, the blossoms of which are used to\ngive a flavour to the insipid sorghum, cucumbers, of which the seeds\nare roasted as chestnuts, as well as the common crops of coffee, sugar,\nonions, guavas, and sesame.\n\nTo the women's lot, too, falls the manipulation of all the fermented\ndrinks, the _malafoo_, made from bananas, the _pomb\u00c3\u00a9_, and various\nother liquors. Nor should the care of all the domestic animals be\nforgotten; the cows that will not allow themselves to be milked unless\nthey can see their calf, or a stuffed representative of it; the\nshort-horned heifers that not unfrequently have a hump; the goats that,\nlike slaves, form part of the currency of the country; the pigs, the\nsheep, and the poultry.\n\nThe men, meanwhile, smoke their hemp or tobacco, hunt buffaloes or\nelephants, or are hired by the dealers to join in the slave-raids; the\nharvest of slaves, in fact, being a thing of as regular and periodic\nrecurrence as the ingathering of the maize.\n\nIn her daily strolls, Mrs. Weldon would occasionally pause to watch the\nwomen, but they only responded to her notice by a long stare or by a\nhideous grimace; a kind of natural instinct made them hate a white\nskin, and they had no spark of commiseration for the stranger who had\nbeen brought among them; Halima, however, was a marked exception, she\ngrew more and more devoted to her mistress, and by degrees, the two\nbecame able to exchange many sentences in the native dialect.\n\nJack generally accompanied his mother. Naturally enough he longed to\nget outside the enclosure, but still he found considerable amusement in\nwatching the birds that built in a huge baobab that grew within; there\nwere maraboos making their nests with twigs; there were\nscarlet-throated _souimangas_ with nests like weaver-birds; widow birds\nthat helped themselves liberally to the thatch of the huts; _calaos_\nwith their tuneful song; grey parrots, with bright red tails, called\n_roufs_ by the Manyuema, who apply the same name to their reigning\nchiefs; and insect-eating _drongos_, like grey linnets with large red\nbeaks. Hundreds of butterflies flitted about, especially in the\nneighbourhood of the brooks; but these were more to the taste of Cousin\nBenedict than of little Jack; over and over again the child expressed\nhis regret that he could not see over the walls, and more than ever he\nseemed to miss his friend Dick, who had taught him to climb a mast, and\nwho he was sure would have fine fun with him in the branches of the\ntrees, which were growing sometimes to the height of a hundred feet.\n\n[Illustration: The insufferable heat had driven all the residents\nwithin the dep\u00c3\u00b3t indoors.]\n\nSo long as the supply of insects did not fail, Benedict would have been\ncontented to stay on without a murmur in his present quarters. True,\nwithout his glasses he worked at a disadvantage; but he had had the\ngood fortune to discover a minute bee that forms its cells in the holes\nof worm-eaten wood, and a \"sphex\" that practises the craft of the\ncuckoo, and deposits its eggs in an abode not prepared by itself.\nMosquitos abounded in swarms, and the worthy naturalist was so covered\nby their stings as to be hardly recognizable; but when Mrs. Weldon\nremonstrated with him for exposing himself so unnecessarily, he merely\nscratched the irritated places on his skin, and said--\n\n\"It is their instinct, you know; it is their instinct.\"\n\nOn the 17th of June an adventure happened to him which was attended\nwith unexpected consequences. It was about eleven o'clock in the\nmorning. The insufferable heat had driven all the residents within the\nd\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t indoors, and not a native was to be seen in the streets of\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. Mrs. Weldon was dozing; Jack was fast asleep. Benedict\nhimself, sorely against his will, for he heard the hum of many an\ninsect in the sunshine, had been driven to the seclusion of his cabin,\nand was falling into an involuntary siesta.\n\nSuddenly a buzz was heard, an insect's wing vibrating some fifteen\nthousand beats a second!\n\n\"A hexapod!\" cried Benedict, sitting up.\n\nShort-sighted though he was, his hearing was acute, and his perception\nmade him thoroughly convinced that he was in proximity to some giant\nspecimen of its kind. Without moving from his seat he did his utmost to\nascertain what it was; he was determined not to flinch from the\nsharpest of stings if only he could get the chance of capturing it.\nPresently he made out a large black speck flitting about in the few\nrays of daylight that were allowed to penetrate the hut. With bated\nbreath he waited in eager expectation. The insect, after long hovering\nabove him, finally settled on his head. A smile of satisfaction played\nabout his lips as he felt it crawling lightly through his hair. Equally\nfearful of missing or injuring it, he restrained his first impulse to\ngrasp it in his hand.\n\n\"I will wait a minute,\" he thought; \"perhaps it may creep down my nose;\nby squinting a little perhaps I shall be able to see it.\"\n\nFor some moments hope alternated with fear. There sat Benedict with\nwhat he persuaded himself was some new African hexapod perched upon his\nhead, and agitated by doubts as to the direction in which it would\nmove. Instead of travelling in the way he reckoned along his nose,\nmight it not crawl behind his ears or down his neck, or, worse than\nall, resume its flight in the air?\n\nFortune seemed inclined to favour him. After threading the entanglement\nof the naturalist's hair the insect was felt to be descending his\nforehead. With a fortitude not unworthy of the Spartan who suffered his\nbreast to be gnawed by a fox, nor of the Roman hero who plunged his\nhand into the red-hot coals, Benedict endured the tickling of the six\nsmall feet, and made not a motion that might frighten the creature into\ntaking wing. After making repeated circuits of his forehead, it passed\njust between his eyebrows; there was a moment of deep suspense lest it\nshould once more go upwards; but it soon began to move again; neither\nto the right nor to the left did it turn, but kept straight on over the\nfurrows made by the constant rubbing of the spectacles, right along the\narch of the cartilage till it reached the extreme tip of the nose. Like\na couple of movable lenses, Benedict's two eyes steadily turned\nthemselves inwards till they were directed to the proper point.\n\n[Illustration: Before long the old black speck was again flitting just\nabove his head. _Page_ 432.]\n\n\"Good!\" he whispered to himself.\n\nHe was exulting at the discovery that what he had been waiting for so\npatiently was a rare specimen of the tribe of the Cicindelid\u00c3\u00a6, peculiar\nto the districts of Southern Africa.\n\n\"A tuberous manticora!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe insect began to move again, and as it crawled down to the entrance\nof the nostrils the tickling sensation became too much for endurance,\nand Benedict sneezed. He made a sudden clutch, but of course he only\ncaught his own nose. His vexation was very great, but he did not lose\nhis composure; he knew that the manticora rarely flies very high, and\nthat more frequently than not it simply crawls. Accordingly he groped\nabout a long time on his hands and knees, and at last he found it\nbasking in a ray of sunshine within a foot of him. His resolution was\nsoon taken. He would not run the risk of crushing it by trying to catch\nit, but would make his observations on it as it crawled; and so with\nhis nose close to the ground, like a dog upon the scent, he followed it\non all fours, admiring it and examining it as it moved. Regardless of\nthe heat he not only left the doorway of his hut, but continued\ncreeping along till he reached the enclosing palisade.\n\nAt the foot of the fence the manticora, according to the habits of its\nkind, began to seek a subterranean retreat, and coming to the opening\nof a mole-track entered it at once. Benedict quite thought he had now\nlost sight of his prize altogether, but his surprise was very great\nwhen he found that the aperture was at least two feet wide, and that it\nled into a gallery which would admit his whole body. His momentary\nfeeling of astonishment, however, gave way to his eagerness to follow\nup the hexapod, and he continued burrowing like a ferret.\n\nWithout knowing it, he actually passed under the palisading, and was\nnow beyond it;--the mole-track, in fact, was a communication that had\nbeen made between the interior and exterior of the enclosure. Benedict\nhad obtained his freedom, but so far from caring in the least for his\nliberty he continued totally absorbed in the pursuit upon which he had\nstarted. He watched with unflagging vigilance, and it was only when the\nhexapod expanded its wings as if for flight that he prepared to\nimprison it in the hollow of his hand.\n\nAll at once, however, he was taken by surprise; a whizz and a whirr and\nthe prize was gone!\n\nDisappointed rather than despairing, Benedict raised himself up, and\nlooked about him. Before long the old black speck was again flitting\njust above his head. There was every reason to hope that it would\nultimately settle once more upon the ground, but on this side of the\npalisade there was a large forest a little way to the north, and if the\nmanticora were to get into its mass of foliage all hope of keeping it\nin view would be lost, and there would be an end of the proud\nexpectation of storing it in the tin box, to be preserved among the\nrest of the entomological wonders.\n\nAfter a while the insect descended to the earth; it did not rest at\nall, nor crawl as it had done previously, but made its advance by a\nseries of rapid hops. This made the chase for the near-sighted\nnaturalist a matter of great difficulty; he put his face as close to\nthe ground as possible, and kept starting off and stopping and starting\noff again with his arms extended like a swimming frog, continually\nmaking frantic clutches to find as continually that his grasp had been\neluded.\n\nAfter running till he was out of breath, and scratching his hands\nagainst the brushwood and the foliage till they bled, he had the\nmortification of feeling the insect dash past his ear with what might\nbe a defiant buzz, and finding that it was out of sight for ever.\n\n\"Ungrateful hexapod!\" he cried in dismay, \"I intended to honour you\nwith the best place in my collection.\"\n\n[Illustration: For that day at least Cousin Benedict had lost his\nchance of being the happiest of entomologists. _Page 435._]\n\nHe knew not what to do, and could not reconcile himself to the loss; he\nreproached himself for not having secured the manticora at the first;\nhe gazed at the forest till he persuaded himself he could see the\ncoveted insect in the distance, and, seized with a frantic impulse,\nexclaimed,--\n\n\"I will have you yet!\"\n\nHe did not even yet realize the fact that he had gained his liberty,\nbut heedless of everything except his own burning disappointment, and\nat the risk of being attacked by natives or beset by wild beasts, he\nwas just on the very point of dashing into the heart of the wood when\nsuddenly a giant form confronted him, as suddenly a giant hand seized\nhim by the nape of his neck, and, lifting him up, carried him off with\napparently as little exertion as he could himself have carried off his\nhexapod!\n\nFor that day at least Cousin Benedict had lost his chance of being the\nhappiest of entomologists.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nA MAGICIAN.\n\n\nOn finding that Cousin Benedict did not return to his quarters at the\nproper hour, Mrs. Weldon began to feel uneasy. She could not imagine\nwhat had become of him; his tin box with its contents were safe in his\nhut, and even if a chance of escape had been offered him, she knew that\nnothing would have induced him voluntarily to abandon his treasures.\nShe enlisted the services of Halima, and spent the remainder of the day\nin searching for him, until at last she felt herself driven to the\nconviction that he must have been confined by the orders of Alvez\nhimself; for what reason she could not divine, as Benedict had\nundoubtedly been included in the number of prisoners to be delivered to\nMr. Weldon for the stipulated ransom.\n\nBut the rage of the trader when he heard of the escape of the captive\nwas an ample proof that he had had no hand in his disappearance. A\nrigorous search was instituted in every direction, which resulted in\nthe discovery of the mole-track. Here beyond a question was the passage\nthrough which the fly-catcher had found his way.\n\n\"Idiot! fool! rascal!\" muttered Alvez, full of rage at the prospect of\nlosing a portion of the redemption-money; \"if ever I get hold of him,\nhe shall pay dearly for this freak.\"\n\nThe opening was at once blocked up, the woods were scoured all round\nfor a considerable distance, but no trace of Benedict was to be found.\nMrs. Weldon was bitterly grieved and much overcome, but she had no\nalternative except to resign herself as best she could to the loss of\nher unfortunate relation; there was a tinge of bitterness in her\nanxiety, for she could not help being irritated at the recklessness\nwith which he had withdrawn himself from the reach of her protection.\n\nMeanwhile the weather for the time of year underwent a very unusual\nchange. Although the rainy season is ordinarily reckoned to terminate\nabout the end of April, the sky had suddenly become overcast in the\nmiddle of June, rain had recommenced falling, and the downpour had been\nso heavy and continuous that all the ground was thoroughly sodden. To\nMrs. Weldon personally this incessant rainfall brought no other\ninconvenience beyond depriving her of her daily exercise, but to the\nnatives in general it was a very serious calamity.\n\nThe ripening crops in the low-lying districts were completely flooded,\nand the inhabitants feared that they would be reduced to the greatest\nextremities; all agricultural pursuits had come to a standstill, and\nneither the queen nor her ministers could devise any expedient to avert\nor mitigate the misfortune. They resolved at last to have recourse to\nthe magicians, not those who are called in request to heal diseases or\nto procure good luck, but to the _mganga_, sorcerers of a superior\norder, who are credited with the faculty of invoking or dispelling rain.\n\nBut it was all to no purpose. It was in vain that the _mganga_\nmonotoned their incantations, flourished their rattles, jingled their\nbells, and exhibited their amulets; it was equally without avail that\nthey rolled up their balls of dirt and spat in the faces of all the\ncourtiers: the pitiless rain continued to descend, and the malign\ninfluences that were ruling the clouds refused to be propitiated.\n\nThe prospect seemed to become more and more hopeless, when the report\nwas brought to Moena that there was a most wonderful _mganga_ resident\nin the north of Angola. He had never been seen in this part of the\ncountry, but fame declared him to be a magician of the very highest\norder. Application, without delay, should be made to him; he surely\nwould be able to stay the rain.\n\nEarly in the morning of the 25th a great tinkling of bells announced\nthe magician's arrival at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9. The natives poured out to meet him\non his way to the _chitoka_, their minds being already predisposed in\nhis favour by a moderation of the downpour, and by sundry indications\nof a coming change of wind.\n\nThe ordinary practice of the professors of the magical art is to\nperambulate the villages in parties of three or four, accompanied by a\nconsiderable number of acolytes and assistants. In this case the\n_mganga_ came entirely alone. He was a pure negro of most imposing\nstature, more than six feet high, and broad in proportion. All over his\nchest was a fantastic pattern traced in pipe-clay, the lower portion of\nhis body being covered with a flowing skirt of woven grass, so long\nthat it made a train. Round his neck hung a string of birds' skulls,\nupon his head he wore a leathern helmet ornamented with pearls and\nplumes, and about his waist was a copper girdle, to which was attached\nbells that tinkled like the harness of a Spanish mule. The only\ninstrument indicating his art was a basket he carried made of a\ncalabash containing shells, amulets, little wooden idols and other\nfetishes, together with what was more important than all, a large\nnumber of those balls of dung, without which no African ceremony of\ndivination could ever be complete.\n\nOne peculiarity was soon discovered by the crowd; the _mganga_ was\ndumb, and could utter only one low, guttural sound, which was quite\nunintelligible; this was a circumstance, however, that seemed only to\naugment their faith in his powers.\n\nWith a stately strut that brought all his tinkling paraphernalia into\nfull play, the magician proceeded to make the circuit of the\nmarket-place. The natives followed in a troop behind, endeavouring,\nlike monkeys, to imitate his every movement. He turned into the main\nthoroughfare, and began to make his way direct to the royal residence,\nwhence, as soon as the queen heard of his approach, she advanced to\nmeet him. On seeing her, the _mganga_ bowed to the very dust; then,\nrearing himself to his full height, he pointed aloft, and by the\nsignificance of his animated gestures indicated that, although the\nfleeting clouds were now going to the west, they would soon return\neastwards with a rotatory motion irresistibly strong.\n\n[Illustration: The entire crowd joined in. _Page_ 441.]\n\nAll at once, to the surprise of the beholders, he stooped and took the\nhand of the mighty sovereign of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe courtiers hurried forward to check the unprecedented breach of\netiquette, but the foremost was driven back with so staggering a blow\nthat the others deemed it prudent to retire.\n\nThe queen herself appeared not to take the least offence at the\nfamiliarity; she bestowed a hideous grimace, which was meant for a\nsmile, upon her illustrious visitor, who, still keeping his hold upon\nher hand, started off walking at a rapid pace, the crowd following in\nthe rear. He directed his steps towards the residence of Alvez, and\nfinding the door closed, applied his strong shoulder to it with such\neffect, that it fell bodily to the ground, and the passive sovereign\nstood within the limits of the enclosure. The trader was about to\nsummon his slaves and soldiers to repel the unceremonious invasion of\nhis premises, but on beholding the queen all stepped back with\nrespectful reverence.\n\nBefore Alvez had time to ask the sovereign to what cause he was\nindebted for the honour of her visit, the magician had cleared a wide\nspace around him, and had once again commenced his performances.\nBrandishing his arms wildly he pointed to the clouds as though he were\narresting them in their course; he inflated his huge cheeks and blew\nwith all his strength, as if resolved to disperse the heavy masses, and\nthen stretching himself to his full height, he appeared to clutch them\nin his giant grasp.\n\nDeeply impressed, the superstitious Moena was half beside herself with\nexcitement; she uttered loud cries and involuntarily began herself to\nimitate every one of the _mganga's_ gestures. The entire crowd joined\nin, and very soon the low guttural note of the sorcerer was lost,\ntotally drowned in the turmoil of howls, shrieks, and discordant songs.\n\nTo the chagrin, however, both of the queen and her subjects, there was\nnot the slightest intimation that the clouds above were going to permit\na rift by which the rays of the tropical sun could find a passage. On\nthe contrary, the tokens of improvement in the weather, which had been\nobserved in the early morning, had all disappeared, the atmosphere was\ndarker than ever, and heavy storm-drops began to patter down.\n\nA reaction was beginning to take place in the enthusiasm of the crowd.\nAfter all, then, it would seem that this famous _mganga_ from whom so\nmuch had been expected, had no power above the rest. Disappointment\nevery moment grew more keen, and soon there was a positive display of\nirritation. The natives pressed around him with closed fists and\nthreatening gestures. A frown gathered on Moena's face, and her lips\nopened with muttered words clear enough to make the magician understand\nthat his ears were in jeopardy. His position was evidently becoming\ncritical.\n\nAn unexpected incident suddenly altered the aspect of affairs.\n\nThe _mganga_ was quite tall enough to see over the heads of the crowd,\nand all at once pausing in the midst of his incantations, he pointed to\na distant corner of the enclosure. All eyes were instantly turned in\nthat direction. Mrs. Weldon and Jack had just come out of their hut,\nand catching sight of them, the _mganga_ stood with his left hand\npointing towards them and his right upstretched towards the heavens.\n\nIntuitively the multitude comprehended his meaning. Here was the\nexplanation of the mystery. It was this white woman with her child that\nhad been the cause of all their misery, it was owing to them that the\nclouds had poured down this desolating rain. With yells of execration\nthe whole mob made a dash towards the unfortunate lady who, pale with\nfright and rigid as a statue, stood clasping her boy to her side. The\n_mganga_, however, anticipated them. Having pushed his way through the\ninfuriated throng, he seized the child and held him high in the air, as\nthough about to hurl him to the ground, a peace-offering to the\noffended gods.\n\n[Illustration: \"Here they are, captain! both of them!!\"]\n\nMrs. Weldon gave a piercing shriek, and fell senseless to the earth.\n\nLifting her up, and making a sign to the queen that all would now be\nright, the _mganga_ retreated carrying both mother and child through\nthe crowd, who retreated before him and made an open passage.\n\nAlvez now felt that it was time to interfere. Already one of his\nprisoners had eluded his vigilance, and was he now to see two more\ncarried off before his eyes? was he to lose the whole of the expected\nransom? no, rather would he see Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 destroyed by a deluge, than\nresign his chance of securing so good a prize. Darting forwards he\nattempted to obstruct the magician's progress; but public opinion was\nagainst him; at a sign from the queen, he was seized by the guards, and\nhe was aware well enough of what would be the immediate consequence of\nresistance. He deemed it prudent to desist from his obstruction, but in\nhis heart he bitterly cursed the stupid credulity of the natives for\nsupposing that the blood of the white woman or the child could avail to\nput an end to the disasters they were suffering.\n\nMaking the natives understand that they were not to follow him, the\nmagician carried off his burden as easily as a lion would carry a\ncouple of kids. The lady was still unconscious, and Jack was all but\nparalyzed with fright. Once free of the enclosure the _mganga_ crossed\nthe town, entered the forest, and after a march of three miles, during\nwhich he did not slacken his pace for a moment, reached the bank of a\nriver which was flowing towards the north.\n\nHere in the cavity of a rock, concealed by drooping foliage, a canoe\nwas moored, covered with a kind of thatched roof; on this the magician\ndeposited his burden, and sending the light craft into mid-stream with\na vigorous kick, exclaimed in a cheery voice,--\n\n\"Here they are, captain! both of them! Mrs. Weldon and Master Jack,\nboth! We will be off now! I hope those idiots of Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9 will have\nplenty more rain yet! Off we go!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nDRIFTING DOWN THE STREAM.\n\n\n\"Off we go!\" It was the voice of Hercules addressing Dick Sands, who,\nfrightfully debilitated by recent sufferings, was leaning against\nCousin Benedict for support. Dingo was lying at his feet.\n\nMrs. Weldon gradually recovered her consciousness. Looking around her\nin amazement she caught sight of Dick.\n\n\"Dick, is it you?\" she muttered feebly.\n\nThe lad with some difficulty arose, and took her hand in his, while\nJack overwhelmed him with kisses.\n\n\"And who would have thought it was you, Hercules, that carried us\naway?\" said the child; \"I did not know you a bit; you were so\ndreadfully ugly.\"\n\n\"I was a sort of a devil, you know, Master Jack,\" Hercules answered;\n\"and the devil is not particularly handsome;\" and he began rubbing his\nchest vigorously to get rid of the white pattern with which he had\nadorned it.\n\nMrs. Weldon held out her hand to him with a grateful smile.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Weldon, he has saved you, and although he does not own it,\nhe has saved me too,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Saved!\" repeated Hercules, \"you must not talk about safety, for you\nare not saved yet.\"\n\nAnd pointing to Benedict, he continued,--\n\n\"That's where your thanks are due; unless he had come and informed me\nall about you and where you were, I should have known nothing, and\nshould have been powerless to aid you.\"\n\nIt was now five days since he had fallen in with the entomologist as he\nwas chasing the manticora, and unceremoniously had carried him off.\n\nAs the canoe drifted rapidly along the stream, Hercules briefly related\nhis adventures since his escape from the encampment on the Coanza. He\ndescribed how he had followed the kitanda which was conveying Mrs.\nWeldon; how in the course of his march he had found Dingo badly\nwounded; how he and the dog together had reached the neighbourhood of\nKazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, and how he had contrived to send a note to Dick, intending to\ninform him of Mrs. Weldon's destination. Then he went on to say that\nsince his unexpected _rencontre_ with Cousin Benedict he had watched\nvery closely for a chance to get into the guardedd\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t, but until now\nhad entirely failed. A celebrated _mganga_ had been passing on his way\nthrough the forest, and he had resolved upon impersonating him as a\nmeans of gaining the admittance he wanted. His strength made the\nundertaking sufficiently easy; and having stripped the magician of his\nparaphernalia, and bound him securely to a tree, he painted his own\nbody with a pattern like that which he observed on his victim's chest,\nand having attired himself with the magical garments was quite equipped\nto impose upon the credulous natives. The result of his stratagem they\nhad all that day witnessed.\n\nHe had hardly finished his account of himself when Mrs. Weldon, smiling\nat his success, turned to Dick.\n\n\"And how, all this time, my dear boy, has it fared with you?\" she asked.\n\nDick said,--\n\n\"I remember very little to tell you. I recollect being fastened to a\nstake in the river-bed and the water rising and rising till it was\nabove my head. My last thoughts were about yourself and Jack. Then\neverything became a blank, and I knew nothing more until I found myself\namongst the papyrus on the river-bank, with Hercules tending me like a\nnurse.\"\n\n\"You see I am the right sort of _mganga_\" interposed Hercules; \"I am a\ndoctor as well as a conjurer.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Hercules, how did you save him?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was not a difficult matter by any means,\" answered Hercules\nmodestly; \"it was dark, you know, so that at the proper moment it was\nquite possible to wade in amongst the poor wretches at the bottom of\nthe trench, and to wrench the stake from its socket. Anybody could have\ndone it. Cousin Benedict could have done it. Dingo, too, might have\ndone it. Perhaps, after all, it was Dingo that did it.\"\n\n\"No, no, Hercules, that won't do,\" cried Jack; \"besides, look, Dingo is\nshaking his head; he is telling you he didn't do it.\"\n\n\"Dingo must not tell tales, Master Jack,\" said Hercules, laughing.\n\nBut, nevertheless, although the brave fellow's modesty prompted him to\nconceal it, it was clear that he had accomplished a daring feat, of\nwhich few would have ventured to incur the risk.\n\nInquiry was next made after Tom, Bat, Act\u00c3\u00a6on, and Austin. His\ncountenance fell, and large tears gathered in his eyes as Hercules told\nhow he had seen them pass through the forest in a slave-caravan. They\nwere gone; he feared they were gone for ever.\n\nMrs. Weldon tried to console him with the hope that they might still be\nspared to meet again some day; but he shook his head mournfully. She\nthen communicated to Dick the terms of the compact that had been\nentered into for her own release, and observed that under the\ncircumstances it might really have been more prudent for her to remain\nin Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Then I have made a mistake; I have been an idiot, in bringing you\naway,\" said Hercules, ever ready to depreciate his own actions.\n\n\"No,\" said Dick; \"you have made no mistake; you could not have done\nbetter; those rascals, ten chances to one, will only get Mr. Weldon\ninto some trap. We must get to Mossamedes before Negoro arrives; once\nthere, we shall find that the Portuguese authorities will lend us their\nprotection, and when old Alvez arrives to claim his 100,000 dollars--\"\n\n\"He shall receive a good thrashing for his pains,\" said Hercules,\nfinishing Dick's sentence, and chuckling heartily at the prospect.\n\nIt was agreed on all hands that it was most important that Negoro's\narrival at Mossamedes should be forestalled. The plan which Dick had so\nlong contemplated of reaching the coast by descending some river seemed\nnow in a fair way of being accomplished, and from the northerly\ndirection in which they were proceeding it was quite probable that they\nwould ultimately reach the Zaire, and in that case not actually arrive\nat S. Paul de Loanda; but that would be immaterial, as they would be\nsure of finding help anywhere in the colonies of Lower Guinea.\n\nOn finding himself on the river-bank, Dick's first thought had been to\nembark upon one of the floating islands that are continually to be seen\nupon the surface of the African streams, but it happened that Hercules\nduring one of his rambles found a native boat that had run adrift. It\nwas just the discovery that suited their need. It was one of the long,\nnarrow canoes, thirty feet in length by three or four in breadth, that\nwith a large number of paddles can be driven with immense velocity, but\nby the aid of a single scull can be safely guided down the current of a\nstream.\n\nDick was somewhat afraid that, to elude observation, it would be\nnecessary to proceed only by night, but as the loss of twelve hours out\nof the twenty-four would double the length of the voyage, he devised\nthe plan of covering the canoe with a roof of long grass, supported by\na horizontal pole from stem to stern, and this not only afforded a\nshelter from the sun, but so effectually concealed the craft,\nrudder-scull and all, that the very birds mistook it for one of the\nnatural islets, and red-beaked gulls, black _arringhas_ and grey and\nwhite kingfishers would frequently alight upon it in search of food.\n\nThough comparatively free from fatigue, the voyage must necessarily be\nlong, and by no means free from danger, and the daily supply of\nprovisions was not easy to procure. If fishing failed, Dick had the one\ngun which Hercules had carried away with him from the ant-hill, and as\nhe was by no means a bad shot, he hoped to find plenty of game, either\nalong the banks or by firing through a loophole in the thatch.\n\nThe rate of the current, as far as he could tell, was about two miles\nan hour, enough to carry them about fifty miles a day; it was a speed,\nhowever, that made it necessary for them to keep a sharp look-out for\nany rocks or submerged trunks of trees, as well as to be on their guard\nagainst rapids and cataracts.\n\nDick's strength and spirits all revived at the delight of having Mrs.\nWeldon and Jack restored to him, and he assumed his post at the bow of\nthe canoe, directing Hercules how to use the scull at the stern. A\nlitter of soft grass was made for Mrs. Weldon, who spent most of her\ntime lying thoughtfully in the shade. Cousin Benedict was very\ntaciturn; he had not recovered the loss of the manticora, and frowned\never and again at Hercules, as if he had not yet forgiven him for\nstopping him in the chase. Jack, who had been told that he must not be\nnoisy, amused himself by playing with Dingo.\n\nThe first two days passed without any special incident. The stock of\nprovisions was quite enough for that time, so that there was no need to\ndisembark, and Dick merely lay to for a few hours in the night to take\na little necessary repose.\n\nThe stream nowhere exceeded 150 feet in breadth. The floating islands\nmoved at the same pace as the canoe, and except from some unforeseen\ncircumstance, there could be no apprehension of a collision. The banks\nwere destitute of human inhabitants, but were richly clothed with wild\nplants, of which the blossoms were of the most gorgeous colours; the\nasclepiae, the gladiolus, the clematis, lilies, aloes, umbelliferae,\narborescent ferns and fragrant shrubs, combining on either hand to make\na border of surpassing beauty. Here and there the forest extended to\nthe very shore, and copal-trees, acacias with their stiff foliage,\nbauhinias clothed with lichen, fig-trees with their masses of pendant\nroots, and other trees of splendid growth rose to the height of a\nhundred feet, forming a shade which the rays of the sun utterly failed\nto penetrate.\n\n[Illustration: Hercules could leave the boat without much fear of\ndetection.]\n\nOccasionally a wreath of creepers would form an arch from shore to\nshore, and on the 27th, to Jack's great delight, a group of monkeys was\nseen crossing one of these natural bridges, holding on most carefully\nby their tails, lest the aerial pathway should snap beneath their\nweight. These monkeys, belonging to a smaller kind of chimpanzee, which\nare known in Central Africa by the name of _sokos_, were hideous\ncreatures with low foreheads, bright yellow faces, and long, upright\nears; they herd in troops of about ten, bark like dogs, and are much\ndreaded by the natives on account of their alleged propensity to carry\noff young children; there is no telling what predatory designs they\nmight have formed against Master Jack if they had spied him out, but\nDick's artifice effectually screened him from their observation.\n\nTwenty miles further on the canoe came to a sudden standstill.\n\n\"What's the matter now, captain?\" cried Hercules from the stern.\n\n\"We have drifted on to a grass barrier, and there is no hope for it, we\nshall have to cut our way through,\" answered Dick.\n\n\"All right, I dare say we shall manage it,\" promptly replied Hercules,\nleaving his rudder to come in front.\n\nThe obstruction was formed by the interlacing of masses of the tough,\nglossy grass known by the name of _tikatika_, which, when compressed,\naffords a surface so compact and resisting that travellers have been\nknown by means of it to cross rivers dry-footed. Splendid specimens of\nlotus plants had taken root amongst the vegetation.\n\nAs it was nearly dark, Hercules could leave the boat without much fear\nof detection, and so effectually did he wield his hatchet that, in two\nhours after the stoppage, the barrier was hewn asunder, and the light\ncraft resumed the channel.\n\nIt must be owned that it was with a sense of reluctance that Benedict\nfelt the boat was again beginning to move forward; the whole voyage\nappeared to him to be perfectly uninteresting and unnecessary; not a\nsingle insect had he observed since he left Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9, and his most\nardent wish was that he could return there and regain possession of his\ninvaluable tin box. But an unlooked for gratification was in store for\nhim.\n\nHercules, who had been his pupil long enough to have an eye for the\nkind of creature Benedict was ever trying to secure, on coming back\nfrom his exertions on the grass-barrier, brought a horrible-looking\nanimal, and submitted it to the sullen entomologist.\n\n\"Is this of any use to you?\"\n\nThe amateur lifted it up carefully, and having almost poked it into his\nnear-sighted eyes, uttered a cry of delight,--\n\n\"Bravo, Hercules! you are making amends for your past mischief; it is\nsplendid! it is unique!\"\n\n\"Is it really very curious?\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the enraptured naturalist; \"it is really\nunique; it belongs to neither of the ten orders; it can be classed\nneither with the coleoptera, neuroptera, nor to the hymenoptera: if it\nhad eight legs I should know how to classify it; I should place it\namongst the second section of the arachnida; but it is a hexapod, a\ngenuine hexapod; a spider with six legs; a grand discovery; it must be\nentered on the catalogue as 'Hexapodes Benedictus.'\" Once again\nmounted on his hobby, the worthy enthusiast continued to discourse with\nan unwonted vivacity to his indulgent ii* not over attentive audience.\n\nMeanwhile the canoe was steadily threading its way over the dark\nwaters, the silence of the night broken only by the rattle of the\nscales of some crocodiles, or by the snorting of hippopotamuses in the\nneighbourhood. Once the travellers were startled by a loud noise, such\nas might proceed from some ponderous machinery in motion: it was caused\nby a troop of a hundred or more elephants that, after feasting through\nthe day on the roots of the forest, had come to quench their thirst at\nthe river-side.\n\n[Illustration: It was caused by a troop of a hundred or more elephants.]\n\nBut no danger was to be apprehended; lighted by the pale moon that rose\nover the tall trees, the canoe throughout the night pursued in safety\nits solitary voyage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nAN ANXIOUS VOYAGE.\n\n\nThus the canoe drifted on for a week, the forests that for many miles\nhad skirted the river ultimately giving place to extensive jungles that\nstretched far away to the horizon. Destitute, fortunately for the\ntravellers, of human inhabitants, the district abounded in a large\nvariety of animal life; zebras, elands, caamas, sported on the bank,\ndisappearing at night-fall before howling leopards and roaring lions.\n\nIt was Dick's general custom, as he lay to for a while in the\nafternoon, to go ashore in search of food, and as the manioc, maize,\nand sorghum that were to be found were of a wild growth and\nconsequently not fit for consumption, he was obliged to run the risk of\nusing his gun. On the 4th of July he succeeded by a single shot in\nkilling _pokoo_, a kind of antelope about five feet long, with\nannulated horns, a tawny skin dappled with bright spots, and a white\nbelly. The venison proved excellent, and was roasted over a fire\nprocured by the primitive method, practised, it is said, even by\ngorillas, of rubbing two sticks together.\n\nIn spite of these halts, and the time taken for the night's rest, the\ndistance accomplished by the 8th could not be estimated at less than a\nhundred miles. The river, augmented by only a few insignificant\ntributaries, had not materially increased in volume; its direction,\nhowever, had slightly changed more to the north-west. It afforded a\nvery fair supply of fish, which were caught by lines made of the long\nstems of creepers furnished with thorns instead of fish-hooks, a\nconsiderable proportion being the delicate _sandjtkas_, which when\ndried may be transported to any climate; besides these there were the\nblack _usakas_, the wide-headed _monnd\u00c3\u00a9s_, and occasionally the little\n_dagalas_, resembling Thames whitebait.\n\n[Illustration: He stood face to face with his foe.]\n\nNext day, Dick met with an adventure that put all his courage and\ncomposure to the test. He had noticed the horns of a caama projecting\nabove the brushwood, and went ashore alone with the intention of\nsecuring it. He succeeded in getting tolerably close to it and fired,\nbut he was terribly startled when a formidable creature bounded along\nsome thirty paces ahead, and took possession of the prey he had just\nwounded.\n\nIt was a majestic lion, at least five feet in height, of the kind\ncalled _k\u00c3\u00a1ramoo_, in distinction to the maneless species known as the\n_Nyassi-lion_. Before Dick had time to reload, the huge brute had\ncaught sight of him, and without relaxing its hold upon the writhing\nantelope beneath its claws, glared upon him fiercely. Dick's presence\nof mind did not forsake him; flight he knew was not to be thought of;\nhis only chance he felt intuitively would be by keeping perfectly\nstill; and aware that the beast would be unlikely to give up a\nstruggling prey for another that was motionless, he stood face to face\nwith his foe, not venturing to move an eyelid. In a few minutes the\nlion's patience seemed to be exhausted; with a grand stateliness, it\npicked up the caama as easily as a dog would lift a hare, turned round,\nand lashing the bushes with its tail, disappeared in the jungle.\n\nIt took Dick some little time to recover himself sufficiently to return\nto the canoe. On arriving, he said nothing of the peril to which he had\nbeen exposed, but heartily congratulated himself that they had means of\ntransport without making their way through jungles and forests.\n\nAs they advanced, they repeatedly came across evidences that the\ncountry had not been always, as now it was, utterly devoid of\npopulation; more than once, they observed traces which betokened the\nformer existence of villages; either some ruined palisades or the\n_d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ of some thatched huts, or some solitary sacred tree within an\nenclosure would indicate that the death of a chief had, according to\ncustom, made a native tribe migrate to new quarters.\n\nIf natives were still dwelling in the district, as was just probable,\nthey must have been living underground, only emerging at night like\nbeasts of prey, from which they were only a grade removed.\n\nDick Sands had every reason to feel convinced that cannibalism had been\npractised in the neighbourhood, Three times, as he was wandering in the\nforest, he had come upon piles of ashes and half-charred human bones,\nthe remnants, no doubt, of a ghastly meal, and although he mentioned\nnothing of what he had seen to Mrs. Weldon, he made up his mind to go\nashore as seldom as possible, and as often as he found it absolutely\nnecessary to go, he gave Hercules strict directions to push off into\nmid-stream at the very first intimation of danger.\n\nA new cause of anxiety arose on the following evening, and made it\nnecessary for them to take the most guarded measures of precaution. The\nriver-bed had widened out into a kind of lagoon, and on the right side\nof this, built upon piles in the water, not only was there a collection\nof about thirty huts, but the fires gleaming under the thatch, made it\nevident that they were all inhabited. Unfortunately the only channel of\nthe stream flowed close under the huts, the river elsewhere being so\nobstructed with rocks that navigation of any kind was impossible.\nNothing was more probable than that the natives would have set their\nnets all across the piles, and if so, the canoe would be sure to be\nobstructed, and an alarm must inevitably be raised. Every caution\nseemed to be unavailing, because the canoe must follow the stream;\nhowever, in the lowest of whispers Dick ordered Hercules to keep clear\nas much as he could of the worm-eaten timber. The night was not very\ndark, which was equally an advantage and a disadvantage, as while it\npermitted those on board to steer as they wanted, it did not prevent\nthem from being seen.\n\nThe situation became more and more critical. About a hundred feet\nahead, the channel was very contracted; two natives, gesticulating\nviolently, were seen squatting on the pilework; a few moments more and\ntheir voices could be heard; it was obvious that they had seen the\nfloating mass; apprehending that it was going to destroy their nets,\nthey yelled aloud and shouted for assistance; instantly five or six\nnegroes scrambled down the piles, and perched themselves upon the\ncross-beams.\n\nOn board the canoe the profoundest silence was maintained. Dick only\nsignalled his directions to Hercules, without uttering a word, while\nJack performed his part by holding Dingo's mouth tightly closed, to\nstop the low growlings which the faithful watch-dog seemed resolved to\nmake; but fortunately every sound was overpowered by the rushing of the\nstream and the clamour of the negroes, as they hurriedly drew in their\nnets. If they should raise them in time, all might be well, but if, on\nthe other hand, the canoe should get entangled, the consequences could\nhardly fail to be disastrous. The current in its narrow channel was so\nstrong that Dick was powerless either to modify his course or to\nslacken it.\n\nHalf a minute more, and the canoe was right under the woodwork, but the\nefforts of the natives had already elevated the nets so that the\nanticipated danger was happily escaped; but it chanced that in making\nits way through the obstacle, a large piece of the grass-thatch got\ndetached. One of the negroes raised a sudden shout of alarm, and it\nseemed only too probable that he had caught a sight of the travellers\nbelow and was informing his companions. This apprehension, too, was\nonly momentary; the current had changed almost to a rapid, and carried\nthe canoe along with such velocity that the lacustrine village was\nquickly out of sight.\n\n\"Steer to the left!\" cried Dick, finding that the riverbed had again\nbecome clear.\n\nA stiff pull at the tiller made the craft fly in that direction.\n\nDick went to the stern, and scanned the moonlit waters. All was\nperfectly still, no canoe was in pursuit; perhaps the natives had not\none to use; but certain it was that when daylight dawned no vestige of\nan inhabitant was to be seen. Nevertheless Dick thought it prudent for\na while to steer close under the shelter of the left-hand shore.\n\n[Illustration: Instantly five or six negroes scrambled down the piles.]\n\nBy the end of the next four days the aspect of the country had\nundergone a remarkable change, the jungle having given place to a\ndesert as dreary as the Kalahari itself. The river appeared\ninterminable, and it became a matter of serious consideration how to\nget a sufficiency of food. Fish was scarce, or at least hard to catch,\nand the arid soil provided no means of sustenance for antelopes, so\nthat nothing was to be gained from the chase. Carnivorous animals also\nhad quite disappeared, and the silence of the night was broken, not by\nthe roar of wild beasts, but by the croaking of frogs in a discordant\nchorus, which Cameron has compared to the clanking of hammers and the\ngrating of files in a ship-builder's yard.\n\nFar away both to the east and west the outlines of hills could be\nfaintly discerned, but the shores on either hand were perfectly flat\nand devoid of trees. Euphorbias, it is true, grew in considerable\nnumbers, but as they were only of the oil-producing species, and not\nthe kind from which cassava or manioc is procured, they were useless in\nan alimentary point of view.\n\nDick was becoming more and more perplexed, when Hercules happened to\nmention that the natives often eat young fern-fronds and the pith of\nthe papyrus, and that before now he had himself been reduced to the\nnecessity of subsisting on nothing better.\n\n\"We must try them,\" said Dick.\n\nBoth ferns and papyrus abounded on the banks, and a meal was prepared,\nthe sweet soft pith of the papyrus being found very palatable. Jack in\nparticular appeared to enjoy it extremely, but it was not in any way a\nsatisfying diet.\n\nThanks to Cousin Benedict, a fresh variety in the matter of food was\nfound on the following day. Since the discovery of the \"Hexapodes\nBenedictus\" he had recovered his spirits, and, having fastened his\nprize safely inside his hat, he wandered about, as often as he had a\nchance, in his favourite pursuit of insect-hunting. As he was rummaging\nin the long grass, he put up a bird which flew but a very short\ndistance. Benedict recognized it by its peculiar note, and, seeing Dick\ntake his gun to aim at it, exclaimed,--\n\n\"Don't fire, don't fire! that bird will be worth nothing for food among\nfive of us.\"\n\n\"It will be dinner enough for Jack,\" said Dick, who, finding that the\nbird did not seem in a hurry to make its escape, delayed his shot for a\nmoment, without intending to be diverted from his purpose of securing\nit.\n\n\"You mustn't fire,\" insisted Benedict, \"it is an indicator; it will\nshow you where there are lots of honey.\"\n\nAware that a few pounds of honey would really be of more value than a\nlittle bird, Dick lowered his gun, and in company with the entomologist\nset off to follow the indicator, which seemed, by alternately flying\nand stopping, to be inviting them to come on, and they had but a little\nway to go before they observed several swarms of bees buzzing around\nsome old stems hidden amongst the euphorbias. Notwithstanding\nBenedict's remonstrances against depriving the bees of the fruits of\ntheir industry, Dick instantly set to work, and without remorse\nsuffocated them by burning dry grass underneath. Having secured a good\namount of honey, he left the comb to the indicator as its share of the\nbooty, and went back with his companion to the canoe.\n\nThe honey was acceptable, but it did not do much to alleviate the\ncravings of hunger.\n\nNext day it happened that they had just stopped for their accustomed\nrest, when they observed that an enormous swarm of grasshoppers had\nsettled at the mouth of a creek close by. Two or three deep they\ncovered the soil, myriads and myriads of them adhering to every shrub.\n\n\"The natives eat those grasshoppers,\" said Benedict, \"and like them\ntoo.\"\n\nThe remark produced an instant effect; all hands were busied in\ncollecting them, and a large supply was quickly gathered: the canoe\nmight have been filled ten times over.\n\nGrilled over a slow fire, they were found to be very palatable eating,\nand, spite of his qualms of conscience, Benedict himself made a hearty\nmeal.\n\nBut although the gnawings of absolute hunger were thus assuaged, all\nthe travellers began to long most anxiously for the voyage to come to\nan end. The mode of transit indeed might be less exhausting to the\nbodily powers than a land march would have been, but the excessive heat\nby day, the damp mists at night, and the incessant attacks of\nmosquitoes, all combined to render the passage extremely trying. There\nwas no telling how long it would last, and Dick was equally uncertain\nwhether it might end in a few days, or be protracted for a month. The\ndirection which the stream was taking was itself a subject of\nperplexity.\n\nA fresh surprise was now in store.\n\nAs Jack, a few mornings afterwards, was standing at the bow peering\nthrough an aperture in the grass canopy above him, he suddenly turned\nround and cried,--\n\n\"The sea! the sea!\"\n\nDick started forwards, and looked eagerly in the same direction.\n\nA large expanse of water was visible in the horizon, but after having\nsurveyed it for a moment or two, he said,--\n\n\"No, Jack, it is not the sea, it is a great river; it is running west,\nand I suppose this river runs into it. Perhaps it is the Zaire.\"\n\n\"Let us hope it is,\" said Mrs. Weldon earnestly.\n\nMost cordially did Dick Sands re-echo her words, being well aware that\nat the mouth of that river were Portuguese villages, where a refuge\nmight assuredly be found.\n\nFor several succeeding days the canoe, still concealed by its covering,\nfloated on the silvery surface of this new-found stream. On either side\nthe banks became less arid, and there seemed everything to encourage\nthe few survivors of the \"Pilgrim\" to believe that they would soon see\nthe last of the perils and toils of their journey.\n\nThey were too sanguine. Towards three o'clock on the morning of the\n18th, Dick, who was at his usual post at the bow, fancied he heard a\ndull rumbling towards the west. Mrs. Weldon, Jack, and Benedict were\nall asleep. Calling Hercules to him, he asked him whether he could not\nhear a strange noise. The night was perfectly calm, and not a breath of\nair was stirring. The negro listened attentively, and suddenly, his\neyes sparkling with delight, exclaimed,--\n\n\"Yes, captain, I hear the sea!\"\n\nDick shook his head and answered,--\n\n\"It is not the sea, Hercules.\"\n\n\"Not the sea!\" cried the negro, \"then what can it be?\"\n\n\"We must wait till daybreak,\" replied Dick, \"and meanwhile we shall\nhave to keep a sharp look-out.\"\n\nHercules returned to his place, but only to continue listening with\never-increasing curiosity. The rumbling perceptibly increased till it\nbecame a continued roar.\n\nWith scarcely any intervening twilight night passed into day. Just in\nfront, scarcely more than half a mile ahead, a great mist was hanging\nover the river; it was not an ordinary fog, and when the sun rose, the\nlight of the dawn caused a brilliant rainbow to arch itself from shore\nto shore.\n\nIn a voice so loud that it awoke Mrs. Weldon, Dick gave his order to\nHercules to steer for the bank:--\n\n\"Quick, quick, Hercules! ashore! ashore! there are cataracts close\nahead!\"\n\nAnd so it was. Within little more than a quarter of a mile the bed of\nthe river sank abruptly some hundred feet, and the foaming waters\nrushed down in a magnificent fall with irresistible velocity. A few\nminutes more and the canoe must have been swallowed in the deep abyss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nAN ATTACK.\n\n\nThe canoe inclined to the west readily enough; the fall in the\nriver-bed was so sudden that the current remained quite unaffected by\nthe cataract at a distance of three hundred yards.\n\nOn the bank were woods so dense that sunlight could not penetrate the\nshade. Dick was conscious of a sad misgiving when he looked at the\ncharacter of the territory through which they must necessarily pass. It\ndid not seem practicable by any means to convey the canoe below the\nfalls.\n\nAs they neared the shore, Dingo became intensely agitated. At first\nDick suspected that a wild beast or a native might be lurking in the\npapyrus, but it soon became obvious that the dog was excited by grief\nrather than by rage.\n\n\"Dingo is crying,\" said Jack; \"poor Dingo!\" and the child laid his arms\nover the creature's neck.\n\nThe dog, however, was too impatient to be caressed; bounding away, he\nsprang into the water, swam across the twenty feet that intervened\nbetween the shore, and disappeared in the grass.\n\nIn a few moments the boat had glided on to a carpet of confervas and\nother aquatic plants, starting a few kingfishers and some snow-white\nherons. Hercules moored it to the stump of a tree, and the travellers\nwent ashore.\n\nThere was no pathway through the forest, only the trampled moss showed\nthat the place had been recently visited either by animals or men.\n\n[Illustration: Upon the smooth wood were two great letters in dingy\nred.]\n\nDick took his gun and Hercules his hatchet, and they set out to search\nfor Dingo. They had not far to go before they saw him with his nose\nclose to the ground, manifestly following a scent; the animal raised\nhis head for a moment, as if beckoning them to follow, and kept on till\nhe reached an old sycamore-stump. Having called out to the rest of the\nparty to join them, Dick made his way farther into the wood till he got\nup to Dingo, who was whining piteously at the entrance of a dilapidated\nhut.\n\nThe rest were not long in following, and they all entered the hut\ntogether. The floor was strewn with bones whitened by exposure.\n\n\"Some one has died here,\" said Mrs. Weldon.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" added Dick, as if struck by a sudden thought, \"it was\nDingo's old master. Look at him! he is pointing with his paw.\"\n\nThe portion of the sycamore-trunk which formed the farther side of the\nhut had been stripped of its bark, and upon the smooth wood were two\ngreat letters in dingy red almost effaced by time, but yet plain enough\nto be distinguished.\n\n\"S. V.,\" cried Dick, as he looked where the dog's paw rested; \"the same\ninitials that Dingo has upon his collar. There can be no mistake. S. V.\"\n\nA small copper box, green with verdigris, caught his eye, and he picked\nit up. It was open, but contained a scrap of discoloured paper. The\nwriting upon this consisted of a few sentences, of which only detached\nwords could be made out, but they revealed the sad truth only too\nplainly.\n\n\"Robbed by Negoro--murdered--Dingo--help--Negoro guide--120 miles from\ncoast--December 3rd, 1871--write no more.\n\n\"S. VERNON.\"\n\nHere was the clue to a melancholy story. Samuel Vernon, under the\nguidance of Negoro, and taking with him his dog Dingo, had set out on\nan exploration of a district of Central Africa; he had taken a\nconsiderable quantity of money to procure the necessary supplies on the\nway, and this had excited the cupidity of his guide, who seized the\nopportunity, whilst they were encamping on the banks of the Congo, to\nassassinate his employer, and get possession of his property. Negoro,\nhowever, had not escaped; he had fallen into the hands of the\nPortuguese, by whom he was recognized as an agent of the slave-dealer\nAlvez, and condemned to spend the rest of his days in prison. He\ncontrived after a while to make his escape, and, as has been already\nmentioned, found his way to New Zealand, whence he had returned by\nsecuring an engagement on board the \"Pilgrim.\" Between the time when he\nwas attacked by Negoro and the moment of his death, Vernon had managed\nto write the few brief lines of which the fragments still survived, and\nto deposit the document in the box from which the money had been\nstolen, and by a last effort had traced out his initials in blood upon\nthe naked wood which formed the wall of the hut. For many days Dingo\nwatched beside his master, and throughout that time his eyes were\nresting so perpetually upon the two crimson letters in front of him,\nthat mere instinct seemed to fasten them indelibly on his memory.\nQuitting his watch one day, perhaps to pacify his hunger, the dog\nwandered to the coast, where he was picked up by the captain of the\n\"Waldeck,\" afterwards to be transferred to the very ship on which his\nowner's murderer had been engaged as cook.\n\nAll throughout this time poor Vernon's bones had been bleaching in the\nAfrican forest, and the first resolution of Dick and Mrs. Weldon was to\ngive the residue of his remains some semblance of a decent burial. They\nwere just proceeding to their task when Dingo gave a furious growl, and\ndashed out of the hut; another moment, and a terrible shriek made it\nevident that he was in conflict with some dread antagonist.\n\nHercules was quickly in pursuit, and the whole party followed in time\nto witness the giant hurl himself upon a man with whom already Dingo\nwas in mortal combat.\n\n[Illustration: The dog was griping the man by the throat]\n\nThe dog was griping the man by the throat, the man was lifting his\ncutlass high above the head of the dog.\n\nThat man was Negoro. The rascal, on getting his letter at Kazonnd\u00c3\u00a9,\ninstead of embarking at once for America, had left his native escort\nfor a while, and returned to the scene of his crime to secure the\ntreasure which he had left buried at a little distance in a spot that\nhe had marked. At this very moment he was in the act of digging up the\ngold he had concealed; some glistening coins scattered here and there\nbetrayed his purpose; but in the midst of his labours he had been\nstartled by the dashing forward of a dog; another instant, and the dog\nhad fixed itself upon his throat, whilst he, in an agony of\ndesperation, had drawn his cutlass and plunged it deep into the\ncreature's side.\n\nHercules came up at the very climax of the death-struggle.\n\n\"You villain! you accursed villain! I have you now!\" he cried, about to\nseize hold of his victim.\n\nBut vengeance was already accomplished. Negoro gave no sign of life;\ndeath had overtaken him on the very scene of his guilt. Dingo, too, had\nreceived a mortal wound; he dragged himself back to the hut, lay down\nbeside the remains of his master, and expired.\n\nThe sad task of burying Vernon's bones, and laying his faithful dog\nbeside them having been accomplished, the whole party was obliged to\nturn their thoughts to their own safety. Although Negoro was dead, it\nas very likely that the natives that he had taken with him were at no\ngreat distance, and would come to search for him.\n\nA hurried conference was held as to what steps had best be taken. The\nfew words traceable on the paper made them aware that they were on the\nbanks of the Congo, and that they were still 120 miles from the coast.\nThe fall just ahead was probably the cataract of Memo, but whatever it\nwas, no doubt it effectually barred their farther progress by water.\nThere seemed no alternative but that they should make their way by one\nbank or the other a mile or two below the waterfall, and there\nconstruct a raft on which once again they could drift down the stream.\nThe question that pressed for immediate settlement was which bank it\nshould be. Here, on the left bank, would be the greater risk of\nencountering the negro escort of Negoro, while as to the farther shore\nthey could not tell what obstacles it might present.\n\nAltogether Mrs. Weldon advocated trying the other side, but Dick\ninsisted upon crossing first by himself to ascertain whether an advance\nby that route were really practicable.\n\n\"The river is only about 100 yards wide,\" he urged; \"I can soon get\nacross. I shall leave Hercules to look after you all.\"\n\nMrs. Weldon demurred for a while, but Dick seemed resolute, and as he\npromised to take his gun and not to attempt to land if he saw the least\nsymptom of danger, she at last consented, but with so much reluctance\nthat even after he had entered the canoe she said,--\n\n\"I think, Dick, it would be really better for us all to go together.\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Weldon, indeed, no; I am sure it is best for me to go alone;\nI shall be back in an hour.\"\n\n\"If it must be so, it must,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Keep a sharp look-out, Hercules!\" cried the youth cheerily, as he\npushed off from the land.\n\nThe strength of the current was by no means violent, but quite enough\nto make the direction of Dick's course somewhat oblique. The roar of\nthe cataract reverberated in his ears, and the spray, wafted by the\nwesterly wind, brushed lightly past his face, and he shuddered as he\nfelt how near they must have been to destruction if he had relaxed his\nwatch throughout the night.\n\nIt took him hardly a quarter of an hour to reach the opposite bank, and\nhe was just preparing to land when there arose a tremendous shout from\nabout a dozen natives, who, rushing forward, began to tear away the\ncanopy of grass with which the canoe was covered.\n\nDick's horror was great. It would have been greater still if he had\nknown that they were cannibals. They were the natives settled at the\nlacustrine village higher up the river. When the piece of thatch had\nbeen knocked off in passing the piles a glimpse had been caught of the\npassengers below, and aware that the cataract ahead must ultimately\nbring them to a standstill, the eager barbarians had followed them\npersistently day by day for the last eight days.\n\nNow they thought they had secured their prize, but loud was their yell\nof disappointment when on stripping off the thatch they found only one\nperson, and that a mere boy, standing beneath it.\n\nDick stood as calmly as he could at the bow, and pointed his gun\ntowards the savages, who were sufficiently acquainted with the nature\nof fire-arms to make them afraid to attack him.\n\nMrs. Weldon with the others, in their eagerness to watch Dick's\nmovements, had remained standing upon the shore of the river, and at\nthis instant were caught sight of by one of the natives, who pointed\nthem out to his companions. A sudden impulse seized the whole of them,\nand they sprang into the canoe; there seemed to be a practised hand\namongst them, which caught hold of the rudder-oar, and the little craft\nwas quickly on its way back.\n\nAlthough he gave up all as now well-nigh lost, Dick neither moved nor\nspoke. He had one lingering hope yet left. Was it not possible even now\nthat by sacrificing his own life he could save the lives of those that\nwere entrusted to him?\n\nWhen the canoe had come near enough to the shore for his voice to be\nheard, he shouted with all his might,--\n\n\"Fly, Mrs. Weldon; fly, all of you; fly for your lives!\"\n\nBut neither Mrs. Weldon nor Hercules stirred; they seemed rooted to the\nground.\n\n\"Fly, fly, fly!\" he continued shouting.\n\nBut though he knew they must hear him, yet he saw them make no effort\nto escape. He understood their meaning; of what avail was flight when\nthe savages would be upon their track in a few minutes after?\n\nA sudden thought crossed his mind. He raised his gun and fired at the\nman who was steering; the bullet shattered the rudder-scull into\nfragments.\n\nThe cannibals uttered a yell of terror. Deprived of guidance, the canoe\nwas at the mercy of the current, and, borne along with increasing\nspeed, was soon within a hundred feet of the cataract.\n\nThe anxious watchers on the bank instantly discerned Dick's purpose,\nand understood that in order to save them he had formed the resolution\nof precipitating himself with the savages into the seething waters.\n\nNothing could avail to arrest the swift descent. Mrs Weldon in an agony\nof despair waved her hands in a last sad farewell, Jack and Benedict\nseemed paralyzed, whilst Hercules involuntarily extended his great\nstrong arm that was powerless to aid.\n\nSuddenly the natives, impelled by a last frantic effort to reach the\nshore, plunged into the water, but then movement capsized the boat.\n\nFace to face with death, Dick lost nothing of his indomitable presence\nof mind. Might not that light canoe, floating bottom upwards, be made\nthe means for yet another grasp at life? The danger that threatened him\nwas twofold, there was the risk of suffocation as well as the peril of\nbeing drowned; could not the inverted canoe be used for a kind of float\nat once to keep his head above water and to serve as a screen from the\nrushing air? He had some faint recollection of how it had been proved\npossible under some such conditions to descend in safety the falls of\nNiagara.\n\nQuick as lightning he seized hold of the cross-bench of the canoe, and\nwith his head out of water beneath the upturned keel, he was dashed\ndown the furious and well-nigh perpendicular fall.\n\nThe craft sank deep into the abyss, but rose quickly again to the\nsurface. Here was Dick's chance, he was a good swimmer, and his life\ndepended now upon his strength of arm.\n\nIt was a hard struggle, but he succeeded. In a quarter of an hour he\nhad landed on the left hand bank, where he was greeted with the joyful\ncongratulations of his friends, who had hurried to the foot of the fall\nto assure themselves of his fate.\n\n[Illustration: The bullet shattered the rudder scull into fragments]\n\nThe cannibals had all disappeared in the surging waters. Unprotected in\ntheir fall, they had doubtless ceased to breathe before reaching the\nlowest depths of the cataract where their lifeless bodies would soon be\ndashed to pieces against the sharp rocks that were scattered along the\nlower course of the stream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nA HAPPY REUNION.\n\n\nTwo days after Dick's marvellous deliverance the party had the good\nfortune to fall in with a caravan of honest Portuguese ivory-traders on\ntheir way to Emboma, at the mouth of the Congo. They rendered the\nfugitives every assistance, and thus enabled them to reach the coast\nwithout further discomfort.\n\nThis meeting with the caravan was a most fortunate occurrence, as any\nproject of launching a raft upon the Zaire would have been quite\nimpracticable, the river between the Ntemo and Yellala Falls being a\ncontinuous series of cataracts. Stanley counted as many as sixty-two,\nand it was hereabouts that that brave traveller sustained the last of\nthirty-one conflicts with the natives, escaping almost by a miracle\nfrom the Mbelo cataract.\n\nBefore the middle of August the party arrived at Emboma, where they\nwere hospitably received by M. Motta Viega and Mr. Harrison. A steamer\nwas just on the point of starting for the Isthmus of Panama; in this\nthey took their passage, and in due time set foot once more upon\nAmerican soil.\n\nForthwith a message was despatched to Mr. Weldon, apprising him of the\nreturn of the wife and child over whose loss he had mourned so long On\nthe 25th the railroad deposited the travellers at San Francisco, the\nonly thing to mar their happiness being the recollection that Tom and\nhis partners were not with them to share their joy.\n\nMr. Weldon had every reason to congratulate himself that Negoro had\nfailed to reach him. No doubt he would have been ready to sacrifice the\nbulk of his fortune, and without a moment's hesitation would have set\nout for the coast of Africa, but who could question that he would there\nhave been exposed to the vilest treachery? He felt that to Dick Sands\nand to Hercules he owed a debt of gratitude that it would be impossible\nto repay; Dick assumed more than ever the place of an adopted son,\nwhilst the brave negro was regarded as a true and faithful friend.\n\nCousin Benedict, it must be owned, failed to share for long the general\njoy. After giving Mr. Weldon a hasty shake of the hand, he hurried off\nto his private room, and resumed his studies almost as if they had\nnever been interrupted. He set himself vigorously to work with the\ndesign of producing an elaborate treatise upon the \"Hexapodes\nBenedictus\" hitherto unknown to entomological research. Here in his\nprivate chamber spectacles and magnifying-glass were ready for his use,\nand he was now able for the first time with the aid of proper\nappliances to examine the unique production of Central Africa.\n\nA shriek of horror and disappointment escaped his lips. The Hexapodes\nBenedictus was not a hexapod at all. It was a common spider. Hercules,\nin catching it, had unfortunately broken off its two front legs, and\nBenedict, almost blind as he was, had failed to detect the accident.\nHis chagrin was most pitiable, the wonderful discovery that was to have\nexalted his name high in the annals of science belonged simply to the\ncommon order of the arachnid\u00c3\u00a6 The blow to his aspirations was very\nheavy; it brought on a fit of illness from which it took him some time\nto recover.\n\nFor the next three years Dick was entrusted with the education of\nlittle Jack during the intervals he could spare from the prosecution of\nhis own studies, into which he threw himself with an energy quickened\nby a kind of remorse.\n\n\"If only I had known what a seaman ought to know when I was left to\nmyself on board the 'Pilgrim,'\" he would continually say, \"what misery\nand suffering we might have been spared!\"\n\nSo diligently did he apply himself to the technical branches of his\nprofession that at the age of eighteen he received a special\ncertificate of honour, and was at once raised to the rank of a captain\nin Mr. Weldon's firm.\n\nThus by his industry and good conduct did the poor foundling of Sandy\nHook rise to a post of distinction. In spite of his youth, he commanded\nuniversal respect; his native modesty and straightforwardness never\nfailed him, and for his own part, he seemed to be unconscious of those\nfine traits in his character which had impelled him to deeds that made\nhim little short of a hero.\n\nHis leisure moments, however, were often troubled by one source of\nsadness; he could never forget the four negroes for whose misfortunes\nhe held himself by his own inexperience to be in a way responsible.\nMrs. Weldon thoroughly shared his regret, and would have made many\nsacrifices to discover what had become of them. This anxiety was at\nlength relieved.\n\nOwing to the large correspondence of Mr. Weldon in almost every quarter\nof the world, it was discovered that the whole of them had been sold in\none lot, and that they were now in Madagascar. Without listening for a\nmoment to Dick's proposal to apply all his savings to effect their\nliberation, Mr. Weldon set his own agents to negotiate for their\nfreedom, and on the 15th of November, 1877, Tom, Bat, Act\u00c3\u00a6on, and\nAustin awaited their welcome at the merchant's door. It is needless to\nsay how warm were the greetings they received.\n\nOut of all the survivors of the \"Pilgrim\" that had been cast upon the\nfatal coast of Africa, old Nan alone was wanting to complete the\nnumber. Considering what they had all undergone, and the perils to\nwhich they had been exposed, it seemed little short of a miracle that\nshe and poor Dingo should be the only victims.\n\nHigh was the festivity that night in the house of the Californian\nmerchant, and the toast, proposed at Mrs. Weldon's request, that was\nreceived with the loudest acclamation was\n\n\"DICK SANDS, THE BOY CAPTAIN!\"\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Dick Sands the Boy Captain, by Jules Verne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DICK SANDS THE BOY CAPTAIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9150-8.txt or 9150-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/9\/1\/5\/9150\/\n\nProduced by Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1023,"split":"train"}
