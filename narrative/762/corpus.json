{"ori_id":"b346adfa183aaa8aa160f0abd662f3463adbaf56","title":"Phineas Redux","context":"Phineas Redux\n His beloved wife having died in childbirth, Phineas Finn finds Irish society and his job as a Poorhouse Inspector dull and unsatisfying after the excitement of his former career as a Member of Parliament. Back in England, the Whigs are determined to overturn the Tory majority in Parliament. As Finn had been considered the most promising of the younger set, he is encouraged to stand for parliament again.\nReturning to London, he renews his acquaintance with the wealthy widow, Madame Max Goesler. In the past, she had offered to marry him and had been gently turned down; after an awkward first encounter, they renew their friendship.\nIn the political arena, Finn loses the election by a narrow margin, but his luck does not desert him. On appeal, it is found that his opponent had bribed some of the voters, enough to give Finn the victory. He does however make one enemy within his own party. Mr Bonteen makes disparaging remarks about his political trustworthiness (referring to an incident described in Phineas Finn). The conflict spirals out of control when neither man will back down, and they become bitter foes.\nWhen Bonteen is murdered, suspicion falls on two men. One is the Reverend Mr Emilius, husband of Lady Eustace (the main character of The Eustace Diamonds). At her urging, Bonteen had discovered that Emilius had been married when he wed Lady Eustace, thus annulling the marriage and safeguarding her wealth. The other suspect is Phineas Finn. He and Bonteen had been seen to quarrel violently the night of the murder and all the circumstantial evidence points to him, while Emilius did not even have a key to exit his lodgings that night. Finn therefore is brought to trial. Not unexpectedly, the murder of one Member of Parliament allegedly by another quickly becomes the sensation of all England.\nWhile the trial goes on, Madame Max travels to the Continent looking for evidence, and she succeeds. She finds a locksmith who had made a duplicate key for Emilius. This, along with other developments, convinces everyone that Finn is innocent and Emilius guilty. Unfortunately, it is not enough to convict the latter.\nAfterwards, Finn, worn out by the ordeal and disillusioned with politics, refuses an invitation to take office in the government, and marries Madame Max.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Phineas Redux, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

There had been a coming in and a going out\nof Ministers previous to that,--somewhat rapid, very exciting, and,\nupon the whole, useful as showing the real feeling of the country\nupon sundry questions of public interest. Mr. Gresham had been Prime\nMinister of England, as representative of the Liberal party in\npolitics. There had come to be a split among those who should have\nbeen his followers on the terribly vexed question of the Ballot. Then\nMr. Daubeny for twelve months had sat upon the throne distributing\nthe good things of the Crown amidst Conservative birdlings, with\nbeaks wide open and craving maws, who certainly for some years\nprevious had not received their share of State honours or State\nemoluments. And Mr. Daubeny was still so sitting, to the infinite\ndismay of the Liberals, every man of whom felt that his party\nwas entitled by numerical strength to keep the management of the\nGovernment within its own hands.\n\nLet a man be of what side he may in politics,--unless he be\nmuch more of a partisan than a patriot,--he will think it well\nthat there should be some equity of division in the bestowal\nof crumbs of comfort. Can even any old Whig wish that every Lord\nLieutenant of a county should be an old Whig? Can it be good for the\nadministration of the law that none but Liberal lawyers should become\nAttorney-Generals, and from thence Chief Justices or Lords of Appeal?\nShould no Conservative Peer ever represent the majesty of England\nin India, in Canada, or at St. Petersburgh? So arguing, moderate\nLiberals had been glad to give Mr. Daubeny and his merry men a\nchance. Mr. Daubeny and his merry men had not neglected the chance\ngiven them. Fortune favoured them, and they made their hay while the\nsun shone with an energy that had never been surpassed, improving\nupon Fortune, till their natural enemies waxed impatient. There had\nbeen as yet but one year of it, and the natural enemies, who had at\nfirst expressed themselves as glad that the turn had come, might\nhave endured the period of spoliation with more equanimity. For to\nthem, the Liberals, this cutting up of the Whitehall cake by the\nConservatives was spoliation when the privilege of cutting was found\nto have so much exceeded what had been expected. Were not they, the\nLiberals, the real representatives of the people, and, therefore, did\nnot the cake in truth appertain to them? Had not they given up the\ncake for a while, partly, indeed, through idleness and mismanagement,\nand quarrelling among themselves; but mainly with a feeling that\na moderate slicing on the other side would, upon the whole, be\nadvantageous? But when the cake came to be mauled like that--oh,\nheavens! So the men who had quarrelled agreed to quarrel no more,\nand it was decided that there should be an end of mismanagement and\nidleness, and that this horrid sight of the weak pretending to be\nstrong, or the weak receiving the reward of strength, should be\nbrought to an end. Then came a great fight, in the last agonies of\nwhich the cake was sliced manfully. All the world knew how the fight\nwould go; but in the meantime lord-lieutenancies were arranged; very\nancient judges retired upon pensions; vice-royal Governors were sent\nout in the last gasp of the failing battle; great places were filled\nby tens, and little places by twenties; private secretaries were\nestablished here and there; and the hay was still made even after the\nsun had gone down.\n\nIn consequence of all this the circumstances of the election of 18--\nwere peculiar. Mr. Daubeny had dissolved the House, not probably\nwith any idea that he could thus retrieve his fortunes, but feeling\nthat in doing so he was occupying the last normal position of a\nproperly-fought Constitutional battle. His enemies were resolved,\nmore firmly than they were resolved before, to knock him altogether\non the head at the general election which he had himself called\ninto existence. He had been disgracefully out-voted in the House of\nCommons on various subjects. On the last occasion he had gone into\nhis lobby with a minority of 37, upon a motion brought forward by Mr.\nPalliser, the late Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, respecting\ndecimal coinage. No politician, not even Mr. Palliser himself, had\nexpected that he would carry his Bill in the present session. It\nwas brought forward as a trial of strength; and for such a purpose\ndecimal coinage was as good a subject as any other. It was Mr.\nPalliser's hobby, and he was gratified at having this further\nopportunity of ventilating it. When in power, he had not succeeded\nin carrying his measure, awed, and at last absolutely beaten, by the\ninfinite difficulty encountered in arranging its details. But his\nmind was still set upon it, and it was allowed by the whole party\nto be as good as anything else for the purpose then required. The\nConservative Government was beaten for the third or fourth time, and\nMr. Daubeny dissolved the House.\n\nThe whole world said that he might as well have resigned at once. It\nwas already the end of July, and there must be an autumn Session with\nthe new members. It was known to be impossible that he should find\nhimself supported by a majority after a fresh election. He had been\ntreated with manifest forbearance; the cake had been left in his\nhands for twelve months; the House was barely two years old; he\nhad no \"cry\" with which to meet the country; the dissolution was\nfactious, dishonest, and unconstitutional. So said all the Liberals,\nand it was deduced also that the Conservatives were in their hearts\nas angry as were their opponents. What was to be gained but the poor\ninterval of three months? There were clever men who suggested that\nMr. Daubeny had a scheme in his head--some sharp trick of political\nconjuring, some \"hocus-pocus presto\" sleight of hand, by which he\nmight be able to retain power, let the elections go as they would.\nBut, if so, he certainly did not make his scheme known to his own\nparty.\n\nHe had no cry with which to meet the country, nor, indeed, had\nthe leaders of the Opposition. Retrenchment, army reform, navy\nexcellence, Mr. Palliser's decimal coinage, and general good\ngovernment gave to all the old-Whig moderate Liberals plenty of\nmatter for speeches to their future constituents. Those who were more\nadvanced could promise the Ballot, and suggest the disestablishment\nof the Church. But the Government of the day was to be turned out\non the score of general incompetence. They were to be made to go,\nbecause they could not command majorities. But there ought to have\nbeen no dissolution, and Mr. Daubeny was regarded by his opponents,\nand indeed by very many of his followers also, with an enmity that\nwas almost ferocious. A seat in Parliament, if it be for five or six\nyears, is a blessing; but the blessing becomes very questionable if\nit have to be sought afresh every other Session.\n\nOne thing was manifest to thoughtful, working, eager political\nLiberals. They must have not only a majority in the next Parliament,\nbut a majority of good men--of men good and true. There must be no\nmore mismanagement; no more quarrelling; no more idleness. Was it to\nbe borne that an unprincipled so-called Conservative Prime Minister\nshould go on slicing the cake after such a fashion as that lately\nadopted? Old bishops had even talked of resigning, and Knights of the\nGarter had seemed to die on purpose. So there was a great stir at the\nLiberal political clubs, and every good and true man was summoned to\nthe battle.\n\nNow no Liberal soldier, as a young soldier, had been known to be more\ngood and true than Mr. Finn, the Irishman, who had held office two\nyears ago to the satisfaction of all his friends, and who had retired\nfrom office because he had found himself compelled to support a\nmeasure which had since been carried by those very men from whom he\nhad been obliged on this account to divide himself. It had always\nbeen felt by his old friends that he had been, if not ill-used, at\nleast very unfortunate. He had been twelve months in advance of his\nparty, and had consequently been driven out into the cold. So when\nthe names of good men and true were mustered, and weighed, and\ndiscussed, and scrutinised by some active members of the Liberal\nparty in a certain very private room not far removed from our\ngreat seat of parliamentary warfare; and when the capabilities,\nand expediencies, and possibilities were tossed to and fro among\nthese active members, it came to pass that the name of Mr. Finn\nwas mentioned more than once. Mr. Phineas Finn was the gentleman's\nname--which statement may be necessary to explain the term of\nendearment which was occasionally used in speaking of him.\n\n\"He has got some permanent place,\" said Mr. Ratler, who was living\non the well-founded hope of being a Treasury Secretary under the new\ndispensation; \"and of course he won't leave it.\"\n\nIt must be acknowledged that Mr. Ratler, than whom no judge in such\nmatters possessed more experience, had always been afraid of Phineas\nFinn.\n\n\"He'll lave it fast enough, if you'll make it worth his while,\" said\nthe Honourable Laurence Fitzgibbon, who also had his expectations.\n\n\"But he married when he went away, and he can't afford it,\" said Mr.\nBonteen, another keen expectant.\n\n\"Devil a bit,\" said the Honourable Laurence; \"or, anyways, the poor\nthing died of her first baby before it was born. Phinny hasn't an\nimpidiment, no more than I have.\"\n\n\"He's the best Irishman we ever got hold of,\" said Barrington\nErle--\"present company always excepted, Laurence.\"\n\n\"Bedad, you needn't except me, Barrington. I know what a man's made\nof, and what a man can do. And I know what he can't do. I'm not bad\nat the outside skirmishing. I'm worth me salt. I say that with a just\nreliance on me own powers. But Phinny is a different sort of man.\nPhinny can stick to a desk from twelve to seven, and wish to come\nback again after dinner. He's had money left him, too, and 'd like to\nspend some of it on an English borough.\"\n\n\"You never can quite trust him,\" said Bonteen. Now Mr. Bonteen had\nnever loved Mr. Finn.\n\n\"At any rate we'll try him again,\" said Barrington Erle, making a\nlittle note to that effect. And they did try him again.\n\nPhineas Finn, when last seen by the public, was departing from\nparliamentary life in London to the enjoyment of a modest place\nunder Government in his own country, with something of a shattered\nambition. After various turmoils he had achieved a competency, and\nhad married the girl of his heart. But now his wife was dead, and he\nwas again alone in the world. One of his friends had declared that\nmoney had been left to him. That was true, but the money had not been\nmuch. Phineas Finn had lost his father as well as his wife, and had\ninherited about four thousand pounds. He was not at this time much\nover thirty; and it must be acknowledged in regard to him that, since\nthe day on which he had accepted place and retired from London, his\nvery soul had sighed for the lost glories of Westminster and Downing\nStreet.\n\nThere are certain modes of life which, if once adopted, make\ncontentment in any other circumstances almost an impossibility. In\nold age a man may retire without repining, though it is often beyond\nthe power even of the old man to do so; but in youth, with all the\nfaculties still perfect, with the body still strong, with the hopes\nstill buoyant, such a change as that which had been made by Phineas\nFinn was more than he, or than most men, could bear with equanimity.\nHe had revelled in the gas-light, and could not lie quiet on a sunny\nbank. To the palate accustomed to high cookery, bread and milk is\nalmost painfully insipid. When Phineas Finn found himself discharging\nin Dublin the routine duties of his office,--as to which there was\nno public comment, no feeling that such duties were done in the face\nof the country,--he became sick at heart and discontented. Like\nthe warhorse out at grass he remembered the sound of the battle\nand the noise of trumpets. After five years spent in the heat and\nfull excitement of London society, life in Ireland was tame to\nhim, and cold, and dull. He did not analyse the difference between\nmetropolitan and quasi-metropolitan manners; but he found that men\nand women in Dublin were different from those to whom he had been\naccustomed in London. He had lived among lords, and the sons and\ndaughters of lords; and though the official secretaries and assistant\ncommissioners among whom his lot now threw him were for the most part\nclever fellows, fond of society, and perhaps more than his equals in\nthe kind of conversation which he found to be prevalent, still they\nwere not the same as the men he had left behind him,--men alive with\nthe excitement of parliamentary life in London. When in London he had\noften told himself that he was sick of it, and that he would better\nlove some country quiet life. Now Dublin was his Tibur, and the\nfickle one found that he could not be happy unless he were back again\nat Rome. When, therefore, he received the following letter from\nhis friend, Barrington Erle, he neighed like the old warhorse, and\nalready found himself shouting \"Ha, ha,\" among the trumpets.\n\n\n   ---- Street, 9th July, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR FINN,\n\n   Although you are not now immediately concerned in such\n   trifling matters you have no doubt heard that we are\n   all to be sent back at once to our constituents, and\n   that there will be a general election about the end of\n   September. We are sure that we shall have such a majority\n   as we never had before; but we are determined to make it\n   as strong as possible, and to get in all the good men that\n   are to be had. Have you a mind to try again? After all,\n   there is nothing like it.\n\n   Perhaps you may have some Irish seat in your eye for\n   which you would be safe. To tell the truth we know very\n   little of the Irish seats--not so much as, I think,\n   we ought to do. But if you are not so lucky I would\n   suggest Tankerville in Durham. Of course there would\n   be a contest, and a little money will be wanted; but the\n   money would not be much. Browborough has sat for the place\n   now for three Parliaments, and seems to think it all his\n   own. I am told that nothing could be easier than to turn\n   him out. You will remember the man--a great, hulking,\n   heavy, speechless fellow, who always used to sit just over\n   Lord Macaw's shoulder. I have made inquiry, and I am told\n   that he must walk if anybody would go down who could talk\n   to the colliers every night for a week or so. It would\n   just be the work for you. Of course, you should have all\n   the assistance we could give you, and Molescroft would put\n   you into the hands of an agent who wouldn't spend money\n   for you. \u00c2\u00a3500 would do it all.\n\n   I am very sorry to hear of your great loss, as also was\n   Lady Laura, who, as you are aware, is still abroad with\n   her father. We have all thought that the loneliness of\n   your present life might perhaps make you willing to come\n   back among us. I write instead of Ratler, because I\n   am helping him in the Northern Counties. But you will\n   understand all about that.\n\n   Yours, ever faithfully,\n\n   BARRINGTON ERLE.\n\n   Of course Tankerville has been dirty. Browborough has\n   spent a fortune there. But I do not think that that need\n   dishearten you. You will go there with clean hands. It\n   must be understood that there shall not be as much as a\n   glass of beer. I am told that the fellows won't vote for\n   Browborough unless he spends money, and I fancy he will be\n   afraid to do it heavily after all that has come and gone.\n   If he does you'll have him out on a petition. Let us have\n   an answer as soon as possible.\n\n\nHe at once resolved that he would go over and see; but, before he\nreplied to Erle's letter, he walked half-a-dozen times the length\nof the pier at Kingston meditating on his answer. He had no one\nbelonging to him. He had been deprived of his young bride, and left\ndesolate. He could ruin no one but himself. Where could there be a\nman in all the world who had a more perfect right to play a trick\nwith his own prospects? If he threw up his place and spent all his\nmoney, who could blame him? Nevertheless, he did tell himself that,\nwhen he should have thrown up his place and spent all his money,\nthere would remain to him his own self to be disposed of in a manner\nthat might be very awkward to him. A man owes it to his country, to\nhis friends, even to his acquaintance, that he shall not be known to\nbe going about wanting a dinner, with never a coin in his pocket. It\nis very well for a man to boast that he is lord of himself, and that\nhaving no ties he may do as he pleases with that possession. But it\nis a possession of which, unfortunately, he cannot rid himself when\nhe finds that there is nothing advantageous to be done with it.\nDoubtless there is a way of riddance. There is the bare bodkin. Or a\nman may fall overboard between Holyhead and Kingston in the dark, and\nmay do it in such a cunning fashion that his friends shall think that\nit was an accident. But against these modes of riddance there is a\ncanon set, which some men still fear to disobey.\n\nThe thing that he was asked to do was perilous. Standing in his\npresent niche of vantage he was at least safe. And added to his\nsafety there were material comforts. He had more than enough for his\nwants. His work was light; he lived among men and women with whom he\nwas popular. The very fact of his past parliamentary life had caused\nhim to be regarded as a man of some note among the notables of the\nIrish capital. Lord Lieutenants were gracious to him, and the wives\nof judges smiled upon him at their tables. He was encouraged to talk\nof those wars of the gods at which he had been present, and was so\ntreated as to make him feel that he was somebody in the world of\nDublin. Now he was invited to give all this up; and for what?\n\nHe answered that question to himself with enthusiastic eloquence.\nThe reward offered to him was the thing which in all the world he\nliked best. It was suggested to him that he should again have within\nhis reach that parliamentary renown which had once been the very\nbreath of his nostrils. We all know those arguments and quotations,\nantagonistic to prudence, with which a man fortifies himself in\nrashness. \"None but the brave deserve the fair.\" \"Where there's a\nwill there's a way.\" \"Nothing venture nothing have.\" \"The sword is\nto him who can use it.\" \"Fortune favours the bold.\" But on the other\nside there is just as much to be said. \"A bird in the hand is worth\ntwo in the bush.\" \"Look before you leap.\" \"Thrust not out your hand\nfurther than you can draw it back again.\" All which maxims of life\nPhineas Finn revolved within his own heart, if not carefully, at\nleast frequently, as he walked up and down the long pier of Kingston\nHarbour.\n\nBut what matter such revolvings? A man placed as was our Phineas\nalways does that which most pleases him at the moment, being but poor\nat argument if he cannot carry the weight to that side which best\nsatisfies his own feelings. Had not his success been very great when\nhe before made the attempt? Was he not well aware at every moment\nof his life that, after having so thoroughly learned his lesson in\nLondon, he was throwing away his hours amidst his present pursuits\nin Dublin? Did he not owe himself to his country? And then, again,\nwhat might not London do for him? Men who had begun as he begun had\nlived to rule over Cabinets, and to sway the Empire. He had been\nhappy for a short twelvemonth with his young bride,--for a short\ntwelvemonth,--and then she had been taken from him. Had she been\nspared to him he would never have longed for more than Fate had given\nhim. He would never have sighed again for the glories of Westminster\nhad his Mary not gone from him. Now he was alone in the world; and,\nthough he could look forward to possible and not improbable events\nwhich would make that future disposition of himself a most difficult\nquestion for him, still he would dare to try.\n\nAs the first result of Erle's letter Phineas was over in London early\nin August. If he went on with this matter, he must, of course, resign\nthe office for holding which he was now paid a thousand a year. He\ncould retain that as long as he chose to earn the money, but the\nearning of it would not be compatible with a seat in Parliament. He\nhad a few thousand pounds with which he could pay for the contest at\nTankerville, for the consequent petition which had been so generously\nsuggested to him, and maintain himself in London for a session or two\nshould he be so fortunate as to carry his election. Then he would be\npenniless, with the world before him as a closed oyster to be again\nopened, and he knew,--no one better,--that this oyster becomes harder\nand harder in the opening as the man who has to open it becomes\nolder. It is an oyster that will close to again with a snap, after\nyou have got your knife well into it, if you withdraw your point but\nfor a moment. He had had a rough tussle with the oyster already, and\nhad reached the fish within the shell. Nevertheless, the oyster which\nhe had got was not the oyster which he wanted. So he told himself\nnow, and here had come to him the chance of trying again.\n\nEarly in August he went over to England, saw Mr. Molescroft, and\nmade his first visit to Tankerville. He did not like the look of\nTankerville; but nevertheless he resigned his place before the\nmonth was over. That was the one great step, or rather the leap in\nthe dark,--and that he took. Things had been so arranged that the\nelection at Tankerville was to take place on the 20th of October.\nWhen the dissolution had been notified to all the world by Mr.\nDaubeny an earlier day was suggested; but Mr. Daubeny saw reasons for\npostponing it for a fortnight. Mr. Daubeny's enemies were again very\nferocious. It was all a trick. Mr. Daubeny had no right to continue\nPrime Minister a day after the decided expression of opinion as to\nunfitness which had been pronounced by the House of Commons. Men\nwere waxing very wrath. Nevertheless, so much power remained in Mr.\nDaubeny's hand, and the election was delayed. That for Tankerville\nwould not be held till the 20th of October. The whole House could not\nbe chosen till the end of the month,--hardly by that time--and yet\nthere was to be an autumn Session. The Ratlers and Bonteens were at\nany rate clear about the autumn Session. It was absolutely impossible\nthat Mr. Daubeny should be allowed to remain in power over Christmas,\nand up to February.\n\nMr. Molescroft, whom Phineas saw in London, was not a comfortable\ncounsellor. \"So you are going down to Tankerville?\" he said.\n\n\"They seem to think I might as well try.\"\n\n\"Quite right;--quite right. Somebody ought to try it, no doubt. It\nwould be a disgrace to the whole party if Browborough were allowed\nto walk over. There isn't a borough in England more sure to return a\nLiberal than Tankerville if left to itself. And yet that lump of a\nlegislator has sat there as a Tory for the last dozen years by dint\nof money and brass.\"\n\n\"You think we can unseat him?\"\n\n\"I don't say that. He hasn't come to the end of his money, and as to\nhis brass that is positively without end.\"\n\n\"But surely he'll have some fear of consequences after what has been\ndone?\"\n\n\"None in the least. What has been done? Can you name a single\nParliamentary aspirant who has been made to suffer?\"\n\n\"They have suffered in character,\" said Phineas. \"I should not like\nto have the things said of me that have been said of them.\"\n\n\"I don't know a man of them who stands in a worse position among his\nown friends than he occupied before. And men of that sort don't want\na good position among their enemies. They know they're safe. When the\nseat is in dispute everybody is savage enough; but when it is merely\na question of punishing a man, what is the use of being savage? Who\nknows whose turn it may be next?\"\n\n\"He'll play the old game, then?\"\n\n\"Of course he'll play the old game,\" said Mr. Molescroft. \"He doesn't\nknow any other game. All the purists in England wouldn't teach him to\nthink that a poor man ought not to sell his vote, and that a rich man\noughtn't to buy it. You mean to go in for purity?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"Browborough will think just as badly of you as you will of him.\nHe'll hate you because he'll think you are trying to rob him of what\nhe has honestly bought; but he'll hate you quite as much because\nyou try to rob the borough. He'd tell you if you asked him that he\ndoesn't want his seat for nothing, any more than he wants his house\nor his carriage-horses for nothing. To him you'll be a mean, low\ninterloper. But you won't care about that.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, if I can get the seat.\"\n\n\"But I'm afraid you won't. He will be elected. You'll petition. He'll\nlose his seat. There will be a commission. And then the borough will\nbe disfranchised. It's a fine career, but expensive; and then there\nis no reward beyond the self-satisfaction arising from a good action.\nHowever, Ruddles will do the best he can for you, and it certainly\nis possible that you may creep through.\" This was very disheartening,\nbut Barrington Erle assured our hero that such was Mr. Molescroft's\nusual way with candidates, and that it really meant little or\nnothing. At any rate, Phineas Finn was pledged to stand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHARRINGTON HALL.\n\n\nPhineas, on his first arrival in London, found a few of his old\nfriends, men who were still delayed by business though the Session\nwas over. He arrived on the 10th of August, which may be considered\nas the great day of the annual exodus, and he remembered how he,\ntoo, in former times had gone to Scotland to shoot grouse, and what\nhe had done there besides shooting. He had been a welcome guest at\nLoughlinter, the magnificent seat of Mr. Kennedy, and indeed there\nhad been that between him and Mr. Kennedy which ought to make him a\nwelcome guest there still. But of Mr. Kennedy he had heard nothing\ndirectly since he had left London. From Mr. Kennedy's wife, Lady\nLaura, who had been his great friend, he had heard occasionally; but\nshe was separated from her husband, and was living abroad with her\nfather, the Earl of Brentford. Has it not been written in a former\nbook how this Lady Laura had been unhappy in her marriage, having\nwedded herself to a man whom she had never loved, because he was rich\nand powerful, and how this very Phineas had asked her to be his bride\nafter she had accepted the rich man's hand? Thence had come great\ntrouble, but nevertheless there had been that between Mr. Kennedy and\nour hero which made Phineas feel that he ought still to be welcomed\nas a guest should he show himself at the door of Loughlinter Castle.\nThe idea came upon him simply because he found that almost every man\nfor whom he inquired had just started, or was just starting, for the\nNorth; and he would have liked to go where others went. He asked a\nfew questions as to Mr. Kennedy from Barrington Erle and others, who\nhad known him, and was told that the man now lived quite alone. He\nstill kept his seat in Parliament, but had hardly appeared during\nthe last Session, and it was thought that he would not come forward\nagain. Of his life in the country nothing was known. \"No one fishes\nhis rivers, or shoots his moors, as far as I can learn,\" said\nBarrington Erle. \"I suppose he looks after the sheep and says his\nprayers, and keeps his money together.\"\n\n\"And there has been no attempt at a reconciliation?\" Phineas asked.\n\n\"She went abroad to escape his attempts, and remains there in order\nthat she may be safe. Of all hatreds that the world produces, a\nwife's hatred for her husband, when she does hate him, is the\nstrongest.\"\n\nIn September Finn was back in Ireland, and about the end of that\nmonth he made his first visit to Tankerville. He remained there for\nthree or four days, and was terribly disgusted while staying at the\n\"Yellow\" inn, to find that the people of the town would treat him as\nthough he were rolling in wealth. He was soon tired of Tankerville,\nand as he could do nothing further, on the spot, till the time for\ncanvassing should come on, about ten days previous to the election,\nhe returned to London, somewhat at a loss to know how to bestir\nhimself. But in London he received a letter from another old friend,\nwhich decided him:--\n\n\"My dear Mr. Finn,\" said the letter,\n\n\n   of course you know that Oswald is now master of the Brake\n   hounds. Upon my word, I think it is the place in the world\n   for which he is most fit. He is a great martinet in the\n   field, and works at it as though it were for his bread. We\n   have been here looking after the kennels and getting up\n   the horses since the beginning of August, and have been\n   cub-hunting ever so long. Oswald wants to know whether you\n   won't come down to him till the election begins in earnest.\n\n   We were so glad to hear that you were going to appear\n   again. I have always known that it would be so. I have\n   told Oswald scores of times that I was sure you would\n   never be happy out of Parliament, and that your real\n   home must be somewhere near the Treasury Chambers. You\n   can't alter a man's nature. Oswald was born to be a master\n   of hounds, and you were born to be a Secretary of State.\n   He works the hardest and gets the least pay for it; but\n   then, as he says, he does not run so great a risk of being\n   turned out.\n\n   We haven't much of a house, but we have plenty of room for\n   you. As for the house, it was a matter of course, whether\n   good or bad. It goes with the kennels, and I should as\n   little think of having a choice as though I were one of\n   the horses. We have very good stables, and such a stud!\n   I can't tell you how many there are. In October it seems\n   as though their name were legion. In March there is\n   never anything for any body to ride on. I generally find\n   then that mine are taken for the whips. Do come and take\n   advantage of the flush. I can't tell you how glad we shall\n   be to see you. Oswald ought to have written himself, but\n   he says--; I won't tell you what he says. We shall take no\n   refusal. You can have nothing to do before you are wanted\n   at Tankerville.\n\n   I was so sorry to hear of your great loss. I hardly know\n   whether to mention it or to be silent in writing. If you\n   were here of course I should speak of her. And I would\n   rather renew your grief for a time than allow you to think\n   that I am indifferent. Pray come to us.\n\n   Yours ever most sincerely,\n\n   VIOLET CHILTERN.\n\n   Harrington Hall, Wednesday.\n\n\nPhineas Finn at once made up his mind that he would go to Harrington\nHall. There was the prospect in this of an immediate return to some\nof the most charming pleasures of the old life, which was very\ngrateful to him. It pleased him much that he should have been so\nthought of by this lady,--that she should have sought him out\nat once, at the moment of his reappearance. That she would have\nremembered him, he was quite sure, and that her husband, Lord\nChiltern, should remember him also, was beyond a doubt. There had\nbeen passages in their joint lives which people cannot forget. But\nit might so well have been the case that they should not have cared\nto renew their acquaintance with him. As it was, they must have\nmade close inquiry, and had sought him at the first day of his\nreappearance. The letter had reached him through the hands of\nBarrington Erle, who was a cousin of Lord Chiltern, and was at once\nanswered as follows:--\n\n\n   Fowler's Hotel, Jermyn Street,\n   October 1st.\n\n   MY DEAR LADY CHILTERN,\n\n   I cannot tell you how much pleasure the very sight of\n   your handwriting gave me. Yes, here I am again, trying my\n   hand at the old game. They say that you can never cure a\n   gambler or a politician; and, though I had very much to\n   make me happy till that great blow came upon me, I believe\n   that it is so. I am uneasy till I can see once more the\n   Speaker's wig, and hear bitter things said of this \"right\n   honourable gentleman,\" and of that noble friend. I want to\n   be once more in the midst of it; and as I have been left\n   singularly desolate in the world, without a tie by which\n   I am bound to aught but an honourable mode of living, I\n   have determined to run the risk, and have thrown up the\n   place which I held under Government. I am to stand for\n   Tankerville, as you have heard, and I am told by those to\n   whose tender mercies I have been confided by B. E. that I\n   have not a chance of success.\n\n   Your invitation is so tempting that I cannot refuse it.\n   As you say, I have nothing to do till the play begins.\n   I have issued my address, and must leave my name and my\n   fame to be discussed by the Tankervillians till I make\n   my appearance among them on the 10th of this month. Of\n   course, I had heard that Chiltern has the Brake, and I\n   have heard also that he is doing it uncommonly well. Tell\n   him that I have hardly seen a hound since the memorable\n   day on which I pulled him out from under his horse in the\n   brook at Wissindine. I don't know whether I can ride a\n   yard now. I will get to you on the 4th, and will remain if\n   you will keep me till the 9th. If Chiltern can put me up\n   on anything a little quieter than Bonebreaker, I'll go out\n   steadily, and see how he does his cubbing. I may, perhaps,\n   be justified in opining that Bonebreaker has before this\n   left the establishment. If so I may, perhaps, find myself\n   up to a little very light work.\n\n   Remember me very kindly to him. Does he make a good nurse\n   with the baby?\n\n   Yours, always faithfully,\n\n   PHINEAS FINN.\n\n   I cannot tell you with what pleasure I look forward to\n   seeing you both again.\n\n\nThe next few days went very heavily with him. There had, indeed,\nbeen no real reason why he should not have gone to Harrington Hall\nat once, except that he did not wish to seem to be utterly homeless.\nAnd yet were he there, with his old friends, he would not scruple\nfor a moment in owning that such was the case. He had fixed his day,\nhowever, and did remain in London till the 4th. Barrington Erle and\nMr. Ratler he saw occasionally, for they were kept in town on the\naffairs of the election. The one was generally full of hope; but the\nother was no better than a Job's comforter. \"I wouldn't advise you to\nexpect too much at Tankerville, you know,\" said Mr. Ratler.\n\n\"By no means,\" said Phineas, who had always disliked Ratler, and had\nknown himself to be disliked in return. \"I expect nothing.\"\n\n\"Browborough understands such a place as Tankerville so well! He has\nbeen at it all his life. Money is no object to him, and he doesn't\ncare a straw what anybody says of him. I don't think it's possible to\nunseat him.\"\n\n\"We'll try at least,\" said Phineas, upon whom, however, such remarks\nas these cast a gloom which he could not succeed in shaking off,\nthough he could summon vigour sufficient to save him from showing\nthe gloom. He knew very well that comfortable words would be spoken\nto him at Harrington Hall, and that then the gloom would go. The\ncomforting words of his friends would mean quite as little as the\ndiscourtesies of Mr. Ratler. He understood that thoroughly, and felt\nthat he ought to hold a stronger control over his own impulses. He\nmust take the thing as it would come, and neither the flatterings of\nfriends nor the threatenings of enemies could alter it; but he knew\nhis own weakness, and confessed to himself that another week of life\nby himself at Fowler's Hotel, refreshed by occasional interviews with\nMr. Ratler, would make him altogether unfit for the coming contest at\nTankerville.\n\nHe reached Harrington Hall in the afternoon about four, and found\nLady Chiltern alone. As soon as he saw her he told himself that she\nwas not in the least altered since he had last been with her, and yet\nduring the period she had undergone that great change which turns\na girl into a mother. She had the baby with her when he came into\nthe room, and at once greeted him as an old friend,--as a loved and\nloving friend who was to be made free at once to all the inmost\nprivileges of real friendship, which are given to and are desired by\nso few. \"Yes, here we are again,\" said Lady Chiltern, \"settled, as\nfar as I suppose we ever shall be settled, for ever so many years to\ncome. The place belongs to old Lord Gunthorpe, I fancy, but really I\nhardly know. I do know that we should give it up at once if we gave\nup the hounds, and that we can't be turned out as long as we have\nthem. Doesn't it seem odd to have to depend on a lot of yelping\ndogs?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Lady Chiltern and her baby.]\n\n\n\"Only that the yelping dogs depend on you.\"\n\n\"It's a kind of give and take, I suppose, like other things in the\nworld. Of course, he's a beautiful baby. I had him in just that\nyou might see him. I show Baby, and Oswald shows the hounds. We've\nnothing else to interest anybody. But nurse shall take him now.\nCome out and have a turn in the shrubbery before Oswald comes back.\nThey're gone to-day as far as Trumpeton Wood, out of which no fox was\never known to break, and they won't be home till six.\"\n\n\"Who are 'they'?\" asked Phineas, as he took his hat.\n\n\"The 'they' is only Adelaide Palliser. I don't think you ever knew\nher?\"\n\n\"Never. Is she anything to the other Pallisers?\"\n\n\"She is everything to them all; niece and grand-niece, and first\ncousin and grand-daughter. Her father was the fourth brother, and as\nshe was one of six her share of the family wealth is small. Those\nPallisers are very peculiar, and I doubt whether she ever saw the\nold duke. She has no father or mother, and lives when she is at home\nwith a married sister, about seventy years older than herself, Mrs.\nAttenbury.\"\n\n\"I remember Mrs. Attenbury.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. Who does not? Adelaide was a child then, I\nsuppose. Though I don't know why she should have been, as she calls\nherself one-and-twenty now. You'll think her pretty. I don't. But\nshe is my great new friend, and I like her immensely. She rides to\nhounds, and talks Italian, and writes for the _Times_.\"\n\n\"Writes for the _Times_!\"\n\n\"I won't swear that she does, but she could. There's only one other\nthing about her. She's engaged to be married.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I shall answer that question, and indeed I'm not\nsure that she is engaged. But there's a man dying for her.\"\n\n\"You must know, if she's your friend.\"\n\n\"Of course I know; but there are ever so many ins and outs, and I\nought not to have said a word about it. I shouldn't have done so to\nany one but you. And now we'll go in and have some tea, and go to\nbed.\"\n\n\"Go to bed!\"\n\n\"We always go to bed here before dinner on hunting days. When the\ncubbing began Oswald used to be up at three.\"\n\n\"He doesn't get up at three now.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless we go to bed. You needn't if you don't like, and I'll\nstay with you if you choose till you dress for dinner. I did know\nso well that you'd come back to London, Mr. Finn. You are not a bit\naltered.\"\n\n\"I feel to be changed in everything.\"\n\n\"Why should you be altered? It's only two years. I am altered because\nof Baby. That does change a woman. Of course I'm thinking always of\nwhat he will do in the world; whether he'll be a master of hounds\nor a Cabinet Minister or a great farmer;--or perhaps a miserable\nspendthrift, who will let everything that his grandfathers and\ngrandmothers have done for him go to the dogs.\"\n\n\"Why do you think of anything so wretched, Lady Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Who can help thinking? Men do do so. It seems to me that that is the\nline of most young men who come to their property early. Why should I\ndare to think that my boy should be better than others? But I do; and\nI fancy that he will be a great statesman. After all, Mr. Finn, that\nis the best thing that a man can be, unless it is given him to be a\nsaint and a martyr and all that kind of thing,--which is not just\nwhat a mother looks for.\"\n\n\"That would only be better than the spendthrift and gambler.\"\n\n\"Hardly better you'll say, perhaps. How odd that is! We all profess\nto believe when we're told that this world should be used merely as\na preparation for the next; and yet there is something so cold and\ncomfortless in the theory that we do not relish the prospect even for\nour children. I fancy your people have more real belief in it than\nours.\"\n\nNow Phineas Finn was a Roman Catholic. But the discussion was stopped\nby the noise of an arrival in the hall.\n\n\"There they are,\" said Lady Chiltern; \"Oswald never comes in without\na sound of trumpets to make him audible throughout the house.\" Then\nshe went to meet her husband, and Phineas followed her out of the\ndrawing-room.\n\nLord Chiltern was as glad to see him as she had been, and in a very\nfew minutes he found himself quite at home. In the hall he was\nintroduced to Miss Palliser, but he was hardly able to see her as she\nstood there a moment in her hat and habit. There was ever so much\nsaid about the day's work. The earths had not been properly stopped,\nand Lord Chiltern had been very angry, and the owner of Trumpeton\nWood, who was a great duke, had been much abused, and things had not\ngone altogether straight.\n\n\"Lord Chiltern was furious,\" said Miss Palliser, laughing, \"and\ntherefore, of course, I became furious too, and swore that it was\nan awful shame. Then they all swore that it was an awful shame, and\neverybody was furious. And you might hear one man saying to another\nall day long, 'By George, this is too bad.' But I never could quite\nmake out what was amiss, and I'm sure the men didn't know.\"\n\n\"What was it, Oswald?\"\n\n\"Never mind now. One doesn't go to Trumpeton Wood expecting to be\nhappy there. I've half a mind to swear I'll never draw it again.\"\n\n\"I've been asking him what was the matter all the way home,\" said\nMiss Palliser, \"but I don't think he knows himself.\"\n\n\"Come upstairs, Phineas, and I'll show you your room,\" said Lord\nChiltern. \"It's not quite as comfortable as the old 'Bull,' but we\nmake it do.\"\n\nPhineas, when he was alone, could not help standing for awhile with\nhis back to the fire thinking of it all. He did already feel himself\nto be at home in that house, and his doing so was a contradiction to\nall the wisdom which he had been endeavouring to teach himself for\nthe last two years. He had told himself over and over again that\nthat life which he had lived in London had been, if not a dream, at\nany rate not more significant than a parenthesis in his days, which,\nas of course it had no bearing on those which had gone before, so\nneither would it influence those which were to follow. The dear\nfriends of that period of feverish success would for the future\nbe to him as--nothing. That was the lesson of wisdom which he had\nendeavoured to teach himself, and the facts of the last two years had\nseemed to show that the lesson was a true lesson. He had disappeared\nfrom among his former companions, and had heard almost nothing from\nthem. From neither Lord Chiltern or his wife had he received any\ntidings. He had expected to receive none,--had known that in the\ncommon course of things none was to be expected. There were many\nothers with whom he had been intimate--Barrington Erle, Laurence\nFitzgibbon, Mr. Monk, a politician who had been in the Cabinet, and\nin consequence of whose political teaching he, Phineas Finn, had\nbanished himself from the political world;--from none of these had he\nreceived a line till there came that letter summoning him back to the\nbattle. There had never been a time during his late life in Dublin at\nwhich he had complained to himself that on this account his former\nfriends had forgotten him. If they had not written to him, neither\nhad he written to them. But on his first arrival in England he had,\nin the sadness of his solitude, told himself that he was forgotten.\nThere would be no return, so he feared, of those pleasant intimacies\nwhich he now remembered so well, and which, as he remembered them,\nwere so much more replete with unalloyed delights than they had ever\nbeen in their existing realities. And yet here he was, a welcome\nguest in Lord Chiltern's house, a welcome guest in Lady Chiltern's\ndrawing-room, and quite as much at home with them as ever he had been\nin the old days.\n\nWho is there that can write letters to all his friends, or would not\nfind it dreary work to do so even in regard to those whom he really\nloves? When there is something palpable to be said, what a blessing\nis the penny post! To one's wife, to one's child, one's mistress,\none's steward if there be a steward; one's gamekeeper, if there be\nshooting forward; one's groom, if there be hunting; one's publisher,\nif there be a volume ready or money needed; or one's tailor\noccasionally, if a coat be required, a man is able to write. But\nwhat has a man to say to his friend,--or, for that matter, what has\na woman? A Horace Walpole may write to a Mr. Mann about all things\nunder the sun, London gossip or transcendental philosophy, and if\nthe Horace Walpole of the occasion can write well and will labour\ndiligently at that vocation, his letters may be worth reading by\nhis Mr. Mann, and by others; but, for the maintenance of love and\nfriendship, continued correspondence between distant friends is\nnaught. Distance in time and place, but especially in time, will\ndiminish friendship. It is a rule of nature that it should be so,\nand thus the friendships which a man most fosters are those which he\ncan best enjoy. If your friend leave you, and seek a residence in\nPatagonia, make a niche for him in your memory, and keep him there\nas warm as you may. Perchance he may return from Patagonia and the\nold joys may be repeated. But never think that those joys can be\nmaintained by the assistance of ocean postage, let it be at never\nso cheap a rate. Phineas Finn had not thought this matter out very\ncarefully, and now, after two years of absence, he was surprised to\nfind that he was still had in remembrance by those who had never\ntroubled themselves to write to him a line during his absence.\n\nWhen he went down into the drawing-room he was surprised to find\nanother old friend sitting there alone. \"Mr. Finn,\" said the old\nlady, \"I hope I see you quite well. I am glad to meet you again. You\nfind my niece much changed, I dare say?\"\n\n\"Not in the least, Lady Baldock,\" said Phineas, seizing the proffered\nhand of the dowager. In that hour of conversation, which they had had\ntogether, Lady Chiltern had said not a word to Phineas of her aunt,\nand now he felt himself to be almost discomposed by the meeting. \"Is\nyour daughter here, Lady Baldock?\"\n\nLady Baldock shook her head solemnly and sadly. \"Do not speak of her,\nMr. Finn. It is too sad! We never mention her name now.\" Phineas\nlooked as sad as he knew how to look, but he said nothing. The\nlamentation of the mother did not seem to imply that the daughter was\ndead; and, from his remembrance of Augusta Boreham, he would have\nthought her to be the last woman in the world to run away with the\ncoachman. At the moment there did not seem to be any other sufficient\ncause for so melancholy a wagging of that venerable head. He had been\ntold to say nothing, and he could ask no questions; but Lady Baldock\ndid not choose that he should be left to imagine things more terrible\nthan the truth. \"She is lost to us for ever, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"How very sad.\"\n\n\"Sad, indeed! We don't know how she took it.\"\n\n\"Took what, Lady Baldock?\"\n\n\"I am sure it was nothing that she ever saw at home. If there is\na thing I'm true to, it is the Protestant Established Church of\nEngland. Some nasty, low, lying, wheedling priest got hold of her,\nand now she's a nun, and calls herself--Sister Veronica John!\" Lady\nBaldock threw great strength and unction into her description of the\npriest; but as soon as she had told her story a sudden thought struck\nher. \"Oh, laws! I quite forgot. I beg your pardon, Mr. Finn; but\nyou're one of them!\"\n\n\"Not a nun, Lady Baldock.\" At that moment the door was opened, and\nLord Chiltern came in, to the great relief of his wife's aunt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGERARD MAULE.\n\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" said Phineas that night after Lady Baldock\nwas gone to bed. The two men had taken off their dress coats, and had\nput on smoking caps,--Lord Chiltern, indeed, having clothed himself\nin a wonderful Chinese dressing-gown, and they were sitting round the\nfire in the smoking-room; but though they were thus employed and thus\ndressed the two younger ladies were still with them.\n\n\"How could I tell you everything in two minutes?\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"I'd have given a guinea to have heard her,\" said Lord Chiltern,\ngetting up and rubbing his hands as he walked about the room. \"Can't\nyou fancy all that she'd say, and then her horror when she'd remember\nthat Phineas was a Papist himself?\"\n\n\"But what made Miss Boreham turn nun?\"\n\n\"I fancy she found the penances lighter than they were at home,\" said\nthe lord. \"They couldn't well be heavier.\"\n\n\"Dear old aunt!\"\n\n\"Does she never go to see Sister Veronica?\" asked Miss Palliser.\n\n\"She has been once,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"And fumigated herself first so as to escape infection,\" said the\nhusband. \"You should hear Gerard Maule imitate her when she talks\nabout the filthy priest.\"\n\n\"And who is Gerard Maule?\" Then Lady Chiltern looked at her friend,\nand Phineas was almost sure that Gerard Maule was the man who was\ndying for Adelaide Palliser.\n\n\"He's a great ally of mine,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"He's a young fellow who thinks he can ride to hounds,\" said Lord\nChiltern, \"and who very often does succeed in riding over them.\"\n\n\"That's not fair, Lord Chiltern,\" said Miss Palliser.\n\n\"Just my idea of it,\" replied the Master. \"I don't think it's at all\nfair. Because a man has plenty of horses, and nothing else to do, and\nrides twelve stone, and doesn't care how he's sworn at, he's always\nto be over the scent, and spoil every one's sport. I don't call it at\nall fair.\"\n\n\"He's a very nice fellow, and a great friend of Oswald's. He is to be\nhere to-morrow, and you'll like him very much. Won't he, Adelaide?\"\n\n\"I don't know Mr. Finn's tastes quite so well as you do, Violet. But\nMr. Maule is so harmless that no one can dislike him very much.\"\n\n\"As for being harmless, I'm not so sure,\" said Lady Chiltern. After\nthat they all went to bed.\n\nPhineas remained at Harrington Hall till the ninth, on which day he\nwent to London so that he might be at Tankerville on the tenth. He\nrode Lord Chiltern's horses, and took an interest in the hounds, and\nnursed the baby. \"Now tell me what you think of Gerard Maule,\" Lady\nChiltern asked him, the day before he started.\n\n\"I presume that he is the young man that is dying for Miss Palliser.\"\n\n\"You may answer my question, Mr. Finn, without making any such\nsuggestion.\"\n\n\"Not discreetly. Of course if he is to be made happy, I am bound at\nthe present moment to say all good things of him. At such a crisis it\nwould be wicked to tinge Miss Palliser's hopes with any hue less warm\nthan rose colour.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that I tell everything that is said to me?\"\n\n\"Not at all; but opinions do ooze out. I take him to be a good sort\nof a fellow; but why doesn't he talk a bit more?\"\n\n\"That's just it.\"\n\n\"And why does he pretend to do nothing? When he's out he rides\nhard; but at other times there's a ha-ha, lack a-daisical air about\nhim which I hate. Why men assume it I never could understand. It\ncan recommend them to nobody. A man can't suppose that he'll gain\nanything by pretending that he never reads, and never thinks, and\nnever does anything, and never speaks, and doesn't care what he has\nfor dinner, and, upon the whole, would just as soon lie in bed all\nday as get up. It isn't that he is really idle. He rides and eats,\nand does get up, and I daresay talks and thinks. It's simply a poor\naffectation.\"\n\n\"That's your rose colour, is it?\"\n\n\"You've promised secrecy, Lady Chiltern. I suppose he's well off?\"\n\n\"He is an eldest son. The property is not large, and I'm afraid\nthere's something wrong about it.\"\n\n\"He has no profession?\"\n\n\"None at all. He has an allowance of \u00c2\u00a3800 a year, which in some sort\nof fashion is independent of his father. He has nothing on earth to\ndo. Adelaide's whole fortune is four thousand pounds. If they were to\nmarry what would become of them?\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be enough to live on?\"\n\n\"It ought to be enough,--as he must, I suppose, have the property\nsome day,--if only he had something to do. What sort of a life would\nhe lead?\"\n\n\"I suppose he couldn't become a Master of Hounds?\"\n\n\"That is ill-natured, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I did not mean it so. I did not indeed. You must know that I did\nnot.\"\n\n\"Of course Oswald had nothing to do, and, of course, there was a time\nwhen I wished that he should take to Parliament. No one knew all that\nbetter than you did. But he was very different from Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"Very different, indeed.\"\n\n\"Oswald is a man full of energy, and with no touch of that\naffectation which you described. As it is, he does work hard. No\nman works harder. The learned people say that you should produce\nsomething, and I don't suppose that he produces much. But somebody\nmust keep hounds, and nobody could do it better than he does.\"\n\n\"You don't think that I meant to blame him?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"Are he and his father on good terms now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. His father wishes him to go to Saulsby, but he won't do\nthat. He hates Saulsby.\"\n\nSaulsby was the country seat of the Earl of Brentford, the name of\nthe property which must some day belong to this Lord Chiltern, and\nPhineas, as he heard this, remembered former days in which he had\nridden about Saulsby Woods, and had thought them to be anything but\nhateful. \"Is Saulsby shut up?\" he asked.\n\n\"Altogether, and so is the house in Portman Square. There never was\nanything more sad or desolate. You would find him altered, Mr. Finn.\nHe is quite an old man now. He was here in the spring, for a week or\ntwo;--in England, that is; but he stayed at an hotel in London. He\nand Laura live at Dresden now, and a very sad time they must have.\"\n\n\"Does she write?\"\n\n\"Yes; and keeps up all her interest about politics. I have already\ntold her that you are to stand for Tankerville. No one,--no other\nhuman being in the world will be so interested for you as she is.\nIf any friend ever felt an interest almost selfish for a friend's\nwelfare, she will feel such an interest for you. If you were to\nsucceed it would give her a hope in life.\" Phineas sat silent,\ndrinking in the words that were said to him. Though they were true,\nor at least meant to be true, they were full of flattery. Why should\nthis woman of whom they were speaking love him so dearly? She was\nnothing to him. She was highly born, greatly gifted, wealthy, and a\nmarried woman, whose character, as he well knew, was beyond the taint\nof suspicion, though she had been driven by the hard sullenness of\nher husband to refuse to live under his roof. Phineas Finn and Lady\nLaura Kennedy had not seen each other for two years, and when they\nhad parted, though they had lived as friends, there had been no signs\nof still living friendship. True, indeed, she had written to him,\nbut her letters had been short and cold, merely detailing certain\ncircumstances of her outward life. Now he was told by this woman's\ndearest friend that his welfare was closer to her heart than any\nother interest!\n\n\"I daresay you often think of her?\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Indeed, I do.\"\n\n\"What virtues she used to ascribe to you! What sins she forgave you!\nHow hard she fought for you! Now, though she can fight no more, she\ndoes not think of it all the less.\"\n\n\"Poor Lady Laura!\"\n\n\"Poor Laura, indeed! When one sees such shipwreck it makes a woman\ndoubt whether she ought to marry at all.\"\n\n\"And yet he was a good man. She always said so.\"\n\n\"Men are so seldom really good. They are so little sympathetic. What\nman thinks of changing himself so as to suit his wife? And yet men\nexpect that women shall put on altogether new characters when they\nare married, and girls think that they can do so. Look at this\nMr. Maule, who is really over head and ears in love with Adelaide\nPalliser. She is full of hope and energy. He has none. And yet he has\nthe effrontery to suppose that she will adapt herself to his way of\nliving if he marries her.\"\n\n\"Then they are to be married?\"\n\n\"I suppose it will come to that. It always does if the man is\nin earnest. Girls will accept men simply because they think it\nill-natured to return the compliment of an offer with a hearty 'No.'\"\n\n\"I suppose she likes him?\"\n\n\"Of course she does. A girl almost always likes a man who is in love\nwith her,--unless indeed she positively dislikes him. But why should\nshe like him? He is good-looking, is a gentleman, and not a fool.\nIs that enough to make such a girl as Adelaide Palliser think a man\ndivine?\"\n\n\"Is nobody to be accepted who is not credited with divinity?\"\n\n\"The man should be a demigod, at least in respect to some part of his\ncharacter. I can find nothing even demi-divine about Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"That's because you are not in love with him, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\nSix or seven very pleasant days Phineas Finn spent at Harrington\nHall, and then he started alone, and very lonely, for Tankerville.\nBut he admitted to himself that the pleasure which he had received\nduring his visit was quite sufficient to qualify him in running\nany risk in an attempt to return to the kind of life which he had\nformerly led. But if he should fail at Tankerville what would become\nof him then?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTANKERVILLE.\n\n\nThe great Mr. Molescroft himself came over to Tankerville for the\npurpose of introducing our hero to the electors and to Mr. Ruddles,\nthe local Liberal agent, who was to be employed. They met at the\nLambton Arms, and there Phineas established himself, knowing well\nthat he had before him ten days of unmitigated vexation and misery.\nTankerville was a dirty, prosperous, ungainly town, which seemed to\nexude coal-dust or coal-mud at every pore. It was so well recognised\nas being dirty that people did not expect to meet each other with\nclean hands and faces. Linen was never white at Tankerville, and\neven ladies who sat in drawing-rooms were accustomed to the feel and\ntaste and appearance of soot in all their daintiest recesses. We hear\nthat at Oil City the flavour of petroleum is hardly considered to be\ndisagreeable, and so it was with the flavour of coal at Tankerville.\nAnd we know that at Oil City the flavour of petroleum must not be\nopenly declared to be objectionable, and so it was with coal at\nTankerville. At Tankerville coal was much loved, and was not thought\nto be dirty. Mr. Ruddles was very much begrimed himself, and some\nof the leading Liberal electors, upon whom Phineas Finn had already\ncalled, seemed to be saturated with the product of the district. It\nwould not, however, in any event be his duty to live at Tankerville,\nand he had believed from the first moment of his entrance into the\ntown that he would soon depart from it, and know it no more. He felt\nthat the chance of his being elected was quite a forlorn hope, and\ncould hardly understand why he had allowed himself to be embarrassed\nby so very unprofitable a speculation.\n\nPhineas Finn had thrice before this been chosen to sit in\nParliament--twice for the Irish borough of Loughshane, and once for\nthe English borough of Loughton; but he had been so happy as hitherto\nto have known nothing of the miseries and occasional hopelessness of\na contested election. At Loughton he had come forward as the nominee\nof the Earl of Brentford, and had been returned without any chance of\nfailure by that nobleman's influence. At Loughshane things had nearly\nbeen as pleasant with him. He had almost been taught to think that\nnothing could be easier than getting into Parliament if only a man\ncould live when he was there. But Loughton and Loughshane were gone,\nwith so many other comfortable things of old days, and now he found\nhimself relegated to a borough to which, as it seemed to him, he was\nsent to fight, not that he might win, but because it was necessary\nto his party that the seat should not be allowed to be lost without\nfighting. He had had the pleasant things of parliamentary adventure,\nand now must undergo those which were unpleasant. No doubt he could\nhave refused, but he had listened to the tempter, and could not now\ngo back, though Mr. Ruddles was hardly more encouraging than Mr.\nMolescroft.\n\n\"Browborough has been at work for the last three days,\" said Mr.\nRuddles, in a tone of reproach. Mr. Ruddles had always thought that\nno amount of work could be too heavy for his candidates.\n\n\"Will that make much difference?\" asked Mr. Molescroft.\n\n\"Well, it does. Of course, he has been among the colliers,--when we\nought to have been before him.\"\n\n\"I came when I was told,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I'd have telegraphed to you if I'd known where you were. But there's\nno help for spilt milk. We must get to work now,--that's all. I\nsuppose you're for disestablishing the Church?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" said Phineas, who felt that with him, as a Roman\nCatholic, this was a delicate subject.\n\n\"We needn't go into that, need we?\" said Mr. Molescroft, who, though\na Liberal, was a good Churchman.\n\nMr. Ruddles was a Dissenter, but the very strong opinion which Mr.\nRuddles now expressed as to the necessity that the new candidate\nshould take up the Church question did not spring at all from his own\nreligious convictions. His present duty called upon him to have a\nLiberal candidate if possible returned for the borough with which he\nwas connected, and not to disseminate the doctrines of his own sect.\nNevertheless, his opinion was very strong. \"I think we must, Mr.\nMolescroft,\" said he; \"I'm sure we must. Browborough has taken up\nthe other side. He went to church last Sunday with the Mayor and two\nof the Aldermen, and I'm told he said all the responses louder than\nanybody else. He dined with the Vicar of Trinity on Monday. He has\nbeen very loud in denouncing Mr. Finn as a Roman Catholic, and has\ndeclared that everything will be up with the State if Tankerville\nreturns a friend and supporter of the Pope. You'll find that the\nChurch will be the cry here this election. You can't get anything by\nsupporting it, but you may make a strong party by pledging yourself\nto disendowment.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't local taxation do?\" asked Mr. Molescroft, who indeed\npreferred almost any other reform to disendowment.\n\n\"I have made up my mind that we must have some check on municipal\nexpenditure,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"It won't do--not alone. If I understand the borough, the feeling at\nthis election will altogether be about the Church. You see, Mr. Finn,\nyour being a Roman Catholic gives them a handle, and they're already\nbeginning to use it. They don't like Roman Catholics here; but if\nyou can manage to give it a sort of Liberal turn,--as many of your\nconstituents used to do, you know,--as though you disliked Church and\nState rather than cared for the Pope, may be it might act on our side\nrather than on theirs. Mr. Molescroft understands it all.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I understand.\"\n\nMr. Ruddles said a great deal more to the same effect, and though Mr.\nMolescroft did not express any acquiescence in these views, neither\ndid he dissent. The candidate said but little at this interview, but\nturned the matter over in his mind. A seat in Parliament would be\nbut a barren honour, and he could not afford to offer his services\nfor barren honour. Honest political work he was anxious to do, but\nfor what work he did he desired to be paid. The party to which he\nbelonged had, as he knew, endeavoured to avoid the subject of the\ndisendowment of the Church of England. It is the necessary nature\nof a political party in this country to avoid, as long as it can be\navoided, the consideration of any question which involves a great\nchange. There is a consciousness on the minds of leading politicians\nthat the pressure from behind, forcing upon them great measures,\ndrives them almost quicker than they can go, so that it becomes a\nnecessity with them to resist rather than to aid the pressure which\nwill certainly be at last effective by its own strength. The best\ncarriage horses are those which can most steadily hold back against\nthe coach as it trundles down the hill. All this Phineas knew, and\nwas of opinion that the Barrington Erles and Ratlers of his party\nwould not thank him for ventilating a measure which, however certain\nmight be its coming, might well be postponed for a few years. Once\nalready in his career he had chosen to be in advance of his party,\nand the consequences had been disastrous to him. On that occasion his\nfeelings had been strong in regard to the measure upon which he broke\naway from his party; but, when he first thought of it, he did not\ncare much about Church disendowment.\n\nBut he found that he must needs go as he was driven or else depart\nout of the place. He wrote a line to his friend Erle, not to ask\nadvice, but to explain the circumstances. \"My only possible chance\nof success will lie in attacking the Church endowments. Of course I\nthink they are bad, and of course I think that they must go. But I\nhave never cared for the matter, and would have been very willing to\nleave it among those things which will arrange themselves. But I have\nno choice here.\" And so he prepared himself to run his race on the\ncourse arranged for him by Mr. Ruddles. Mr. Molescroft, whose hours\nwere precious, soon took his leave, and Phineas Finn was placarded\nabout the town as the sworn foe to all Church endowments.\n\nIn the course of his canvass, and the commotions consequent upon\nit, he found that Mr. Ruddles was right. No other subject seemed at\nthe moment to have any attraction in Tankerville. Mr. Browborough,\nwhose life had not been passed in any strict obedience to the Ten\nCommandments, and whose religious observances had not hitherto\ninterfered with either the pleasures or the duties of his life,\nrepeated at every meeting which he attended, and almost to every\nelector whom he canvassed, the great Shibboleth which he had now\nadopted--\"The prosperity of England depends on the Church of her\npeople.\" He was not an orator. Indeed, it might be hard to find a\nman, who had for years been conversant with public life, less able\nto string a few words together for immediate use. Nor could he learn\nhalf-a-dozen sentences by rote. But he could stand up with unabashed\nbrow and repeat with enduring audacity the same words a dozen times\nover--\"The prosperity of England depends on the Church of her\npeople.\" Had he been asked whether the prosperity which he promised\nwas temporal or spiritual in its nature, not only could he not have\nanswered, but he would not in the least have understood the question.\nBut the words as they came from his mouth had a weight which seemed\nto ensure their truth, and many men in Tankerville thought that Mr.\nBrowborough was eloquent.\n\nPhineas, on the other hand, made two or three great speeches every\nevening, and astonished even Mr. Ruddles by his oratory. He had\naccepted Mr. Ruddles's proposition with but lukewarm acquiescence,\nbut in the handling of the matter he became zealous, fiery,\nand enthusiastic. He explained to his hearers with gracious\nacknowledgment that Church endowments had undoubtedly been most\nbeneficent in past times. He spoke in the interests of no special\ncreed. Whether in the so-called Popish days of Henry VIII and his\nancestors, or in the so-called Protestant days that had followed,\nthe state of society had required that spiritual teaching should be\nsupplied from funds fixed and devoted to the purpose. The increasing\nintelligence and population of the country made this no longer\ndesirable,--or, if desirable, no longer possible. Could these\nendowments be increased to meet the needs of the increasing millions?\nWas it not the fact that even among members of the Church of England\nthey were altogether inefficient to supply the wants of our great\ntowns? Did the people of Tankerville believe that the clergymen of\nLondon, of Liverpool, and of Manchester were paid by endowments? The\narguments which had been efficacious in Ireland must be efficacious\nin England. He said this without reference to one creed or to\nanother. He did believe in religious teaching. He had not a word to\nsay against a Protestant Episcopal Church. But he thought, nay he\nwas sure, that Church and State, as combined institutions, could no\nlonger prevail in this country. If the people of Tankerville would\nreturn him to Parliament it should be his first object to put an end\nto this anomaly.\n\nThe Browboroughites were considerably astonished by his success. The\ncolliers on this occasion did not seem to regard the clamour that\nwas raised against Irish Papists. Much dirt was thrown and some\nheads were broken; but Phineas persevered. Mr. Ruddles was lost in\nadmiration. They had never before had at Tankerville a man who could\ntalk so well. Mr. Browborough without ceasing repeated his well-worn\nassurance, and it was received with the loudest exclamations of\ndelight by his own party. The clergymen of the town and neighbourhood\ncrowded round him and pursued him, and almost seemed to believe in\nhim. They were at any rate fighting their battle as best they knew\nhow to fight it. But the great body of the colliers listened to\nPhineas, and every collier was now a voter. Then Mr. Ruddles, who\nhad many eyes, began to perceive that the old game was to be played.\n\"There'll be money going to-morrow after all,\" he whispered to Finn\nthe evening before the election.\n\n\"I suppose you expected that.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure. They began by thinking they could do without it. They\ndon't want to sacrifice the borough.\"\n\n\"Nor do I, Mr. Ruddles.\"\n\n\"But they'll sooner do that than lose the seat. A couple of dozen of\nmen out of the Fallgate would make us safe.\" Mr. Ruddles smiled as he\nsaid this.\n\nAnd Phineas smiled as he answered, \"If any good can be done by\ntalking to the men at the Fallgate, I'll talk to them by the hour\ntogether.\"\n\n\"We've about done all that,\" said Mr. Ruddles.\n\nThen came the voting. Up to two o'clock the polling was so equal that\nthe numbers at Mr. Browborough's committee room were always given in\nhis favour, and those at the Liberal room in favour of Phineas Finn.\nAt three o'clock Phineas was acknowledged to be ten ahead. He himself\nwas surprised at his own success, and declared to himself that his\nold luck had not deserted him.\n\n\"They're giving \u00c2\u00a32 10_s._ a vote at the Fallgate this minute,\" said\nRuddles to him at a quarter-past three.\n\n\"We shall have to prove it.\"\n\n\"We can do that, I think,\" said Ruddles.\n\nAt four o'clock, when the poll was over, Browborough was declared\nto have won on the post by seven votes. He was that same evening\ndeclared by the Mayor to have been elected sitting member for the\nborough, and he again assured the people in his speech that the\nprosperity of England depends on the Church of her people.\n\n\"We shall carry the seat on a scrutiny as sure as eggs,\" said Mr.\nRuddles, who had been quite won by the gallant way in which Phineas\nhad fought his battle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nMR. DAUBENY'S GREAT MOVE.\n\n\nThe whole Liberal party was taken very much by surprise at the course\nwhich the election ran. Or perhaps it might be more proper to say\nthat the parliamentary leaders of the party were surprised. It had\nnot been recognised by them as necessary that the great question of\nChurch and State should be generally discussed on this occasion. It\nwas a matter of course that it should be discussed at some places,\nand by some men. Eager Dissenters would, of course, take advantage\nof the opportunity to press their views, and no doubt the entire\nabolition of the Irish Church as a State establishment had taught\nLiberals to think and Conservatives to fear that the question would\nforce itself forward at no very distant date. But it had not been\nexpected to do so now. The general incompetence of a Ministry who\ncould not command a majority on any measure was intended to be the\nstrong point of the Liberal party, not only at the election, but at\nthe meeting of Parliament. The Church question, which was necessarily\nfelt by all statesmen to be of such magnitude as to dwarf every\nother, was not wanted as yet. It might remain in the background as\nthe future standing-point for some great political struggle, in which\nit would be again necessary that every Liberal should fight, as\nthough for life, with his teeth and nails. Men who ten years since\nregarded almost with abhorrence, and certainly with distrust, the\nidea of disruption between Church and State in England, were no\ndoubt learning to perceive that such disruption must come, and were\nreconciling themselves to it after that slow, silent, inargumentative\nfashion in which convictions force themselves among us. And from\nreconciliation to the idea some were advancing to enthusiasm on its\nbehalf. \"It is only a question of time,\" was now said by many who\nhardly remembered how devoted they had been to the Established Church\nof England a dozen years ago. But the fruit was not yet ripe, and the\nleaders of the Liberal party by no means desired that it should be\nplucked. They were, therefore, surprised, and but little pleased,\nwhen they found that the question was more discussed than any other\non the hustings of enthusiastically political boroughs.\n\nBarrington Erle was angry when he received the letter of Phineas\nFinn. He was at that moment staying with the Duke of St. Bungay,\nwho was regarded by many as the only possible leader of the Liberal\nparty, should Mr. Gresham for any reason fail them. Indeed the old\nWhigs, of whom Barrington Erle considered himself to be one, would\nhave much preferred the Duke to Mr. Gresham, had it been possible\nto set Mr. Gresham aside. But Mr. Gresham was too strong to be set\naside; and Erle and the Duke, with all their brethren, were minded to\nbe thoroughly loyal to their leader. He was their leader, and not to\nbe loyal was, in their minds, treachery. But occasionally they feared\nthat the man would carry them whither they did not desire to go. In\nthe meantime heavy things were spoken of our poor friend, Finn.\n\n\"After all, that man is an ass,\" said Erle.\n\n\"If so, I believe you are altogether responsible for him,\" said the\nDuke.\n\n\"Well, yes, in a measure; but not altogether. That, however, is a\nlong story. He has many good gifts. He is clever, good-tempered, and\none of the pleasantest fellows that ever lived. The women all like\nhim.\"\n\n\"So the Duchess tells me.\"\n\n\"But he is not what I call loyal. He cannot keep himself from running\nafter strange gods. What need had he to take up the Church question\nat Tankerville? The truth is, Duke, the thing is going to pieces.\nWe get men into the House now who are clever, and all that sort\nof thing, and who force their way up, but who can't be made to\nunderstand that everybody should not want to be Prime Minister.\" The\nDuke, who was now a Nestor among politicians, though very green in\nhis age, smiled as he heard remarks which had been familiar to him\nfor the last forty years. He, too, liked his party, and was fond of\nloyal men; but he had learned at last that all loyalty must be built\non a basis of self-advantage. Patriotism may exist without it, but\nthat which Erle called loyalty in politics was simply devotion to the\nside which a man conceives to be his side, and which he cannot leave\nwithout danger to himself.\n\nBut if discontent was felt at the eagerness with which this subject\nwas taken up at certain boroughs, and was adopted by men whose votes\nand general support would be essentially necessary to the would-be\ncoming Liberal Government, absolute dismay was occasioned by a speech\nthat was made at a certain county election. Mr. Daubeny had for many\nyears been member for East Barsetshire, and was as sure of his seat\nas the Queen of her throne. No one would think of contesting Mr.\nDaubeny's right to sit for East Barsetshire, and no doubt he might\nhave been returned without showing himself to the electors. But he\ndid show himself to the electors; and, as a matter of course, made\na speech on the occasion. It so happened that the day fixed for the\nelection in this division of the county was quite at the close of\nthis period of political excitement. When Mr. Daubeny addressed his\nfriends in East Barsetshire the returns throughout the kingdom were\nnearly complete. No attention had been paid to this fact during the\nelections, but it was afterwards asserted that the arrangement had\nbeen made with a political purpose, and with a purpose which was\npolitically dishonest. Mr. Daubeny, so said the angry Liberals,\nhad not chosen to address his constituents till his speech at the\nhustings could have no effect on other counties. Otherwise,--so said\nthe Liberals,--the whole Conservative party would have been called\nupon to disavow at the hustings the conclusion to which Mr. Daubeny\nhinted in East Barsetshire that he had arrived. The East Barsetshire\nmen themselves,--so said the Liberals,--had been too crass to catch\nthe meaning hidden under his ambiguous words; but those words, when\nread by the light of astute criticism, were found to contain an\nopinion that Church and State should be dissevered. \"By G----! he's\ngoing to take the bread out of our mouths again,\" said Mr. Ratler.\n\nThe speech was certainly very ambiguous, and I am not sure that the\nEast Barsetshire folk were so crass as they were accused of being,\nin not understanding it at once. The dreadful hint was wrapped up in\nmany words, and formed but a small part of a very long oration. The\nbucolic mind of East Barsetshire took warm delight in the eloquence\nof the eminent personage who represented them, but was wont to\nextract more actual enjoyment from the music of his periods than from\nthe strength of his arguments. When he would explain to them that\nhe had discovered a new, or rather hitherto unknown, Conservative\nelement in the character of his countrymen, which he could best\nutilise by changing everything in the Constitution, he manipulated\nhis words with such grace, was so profound, so broad, and so exalted,\nwas so brilliant in mingling a deep philosophy with the ordinary\npolitics of the day, that the bucolic mind could only admire. It\nwas a great honour to the electors of that agricultural county that\nthey should be made the first recipients of these pearls, which\nwere not wasted by being thrown before them. They were picked up\nby the gentlemen of the Press, and became the pearls, not of East\nBarsetshire, but of all England. On this occasion it was found that\none pearl was very big, very rare, and worthy of great attention;\nbut it was a black pearl, and was regarded by many as an abominable\nprodigy. \"The period of our history is one in which it becomes\nessential for us to renew those inquiries which have prevailed since\nman first woke to his destiny, as to the amount of connection which\nexists and which must exist between spiritual and simply human forms\nof government,--between our daily religion and our daily politics,\nbetween the Crown and the Mitre.\" The East Barsetshire clergymen and\nthe East Barsetshire farmers like to hear something of the mitre in\npolitical speeches at the hustings. The word sounds pleasantly in\ntheir ears, as appertaining to good old gracious times and good old\ngracious things. As honey falls fast from the mouth of the practised\nspeaker, the less practised hearer is apt to catch more of the words\nthan of the sense. The speech of Mr. Daubeny was taken all in good\npart by his assembled friends. But when it was read by the quidnuncs\non the following day it was found to contain so deep a meaning that\nit produced from Mr. Ratler's mouth those words of fear which have\nbeen already quoted.\n\nCould it really be the case that the man intended to perform so\naudacious a trick of legerdemain as this for the preservation of his\npower, and that if he intended it he should have the power to carry\nit through? The renewal of inquiry as to the connection which exists\nbetween the Crown and the Mitre, when the bran was bolted, could only\nmean the disestablishment of the Church. Mr. Ratler and his friends\nwere not long in bolting the bran. Regarding the matter simply in its\nown light, without bringing to bear upon it the experience of the\nlast half-century, Mr. Ratler would have thought his party strong\nenough to defy Mr. Daubeny utterly in such an attempt. The ordinary\npolitician, looking at Mr. Daubeny's position as leader of the\nConservative party, as a statesman depending on the support of the\nChurch, as a Minister appointed to his present place for the express\nobject of defending all that was left of old, and dear, and venerable\nin the Constitution, would have declared that Mr. Daubeny was\ncommitting political suicide, as to which future history would record\na verdict of probably not temporary insanity. And when the speech was\na week old this was said in many a respectable household through the\ncountry. Many a squire, many a parson, many a farmer was grieved for\nMr. Daubeny when the words had been explained to him, who did not for\na moment think that the words could be portentous as to the great\nConservative party. But Mr. Ratler remembered Catholic emancipation,\nhad himself been in the House when the Corn Laws were repealed, and\nhad been nearly broken-hearted when household suffrage had become\nthe law of the land while a Conservative Cabinet and a Conservative\nGovernment were in possession of dominion in Israel.\n\nMr. Bonteen was disposed to think that the trick was beyond the\nconjuring power even of Mr. Daubeny. \"After all, you know, there is\nthe party,\" he said to Mr. Ratler. Mr. Ratler's face was as good\nas a play, and if seen by that party would have struck that party\nwith dismay and shame. The meaning of Mr. Ratler's face was plain\nenough. He thought so little of that party, on the score either of\nintelligence, honesty, or fidelity, as to imagine that it would\nconsent to be led whithersoever Mr. Daubeny might choose to lead\nit. \"If they care about anything, it's about the Church,\" said Mr.\nBonteen.\n\n\"There's something they like a great deal better than the Church,\"\nsaid Mr. Ratler. \"Indeed, there's only one thing they care about at\nall now. They've given up all the old things. It's very likely that\nif Daubeny were to ask them to vote for pulling down the Throne and\nestablishing a Republic they'd all follow him into the lobby like\nsheep. They've been so knocked about by one treachery after another\nthat they don't care now for anything beyond their places.\"\n\n\"It's only a few of them get anything, after all.\"\n\n\"Yes, they do. It isn't just so much a year they want, though those\nwho have that won't like to part with it. But they like getting\nthe counties, and the Garters, and the promotion in the army. They\nlike their brothers to be made bishops, and their sisters like the\nWardrobe and the Bedchamber. There isn't one of them that doesn't\nhang on somewhere,--or at least not many. Do you remember Peel's bill\nfor the Corn Laws?\"\n\n\"There were fifty went against him then,\" said Bonteen.\n\n\"And what are fifty? A man doesn't like to be one of fifty. It's\ntoo many for glory, and not enough for strength. There has come up\namong them a general feeling that it's just as well to let things\nslide,--as the Yankees say. They're down-hearted about it enough\nwithin their own houses, no doubt. But what can they do, if they hold\nback? Some stout old cavalier here and there may shut himself up in\nhis own castle, and tell himself that the world around him may go to\nwrack and ruin, but that he will not help the evil work. Some are\nshutting themselves up. Look at old Quin, when they carried their\nReform Bill. But men, as a rule, don't like to be shut up. How they\nreconcile it to their conscience,--that's what I can't understand.\"\nSuch was the wisdom, and such were the fears of Mr. Ratler. Mr.\nBonteen, however, could not bring himself to believe that the\nArch-enemy would on this occasion be successful. \"It mayn't be too\nhot for him,\" said Mr. Bonteen, when he reviewed the whole matter,\n\"but I think it'll be too heavy.\"\n\nThey who had mounted higher than Mr. Ratler and Mr. Bonteen on the\npolitical ladder, but who had mounted on the same side, were no\nless astonished than their inferiors; and, perhaps, were equally\ndisgusted, though they did not allow themselves to express their\ndisgust as plainly. Mr. Gresham was staying in the country with his\nfriend, Lord Cantrip, when the tidings reached them of Mr. Daubeny's\nspeech to the electors of East Barsetshire. Mr. Gresham and Lord\nCantrip had long sat in the same Cabinet, and were fast friends,\nunderstanding each other's views, and thoroughly trusting each\nother's loyalty. \"He means it,\" said Lord Cantrip.\n\n\"He means to see if it be possible,\" said the other. \"It is thrown\nout as a feeler to his own party.\"\n\n\"I'll do him the justice of saying that he's not afraid of his party.\nIf he means it, he means it altogether, and will not retract it, even\nthough the party should refuse as a body to support him. I give him\nno other credit, but I give him that.\"\n\nMr. Gresham paused for a few moments before he answered. \"I do not\nknow,\" said he, \"whether we are justified in thinking that one man\nwill always be the same. Daubeny has once been very audacious, and he\nsucceeded. But he had two things to help him,--a leader, who, though\nthoroughly trusted, was very idle, and an ill-defined question. When\nhe had won his leader he had won his party. He has no such tower of\nstrength now. And in the doing of this thing, if he means to do it,\nhe must encounter the assured conviction of every man on his own\nside, both in the upper and lower House. When he told them that he\nwould tap a Conservative element by reducing the suffrage they did\nnot know whether to believe him or not. There might be something\nin it. It might be that they would thus resume a class of suffrage\nexisting in former days, but which had fallen into abeyance, because\nnot properly protected. They could teach themselves to believe that\nit might be so, and those among them who found it necessary to free\ntheir souls did so teach themselves. I don't see how they are to free\ntheir souls when they are invited to put down the State establishment\nof the Church.\"\n\n\"He'll find a way for them.\"\n\n\"It's possible. I'm the last man in the world to contest the\npossibility, or even the expediency, of changes in political opinion.\nBut I do not know whether it follows that because he was brave and\nsuccessful once he must necessarily be brave and successful again. A\nman rides at some outrageous fence, and by the wonderful activity and\nobedient zeal of his horse is carried over it in safety. It does not\nfollow that his horse will carry him over a house, or that he should\nbe fool enough to ask the beast to do so.\"\n\n\"He intends to ride at the house,\" said Lord Cantrip; \"and he means\nit because others have talked of it. You saw the line which my rash\nyoung friend Finn took at Tankerville.\"\n\n\"And all for nothing.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that. They say he is like the rest. If Daubeny\ndoes carry the party with him, I suppose the days of the Church are\nnumbered.\"\n\n\"And what if they be?\" Mr. Gresham almost sighed as he said this,\nalthough he intended to express a certain amount of satisfaction.\n\"What if they be? You know, and I know, that the thing has to be\ndone. Whatever may be our own individual feelings, or even our\npresent judgment on the subject,--as to which neither of us can\nperhaps say that his mind is not so made up that it may not soon\nbe altered,--we know that the present union cannot remain. It is\nunfitted for that condition of humanity to which we are coming, and\nif so, the change must be for good. Why should not he do it as well\nas another? Or rather would not he do it better than another, if he\ncan do it with less of animosity than we should rouse against us? If\nthe blow would come softer from his hands than from ours, with less\nof a feeling of injury to those who dearly love the Church, should we\nnot be glad that he should undertake the task?\"\n\n\"Then you will not oppose him?\"\n\n\"Ah;--there is much to be considered before we can say that. Though\nhe may not be bound by his friends, we may be bound by ours. And\nthen, though I can hint to you at a certain condition of mind,\nand can sympathise with you, feeling that such may become the\ncondition of your mind, I cannot say that I should act upon it as an\nestablished conviction, or that I can expect that you will do so. If\nsuch be the political programme submitted to us when the House meets,\nthen we must be prepared.\"\n\nLord Cantrip also paused a moment before he answered, but he had his\nanswer ready. \"I can frankly say that I should follow your leading,\nbut that I should give my voice for opposition.\"\n\n\"Your voice is always persuasive,\" said Mr. Gresham.\n\nBut the consternation felt among Mr. Daubeny's friends was infinitely\ngreater than that which fell among his enemies, when those wonderful\nwords were read, discussed, criticised, and explained. It seemed to\nevery clergyman in England that nothing short of disestablishment\ncould be intended by them. And this was the man to whom they had\nall looked for protection! This was the bulwark of the Church, to\nwhom they had trusted! This was the hero who had been so sound and\nso firm respecting the Irish Establishment, when evil counsels\nhad been allowed to prevail in regard to that ill-used but still\nsacred vineyard! All friends of the Church had then whispered\namong themselves fearfully, and had, with sad looks and grievous\nforebodings, acknowledged that the thin edge of the wedge had been\ndriven into the very rock of the Establishment. The enemies of\nthe Church were known to be powerful, numerous, and of course\nunscrupulous. But surely this Brutus would not raise a dagger against\nthis C\u00c3\u00a6sar! And yet, if not, what was the meaning of those words?\nAnd then men and women began to tell each other,--the men and women\nwho are the very salt of the earth in this England of ours,--that\ntheir Brutus, in spite of his great qualities, had ever been\nmysterious, unintelligible, dangerous, and given to feats of\nconjuring. They had only been too submissive to their Brutus.\nWonderful feats of conjuring they had endured, understanding nothing\nof the manner in which they were performed,--nothing of their\nprobable results; but this feat of conjuring they would not endure.\nAnd so there were many meetings held about the country, though the\ntime for combined action was very short.\n\nNothing more audacious than the speaking of those few words to the\nbucolic electors of East Barsetshire had ever been done in the\npolitical history of England. Cromwell was bold when he closed the\nLong Parliament. Shaftesbury was bold when he formed the plot for\nwhich Lord Russell and others suffered. Walpole was bold when, in\nhis lust for power, he discarded one political friend after another.\nAnd Peel was bold when he resolved to repeal the Corn Laws. But in\nnone of these instances was the audacity displayed more wonderful\nthan when Mr. Daubeny took upon himself to make known throughout\nthe country his intention of abolishing the Church of England. For\nto such a declaration did those few words amount. He was now the\nrecognised parliamentary leader of that party to which the Church\nof England was essentially dear. He had achieved his place by skill,\nrather than principle,--by the conviction on men's minds that he was\nnecessary rather than that he was fit. But still, there he was; and,\nthough he had alarmed many,--had, probably, alarmed all those who\nfollowed him by his eccentric and dangerous mode of carrying on the\nbattle; though no Conservative regarded him as safe; yet on this\nquestion of the Church it had been believed that he was sound. What\nmight be the special ideas of his own mind regarding ecclesiastical\npolicy in general, it had not been thought necessary to consider.\nHis utterances had been confusing, mysterious, and perhaps purposely\nunintelligible; but that was matter of little moment so long as he\nwas prepared to defend the establishment of the Church of England\nas an institution adapted for English purposes. On that point it\nwas believed that he was sound. To that mast it was supposed he had\nnailed his own colours and those of his party. In defending that\nfortress it was thought that he would be ready to fall, should the\ndefence of it require a fall. It was because he was so far safe that\nhe was there. And yet he spoke these words without consulting a\nsingle friend, or suggesting the propriety of his new scheme to a\nsingle supporter. And he knew what he was doing. This was the way in\nwhich he had thought it best to make known to his own followers, not\nonly that he was about to abandon the old Institution, but that they\nmust do so too!\n\nAs regarded East Barsetshire itself, he was returned, and f\u00c3\u00aated, and\nsent home with his ears stuffed with eulogy, before the bucolic mind\nhad discovered his purpose. On so much he had probably calculated.\nBut he had calculated also that after an interval of three or four\ndays his secret would be known to all friends and enemies. On the day\nafter his speech came the report of it in the newspapers; on the next\nday the leading articles, in which the world was told what it was\nthat the Prime Minister had really said. Then, on the following day,\nthe startled parsons, and the startled squires and farmers, and,\nabove all, the startled peers and members of the Lower House, whose\nduty it was to vote as he should lead them, were all agog. Could it\nbe that the newspapers were right in this meaning which they had\nattached to these words? On the day week after the election in East\nBarsetshire, a Cabinet Council was called in London, at which it\nwould, of course, be Mr. Daubeny's duty to explain to his colleagues\nwhat it was that he did purpose to do.\n\nIn the meantime he saw a colleague or two.\n\n\"Let us look it straight in the face,\" he said to a noble colleague;\n\"we must look it in the face before long.\"\n\n\"But we need not hurry it forward.\"\n\n\"There is a storm coming. We knew that before, and we heard the sound\nof it from every husting in the country. How shall we rule the storm\nso that it may pass over the land without devastating it? If we bring\nin a bill--\"\n\n\"A bill for disestablishing the Church!\" said the horror-stricken\nlord.\n\n\"If we bring in a bill, the purport of which shall be to moderate the\nascendancy of the Church in accordance with the existing religious\nfeelings of the population, we shall save much that otherwise must\nfall. If there must be a bill, would you rather that it should be\nmodelled by us who love the Church, or by those who hate it?\"\n\nThat lord was very wrath, and told the right honourable gentleman\nto his face that his duty to his party should have constrained him\nto silence on that subject till he had consulted his colleagues. In\nanswer to this Mr. Daubeny said with much dignity that, should such\nbe the opinion of his colleagues in general, he would at once abandon\nthe high place which he held in their councils. But he trusted that\nit might be otherwise. He had felt himself bound to communicate his\nideas to his constituents, and had known that in doing so some minds\nmust be shocked. He trusted that he might be able to allay this\nfeeling of dismay. As regarded this noble lord, he did succeed in\nlessening the dismay before the meeting was over, though he did not\naltogether allay it.\n\nAnother gentleman who was in the habit of sitting at Mr. Daubeny's\nelbow daily in the House of Commons was much gentler with him, both\nas to words and manner. \"It's a bold throw, but I'm afraid it won't\ncome up sixes,\" said the right honourable gentleman.\n\n\"Let it come up fives, then. It's the only chance we have; and if\nyou think, as I do, that it is essentially necessary for the welfare\nof the country that we should remain where we are, we must run the\nrisk.\"\n\nWith another colleague, whose mind was really set on that which\nthe Church is presumed to represent, he used another argument.\n\"I am convinced at any rate of this,\" said Mr. Daubeny; \"that by\nsacrificing something of that ascendancy which the Establishment is\nsupposed to give us, we can bring the Church, which we love, nearer\nto the wants of the people.\" And so it came about that before the\nCabinet met, every member of it knew what it was that was expected\nof him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nPHINEAS AND HIS OLD FRIENDS.\n\n\nPhineas Finn returned from Tankerville to London in much better\nspirits than those which had accompanied him on his journey thither.\nHe was not elected; but then, before the election, he had come to\nbelieve that it was quite out of the question that he should be\nelected. And now he did think it probable that he should get the seat\non a petition. A scrutiny used to be a very expensive business, but\nunder the existing law, made as the scrutiny would be in the borough\nitself, it would cost but little; and that little, should he be\nsuccessful, would fall on the shoulders of Mr. Browborough. Should he\nknock off eight votes and lose none himself, he would be member for\nTankerville. He knew that many votes had been given for Browborough\nwhich, if the truth were known of them, would be knocked off; and he\ndid not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which\nhe had been supported. But, unfortunately, the judge by whom all this\nwould be decided might not reach Tankerville in his travels till\nafter Christmas, perhaps not till after Easter; and in the meantime,\nwhat should he do with himself?\n\nAs for going back to Dublin, that was now out of the question. He had\nentered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible\nthat he should live in Ireland. Should he ultimately fail in regard\nto his seat he must--vanish out of the world. While he remained in his\npresent condition he would not even endeavour to think how he might\nin such case best bestow himself. For the present he would remain\nwithin the region of politics, and live as near as he could to the\nwhirl of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him. Of one club\nhe had always remained a member, and he had already been re-elected\na member of the Reform. So he took up his residence once more at the\nhouse of a certain Mr. and Mrs. Bunce, in Great Marlborough Street,\nwith whom he had lodged when he first became a member of Parliament.\n\n\"So you're at the old game, Mr. Finn?\" said his landlord.\n\n\"Yes; at the old game. I suppose it's the same with you?\" Now Mr.\nBunce had been a very violent politician, and used to rejoice in\ncalling himself a Democrat.\n\n\"Pretty much the same, Mr. Finn. I don't see that things are much\nbetter than they used to be. They tell me at the People's Banner\noffice that the lords have had as much to do with this election as\nwith any that ever went before it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they don't know much about it at the People's Banner office.\nI thought Mr. Slide and the People's Banner had gone over to the\nother side, Bunce?\"\n\n\"Mr. Slide is pretty wide-awake whatever side he's on. Not but what\nhe's disgraced himself by what he's been and done now.\" Mr. Slide\nin former days had been the editor of the People's Banner, and\ncircumstances had arisen in consequence of which there had been some\nacquaintance between him and our hero. \"I see you was hammering away\nat the Church down at Tankerville.\"\n\n\"I just said a word or two.\"\n\n\"You was all right, there, Mr. Finn. I can't say as I ever saw very\nmuch in your religion; but what a man keeps in the way of religion\nfor his own use is never nothing to me;--as what I keeps is nothing\nto him.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't keep much, Mr. Bunce.\"\n\n\"And that's nothing to you, neither, is it, sir?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"But when we read of Churches as is called State Churches,--Churches\nas have bishops you and I have to pay for, as never goes into them--\"\n\n\"But we don't pay the bishops, Mr. Bunce.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, we do; because, if they wasn't paid, the money would come to\nus to do as we pleased with it. We proved all that when we pared them\ndown a bit. What's an Ecclesiastical Commission? Only another name\nfor a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again.\nWhen we hear of Churches such as these, as is not kept up by the\npeople who uses them,--just as the theatres are, Mr. Finn, or the gin\nshops,--then I know there's a deal more to be done before honest men\ncan come by their own. You're right enough, Mr. Finn, you are, as far\nas churches go, and you was right, too, when you cut and run off the\nTreasury Bench. I hope you ain't going to sit on that stool again.\"\n\nMr. Bunce was a privileged person, and Mrs. Bunce made up for his\napparent rudeness by her own affectionate cordiality. \"Deary me,\nand isn't it a thing for sore eyes to have you back again! I never\nexpected this. But I'll do for you, Mr. Finn, just as I ever did in\nthe old days; and it was I that was sorry when I heard of the poor\nyoung lady's death; so I was, Mr. Finn; well, then, I won't mention\nher name never again. But after all there's been betwixt you and us\nit wouldn't be natural to pass it by without one word; would it, Mr.\nFinn? Well, yes; he's just the same man as ever, without a ha'porth\nof difference. He's gone on paying that shilling to the Union every\nweek of his life, just as he used to do; and never got so much out\nof it, not as a junketing into the country. That he didn't. It makes\nme that sick sometimes when I think of where it's gone to, that I\ndon't know how to bear it. Well, yes; that is true, Mr. Finn. There\nnever was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than\nBunce, barring that shilling. If he'd drink it, which he never does,\nI think I'd bear it better than give it to that nasty Union. And\nyoung Jack writes as well as his father, pretty nigh, Mr. Finn,\nwhich is a comfort,\"--Mr. Bunce was a journeyman scrivener at a law\nstationer's,--\"and keeps his self; but he don't bring home his money,\nnor yet it can't be expected, Mr. Finn. I know what the young 'uns\nwill do, and what they won't. And Mary Jane is quite handy about the\nhouse now,--only she do break things, which is an aggravation; and\nthe hot water shall be always up at eight o'clock to a minute, if I\nbring it with my own hand, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Well, then, I won't mention her name again.\"]\n\n\nAnd so he was established once more in his old rooms in Great\nMarlborough Street; and as he sat back in the arm-chair, which he\nused to know so well, a hundred memories of former days crowded back\nupon him. Lord Chiltern for a few months had lived with him; and then\nthere had arisen a quarrel, which he had for a time thought would\ndissolve his old life into ruin. Now Lord Chiltern was again his\nvery intimate friend. And there had used to sit a needy money-lender\nwhom he had been unable to banish. Alas! alas! how soon might he now\nrequire that money-lender's services! And then he recollected how he\nhad left these rooms to go into others, grander and more appropriate\nto his life when he had filled high office under the State. Would\nthere ever again come to him such cause for migration? And would he\nagain be able to load the frame of the looking-glass over the fire\nwith countless cards from Countesses and Ministers' wives? He had\nopened the oyster for himself once, though it had closed again with\nso sharp a snap when the point of his knife had been withdrawn. Would\nhe be able to insert the point again between those two difficult\nshells? Would the Countesses once more be kind to him? Would\ndrawing-rooms be opened to him, and sometimes opened to him and to\nno other? Then he thought of certain special drawing-rooms in which\nwonderful things had been said to him. Since that he had been a\nmarried man, and those special drawing-rooms and those wonderful\nwords had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife. He had\nleft all those things of his own free will, as though telling himself\nthat there was a better life than they offered to him. But was he\nsure that he had found it to be better? He had certainly sighed for\nthe gauds which he had left. While his young wife was living he had\nkept his sighs down, so that she should not hear them; but he had\nbeen forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and\nflavourless. Now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts.\nWould the Countesses' cards be showered upon him again?\n\nOne card, or rather note, had reached him while he was yet at\nTankerville, reminding him of old days. It was from Mrs. Low, the\nwife of the barrister with whom he had worked when he had been a\nlaw student in London. She had asked him to come and dine with them\nafter the old fashion in Baker Street, naming a day as to which she\npresumed that he would by that time have finished his affairs at\nTankerville, intimating also that Mr. Low would then have finished\nhis at North Broughton. Now Mr. Low had sat for North Broughton\nbefore Phineas left London, and his wife spoke of the seat as a\ncertainty. Phineas could not keep himself from feeling that Mrs. Low\nintended to triumph over him; but, nevertheless, he accepted the\ninvitation. They were very glad to see him, explaining that, as\nnobody was supposed to be in town, nobody had been asked to meet\nhim. In former days he had been very intimate in that house, having\nreceived from both of them much kindness, mingled, perhaps, with some\ntouch of severity on the part of the lady. But the ground for that\nwas gone, and Mrs. Low was no longer painfully severe. A few words\nwere said as to his great loss. Mrs. Low once raised her eyebrows in\npretended surprise when Phineas explained that he had thrown up his\nplace, and then they settled down on the question of the day. \"And\nso,\" said Mrs. Low, \"you've begun to attack the Church?\" It must be\nremembered that at this moment Mr. Daubeny had not as yet electrified\nthe minds of East Barsetshire, and that, therefore, Mrs. Low was not\ndisturbed. To Mrs. Low, Church and State was the very breath of her\nnostrils; and if her husband could not be said to live by means of\nthe same atmosphere it was because the breath of his nostrils had\nbeen drawn chiefly in the Vice-Chancellor's Court in Lincoln's Inn.\nBut he, no doubt, would be very much disturbed indeed should he ever\nbe told that he was required, as an expectant member of Mr. Daubeny's\nparty, to vote for the Disestablishment of the Church of England.\n\n\"You don't mean that I am guilty of throwing the first stone?\" said\nPhineas.\n\n\"They have been throwing stones at the Temple since first it was\nbuilt,\" said Mrs. Low, with energy; \"but they have fallen off its\npolished shafts in dust and fragments.\" I am afraid that Mrs. Low,\nwhen she allowed herself to speak thus energetically, entertained\nsome confused idea that the Church of England and the Christian\nreligion were one and the same thing, or, at least, that they had\nbeen brought into the world together.\n\n\"You haven't thrown the first stone,\" said Mr. Low; \"but you have\ntaken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"No stones can be dangerous,\" said Mrs. Low.\n\n\"The idea of a State Church,\" said Phineas, \"is opposed to my theory\nof political progress. What I hope is that my friends will not\nsuppose that I attack the Protestant Church because I am a Roman\nCatholic. If I were a priest it would be my business to do so; but\nI am not a priest.\"\n\nMr. Low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine, and in all\nfriendly observances treated him with due affection. But neither did\nhe nor did his wife for a moment abstain from attacking their guest\nin respect to his speeches at Tankerville. It seemed, indeed, to\nPhineas that as Mrs. Low was buckled up in such triple armour that\nshe feared nothing, she might have been less loud in expressing her\nabhorrence of the enemies of the Church. If she feared nothing,\nwhy should she scream so loudly? Between the two he was a good\ndeal crushed and confounded, and Mrs. Low was very triumphant when\nshe allowed him to escape from her hands at ten o'clock. But, at\nthat moment, nothing had as yet been heard in Baker Street of Mr.\nDaubeny's proposition to the electors of East Barsetshire! Poor Mrs.\nLow! We can foresee that there is much grief in store for her, and\nsome rocks ahead, too, in the political career of her husband.\n\nPhineas was still in London, hanging about the clubs, doing nothing,\ndiscussing Mr. Daubeny's wonderful treachery with such men as came up\nto town, and waiting for the meeting of Parliament, when he received\nthe following letter from Lady Laura Kennedy:--\n\n\n   Dresden, November 18, ----.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,\n\n   I have heard with great pleasure from my sister-in-law\n   that you have been staying with them at Harrington Hall.\n   It seems so like old days that you and Oswald and Violet\n   should be together,--so much more natural than that you\n   should be living in Dublin. I cannot conceive of you as\n   living any other life than that of the House of Commons,\n   Downing Street, and the clubs. Nor do I wish to do so. And\n   when I hear of you at Harrington Hall I know that you are\n   on your way to the other things.\n\n   Do tell me what life is like with Oswald and Violet. Of\n   course he never writes. He is one of those men who, on\n   marrying, assume that they have at last got a person to do\n   a duty which has always hitherto been neglected. Violet\n   does write, but tells me little or nothing of themselves.\n   Her letters are very nice, full of anecdote, well\n   written,--letters that are fit to be kept and printed;\n   but they are never family letters. She is inimitable in\n   discussing the miseries of her own position as the wife\n   of a Master of Hounds; but the miseries are as evidently\n   fictitious as the art is real. She told me how poor dear\n   Lady Baldock communicated to you her unhappiness about her\n   daughter in a manner that made even me laugh; and would\n   make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be\n   published. But of her inside life, of her baby, or of her\n   husband as a husband, she never says a word. You will have\n   seen it all, and have enough of the feminine side of a\n   man's character to be able to tell me how they are living.\n   I am sure they are happy together, because Violet has more\n   common sense than any woman I ever knew.\n\n   And pray tell me about the affair at Tankerville. My\n   cousin Barrington writes me word that you will certainly\n   get the seat. He declares that Mr. Browborough is almost\n   disposed not to fight the battle, though a man more\n   disposed to fight never bribed an elector. But Barrington\n   seems to think that you managed as well as you did by\n   getting outside the traces, as he calls it. We certainly\n   did not think that you would come out strong against the\n   Church. Don't suppose that I complain. For myself I hate\n   to think of the coming severance; but if it must come, why\n   not by your hands as well as by any other? It is hardly\n   possible that you in your heart should love a Protestant\n   ascendant Church. But, as Barrington says, a horse won't\n   get oats unless he works steady between the traces.\n\n   As to myself, what am I to say to you? I and my father\n   live here a sad, sombre, solitary life, together. We have\n   a large furnished house outside the town, with a pleasant\n   view and a pretty garden. He does--nothing. He reads the\n   English papers, and talks of English parties, is driven\n   out, and eats his dinner, and sleeps. At home, as you\n   know, not only did he take an active part in politics, but\n   he was active also in the management of his own property.\n   Now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to\n   write a letter to his steward; and all this has come upon\n   him because of me. He is here because he cannot bear that\n   I should live alone. I have offered to return with him to\n   Saulsby, thinking that Mr. Kennedy would trouble me no\n   further,--or to remain here by myself; but he will consent\n   to neither. In truth the burden of idleness has now fallen\n   upon him so heavily that he cannot shake it off. He dreads\n   that he may be called upon to do anything.\n\n   To me it is all one tragedy. I cannot but think of things\n   as they were two or three years since. My father and my\n   husband were both in the Cabinet, and you, young as you\n   were, stood but one step below it. Oswald was out in the\n   cold. He was very poor. Papa thought all evil of him.\n   Violet had refused him over and over again. He quarrelled\n   with you, and all the world seemed against him. Then of a\n   sudden you vanished, and we vanished. An ineffable misery\n   fell upon me and upon my wretched husband. All our good\n   things went from us at a blow. I and my poor father became\n   as it were outcasts. But Oswald suddenly retricked his\n   beams, and is flaming in the forehead of the morning sky.\n   He, I believe, has no more than he has deserved. He won\n   his wife honestly;--did he not? And he has ever been\n   honest. It is my pride to think I never gave him up. But\n   the bitter part of my cup consists in this,--that as he\n   has won what he has deserved, so have we. I complain of no\n   injustice. Our castle was built upon the sand. Why should\n   Mr. Kennedy have been a Cabinet Minister;--and why should\n   I have been his wife? There is no one else of whom I can\n   ask that question as I can of you, and no one else who can\n   answer it as you can do.\n\n   Of Mr. Kennedy it is singular how little I know, and how\n   little I ever hear. There is no one whom I can ask to tell\n   me of him. That he did not attend during the last Session\n   I do know, and we presume that he has now abandoned his\n   seat. I fear that his health is bad,--or perhaps, worse\n   still, that his mind is affected by the gloom of his life.\n   I suppose that he lives exclusively at Loughlinter. From\n   time to time I am implored by him to return to my duty\n   beneath his roof. He grounds his demand on no affection of\n   his own, on no presumption that any affection can remain\n   with me. He says no word of happiness. He offers no\n   comfort. He does not attempt to persuade with promises of\n   future care. He makes his claim simply on Holy Writ, and\n   on the feeling of duty which thence ought to weigh upon\n   me. He has never even told me that he loves me; but he is\n   persistent in declaring that those whom God has joined\n   together nothing human should separate. Since I have been\n   here I have written to him once,--one sad, long, weary\n   letter. Since that I am constrained to leave his letters\n   unanswered.\n\n   And now, my friend, could you not do for me a great\n   kindness? For a while, till the inquiry be made at\n   Tankerville, your time must be vacant. Cannot you come and\n   see us? I have told Papa that I should ask you, and he\n   would be delighted. I cannot explain to you what it would\n   be to me to be able to talk again to one who knows all\n   the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do.\n   Dresden is very cold in the winter. I do not know whether\n   you would mind that. We are very particular about the\n   rooms, but my father bears the temperature wonderfully\n   well, though he complains. In March we move down south\n   for a couple of months. Do come if you can.\n\n   Most sincerely yours,\n\n   LAURA KENNEDY.\n\n   If you come, of course you will have yourself brought\n   direct to us. If you can learn anything of Mr. Kennedy's\n   life, and of his real condition, pray do. The faint\n   rumours which reach me are painfully distressing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nCOMING HOME FROM HUNTING.\n\n\nLady Chiltern was probably right when she declared that her husband\nmust have been made to be a Master of Hounds,--presuming it to be\ngranted that somebody must be Master of Hounds. Such necessity\ncertainly does exist in this, the present condition of England.\nHunting prevails; hunting men increase in numbers; foxes are\npreserved; farmers do not rebel; owners of coverts, even when they\nare not hunting men themselves, acknowledge the fact, and do not dare\nto maintain their pheasants at the expense of the much better-loved\nfour-footed animal. Hounds are bred, and horses are trained specially\nto the work. A master of fox hounds is a necessity of the period.\nAllowing so much, we cannot but allow also that Lord Chiltern must\nhave been made to fill the situation. He understood hunting, and,\nperhaps, there was nothing else requiring acute intelligence that he\ndid understand. And he understood hunting, not only as a huntsman\nunderstands it,--in that branch of the science which refers simply to\nthe judicious pursuit of the fox, being probably inferior to his own\nhuntsman in that respect,--but he knew exactly what men should do,\nand what they should not. In regard to all those various interests\nwith which he was brought in contact, he knew when to hold fast to\nhis own claims, and when to make no claims at all. He was afraid of\nno one, but he was possessed of a sense of justice which induced him\nto acknowledge the rights of those around him. When he found that the\nearths were not stopped in Trumpeton Wood,--from which he judged that\nthe keeper would complain that the hounds would not or could not kill\nany of the cubs found there,--he wrote in very round terms to the\nDuke who owned it. If His Grace did not want to have the wood drawn,\nlet him say so. If he did, let him have the earths stopped. But when\nthat great question came up as to the Gartlow coverts--when that\nuncommonly disagreeable gentleman, Mr. Smith, of Gartlow, gave notice\nthat the hounds should not be admitted into his place at all,--Lord\nChiltern soon put the whole matter straight by taking part with the\ndisagreeable gentleman. The disagreeable gentleman had been ill\nused. Men had ridden among his young laurels. If gentlemen who did\nhunt,--so said Lord Chiltern to his own supporters,--did not know\nhow to conduct themselves in a matter of hunting, how was it to be\nexpected that a gentleman who did not hunt should do so? On this\noccasion Lord Chiltern rated his own hunt so roundly that Mr. Smith\nand he were quite in a bond together, and the Gartlow coverts were\nre-opened. Now all the world knows that the Gartlow coverts, though\nsmall, are material as being in the very centre of the Brake country.\n\nIt is essential that a Master of Hounds should be somewhat feared by\nthe men who ride with him. There should be much awe mixed with the\nlove felt for him. He should be a man with whom other men will not\ncare to argue; an irrational, cut and thrust, unscrupulous, but yet\ndistinctly honest man; one who can be tyrannical, but will tyrannise\nonly over the evil spirits; a man capable of intense cruelty to those\nalongside of him, but who will know whether his victim does in truth\ndeserve scalping before he draws his knife. He should be savage and\nyet good-humoured; severe and yet forbearing; truculent and pleasant\nin the same moment. He should exercise unflinching authority, but\nshould do so with the consciousness that he can support it only by\nhis own popularity. His speech should be short, incisive, always\nto the point, but never founded on argument. His rules are based\non no reason, and will never bear discussion. He must be the most\ncandid of men, also the most close;--and yet never a hypocrite. He\nmust condescend to no explanation, and yet must impress men with an\nassurance that his decisions will certainly be right. He must rule\nall as though no man's special welfare were of any account, and yet\nmust administer all so as to offend none. Friends he must have, but\nnot favourites. He must be self-sacrificing, diligent, eager, and\nwatchful. He must be strong in health, strong in heart, strong in\npurpose, and strong in purse. He must be economical and yet lavish;\ngenerous as the wind and yet obdurate as the frost. He should be\nassured that of all human pursuits hunting is the best, and that of\nall living things a fox is the most valuable. He must so train his\nheart as to feel for the fox a mingled tenderness and cruelty which\nis inexplicable to ordinary men and women. His desire to preserve the\nbrute and then to kill him should be equally intense and passionate.\nAnd he should do it all in accordance with a code of unwritten laws,\nwhich cannot be learnt without profound study. It may not perhaps be\ntruly asserted that Lord Chiltern answered this description in every\ndetail; but he combined so many of the qualities required that his\nwife showed her discernment when she declared that he seemed to have\nbeen made to be a Master of Hounds.\n\nEarly in that November he was riding home with Miss Palliser by his\nside, while the huntsmen and whips were trotting on with the hounds\nbefore him. \"You call that a good run, don't you?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Adelaide Palliser.]\n\n\n\"No; I don't.\"\n\n\"What was the matter with it? I declare it seems to me that something\nis always wrong. Men like hunting better than anything else, and yet\nI never find any man contented.\"\n\n\"In the first place we didn't kill.\"\n\n\"You know you're short of foxes at Gartlow,\" said Miss Palliser, who,\nas is the manner with all hunting ladies, liked to show that she\nunderstood the affairs of the hunt.\n\n\"If I knew there were but one fox in a county, and I got upon that\none fox, I would like to kill that one fox,--barring a vixen in\nMarch.\"\n\n\"I thought it very nice. It was fast enough for anybody.\"\n\n\"You might go as fast with a drag, if that's all. I'll tell you\nsomething else. We should have killed him if Maule hadn't once ridden\nover the hounds when we came out of the little wood. I spoke very\nsharply to him.\"\n\n\"I heard you, Lord Chiltern.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you thought I was a brute.\"\n\n\"Who? I? No, I didn't;--not particularly, you know. Men do say such\nthings to each other!\"\n\n\"He doesn't mind it, I fancy.\"\n\n\"I suppose a man does not like to be told that directly he shows\nhimself in a run the sport is all over and the hounds ought to be\ntaken home.\"\n\n\"Did I say that? I don't remember now what I said, but I know he made\nme angry. Come, let us trot on. They can take the hounds home without\nus.\"\n\n\"Good night, Cox,\" said Miss Palliser, as they passed by the pack.\n\"Poor Mr. Maule! I did pity him, and I do think he does care for\nit, though he is so impassive. He would be with us now, only he is\nchewing the cud of his unhappiness in solitude half a mile behind\nus.\"\n\n\"That is hard upon you.\"\n\n\"Hard upon me, Lord Chiltern! It is hard upon him, and, perhaps, upon\nyou. Why should it be hard upon me?\"\n\n\"Hard upon him, I should have said. Though why it shouldn't be the\nother way I don't know. He's a friend of yours.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And an especial friend, I suppose. As a matter of course Violet\ntalks to me about you both.\"\n\n\"No doubt she does. When once a woman is married she should be\nregarded as having thrown off her allegiance to her own sex. She is\nsure to be treacherous at any rate in one direction. Not that Lady\nChiltern can tell anything of me that might not be told to all the\nworld as far as I am concerned.\"\n\n\"There is nothing in it, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Honour bright?\"\n\n\"Oh,--honour as bright as it ever is in such matters as these.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that,--very sorry.\"\n\n\"Why so, Lord Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Because if you were engaged to him I thought that perhaps you might\nhave induced him to ride a little less forward.\"\n\n\"Lord Chiltern,\" said Miss Palliser, seriously; \"I will never again\nspeak to you a word on any subject except hunting.\"\n\nAt this moment Gerard Maule came up behind them, with a cigar in his\nmouth, apparently quite unconscious of any of that displeasure as\nto which Miss Palliser had supposed that he was chewing the cud in\nsolitude. \"That was a goodish thing, Chiltern,\" he said.\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"And the hounds hunted him well to the end.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"It's odd how the scent will die away at a moment. You see they\ncouldn't carry on a field after we got out of the copse.\"\n\n\"Not a field.\"\n\n\"Considering all things I am glad we didn't kill him.\"\n\n\"Uncommon glad,\" said Lord Chiltern. Then they trotted on in silence\na little way, and Maule again dropped behind. \"I'm blessed if he\nknows that I spoke to him, roughly,\" said Chiltern. \"He's deaf, I\nthink, when he chooses to be.\"\n\n\"You're not sorry, Lord Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Nothing will ever do any good. As for offending\nhim, you might as well swear at a tree, and think to offend it.\nThere's comfort in that, anyway. I wonder whether he'd talk to you if\nI went away?\"\n\n\"I hope that you won't try the experiment.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he would, or I'd go at once. I wonder whether you\nreally do care for him?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Or he for you.\"\n\n\"Quite indifferent, I should say; but I can't answer for him, Lord\nChiltern, quite as positively as I can for myself. You know, as\nthings go, people have to play at caring for each other.\"\n\n\"That's what we call flirting.\"\n\n\"Just the reverse. Flirting I take to be the excitement of love,\nwithout its reality, and without its ordinary result in marriage.\nThis playing at caring has none of the excitement, but it often\nleads to the result, and sometimes ends in downright affection.\"\n\n\"If Maule perseveres then you'll take him, and by-and-bye you'll come\nto like him.\"\n\n\"In twenty years it might come to that, if we were always to live in\nthe same house; but as he leaves Harrington to-morrow, and we may\nprobably not meet each other for the next four years, I think the\nchance is small.\"\n\nThen Maule trotted up again, and after riding in silence with the\nother two for half an hour, he pulled out his case and lit a fresh\ncigar from the end of the old one, which he threw away. \"Have a\nbaccy, Chiltern?\" he said.\n\n\"No, thank you, I never smoke going home; my mind is too full. I've\nall that family behind to think of, and I'm generally out of sorts\nwith the miseries of the day. I must say another word to Cox, or I\nshould have to go to the kennels on my way home.\" And so he dropped\nbehind.\n\nGerard Maule smoked half his cigar before he spoke a word, and Miss\nPalliser was quite resolved that she would not open her mouth till he\nhad spoken. \"I suppose he likes it?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Who likes what, Mr. Maule?\"\n\n\"Chiltern likes blowing fellows up.\"\n\n\"It's a part of his business.\"\n\n\"That's the way I look at it. But I should think it must be\ndisagreeable. He takes such a deal of trouble about it. I heard him\ngoing on to-day to some one as though his whole soul depended on it.\"\n\n\"He is very energetic.\"\n\n\"Just so. I'm quite sure it's a mistake. What does a man ever get by\nit? Folks around you soon discount it till it goes for nothing.\"\n\n\"I don't think energy goes for nothing, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"A bull in a china shop is not a useful animal, nor is he ornamental,\nbut there can be no doubt of his energy. The hare was full of energy,\nbut he didn't win the race. The man who stands still is the man who\nkeeps his ground.\"\n\n\"You don't stand still when you're out hunting.\"\n\n\"No;--I ride about, and Chiltern swears at me. Every man is a fool\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"And your wisdom, perfect at all other times, breaks down in the\nhunting-field?\"\n\n\"I don't in the least mind your chaffing. I know what you think of me\njust as well as though you told me.\"\n\n\"What do I think of you?\"\n\n\"That I'm a poor creature, generally half asleep, shallow-pated,\nslow-blooded, ignorant, useless, and unambitious.\"\n\n\"Certainly unambitious, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"And that word carries all the others. What's the good of ambition?\nThere's the man they were talking about last night,--that Irishman.\"\n\n\"Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Yes; Phineas Finn. He is an ambitious fellow. He'll have to starve,\naccording to what Chiltern was saying. I've sense enough to know I\ncan't do any good.\"\n\n\"You are sensible, I admit.\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Palliser. You can say just what you like, of course.\nYou have that privilege.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to say anything severe. I do admit that you are\nmaster of a certain philosophy, for which much may be said. But you\nare not to expect that I shall express an approval which I do not\nfeel.\"\n\n\"But I want you to approve it.\"\n\n\"Ah!--there, I fear, I cannot oblige you.\"\n\n\"I want you to approve it, though no one else may.\"\n\n\"Though all else should do so, I cannot.\"\n\n\"Then take the task of curing the sick one, and of strengthening\nthe weak one, into your own hands. If you will teach, perhaps I may\nlearn.\"\n\n\"I have no mission for teaching, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"You once said that,--that--\"\n\n\"Do not be so ungenerous as to throw in my teeth what I once\nsaid,--if I ever said a word that I would not now repeat.\"\n\n\"I do not think that I am ungenerous, Miss Palliser.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are not.\"\n\n\"Nor am I self-confident. I am obliged to seek comfort from such\nscraps of encouragement as may have fallen in my way here and there.\nI once did think that you intended to love me.\"\n\n\"Does love go by intentions?\"\n\n\"I think so,--frequently with men, and much more so with girls.\"\n\n\"It will never go so with me. I shall never intend to love any one.\nIf I ever love any man it will be because I am made to do so, despite\nmy intentions.\"\n\n\"As a fortress is taken?\"\n\n\"Well,--if you like to put it so. Only I claim this advantage,--that\nI can always get rid of my enemy when he bores me.\"\n\n\"Am I boring you now?\"\n\n\"I didn't say so. Here is Lord Chiltern again, and I know by the\nrattle of his horse's feet that something is the matter.\"\n\nLord Chiltern came up full of wrath. One of the men's horses was\nthoroughly broken down, and, as the Master said, wasn't worth the\nsaddle he carried. He didn't care a ---- for the horse, but the man\nhadn't told him. \"At this rate there won't be anything to carry\nanybody by Christmas.\"\n\n\"You'll have to buy some more,\" said Gerard Maule.\n\n\"Buy some more!\" said Lord Chiltern, turning round, and looking at\nthe man. \"He talks of buying horses as he would sugar plums!\" Then\nthey trotted in at the gate, and in two minutes were at the hall\ndoor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE ADDRESS.\n\n\nBefore the 11th of November, the day on which Parliament was to meet,\nthe whole country was in a hubbub. Consternation and triumph were\nperhaps equally predominant, and equally strong. There were those who\ndeclared that now at length was Great Britain to be ruined in actual\npresent truth; and those who asserted that, of a sudden, after a\nfashion so wholly unexpected as to be divine,--as great fires, great\nfamines, and great wars are called divine,--a mighty hand had been\nstretched out to take away the remaining incubus of superstition,\npriestcraft, and bigotry under which England had hitherto been\nlabouring. The proposed disestablishment of the State Church of\nEngland was, of course, the subject of this diversity of opinion.\n\nAnd there was not only diversity, but with it great confusion. The\npolitical feelings of the country are, as a rule, so well marked that\nit is easy, as to almost every question, to separate the sheep from\nthe goats. With but few exceptions one can tell where to look for the\nsupporters and where for the opponents of one measure or of another.\nMeetings are called in this or in that public hall to assist or to\ncombat the Minister of the day, and men know what they are about. But\nnow it was not so. It was understood that Mr. Daubeny, the accredited\nleader of the Conservatives, was about to bring in the bill, but\nno one as yet knew who would support the bill. His own party, to a\nman,--without a single exception,--were certainly opposed to the\nmeasure in their minds. It must be so. It could not but be certain\nthat they should hate it. Each individual sitting on the Conservative\nside in either House did most certainly within his own bosom cry\nIchabod when the fatal news reached his ears. But such private\nopinions and inward wailings need not, and probably would not, guide\nthe body. Ichabod had been cried before, though probably never with\nsuch intensity of feeling. Disestablishment might be worse than Free\nTrade or Household Suffrage, but was not more absolutely opposed to\nConservative convictions than had been those great measures. And yet\nthe party, as a party, had swallowed them both. To the first and\nlesser evil, a compact little body of staunch Commoners had stood\nforth in opposition,--but nothing had come of it to those true\nBritons beyond a feeling of living in the cold shade of exclusion.\nWhen the greater evil arrived, that of Household Suffrage,--a measure\nwhich twenty years since would hardly have been advocated by the\nadvanced Liberals of the day,--the Conservatives had learned to\nacknowledge the folly of clinging to their own convictions, and had\nswallowed the dose without serious disruption of their ranks. Every\nman,--with but an exception or two,--took the measure up, some with\nfaces so singularly distorted as to create true pity, some with an\nassumption of indifference, some with affected glee. But in the\ndouble process the party had become used to this mode of carrying on\nthe public service. As poor old England must go to the dogs, as the\ndoom had been pronounced against the country that it should be ruled\nby the folly of the many foolish, and not by the wisdom of the few\nwise, why should the few wise remain out in the cold,--seeing, as\nthey did, that by so doing no good would be done to the country?\nDissensions among their foes did, when properly used, give them\npower,--but such power they could only use by carrying measures which\nthey themselves believed to be ruinous. But the ruin would be as\ncertain should they abstain. Each individual might have gloried\nin standing aloof,--in hiding his face beneath his toga, and in\nremembering that Rome did once exist in her splendour. But a party\ncannot afford to hide its face in its toga. A party has to be\npractical. A party can only live by having its share of Garters,\nlord-lieutenants, bishops, and attorney-generals. Though the country\nwere ruined, the party should be supported. Hitherto the party had\nbeen supported, and had latterly enjoyed almost its share of stars\nand Garters,--thanks to the individual skill and strategy of that\ngreat English political Von Moltke Mr. Daubeny.\n\nAnd now what would the party say about the disestablishment of the\nChurch? Even a party must draw the line somewhere. It was bad to\nsacrifice things mundane; but this thing was the very Holy of Holies!\nWas nothing to be conserved by a Conservative party? What if Mr.\nDaubeny were to explain some day to the electors of East Barsetshire\nthat an hereditary peerage was an absurdity? What if in some rural\nnook of his Boeotia he should suggest in ambiguous language to the\nfarmers that a Republic was the only form of Government capable of\na logical defence? Duke had already said to Duke, and Earl to Earl,\nand Baronet to Baronet that there must be a line somewhere. Bishops\nas a rule say but little to each other, and now were afraid to\nsay anything. The Church, which had been, which was, so truly\nbeloved;--surely that must be beyond the line! And yet there crept\nthrough the very marrow of the party an agonising belief that Mr.\nDaubeny would carry the bulk of his party with him into the lobby of\nthe House of Commons.\n\nBut if such was the dismay of the Conservatives, how shall any writer\ndepict the consternation of the Liberals? If there be a feeling\nodious to the mind of a sober, hardworking man, it is the feeling\nthat the bread he has earned is to be taken out of his mouth. The\npay, the patronage, the powers, and the pleasure of Government were\nall due to the Liberals. \"God bless my soul,\" said Mr. Ratler, who\nalways saw things in a practical light, \"we have a larger fighting\nmajority than any party has had since Lord Liverpool's time. They\nhave no right to attempt it. They are bound to go out.\" \"There's\nnothing of honesty left in politics,\" said Mr. Bonteen, declaring\nthat he was sick of the life. Barrington Erle thought that the whole\nLiberal party should oppose the measure. Though they were Liberals\nthey were not democrats; nor yet infidels. But when Barrington Erle\nsaid this, the great leaders of the Liberal party had not as yet\ndecided on their ground of action.\n\nThere was much difficulty in reaching any decision. It had been\nasserted so often that the disestablishment of the Church was only a\nquestion of time, that the intelligence of the country had gradually\nso learned to regard it. Who had said so, men did not know and did\nnot inquire;--but the words were spoken everywhere. Parsons with\nsad hearts,--men who in their own parishes were enthusiastic, pure,\npious, and useful,--whispered them in the dead of the night to the\nwives of their bosoms. Bishops, who had become less pure by contact\nwith the world at clubs, shrugged their shoulders and wagged their\nheads, and remembered comfortably the sanctity of vested interests.\nStatesmen listened to them with politeness, and did not deny that\nthey were true. In the free intercourse of closest friendships the\nmatter was discussed between ex-Secretaries of State. The Press\nteemed with the assertion that it was only a question of time. Some\nfervent, credulous friends predicted another century of life;--some\nhard-hearted logical opponents thought that twenty years would put an\nend to the anomaly:--a few stout enemies had sworn on the hustings\nwith an anathema that the present Session should see the deposition\nfrom her high place of this eldest daughter of the woman of Babylon.\nBut none had expected the blow so soon as this; and none certainly\nhad expected it from this hand.\n\nBut what should the Liberal party do? Ratler was for opposing Mr.\nDaubeny with all their force, without touching the merits of the\ncase. It was no fitting work for Mr. Daubeny, and the suddenness of\nthe proposition coming from such a quarter would justify them now and\nfor ever, even though they themselves should disestablish everything\nbefore the Session were over. Barrington Erle, suffering under a real\npolitical conviction for once in his life, was desirous of a positive\nand chivalric defence of the Church. He believed in the twenty years.\nMr. Bonteen shut himself up in disgust. Things were amiss; and, as he\nthought, the evil was due to want of party zeal on the part of his\nown leader, Mr. Gresham. He did not dare to say this, lest, when\nthe house door should at last be opened, he might not be invited to\nenter with the others; but such was his conviction. \"If we were all\na little less in the abstract, and a little more in the concrete, it\nwould be better for us.\" Laurence Fitzgibbon, when these words had\nbeen whispered to him by Mr. Bonteen, had hardly understood them;\nbut it had been explained to him that his friend had meant \"men,\nnot measures.\" When Parliament met, Mr. Gresham, the leader of the\nLiberal party, had not as yet expressed any desire to his general\nfollowers.\n\nThe Queen's Speech was read, and the one paragraph which seemed\nto possess any great public interest was almost a repetition of\nthe words which Mr. Daubeny had spoken to the electors of East\nBarsetshire. \"It will probably be necessary for you to review the\nconnection which still exists between, and which binds together,\nthe Church and the State.\" Mr. Daubeny's words had of course been\nmore fluent, but the gist of the expression was the same. He had\nbeen quite in earnest when addressing his friends in the country.\nAnd though there had been but an interval of a few weeks, the\nConservative party in the two Houses heard the paragraph read\nwithout surprise and without a murmur. Some said that the gentlemen\non the Treasury Bench in the House of Commons did not look to be\ncomfortable. Mr. Daubeny sat with his hat over his brow, mute,\napparently impassive and unapproachable, during the reading of\nthe Speech and the moving and seconding of the Address. The House\nwas very full, and there was much murmuring on the side of the\nOpposition;--but from the Government benches hardly a sound was\nheard, as a young gentleman, from one of the Midland counties, in\na deputy-lieutenant's uniform, who had hitherto been known for no\nparticular ideas of his own, but had been believed to be at any rate\ntrue to the Church, explained, not in very clear language, that the\ntime had at length come when the interests of religion demanded a\nwider support and a fuller sympathy than could be afforded under that\nsystem of Church endowment and State establishment for which the\ncountry had hitherto been so grateful, and for which the country\nhad such boundless occasion for gratitude. Another gentleman, in\nthe uniform of the Guards, seconded the Address, and declared that\nin nothing was the sagacity of a Legislature so necessary as in\ndiscerning the period in which that which had hitherto been good\nceased to be serviceable. The status pupillaris was mentioned, and\nit was understood that he had implied that England was now old enough\nto go on in matters of religion without a tutor in the shape of a\nState Church.\n\nWho makes the speeches, absolutely puts together the words, which\nare uttered when the Address is moved and seconded? It can hardly be\nthat lessons are prepared and sent to the noble lords and honourable\ngentlemen to be learned by heart like a school-boy's task. And\nyet, from their construction, style, and general tone,--from the\nplatitudes which they contain as well as from the general safety\nand good sense of the remarks,--from the absence of any attempt to\nimprove a great occasion by the fire of oratory, one cannot but be\nconvinced that a very absolute control is exercised. The gorgeously\napparelled speakers, who seem to have great latitude allowed them in\nthe matter of clothing, have certainly very little in the matter of\nlanguage. And then it always seems that either of the four might\nhave made the speech of any of the others. It could not have been\nthe case that the Hon. Colonel Mowbray Dick, the Member for West\nBustard, had really elaborated out of his own head that theory of\nthe status pupillaris. A better fellow, or a more popular officer,\nor a sweeter-tempered gentleman than Mowbray Dick does not exist;\nbut he certainly never entertained advanced opinions respecting the\nreligious education of his country. When he is at home with his\nfamily, he always goes to church, and there has been an end of it.\n\nAnd then the fight began. The thunderbolts of opposition were\nunloosed, and the fires of political rancour blazed high. Mr. Gresham\nrose to his legs, and declared to all the world that which he had\nhitherto kept secret from his own party. It was known afterwards that\nin discussion with his own dearly-beloved political friend, Lord\nCantrip, he had expressed his unbounded anger at the duplicity, greed\nfor power, and want of patriotism displayed by his opponent; but he\nhad acknowledged that the blow had come so quick and so unexpectedly\nthat he thought it better to leave the matter to the House without\ninstruction from himself. He now revelled in sarcasm, and before\nhis speech was over raged into wrath. He would move an amendment to\nthe Address for two reasons,--first because this was no moment for\nbringing before Parliament the question of the Church establishment,\nwhen as yet no well-considered opportunity of expressing itself on\nthe subject had been afforded to the country, and secondly because\nany measure of reform on that matter should certainly not come to\nthem from the right honourable gentleman opposite. As to the first\nobjection, he should withhold his arguments till the bill suggested\nhad been presented to them. It was in handling the second that he\ndisplayed his great power of invective. All those men who then sat in\nthe House, and who on that night crowded the galleries, remember his\ntones as, turning to the dissenters who usually supported him, and\npointing over the table to his opponents, he uttered that well-worn\nquotation, _Quod minime reris_,--then he paused, and began again;\n_Quod minime reris,--Grai\u00c3\u00a2 pandetur ab urbe_. The power and inflexion\nof his voice at the word _Grai\u00c3\u00a2_ were certainly very wonderful. He\nended by moving an amendment to the Address, and asking for support\nequally from one side of the House as from the other.\n\nWhen at length Mr. Daubeny moved his hat from his brow and rose to\nhis legs he began by expressing his thankfulness that he had not\nbeen made a victim to the personal violence of the right honourable\ngentleman. He continued the same strain of badinage throughout,--in\nwhich he was thought to have been wrong, as it was a method of\ndefence, or attack, for which his peculiar powers hardly suited him.\nAs to any bill that was to be laid upon the table, he had not as yet\nproduced it. He did not doubt that the dissenting interests of the\ncountry would welcome relief from an anomaly, let it come whence\nit might, even _Grai\u00c3\u00a2 ab urbe_, and he waved his hand back to\nthe clustering Conservatives who sat behind him. That the right\nhonourable gentleman should be angry he could understand, as the\nreturn to power of the right honourable gentleman and his party had\nbeen anticipated, and he might almost say discounted as a certainty.\n\nThen, when Mr. Daubeny sat down, the House was adjourned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE DEBATE.\n\n\nThe beginning of the battle as recorded in the last chapter took\nplace on a Friday,--Friday, 11th November,--and consequently two\nentire days intervened before the debate could be renewed. There\nseemed to prevail an opinion during this interval that Mr. Gresham\nhad been imprudent. It was acknowledged by all men that no finer\nspeech than that delivered by him had ever been heard within the\nwalls of that House. It was acknowledged also that as regarded the\nquestion of oratory Mr. Daubeny had failed signally. But the strategy\nof the Minister was said to have been excellent, whereas that of\nthe ex-Minister was very loudly condemned. There is nothing so\nprejudicial to a cause as temper. This man is declared to be unfit\nfor any position of note, because he always shows temper. Anything\ncan be done with another man,--he can be made to fit almost any\nhole,--because he has his temper under command. It may, indeed, be\nassumed that a man who loses his temper while he is speaking is\nendeavouring to speak the truth such as he believes it to be, and\nagain it may be assumed that a man who speaks constantly without\nlosing his temper is not always entitled to the same implicit faith.\nWhether or not this be a reason the more for preferring the calm\nand tranquil man may be doubted; but the calm and tranquil man is\npreferred for public services. We want practical results rather than\ntruth. A clear head is worth more than an honest heart. In a matter\nof horseflesh of what use is it to have all manner of good gifts if\nyour horse won't go whither you want him, and refuses to stop when\nyou bid him? Mr. Gresham had been very indiscreet, and had especially\nsinned in opposing the Address without arrangements with his party.\n\nAnd he made the matter worse by retreating within his own shell\nduring the whole of that Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning.\nLord Cantrip was with him three or four times, and he saw both Mr.\nPalliser, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer under him, and Mr.\nRatler. But he went amidst no congregation of Liberals, and asked\nfor no support. He told Ratler that he wished gentlemen to vote\naltogether in accordance with their opinions; and it came to be\nwhispered in certain circles that he had resigned, or was resigning,\nor would resign, the leadership of his party. Men said that his\npassions were too much for him, and that he was destroyed by feelings\nof regret, and almost of remorse.\n\nThe Ministers held a Cabinet Council on the Monday morning, and it\nwas supposed afterwards that that also had been stormy. Two gentlemen\nhad certainly resigned their seats in the Government before the House\nmet at four o'clock, and there were rumours abroad that others would\ndo so if the suggested measure should be found really to amount to\ndisestablishment. The rumours were, of course, worthy of no belief,\nas the transactions of the Cabinet are of necessity secret. Lord\nDrummond at the War Office, and Mr. Boffin from the Board of Trade,\ndid, however, actually resign; and Mr. Boffin's explanations in\nthe House were heard before the debate was resumed. Mr. Boffin had\ncertainly not joined the present Ministry,--so he said,--with the\nview of destroying the Church. He had no other remark to make, and he\nwas sure that the House would appreciate the course which had induced\nhim to seat himself below the gangway. The House cheered very loudly,\nand Mr. Boffin was the hero of ten minutes. Mr. Daubeny detracted\nsomething from this triumph by the overstrained and perhaps ironic\npathos with which he deplored the loss of his right honourable\nfriend's services. Now this right honourable gentleman had never been\nspecially serviceable.\n\nBut the wonder of the world arose from the fact that only two\ngentlemen out of the twenty or thirty who composed the Government did\ngive up their places on this occasion. And this was a Conservative\nGovernment! With what a force of agony did all the Ratlers of the\nday repeat that inappropriate name! Conservatives! And yet they\nwere ready to abandon the Church at the bidding of such a man as Mr.\nDaubeny! Ratler himself almost felt that he loved the Church. Only\ntwo resignations;--whereas it had been expected that the whole House\nwould fall to pieces! Was it possible that these earls, that marquis,\nand the two dukes, and those staunch old Tory squires, should remain\nin a Government pledged to disestablish the Church? Was all the\nhonesty, all the truth of the great party confined to the bosoms of\nMr. Boffin and Lord Drummond? Doubtless they were all Esaus; but\nwould they sell their great birthright for so very small a mess of\npottage? The parsons in the country, and the little squires who but\nrarely come up to London, spoke of it all exactly as did the Ratlers.\nThere were parishes in the country in which Mr. Boffin was canonised,\nthough up to that date no Cabinet Minister could well have been less\nknown to fame than was Mr. Boffin.\n\nWhat would those Liberals do who would naturally rejoice in the\ndisestablishment of the Church,--those members of the Lower House,\nwho had always spoken of the ascendancy of Protestant episcopacy with\nthe bitter acrimony of exclusion? After all, the success or failure\nof Mr. Daubeny must depend, not on his own party, but on them.\nIt must always be so when measures of Reform are advocated by a\nConservative Ministry. There will always be a number of untrained men\nready to take the gift without looking at the giver. They have not\nexpected relief from the hands of Greeks, but will take it when it\ncomes from Greeks or Trojans. What would Mr. Turnbull say in this\ndebate,--and what Mr. Monk? Mr. Turnbull was the people's tribune, of\nthe day; Mr. Monk had also been a tribune, then a Minister, and now\nwas again--something less than a tribune. But there were a few men in\nthe House, and some out of it, who regarded Mr. Monk as the honestest\nand most patriotic politician of the day.\n\nThe debate was long and stormy, but was peculiarly memorable for the\nskill with which Mr. Daubeny's higher colleagues defended the steps\nthey were about to take. The thing was to be done in the cause of\nreligion. The whole line of defence was indicated by the gentlemen\nwho moved and seconded the Address. An active, well-supported Church\nwas the chief need of a prosperous and intelligent people. As to the\nendowments, there was some confusion of ideas; but nothing was to be\ndone with them inappropriate to religion. Education would receive\nthe bulk of what was left after existing interests had been amply\nguaranteed. There would be no doubt,--so said these gentlemen,--that\nample funds for the support of an Episcopal Church would come from\nthose wealthy members of the body to whom such a Church was dear.\nThere seemed to be a conviction that clergymen under the new order\nof things would be much better off than under the old. As to the\nconnection with the State, the time for it had clearly gone by. The\nChurch, as a Church, would own increased power when it could appoint\nits own bishops, and be wholly dissevered from State patronage. It\nseemed to be almost a matter of surprise that really good Churchmen\nshould have endured so long to be shackled by subservience to the\nState. Some of these gentlemen pleaded their cause so well that they\nalmost made it appear that episcopal ascendancy would be restored in\nEngland by the disseverance of the Church and State.\n\nMr. Turnbull, who was himself a dissenter, was at last upon his legs,\nand then the Ratlers knew that the game was lost. It would be lost as\nfar as it could be lost by a majority in that House on that motion;\nand it was by that majority or minority that Mr. Daubeny would be\nmaintained in his high office or ejected from it. Mr. Turnbull began\nby declaring that he did not at all like Mr. Daubeny as a Minister\nof the Crown. He was not in the habit of attaching himself specially\nto any Minister of the Crown. Experience had taught him to doubt\nthem all. Of all possible Ministers of the Crown at this period, Mr.\nDaubeny was he thought perhaps the worst, and the most dangerous. But\nthe thing now offered was too good to be rejected, let it come from\nwhat quarter it would. Indeed, might it not be said of all the good\nthings obtained for the people, of all really serviceable reforms,\nthat they were gathered and garnered home in consequence of the\nsquabbles of Ministers? When men wanted power, either to grasp at\nit or to retain it, then they offered bribes to the people. But in\nthe taking of such bribes there was no dishonesty, and he should\nwillingly take this bribe.\n\nMr. Monk spoke also. He would not, he said, feel himself justified\nin refusing the Address to the Crown proposed by Ministers, simply\nbecause that Address was founded on the proposition of a future\nreform, as to the expediency of which he had not for many years\nentertained a doubt. He could not allow it to be said of him that he\nhad voted for the permanence of the Church establishment, and he must\ntherefore support the Government. Then Ratler whispered a few words\nto his neighbour: \"I knew the way he'd run when Gresham insisted on\npoor old Mildmay's taking him into the Cabinet.\" \"The whole thing has\ngone to the dogs,\" said Bonteen. On the fourth night the House was\ndivided, and Mr. Daubeny was the owner of a majority of fifteen.\n\nVery many of the Liberal party expressed an opinion that the battle\nhad been lost through the want of judgment evinced by Mr. Gresham.\nThere was certainly no longer that sturdy adherence to their chief\nwhich is necessary for the solidarity of a party. Perhaps no leader\nof the House was ever more devoutly worshipped by a small number of\nadherents than was Mr. Gresham now; but such worship will not support\npower. Within the three days following the division the Ratlers had\nall put their heads together and had resolved that the Duke of St.\nBungay was now the only man who could keep the party together. \"But\nwho should lead our House?\" asked Bonteen. Ratler sighed instead of\nanswering. Things had come to that pass that Mr. Gresham was the only\npossible leader. And the leader of the House of Commons, on behalf\nof the Government, must be the chief man in the Government, let the\nso-called Prime Minister be who he may.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE DESERTED HUSBAND.\n\n\nPhineas Finn had been in the gallery of the House throughout the\ndebate, and was greatly grieved at Mr. Daubeny's success, though\nhe himself had so strongly advocated the disestablishment of the\nChurch in canvassing the electors of Tankerville. No doubt he had\nadvocated the cause,--but he had done so as an advanced member of the\nLiberal party, and he regarded the proposition when coming from Mr.\nDaubeny as a horrible and abnormal birth. He, however, was only a\nlooker-on,--could be no more than a looker-on for the existing short\nsession. It had already been decided that the judge who was to try\nthe case at Tankerville should visit that town early in January; and\nshould it be decided on a scrutiny that the seat belonged to our\nhero, then he would enter upon his privilege in the following Session\nwithout any further trouble to himself at Tankerville. Should this\nnot be the case,--then the abyss of absolute vacuity would be open\nbefore him. He would have to make some disposition of himself, but he\nwould be absolutely without an idea as to the how or where. He was in\npossession of funds to support himself for a year or two; but after\nthat, and even during that time, all would be dark. If he should get\nhis seat, then again the power of making an effort would at last be\nwithin his hands.\n\nHe had made up his mind to spend the Christmas with Lord Brentford\nand Lady Laura Kennedy at Dresden, and had already fixed the day of\nhis arrival there. But this had been postponed by another invitation\nwhich had surprised him much, but which it had been impossible for\nhim not to accept. It had come as follows:--\n\n\n   November 9th, Loughlinter.\n\n   DEAR SIR,\n\n   I am informed by letter from Dresden that you are in\n   London on your way to that city with the view of spending\n   some days with the Earl of Brentford. You will, of course,\n   be once more thrown into the society of my wife, Lady\n   Laura Kennedy.\n\n   I have never understood, and certainly have never\n   sanctioned, that breach of my wife's marriage vow which\n   has led to her withdrawal from my roof. I never bade her\n   go, and I have bidden her return. Whatever may be her\n   feelings, or mine, her duty demands her presence here,\n   and my duty calls upon me to receive her. This I am and\n   always have been ready to do. Were the laws of Europe\n   sufficiently explicit and intelligible I should force her\n   to return to my house,--because she sins while she remains\n   away, and I should sin were I to omit to use any means\n   which the law might place in my hands for the due control\n   of my own wife. I am very explicit to you although we\n   have of late been strangers, because in former days you\n   were closely acquainted with the condition of my family\n   affairs.\n\n   Since my wife left me I have had no means of communicating\n   with her by the assistance of any common friend. Having\n   heard that you are about to visit her at Dresden I feel a\n   great desire to see you that I may be enabled to send by\n   you a personal message. My health, which is now feeble,\n   and the altered habits of my life render it almost\n   impossible that I should proceed to London with this\n   object, and I therefore ask it of your Christian charity\n   that you should visit me here at Loughlinter. You, as a\n   Roman Catholic, cannot but hold the bond of matrimony\n   to be irrefragable. You cannot, at least, think that it\n   should be set aside at the caprice of an excitable woman\n   who is not able and never has been able to assign any\n   reason for leaving the protection of her husband.\n\n   I shall have much to say to you, and I trust you will\n   come. I will not ask you to prolong your visit, as I have\n   nothing to offer you in the way of amusement. My mother is\n   with me; but otherwise I am alone. Since my wife left me I\n   have not thought it even decent to entertain guests or to\n   enjoy society. I have lived a widowed life. I cannot even\n   offer you shooting, as I have no keepers on the mountains.\n   There are fish in the river doubtless, for the gifts of\n   God are given let men be ever so unworthy; but this, I\n   believe, is not the month for fishermen. I ask you to come\n   to me, not as a pleasure, but as a Christian duty.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   ROBERT KENNEDY.\n\n   Phineas Finn, Esq.\n\n\nAs soon as he had read the letter Phineas felt that he had no\nalternative but to go. The visit would be very disagreeable, but it\nmust be made. So he sent a line to Robert Kennedy naming a day; and\nwrote another to Lady Laura postponing his time at Dresden by a week,\nand explaining the cause of its postponement. As soon as the debate\non the Address was over he started for Loughlinter.\n\nA thousand memories crowded on his brain as he made the journey.\nVarious circumstances had in his early life,--in that period of his\nlife which had lately seemed to be cut off from the remainder of his\ndays by so clear a line,--thrown him into close connection with this\nman, and with the man's wife. He had first gone to Loughlinter, not\nas Lady Laura's guest,--for Lady Laura had not then been married, or\neven engaged to be married,--but on her persuasion rather than on\nthat of Mr. Kennedy. When there he had asked Lady Laura to be his own\nwife, and she had then told him that she was to become the wife of\nthe owner of that domain. He remembered the blow as though it had\nbeen struck but yesterday, and yet the pain of the blow had not been\nlong enduring. But though then rejected he had always been the chosen\nfriend of the woman,--a friend chosen after an especial fashion. When\nhe had loved another woman this friend had resented his defection\nwith all a woman's jealousy. He had saved the husband's life, and had\nthen become also the husband's friend, after that cold fashion which\nan obligation will create. Then the husband had been jealous, and\ndissension had come, and the ill-matched pair had been divided, with\nabsolute ruin to both of them, as far as the material comforts and\nwell-being of life were concerned. Then he, too, had been ejected,\nas it were, out of the world, and it had seemed to him as though\nLaura Standish and Robert Kennedy had been the inhabitants of another\nhemisphere. Now he was about to see them both again, both separately;\nand to become the medium of some communication between them. He knew,\nor thought that he knew, that no communication could avail anything.\n\nIt was dark night when he was driven up to the door of Loughlinter\nHouse in a fly from the town of Callender. When he first made the\njourney, now some six or seven years since, he had done so with Mr.\nRatler, and he remembered well that circumstance. He remembered also\nthat on his arrival Lady Laura had scolded him for having travelled\nin such company. She had desired him to seek other friends,--friends\nhigher in general estimation, and nobler in purpose. He had done so,\npartly at her instance, and with success. But Mr. Ratler was now\nsomebody in the world, and he was nobody. And he remembered also how\non that occasion he had been troubled in his mind in regard to a\nservant, not as yet knowing whether the usages of the world did or\ndid not require that he should go so accompanied. He had taken the\nman, and had been thoroughly ashamed of himself for doing so. He had\nno servant now, no grandly developed luggage, no gun, no elaborate\ndress for the mountains. On that former occasion his heart had been\nvery full when he reached Loughlinter, and his heart was full now.\nThen he had resolved to say a few words to Lady Laura, and he had\nhardly known how best to say them. Now he would be called upon to\nsay a few to Lady Laura's husband, and the task would be almost as\ndifficult.\n\nThe door was opened for him by an old servant in black, who proposed\nat once to show him to his room. He looked round the vast hall,\nwhich, when he had before known it, was ever filled with signs of\nlife, and felt at once that it was empty and deserted. It struck him\nas intolerably cold, and he saw that the huge fireplace was without a\nspark of fire. Dinner, the servant said, was prepared for half-past\nseven. Would Mr. Finn wish to dress? Of course he wished to dress.\nAnd as it was already past seven he hurried up stairs to his room.\nHere again everything was cold and wretched. There was no fire, and\nthe man had left him with a single candle. There were candlesticks on\nthe dressing-table, but they were empty. The man had suggested hot\nwater, but the hot water did not come. In his poorest days he had\nnever known discomfort such as this, and yet Mr. Kennedy was one of\nthe richest commoners of Great Britain.\n\nBut he dressed, and made his way down stairs, not knowing where\nhe should find his host or his host's mother. He recognised the\ndifferent doors and knew the rooms within them, but they seemed\ninhospitably closed against him, and he went and stood in the cold\nhall. But the man was watching for him, and led him into a small\nparlour. Then it was explained to him that Mr. Kennedy's state of\nhealth did not admit of late dinners. He was to dine alone, and Mr.\nKennedy would receive him after dinner. In a moment his cheeks became\nred, and a flash of wrath crossed his heart. Was he to be treated\nin this way by a man on whose behalf,--with no thought of his own\ncomfort or pleasure,--he had made this long and abominable journey?\nMight it not be well for him to leave the house without seeing Mr.\nKennedy at all? Then he remembered that he had heard it whispered\nthat the man had become bewildered in his mind. He relented,\ntherefore, and condescended to eat his dinner.\n\nA very poor dinner it was. There was a morsel of flabby white fish,\nas to the nature of which Phineas was altogether in doubt, a beef\nsteak as to the nature of which he was not at all in doubt, and a\nlittle crumpled-up tart which he thought the driver of the fly must\nhave brought with him from the pastry-cook's at Callender. There was\nsome very hot sherry, but not much of it. And there was a bottle of\nclaret, as to which Phineas, who was not usually particular in the\nmatter of wine, persisted in declining to have anything to do with\nit after the first attempt. The gloomy old servant, who stuck to him\nduring the repast, persisted in offering it, as though the credit\nof the hospitality of Loughlinter depended on it. There are so many\nmen by whom the tenuis ratio saporum has not been achieved, that the\nCaleb Balderstones of those houses in which plenty does not flow\nare almost justified in hoping that goblets of Gladstone may pass\ncurrent. Phineas Finn was not a martyr to eating or drinking. He\nplayed with his fish without thinking much about it. He worked\nmanfully at the steak. He gave another crumple to the tart, and left\nit without a pang. But when the old man urged him, for the third\ntime, to take that pernicious draught with his cheese, he angrily\ndemanded a glass of beer. The old man toddled out of the room, and\non his return he proffered to him a diminutive glass of white spirit,\nwhich he called usquebaugh. Phineas, happy to get a little whisky,\nsaid nothing more about the beer, and so the dinner was over.\n\nHe rose so suddenly from his chair that the man did not dare to ask\nhim whether he would not sit over his wine. A suggestion that way was\nindeed made, would he \"visit the laird out o' hand, or would he bide\nawee?\" Phineas decided on visiting the laird out of hand, and was\nat once led across the hall, down a back passage which he had never\nbefore traversed, and introduced to the chamber which had ever been\nknown as the \"laird's ain room.\" Here Robert Kennedy rose to receive\nhim.\n\nPhineas knew the man's age well. He was still under fifty, but he\nlooked as though he were seventy. He had always been thin, but he was\nthinner now than ever. He was very grey, and stooped so much, that\nthough he came forward a step or two to greet his guest, it seemed\nas though he had not taken the trouble to raise himself to his\nproper height. \"You find me a much altered man,\" he said. The change\nhad been so great that it was impossible to deny it, and Phineas\nmuttered something of regret that his host's health should be so\nbad. \"It is trouble of the mind,--not of the body, Mr. Finn. It is\nher doing,--her doing. Life is not to me a light thing, nor are\nthe obligations of life light. When I married a wife, she became\nbone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. Can I lose my bones and\nmy flesh,--knowing that they are not with God but still subject\nelsewhere to the snares of the devil, and live as though I were a\nsound man? Had she died I could have borne it. I hope they have made\nyou comfortable, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Not that Loughlinter can be comfortable now to any one. How can a\nman, whose wife has deserted him, entertain his guests? I am ashamed\neven to look a friend in the face, Mr. Finn.\" As he said this he\nstretched forth his open hand as though to hide his countenance, and\nPhineas hardly knew whether the absurdity of the movement or the\ntragedy of the feeling struck him the more forcibly. \"What did I do\nthat she should leave me? Did I strike her? Was I faithless? Had she\nnot the half of all that was mine? Did I frighten her by hard words,\nor exact hard tasks? Did I not commune with her, telling her all my\nmost inward purposes? In things of this world, and of that better\nworld that is coming, was she not all in all to me? Did I not make\nher my very wife? Mr. Finn, do you know what made her go away?\" He\nhad asked perhaps a dozen questions. As to the eleven which came\nfirst it was evident that no answer was required; and they had been\nput with that pathetic dignity with which it is so easy to invest\nthe interrogatory form of address. But to the last question it was\nintended that Phineas should give an answer, as Phineas presumed\nat once; and then it was asked with a wink of the eye, a low eager\nvoice, and a sly twist of the face that were frightfully ludicrous.\n\"I suppose you do know,\" said Mr. Kennedy, again working his eye,\nand thrusting his chin forward.\n\n\n[Illustration: The Laird of Loughlinter.]\n\n\n\"I imagine that she was not happy.\"\n\n\"Happy? What right had she to expect to be happy? Are we to believe\nthat we should be happy here? Are we not told that we are to look\nfor happiness there, and to hope for none below?\" As he said this he\nstretched his left hand to the ceiling. \"But why shouldn't she have\nbeen happy? What did she want? Did she ever say anything against me,\nMr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Nothing but this,--that your temper and hers were incompatible.\"\n\n\"I thought at one time that you advised her to go away?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"She told you about it?\"\n\n\"Not, if I remember, till she had made up her mind, and her father\nhad consented to receive her. I had known, of course, that things\nwere unpleasant.\"\n\n\"How were they unpleasant? Why were they unpleasant? She wouldn't let\nyou come and dine with me in London. I never knew why that was. When\nshe did what was wrong, of course I had to tell her. Who else should\ntell her but her husband? If you had been her husband, and I only\nan acquaintance, then I might have said what I pleased. They rebel\nagainst the yoke because it is a yoke. And yet they accept the yoke,\nknowing it to be a yoke. It comes of the devil. You think a priest\ncan put everything right.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Nothing can put you right but the fear of God; and when a woman\nis too proud to ask for that, evils like these are sure to come.\nShe would not go to church on Sunday afternoon, but had meetings of\nBelial at her father's house instead.\" Phineas well remembered those\nmeetings of Belial, in which he with others had been wont to discuss\nthe political prospects of the day. \"When she persisted in breaking\nthe Lord's commandment, and defiling the Lord's day, I knew well what\nwould come of it.\"\n\n\"I am not sure, Mr. Kennedy, that a husband is justified in demanding\nthat a wife shall think just as he thinks on matters of religion. If\nhe is particular about it, he should find all that out before.\"\n\n\"Particular! God's word is to be obeyed, I suppose?\"\n\n\"But people doubt about God's word.\"\n\n\"Then people will be damned,\" said Mr. Kennedy, rising from his\nchair. \"And they will be damned.\"\n\n\"A woman doesn't like to be told so.\"\n\n\"I never told her so. I never said anything of the kind. I never\nspoke a hard word to her in my life. If her head did but ache, I hung\nover her with the tenderest solicitude. I refused her nothing. When\nI found that she was impatient I chose the shortest sermon for our\nSunday evening's worship, to the great discomfort of my mother.\"\nPhineas wondered whether this assertion as to the discomfort of old\nMrs. Kennedy could possibly be true. Could it be that any human being\nreally preferred a long sermon to a short one,--except the being who\npreached it or read it aloud? \"There was nothing that I did not do\nfor her. I suppose you really do know why she went away, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"I know nothing more than I have said.\"\n\n\"I did think once that she was--\"\n\n\"There was nothing more than I have said,\" asserted Phineas sternly,\nfearing that the poor insane man was about to make some suggestion\nthat would be terribly painful. \"She felt that she did not make you\nhappy.\"\n\n\"I did not want her to make me happy. I do not expect to be made\nhappy. I wanted her to do her duty. You were in love with her once,\nMr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was. I was in love with Lady Laura Standish.\"\n\n\"Ah! Yes. There was no harm in that, of course; only when any thing\nof that kind happens, people had better keep out of each other's way\nafterwards. Not that I was ever jealous, you know.\"\n\n\"I should hope not.\"\n\n\"But I don't see why you should go all the way to Dresden to pay her\na visit. What good can that do? I think you had much better stay\nwhere you are, Mr. Finn; I do indeed. It isn't a decent thing for a\nyoung unmarried man to go half across Europe to see a lady who is\nseparated from her husband, and who was once in love with him;--I\nmean he was once in love with her. It's a very wicked thing, Mr.\nFinn, and I have to beg that you will not do it.\"\n\nPhineas felt that he had been grossly taken in. He had been asked to\ncome to Loughlinter in order that he might take a message from the\nhusband to the wife, and now the husband made use of his compliance\nto forbid the visit on some grotesque score of jealousy. He knew that\nthe man was mad, and that therefore he ought not to be angry; but the\nman was not too mad to require a rational answer, and had some method\nin his madness. \"Lady Laura Kennedy is living with her father,\" said\nPhineas.\n\n\"Pshaw;--dotard!\"\n\n\"Lady Laura Kennedy is living with her father,\" repeated Phineas;\n\"and I am going to the house of the Earl of Brentford.\"\n\n\"Who was it wrote and asked you?\"\n\n\"The letter was from Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"Yes;--from my wife. What right had my wife to write to you when\nshe will not even answer my appeals? She is my wife;--my wife! In\nthe presence of God she and I have been made one, and even man's\nordinances have not dared to separate us. Mr. Finn, as the husband\nof Lady Laura Kennedy, I desire that you abstain from seeking her\npresence.\" As he said this he rose from his chair, and took the poker\nin his hand. The chair in which he was sitting was placed upon the\nrug, and it might be that the fire required his attention. As he\nstood bending down, with the poker in his right hand, with his eye\nstill fixed on his guest's face, his purpose was doubtful. The motion\nmight be a threat, or simply have a useful domestic tendency. But\nPhineas, believing that the man was mad, rose from his seat and stood\nupon his guard. The point of the poker had undoubtedly been raised;\nbut as Phineas stretched himself to his height, it fell gradually\ntowards the fire, and at last was buried very gently among the coals.\nBut he was never convinced that Mr. Kennedy had carried out the\npurpose with which he rose from his chair. \"After what has passed,\nyou will no doubt abandon your purpose,\" said Mr. Kennedy.\n\n\"I shall certainly go to Dresden,\" said Phineas. \"If you have a\nmessage to send, I will take it.\"\n\n\"Then you will be accursed among adulterers,\" said the laird of\nLoughlinter. \"By such a one I will send no message. From the first\nmoment that I saw you I knew you for a child of Apollyon. But the sin\nwas my own. Why did I ask to my house an idolater, one who pretends\nto believe that a crumb of bread is my God, a Papist, untrue alike\nto his country and to his Saviour? When she desired it of me I knew\nthat I was wrong to yield. Yes;--it is you who have done it all, you,\nyou, you;--and if she be a castaway, the weight of her soul will be\ndoubly heavy on your own.\"\n\nTo get out of the room, and then at the earliest possible hour of the\nmorning out of the house, were now the objects to be attained. That\nhis presence had had a peculiarly evil influence on Mr. Kennedy,\nPhineas could not doubt; as assuredly the unfortunate man would\nnot have been left with mastery over his own actions had his usual\ncondition been such as that which he now displayed. He had been told\nthat \"poor Kennedy\" was mad,--as we are often told of the madness\nof our friends when they cease for awhile to run in the common\ngrooves of life. But the madman had now gone a long way out of\nthe grooves;--so far, that he seemed to Phineas to be decidedly\ndangerous. \"I think I had better wish you good night,\" he said.\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I hope you won't go and make more mischief.\"\n\n\"I shall not do that, certainly.\"\n\n\"You won't tell her what I have said?\"\n\n\"I shall tell her nothing to make her think that your opinion of her\nis less high than it ought to be.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said Phineas again; and then he left the room. It was\nas yet but nine o'clock, and he had no alternative but to go to bed.\nHe found his way back into the hall, and from thence up to his own\nchamber. But there was no fire there, and the night was cold. He went\nto the window, and raised it for a moment, that he might hear the\nwell-remembered sound of the Fall of Linter. Though the night was\ndark and wintry, a dismal damp November night, he would have crept\nout of the house and made his way up to the top of the brae, for\nthe sake of auld lang syne, had he not feared that the inhospitable\nmansion would be permanently closed against him on his return. He\nrang the bell once or twice, and after a while the old serving man\ncame to him. Could he have a cup of tea? The man shook his head, and\nfeared that no boiling water could be procured at that late hour of\nthe night. Could he have his breakfast the next morning at seven, and\na conveyance to Callender at half-past seven? When the old man again\nshook his head, seeming to be dazed at the enormity of the demand,\nPhineas insisted that his request should be conveyed to the master of\nthe house. As to the breakfast, he said he did not care about it, but\nthe conveyance he must have. He did, in fact, obtain both, and left\nthe house early on the following morning without again seeing Mr.\nKennedy, and without having spoken a single word to Mr. Kennedy's\nmother. And so great was his hurry to get away from the place which\nhad been so disagreeable to him, and which he thought might possibly\nbecome more so, that he did not even run across the sward that\ndivided the gravel sweep from the foot of the waterfall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE TRUANT WIFE.\n\n\nPhineas on his return to London wrote a line to Lady Chiltern in\naccordance with a promise which had been exacted from him. She was\nanxious to learn something as to the real condition of her husband's\nbrother-in-law, and, when she heard that Phineas was going to\nLoughlinter, had begged that he would tell her the truth. \"He has\nbecome eccentric, gloomy, and very strange,\" said Phineas. \"I do not\nbelieve that he is really mad, but his condition is such that I think\nno friend should recommend Lady Laura to return to him. He seems to\nhave devoted himself to a gloomy religion,--and to the saving of\nmoney. I had but one interview with him, and that was essentially\ndisagreeable.\" Having remained two days in London, and having\nparticipated, as far as those two days would allow him, in the\ngeneral horror occasioned by the wickedness and success of Mr.\nDaubeny, he started for Dresden.\n\nHe found Lord Brentford living in a spacious house, with a huge\ngarden round it, close upon the northern confines of the town.\nDresden, taken altogether, is a clean cheerful city, and strikes\nthe stranger on his first entrance as a place in which men are\ngregarious, busy, full of merriment, and pre-eminently social. Such\nis the happy appearance of but few towns either in the old or the\nnew world, and is hardly more common in Germany than elsewhere.\nLeipsic is decidedly busy, but does not look to be social. Vienna is\nsufficiently gregarious, but its streets are melancholy. Munich is\nsocial, but lacks the hum of business. Frankfort is both practical\nand picturesque, but it is dirty, and apparently averse to mirth.\nDresden has much to recommend it, and had Lord Brentford with his\ndaughter come abroad in quest of comfortable easy social life, his\nchoice would have been well made. But, as it was, any of the towns\nabove named would have suited him as well as Dresden, for he saw no\nsociety, and cared nothing for the outward things of the world around\nhim. He found Dresden to be very cold in the winter and very hot in\nthe summer, and he liked neither heat nor cold; but he had made up\nhis mind that all places, and indeed all things, are nearly equally\ndisagreeable, and therefore he remained at Dresden, grumbling almost\ndaily as to the climate and manners of the people.\n\nPhineas, when he arrived at the hall door, almost doubted whether\nhe had not been as wrong in visiting Lord Brentford as he had in\ngoing to Loughlinter. His friendship with the old Earl had been\nvery fitful, and there had been quarrels quite as pronounced as the\nfriendship. He had often been happy in the Earl's house, but the\nhappiness had not sprung from any love for the man himself. How would\nit be with him if he found the Earl hardly more civil to him than the\nEarl's son-in-law had been? In former days the Earl had been a man\nquite capable of making himself disagreeable, and probably had not\nyet lost the power of doing so. Of all our capabilities this is the\none which clings longest to us. He was thinking of all this when he\nfound himself at the door of the Earl's house. He had travelled all\nnight, and was very cold. At Leipsic there had been a nominal twenty\nminutes for refreshment, which the circumstances of the station had\nreduced to five. This had occurred very early in the morning, and had\nsufficed only to give him a bowl of coffee. It was now nearly ten,\nand breakfast had become a serious consideration with him. He almost\ndoubted whether it would not have been better for him to have gone to\nan hotel in the first instance.\n\nHe soon found himself in the hall amidst a cluster of servants, among\nwhom he recognised the face of a man from Saulsby. He had, however,\nlittle time allowed him for looking about. He was hardly in the house\nbefore Lady Laura Kennedy was in his arms. She had run forward, and\nbefore he could look into her face, she had put up her cheek to his\nlips and had taken both his hands. \"Oh, my friend,\" she said; \"oh,\nmy friend! How good you are to come to me! How good you are to come!\"\nAnd then she led him into a large room, in which a table had been\nprepared for breakfast, close to an English-looking open fire. \"How\ncold you must be, and how hungry! Shall I have breakfast for you at\nonce, or will you dress first? You are to be quite at home, you know;\nexactly as though we were brother and sister. You are not to stand on\nany ceremonies.\" And again she took him by the hand. He had hardly\nlooked her yet in the face, and he could not do so now because he\nknew that she was crying. \"Then I will show you to your room,\" she\nsaid, when he had decided for a tub of water before breakfast. \"Yes,\nI will,--my own self. And I'd fetch the water for you, only I know it\nis there already. How long will you be? Half an hour? Very well. And\nyou would like tea best, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I should like tea best.\"\n\n\"I will make it for you. Papa never comes down till near two, and we\nshall have all the morning for talking. Oh, Phineas, it is such a\npleasure to hear your voice again. You have been at Loughlinter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been there.\"\n\n\"How very good of you; but I won't ask a question now. You must put\nup with a stove here, as we have not open fires in the bed-rooms. I\nhope you will be comfortable. Don't be more than half an hour, as I\nshall be impatient.\"\n\nThough he was thus instigated to haste he stood a few minutes with\nhis back to the warm stove that he might be enabled to think of it\nall. It was two years since he had seen this woman, and when they had\nparted there had been more between them of the remembrances of old\nfriendship than of present affection. During the last few weeks of\ntheir intimacy she had made a point of telling him that she intended\nto separate herself from her husband; but she had done so as though\nit were a duty, and an arranged part of her own defence of her own\nconduct. And in the latter incidents of her London life,--that life\nwith which he had been conversant,--she had generally been opposed\nto him, or, at any rate, had chosen to be divided from him. She had\nsaid severe things to him,--telling him that he was cold, heartless,\nand uninterested, never trying even to please him with that sort of\npraise which had once been so common with her in her intercourse with\nhim, and which all men love to hear from the mouths of women. She\nhad then been cold to him, though she would make wretched allusions\nto the time when he, at any rate, had not been cold to her. She had\nreproached him, and had at the same time turned away from him. She\nhad repudiated him, first as a lover, then as a friend; and he had\nhitherto never been able to gauge the depth of the affection for him\nwhich had underlaid all her conduct. As he stood there thinking of it\nall, he began to understand it.\n\nHow natural had been her conduct on his arrival, and how like that\nof a genuine, true-hearted, honest woman! All her first thoughts had\nbeen for his little personal wants,--that he should be warmed, and\nfed, and made outwardly comfortable. Let sorrow be ever so deep,\nand love ever so true, a man will be cold who travels by winter,\nand hungry who has travelled by night. And a woman, who is a true,\ngenuine woman, always takes delight in ministering to the natural\nwants of her friend. To see a man eat and drink, and wear his\nslippers, and sit at ease in his chair, is delightful to the feminine\nheart that loves. When I heard the other day that a girl had herself\nvisited the room prepared for a man in her mother's house, then\nI knew that she loved him, though I had never before believed it.\nPhineas, as he stood there, was aware that this woman loved him\ndearly. She had embraced him, and given her face to him to kiss. She\nhad clasped his hands, and clung to him, and had shown him plainly\nthat in the midst of all her sorrow she could be made happy by\nhis coming. But he was a man far too generous to take all this as\nmeaning aught that it did not mean,--too generous, and intrinsically\ntoo manly. In his character there was much of weakness, much of\nvacillation, perhaps some deficiency of strength and purpose; but\nthere was no touch of vanity. Women had loved him, and had told him\nso; and he had been made happy, and also wretched, by their love. But\nhe had never taken pride, personally, to himself because they had\nloved him. It had been the accident of his life. Now he remembered\nchiefly that this woman had called herself his sister, and he was\ngrateful.\n\nThen he thought of her personal appearance. As yet he had hardly\nlooked at her, but he felt that she had become old and worn, angular\nand hard-visaged. All this had no effect upon his feelings towards\nher, but filled him with ineffable regret. When he had first known\nher she had been a woman with a noble presence--not soft and feminine\nas had been Violet Effingham, but handsome and lustrous, with a\nhealthy youth. In regard to age he and she were of the same standing.\nThat he knew well. She had passed her thirty-second birthday, but\nthat was all. He felt himself to be still a young man, but he could\nnot think of her as of a young woman.\n\nWhen he went down she had been listening for his footsteps, and\nmet him at the door of the room. \"Now sit down,\" she said, \"and be\ncomfortable--if you can, with German surroundings. They are almost\nalways late, and never give one any time. Everybody says so. The\nstation at Leipsic is dreadful, I know. Good coffee is very well, but\nwhat is the use of good coffee if you have no time to drink it? You\nmust eat our omelette. If there is one thing we can do better than\nyou it is to make an omelette. Yes,--that is genuine German sausage.\nThere is always some placed upon the table, but the Germans who come\nhere never touch it themselves. You will have a cutlet, won't you?\nI breakfasted an hour ago, and more. I would not wait because then\nI thought I could talk to you better, and wait upon you. I did not\nthink that anything would ever please me so much again as your coming\nhas done. Oh, how much we shall have to say! Do you remember when we\nlast parted;--when you were going back to Ireland?\"\n\n\"I remember it well.\"\n\n\"Ah me; as I look back upon it all, how strange it seems. I dare say\nyou don't remember the first day I met you, at Mr. Mildmay's,--when I\nasked you to come to Portman Square because Barrington had said that\nyou were clever?\"\n\n\"I remember well going to Portman Square.\"\n\n\"That was the beginning of it all. Oh dear, oh dear; when I think of\nit I find it so hard to see where I have been right, and where I have\nbeen wrong. If I had not been very wrong all this evil could not have\ncome upon me.\"\n\n\"Misfortune has not always been deserved.\"\n\n\"I am sure it has been so with me. You can smoke here if you like.\"\nThis Phineas persistently refused to do. \"You may if you please. Papa\nnever comes in here, and I don't mind it. You'll settle down in a day\nor two, and understand the extent of your liberties. Tell me first\nabout Violet. She is happy?\"\n\n\"Quite happy, I think.\"\n\n\"I knew he would be good to her. But does she like the kind of life?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"She has a baby, and therefore of course she is happy. She says he is\nthe finest fellow in the world.\"\n\n\"I dare say he is. They all seem to be contented with him, but they\ndon't talk much about him.\"\n\n\"No; they wouldn't. Had you a child you would have talked about him,\nPhineas. I should have loved my baby better than all the world, but I\nshould have been silent about him. With Violet of course her husband\nis the first object. It would certainly be so from her nature. And so\nOswald is quite tame?\"\n\n\"I don't know that he is very tame out hunting.\"\n\n\"But to her?\"\n\n\"I should think always. She, you know, is very clever.\"\n\n\"So clever!\"\n\n\"And would be sure to steer clear of all offence,\" said Phineas,\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"While I could never for an hour avoid it. Did they say anything\nabout the journey to Flanders?\"\n\n\"Chiltern did, frequently. He made me strip my shoulder to show him\nthe place where he hit me.\"\n\n\"How like Oswald!\"\n\n\"And he told me that he would have given one of his eyes to kill me,\nonly Colepepper wouldn't let him go on. He half quarrelled with his\nsecond, but the man told him that I had not fired at him, and the\nthing must drop. 'It's better as it is, you know,' he said. And I\nagreed with him.\"\n\n\"And how did Violet receive you?\"\n\n\"Like an angel,--as she is.\"\n\n\"Well, yes. I'll grant she is an angel now. I was angry with her\nonce, you know. You men find so many angels in your travels. You have\nbeen honester than some. You have generally been off with the old\nangel before you were on with the new,--as far at least as I knew.\"\n\n\"Is that meant for rebuke, Lady Laura?\"\n\n\"No, my friend; no. That is all over. I said to myself when you told\nme that you would come, that I would not utter one ill-natured word.\nAnd I told myself more than that!\"\n\n\"What more?\"\n\n\"That you had never deserved it,--at least from me. But surely you\nwere the most simple of men.\"\n\n\"I dare say.\"\n\n\"Men when they are true are simple. They are often false as hell,\nand then they are crafty as Lucifer. But the man who is true judges\nothers by himself,--almost without reflection. A woman can be true as\nsteel and cunning at the same time. How cunning was Violet, and yet\nshe never deceived one of her lovers, even by a look. Did she?\"\n\n\"She never deceived me,--if you mean that. She never cared a straw\nabout me, and told me so to my face very plainly.\"\n\n\"She did care,--many straws. But I think she always loved Oswald. She\nrefused him again and again, because she thought it wrong to run a\ngreat risk, but I knew she would never marry any one else. How little\nLady Baldock understood her. Fancy your meeting Lady Baldock at\nOswald's house!\"\n\n\"Fancy Augusta Boreham turning nun!\"\n\n\"How exquisitely grotesque it must have been when she made her\ncomplaint to you.\"\n\n\"I pitied her with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Of course you did,--because you are so soft. And now, Phineas, we\nwill put it off no longer. Tell me all that you have to tell me about\nhim.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nK\u00c3\u0096NIGSTEIN.\n\n\nPhineas Finn and Lady Laura Kennedy sat together discussing the\naffairs of the past till the servant told them that \"My Lord\" was in\nthe next room, and ready to receive Mr. Finn. \"You will find him much\naltered,\" said Lady Laura, \"even more than I am.\"\n\n\"I do not find you altered at all.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do,--in appearance. I am a middle-aged woman, and conscious\nthat I may use my privileges as such. But he has become quite an old\nman,--not in health so much as in manner. But he will be very glad to\nsee you.\" So saying she led him into a room, in which he found the\nEarl seated near the fireplace, and wrapped in furs. He got up to\nreceive his guest, and Phineas saw at once that during the two years\nof his exile from England Lord Brentford had passed from manhood to\nsenility. He almost tottered as he came forward, and he wrapped his\ncoat around him with that air of studious self-preservation which\nbelongs only to the infirm.\n\n\"It is very good of you to come and see me, Mr. Finn,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't call him Mr. Finn, Papa. I call him Phineas.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; that's all right, I dare say. It's a terrible long\njourney from London, isn't it, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Too long to be pleasant, my lord.\"\n\n\"Pleasant! Oh, dear. There's no pleasantness about it. And so they've\ngot an autumn session, have they? That's always a very stupid thing\nto do, unless they want money.\"\n\n\"But there is a money bill which must be passed. That's Mr. Daubeny's\nexcuse.\"\n\n\"Ah, if they've a money bill of course it's all right. So you're in\nParliament again?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to say I'm not.\" Then Lady Laura explained to her father,\nprobably for the third or fourth time, exactly what was their guest's\nposition. \"Oh, a scrutiny. We didn't use to have any scrutinies at\nLoughton, did we? Ah, me; well, everything seems to be going to\nthe dogs. I'm told they're attacking the Church now.\" Lady Laura\nglanced at Phineas; but neither of them said a word. \"I don't\nquite understand it; but they tell me that the Tories are going to\ndisestablish the Church. I'm very glad I'm out of it all. Things\nhave come to such a pass that I don't see how a gentleman is to hold\noffice now-a-days. Have you seen Chiltern lately?\"\n\nAfter a while, when Phineas had told the Earl all that there was\nto tell of his son and his grandson, and all of politics and of\nParliament, Lady Laura suddenly interrupted them. \"You knew, Papa,\nthat he was to see Mr. Kennedy. He has been to Loughlinter, and has\nseen him.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\"\n\n\"He is quite assured that I could not with wisdom return to live with\nmy husband.\"\n\n\"It is a very grave decision to make,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"But he has no doubt about it,\" continued Lady Laura.\n\n\"Not a shadow of doubt,\" said Phineas. \"I will not say that Mr.\nKennedy is mad; but the condition of his mind is such in regard to\nLady Laura that I do not think she could live with him in safety. He\nis crazed about religion.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear,\" exclaimed the Earl.\n\n\"The gloom of his house is insupportable. And he does not pretend\nthat he desires her to return that he and she may be happy together.\"\n\n\"What for then?\"\n\n\"That we might be unhappy together,\" said Lady Laura.\n\n\"He repudiates all belief in happiness. He wishes her to return to\nhim chiefly because it is right that a man and wife should live\ntogether.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"But not to the utter wretchedness of both of them,\" said Lady Laura.\n\"He says,\" and she pointed to Phineas, \"that were I there he would\nrenew his accusation against me. He has not told me all. Perhaps he\ncannot tell me all. But I certainly will not return to Loughlinter.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear.\"\n\n\"It is not very well, Papa; but, nevertheless, I will not return to\nLoughlinter. What I suffered there neither of you can understand.\"\n\nThat afternoon Phineas went out alone to the galleries, but the next\nday she accompanied him, and showed him whatever of glory the town\nhad to offer in its winter dress. They stood together before great\nmasters, and together examined small gems. And then from day to\nday they were always in each other's company. He had promised to\nstay a month, and during that time he was petted and comforted\nto his heart's content. Lady Laura would have taken him into the\nSaxon Switzerland, in spite of the inclemency of the weather and her\nfather's rebukes, had he not declared vehemently that he was happier\nremaining in the town. But she did succeed in carrying him off to the\nfortress of K\u00c3\u00b6nigstein; and there as they wandered along the fortress\nconstructed on that wonderful rock there occurred between them a\nconversation which he never forgot, and which it would not have been\neasy to forget. His own prospects had of course been frequently\ndiscussed. He had told her everything, down to the exact amount of\nmoney which he had to support him till he should again be enabled to\nearn an income, and had received assurances from her that everything\nwould be just as it should be after a lapse of a few months. The\nLiberals would, as a matter of course, come in, and equally as a\nmatter of course, Phineas would be in office. She spoke of this with\nsuch certainty that she almost convinced him. Having tempted him away\nfrom the safety of permanent income, the party could not do less than\nprovide for him. If he could only secure a seat he would be safe; and\nit seemed that Tankerville would be a certain seat. This certainty he\nwould not admit; but, nevertheless, he was comforted by his friend.\nWhen you have done the rashest thing in the world it is very pleasant\nto be told that no man of spirit could have acted otherwise. It was a\nmatter of course that he should return to public life,--so said Lady\nLaura;--and doubly a matter of course when he found himself a widower\nwithout a child. \"Whether it be a bad life or a good life,\" said Lady\nLaura, \"you and I understand equally well that no other life is worth\nhaving after it. We are like the actors, who cannot bear to be away\nfrom the gaslights when once they have lived amidst their glare.\" As\nshe said this they were leaning together over one of the parapets of\nthe great fortress, and the sadness of the words struck him as they\nbore upon herself. She also had lived amidst the gaslights, and now\nshe was self-banished into absolute obscurity. \"You could not have\nbeen content with your life in Dublin,\" she said.\n\n\"Are you content with your life in Dresden?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. We all like exercise; but the man who has had his\nleg cut off can't walk. Some can walk with safety; others only with\na certain peril; and others cannot at all. You are in the second\nposition, but I am in the last.\"\n\n\"I do not see why you should not return.\"\n\n\"And if I did what would come of it? In place of the seclusion\nof Dresden, there would be the seclusion of Portman Square or of\nSaulsby. Who would care to have me at their houses, or to come to\nmine? You know what a hazardous, chancy, short-lived thing is the\nfashion of a woman. With wealth, and wit, and social charm, and\nimpudence, she may preserve it for some years, but when she has once\nlost it she can never recover it. I am as much lost to the people who\ndid know me in London as though I had been buried for a century. A\nman makes himself really useful, but a woman can never do that.\"\n\n\"All those general rules mean nothing,\" said Phineas. \"I should try\nit.\"\n\n\"No, Phineas. I know better than that. It would only be\ndisappointment. I hardly think that after all you ever did understand\nwhen it was that I broke down utterly and marred my fortunes for\never.\"\n\n\"I know the day that did it.\"\n\n\"When I accepted him?\"\n\n\"Of course it was. I know that, and so do you. There need be no\nsecret between us.\"\n\n\"There need be no secret between us certainly,--and on my part there\nshall be none. On my part there has been none.\"\n\n\"Nor on mine.\"\n\n\"There has been nothing for you to tell,--since you blurted out your\nshort story of love that day over the waterfall, when I tried so hard\nto stop you.\"\n\n\"How was I to be stopped then?\"\n\n\"No; you were too simple. You came there with but one idea, and you\ncould not change it on the spur of the moment. When I told you that\nI was engaged you could not swallow back the words that were not yet\nspoken. Ah, how well I remember it. But you are wrong, Phineas. It\nwas not my engagement or my marriage that has made the world a blank\nfor me.\" A feeling came upon him which half-choked him, so that he\ncould ask her no further question. \"You know that, Phineas.\"\n\n\"It was your marriage,\" he said, gruffly.\n\n\"It was, and has been, and still will be my strong, unalterable,\nunquenchable love for you. How could I behave to that other man with\neven seeming tenderness when my mind was always thinking of you, when\nmy heart was always fixed upon you? But you have been so simple, so\nlittle given to vanity,\"--she leaned upon his arm as she spoke,--\"so\npure and so manly, that you have not believed this, even when I told\nyou. Has it not been so?\"\n\n\"I do not wish to believe it now.\"\n\n\"But you do believe it? You must and shall believe it. I ask for\nnothing in return. As my God is my judge, if I thought it possible\nthat your heart should be to me as mine is to you, I could have\nput a pistol to my ear sooner than speak as I have spoken.\" Though\nshe paused for some word from him he could not utter a word. He\nremembered many things, but even to her in his present mood he could\nnot allude to them;--how he had kissed her at the Falls, how she had\nbade him not come back to the house because his presence to her was\ninsupportable; how she had again encouraged him to come, and had\nthen forbidden him to accept even an invitation to dinner from her\nhusband. And he remembered too the fierceness of her anger to him\nwhen he told her of his love for Violet Effingham. \"I must insist\nupon it,\" she continued, \"that you shall take me now as I really\nam,--as your dearest friend, your sister, your mother, if you will.\nI know what I am. Were my husband not still living it would be the\nsame. I should never under any circumstances marry again. I have\npassed the period of a woman's life when as a woman she is loved;\nbut I have not outlived the power of loving. I shall fret about you,\nPhineas, like an old hen after her one chick; and though you turn\nout to be a duck, and get away into waters where I cannot follow\nyou, I shall go cackling round the pond, and always have my eye upon\nyou.\" He was holding her now by the hand, but he could not speak\nfor the tears were trickling down his cheeks. \"When I was young,\"\nshe continued, \"I did not credit myself with capacity for so much\npassion. I told myself that love after all should be a servant and\nnot a master, and I married my husband fully intending to do my duty\nto him. Now we see what has come of it.\"\n\n\"It has been his fault; not yours,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"It was my fault,--mine; for I never loved him. Had you not told me\nwhat manner of man he was before? And I had believed you, though I\ndenied it. And I knew when I went to Loughlinter that it was you whom\nI loved. And I knew too,--I almost knew that you would ask me to be\nyour wife were not that other thing settled first. And I declared to\nmyself that, in spite of both our hearts, it should not be so. I had\nno money then,--nor had you.\"\n\n\"I would have worked for you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; but you must not reproach me now, Phineas. I never deserted\nyou as regarded your interests, though what little love you had\nfor me was short-lived indeed. Nay; you are not accused, and shall\nnot excuse yourself. You were right,--always right. When you had\nfailed to win one woman your heart with a true natural spring went to\nanother. And so entire had been the cure, that you went to the first\nwoman with the tale of your love for the second.\"\n\n\"To whom was I to go but to a friend?\"\n\n\"You did come to a friend, and though I could not drive out of my\nheart the demon of jealousy, though I was cut to the very bone, I\nwould have helped you had help been possible. Though it had been the\nfixed purpose of my life that Violet and Oswald should be man and\nwife, I would have helped you because that other purpose of serving\nyou in all things had become more fixed. But it was to no good end\nthat I sang your praises. Violet Effingham was not the girl to marry\nthis man or that at the bidding of any one;--was she?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"It is of no use now talking of it; is it? But I want you to\nunderstand me from the beginning;--to understand all that was evil,\nand anything that was good. Since first I found that you were to me\nthe dearest of human beings I have never once been untrue to your\ninterests, though I have been unable not to be angry with you. Then\ncame that wonderful episode in which you saved my husband's life.\"\n\n\"Not his life.\"\n\n\"Was it not singular that it should come from your hand? It seemed\nlike Fate. I tried to use the accident, to make his friendship for\nyou as thorough as my own. And then I was obliged to separate you,\nbecause,--because, after all I was so mere a woman that I could not\nbear to have you near me. I can bear it now.\"\n\n\"Dear Laura!\"\n\n\"Yes; as your sister. I think you cannot but love me a little when\nyou know how entirely I am devoted to you. I can bear to have you\nnear me now and think of you only as the hen thinks of her duckling.\nFor a moment you are out of the pond, and I have gathered you under\nmy wing. You understand?\"\n\n\"I know that I am unworthy of what you say of me.\"\n\n\"Worth has nothing to do with it,--has no bearing on it. I do not say\nthat you are more worthy than all whom I have known. But when did\nworth create love? What I want is that you should believe me, and\nknow that there is one bound to you who will never be unbound, one\nwhom you can trust in all things,--one to whom you can confess that\nyou have been wrong if you go wrong, and yet be sure that you will\nnot lessen her regard. And with this feeling you must pretend to\nnothing more than friendship. You will love again, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Of course you will. I tried to blaze into power by a marriage, and\nI failed,--because I was a woman. A woman should marry only for\nlove. You will do it yet, and will not fail. You may remember this\ntoo,--that I shall never be jealous again. You may tell me everything\nwith safety. You will tell me everything?\"\n\n\"If there be anything to tell, I will.\"\n\n\"I will never stand between you and your wife,--though I would fain\nhope that she should know how true a friend I am. Now we have walked\nhere till it is dark, and the sentry will think we are taking plans\nof the place. Are you cold?\"\n\n\"I have not thought about the cold.\"\n\n\"Nor have I. We will go down to the inn and warm ourselves before the\ntrain comes. I wonder why I should have brought you here to tell you\nmy story. Oh, Phineas.\" Then she threw herself into his arms, and he\npressed her to his heart, and kissed first her forehead and then her\nlips. \"It shall never be so again,\" she said. \"I will kill it out\nof my heart even though I should crucify my body. But it is not my\nlove that I will kill. When you are happy I will be happy. When you\nprosper I will prosper. When you fail I will fail. When you rise,--as\nyou will rise,--I will rise with you. But I will never again feel the\npressure of your arm round my waist. Here is the gate, and the old\nguide. So, my friend, you see that we are not lost.\" Then they walked\ndown the very steep hill to the little town below the fortress, and\nthere they remained till the evening train came from Prague, and took\nthem back to Dresden.\n\nTwo days after this was the day fixed for Finn's departure. On\nthe intermediate day the Earl begged for a few minutes' private\nconversation with him, and the two were closeted together for an\nhour. The Earl, in truth, had little or nothing to say. Things had\nso gone with him that he had hardly a will of his own left, and did\nsimply that which his daughter directed him to do. He pretended to\nconsult Phineas as to the expediency of his returning to Saulsby.\nDid Phineas think that his return would be of any use to the party?\nPhineas knew very well that the party would not recognise the\ndifference whether the Earl lived at Dresden or in London. When a\nman has come to the end of his influence as the Earl had done he is\nas much a nothing in politics as though he had never risen above\nthat quantity. The Earl had never risen very high, and even Phineas,\nwith all his desire to be civil, could not say that the Earl's\npresence would materially serve the interests of the Liberal party.\nHe made what most civil excuses he could, and suggested that if Lord\nBrentford should choose to return, Lady Laura would very willingly\nremain at Dresden alone. \"But why shouldn't she come too?\" asked the\nEarl. And then, with the tardiness of old age, he proposed his little\nplan. \"Why should she not make an attempt to live once more with her\nhusband?\"\n\n\"She never will,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"But think how much she loses,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"I am quite sure she never will. And I am quite sure that she ought\nnot to do so. The marriage was a misfortune. As it is they are better\napart.\" After that the Earl did not dare to say another word about\nhis daughter; but discussed his son's affairs. Did not Phineas think\nthat Chiltern might now be induced to go into Parliament? \"Nothing\nwould make him do so,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"But he might farm?\"\n\n\"You see he has his hands full.\"\n\n\"But other men keep hounds and farm too,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"But Chiltern is not like other men. He gives his whole mind to it,\nand finds full employment. And then he is quite happy, and so is she.\nWhat more can you want for him? Everybody respects him.\"\n\n\"That goes a very great way,\" said the Earl. Then he thanked Phineas\ncordially, and felt that now as ever he had done his duty by his\nfamily.\n\nThere was no renewal of the passionate conversation which had taken\nplace on the ramparts, but much of tenderness and of sympathy arose\nfrom it. Lady Laura took upon herself the tone and manners of an\nelder sister,--of a sister very much older than her brother,--and\nPhineas submitted to them not only gracefully but with delight to\nhimself. He had not thanked her for her love when she expressed it,\nand he did not do so afterwards. But he accepted it, and bowed to it,\nand recognised it as constituting one of the future laws of his life.\nHe was to do nothing of importance without her knowledge, and he\nwas to be at her command should she at any time want assistance in\nEngland. \"I suppose I shall come back some day,\" she said, as they\nwere sitting together late on the evening before his departure.\n\n\"I cannot understand why you should not do so now. Your father wishes\nit.\"\n\n\"He thinks he does; but were he told that he was to go to-morrow, or\nnext summer, it would fret him. I am assured that Mr. Kennedy could\ndemand my return,--by law.\"\n\n\"He could not enforce it.\"\n\n\"He would attempt it. I will not go back until he consents to my\nliving apart from him. And, to tell the truth, I am better here for\nawhile. They say that the sick animals always creep somewhere under\ncover. I am a sick animal, and now that I have crept here I will\nremain till I am stronger. How terribly anxious you must be about\nTankerville!\"\n\n\"I am anxious.\"\n\n\"You will telegraph to me at once? You will be sure to do that?\"\n\n\"Of course I will, the moment I know my fate.\"\n\n\"And if it goes against you?\"\n\n\"Ah,--what then?\"\n\n\"I shall at once write to Barrington Erle. I don't suppose he would\ndo much now for his poor cousin, but he can at any rate say what can\nbe done. I should bid you come here,--only that stupid people would\nsay that you were my lover. I should not mind, only that he would\nhear it, and I am bound to save him from annoyance. Would you not go\ndown to Oswald again?\"\n\n\"With what object?\"\n\n\"Because anything will be better than returning to Ireland. Why not\ngo down and look after Saulsby? It would be a home, and you need not\ntie yourself to it. I will speak to Papa about that. But you will get\nthe seat.\"\n\n\"I think I shall,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Do;--pray do! If I could only get hold of that judge by the ears!\nDo you know what time it is? It is twelve, and your train starts at\neight.\" Then he arose to bid her adieu. \"No,\" she said; \"I shall see\nyou off.\"\n\n\"Indeed you will not. It will be almost night when I leave this, and\nthe frost is like iron.\"\n\n\"Neither the night nor the frost will kill me. Do you think I will\nnot give you your last breakfast? God bless you, dear.\"\n\nAnd on the following morning she did give him his breakfast by\ncandle-light, and went down with him to the station. The morning was\nblack, and the frost was, as he had said, as hard as iron, but she\nwas thoroughly good-humoured, and apparently happy. \"It has been so\nmuch to me to have you here, that I might tell you everything,\" she\nsaid. \"You will understand me now.\"\n\n\"I understand, but I know not how to believe,\" he said.\n\n\"You do believe. You would be worse than a Jew if you did not believe\nme. But you understand also. I want you to marry, and you must tell\nher all the truth. If I can I will love her almost as much as I do\nyou. And if I live to see them, I will love your children as dearly\nas I do you. Your children shall be my children;--or at least one of\nthem shall be mine. You will tell me when it is to be.\"\n\n\"If I ever intend such a thing, I will tell you.\"\n\n\"Now, good-bye. I shall stand back there till the train starts, but\ndo not you notice me. God bless you, Phineas.\" She held his hand\ntight within her own for some seconds, and looked into his face with\nan unutterable love. Then she drew down her veil, and went and stood\napart till the train had left the platform.\n\n\"He has gone, Papa,\" Lady Laura said, as she stood afterwards by her\nfather's bedside.\n\n\"Has he? Yes; I know he was to go, of course. I was very glad to see\nhim, Laura.\"\n\n\"So was I, Papa;--very glad indeed. Whatever happens to him, we must\nnever lose sight of him again.\"\n\n\"We shall hear of him, of course, if he is in the House.\"\n\n\"Whether he is in the House or out of it we must hear of him. While\nwe have aught he must never want.\" The Earl stared at his daughter.\nThe Earl was a man of large possessions, and did not as yet\nunderstand that he was to be called upon to share them with Phineas\nFinn. \"I know, Papa, you will never think ill of me.\"\n\n\"Never, my dear.\"\n\n\"I have sworn that I will be a sister to that man, and I will keep my\noath.\"\n\n\"I know you are a very good sister to Chiltern,\" said the Earl. Lady\nLaura had at one time appropriated her whole fortune, which had been\nlarge, to the payment of her brother's debts. The money had been\nreturned, and had gone to her husband. Lord Brentford now supposed\nthat she intended at some future time to pay the debts of Phineas\nFinn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\"I HAVE GOT THE SEAT.\"\n\n\nWhen Phineas returned to London, the autumn Session, though it had\nbeen carried on so near to Christmas as to make many members very\nunhappy, had already been over for a fortnight. Mr. Daubeny had\nplayed his game with consummate skill to the last. He had brought\nin no bill, but had stated his intention of doing so early in the\nfollowing Session. He had, he said, of course been aware from the\nfirst that it would have been quite impossible to carry such a\nmeasure as that proposed during the few weeks in which it had been\npossible for them to sit between the convening of Parliament and the\nChristmas holidays; but he thought that it was expedient that the\nproposition should be named to the House and ventilated as it had\nbeen, so that members on both sides might be induced to give their\nmost studious attention to the subject before a measure, which\nmust be so momentous, should be proposed to them. As had happened,\nthe unforeseen division to which the House had been pressed on the\nAddress had proved that the majority of the House was in favour of\nthe great reform which it was the object of his ambition to complete.\nThey were aware that they had been assembled at a somewhat unusual\nand inconvenient period of the year, because the service of the\ncountry had demanded that certain money bills should be passed. He,\nhowever, rejoiced greatly that this earliest opportunity had been\nafforded to him of explaining the intentions of the Government with\nwhich he had the honour of being connected. In answer to this there\narose a perfect torrent of almost vituperative antagonism from the\nopposite side of the House. Did the Right Honourable gentleman dare\nto say that the question had been ventilated in the country, when it\nhad never been broached by him or any of his followers till after\nthe general election had been completed? Was it not notorious to\nthe country that the first hint of it had been given when the Right\nHonourable gentleman was elected for East Barsetshire, and was it not\nequally notorious that that election had been so arranged that the\nmarvellous proposition of the Right Honourable gentleman should not\nbe known even to his own party till there remained no possibility\nof the expression of any condemnation from the hustings? It might\nbe that the Right Honourable could so rule his own followers in\nthat House as to carry them with him even in a matter so absolutely\nopposite to their own most cherished convictions. It certainly seemed\nthat he had succeeded in doing so for the present. But would any one\nbelieve that he would have carried the country, had he dared to face\nthe country with such a measure in his hands? Ventilation, indeed! He\nhad not dared to ventilate his proposition. He had used this short\nSession in order that he might keep his clutch fastened on power, and\nin doing so was indifferent alike to the Constitution, to his party,\nand to the country. Harder words had never been spoken in the House\nthan were uttered on this occasion. But the Minister was successful.\nHe had been supported on the Address; and he went home to East\nBarsetshire at Christmas, perhaps with some little fear of the\nparsons around him; but with a full conviction that he would at least\ncarry the second reading of his bill.\n\nLondon was more than usually full and busy this year immediately\nafter Christmas. It seemed as though it were admitted by all the\nLiberal party generally that the sadness of the occasion ought to\nrob the season of its usual festivities. Who could eat mince pies\nor think of Twelfth Night while so terribly wicked a scheme was in\nprogress for keeping the real majority out in the cold? It was the\ninjustice of the thing that rankled so deeply,--that, and a sense\nof inferiority to the cleverness displayed by Mr. Daubeny! It was\nas when a player is checkmated by some audacious combination of\ntwo pawns and a knight, such being all the remaining forces of the\nvictorious adversary, when the beaten man has two castles and a queen\nupon the board. It was, indeed, worse than this,--for the adversary\nhad appropriated to his own use the castles and the queen of the\nunhappy vanquished one. This Church Reform was the legitimate\nproperty of the Liberals, and had not been as yet used by them only\nbecause they had felt it right to keep in the background for some\nfuture great occasion so great and so valuable a piece of ordnance.\nIt was theirs so safely that they could afford to bide their time.\nAnd then,--so they all said, and so some of them believed,--the\ncountry was not ready for so great a measure. It must come; but there\nmust be tenderness in the mode of producing it. The parsons must be\nrespected, and the great Church-of-England feeling of the people must\nbe considered with affectionate regard. Even the most rabid Dissenter\nwould hardly wish to see a structure so nearly divine attacked and\ndestroyed by rude hands. With grave and slow and sober earnestness,\nwith loving touches and soft caressing manipulation let the beautiful\nold Church be laid to its rest, as something too exquisite, too\nlovely, too refined for the present rough manners of the world! Such\nwere the ideas as to Church Reform of the leading Liberals of the\nday; and now this man, without even a majority to back him, this\naudacious Cagliostro among statesmen, this destructive leader of all\ndeclared Conservatives, had come forward without a moment's warning,\nand pretended that he would do the thing out of hand! Men knew that\nit had to be done. The country had begun to perceive that the old\nEstablishment must fall; and, knowing this, would not the Liberal\nbackbone of Great Britain perceive the enormity of this Cagliostro's\nwickedness,--and rise against him and bury him beneath its scorn\nas it ought to do? This was the feeling that made a real Christmas\nimpossible to Messrs. Ratler and Bonteen.\n\n\"The one thing incredible to me,\" said Mr. Ratler, \"is that\nEnglishmen should be so mean.\" He was alluding to the Conservatives\nwho had shown their intention of supporting Mr. Daubeny, and whom\nhe accused of doing so, simply with a view to power and patronage,\nwithout any regard to their own consistency or to the welfare of\nthe country. Mr. Ratler probably did not correctly read the minds\nof the men whom he was accusing, and did not perceive, as he should\nhave done with his experience, how little there was among them of\nconcerted action. To defend the Church was a duty to each of them;\nbut then, so also was it a duty to support his party. And each one\ncould see his way to the one duty, whereas the other was vague, and\ntoo probably ultimately impossible. If it were proper to throw off\nthe incubus of this conjuror's authority, surely some wise, and\ngreat, and bold man would get up and so declare. Some junto of wise\nmen of the party would settle that he should be deposed. But where\nwere they to look for the wise and bold men? where even for the\njunto? Of whom did the party consist?--Of honest, chivalrous, and\nenthusiastic men, but mainly of men who were idle, and unable to\ntake upon their own shoulders the responsibility of real work. Their\nleaders had been selected from the outside,--clever, eager, pushing\nmen, but of late had been hardly selected from among themselves. As\nused to be the case with Italian Powers, they entrusted their cause\nto mercenary foreign generals, soldiers of fortune, who carried their\ngood swords whither they were wanted; and, as of old, the leaders\nwere ever ready to fight, but would themselves declare what should\nbe and what should not be the _casus belli_. There was not so much\nmeanness as Mr. Ratler supposed in the Conservative ranks, but very\nmuch more unhappiness. Would it not be better to go home and live\nat the family park all the year round, and hunt, and attend Quarter\nSessions, and be able to declare morning and evening with a clear\nconscience that the country was going to the dogs? Such was the\nmental working of many a Conservative who supported Mr. Daubeny on\nthis occasion.\n\nAt the instance of Lady Laura, Phineas called upon the Duke of St.\nBungay soon after his return, and was very kindly received by his\nGrace. In former days, when there were Whigs instead of Liberals, it\nwas almost a rule of political life that all leading Whigs should be\nuncles, brothers-in-law, or cousins to each other. This was pleasant\nand gave great consistency to the party; but the system has now gone\nout of vogue. There remain of it, however, some traces, so that among\nthe nobler born Liberals of the day there is still a good deal of\nagreeable family connection. In this way the St. Bungay Fitz-Howards\nwere related to the Mildmays and Standishes, and such a man as\nBarrington Erle was sure to be cousin to all of them. Lady Laura\nhad thus only sent her friend to a relation of her own, and as the\nDuke and Phineas had been in the same Government, his Grace was\nglad enough to receive the returning aspirant. Of course there was\nsomething said at first as to the life of the Earl at Dresden. The\nDuke recollected the occasion of such banishment, and shook his head;\nand attempted to look unhappy when the wretched condition of Mr.\nKennedy was reported to him. But he was essentially a happy man, and\nshook off the gloom at once when Phineas spoke of politics. \"So you\nare coming back to us, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"They tell me I may perhaps get the seat.\"\n\n\"I am heartily glad, for you were very useful. I remember how Cantrip\nalmost cried when he told me you were going to leave him. He had been\nrather put upon, I fancy, before.\"\n\n\"There was perhaps something in that, your Grace.\"\n\n\"There will be nothing to return to now beyond barren honours.\"\n\n\"Not for a while.\"\n\n\"Not for a long while,\" said the Duke;--\"for a long while, that is,\nas candidates for office regard time. Mr. Daubeny will be safe for\nthis Session at least. I doubt whether he will really attempt to\ncarry his measure this year. He will bring it forward, and after the\nlate division he must get his second reading. He will then break\ndown gracefully in Committee, and declare that the importance of the\ninterests concerned demands further inquiry. It wasn't a thing to be\ndone in one year.\"\n\n\"Why should he do it at all?\" asked Phineas.\n\n\"That's what everybody asks, but the answer seems to be so plain!\nBecause he can do it, and we can't. He will get from our side much\nsupport, and we should get none from his.\"\n\n\"There is something to me sickening in their dishonesty,\" said\nPhineas energetically.\n\n\"The country has the advantage; and I don't know that they are\ndishonest. Ought we to come to a deadlock in legislation in order\nthat parties might fight out their battle till one had killed the\nother?\"\n\n\"I don't think a man should support a measure which he believes to be\ndestructive.\"\n\n\"He doesn't believe it to be destructive. The belief is\ntheoretic,--or not even quite that. It is hardly more than romantic.\nAs long as acres are dear, and he can retain those belonging to him,\nthe country gentleman will never really believe his country to be in\ndanger. It is the same with commerce. As long as the Three per Cents.\ndo not really mean Four per Cent.,--I may say as long as they don't\nmean Five per Cent.,--the country will be rich, though every one\nshould swear that it be ruined.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad, at the same time, that I don't call myself a\nConservative,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"That shows how disinterested you are, as you certainly would be\nin office. Good-bye. Come and see the Duchess when she comes to\ntown. And if you've nothing better to do, give us a day or two at\nLongroyston at Easter.\" Now Longroyston was the Duke's well-known\ncountry seat, at which Whig hospitality had been dispensed with a\nlavish hand for two centuries.\n\nOn the 20th January Phineas travelled down to Tankerville again in\nobedience to a summons served upon him at the instance of the judge\nwho was to try his petition against Browborough. It was the special\nand somewhat unusual nature of this petition that the complainants\nnot only sought to oust the sitting member, but also to give the\nseat to the late unsuccessful candidate. There was to be a scrutiny,\nby which, if it should be successful, so great a number of votes\nwould be deducted from those polled on behalf of the unfortunate\nMr. Browborough as to leave a majority for his opponent, with the\nadditional disagreeable obligation upon him of paying the cost of the\ntransaction by which he would thus lose his seat. Mr. Browborough,\nno doubt, looked upon the whole thing with the greatest disgust. He\nthought that a battle when once won should be regarded as over till\nthe occasion should come for another battle. He had spent his money\nlike a gentleman, and hated these mean ways. No one could ever say\nthat he had ever petitioned. That was his way of looking at it. That\nShibboleth of his as to the prospects of England and the Church of\nher people had, no doubt, made the House less agreeable to him during\nthe last Short session than usual; but he had stuck to his party, and\nvoted with Mr. Daubeny on the Address,--the obligation for such vote\nhaving inconveniently pressed itself upon him before the presentation\nof the petition had been formally completed. He had always stuck to\nhis party. It was the pride of his life that he had been true and\nconsistent. He also was summoned to Tankerville, and he was forced\nto go, although he knew that the Shibboleth would be thrown in his\nteeth.\n\nMr. Browborough spent two or three very uncomfortable days at\nTankerville, whereas Phineas was triumphant. There were worse things\nin store for poor Mr. Browborough than his repudiated Shibboleth, or\neven than his lost seat. Mr. Ruddles, acting with wondrous energy,\nsucceeded in knocking off the necessary votes, and succeeded also in\nproving that these votes were void by reason of gross bribery. He\nastonished Phineas by the cool effrontery with which he took credit\nto himself for not having purchased votes in the Fallgate on the\nLiberal side, but Phineas was too wise to remind him that he himself\nhad hinted at one time that it would be well to lay out a little\nmoney in that way. No one at the present moment was more clear than\nwas Ruddles as to the necessity of purity at elections. Not a penny\nhad been misspent by the Finnites. A vote or two from their score\nwas knocked off on grounds which did not touch the candidate or his\nagents. One man had personated a vote, but this appeared to have been\ndone at the instigation of some very cunning Browborough partisan.\nAnother man had been wrongly described. This, however, amounted to\nnothing. Phineas Finn was seated for the borough, and the judge\ndeclared his purpose of recommending the House of Commons to issue\na commission with reference to the expediency of instituting a\nprosecution. Mr. Browborough left the town in great disgust, not\nwithout various publicly expressed intimations from his opponents\nthat the prosperity of England depended on the Church of her people.\nPhineas was gloriously entertained by the Liberals of the borough,\nand then informed that as so much had been done for him it was hoped\nthat he would now open his pockets on behalf of the charities of\nthe town. \"Gentlemen,\" said Phineas, to one or two of the leading\nLiberals, \"it is as well that you should know at once that I am a\nvery poor man.\" The leading Liberals made wry faces, but Phineas was\nmember for the borough.\n\nThe moment that the decision was announced, Phineas, shaking off for\nthe time his congratulatory friends, hurried to the post-office and\nsent his message to Lady Laura Standish at Dresden: \"I have got the\nseat.\" He was almost ashamed of himself as the telegraph boy looked\nup at him when he gave in the words, but this was a task which he\ncould not have entrusted to any one else. He almost thought that this\nwas in truth the proudest and happiest moment of his life. She would\nso thoroughly enjoy his triumph, would receive from it such great\nand unselfish joy, that he almost wished that he could have taken\nthe message himself. Surely had he done so there would have been fit\noccasion for another embrace.\n\nHe was again a member of the British House of Commons,--was again in\npossession of that privilege for which he had never ceased to sigh\nsince the moment in which he lost it. A drunkard or a gambler may be\nweaned from his ways, but not a politician. To have been in the House\nand not to be there was, to such a one as Phineas Finn, necessarily\na state of discontent. But now he had worked his way up again, and\nhe was determined that no fears for the future should harass him. He\nwould give his heart and soul to the work while his money lasted. It\nwould surely last him for the Session. He was all alone in the world,\nand would trust to the chapter of accidents for the future.\n\n\"I never knew a fellow with such luck as yours,\" said Barrington Erle\nto him, on his return to London. \"A seat always drops into your mouth\nwhen the circumstances seem to be most forlorn.\"\n\n\"I have been lucky, certainly.\"\n\n\"My cousin, Laura Kennedy, has been writing to me about you.\"\n\n\"I went over to see them, you know.\"\n\n\"So I heard. She talks some nonsense about the Earl being willing to\ndo anything for you. What could the Earl do? He has no more influence\nin the Loughton borough than I have. All that kind of thing is clean\ndone for,--with one or two exceptions. We got much better men while\nit lasted than we do now.\"\n\n\"I should doubt that.\"\n\n\"We did;--much truer men,--men who went straighter. By the bye,\nPhineas, we must have no tricks on this Church matter. We mean to do\nall we can to throw out the second reading.\"\n\n\"You know what I said at the hustings.\"\n\n\"D---- the hustings. I know what Browborough said, and Browborough\nvoted like a man with his party. You were against the Church at the\nhustings, and he was for it. You will vote just the other way. There\nwill be a little confusion, but the people of Tankerville will never\nremember the particulars.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I can do that.\"\n\n\"By heavens, if you don't, you shall never more be officer of\nours,--though Laura Kennedy should cry her eyes out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTRUMPETON WOOD.\n\n\nIn the meantime the hunting season was going on in the Brake country\nwith chequered success. There had arisen the great Trumpeton Wood\nquestion, about which the sporting world was doomed to hear so much\nfor the next twelve months,--and Lord Chiltern was in an unhappy\nstate of mind. Trumpeton Wood belonged to that old friend of ours,\nthe Duke of Omnium, who had now almost fallen into second childhood.\nIt was quite out of the question that the Duke should himself\ninterfere in such a matter, or know anything about it; but Lord\nChiltern, with headstrong resolution, had persisted in writing to the\nDuke himself. Foxes had always hitherto been preserved in Trumpeton\nWood, and the earths had always been stopped on receipt of due notice\nby the keepers. During the cubbing season there had arisen quarrels.\nThe keepers complained that no effort was made to kill the foxes.\nLord Chiltern swore that the earths were not stopped. Then there came\ntidings of a terrible calamity. A dying fox, with a trap to its pad,\nwas found in the outskirts of the Wood; and Lord Chiltern wrote to\nthe Duke. He drew the Wood in regular course before any answer could\nbe received,--and three of his hounds picked up poison, and died\nbeneath his eyes. He wrote to the Duke again,--a cutting letter; and\nthen came from the Duke's man of business, Mr. Fothergill, a very\nshort reply, which Lord Chiltern regarded as an insult. Hitherto the\naffair had not got into the sporting papers, and was simply a matter\nof angry discussion at every meet in the neighbouring counties. Lord\nChiltern was very full of wrath, and always looked as though he\ndesired to avenge those poor hounds on the Duke and all belonging\nto him. To a Master of Hounds the poisoning of one of his pack is\nmurder of the deepest dye. There probably never was a Master who in\nhis heart of hearts would not think it right that a detected culprit\nshould be hung for such an offence. And most Masters would go further\nthan this, and declare that in the absence of such detection the\nowner of the covert in which the poison had been picked up should be\nheld to be responsible. In this instance the condition of ownership\nwas unfortunate. The Duke himself was old, feeble, and almost\nimbecile. He had never been eminent as a sportsman; but, in a not\nenergetic manner, he had endeavoured to do his duty by the country.\nHis heir, Plantagenet Palliser, was simply a statesman, who, as\nregarded himself, had never a day to spare for amusement; and who, in\nreference to sport, had unfortunate fantastic notions that pheasants\nand rabbits destroyed crops, and that foxes were injurious to old\nwomen's poultry. He, however, was not the owner, and had refused\nto interfere. There had been family quarrels too, adverse to the\nsporting interests of the younger Palliser scions, so that the\nshooting of this wood had drifted into the hands of Mr. Fothergill\nand his friends. Now, Lord Chiltern had settled it in his own mind\nthat the hounds had been poisoned, if not in compliance with Mr.\nFothergill's orders, at any rate in furtherance of his wishes,\nand, could he have had his way, he certainly would have sent Mr.\nFothergill to the gallows. Now, Miss Palliser, who was still staying\nat Lord Chiltern's house, was niece to the old Duke, and first cousin\nto the heir. \"They are nothing to me,\" she said once, when Lord\nChiltern had attempted to apologise for the abuse he was heaping on\nher relatives. \"I haven't seen the Duke since I was a little child,\nand I shouldn't know my cousin were I to meet him.\"\n\n\"So much the more gracious is your condition,\" said Lady\nChiltern,--\"at any rate in Oswald's estimation.\"\n\n\"I know them, and once spent a couple of days at Matching with them,\"\nsaid Lord Chiltern. \"The Duke is an old fool, who always gave himself\ngreater airs than any other man in England,--and as far as I can see,\nwith less to excuse them. As for Planty Pall, he and I belong so\nessentially to different orders of things, that we can hardly be\nreckoned as being both men.\"\n\n\"And which is the man, Lord Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Whichever you please, my dear; only not both. Doggett was over there\nyesterday, and found three separate traps.\"\n\n\"What did he do with the traps?\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"I wasn't fool enough to ask him, but I don't in the least doubt that\nhe threw them into the water--or that he'd throw Palliser there too\nif he could get hold of him. As for taking the hounds to Trumpeton\nagain, I wouldn't do it if there were not another covert in the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Then leave it so, and have done with it,\" said his wife. \"I wouldn't\nfret as you do for what another man did with his own property, for\nall the foxes in England.\"\n\n\"That is because you understand nothing of hunting, my dear. A man's\nproperty is his own in one sense, but isn't his own in another. A man\ncan't do what he likes with his coverts.\"\n\n\"He can cut them down.\"\n\n\"But he can't let another pack hunt them, and he can't hunt them\nhimself. If he's in a hunting county he is bound to preserve foxes.\"\n\n\"What binds him, Oswald? A man can't be bound without a penalty.\"\n\n\"I should think it penalty enough for everybody to hate me. What are\nyou going to do about Phineas Finn?\"\n\n\"I have asked him to come on the 1st and stay till Parliament meets.\"\n\n\"And is that woman coming?\"\n\n\"There are two or three women coming.\"\n\n\"She with the German name, whom you made me dine with in Park Lane?\"\n\n\"Madame Max Goesler is coming. She brings her own horses, and they\nwill stand at Doggett's.\"\n\n\"They can't stand here, for there is not a stall.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry that my poor little fellow should incommode you,\" said\nMiss Palliser.\n\n\"You're a licensed offender,--though, upon my honour, I don't know\nwhether I ought to give a feed of oats to any one having a connection\nwith Trumpeton Wood. And what is Phineas to ride?\"\n\n\"He shall ride my horses,\" said Lady Chiltern, whose present\ncondition in life rendered hunting inopportune to her.\n\n\"Neither of them would carry him a mile. He wants about as good an\nanimal as you can put him upon. I don't know what I'm to do. It's all\nvery well for Laura to say that he must be mounted.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't refuse to give Mr. Finn a mount!\" said Lady Chiltern,\nalmost with dismay.\n\n\"I'd give him my right hand to ride, only it wouldn't carry him. I\ncan't make horses. Harry brought home that brown mare on Tuesday with\nan overreach that she won't get over this season. What the deuce they\ndo with their horses to knock them about so, I can't understand. I've\nkilled horses in my time, and ridden them to a stand-still, but I\nnever bruised them and battered them about as these fellows do.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better write to Mr. Finn, and tell him,\" said Lady\nChiltern, very gravely.\n\n\"Oh, Phineas Finn!\" said Lord Chiltern; \"oh, Phineas Finn! what a\npity it was that you and I didn't see the matter out when we stood\nopposite to each other on the sands at Blankenberg!\"\n\n\"Oswald,\" said his wife, getting up, and putting her arm over his\nshoulder, \"you know you would give your best horse to Mr. Finn,\nas long as he chose to stay here, though you rode upon a donkey\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I know that if I didn't, you would,\" said Lord Chiltern. And so the\nmatter was settled.\n\nAt night, when they were alone together, there was further discussion\nas to the visitors who were coming to Harrington Hall. \"Is Gerard\nMaule to come back?\" asked the husband.\n\n\"I have asked him. He left his horses at Doggett's, you know.\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"I certainly told you, Oswald. Do you object to his coming? You can't\nreally mean that you care about his riding?\"\n\n\"It isn't that. You must have some whipping post, and he's as good\nas another. But he shilly-shallies about that girl. I hate all that\nstuff like poison.\"\n\n\"All men are not so--abrupt shall I say?--as you were.\"\n\n\"I had something to say, and I said it. When I had said it a dozen\ntimes, I got to have it believed. He doesn't say it as though he\nmeant to have it believed.\"\n\n\"You were always in earnest, Oswald.\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"To the extent of the three minutes which you allowed yourself. It\nsufficed, however;--did it not? You are glad you persevered?\"\n\n\"What fools women are.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Say you are glad. I like you to tell me so. Let me\nbe a fool if I will.\"\n\n\"What made you so obstinate?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I never could tell. It wasn't that I didn't dote upon\nyou, and think about you, and feel quite sure that there never could\nbe any other one than you.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt it was all right;--only you very nearly made me shoot\na fellow, and now I've got to find horses for him. I wonder whether\nhe could ride Dandolo?\"\n\n\"Don't put him up on anything very hard.\"\n\n\"Why not? His wife is dead, and he hasn't got a child, nor yet an\nacre of property. I don't know who is entitled to break his neck if\nhe is not. And Dandolo is as good a horse as there is in the stable,\nif you can once get him to go. Mind, I have to start to-morrow at\nnine, for it's all eighteen miles.\" And so the Master of the Brake\nHounds took himself to his repose.\n\nLady Laura Kennedy had written to Barrington Erle respecting her\nfriend's political interests, and to her sister-in-law, Lady\nChiltern, as to his social comfort. She could not bear to think that\nhe should be left alone in London till Parliament should meet, and\nhad therefore appealed to Lady Chiltern as to the memory of many past\nevents. The appeal had been unnecessary and superfluous. It cannot\nbe said that Phineas and his affairs were matters of as close an\ninterest to Lady Chiltern as to Lady Laura. If any woman loved her\nhusband beyond all things Lord Chiltern's wife did, and ever had done\nso. But there had been a tenderness in regard to the young Irish\nMember of Parliament, which Violet Effingham had in old days shared\nwith Lady Laura, and which made her now think that all good things\nshould be done for him. She believed him to be addicted to hunting,\nand therefore horses must be provided for him. He was a widower, and\nshe remembered of old that he was fond of pretty women, and she knew\nthat in coming days he might probably want money;--and therefore she\nhad asked Madame Max Goesler to spend a fortnight at Harrington Hall.\nMadame Max Goesler and Phineas Finn had been acquainted before, as\nLady Chiltern was well aware. But perhaps Lady Chiltern, when she\nsummoned Madame Max into the country, did not know how close the\nacquaintance had been.\n\nMadame Max came a couple of days before Phineas, and was taken out\nhunting on the morning after her arrival. She was a lady who could\nride to hounds,--and who, indeed, could do nearly anything to which\nshe set her mind. She was dark, thin, healthy, good-looking, clever,\nambitious, rich, unsatisfied, perhaps unscrupulous,--but not without\na conscience. As has been told in a former portion of this chronicle,\nshe could always seem to be happy with her companion of the day, and\nyet there was ever present a gnawing desire to do something more and\nsomething better than she had as yet achieved. Of course, as he took\nher to the meet, Lord Chiltern told her his grievance respecting\nTrumpeton Wood. \"But, my dear Lord Chiltern, you must not abuse the\nDuke of Omnium to me.\"\n\n\"Why not to you?\"\n\n\"He and I are sworn friends.\"\n\n\"He's a hundred years old.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't I have a friend a hundred years old? And as\nfor Mr. Palliser, he knows no more of your foxes than I know of\nhis taxes. Why don't you write to Lady Glencora? She understands\neverything.\"\n\n\"Is she a friend of yours, too?\"\n\n\"My particular friend. She and I, you know, look after the poor dear\nDuke between us.\"\n\n\"I can understand why she should sacrifice herself.\"\n\n\"But not why I do. I can't explain it myself; but so it has come\nto pass, and I must not hear the Duke abused. May I write to Lady\nGlencora about it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,--if you please; but not as giving her any message from\nme. Her uncle's property is mismanaged most damnably. If you choose\nto tell her that I say so you can. I'm not going to ask anything as a\nfavour. I never do ask favours. But the Duke or Planty Palliser among\nthem should do one of two things. They should either stand by the\nhunting, or they should let it alone;--and they should say what they\nmean. I like to know my friends, and I like to know my enemies.\"\n\n\"I am sure the Duke is not your enemy, Lord Chiltern.\"\n\n\"These Pallisers have always been running with the hare and hunting\nwith the hounds. They are great aristocrats, and yet are always\ngoing in for the people. I'm told that Planty Pall calls fox-hunting\nbarbarous. Why doesn't he say so out loud, and stub up Trumpeton Wood\nand grow corn?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will when Trumpeton Wood belongs to him.\"\n\n\"I should like that much better than poisoning hounds and trapping\nfoxes.\" When they got to the meet, conclaves of men might be\nseen gathered together here and there, and in each conclave they\nwere telling something new or something old as to the iniquities\nperpetrated at Trumpeton Wood.\n\nOn that evening before dinner Madame Goesler was told by her\nhostess that Phineas Finn was expected on the following day. The\ncommunication was made quite as a matter of course; but Lady Chiltern\nhad chosen a time in which the lights were shaded, and the room was\ndark. Adelaide Palliser was present, as was also a certain Lady\nBaldock,--not that Lady Baldock who had abused all Papists to poor\nPhineas, but her son's wife. They were drinking tea together over\nthe fire, and the dim lights were removed from the circle. This, no\ndoubt, was simply an accident; but the gloom served Madame Goesler\nduring one moment of embarrassment. \"An old friend of yours is coming\nhere to-morrow,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"An old friend of mine! Shall I call my friend he or she?\"\n\n\"You remember Mr. Finn?\"\n\nThat was the moment in which Madame Goesler rejoiced that no strong\nglare of light fell upon her face. But she was a woman who would not\nlong leave herself subject to any such embarrassment. \"Surely,\" she\nsaid, confining herself at first to the single word.\n\n\"He is coming here. He is a great friend of mine.\"\n\n\"He always was a good friend of yours, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\n\"And of yours, too, Madame Max. A sort of general friend, I think,\nwas Mr. Finn in the old days. I hope you will be glad to see him.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes.\"\n\n\"I thought him very nice,\" said Adelaide Palliser.\n\n\"I remember mamma saying, before she was mamma, you know,\" said Lady\nBaldock, \"that Mr. Finn was very nice indeed, only he was a Papist,\nand only he had got no money, and only he would fall in love with\neverybody. Does he go on falling in love with people, Violet?\"\n\n\"Never with married women, my dear. He has had a wife himself since\nthat, Madame Goesler, and the poor thing died.\"\n\n\"And now here he is beginning all over again,\" said Lady Baldock.\n\n\"And as pleasant as ever,\" said her cousin. \"You know he has done all\nmanner of things for our family. He picked Oswald up once after one\nof those terrible hunting accidents; and he saved Mr. Kennedy when\nmen were murdering him.\"\n\n\"That was questionable kindness,\" said Lady Baldock.\n\n\"And he sat for Lord Brentford's borough.\"\n\n\"How good of him!\" said Miss Palliser.\n\n\"And he has done all manner of things,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Didn't he once fight a duel?\" asked Madame Goesler.\n\n\"That was the grandest thing of all,\" said his friend, \"for he\ndidn't shoot somebody whom perhaps he might have shot had he been\nas bloodthirsty as somebody else. And now he has come back to\nParliament, and all that kind of thing, and he's coming here to hunt.\nI hope you'll be glad to see him, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to see him,\" said Madame Goesler, slowly; \"I\nheard about his success at that town, and I knew that I should meet\nhim somewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\"HOW WELL YOU KNEW!\"\n\n\nIt was necessary also that some communication should be made to\nPhineas, so that he might not come across Madame Goesler unawares.\nLady Chiltern was more alive to that necessity than she had been to\nthe other, and felt that the gentleman, if not warned of what was to\ntake place, would be much more likely than the lady to be awkward at\nthe trying moment. Madame Goesler would in any circumstances be sure\nto recover her self-possession very quickly, even were she to lose it\nfor a moment; but so much could hardly be said for the social powers\nof Phineas Finn. Lady Chiltern therefore contrived to see him alone\nfor a moment on his arrival. \"Who do you think is here?\"\n\n\"Lady Laura has not come!\"\n\n\"Indeed, no; I wish she had. An old friend, but not so old as Laura!\"\n\n\"I cannot guess;--not Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn! What would Lord Fawn do here? Don't you know that Lord\nFawn goes nowhere since his last matrimonial trouble? It's a friend\nof yours, not of mine.\"\n\n\"Madame Goesler?\" whispered Phineas.\n\n\"How well you knew when I said it was a friend of yours. Madame\nGoesler is here,--not altered in the least.\"\n\n\"Madame Goesler!\"\n\n\"Does it annoy you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Why should it annoy me?\"\n\n\"You never quarrelled with her?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"There is no reason why you should not meet her?\"\n\n\"None at all;--only I was surprised. Did she know that I was coming?\"\n\n\"I told her yesterday. I hope that I have not done wrong or made\nthings unpleasant. I knew that you used to be friends.\"\n\n\"And as friends we parted, Lady Chiltern.\" He had nothing more to\nsay in the matter; nor had she. He could not tell the story of what\nhad taken place between himself and the lady, and she could not keep\nherself from surmising that something had taken place, which, had she\nknown it, would have prevented her from bringing the two together at\nHarrington.\n\nMadame Goesler, when she was dressing, acknowledged to herself that\nshe had a task before her which would require all her tact and all\nher courage. She certainly would not have accepted Lady Chiltern's\ninvitation had she known that she would encounter Phineas Finn at the\nhouse. She had twenty-four hours to think of it, and at one time had\nalmost made up her mind that some sudden business should recall her\nto London. Of course, her motive would be suspected. Of course Lady\nChiltern would connect her departure with the man's arrival. But even\nthat, bad as it would be, might be preferable to the meeting! What a\nfool had she been,--so she accused herself,--in not foreseeing that\nsuch an accident might happen, knowing as she did that Phineas Finn\nhad reappeared in the political world, and that he and the Chiltern\npeople had ever been fast friends! As she had thought about it, lying\nawake at night, she had told herself that she must certainly be\nrecalled back to London by business. She would telegraph up to town,\nraising a question about any trifle, and on receipt of the answer she\ncould be off with something of an excuse. The shame of running away\nfrom the man seemed to be a worse evil than the shame of meeting him.\nShe had in truth done nothing to disgrace herself. In her desire\nto save a man whom she had loved from the ruin which she thought\nhad threatened him, she had--offered him her hand. She had made\nthe offer, and he had refused it! That was all. No; she would not\nbe driven to confess to herself that she had ever fled from the face\nof man or woman. This man would be again in London, and she could\nnot always fly. It would be only necessary that she should maintain\nher own composure, and the misery of the meeting would pass away\nafter the first few minutes. One consolation was assured to her.\nShe thoroughly believed in the man,--feeling certain that he had\nnot betrayed her, and would not betray her. But now, as the time\nfor the meeting drew near, as she stood for a moment before the\nglass,--pretending to look at herself in order that her maid might\nnot remark her uneasiness, she found that her courage, great as\nit was, hardly sufficed her. She almost plotted some scheme of a\nheadache, by which she might be enabled not to show herself till\nafter dinner. \"I am so blind that I can hardly see out of my eyes,\"\nshe said to the maid, actually beginning the scheme. The woman\nassumed a look of painful solicitude, and declared that \"Madame did\nnot look quite her best.\" \"I suppose I shall shake it off,\" said\nMadame Goesler; and then she descended the stairs.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"I suppose I shall shake it off.\"]\n\n\nThe condition of Phineas Finn was almost as bad, but he had a much\nless protracted period of anticipation than that with which the lady\nwas tormented. He was sent up to dress for dinner with the knowledge\nthat in half an hour he would find himself in the same room with\nMadame Goesler. There could be no question of his running away, no\npossibility even of his escaping by a headache. But it may be doubted\nwhether his dismay was not even more than hers. She knew that she\ncould teach herself to use no other than fitting words; but he was\nalmost sure that he would break down if he attempted to speak to her.\nShe would be safe from blushing, but he would assuredly become as\nred as a turkey-cock's comb up to the roots of his hair. Her blood\nwould be under control, but his would be coursing hither and thither\nthrough his veins, so as to make him utterly unable to rule himself.\nNevertheless, he also plucked up his courage and descended, reaching\nthe drawing-room before Madame Goesler had entered it. Chiltern was\ngoing on about Trumpeton Wood to Lord Baldock, and was renewing his\nfury against all the Pallisers, while Adelaide stood by and laughed.\nGerard Maule was lounging on a chair, wondering that any man could\nexpend such energy on such a subject. Lady Chiltern was explaining\nthe merits of the case to Lady Baldock,--who knew nothing about\nhunting; and the other guests were listening with eager attention.\nA certain Mr. Spooner, who rode hard and did nothing else,\nand who acted as an unacknowledged assistant-master under Lord\nChiltern,--there is such a man in every hunt,--acted as chorus, and\nindicated, chiefly with dumb show, the strong points of the case.\n\n\"Finn, how are you?\" said Lord Chiltern, stretching out his left\nhand. \"Glad to have you back again, and congratulate you about the\nseat. It was put down in red herrings, and we found nearly a dozen of\nthem afterwards,--enough to kill half the pack.\"\n\n\"Picked up nine,\" said Mr. Spooner.\n\n\"Children might have picked them up quite as well,--and eaten them,\"\nsaid Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"They didn't care about that,\" continued the Master. \"And now\nthey've wires and traps over the whole place. Palliser's a friend of\nyours--isn't he, Finn?\"\n\n\"Of course I knew him,--when I was in office.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he may be in office, but he's an uncommon bad sort\nof fellow to have in a county.\"\n\n\"Shameful!\" said Mr. Spooner, lifting up both his hands.\n\n\"This is my first cousin, you know,\" whispered Adelaide, to Lady\nBaldock.\n\n\"If he were my own brother, or my grandmother, I should say the\nsame,\" continued the angry lord. \"We must have a meeting about it,\nand let the world know it,--that's all.\" At this moment the door was\nagain opened, and Madame Goesler entered the room.\n\nWhen one wants to be natural, of necessity one becomes the reverse of\nnatural. A clever actor,--or more frequently a clever actress,--will\nassume the appearance; but the very fact of the assumption renders\nthe reality impossible. Lady Chiltern was generally very clever in\nthe arrangement of all little social difficulties, and, had she\nthought less about it, might probably have managed the present affair\nin an easy and graceful manner. But the thing had weighed upon her\nmind, and she had decided that it would be expedient that she should\nsay something when those two old friends first met each other again\nin her drawing-room. \"Madame Max,\" she said, \"you remember Mr. Finn.\"\nLord Chiltern for a moment stopped the torrent of his abuse. Lord\nBaldock made a little effort to look uninterested, but quite in vain.\nMr. Spooner stood on one side. Lady Baldock stared with all her\neyes,--with some feeling of instinct that there would be something to\nsee; and Gerard Maule, rising from the sofa, joined the circle. It\nseemed as though Lady Chiltern's words had caused the formation of a\nring in the midst of which Phineas and Madame Goesler were to renew\ntheir acquaintance.\n\n\"Very well indeed,\" said Madame Max, putting out her hand and looking\nfull into our hero's face with her sweetest smile. \"And I hope Mr.\nFinn will not have forgotten me.\" She did it admirably--so well that\nsurely she need not have thought of running away.\n\nBut poor Phineas was not happy. \"I shall never forget you,\" said he;\nand then that unavoidable blush suffused his face, and the blood\nbegan to career through his veins.\n\n\"I am so glad you are in Parliament again,\" said Madame Max.\n\n\"Yes;--I've got in again, after a struggle. Are you still living in\nPark Lane?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--and shall be most happy to see you.\" Then she seated\nherself,--as did also Lady Chiltern by her side. \"I see the poor\nDuke's iniquities are still under discussion. I hope Lord Chiltern\nrecognises the great happiness of having a grievance. It would be a\npity that so great a blessing should be thrown away upon him.\" For\nthe moment Madame Max had got through her difficulty, and, indeed,\nhad done so altogether till the moment should come in which she\nshould find herself alone with Phineas. But he slunk back from the\ngathering before the fire, and stood solitary and silent till dinner\nwas announced. It became his fate to take an old woman into dinner\nwho was not very clearsighted. \"Did you know that lady before?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I knew her two or three years ago in London.\"\n\n\"Do you think she is pretty?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"All the men say so, but I never can see it. They have been saying\never so long that the old Duke of Omnium means to marry her on his\ndeathbed, but I don't suppose there can be anything in it.\"\n\n\"Why should he put it off for so very inopportune an occasion?\" asked\nPhineas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nCOPPERHOUSE CROSS AND BROUGHTON SPINNIES.\n\n\nAfter all, the thing had not been so very bad. With a little courage\nand hardihood we can survive very great catastrophes, and go through\nthem even without broken bones. Phineas, when he got up to his room,\nfound that he had spent the evening in company with Madame Goesler,\nand had not suffered materially, except at the very first moment of\nthe meeting. He had not said a word to the lady, except such as were\nspoken in mixed conversation with her and others; but they had been\ntogether, and no bones had been broken. It could not be that his\nold intimacy should be renewed, but he could now encounter her in\nsociety, as the Fates might direct, without a renewal of that feeling\nof dismay which had been so heavy on him.\n\nHe was about to undress when there came a knock at the door, and his\nhost entered the room. \"What do you mean to do about smoking?\" Lord\nChiltern asked.\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"There's a fire in the smoking-room, but I'm tired, and I want to\ngo to bed. Baldock doesn't smoke. Gerard Maule is smoking in his\nown room, I take it. You'll probably find Spooner at this moment\nestablished somewhere in the back slums, having a pipe with old\nDoggett, and planning retribution. You can join them if you please.\"\n\n\"Not to-night, I think. They wouldn't trust me,--and I should spoil\ntheir plans.\"\n\n\"They certainly wouldn't trust you,--or any other human being. You\ndon't mind a horse that baulks a little, do you?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to hunt, Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. I've got it all arranged. Don't you be a fool, and\nmake us all uncomfortable. Everybody rides here;--every man, woman,\nand child about the place. You shall have one of the best horses I've\ngot;--only you must be particular about your spurs.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I'd rather not. The truth is, I can't afford to ride my own\nhorses, and therefore I'd rather not ride my friends'.\"\n\n\"That's all gammon. When Violet wrote she told you you'd be expected\nto come out. Your old flame, Madame Max, will be there, and I tell\nyou she has a very pretty idea of keeping to hounds. Only Dandolo has\nthat little defect.\"\n\n\"Is Dandolo the horse?\"\n\n\"Yes;--Dandolo is the horse. He's up to a stone over your weight, and\ncan do any mortal thing within a horse's compass. Cox won't ride him\nbecause he baulks, and so he has come into my stable. If you'll only\nlet him know that you're on his back, and have got a pair of spurs on\nyour heels with rowels in them, he'll take you anywhere. Good-night,\nold fellow. You can smoke if you choose, you know.\"\n\nPhineas had resolved that he would not hunt; but, nevertheless, he\nhad brought boots with him, and breeches, fancying that if he did not\nhe would be forced out without those comfortable appurtenances. But\nthere came across his heart a feeling that he had reached a time of\nlife in which it was no longer comfortable for him to live as a poor\nman with men who were rich. It had been his lot to do so when he was\nyounger, and there had been some pleasure in it; but now he would\nrather live alone and dwell upon the memories of the past. He, too,\nmight have been rich, and have had horses at command, had he chosen\nto sacrifice himself for money.\n\nOn the next morning they started in a huge waggonette for Copperhouse\nCross,--a meet that was suspiciously near to the Duke's fatal wood.\nSpooner had explained to Phineas over night that they never did draw\nTrumpeton Wood on Copperhouse Cross days, and that under no possible\ncircumstances would Chiltern now draw Trumpeton Wood. But there is\nno saying where a fox may run. At this time of the year, just the\nbeginning of February, dog-foxes from the big woods were very apt\nto be away from home, and when found would go straight for their\nown earths. It was very possible that they might find themselves in\nTrumpeton Wood, and then certainly there would be a row. Spooner\nshrugged his shoulders, and shook his head, and seemed to insinuate\nthat Lord Chiltern would certainly do something very dreadful to the\nDuke or to the Duke's heir if any law of venery should again be found\nto have been broken on this occasion.\n\nThe distance to Copperhouse Cross was twelve miles, and Phineas found\nhimself placed in the carriage next to Madame Goesler. It had not\nbeen done of fixed design; but when a party of six are seated in a\ncarriage, the chances are that one given person will be next to or\nopposite to any other given person. Madame Max had remembered this,\nand had prepared herself, but Phineas was taken aback when he found\nhow close was his neighbourhood to the lady. \"Get in, Phineas,\" said\nhis lordship. Gerard Maule had already seated himself next to Miss\nPalliser, and Phineas had no alternative but to take the place next\nto Madame Max.\n\n\"I didn't know that you rode to hounds?\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I have done so for years. When we met it was always in\nLondon, Mr. Finn; and people there never know what other people do.\nHave you heard of this terrible affair about the Duke?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes.\"\n\n\"Poor Duke! He and I have seen a great deal of each other\nsince,--since the days when you and I used to meet. He knows nothing\nabout all this, and the worst of it is, he is not in a condition to\nbe told.\"\n\n\"Lady Glencora could put it all right.\"\n\n\"I'll tell Lady Glencora, of course,\" said Madame Max. \"It seems so\nodd in this country that the owner of a property does not seem at all\nto have any exclusive right to it. I suppose the Duke could shut up\nthe wood if he liked.\"\n\n\"But they poisoned the hounds.\"\n\n\"Nobody supposes the Duke did that,--or even the Duke's servants, I\nshould think. But Lord Chiltern will hear us if we don't take care.\"\n\n\"I've heard every word you've been saying,\" exclaimed Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"Has it been traced to any one?\"\n\n\"No,--not traced, I suppose.\"\n\n\"What then, Lord Chiltern? You may speak out to me. When I'm wrong I\nlike to be told so.\"\n\n\"Then you're wrong now,\" said Lord Chiltern, \"if you take the part of\nthe Duke or of any of his people. He is bound to find foxes for the\nBrake hunt. It is almost a part of his title deeds. Instead of doing\nso he has had them destroyed.\"\n\n\"It's as bad as voting against the Church establishment,\" said Madame\nGoesler.\n\nThere was a very large meet at Copperhouse Cross, and both Madame\nGoesler and Phineas Finn found many old acquaintances there. As\nPhineas had formerly sat in the House for five years, and had been\nin office, and had never made himself objectionable either to his\nfriends or adversaries, he had been widely known. He now found half\na dozen men who were always members of Parliament,--men who seem,\nthough commoners, to have been born legislators,--who all spoke to\nhim as though his being member for Tankerville and hunting with the\nBrake hounds were equally matters of course. They knew him, but they\nknew nothing of the break in his life. Or if they remembered that he\nhad not been seen about the House for the last two or three years\nthey remembered also that accidents do happen to some men. It will\noccur now and again that a regular denizen of Westminster will get\na fall in the political hunting-field, and have to remain about the\nworld for a year or two without a seat. That Phineas had lately\ntriumphed over Browborough at Tankerville was known, the event\nhaving been so recent; and men congratulated him, talking of poor\nBrowborough,--whose heavy figure had been familiar to them for many\na year,--but by no means recognising that the event of which they\nspoke had been, as it were, life and death to their friend. Roby was\nthere, who was at this moment Mr. Daubeny's head whip and patronage\nsecretary. If any one should have felt acutely the exclusion of Mr.\nBrowborough from the House,--any one beyond the sufferer himself,--it\nshould have been Mr. Roby; but he made himself quite pleasant, and\neven condescended to be jocose upon the occasion. \"So you've beat\npoor Browborough in his own borough,\" said Mr. Roby.\n\n\"I've beat him,\" said Phineas; \"but not, I hope, in a borough of his\nown.\"\n\n\"He's been there for the last fifteen years. Poor old fellow! He's\nawfully cut up about this Church Question. I shouldn't have thought\nhe'd have taken anything so much to heart. There are worse fellows\nthan Browborough, let me tell you. What's all this I hear about the\nDuke poisoning the foxes?\" But the crowd had begun to move, and\nPhineas was not called upon to answer the question.\n\nCopperhouse Cross in the Brake Hunt was a very popular meet. It\nwas easily reached by a train from London, was in the centre of an\nessentially hunting country, was near to two or three good coverts,\nand was in itself a pretty spot. Two roads intersected each other on\nthe middle of Copperhouse Common, which, as all the world knows, lies\njust on the outskirts of Copperhouse Forest. A steep winding hill\nleads down from the Wood to the Cross, and there is no such thing\nwithin sight as an enclosure. At the foot of the hill, running under\nthe wooden bridge, straggles the Copperhouse Brook,--so called by the\nhunting men of the present day, though men who know the country of\nold, or rather the county, will tell you that it is properly called\nthe river Cobber, and that the spacious old farm buildings above\nwere once known as the Cobber Manor House. He would be a vain man\nwho would now try to change the name, as Copperhouse Cross has been\nprinted in all the lists of hunting meets for at least the last\nthirty years; and the Ordnance map has utterly rejected the two b's.\nAlong one of the cross-roads there was a broad extent of common, some\nseven or eight hundred yards in length, on which have been erected\nthe butts used by those well-known defenders of their country, the\nCopperhouse Volunteer Rifles; and just below the bridge the sluggish\nwater becomes a little lake, having probably at some time been\nartificially widened, and there is a little island and a decoy for\nducks. On the present occasion carriages were drawn up on all the\nroads, and horses were clustered on each side of the brook, and the\nhounds sat stately on their haunches where riflemen usually kneel to\nfire, and there was a hum of merry voices, and the bright colouring\nof pink coats, and the sheen of ladies' hunting toilettes, and that\nmingled look of business and amusement which is so peculiar to our\nnational sports. Two hundred men and women had come there for the\nchance of a run after a fox,--for a chance against which the odds are\nmore than two to one at every hunting day,--for a chance as to which\nthe odds are twenty to one against the success of the individuals\ncollected; and yet, for every horseman and every horsewoman there,\nnot less than \u00c2\u00a35 a head will have been spent for this one day's\namusement. When we give a guinea for a stall at the opera we think\nthat we pay a large sum; but we are fairly sure of having our music.\nWhen you go to Copperhouse Cross you are by no means sure of your\nopera.\n\nWhy is it that when men and women congregate, though the men may beat\nthe women in numbers by ten to one, and though they certainly speak\nthe louder, the concrete sound that meets the ears of any outside\nlistener is always a sound of women's voices? At Copperhouse Cross\nalmost every one was talking, but the feeling left upon the senses\nwas that of an amalgam of feminine laughter, feminine affectation,\nand feminine eagerness. Perhaps at Copperhouse Cross the determined\nperseverance with which Lady Gertrude Fitzaskerley addressed herself\nto Lord Chiltern, to Cox the huntsman, to the two whips, and at\nlast to Mr. Spooner, may have specially led to the remark on this\noccasion. Lord Chiltern was very short with her, not loving Lady\nGertrude. Cox bestowed upon her two \"my lady's,\" and then turned from\nher to some peccant hound. But Spooner was partly gratified, and\npartly incapable, and underwent a long course of questions about\nthe Duke and the poisoning. Lady Gertrude, whose father seemed to\nhave owned half the coverts in Ireland, had never before heard of\nsuch enormity. She suggested a round robin and would not be at all\nashamed to put her own name to it. \"Oh, for the matter of that,\" said\nSpooner, \"Chiltern can be round enough himself without any robin.\"\n\"He can't be too round,\" said Lady Gertrude, with a very serious\naspect.\n\nAt last they moved away, and Phineas found himself riding by the side\nof Madame Goesler. It was natural that he should do so, as he had\ncome with her. Maule had, of course, remained with Miss Palliser,\nand Chiltern and Spooner had taken themselves to their respective\nduties. Phineas might have avoided her, but in doing so he would have\nseemed to avoid her. She accepted his presence apparently as a matter\nof course, and betrayed by her words and manner no memory of past\nscenes. It was not customary with them to draw the forest, which\nindeed, as it now stood, was a forest only in name, and they trotted\noff to a gorse a mile and a half distant. This they drew blank,--then\nanother gorse also blank,--and two or three little fringes of wood,\nsuch as there are in every country, and through which huntsmen run\ntheir hounds, conscious that no fox will lie there. At one o'clock\nthey had not found, and the hilarity of the really hunting men as\nthey ate their sandwiches and lit their cigars was on the decrease.\nThe ladies talked more than ever, Lady Gertrude's voice was heard\nabove them all, and Lord Chiltern trotted on close behind his hounds\nin obdurate silence. When things were going bad with him no one in\nthe field dared to speak to him.\n\nPhineas had never seen his horse till he reached the meet, and there\nfound a fine-looking, very strong, bay animal, with shoulders like\nthe top of a hay-stack, short-backed, short-legged, with enormous\nquarters, and a wicked-looking eye. \"He ought to be strong,\" said\nPhineas to the groom. \"Oh, sir; strong ain't no word for him,\" said\nthe groom; \"'e can carry a 'ouse.\" \"I don't know whether he's fast?\"\ninquired Phineas. \"He's fast enough for any 'ounds, sir,\" said the\nman with that tone of assurance which always carries conviction. \"And\nhe can jump?\" \"He can jump!\" continued the groom; \"no 'orse in my\nlord's stables can't beat him.\" \"But he won't?\" said Phineas. \"It's\nonly sometimes, sir, and then the best thing is to stick him at it\ntill he do. He'll go, he will, like a shot at last; and then he's\nright for the day.\" Hunting men will know that all this was not quite\ncomfortable. When you ride your own horse, and know his special\ndefects, you know also how far that defect extends, and what real\nprospect you have of overcoming it. If he be slow through the mud,\nyou keep a good deal on the road in heavy weather, and resolve that\nthe present is not an occasion for distinguishing yourself. If he be\nbad at timber, you creep through a hedge. If he pulls, you get as far\nfrom the crowd as may be. You gauge your misfortune, and make your\nlittle calculation as to the best mode of remedying the evil. But\nwhen you are told that your friend's horse is perfect,--only that he\ndoes this or that,--there comes a weight on your mind from which you\nare unable to release it. You cannot discount your trouble at any\npercentage. It may amount to absolute ruin, as far as that day is\nconcerned; and in such a circumstance you always look forward to\nthe worst. When the groom had done his description, Phineas Finn\nwould almost have preferred a day's canvass at Tankerville under Mr.\nRuddles's authority to his present position.\n\nWhen the hounds entered Broughton Spinnies, Phineas and Madame\nGoesler were still together. He had not been riding actually at her\nside all the morning. Many men and two or three ladies had been\ntalking to her. But he had never been far from her in the ruck, and\nnow he was again close by her horse's head. Broughton Spinnies were\nin truth a series of small woods, running one into another almost\nwithout intermission, never thick, and of no breadth. There was\nalways a litter or two of cubs at the place, and in no part of the\nBrake country was greater care taken in the way of preservation and\nencouragement to interesting vixens; but the lying was bad; there was\nlittle or no real covert; and foxes were very apt to travel and get\naway into those big woods belonging to the Duke,--where, as the Brake\nsportsmen now believed, they would almost surely come to an untimely\nend. \"If we draw this blank I don't know what we are to do,\" said Mr.\nSpooner, addressing himself to Madame Goesler with lachrymose\nanxiety.\n\n\"Have you nothing else to draw?\" asked Phineas.\n\n\"In the common course of things we should take Muggery Gorse, and so\non to Trumpeton Wood. But Muggery is on the Duke's land, and Chiltern\nis in such a fix! He won't go there unless he can't help it. Muggery\nGorse is only a mile this side of the big wood.\"\n\n\"And foxes of course go to the big wood?\" asked Madame Max.\n\n\"Not always. They often come here,--and as they can't hang here, we\nhave the whole country before us. We get as good runs from Muggery as\nfrom any covert in the country. But Chiltern won't go there to-day\nunless the hounds show a line. By George, that's a fox! That's Dido.\nThat's a find!\" And Spooner galloped away, as though Dido could do\nnothing with the fox she had found unless he was there to help her.\n\nSpooner was quite right, as he generally was on such occasions. He\nknew the hounds even by voice, and knew what hound he could believe.\nMost hounds will lie occasionally, but Dido never lied. And there\nwere many besides Spooner who believed in Dido. The whole pack rushed\nto her music, though the body of them would have remained utterly\nunmoved at the voice of any less reverenced and less trustworthy\ncolleague. The whole wood was at once in commotion,--men and women\nriding hither and thither, not in accordance with any judgment; but\nas they saw or thought they saw others riding who were supposed to\nhave judgment. To get away well is so very much! And to get away well\nis often so very difficult! There are so many things of which the\nhorseman is bound to think in that moment. Which way does the wind\nblow? And then, though a fox will not long run up wind, he will break\ncovert up wind, as often as not. From which of the various rides\ncan you find a fair exit into the open country, without a chance of\nbreaking your neck before the run begins? When you hear some wild\nhalloa, informing you that one fox has gone in the direction exactly\nopposite to that in which the hounds are hunting, are you sure that\nthe noise is not made about a second fox? On all these matters you\nare bound to make up your mind without losing a moment; and if you\nmake up your mind wrongly the five pounds you have invested in that\nday's amusement will have been spent for nothing. Phineas and Madame\nGoesler were in the very centre of the wood when Spooner rushed away\nfrom them down one of the rides on hearing Dido's voice; and at\nthat time they were in a crowd. Almost immediately the fox was seen\nto cross another ride, and a body of horsemen rushed away in that\ndirection, knowing that the covert was small, and there the animal\nmust soon leave the wood. Then there was a shout of \"Away!\" repeated\nover and over again, and Lord Chiltern, running up like a flash of\nlightning, and passing our two friends, galloped down a third ride\nto the right of the others. Phineas at once followed the master of\nthe pack, and Madame Goesler followed Phineas. Men were still riding\nhither and thither; and a farmer, meeting them, with his horse turned\nback towards the centre of the wood which they were leaving, halloaed\nout as they passed that there was no way out at the bottom. They met\nanother man in pink, who screamed out something as to \"the devil of a\nbank down there.\" Chiltern, however, was still going on, and our hero\nhad not the heart to stop his horse in its gallop and turn back from\nthe direction in which the hounds were running. At that moment he\nhardly remembered the presence of Madame Goesler, but he did remember\nevery word that had been said to him about Dandolo. He did not in the\nleast doubt but that Chiltern had chosen his direction rightly, and\nthat if he were once out of the wood he would find himself with the\nhounds; but what if this brute should refuse to take him out of the\nwood? That Dandolo was very fast he soon became aware, for he gained\nupon his friend before him as they neared the fence. And then he saw\nwhat there was before him. A new broad ditch had been cut, with the\nexpress object of preventing egress or ingress at that point; and a\ngreat bank had been constructed with the clay. In all probability\nthere might be another ditch on the other side. Chiltern, however,\nhad clearly made up his mind about it. The horse he was riding went\nat it gallantly, cleared the first ditch, balanced himself for half a\nmoment on the bank, and then, with a fresh spring, got into the field\nbeyond. The tail hounds were running past outside the covert, and the\nmaster had placed himself exactly right for the work in hand. How\nexcellent would be the condition of Finn if only Dandolo would do\njust as Chiltern's horse had done before him!\n\nAnd Phineas almost began to hope that it might be so. The horse was\ngoing very well, and very willingly. His head was stretched out, he\nwas pulling, not more, however, than pleasantly, and he seemed to\nbe as anxious as his rider. But there was a little twitch about his\nears which his rider did not like, and then it was impossible not to\nremember that awful warning given by the groom, \"It's only sometimes,\nsir.\" And after what fashion should Phineas ride him at the obstacle?\nHe did not like to strike a horse that seemed to be going well, and\nwas unwilling, as are all good riders, to use his heels. So he spoke\nto him, and proposed to lift him at the ditch. To the very edge the\nhorse galloped,--too fast, indeed, if he meant to take the bank as\nChiltern's horse had done,--and then stopping himself so suddenly\nthat he must have shaken every joint in his body, he planted his\nfore feet on the very brink, and there he stood, with his head down,\nquivering in every muscle. Phineas Finn, following naturally the\nmomentum which had been given to him, went over the brute's neck\nhead-foremost into the ditch. Madame Max was immediately off her\nhorse. \"Oh, Mr. Finn, are you hurt?\"\n\nBut Phineas, happily, was not hurt. He was shaken and dirty, but not\nso shaken, and not so dirty, but that he was on his legs in a minute,\nimploring his companion not to mind him but go on. \"Going on doesn't\nseem to be so easy,\" said Madame Goesler, looking at the ditch as she\nheld her horse in her hand. But to go back in such circumstances is a\nterrible disaster. It amounts to complete defeat; and is tantamount\nto a confession that you must go home, because you are unable to ride\nto hounds. A man, when he is compelled to do this, is almost driven\nto resolve at the spur of the moment that he will give up hunting for\nthe rest of his life. And if one thing be more essential than any\nother to the horseman in general, it is that he, and not the animal\nwhich he rides, shall be the master. \"The best thing is to stick him\nat it till he do,\" the groom had said; and Phineas resolved to be\nguided by the groom.\n\nBut his first duty was to attend on Madame Goesler. With very little\nassistance she was again in her saddle, and she at once declared\nherself certain that her horse could take the fence. Phineas again\ninstantly jumped into his saddle, and turning Dandolo again at the\nditch, rammed the rowels into the horse's sides. But Dandolo would\nnot jump yet. He stood with his fore feet on the brink, and when\nPhineas with his whip struck him severely over the shoulders, he went\ndown into the ditch on all fours, and then scrambled back again to\nhis former position. \"What an infernal brute!\" said Phineas, gnashing\nhis teeth.\n\n\"He is a little obstinate, Mr. Finn; I wonder whether he'd jump if\nI gave him a lead.\" But Phineas was again making the attempt, urging\nthe horse with spurs, whip, and voice. He had brought himself now\nto that condition in which a man is utterly reckless as to falling\nhimself,--or even to the kind of fall he may get,--if he can only\nforce his animal to make the attempt. But Dandolo would not make\nthe attempt. With ears down and head outstretched, he either stuck\nobstinately on the brink, or allowed himself to be forced again and\nagain into the ditch. \"Let me try it once, Mr. Finn,\" said Madame\nGoesler in her quiet way.\n\nShe was riding a small horse, very nearly thoroughbred, and known\nas a perfect hunter by those who habitually saw Madame Goesler ride.\nNo doubt he would have taken the fence readily enough had his rider\nfollowed immediately after Lord Chiltern; but Dandolo had baulked at\nthe fence nearly a dozen times, and evil communications will corrupt\ngood manners. Without any show of violence, but still with persistent\ndetermination, Madame Goesler's horse also declined to jump. She put\nhim at it again and again, and he would make no slightest attempt to\ndo his business. Phineas raging, fuming, out of breath, miserably\nunhappy, shaking his reins, plying his whip, rattling himself about\nin the saddle, and banging his legs against the horse's sides, again\nand again plunged away at the obstacle. But it was all to no purpose.\nDandolo was constantly in the ditch, sometimes lying with his side\nagainst the bank, and had now been so hustled and driven that, had he\nbeen on the other side, he would have had no breath left to carry his\nrider, even in the ruck of the hunt. In the meantime the hounds and\nthe leading horsemen were far away,--never more to be seen on that\nday by either Phineas Finn or Madame Max Goesler. For a while, during\nthe frantic efforts that were made, an occasional tardy horseman was\nviewed galloping along outside the covert, following the tracks of\nthose who had gone before. But before the frantic efforts had been\nabandoned as utterly useless every vestige of the morning's work\nhad left the neighbourhood of Broughton Spinnies, except these two\nunfortunate ones. At last it was necessary that the defeat should be\nacknowledged. \"We're beaten, Madame Goesler,\" said Phineas, almost in\ntears.\n\n\"Altogether beaten, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I've a good mind to swear that I'll never come out hunting again.\"\n\n\"Swear what you like, if it will relieve you, only don't think of\nkeeping such an oath. I've known you before this to be depressed by\ncircumstances quite as distressing as these, and to be certain that\nall hope was over;--but yet you have recovered.\" This was the only\nallusion she had yet made to their former acquaintance. \"And now we\nmust think of getting out of the wood.\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea of the direction of anything.\"\n\n\"Nor have I; but as we clearly can't get out this way we might as\nwell try the other. Come along. We shall find somebody to put us in\nthe right road. For my part I'm glad it is no worse. I thought at one\ntime that you were going to break your neck.\" They rode on for a few\nminutes in silence, and then she spoke again. \"Is it not odd, Mr.\nFinn, that after all that has come and gone you and I should find\nourselves riding about Broughton Spinnies together?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nMADAME GOESLER'S STORY.\n\n\n\"After all that has come and gone, is it not odd that you and I\nshould find ourselves riding about Broughton Spinnies together?\" That\nwas the question which Madame Goesler asked Phineas Finn when they\nhad both agreed that it was impossible to jump over the bank out of\nthe wood, and it was, of course, necessary that some answer should be\ngiven to it.\n\n\"When I saw you last in London,\" said Phineas, with a voice that was\ngruff, and a manner that was abrupt, \"I certainly did not think that\nwe should meet again so soon.\"\n\n\"No;--I left you as though I had grounds for quarrelling; but there\nwas no quarrel. I wrote to you, and tried to explain that.\"\n\n\"You did;--and though my answer was necessarily short, I was very\ngrateful.\"\n\n\"And here you are back among us; and it does seem so odd. Lady\nChiltern never told me that I was to meet you.\"\n\n\"Nor did she tell me.\"\n\n\"It is better so, for otherwise I should not have come, and then,\nperhaps, you would have been all alone in your discomfiture at the\nbank.\"\n\n\"That would have been very bad.\"\n\n\"You see I can be quite frank with you, Mr. Finn. I am heartily glad\nto see you, but I should not have come had I been told. And when\nI did see you, it was quite improbable that we should be thrown\ntogether as we are now,--was it not? Ah;--here is a man, and he can\ntell us the way back to Copperhouse Cross. But I suppose we had\nbetter ask for Harrington Hall at once.\"\n\nThe man knew nothing at all about Harrington Hall, and very little\nabout Copperhouse; but he did direct them on to the road, and they\nfound that they were about sixteen miles from Lord Chiltern's house.\nThe hounds had gone away in the direction of Trumpeton Wood, and it\nwas agreed that it would be useless to follow them. The waggonette\nhad been left at an inn about two miles from Copperhouse Cross, but\nthey resolved to abandon that and to ride direct to Harrington Hall.\nIt was now nearly three o'clock, and they would not be subjected to\nthe shame which falls upon sportsmen who are seen riding home very\nearly in the day. To get oneself lost before twelve, and then to come\nhome, is a very degrading thing; but at any time after two you may be\nsupposed to have ridden the run of the season, and to be returning\nafter an excellent day's work.\n\nThen Madame Goesler began to talk about herself, and to give a short\nhistory of her life during the last two-and-a-half years. She did\nthis in a frank natural manner, continuing her tale in a low voice,\nas though it were almost a matter of course that she should make the\nrecital to so old a friend. And Phineas soon began to feel that it\nwas natural that she should do so. \"It was just before you left us,\"\nshe said, \"that the Duke took to coming to my house.\" The duke spoken\nof was the Duke of Omnium, and Phineas well remembered to have heard\nsome rumours about the Duke and Madame Max. It had been hinted to him\nthat the Duke wanted to marry the lady, but that rumour he had never\nbelieved. The reader, if he has duly studied the history of the age,\nwill know that the Duke did make an offer to Madame Goesler, pressing\nit with all his eloquence, but that Madame Goesler, on mature\nconsideration, thought it best to decline to become a duchess. Of all\nthis, however, the reader who understands Madame Goesler's character\nwill be quite sure that she did not say a word to Phineas Finn. Since\nthe business had been completed she had spoken of it to no one but to\nLady Glencora Palliser, who had forced herself into a knowledge of\nall the circumstances while they were being acted.\n\n\"I met the Duke once at Matching,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I remember it well. I was there, and first made the Duke's\nacquaintance on that occasion. I don't know how it was that we became\nintimate;--but we did, and then I formed a sort of friendship with\nLady Glencora; and somehow it has come about that we have been a\ngreat deal together since.\"\n\n\"I suppose you like Lady Glencora?\"\n\n\"Very much indeed,--and the Duke, too. The truth is, Mr. Finn, that\nlet one boast as one may of one's independence,--and I very often do\nboast of mine to myself,--one is inclined to do more for a Duke of\nOmnium than for a Mr. Jones.\"\n\n\"The Dukes have more to offer than the Joneses;--I don't mean in the\nway of wealth only, but of what one enjoys most in society\ngenerally.\"\n\n\"I suppose they have. At any rate, I am glad that you should make\nsome excuse for me. But I do like the man. He is gracious and noble\nin his bearing. He is now very old, and sinking fast into the grave;\nbut even the wreck is noble.\"\n\n\"I don't know that he ever did much,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I don't know that he ever did anything according to your idea of\ndoing. There must be some men who do nothing.\"\n\n\"But a man with his wealth and rank has opportunities so great! Look\nat his nephew!\"\n\n\"No doubt Mr. Palliser is a great man. He never has a moment to speak\nto his wife or to anybody else; and is always thinking so much about\nthe country that I doubt if he knows anything about his own affairs.\nOf course he is a man of a different stamp,--and of a higher stamp,\nif you will. But I have an idea that such characters as those of the\npresent Duke are necessary to the maintenance of a great aristocracy.\nHe has had the power of making the world believe in him simply\nbecause he has been rich and a duke. His nephew, when he comes to the\ntitle, will never receive a tithe of the respect that has been paid\nto this old fain\u00c3\u00a9ant.\"\n\n\"But he will achieve much more than ten times the reputation,\" said\nPhineas.\n\n\"I won't compare them, nor will I argue; but I like the Duke. Nay;--I\nlove him. During the last two years I have allowed the whole fashion\nof my life to be remodelled by this intimacy. You knew what were my\nhabits. I have only been in Vienna for one week since I last saw you,\nand I have spent months and months at Matching.\"\n\n\"What do you do there?\"\n\n\"Read to him;--talk to him;--give him his food, and do all that in\nme lies to make his life bearable. Last year, when it was thought\nnecessary that very distinguished people should be entertained at the\ngreat family castle,--in Barsetshire, you know--\"\n\n\"I have heard of the place.\"\n\n\"A regular treaty or agreement was drawn up. Conditions were sealed\nand signed. One condition was that both Lady Glencora and I should\nbe there. We put our heads together to try to avoid this; as, of\ncourse, the Prince would not want to see me particularly,--and it was\naltogether so grand an affair that things had to be weighed. But the\nDuke was inexorable. Lady Glencora at such a time would have other\nthings to do, and I must be there, or Gatherum Castle should not be\nopened. I suggested whether I could not remain in the background and\nlook after the Duke as a kind of upper nurse,--but Lady Glencora said\nit would not do.\"\n\n\"Why should you subject yourself to such indignity?\"\n\n\"Simply from love of the man. But you see I was not subjected. For\ntwo days I wore my jewels beneath royal eyes,--eyes that will sooner\nor later belong to absolute majesty. It was an awful bore, and I\nought to have been at Vienna. You ask me why I did it. The fact is\nthat things sometimes become too strong for one, even when there is\nno real power of constraint. For years past I have been used to have\nmy own way, but when there came a question of the entertainment of\nroyalty I found myself reduced to blind obedience. I had to go to\nGatherum Castle, to the absolute neglect of my business; and I went.\"\n\n\"Do you still keep it up?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes. He is at Matching now, and I doubt whether he will\never leave it again. I shall go there from here as a matter of\ncourse, and relieve guard with Lady Glencora.\"\n\n\"I don't see what you get for it all.\"\n\n\"Get;--what should I get? You don't believe in friendship, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do;--but this friendship is so unequal. I can hardly\nunderstand that it should have grown from personal liking on your\nside.\"\n\n\"I think it has,\" said Madame Goesler, slowly. \"You see, Mr. Finn,\nthat you as a young man can hardly understand how natural it is that\na young woman,--if I may call myself young,--should minister to an\nold man.\"\n\n\"But there should be some bond to the old man.\"\n\n\"There is a bond.\"\n\n\"You must not be angry with me,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I am not in the least angry.\"\n\n\"I should not venture to express any opinion, of course,--only that\nyou ask me.\"\n\n\"I do ask you, and you are quite welcome to express your opinion. And\nwere it not expressed, I should know what you thought just the same.\nI have wondered at it myself sometimes,--that I should have become as\nit were engulfed in this new life, almost without will of my own. And\nwhen he dies, how shall I return to the other life? Of course I have\nthe house in Park Lane still, but my very maid talks of Matching as\nmy home.\"\n\n\"How will it be when he has gone?\"\n\n\"Ah,--how indeed? Lady Glencora and I will have to curtsey to each\nother, and there will be an end of it. She will be a duchess then,\nand I shall no longer be wanted.\"\n\n\"But even if you were wanted--?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. It must last the Duke's time, and last no longer. It\nwould not be a healthy kind of life were it not that I do my very\nbest to make the evening of his days pleasant for him, and in that\nway to be of some service in the world. It has done me good to think\nthat I have in some small degree sacrificed myself. Let me see;--we\nare to turn here to the left. That goes to Copperhouse Cross, no\ndoubt. Is it not odd that I should have told you all this history?\"\n\n\"Just because this brute would not jump over the fence.\"\n\n\"I dare say I should have told you, even if he had jumped over; but\ncertainly this has been a great opportunity. Do you tell your friend\nLord Chiltern not to abuse the poor Duke any more before me. I dare\nsay our host is all right in what he says; but I don't like it.\nYou'll come and see me in London, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"But you'll be at Matching?\"\n\n\"I do get a few days at home sometimes. You see I have escaped for\nthe present,--or otherwise you and I would not have come to grief\ntogether in Broughton Spinnies.\"\n\nSoon after this they were overtaken by others who were returning\nhome, and who had been more fortunate than they in getting away\nwith the hounds. The fox had gone straight for Trumpeton Wood, not\ndaring to try the gorse on the way, and then had been run to ground.\nChiltern was again in a towering passion, as the earths, he said,\nhad been purposely left open. But on this matter the men who had\novertaken our friends were both of opinion that Chiltern was wrong.\nHe had allowed it to be understood that he would not draw Trumpeton\nWood, and he had therefore no right to expect that the earths should\nbe stopped. But there were and had been various opinions on this\ndifficult point, as the laws of hunting are complex, recondite,\nnumerous, traditional, and not always perfectly understood. Perhaps\nthe day may arrive in which they shall be codified under the care of\nsome great and laborious master of hounds.\n\n\"And they did nothing more?\" asked Phineas.\n\n\"Yes;--they chopped another fox before they left the place,--so that\nin point of fact they have drawn Trumpeton. But they didn't mean it.\"\n\nWhen Madame Max Goesler and Phineas had reached Harrington Hall\nthey were able to give their own story of the day's sport to Lady\nChiltern, as the remainder of the party had not as yet returned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nSPOONER OF SPOON HALL.\n\n\nAdelaide Palliser was a tall, fair girl, exquisitely made, with\nevery feminine grace of motion, highly born, and carrying always\nthe warranty of her birth in her appearance; but with no special\nloveliness of face. Let not any reader suppose that therefore she\nwas plain. She possessed much more than a sufficiency of charm to\njustify her friends in claiming her as a beauty, and the demand had\nbeen generally allowed by public opinion. Adelaide Palliser was\nalways spoken of as a girl to be admired; but she was not one whose\ncountenance would strike with special admiration any beholder who did\nnot know her. Her eyes were pleasant and bright, and, being in truth\ngreen, might, perhaps with propriety, be described as grey. Her nose\nwas well formed. Her mouth was, perhaps, too small. Her teeth were\nperfect. Her chin was somewhat too long, and was on this account\nthe defective feature of her face. Her hair was brown and plentiful;\nbut in no way peculiar. No doubt she wore a chignon; but if so she\nwore it with the special view of being in no degree remarkable\nin reference to her head-dress. Such as she was,--beauty or no\nbeauty--her own mind on the subject was made up, and she had resolved\nlong since that the gift of personal loveliness had not been\nbestowed upon her. And yet after a fashion she was proud of her own\nappearance. She knew that she looked like a lady, and she knew also\nthat she had all that command of herself which health and strength\ncan give to a woman when she is without feminine affectation.\n\nLady Chiltern, in describing her to Phineas Finn, had said that she\ntalked Italian, and wrote for the _Times_. The former assertion\nwas, no doubt, true, as Miss Palliser had passed some years of her\nchildhood in Florence; but the latter statement was made probably\nwith reference to her capability rather than her performance. Lady\nChiltern intended to imply that Miss Palliser was so much better\neducated than young ladies in general that she was able to express\nherself intelligibly in her own language. She had been well educated,\nand would, no doubt, have done the _Times_ credit had the _Times_\nchosen to employ her.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of the youngest brother of the existing\nDuke of Omnium, and the first cousin, therefore, of Mr. Plantagenet\nPalliser, who was the eldest son of the second brother. And as her\nmother had been a Bavilard there could be no better blood. But\nAdelaide had been brought up so far away from the lofty Pallisers and\nlofty Bavilards as almost to have lost the flavour of her birth. Her\nfather and mother had died when she was an infant, and she had gone\nto the custody of a much older half-sister, Mrs. Atterbury, whose\nmother had been not a Bavilard, but a Brown. And Mr. Atterbury was a\nmere nobody, a rich, erudite, highly-accomplished gentleman, whose\nfather had made his money at the bar, and whose grandfather had\nbeen a country clergyman. Mrs. Atterbury, with her husband, was\nstill living at Florence; but Adelaide Palliser had quarrelled with\nFlorence life, and had gladly consented to make a long visit to her\nfriend Lady Chiltern.\n\nIn Florence she had met Gerard Maule, and the acquaintance had not\nbeen viewed with favour by the Atterburys. Mrs. Atterbury knew\nthe history of the Maule family, and declared to her sister that\nno good could come from any intimacy. Old Mr. Maule, she said,\nwas disreputable. Mrs. Maule, the mother,--who, according to Mr.\nAtterbury, had been the only worthy member of the family,--was long\nsince dead. Gerard Maule's sister had gone away with an Irish cousin,\nand they were now living in India on the professional income of\na captain in a foot regiment. Gerard Maule's younger brother had\ngone utterly to the dogs, and nobody knew anything about him.\nMaule Abbey, the family seat in Herefordshire, was,--so said Mrs.\nAtterbury,--absolutely in ruins. The furniture, as all the world\nknew, had been sold by the squire's creditors under the sheriff's\norder ten years ago, and not a chair or a table had been put into\nthe house since that time. The property, which was small,--\u00c2\u00a32,000\na year at the outside,--was, no doubt, entailed on the eldest son;\nand Gerard, fortunately, had a small fortune of his own, independent\nof his father. But then he was also a spendthrift,--so said Mrs.\nAtterbury,--keeping a stable full of horses, for which he could not\nafford to pay; and he was, moreover, the most insufferably idle man\nwho ever wandered about the world without any visible occupation\nfor his hours. \"But he hunts,\" said Adelaide. \"Do you call that an\noccupation?\" asked Mrs. Atterbury with scorn. Now Mrs. Atterbury\npainted pictures, copied Madonnas, composed sonatas, corresponded\nwith learned men in Rome, Berlin, and Boston, had been the intimate\nfriend of Cavour, had paid a visit to Garibaldi on his island with\nthe view of explaining to him the real condition of Italy,--and was\nsupposed to understand Bismarck. Was it possible that a woman who so\nfilled her own life should accept hunting as a creditable employment\nfor a young man, when it was admitted to be his sole employment? And,\nmoreover, she desired that her sister Adelaide should marry a certain\nCount Brudi, who, according to her belief, had more advanced ideas\nabout things in general than any other living human being. Adelaide\nPalliser had determined that she would not marry Count Brudi; had,\nindeed, almost determined that she would marry Gerard Maule, and\nhad left her brother-in-law's house in Florence after something\nlike a quarrel. Mrs. Atterbury had declined to authorise the visit\nto Harrington Hall, and then Adelaide had pleaded her age and\nindependence. She was her own mistress if she so chose to call\nherself, and would not, at any rate, remain in Florence at the\npresent moment to receive the attentions of Signor Brudi. Of the\nprevious winter she had passed three months with some relatives in\nEngland, and there she had learned to ride to hounds, had first met\nGerard Maule, and had made acquaintance with Lady Chiltern. Gerard\nMaule had wandered to Italy after her, appearing at Florence in his\ndesultory way, having no definite purpose, not even that of asking\nAdelaide to be his wife,--but still pursuing her, as though he wanted\nher without knowing what he wanted. In the course of the Spring,\nhowever, he had proposed, and had been almost accepted. But Adelaide,\nthough she would not yield to her sister, had been frightened. She\nknew that she loved the man, and she swore to herself a thousand\ntimes that she would not be dictated to by her sister;--but was she\nprepared to accept the fate which would at once be hers were she now\nto marry Gerard Maule? What could she do with a man who had no ideas\nof his own as to what he ought to do with himself?\n\nLady Chiltern was in favour of the marriage. The fortune, she said,\nwas as much as Adelaide was entitled to expect, the man was a\ngentleman, was tainted by no vices, and was truly in love. \"You had\nbetter let them fight it out somewhere else,\" Lord Chiltern had said\nwhen his wife proposed that the invitation to Gerard Maule should be\nrenewed; but Lady Chiltern had known that if \"fought out\" at all, it\nmust be fought out at Harrington Hall. \"We have asked him to come\nback,\" she said to Adelaide, \"in order that you may make up your\nmind. If he chooses to come, it will show that he is in earnest; and\nthen you must take him, or make him understand that he is not to be\ntaken.\" Gerard Maule had chosen to come; but Adelaide Palliser had\nnot as yet quite made up her mind.\n\nPerhaps there is nothing so generally remarkable in the conduct of\nyoung ladies in the phase of life of which we are now speaking as the\nfacility,--it may almost be said audacity,--with which they do make\nup their minds. A young man seeks a young woman's hand in marriage,\nbecause she has waltzed stoutly with him, and talked pleasantly\nbetween the dances;--and the young woman gives it, almost with\ngratitude. As to the young man, the readiness of his action is less\nmarvellous than hers. He means to be master, and, by the very nature\nof the joint life they propose to lead, must take her to his sphere\nof life, not bind himself to hers. If he worked before he will work\nstill. If he was idle before he will be idle still; and he probably\ndoes in some sort make a calculation and strike a balance between his\nmeans and the proposed additional burden of a wife and children. But\nshe, knowing nothing, takes a monstrous leap in the dark, in which\neverything is to be changed, and in which everything is trusted to\nchance. Miss Palliser, however, differing in this from the majority\nof her friends and acquaintances, frightened, perhaps by those\nrepresentations of her sister to which she would not altogether\nyield, had paused, and was still pausing. \"Where should we go and\nlive if I did marry him?\" she said to Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"I suppose he has an opinion of his own on that subject?\"\n\n\"Not in the least, I should think.\"\n\n\"Has he never said anything about it?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no. Matters have not got so far as that at all;--nor would\nthey ever, out of his own head. If we were married and taken away to\nthe train he would only ask what place he should take the tickets for\nwhen he got to the station.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you manage to live at Maule Abbey?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we might; only there is no furniture, and, as I am told,\nonly half a roof.\"\n\n\"It does seem to be absurd that you two should not make up your mind,\njust as other people do,\" said Lady Chiltern. \"Of course he is not a\nrich man, but you have known that all along.\"\n\n\"It is not a question of wealth or poverty, but of an utterly\nlack-a-daisical indifference to everything in the world.\"\n\n\"He is not indifferent to you.\"\n\n\"That is the marvellous part of it,\" said Miss Palliser.\n\nThis was said on the evening of the famous day at Broughton Spinnies,\nand late on that night Lord Chiltern predicted to his wife that\nanother episode was about to occur in the life of their friend.\n\n\"What do you think Spooner has just asked me?\"\n\n\"Permission to fight the Duke, or Mr. Palliser?\"\n\n\"No,--it's nothing about the hunting. He wants to know if you'd mind\nhis staying here three or four days longer.\"\n\n\"What a very odd request!\"\n\n\"It is odd, because he was to have gone to-morrow. I suppose there's\nno objection.\"\n\n\"Of course not if you like to have him.\"\n\n\"I don't like it a bit,\" said Lord Chiltern; \"but I couldn't turn him\nout. And I know what it means.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"You haven't observed anything?\"\n\n\"I have observed nothing in Mr. Spooner, except an awe-struck horror\nat the trapping of a fox.\"\n\n\"He's going to propose to Adelaide Palliser.\"\n\n\"Oswald! You are not in earnest.\"\n\n\"I believe he is. He would have told me if he thought I could give\nhim the slightest encouragement. You can't very well turn him out\nnow.\"\n\n\"He'll get an answer that he won't like if he does,\" said Lady\nChiltern.\n\nMiss Palliser had ridden well on that day, and so had Gerard Maule.\nThat Mr. Spooner should ride well to hounds was quite a matter of\ncourse. It was the business of his life to do so, and he did it with\ngreat judgment. He hated Maule's style of riding, considering it to\nbe flashy, injurious to hunting, and unsportsmanlike; and now he had\ncome to hate the man. He had, of course, perceived how close were the\nattentions paid by Mr. Maule to Miss Palliser, and he thought that\nhe perceived that Miss Palliser did not accept them with thorough\nsatisfaction. On his way back to Harrington Hall he made some\ninquiries, and was taught to believe that Mr. Maule was not a man\nof very high standing in the world. Mr. Spooner himself had a very\npretty property of his own,--which was all his own. There was no\ndoubt about his furniture, or about the roof at Spoon Hall. He was\nSpooner of Spoon Hall, and had been High Sheriff for his county. He\nwas not so young as he once had been;--but he was still a young man,\nonly just turned forty, and was his own master in everything. He\ncould read, and he always looked at the country newspaper; but a book\nwas a thing that he couldn't bear to handle. He didn't think he had\never seen a girl sit a horse better than Adelaide Palliser sat hers,\nand a girl who rode as she did would probably like a man addicted to\nhunting. Mr. Spooner knew that he understood hunting, whereas that\nfellow Maule cared for nothing but jumping over flights of rails.\nHe asked a few questions that evening of Phineas Finn respecting\nGerard Maule, but did not get much information. \"I don't know where\nhe lives;\" said Phineas; \"I never saw him till I met him here.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he seems sweet upon that girl?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he is.\"\n\n\"She's an uncommonly clean-built young woman, isn't she?\" said Mr.\nSpooner; \"but it seems to me she don't care much for Master Maule.\nDid you see how he was riding to-day?\"\n\n\"I didn't see anything, Mr. Spooner.\"\n\n\"No, no; you didn't get away. I wish he'd been with you. But she went\nuncommon well.\" After that he made his request to Lord Chiltern, and\nLord Chiltern, with a foresight quite unusual to him, predicted the\ncoming event to his wife.\n\nThere was shooting on the following day, and Gerard Maule and Mr.\nSpooner were both out. Lunch was sent down to the covert side, and\nthe ladies walked down and joined the sportsmen. On this occasion Mr.\nSpooner's assiduity was remarkable, and seemed to be accepted with\nkindly grace. Adelaide even asked a question about Trumpeton Wood,\nand expressed an opinion that her cousin was quite wrong because\nhe did not take the matter up. \"You know it's the keepers do it\nall,\" said Mr. Spooner, shaking his head with an appearance of great\nwisdom. \"You never can have foxes unless you keep your keepers well\nin hand. If they drew the Spoon Hall coverts blank I'd dismiss my man\nthe next day.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"You know it's the keepers do it all.\"]\n\n\n\"It mightn't be his fault.\"\n\n\"He knows my mind, and he'll take care that there are foxes. They've\nbeen at my stick covert three times this year, and put a brace out\neach time. A leash went from it last Monday week. When a man really\nmeans a thing, Miss Palliser, he can pretty nearly always do it.\"\nMiss Palliser replied with a smile that she thought that to be true,\nand Mr. Spooner was not slow at perceiving that this afforded good\nencouragement to him in regard to that matter which was now weighing\nmost heavily upon his mind.\n\nOn the next day there was hunting again, and Phineas was mounted on a\nhorse more amenable to persuasion than old Dandolo. There was a fair\nrun in the morning, and both Phineas and Madame Max were carried\nwell. The remarkable event in the day, however, was the riding of\nDandolo in the afternoon by Lord Chiltern himself. He had determined\nthat the horse should go out, and had sworn that he would ride him\nover a fence if he remained there making the attempt all night. For\ntwo weary hours he did remain, with a groom behind him, spurring the\nbrute against a thick hedge, with a ditch at the other side of it,\nand at the end of the two hours he succeeded. The horse at last made\na buck leap and went over with a loud grunt. On his way home Lord\nChiltern sold the horse to a farmer for fifteen pounds;--and that\nwas the end of Dandolo as far as the Harrington Hall stables were\nconcerned. This took place on the Friday, the 8th of February. It was\nunderstood that Mr. Spooner was to return to Spoon Hall on Saturday,\nand on Monday, the 11th, Phineas was to go to London. On the 12th\nthe Session would begin, and he would once more take his seat in\nParliament.\n\n\"I give you my word and honour, Lady Chiltern,\" Gerard Maule said to\nhis hostess, \"I believe that oaf of a man is making up to Adelaide.\"\nMr. Maule had not been reticent about his love towards Lady Chiltern,\nand came to her habitually in all his troubles.\n\n\"Chiltern has told me the same thing.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he see it, as well as you? But I wouldn't believe it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I believe it's true. But, Lady Chiltern--\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"You know her so well.\"\n\n\"Adelaide, you mean?\"\n\n\"You understand her thoroughly. There can't be anything in it; is\nthere?\"\n\n\"How anything?\"\n\n\"She can't really--like him?\"\n\n\"Mr. Maule, if I were to tell her that you had asked such a question\nas that I don't believe that she'd ever speak a word to you again;\nand it would serve you right. Didn't you call him an oaf?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And how long has she known him?\"\n\n\"I don't believe she ever spoke to him before yesterday.\"\n\n\"And yet you think that she will be ready to accept this oaf as her\nhusband to-morrow! Do you call that respect?\"\n\n\"Girls do such wonderful strange things. What an impudent ass he must\nbe!\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all. He may be an ass and yet not impudent, or\nimpudent and yet not an ass. Of course he has a right to speak his\nmind,--and she will have a right to speak hers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nSOMETHING OUT OF THE WAY.\n\n\nThe Brake hounds went out four days a week, Monday, Wednesday,\nFriday, and Saturday; but the hunting party on this Saturday was very\nsmall. None of the ladies joined in it, and when Lord Chiltern came\ndown to breakfast at half-past eight he met no one but Gerard Maule.\n\"Where's Spooner?\" he asked. But neither Maule nor the servant could\nanswer the question. Mr. Spooner was a man who never missed a day\nfrom the beginning of cubbing to the end of the season, and who,\nwhen April came, could give you an account of the death of every fox\nkilled. Chiltern cracked his eggs, and said nothing more for the\nmoment, but Gerard Maule had his suspicions. \"He must be coming,\"\nsaid Maule; \"suppose you send up to him.\" The servant was sent, and\ncame down with Mr. Spooner's compliments. Mr. Spooner didn't mean\nto hunt to-day. He had something of a headache. He would see Lord\nChiltern at the meet on Monday.\n\nMaule immediately declared that neither would he hunt; but Lord\nChiltern looked at him, and he hesitated. \"I don't care about your\nknowing,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Oh,--I know. Don't you be an ass.\"\n\n\"I don't see why I should give him an opportunity.\"\n\n\"You're to go and pull your boots and breeches off because he has not\nput his on, and everybody is to be told of it! Why shouldn't he have\nan opportunity, as you call it? If the opportunity can do him any\ngood, you may afford to be very indifferent.\"\n\n\"It's a piece of d---- impertinence,\" said Maule, with most unusual\nenergy.\n\n\"Do you finish your breakfast, and come and get into the trap. We've\ntwenty miles to go. You can ask Spooner on Monday how he spent his\nmorning.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock the ladies came down to breakfast, and the whole party\nwere assembled. \"Mr. Spooner!\" said Lady Chiltern to that gentleman,\nwho was the last to enter the room. \"This is a marvel!\" He was\ndressed in a dark-blue frock-coat, with a coloured silk handkerchief\nround his neck, and had brushed his hair down close to his head. He\nlooked quite unlike himself, and would hardly have been known by\nthose who had never seen him out of the hunting field. In his dress\nclothes of an evening, or in his shooting coat, he was still himself.\nBut in the garb he wore on the present occasion he was quite unlike\nSpooner of Spoon Hall, whose only pride in regard to clothes had\nhitherto been that he possessed more pairs of breeches than any\nother man in the county. It was ascertained afterwards, when\nthe circumstances came to be investigated, that he had sent\na man all the way across to Spoon Hall for that coat and the\ncoloured neck-handkerchief on the previous day; and some one, most\nmaliciously, told the story abroad. Lady Chiltern, however, always\ndeclared that her secrecy on the matter had always been inviolable.\n\n\"Yes, Lady Chiltern; yes,\" said Mr. Spooner, as he took a seat at the\ntable; \"wonders never cease, do they?\" He had prepared himself even\nfor this moment, and had determined to show Miss Palliser that he\ncould be sprightly and engaging even without his hunting habiliments.\n\n\"What will Lord Chiltern do without you?\" one of the ladies asked.\n\n\"He'll have to do his best.\"\n\n\"He'll never kill a fox,\" said Miss Palliser.\n\n\"Oh, yes; he knows what he's about. I was so fond of my pillow this\nmorning that I thought I'd let the hunting slide for once. A man\nshould not make a toil of his pleasure.\"\n\nLady Chiltern knew all about it, but Adelaide Palliser knew nothing.\nMadame Goesler, when she observed the light-blue necktie, at once\nsuspected the execution of some great intention. Phineas was absorbed\nin his observation of the difference in the man. In his pink coat\nhe always looked as though he had been born to wear it, but his\nappearance was now that of an amateur actor got up in a miscellaneous\nmiddle-age costume. He was sprightly, but the effort was painfully\nvisible. Lady Baldock said something afterwards, very ill-natured,\nabout a hog in armour, and old Mrs. Burnaby spoke the truth when she\ndeclared that all the comfort of her tea and toast was sacrificed\nto Mr. Spooner's frock coat. But what was to be done with him when\nbreakfast was over? For a while he was fixed upon poor Phineas, with\nwhom he walked across to the stables. He seemed to feel that he could\nhardly hope to pounce upon his prey at once, and that he must bide\nhis time.\n\nOut of the full heart the mouth speaks. \"Nice girl, Miss Palliser,\"\nhe said to Phineas, forgetting that he had expressed himself nearly\nin the same way to the same man on a former occasion.\n\n\"Very nice, indeed. It seems to me that you are sweet upon her\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Who? I! Oh, no--I don't think of those sort of things. I suppose I\nshall marry some day. I've a house fit for a lady to-morrow, from top\nto bottom, linen and all. And my property's my own.\"\n\n\"That's a comfort.\"\n\n\"I believe you. There isn't a mortgage on an acre of it, and that's\nwhat very few men can say. As for Miss Palliser, I don't know that\na man could do better; only I don't think much of those things. If\never I do pop the question, I shall do it on the spur of the moment.\nThere'll be no preparation with me, nor yet any beating about the\nbush. 'Would it suit your views, my dear, to be Mrs. Spooner?' that's\nabout the long and the short of it. A clean-made little mare, isn't\nshe?\" This last observation did not refer to Adelaide Palliser, but\nto an animal standing in Lord Chiltern's stables. \"He bought her from\nCharlie Dickers for a twenty pound note last April. The mare hadn't\na leg to stand upon. Charlie had been stagging with her for the last\ntwo months, and knocked her all to pieces. She's a screw, of course,\nbut there isn't anything carries Chiltern so well. There's nothing\nlike a good screw. A man'll often go with two hundred and fifty\nguineas between his legs, supposed to be all there because the\nanimal's sound, and yet he don't know his work. If you like schooling\na young 'un, that's all very well. I used to be fond of it myself;\nbut I've come to feel that being carried to hounds without much\nthinking about it is the cream of hunting, after all. I wonder what\nthe ladies are at? Shall we go back and see?\" Then they turned to the\nhouse, and Mr. Spooner began to be a little fidgety. \"Do they sit\naltogether mostly all the morning?\"\n\n\"I fancy they do.\"\n\n\"I suppose there's some way of dividing them. They tell me you know\nall about women. If you want to get one to yourself, how do you\nmanage it?\"\n\n\"In perpetuity, do you mean, Mr. Spooner?\"\n\n\"Any way;--in the morning, you know.\"\n\n\"Just to say a few words to her?\"\n\n\"Exactly that;--just to say a few words. I don't mind asking you,\nbecause you've done this kind of thing before.\"\n\n\"I should watch my opportunity,\" said Phineas, remembering a period\nof his life in which he had watched much and had found it very\ndifficult to get an opportunity.\n\n\"But I must go after lunch,\" said Mr. Spooner; \"I'm expected home to\ndinner, and I don't know much whether they'll like me to stop over\nSunday.\"\n\n\"If you were to tell Lady Chiltern--\"\n\n\"I was to have gone on Thursday, you know. You won't tell anybody?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no.\"\n\n\"I think I shall propose to that girl. I've about made up my mind to\ndo it, only a fellow can't call her out before half-a-dozen of them.\nCouldn't you get Lady C. to trot her out into the garden? You and she\nare as thick as thieves.\"\n\n\"I should think Miss Palliser was rather difficult to be managed.\"\n\nPhineas declined to interfere, taking upon himself to assure\nMr. Spooner that attempts to arrange matters in that way never\nsucceeded. He went in and settled himself to the work of answering\ncorrespondents at Tankerville, while Mr. Spooner hung about the\ndrawing-room, hoping that circumstances and time might favour him. It\nis to be feared that he made himself extremely disagreeable to poor\nLady Chiltern, to whom he was intending to open his heart could he\nonly find an opportunity for so much as that. But Lady Chiltern was\ndetermined not to have his confidence, and at last withdrew from the\nscene in order that she might not be entrapped. Before lunch had come\nall the party knew what was to happen,--except Adelaide herself. She,\ntoo, perceived that something was in the wind, that there was some\nstir, some discomfort, some secret affair forward, or some event\nexpected which made them all uneasy;--and she did connect it with\nthe presence of Mr. Spooner. But, in pitiable ignorance of the facts\nthat were clear enough to everybody else, she went on watching and\nwondering, with a half-formed idea that the house would be more\npleasant as soon as Mr. Spooner should have taken his departure. He\nwas to go after lunch. But on such occasions there is, of course, a\nlatitude, and \"after lunch\" may be stretched at any rate to the five\no'clock tea. At three o'clock Mr. Spooner was still hanging about.\nMadame Goesler and Phineas, with an openly declared intention of\nfriendly intercourse, had gone out to walk together. Lord and Lady\nBaldock were on horseback. Two or three old ladies hung over the\nfire and gossiped. Lady Chiltern had retired to her baby;--when on a\nsudden Adelaide Palliser declared her intention of walking into the\nvillage. \"Might I accompany you, Miss Palliser?\" said Mr. Spooner;\n\"I want a walk above all things.\" He was very brave, and persevered\nthough it was manifest that the lady did not desire his company.\nAdelaide said something about an old woman whom she intended to\nvisit; whereupon Mr. Spooner declared that visiting old women was the\ndelight of his life. He would undertake to give half a sovereign to\nthe old woman if Miss Palliser would allow him to come. He was very\nbrave, and persevered in such a fashion that he carried his point.\nLady Chiltern from her nursery window saw them start through the\nshrubbery together.\n\n\"I have been waiting for this opportunity all the morning,\" said Mr.\nSpooner, gallantly.\n\nBut in spite of his gallantry, and although she had known, almost\nfrom breakfast time, that he had been waiting for something, still\nshe did not suspect his purpose. It has been said that Mr. Spooner\nwas still young, being barely over forty years of age; but he had\nunfortunately appeared to be old to Miss Palliser. To himself it\nseemed as though the fountains of youth were still running through\nall his veins. Though he had given up schooling young horses, he\ncould ride as hard as ever. He could shoot all day. He could take\n\"his whack of wine,\" as he called it, sit up smoking half the night,\nand be on horseback the next morning after an early breakfast without\nthe slightest feeling of fatigue. He was a red-faced little man,\nwith broad shoulders, clean shaven, with small eyes, and a nose on\nwhich incipient pimples began to show themselves. To himself and the\ncomrades of his life he was almost as young as he had ever been; but\nthe young ladies of the county called him Old Spooner, and regarded\nhim as a permanent assistant unpaid huntsman to the Brake hounds. It\nwas not within the compass of Miss Palliser's imagination to conceive\nthat this man should intend to propose himself to her as her lover.\n\n\"I have been waiting for this opportunity all the morning,\" said Mr.\nSpooner. Adelaide Palliser turned round and looked at him, still\nunderstanding nothing. Ride at any fence hard enough, and the chances\nare you'll get over. The harder you ride the heavier the fall, if\nyou get a fall; but the greater the chance of your getting over.\nThis had been a precept in the life of Mr. Spooner, verified by much\nexperience, and he had resolved that he would be guided by it on this\noccasion. \"Ever since I first saw you, Miss Palliser, I have been so\nmuch taken by you that,--that,--in point of fact, I love you better\nthan all the women in the world I ever saw; and will you,--will you\nbe Mrs. Spooner?\"\n\nHe had at any rate ridden hard at his fence. There had been no\ncraning,--no looking about for an easy place, no hesitation as he\nbrought his horse up to it. No man ever rode straighter than he did\non this occasion. Adelaide stopped short on the path, and he stood\nopposite to her, with his fingers inserted between the closed buttons\nof his frock-coat. \"Mr. Spooner!\" exclaimed Adelaide.\n\n\"I am quite in earnest, Miss Palliser; no man ever was more in\nearnest. I can offer you a comfortable well-furnished home, an\nundivided heart, a good settlement, and no embarrassment on the\nproperty. I'm fond of a country life myself, but I'll adapt myself\nto you in everything reasonable.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Spooner; you are indeed.\"\n\n\"How mistaken?\"\n\n\"I mean that it is altogether out of the question. You have surprised\nme so much that I couldn't stop you sooner; but pray do not speak of\nit again.\"\n\n\"It is a little sudden, but what is a man to do? If you will only\nthink of it--\"\n\n\"I can't think of it at all. There is no need for thinking. Really,\nMr. Spooner, I can't go on with you. If you wouldn't mind turning\nback I'll walk into the village by myself.\" Mr. Spooner, however, did\nnot seem inclined to obey this injunction, and stood his ground, and,\nwhen she moved on, walked on beside her. \"I must insist on being left\nalone,\" she said.\n\n\"I haven't done anything out of the way,\" said the lover.\n\n\"I think it's very much out of the way. I have hardly ever spoken to\nyou before. If you will only leave me now there shall not be a word\nmore said about it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Spooner was a man of spirit. \"I'm not in the least ashamed of\nwhat I've done,\" he said.\n\n\"But you might as well go away, when it can't be of any use.\"\n\n\"I don't know why it shouldn't be of use. Miss Palliser, I'm a man of\ngood property. My great-great-grandfather lived at Spoon Hall, and\nwe've been there ever since. My mother was one of the Platters of\nPlatter House. I don't see that I've done anything out of the way. As\nfor shilly-shallying, and hanging about, I never knew any good come\nfrom it. Don't let us quarrel, Miss Palliser. Say that you'll take a\nweek to think of it.\"\n\n\"But I won't think of it at all; and I won't go on walking with you.\nIf you'll go one way, Mr. Spooner, I'll go the other.\"\n\nThen Mr. Spooner waxed angry. \"Why am I to be treated with disdain?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I don't want to treat you with disdain. I only want you to go away.\"\n\n\"You seem to think that I'm something,--something altogether beneath\nyou.\"\n\nAnd so in truth she did. Miss Palliser had never analysed her own\nfeelings and emotions about the Spooners whom she met in society; but\nshe probably conceived that there were people in the world who, from\ncertain accidents, were accustomed to sit at dinner with her, but\nwho were no more fitted for her intimacy than were the servants who\nwaited upon her. Such people were to her little more than the tables\nand chairs with which she was brought in contact. They were persons\nwith whom it seemed to her to be impossible that she should have\nanything in common,--who were her inferiors, as completely as were\nthe menials around her. Why she should thus despise Mr. Spooner,\nwhile in her heart of hearts she loved Gerard Maule, it would be\ndifficult to explain. It was not simply an affair of age,--nor of\ngood looks, nor altogether of education. Gerard Maule was by no means\nwonderfully erudite. They were both addicted to hunting. Neither\nof them did anything useful. In that respect Mr. Spooner stood the\nhigher, as he managed his own property successfully. But Gerard Maule\nso wore his clothes, and so carried his limbs, and so pronounced his\nwords that he was to be regarded as one entitled to make love to any\nlady; whereas poor Mr. Spooner was not justified in proposing to\nmarry any woman much more gifted than his own housemaid. Such, at\nleast, were Adelaide Palliser's ideas. \"I don't think anything of the\nkind,\" she said, \"only I want you to go away. I shall go back to the\nhouse, and I hope you won't accompany me. If you do, I shall turn\nthe other way.\" Whereupon she did retire at once, and he was left\nstanding in the path.\n\nThere was a seat there, and he sat down for a moment to think of it\nall. Should he persevere in his suit, or should he rejoice that he\nhad escaped from such an ill-conditioned minx? He remembered that he\nhad read, in his younger days, that lovers in novels generally do\npersevere, and that they are almost always successful at last. In\naffairs of the heart, such perseverance was, he thought, the correct\nthing. But in this instance the conduct of the lady had not given him\nthe slightest encouragement. When a horse balked with him at a fence,\nit was his habit to force the animal till he jumped it,--as the\ngroom had recommended Phineas to do. But when he had encountered\na decided fall, it was not sensible practice to ride the horse at\nthe same place again. There was probably some occult cause for\nfailure. He could not but own that he had been thrown on the present\noccasion,--and upon the whole, he thought that he had better give it\nup. He found his way back to the house, put up his things, and got\naway to Spoon Hall in time for dinner, without seeing Lady Chiltern\nor any of her guests.\n\n\n[Illustration: He sat down for a moment to think of it all.]\n\n\n\"What has become of Mr. Spooner?\" Maule asked, as soon as he returned\nto Harrington Hall.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" said Lady Chiltern, \"but I believe he has gone.\"\n\n\"Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"I have heard no tidings; but, if you ask for my opinion, I think\nsomething has happened. A certain lady seems to have been ruffled,\nand a certain gentleman has disappeared. I am inclined to think that\na few unsuccessful words have been spoken.\" Gerard Maule saw that\nthere was a smile in her eye, and he was satisfied.\n\n\"My dear, what did Mr. Spooner say to you during his walk?\" This\nquestion was asked by the ill-natured old lady in the presence of\nnearly all the party.\n\n\"We were talking of hunting,\" said Adelaide.\n\n\"And did the poor old woman get her half-sovereign?\"\n\n\"No;--he forgot that. We did not go into the village at all. I was\ntired and came back.\"\n\n\"Poor old woman;--and poor Mr. Spooner!\"\n\nEverybody in the house knew what had occurred, as Mr. Spooner's\ndiscretion in the conduct of this affair had not been equal to his\nvalour; but Miss Palliser never confessed openly, and almost taught\nherself to believe that the man had been mad or dreaming during that\nspecial hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nPHINEAS AGAIN IN LONDON.\n\n\nPhineas, on his return to London, before he had taken his seat in the\nHouse, received the following letter from Lady Laura Kennedy:--\n\n\n   Dresden, Feb. 8, 1870.\n\n   DEAR FRIEND,--\n\n   I thought that perhaps you would have written to me from\n   Harrington. Violet has told me of the meeting between you\n   and Madame Goesler, and says that the old friendship seems\n   to have been perfectly re-established. She used to think\n   once that there might be more than friendship, but I\n   never quite believed that. She tells me that Chiltern is\n   quarrelling with the Pallisers. You ought not to let him\n   quarrel with people. I know that he would listen to you.\n   He always did.\n\n   I write now especially because I have just received so\n   dreadful a letter from Mr. Kennedy! I would send it you\n   were it not that there are in it a few words which on his\n   behalf I shrink from showing even to you. It is full of\n   threats. He begins by quotations from the Scriptures, and\n   from the Prayer-Book, to show that a wife has no right to\n   leave her husband,--and then he goes on to the law. One\n   knows all that of course. And then he asks whether he ever\n   ill-used me? Was he ever false to me? Do I think, that\n   were I to choose to submit the matter to the iniquitous\n   practices of the present Divorce Court, I could prove\n   anything against him by which even that low earthly\n   judge would be justified in taking from him his marital\n   authority? And if not,--have I no conscience? Can I\n   reconcile it to myself to make his life utterly desolate\n   and wretched simply because duties which I took upon\n   myself at my marriage have become distasteful to me?\n\n   These questions would be very hard to answer, were there\n   not other questions that I could ask. Of course I was\n   wrong to marry him. I know that now, and I repent my sin\n   in sackcloth and ashes. But I did not leave him after\n   I married him till he had brought against me horrid\n   accusations,--accusations which a woman could not bear,\n   which, if he believed them himself, must have made it\n   impossible for him to live with me. Could any wife live\n   with a husband who declared to her face that he believed\n   that she had a lover? And in this very letter he says that\n   which almost repeats the accusation. He has asked me how I\n   can have dared to receive you, and desires me never either\n   to see you or to wish to see you again. And yet he sent\n   for you to Loughlinter before you came, in order that you\n   might act as a friend between us. How could I possibly\n   return to a man whose power of judgment has so absolutely\n   left him?\n\n   I have a conscience in the matter, a conscience that\n   is very far from being at ease. I have done wrong, and\n   have shipwrecked every hope in this world. No woman was\n   ever more severely punished. My life is a burden to me,\n   and I may truly say that I look for no peace this side\n   the grave. I am conscious, too, of continued sin,--a\n   sin unlike other sins,--not to be avoided, of daily\n   occurrence, a sin which weighs me to the ground. But I\n   should not sin the less were I to return to him. Of course\n   he can plead his marriage. The thing is done. But it can't\n   be right that a woman should pretend to love a man whom\n   she loathes. I couldn't live with him. If it were simply\n   to go and die, so that his pride would be gratified by my\n   return, I would do it; but I should not die. There would\n   come some horrid scene, and I should be no more a wife to\n   him than I am while living here.\n\n   He now threatens me with publicity. He declares that\n   unless I return to him he will put into some of the papers\n   a statement of the whole case. Of course this would be\n   very bad. To be obscure and untalked of is all the comfort\n   that now remains to me. And he might say things that\n   would be prejudicial to others,--especially to you. Could\n   this in any way be prevented? I suppose the papers would\n   publish anything; and you know how greedily people will\n   read slander about those whose names are in any way\n   remarkable. In my heart I believe he is insane; but it is\n   very hard that one's privacy should be at the mercy of a\n   madman. He says that he can get an order from the Court of\n   Queen's Bench which will oblige the judges in Saxony to\n   send me back to England in the custody of the police, but\n   that I do not believe. I had the opinion of Sir Gregory\n   Grogram before I came away, and he told me that it was not\n   so. I do not fear his power over my person, while I remain\n   here, but that the matter should be dragged forward before\n   the public.\n\n   I have not answered him yet, nor have I shown his letter\n   to Papa. I hardly liked to tell you when you were here,\n   but I almost fear to talk to Papa about it. He never urges\n   me to go back, but I know that he wishes that I should do\n   so. He has ideas about money, which seem singular to me,\n   knowing, as I do, how very generous he has been himself.\n   When I married, my fortune, as you knew, had been just\n   used in paying Chiltern's debts. Mr. Kennedy had declared\n   himself to be quite indifferent about it, though the sum\n   was large. The whole thing was explained to him, and he\n   was satisfied. Before a year was over he complained to\n   Papa, and then Papa and Chiltern together raised the\n   money,--\u00c2\u00a340,000,--and it was paid to Mr. Kennedy. He\n   has written more than once to Papa's lawyer to say that,\n   though the money is altogether useless to him, he will not\n   return a penny of it, because by doing so he would seem\n   to abandon his rights. Nobody has asked him to return\n   it. Nobody has asked him to defray a penny on my account\n   since I left him. But Papa continues to say that the\n   money should not be lost to the family. I cannot, however,\n   return to such a husband for the sake of \u00c2\u00a340,000. Papa is\n   very angry about the money, because he says that if it had\n   been paid in the usual way at my marriage, settlements\n   would have been required that it should come back to the\n   family after Mr. Kennedy's death in the event of my having\n   no child. But, as it is now, the money would go to his\n   estate after my death. I don't understand why it should be\n   so, but Papa is always harping upon it, and declaring that\n   Mr. Kennedy's pretended generosity has robbed us all. Papa\n   thinks that were I to return this could be arranged; but\n   I could not go back to him for such a reason. What does\n   it matter? Chiltern and Violet will have enough; and of\n   what use would it be to such a one as I am to have a sum\n   of money to leave behind me? I should leave it to your\n   children, Phineas, and not to Chiltern's.\n\n   He bids me neither see you nor write to you,--but how can\n   I obey a man whom I believe to be mad? And when I will\n   not obey him in the greater matter by returning to him it\n   would be absurd were I to attempt to obey him in smaller\n   details. I don't suppose I shall see you very often. His\n   letter has, at any rate, made me feel that it would be\n   impossible for me to return to England, and it is not\n   likely that you will soon come here again. I will not even\n   ask you to do so, though your presence gave a brightness\n   to my life for a few days which nothing else could have\n   produced. But when the lamp for a while burns with special\n   brightness there always comes afterwards a corresponding\n   dullness. I had to pay for your visit, and for the comfort\n   of my confession to you at K\u00c3\u00b6nigstein. I was determined\n   that you should know it all; but, having told you, I do\n   not want to see you again. As for writing, he shall not\n   deprive me of the consolation,--nor I trust will you.\n\n   Do you think that I should answer his letter, or will it\n   be better that I should show it to Papa? I am very averse\n   to doing this, as I have explained to you; but I would\n   do so if I thought that Mr. Kennedy really intended to\n   act upon his threats. I will not conceal from you that it\n   would go nigh to kill me if my name were dragged through\n   the papers. Can anything be done to prevent it? If he were\n   known to be mad of course the papers would not publish his\n   statements; but I suppose that if he were to send a letter\n   from Loughlinter with his name to it they would print it.\n   It would be very, very cruel.\n\n   God bless you. I need not say how faithfully I am\n\n   Your friend,\n\n   L. K.\n\n\nThis letter was addressed to Phineas at his club, and there he\nreceived it on the evening before the meeting of Parliament. He sat\nup for nearly an hour thinking of it after he read it. He must answer\nit at once. That was a matter of course. But he could give her no\nadvice that would be of any service to her. He was, indeed, of all\nmen the least fitted to give her counsel in her present emergency.\nIt seemed to him that as she was safe from any attack on her person,\nshe need only remain at Dresden, answering his letter by what softest\nnegatives she could use. It was clear to him that in his present\ncondition she could take no steps whatever in regard to the money.\nThat must be left to his conscience, to time, and to chance. As to\nthe threat of publicity, the probability, he thought, was that it\nwould lead to nothing. He doubted whether any respectable newspaper\nwould insert such a statement as that suggested. Were it published,\nthe evil must be borne. No diligence on her part, or on the part of\nher lawyers, could prevent it.\n\nBut what had she meant when she wrote of continual sin, sin not to be\navoided, of sin repeated daily which nevertheless weighed her to the\nground? Was it expected of him that he should answer that portion of\nher letter? It amounted to a passionate renewal of that declaration\nof affection for himself which she had made at K\u00c3\u00b6nigstein, and which\nhad pervaded her whole life since some period antecedent to her\nwretched marriage. Phineas, as he thought of it, tried to analyse the\nnature of such a love. He also, in those old days, had loved her, and\nhad at once resolved that he must tell her so, though his hopes of\nsuccess had been poor indeed. He had taken the first opportunity, and\nhad declared his purpose. She, with the imperturbable serenity of a\nmatured kind-hearted woman, had patted him on the back, as it were,\nas she told him of her existing engagement with Mr. Kennedy. Could\nit be that at that moment she could have loved him as she now said\nshe did, and that she should have been so cold, so calm, and so kind;\nwhile, at that very moment, this coldness, calmness, and kindness was\nbut a thin crust over so strong a passion? How different had been\nhis own love! He had been neither calm nor kind. He had felt himself\nfor a day or two to be so terribly knocked about that the world was\nnothing to him. For a month or two he had regarded himself as a man\npeculiarly circumstanced,--marked for misfortune and for a solitary\nlife. Then he had retricked his beams, and before twelve months were\npassed had almost forgotten his love. He knew now, or thought that\nhe knew,--that the continued indulgence of a hopeless passion was a\nfolly opposed to the very instincts of man and woman,--a weakness\nshowing want of fibre and of muscle in the character. But here was\na woman who could calmly conceal her passion in its early days and\nmarry a man whom she did not love in spite of it, who could make her\nheart, her feelings, and all her feminine delicacy subordinate to\nmaterial considerations, and nevertheless could not rid herself of\nher passion in the course of years, although she felt its existence\nto be an intolerable burden on her conscience. On which side lay\nstrength of character and on which side weakness? Was he strong or\nwas she?\n\nAnd he tried to examine his own feelings in regard to her. The thing\nwas so long ago that she was to him as some aunt, or sister, so much\nthe elder as to be almost venerable. He acknowledged to himself a\nfeeling which made it incumbent upon him to spend himself in her\nservice, could he serve her by any work of his. He was,--or would be,\ndevoted to her. He owed her a never-dying gratitude. But were she\nfree to marry again to-morrow, he knew that he could not marry her.\nShe herself had said the same thing. She had said that she would be\nhis sister. She had specially required of him that he should make\nknown to her his wife, should he ever marry again. She had declared\nthat she was incapable of further jealousy;--and yet she now told him\nof daily sin of which her conscience could not assoil itself.\n\n\"Phineas,\" said a voice close to his ears, \"are you repenting your\nsins?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly;--what sins?\"\n\nIt was Barrington Erle. \"You know that we are going to do nothing\nto-morrow,\" continued he.\n\n\"So I am told.\"\n\n\"We shall let the Address pass almost without a word. Gresham will\nsimply express his determination to oppose the Church Bill to the\nknife. He means to be very plain-spoken about it. Whatever may be the\nmerits of the Bill, it must be regarded as an unconstitutional effort\nto retain power in the hands of the minority, coming from such hands\nas those of Mr. Daubeny. I take it he will go at length into the\nquestion of majorities, and show how inexpedient it is on behalf\nof the nation that any Ministry should remain in power who cannot\ncommand a majority in the House on ordinary questions. I don't know\nwhether he will do that to-morrow or at the second reading of the\nBill.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with him.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. Everybody agrees with him. No gentleman can have\na doubt on the subject. Personally, I hate the idea of Church Reform.\nDear old Mildmay, who taught me all I know, hates it too. But Mr.\nGresham is the head of our party now, and much as I may differ from\nhim on many things, I am bound to follow him. If he proposes Church\nReform in my time, or anything else, I shall support him.\"\n\n\"I know those are your ideas.\"\n\n\"Of course they are. There are no other ideas on which things can be\nmade to work. Were it not that men get drilled into it by the force\nof circumstances any government in this country would be impossible.\nWere it not so, what should we come to? The Queen would find herself\njustified in keeping in any set of Ministers who could get her\nfavour, and ambitious men would prevail without any support from the\ncountry. The Queen must submit to dictation from some quarter.\"\n\n\"She must submit to advice, certainly.\"\n\n\"Don't cavil at a word when you know it to be true,\" said Barrington,\nenergetically. \"The constitution of the country requires that she\nshould submit to dictation. Can it come safely from any other quarter\nthan that of a majority of the House of Commons?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"We are all agreed about that. Not a single man in either House would\ndare to deny it. And if it be so, what man in his senses can think\nof running counter to the party which he believes to be right in its\ngeneral views? A man so burthened with scruples as to be unable to\nact in this way should keep himself aloof from public life. Such a\none cannot serve the country in Parliament, though he may possibly do\nso with pen and ink in his closet.\"\n\n\"I wonder then that you should have asked me to come forward again\nafter what I did about the Irish land question,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"A first fault may be forgiven when the sinner has in other respects\nbeen useful. The long and the short of it is that you must vote\nwith us against Daubeny's bill. Browborough sees it plainly enough.\nHe supported his chief in the teeth of all his protestations at\nTankerville.\"\n\n\"I am not Browborough.\"\n\n\"Nor half so good a man if you desert us,\" said Barrington Erle, with\nanger.\n\n\"I say nothing about that. He has his ideas of duty, and I have mine.\nBut I will go so far as this. I have not yet made up my mind. I shall\nask advice; but you must not quarrel with me if I say that I must\nseek it from some one who is less distinctly a partisan than you\nare.\"\n\n\"From Monk?\"\n\n\"Yes;--from Mr. Monk. I do think it will be bad for the country that\nthis measure should come from the hands of Mr. Daubeny.\"\n\n\"Then why the d---- should you support it, and oppose your own party\nat the same time? After that you can't do it. Well, Ratler, my guide\nand philosopher, how is it going to be?\"\n\nMr. Ratler had joined them, but was still standing before the seat\nthey occupied, not condescending to sit down in amicable intercourse\nwith a man as to whom he did not yet know whether to regard him as\na friend or foe. \"We shall be very quiet for the next month or six\nweeks,\" said Ratler.\n\n\"And then?\" asked Phineas.\n\n\"Well, then it will depend on what may be the number of a few insane\nmen who never ought to have seats in the House.\"\n\n\"Such as Mr. Monk and Mr. Turnbull?\" Now it was well known that both\nthose gentlemen, who were recognised as leading men, were strong\nRadicals, and it was supposed that they both would support any bill,\ncome whence it might, which would separate Church and State.\n\n\"Such as Mr. Monk,\" said Ratler. \"I will grant that Turnbull may be\nan exception. It is his business to go in for everything in the way\nof agitation, and he at any rate is consistent. But when a man has\nonce been in office,--why then--\"\n\n\"When he has taken the shilling?\" said Phineas. \"Just so. I confess\nI do not like a deserter.\"\n\n\"Phineas will be all right,\" said Barrington Erle.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Mr. Ratler, as he passed on.\n\n\"Ratler and I run very much in the same groove,\" said Barrington,\n\"but I fancy there is some little difference in the motive power.\"\n\n\"Ratler wants place.\"\n\n\"And so do I.\"\n\n\"He wants it just as most men want professional success,\" said\nPhineas. \"But if I understand your object, it is chiefly the\nmaintenance of the old-established political power of the Whigs. You\nbelieve in families?\"\n\n\"I do believe in the patriotism of certain families. I believe that\nthe Mildmays, FitzHowards, and Pallisers have for some centuries\nbrought up their children to regard the well-being of their country\nas their highest personal interest, and that such teaching has been\ngenerally efficacious. Of course, there have been failures. Every\nchild won't learn its lesson however well it may be taught. But the\nschool in which good training is most practised will, as a rule, turn\nout the best scholars. In this way I believe in families. You have\ncome in for some of the teaching, and I expect to see you a scholar\nyet.\"\n\nThe House met on the following day, and the Address was moved and\nseconded; but there was no debate. There was not even a full House.\nThe same ceremony had taken place so short a time previously, that\nthe whole affair was flat and uninteresting. It was understood that\nnothing would in fact be done. Mr. Gresham, as leader of his side\nof the House, confined himself to asserting that he should give\nhis firmest opposition to the proposed measure, which was, it\nseemed, so popular with the gentlemen who sat on the other side,\nand who supported the so-called Conservative Government of the day.\nHis reasons for doing so had been stated very lately, and must\nunfortunately be repeated very soon, and he would not, therefore, now\ntrouble the House with them. He did not on this occasion explain his\nideas as to majorities, and the Address was carried by seven o'clock\nin the evening. Mr. Daubeny named a day a month hence for the first\nreading of his bill, and was asked the cause of the delay by some\nmember on a back bench. \"Because it cannot be ready sooner,\" said\nMr. Daubeny. \"When the honourable gentleman has achieved a position\nwhich will throw upon him the responsibility of bringing forward\nsome great measure for the benefit of his country, he will probably\nfind it expedient to devote some little time to details. If he do\nnot, he will be less anxious to avoid attack than I am.\" A Minister\ncan always give a reason; and, if he be clever, he can generally\nwhen doing so punish the man who asks for it. The punishing of an\ninfluential enemy is an indiscretion; but an obscure questioner may\noften be crushed with good effect.\n\nMr. Monk's advice to Phineas was both simple and agreeable. He\nintended to support Mr. Gresham, and of course counselled his friend\nto do the same.\n\n\"But you supported Mr. Daubeny on the Address before Christmas,\" said\nPhineas.\n\n\"And shall therefore be bound to explain why I oppose him now;--but\nthe task will not be difficult. The Queen's speech to Parliament was\nin my judgment right, and therefore I concurred in the Address. But I\ncertainly cannot trust Mr. Daubeny with Church Reform. I do not know\nthat many will make the same distinction, but I shall do so.\"\n\nPhineas soon found himself sitting in the House as though he had\nnever left it. His absence had not been long enough to make the place\nfeel strange to him. He was on his legs before a fortnight was over\nasking some question of some Minister, and of course insinuating\nas he did so that the Minister in question had been guilty of some\nenormity of omission or commission. It all came back upon him as\nthough he had been born to the very manner. And as it became known\nto the Ratlers that he meant to vote right on the great coming\nquestion,--to vote right and to speak right in spite of his doings\nat Tankerville,--everybody was civil to him. Mr. Bonteen did express\nan opinion to Mr. Ratler that it was quite impossible that Phineas\nFinn should ever again accept office, as of course the Tankervillians\nwould never replace him in his seat after manifest apostasy to his\npledge; but Mr. Ratler seemed to think very little of that. \"They\nwon't remember, Lord bless you;--and then he's one of those fellows\nthat always get in somewhere. He's not a man I particularly like; but\nyou'll always see him in the House;--up and down, you know. When a\nfellow begins early, and has got it in him, it's hard to shake him\noff.\" And thus even Mr. Ratler was civil to our hero.\n\nLady Laura Kennedy's letter had, of course, been answered,--not\nwithout very great difficulty. \"My dear Laura,\" he had begun,--for\nthe first time in his life. She had told him to treat her as\na brother would do, and he thought it best to comply with her\ninstructions. But beyond that, till he declared himself at the end to\nbe hers affectionately, he made no further protestation of affection.\nHe made no allusion to that sin which weighed so heavily on her, but\nanswered all her questions. He advised her to remain at Dresden. He\nassured her that no power could be used to enforce her return. He\nexpressed his belief that Mr. Kennedy would abstain from making any\npublic statement, but suggested that if any were made the answering\nof it should be left to the family lawyer. In regard to the money, he\nthought it impossible that any step should be taken. He then told her\nall there was to tell of Lord and Lady Chiltern, and something also\nof himself. When the letter was written he found that it was cold and\nalmost constrained. To his own ears it did not sound like the hearty\nletter of a generous friend. It savoured of the caution with which\nit had been prepared. But what could he do? Would he not sin against\nher and increase her difficulties if he addressed her with warm\naffection? Were he to say a word that ought not to be addressed to\nany woman he might do her an irreparable injury; and yet the tone of\nhis own letter was odious to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nMR. MAULE, SENIOR.\n\n\nThe life of Mr. Maurice Maule, of Maule Abbey, the father of Gerard\nMaule, had certainly not been prosperous. He had from his boyhood\nenjoyed a reputation for cleverness, and at school had done great\nthings,--winning prizes, spouting speeches on Speech days, playing in\nelevens, and looking always handsome. He had been one of those show\nboys of which two or three are generally to be found at our great\nschools, and all manner of good things had been prophesied on his\nbehalf. He had been in love before he was eighteen, and very nearly\nsucceeded in running away with the young lady before he went to\ncollege. His father had died when he was an infant, so that at\ntwenty-one he was thought to be in possession of comfortable wealth.\nAt Oxford he was considered to have got into a good set,--men of\nfashion who were also given to talking of books,--who spent money,\nread poetry, and had opinions of their own respecting the Tracts\nand Mr. Newman. He took his degree, and then started himself in the\nworld upon that career which is of all the most difficult to follow\nwith respect and self-comfort. He proposed to himself the life of an\nidle man with a moderate income,--a life which should be luxurious,\nrefined, and graceful, but to which should be attached the burden\nof no necessary occupation. His small estate gave him but little to\ndo, as he would not farm any portion of his own acres. He became a\nmagistrate in his county; but he would not interest himself with the\nprice of a good yoke of bullocks, as did Mr. Justice Shallow,--nor\ndid he ever care how a score of ewes went at any fair. There is no\nharder life than this. Here and there we may find a man who has so\ntrained himself that day after day he can devote his mind without\ncompulsion to healthy pursuits, who can induce himself to work,\nthough work be not required from him for any ostensible object, who\ncan save himself from the curse of misusing his time, though he has\nfor it no defined and necessary use; but such men are few, and are\nmade of better metal than was Mr. Maule. He became an idler, a man of\nluxury, and then a spendthrift. He was now hardly beyond middle life,\nand he assumed for himself the character of a man of taste. He loved\nmusic, and pictures, and books, and pretty women. He loved also good\neating and drinking; but conceived of himself that in his love for\nthem he was an artist, and not a glutton. He had married early, and\nhis wife had died soon. He had not given himself up with any special\nzeal to the education of his children, nor to the preservation of his\nproperty. The result of his indifference has been told in a previous\nchapter. His house was deserted, and his children were scattered\nabout the world. His eldest son, having means of his own, was living\nan idle, desultory life, hardly with prospects of better success than\nhad attended his father.\n\nMr. Maule was now something about fifty-five years of age, and\nalmost considered himself young. He lived in chambers on a flat in\nWestminster, and belonged to two excellent clubs. He had not been\nnear his property for the last ten years, and as he was addicted to\nno country sport there were ten weeks in the year which were terrible\nto him. From the middle of August to the end of October for him there\nwas no whist, no society,--it may almost be said no dinner. He had\ntried going to the seaside; he had tried going to Paris; he had\nendeavoured to enjoy Switzerland and the Italian lakes;--but all\nhad failed, and he had acknowledged to himself that this sad period\nof the year must always be endured without relaxation, and without\ncomfort.\n\nOf his children he now took but little notice. His daughter was\nmarried and in India. His younger son had disappeared, and the father\nwas perhaps thankful that he was thus saved from trouble. With his\nelder son he did maintain some amicable intercourse, but it was very\nslight in its nature. They never corresponded unless the one had\nsomething special to say to the other. They had no recognised ground\nfor meeting. They did not belong to the same clubs. They did not live\nin the same circles. They did not follow the same pursuits. They were\ninterested in the same property;--but, as on that subject there had\nbeen something approaching to a quarrel, and as neither looked for\nassistance from the other, they were now silent on the matter. The\nfather believed himself to be a poorer man than his son, and was very\nsore on the subject; but he had nothing beyond a life interest in\nhis property, and there remained to him a certain amount of prudence\nwhich induced him to abstain from eating more of his pudding,--lest\nabsolute starvation and the poorhouse should befall him. There still\nremained to him the power of spending some five or six hundred a\nyear, and upon this practice had taught him to live with a very\nconsiderable amount of self-indulgence. He dined out a great deal,\nand was known everywhere as Mr. Maule of Maule Abbey.\n\nHe was a slight, bright-eyed, grey-haired, good-looking man,\nwho had once been very handsome. He had married, let us say for\nlove;--probably very much by chance. He had ill-used his wife, and\nhad continued a long-continued liaison with a complaisant friend.\nThis had lasted some twenty years of his life, and had been to him an\nintolerable burden. He had come to see the necessity of employing his\ngood looks, his conversational powers, and his excellent manners on\na second marriage which might be lucrative; but the complaisant lady\nhad stood in his way. Perhaps there had been a little cowardice on\nhis part; but at any rate he had hitherto failed. The season for such\na mode of relief was not, however, as yet clean gone with him, and\nhe was still on the look out. There are women always in the market\nready to buy for themselves the right to hang on the arm of a real\ngentleman. That Mr. Maurice Maule was a real gentleman no judge in\nsuch matters had ever doubted.\n\nOn a certain morning just at the end of February Mr. Maule was\nsitting in his library,--so-called,--eating his breakfast, at about\ntwelve o'clock; and at his side there lay a note from his son Gerard.\nGerard had written to say that he would call on that morning, and the\npromised visit somewhat disturbed the father's comfort. He was in\nhis dressing-gown and slippers, and had his newspaper in his hand.\nWhen his newspaper and breakfast should be finished,--as they would\nbe certainly at the same moment,--there were in store for him two\ncigarettes, and perhaps some new French novel which had just reached\nhim. They would last him till two o'clock. Then he would dress and\nsaunter out in his great coat, made luxurious with furs. He would\nsee a picture, or perhaps some china-vase, of which news had reached\nhim, and would talk of them as though he might be a possible buyer.\nEverybody knew that he never bought anything;--but he was a man whose\nopinion on such matters was worth having. Then he would call on\nsome lady whose acquaintance at the moment might be of service to\nhim;--for that idea of blazing once more out into the world on a\nwife's fortune was always present to him. At about five he would\nsaunter into his club, and play a rubber in a gentle unexcited manner\ntill seven. He never played for high points, and would never be\nenticed into any bet beyond the limits of his club stakes. Were he\nto lose \u00c2\u00a310 or \u00c2\u00a320 at a sitting his arrangements would be greatly\ndisturbed, and his comfort seriously affected. But he played well,\ntaking pains with his game, and some who knew him well declared that\nhis whist was worth a hundred a year to him. Then he would dress and\ngenerally dine in society. He was known as a good diner out, though\nin what his excellence consisted they who entertained him might find\nit difficult to say. He was not witty, nor did he deal in anecdotes.\nHe spoke with a low voice, never addressing himself to any but his\nneighbour, and even to his neighbour saying but little. But he looked\nlike a gentleman, was well dressed, and never awkward. After dinner\nhe would occasionally play another rubber; but twelve o'clock always\nsaw him back into his own rooms. No one knew better than Mr. Maule\nthat the continual bloom of lasting summer which he affected requires\ngreat accuracy in living. Late hours, nocturnal cigars, and midnight\ndrinkings, pleasurable though they may be, consume too quickly the\nfree-flowing lamps of youth, and are fatal at once to the husbanded\ncandle-ends of age.\n\nBut such as his days were, every minute of them was precious to him.\nHe possessed the rare merit of making a property of his time and\nnot a burden. He had so shuffled off his duties that he had now\nrarely anything to do that was positively disagreeable. He had been\na spendthrift; but his creditors, though perhaps never satisfied,\nhad been quieted. He did not now deal with reluctant and hard-tasked\ntenants, but with punctual, though inimical, trustees, who paid to\nhim with charming regularity that portion of his income which he was\nallowed to spend. But that he was still tormented with the ambition\nof a splendid marriage it might be said of him that he was completely\nat his ease. Now, as he lit his cigarette, he would have been\nthoroughly comfortable, were it not that he was threatened with\ndisturbance by his son. Why should his son wish to see him, and thus\nbreak in upon him at the most charming hour of the day? Of course\nhis son would not come to him without having some business in hand\nwhich must be disagreeable. He had not the least desire to see his\nson,--and yet, as they were on amicable terms, he could not deny\nhimself after the receipt of his son's note. Just at one, as he\nfinished his first cigarette, Gerard was announced.\n\n\"Well, Gerard!\"\n\n\"Well, father,--how are you? You are looking as fresh as paint, sir.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment, if you mean one. I am pretty well. I\nthought you were hunting somewhere.\"\n\n\"So I am; but I have just come up to town to see you. I find you have\nbeen smoking;--may I light a cigar?\"\n\n\"I never do smoke cigars here, Gerard. I'll offer you a cigarette.\"\nThe cigarette was reluctantly offered, and accepted with a shrug.\n\"But you didn't come here merely to smoke, I dare say.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, sir. We do not often trouble each other, father; but\nthere are things about which I suppose we had better speak. I'm going\nto be married!\"\n\n\"To be married!\" The tone in which Mr. Maule, senior, repeated the\nwords was much the same as might be used by any ordinary father if\nhis son expressed an intention of going into the shoe-black business.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's a kind of thing men do sometimes.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--and it's a kind of thing that they sometimes repent of\nhaving done.\"\n\n\"Let us hope for the best. It is too late at any rate to think about\nthat, and as it is to be done, I have come to tell you.\"\n\n\"Very well. I suppose you are right to tell me. Of course you know\nthat I can do nothing for you; and I don't suppose that you can do\nanything for me. As far as your own welfare goes, if she has a large\nfortune,--\"\n\n\"She has no fortune.\"\n\n\"No fortune!\"\n\n\"Two or three thousand pounds perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then I look upon it as an act of simple madness, and can only say\nthat as such I shall treat it. I have nothing in my power, and\ntherefore I can neither do you good or harm; but I will not hear\nany particulars, and I can only advise you to break it off, let the\ntrouble be what it may.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not do that, sir.\"\n\n\"Then I have nothing more to say. Don't ask me to be present, and\ndon't ask me to see her.\"\n\n\"You haven't heard her name yet.\"\n\n\"I do not care one straw what her name is.\"\n\n\"It is Adelaide Palliser.\"\n\n\"Adelaide Muggins would be exactly the same thing to me. My dear\nGerard, I have lived too long in the world to believe that men can\ncoin into money the noble blood of well-born wives. Twenty thousand\npounds is worth more than all the blood of all the Howards, and\na wife even with twenty thousand pounds would make you a poor,\nembarrassed, and half-famished man.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose I shall be whole famished, as she certainly has not\ngot a quarter of that sum.\"\n\n\"No doubt you will.\"\n\n\"Yet, sir, married men with families have lived on my income.\"\n\n\"And on less than a quarter of it. The very respectable man who\nbrushes my clothes no doubt does so. But then you see he has been\nbrought up in that way. I suppose that you as a bachelor put by every\nyear at least half your income?\"\n\n\"I never put by a shilling, sir. Indeed, I owe a few hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"And yet you expect to keep a house over your head, and an expensive\nwife and family, with lady's maid, nurses, cook, footman, and grooms,\non a sum which has been hitherto insufficient for your own wants! I\ndidn't think you were such an idiot, my boy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"What will her dress cost?\"\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea.\"\n\n\"I dare say not. Probably she is a horsewoman. As far as I know\nanything of your life that is the sphere in which you will have made\nthe lady's acquaintance.\"\n\n\"She does ride.\"\n\n\"No doubt, and so do you; and it will be very easy to say whither you\nwill ride together if you are fools enough to get married. I can only\nadvise you to do nothing of the kind. Is there anything else?\"\n\nThere was much more to be said if Gerard could succeed in forcing his\nfather to hear him. Mr. Maule, who had hitherto been standing, seated\nhimself as he asked that last question, and took up the book which\nhad been prepared for his morning's delectation. It was evidently\nhis intention that his son should leave him. The news had been\ncommunicated to him, and he had said all that he could say on the\nsubject. He had at once determined to confine himself to a general\nview of the matter, and to avoid details,--which might be personal to\nhimself. But Gerard had been specially required to force his father\ninto details. Had he been left to himself he would certainly have\nthought that the conversation had gone far enough. He was inclined,\nalmost as well as his father, to avoid present discomfort. But when\nMiss Palliser had suddenly,--almost suddenly,--accepted him; and\nwhen he had found himself describing the prospects of his life in\nher presence and in that of Lady Chiltern, the question of the\nMaule Abbey inheritance had of necessity been discussed. At Maule\nAbbey there might be found a home for the married couple, and,--so\nthought Lady Chiltern,--the only fitting home. Mr. Maule, the father,\ncertainly did not desire to live there. Probably arrangements might\nbe made for repairing the house and furnishing it with Adelaide's\nmoney. Then, if Gerard Maule would be prudent, and give up hunting,\nand farm a little himself,--and if Adelaide would do her own\nhousekeeping and dress upon forty pounds a year, and if they would\nboth live an exemplary, model, energetic, and strictly economical\nlife, both ends might be made to meet. Adelaide had been quite\nenthusiastic as to the forty pounds, and had suggested that she would\ndo it for thirty. The housekeeping was a matter of course, and the\nmore so as a leg of mutton roast or boiled would be the beginning\nand the end of it. To Adelaide the discussion had been exciting and\npleasurable, and she had been quite in earnest when looking forward\nto a new life at Maule Abbey. After all there could be no such great\ndifficulty for a young married couple to live on \u00c2\u00a3800 a year, with\na house and garden of their own. There would be no carriage and no\nman servant till,--till old Mr. Maule was dead. The suggestion as to\nthe ultimate and desirable haven was wrapped up in ambiguous words.\n\"The property must be yours some day,\" suggested Lady Chiltern.\n\"If I outlive my father.\" \"We take that for granted; and then, you\nknow--\" So Lady Chiltern went on, dilating upon a future state of\nsquirearchal bliss and rural independence. Adelaide was enthusiastic;\nbut Gerard Maule,--after he had assented to the abandonment of his\nhunting, much as a man assents to being hung when the antecedents of\nhis life have put any option in the matter out of his power,--had\nsat silent and almost moody while the joys of his coming life were\ndescribed to him. Lady Chiltern, however, had been urgent in pointing\nout to him that the scheme of living at Maule Abbey could not be\ncarried out without his father's assistance. They all knew that Mr.\nMaule himself could not be affected by the matter, and they also\nknew that he had but very little power in reference to the property.\nBut the plan could not be matured without some sanction from him.\nTherefore there was still much more to be said when the father had\ncompleted the exposition of his views on marriage in general. \"I\nwanted to speak to you about the property,\" said Gerard. He had been\nspecially enjoined to be staunch in bringing his father to the point.\n\n\"And what about the property?\"\n\n\"Of course my marriage will not affect your interests.\"\n\n\"I should say not. It would be very odd if it did. As it is, your\nincome is much larger than mine.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that is, sir; but I suppose you will not refuse to\ngive me a helping hand if you can do so without disturbance to your\nown comfort.\"\n\n\"In what sort of way? Don't you think anything of that kind can be\nmanaged better by the lawyer? If there is a thing I hate, it is\nbusiness.\"\n\nGerard, remembering his promise to Lady Chiltern, did persevere,\nthough the perseverance went much against the grain with him. \"We\nthought, sir, that if you would consent we might live at Maule\nAbbey.\"\n\n\"Oh;--you did; did you?\"\n\n\"Is there any objection?\"\n\n\"Simply the fact that it is my house, and not yours.\"\n\n\"It belongs, I suppose, to the property; and as--\"\n\n\"As what?\" asked the father, turning upon the son with sharp angry\neyes, and with something of real animation in his face.\n\nGerard was very awkward in conveying his meaning to his father. \"And\nas,\" he continued,--\"as it must come to me, I suppose, some day, and\nit will be the proper sort of thing that we should live there then,\nI thought that you would agree that if we went and lived there now it\nwould be a good sort of thing to do.\"\n\n\"That was your idea?\"\n\n\"We talked it over with our friend, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Indeed! I am so much obliged to your friend, Lady Chiltern, for the\ninterest she takes in my affairs. Pray make my compliments to Lady\nChiltern, and tell her at the same time that, though no doubt I have\none foot in the grave, I should like to keep my house for the other\nfoot, though too probably I may never be able to drag it so far as\nMaule Abbey.\"\n\n\"But you don't think of living there.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, if you will inquire among any friends you may happen\nto know who understand the world better than Lady Chiltern seems\nto do, they will tell you that a son should not suggest to his\nfather the abandonment of the family property, because the father\nmay--probably--soon--be conveniently got rid of under ground.\"\n\n\"There was no thought of such a thing,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"It isn't decent. I say that with all due deference to Lady\nChiltern's better judgment. It's not the kind of thing that men\ndo. I care less about it than most men, but even I object to such\na proposition when it is made so openly. No doubt I am old.\" This\nassertion Mr. Maule made in a weak, quavering voice, which showed\nthat had his intention been that way turned in his youth, he might\nprobably have earned his bread on the stage.\n\n\"Nobody thought of your being old, sir.\"\n\n\"I shan't last long, of course. I am a poor feeble creature. But\nwhile I do live, I should prefer not to be turned out of my own\nhouse,--if Lady Chiltern could be induced to consent to such an\narrangement. My doctor seems to think that I might linger on for a\nyear or two,--with great care.\"\n\n\"Father, you know I was thinking of nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"We won't act the king and the prince any further, if you please.\nThe prince protested very well, and, if I remember right, the father\npretended to believe him. In my weak state you have rather upset me.\nIf you have no objection I would choose to be left to recover myself\na little.\"\n\n\"And is that all that you will say to me?\"\n\n\"Good heavens;--what more can you want? I will not--consent--to give\nup--my house at Maule Abbey for your use,--as long as I live. Will\nthat do? And if you choose to marry a wife and starve, I won't think\nthat any reason why I should starve too. Will that do? And your\nfriend, Lady Chiltern, may--go--and be d----d. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Good morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Gerard.\" So the interview was over, and Gerard Maule\nleft the room. The father, as soon as he was alone, immediately lit\nanother cigarette, took up his French novel, and went to work as\nthough he was determined to be happy and comfortable again without\nlosing a moment. But he found this to be beyond his power. He had\nbeen really disturbed, and could not easily compose himself. The\ncigarette was almost at once chucked into the fire, and the little\nvolume was laid on one side. Mr. Maule rose almost impetuously from\nhis chair, and stood with his back to the fire, contemplating the\nproposition that had been made to him.\n\nIt was actually true that he had been offended by the very faint idea\nof death which had been suggested to him by his son. Though he was\na man bearing no palpable signs of decay, in excellent health, with\ngood digestion,--who might live to be ninety,--he did not like to\nbe warned that his heir would come after him. The claim which had\nbeen put forward to Maule Abbey by his son had rested on the fact\nthat when he should die the place must belong to his son;--and the\nfact was unpleasant to him. Lady Chiltern had spoken of him behind\nhis back as being mortal, and in doing so had been guilty of an\nimpertinence. Maule Abbey, no doubt, was a ruined old house, in\nwhich he never thought of living,--which was not let to a tenant by\nthe creditors of his estate, only because its condition was unfit\nfor tenancy. But now Mr. Maule began to think whether he might not\npossibly give the lie to these people who were compassing his death,\nby returning to the halls of his ancestors, if not in the bloom of\nyouth, still in the pride of age. Why should he not live at Maule\nAbbey if this successful marriage could be effected? He almost knew\nhimself well enough to be aware that a month at Maule Abbey would\ndestroy him; but it is the proper thing for a man of fashion to have\na place of his own, and he had always been alive to the glory of\nbeing Mr. Maule of Maule Abbey. In preparing the way for the marriage\nthat was to come he must be so known. To be spoken of as the father\nof Maule of Maule Abbey would have been fatal to him. To be the\nfather of a married son at all was disagreeable, and therefore\nwhen the communication was made to him he had managed to be very\nunpleasant. As for giving up Maule Abbey,--! He fretted and fumed\nas he thought of the proposition through the hour which should have\nbeen to him an hour of enjoyment; and his anger grew hot against\nhis son as he remembered all that he was losing. At last, however,\nhe composed himself sufficiently to put on with becoming care his\nluxurious furred great coat, and then he sallied forth in quest of\nthe lady.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\"PURITY OF MORALS, FINN.\"\n\n\nMr. Quintus Slide was now, as formerly, the editor of the People's\nBanner, but a change had come over the spirit of his dream. His\nnewspaper was still the People's Banner, and Mr. Slide still\nprofessed to protect the existing rights of the people, and to demand\nnew rights for the people. But he did so as a Conservative. He had\nwatched the progress of things, and had perceived that duty called\nupon him to be the organ of Mr. Daubeny. This duty he performed with\ngreat zeal, and with an assumption of consistency and infallibility\nwhich was charming. No doubt the somewhat difficult task of veering\nround without inconsistency, and without flaw to his infallibility,\nwas eased by Mr. Daubeny's newly-declared views on Church matters.\nThe People's Banner could still be a genuine People's Banner in\nreference to ecclesiastical policy. And as that was now the subject\nmainly discussed by the newspapers, the change made was almost\nentirely confined to the lauding of Mr. Daubeny instead of Mr.\nTurnbull. Some other slight touches were no doubt necessary. Mr.\nDaubeny was the head of the Conservative party in the kingdom, and\nthough Mr. Slide himself might be of all men in the kingdom the most\ndemocratic, or even the most destructive, still it was essential that\nMr. Daubeny's organ should support the Conservative party all round.\nIt became Mr. Slide's duty to speak of men as heaven-born patriots\nwhom he had designated a month or two since as bloated aristocrats\nand leeches fattened on the blood of the people. Of course remarks\nwere made by his brethren of the press,--remarks which were intended\nto be very unpleasant. One evening newspaper took the trouble to\ndivide a column of its own into double columns, printing on one\nside of the inserted line remarks made by the People's Banner in\nSeptember respecting the Duke of ----, and the Marquis of ----, and\nSir ---- ----, which were certainly very harsh; and on the other side\nremarks equally laudatory as to the characters of the same titled\npoliticians. But a journalist, with the tact and experience of Mr.\nQuintus Slide, knew his business too well to allow himself to be\nharassed by any such small stratagem as that. He did not pause to\ndefend himself, but boldly attacked the meanness, the duplicity,\nthe immorality, the grammar, the paper, the type, and the wife of\nthe editor of the evening newspaper. In the storm of wind in which\nhe rowed it was unnecessary for him to defend his own conduct.\n\"And then,\" said he at the close of a very virulent and successful\narticle, \"the hirelings of ---- dare to accuse me of inconsistency!\"\nThe readers of the People's Banner all thought that their editor\nhad beaten his adversary out of the field.\n\nMr. Quintus Slide was certainly well adapted for his work. He could\nedit his paper with a clear appreciation of the kind of matter which\nwould best conduce to its success, and he could write telling leading\narticles himself. He was indefatigable, unscrupulous, and devoted\nto his paper. Perhaps his great value was shown most clearly in his\ndistinct appreciation of the low line of public virtue with which\nhis readers would be satisfied. A highly-wrought moral strain would\nhe knew well create either disgust or ridicule. \"If there is any\nbeastliness I 'ate it is 'igh-faluting,\" he has been heard to say to\nhis underlings. The sentiment was the same as that conveyed in the\n\"Point de z\u00c3\u00a8le\" of Talleyrand. \"Let's 'ave no d----d nonsense,\" he\nsaid on another occasion, when striking out from a leading article\na passage in praise of the patriotism of a certain public man. \"Mr.\nGresham is as good as another man, no doubt; what we want to know is\nwhether he's along with us.\" Mr. Gresham was not along with Mr. Slide\nat present, and Mr. Slide found it very easy to speak ill of Mr.\nGresham.\n\nMr. Slide one Sunday morning called at the house of Mr. Bunce in\nGreat Marlborough Street, and asked for Phineas Finn. Mr. Slide and\nMr. Bunce had an old acquaintance with each other, and the editor was\nnot ashamed to exchange a few friendly words with the law-scrivener\nbefore he was shown up to the member of Parliament. Mr. Bunce was an\noutspoken, eager, and honest politician,--with very little accurate\nknowledge of the political conditions by which he was surrounded,\nbut with a strong belief in the merits of his own class. He was a\nsober, hardworking man, and he hated all men who were not sober and\nhardworking. He was quite clear in his mind that all nobility should\nbe put down, and that all property in land should be taken away\nfrom men who were enabled by such property to live in idleness.\nWhat should be done with the land when so taken away was a question\nwhich he had not yet learnt to answer. At the present moment he\nwas accustomed to say very hard words of Mr. Slide behind his back,\nbecause of the change which had been effected in the People's\nBanner, and he certainly was not the man to shrink from asserting\nin a person's presence aught that he said in his absence. \"Well, Mr.\nConservative Slide,\" he said, stepping into the little back parlour,\nin which the editor was left while Mrs. Bunce went up to learn\nwhether the member of Parliament would receive his visitor.\n\n\"None of your chaff, Bunce.\"\n\n\"We have enough of your chaff, anyhow; don't we, Mr. Slide? I still\nsees the Banner, Mr. Slide,--most days; just for the joke of it.\"\n\n\"As long as you take it, Bunce, I don't care what the reason is.\"\n\n\"I suppose a heditor's about the same as a Cabinet Minister. You've\ngot to keep your place;--that's about it, Mr. Slide.\"\n\n\"We've got to tell the people who's true to 'em. Do you believe\nthat Gresham 'd ever have brought in a Bill for doing away with the\nChurch? Never;--not if he'd been Prime Minister till doomsday. What\nyou want is progress.\"\n\n\"That's about it, Mr. Slide.\"\n\n\"And where are you to get it? Did you ever hear that a rose by any\nother name 'd smell as sweet? If you can get progress from the\nConservatives, and you want progress, why not go to the Conservatives\nfor it? Who repealed the corn laws? Who gave us 'ousehold suffrage?\"\n\n\"I think I've been told all that before, Mr. Slide; them things\nweren't given by no manner of means, as I look at it. We just went in\nand took 'em. It was hall a haccident whether it was Cobden or Peel,\nGladstone or Disraeli, as was the servants we employed to do our\nwork. But Liberal is Liberal, and Conservative is Conservative. What\nare you, Mr. Slide, to-day?\"\n\n\"If you'd talk of things, Bunce, which you understand, you would not\ntalk quite so much nonsense.\"\n\nAt this moment Mrs. Bunce entered the room, perhaps preventing a\nquarrel, and offered to usher Mr. Slide up to the young member's\nroom. Phineas had not at first been willing to receive the gentleman,\nremembering that when they had last met the intercourse had not been\npleasant,--but he knew that enmities are foolish things, and that\nit did not become him to perpetuate a quarrel with such a man as Mr.\nQuintus Slide. \"I remember him very well, Mrs. Bunce.\"\n\n\"I know you didn't like him, Sir.\"\n\n\"Not particularly.\"\n\n\"No more don't I. No more don't Bunce. He's one of them as 'd say\na'most anything for a plate of soup and a glass of wine. That's what\nBunce says.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt me to see him.\"\n\n\"No, sir; it won't hurt you. It would be a pity indeed if the likes\nof him could hurt the likes of you.\" And so Mr. Quintus Slide was\nshown up into the room.\n\nThe first greeting was very affectionate, at any rate on the part of\nthe editor. He grasped the young member's hand, congratulated him\non his seat, and began his work as though he had never been all but\nkicked out of that very same room by its present occupant. \"Now you\nwant to know what I'm come about; don't you?\"\n\n\"No doubt I shall hear in good time, Mr. Slide.\"\n\n\"It's an important matter;--and so you'll say when you do hear. And\nit's one in which I don't know whether you'll be able to see your way\nquite clear.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, if it concerns me.\"\n\n\"It does.\" So saying, Mr. Slide, who had seated himself in an\narm-chair by the fireside opposite to Phineas, crossed his legs,\nfolded his arms on his breast, put his head a little on one side,\nand sat for a few moments in silence, with his eyes fixed on his\ncompanion's face. \"It does concern you, or I shouldn't be here.\nDo you know Mr. Kennedy,--the Right Honourable Robert Kennedy, of\nLoughlinter, in Scotland?\"\n\n\"I do know Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\n\"And do you know Lady Laura Kennedy, his wife?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"So I supposed. And do you know the Earl of Brentford, who is, I take\nit, father to the lady in question?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. You know that I do.\" For there had been a time in\nwhich Phineas had been subjected to the severest censure which the\nPeople's Banner could inflict upon him, because of his adherence\nto Lord Brentford, and the vials of wrath had been poured out by the\nhands of Mr. Quintus Slide himself.\n\n\"Very well. It does not signify what I know or what I don't. Those\npreliminary questions I have been obliged to ask as my justification\nfor coming to you on the present occasion. Mr. Kennedy has I believe\nbeen greatly wronged.\"\n\n\"I am not prepared to talk about Mr. Kennedy's affairs,\" said Phineas\ngravely.\n\n\"But unfortunately he is prepared to talk about them. That's the rub.\nHe has been ill-used, and he has come to the People's Banner for\nredress. Will you have the kindness to cast your eye down that slip?\"\nWhereupon the editor handed to Phineas a long scrap of printed paper,\namounting to about a column and a half of the People's Banner,\ncontaining a letter to the editor dated from Loughlinter, and signed\nRobert Kennedy at full length.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that you're going to publish this,\" said\nPhineas before he had read it.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"The man is a madman.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in the world easier than calling a man mad. It's\nwhat we do to dogs when we want to hang them. I believe Mr. Kennedy\nhas the management of his own property. He is not too mad for that.\nBut just cast your eye down and read it.\"\n\nPhineas did cast his eye down, and read the whole letter;--nor as\nhe read it could he bring himself to believe that the writer of it\nwould be judged to be mad from its contents. Mr. Kennedy had told\nthe whole story of his wrongs, and had told it well,--with piteous\ntruthfulness, as far as he himself knew and understood the truth. The\nletter was almost simple in its wailing record of his own desolation.\nWith a marvellous absence of reticence he had given the names of all\npersons concerned. He spoke of his wife as having been, and being,\nunder the influence of Mr. Phineas Finn;--spoke of his own former\nfriendship for that gentleman, who had once saved his life when\nhe fell among thieves, and then accused Phineas of treachery in\nbetraying that friendship. He spoke with bitter agony of the injury\ndone him by the Earl, his wife's father, in affording a home to his\nwife, when her proper home was at Loughlinter. And then declared\nhimself willing to take the sinning woman back to his bosom. \"That\nshe had sinned is certain,\" he said; \"I do not believe she has sinned\nas some sin; but, whatever be her sin, it is for a man to forgive as\nhe hopes for forgiveness.\" He expatiated on the absolute and almost\ndivine right which it was intended that a husband should exercise\nover his wife, and quoted both the Old and New Testament in proof of\nhis assertions. And then he went on to say that he appealed to public\nsympathy, through the public press, because, owing to some gross\ninsufficiency in the laws of extradition, he could not call upon the\nmagistracy of a foreign country to restore to him his erring wife.\nBut he thought that public opinion, if loudly expressed, would have\nan effect both upon her and upon her father, which his private words\ncould not produce. \"I wonder very greatly that you should put such a\nletter as that into type,\" said Phineas when he had read it all.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we put it into type?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that you'll publish it.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't we publish it?\"\n\n\"It's a private quarrel between a man and his wife. What on earth\nhave the public got to do with that?\"\n\n\"Private quarrels between gentlemen and ladies have been public\naffairs for a long time past. You must know that very well.\"\n\n\"When they come into court they are.\"\n\n\"In court and out of court! The morale of our aristocracy,--what\nyou call the Upper Ten,--would be at a low ebb indeed if the public\npress didn't act as their guardians. Do you think that if the Duke\nof ---- beats his wife black and blue, nothing is to be said about it\nunless the Duchess brings her husband into court? Did you ever know\nof a separation among the Upper Ten, that wasn't handled by the\npress one way or the other? It's my belief that there isn't a peer\namong 'em all as would live with his wife constant, if it was not\nfor the press;--only some of the very old ones, who couldn't help\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"And you call yourself a Conservative?\"\n\n\"Never mind what I call myself. That has nothing to do with what\nwe're about now. You see that letter, Finn. There is nothing little\nor dirty about us. We go in for morals and purity of life, and we\nmean to do our duty by the public without fear or favour. Your name\nis mentioned there in a manner that you won't quite like, and I think\nI am acting uncommon kind by you in showing it to you before we\npublish it.\" Phineas, who still held the slip in his hand, sat silent\nthinking of the matter. He hated the man. He could not endure the\nfeeling of being called Finn by him without showing his resentment.\nAs regarded himself, he was thoroughly well inclined to kick Mr.\nSlide and his Banner into the street. But he was bound to think\nfirst of Lady Laura. Such a publication as this, which was now\nthreatened, was the misfortune which the poor woman dreaded more\nthan any other. He, personally, had certainly been faultless in the\nmatter. He had never addressed a word of love to Mr. Kennedy's wife\nsince the moment in which she had told him that she was engaged to\nmarry the Laird of Loughlinter. Were the letter to be published he\ncould answer it, he thought, in such a manner as to defend himself\nand her without damage to either. But on her behalf he was bound to\nprevent this publicity if it could be prevented;--and he was bound\nalso, for her sake, to allow himself to be called Finn by this most\nobnoxious editor. \"In the ordinary course of things, Finn, it will\ncome out to-morrow morning,\" said the obnoxious editor.\n\n\"Every word of it is untrue,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"You say that, of course.\"\n\n\"And I should at once declare myself willing to make such a statement\non oath. It is a libel of the grossest kind, and of course there\nwould be a prosecution. Both Lord Brentford and I would be driven to\nthat.\"\n\n\"We should be quite indifferent. Mr. Kennedy would hold us harmless.\nWe're straightforward. My showing it to you would prove that.\"\n\n\"What is it you want, Mr. Slide?\"\n\n\"Want! You don't suppose we want anything. If you think that the\ncolumns of the People's Banner are to be bought, you must have\nopinions respecting the press of the day which make me pity you as\none grovelling in the very dust. The daily press of London is pure\nand immaculate. That is, the morning papers are. Want, indeed! What\ndo you think I want?\"\n\n\"I have not the remotest idea.\"\n\n\"Purity of morals, Finn;--punishment for the guilty;--defence for the\ninnocent;--support for the weak;--safety for the oppressed;--and a\nrod of iron for the oppressors!\"\n\n\"But that is a libel.\"\n\n\"It's very heavy on the old Earl, and upon you, and upon Lady\nLaura;--isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's a libel,--as you know. You tell me that purity of morals can be\nsupported by such a publication as this! Had you meant to go on with\nit, you would hardly have shown it to me.\"\n\n\"You're in the wrong box there, Finn. Now I'll tell you what\nwe'll do,--on behalf of what I call real purity. We'll delay the\npublication if you'll undertake that the lady shall go back to her\nhusband.\"\n\n\"The lady is not in my hands.\"\n\n\"She's under your influence. You were with her over at Dresden not\nmuch more than a month ago. She'd go sharp enough if you told her.\"\n\n\"You never made a greater mistake in your life.\"\n\n\"Say that you'll try.\"\n\n\"I certainly will not do so.\"\n\n\"Then it goes in to-morrow,\" said Mr. Quintus Slide, stretching out\nhis hand and taking back the slip.\n\n\"What on earth is your object?\"\n\n\"Morals! Morals! We shall be able to say that we've done our best to\npromote domestic virtue and secure forgiveness for an erring wife.\nYou've no notion, Finn, in your mind of what will soon be the hextent\nof the duties, privileges, and hinfluences of the daily press;--the\ndaily morning press, that is; for I look on those little evening\nscraps as just so much paper and ink wasted. You won't interfere,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will;--if you'll give me time. Where is Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it? Do you write over to Lady Laura and the\nold lord and tell them that if she'll undertake to be at Loughlinter\nwithin a month this shall be suppressed. Will you do that?\"\n\n\"Let me first see Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\nMr. Slide thought a while over that matter. \"Well,\" said he at last,\n\"you can see Kennedy if you will. He came up to town four or five\ndays ago, and he's staying at an hotel in Judd Street.\"\n\n\"An hotel in Judd Street?\"\n\n\"Yes;--Macpherson's in Judd Street. I suppose he likes to keep among\nthe Scotch. I don't think he ever goes out of the house, and he's\nwaiting in London till this thing is published.\"\n\n\"I will go and see him,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he murdered you;--but that's between you and\nhim.\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"And I shall hear from you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Phineas, hesitating as he made the promise. \"Yes, you\nshall hear from me.\"\n\n\"We've got our duty to do, and we mean to do it. If we see that we\ncan induce the lady to go back to her husband, we shall habstain from\npublishing, and virtue will be its own reward. I needn't tell you\nthat such a letter as that would sell a great many copies, Finn.\"\nThen, at last, Mr. Slide arose and departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nMACPHERSON'S HOTEL.\n\n\nPhineas, when he was left alone, found himself greatly at a loss as\nto what he had better do. He had pledged himself to see Mr. Kennedy,\nand was not much afraid of encountering personal violence at the\nhands of that gentleman. But he could think of nothing which he could\nwith advantage say to Mr. Kennedy. He knew that Lady Laura would not\nreturn to her husband. Much as she dreaded such exposure as was now\nthreatened, she would not return to Loughlinter to avoid even that.\nHe could not hold out any such hope to Mr. Kennedy;--and without\ndoing so how could he stop the publication? He thought of getting\nan injunction from the Vice-Chancellor;--but it was now Sunday, and\nhe had understood that the publication would appear on the morrow,\nunless stopped by some note from himself. He thought of finding some\nattorney, and taking him to Mr. Kennedy; but he knew that Mr. Kennedy\nwould be deterred by no attorney. Then he thought of Mr. Low. He\nwould see Mr. Kennedy first, and then go to Mr. Low's house.\n\nJudd Street runs into the New Road near the great stations of the\nMidland and Northern Railways, and is a highly respectable street.\nBut it can hardly be called fashionable, as is Piccadilly; or\ncentral, as is Charing Cross; or commercial, as is the neighbourhood\nof St. Paul's. Men seeking the shelter of an hotel in Judd Street\nmost probably prefer decent and respectable obscurity to other\nadvantages. It was some such feeling, no doubt, joined to the fact\nthat the landlord had originally come from the neighbourhood of\nLoughlinter, which had taken Mr. Kennedy to Macpherson's Hotel.\nPhineas, when he called at about three o'clock on Sunday afternoon,\nwas at once informed by Mrs. Macpherson that Mr. Kennedy was \"nae\ndoubt at hame, but was nae willing to see folk on the Saaboth.\"\nPhineas pleaded the extreme necessity of his business, alleging\nthat Mr. Kennedy himself would regard its nature as a sufficient\njustification for such Sabbath-breaking,--and sent up his card.\nThen there came down a message to him. Could not Mr. Finn postpone\nhis visit to the following morning? But Phineas declared that it\ncould not be postponed. Circumstances, which he would explain to\nMr. Kennedy, made it impossible. At last he was desired to walk up\nstairs, though Mrs. Macpherson, as she showed him the way, evidently\nthought that her house was profaned by such wickedness.\n\nMacpherson in preparing his house had not run into that extravagance\nof architecture which has lately become so common in our hotels.\nIt was simply an ordinary house, with the words \"Macpherson's\nHotel\" painted on a semi-circular board over the doorway. The front\nparlour had been converted into a bar, and in the back parlour the\nMacphersons lived. The staircase was narrow and dirty, and in the\nfront drawing-room,--with the chamber behind for his bedroom,--Mr.\nKennedy was installed. Mr. Macpherson probably did not expect any\ncustomers beyond those friendly Scots who came up to London from his\nown side of the Highlands. Mrs. Macpherson, as she opened the door,\nwas silent and almost mysterious. Such a breach of the law might\nperhaps be justified by circumstances of which she knew nothing, but\nshould receive no sanction from her which she could avoid. So she did\nnot even whisper the name.\n\nMr. Kennedy, as Phineas entered, slowly rose from his chair, putting\ndown the Bible which had been in his hands. He did not speak at once,\nbut looked at his visitor over the spectacles which he wore. Phineas\nthought that he was even more haggard in appearance and aged than\nwhen they two had met hardly three months since at Loughlinter. There\nwas no shaking of hands, and hardly any pretence at greeting. Mr.\nKennedy simply bowed his head, and allowed his visitor to begin the\nconversation.\n\n\"I should not have come to you on such a day as this, Mr. Kennedy--\"\n\n\"It is a day very unfitted for the affairs of the world,\" said Mr.\nKennedy.\n\n\"Had not the matter been most pressing in regard both to time and its\nown importance.\"\n\n\"So the woman told me, and therefore I have consented to see you.\"\n\n\"You know a man of the name of--Slide, Mr. Kennedy?\" Mr. Kennedy\nshook his head. \"You know the editor of the People's Banner?\" Again\nhe shook his head. \"You have, at any rate, written a letter for\npublication to that newspaper.\"\n\n\"Need I consult you as to what I write?\"\n\n\"But he,--the editor,--has consulted me.\"\n\n\"I can have nothing to do with that.\"\n\n\"This Mr. Slide, the editor of the People's Banner, has just been\nwith me, having in his hand a printed letter from you, which,--you\nwill excuse me, Mr. Kennedy,--is very libellous.\"\n\n\"I will bear the responsibility of that.\"\n\n\"But you would not wish to publish falsehood about your wife, or even\nabout me.\"\n\n\"Falsehood! sir; how dare you use that word to me? Is it false to say\nthat she has left my house? Is it false to say that she is my wife,\nand cannot desert me, as she has done, without breaking her vows, and\ndisregarding the laws both of God and man? Am I false when I say that\nI gave her no cause? Am I false when I offer to take her back, let\nher faults be what they may have been? Am I false when I say that her\nfather acts illegally in detaining her? False! False in your teeth!\nFalsehood is villany, and it is not I that am the villain.\"\n\n\"You have joined my name in the accusation.\"\n\n\"Because you are her paramour. I know you now;--viper that was warmed\nin my bosom! Will you look me in the face and tell me that, had\nit not been for you, she would not have strayed from me?\" To this\nPhineas could make no answer. \"Is it not true that when she went with\nme to the altar you had been her lover?\"\n\n\"I was her lover no longer, when she once told me that she was to be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"Has she never spoken to you of love since? Did she not warn you from\nthe house in her faint struggle after virtue? Did she not whistle you\nback again when she found the struggle too much for her? When I asked\nyou to the house, she bade you not come. When I desired that you\nmight never darken my eyes again, did she not seek you? With whom was\nshe walking on the villa grounds by the river banks when she resolved\nthat she would leave all her duties and desert me? Will you dare\nto say that you were not then in her confidence? With whom was she\ntalking when she had the effrontery to come and meet me at the house\nof the Prime Minister, which I was bound to attend? Have you not been\nwith her this very winter in her foreign home?\"\n\n\"Of course I have,--and you sent her a message by me.\"\n\n\"I sent no message. I deny it. I refused to be an accomplice in your\ndouble guilt. I laid my command upon you that you should not visit my\nwife in my absence, and you disobeyed, and you are an adulterer. Who\nare you that you are to come for ever between me and my wife?\"\n\n\"I never injured you in thought or deed. I come to you now because I\nhave seen a printed letter which contains a gross libel upon myself.\"\n\n\"It is printed then?\" he asked, in an eager tone.\n\n\"It is printed; but it need not, therefore, be published. It is a\nlibel, and should not be published. I shall be forced to seek redress\nat law. You cannot hope to regain your wife by publishing false\naccusations against her.\"\n\n\"They are true. I can prove every word that I have written. She dare\nnot come here, and submit herself to the laws of her country. She is\na renegade from the law, and you abet her in her sin. But it is not\nvengeance that I seek. 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.'\"\n\n\"It looks like vengeance, Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\n\"Is it for you to teach me how I shall bear myself in this time of my\ngreat trouble?\" Then suddenly he changed; his voice falling from one\nof haughty defiance to a low, mean, bargaining whisper. \"But I'll\ntell you what I'll do. If you will say that she shall come back again\nI'll have it cancelled, and pay all the expenses.\"\n\n\"I cannot bring her back to you.\"\n\n\"She'll come if you tell her. If you'll let them understand that she\nmust come they'll give way. You can try it at any rate.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind. Why should I ask her to submit\nherself to misery?\"\n\n\"Misery! What misery? Why should she be miserable? Must a woman need\nbe miserable because she lives with her husband? You hear me say that\nI will forgive everything. Even she will not doubt me when I say so,\nbecause I have never lied to her. Let her come back to me, and she\nshall live in peace and quiet, and hear no word of reproach.\"\n\n\"I can have nothing to do with it, Mr. Kennedy.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you shall abide my wrath.\" With that he sprang quickly\nround, grasping at something which lay upon a shelf near him, and\nPhineas saw that he was armed with a pistol. Phineas, who had\nhitherto been seated, leaped to his legs; but the pistol in a moment\nwas at his head, and the madman pulled at the trigger. But the\nmechanism of the instrument required that some bolt should be loosed\nbefore the hammer would fall upon the nipple, and the unhandy wretch\nfor an instant fumbled over the work so that Phineas, still facing\nhis enemy, had time to leap backwards towards the door. But Kennedy,\nthough he was awkward, still succeeded in firing before our friend\ncould leave the room. Phineas heard the thud of the bullet, and knew\nthat it must have passed near his head. He was not struck, however;\nand the man, frightened at his own deed, abstained from the second\nshot, or loitered long enough in his remorse to enable his prey to\nescape. With three or four steps Phineas leaped down the stairs, and,\nfinding the front door closed, took shelter within Mrs. Macpherson's\nbar. \"The man is mad,\" he said; \"did you not hear the shot?\" The\nwoman was too frightened to reply, but stood trembling, holding\nPhineas by the arm. There was nobody in the house, she said, but\nshe and the two lasses. \"Nae doobt the Laird's by ordinaire,\" she\nsaid at last. She had known of the pistol; but had not dared to have\nit removed. She and Macpherson had only feared that he would hurt\nhimself,--and had at last agreed, as day after day passed without any\ninjury from the weapon, to let the thing remain unnoticed. She had\nheard the shot, and had been sure that one of the two men above would\nhave been killed.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Then, sir, you shall abide my wrath.\"]\n\n\nPhineas was now in great doubt as to what duty was required of him.\nHis first difficulty consisted in this,--that his hat was still in\nMr. Kennedy's room, and that Mrs. Macpherson altogether refused to go\nand fetch it. While they were still discussing this, and Phineas had\nnot as yet resolved whether he would first get a policeman or go at\nonce to Mr. Low, the bell from the room was rung furiously. \"It's\nthe Laird,\" said Mrs. Macpherson, \"and if naebody waits on him he'll\nsurely be shooting ane of us.\" The two girls were now outside the bar\nshaking in their shoes, and evidently unwilling to face the danger.\nAt last the door of the room above was opened, and our hero's hat was\nsent rolling down the stairs.\n\nIt was clear to Phineas that the man was so mad as to be not even\naware of the act he had perpetrated. \"He'll do nothing more with the\npistol,\" he said, \"unless he should attempt to destroy himself.\" At\nlast it was determined that one of the girls should be sent to fetch\nMacpherson home from the Scotch Church, and that no application\nshould be made at once to the police. It seemed that the Macphersons\nknew the circumstances of their guest's family, and that there was a\ncousin of his in London who was the only one with whom he seemed to\nhave any near connection. The thing that had occurred was to be told\nto this cousin, and Phineas left his address, so that if it should be\nthought necessary he might be called upon to give his account of the\naffair. Then, in his perturbation of spirit, he asked for a glass of\nbrandy; and having swallowed it, was about to take his leave. \"The\nbrandy wull be saxpence, sir,\" said Mrs. Macpherson, as she wiped the\ntears from her eyes.\n\nHaving paid for his refreshment, Phineas got into a cab, and had\nhimself driven to Mr. Low's house. He had escaped from his peril,\nand now again it became his strongest object to stop the publication\nof the letter which Slide had shown him. But as he sat in the cab\nhe could not hinder himself from shuddering at the danger which had\nbeen so near to him. He remembered his sensation as he first saw the\nglimmer of the barrel of the pistol, and then became aware of the\nman's first futile attempt, and afterwards saw the flash and heard\nthe hammer fall at the same moment. He had once stood up to be fired\nat in a duel, and had been struck by the ball. But nothing in that\nencounter had made him feel sick and faint through every muscle as\nhe had felt just now. As he sat in the cab he was aware that but for\nthe spirits he had swallowed he would be altogether overcome, and\nhe doubted even now whether he would be able to tell his story to\nMr. Low. Luckily perhaps for him neither Mr. Low nor his wife were\nat home. They were out together, but were expected in between five\nand six. Phineas declared his purpose of waiting for them, and\nrequested that Mr. Low might be asked to join him in the dining-room\nimmediately on his return. In this way an hour was allowed him, and\nhe endeavoured to compose himself. Still, even at the end of the\nhour, his heart was beating so violently that he could hardly control\nthe motion of his own limbs. \"Low, I have been shot at by a madman,\"\nhe said, as soon as his friend entered the room. He had determined to\nbe calm, and to speak much more of the document in the editor's hands\nthan of the attempt which had been made on his own life; but he had\nbeen utterly unable to repress the exclamation.\n\n\"Shot at?\"\n\n\"Yes; by Robert Kennedy; the man who was Chancellor of the\nDuchy;--almost within a yard of my head.\" Then he sat down and burst\nout into a fit of convulsive laughter.\n\nThe story about the pistol was soon told, and Mr. Low was of opinion\nthat Phineas should not have left the place without calling in\npolicemen and giving an account to them of the transaction. \"But\nI had something else on my mind,\" said Phineas, \"which made it\nnecessary that I should see you at once;--something more important\neven than this madman's attack upon me. He has written a most\nfoul-mouthed attack upon his wife, which is already in print, and\nwill I fear be published to-morrow morning.\" Then he told the story\nof the letter. \"Slide no doubt will be at the People's Banner\noffice to-night, and I can see him there. Perhaps when I tell\nhim what has occurred he will consent to drop the publication\naltogether.\"\n\nBut in this view of the matter Mr. Low did not agree with his\nvisitor. He argued the case with a deliberation which to Phineas in\nhis present state of mind was almost painful. If the whole story of\nwhat had occurred were told to Quintus Slide, that worthy protector\nof morals and caterer for the amusement of the public would, Mr.\nLow thought, at once publish the letter and give a statement of the\noccurrence at Macpherson's Hotel. There would be nothing to hinder\nhim from so profitable a proceeding, as he would know that no one\nwould stir on behalf of Lady Laura in the matter of the libel, when\nthe tragedy of Mr. Kennedy's madness should have been made known. The\npublication would be as safe as attractive. But if Phineas should\nabstain from going to him at all, the same calculation which had\ninduced him to show the letter would induce him to postpone the\npublication, at any rate for another twenty-four hours. \"He means\nto make capital out of his virtue; and he won't give that up for\nthe sake of being a day in advance. In the meantime we will get an\ninjunction from the Vice-Chancellor to stop the publication.\"\n\n\"Can we do that in one day?\"\n\n\"I think we can. Chancery isn't what it used to be,\" said Mr. Low,\nwith a sigh. \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go this very moment\nto Pickering.\" Mr. Pickering at this time was one of the three\nVice-Chancellors. \"It isn't exactly the proper thing for counsel\nto call on a judge on a Sunday afternoon with the direct intention\nof influencing his judgment for the following morning; but this\nis a case in which a point may be strained. When such a paper as\nthe People's Banner gets hold of a letter from a madman, which\nif published would destroy the happiness of a whole family, one\nshouldn't stick at a trifle. Pickering is just the man to take a\ncommon-sense view of the matter. You'll have to make an affidavit\nin the morning, and we can get the injunction served before two or\nthree o'clock. Mr. Septimus Slope, or whatever his name is, won't\ndare to publish it after that. Of course, if it comes out to-morrow\nmorning, we shall have been too late; but this will be our best\nchance.\" So Mr. Low got his hat and umbrella, and started for the\nVice-Chancellor's house. \"And I tell you what, Phineas;--do you stay\nand dine here. You are so flurried by all this, that you are not fit\nto go anywhere else.\"\n\n\"I am flurried.\"\n\n\"Of course you are. Never mind about dressing. Do you go up and tell\nGeorgiana all about it;--and have dinner put off half-an-hour. I must\nhunt Pickering up, if I don't find him at home.\" Then Phineas did\ngo upstairs and tell Georgiana--otherwise Mrs. Low--the whole story.\nMrs. Low was deeply affected, declaring her opinion very strongly as\nto the horrible condition of things, when madmen could go about with\npistols, and without anybody to take care against them. But as to\nLady Laura Kennedy, she seemed to think that the poor husband had\ngreat cause of complaint, and that Lady Laura ought to be punished.\nWives, she thought, should never leave their husbands on any pretext;\nand, as far as she had heard the story, there had been no pretext at\nall in the case. Her sympathies were clearly with the madman, though\nshe was quite ready to acknowledge that any and every step should be\ntaken which might be adverse to Mr. Quintus Slide.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nMADAME GOESLER IS SENT FOR.\n\n\nWhen the elder Mr. Maule had sufficiently recovered from the\nperturbation of mind and body into which he had been thrown by the\nill-timed and ill-worded proposition of his son to enable him to\nresume the accustomed tenour of his life, he arrayed himself in his\nmorning winter costume, and went forth in quest of a lady. So much\nwas told some few chapters back, but the name of the lady was not\nthen disclosed. Starting from Victoria Street, Westminster, he walked\nslowly across St. James's Park and the Green Park till he came out in\nPiccadilly, near the bottom of Park Lane. As he went up the Lane he\nlooked at his boots, at his gloves, and at his trousers, and saw that\nnothing was unduly soiled. The morning air was clear and frosty, and\nhad enabled him to dispense with the costly comfort of a cab. Mr.\nMaule hated cabs in the morning,--preferring never to move beyond the\ntether of his short daily constitutional walk. A cab for going out to\ndinner was a necessity;--but his income would not stand two or three\ncabs a day. Consequently he never went north of Oxford Street, or\neast of the theatres, or beyond Eccleston Square towards the river.\nThe regions of South Kensington and New Brompton were a trouble to\nhim, as he found it impossible to lay down a limit in that direction\nwhich would not exclude him from things which he fain would not\nexclude. There are dinners given at South Kensington which such a\nman as Mr. Maule cannot afford not to eat. In Park Lane he knocked\nat the door of a very small house,--a house that might almost be\ncalled tiny by comparison of its dimensions with those around it, and\nthen asked for Madame Goesler. Madame Goesler had that morning gone\ninto the country. Mr. Maule in his blandest manner expressed some\nsurprise, having understood that she had not long since returned from\nHarrington Hall. To this the servant assented, but went on to explain\nthat she had been in town only a day or two when she was summoned\ndown to Matching by a telegram. It was believed, the man said, that\nthe Duke of Omnium was poorly. \"Oh! indeed;--I am sorry to hear\nthat,\" said Mr. Maule, with a wry face. Then, with steps perhaps a\nlittle less careful, he walked back across the park to his club. On\ntaking up the evening paper he at once saw a paragraph stating that\nthe Duke of Omnium's condition to-day was much the same as yesterday;\nbut that he had passed a quiet night. That very distinguished but\nnow aged physician, Sir Omicron Pie, was still staying at Matching\nPriory. \"So old Omnium is going off the hooks at last,\" said Mr.\nMaule to a club acquaintance.\n\nThe club acquaintance was in Parliament, and looked at the matter\nfrom a strictly parliamentary point of view. \"Yes, indeed. It has\ngiven a deal of trouble.\"\n\nMr. Maule was not parliamentary, and did not understand.\n\"Why trouble,--except to himself? He'll leave his Garter and\nstrawberry-leaves, and all his acres behind him.\"\n\n\"What is Gresham to do about the Exchequer when he comes in? I don't\nknow whom he's to send there. They talk of Bonteen, but Bonteen\nhasn't half weight enough. They'll offer it to Monk, but Monk 'll\nnever take office again.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Planty Pall was Chancellor of the Exchequer. I suppose he\nmust give that up now?\"\n\nThe parliamentary acquaintance looked up at the unparliamentary man\nwith that mingled disgust and pity which parliamentary gentlemen and\nladies always entertain for those who have not devoted their minds\nto the constitutional forms of the country. \"The Chancellor of the\nExchequer can't very well sit in the House of Lords, and Palliser\ncan't very well help becoming Duke of Omnium. I don't know whether he\ncan take the decimal coinage question with him, but I fear not. They\ndon't like it at all in the city.\"\n\n\"I believe I'll go and play a rubber of whist,\" said Mr. Maule.\nHe played his whist, and lost thirty points without showing the\nslightest displeasure, either by the tone of his voice or by any\ngrimace of his countenance. And yet the money which passed from his\nhands was material to him. But he was great at such efforts as these,\nand he understood well the fluctuations of the whist table. The\nhalf-crowns which he had paid were only so much invested capital.\n\nHe dined at his club this evening, and joined tables with another\nacquaintance who was not parliamentary. Mr. Parkinson Seymour was\na man much of his own stamp, who cared not one straw as to any\ndifficulty which the Prime Minister might feel in filling the office\nof Chancellor of the Exchequer. There were men by dozens ready and\nwilling, and no doubt able,--or at any rate, one as able as the\nother,--to manage the taxes of the country. But the blue riband and\nthe Lord Lieutenancy of Barsetshire were important things,--which\nwould now be in the gift of Mr. Daubeny; and Lady Glencora would at\nlast be a duchess,--with much effect on Society, either good or bad.\nAnd Planty Pall would be a duke, with very much less capability, as\nMr. Parkinson Seymour thought, for filling that great office, than\nthat which the man had displayed who was now supposed to be dying\nat Matching. \"He has been a fine old fellow,\" said Mr. Parkinson\nSeymour.\n\n\"Very much so. There ain't many of that stamp left.\"\n\n\"I don't know one,\" continued the gentleman, with enthusiasm. \"They\nall go in for something now, just as Jones goes in for being a bank\nclerk. They are politicians, or gamblers, or, by heaven, tradesmen,\nas some of them are. The Earl of Tydvil and Lord Merthyr are in\npartnership together working their own mines,--by the Lord, with a\nregular deed of partnership, just like two cheesemongers. The Marquis\nof Maltanops has a share in a bitter beer house at Burton. And\nthe Duke of Discount, who married old Ballance's daughter, and is\nbrother-in-law to young George Advance, retains his interest in the\nhouse in Lombard Street. I know it for a fact.\"\n\n\"Old Omnium was above that kind of thing,\" said Mr. Maule.\n\n\"Lord bless you;--quite another sort of man. There is nothing left\nlike it now. With a princely income I don't suppose he ever put by\na shilling in his life. I've heard it said that he couldn't afford\nto marry, living in the manner in which he chose to live. And he\nunderstood what dignity meant. None of them understand that now.\nDukes are as common as dogs in the streets, and a marquis thinks no\nmore of himself than a market-gardener. I'm very sorry the old duke\nshould go. The nephew may be very good at figures, but he isn't fit\nto fill his uncle's shoes. As for Lady Glencora, no doubt as things\ngo now she's very popular, but she's more like a dairy-maid than a\nduchess to my way of thinking.\"\n\nThere was not a club in London, and hardly a drawing-room in which\nsomething was not said that day in consequence of the two bulletins\nwhich had appeared as to the condition of the old Duke;--and in no\nclub and in no drawing-room was a verdict given against the dying\nman. It was acknowledged everywhere that he had played his part in a\nnoble and even in a princely manner, that he had used with a becoming\ngrace the rich things that had been given him, and that he had\ndeserved well of his country. And yet, perhaps, no man who had lived\nduring the same period, or any portion of the period, had done less,\nor had devoted himself more entirely to the consumption of good\nthings without the slightest idea of producing anything in return!\nBut he had looked like a duke, and known how to set a high price on\nhis own presence.\n\nTo Mr. Maule the threatened demise of this great man was not without\na peculiar interest. His acquaintance with Madame Goesler had not\nbeen of long standing, nor even as yet had it reached a close\nintimacy. During the last London season he had been introduced to\nher, and had dined twice at her house. He endeavoured to make himself\nagreeable to her, and he flattered himself that he had succeeded. It\nmay be said of him generally, that he had the gift of making himself\npleasant to women. When last she had parted from him with a smile,\nrepeating the last few words of some good story which he had told\nher, the idea struck him that she after all might perhaps be the\nwoman. He made his inquiries, and had learned that there was not\na shadow of a doubt as to her wealth,--or even to her power of\ndisposing of that wealth as she pleased. So he wrote to her a pretty\nlittle note, in which he gave to her the history of that good story,\nhow it originated with a certain Cardinal, and might be found in\ncertain memoirs,--which did not, however, bear the best reputation in\nthe world. Madame Goesler answered his note very graciously, thanking\nhim for the reference, but declaring that the information given was\nalready so sufficient that she need prosecute the inquiry no further.\nMr. Maule smiled as he declared to himself that those memoirs would\ncertainly be in Madame Goesler's hands before many days were over.\nHad his intimacy been a little more advanced he would have sent the\nvolume to her.\n\nBut he also learned that there was some romance in the lady's life\nwhich connected her with the Duke of Omnium. He was diligent in\nseeking information, and became assured that there could be no chance\nfor himself, or for any man, as long as the Duke was alive. Some\nhinted that there had been a private marriage,--a marriage, however,\nwhich Madame Goesler had bound herself by solemn oaths never to\ndisclose. Others surmised that she was the Duke's daughter. Hints\nwere, of course, thrown out as to a connection of another kind,--but\nwith no great vigour, as it was admitted on all hands that Lady\nGlencora, the Duke's niece by marriage, and the mother of the Duke's\nfuture heir, was Madame Goesler's great friend. That there was\na mystery was a fact very gratifying to the world at large; and\nperhaps, upon the whole, the more gratifying in that nothing had\noccurred to throw a gleam of light upon the matter since the fact\nof the intimacy had become generally known. Mr. Maule was aware,\nhowever, that there could be no success for him as long as the Duke\nlived. Whatever might be the nature of the alliance, it was too\nstrong to admit of any other while it lasted. But the Duke was a very\nold,--or, at least, a very infirm man. And now the Duke was dying.\nOf course it was only a chance. Mr. Maule knew the world too well\nto lay out any great portion of his hopes on a prospect so doubtful.\nBut it was worth a struggle, and he would so struggle that he might\nenjoy success, should success come, without laying himself open\nto the pangs of disappointment. Mr. Maule hated to be unhappy or\nuncomfortable, and therefore never allowed any aspiration to proceed\nto such length as to be inconvenient to his feelings should it not be\ngratified.\n\nIn the meantime Madame Max Goesler had been sent for, and had hurried\noff to Matching almost without a moment's preparation. As she sat in\nthe train, thinking of it, tears absolutely filled her eyes. \"Poor\ndear old man,\" she said to herself; and yet the poor dear old man had\nsimply been a trouble to her, adding a most disagreeable task to her\nlife, and one which she was not called on to perform by any sense of\nduty. \"How is he?\" she said anxiously, when she met Lady Glencora in\nthe hall at Matching. The two women kissed each other as though they\nhad been almost sisters since their birth. \"He is a little better\nnow, but he was very uneasy when we telegraphed this morning. He\nasked for you twice, and then we thought it better to send.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course it was best,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\"I WOULD DO IT NOW.\"\n\n\nThough it was rumoured all over London that the Duke of Omnium was\ndying, his Grace had been dressed and taken out of his bed-chamber\ninto a sitting-room, when Madame Goesler was brought into his\npresence by Lady Glencora Palliser. He was reclining in a great\narm-chair, with his legs propped up on cushions, and a respectable\nold lady in a black silk gown and a very smart cap was attending\nto his wants. The respectable old lady took her departure when the\nyounger ladies entered the room, whispering a word of instruction\nto Lady Glencora as she went. \"His Grace should have his broth at\nhalf-past four, my lady, and a glass and a half of champagne. His\nGrace won't drink his wine out of a tumbler, so perhaps your ladyship\nwon't mind giving it him at twice.\"\n\n\"Marie has come,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"I knew she would come,\" said the old man, turning his head round\nslowly on the back of his chair. \"I knew she would be good to me to\nthe last.\" And he laid his withered hand on the arm of his chair, so\nthat the woman whose presence gratified him might take it within hers\nand comfort him.\n\n\"Of course I have come,\" said Madame Goesler, standing close by him\nand putting her left arm very lightly on his shoulder. It was all\nthat she could do for him, but it was in order that she might do this\nthat she had been summoned from London to his side. He was wan and\nworn and pale,--a man evidently dying, the oil of whose lamp was all\nburned out; but still as he turned his eyes up to the woman's face\nthere was a remnant of that look of graceful fain\u00c3\u00a9ant nobility which\nhad always distinguished him. He had never done any good, but he\nhad always carried himself like a duke, and like a duke he carried\nhimself to the end.\n\n\"He is decidedly better than he was this morning,\" said Lady\nGlencora.\n\n\"It is pretty nearly all over, my dear. Sit down, Marie. Did they\ngive you anything after your journey?\"\n\n\"I could not wait, Duke.\"\n\n\"I'll get her some tea,\" said Lady Glencora. \"Yes, I will. I'll do it\nmyself. I know he wants to say a word to you alone.\" This she added\nin a whisper.\n\nBut sick people hear everything, and the Duke did hear the whisper.\n\"Yes, my dear;--she is quite right. I am glad to have you for a\nminute alone. Do you love me, Marie?\"\n\nIt was a foolish question to be asked by a dying old man of a young\nwoman who was in no way connected with him, and whom he had never\nseen till some three or four years since. But it was asked with\nfeverish anxiety, and it required an answer. \"You know I love you,\nDuke. Why else should I be here?\"\n\n\"It is a pity you did not take the coronet when I offered it you.\"\n\n\"Nay, Duke, it was no pity. Had I done so, you could not have had us\nboth.\"\n\n\"I should have wanted only you.\"\n\n\"And I should have stood aloof,--in despair to think that I was\nseparating you from those with whom your Grace is bound up so\nclosely. We have ever been dear friends since that.\"\n\n\"Yes;--we have been dear friends. But--\" Then he closed his eyes, and\nput his long thin fingers across his face, and lay back awhile in\nsilence, still holding her by the other hand. \"Kiss me, Marie,\" he\nsaid at last; and she stooped over him and kissed his forehead. \"I\nwould do it now if I thought it would serve you.\" She only shook her\nhead and pressed his hand closely. \"I would; I would. Such things\nhave been done, my dear.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"I would; I would.\"]\n\n\n\"Such a thing shall never be done by me, Duke.\"\n\nThey remained seated side by side, the one holding the other by the\nhand, but without uttering another word, till Lady Glencora returned\nbringing a cup of tea and a morsel of toast in her own hand. Madame\nGoesler, as she took it, could not help thinking how it might have\nbeen with her had she accepted the coronet which had been offered. In\nthat case she might have been a duchess herself, but assuredly she\nwould not have been waited upon by a future duchess. As it was, there\nwas no one in that family who had not cause to be grateful to her.\nWhen the Duke had sipped a spoonful of his broth, and swallowed his\nallowance of wine, they both left him, and the respectable old lady\nwith the smart cap was summoned back to her position. \"I suppose he\nwhispered something very gracious to you,\" Lady Glencora said when\nthey were alone.\n\n\"Very gracious.\"\n\n\"And you were gracious to him,--I hope.\"\n\n\"I meant to be.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you did. Poor old man! If you had done what he asked you I\nwonder whether his affection would have lasted as it has done.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Lady Glen. He would have known that I had injured\nhim.\"\n\n\"I declare I think you are the wisest woman I ever met, Madame Max.\nI am sure you are the most discreet. If I had always been as wise as\nyou are!\"\n\n\"You always have been wise.\"\n\n\"Well,--never mind. Some people fall on their feet like cats; but you\nare one of those who never fall at all. Others tumble about in the\nmost unfortunate way, without any great fault of their own. Think of\nthat poor Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's true about Mr. Kennedy. You've heard of it of course\nin London.\" But as it happened Madame Goesler had not heard the\nstory. \"I got it from Barrington Erle, who always writes to me if\nanything happens. Mr. Kennedy has fired a pistol at the head of\nPhineas Finn.\"\n\n\"At Phineas Finn!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Mr. Finn went to him at some hotel in London. No\none knows what it was about; but Mr. Kennedy went off in a fit of\njealousy, and fired a pistol at him.\"\n\n\"He did not hit him?\"\n\n\"It seems not. Mr. Finn is one of those Irish gentlemen who always\nseem to be under some special protection. The ball went through his\nwhiskers and didn't hurt him.\"\n\n\"And what has become of Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\n\"Nothing, it seems. Nobody sent for the police, and he has been\nallowed to go back to Scotland,--as though a man were permitted by\nspecial Act of Parliament to try to murder his wife's lover. It would\nbe a bad law, because it would cause such a deal of bloodshed.\"\n\n\"But he is not Lady Laura's lover,\" said Madame Goesler, gravely.\n\n\"That would make the law difficult, because who is to say whether a\nman is or is not a woman's lover?\"\n\n\"I don't think there was ever anything of that kind.\"\n\n\"They were always together, but I dare say it was Platonic. I\nbelieve these kind of things generally are Platonic. And as for Lady\nLaura;--heavens and earth!--I suppose it must have been Platonic.\nWhat did the Duke say to you?\"\n\n\"He bade me kiss him.\"\n\n\"Poor dear old man. He never ceases to speak of you when you are\naway, and I do believe he could not have gone in peace without seeing\nyou. I doubt whether in all his life he ever loved any one as he\nloves you. We dine at half-past seven, dear: and you had better just\ngo into his room for a moment as you come down. There isn't a soul\nhere except Sir Omicron Pie, and Plantagenet, and two of the other\nnephews,--whom, by the bye, he has refused to see. Old Lady Hartletop\nwanted to come.\"\n\n\"And you wouldn't have her?\"\n\n\"I couldn't have refused. I shouldn't have dared. But the Duke would\nnot hear of it. He made me write to say that he was too weak to see\nany but his nearest relatives. Then he made me send for you, my\ndear;--and now he won't see the relatives. What shall we do if Lady\nHartletop turns up? I'm living in fear of it. You'll have to be shut\nup out of sight somewhere if that should happen.\"\n\nDuring the next two or three days the Duke was neither much better\nnor much worse. Bulletins appeared in the newspapers, though no one\nat Matching knew from whence they came. Sir Omicron Pie, who, having\nretired from general practice, was enabled to devote his time to the\n\"dear Duke,\" protested that he had no hand in sending them out. He\ndeclared to Lady Glencora every morning that it was only a question\nof time. \"The vital spark is on the spring,\" said Sir Omicron, waving\na gesture heavenward with his hand. For three days Mr. Palliser was\nat Matching, and he duly visited his uncle twice a day. But not a\nsyllable was ever said between them beyond the ordinary words of\ncompliments. Mr. Palliser spent his time with his private secretary,\nworking out endless sums and toiling for unapproachable results in\nreference to decimal coinage. To him his uncle's death would be a\ngreat blow, as in his eyes to be Chancellor of the Exchequer was much\nmore than to be Duke of Omnium. For herself Lady Glencora was nearly\nequally indifferent, though she did in her heart of hearts wish that\nher son should go to Eton with the title of Lord Silverbridge.\n\nOn the third morning the Duke suddenly asked a question of Madame\nGoesler. The two were again sitting near to each other, and the Duke\nwas again holding her hand; but Lady Glencora was also in the room.\n\"Have you not been staying with Lord Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Yes, Duke.\"\n\n\"He is a friend of yours.\"\n\n\"I used to know his wife before they were married.\"\n\n\"Why does he go on writing me letters about a wood?\" This he asked in\na wailing voice, as though he were almost weeping. \"I know nothing\nof Lord Chiltern. Why does he write to me about the wood? I wish he\nwouldn't write to me.\"\n\n\"He does not know that you are ill, Duke. By-the-bye, I promised to\nspeak to Lady Glencora about it. He says that foxes are poisoned at\nTrumpeton Wood.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" said the Duke. \"No one would poison\nfoxes in my wood. I wish you'd see about it, Glencora. Plantagenet\nwill never attend to anything. But he shouldn't write to me. He ought\nto know better than to write letters to me. I will not have people\nwriting letters to me. Why don't they write to Fothergill?\" and then\nthe Duke began in truth to whimper.\n\n\"I'll put it all right,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"I wish you would. I don't like them to say there are no foxes; and\nPlantagenet never will attend to anything.\" The wife had long since\nceased to take the husband's part when accusations such as this were\nbrought against him. Nothing could make Mr. Palliser think it worth\nhis while to give up any shred of his time to such a matter as the\npreservation of foxes.\n\nOn the fourth day the catastrophe happened which Lady Glencora had\nfeared. A fly with a pair of horses from the Matching Road station\nwas driven up to the door of the Priory, and Lady Hartletop was\nannounced. \"I knew it,\" said Lady Glencora, slapping her hand down on\nthe table in the room in which she was sitting with Madame Goesler.\nUnfortunately the old lady was shown into the room before Madame\nGoesler could escape, and they passed each other on the threshold.\nThe Dowager Marchioness of Hartletop was a very stout old lady, now\nperhaps nearer to seventy than sixty-five years of age, who for many\nyears had been the intimate friend of the Duke of Omnium. In latter\ndays, during which she had seen but little of the Duke himself, she\nhad heard of Madame Max Goesler, but she had never met that lady.\nNevertheless, she knew the rival friend at a glance. Some instinct\ntold her that that woman with the black brow and the dark curls was\nMadame Goesler. In these days the Marchioness was given to waddling\nrather than to walking, but she waddled past the foreign female,--as\nshe had often called Madame Max,--with a dignified though duck-like\nstep. Lady Hartletop was a bold woman; and it must be supposed that\nshe had some heart within her or she would hardly have made such\na journey with such a purpose. \"Dear Lady Hartletop,\" said Lady\nGlencora, \"I am so sorry that you should have had this trouble.\"\n\n\"I must see him,\" said Lady Hartletop. Lady Glencora put both her\nhands together piteously, as though deprecating her visitor's wrath.\n\"I must insist on seeing him.\"\n\n\"Sir Omicron has refused permission to any one to visit him.\"\n\n\"I shall not go till I've seen him. Who was that lady?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine,\" said Lady Glencora, drawing herself up.\n\n\"She is--, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"That is her name, Lady Hartletop. She is my most intimate friend.\"\n\n\"Does she see the Duke?\"\n\nLady Glencora, when expressing her fear that the woman would come\nto Matching, had confessed that she was afraid of Lady Hartletop.\nAnd a feeling of dismay--almost of awe--had fallen upon her on\nhearing the Marchioness announced. But when she found herself thus\ncross-examined, she resolved that she would be bold. Nothing on\nearth should induce her to open the door of the Duke's room to Lady\nHartletop, nor would she scruple to tell the truth about Madame\nGoesler. \"Yes,\" she said, \"Madame Goesler does see the Duke.\"\n\n\"And I am to be excluded!\"\n\n\"My dear Lady Hartletop, what can I do? The Duke for some time past\nhas been accustomed to the presence of my friend, and therefore her\npresence now is no disturbance. Surely that can be understood.\"\n\n\"I should not disturb him.\"\n\n\"He would be inexpressibly excited were he to know that you were even\nin the house. And I could not take it upon myself to tell him.\"\n\nThen Lady Hartletop threw herself upon a sofa, and began to weep\npiteously. \"I have known him for more than forty years,\" she moaned,\nthrough her choking tears. Lady Glencora's heart was softened, and\nshe was kind and womanly; but she would not give way about the Duke.\nIt would, as she knew, have been useless, as the Duke had declared\nthat he would see no one except his eldest nephew, his nephew's wife,\nand Madame Goesler.\n\nThat evening was very dreadful to all of them at Matching,--except\nto the Duke, who was never told of Lady Hartletop's perseverance.\nThe poor old woman could not be sent away on that afternoon, and was\ntherefore forced to dine with Mr. Palliser. He, however, was warned\nby his wife to say nothing in the lady's presence about his uncle,\nand he received her as he would receive any other chance guest\nat his wife's table. But the presence of Madame Goesler made the\nchief difficulty. She herself was desirous of disappearing for that\nevening, but Lady Glencora would not permit it. \"She has seen you,\nmy dear, and asked about you. If you hide yourself, she'll say all\nsorts of things.\" An introduction was therefore necessary, and Lady\nHartletop's manner was grotesquely grand. She dropped a very low\ncurtsey, and made a very long face, but she did not say a word. In\nthe evening the Marchioness sat close to Lady Glencora, whispering\nmany things about the Duke; and condescending at last to a final\nentreaty that she might be permitted to see him on the following\nmorning. \"There is Sir Omicron,\" said Lady Glencora, turning round\nto the little doctor. But Lady Hartletop was too proud to appeal to\nSir Omicron, who, as a matter of course, would support the orders of\nLady Glencora. On the next morning Madame Goesler did not appear at\nthe breakfast-table, and at eleven Lady Hartletop was taken back to\nthe train in Lady Glencora's carriage. She had submitted herself to\ndiscomfort, indignity, fatigue, and disappointment; and it had all\nbeen done for love. With her broad face, and her double chin, and her\nheavy jowl, and the beard that was growing round her lips, she did\nnot look like a romantic woman; but, in spite of appearances, romance\nand a duck-like waddle may go together. The memory of those forty\nyears had been strong upon her, and her heart was heavy because she\ncould not see that old man once again. Men will love to the last,\nbut they love what is fresh and new. A woman's love can live on the\nrecollection of the past, and cling to what is old and ugly. \"What\nan episode!\" said Lady Glencora, when the unwelcome visitor was\ngone;--\"but it's odd how much less dreadful things are than you think\nthey will be. I was frightened when I heard her name; but you see\nwe've got through it without much harm.\"\n\nA week passed by, and still the Duke was living. But now he was too\nweak to be moved from one room to another, and Madame Goesler passed\ntwo hours each day sitting by his bedside. He would lie with his hand\nout upon the coverlid, and she would put hers upon it; but very few\nwords passed between them. He grumbled again about the Trumpeton\nWoods, and Lord Chiltern's interference, and complained of his\nnephew's indifference. As to himself and his own condition, he seemed\nto be, at any rate, without discomfort, and was certainly free from\nfear. A clergyman attended him, and gave him the sacrament. He took\nit,--as the champagne prescribed by Sir Omicron, or the few mouthfuls\nof chicken broth which were administered to him by the old lady with\nthe smart cap; but it may be doubted whether he thought much more of\nthe one remedy than of the other. He knew that he had lived, and that\nthe thing was done. His courage never failed him. As to the future,\nhe neither feared much nor hoped much; but was, unconsciously,\nsupported by a general trust in the goodness and the greatness of\nthe God who had made him what he was. \"It is nearly done now, Marie,\"\nhe said to Madame Goesler one evening. She only pressed his hand in\nanswer. His condition was too well understood between them to allow\nof her speaking to him of any possible recovery. \"It has been a great\ncomfort to me that I have known you,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\n\"A great comfort;--only I wish it had been sooner. I could have\ntalked to you about things which I never did talk of to any one. I\nwonder why I should have been a duke, and another man a servant.\"\n\n\"God Almighty ordained such difference.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I have not done it well;--but I have tried; indeed I have\ntried.\" Then she told him he had ever lived as a great nobleman ought\nto live. And, after a fashion, she herself believed what she was\nsaying. Nevertheless, her nature was much nobler than his; and she\nknew that no man should dare to live idly as the Duke had lived.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE DUKE'S WILL.\n\n\nOn the ninth day after Madame Goesler's arrival the Duke died, and\nLady Glencora Palliser became Duchess of Omnium. But the change\nprobably was much greater to Mr. Palliser than to his wife. It would\nseem to be impossible to imagine a greater change than had come upon\nhim. As to rank, he was raised from that of a simple commoner to the\nvery top of the tree. He was made master of almost unlimited wealth,\nGarters, and lord-lieutenancies; and all the added grandeurs which\ncome from high influence when joined to high rank were sure to be\nhis. But he was no more moved by these things than would have been a\ngod, or a block of wood. His uncle was dead; but his uncle had been\nan old man, and his grief on that score was moderate. As soon as his\nuncle's body had been laid in the family vault at Gatherum, men would\ncall him Duke of Omnium; and then he could never sit again in the\nHouse of Commons. It was in that light, and in that light only, that\nhe regarded the matter. To his uncle it had been everything to be\nDuke of Omnium. To Plantagenet Palliser it was less than nothing.\nHe had lived among men and women with titles all his life, himself\nuntitled, but regarded by them as one of themselves, till the thing,\nin his estimation, had come to seem almost nothing. One man walked\nout of a room before another man; and he, as Chancellor of the\nExchequer, had, during a part of his career, walked out of most rooms\nbefore most men. But he cared not at all whether he walked out first\nor last,--and for him there was nothing else in it. It was a toy that\nwould perhaps please his wife, but he doubted even whether she would\nnot cease to be Lady Glencora with regret. In himself this thing that\nhad happened had absolutely crushed him. He had won for himself by\nhis own aptitudes and his own industry one special position in the\nempire,--and that position, and that alone, was incompatible with the\nrank which he was obliged to assume! His case was very hard, and he\nfelt it;--but he made no complaint to human ears. \"I suppose you must\ngive up the Exchequer,\" his wife said to him. He shook his head, and\nmade no reply. Even to her he could not explain his feelings.\n\nI think, too, that she did regret the change in her name, though she\nwas by no means indifferent to the rank. As Lady Glencora she had\nmade a reputation which might very possibly fall away from her as\nDuchess of Omnium. Fame is a skittish jade, more fickle even than\nFortune, and apt to shy, and bolt, and plunge away on very trifling\ncauses. As Lady Glencora Palliser she was known to every one, and had\nalways done exactly as she had pleased. The world in which she lived\nhad submitted to her fantasies, and had placed her on a pedestal from\nwhich, as Lady Glencora, nothing could have moved her. She was by no\nmeans sure that the same pedestal would be able to carry the Duchess\nof Omnium. She must begin again, and such beginnings are dangerous.\nAs Lady Glencora she had almost taken upon herself to create a\nrivalry in society to certain very distinguished, and indeed\nillustrious, people. There were only two houses in London, she used\nto say, to which she never went. The \"never\" was not quite true;--but\nthere had been something in it. She doubted whether as Duchess of\nOmnium she could go on with this. She must lay down her mischief,\nand abandon her eccentricity, and in some degree act like other\nduchesses. \"The poor old man,\" she said to Madame Goesler; \"I wish\nhe could have gone on living a little longer.\" At this time the\ntwo ladies were alone together at Matching. Mr. Palliser, with the\ncousins, had gone to Gatherum, whither also had been sent all that\nremained of the late Duke, in order that fitting funeral obsequies\nmight be celebrated over the great family vault.\n\n\"He would hardly have wished it himself, I think.\"\n\n\"One never knows,--and as far as one can look into futurity one has\nno idea what would be one's own feelings. I suppose he did enjoy\nlife.\"\n\n\"Hardly, for the last twelve months,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"I think he did. He was happy when you were about him; and he\ninterested himself about things. Do you remember how much he used to\nthink of Lady Eustace and her diamonds? When I first knew him he was\ntoo magnificent to care about anything.\"\n\n\"I suppose his nature was the same.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; his nature was the same, but he was strong enough to\nrestrain his nature, and wise enough to know that his magnificence\nwas incompatible with ordinary interests. As he got to be older he\nbroke down, and took up with mere mortal gossip. But I think it must\nhave made him happier.\"\n\n\"He showed his weakness in coming to me,\" said Madame Goesler,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Of course he did;--not in liking your society, but in wanting to\ngive you his name. I have often wondered what kind of things he used\nto say to that old Lady Hartletop. That was in his full grandeur,\nand he never condescended to speak much then. I used to think him so\nhard; but I suppose he was only acting his part. I used to call him\nthe Grand Lama to Plantagenet when we were first married,--before\nPlanty was born. I shall always call him Silverbridge now instead of\nPlanty.\"\n\n\"I would let others do that.\"\n\n\"Of course I was joking; but others will, and he will be spoilt.\nI wonder whether he will live to be a Grand Lama or a popular\nMinister. There cannot be two positions further apart. My husband,\nno doubt, thinks a good deal of himself as a statesman and a clever\npolitician,--at least I suppose he does; but he has not the slightest\nreverence for himself as a nobleman. If the dear old Duke were\nhobbling along Piccadilly, he was conscious that Piccadilly was\ngraced by his presence, and never moved without being aware that\npeople looked at him, and whispered to each other,--'There goes the\nDuke of Omnium.' Plantagenet considers himself inferior to a sweeper\nwhile on the crossing, and never feels any pride of place unless he\nis sitting on the Treasury Bench with his hat over his eyes.\"\n\n\"He'll never sit on the Treasury Bench again.\"\n\n\"No;--poor dear. He's an Othello now with a vengeance, for his\noccupation is gone. I spoke to him about your friend and the foxes,\nand he told me to write to Mr. Fothergill. I will as soon as it's\ndecent. I fancy a new duchess shouldn't write letters about foxes\ntill the old Duke is buried. I wonder what sort of a will he'll have\nmade. There's nothing I care twopence for except his pearls. No man\nin England had such a collection of precious stones. They'd been\nyours, my dear, if you had consented to be Mrs. O.\"\n\nThe Duke was buried and the will was read, and Plantagenet Palliser\nwas addressed as Duke of Omnium by all the tenantry and retainers\nof the family in the great hall of Gatherum Castle. Mr. Fothergill,\nwho had upon occasion in former days been driven by his duty to\nremonstrate with the heir, was all submission. Planty Pall had come\nto the throne, and half a county was ready to worship him. But he\ndid not know how to endure worship, and the half county declared\nthat he was stern and proud, and more haughty even than his uncle.\nAt every \"Grace\" that was flung at him he winced and was miserable,\nand declared to himself that he should never become accustomed to\nhis new life. So he sat all alone, and meditated how he might best\nreconcile the forty-eight farthings which go to a shilling with that\nthorough-going useful decimal, fifty.\n\nBut his meditations did not prevent him from writing to his wife, and\non the following morning, Lady Glencora,--as she shall be called now\nfor the last time,--received a letter from him which disturbed her a\ngood deal. She was in her room when it was brought to her, and for\nan hour after reading it hardly knew how to see her guest and friend,\nMadame Goesler. The passage in the letter which produced this dismay\nwas as follows:--\"He has left to Madame Goesler twenty thousand\npounds and all his jewels. The money may be very well, but I think\nhe has been wrong about the jewellery. As to myself I do not care a\nstraw, but you will be sorry; and then people will talk. The lawyers\nwill, of course, write to her, but I suppose you had better tell her.\nThey seem to think that the stones are worth a great deal of money;\nbut I have long learned never to believe any statement that is made\nto me. They are all here, and I suppose she will have to send some\nauthorised person to have them packed. There is a regular inventory,\nof which a copy shall be sent to her by post as soon as it can be\nprepared.\" Now it must be owned that the duchess did begrudge her\nfriend the duke's collection of pearls and diamonds.\n\nAbout noon they met. \"My dear,\" she said, \"you had better hear your\ngood fortune at once. Read that,--just that side. Plantagenet is\nwrong in saying that I shall regret it. I don't care a bit about\nit. If I want a ring or a brooch he can buy me one. But I never did\ncare about such things, and I don't now. The money is all just as it\nshould be.\" Madame Goesler read the passage, and the blood mounted\nup into her face. She read it very slowly, and when she had finished\nreading it she was for a moment or two at a loss for her words to\nexpress herself. \"You had better send one of Garnett's people,\"\nsaid the Duchess, naming the house of a distinguished jeweller and\ngoldsmith in London.\n\n\"It will hardly need,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"You had better be careful. There is no knowing what they are worth.\nHe spent half his income on them, I believe, during part of his\nlife.\" There was a roughness about the Duchess of which she was\nherself conscious, but which she could not restrain, though she knew\nthat it betrayed her chagrin.\n\nMadame Goesler came gently up to her and touched her arm caressingly.\n\"Do you remember,\" said Madame Goesler, \"a small ring with a black\ndiamond,--I suppose it was a diamond,--which he always wore?\"\n\n\"I remember that he always did wear such a ring.\"\n\n\"I should like to have that,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"You have them all,--everything. He makes no distinction.\"\n\n\"I should like to have that, Lady Glen,--for the sake of the hand\nthat wore it. But, as God is great above us, I will never take aught\nelse that has belonged to the Duke.\"\n\n\"Not take them!\"\n\n\"Not a gem; not a stone; not a shilling.\"\n\n\"But you must.\"\n\n\"I rather think that I can be under no such obligation,\" she said,\nlaughing. \"Will you write to Mr. Palliser,--or I should say, to the\nDuke,--to-night, and tell him that my mind is absolutely made up?\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not do that.\"\n\n\"Then I must. As it is, I shall have pleasant memories of his Grace.\nAccording to my ability I have endeavoured to be good to him, and I\nhave no stain on my conscience because of his friendship. If I took\nhis money and his jewels,--or rather your money and your jewels,--do\nyou think I could say as much?\"\n\n\"Everybody takes what anybody leaves them by will.\"\n\n\"I will be an exception to the rule, Lady Glen. Don't you think that\nyour friendship is more to me than all the diamonds in London?\"\n\n\"You shall have both, my dear,\" said the Duchess,--quite in earnest\nin her promise. Madame Goesler shook her head. \"Nobody ever\nrepudiates legacies. The Queen would take the jewels if they were\nleft to her.\"\n\n\"I am not the Queen. I have to be more careful what I do than any\nqueen. I will take nothing under the Duke's will. I will ask a boon\nwhich I have already named, and if it be given me as a gift by\nthe Duke's heir, I will wear it till I die. You will write to Mr.\nPalliser?\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it,\" said the Duchess.\n\n\"Then I will write myself.\" And she did write, and of all the rich\nthings which the Duke of Omnium had left to her, she took nothing but\nthe little ring with the black stone which he had always worn on his\nfinger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nAN EDITOR'S WRATH.\n\n\nOn that Sunday evening in London Mr. Low was successful in finding\nthe Vice-Chancellor, and the great judge smiled and nodded, listened\nto the story, and acknowledged that the circumstances were very\npeculiar. He thought that an injunction to restrain the publication\nmight be given at once upon Mr. Finn's affidavit; and that the\npeculiar circumstances justified the peculiarity of Mr. Low's\napplication. Whether he would have said as much had the facts\nconcerned the families of Mr. Joseph Smith and his son-in-law Mr.\nJohn Jones, instead of the Earl of Brentford and the Right Honourable\nRobert Kennedy, some readers will perhaps doubt, and may doubt also\nwhether an application coming from some newly-fledged barrister would\nhave been received as graciously as that made by Mr. Low, Q.C. and\nM.P.,--who would probably himself soon sit on some lofty legal bench.\nOn the following morning Phineas and Mr. Low,--and no doubt also Mr.\nVice-Chancellor Pickering,--obtained early copies of the People's\nBanner, and were delighted to find that Mr. Kennedy's letter did not\nappear in it. Mr. Low had made his calculation rightly. The editor,\nconsidering that he would gain more by having the young member of\nParliament and the Standish family, as it were, in his hands than by\nthe publication of a certain libellous letter, had resolved to put\nthe document back for at least twenty-four hours, even though the\nyoung member neither came nor wrote as he had promised. The letter\ndid not appear, and before ten o'clock Phineas Finn had made his\naffidavit in a dingy little room behind the Vice-Chancellor's Court.\nThe injunction was at once issued, and was of such potency that\nshould any editor dare to publish any paper therein prohibited, that\neditor and that editor's newspaper would assuredly be crumpled up in\na manner very disagreeable, if not altogether destructive. Editors\nof newspapers are self-willed, arrogant, and stiff-necked, a race\nof men who believe much in themselves and little in anything else,\nwith no feelings of reverence or respect for matters which are\naugust enough to other men;--but an injunction from a Court of\nChancery is a power which even an editor respects. At about noon\nVice-Chancellor Pickering's injunction was served at the office of\nthe People's Banner in Quartpot Alley, Fleet Street. It was done\nin duplicate,--or perhaps in triplicate,--so that there should be\nno evasion; and all manner of crumpling was threatened in the event\nof any touch of disobedience. All this happened on Monday, March the\nfirst, while the poor dying Duke was waiting impatiently for the\narrival of his friend at Matching. Phineas was busy all the morning\ntill it was time that he should go down to the House. For as soon as\nhe could leave Mr. Low's chambers in Lincoln's Inn he had gone to\nJudd Street, to inquire as to the condition of the man who had tried\nto murder him. He there saw Mr. Kennedy's cousin, and received an\nassurance from that gentleman that Robert Kennedy should be taken\ndown at once to Loughlinter. Up to that moment not a word had been\nsaid to the police as to what had been done. No more notice had been\ntaken of the attempt to murder than might have been necessary had Mr.\nKennedy thrown a clothes-brush at his visitor's head. There was the\nlittle hole in the post of the door with the bullet in it, just six\nfeet above the ground; and there was the pistol, with five chambers\nstill loaded, which Macpherson had cunningly secured on his return\nfrom church, and given over to the cousin that same evening. There\nwas certainly no want of evidence, but nobody was disposed to use it.\n\nAt noon the injunction was served in Quartpot Alley, and was put into\nMr. Slide's hands on his arrival at the office at three o'clock. That\ngentleman's duties required his attendance from three till five in\nthe afternoon, and then again from nine in the evening till any hour\nin the morning at which he might be able to complete the People's\nBanner for that day's use. He had been angry with Phineas when the\nSunday night passed without a visit or letter at the office, as\na promise had been made that there should be either a visit or a\nletter; but he had felt sure, as he walked into the city from his\nsuburban residence at Camden Town, that he would now find some\ncommunication on the great subject. The matter was one of most\nserious importance. Such a letter as that which was in his possession\nwould no doubt create much surprise, and receive no ordinary\nattention. A People's Banner could hardly ask for a better bit of\ngood fortune than the privilege of first publishing such a letter. It\nwould no doubt be copied into every London paper, and into hundreds\nof provincial papers, and every journal so copying it would be\nbound to declare that it was taken from the columns of the People's\nBanner. It was, indeed, addressed \"To the Editor of the People's\nBanner\" in the printed slip which Mr. Slide had shown to Phineas\nFinn, though Kennedy himself had not prefixed to it any such\ndirection. And the letter, in the hands of Quintus Slide, would\nnot simply have been a letter. It might have been groundwork for,\nperhaps, some half-dozen leading articles, all of a most attractive\nkind. Mr. Slide's high moral tone upon such an occasion would have\nbeen qualified to do good to every British matron, and to add\nvirtues to the Bench of Bishops. All this he had postponed with some\ninadequately defined idea that he could do better with the property\nin his hands by putting himself into personal communication with the\npersons concerned. If he could manage to reconcile such a husband\nto such a wife,--or even to be conspicuous in an attempt to do so;\nand if he could make the old Earl and the young Member of Parliament\nfeel that he had spared them by abstaining from the publication, the\nresults might be very beneficial. His conception of the matter had\nbeen somewhat hazy, and he had certainly made a mistake. But, as\nhe walked from his home to Quartpot Alley, he little dreamed of\nthe treachery with which he had been treated. \"Has Phineas Finn\nbeen here?\" he asked as he took his accustomed seat within a small\ncloset, that might be best described as a glass cage. Around him lay\nthe debris of many past newspapers, and the germs of many future\npublications. To all the world except himself it would have been a\nchaos, but to him, with his experience, it was admirable order. No;\nMr. Finn had not been there. And then, as he was searching among the\nletters for one from the Member for Tankerville, the injunction was\nthrust into his hands. To say that he was aghast is but a poor form\nof speech for the expression of his emotion.\n\nHe had been \"done\"--\"sold,\"--absolutely robbed by that\nwretchedly-false Irishman whom he had trusted with all the confidence\nof a candid nature and an open heart! He had been most treacherously\nmisused! Treachery was no adequate word for the injury inflicted\non him. The more potent is a man, the less accustomed to endure\ninjustice, and the more his power to inflict it,--the greater is the\nsting and the greater the astonishment when he himself is made to\nsuffer. Newspaper editors sport daily with the names of men of whom\nthey do not hesitate to publish almost the severest words that can\nbe uttered;--but let an editor be himself attacked, even without\nhis name, and he thinks that the thunderbolts of heaven should fall\nupon the offender. Let his manners, his truth, his judgment, his\nhonesty, or even his consistency be questioned, and thunderbolts\nare forthcoming, though they may not be from heaven. There should\ncertainly be a thunderbolt or two now, but Mr. Slide did not at first\nquite see how they were to be forged.\n\nHe read the injunction again and again. As far as the document went\nhe knew its force, and recognised the necessity of obedience. He\nmight, perhaps, be able to use the information contained in the\nletter from Mr. Kennedy, so as to harass Phineas and Lady Laura and\nthe Earl, but he was at once aware that it must not be published.\nAn editor is bound to avoid the meshes of the law, which are always\ninfinitely more costly to companies, or things, or institutions, than\nthey are to individuals. Of fighting with Chancery he had no notion;\nbut it should go hard with him if he did not have a fight with\nPhineas Finn. And then there arose another cause for deep sorrow. A\nparagraph was shown to him in a morning paper of that day which must,\nhe thought, refer to Mr. Kennedy and Phineas Finn. \"A rumour has\nreached us that a member of Parliament, calling yesterday afternoon\nupon a right honourable gentleman, a member of a late Government, at\nhis hotel, was shot at by the latter in his sitting room. Whether\nthe rumour be true or not we have no means of saying, and therefore\nabstain from publishing names. We are informed that the gentleman who\nused the pistol was out of his mind. The bullet did not take effect.\"\nHow cruel it was that such information should have reached the hands\nof a rival, and not fallen in the way of the People's Banner! And\nwhat a pity that the bullet should have been wasted! The paragraph\nmust certainly refer to Phineas Finn and Kennedy. Finn, a Member of\nParliament, had been sent by Slide himself to call upon Kennedy, a\nmember of the late Government, at Kennedy's hotel. And the paragraph\nmust be true. He himself had warned Finn that there would be danger\nin the visit. He had even prophesied murder,--and murder had been\nattempted! The whole transaction had been, as it were, the very\ngoods and chattels of the People's Banner, and the paper had been\nshamefully robbed of its property. Mr. Slide hardly doubted that\nPhineas Finn had himself sent the paragraph to an adverse paper,\nwith the express view of adding to the injury inflicted upon the\nBanner. That day Mr. Slide hardly did his work effectively within his\nglass cage, so much was his mind affected, and at five o'clock, when\nhe left his office, instead of going at once home to Mrs. Slide at\nCamden Town, he took an omnibus, and went down to Westminster. He\nwould at once confront the traitor who had deceived him.\n\nIt must be acknowledged on behalf of this editor that he did in truth\nbelieve that he had been hindered from doing good. The whole practice\nof his life had taught him to be confident that the editor of a\nnewspaper must be the best possible judge,--indeed the only possible\ngood judge,--whether any statement or story should or should not\nbe published. Not altogether without a conscience, and intensely\nconscious of such conscience as did constrain him, Mr. Quintus\nSlide imagined that no law of libel, no injunction from any\nVice-Chancellor, no outward power or pressure whatever was needed to\nkeep his energies within their proper limits. He and his newspaper\nformed together a simply beneficent institution, any interference\nwith which must of necessity be an injury to the public. Everything\ndone at the office of the People's Banner was done in the interest\nof the People,--and, even though individuals might occasionally be\nmade to suffer by the severity with which their names were handled\nin its columns, the general result was good. What are the sufferings\nof the few to the advantage of the many? If there be fault in\nhigh places, it is proper that it be exposed. If there be fraud,\nadulteries, gambling, and lasciviousness,--or even quarrels and\nindiscretions among those whose names are known, let every detail\nbe laid open to the light, so that the people may have a warning.\nThat such details will make a paper \"pay\" Mr. Slide knew also; but\nit is not only in Mr. Slide's path of life that the bias of a man's\nmind may lead him to find that virtue and profit are compatible.\nAn unprofitable newspaper cannot long continue its existence, and,\nwhile existing, cannot be widely beneficial. It is the circulation,\nthe profitable circulation,--of forty, fifty, sixty, or a hundred\nthousand copies through all the arteries and veins of the public body\nwhich is beneficent. And how can such circulation be effected unless\nthe taste of the public be consulted? Mr. Quintus Slide, as he walked\nup Westminster Hall, in search of that wicked member of Parliament,\ndid not at all doubt the goodness of his cause. He could not contest\nthe Vice-Chancellor's injunction, but he was firm in his opinion\nthat the Vice-Chancellor's injunction had inflicted an evil on the\npublic at large, and he was unhappy within himself in that the power\nand majesty and goodness of the press should still be hampered by\nignorance, prejudice, and favour for the great. He was quite sure\nthat no injunction would have been granted in favour of Mr. Joseph\nSmith and Mr. John Jones.\n\nHe went boldly up to one of the policemen who sit guarding the door\nof the lobby of our House of Commons, and asked for Mr. Finn. The\nCerberus on the left was not sure whether Mr. Finn was in the House,\nbut would send in a card if Mr. Slide would stand on one side. For\nthe next quarter of an hour Mr. Slide heard no more of his message,\nand then applied again to the Cerberus. The Cerberus shook his head,\nand again desired the applicant to stand on one side. He had done all\nthat in him lay. The other watchful Cerberus standing on the right,\nobserving that the intruder was not accommodated with any member,\nintimated to him the propriety of standing back in one of the\ncorners. Our editor turned round upon the man as though he would\nbite him;--but he did stand back, meditating an article on the\ngross want of attention to the public shown in the lobby of the\nHouse of Commons. Is it possible that any editor should endure any\ninconvenience without meditating an article? But the judicious editor\nthinks twice of such things. Our editor was still in his wrath when\nhe saw his prey come forth from the House with a card,--no doubt his\nown card. He leaped forward in spite of the policeman, in spite of\nany Cerberus, and seized Phineas by the arm. \"I want just to have a\nfew words,\" he said. He made an effort to repress his wrath, knowing\nthat the whole world would be against him should he exhibit any\nviolence of indignation on that spot; but Phineas could see it all in\nthe fire of his eye.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Phineas, retiring to the side of the lobby, with a\nconviction that the distance between him and the House was already\nsufficient.\n\n\"Can't you come down into Westminster Hall?\"\n\n\"I should only have to come up again. You can say what you've got to\nsay here.\"\n\n\"I've got a great deal to say. I never was so badly treated in my\nlife;--never.\" He could not quite repress his voice, and he saw that\na policeman looked at him. Phineas saw it also.\n\n\"Because we have hindered you from publishing an untrue and very\nslanderous letter about a lady!\"\n\n\"You promised me that you'd come to me yesterday.\"\n\n\"I think not. I think I said that you should hear from me,--and you\ndid.\"\n\n\"You call that truth,--and honesty!\"\n\n\"Certainly I do. Of course it was my first duty to stop the\npublication of the letter.\"\n\n\"You haven't done that yet.\"\n\n\"I've done my best to stop it. If you have nothing more to say I'll\nwish you good evening.\"\n\n\"I've a deal more to say. You were shot at, weren't you?\"\n\n\"I have no desire to make any communication to you on anything that\nhas occurred, Mr. Slide. If I stayed with you all the afternoon I\ncould tell you nothing more. Good evening.\"\n\n\"I'll crush you,\" said Quintus Slide, in a stage whisper; \"I will, as\nsure as my name is Slide.\"\n\nPhineas looked at him and retired into the House, whither Quintus\nSlide could not follow him, and the editor of the People's Banner\nwas left alone in his anger.\n\n\"How a cock can crow on his own dunghill!\" That was Mr. Slide's\nfirst feeling, as with a painful sense of diminished consequence\nhe retraced his steps through the outer lobbies and down into\nWestminster Hall. He had been browbeaten by Phineas Finn, simply\nbecause Phineas had been able to retreat within those happy doors. He\nknew that to the eyes of all the policemen and strangers assembled\nPhineas Finn had been a hero, a Parliamentary hero, and he had\nbeen some poor outsider,--to be ejected at once should he make\nhimself disagreeable to the Members. Nevertheless, had he not all the\ncolumns of the People's Banner in his pocket? Was he not great in\nthe Fourth Estate,--much greater than Phineas Finn in his estate?\nCould he not thunder every night so that an audience to be counted\nby hundreds of thousands should hear his thunder;--whereas this\npoor Member of Parliament must struggle night after night for an\nopportunity of speaking; and could then only speak to benches half\ndeserted; or to a few Members half asleep,--unless the Press should\nchoose to convert his words into thunderbolts. Who could doubt for\na moment with which lay the greater power? And yet this wretched\nIrishman, who had wriggled himself into Parliament on a petition,\ngetting the better of a good, downright English John Bull by a\nquibble, had treated him with scorn,--the wretched Irishman being for\nthe moment like a cock on his own dunghill. Quintus Slide was not\nslow to tell himself that he also had an elevation of his own, from\nwhich he could make himself audible. In former days he had forgiven\nPhineas Finn more than once. If he ever forgave Phineas Finn again\nmight his right hand forget its cunning, and never again draw blood\nor tear a scalp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nTHE FIRST THUNDERBOLT.\n\n\nIt was not till after Mr. Slide had left him that Phineas wrote the\nfollowing letter to Lady Laura:--\n\n\n   House of Commons, 1st March, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR FRIEND,\n\n   I have a long story to tell, which I fear I shall find\n   difficult in the telling; but it is so necessary that you\n   should know the facts that I must go through with it as\n   best I may. It will give you very great pain; but the\n   result as regards your own position will not I think be\n   injurious to you.\n\n   Yesterday, Sunday, a man came to me who edits a newspaper,\n   and whom I once knew. You will remember when I used to\n   tell you in Portman Square of the amenities and angers of\n   Mr. Slide,--the man who wanted to sit for Loughton. He is\n   the editor. He brought me a long letter from Mr. Kennedy\n   himself, intended for publication, and which was already\n   printed, giving an elaborate and, I may say, a most\n   cruelly untrue account of your quarrel. I read the letter,\n   but of course cannot remember the words. Nor if I could\n   remember them should I repeat them. They contained all the\n   old charges with which you are familiar, and which your\n   unfortunate husband now desired to publish in consummation\n   of his threats. Why Mr. Slide should have brought me the\n   paper before publishing it I can hardly understand. But he\n   did so;--and told me that Mr. Kennedy was in town. We have\n   managed among us to obtain a legal warrant for preventing\n   the publication of the letter, and I think I may say that\n   it will not see the light.\n\n   When Mr. Slide left me I called on Mr. Kennedy, whom I\n   found in a miserable little hotel, in Judd Street, kept\n   by Scotch people named Macpherson. They had come from the\n   neighbourhood of Loughlinter, and knew Mr. Kennedy well.\n   This was yesterday afternoon, Sunday, and I found some\n   difficulty in making my way into his presence. My object\n   was to induce him to withdraw the letter;--for at that\n   time I doubted whether the law could interfere quickly\n   enough to prevent the publication.\n\n   I found your husband in a very sad condition. What he said\n   or what I said I forget; but he was as usual intensely\n   anxious that you should return to him. I need not hesitate\n   now to say that he is certainly mad. After a while, when I\n   expressed my assured opinion that you would not go back to\n   Loughlinter, he suddenly turned round, grasped a revolver,\n   and fired at my head. How I got out of the room I don't\n   quite remember. Had he repeated the shot, which he might\n   have done over and over again, he must have hit me. As\n   it was I escaped, and blundered down the stairs to Mrs.\n   Macpherson's room.\n\n   They whom I have consulted in the matter, namely,\n   Barrington Erle and my particular friend, Mr. Low,--to\n   whom I went for legal assistance in stopping the\n   publication,--seem to think that I should have at once\n   sent for the police, and given Mr. Kennedy in charge. But\n   I did not do so, and hitherto the police have, I believe,\n   no knowledge of what occurred. A paragraph appeared in one\n   of the morning papers to-day, giving almost an accurate\n   account of the matter, but mentioning neither the place\n   nor any of the names. No doubt it will be repeated in\n   all the papers, and the names will soon be known. But\n   the result will be simply a general conviction as to the\n   insanity of poor Mr. Kennedy,--as to which they who know\n   him have had for a long time but little doubt.\n\n   The Macphersons seem to have been very anxious to screen\n   their guest. At any other hotel no doubt the landlord\n   would have sent for the police;--but in this case the\n   attempt was kept quite secret. They did send for George\n   Kennedy, a cousin of your husband's, whom I think you\n   know, and whom I saw this morning. He assures me that\n   Robert Kennedy is quite aware of the wickedness of the\n   attempt he made, and that he is plunged in deep remorse.\n   He is to be taken down to Loughlinter to-morrow, and\n   is,--so says his cousin,--as tractable as a child. What\n   George Kennedy means to do, I cannot say; but for myself,\n   as I did not send for the police at the moment, as I am\n   told I ought to have done, I shall now do nothing. I don't\n   know that a man is subject to punishment because he does\n   not make complaint. I suppose I have a right to regard it\n   all as an accident if I please.\n\n   But for you this must be very important. That Mr. Kennedy\n   is insane there cannot now, I think, be a doubt; and\n   therefore the question of your returning to him,--as far\n   as there has been any question,--is absolutely settled.\n   None of your friends would be justified in allowing you to\n   return. He is undoubtedly mad, and has done an act which\n   is not murderous only on that conclusion. This settles the\n   question so perfectly that you could, no doubt, reside in\n   England now without danger. Mr. Kennedy himself would feel\n   that he could take no steps to enforce your return after\n   what he did yesterday. Indeed, if you could bring yourself\n   to face the publicity, you could, I imagine, obtain a\n   legal separation which would give you again the control of\n   your own fortune. I feel myself bound to mention this; but\n   I give you no advice. You will no doubt explain all the\n   circumstances to your father.\n\n   I think I have now told you everything that I need tell\n   you. The thing only happened yesterday, and I have been\n   all the morning busy, getting the injunction, and seeing\n   Mr. George Kennedy. Just before I began this letter that\n   horrible editor was with me again, threatening me with\n   all the penalties which an editor can inflict. To tell\n   the truth, I do feel confused among them all, and still\n   fancy that I hear the click of the pistol. That newspaper\n   paragraph says that the ball went through my whiskers,\n   which was certainly not the case;--but a foot or two off\n   is quite near enough for a pistol ball.\n\n   The Duke of Omnium is dying, and I have heard to-day that\n   Madame Goesler, our old friend, has been sent for to\n   Matching. She and I renewed our acquaintance the other day\n   at Harrington.\n\n   God bless you.\n\n   Your most sincere friend,\n\n   PHINEAS FINN.\n\n   Do not let my news oppress you. The firing of the pistol\n   is a thing done and over without evil results. The state\n   of Mr. Kennedy's mind is what we have long suspected; and,\n   melancholy though it be, should contain for you at any\n   rate this consolation,--that the accusations made against\n   you would not have been made had his mind been unclouded.\n\n\nTwice while Finn was writing this letter was he rung into the House\nfor a division, and once it was suggested to him to say a few words\nof angry opposition to the Government on some not important subject\nunder discussion. Since the beginning of the Session hardly a night\nhad passed without some verbal sparring, and very frequently the\nlimits of parliamentary decorum had been almost surpassed. Never\nwithin the memory of living politicians had political rancour been so\nsharp, and the feeling of injury so keen, both on the one side and on\nthe other. The taunts thrown at the Conservatives, in reference to\nthe Church, had been almost unendurable,--and the more so because the\nstrong expressions of feeling from their own party throughout the\ncountry were against them. Their own convictions also were against\nthem. And there had for a while been almost a determination through\nthe party to deny their leader and disclaim the bill. But a feeling\nof duty to the party had prevailed, and this had not been done. It\nhad not been done; but the not doing of it was a sore burden on the\nhalf-broken shoulders of many a man who sat gloomily on the benches\nbehind Mr. Daubeny. Men goaded as they were, by their opponents,\nby their natural friends, and by their own consciences, could not\nbear it in silence, and very bitter things were said in return. Mr.\nGresham was accused of a degrading lust for power. No other feeling\ncould prompt him to oppose with a factious acrimony never before\nexhibited in that House,--so said some wretched Conservative with\nbroken back and broken heart,--a measure which he himself would only\nbe too willing to carry were he allowed the privilege of passing over\nto the other side of the House for the purpose. In these encounters,\nPhineas Finn had already exhibited his prowess, and, in spite of his\ndeclarations at Tankerville, had become prominent as an opponent to\nMr. Daubeny's bill. He had, of course, himself been taunted, and held\nup in the House to the execration of his own constituents; but he had\nenjoyed his fight, and had remembered how his friend Mr. Monk had\nonce told him that the pleasure lay all on the side of opposition.\nBut on this evening he declined to speak. \"I suppose you have hardly\nrecovered from Kennedy's pistol,\" said Mr. Ratler, who had, of\ncourse, heard the whole story. \"That, and the whole affair together\nhave upset me,\" said Phineas. \"Fitzgibbon will do it for you; he's in\nthe House.\" And so it happened that on that occasion the Honourable\nLaurence Fitzgibbon made a very effective speech against the\nGovernment.\n\nOn the next morning from the columns of the People's Banner was\nhurled the first of those thunderbolts with which it was the purpose\nof Mr. Slide absolutely to destroy the political and social life of\nPhineas Finn. He would not miss his aim as Mr. Kennedy had done. He\nwould strike such blows that no constituency should ever venture to\nreturn Mr. Finn again to Parliament; and he thought that he could\nalso so strike his blows that no mighty nobleman, no distinguished\ncommoner, no lady of rank should again care to entertain the\nmiscreant and feed him with the dainties of fashion. The first\nthunderbolt was as follows:--\n\n\n   We abstained yesterday from alluding to a circumstance\n   which occurred at a small hotel in Judd Street on Sunday\n   afternoon, and which, as we observe, was mentioned by one\n   of our contemporaries. The names, however, were not given,\n   although the persons implicated were indicated. We can\n   see no reason why the names should be concealed. Indeed,\n   as both the gentlemen concerned have been guilty of very\n   great criminality, we think that we are bound to tell the\n   whole story,--and this the more especially as certain\n   circumstances have in a very peculiar manner placed us in\n   possession of the facts.\n\n   It is no secret that for the last two years Lady\n   Laura Kennedy has been separated from her husband,\n   the Honourable Robert Kennedy, who, in the last\n   administration, under Mr. Mildmay, held the office of\n   Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and we believe as\n   little a secret that Mr. Kennedy has been very persistent\n   in endeavouring to recall his wife to her home. With equal\n   persistence she has refused to obey, and we have in our\n   hands the clearest possible evidence that Mr. Kennedy has\n   attributed her obstinate refusal to influence exercised\n   over her by Mr. Phineas Finn, who three years since was\n   her father's nominee for the then existing borough of\n   Loughton, and who lately succeeded in ousting poor Mr.\n   Browborough from his seat for Tankerville by his impetuous\n   promises to support that very measure of Church Reform\n   which he is now opposing with that venom which makes him\n   valuable to his party. Whether Mr. Phineas Finn will ever\n   sit in another Parliament we cannot, of course, say, but\n   we think we can at least assure him that he will never\n   again sit for Tankerville.\n\n   On last Sunday afternoon Mr. Finn, knowing well the\n   feeling with which he is regarded by Mr. Kennedy, outraged\n   all decency by calling upon that gentleman, whose address\n   he obtained from our office. What took place between them\n   no one knows, and, probably, no one ever will know. But\n   the interview was ended by Mr. Kennedy firing a pistol\n   at Mr. Finn's head. That he should have done so without\n   the grossest provocation no one will believe. That Mr.\n   Finn had gone to the husband to interfere with him\n   respecting his wife is an undoubted fact,--a fact which,\n   if necessary, we are in a position to prove. That such\n   interference must have been most heartrending every one\n   will admit. This intruder, who had thrust himself upon the\n   unfortunate husband on the Sabbath afternoon, was the very\n   man whom the husband accuses of having robbed him of the\n   company and comfort of his wife. But we cannot, on that\n   account, absolve Mr. Kennedy of the criminality of his\n   act. It should be for a jury to decide what view should\n   be taken of that act, and to say how far the outrageous\n   provocation offered should be allowed to palliate the\n   offence. But hitherto the matter has not reached the\n   police. Mr. Finn was not struck, and managed to escape\n   from the room. It was his manifest duty as one of\n   the community, and more especially so as a member of\n   Parliament, to have reported all the circumstances at\n   once to the police. This was not done by him, nor by the\n   persons who keep the hotel. That Mr. Finn should have\n   reasons of his own for keeping the whole affair secret,\n   and for screening the attempt at murder, is clear enough.\n   What inducements have been used with the people of the\n   house we cannot, of course, say. But we understand that\n   Mr. Kennedy has been allowed to leave London without\n   molestation.\n\n   Such is the true story of what occurred on Sunday\n   afternoon in Judd Street, and, knowing what we do, we\n   think ourselves justified in calling upon Major Mackintosh\n   to take the case into his own hands.\n\n\nNow Major Mackintosh was at this time the head of the London\nconstabulary.\n\n\n   It is quite out of the question that such a transaction\n   should take place in the heart of London at three o'clock\n   on a Sunday afternoon, and be allowed to pass without\n   notice. We intend to keep as little of what we know\n   from the public as possible, and do not hesitate to\n   acknowledge that we are debarred by an injunction of\n   the Vice-Chancellor from publishing a certain document\n   which would throw the clearest light upon the whole\n   circumstance. As soon as possible after the shot was\n   fired Mr. Finn went to work, and, as we think, by\n   misrepresentations, obtained the injunction early on\n   yesterday morning. We feel sure that it would not have\n   been granted had the transaction in Judd Street been at\n   the time known to the Vice-Chancellor in all its enormity.\n   Our hands are, of course, tied. The document in question\n   is still with us, but it is sacred. When called upon to\n   show it by any proper authority we shall be ready; but,\n   knowing what we do know, we should not be justified in\n   allowing the matter to sleep. In the meantime we call upon\n   those whose duty it is to preserve the public peace to\n   take the steps necessary for bringing the delinquents to\n   justice.\n\n   The effect upon Mr. Finn, we should say, must be his\n   immediate withdrawal from public life. For the last year\n   or two he has held some subordinate but permanent place\n   in Ireland, which he has given up on the rumour that the\n   party to which he has attached himself is likely to return\n   to office. That he is a seeker after office is notorious.\n   That any possible Government should now employ him, even\n   as a tide-waiter, is quite out of the question; and it\n   is equally out of the question that he should be again\n   returned to Parliament, were he to resign his seat on\n   accepting office. As it is, we believe, notorious that\n   this gentleman cannot maintain the position which he holds\n   without being paid for his services, it is reasonable to\n   suppose that his friends will recommend him to retire, and\n   seek his living in some obscure, and, let us hope, honest\n   profession.\n\n\nMr. Slide, when his thunderbolt was prepared, read it over with\ndelight, but still with some fear as to probable results. It was\nexpedient that he should avoid a prosecution for libel, and essential\nthat he should not offend the majesty of the Vice-Chancellor's\ninjunction. Was he sure that he was safe in each direction? As to\nthe libel, he could not tell himself that he was certainly safe. He\nwas saying very hard things both of Lady Laura and of Phineas Finn,\nand sailing very near the wind. But neither of those persons would\nprobably be willing to prosecute; and, should he be prosecuted, he\nwould then, at any rate, be able to give in Mr. Kennedy's letter as\nevidence in his own defence. He really did believe that what he was\ndoing was all done in the cause of morality. It was the business of\nsuch a paper as that which he conducted to run some risk in defending\nmorals, and exposing distinguished culprits on behalf of the\npublic. And then, without some such risk, how could Phineas Finn be\nadequately punished for the atrocious treachery of which he had been\nguilty? As to the Chancellor's order, Mr. Slide thought that he had\nmanaged that matter very completely. No doubt he had acted in direct\nopposition to the spirit of the injunction, but legal orders are read\nby the letter, and not by the spirit. It was open to him to publish\nanything he pleased respecting Mr. Kennedy and his wife, subject,\nof course, to the general laws of the land in regard to libel.\nThe Vice-Chancellor's special order to him referred simply to a\nparticular document, and from that document he had not quoted a word,\nthough he had contrived to repeat all the bitter things which it\ncontained, with much added venom of his own. He felt secure of being\nsafe from any active anger on the part of the Vice-Chancellor.\n\nThe article was printed and published. The reader will perceive that\nit was full of lies. It began with a lie in that statement that \"we\nabstained yesterday from alluding to circumstances\" which had been\nunknown to the writer when his yesterday's paper was published.\nThe indignant reference to poor Finn's want of delicacy in forcing\nhimself upon Mr. Kennedy on the Sabbath afternoon, was, of course,\na tissue of lies. The visit had been made almost at the instigation\nof the editor himself. The paper from beginning to end was full of\nfalsehood and malice, and had been written with the express intention\nof creating prejudice against the man who had offended the writer.\nBut Mr. Slide did not know that he was lying, and did not know that\nhe was malicious. The weapon which he used was one to which his hand\nwas accustomed, and he had been led by practice to believe that the\nuse of such weapons by one in his position was not only fair, but\nalso beneficial to the public. Had anybody suggested to him that he\nwas stabbing his enemy in the dark, he would have averred that he\nwas doing nothing of the kind, because the anonymous accusation of\nsinners in high rank was, on behalf of the public, the special duty\nof writers and editors attached to the public press. Mr. Slide's\nblood was running high with virtuous indignation against our hero as\nhe inserted those last cruel words as to the choice of an obscure but\nhonest profession.\n\nPhineas Finn read the article before he sat down to breakfast on the\nfollowing morning, and the dagger went right into his bosom. Every\nword told upon him. With a jaunty laugh within his own sleeve he had\nassured himself that he was safe against any wound which could be\ninflicted on him from the columns of the People's Banner. He had\nbeen sure that he would be attacked, and thought that he was armed\nto bear it. But the thin blade penetrated every joint of his harness,\nand every particle of the poison curdled in his blood. He was hurt\nabout Lady Laura; he was hurt about his borough of Tankerville; he\nwas hurt by the charges against him of having outraged delicacy;\nhe was hurt by being handed over to the tender mercies of Major\nMackintosh; he was hurt by the craft with which the Vice-Chancellor's\ninjunction had been evaded; but he was especially hurt by the\nallusions to his own poverty. It was necessary that he should earn\nhis bread, and no doubt he was a seeker after place. But he did not\nwish to obtain wages without working for them; and he did not see why\nthe work and wages of a public office should be less honourable than\nthose of any other profession. To him, with his ideas, there was no\nprofession so honourable, as certainly there were none which demanded\ngreater sacrifices or were more precarious. And he did believe that\nsuch an article as that would have the effect of shutting against\nhim the gates of that dangerous Paradise which he desired to enter.\nHe had no great claim upon his party; and, in giving away the good\nthings of office, the giver is only too prone to recognise any\nobjections against an individual which may seem to relieve him from\nthe necessity of bestowing aught in that direction. Phineas felt that\nhe would almost be ashamed to show his face at the clubs or in the\nHouse. He must do so as a matter of course, but he knew that he could\nnot do so without confessing by his visage that he had been deeply\nwounded by the attack in the People's Banner.\n\nHe went in the first instance to Mr. Low, and was almost surprised\nthat Mr. Low should not have yet even have heard that such an attack\nhad been made. He had almost felt, as he walked to Lincoln's Inn,\nthat everybody had looked at him, and that passers-by in the street\nhad declared to each other that he was the unfortunate one who\nhad been doomed by the editor of the People's Banner to seek some\nobscure way of earning his bread. Mr. Low took the paper, read, or\nprobably only half read, the article, and then threw the sheet aside\nas worthless. \"What ought I to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"One's first desire would be to beat him to a jelly.\"\n\n\"Of all courses that would be the worst, and would most certainly\nconduce to his triumph.\"\n\n\"Just so;--I only allude to the pleasure one would have, but which\none has to deny oneself. I don't know whether he has laid himself\nopen for libel.\"\n\n\"I should think not. I have only just glanced at it, and therefore\ncan't give an opinion; but I should think you would not dream of such\na thing. Your object is to screen Lady Laura's name.\"\n\n\"I have to think of that first.\"\n\n\"It may be necessary that steps should be taken to defend her\ncharacter. If an accusation be made with such publicity as to enforce\nbelief if not denied, the denial must be made, and may probably be\nbest made by an action for libel. But that must be done by her or her\nfriends,--but certainly not by you.\"\n\n\"He has laughed at the Vice-Chancellor's injunction.\"\n\n\"I don't think that you can interfere. If, as you believe, Mr.\nKennedy be insane, that fact will probably soon be proved, and will\nhave the effect of clearing Lady Laura's character. A wife may be\nexcused for leaving a mad husband.\"\n\n\"And you think I should do nothing?\"\n\n\"I don't see what you can do. You have encountered a chimney sweeper,\nand of course you get some of the soot. What you do do, and what\nyou do not do, must depend at any rate on the wishes of Lady Laura\nKennedy and her father. It is a matter in which you must make\nyourself subordinate to them.\"\n\nFuming and fretting, and yet recognising the truth of Mr. Low's\nwords, Phineas left the chambers, and went down to his club. It was\na Wednesday, and the House was to sit in the morning; but before\nhe went to the House he put himself in the way of certain of his\nassociates in order that he might hear what would be said, and learn\nif possible what was thought. Nobody seemed to treat the accusations\nin the newspaper as very serious, though all around him congratulated\nhim on his escape from Mr. Kennedy's pistol. \"I suppose the poor man\nreally is mad,\" said Lord Cantrip, whom he met on the steps of one of\nthe clubs.\n\n\"No doubt, I should say.\"\n\n\"I can't understand why you didn't go to the police.\"\n\n\"I had hoped the thing would not become public,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Everything becomes public;--everything of that kind. It is very hard\nupon poor Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"That is the worst of it, Lord Cantrip.\"\n\n\"If I were her father I should bring her to England, and demand a\nseparation in a regular and legal way. That is what he should do now\nin her behalf. She would then have an opportunity of clearing her\ncharacter from imputations which, to a certain extent, will affect\nit, even though they come from a madman, and from the very scum of\nthe press.\"\n\n\"You have read that article?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I saw it but a minute ago.\"\n\n\"I need not tell you that there is not the faintest ground in the\nworld for the imputation made against Lady Laura there.\"\n\n\"I am sure that there is none;--and therefore it is that I tell you\nmy opinion so plainly. I think that Lord Brentford should be advised\nto bring Lady Laura to England, and to put down the charges openly in\nCourt. It might be done either by an application to the Divorce Court\nfor a separation, or by an action against the newspaper for libel.\nI do not know Lord Brentford quite well enough to intrude upon him\nwith a letter, but I have no objection whatever to having my name\nmentioned to him. He and I and you and poor Mr. Kennedy sat together\nin the same Government, and I think that Lord Brentford would trust\nmy friendship so far.\" Phineas thanked him, and assured him that what\nhe had said should be conveyed to Lord Brentford.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE SPOONER CORRESPONDENCE.\n\n\nIt will be remembered that Adelaide Palliser had accepted the hand of\nMr. Maule, junior, and that she and Lady Chiltern between them had\ndespatched him up to London on an embassy to his father, in which he\nfailed very signally. It had been originally Lady Chiltern's idea\nthat the proper home for the young couple would be the ancestral\nhall, which must be theirs some day, and in which, with exceeding\nprudence, they might be able to live as Maules of Maule Abbey upon\nthe very limited income which would belong to them. How slight were\nthe grounds for imputing such stern prudence to Gerard Maule both\nthe ladies felt;--but it had become essential to do something; the\nyoung people were engaged to each other, and a manner of life must be\nsuggested, discussed, and as far as possible arranged. Lady Chiltern\nwas useful at such work, having a practical turn of mind, and\nunderstanding well the condition of life for which it was necessary\nthat her friend should prepare herself. The lover was not vicious,\nhe neither drank nor gambled, nor ran himself hopelessly in debt.\nHe was good-humoured and tractable, and docile enough when nothing\ndisagreeable was asked from him. He would have, he said, no objection\nto live at Maule Abbey if Adelaide liked it. He didn't believe much\nin farming, but would consent at Adelaide's request to be the owner\nof bullocks. He was quite ready to give up hunting, having already\ntaught himself to think that the very few good runs in a season\nwere hardly worth the trouble of getting up before daylight all the\nwinter. He went forth, therefore, on his embassy, and we know how he\nfailed. Another lover would have communicated the disastrous tidings\nat once to the lady; but Gerard Maule waited a week before he did so,\nand then told his story in half-a-dozen words. \"The governor cut up\nrough about Maule Abbey, and will not hear of it. He generally does\ncut up rough.\"\n\n\"But he must be made to hear of it,\" said Lady Chiltern. Two days\nafterwards the news reached Harrington of the death of the Duke of\nOmnium. A letter of an official nature reached Adelaide from Mr.\nFothergill, in which the writer explained that he had been desired by\nMr. Palliser to communicate to her and the relatives the sad tidings.\n\"So the poor old man has gone at last,\" said Lady Chiltern, with that\naffectation of funereal gravity which is common to all of us.\n\n\"Poor old Duke!\" said Adelaide. \"I have been hearing of him as a sort\nof bugbear all my life. I don't think I ever saw him but once, and\nthen he gave me a kiss and a pair of earrings. He never paid any\nattention to us at all, but we were taught to think that Providence\nhad been very good to us in making the Duke our uncle.\"\n\n\"He was very rich?\"\n\n\"Horribly rich, I have always heard.\"\n\n\"Won't he leave you something? It would be very nice now that you are\nengaged to find that he has given you five thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Very nice indeed;--but there is not a chance of it. It has always\nbeen known that everything is to go to the heir. Papa had his fortune\nand spent it. He and his brother were never friends, and though the\nDuke did once give me a kiss I imagine that he forgot my existence\nimmediately afterwards.\"\n\n\"So the Duke of Omnium is dead,\" said Lord Chiltern when he came home\nthat evening.\n\n\"Adelaide has had a letter to tell her so this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fothergill wrote to me,\" said Adelaide;--\"the man who is so\nwicked about the foxes.\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw about Mr. Fothergill; and now my mouth is\nclosed against your uncle. But it's quite frightful to think that a\nDuke of Omnium must die like anybody else.\"\n\n\"The Duke is dead;--long live the Duke,\" said Lady Chiltern. \"I\nwonder how Mr. Palliser will like it.\"\n\n\"Men always do like it, I suppose,\" said Adelaide.\n\n\"Women do,\" said Lord Chiltern. \"Lady Glencora will be delighted to\nreign,--though I can hardly fancy her by any other name. By the bye,\nAdelaide, I have got a letter for you.\"\n\n\"A letter for me, Lord Chiltern!\"\n\n\"Well,--yes; I suppose I had better give it you. It is not addressed\nto you, but you must answer it.\"\n\n\"What on earth is it?\"\n\n\"I think I can guess,\" said Lady Chiltern, laughing. She had guessed\nrightly, but Adelaide Palliser was still altogether in the dark when\nLord Chiltern took a letter from his pocket and handed it to her. As\nhe did so he left the room, and his wife followed him. \"I shall be\nupstairs, Adelaide, if you want advice,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\nThe letter was from Mr. Spooner. He had left Harrington Hall after\nthe uncourteous reception which had been accorded to him by Miss\nPalliser in deep disgust, resolving that he would never again speak\nto her, and almost resolving that Spoon Hall should never have a\nmistress in his time. But with his wine after dinner his courage\ncame back to him, and he began to reflect once more that it is not\nthe habit of young ladies to accept their lovers at the first offer.\nThere was living with Mr. Spooner at this time a very attached\nfriend, whom he usually consulted in all emergencies, and to whom\non this occasion he opened his heart. Mr. Edward Spooner, commonly\ncalled Ned by all who knew him, and not unfrequently so addressed\nby those who did not, was a distant cousin of the Squire's, who\nunfortunately had no particular income of his own. For the last ten\nyears he had lived at Spoon Hall, and had certainly earned his bread.\nThe Squire had achieved a certain credit for success as a country\ngentleman. Nothing about his place was out of order. His own farming,\nwhich was extensive, succeeded. His bullocks and sheep won prizes.\nHis horses were always useful and healthy. His tenants were solvent,\nif not satisfied, and he himself did not owe a shilling. Now many\npeople in the neighbourhood attributed all this to the judicious\ncare of Mr. Edward Spooner, whose eye was never off the place, and\nwhose discretion was equal to his zeal. In giving the Squire his due,\none must acknowledge that he recognised the merits of his cousin,\nand trusted him in everything. That night, as soon as the customary\nbottle of claret had succeeded the absolutely normal bottle of port\nafter dinner, Mr. Spooner of Spoon Hall opened his heart to his\ncousin.\n\n\"I shall have to walk, then,\" said Ned.\n\n\"Not if I know it,\" said the Squire. \"You don't suppose I'm going to\nlet any woman have the command of Spoon Hall?\"\n\n\"They do command,--inside, you know.\"\n\n\"No woman shall ever turn you out of this house, Ned.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of myself, Tom,\" said the cousin. \"Of course you'll\nmarry some day, and of course I must take my chance. I don't see why\nit shouldn't be Miss Palliser as well as another.\"\n\n\"The jade almost made me angry.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's the way with most of 'em. 'Ludit exultim metuitque\ntangi'.\" For Ned Spooner had himself preserved some few tattered\nshreds of learning from his school days. \"You don't remember about\nthe filly?\"\n\n\"Yes I do; very well,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"'Nuptiarum expers.' That's what it is, I suppose. Try it again.\"\nThe advice on the part of the cousin was genuine and unselfish. That\nMr. Spooner of Spoon Hall should be rejected by a young lady without\nany fortune seemed to him to be impossible. At any rate it is the\nduty of a man in such circumstances to persevere. As far as Ned knew\nthe world, ladies always required to be asked a second or a third\ntime. And then no harm can come from such perseverance. \"She can't\nbreak your bones, Tom.\"\n\nThere was much honesty displayed on this occasion. The Squire, when\nhe was thus instigated to persevere, did his best to describe the\nmanner in which he had been rejected. His powers of description were\nnot very great, but he did not conceal anything wilfully. \"She was as\nhard as nails, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know that that means much. Horace's filly kicked a few, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"She told me that if I'd go one way, she'd go the other!\"\n\n\"They always say about the hardest things that come to their tongues.\nThey don't curse and swear as we do, or there'd be no bearing them.\nIf you really like her--\"\n\n\"She's such a well-built creature! There's a look of blood about her\nI don't see in any of 'em. That sort of breeding is what one wants to\nget through the mud with.\"\n\nThen it was that the cousin recommended a letter to Lord Chiltern.\nLord Chiltern was at the present moment to be regarded as the lady's\nguardian, and was the lover's intimate friend. A direct proposal\nhad already been made to the young lady, and this should now be\nrepeated to the gentleman who for the time stood in the position of\nher father. The Squire for a while hesitated, declaring that he was\naverse to make his secret known to Lord Chiltern. \"One doesn't want\nevery fellow in the country to know it,\" he said. But in answer to\nthis the cousin was very explicit. There could be but little doubt\nthat Lord Chiltern knew the secret already; and he would certainly\nbe rather induced to keep it as a secret than to divulge it if it\nwere communicated to him officially. And what other step could the\nSquire take? It would not be likely that he should be asked again to\nHarrington Hall with the express view of repeating his offer. The\ncousin was quite of opinion that a written proposition should be\nmade; and on that very night the cousin himself wrote out a letter\nfor the Squire to copy in the morning. On the morning the Squire\ncopied the letter,--not without additions of his own, as to which he\nhad very many words with his discreet cousin,--and in a formal manner\nhanded it to Lord Chiltern towards the afternoon of that day, having\ndevoted his whole morning to the finding of a proper opportunity\nfor doing so. Lord Chiltern had read the letter, and had, as we see,\ndelivered it to Adelaide Palliser. \"That's another proposal from Mr.\nSpooner,\" Lady Chiltern said, as soon as they were alone.\n\n\"Exactly that.\"\n\n\"I knew he'd go on with it. Men are such fools.\"\n\n\"I don't see that he's a fool at all;\" said Lord Chiltern, almost in\nanger. \"Why shouldn't he ask a girl to be his wife? He's a rich man,\nand she hasn't got a farthing.\"\n\n\"You might say the same of a butcher, Oswald.\"\n\n\"Mr. Spooner is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say that he's fit to marry such a girl as\nAdelaide Palliser?\"\n\n\"I don't know what makes fitness. He's got a red nose, and if she\ndon't like a red nose,--that's unfitness. Gerard Maule's nose isn't\nred, and I dare say therefore he's fitter. Only, unfortunately, he\nhas no money.\"\n\n\"Adelaide Palliser would no more think of marrying Mr. Spooner than\nyou would have thought of marrying the cook.\"\n\n\"If I had liked the cook I should have asked her, and I don't see why\nMr. Spooner shouldn't ask Miss Palliser. She needn't take him.\"\n\nIn the meantime Miss Palliser was reading the following letter:--\n\n\n   Spoon Hall, 11th March, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR LORD CHILTERN,--\n\n   I venture to suppose that at present you are acting as\n   the guardian of Miss Palliser, who has been staying at\n   your house all the winter. If I am wrong in this I hope\n   you will pardon me, and consent to act in that capacity\n   for this occasion. I entertain feelings of the greatest\n   admiration and warmest affection for the young lady I have\n   named, which I ventured to express when I had the pleasure\n   of staying at Harrington Hall in the early part of last\n   month. I cannot boast that I was received on that occasion\n   with much favour; but I know that I am not very good at\n   talking, and we are told in all the books that no man has\n   a right to expect to be taken at the first time of asking.\n   Perhaps Miss Palliser will allow me, through you, to\n   request her to consider my proposal with more deliberation\n   than was allowed to me before, when I spoke to her perhaps\n   with injudicious hurry.\n\n\nSo far the Squire adopted his cousin's words without alteration.\n\n\n   I am the owner of my own property,--which is more than\n   everybody can say. My income is nearly \u00c2\u00a34,000 a year. I\n   shall be willing to make any proper settlement that may\n   be recommended by the lawyers,--though I am strongly of\n   opinion that an estate shouldn't be crippled for the\n   sake of the widow. As to refurnishing the old house, and\n   all that, I'll do anything that Miss Palliser may please.\n   She knows my taste about hunting, and I know hers, so that\n   there need not be any difference of opinion on that score.\n\n   Miss Palliser can't suspect me of any interested motives.\n   I come forward because I think she is the most charming\n   girl I ever saw, and because I love her with all my heart.\n   I haven't got very much to say for myself, but if she'll\n   consent to be the mistress of Spoon Hall, she shall have\n   all that the heart of a woman can desire.\n\n   Pray believe me,\n   My dear Lord Chiltern,\n   Yours very sincerely,\n\n   THOMAS PLATTER SPOONER.\n\n   As I believe that Miss Palliser is fond of books, it may\n   be well to tell her that there is an uncommon good library\n   at Spoon Hall. I shall have no objection to go abroad for\n   the honeymoon for three or four months in the summer.\n\n\nThe postscript was the Squire's own, and was inserted in opposition\nto the cousin's judgment. \"She won't come for the sake of the books,\"\nsaid the cousin. But the Squire thought that the attractions should\nbe piled up. \"I wouldn't talk of the honeymoon till I'd got her to\ncome round a little,\" said the cousin. The Squire thought that the\ncousin was falsely delicate, and pleaded that all girls like to be\ntaken abroad when they're married. The second half of the body of the\nletter was very much disfigured by the Squire's petulance; so that\nthe modesty with which he commenced was almost put to the blush by\na touch of arrogance in the conclusion. That sentence in which the\nSquire declared that an estate ought not to be crippled for the sake\nof the widow was very much questioned by the cousin. \"Such a word as\n'widow' never ought to go into such a letter as this.\" But the Squire\nprotested that he would not be mealy-mouthed. \"She can bear to think\nof it, I'll go bail; and why shouldn't she hear about what she can\nthink about?\" \"Don't talk about furniture yet, Tom,\" the cousin said;\nbut the Squire was obstinate, and the cousin became hopeless. That\nword about loving her with all his heart was the cousin's own, but\nwhat followed, as to her being mistress of Spoon Hall, was altogether\nopposed to his judgment. \"She'll be proud enough of Spoon Hall if\nshe comes here,\" said the Squire. \"I'd let her come first,\" said the\ncousin.\n\nWe all know that the phraseology of the letter was of no importance\nwhatever. When it was received the lady was engaged to another\nman; and she regarded Mr. Spooner of Spoon Hall as being guilty of\nunpardonable impudence in approaching her at all.\n\n\"A red-faced vulgar old man, who looks as if he did nothing but\ndrink,\" she said to Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"He does you no harm, my dear.\"\n\n\"But he does do harm. He makes things very uncomfortable. He has no\nbusiness to think it possible. People will suppose that I gave him\nencouragement.\"\n\n\"I used to have lovers coming to me year after year,--the same\npeople,--whom I don't think I ever encouraged; but I never felt angry\nwith them.\"\n\n\"But you didn't have Mr. Spooner.\"\n\n\"Mr. Spooner didn't know me in those days, or there is no saying what\nmight have happened.\" Then Lady Chiltern argued the matter on views\ndirectly opposite to those which she had put forward when discussing\nthe matter with her husband. \"I always think that any man who is\nprivileged to sit down to table with you is privileged to ask.\nThere are disparities of course which may make the privilege\nquestionable,--disparities of age, rank, and means.\"\n\n\"And of tastes,\" said Adelaide.\n\n\"I don't know about that.--A poet doesn't want to marry a poetess,\nnor a philosopher a philosopheress. A man may make himself a fool\nby putting himself in the way of certain refusal; but I take it\nthe broad rule is that a man may fall in love with any lady who\nhabitually sits in his company.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you at all. What would be said if the curate at\nLong Royston were to propose to one of the FitzHoward girls?\"\n\n\"The Duchess would probably ask the Duke to make the young man a\nbishop out of hand, and the Duke would have to spend a morning in\nexplaining to her the changes which have come over the making of\nbishops since she was young. There is no other rule that you can\nlay down, and I think that girls should understand that they have\nto fight their battles subject to that law. It's very easy to say,\n'No.'\"\n\n\"But a man won't take 'No.'\"\n\n\"And it's lucky for us sometimes that they don't,\" said Lady\nChiltern, remembering certain passages in her early life.\n\nThe answer was written that night by Lord Chiltern after much\nconsultation. As to the nature of the answer,--that it should be a\npositive refusal,--of course there could be no doubt; but then arose\na question whether a reason should be given, or whether the refusal\nshould be simply a refusal. At last it was decided that a reason\nshould be given, and the letter ran as follows:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR MR. SPOONER,\n\n   I am commissioned to inform you that Miss Palliser is\n   engaged to be married to Mr. Gerard Maule.\n\n   Yours faithfully,\n\n   CHILTERN.\n\n\nThe young lady had consented to be thus explicit because it had been\nalready determined that no secret should be kept as to her future\nprospects.\n\n\"He is one of those poverty-stricken wheedling fellows that one meets\nabout the world every day,\" said the Squire to his cousin--\"a fellow\nthat rides horses that he can't pay for, and owes some poor devil of\na tailor for the breeches that he sits in. They eat, and drink, and\nget along heaven only knows how. But they're sure to come to smash at\nlast. Girls are such fools nowadays.\"\n\n\"I don't think there has ever been much difference in that,\" said the\ncousin.\n\n\"Because a man greases his whiskers, and colours his hair, and paints\nhis eyebrows, and wears kid gloves, by George, they'll go through\nfire and water after him. He'll never marry her.\"\n\n\"So much the better for her.\"\n\n\"But I hate such d---- impudence. What right has a man to come\nforward in that way who hasn't got a house over his head, or the\nmeans of getting one? Old Maule is so hard up that he can barely\nget a dinner at his club in London. What I wonder at is that Lady\nChiltern shouldn't know better.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nREGRETS.\n\n\nMadame Goesler remained at Matching till after the return of Mr.\nPalliser--or, as we must now call him, the Duke of Omnium--from\nGatherum Castle, and was therefore able to fight her own battle\nwith him respecting the gems and the money which had been left her.\nHe brought to her with his own hands the single ring which she had\nrequested, and placed it on her finger. \"The goldsmith will soon make\nthat all right,\" she said, when it was found to be much too large for\nthe largest finger on which she could wear a ring. \"A bit shall be\ntaken out, but I will not have it reset.\"\n\n\"You got the lawyer's letter and the inventory, Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. What surprises me is that the dear old man should never\nhave spoken of so magnificent a collection of gems.\"\n\n\"Orders have been given that they shall be packed.\"\n\n\"They may be packed or unpacked, of course, as your Grace pleases,\nbut pray do not connect me with the packing.\"\n\n\"You must be connected with it.\"\n\n\"But I wish not to be connected with it, Duke. I have written to the\nlawyer to renounce the legacy, and, if your Grace persists, I must\nemploy a lawyer of my own to renounce them after some legal form.\nPray do not let the case be sent to me, or there will be so much\ntrouble, and we shall have another great jewel robbery. I won't take\nit in, and I won't have the money, and I will have my own way. Lady\nGlen will tell you that I can be very obstinate when I please.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Lady Glen will tell you that I can be very\nobstinate when I please.\"]\n\n\nLady Glencora had told him so already. She had been quite sure that\nher friend would persist in her determination as to the legacy, and\nhad thought that her husband should simply accept Madame Goesler's\nassurances to that effect. But a man who had been Chancellor of the\nExchequer could not deal with money, or even with jewels, so lightly.\nHe assured his wife that such an arrangement was quite out of the\nquestion. He remarked that property was property, by which he meant\nto intimate that the real owner of substantial wealth could not be\nallowed to disembarrass himself of his responsibilities or strip\nhimself of his privileges by a few generous but idle words. The late\nDuke's will was a very serious thing, and it seemed to the heir that\nthis abandoning of a legacy bequeathed by the Duke was a making\nlight of the Duke's last act and deed. To refuse money in such\ncircumstances was almost like refusing rain from heaven, or warmth\nfrom the sun. It could not be done. The things were her property, and\nthough she might, of course, chuck them into the street, they would\nno less be hers. \"But I won't have them, Duke,\" said Madame Goesler;\nand the late Chancellor of the Exchequer found that no proposition\nmade by him in the House had ever been received with a firmer\nopposition. His wife told him that nothing he could say would be of\nany avail, and rather ridiculed his idea of the solemnity of wills.\n\"You can't make a person take a thing because you write it down on a\nthick bit of paper, any more than if you gave it her across a table.\nI understand it all, of course. She means to show that she didn't\nwant anything from the Duke. As she refused the name and title, she\nwon't have the money and jewels. You can't make her take them, and\nI'm quite sure you can't talk her over.\" The young Duke was not\npersuaded, but had to give the battle up,--at any rate, for the\npresent.\n\nOn the 19th of March Madame Goesler returned to London, having been\nat Matching Priory for more than three weeks. On her journey back to\nPark Lane many thoughts crowded on her mind. Had she, upon the whole,\ndone well in reference to the Duke of Omnium? The last three years of\nher life had been sacrificed to an old man with whom she had not in\ntruth possessed aught in common. She had persuaded herself that there\nhad existed a warm friendship between them;--but of what nature could\nhave been a friendship with one whom she had not known till he had\nbeen in his dotage? What words of the Duke's speaking had she ever\nheard with pleasure, except certain terms of affection which had been\nhalf mawkish and half senile? She had told Phineas Finn, while riding\nhome with him from Broughton Spinnies, that she had clung to the Duke\nbecause she loved him, but what had there been to produce such love?\nThe Duke had begun his acquaintance with her by insulting her,--and\nhad then offered to make her his wife. This,--which would have\nconferred upon her some tangible advantages, such as rank, and\nwealth, and a great name,--she had refused, thinking that the price\nto be paid for them was too high, and that life might even yet have\nsomething better in store for her. After that she had permitted\nherself to become, after a fashion, head nurse to the old man, and\nin that pursuit had wasted three years of what remained to her of\nher youth. People, at any rate, should not say of her that she had\naccepted payment for the three years' service by taking a casket of\njewels. She would take nothing that should justify any man in saying\nthat she had been enriched by her acquaintance with the Duke of\nOmnium. It might be that she had been foolish, but she would be more\nfoolish still were she to accept a reward for her folly. As it was\nthere had been something of romance in it,--though the romance of\nfriendship at the bedside of a sick and selfish old man had hardly\nbeen satisfactory.\n\nEven in her close connection with the present Duchess there was\nsomething which was almost hollow. Had there not been a compact\nbetween them, never expressed, but not the less understood? Had\nnot her dear friend, Lady Glen, agreed to bestow upon her support,\nfashion, and all kinds of worldly good things,--on condition that she\nnever married the old Duke? She had liked Lady Glencora,--had enjoyed\nher friend's society, and been happy in her friend's company,--but\nshe had always felt that Lady Glencora's attraction to herself had\nbeen simply on the score of the Duke. It was necessary that the Duke\nshould be pampered and kept in good humour. An old man, let him be\never so old, can do what he likes with himself and his belongings. To\nkeep the Duke out of harm's way Lady Glencora had opened her arms to\nMadame Goesler. Such, at least, was the interpretation which Madame\nGoesler chose to give to the history of the last three years. They\nhad not, she thought, quite understood her. When once she had made up\nher mind not to marry the Duke, the Duke had been safe from her;--as\nhis jewels and money should be safe now that he was dead.\n\nThree years had passed by, and nothing had been done of that which\nshe had intended to do. Three years had passed, which to her, with\nher desires, were so important. And yet she hardly knew what were her\ndesires, and had never quite defined her intentions. She told herself\non this very journey that the time had now gone by, and that in\nlosing these three years she had lost everything. As yet,--so she\ndeclared to herself now,--the world had done but little for her. Two\nold men had loved her; one had become her husband, and the other had\nasked to become so;--and to both she had done her duty. To both she\nhad been grateful, tender, and self-sacrificing. From the former she\nhad, as his widow, taken wealth which she valued greatly; but the\nwealth alone had given her no happiness. From the latter, and from\nhis family, she had accepted a certain position. Some persons, high\nin repute and fashion, had known her before, but everybody knew her\nnow. And yet what had all this done for her? Dukes and duchesses,\ndinner-parties and drawing-rooms,--what did they all amount to? What\nwas it that she wanted?\n\nShe was ashamed to tell herself that it was love. But she knew\nthis,--that it was necessary for her happiness that she should devote\nherself to some one. All the elegancies and outward charms of life\nwere delightful, if only they could be used as the means to some end.\nAs an end themselves they were nothing. She had devoted herself to\nthis old man who was now dead, and there had been moments in which\nshe had thought that that sufficed. But it had not sufficed, and\ninstead of being borne down by grief at the loss of her friend, she\nfound herself almost rejoicing at relief from a vexatious burden.\nHad she been a hypocrite then? Was it her nature to be false? After\nthat she reflected whether it might not be best for her to become\na devotee,--it did not matter much in what branch of the Christian\nreligion, so that she could assume some form of faith. The sour\nstrictness of the confident Calvinist or the asceticism of St.\nFrancis might suit her equally,--if she could only believe in Calvin\nor in St. Francis. She had tried to believe in the Duke of Omnium,\nbut there she had failed. There had been a saint at whose shrine she\nthought she could have worshipped with a constant and happy devotion,\nbut that saint had repulsed her from his altar.\n\nMr. Maule, Senior, not understanding much of all this, but still\nunderstanding something, thought that he might perhaps be the\nsaint. He knew well that audacity in asking is a great merit in a\nmiddle-aged wooer. He was a good deal older than the lady, who, in\nspite of all her experiences, was hardly yet thirty. But then he\nwas,--he felt sure,--very young for his age, whereas she was old.\nShe was a widow; he was a widower. She had a house in town and an\nincome. He had a place in the country and an estate. She knew all the\ndukes and duchesses, and he was a man of family. She could make him\ncomfortably opulent. He could make her Mrs. Maule of Maule Abbey.\nShe, no doubt, was good-looking. Mr. Maule, Senior, as he tied on\nhis cravat, thought that even in that respect there was no great\ndisparity between them. Considering his own age, Mr. Maule, Senior,\nthought there was not perhaps a better-looking man than himself about\nPall Mall. He was a little stiff in the joints and moved rather\nslowly, but what was wanting in suppleness was certainly made up in\ndignity.\n\nHe watched his opportunity, and called in Park Lane on the day after\nMadame Goesler's return. There was already between them an amount of\nacquaintance which justified his calling, and, perhaps, there had\nbeen on the lady's part something of that cordiality of manner which\nis wont to lead to intimate friendship. Mr. Maule had made himself\nagreeable, and Madame Goesler had seemed to be grateful. He was\nadmitted, and on such an occasion it was impossible not to begin the\nconversation about the \"dear Duke.\" Mr. Maule could afford to talk\nabout the Duke, and to lay aside for a short time his own cause,\nas he had not suggested to himself the possibility of becoming\npressingly tender on his own behalf on this particular occasion.\nAudacity in wooing is a great virtue, but a man must measure even his\nvirtues. \"I heard that you had gone to Matching, as soon as the poor\nDuke was taken ill,\" he said.\n\nShe was in mourning, and had never for a moment thought of denying\nthe peculiarity of the position she had held in reference to the old\nman. She could not have been content to wear her ordinary coloured\ngarments after sitting so long by the side of the dying man. A\nhired nurse may do so, but she had not been that. If there had been\nhypocrisy in her friendship the hypocrisy must be maintained to the\nend.\n\n\"Poor old man! I only came back yesterday.\"\n\n\"I never had the pleasure of knowing his Grace,\" said Mr. Maule. \"But\nI have always heard him named as a nobleman of whom England might\nwell be proud.\"\n\nMadame Goesler was not at the moment inclined to tell lies on the\nmatter, and did not think that England had much cause to be proud of\nthe Duke of Omnium. \"He was a man who held a very peculiar position,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Most peculiar;--a man of infinite wealth, and of that special\ndignity which I am sorry to say so many men of rank among us are\nthrowing aside as a garment which is too much for them. We can all\nwear coats, but it is not every one that can carry a robe. The Duke\ncarried his to the last.\" Madame Goesler remembered how he looked\nwith his nightcap on, when he had lost his temper because they would\nnot let him have a glass of cura\u00c3\u00a7oa. \"I don't know that we have any\none left that can be said to be his equal,\" continued Mr. Maule.\n\n\"No one like him, perhaps. He was never married, you know.\"\n\n\"But was once willing to marry,\" said Mr. Maule, \"if all that we\nhear be true.\" Madame Goesler, without a smile and equally without a\nfrown, looked as though the meaning of Mr. Maule's words had escaped\nher. \"A grand old gentleman! I don't know that anybody will ever say\nas much for his heir.\"\n\n\"The men are very different.\"\n\n\"Very different indeed. I dare say that Mr. Palliser, as Mr.\nPalliser, has been a useful man. But so is a coal-heaver a useful\nman. The grace and beauty of life will be clean gone when we all\nbecome useful men.\"\n\n\"I don't think we are near that yet.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Madame Goesler, I am not so sure about it. Here are\nsons of noblemen going into trade on every side of us. We have earls\ndealing in butter, and marquises sending their peaches to market.\nThere was nothing of that kind about the Duke. A great fortune had\nbeen entrusted to him, and he knew that it was his duty to spend it.\nHe did spend it, and all the world looked up to him. It must have\nbeen a great pleasure to you to know him so well.\"\n\nMadame Goesler was saved the necessity of making any answer to this\nby the announcement of another visitor. The door was opened, and\nPhineas Finn entered the room. He had not seen Madame Goesler since\nthey had been together at Harrington Hall, and had never before met\nMr. Maule. When riding home with the lady after their unsuccessful\nattempt to jump out of the wood, Phineas had promised to call in\nPark Lane whenever he should learn that Madame Goesler was not at\nMatching. Since that the Duke had died, and the bond with Matching no\nlonger existed. It seemed but the other day that they were talking\nabout the Duke together, and now the Duke was gone. \"I see you are in\nmourning,\" said Phineas, as he still held her hand. \"I must say one\nword to condole with you for your lost friend.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maule and I were now speaking of him,\" she said, as she\nintroduced the two gentlemen. \"Mr. Finn and I had the pleasure of\nmeeting your son at Harrington Hall a few weeks since, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"I heard that he had been there. Did you know the Duke, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"After the fashion in which such a one as I would know such a one as\nthe Duke, I knew him. He probably had forgotten my existence.\"\n\n\"He never forgot any one,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"I don't know that I was ever introduced to him,\" continued Mr.\nMaule, \"and I shall always regret it. I was telling Madame Goesler\nhow profound a reverence I had for the Duke's character.\" Phineas\nbowed, and Madame Goesler, who was becoming tired of the Duke as a\nsubject of conversation, asked some question as to what had been\ngoing on in the House. Mr. Maule, finding it to be improbable that he\nshould be able to advance his cause on that occasion, took his leave.\nThe moment he was gone Madame Goesler's manner changed altogether.\nShe left her former seat and came near to Phineas, sitting on a sofa\nclose to the chair he occupied; and as she did so she pushed her hair\nback from her face in a manner that he remembered well in former\ndays.\n\n\"I am so glad to see you,\" she said. \"Is it not odd that he should\nhave gone so soon after what we were saying but the other day?\"\n\n\"You thought then that he would not last long.\"\n\n\"Long is comparative. I did not think he would be dead within six\nweeks, or I should not have been riding there. He was a burden to me,\nMr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I can understand that.\"\n\n\"And yet I shall miss him sorely. He had given all the colour to my\nlife which it possessed. It was not very bright, but still it was\ncolour.\"\n\n\"The house will be open to you just the same.\"\n\n\"I shall not go there. I shall see Lady Glencora in town, of course;\nbut I shall not go to Matching; and as to Gatherum Castle, I would\nnot spend another week there, if they would give it me. You haven't\nheard of his will?\"\n\n\"No;--not a word. I hope he remembered you,--to mention your name.\nYou hardly wanted more.\"\n\n\"Just so. I wanted no more than that.\"\n\n\"It was made, perhaps, before you knew him.\"\n\n\"He was always making it, and always altering it. He left me money,\nand jewels of enormous value.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"But I have refused to take anything. Am I not right?\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should refuse.\"\n\n\"There are people who will say that--I was his mistress. If a woman\nbe young, a man's age never prevents such scandal. I don't know that\nI can stop it, but I can perhaps make it seem to be less probable.\nAnd after all that has passed, I could not bear that the Pallisers\nshould think that I clung to him for what I could get. I should be\neasier this way.\"\n\n\"Whatever is best to be done, you will do it;--I know that.\"\n\n\"Your praise goes beyond the mark, my friend. I can be both generous\nand discreet;--but the difficulty is to be true. I did take one\nthing,--a black diamond that he always wore. I would show it you, but\nthe goldsmith has it to make it fit me. When does the great affair\ncome off at the House?\"\n\n\"The bill will be read again on Monday, the first.\"\n\n\"What an unfortunate day!--You remember young Mr. Maule? Is he not\nlike his father? And yet in manners they are as unlike as possible.\"\n\n\"What is the father?\" Phineas asked.\n\n\"A battered old beau about London, selfish and civil, pleasant and\npenniless, and I should think utterly without a principle. Come again\nsoon. I am so anxious to hear that you are getting on. And you have\ngot to tell me all about that shooting with the pistol.\" Phineas as\nhe walked away thought that Madame Goesler was handsomer even than\nshe used to be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHE DUKE AND DUCHESS IN TOWN.\n\n\nAt the end of March the Duchess of Omnium, never more to be called\nLady Glencora by the world at large, came up to London. The\nDuke, though he was now banished from the House of Commons, was\nnevertheless wanted in London; and what funereal ceremonies were\nleft might be accomplished as well in town as at Matching Priory. No\nold Ministry could be turned out and no new Ministry formed without\nthe assistance of the young Duchess. It was a question whether she\nshould not be asked to be Mistress of the Robes, though those who\nasked it knew very well that she was the last woman in England to\nhamper herself by dependence on the Court. Up to London they came;\nand, though of course they went into no society, the house in Carlton\nGardens was continually thronged with people who had some special\nreason for breaking the ordinary rules of etiquette in their desire\nto see how Lady Glencora carried herself as Duchess of Omnium. \"Do\nyou think she's altered much?\" said Aspasia Fitzgibbon, an elderly\nspinster, the daughter of Lord Claddagh, and sister of Laurence\nFitzgibbon, member for one of the western Irish counties. \"I don't\nthink she was quite so loud as she used to be.\"\n\nMrs. Bonteen was of opinion that there was a change. \"She was always\nuncertain, you know, and would scratch like a cat if you offended\nher.\"\n\n\"And won't she scratch now?\" asked Miss Fitzgibbon.\n\n\"I'm afraid she'll scratch oftener. It was always a trick of hers to\npretend to think nothing of rank;--but she values her place as highly\nas any woman in England.\"\n\nThis was Mrs. Bonteen's opinion; but Lady Baldock, who was present,\ndiffered. This Lady Baldock was not the mother, but the sister-in-law\nof that Augusta Boreham who had lately become Sister Veronica John.\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Lady Baldock. \"She always seems to me to\nbe like a great schoolgirl who has been allowed too much of her own\nway. I think people give way to her too much, you know.\" As Lady\nBaldock was herself the wife of a peer, she naturally did not stand\nso much in awe of a duchess as did Mrs. Bonteen, or Miss Fitzgibbon.\n\n\"Have you seen the young Duke?\" asked Mr. Ratler of Barrington Erle.\n\n\"Yes; I have been with him this morning.\"\n\n\"How does he like it?\"\n\n\"He's bothered out of his life,--as a hen would be if you were to\nthrow her into water. He's so shy, he hardly knows how to speak to\nyou; and he broke down altogether when I said something about the\nLords.\"\n\n\"He'll not do much more.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Erle. \"He'll get used to it, and go\ninto harness again. He's a great deal too good to be lost.\"\n\n\"He didn't give himself airs?\"\n\n\"What!--Planty Pall! If I know anything of a man he's not the man to\ndo that because he's a duke. He can hold his own against all comers,\nand always could. Quiet as he always seemed, he knew who he was, and\nwho other people were. I don't think you'll find much difference in\nhim when he has got over the annoyance.\" Mr. Ratler, however, was\nof a different opinion. Mr. Ratler had known many docile members of\nthe House of Commons who had become peers by the death of uncles and\nfathers, and who had lost all respect for him as soon as they were\nreleased from the crack of the whip. Mr. Ratler rather despised peers\nwho had been members of the House of Commons, and who passed by\ninheritance from a scene of unparalleled use and influence to one of\nidle and luxurious dignity.\n\nSoon after their arrival in London the Duchess wrote the following\nvery characteristic letter:--\n\n\n   DEAR LORD CHILTERN,\n\n   Mr. Palliser-- [Then having begun with a mistake, she\n   scratched the word through with her pen.] The Duke has\n   asked me to write about Trumpeton Wood, as he knows\n   nothing about it, and I know just as little. But if\n   you say what you want, it shall be done. Shall we get\n   foxes and put them there? Or ought there to be a special\n   fox-keeper? You mustn't be angry because the poor old Duke\n   was too feeble to take notice of the matter. Only speak,\n   and it shall be done.\n\n   Yours faithfully,\n\n   GLENCORA O.\n\n   Madame Goesler spoke to me about it; but at that time we\n   were in trouble.\n\n\nThe answer was as characteristic:--\n\n\n   DEAR DUCHESS OF OMNIUM,\n\n   Thanks. What is wanted, is that keepers should know that\n   there are to be foxes. When keepers know that foxes are\n   really expected, there always are foxes. The men latterly\n   have known just the contrary. It is all a question of\n   shooting. I don't mean to say a word against the late\n   Duke. When he got old the thing became bad. No doubt it\n   will be right now.\n\n   Faithfully yours,\n\n   CHILTERN.\n\n   Our hounds have been poisoned in Trumpeton Wood. This\n   would never have been done had not the keepers been\n   against the hunting.\n\n\nUpon receipt of this she sent the letter to Mr. Fothergill, with a\nrequest that there might be no more shooting in Trumpeton Wood. \"I'll\nbe shot if we'll stand that, you know,\" said Mr. Fothergill to one of\nhis underlings. \"There are two hundred and fifty acres in Trumpeton\nWood, and we're never to kill another pheasant because Lord Chiltern\nis Master of the Brake Hounds. Property won't be worth having at that\nrate.\"\n\nThe Duke by no means intended to abandon the world of politics, or\neven the narrower sphere of ministerial work, because he had been\nousted from the House of Commons, and from the possibility of filling\nthe office which he had best liked. This was proved to the world\nby the choice of his house for a meeting of the party on the 30th\nof March. As it happened, this was the very day on which he and\nthe Duchess returned to London; but nevertheless the meeting was\nheld there, and he was present at it. Mr. Gresham then repeated his\nreasons for opposing Mr. Daubeny's bill; and declared that even while\ndoing so he would, with the approbation of his party, pledge himself\nto bring in a bill somewhat to the same effect, should he ever again\nfind himself in power. And he declared that he would do this solely\nwith the view of showing how strong was his opinion that such a\nmeasure should not be left in the hands of the Conservative party. It\nwas doubted whether such a political proposition had ever before been\nmade in England. It was a simple avowal that on this occasion men\nwere to be regarded, and not measures. No doubt such is the case, and\never has been the case, with the majority of active politicians. The\ndouble pleasure of pulling down an opponent, and of raising oneself,\nis the charm of a politician's life. And by practice this becomes\nextended to so many branches, that the delights,--and also the\ndisappointments,--are very widespread. Great satisfaction is felt\nby us because by some lucky conjunction of affairs our man, whom we\nnever saw, is made Lord-Lieutenant of a county, instead of another\nman, of whom we know as little. It is a great thing to us that Sir\nSamuel Bobwig, an excellent Liberal, is seated high on the bench of\njustice, instead of that time-serving Conservative, Sir Alexander\nMcSilk. Men and not measures are, no doubt, the very life of\npolitics. But then it is not the fashion to say so in public places.\nMr. Gresham was determined to introduce that fashion on the present\noccasion. He did not think very much of Mr. Daubeny's Bill. So\nhe told his friends at the Duke's house. The Bill was full of\nfaults,--went too far in one direction, and not far enough in\nanother. It was not difficult to pick holes in the Bill. But the\nsin of sins consisted in this,--that it was to be passed, if passed\nat all, by the aid of men who would sin against their consciences\nby each vote they gave in its favour. What but treachery could be\nexpected from an army in which every officer, and every private, was\ncalled upon to fight against his convictions? The meeting passed\noff without dissension, and it was agreed that the House of Commons\nshould be called upon to reject the Church Bill simply because it\nwas proposed from that side of the House on which the minority was\nsitting. As there were more than two hundred members present on the\noccasion, by none of whom were any objections raised, it seemed\nprobable that Mr. Gresham might be successful. There was still,\nhowever, doubt in the minds of some men. \"It's all very well,\" said\nMr. Ratler, \"but Turnbull wasn't there, you know.\"\n\nBut from what took place the next day but one in Park Lane it would\nalmost seem that the Duchess had been there. She came at once to see\nMadame Goesler, having very firmly determined that the Duke's death\nshould not have the appearance of interrupting her intimacy with her\nfriend. \"Was it not very disagreeable,\"--asked Madame Goesler,--\"just\nthe day you came to town?\"\n\n\"We didn't think of that at all. One is not allowed to think of\nanything now. It was very improper, of course, because of the Duke's\ndeath;--but that had to be put on one side. And then it was quite\ncontrary to etiquette that Peers and Commoners should be brought\ntogether. I think there was some idea of making sure of Plantagenet,\nand so they all came and wore out our carpets. There wasn't above a\ndozen peers; but they were enough to show that all the old landmarks\nhave been upset. I don't think any one would have objected if I had\nopened the meeting myself, and called upon Mrs. Bonteen to second\nme.\"\n\n\"Why Mrs. Bonteen?\"\n\n\"Because next to myself she's the most talkative and political woman\nwe have. She was at our house yesterday, and I'm not quite sure that\nshe doesn't intend to cut me out.\"\n\n\"We must put her down, Lady Glen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she'll put me down now that we're half shelved. The men did\nmake such a racket, and yet no one seemed to speak for two minutes\nexcept Mr. Gresham, who stood upon my pet footstool, and kicked it\nalmost to pieces.\"\n\n\"Was Mr. Finn there?\"\n\n\"Everybody was there, I suppose. What makes you ask particularly\nabout Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Because he's a friend.\"\n\n\"That's come up again, has it? He's the handsome Irishman, isn't he,\nthat came to Matching, the same day that brought you there?\"\n\n\"He is an Irishman, and he was at Matching, that day.\"\n\n\"He's certainly handsome. What a day that was, Marie! When one thinks\nof it all,--of all the perils and all the salvations, how strange\nit is! I wonder whether you would have liked it now if you were the\nDowager Duchess.\"\n\n\"I should have had some enjoyment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"I should have had some enjoyment, I suppose.\"]\n\n\n\"I don't know that it would have done us any harm, and yet how keen I\nwas about it. We can't give you the rank now, and you won't take the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Not the money, certainly.\"\n\n\"Plantagenet says you'll have to take it;--but it seems to me he's\nalways wrong. There are so many things that one must do that one\ndoesn't do. He never perceives that everything gets changed every\nfive years. So Mr. Finn is the favourite again?\"\n\n\"He is a friend whom I like. I may be allowed to have a friend, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"A dozen, my dear;--and all of them good-looking. Good-bye, dear.\nPray come to us. Don't stand off and make yourself disagreeable.\nWe shan't be giving dinner parties, but you can come whenever you\nplease. Tell me at once;--do you mean to be disagreeable?\"\n\nThen Madame Goesler was obliged to promise that she would not be more\ndisagreeable than her nature had made her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nTHE WORLD BECOMES COLD.\n\n\nA great deal was said by very many persons in London as to the\nmurderous attack which had been made by Mr. Kennedy on Phineas Finn\nin Judd Street, but the advice given by Mr. Slide in The People's\nBanner to the police was not taken. No public or official inquiry\nwas made into the circumstance. Mr. Kennedy, under the care of his\ncousin, retreated to Scotland; and, as it seemed, there was to be\nan end of it. Throughout the month of March various smaller bolts\nwere thrust both at Phineas and at the police by the editor of\nthe above-named newspaper, but they seemed to fall without much\neffect. No one was put in prison; nor was any one ever examined. But,\nnevertheless, these missiles had their effect. Everybody knew that\nthere had been a \"row\" between Mr. Kennedy and Phineas Finn, and that\nthe \"row\" had been made about Mr. Kennedy's wife. Everybody knew\nthat a pistol had been fired at Finn's head; and a great many people\nthought that there had been some cause for the assault. It was\nalleged at one club that the present member for Tankerville had spent\nthe greater part of the last two years at Dresden, and at another\nthat he had called on Mr. Kennedy twice, once down in Scotland,\nand once at the hotel in Judd Street, with a view of inducing that\ngentleman to concede to a divorce. There was also a very romantic\nstory afloat as to an engagement which had existed between Lady Laura\nand Phineas Finn before the lady had been induced by her father to\nmarry the richer suitor. Various details were given in corroboration\nof these stories. Was it not known that the Earl had purchased the\nsubmission of Phineas Finn by a seat for his borough of Loughton?\nWas it not known that Lord Chiltern, the brother of Lady Laura, had\nfought a duel with Phineas Finn? Was it not known that Mr. Kennedy\nhimself had been as it were coerced into quiescence by the singular\nfact that he had been saved from garotters in the street by the\nopportune interference of Phineas Finn? It was even suggested that\nthe scene with the garotters had been cunningly planned by Phineas\nFinn, that he might in this way be able to restrain the anger of\nthe husband of the lady whom he loved. All these stories were very\npretty; but as the reader, it is hoped, knows, they were all untrue.\nPhineas had made but one short visit to Dresden in his life. Lady\nLaura had been engaged to Mr. Kennedy before Phineas had ever spoken\nto her of his love. The duel with Lord Chiltern had been about\nanother lady, and the seat at Loughton had been conferred upon\nPhineas chiefly on account of his prowess in extricating Mr. Kennedy\nfrom the garotters,--respecting which circumstance it may be said\nthat as the meeting in the street was fortuitous, the reward was\ngreater than the occasion seemed to require.\n\nWhile all these things were being said Phineas became something of a\nhero. A man who is supposed to have caused a disturbance between two\nmarried people, in a certain rank of life, does generally receive a\ncertain meed of admiration. A man who was asked out to dinner twice\na week before such rumours were afloat, would probably receive double\nthat number of invitations afterwards. And then to have been shot\nat by a madman in a room, and to be the subject of the venom of a\nPeople's Banner, tends also to Fame. Other ladies besides Madame\nGoesler were anxious to have the story from the very lips of the\nhero, and in this way Phineas Finn became a conspicuous man. But\nFame begets envy, and there were some who said that the member for\nTankerville had injured his prospects with his party. It may be very\nwell to give a dinner to a man who has caused the wife of a late\nCabinet Minister to quarrel with her husband; but it can hardly be\nexpected that he should be placed in office by the head of the party\nto which that late Cabinet Minister belonged. \"I never saw such a\nfellow as you are,\" said Barrington Erle to him. \"You are always\ngetting into a mess.\"\n\n\"Nobody ought to know better than you how false all these calumnies\nare.\" This he said because Erle and Lady Laura were cousins.\n\n\"Of course they are calumnies; but you had heard them before, and\nwhat made you go poking your head into the lion's mouth?\"\n\nMr. Bonteen was very much harder upon him than was Barrington Erle.\n\"I never liked him from the first, and always knew he would not run\nstraight. No Irishman ever does.\" This was said to Viscount Fawn, a\ndistinguished member of the Liberal party, who had but lately been\nmarried, and was known to have very strict notions as to the bonds of\nmatrimony. He had been heard to say that any man who had interfered\nwith the happiness of a married couple should be held to have\ncommitted a capital offence.\n\n\"I don't know whether the story about Lady Laura is true.\"\n\n\"Of course it's true. All the world knows it to be true. He was\nalways there; at Loughlinter, and at Saulsby, and in Portman\nSquare after she had left her husband. The mischief he has done is\nincalculable. There's a Conservative sitting in poor Kennedy's seat\nfor Dunross-shire.\"\n\n\"That might have been the case anyway.\"\n\n\"Nothing could have turned Kennedy out. Don't you remember how he\nbehaved about the Irish Land Question? I hate such fellows.\"\n\n\"If I thought it true about Lady Laura--\"\n\nLord Fawn was again about to express his opinion in regard to\nmatrimony, but Mr. Bonteen was too impetuous to listen to him. \"It's\nout of the question that he should come in again. At any rate if he\ndoes, I won't. I shall tell Gresham so very plainly. The women will\ndo all that they can for him. They always do for a fellow of that\nkind.\"\n\nPhineas heard of it;--not exactly by any repetition of the words\nthat were spoken, but by chance phrases, and from the looks of men.\nLord Cantrip, who was his best friend among those who were certain\nto hold high office in a Liberal Government, did not talk to him\ncheerily,--did not speak as though he, Phineas, would as a matter\nof course have some place assigned to him. And he thought that Mr.\nGresham was hardly as cordial to him as he might be when they met\nin the closer intercourse of the House. There was always a word\nor two spoken, and sometimes a shaking of hands. He had no right\nto complain. But yet he knew that something was wanting. We can\ngenerally read a man's purpose towards us in his manner, if his\npurposes are of much moment to us.\n\nPhineas had written to Lady Laura, giving her an account of the\noccurrence in Judd Street on the 1st of March, and had received from\nher a short answer by return of post. It contained hardly more than\na thanksgiving that his life had not been sacrificed, and in a day or\ntwo she had written again, letting him know that she had determined\nto consult her father. Then on the last day of the month he received\nthe following letter:--\n\n\n   Dresden, March 27th, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR FRIEND,--\n\n   At last we have resolved that we will go back to\n   England,--almost at once. Things have gone so rapidly\n   that I hardly know how to explain them all, but that is\n   Papa's resolution. His lawyer, Mr. Forster, tells him\n   that it will be best, and goes so far as to say that it\n   is imperative on my behalf that some steps should be taken\n   to put an end to the present state of things. I will\n   not scruple to tell you that he is actuated chiefly by\n   considerations as to money. It is astonishing to me that\n   a man who has all his life been so liberal should now in\n   his old age think so much about it. It is, however, in no\n   degree for himself. It is all for me. He cannot bear to\n   think that my fortune should be withheld from me by Mr.\n   Kennedy while I have done nothing wrong. I was obliged to\n   show him your letter, and what you said about the control\n   of money took hold of his mind at once. He thinks that\n   if my unfortunate husband be insane, there can be no\n   difficulty in my obtaining a separation on terms which\n   would oblige him or his friends to restore this horrid\n   money.\n\n   Of course I could stay if I chose. Papa would not refuse\n   to find a home for me here. But I do agree with Mr.\n   Forster that something should be done to stop the tongues\n   of ill-conditioned people. The idea of having my name\n   dragged through the newspapers is dreadful to me; but if\n   this must be done one way or the other, it will be better\n   that it should be done with truth. There is nothing that\n   I need fear,--as you know so well.\n\n   I cannot look forward to happiness anywhere. If the\n   question of separation were once settled, I do not know\n   whether I would not prefer returning here to remaining in\n   London. Papa has got tired of the place, and wants, he\n   says, to see Saulsby once again before he dies. What can\n   I say in answer to this, but that I will go? We have sent\n   to have the house in Portman Square got ready for us, and\n   I suppose we shall be there about the 15th of next month.\n   Papa has instructed Mr. Forster to tell Mr. Kennedy's\n   lawyer that we are coming, and he is to find out, if he\n   can, whether any interference in the management of the\n   property has been as yet made by the family. Perhaps I\n   ought to tell you that Mr. Forster has expressed surprise\n   that you did not call on the police when the shot was\n   fired. Of course I can understand it all. God bless you.\n\n   Your affectionate friend,\n\n   L. K.\n\n\nPhineas was obliged to console himself by reflecting that if she\nunderstood him of course that was everything. His first and great\nduty in the matter had been to her. If in performing that duty he had\nsacrificed himself, he must bear his undeserved punishment like a\nman. That he was to be punished he began to perceive too clearly. The\nconviction that Mr. Daubeny must recede from the Treasury Bench after\nthe coming debate became every day stronger, and within the little\ninner circles of the Liberal party the usual discussions were made\nas to the Ministry which Mr. Gresham would, as a matter of course,\nbe called upon to form. But in these discussions Phineas Finn did\nnot find himself taking an assured and comfortable part. Laurence\nFitzgibbon, his countryman,--who in the way of work had never been\nworth his salt,--was eager, happy, and without a doubt. Others of the\nold stagers, men who had been going in and out ever since they had\nbeen able to get seats in Parliament, stood about in clubs, and in\nlobbies, and chambers of the House, with all that busy, magpie air\nwhich is worn only by those who have high hopes of good things to\ncome speedily. Lord Mount Thistle was more sublime and ponderous\nthan ever, though they who best understood the party declared that\nhe would never again be invited to undergo the cares of office. His\nlordship was one of those terrible political burdens, engendered\noriginally by private friendship or family considerations, which\none Minister leaves to another. Sir Gregory Grogram, the great Whig\nlawyer, showed plainly by his manner that he thought himself at last\nsecure of reaching the reward for which he had been struggling all\nhis life; for it was understood by all men who knew anything that\nLord Weazeling was not to be asked again to sit on the Woolsack.\nNo better advocate or effective politician ever lived; but it was\nsupposed that he lacked dignity for the office of first judge in\nthe land. That most of the old lot would come back was a matter of\ncourse.\n\nThere would be the Duke,--the Duke of St. Bungay, who had for years\npast been \"the Duke\" when Liberal administrations were discussed, and\nthe second Duke, whom we know so well; and Sir Harry Coldfoot, and\nLegge Wilson, Lord Cantrip, Lord Thrift, and the rest of them. There\nwould of course be Lord Fawn, Mr. Ratler, and Mr. Erle. The thing was\nso thoroughly settled that one was almost tempted to think that the\nPrime Minister himself would have no voice in the selections to be\nmade. As to one office it was acknowledged on all sides that a doubt\nexisted which would at last be found to be very injurious,--as some\nthought altogether crushing,--to the party. To whom would Mr. Gresham\nentrust the financial affairs of the country? Who would be the new\nChancellor of the Exchequer? There were not a few who inferred that\nMr. Bonteen would be promoted to that high office. During the last\ntwo years he had devoted himself to decimal coinage with a zeal only\nsecond to that displayed by Plantagenet Palliser, and was accustomed\nto say of himself that he had almost perished under his exertions. It\nwas supposed that he would have the support of the present Duke of\nOmnium,--and that Mr. Gresham, who disliked the man, would be coerced\nby the fact that there was no other competitor. That Mr. Bonteen\nshould go into the Cabinet would be gall and wormwood to many brother\nLiberals; but gall and wormwood such as this have to be swallowed.\nThe rising in life of our familiar friends is, perhaps, the bitterest\nmorsel of the bitter bread which we are called upon to eat in life.\nBut we do eat it; and after a while it becomes food to us,--when we\nfind ourselves able to use, on behalf, perhaps, of our children, the\ninfluence of those whom we had once hoped to leave behind in the race\nof life. When a man suddenly shoots up into power few suffer from it\nvery acutely. The rise of a Pitt can have caused no heart-burning.\nBut Mr. Bonteen had been a hack among the hacks, had filled the usual\nhalf-dozen places, had been a junior Lord, a Vice-President, a Deputy\nController, a Chief Commissioner, and a Joint Secretary. His hopes\nhad been raised or abased among the places of \u00c2\u00a31,000, \u00c2\u00a31,200, or\n\u00c2\u00a31,500 a year. He had hitherto culminated at \u00c2\u00a32,000, and had been\nsupposed with diligence to have worked himself up to the top of\nthe ladder, as far as the ladder was accessible to him. And now he\nwas spoken of in connection with one of the highest offices of the\nState! Of course this created much uneasiness, and gave rise to\nmany prophecies of failure. But in the midst of it all no office\nwas assigned to Phineas Finn; and there was a general feeling, not\nexpressed, but understood, that his affair with Mr. Kennedy stood in\nhis way.\n\nQuintus Slide had undertaken to crush him! Could it be possible that\nso mean a man should be able to make good so monstrous a threat?\nThe man was very mean, and the threat had been absurd as well as\nmonstrous; and yet it seemed that it might be realised. Phineas was\ntoo proud to ask questions, even of Barrington Erle, but he felt\nthat he was being \"left out in the cold,\" because the editor of The\nPeople's Banner had said that no government could employ him; and at\nthis moment, on the very morning of the day which was to usher in the\ngreat debate, which was to be so fatal to Mr. Daubeny and his Church\nReform, another thunderbolt was hurled. The \"we\" of The People's\nBanner had learned that the very painful matter, to which they had\nbeen compelled by a sense of duty to call the public attention in\nreference to the late member for Dunross-shire and the present member\nfor Tankerville, would be brought before one of the tribunals of the\ncountry, in reference to the matrimonial differences between Mr.\nKennedy and his wife. It would be in the remembrance of their readers\nthat the unfortunate gentleman had been provoked to fire a pistol\nat the head of the member for Tankerville,--a circumstance which,\nthough publicly known, had never been brought under the notice of\nthe police. There was reason to hope that the mystery might now\nbe cleared up, and that the ends of justice would demand that a\ncertain document should be produced, which they,--the \"we,\"--had been\nvexatiously restrained from giving to their readers, although it had\nbeen most carefully prepared for publication in the columns of The\nPeople's Banner. Then the thunderbolt went on to say that there was\nevidently a great move among the members of the so-called Liberal\nparty, who seemed to think that it was only necessary that they\nshould open their mouths wide enough in order that the sweets of\noffice should fall into them. The \"we\" were quite of a different\nopinion. The \"we\" believed that no Minister for many a long day had\nbeen so firmly fixed on the Treasury Bench as was Mr. Daubeny at the\npresent moment. But this at any rate might be inferred;--that should\nMr. Gresham by any unhappy combination of circumstances be called\nupon to form a Ministry, it would be quite impossible for him to\ninclude within it the name of the member for Tankerville. This was\nthe second great thunderbolt that fell,--and so did the work of\ncrushing our poor friend proceed.\n\nThere was a great injustice in all this; at least so Phineas\nthought;--injustice, not only from the hands of Mr. Slide, who was\nunjust as a matter of course, but also from those who ought to have\nbeen his staunch friends. He had been enticed over to England almost\nwith a promise of office, and he was sure that he had done nothing\nwhich deserved punishment, or even censure. He could not condescend\nto complain,--nor indeed as yet could he say that there was ground\nfor complaint. Nothing had been done to him. Not a word had been\nspoken,--except those lying words in the newspapers which he was too\nproud to notice. On one matter, however, he was determined to be\nfirm. When Barrington Erle had absolutely insisted that he should\nvote upon the Church Bill in opposition to all that he had said upon\nthe subject at Tankerville, he had stipulated that he should have an\nopportunity in the great debate which would certainly take place of\nexplaining his conduct,--or, in other words, that the privilege of\nmaking a speech should be accorded to him at a time in which very\nmany members would no doubt attempt to speak and would attempt in\nvain. It may be imagined,--probably still is imagined by a great\nmany,--that no such pledge as this could be given, that the right\nto speak depends simply on the Speaker's eye, and that energy at\nthe moment in attracting attention would alone be of account to an\neager orator. But Phineas knew the House too well to trust to such\na theory. That some preliminary assistance would be given to the\ntravelling of the Speaker's eye, in so important a debate, he knew\nvery well; and he knew also that a promise from Barrington Erle or\nfrom Mr. Ratler would be his best security. \"That will be all right,\nof course,\" said Barrington Erle to him on the evening the day before\nthe debate: \"We have quite counted on your speaking.\" There had been\na certain sullenness in the tone with which Phineas had asked his\nquestion as though he had been labouring under a grievance, and he\nfelt himself rebuked by the cordiality of the reply. \"I suppose we\nhad better fix it for Monday or Tuesday,\" said the other. \"We hope\nto get it over by Tuesday, but there is no knowing. At any rate you\nshan't be thrown over.\" It was almost on his tongue,--the entire\nstory of his grievance, the expression of his feeling that he was not\nbeing treated as one of the chosen; but he restrained himself. He\nliked Barrington Erle well enough, but not so well as to justify him\nin asking for sympathy.\n\nNor had it been his wont in any of the troubles of his life to ask\nfor sympathy from a man. He had always gone to some woman;--in old\ndays to Lady Laura, or to Violet Effingham, or to Madame Goesler. By\nthem he could endure to be petted, praised, or upon occasion even\npitied. But pity or praise from any man had been distasteful to him.\nOn the morning of the 1st of April he again went to Park Lane, not\nwith any formed plan of telling the lady of his wrongs, but driven by\na feeling that he wanted comfort, which might perhaps be found there.\nThe lady received him very kindly, and at once inquired as to the\ngreat political tournament which was about to be commenced. \"Yes; we\nbegin to-day,\" said Phineas. \"Mr. Daubeny will speak, I should say,\nfrom half-past four till seven. I wonder you don't go and hear him.\"\n\n\"What a pleasure! To hear a man speak for two hours and a half about\nthe Church of England. One must be very hard driven for amusement!\nWill you tell me that you like it?\"\n\n\"I like to hear a good speech.\"\n\n\"But you have the excitement before you of making a good speech in\nanswer. You are in the fight. A poor woman, shut up in a cage, feels\nthere more acutely than anywhere else how insignificant a position\nshe fills in the world.\"\n\n\"You don't advocate the rights of women, Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Knowing our inferiority I submit without a grumble; but I am\nnot sure that I care to go and listen to the squabbles of my masters.\nYou may arrange it all among you, and I will accept what you do,\nwhether it be good or bad,--as I must; but I cannot take so much\ninterest in the proceeding as to spend my time in listening where I\ncannot speak, and in looking when I cannot be seen. You will speak?\"\n\n\"Yes; I think so.\"\n\n\"I shall read your speech, which is more than I shall do for most of\nthe others. And when it is all over, will your turn come?\"\n\n\"Not mine individually, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"But it will be yours individually;--will it not?\" she asked with\nenergy. Then gradually, with half-pronounced sentences, he explained\nto her that even in the event of the formation of a Liberal\nGovernment, he did not expect that any place would be offered to him.\n\"And why not? We have been all speaking of it as a certainty.\"\n\nHe longed to inquire who were the all of whom she spoke, but he could\nnot do it without an egotism which would be distasteful to him. \"I\ncan hardly tell;--but I don't think I shall be asked to join them.\"\n\n\"You would wish it?\"\n\n\"Yes;--talking to you I do not see why I should hesitate to say so.\"\n\n\"Talking to me, why should you hesitate to say anything about\nyourself that is true? I can hold my tongue. I do not gossip about my\nfriends. Whose doing is it?\"\n\n\"I do not know that it is any man's doing.\"\n\n\"But it must be. Everybody said that you were to be one of them if\nyou could get the other people out. Is it Mr. Bonteen?\"\n\n\"Likely enough. Not that I know anything of the kind; but as I hate\nhim from the bottom of my heart, it is natural to suppose that he has\nthe same feeling in regard to me.\"\n\n\"I agree with you there.\"\n\n\"But I don't know that it comes from any feeling of that kind.\"\n\n\"What does it come from?\"\n\n\"You have heard all the calumny about Lady Laura Kennedy.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say that a story such as that has affected your\nposition.\"\n\n\"I fancy it has. But you must not suppose, Madame Goesler, that I\nmean to complain. A man must take these things as they come. No one\nhas received more kindness from friends than I have, and few perhaps\nmore favours from fortune. All this about Mr. Kennedy has been\nunlucky,--but it cannot be helped.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that the morals of your party will be offended?\"\nsaid Madame Goesler, almost laughing.\n\n\"Lord Fawn, you know, is very particular. In sober earnest one cannot\ntell how these things operate; but they do operate gradually. One's\nfriends are sometimes very glad of an excuse for not befriending\none.\"\n\n\"Lady Laura is coming home?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That will put an end to it.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to put an end to except the foul-mouthed malice of\na lying newspaper. Nobody believes anything against Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. I believe nothing against her.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do not, Madame Goesler. Nor do I think that anybody\ndoes. It is too absurd for belief from beginning to end. Good-bye.\nPerhaps I shall see you when the debate is over.\"\n\n\"Of course you will. Good-bye, and success to your oratory.\" Then\nMadame Goesler resolved that she would say a few judicious words to\nher friend, the Duchess, respecting Phineas Finn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nTHE TWO GLADIATORS.\n\n\nThe great debate was commenced with all the solemnities which are\ncustomary on such occasions, and which make men think for the day\nthat no moment of greater excitement has ever blessed or cursed the\ncountry. Upon the present occasion London was full of clergymen.\nThe specially clerical clubs,--the Oxford and Cambridge, the Old\nUniversity, and the Athenaeum,--were black with them. The bishops and\ndeans, as usual, were pleasant in their manner and happy-looking, in\nspite of adverse circumstances. When one sees a bishop in the hours\nof the distress of the Church, one always thinks of the just and\nfirm man who will stand fearless while the ruins of the world are\nfalling about his ears. But the parsons from the country were a sorry\nsight to see. They were in earnest with all their hearts, and did\nbelieve,--not that the crack of doom was coming, which they could\nhave borne with equanimity if convinced that their influence would\nlast to the end,--but that the Evil One was to be made welcome\nupon the earth by Act of Parliament. It is out of nature that any\nman should think it good that his own order should be repressed,\ncurtailed, and deprived of its power. If we go among cab-drivers\nor letter-carriers, among butlers or gamekeepers, among tailors or\nbutchers, among farmers or graziers, among doctors or attorneys, we\nshall find in each set of men a conviction that the welfare of the\ncommunity depends upon the firmness with which they,--especially\nthey,--hold their own. This is so manifestly true with the Bar that\nno barrister in practice scruples to avow that barristers in practice\nare the salt of the earth. The personal confidence of a judge in his\nown position is beautiful, being salutary to the country, though not\nunfrequently damaging to the character of the man. But if this be so\nwith men who are conscious of no higher influence than that exercised\nover the bodies and minds of their fellow creatures, how much\nstronger must be the feeling when the influence affects the soul! To\nthe outsider, or layman, who simply uses a cab, or receives a letter,\nor goes to law, or has to be tried, these pretensions are ridiculous\nor annoying, according to the ascendancy of the pretender at the\nmoment. But as the clerical pretensions are more exacting than\nall others, being put forward with an assertion that no answer is\npossible without breach of duty and sin, so are they more galling.\nThe fight has been going on since the idea of a mitre first entered\nthe heart of a priest,--since dominion in this world has found itself\ncapable of sustentation by the exercise of fear as to the world to\ncome. We do believe,--the majority among us does so,--that if we live\nand die in sin we shall after some fashion come to great punishment,\nand we believe also that by having pastors among us who shall be\nmen of God, we may best aid ourselves and our children in avoiding\nthis bitter end. But then the pastors and men of God can only be\nhuman,--cannot be altogether men of God; and so they have oppressed\nus, and burned us, and tortured us, and hence come to love palaces,\nand fine linen, and purple, and, alas, sometimes, mere luxury and\nidleness. The torturing and the burning, as also to speak truth the\nluxury and the idleness, have, among us, been already conquered, but\nthe idea of ascendancy remains. What is a thoughtful man to do who\nacknowledges the danger of his soul, but cannot swallow his parson\nwhole simply because he has been sent to him from some source in\nwhich he has no special confidence, perhaps by some distant lord,\nperhaps by a Lord Chancellor whose political friend has had a son\nwith a tutor? What is he to do when, in spite of some fine linen\nand purple left among us, the provision for the man of God in his\nparish or district is so poor that no man of God fitted to teach\nhim will come and take it? In no spirit of animosity to religion he\nbegins to tell himself that Church and State together was a monkish\ncombination, fit perhaps for monkish days, but no longer having\nfitness, and not much longer capable of existence in this country.\nBut to the parson himself,--to the honest, hardworking, conscientious\npriest who does in his heart of hearts believe that no diminution in\nthe general influence of his order can be made without ruin to the\nsouls of men,--this opinion, when it becomes dominant, is as though\nthe world were in truth breaking to pieces over his head. The world\nhas been broken to pieces in the same way often;--but extreme Chaos\ndoes not come. The cabman and the letter-carrier always expect that\nChaos will very nearly come when they are disturbed. The barristers\nare sure of Chaos when the sanctity of Benchers is in question. What\nutter Chaos would be promised to us could any one with impunity\ncontemn the majesty of the House of Commons! But of all these\nChaoses there can be no Chaos equal to that which in the mind of a\nzealous Oxford-bred constitutional country parson must attend that\nannihilation of his special condition which will be produced by\nthe disestablishment of the Church. Of all good fellows he is the\nbest good fellow. He is genial, hospitable, well-educated, and\nalways has either a pretty wife or pretty daughters. But he has so\nextreme a belief in himself that he cannot endure to be told that\nabsolute Chaos will not come at once if he be disturbed. And now\ndisturbances,--ay, and utter dislocation and ruin were to come from\nthe hands of a friend! Was it wonderful that parsons should be seen\nabout Westminster in flocks with _\"Et tu, Brute\"_ written on their\nfaces as plainly as the law on the brows of a Pharisee?\n\nThe Speaker had been harassed for orders. The powers and prowess\nof every individual member had been put to the test. The galleries\nwere crowded. Ladies' places had been ballotted for with desperate\nenthusiasm, in spite of the sarcasm against the House which Madame\nGoesler had expressed. Two royal princes and a royal duke were\naccommodated within the House in an irregular manner. Peers swarmed\nin the passages, and were too happy to find standing room. Bishops\njostled against lay barons with no other preference than that\nafforded to them by their broader shoulders. Men, and especially\nclergymen, came to the galleries loaded with sandwiches and flasks,\nprepared to hear all there was to be heard should the debate last\nfrom 4 P.M. to the same hour on the following morning. At two in the\nafternoon the entrances to the House were barred, and men of all\nranks,--deans, prebends, peers' sons, and baronets,--stood there\npatiently waiting till some powerful nobleman should let them\nthrough. The very ventilating chambers under the House were filled\nwith courteous listeners, who had all pledged themselves that under\nno possible provocation would they even cough during the debate.\n\nA few minutes after four, in a House from which hardly more than a\ndozen members were absent, Mr. Daubeny took his seat with that air of\naffected indifference to things around him which is peculiar to him.\nHe entered slowly, amidst cheers from his side of the House, which\nno doubt were loud in proportion to the dismay of the cheerers as to\nthe matter in hand. Gentlemen lacking substantial sympathy with their\nleader found it to be comfortable to deceive themselves, and raise\ntheir hearts at the same time by the easy enthusiasm of noise. Mr.\nDaubeny having sat down and covered his head just raised his hat from\nhis brows, and then tried to look as though he were no more than any\nother gentleman present. But the peculiar consciousness of the man\ndisplayed itself even in his constrained absence of motion. You could\nsee that he felt himself to be the beheld of all beholders, and that\nhe enjoyed the position,--with some slight inward trepidation lest\nthe effort to be made should not equal the greatness of the occasion.\nImmediately after him Mr. Gresham bustled up the centre of the House\namidst a roar of good-humoured welcome. We have had many Ministers\nwho have been personally dearer to their individual adherents in the\nHouse than the present leader of the Opposition and late Premier,\nbut none, perhaps, who has been more generally respected by his\nparty for earnestness and sincerity. On the present occasion there\nwas a fierceness, almost a ferocity, in his very countenance, to\nthe fire of which friends and enemies were equally anxious to add\nfuel,--the friends in order that so might these recreant Tories be\nmore thoroughly annihilated, and the enemies, that their enemy's\nindiscretion might act back upon himself to his confusion. For,\nindeed, it never could be denied that as a Prime Minister Mr. Gresham\ncould be very indiscreet.\n\nA certain small amount of ordinary business was done, to the disgust\nof expectant strangers, which was as trivial as possible in its\nnature,--so arranged, apparently, that the importance of what was to\nfollow might be enhanced by the force of contrast. And, to make the\ndismay of the novice stranger more thorough, questions were asked\nand answers were given in so low a voice, and Mr. Speaker uttered a\nword or two in so quick and shambling a fashion, that he, the novice\nstranger, began to fear that no word of the debate would reach him\nup there in his crowded back seat. All this, however, occupied but a\nfew minutes, and at twenty minutes past four Mr. Daubeny was on his\nlegs. Then the novice stranger found that, though he could not see Mr.\nDaubeny without the aid of an opera glass, he could hear every word\nthat fell from his lips.\n\nMr. Daubeny began by regretting the hardness of his position, in that\nhe must, with what thoroughness he might be able to achieve, apply\nhimself to two great subjects, whereas the right honourable gentleman\nopposite had already declared, with all the formality which could be\nmade to attach itself to a combined meeting of peers and commoners,\nthat he would confine himself strictly to one. The subject selected\nby the right honourable gentleman opposite on the present occasion\nwas not the question of Church Reform. The right honourable gentleman\nhad pledged himself with an almost sacred enthusiasm to ignore that\nsubject altogether. No doubt it was the question before the House,\nand he, himself,--the present speaker,--must unfortunately discuss\nit at some length. The right honourable gentleman opposite would not,\non this great occasion, trouble himself with anything of so little\nmoment. And it might be presumed that the political followers of the\nright honourable gentleman would be equally reticent, as they were\nunderstood to have accepted his tactics without a dissentient voice.\nHe, Mr. Daubeny, was the last man in England to deny the importance\nof the question which the right honourable gentleman would select\nfor discussions in preference to that of the condition of the\nChurch. That question was a very simple one, and might be put to\nthe House in a very few words. Coming from the mouth of the right\nhonourable gentleman, the proposition would probably be made in this\nform:--\"That this House does think that I ought to be Prime Minister\nnow, and as long as I may possess a seat in this House.\" It was\nimpossible to deny the importance of that question; but perhaps he,\nMr. Daubeny, might be justified in demurring to the preference given\nto it over every other matter, let that matter be of what importance\nit might be to the material welfare of the country.\n\nHe made his point well; but he made it too often. And an attack of\nthat kind, personal and savage in its nature, loses its effect when\nit is evident that the words have been prepared. A good deal may be\ndone in dispute by calling a man an ass or a knave,--but the resolve\nto use the words should have been made only at the moment, and they\nshould come hot from the heart. There was much neatness and some\nacuteness in Mr. Daubeny's satire, but there was no heat, and it was\nprolix. It had, however, the effect of irritating Mr. Gresham,--as\nwas evident from the manner in which he moved his hat and shuffled\nhis feet.\n\nA man destined to sit conspicuously on our Treasury Bench, or on the\nseat opposite to it, should ask the gods for a thick skin as a first\ngift. The need of this in our national assembly is greater than\nelsewhere, because the differences between the men opposed to each\nother are smaller. When two foes meet together in the same Chamber,\none of whom advocates the personal government of an individual ruler,\nand the other that form of State, which has come to be called a Red\nRepublic, they deal, no doubt, weighty blows of oratory at each\nother, but blows which never hurt at the moment. They may cut each\nother's throats if they can find an opportunity; but they do not bite\neach other like dogs over a bone. But when opponents are almost in\naccord, as is always the case with our parliamentary gladiators,\nthey are ever striving to give maddening little wounds through\nthe joints of the harness. What is there with us to create the\ndivergence necessary for debate but the pride of personal skill in\nthe encounter? Who desires among us to put down the Queen, or to\nrepudiate the National Debt, or to destroy religious worship, or even\nto disturb the ranks of society? When some small measure of reform\nhas thoroughly recommended itself to the country,--so thoroughly that\nall men know that the country will have it,--then the question arises\nwhether its details shall be arranged by the political party which\ncalls itself Liberal,--or by that which is termed Conservative. The\nmen are so near to each other in all their convictions and theories\nof life that nothing is left to them but personal competition for the\ndoing of the thing that is to be done. It is the same in religion.\nThe apostle of Christianity and the infidel can meet without a chance\nof a quarrel; but it is never safe to bring together two men who\ndiffer about a saint or a surplice.\n\nMr. Daubeny, having thus attacked and wounded his enemy, rushed\nboldly into the question of Church Reform, taking no little pride\nto himself and to his party that so great a blessing should be\nbestowed upon the country from so unexpected a source. \"See what we\nConservatives can do. In fact we will conserve nothing when we find\nthat you do not desire to have it conserved any longer. 'Quod minime\nreris Grai\u00c3\u00a2 pandetur ab urbe.'\" It was exactly the reverse of the\ncomplaint which Mr. Gresham was about to make. On the subject of\nthe Church itself he was rather misty but very profound. He went\ninto the question of very early Churches indeed, and spoke of the\nmisappropriation of endowments in the time of Eli. The establishment\nof the Levites had been no doubt complete; but changes had been\neffected as circumstances required. He was presumed to have alluded\nto the order of Melchisedek, but he abstained from any mention of the\nname. He roamed very wide, and gave many of his hearers an idea that\nhis erudition had carried him into regions in which it was impossible\nto follow him. The gist of his argument was to show that audacity in\nReform was the very backbone of Conservatism. By a clearly pronounced\ndisunion of Church and State the theocracy of Thomas \u00c3\u00a0 Becket would\nbe restored, and the people of England would soon again become the\nfaithful flocks of faithful shepherds. By taking away the endowments\nfrom the parishes, and giving them back in some complicated way to\nthe country, the parishes would be better able than ever to support\ntheir clergymen. Bishops would be bishops indeed, when they were no\nlonger the creatures of a Minister's breath. As to the deans, not\nseeing a clear way to satisfy aspirants for future vacancies in the\ndeaneries, he became more than usually vague, but seemed to imply\nthat the Bill which was now with the leave of the House to be read\na second time, contained no clause forbidding the appointment of\ndeans, though the special stipend of the office must be matter of\nconsideration with the new Church Synod.\n\nThe details of this part of his speech were felt to be dull by the\nstrangers. As long as he would abuse Mr. Gresham, men could listen\nwith pleasure; and could keep their attention fixed while he referred\nto the general Conservatism of the party which he had the honour\nof leading. There was a raciness in the promise of so much Church\ndestruction from the chosen leader of the Church party, which was\nassisted by a conviction in the minds of most men that it was\nimpossible for unfortunate Conservatives to refuse to follow this\nleader, let him lead where he might. There was a gratification in\nfeeling that the country party was bound to follow, even should he\ntake them into the very bowels of a mountain, as the pied piper did\nthe children of Hamelin;--and this made listening pleasant. But when\nMr. Daubeny stated the effect of his different clauses, explaining\nwhat was to be taken and what left,--with a fervent assurance that\nwhat was to be left would, under the altered circumstances, go much\nfurther than the whole had gone before,--then the audience became\nweary, and began to think that it was time that some other gentleman\nshould be upon his legs. But at the end of the Minister's speech\nthere was another touch of invective which went far to redeem him.\nHe returned to that personal question to which his adversary had\nundertaken to confine himself, and expressed a holy horror at\nthe political doctrine which was implied. He, during a prolonged\nParliamentary experience, had encountered much factious opposition.\nHe would even acknowledge that he had seen it exercised on both sides\nof the House, though he had always striven to keep himself free from\nits baneful influence. But never till now had he known a statesman\nproclaim his intention of depending upon faction, and upon faction\nalone, for the result which he desired to achieve. Let the right\nhonourable gentleman raise a contest on either the principles or\nthe details of the measure, and he would be quite content to abide\nthe decision of the House; but he should regard such a raid as that\nthreatened against him and his friends by the right honourable\ngentleman as unconstitutional, revolutionary, and tyrannical. He felt\nsure that an opposition so based, and so maintained, even if it be\nenabled by the heated feelings of the moment to obtain an unfortunate\nsuccess in the House, would not be encouraged by the sympathy\nand support of the country at large. By these last words he was\nunderstood to signify that should he be beaten on the second reading,\nnot in reference to the merits of the Bill, but simply on the issue\nas proposed by Mr. Gresham, he would again dissolve the House before\nhe would resign. Now it was very well understood that there were\nLiberal members in the House who would prefer even the success of Mr.\nDaubeny to a speedy reappearance before their constituents.\n\nMr. Daubeny spoke till nearly eight, and it was surmised at the time\nthat he had craftily arranged his oratory so as to embarrass his\nopponent. The House had met at four, and was to sit continuously till\nit was adjourned for the night. When this is the case, gentlemen\nwho speak about eight o'clock are too frequently obliged to address\nthemselves to empty benches. On the present occasion it was Mr.\nGresham's intention to follow his opponent at once, instead of\nwaiting, as is usual with a leader of his party, to the close of the\ndebate. It was understood that Mr. Gresham would follow Mr. Daubeny,\nwith the object of making a distinct charge against Ministers, so\nthat the vote on this second reading of the Church Bill might in\ntruth be a vote of want of confidence. But to commence his speech at\neight o'clock when the House was hungry and uneasy, would be a trial.\nHad Mr. Daubeny closed an hour sooner there would, with a little\nstretching of the favoured hours, have been time enough. Members\nwould not have objected to postpone their dinner till half-past\neight, or perhaps nine, when their favourite orator was on his legs.\nBut with Mr. Gresham beginning a great speech at eight, dinner would\naltogether become doubtful, and the disaster might be serious. It was\nnot probable that Mr. Daubeny had even among his friends proclaimed\nany such strategy; but it was thought by the political speculators of\nthe day that such an idea had been present to his mind.\n\nBut Mr. Gresham was not to be turned from his purpose. He waited for\na few moments, and then rose and addressed the Speaker. A few members\nleft the House;--gentlemen, doubtless, whose constitutions, weakened\nby previous service, could not endure prolonged fasting. Some who had\nnearly reached the door returned to their seats, mindful of Messrs.\nRoby and Ratler. But for the bulk of those assembled the interest\nof the moment was greater even than the love of dinner. Some of the\npeers departed, and it was observed that a bishop or two left the\nHouse; but among the strangers in the gallery, hardly a foot of space\nwas gained. He who gave up his seat then, gave it up for the night.\n\nMr. Gresham began with a calmness of tone which seemed almost to be\naffected, but which arose from a struggle on his own part to repress\nthat superabundant energy of which he was only too conscious. But the\ncalmness soon gave place to warmth, which heated itself into violence\nbefore he had been a quarter of an hour upon his legs. He soon became\neven ferocious in his invective, and said things so bitter that\nhe had himself no conception of their bitterness. There was this\ndifference between the two men,--that whereas Mr. Daubeny hit always\nas hard as he knew how to hit, having premeditated each blow, and\nweighed its results beforehand, having calculated his power even to\nthe effect of a blow repeated on a wound already given, Mr. Gresham\nstruck right and left and straightforward with a readiness engendered\nby practice, and in his fury might have murdered his antagonist\nbefore he was aware that he had drawn blood. He began by refusing\nabsolutely to discuss the merits of the bill. The right honourable\ngentleman had prided himself on his generosity as a Greek. He would\nremind the right honourable gentleman that presents from Greeks had\never been considered dangerous. \"It is their gifts, and only their\ngifts, that we fear,\" he said. The political gifts of the right\nhonourable gentleman, extracted by him from his unwilling colleagues\nand followers, had always been more bitter to the taste than Dead\nSea apples. That such gifts should not be bestowed on the country\nby unwilling hands, that reform should not come from those who\nthemselves felt the necessity of no reform, he believed to be\nthe wish not only of that House, but of the country at large.\nWould any gentleman on that bench, excepting the right honourable\ngentleman himself,--and he pointed to the crowded phalanx of the\nGovernment,--get up and declare that this measure of Church Reform,\nthis severance of Church and State, was brought forward in consonance\nwith his own long-cherished political conviction? He accused that\nparty of being so bound to the chariot wheels of the right honourable\ngentleman, as to be unable to abide by their own convictions. And as\nto the right honourable gentleman himself, he would appeal to his\nfollowers opposite to say whether the right honourable gentleman was\npossessed of any one strong political conviction.\n\nHe had been accused of being unconstitutional, revolutionary, and\ntyrannical. If the House would allow him he would very shortly\nexplain his idea of constitutional government as carried on in this\ncountry. It was based and built on majorities in that House, and\nsupported solely by that power. There could be no constitutional\ngovernment in this country that was not so maintained. Any other\ngovernment must be both revolutionary and tyrannical. Any other\ngovernment was a usurpation; and he would make bold to tell the\nright honourable gentleman that a Minister in this country who should\nrecommend Her Majesty to trust herself to advisers not supported by a\nmajority of the House of Commons, would plainly be guilty of usurping\nthe powers of the State. He threw from him with disdain the charge\nwhich had been brought against himself of hankering after the sweets\nof office. He indulged and gloried in indulging the highest ambition\nof an English subject. But he gloried much more in the privileges and\npower of that House, within the walls of which was centred all that\nwas salutary, all that was efficacious, all that was stable in the\npolitical constitution of his country. It had been his pride to have\nacted during nearly all his political life with that party which had\ncommanded a majority, but he would defy his most bitter adversary, he\nwould defy the right honourable gentleman himself, to point to any\nperiod of his career in which he had been unwilling to succumb to a\nmajority when he himself had belonged to the minority.\n\nHe himself would regard the vote on this occasion as a vote of want\nof confidence. He took the line he was now taking because he desired\nto bring the House to a decision on that question. He himself had not\nthat confidence in the right honourable gentleman which would justify\nhim in accepting a measure on so important a subject as the union or\nseverance of Church and State from his hands. Should the majority of\nthe House differ from him and support the second reading of the Bill,\nhe would at once so far succumb as to give his best attention to\nthe clauses of the bill, and endeavour with the assistance of those\ngentlemen who acted with him to make it suitable to the wants of the\ncountry by omissions and additions as the clauses should pass through\nCommittee. But before doing that he would ask the House to decide\nwith all its solemnity and all its weight whether it was willing to\naccept from the hands of the right honourable gentleman any measure\nof reform on a matter so important as this now before them. It was\nnearly ten when he sat down; and then the stomach of the House could\nstand it no longer, and an adjournment at once took place.\n\nOn the next morning it was generally considered that Mr. Daubeny had\nbeen too long and Mr. Gresham too passionate. There were some who\ndeclared that Mr. Gresham had never been finer than when he described\nthe privileges of the House of Commons; and others who thought that\nMr. Daubeny's lucidity had been marvellous; but in this case, as in\nmost others, the speeches of the day were generally thought to have\nbeen very inferior to the great efforts of the past.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nTHE UNIVERSE.\n\n\nBefore the House met again the quidnuncs about the clubs, on both\nsides of the question, had determined that Mr. Gresham's speech,\nwhether good or not as an effort of oratory, would serve its intended\npurpose. He would be backed by a majority of votes, and it might\nhave been very doubtful whether such would have been the case had\nhe attempted to throw out the Bill on its merits. Mr. Ratler, by\nthe time that prayers had been read, had become almost certain of\nsuccess. There were very few Liberals in the House who were not\nanxious to declare by their votes that they had no confidence in Mr.\nDaubeny. Mr. Turnbull, the great Radical, and, perhaps, some two\ndozen with him, would support the second reading, declaring that they\ncould not reconcile it with their consciences to record a vote in\nfavour of a union of Church and State. On all such occasions as the\npresent Mr. Turnbull was sure to make himself disagreeable to those\nwho sat near to him in the House. He was a man who thought that so\nmuch was demanded of him in order that his independence might be\ndoubted by none. It was nothing to him, he was wont to say, who\ncalled himself Prime Minister, or Secretary here, or President there.\nBut then there would be quite as much of this independence on the\nConservative as on the Liberal side of the House. Surely there would\nbe more than two dozen gentlemen who would be true enough to the\ncherished principles of their whole lives to vote against such a Bill\nas this! It was the fact that there were so very few so true which\nadded such a length to the faces of the country parsons. Six months\nago not a country gentleman in England would have listened to such a\nproposition without loud protests as to its revolutionary wickedness.\nAnd now, under the sole pressure of one man's authority, the subject\nhad become so common that men were assured that the thing would be\ndone even though of all things that could be done it were the worst.\n\"It is no good any longer having any opinion upon anything,\" one\nparson said to another, as they sat together at their club with\ntheir newspapers in their hands. \"Nothing frightens any one,--no\ninfidelity, no wickedness, no revolution. All reverence is at an end,\nand the Holy of Holies is no more even to the worshipper than the\nthreshold of the Temple.\" Though it became known that the Bill would\nbe lost, what comfort was there in that, when the battle was to be\nwon, not by the chosen Israelites to whom the Church with all its\nappurtenances ought to be dear, but by a crew of Philistines who\nwould certainly follow the lead of their opponents in destroying the\nholy structure?\n\nOn the Friday the debate was continued with much life on the\nMinisterial side of the House. It was very easy for them to cry\nFaction! Faction! and hardly necessary for them to do more. A few\nparrot words had been learned as to the expediency of fitting the\ngreat and increasing Church of England to the growing necessity of\nthe age. That the CHURCH OF ENGLAND would still be the CHURCH OF\nENGLAND was repeated till weary listeners were sick of the unmeaning\nwords. But the zeal of the combatants was displayed on that other\nquestion. Faction was now the avowed weapon of the leaders of\nthe so-called Liberal side of the House, and it was very easy to\ndenounce the new doctrine. Every word that Mr. Gresham had spoken\nwas picked in pieces, and the enormity of his theory was exhibited.\nHe had boldly declared to them that they were to regard men and not\nmeasures, and they were to show by their votes whether they were\nprepared to accept such teaching. The speeches were, of course, made\nby alternate orators, but the firing from the Conservative benches\nwas on this evening much the louder.\n\nIt would have seemed that with such an issue between them they might\nalmost have consented to divide after the completion of the two great\nspeeches. The course on which they were to run had been explained\nto them, and it was not probable that any member's intention as to\nhis running would now be altered by anything that he might hear. Mr.\nTurnbull's two dozen defaulters were all known, and the two dozen and\nfour true Conservatives were known also. But, nevertheless, a great\nmany members were anxious to speak. It would be the great debate\nof the Session, and the subject to be handled,--that, namely, of\nthe general merits and demerits of the two political parties,--was\nwide and very easy. On that night it was past one o'clock when Mr.\nTurnbull adjourned the House.\n\n\"I'm afraid we must put you off till Tuesday,\" Mr. Ratler said on the\nSunday afternoon to Phineas Finn.\n\n\"I have no objection at all, so long as I get a fair place on that\nday.\"\n\n\"There shan't be a doubt about that. Gresham particularly wants you\nto speak, because you are pledged to a measure of disestablishment.\nYou can insist on his own views,--that even should such a measure be\nessentially necessary--\"\n\n\"Which I think it is,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Still it should not be accepted from the old Church-and-State\nparty.\"\n\nThere was something pleasant in this to Phineas Finn,--something that\nmade him feel for the moment that he had perhaps mistaken the bearing\nof his friend towards him. \"We are sure of a majority, I suppose,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Absolutely sure,\" said Ratler. \"I begin to think it will amount to\nhalf a hundred,--perhaps more.\"\n\n\"What will Daubeny do?\"\n\n\"Go out. He can't do anything else. His pluck is certainly wonderful,\nbut even with his pluck he can't dissolve again. His Church Bill has\ngiven him a six months' run, and six months is something.\"\n\n\"Is it true that Grogram is to be Chancellor?\" Phineas asked the\nquestion, not from any particular solicitude as to the prospects\nof Sir Gregory Grogram, but because he was anxious to hear whether\nMr. Ratler would speak to him with anything of the cordiality of\nfellowship respecting the new Government. But Mr. Ratler became at\nonce discreet and close, and said that he did not think that anything\nas yet was known as to the Woolsack. Then Phineas retreated again\nwithin his shell, with a certainty that nothing would be done for\nhim.\n\nAnd yet to whom could this question of place be of such vital\nimportance as it was to him? He had come back to his old haunts from\nIreland, abandoning altogether the pleasant safety of an assured\nincome, buoyed by the hope of office. He had, after a fashion, made\nhis calculations. In the present disposition of the country it was,\nhe thought, certain that the Liberal party must, for the next twenty\nyears, have longer periods of power than their opponents; and he had\nthought also that were he in the House, some place would eventually\nbe given to him. He had been in office before, and had been\nespecially successful. He knew that it had been said of him that of\nthe young debutants of latter years he had been the best. He had left\nhis party by opposing them; but he had done so without creating any\nill-will among the leaders of his party,--in a manner that had been\nregarded as highly honourable to him, and on departing had received\nexpressions of deep regret from Mr. Gresham himself. When Barrington\nErle had wanted him to return to his old work, his own chief doubt\nhad been about the seat. But he had been bold and had adventured all,\nand had succeeded. There had been some little trouble about those\npledges given at Tankerville, but he would be able to turn them even\nto the use of his party. It was quite true that nothing had been\npromised him; but Erle, when he had written, bidding him to come over\nfrom Ireland, must have intended him to understand that he would be\nagain enrolled in the favoured regiment, should he be able to show\nhimself as the possessor of a seat in the House. And yet,--yet he\nfelt convinced that when the day should come it would be to him a\nday of disappointment, and that when the list should appear his name\nwould not be on it. Madame Goesler had suggested to him that Mr.\nBonteen might be his enemy, and he had replied by stating that he\nhimself hated Mr. Bonteen. He now remembered that Mr. Bonteen had\nhardly spoken to him since his return to London, though there had not\nin fact been any quarrel between them. In this condition of mind he\nlonged to speak openly to Barrington Erle, but he was restrained by\na feeling of pride, and a still existing idea that no candidate for\noffice, let his claim be what it might, should ask for a place. On\nthat Sunday evening he saw Bonteen at the club. Men were going in and\nout with that feverish excitement which always prevails on the eve of\na great parliamentary change. A large majority against the Government\nwas considered to be certain; but there was an idea abroad that\nMr. Daubeny had some scheme in his head by which to confute the\nimmediate purport of his enemies. There was nothing to which the\naudacity of the man was not equal. Some said that he would dissolve\nthe House,--which had hardly as yet been six months sitting.\nOthers were of opinion that he would simply resolve not to vacate\nhis place,--thus defying the majority of the House and all the\nministerial traditions of the country. Words had fallen from him\nwhich made some men certain that such was his intention. That it\nshould succeed ultimately was impossible. The whole country would\nrise against him. Supplies would be refused. In every detail of\nGovernment he would be impeded. But then,--such was the temper of\nthe man,--it was thought that all these horrors would not deter him.\nThere would be a blaze and a confusion, in which timid men would\ndoubt whether the constitution would be burned to tinder or only\nilluminated; but that blaze and that confusion would be dear to\nMr. Daubeny if he could stand as the centre figure,--the great\npyrotechnist who did it all, red from head to foot with the glare of\nthe squibs with which his own hands were filling all the spaces. The\nanticipation that some such display might take place made men busy\nand eager; so that on that Sunday evening they roamed about from\none place of meeting to another, instead of sitting at home with\ntheir wives and daughters. There was at this time existing a small\nclub,--so called though unlike other clubs,--which had entitled\nitself the Universe. The name was supposed to be a joke, as it was\nlimited to ninety-nine members. It was domiciled in one simple and\nsomewhat mean apartment. It was kept open only one hour before and\none hour after midnight, and that only on two nights of the week,\nand that only when Parliament was sitting. Its attractions were not\nnumerous, consisting chiefly of tobacco and tea. The conversation was\ngenerally listless and often desultory; and occasionally there would\narise the great and terrible evil of a punster whom every one hated\nbut no one had life enough to put down. But the thing had been a\nsuccess, and men liked to be members of the Universe. Mr. Bonteen was\na member, and so was Phineas Finn. On this Sunday evening the club\nwas open, and Phineas, as he entered the room, perceived that his\nenemy was seated alone on a corner of a sofa. Mr. Bonteen was not a\nman who loved to be alone in public places, and was apt rather to\nmake one of congregations, affecting popularity, and always at work\nincreasing his influence. But on this occasion his own greatness had\nprobably isolated him. If it were true that he was to be the new\nChancellor of the Exchequer,--to ascend from demi-godhead to the\nperfect divinity of the Cabinet,--and to do so by a leap which would\nmake him high even among first-class gods, it might be well for\nhimself to look to himself and choose new congregations. Or, at\nleast, it would be becoming that he should be chosen now instead of\nbeing a chooser. He was one who could weigh to the last ounce the\nimportance of his position, and make most accurate calculations as\nto the effect of his intimacies. On that very morning Mr. Gresham\nhad suggested to him that in the event of a Liberal Government being\nformed, he should hold the high office in question. This, perhaps,\nhad not been done in the most flattering manner, as Mr. Gresham had\ndeeply bewailed the loss of Mr. Palliser, and had almost demanded a\npledge from Mr. Bonteen that he would walk exactly in Mr. Palliser's\nfootsteps;--but the offer had been made, and could not be retracted;\nand Mr. Bonteen already felt the warmth of the halo of perfect\ndivinity.\n\nThere are some men who seem to have been born to be Cabinet\nMinisters,--dukes mostly, or earls, or the younger sons of such,--who\nhave been trained to it from their very cradles, and of whom we may\nimagine that they are subject to no special awe when they first\nenter into that august assembly, and feel but little personal\nelevation. But to the political aspirant not born in the purple of\npublic life, this entrance upon the counsels of the higher deities\nmust be accompanied by a feeling of supreme triumph, dashed by\nconsiderable misgivings. Perhaps Mr. Bonteen was revelling in his\ntriumph;--perhaps he was anticipating his misgivings. Phineas, though\ndisinclined to make any inquiries of a friend which might seem to\nrefer to his own condition, felt no such reluctance in regard to\none who certainly could not suspect him of asking a favour. He was\npresumed to be on terms of intimacy with the man, and he took his\nseat beside him, asking some question as to the debate. Now Mr.\nBonteen had more than once expressed an opinion among his friends\nthat Phineas Finn would throw his party over, and vote with the\nGovernment. The Ratlers and Erles and Fitzgibbons all knew that\nPhineas was safe, but Mr. Bonteen was still in doubt. It suited him\nto affect something more than doubt on the present occasion. \"I\nwonder that you should ask me,\" said Mr. Bonteen.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I presume that you, as usual, will vote against us.\"\n\n\"I never voted against my party but once,\" said Phineas, \"and then I\ndid it with the approbation of every man in it for whose good opinion\nI cared a straw.\" There was insult in his tone as he said this, and\nsomething near akin to insult in his words.\n\n\"You must do it again now, or break every promise that you made at\nTankerville.\"\n\n\"Do you know what promise I made at Tankerville? I shall break no\npromise.\"\n\n\"You must allow me to say, Mr. Finn, that the kind of independence\nwhich is practised by you and Mr. Monk, grand as it may be on the\npart of men who avowedly abstain from office, is a little dangerous\nwhen it is now and again adopted by men who have taken place. I like\nto be sure that the men who are in the same boat with me won't take\nit into their heads that their duty requires them to scuttle the\nship.\" Having so spoken, Mr. Bonteen, with nearly all the grace of a\nfull-fledged Cabinet Minister, rose from his seat on the corner of\nthe sofa and joined a small congregation.\n\nPhineas felt that his ears were tingling and that his face was red.\nHe looked round to ascertain from the countenances of others whether\nthey had heard what had been said. Nobody had been close to them, and\nhe thought that the conversation had been unnoticed. He knew now that\nhe had been imprudent in addressing himself to Mr. Bonteen, though\nthe question that he had first asked had been quite commonplace. As\nit was, the man, he thought, had been determined to affront him,\nand had made a charge against him which he could not allow to pass\nunnoticed. And then there was all the additional bitterness in it\nwhich arose from the conviction that Bonteen had spoken the opinion\nof other men as well as his own, and that he had plainly indicated\nthat the gates of the official paradise were to be closed against the\npresumed offender. Phineas had before believed that it was to be so,\nbut that belief had now become assurance. He got up in his misery to\nleave the room, but as he did so he met Laurence Fitzgibbon. \"You\nhave heard the news about Bonteen?\" said Laurence.\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"He's to be pitchforked up to the Exchequer. They say it's quite\nsettled. The higher a monkey climbs--; you know the proverb.\" So\nsaying Laurence Fitzgibbon passed into the room, and Phineas Finn\ntook his departure in solitude.\n\nAnd so the man with whom he had managed to quarrel utterly was to be\none in the Cabinet, a man whose voice would probably be potential in\nthe selection of minor members of the Government. It seemed to him to\nbe almost incredible that such a one as Mr. Bonteen should be chosen\nfor such an office. He had despised almost as soon as he had known\nMr. Bonteen, and had rarely heard the future manager of the finance\nof the country spoken of with either respect or regard. He had\nregarded Mr. Bonteen as a useful, dull, unscrupulous politician, well\naccustomed to Parliament, acquainted with the bye-paths and back\ndoors of official life,--and therefore certain of employment when\nthe Liberals were in power; but there was no one in the party he had\nthought less likely to be selected for high place. And yet this man\nwas to be made Chancellor of the Exchequer, while he, Phineas Finn,\nvery probably at this man's instance, was to be left out in the cold.\n\nHe knew himself to be superior to the man he hated, to have higher\nideas of political life, and to be capable of greater political\nsacrifices. He himself had sat shoulder to shoulder with many men\non the Treasury Bench whose political principles he had not greatly\nvalued; but of none of them had he thought so little as he had done\nof Mr. Bonteen. And yet this Mr. Bonteen was to be the new Chancellor\nof the Exchequer! He walked home to his lodgings in Marlborough\nStreet, wretched because of his own failure;--doubly wretched because\nof the other man's success.\n\nHe laid awake half the night thinking of the words that had been\nspoken to him, and after breakfast on the following morning he wrote\nthe following note to his enemy:--\n\n\n   House of Commons, 5th April, 18--.\n\n   DEAR MR. BONTEEN,\n\n   It is matter of extreme regret to me that last night at\n   the Universe I should have asked you some chance question\n   about the coming division. Had I guessed to what it might\n   have led, I should not have addressed you. But as it is\n   I can hardly abstain from noticing what appeared to me\n   to be a personal charge made against myself with a great\n   want of the courtesy which is supposed to prevail among\n   men who have acted together. Had we never done so my\n   original question to you might perhaps have been deemed\n   an impertinence.\n\n   As it was, you accused me of having been dishonest to my\n   party, and of having \"scuttled the ship.\" On the occasion\n   to which you alluded I acted with much consideration,\n   greatly to the detriment of my own prospects,--and as I\n   believed with the approbation of all who knew anything of\n   the subject. If you will make inquiry of Mr. Gresham, or\n   Lord Cantrip who was then my chief, I think that either\n   will tell you that my conduct on that occasion was not\n   such as to lay me open to reproach. If you will do this,\n   I think that you cannot fail afterwards to express regret\n   for what you said to me last night.\n\n   Yours sincerely,\n\n   PHINEAS FINN.\n\n   Thos. Bonteen, Esq., M.P.\n\n\nHe did not like the letter when he had written it, but he did not\nknow how to improve it, and he sent it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nPOLITICAL VENOM.\n\n\nOn the Monday Mr. Turnbull opened the ball by declaring his reasons\nfor going into the same lobby with Mr. Daubeny. This he did at great\nlength. To him all the mighty pomp and all the little squabbles of\noffice were, he said, as nothing. He would never allow himself to\nregard the person of the Prime Minister. The measure before the House\never had been and ever should be all in all to him. If the public\nweal were more regarded in that House, and the quarrels of men less\nconsidered, he thought that the service of the country would be\nbetter done. He was answered by Mr. Monk, who was sitting near him,\nand who intended to support Mr. Gresham. Mr. Monk was rather happy\nin pulling his old friend, Mr. Turnbull, to pieces, expressing his\nopinion that a difference in men meant a difference in measures. The\ncharacters of men whose principles were known were guarantees for the\nmeasures they would advocate. To him,--Mr. Monk,--it was matter of\nvery great moment who was Prime Minister of England. He was always\nselfish enough to wish for a Minister with whom he himself could\nagree on the main questions of the day. As he certainly could not say\nthat he had political confidence in the present Ministry, he should\ncertainly vote against them on this occasion.\n\nIn the course of the evening Phineas found a letter addressed to\nhimself from Mr. Bonteen. It was as follows:--\n\n\n   House of Commons, April 5th, 18--.\n\n   DEAR MR. FINN,\n\n   I never accused you of dishonesty. You must have misheard\n   or misunderstood me if you thought so. I did say that you\n   had scuttled the ship;--and as you most undoubtedly did\n   scuttle it,--you and Mr. Monk between you,--I cannot\n   retract my words.\n\n   I do not want to go to any one for testimony as to your\n   merits on the occasion. I accused you of having done\n   nothing dishonourable or disgraceful. I think I said that\n   there was danger in the practice of scuttling. I think\n   so still, though I know that many fancy that those who\n   scuttle do a fine thing. I don't deny that it's fine, and\n   therefore you can have no cause of complaint against me.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   J. BONTEEN.\n\n\nHe had brought a copy of his own letter in his pocket to the House,\nand he showed the correspondence to Mr. Monk. \"I would not have\nnoticed it, had I been you,\" said he.\n\n\"You can have no idea of the offensive nature of the remark when it\nwas made.\"\n\n\"It's as offensive to me as to you, but I should not think of moving\nin such a matter. When a man annoys you, keep out of his way. It is\ngenerally the best thing you can do.\"\n\n\"If a man were to call you a liar?\"\n\n\"But men don't call each other liars. Bonteen understands the world\nmuch too well to commit himself by using any word which common\nopinion would force him to retract. He says we scuttled the ship.\nWell;--we did. Of all the political acts of my life it is the one\nof which I am most proud. The manner in which you helped me has\nentitled you to my affectionate esteem. But we did scuttle the ship.\nBefore you can quarrel with Bonteen you must be able to show that a\nmetaphorical scuttling of a ship must necessarily be a disgraceful\nact. You see how he at once retreats behind the fact that it need not\nbe so.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't answer his letter.\"\n\n\"I think not. You can do yourself no good by a correspondence in\nwhich you cannot get a hold of him. And if you did get a hold of him\nyou would injure yourself much more than him. Just drop it.\" This\nadded much to our friend's misery, and made him feel that the weight\nof it was almost more than he could bear. His enemy had got the\nbetter of him at every turn. He had now rushed into a correspondence\nas to which he would have to own by his silence that he had been\nconfuted. And yet he was sure that Mr. Bonteen had at the club\ninsulted him most unjustifiably, and that if the actual truth were\nknown, no man, certainly not Mr. Monk, would hesitate to say that\nreparation was due to him. And yet what could he do? He thought that\nhe would consult Lord Cantrip, and endeavour to get from his late\nChief some advice more palatable than that which had been tendered to\nhim by Mr. Monk.\n\nIn the meantime animosities in the House were waxing very furious;\nand, as it happened, the debate took a turn that was peculiarly\ninjurious to Phineas Finn in his present state of mind. The rumour as\nto the future promotion of Mr. Bonteen, which had been conveyed by\nLaurence Fitzgibbon to Phineas at the Universe, had, as was natural,\nspread far and wide, and had reached the ears of those who still\nsat on the Ministerial benches. Now it is quite understood among\npoliticians in this country that no man should presume that he will\nhave imposed upon him the task of forming a Ministry until he has\nbeen called upon by the Crown to undertake that great duty. Let the\nGresham or the Daubeny of the day be ever so sure that the reins of\nthe State chariot must come into his hands, he should not visibly\nprepare himself for the seat on the box till he has actually been\nsummoned to place himself there. At this moment it was alleged that\nMr. Gresham had departed from the reticence and modesty usual in\nsuch a position as his, by taking steps towards the formation of a\nCabinet, while it was as yet quite possible that he might never be\ncalled upon to form any Cabinet. Late on this Monday night, when the\nHouse was quite full, one of Mr. Daubeny's leading lieutenants, a\nSecretary of State, Sir Orlando Drought by name,--a gentleman who if\nhe had any heart in the matter must have hated this Church Bill from\nthe very bottom of his heart, and who on that account was the more\nbitter against opponents who had not ceased to throw in his teeth his\nown political tergiversation,--fell foul of Mr. Gresham as to this\nrumoured appointment to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer. The\nreader will easily imagine the things that were said. Sir Orlando\nhad heard, and had been much surprised at hearing, that a certain\nhonourable member of that House, who had long been known to them as\na tenant of the Ministerial bench, had already been appointed to a\nhigh office. He, Sir Orlando, had not been aware that the office had\nbeen vacant, or that if vacant it would have been at the disposal of\nthe right honourable gentleman; but he believed that there was no\ndoubt that the place in question, with a seat in the Cabinet, had\nbeen tendered to, and accepted by, the honourable member to whom he\nalluded. Such was the rabid haste with which the right honourable\ngentleman opposite, and his colleagues, were attempting, he would not\nsay to climb, but to rush into office, by opposing a great measure of\nReform, the wisdom of which, as was notorious to all the world, they\nthemselves did not dare to deny. Much more of the same kind was said,\nduring which Mr. Gresham pulled about his hat, shuffled his feet,\nshowed his annoyance to all the House, and at last jumped upon his\nlegs.\n\n\"If,\" said Sir Orlando Drought,--\"if the right honourable gentleman\nwishes to deny the accuracy of any statements that I have made, I\nwill give way to him for the moment, that he may do so.\"\n\n\"I deny utterly, not only the accuracy, but every detail of the\nstatement made by the right honourable gentleman opposite,\" said\nMr. Gresham, still standing and holding his hat in his hand as he\ncompleted his denial.\n\n\"Does the right honourable gentleman mean to assure me that he has\nnot selected his future Chancellor of the Exchequer?\"\n\n\"The right honourable gentleman is too acute not to be aware that we\non this side of the House may have made such selection, and that yet\nevery detail of the statement which he has been rash enough to make\nto the House may be--unfounded. The word, sir, is weak; but I would\nfain avoid the use of any words which, justifiable though they might\nbe, would offend the feelings of the House. I will explain to the\nHouse exactly what has been done.\"\n\nThen there was a great hubbub--cries of \"Order,\" \"Gresham,\" \"Spoke,\"\n\"Hear, hear,\" and the like,--during which Sir Orlando Drought and Mr.\nGresham both stood on their legs. So powerful was Mr. Gresham's voice\nthat, through it all, every word that he said was audible to the\nreporters. His opponent hardly attempted to speak, but stood relying\nupon his right. Mr. Gresham said he understood that it was the desire\nof the House that he should explain the circumstances in reference\nto the charge that had been made against him, and it would certainly\nbe for the convenience of the House that this should be done at\nthe moment. The Speaker of course ruled that Sir Orlando was in\npossession of the floor, but suggested that it might be convenient\nthat he should yield to the right honourable gentleman on the\nother side for a few minutes. Mr. Gresham, as a matter of course,\nsucceeded. Rights and rules, which are bonds of iron to a little man,\nare packthread to a giant. No one in all that assembly knew the House\nbetter than did Mr. Gresham, was better able to take it by storm, or\nmore obdurate in perseverance. He did make his speech, though clearly\nhe had no right to do so. The House, he said, was aware, that by the\nmost unfortunate demise of the late Duke of Omnium, a gentleman had\nbeen removed from this House to another place, whose absence from\ntheir counsels would long be felt as a very grievous loss. Then he\npronounced a eulogy on Plantagenet Palliser, so graceful and well\narranged, that even the bitterness of the existing opposition was\nunable to demur to it. The House was well aware of the nature of the\nlabours which now for some years past had occupied the mind of the\nnoble duke; and the paramount importance which the country attached\nto their conclusion. The noble duke no doubt was not absolutely\ndebarred from a continuance of his work by the change which had\nfallen upon him; but it was essential that some gentleman, belonging\nto the same party with the noble duke, versed in office, and having a\nseat in that House, should endeavour to devote himself to the great\nmeasure which had occupied so much of the attention of the late\nChancellor of the Exchequer. No doubt it must be fitting that the\ngentleman so selected should be at the Exchequer, in the event of\ntheir party coming into office. The honourable gentleman to whom\nallusion had been made had acted throughout with the present noble\nduke in arranging the details of the measure in question; and the\nprobability of his being able to fill the shoes left vacant by\nthe accession to the peerage of the noble duke had, indeed, been\ndiscussed;--but the discussion had been made in reference to the\nmeasure, and only incidentally in regard to the office. He, Mr.\nGresham, held that he had done nothing that was indiscreet,--nothing\nthat his duty did not demand. If right honourable gentlemen opposite\nwere of a different opinion, he thought that that difference came\nfrom the fact that they were less intimately acquainted than he\nunfortunately had been with the burdens and responsibilities of\nlegislation.\n\nThere was very little in the dispute which seemed to be worthy of\nthe place in which it occurred, or of the vigour with which it was\nconducted; but it served to show the temper of the parties, and to\nexpress the bitterness of the political feelings of the day. It was\nsaid at the time, that never within the memory of living politicians\nhad so violent an animosity displayed itself in the House as had\nbeen witnessed on this night. While Mr. Gresham was giving his\nexplanation, Mr. Daubeny had arisen, and with a mock solemnity that\nwas peculiar to him on occasions such as these, had appealed to the\nSpeaker whether the right honourable gentleman opposite should not be\ncalled upon to resume his seat. Mr. Gresham had put him down with a\nwave of his hand. An affected stateliness cannot support itself but\nfor a moment; and Mr. Daubeny had been forced to sit down when the\nSpeaker did not at once support his appeal. But he did not forget\nthat wave of the hand, nor did he forgive it. He was a man who in\npublic life rarely forgot, and never forgave. They used to say\nof him that \"at home\" he was kindly and forbearing, simple and\nunostentatious. It may be so. Who does not remember that horrible\nTurk, Jacob Asdrubal, the Old Bailey barrister, the terror of\nwitnesses, the bane of judges,--who was gall and wormwood to all\nopponents. It was said of him that \"at home\" his docile amiability\nwas the marvel of his friends, and delight of his wife and daughters.\n\"At home,\" perhaps, Mr. Daubeny might have been waved at, and have\nforgiven it; but men who saw the scene in the House of Commons knew\nthat he would never forgive Mr. Gresham. As for Mr. Gresham himself,\nhe triumphed at the moment, and exulted in his triumph.\n\nPhineas Finn heard it all, and was disgusted to find that his enemy\nthus became the hero of the hour. It was, indeed, the opinion\ngenerally of the Liberal party that Mr. Gresham had not said much to\nflatter his new Chancellor of the Exchequer. In praise of Plantagenet\nPalliser he had been very loud, and he had no doubt said that which\nimplied the capability of Mr. Bonteen, who, as it happened, was\nsitting next to him at the time; but he had implied also that the\nmantle which was to be transferred from Mr. Palliser to Mr. Bonteen\nwould be carried by its new wearer with grace very inferior to that\nwhich had marked all the steps of his predecessor. Ratler, and\nErle, and Fitzgibbon, and others had laughed in their sleeves at\nthe expression, understood by them, of Mr. Gresham's doubt as to\nthe qualifications of his new assistant, and Sir Orlando Drought,\nin continuing his speech, remarked that the warmth of the right\nhonourable gentleman had been so completely expended in abusing his\nenemies that he had had none left for the defence of his friend.\nBut to Phineas it seemed that this Bonteen, who had so grievously\ninjured him, and whom he so thoroughly despised, was carrying off\nall the glories of the fight. A certain amount of consolation was,\nhowever, afforded to him. Between one and two o'clock he was told\nby Mr. Ratler that he might enjoy the privilege of adjourning the\ndebate,--by which would accrue to him the right of commencing on the\nmorrow,--and this he did at a few minutes before three.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nSEVENTY-TWO.\n\n\nOn the next morning Phineas, with his speech before him, was obliged\nfor a while to forget, or at least to postpone, Mr. Bonteen and his\ninjuries. He could not now go to Lord Cantrip, as the hours were\ntoo precious to him, and, as he felt, too short. Though he had been\nthinking what he would say ever since the debate had become imminent,\nand knew accurately the line which he would take, he had not as yet\nprepared a word of his speech. But he had resolved that he would\nnot prepare a word otherwise than he might do by arranging certain\nphrases in his memory. There should be nothing written; he had tried\nthat before in old days, and had broken down with the effort. He\nwould load himself with no burden of words in itself so heavy that\nthe carrying of it would incapacitate him for any other effort.\n\nAfter a late breakfast he walked out far away, into the Regent's\nPark, and there, wandering among the uninteresting paths, he devised\ntriumphs of oratory for himself. Let him resolve as he would to\nforget Mr. Bonteen, and that charge of having been untrue to his\ncompanions, he could not restrain himself from efforts to fit the\nmatter after some fashion into his speech. Dim ideas of a definition\nof political honesty crossed his brain, bringing with him, however,\na conviction that his thought must be much more clearly worked out\nthan it could be on that day before he might venture to give it birth\nin the House of Commons. He knew that he had been honest two years\nago in separating himself from his colleagues. He knew that he would\nbe honest now in voting with them, apparently in opposition to the\npledges he had given at Tankerville. But he knew also that it would\nbehove him to abstain from speaking of himself unless he could do so\nin close reference to some point specially in dispute between the two\nparties. When he returned to eat a mutton chop at Great Marlborough\nStreet at three o'clock he was painfully conscious that all his\nmorning had been wasted. He had allowed his mind to run revel,\ninstead of tying it down to the formation of sentences and\nconstruction of arguments.\n\nHe entered the House with the Speaker at four o'clock, and took his\nseat without uttering a word to any man. He seemed to be more than\never disjoined from his party. Hitherto, since he had been seated\nby the Judge's order, the former companions of his Parliamentary\nlife,--the old men whom he had used to know,--had to a certain degree\nadmitted him among them. Many of them sat on the front Opposition\nbench, whereas he, as a matter of course, had seated himself behind.\nBut he had very frequently found himself next to some man who had\nheld office and was living in the hope of holding it again, and\nhad felt himself to be in some sort recognised as an aspirant. Now\nit seemed to him that it was otherwise. He did not doubt but that\nBonteen had shown the correspondence to his friends, and that the\nRatlers and Erles had conceded that he, Phineas, was put out of\ncourt by it. He sat doggedly still, at the end of a bench behind\nMr. Gresham, and close to the gangway. When Mr. Gresham entered the\nHouse he was received with much cheering; but Phineas did not join in\nthe cheer. He was studious to avoid any personal recognition of the\nfuture giver-away of places, though they two were close together; and\nhe then fancied that Mr. Gresham had specially and most ungraciously\nabstained from any recognition of him. Mr. Monk, who sat near him,\nspoke a kind word to him. \"I shan't be very long,\" said Phineas; \"not\nabove twenty minutes, I should think.\" He was able to assume an air\nof indifference, and yet at the moment he heartily wished himself\nback in Dublin. It was not now that he feared the task immediately\nbefore him, but that he was overcome by the feeling of general\nfailure which had come upon him. Of what use was it to him or to any\none else that he should be there in that assembly, with the privilege\nof making a speech that would influence no human being, unless his\nbeing there could be made a step to something beyond? While the usual\npreliminary work was being done, he looked round the House, and saw\nLord Cantrip in the Peers' gallery. Alas! of what avail was that? He\nhad always been able to bind to him individuals with whom he had been\nbrought into close contact; but more than that was wanted in this\nmost precarious of professions, in which now, for a second time, he\nwas attempting to earn his bread.\n\nAt half-past four he was on his legs in the midst of a crowded House.\nThe chance,--perhaps the hope,--of some such encounter as that of the\nformer day, brought members into their seats, and filled the gallery\nwith strangers. We may say, perhaps, that the highest duty imposed\nupon us as a nation is the management of India; and we may also\nsay that in a great national assembly personal squabbling among\nits members is the least dignified work in which it can employ\nitself. But the prospect of an explanation,--or otherwise of a\nfight,--between two leading politicians will fill the House; and any\nallusion to our Eastern Empire will certainly empty it. An aptitude\nfor such encounters is almost a necessary qualification for a popular\nleader in Parliament, as is a capacity for speaking for three\nhours to the reporters, and to the reporters only,--a necessary\nqualification for an Under-Secretary of State for India.\n\nPhineas had the advantage of the temper of the moment in a House\nthoroughly crowded, and he enjoyed it. Let a man doubt ever so much\nhis own capacity for some public exhibition which he has undertaken;\nyet he will always prefer to fail,--if fail he must,--before a large\naudience. But on this occasion there was no failure. That sense of\nawe from the surrounding circumstances of the moment, which had once\nbeen heavy on him, and which he still well remembered, had been\novercome, and had never returned to him. He felt now that he should\nnot lack words to pour out his own individual grievances were it not\nthat he was prevented by a sense of the indiscretion of doing so. As\nit was, he did succeed in alluding to his own condition in a manner\nthat brought upon him no reproach. He began by saying that he should\nnot have added to the difficulty of the debate,--which was one simply\nof length,--were it not that he had been accused in advance of voting\nagainst a measure as to which he had pledged himself at the hustings\nto do all that he could to further it. No man was more anxious than\nhe, an Irish Roman Catholic, to abolish that which he thought to be\nthe anomaly of a State Church, and he did not in the least doubt that\nhe should now be doing the best in his power with that object in\nvoting against the second reading of the present bill. That such a\nmeasure should be carried by the gentlemen opposite, in their own\nteeth, at the bidding of the right honourable gentleman who led\nthem, he thought to be impossible. Upon this he was hooted at from\nthe other side with many gestures of indignant denial, and was, of\ncourse, equally cheered by those around him. Such interruptions are\nnew breath to the nostrils of all orators, and Phineas enjoyed the\nnoise. He repeated his assertion that it would be an evil thing for\nthe country that the measure should be carried by men who in their\nhearts condemned it, and was vehemently called to order for this\nassertion about the hearts of gentlemen. But a speaker who can\ncertainly be made amenable to authority for vilipending in debate\nthe heart of any specified opponent, may with safety attribute all\nmanner of ill to the agglomerated hearts of a party. To have told any\nindividual Conservative,--Sir Orlando Drought for instance,--that\nhe was abandoning all the convictions of his life, because he was a\ncreature at the command of Mr. Daubeny, would have been an insult\nthat would have moved even the Speaker from his serenity; but you can\nhardly be personal to a whole bench of Conservatives,--to bench above\nbench of Conservatives. The charge had been made and repeated over\nand over again, till all the Orlando Droughts were ready to cut some\nman's throat,--whether their own, or Mr. Daubeny's, or Mr. Gresham's,\nthey hardly knew. It might probably have been Mr. Daubeny's for\nchoice, had any real cutting of a throat been possible. It was now\nmade again by Phineas Finn,--with the ostensible object of defending\nhimself,--and he for the moment became the target for Conservative\nwrath. Some one asked him in fury by what right he took upon himself\nto judge of the motives of gentlemen on that side of the House of\nwhom personally he knew nothing. Phineas replied that he did not\nat all doubt the motives of the honourable gentleman who asked\nthe question, which he was sure were noble and patriotic. But\nunfortunately the whole country was convinced that the Conservative\nparty as a body was supporting this measure, unwillingly, and at the\nbidding of one man;--and, for himself, he was bound to say that he\nagreed with the country. And so the row was renewed and prolonged,\nand the gentlemen assembled, members and strangers together, passed a\npleasant evening.\n\nBefore he sat down, Phineas made one allusion to that former\nscuttling of the ship,--an accusation as to which had been made\nagainst him so injuriously by Mr. Bonteen. He himself, he said, had\nbeen called impractical, and perhaps he might allude to a vote which\nhe had given in that House when last he had the honour of sitting\nthere, and on giving which he resigned the office which he had then\nheld. He had the gratification of knowing that he had been so far\npractical as to have then foreseen the necessity of a measure which\nhad since been passed. And he did not doubt that he would hereafter\nbe found to have been equally practical in the view that he had\nexpressed on the hustings at Tankerville, for he was convinced that\nbefore long the anomaly of which he had spoken would cease to exist\nunder the influence of a Government that would really believe in the\nwork it was doing.\n\nThere was no doubt as to the success of his speech. The vehemence\nwith which his insolence was abused by one after another of those who\nspoke later from the other side was ample evidence of its success.\nBut nothing occurred then or at the conclusion of the debate to make\nhim think that he had won his way back to Elysium. During the whole\nevening he exchanged not a syllable with Mr. Gresham,--who indeed\nwas not much given to converse with those around him in the House.\nErle said a few good-natured words to him, and Mr. Monk praised him\nhighly. But in reading the general barometer of the party as regarded\nhimself, he did not find that the mercury went up. He was wretchedly\nanxious, and angry with himself for his own anxiety. He scorned to\nsay a word that should sound like an entreaty; and yet he had placed\nhis whole heart on a thing which seemed to be slipping from him\nfor the want of asking. In a day or two it would be known whether\nthe present Ministry would or would not go out. That they must be\nout of office before a month was over seemed to him the opinion\nof everybody. His fate,--and what a fate it was!--would then be\nabsolutely in the hands of Mr. Gresham. Yet he could not speak a\nword of his hopes and fears even to Mr. Gresham. He had given up\neverything in the world with the view of getting into office; and now\nthat the opportunity had come,--an opportunity which if allowed to\nslip could hardly return again in time to be of service to him,--the\nprize was to elude his grasp!\n\nBut yet he did not say a word to any one on the subject that was\nso near his heart, although in the course of the night he spoke to\nLord Cantrip in the gallery of the House. He told his friend that a\ncorrespondence had taken place between himself and Mr. Bonteen, in\nwhich he thought that he had been ill-used, and as to which he was\nquite anxious to ask His Lordship's advice. \"I heard that you and he\nhad been tilting at each other,\" said Lord Cantrip, smiling.\n\n\"Have you seen the letters?\"\n\n\"No;--but I was told of them by Lord Fawn, who has seen them.\"\n\n\"I knew he would show them to every newsmonger about the clubs,\" said\nPhineas angrily.\n\n\"You can't quarrel with Bonteen for showing them to Fawn, if you\nintend to show them to me.\"\n\n\"He may publish them at Charing Cross if he likes.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I am sure that there will have been nothing in them\nprejudicial to you. What I mean is that if you think it necessary,\nwith a view to your own character, to show them to me or to another\nfriend, you cannot complain that he should do the same.\"\n\nAn appointment was made at Lord Cantrip's house for the next morning,\nand Phineas could but acknowledge to himself that the man's manner to\nhimself had been kind and constant. Nevertheless, the whole affair\nwas going against him. Lord Cantrip had not said a word prejudicial\nto that wretch Bonteen; much less had he hinted at any future\narrangements which would be comfortable to poor Phineas. They two,\nLord Cantrip and Phineas, had at one period been on most intimate\nterms together;--had worked in the same office, and had thoroughly\ntrusted each other. The elder of the two,--for Lord Cantrip was about\nten years senior to Phineas,--had frequently expressed the most\nlively interest in the prospects of the other; and Phineas had felt\nthat in any emergency he could tell his friend all his hopes and\nfears. But now he did not say a word of his position, nor did Lord\nCantrip allude to it. They were to meet on the morrow in order that\nLord Cantrip might read the correspondence;--but Phineas was sure\nthat no word would be said about the Government.\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning the division took place, and the\nGovernment was beaten by a majority of 72. This was much higher\nthan any man had expected. When the parties were marshalled in the\nopposite lobbies it was found that in the last moment the number of\nthose Conservatives who dared to rebel against their Conservative\nleaders was swelled by the course which the debate had taken. There\nwere certain men who could not endure to be twitted with having\ndeserted the principles of their lives, when it was clear that\nnothing was to be gained by the party by such desertion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nTHE CONSPIRACY.\n\n\nOn the morning following the great division Phineas was with his\nfriend, Lord Cantrip, by eleven o'clock; and Lord Cantrip, when\nhe had read the two letters in which were comprised the whole\ncorrespondence, made to our unhappy hero the following little speech.\n\"I do not think that you can do anything. Indeed, I am sure that Mr.\nMonk is quite right. I don't quite see what it is that you wish to\ndo. Privately,--between our two selves,--I do not hesitate to say\nthat Mr. Bonteen has intended to be ill-natured. I fancy that he is\nan ill-natured--or at any rate a jealous--man; and that he would be\nwilling to run down a competitor in the race who had made his running\nafter a fashion different from his own. Bonteen has been a useful\nman,--a very useful man; and the more so perhaps because he has not\nentertained any high political theory of his own. You have chosen to\ndo so,--and undoubtedly when you and Monk left us, to our very great\nregret, you did scuttle the ship.\"\n\n\"We had no intention of that kind.\"\n\n\"Do not suppose that I blame you. That which was odious to the eyes\nof Mr. Bonteen was to my thinking high and honourable conduct. I\nhave known the same thing done by members of a Government perhaps\nhalf-a-dozen times, and the men by whom it has been done have been\nthe best and noblest of our modern statesmen. There has generally\nbeen a hard contest in the man's breast between loyalty to his\nparty and strong personal convictions, the result of which has been\nan inability on the part of the struggler to give even a silent\nsupport to a measure which he has disapproved. That inability is no\ndoubt troublesome at the time to the colleagues of the seceder, and\nconstitutes an offence hardly to be pardoned by such gentlemen as Mr.\nBonteen.\"\n\n\"For Mr. Bonteen personally I care nothing.\"\n\n\"But of course you must endure the ill-effects of his influence,--be\nthey what they may. When you seceded from our Government you looked\nfor certain adverse consequences. If you did not, where was your\nself-sacrifice? That such men as Mr. Bonteen should feel that you had\nscuttled the ship, and be unable to forgive you for doing so,--that\nis exactly the evil which you knew you must face. You have to\nface it now, and surely you can do so without showing your teeth.\nHereafter, when men more thoughtful than Mr. Bonteen shall have come\nto acknowledge the high principle by which your conduct has been\ngoverned, you will receive your reward. I suppose Mr. Daubeny must\nresign now.\"\n\n\"Everybody says so.\"\n\n\"I am by no means sure that he will. Any other Minister since Lord\nNorth's time would have done so, with such a majority against him on\na vital measure; but he is a man who delights in striking out some\nwonderful course for himself.\"\n\n\"A prime minister so beaten surely can't go on.\"\n\n\"Not for long, one would think. And yet how are you to turn him out?\nIt depends very much on a man's power of endurance.\"\n\n\"His colleagues will resign, I should think.\"\n\n\"Probably;--and then he must go. I should say that that will be the\nway in which the matter will settle itself. Good morning, Finn;--and\ntake my word for it, you had better not answer Mr. Bonteen's letter.\"\n\nNot a word had fallen from Lord Cantrip's friendly lips as to the\nprobability of Phineas being invited to join the future Government.\nAn attempt had been made to console him with the hazy promise of\nsome future reward,--which however was to consist rather of the good\nopinion of good men than of anything tangible and useful. But even\nthis would never come to him. What would good men know of him and of\nhis self-sacrifice when he should have been driven out of the world\nby poverty, and forced probably to go to some New Zealand or back\nCanadian settlement to look for his bread? How easy, thought Phineas,\nmust be the sacrifices of rich men, who can stay their time, and\nwait in perfect security for their rewards! But for such a one as he,\ntruth to a principle was political annihilation. Two or three years\nago he had done what he knew to be a noble thing;--and now, because\nhe had done that noble thing, he was to be regarded as unfit for that\nvery employment for which he was peculiarly fitted. But Bonteen and\nCo. had not been his only enemies. His luck had been against him\nthroughout. Mr. Quintus Slide, with his People's Banner, and the\nstory of that wretched affair in Judd Street, had been as strong\nagainst him probably as Mr. Bonteen's ill-word. Then he thought of\nLady Laura, and her love for him. His gratitude to Lady Laura was\nboundless. There was nothing he would not do for Lady Laura,--were it\nin his power to do anything. But no circumstance in his career had\nbeen so unfortunate for him as this affection. A wretched charge had\nbeen made against him which, though wholly untrue, was as it were\nso strangely connected with the truth, that slanderers might not\nimprobably be able almost to substantiate their calumnies. She would\nbe in London soon, and he must devote himself to her service. But\nevery act of friendship that he might do for her would be used as\nproof of the accusation that had been made against him. As he thought\nof all this he was walking towards Park Lane in order that he might\ncall upon Madame Goesler according to his promise. As he went up to\nthe drawing-room he met old Mr. Maule coming down, and the two bowed\nto each other on the stairs. In the drawing-room, sitting with Madame\nGoesler, he found Mrs. Bonteen. Now Mrs. Bonteen was almost as odious\nto him as was her husband.\n\n\"Did you ever know anything more shameful, Mr. Finn,\" said Mrs.\nBonteen, \"than the attack made upon Mr. Bonteen the night before\nlast?\" Phineas could see a smile on Madame Goesler's face as the\nquestion was asked;--for she knew, and he knew that she knew, how\ngreat was the antipathy between him and the Bonteens.\n\n\"The attack was upon Mr. Gresham, I thought,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Oh, yes; nominally. But of course everybody knows what was meant.\nUpon my word there is twice more jealousy among men than among women.\nIs there not, Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"I don't think any man could be more jealous than I am myself,\" said\nMadame Goesler.\n\n\"Then you're fit to be a member of a Government, that's all. I don't\nsuppose that there is a man in England has worked harder for his\nparty than Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Or made himself more useful in Parliament. As for work, only that\nhis constitution is so strong, he would have killed himself.\"\n\n\"He should take Thorley's mixture,--twice a day,\" said Madame\nGoesler.\n\n\"Take!--he never has time to take anything. He breakfasts in his\ndressing-room, carries his lunch in his pocket, and dines with the\ndivision bell ringing him up between his fish and his mutton chop.\nNow he has got their decimal coinage in hand, and has not a moment to\nhimself, even on Sundays!\"\n\n\"He'll be sure to go to Heaven for it,--that's one comfort.\"\n\n\"And because they are absolutely obliged to make him Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer,--just as if he had not earned it,--everybody is so\njealous that they are ready to tear him to pieces!\"\n\n\"Who is everybody?\" asked Phineas.\n\n\"Oh! I know. It wasn't only Sir Orlando Drought. Who told Sir\nOrlando? Never mind, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I don't in the least, Mrs. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"I should have thought you would have been so triumphant,\" said\nMadame Goesler.\n\n\"Not in the least, Madame Goesler. Why should I be triumphant? Of\ncourse the position is very high,--very high indeed. But it's no more\nthan what I have always expected. If a man give up his life to a\npursuit he ought to succeed. As for ambition, I have less of it than\nany woman. Only I do hate jealousy, Mr. Finn.\" Then Mrs. Bonteen took\nher leave, kissing her dear friend, Madame Goesler, and simply bowing\nto Phineas.\n\n\"What a detestable woman!\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I know of old that you don't love her.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that you love her a bit better than I do, and yet\nyou kiss her.\"\n\n\"Hardly that, Mr. Finn. There has come up a fashion for ladies to\npretend to be very loving, and so they put their faces together. Two\nhundred years ago ladies and gentlemen did the same thing with just\nas little regard for each other. Fashions change, you know.\"\n\n\"That was a change for the worse, certainly, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"It wasn't of my doing. So you've had a great victory.\"\n\n\"Yes;--greater than we expected.\"\n\n\"According to Mrs. Bonteen, the chief result to the country will be\nthat the taxes will be so very safe in her husband's hands! I am sure\nshe believes that all Parliament has been at work in order that he\nmight be made a Cabinet Minister. I rather like her for it.\"\n\n\"I don't like her, or her husband.\"\n\n\"I do like a woman that can thoroughly enjoy her husband's success.\nWhen she is talking of his carrying about his food in his pocket she\nis completely happy. I don't think Lady Glencora ever cared in the\nleast about her husband being Chancellor of the Exchequer.\"\n\n\"Because it added nothing to her own standing.\"\n\n\"That's very ill-natured, Mr. Finn; and I find that you are becoming\ngenerally ill-natured. You used to be the best-humoured of men.\"\n\n\"I hadn't so much to try my temper as I have now, and then you\nmust remember, Madame Goesler, that I regard these people as being\nespecially my enemies.\"\n\n\"Lady Glencora was never your enemy.\"\n\n\"Nor my friend,--especially.\"\n\n\"Then you wrong her. If I tell you something you must be discreet.\"\n\n\"Am I not always discreet?\"\n\n\"She does not love Mr. Bonteen. She has had too much of him at\nMatching. And as for his wife, she is quite as unwilling to be kissed\nby her as you can be. Her Grace is determined to fight your battle\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I want her to do nothing of the kind, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"You will know nothing about it. We have put our heads to work, and\nMr. Palliser,--that is, the new Duke,--is to be made to tell Mr.\nGresham that you are to have a place. It is no good you being angry,\nfor the thing is done. If you have enemies behind your back, you must\nhave friends behind your back also. Lady Cantrip is to do the same\nthing.\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, not.\"\n\n\"It's all arranged. You'll be called the ladies' pet, but you mustn't\nmind that. Lady Laura will be here before it's arranged, and she will\nget hold of Mr. Erle.\"\n\n\"You are laughing at me, I know.\"\n\n\"Let them laugh that win. We thought of besieging Lord Fawn through\nLady Chiltern, but we are not sure that anybody cares for Lord\nFawn. The man we specially want now is the other Duke. We're afraid\nof attacking him through the Duchess because we think that he is\ninhumanly indifferent to anything that his wife says to him.\"\n\n\"If that kind of thing is done I shall not accept place even if it\nis offered me.\"\n\n\"Why not? Are you going to let a man like Mr. Bonteen bowl you over?\nDid you ever know Lady Glen fail in anything that she attempted?\nShe is preparing a secret with the express object of making Mr.\nRatler her confidant. Lord Mount Thistle is her slave, but then I\nfear Lord Mount Thistle is not of much use. She'll do anything and\neverything,--except flatter Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid that anybody should do that for my sake.\"\n\n\"The truth is that he made himself so disagreeable at Matching that\nLady Glen is broken-hearted at finding that he is to seem to owe his\npromotion to her husband's favour. Now you know all about it.\"\n\n\"You have been very wrong to tell me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have, Mr. Finn. But I thought it better that you should\nknow that you have friends at work for you. We believe,--or rather,\nthe Duchess believes,--that falsehoods have been used which are as\ndisparaging to Lady Laura Kennedy as they are injurious to you, and\nshe is determined to put it right. Some one has told Mr. Gresham that\nyou have been the means of breaking the hearts both of Lord Brentford\nand Mr. Kennedy,--two members of the late Cabinet,--and he must be\nmade to understand that this is untrue. If only for Lady Laura's sake\nyou must submit.\"\n\n\"Lord Brentford and I are the best friends in the world.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Kennedy is a madman,--absolutely in custody of his friends,\nas everybody knows; and yet the story has been made to work.\"\n\n\"And you do not feel that all this is derogatory to me?\"\n\nMadame Goesler was silent for a moment, and then she answered boldly,\n\"Not a whit. Why should it be derogatory? It is not done with\nthe object of obtaining an improper appointment on behalf of an\nunimportant man. When falsehoods of that kind are told you can't meet\nthem in a straightforward way. I suppose I know with fair accuracy\nthe sort of connection there has been between you and Lady Laura.\"\nPhineas very much doubted whether she had any such knowledge; but he\nsaid nothing, though the lady paused a few moments for reply. \"You\ncan't go and tell Mr. Gresham all that; nor can any friend do so on\nyour behalf. It would be absurd.\"\n\n\"Most absurd.\"\n\n\"And yet it is essential to your interests that he should know it.\nWhen your enemies are undermining you, you must countermine or you'll\nbe blown up.\"\n\n\"I'd rather fight above ground.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, but your enemies won't stay above ground.\nIs that newspaper man above ground? And for a little job of clever\nmining, believe me, that there is not a better engineer going than\nLady Glen;--not but what I've known her to be very nearly 'hoist with\nher own petard,'\"--added Madame Goesler, as she remembered a certain\ncircumstance in their joint lives.\n\nAll that Madame Goesler said was true. A conspiracy had been formed,\nin the first place at the instance of Madame Goesler, but altogether\nby the influence of the young Duchess, for forcing upon the future\nPremier the necessity of admitting Phineas Finn into his Government.\nOn the Wednesday following the conclusion of the debate,--the day on\nthe morning of which the division was to take place,--there was no\nHouse. On the Thursday, the last day on which the House was to sit\nbefore the Easter holidays, Mr. Daubeny announced his intention\nof postponing the declaration of his intentions till after the\nadjournment. The House would meet, he said, on that day week, and\nthen he would make his official statement. This communication he made\nvery curtly, and in a manner that was thought by some to be almost\ninsolent to the House. It was known that he had been grievously\ndisappointed by the result of the debate,--not probably having\nexpected a majority since his adversary's strategy had been declared,\nbut always hoping that the deserters from his own standard would be\nvery few. The deserters had been very many, and Mr. Daubeny was\nmajestic in his wrath.\n\nNothing, however, could be done till after Easter. The Ratlers of\nthe Liberal party were very angry at the delay, declaring that it\nwould have been much to the advantage of the country at large that\nthe vacation week should have been used for constructing a Liberal\nCabinet. This work of construction always takes time, and delays the\nbusiness of the country. No one can have known better than did Mr.\nDaubeny how great was the injury of delay, and how advantageously the\nshort holiday might have been used. With a majority of seventy-two\nagainst him, there could be no reason why he should not have at once\nresigned, and advised the Queen to send for Mr. Gresham. Nothing\ncould be worse than his conduct. So said the Liberals, thirsting\nfor office. Mr. Gresham himself did not open his mouth when the\nannouncement was made;--nor did any man, marked for future office,\nrise to denounce the beaten statesman. But one or two independent\nMembers expressed their great regret at the unnecessary delay which\nwas to take place before they were informed who was to be the\nMinister of the Crown. But Mr. Daubeny, as soon as he had made his\nstatement, stalked out of the House, and no reply whatever was made\nto the independent Members. Some few sublime and hot-headed gentlemen\nmuttered the word \"impeachment.\" Others, who were more practical and\nless dignified, suggested that the Prime Minister \"ought to have his\nhead punched.\"\n\nIt thus happened that all the world went out of town that week,--so\nthat the Duchess of Omnium was down at Matching when Phineas called\nat the Duke's house in Carlton Terrace on Friday. With what object he\nhad called he hardly knew himself; but he thought that he intended to\nassure the Duchess that he was not a candidate for office, and that\nhe must deprecate her interference. Luckily,--or unluckily,--he did\nnot see her, and he felt that it would be impossible to convey his\nwishes in a letter. The whole subject was one which would have defied\nhim to find words sufficiently discreet for his object.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of St. Bungay were at Matching for the\nEaster,--as also was Barrington Erle, and also that dreadful Mr.\nBonteen, from whose presence the poor Duchess of Omnium could in\nthese days never altogether deliver herself. \"Duke,\" she said, \"you\nknow Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It was not very long ago that I was talking to him.\"\n\n\"He used to be in office, you remember.\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--and a very good beginner he was. Is he a friend of Your\nGrace's?\"\n\n\"A great friend. I'll tell you what I want you to do. You must have\nsome place found for him.\"\n\n\"My dear Duchess, I never interfere.\"\n\n\"Why, Duke, you've made more Cabinets than any man living.\"\n\n\"I fear, indeed, that I have been at the construction of more\nGovernments than most men. It's forty years ago since Lord Melbourne\nfirst did me the honour of consulting me. When asked for advice, my\ndear, I have very often given it. It has occasionally been my duty to\nsay that I could not myself give my slender assistance to a Ministry\nunless I were supported by the presence of this or that political\nfriend. But never in my life have I asked for an appointment as a\npersonal favour; and I am sure you won't be angry with me if I say\nthat I cannot begin to do so now.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Finn ought to be there. He did so well before.\"\n\n\"If so, let us presume that he will be there. I can only say, from\nwhat little I know of him, that I shall be happy to see him in any\noffice to which the future Prime Minister may consider it to be\nhis duty to appoint him.\" \"To think,\" said the Duchess of Omnium\nafterwards to her friend Madame Goesler,--\"to think that I should\nhave had that stupid old woman a week in the house, and all for\nnothing!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Duchess,\" said Barrington Erle, \"I don't know why it\nis, but Gresham seems to have taken a dislike to him.\"\n\n\"It's Bonteen's doing.\"\n\n\"Very probably.\"\n\n\"Surely you can get the better of that?\"\n\n\"I look upon Phineas Finn, Duchess, almost as a child of my own. He\nhas come back to Parliament altogether at my instigation.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to help him.\"\n\n\"And so I would if I could. Remember I am not the man I used to be\nwhen dear old Mr. Mildmay reigned. The truth is, I never interfere\nnow unless I'm asked.\"\n\n\"I believe that every one of you is afraid of Mr. Gresham.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we are.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what. If he's passed over I'll make such a row that\nsome of you shall hear it.\"\n\n\"How fond all you women are of Phineas Finn.\"\n\n\"I don't care that for him,\" said the Duchess, snapping her\nfingers--\"more than I do, that is, for any other mere acquaintance.\nThe man is very well, as most men are.\"\n\n\"Not all.\"\n\n\"No, not all. Some are as little and jealous as a girl in her tenth\nseason. He is a decently good fellow, and he is to be thrown over,\nbecause--\"\n\n\"Because of what?\"\n\n\"I don't choose to name any one. You ought to know all about it, and\nI do not doubt but you do. Lady Laura Kennedy is your own cousin.\"\n\n\"There is not a spark of truth in all that.\"\n\n\"Of course there is not; and yet he is to be punished. I know very\nwell, Mr. Erle, that if you choose to put your shoulder to the wheel\nyou can manage it; and I shall expect to have it managed.\"\n\n\"Plantagenet,\" she said the next day to her husband, \"I want you to\ndo something for me.\"\n\n\"To do something! What am I to do? It's very seldom you want anything\nin my line.\"\n\n\"This isn't in your line at all, and yet I want you to do it.\"\n\n\"Ten to one it's beyond my means.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't. I know you can if you like. I suppose you are all sure\nto be in office within ten days or a fortnight?\"\n\n\"I can't say, my dear. I have promised Mr. Gresham to be of use to\nhim if I can.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows all that. You're going to be Privy Seal, and to work\njust the same as ever at those horrible two farthings.\"\n\n\"And what is it you want, Glencora?\"\n\n\"I want you to say that you won't take any office unless you are\nallowed to bring in one or two friends with you.\"\n\n\"Why should I do that? I shall not doubt any Cabinet chosen by Mr.\nGresham.\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking of the Cabinet; I allude to men in lower offices,\nlords, and Under-Secretaries, and Vice-people. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I never interfere.\"\n\n\"But you must. Other men do continually. It's quite a common thing\nfor a man to insist that one or two others should come in with him.\"\n\n\"Yes. If a man feels that he cannot sustain his own position without\nsupport, he declines to join the Government without it. But that\nisn't my case. The friends who are necessary to me in the Cabinet are\nthe very men who will certainly be there. I would join no Government\nwithout the Duke; but--\"\n\n\"Oh, the Duke--the Duke! I hate dukes--and duchesses too. I'm not\ntalking about a duke. I want you to oblige me by making a point with\nMr. Gresham that Mr. Finn shall have an office.\"\n\n\"Mr. Finn!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Finn. I'll explain it all if you wish it.\"\n\n\"My dear Glencora, I never interfere.\"\n\n\"Who does interfere? Everybody says the same. Somebody interferes,\nI suppose. Mr. Gresham can't know everybody so well as to be able\nto fit all the pegs into all the holes without saying a word to\nanybody.\"\n\n\"He would probably speak to Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"Then he would speak to a very disagreeable man, and one I'm as sick\nof as I ever was of any man I ever knew. If you can't manage this for\nme, Plantagenet, I shall take it very ill. It's a little thing, and\nI'm sure you could have it done. I don't very often trouble you by\nasking for anything.\"\n\nThe Duke in his quiet way was an affectionate man, and an indulgent\nhusband. On the following morning he was closeted with Mr. Bonteen,\ntwo private secretaries, and a leading clerk from the Treasury for\nfour hours, during which they were endeavouring to ascertain whether\nthe commercial world of Great Britain would be ruined or enriched\nif twelve pennies were declared to contain fifty farthings. The\ndiscussion had been grievously burdensome to the minds of the Duke's\nassistants in it, but he himself had remembered his wife through it\nall. \"By the way,\" he said, whispering into Mr. Bonteen's private ear\nas he led that gentleman away to lunch, \"if we do come in--\"\n\n\"Oh, we must come in.\"\n\n\"If we do, I suppose something will be done for that Mr. Finn. He\nspoke well the other night.\"\n\nMr. Bonteen's face became very long. \"He helped to upset the coach\nwhen he was with us before.\"\n\n\"I don't think that that is much against him.\"\n\n\"Is he--a personal friend of Your Grace's?\"\n\n\"No--not particularly. I never care about such things for myself; but\nLady Glencora--\"\n\n\"I think the Duchess can hardly know what has been his conduct to\npoor Kennedy. There was a most disreputable row at a public-house in\nLondon, and I am told that he behaved--very badly.\"\n\n\"I never heard a word about it,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"I'll tell you just the truth,\" said Mr. Bonteen. \"I've been asked\nabout him, and I've been obliged to say that he would weaken any\nGovernment that would give him office.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\"\n\nThat evening the Duke told the Duchess nearly all that he had heard,\nand the Duchess swore that she wasn't going to be beaten by Mr.\nBonteen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nONCE AGAIN IN PORTMAN SQUARE.\n\n\nOn the Wednesday in Easter week Lord Brentford and Lady Laura Kennedy\nreached Portman Square from Dresden, and Phineas, who had remained in\ntown, was summoned thither by a note written at Dover. \"We arrived\nhere to-day, and shall be in town to-morrow afternoon, between four\nand five. Papa wants to see you especially. Can you manage to be with\nus in the Square at about eight? I know it will be inconvenient, but\nyou will put up with inconvenience. I don't like to keep Papa up\nlate; and if he is tired he won't speak to you as he would if you\ncame early.--L. K.\" Phineas was engaged to dine with Lord Cantrip;\nbut he wrote to excuse himself,--telling the simple truth. He had\nbeen asked to see Lord Brentford on business, and must obey the\nsummons.\n\nHe was shown into a sitting-room on the ground floor, which he\nhad always known as the Earl's own room, and there he found Lord\nBrentford alone. The last time he had been there he had come to\nplead with the Earl on behalf of Lord Chiltern, and the Earl had then\nbeen a stern self-willed man, vigorous from a sense of power, and\nvery able to maintain and to express his own feelings. Now he was a\nbroken-down old man,--whose mind had been, as it were, unbooted and\nput into moral slippers for the remainder of its term of existence\nupon earth. He half shuffled up out of his chair as Phineas came\nup to him, and spoke as though every calamity in the world were\noppressing him. \"Such a passage! Oh, very bad, indeed! I thought it\nwould have been the death of me. Laura thought it better to come on.\"\nThe fact, however, had been that the Earl had so many objections to\nstaying at Calais, that his daughter had felt herself obliged to\nyield to him.\n\n\"You must be glad at any rate to have got home,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Home! I don't know what you call home. I don't suppose I shall ever\nfeel any place to be home again.\"\n\n\"You'll go to Saulsby;--will you not?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? If Chiltern would have kept the house up, of course\nI should have gone there. But he never would do anything like anybody\nelse. Violet wants me to go to that place they've got there, but I\nshan't do that.\"\n\n\"It's a comfortable house.\"\n\n\"I hate horses and dogs, and I won't go.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be said on that point. \"I hope Lady Laura\nis well.\"\n\n\"No, she's not. How should she be well? She's anything but well.\nShe'll be in directly, but she thought I ought to see you first. I\nsuppose this wretched man is really mad.\"\n\n\"I am told so.\"\n\n\"He never was anything else since I knew him. What are we to do now?\nForster says it won't look well to ask for a separation only because\nhe's insane. He tried to shoot you?\"\n\n\"And very nearly succeeded.\"\n\n\"Forster says that if we do anything, all that must come out.\"\n\n\"There need not be the slightest hesitation as far as I am concerned,\nLord Brentford.\"\n\n\"You know he keeps all her money.\"\n\n\"At present I suppose he couldn't give it up.\"\n\n\"Why not? Why shouldn't he give it up? God bless my soul! Forty\nthousand pounds and all for nothing. When he married he declared that\nhe didn't care about it! Money was nothing to him! So she lent it to\nChiltern.\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"But they hadn't been together a year before he asked for it. Now\nthere it is;--and if she were to die to-morrow it would be lost to\nthe family. Something must be done, you know. I can't let her money\ngo in that way.\"\n\n\"You'll do what Mr. Forster suggests, no doubt.\"\n\n\"But he won't suggest anything. They never do. He doesn't care what\nbecomes of the money. It never ought to have been given up as it\nwas.\"\n\n\"It was settled, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes;--if there were children. And it will come back to her if he\ndies first. But mad people never do die. That's a well-known fact.\nThey've nothing to trouble them, and they live for ever. It'll all go\nto some cousin of his that nobody ever saw.\"\n\n\"Not as long as Lady Laura lives.\"\n\n\"But she does not get a penny of the income;--not a penny. There\nnever was anything so cruel. He has published all manner of\naccusations against her.\"\n\n\"Nobody believes a word of that, my lord.\"\n\n\"And then when she is dragged forward by the necessity of vindicating\nher character, he goes mad and keeps all her money! There never was\nanything so cruel since the world began.\"\n\nThis continued for half-an-hour, and then Lady Laura came in. Nothing\nhad come, or could have come, from the consultation with the Earl.\nHad it gone on for another hour, he would simply have continued\nto grumble, and have persevered in insisting upon the hardships\nhe endured. Lady Laura was in black, and looked sad, and old, and\ncareworn; but she did not seem to be ill. Phineas could not but think\nat the moment how entirely her youth had passed away from her. She\ncame and sat close by him, and began at once to speak of the late\ndebate. \"Of course they'll go out,\" she said.\n\n\"I presume they will.\"\n\n\"And our party will come in.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--Mr. Gresham, and the two dukes, and Lord Cantrip,--with\nLegge Wilson, Sir Harry Coldfoot, and the rest of them.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\nPhineas smiled, and tried to smile pleasantly, as he answered, \"I\ndon't know that they'll put themselves out by doing very much for\nme.\"\n\n\"They'll do something.\"\n\n\"I fancy not. Indeed, Lady Laura, to tell the truth at once, I know\nthat they don't mean to offer me anything.\"\n\n\"After making you give up your place in Ireland?\"\n\n\"They didn't make me give it up. I should never dream of using such\nan argument to any one. Of course I had to judge for myself. There is\nnothing to be said about it;--only it is so.\" As he told her this he\nstrove to look light-hearted, and so to speak that she should not see\nthe depth of his disappointment;--but he failed altogether. She knew\nhim too well not to read his whole heart in the matter.\n\n\"Who has said it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nobody says things of that kind, and yet one knows.\"\n\n\"And why is it?\"\n\n\"How can I say? There are various reasons,--and, perhaps, very good\nreasons. What I did before makes men think that they can't depend on\nme. At any rate it is so.\"\n\n\"Shall you not speak to Mr. Gresham?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Papa?\"\n\n\"How can I understand it, my dear? There used to be a kind of honour\nin these things, but that's all old-fashioned now. Ministers used to\nthink of their political friends; but in these days they only regard\ntheir political enemies. If you can make a Minister afraid of you,\nthen it becomes worth his while to buy you up. Most of the young\nmen rise now by making themselves thoroughly disagreeable. Abuse a\nMinister every night for half a session, and you may be sure to be in\noffice the other half,--if you care about it.\"\n\n\"May I speak to Barrington Erle?\" asked Lady Laura.\n\n\"I had rather you did not. Of course I must take it as it comes.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Mr. Finn, people do make efforts in such cases. I don't\ndoubt but that at this moment there are a dozen men moving heaven and\nearth to secure something. No one has more friends than you have.\"\n\nHad not her father been present he would have told her what his\nfriends were doing for him, and how unhappy such interferences made\nhim; but he could not explain all this before the Earl. \"I would so\nmuch rather hear about yourself,\" he said, again smiling.\n\n\"There is but little to say about us. I suppose Papa has told you?\"\n\nBut the Earl had told him nothing, and indeed, there was nothing\nto tell. The lawyer had advised that Mr. Kennedy's friends should\nbe informed that Lady Laura now intended to live in England, and\nthat they should be invited to make to her some statement as to\nMr. Kennedy's condition. If necessary he, on her behalf, would\njustify her departure from her husband's roof by a reference to the\noutrageous conduct of which Mr. Kennedy had since been guilty. In\nregard to Lady Laura's fortune, Mr. Forster said that she could no\ndoubt apply for alimony, and that if the application were pressed at\nlaw she would probably obtain it;--but he could not recommend such a\nstep at the present moment. As to the accusation which had been made\nagainst her character, and which had become public through the malice\nof the editor of The People's Banner, Mr. Forster thought that the\nbest refutation would be found in her return to England. At any\nrate he would advise no further step at the present moment. Should\nany further libel appear in the columns of the newspaper, then the\nquestion might be again considered. Mr. Forster had already been in\nPortman Square, and this had been the result of the conference.\n\n\"There is not much comfort in it all,--is there?\" said Lady Laura.\n\n\"There is no comfort in anything,\" said the Earl.\n\nWhen Phineas took his leave Lady Laura followed him out into\nthe hall, and they went together into the large, gloomy\ndining-room,--gloomy and silent now, but which in former days he\nhad known to be brilliant with many lights, and cheerful with eager\nvoices. \"I must have one word with you,\" she said, standing close\nto him against the table, and putting her hand upon his arm. \"Amidst\nall my sorrow, I have been so thankful that he did not--kill you.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"I must have one word with you.\"]\n\n\n\"I almost wish he had.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phineas!--how can you say words so wicked! Would you have had\nhim a murderer?\"\n\n\"A madman is responsible for nothing.\"\n\n\"Where should I have been? What should I have done? But of course you\ndo not mean it. You have everything in life before you. Say some word\nto me more comfortable than that. You cannot think how I have looked\nforward to meeting you again. It has robbed the last month of half\nits sadness.\" He put his arm round her waist and pressed her to his\nside, but he said nothing. \"It was so good of you to go to him as you\ndid. How was he looking?\"\n\n\"Twenty years older than when you saw him last.\"\n\n\"But how in health?\"\n\n\"He was thin and haggard.\"\n\n\"Was he pale?\"\n\n\"No; flushed and red. He had not shaved himself for days; nor, as I\nbelieve, had he been out of his room since he came up to London. I\nfancy that he will not live long.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow;--unhappy man! I was very wrong to marry him, Phineas.\"\n\n\"I have never said so;--nor, indeed, thought so.\"\n\n\"But I have thought so; and I say it also,--to you. I owe him any\nreparation that I can make him; but I could not have lived with him.\nI had no idea, before, that the nature of two human beings could be\nso unlike. I so often remember what you told me of him,--here; in\nthis house, when I first brought you together. Alas, how sad it has\nbeen!\"\n\n\"Sad, indeed.\"\n\n\"But can this be true that you tell me of yourself?\n\n\"It is quite true. I could not say so before your father, but it is\nMr. Bonteen's doing. There is no remedy. I am sure of that. I am only\nafraid that people are interfering for me in a manner that will be as\ndisagreeable to me as it will be useless.\"\n\n\"What friends?\" she asked.\n\nHe was still standing with his arm round her waist, and he did not\nlike to mention the name of Madame Goesler.\n\n\"The Duchess of Omnium,--whom you remember as Lady Glencora\nPalliser.\"\n\n\"Is she a friend of yours?\"\n\n\"No;--not particularly. But she is an indiscreet woman, and hates\nBonteen, and has taken it into her stupid head to interest herself in\nmy concerns. It is no doing of mine, and yet I cannot help it.\"\n\n\"She will succeed.\"\n\n\"I don't want assistance from such a quarter; and I feel sure that\nshe will not succeed.\"\n\n\"What will you do, Phineas?\"\n\n\"What shall I do? Carry on the battle as long as I can without\ngetting into debt, and then--vanish.\"\n\n\"You vanished once before,--did you not,--with a wife?\"\n\n\"And now I shall vanish alone. My poor little wife! It seems all like\na dream. She was so good, so pure, so pretty, so loving!\"\n\n\"Loving! A man's love is so easily transferred;--as easily as a\nwoman's hand;--is it not, Phineas? Say the word, for it is what you\nare thinking.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of no such thing.\"\n\n\"You must think it--You need not be afraid to reproach me. I could\nbear it from you. What could I not bear from you? Oh, Phineas;--if I\nhad only known myself then, as I do now!\"\n\n\"It is too late for regrets,\" he said. There was something in the\nwords which grated on her feelings, and induced her at length to\nwithdraw herself from his arm. Too late for regrets! She had never\ntold herself that it was not too late. She was the wife of another\nman, and therefore, surely it was too late. But still the word coming\nfrom his mouth was painful to her. It seemed to signify that for him\nat least the game was all over.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" she said,--\"if our regrets and remorse were at our own\ndisposal! You might as well say that it is too late for unhappiness,\ntoo late for weariness, too late for all the misery that comes from a\nlife's disappointment.\"\n\n\"I should have said that indulgence in regrets is vain.\"\n\n\"That is a scrap of philosophy which I have heard so often before!\nBut we will not quarrel, will we, on the first day of my return?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"And I may speak to Barrington?\"\n\n\"No; certainly not.\"\n\n\"But I shall. How can I help it? He will be here to-morrow, and will\nbe full of the coming changes. How should I not mention your name? He\nknows--not all that has passed, but too much not to be aware of my\nanxiety. Of course your name will come up?\"\n\n\"What I request,--what I demand is, that you ask no favour for me.\nYour father will miss you,--will he not? I had better go now.\"\n\n\"Good night, Phineas.\"\n\n\"Good night, dear friend.\"\n\n\"Dearest, dearest friend,\" she said. Then he left her, and without\nassistance, let himself out into the square. In her intercourse with\nhim there was a passion the expression of which caused him sorrow and\nalmost dismay. He did not say so even to himself, but he felt that a\ntime might come in which she would resent the coldness of demeanour\nwhich it would be imperative upon him to adopt in his intercourse\nwith her. He knew how imprudent he had been to stand there with his\narm round her waist.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nCAGLIOSTRO.\n\n\nIt had been settled that Parliament should meet on the Thursday in\nEaster week, and it was known to the world at large that Cabinet\nCouncils were held on the Friday previous, on the Monday, and on the\nTuesday; but nobody knew what took place at those meetings. Cabinet\nCouncils are, of course, very secret. What kind of oath the members\ntake not to divulge any tittle of the proceedings at these awful\nconferences, the general public does not know; but it is presumed\nthat oaths are taken very solemn, and it is known that they are very\nbinding. Nevertheless, it is not an uncommon thing to hear openly\nat the clubs an account of what has been settled; and, as we all\nknow, not a council is held as to which the editor of The People's\nBanner does not inform its readers next day exactly what took\nplace. But as to these three Cabinet Councils there was an increased\nmystery abroad. Statements, indeed, were made, very definite and\ncircumstantial, but then they were various,--and directly opposed\none to another. According to The People's Banner, Mr. Daubeny\nhad resolved, with that enduring courage which was his peculiar\ncharacteristic, that he would not be overcome by faction, but would\ncontinue to exercise all the functions of Prime Minister until he had\nhad an opportunity of learning whether his great measure had been\nopposed by the sense of the country, or only by the tactics of an\nangry and greedy party. Other journals declared that the Ministry as\na whole had decided on resigning. But the clubs were in a state of\nagonising doubt. At the great stronghold of conservative policy in\nPall Mall men were silent, embarrassed, and unhappy. The party was\nat heart divorced from its leaders,--and a party without leaders is\npowerless. To these gentlemen there could be no triumph, whether Mr.\nDaubeny went out or remained in office. They had been betrayed;--but\nas a body were unable even to accuse the traitor. As regarded most\nof them they had accepted the treachery and bowed their heads\nbeneath it, by means of their votes. And as to the few who had been\nstaunch,--they also were cowed by a feeling that they had been\ninstrumental in destroying their own power by endeavouring to protect\na doomed institution. Many a thriving county member in those days\nexpressed a wish among his friends that he had never meddled with\nthe affairs of public life, and hinted at the Chiltern Hundreds. On\nthe other side, there was undoubtedly something of a rabid desire\nfor immediate triumph, which almost deserved that epithet of greedy\nwhich was then commonly used by Conservatives in speaking of their\nopponents. With the Liberal leaders,--such men as Mr. Gresham and\nthe two dukes,--the anxiety displayed was, no doubt, on behalf\nof the country. It is right, according to our constitution, that\nthe Government should be entrusted to the hands of those whom the\nconstituencies of the country have most trusted. And, on behalf of\nthe country, it behoves the men in whom the country has placed its\ntrust to do battle in season and out of season,--to carry on war\ninternecine,--till the demands of the country are obeyed. A sound\npolitical instinct had induced Mr. Gresham on this occasion to attack\nhis opponent simply on the ground of his being the leader only of\na minority in the House of Commons. But from among Mr. Gresham's\nfriends there had arisen a noise which sounded very like a clamour\nfor place, and this noise of course became aggravated in the ears\nof those who were to be displaced. Now, during Easter week, the\nclamour became very loud. Could it be possible that the archfiend of\na Minister would dare to remain in office till the end of a hurried\nSession, and then again dissolve Parliament? Men talked of rows in\nLondon,--even of revolution, and there were meetings in open places\nboth by day and night. Petitions were to be prepared, and the country\nwas to be made to express itself.\n\nWhen, however, Thursday afternoon came, Mr. Daubeny \"threw up the\nsponge.\" Up to the last moment the course which he intended to pursue\nwas not known to the country at large. He entered the House very\nslowly,--almost with a languid air, as though indifferent to its\nperformances, and took his seat at about half-past four. Every man\nthere felt that there was insolence in his demeanour,--and yet\nthere was nothing on which it was possible to fasten in the way of\nexpressed complaint. There was a faint attempt at a cheer,--for good\nsoldiers acknowledge the importance of supporting even an unpopular\ngeneral. But Mr. Daubeny's soldiers on this occasion were not very\ngood. When he had been seated about five minutes he rose, still very\nlanguidly, and began his statement. He and his colleagues, he said,\nin their attempt to legislate for the good of their country had been\nbeaten in regard to a very great measure by a large majority, and in\ncompliance with what he acknowledged to be the expressed opinion of\nthe House, he had considered it to be his duty--as his colleagues had\nconsidered it to be theirs--to place their joint resignations in the\nhands of Her Majesty. This statement was received with considerable\nsurprise, as it was not generally known that Mr. Daubeny had as\nyet even seen the Queen. But the feeling most predominant in the\nHouse was one almost of dismay at the man's quiescence. He and his\ncolleagues had resigned, and he had recommended Her Majesty to\nsend for Mr. Gresham. He spoke in so low a voice as to be hardly\naudible to the House at large, and then paused,--ceasing to speak,\nas though his work were done. He even made some gesture, as though\nstepping back to his seat;--deceived by which Mr. Gresham, at the\nother side of the table, rose to his legs. \"Perhaps,\" said Mr.\nDaubeny,--\"Perhaps the right honourable gentleman would pardon him,\nand the House would pardon him, if still, for a moment, he interposed\nbetween the House and the right honourable gentleman. He could well\nunderstand the impatience of the right honourable gentleman,--who\nno doubt was anxious to reassume that authority among them, the\ntemporary loss of which he had not perhaps borne with all the\nequanimity which might have been expected from him. He would promise\nthe House and the right honourable gentleman that he would not detain\nthem long.\" Mr. Gresham threw himself back into his seat, evidently\nnot without annoyance, and his enemy stood for a moment looking at\nhim. Unless they were angels these two men must at that moment have\nhated each other;--and it is supposed that they were no more than\nhuman. It was afterwards said that the little ruse of pretending to\nresume his seat had been deliberately planned by Mr. Daubeny with the\nview of seducing Mr. Gresham into an act of seeming impatience, and\nthat these words about his opponent's failing equanimity had been\ncarefully prepared.\n\nMr. Daubeny stood for a minute silent, and then began to pour forth\nthat which was really his speech on the occasion. Those flaccid\nhalf-pronounced syllables in which he had declared that he had\nresigned,--had been studiously careless, purposely flaccid. It\nwas his duty to let the House know the fact, and he did his duty.\nBut now he had a word to say in which he himself could take some\nlittle interest. Mr. Daubeny could be fiery or flaccid as it suited\nhimself;--and now it suited him to be fiery. He had a prophecy\nto make, and prophets have ever been energetic men. Mr. Daubeny\nconceived it to be his duty to inform the House, and through the\nHouse the country, that now, at last, had the day of ruin come upon\nthe British Empire, because it had bowed itself to the dominion of an\nunscrupulous and greedy faction. It cannot be said that the language\nwhich he used was unmeasured, because no word that he uttered would\nhave warranted the Speaker in calling him to order; but, within the\nvery wide bounds of parliamentary etiquette, there was no limit to\nthe reproach and reprobation which he heaped on the House of Commons\nfor its late vote. And his audacity equalled his insolence. In\nannouncing his resignation, he had condescended to speak of himself\nand his colleagues; but now he dropped his colleagues as though they\nwere unworthy of his notice, and spoke only of his own doings,--of\nhis own efforts to save the country, which was indeed willing to be\nsaved, but unable to select fitting instruments of salvation. \"He\nhad been twitted,\" he said, \"with inconsistency to his principles\nby men who were simply unable to understand the meaning of the word\nConservatism. These gentlemen seemed to think that any man who did\nnot set himself up as an apostle of constant change must therefore\nbe bound always to stand still and see his country perish from\nstagnation. It might be that there were gentlemen in that House whose\ntimid natures could not face the dangers of any movement; but for\nhimself he would say that no word had ever fallen from his lips which\njustified either his friends or his adversaries in classing him among\nthe number. If a man be anxious to keep his fire alight, does he\nrefuse to touch the sacred coals as in the course of nature they are\nconsumed? Or does he move them with the salutary poker and add fresh\nfuel from the basket? They all knew that enemy to the comfort of the\ndomestic hearth, who could not keep his hands for a moment from the\nfire-irons. Perhaps he might be justified if he said that they had\nbeen very much troubled of late in that House by gentlemen who could\nnot keep their fingers from poker and tongs. But there had now fallen\nupon them a trouble of a nature much more serious in its effects than\nany that had come or could come from would-be reformers. A spirit of\npersonal ambition, a wretched thirst for office, a hankering after\nthe power and privileges of ruling, had not only actuated men,--as,\nalas, had been the case since first the need for men to govern others\nhad arisen in the world,--but had been openly avowed and put forward\nas an adequate and sufficient reason for opposing a measure in\ndisapprobation of which no single argument had been used! The right\nhonourable gentleman's proposition to the House had been simply\nthis;--'I shall oppose this measure, be it good or bad, because I\ndesire, myself, to be Prime Minister, and I call upon those whom I\nlead in politics to assist me in doing so, in order that they may\nshare the good things on which we may thus be enabled to lay our\nhands!'\"\n\nThen there arose a great row in the House, and there seemed to be a\ndoubt whether the still existing Minister of the day would be allowed\nto continue his statement. Mr. Gresham rose to his feet, but sat down\nagain instantly, without having spoken a word that was audible. Two\nor three voices were heard calling upon the Speaker for protection.\nIt was, however, asserted afterwards that nothing had been said\nwhich demanded the Speaker's interference. But all moderate voices\nwere soon lost in the enraged clamour of members on each side. The\ninsolence showered upon those who generally supported Mr. Daubeny had\nequalled that with which he had exasperated those opposed to him;\nand as the words had fallen from his lips, there had been no purpose\nof cheering him from the conservative benches. But noise creates\nnoise, and shouting is a ready and easy mode of contest. For a while\nit seemed as though the right side of the Speaker's chair was only\nbeaten by the majority of lungs on the left side;--and in the midst\nof it all Mr. Daubeny still stood, firm on his feet, till gentlemen\nhad shouted themselves silent,--and then he resumed his speech.\n\nThe remainder of what he said was profound, prophetic, and\nunintelligible. The gist of it, so far as it could be understood\nwhen the bran was bolted from it, consisted in an assurance that the\ncountry had now reached that period of its life in which rapid decay\nwas inevitable, and that, as the mortal disease had already shown\nitself in its worst form, national decrepitude was imminent, and\nnatural death could not long be postponed. They who attempted to\nread the prophecy with accuracy were of opinion that the prophet had\nintimated that had the nation, even in this its crisis, consented\nto take him, the prophet, as its sole physician and to obey his\nprescription with childlike docility, health might not only have been\nre-established, but a new juvenescence absolutely created. The nature\nof the medicine that should have been taken was even supposed to\nhave been indicated in some very vague terms. Had he been allowed to\noperate he would have cut the tap-roots of the national cancer, have\nintroduced fresh blood into the national veins, and resuscitated\nthe national digestion, and he seemed to think that the nation,\nas a nation, was willing enough to undergo the operation, and be\ntreated as he should choose to treat it;--but that the incubus of Mr.\nGresham, backed by an unworthy House of Commons, had prevented, and\nwas preventing, the nation from having its own way. Therefore the\nnation must be destroyed. Mr. Daubeny as soon as he had completed his\nspeech took up his hat and stalked out of the House.\n\nIt was supposed at the time that the retiring Prime Minister had\nintended, when he rose to his legs, not only to denounce his\nopponents, but also to separate himself from his own unworthy\nassociates. Men said that he had become disgusted with politics,\ndisappointed, and altogether demoralized by defeat, and great\ncuriosity existed as to the steps which might be taken at the time by\nthe party of which he had hitherto been the leader. On that evening,\nat any rate, nothing was done. When Mr. Daubeny was gone, Mr. Gresham\nrose and said that in the present temper of the House he thought\nit best to postpone any statement from himself. He had received\nHer Majesty's commands only as he had entered that House, and in\nobedience to those commands, he should wait upon Her Majesty early\nto-morrow. He hoped to be able to inform the House at the afternoon\nsitting, what was the nature of the commands with which Her Majesty\nmight honour him.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" Phineas asked Mr. Monk as they left the\nHouse together.\n\n\"I think that our Chatham of to-day is but a very poor copy of him\nwho misbehaved a century ago.\"\n\n\"Does not the whole thing distress you?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. I have always felt that there has been a mistake\nabout Mr. Daubeny. By many he has been accounted as a statesman,\nwhereas to me he has always been a political Cagliostro. Now a\nconjuror is I think a very pleasant fellow to have among us, if we\nknow that he is a conjuror;--but a conjuror who is believed to do his\ntricks without sleight of hand is a dangerous man. It is essential\nthat such a one should be found out and known to be a conjuror,--and\nI hope that such knowledge may have been communicated to some men\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"He was very great,\" said Ratler to Bonteen. \"Did you not think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,--very powerful indeed. But the party is broken up to\natoms.\"\n\n\"Atoms soon come together again in politics,\" said Ratler. \"They\ncan't do without him. They haven't got anybody else. I wonder what he\ndid when he got home.\"\n\n\"Had some gruel and went to bed,\" said Bonteen. \"They say these\nscenes in the House never disturb him at home.\" From which\nconversations it may be inferred that Mr. Monk and Messrs. Ratler and\nBonteen did not agree in their ideas respecting political conjurors.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nTHE PRIME MINISTER IS HARD PRESSED.\n\n\nIt can never be a very easy thing to form a Ministry. The one chosen\nchief is readily selected. Circumstances, indeed, have probably left\nno choice in the matter. Every man in the country who has at all\nturned his thoughts that way knows very well who will be the next\nPrime Minister when it comes to pass that a change is imminent.\nIn these days the occupant of the throne can have no difficulty.\nMr. Gresham recommends Her Majesty to send for Mr. Daubeny, or Mr.\nDaubeny for Mr. Gresham,--as some ten or a dozen years since Mr.\nMildmay told her to send for Lord de Terrier, or Lord de Terrier\nfor Mr. Mildmay. The Prime Minister is elected by the nation, but\nthe nation, except in rare cases, cannot go below that in arranging\ndetails, and the man for whom the Queen sends is burdened with the\nnecessity of selecting his colleagues. It may be,--probably must\nalways be the case,--that this, that, and the other colleagues are\nclearly indicated to his mind, but then each of these colleagues\nmay want his own inferior coadjutors, and so the difficulty begins,\nincreases, and at length culminates. On the present occasion it was\nknown at the end of a week that Mr. Gresham had not filled all his\noffices, and that there were difficulties. It was announced that the\nDuke of St. Bungay could not quite agree on certain points with Mr.\nGresham, and that the Duke of Omnium would do nothing without the\nother Duke. The Duke of St. Bungay was very powerful, as there were\nthree or four of the old adherents of Mr. Mildmay who would join\nno Government unless he was with them. Sir Harry Coldfoot and Lord\nPlinlimmon would not accept office without the Duke. The Duke was\nessential, and now, though the Duke's character was essentially\nthat of a practical man who never raised unnecessary trouble, men\nsaid that the Duke was at the bottom of it all. The Duke did not\napprove of Mr. Bonteen. Mr. Gresham, so it was said, insisted on Mr.\nBonteen,--appealing to the other Duke. But that other Duke, our own\nspecial Duke, Planty Pall that was, instead of standing up for Mr.\nBonteen, was cold and unsympathetic. He could not join the Ministry\nwithout his friend, the Duke of St. Bungay, and as to Mr. Bonteen, he\nthought that perhaps a better selection might be made.\n\nSuch were the club rumours which took place as to the difficulties\nof the day, and, as is generally the case, they were not far from\nthe truth. Neither of the dukes had absolutely put a veto on poor Mr.\nBonteen's elevation, but they had expressed themselves dissatisfied\nwith the appointment, and the younger duke had found himself\ncalled upon to explain that although he had been thrown much into\ncommunication with Mr. Bonteen he had never himself suggested that\nthat gentleman should follow him at the Exchequer. This was one of\nthe many difficulties which beset the Prime Minister elect in the\nperformance of his arduous duty.\n\nLady Glencora, as people would still persist in calling her, was at\nthe bottom of it all. She had sworn an oath inimical to Mr. Bonteen,\nand did not leave a stone unturned in her endeavours to accomplish\nit. If Phineas Finn might find acceptance, then Mr. Bonteen might be\nallowed to enter Elysium. A second Juno, she would allow the Romulus\nshe hated to sit in the seats of the blessed, to be fed with nectar,\nand to have his name printed in the lists of unruffled Cabinet\nmeetings,--but only on conditions. Phineas Finn must be allowed a\nseat also, and a little nectar,--though it were at the second table\nof the gods. For this she struggled, speaking her mind boldly to this\nand that member of her husband's party, but she struggled in vain.\nShe could obtain no assurance on behalf of Phineas Finn. The Duke of\nSt. Bungay would do nothing for her. Barrington Erle had declared\nhimself powerless. Her husband had condescended to speak to Mr.\nBonteen himself, and Mr. Bonteen's insolent answer had been reported\nto her. Then she went sedulously to work, and before a couple of days\nwere over she did make her husband believe that Mr. Bonteen was not\nfit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. This took place before Mr.\nDaubeny's statement, while the Duke and Duchess of St. Bungay were\nstill at Matching,--while Mr. Bonteen, unconscious of what was being\ndone, was still in the House. Before the two days were over, the Duke\nof St. Bungay had a very low opinion of Mr. Bonteen, but was quite\nignorant of any connection between that low opinion and the fortunes\nof Phineas Finn.\n\n\"Plantagenet, of all your men that are coming up, your Mr. Bonteen\nis the worst. I often think that you are going down hill, both in\ncharacter and intellect, but if you go as low as that I shall prefer\nto cross the water, and live in America.\" This she said in the\npresence of the two dukes.\n\n\"What has Mr. Bonteen done?\" asked the elder, laughing.\n\n\"He was boasting this morning openly of whom he intended to bring\nwith him into the Cabinet.\" Truth demands that the chronicler should\nsay that this was a positive fib. Mr. Bonteen, no doubt, had talked\nlargely and with indiscretion, but had made no such boast as that of\nwhich the Duchess accused him. \"Mr. Gresham will get astray if he\ndoesn't allow some one to tell him the truth.\"\n\nShe did not press the matter any further then, but what she had said\nwas not thrown away. \"Your wife is almost right about that man,\" the\nelder Duke said to the younger.\n\n\"It's Mr. Gresham's doing,--not mine,\" said the younger.\n\n\"She is right about Gresham, too,\" said the elder. \"With all his\nimmense intellect and capacity for business no man wants more looking\nafter.\"\n\nThat evening Mr. Bonteen was singled out by the Duchess for her\nspecial attention, and in the presence of all who were there\nassembled he made himself an ass. He could not save himself from\ntalking about himself when he was encouraged. On this occasion he\noffended all those feelings of official discretion and personal\nreticence which had been endeared to the old duke by the lessons\nwhich he had learned from former statesmen and by the experience of\nhis own life. To be quiet, unassuming, almost affectedly modest in\nany mention of himself, low-voiced, reflecting always more than he\nresolved, and resolving always more than he said, had been his aim.\nConscious of his high rank, and thinking, no doubt, much of the\nadvantages in public life which his birth and position had given him,\nstill he would never have ventured to speak of his own services as\nnecessary to any Government. That he had really been indispensable to\nmany he must have known, but not to his closest friend would he have\nsaid so in plain language. To such a man the arrogance of Mr. Bonteen\nwas intolerable.\n\nThere is probably more of the flavour of political aristocracy to\nbe found still remaining among our liberal leading statesmen than\namong their opponents. A conservative Cabinet is, doubtless, never\ndeficient in dukes and lords, and the sons of such; but conservative\ndukes and lords are recruited here and there, and as recruits, are\nnew to the business, whereas among the old Whigs a halo of statecraft\nhas, for ages past, so strongly pervaded and enveloped certain great\nfamilies, that the power in the world of politics thus produced\nstill remains, and is even yet efficacious in creating a feeling of\nexclusiveness. They say that \"misfortune makes men acquainted with\nstrange bedfellows.\" The old hereditary Whig Cabinet ministers must,\nno doubt, by this time have learned to feel themselves at home with\nstrange neighbours at their elbows. But still with them something of\nthe feeling of high blood, of rank, and of living in a park with deer\nabout it, remains. They still entertain a pride in their Cabinets,\nand have, at any rate, not as yet submitted themselves to a conjuror.\nThe Charles James Fox element of liberality still holds its own, and\nthe fragrance of Cavendish is essential. With no man was this feeling\nstronger than with the Duke of St. Bungay, though he well knew\nhow to keep it in abeyance,--even to the extent of self-sacrifice.\nBonteens must creep into the holy places. The faces which he loved to\nsee,--born chiefly of other faces he had loved when young,--could not\ncluster around the sacred table without others which were much less\nwelcome to him. He was wise enough to know that exclusiveness did not\nsuit the nation, though human enough to feel that it must have been\npleasant to himself. There must be Bonteens;--but when any Bonteen\ncame up, who loomed before his eyes as specially disagreeable, it\nseemed to him to be a duty to close the door against such a one, if\nit could be closed without violence. A constant, gentle pressure\nagainst the door would tend to keep down the number of the Bonteens.\n\n\"I am not sure that you are not going a little too quick in regard\nto Mr. Bonteen,\" said the elder duke to Mr. Gresham before he had\nfinally assented to a proposition originated by himself,--that he\nshould sit in the Cabinet without a portfolio.\n\n\"Palliser wishes it,\" said Mr. Gresham, shortly.\n\n\"He and I think that there has been some mistake about that. You\nsuggested the appointment to him, and he felt unwilling to raise an\nobjection without giving the matter very mature consideration. You\ncan understand that.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I thought that the selection would be peculiarly\nagreeable to him.\" Then the duke made a suggestion. \"Could not some\nspecial office at the Treasury be constructed for Mr. Bonteen's\nacceptance, having special reference to the question of decimal\ncoinage?\"\n\n\"But how about the salary?\" asked Mr. Gresham. \"I couldn't propose a\nnew office with a salary above \u00c2\u00a32,000.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we make it permanent,\" suggested the duke;--\"with\npermission to hold a seat if he can get one?\"\n\n\"I fear not,\" said Mr. Gresham.\n\n\"He got into a very unpleasant scrape when he was Financial\nSecretary,\" said the Duke.\n\n   But whither would'st thou, Muse? Unmeet\n      For jocund lyre are themes like these.\n   Shalt thou the talk of Gods repeat,\n   Debasing by thy strains effete\n      Such lofty mysteries?\n\nThe absolute words of a conversation so lofty shall no longer be\nattempted, but it may be said that Mr. Gresham was too wise to\ntreat as of no account the objections of such a one as the Duke\nof St. Bungay. He saw Mr. Bonteen, and he saw the other duke, and\ndifficulties arose. Mr. Bonteen made himself very disagreeable\nindeed. As Mr. Bonteen had never absolutely been as yet more than a\ndemigod, our Muse, light as she is, may venture to report that he\ntold Mr. Ratler that \"he'd be d---- if he'd stand it. If he were to\nbe thrown over now, he'd make such a row, and would take such care\nthat the fat should be in the fire, that his enemies, whoever they\nwere, should wish that they had kept their fingers off him. He knew\nwho was doing it.\" If he did not know, his guess was right. In his\nheart he accused the young duchess, though he mentioned her name\nto no one. And it was the young duchess. Then there was made an\ninsidious proposition to Mr. Gresham,--which reached him at last\nthrough Barrington Erle,--that matters would go quieter if Phineas\nFinn were placed in his old office at the Colonies instead of Lord\nFawn, whose name had been suggested, and for whom,--as Barrington\nErle declared,--no one cared a brass farthing. Mr. Gresham, when he\nheard this, thought that he began to smell a rat, and was determined\nto be on his guard. Why should the appointment of Mr. Phineas Finn\nmake things go easier in regard to Mr. Bonteen? There must be some\nwoman's fingers in the pie. Now Mr. Gresham was firmly resolved that\nno woman's fingers should have anything to do with his pie.\n\nHow the thing went from bad to worse, it would be bootless here\nto tell. Neither of the two dukes absolutely refused to join the\nMinistry; but they were persistent in their objection to Mr. Bonteen,\nand were joined in it by Lord Plinlimmon and Sir Harry Coldfoot. It\nwas in vain that Mr. Gresham urged that he had no other man ready\nand fit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. That excuse could not be\naccepted. There was Legge Wilson, who twelve years since had been\nat the Treasury, and would do very well. Now Mr. Gresham had always\npersonally hated Legge Wilson,--and had, therefore, offered him the\nBoard of Trade. Legge Wilson had disgusted him by accepting it, and\nthe name had already been published in connection with the office.\nBut in the lists which had appeared towards the end of the week, no\nname was connected with the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer,\nand no office was connected with the name of Mr. Bonteen. The editor\nof The People's Banner, however, expressed the gratification of\nthat journal that even Mr. Gresham had not dared to propose Mr.\nPhineas Finn for any place under the Crown.\n\nAt last Mr. Bonteen was absolutely told that he could not be\nChancellor of the Exchequer. If he would consent to give his very\nvaluable services to the country with the view of carrying through\nParliament the great measure of decimal coinage he should be\nPresident of the Board of Trade,--but without a seat in the Cabinet.\nHe would thus become the Right Honourable Bonteen, which, no doubt,\nwould be a great thing for him,--and, not busy in the Cabinet,\nmust be able to devote his time exclusively to the great measure\nabove-named. What was to become of \"Trade\" generally, was not\nspecially explained; but, as we all know, there would be a\nVice-President to attend to details.\n\nThe proposition very nearly broke the man's heart. With a voice\nstopped by agitation, with anger flashing from his eyes, almost in a\nconvulsion of mixed feelings, he reminded his chief of what had been\nsaid about his appointment in the House. Mr. Gresham had already\nabsolutely defended it. After that did Mr. Gresham mean to withdraw\na promise that had so formally been made? But Mr. Gresham was not to\nbe caught in that way. He had made no promise;--had not even stated\nto the House that such appointment was to be made. A very improper\nquestion had been asked as to a rumour,--in answering which he\nhad been forced to justify himself by explaining that discussions\nrespecting the office had been necessary. \"Mr. Bonteen,\" said\nMr. Gresham, \"no one knows better than you the difficulties of a\nMinister. If you can act with us I shall be very grateful to you. If\nyou cannot, I shall regret the loss of your services.\" Mr. Bonteen\ntook twenty-four hours to consider, and was then appointed President\nof the Board of Trade without a seat in the Cabinet. Mr. Legge Wilson\nbecame Chancellor of the Exchequer. When the lists were completed,\nno office whatever was assigned to Phineas Finn. \"I haven't done\nwith Mr. Bonteen yet,\" said the young duchess to her friend Madame\nGoesler.\n\nThe secrets of the world are very marvellous, but they are not\nthemselves half so wonderful as the way in which they become known to\nthe world. There could be no doubt that Mr. Bonteen's high ambition\nhad foundered, and that he had been degraded through the secret\nenmity of the Duchess of Omnium. It was equally certain that his\nsecret enmity to Phineas Finn had brought this punishment on his\nhead. But before the Ministry had been a week in office almost\neverybody knew that it was so. The rumours were full of falsehood,\nbut yet they contained the truth. The duchess had done it. The\nduchess was the bosom friend of Lady Laura Kennedy, who was in love\nwith Phineas Finn. She had gone on her knees to Mr. Gresham to get\na place for her friend's favourite, and Mr. Gresham had refused.\nConsequently, at her bidding, half-a-dozen embryo Ministers--her\nhusband among the number--had refused to be amenable to Mr. Gresham.\nMr. Gresham had at last consented to sacrifice Mr. Bonteen, who had\noriginally instigated him to reject the claims of Phineas Finn. That\nthe degradation of the one man had been caused by the exclusion of\nthe other all the world knew.\n\n\"It shuts the door to me for ever and ever,\" said Phineas to Madame\nGoesler.\n\n\"I don't see that.\"\n\n\"Of course it does. Such an affair places a mark against a man's name\nwhich will never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Is your heart set upon holding some trifling appointment under a\nMinister?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, it is;--or rather it was. The prospect of\noffice to me was more than perhaps to any other expectant. Even this\nman, Bonteen, has some fortune of his own, and can live if he be\nexcluded. I have given up everything for the chance of something in\nthis line.\"\n\n\"Other lines are open.\"\n\n\"Not to me, Madame Goesler. I do not mean to defend myself. I have\nbeen very foolish, very sanguine, and am now very unhappy.\"\n\n\"What shall I say to you?\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\n\"In truth, then, I do not sympathise with you. The thing lost is too\nsmall, too mean to justify unhappiness.\"\n\n\"But, Madame Goesler, you are a rich woman.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"If you were to lose it all, would you not be unhappy? It has been\nmy ambition to live here in London as one of a special set which\ndominates all other sets in our English world. To do so a man\nshould have means of his own. I have none; and yet I have tried\nit,--thinking that I could earn my bread at it as men do at other\nprofessions. I acknowledge that I should not have thought so. No man\nshould attempt what I have attempted without means, at any rate to\nlive on if he fail; but I am not the less unhappy because I have been\nsilly.\"\n\n\"What will you do?\"\n\n\"Ah,--what? Another friend asked me that the other day, and I told\nher that I should vanish.\"\n\n\"Who was that friend?\"\n\n\"Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"She is in London again now?\"\n\n\"Yes; she and her father are in Portman Square.\"\n\n\"She has been an injurious friend to you.\"\n\n\"No, by heaven,\" exclaimed Phineas. \"But for her I should never have\nbeen here at all, never have had a seat in Parliament, never have\nbeen in office, never have known you.\"\n\n\"And might have been the better without any of these things.\"\n\n\"No man ever had a better friend than Lady Laura has been to me.\nMalice, wicked and false as the devil, has lately joined our names\ntogether to the incredible injury of both of us; but it has not been\nher fault.\"\n\n\"You are energetic in defending her.\"\n\n\"And so would she be in defending me. Circumstances threw us together\nand made us friends. Her father and her brother were my friends.\nI happened to be of service to her husband. We belonged to the\nsame party. And therefore--because she has been unfortunate in her\nmarriage--people tell lies of her.\"\n\n\"It is a pity he should--not die, and leave her,\" said Madame Goesler\nslowly.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because then you might justify yourself in defending her by making\nher your wife.\" She paused, but he made no answer to this. \"You are\nin love with her,\" she said.\n\n\"It is untrue.\"\n\n\"Mr. Finn!\"\n\n\"Well, what would you have? I am not in love with her. To me she is\nno more than my sister. Were she as free as air I should not ask her\nto be my wife. Can a man and woman feel no friendship without being\nin love with each other?\"\n\n\"I hope they may,\" said Madame Goesler. Had he been lynx-eyed he\nmight have seen that she blushed; but it required quick eyes to\ndiscover a blush on Madame Goesler's face. \"You and I are friends.\"\n\n\"Indeed we are,\" he said, grasping her hand as he took his leave.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n\"I HOPE I'M NOT DISTRUSTED.\"\n\n\nGerard Maule, as the reader has been informed, wrote three lines to\nhis dearest Adelaide to inform her that his father would not assent\nto the suggestion respecting Maule Abbey which had been made by\nLady Chiltern, and then took no further steps in the matter. In the\nfortnight next after the receipt of his letter nothing was heard of\nhim at Harrington Hall, and Adelaide, though she made no complaint,\nwas unhappy. Then came the letter from Mr. Spooner,--with all its\nrich offers, and Adelaide's mind was for a while occupied with\nwrath against her second suitor. But as the egregious folly of Mr.\nSpooner,--for to her thinking the aspirations of Mr. Spooner were\negregiously foolish,--died out of her mind, her thoughts reverted to\nher engagement. Why did not the man come to her, or why did he not\nwrite?\n\nShe had received from Lady Chiltern an invitation to remain with\nthem,--the Chilterns,--till her marriage. \"But, dear Lady Chiltern,\nwho knows when it will be?\" Adelaide had said. Lady Chiltern had\ngood-naturedly replied that the longer it was put off the better\nfor herself. \"But you'll be going to London or abroad before that\nday comes.\" Lady Chiltern declared that she looked forward to\nno festivities which could under any circumstances remove her\nfour-and-twenty hours travelling distance from the kennels. Probably\nshe might go up to London for a couple of months as soon as the\nhunting was over, and the hounds had been drafted, and the horses had\nbeen coddled, and every covert had been visited. From the month of\nMay till the middle of July she might, perhaps, be allowed to be in\ntown, as communications by telegram could now be made day and night.\nAfter that, preparations for cub-hunting would be imminent, and,\nas a matter of course, it would be necessary that she should be at\nHarrington Hall at so important a period of the year. During those\ncouple of months she would be very happy to have the companionship of\nher friend, and she hinted that Gerard Maule would certainly be in\ntown. \"I begin to think it would have been better that I should never\nhave seen Gerard Maule,\" said Adelaide Palliser.\n\nThis happened about the middle of March, while hunting was still in\nforce. Gerard's horses were standing in the neighbourhood, but Gerard\nhimself was not there. Mr. Spooner, since that short, disheartening\nnote had been sent to him by Lord Chiltern, had not been seen at\nHarrington. There was a Harrington Lawn Meet on one occasion, but\nhe had not appeared till the hounds were at the neighbouring covert\nside. Nevertheless he had declared that he did not intend to give\nup the pursuit, and had even muttered something of the sort to Lord\nChiltern. \"I am one of those fellows who stick to a thing, you know,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I am afraid you had better give up sticking to her, because she's\ngoing to marry somebody else.\"\n\n\"I've heard all about that, my lord. He's a very nice sort of young\nman, but I'm told he hasn't got his house ready yet for a family.\"\nAll which Lord Chiltern repeated to his wife. Neither of them spoke\nto Adelaide again about Mr. Spooner; but this did cause a feeling in\nLady Chiltern's mind that perhaps this engagement with young Maule\nwas a foolish thing, and that, if so, she was in a great measure\nresponsible for the folly.\n\n\"Don't you think you'd better write to him?\" she said, one morning.\n\n\"Why does he not write to me?\"\n\n\"But he did,--when he wrote you that his father would not consent to\ngive up the house. You did not answer him then.\"\n\n\"It was two lines,--without a date. I don't even know where he\nlives.\"\n\n\"You know his club?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I know his club. I do feel, Lady Chiltern, that I have become\nengaged to marry a man as to whom I am altogether in the dark. I\ndon't like writing to him at his club.\"\n\n\"You have seen more of him here and in Italy than most girls see of\ntheir future husbands.\"\n\n\"So I have,--but I have seen no one belonging to him. Don't you\nunderstand what I mean? I feel all at sea about him. I am sure he\ndoes not mean any harm.\"\n\n\"Certainly he does not.\"\n\n\"But then he hardly means any good.\"\n\n\"I never saw a man more earnestly in love,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Oh yes,--he's quite enough in love. But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"He'll just remain up in London thinking about it, and never tell\nhimself that there's anything to be done. And then, down here, what\nis my best hope? Not that he'll come to see me, but that he'll come\nto see his horse, and that so, perhaps, I may get a word with him.\"\nThen Lady Chiltern suggested, with a laugh, that perhaps it might\nhave been better that she should have accepted Mr. Spooner. There\nwould have been no doubt as to Mr. Spooner's energy and purpose.\n\"Only that if there was not another man in the world I wouldn't marry\nhim, and that I never saw any other man except Gerard Maule whom I\neven fancied I could marry.\"\n\nAbout a fortnight after this, when the hunting was all over, in the\nbeginning of April, she did write to him as follows, and did direct\nher letter to his club. In the meantime Lord Chiltern had intimated\nto his wife that if Gerard Maule behaved badly he should consider\nhimself to be standing in the place of Adelaide's father or brother.\nHis wife pointed out to him that were he her father or her brother he\ncould do nothing,--that in these days let a man behave ever so badly,\nno means of punishing was within reach of the lady's friends. But\nLord Chiltern would not assent to this. He muttered something about\na horsewhip, and seemed to suggest that one man could, if he were so\nminded, always have it out with another, if not in this way, then in\nthat. Lady Chiltern protested, and declared that horsewhips could not\nunder any circumstances be efficacious. \"He had better mind what he\nis about,\" said Lord Chiltern. It was after this that Adelaide wrote\nher letter:--\n\n\n   Harrington Hall, 5th April.\n\n   DEAR GERARD,--\n\n   I have been thinking that I should hear from you, and have\n   been surprised,--I may say unhappy,--because I have not\n   done so. Perhaps you thought I ought to have answered the\n   three words which you wrote to me about your father; if\n   so, I will apologise; only they did not seem to give me\n   anything to say. I was very sorry that your father should\n   have \"cut up rough,\" as you call it, but you must remember\n   that we both expected that he would refuse, and that\n   we are only therefore where we thought we should be.\n   I suppose we shall have to wait till Providence does\n   something for us,--only, if so, it would be pleasanter to\n   me to hear your own opinion about it.\n\n   The Chilterns are surprised that you shouldn't have come\n   back, and seen the end of the season. There were some very\n   good runs just at last;--particularly one on last Monday.\n   But on Wednesday Trumpeton Wood was again blank, and there\n   was some row about wires. I can't explain it all; but you\n   must come, and Lord Chiltern will tell you. I have gone\n   down to see the horses ever so often;--but I don't care to\n   go now as you never write to me. They are all three quite\n   well, and Fan looks as silken and as soft as any lady need\n   do.\n\n   Lady Chiltern has been kinder than I can tell you. I go\n   up to town with her in May, and shall remain with her\n   while she is there. So far I have decided. After that\n   my future home must, sir, depend on the resolution and\n   determination, or perhaps on the vagaries and caprices, of\n   him who is to be my future master. Joking apart, I must\n   know to what I am to look forward before I can make up my\n   mind whether I will or will not go back to Italy towards\n   the end of the summer. If I do, I fear I must do so just\n   in the hottest time of the year; but I shall not like\n   to come down here again after leaving London,--unless\n   something by that time has been settled.\n\n   I shall send this to your club, and I hope that it will\n   reach you. I suppose that you are in London.\n\n   Good-bye, dearest Gerard.\n\n   Yours most affectionately,\n\n   ADELAIDE.\n\n   If there is anything that troubles you, pray tell me. I\n   ask you because I think it would be better for you that I\n   should know. I sometimes think that you would have written\n   if there had not been some misfortune. God bless you.\n\n\nGerard was in London, and sent the following note by return of\npost:--\n\n\n   ---- Club, Tuesday.\n\n   DEAREST ADELAIDE,\n\n   All right. If Chiltern can take me for a couple of nights,\n   I'll come down next week, and settle about the horses, and\n   will arrange everything.\n\n   Ever your own, with all my heart,\n\n   G. M.\n\n\n\"He will settle about his horses, and arrange everything,\" said\nAdelaide, as she showed the letter to Lady Chiltern. \"The horses\nfirst, and everything afterwards. The everything, of course, includes\nall my future happiness, the day of my marriage, whether to-morrow or\nin ten years' time, and the place where we shall live.\"\n\n\"At any rate, he's coming.\"\n\n\"Yes;--but when? He says next week, but he does not name any day. Did\nyou ever hear or see anything so unsatisfactory?\"\n\n\"I thought you would be glad to see him.\"\n\n\"So I should be,--if there was any sense in him. I shall be glad, and\nshall kiss him.\"\n\n\"I dare say you will.\"\n\n\"And let him put his arm round my waist and be happy. He will be\nhappy because he will think of nothing beyond. But what is to be the\nend of it?\"\n\n\"He says that he will settle everything.\"\n\n\"But he will have thought of nothing. What must I settle? That is\nthe question. When he was told to go to his father, he went to his\nfather. When he failed there the work was done, and the trouble was\noff his mind. I know him so well.\"\n\n\"If you think so ill of him why did you consent to get into his\nboat?\" said Lady Chiltern, seriously.\n\n\"I don't think ill of him. Why do you say that I think ill of him?\nI think better of him than of anybody else in the world;--but I know\nhis fault, and, as it happens, it is a fault so very prejudicial to\nmy happiness. You ask me why I got into his boat. Why does any girl\nget into a man's boat? Why did you get into Lord Chiltern's?\"\n\n\"I promised to marry him when I was seven years old;--so he says.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't have done it, if you hadn't had a sort of feeling\nthat you were born to be his wife. I haven't got into this man's boat\nyet; but I never can be happy unless I do, simply because--\"\n\n\"You love him.\"\n\n\"Yes;--just that. I have a feeling that I should like to be in his\nboat, and I shouldn't like to be anywhere else. After you have come\nto feel like that about a man I don't suppose it makes any difference\nwhether you think him perfect or imperfect. He's just my own,--at\nleast I hope so;--the one thing that I've got. If I wear a stuff\nfrock, I'm not going to despise it because it's not silk.\"\n\n\"Mr. Spooner would be the stuff frock.\"\n\n\"No;--Mr. Spooner is shoddy, and very bad shoddy, too.\"\n\nOn the Saturday in the following week Gerard Maule did arrive at\nHarrington Hall,--and was welcomed as only accepted lovers are\nwelcomed. Not a word of reproach was uttered as to his delinquencies.\nNo doubt he got the kiss with which Adelaide had herself suggested\nthat his coming would be rewarded. He was allowed to stand on the rug\nbefore the fire with his arm round her waist. Lady Chiltern smiled on\nhim. His horses had been specially visited that morning, and a lively\nreport as to their condition was made to him. Not a word was said on\nthat occasion which could distress him. Even Lord Chiltern when he\ncame in was gracious to him. \"Well, old fellow,\" he said, \"you've\nmissed your hunting.\"\n\n\"Yes; indeed. Things kept me in town.\"\n\n\"We had some uncommonly good runs.\"\n\n\"Have the horses stood pretty well?\" asked Gerard.\n\n\"I felt uncommonly tempted to borrow yours; and should have done so\nonce or twice if I hadn't known that I should have been betrayed.\"\n\n\"I wish you had, with all my heart,\" said Gerard. And then they went\nto dress for dinner.\n\nIn the evening, when the ladies had gone to bed, Lord Chiltern took\nhis friend off to the smoking-room. At Harrington Hall it was not\nunusual for the ladies and gentlemen to descend together into the\nvery comfortable Pandemonium which was so called, when,--as was the\ncase at present,--the terms of intimacy between them were sufficient\nto warrant such a proceeding. But on this occasion Lady Chiltern\nwent very discreetly upstairs, and Adelaide, with equal discretion,\nfollowed her. It had been arranged beforehand that Lord Chiltern\nshould say a salutary word or two to the young man. Maule began about\nthe hunting, asking questions about this and that, but his host\nstopped him at once. Lord Chiltern, when he had a task on hand, was\nalways inclined to get through it at once,--perhaps with an energy\nthat was too sudden in its effects. \"Maule,\" he said, \"you ought to\nmake up your mind what you mean to do about that girl.\"\n\n\"Do about her! How?\"\n\n\"You and she are engaged, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Of course we are. There isn't any doubt about it.\"\n\n\"Just so. But when things come to be like that, all delays are good\nfun to the man, but they're the very devil to the girl.\"\n\n\"I thought it was always the other way up, and that girls wanted\ndelay?\"\n\n\"That's only a theoretical delicacy which never means much. When a\ngirl is engaged she likes to have the day fixed. When there's a long\ninterval the man can do pretty much as he pleases, while the girl can\ndo nothing except think about him. Then it sometimes turns out that\nwhen he's wanted, he's not there.\"\n\n\"I hope I'm not distrusted,\" said Gerard, with an air that showed\nthat he was almost disposed to be offended.\n\n\"Not in the least. The women here think you the finest paladin in the\nworld, and Miss Palliser would fly at my throat if she thought that\nI said a word against you. But she's in my house, you see; and I'm\nbound to do exactly as I should if she were my sister.\"\n\n\"And if she were your sister?\"\n\n\"I should tell you that I couldn't approve of the engagement unless\nyou were prepared to fix the time of your marriage. And I should ask\nyou where you intended to live.\"\n\n\"Wherever she pleases. I can't go to Maule Abbey while my father\nlives, without his sanction.\"\n\n\"And he may live for the next twenty years.\"\n\n\"Or thirty.\"\n\n\"Then you are bound to decide upon something else. It's no use saying\nthat you leave it to her. You can't leave it to her. What I mean\nis this, that now you are here, I think you are bound to settle\nsomething with her. Good-night, old fellow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nBOULOGNE.\n\n\nGerard Maule, as he sat upstairs half undressed in his bedroom that\nnight didn't like it. He hardly knew what it was that he did not\nlike,--but he felt that there was something wrong. He thought that\nLord Chiltern had not been warranted in speaking to him with a tone\nof authority, and in talking of a brother's position,--and the rest\nof it. He had lacked the presence of mind for saying anything at the\nmoment; but he must say something sooner or later. He wasn't going to\nbe driven by Lord Chiltern. When he looked back at his own conduct he\nthought that it had been more than noble,--almost romantic. He had\nfallen in love with Miss Palliser, and spoken his love out freely,\nwithout any reference to money. He didn't know what more any fellow\ncould have done. As to his marrying out of hand, the day after his\nengagement, as a man of fortune can do, everybody must have known\nthat that was out of the question. Adelaide of course had known it.\nIt had been suggested to him that he should consult his father as to\nliving at Maule Abbey. Now if there was one thing he hated more than\nanother, it was consulting his father; and yet he had done it. He had\nasked for a loan of the old house in perfect faith, and it was not\nhis fault that it had been refused. He could not make a house to live\nin, nor could he coin a fortune. He had \u00c2\u00a3800 a-year of his own, but\nof course he owed a little money. Men with such incomes always do\nowe a little money. It was almost impossible that he should marry\nquite at once. It was not his fault that Adelaide had no fortune of\nher own. When he fell in love with her he had been a great deal too\ngenerous to think of fortune, and that ought to be remembered now to\nhis credit. Such was the sum of his thoughts, and his anger spread\nitself from Lord Chiltern even on to Adelaide herself. Chiltern would\nhardly have spoken in that way unless she had complained. She, no\ndoubt, had been speaking to Lady Chiltern, and Lady Chiltern had\npassed it on to her husband. He would have it out with Adelaide on\nthe next morning,--quite decidedly. And he would make Lord Chiltern\nunderstand that he would not endure interference. He was quite ready\nto leave Harrington Hall at a moment's notice if he were ill-treated.\nThis was the humour in which Gerard Maule put himself to bed that\nnight.\n\nOn the following morning he was very late at breakfast,--so late that\nLord Chiltern had gone over to the kennels. As he was dressing he had\nresolved that it would be fitting that he should speak again to his\nhost before he said anything to Adelaide that might appear to impute\nblame to her. He would ask Chiltern whether anything was meant by\nwhat had been said over-night. But, as it happened, Adelaide had been\nleft alone to pour out his tea for him, and,--as the reader will\nunderstand to have been certain on such an occasion,--they were left\ntogether for an hour in the breakfast parlour. It was impossible that\nsuch an hour should be passed without some reference to the grievance\nwhich was lying heavy on his heart. \"Late; I should think you are,\"\nsaid Adelaide laughing. \"It is nearly eleven. Lord Chiltern has been\nout an hour. I suppose you never get up early except for hunting.\"\n\n\"People always think it is so wonderfully virtuous to get up. What's\nthe use of it?\"\n\n\"Your breakfast is so cold.\"\n\n\"I don't care about that. I suppose they can boil me an egg. I was\nvery seedy when I went to bed.\"\n\n\"You smoked too many cigars, sir.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't; but Chiltern was saying things that I didn't like.\"\nAdelaide's face at once became very serious. \"Yes, a good deal of\nsugar, please. I don't care about toast, and anything does for me. He\nhas gone to the kennels, has he?\"\n\n\"He said he should. What was he saying last night?\"\n\n\"Nothing particular. He has a way of blowing up, you know; and he\nlooks at one just as if he expected that everybody was to do just\nwhat he chooses.\"\n\n\"You didn't quarrel?\"\n\n\"Not at all; I went off to bed without saying a word. I hate jaws.\nI shall just put it right this morning; that's all.\"\n\n\"Was it about me, Gerard?\"\n\n\"It doesn't signify the least.\"\n\n\"But it does signify. If you and he were to quarrel would it not\nsignify to me very much? How could I stay here with them, or go up\nto London with them, if you and he had really quarrelled? You must\ntell me. I know that it was about me.\" Then she came and sat close to\nhim. \"Gerard,\" she continued, \"I don't think you understand how much\neverything is to me that concerns you.\"\n\nWhen he began to reflect, he could not quite recollect what it was\nthat Lord Chiltern had said to him. He did remember that something\nhad been suggested about a brother and sister which had implied that\nAdelaide might want protection, but there was nothing unnatural or\nother than kind in the position which Lord Chiltern had declared\nthat he would assume. \"He seemed to think that I wasn't treating you\nwell,\" said he, turning round from the breakfast-table to the fire,\n\"and that is a sort of thing I can't stand.\"\n\n\"I have never said so, Gerard.\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is that he expects, or why he should interfere\nat all. I can't bear to be interfered with. What does he know about\nit? He has had somebody to pay everything for him half-a-dozen times,\nbut I have to look out for myself.\"\n\n\"What does all this mean?\"\n\n\"You would ask me, you know. I am bothered out of my life by ever so\nmany things, and now he comes and adds his botheration.\"\n\n\"What bothers you, Gerard? If anything bothers you, surely you will\ntell me. If there has been anything to trouble you since you saw your\nfather why have you not written and told me? Is your trouble about\nme?\"\n\n\"Well, of course it is, in a sort of way.\"\n\n\"I will not be a trouble to you.\"\n\n\"Now you are going to misunderstand me! Of course, you are not a\ntrouble to me. You know that I love you better than anything in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\" Then he put his arm round her waist and pressed her\nto his bosom. \"But what can a man do? When Lady Chiltern recommended\nthat I should go to my father and tell him, I did it. I knew that no\ngood could come of it. He wouldn't lift his hand to do anything for\nme.\"\n\n\"How horrid that is!\"\n\n\"He thinks it a shame that I should have my uncle's money, though he\nnever had any more right to it than that man out there. He is always\nsaying that I am better off than he is.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are.\"\n\n\"I am very badly off, I know that. People seem to think that \u00c2\u00a3800 is\never so much, but I find it to be very little.\"\n\n\"And it will be much less if you are married,\" said Adelaide gravely.\n\n\"Of course, everything must be changed. I must sell my horses, and we\nmust cut and run, and go and live at Boulogne, I suppose. But a man\ncan't do that kind of thing all in a moment. Then Chiltern comes and\ntalks as though he were Virtue personified. What business is it of\nhis?\"\n\nThen Adelaide became still more grave. She had now removed herself\nfrom his embrace, and was standing a little apart from him on the\nrug. She did not answer him at first; and when she did so, she spoke\nvery slowly. \"We have been rash, I fear; and have done what we have\ndone without sufficient thought.\"\n\n\"I don't say that at all.\"\n\n\"But I do. It does seem now that we have been imprudent.\" Then she\nsmiled as she completed her speech. \"There had better be no\nengagement between us.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Because it is quite clear that it has been a trouble to you rather\nthan a happiness.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't give it up for all the world.\"\n\n\"But it will be better. I had not thought about it as I should have\ndone. I did not understand that the prospect of marrying would make\nyou--so very poor. I see it now. You had better tell Lord Chiltern\nthat it is--done with, and I will tell her the same. It will be\nbetter; and I will go back to Italy at once.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. It is not done with, and it shall not be done with.\"\n\n\"Do you think I will marry the man I love when he tells me that\nby--marrying--me, he will be--banished to--Bou--logne? You had better\nsee Lord Chiltern; indeed you had.\" And then she walked out of the\nroom.\n\nThen came upon him at once a feeling that he had behaved badly; and\nyet he had been so generous, so full of intentions to be devoted and\ntrue! He had never for a moment thought of breaking off the match,\nand would not think of it now. He loved her better than ever, and\nwould live only with the intention of making her his wife. But he\ncertainly should not have talked to her of his poverty, nor should he\nhave mentioned Boulogne. And yet what should he have done? She would\ncross-question him about Lord Chiltern, and it was so essentially\nnecessary that he should make her understand his real condition. It\nhad all come from that man's unjustifiable interference,--as he would\nat once go and tell him. Of course he would marry Adelaide, but the\nmarriage must be delayed. Everybody waits twelve months before they\nare married; and why should she not wait? He was miserable because he\nknew that he had made her unhappy;--but the fault had been with Lord\nChiltern. He would speak his mind frankly to Chiltern, and then would\nexplain with loving tenderness to his Adelaide that they would still\nbe all in all to each other, but that a short year must elapse before\nhe could put his house in order for her. After that he would sell his\nhorses. That resolve was in itself so great that he did not think\nit necessary at the present moment to invent any more plans for the\nfuture. So he went out into the hall, took his hat, and marched off\nto the kennels.\n\nAt the kennels he found Lord Chiltern surrounded by the denizens of\nthe hunt. His huntsman, with the kennelman and feeder, and two whips,\nand old Doggett were all there, and the Master of the Hounds was in\nthe middle of his business. The dogs were divided by ages, as well\nas by sex, and were being brought out and examined. Old Doggett was\ngiving advice,--differing almost always from Cox, the huntsman, as\nto the propriety of keeping this hound or of cashiering that. Nose,\npace, strength, and docility were all questioned with an eagerness\nhardly known in any other business; and on each question Lord\nChiltern listened to everybody, and then decided with a single word.\nWhen he had once resolved, nothing further urged by any man then\ncould avail anything. Jove never was so autocratic, and certainly\nnever so much in earnest. From the look of Lord Chiltern's brow it\nalmost seemed as though this weight of empire must be too much for\nany mere man. Very little notice was taken of Gerard Maule when he\njoined the conclave, though it was felt in reference to him that he\nwas sufficiently staunch a friend to the hunt to be trusted with\nthe secrets of the kennel. Lord Chiltern merely muttered some words\nof greeting, and Cox lifted the old hunting-cap which he wore. For\nanother hour the conference was held. Those who have attended such\nmeetings know well that a morning on the flags is apt to be a long\naffair. Old Doggett, who had privileges, smoked a pipe, and Gerard\nMaule lit one cigar after another. But Lord Chiltern had become too\nthorough a man of business to smoke when so employed. At last the\nlast order was given,--Doggett snarled his last snarl,--and Cox\nuttered his last \"My lord.\" Then Gerard Maule and the Master left the\nhounds and walked home together.\n\nThe affair had been so long that Gerard had almost forgotten his\ngrievance. But now as they got out together upon the park, he\nremembered the tone of Adelaide's voice as she left him, and\nremembered also that, as matters stood at present, it was essentially\nnecessary that something should be said. \"I suppose I shall have to\ngo and see that woman,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"Do you mean Adelaide?\" asked Maule, in a tone of infinite surprise.\n\n\"I mean this new Duchess, who I'm told is to manage everything\nherself. That man Fothergill is going on with just the old game at\nTrumpeton.\"\n\n\"Is he, indeed? I was thinking of something else just at that moment.\nYou remember what you were saying about Miss Palliser last night.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well;--I don't think, you know, you had a right to speak as you\ndid.\"\n\nLord Chiltern almost flew at his companion, as he replied, \"I said\nnothing. I do say that when a man becomes engaged to a girl, he\nshould let her hear from him, so that they may know what each other\nis about.\"\n\n\"You hinted something about being her brother.\"\n\n\"Of course I did. If you mean well by her, as I hope you do, it can't\nfret you to think that she has got somebody to look after her till\nyou come in and take possession. It is the commonest thing in the\nworld when a girl is left all alone as she is.\"\n\n\"You seemed to make out that I wasn't treating her well.\"\n\n\"I said nothing of the kind, Maule; but if you ask me--\"\n\n\"I don't ask you anything.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. You come and find fault with me for speaking last night\nin the most good-natured way in the world. And, therefore, I tell you\nnow that you will be behaving very badly indeed, unless you make some\narrangement at once as to what you mean to do.\"\n\n\"That's your opinion,\" said Gerard Maule.\n\n\"Yes, it is; and you'll find it to be the opinion of any man or woman\nthat you may ask who knows anything about such things. And I'll tell\nyou what, Master Maule, if you think you're going to face me down\nyou'll find yourself mistaken. Stop a moment, and just listen to me.\nYou haven't a much better friend than I am, and I'm sure she hasn't a\nbetter friend than my wife. All this has taken place under our roof,\nand I mean to speak my mind plainly. What do you propose to do about\nyour marriage?\"\n\n\"I don't propose to tell you what I mean to do.\"\n\n\"Will you tell Miss Palliser,--or my wife?\"\n\n\"That is just as I may think fit.\"\n\n\"Then I must tell you that you cannot meet her at my house.\"\n\n\"I'll leave it to-day.\"\n\n\"You needn't do that either. You sleep on it, and then make up your\nmind. You can't suppose that I have any curiosity about it. The girl\nis fond of you, and I suppose that you are fond of her. Don't quarrel\nfor nothing. If I have offended you, speak to Lady Chiltern about\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well;--I will speak to Lady Chiltern.\"\n\nWhen they reached the house it was clear that something was wrong.\nMiss Palliser was not seen again before dinner, and Lady Chiltern was\ngrave and very cold in her manner to Gerard Maule. He was left alone\nall the afternoon, which he passed with his horses and groom, smoking\nmore cigars,--but thinking all the time of Adelaide Palliser's last\nwords, of Lord Chiltern's frown, and of Lady Chiltern's manner to\nhim. When he came into the drawing-room before dinner, Lady Chiltern\nand Adelaide were both there, and Adelaide immediately began to ask\nquestions about the kennel and the huntsmen. But she studiously\nkept at a distance from him, and he himself felt that it would be\nimpossible to resume at present the footing on which he stood with\nthem both on the previous evening. Presently Lord Chiltern came in,\nand another man and his wife who had come to stay at Harrington.\nNothing could be more dull than the whole evening. At least so Gerard\nfound it. He did take Adelaide in to dinner, but he did not sit next\nto her at table, for which, however, there was an excuse, as, had\nhe done so, the new-comer must have been placed by his wife. He was\ncross, and would not make an attempt to speak to his neighbour, and,\nthough he tried once or twice to talk to Lady Chiltern--than whom,\nas a rule, no woman was ever more easy in conversation--he failed\naltogether. Now and again he strove to catch Adelaide's eye, but even\nin that he could not succeed. When the ladies left the room Chiltern\nand the new-comer--who was not a sporting man, and therefore did not\nunderstand the question--became lost in the mazes of Trumpeton Wood.\nBut Gerard Maule did not put in a word; nor was a word addressed to\nhim by Lord Chiltern. As he sat there sipping his wine, he made up\nhis mind that he would leave Harrington Hall the next morning. When\nhe was again in the drawing-room, things were conducted in just the\nsame way. He spoke to Adelaide, and she answered him; but there\nwas no word of encouragement--not a tone of comfort in her voice.\nHe found himself driven to attempt conversation with the strange\nlady, and at last was made to play whist with Lady Chiltern and the\ntwo new-comers. Later on in the evening, when Adelaide had gone\nto her own chamber, he was invited by Lady Chiltern into her own\nsitting-room upstairs, and there the whole thing was explained to\nhim. Miss Palliser had declared that the match should be broken off.\n\n\"Do you mean altogether, Lady Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do. Such a resolve cannot be a half-and-half\narrangement.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I think you must know why, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"I don't in the least. I won't have it broken off. I have as much\nright to have a voice in the matter as she has, and I don't in the\nleast believe it's her doing.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maule!\"\n\n\"I do not care; I must speak out. Why does she not tell me so\nherself?\"\n\n\"She did tell you so.\"\n\n\"No, she didn't. She said something, but not that. I don't suppose\na man was ever so used before; and it's all Lord Chiltern;--just\nbecause I told him that he had no right to interfere with me. And he\nhas no right.\"\n\n\"You and Oswald were away together when she told me that she had made\nup her mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since you have been in\nthe house. He certainly has not spoken to her about you since you\ncame to us.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of it, then?\"\n\n\"You told her that your engagement had overwhelmed you with\ntroubles.\"\n\n\"Of course; there must be troubles.\"\n\n\"And that--you would have to be banished to Boulogne when you were\nmarried.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean her to take that literally.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a nice way, Mr. Maule, to speak of your future life to the\ngirl to whom you were engaged. Of course it was her hope to make your\nlife happier, not less happy. And when you made her understand--as\nyou did very plainly--that your married prospects filled you with\ndismay, of course she had no other alternative but to retreat from\nher engagement.\"\n\n\"I wasn't dismayed.\"\n\n\"It is not my doing, Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"I suppose she'll see me?\"\n\n\"If you insist upon it she will; but she would rather not.\"\n\nGerard, however, did insist, and Adelaide was brought to him there\ninto that room before he went to bed. She was very gentle with him,\nand spoke to him in a tone very different from that which Lady\nChiltern had used; but he found himself utterly powerless to change\nher. That unfortunate allusion to a miserable exile at Boulogne had\ncompleted the work which the former plaints had commenced, and had\ndriven her to a resolution to separate herself from him altogether.\n\n\"Mr. Maule,\" she said, \"when I perceived that our proposed marriage\nwas looked upon by you as a misfortune, I could do nothing but put\nan end to our engagement.\"\n\n\"But I didn't think it a misfortune.\"\n\n\"You made me think that it would be unfortunate for you, and that is\nquite as strong a reason. I hope we shall part as friends.\"\n\n\"I won't part at all,\" he said, standing his ground with his back to\nthe fire. \"I don't understand it, by heaven I don't. Because I said\nsome stupid thing about Boulogne, all in joke--\"\n\n\"It was not in joke when you said that troubles had come heavy on you\nsince you were engaged.\"\n\n\"A man may be allowed to know, himself, whether he was in joke or\nnot. I suppose the truth is you don't care about me?\"\n\n\"I hope, Mr. Maule, that in time it may come--not quite to that.\"\n\n\"I think that you are--using me very badly. I think that you\nare--behaving--falsely to me. I think that I am--very--shamefully\ntreated--among you. Of course I shall go. Of course I shall not stay\nin this house. A man can't make a girl keep her promise. No--I won't\nshake hands. I won't even say good-bye to you. Of course I shall go.\"\nSo saying he slammed the door behind him.\n\n\"If he cares for you he'll come back to you,\" Lady Chiltern said to\nAdelaide that night, who at the moment was lying on her bed in a sad\ncondition, frantic with headache.\n\n\"I don't want him to come back; I will never make him go to\nBoulogne.\"\n\n\"Don't think of it, dear.\"\n\n\"Not think of it! how can I help thinking of it? I shall always think\nof it. But I never want to see him again--never! How can I want to\nmarry a man who tells me that I shall be a trouble to him? He shall\nnever,--never have to go to Boulogne for me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nTHE SECOND THUNDERBOLT.\n\n\nThe quarrel between Phineas Finn and Mr. Bonteen had now become the\ntalk of the town, and had taken many various phases. The political\nphase, though it was perhaps the best understood, was not the most\nengrossing. There was the personal phase,--which had reference to the\ndirect altercation that had taken place between the two gentlemen,\nand to the correspondence between them which had followed, as to\nwhich phase it may be said that though there were many rumours\nabroad, very little was known. It was reported in some circles that\nthe two aspirants for office had been within an ace of striking\neach other; in some, again, that a blow had passed,--and in others,\nfurther removed probably from the House of Commons and the Universe\nClub, that the Irishman had struck the Englishman, and that the\nEnglishman had given the Irishman a thrashing. This was a phase\nthat was very disagreeable to Phineas Finn. And there was a third,\n--which may perhaps be called the general social phase, and which\nunfortunately dealt with the name of Lady Laura Kennedy. They all,\nof course, worked into each other, and were enlivened and made\ninteresting with the names of a great many big persons. Mr. Gresham,\nthe Prime Minister, was supposed to be very much concerned in this\nmatter. He, it was said, had found himself compelled to exclude\nPhineas Finn from the Government, because of the unfortunate alliance\nbetween him and the wife of one of his late colleagues, and had also\nthought it expedient to dismiss Mr. Bonteen from his Cabinet,--for\nit had amounted almost to dismissal,--because Mr. Bonteen had made\nindiscreet official allusion to that alliance. In consequence of this\nworking in of the first and third phase, Mr. Gresham encountered\nhard usage from some friends and from many enemies. Then, of course,\nthe scene at Macpherson's Hotel was commented on very generally. An\nidea prevailed that Mr. Kennedy, driven to madness by his wife's\ninfidelity, which had become known to him through the quarrel between\nPhineas and Mr. Bonteen,--had endeavoured to murder his wife's lover,\nwho had with the utmost effrontery invaded the injured husband's\npresence with a view of deterring him by threats from a publication\nof his wrongs. This murder had been nearly accomplished in the centre\nof the metropolis,--by daylight, as if that made it worse,--on a\nSunday, which added infinitely to the delightful horror of the\ncatastrophe; and yet no public notice had been taken of it! The\nwould-be murderer had been a Cabinet Minister, and the lover who was\nso nearly murdered had been an Under-Secretary of State, and was even\nnow a member of Parliament. And then it was positively known that the\nlady's father, who had always been held in the highest respect as\na nobleman, favoured his daughter's lover, and not his daughter's\nhusband. All which things together filled the public with dismay, and\ncaused a delightful excitement, giving quite a feature of its own to\nthe season.\n\nNo doubt general opinion was adverse to poor Phineas Finn, but he was\nnot without his party in the matter. To oblige a friend by inflicting\nan injury on his enemy is often more easy than to confer a benefit on\nthe friend himself. We have already seen how the young Duchess failed\nin her attempt to obtain an appointment for Phineas, and also how\nshe succeeded in destroying the high hopes of Mr. Bonteen. Having\ndone so much, of course she clung heartily to the side which she\nhad adopted;--and, equally of course, Madame Goesler did the same.\nBetween these two ladies there was a slight difference of opinion as\nto the nature of the alliance between Lady Laura and their hero. The\nDuchess was of opinion that young men are upon the whole averse to\ninnocent alliances, and that, as Lady Laura and her husband certainly\nhad long been separated, there was probably--something in it. \"Lord\nbless you, my dear,\" the Duchess said, \"they were known to be\nlovers when they were at Loughlinter together before she married Mr.\nKennedy. It has been the most romantic affair! She made her father\ngive him a seat for his borough.\"\n\n\"He saved Mr. Kennedy's life,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"That was one of the most singular things that ever happened.\nLaurence Fitzgibbon says that it was all planned,--that the garotters\nwere hired, but unfortunately two policemen turned up at the moment,\nso the men were taken. I believe there is no doubt they were pardoned\nby Sir Henry Coldfoot, who was at the Home Office, and was Lord\nBrentford's great friend. I don't quite believe it all,--it would be\ntoo delicious; but a great many do.\" Madame Goesler, however, was\nstrong in her opinion that the report in reference to Lady Laura was\nscandalous. She did not believe a word of it, and was almost angry\nwith the Duchess for her credulity.\n\nIt is probable that very many ladies shared the opinion of the\nDuchess; but not the less on that account did they take part with\nPhineas Finn. They could not understand why he should be shut out\nof office because a lady had been in love with him, and by no means\nseemed to approve the stern virtue of the Prime Minister. It was\nan interference with things which did not belong to him. And many\nasserted that Mr. Gresham was much given to such interference. Lady\nCantrip, though her husband was Mr. Gresham's most intimate friend,\nwas altogether of this party, as was also the Duchess of St. Bungay,\nwho understood nothing at all about it, but who had once fancied\nherself to be rudely treated by Mrs. Bonteen. The young Duchess was\na woman very strong in getting up a party; and the old Duchess, with\nmany other matrons of high rank, was made to believe that it was\nincumbent on her to be a Phineas Finnite. One result of this was,\nthat though Phineas was excluded from the Liberal Government, all\nLiberal drawing-rooms were open to him, and that he was a lion.\n\nAdditional zest was given to all this by the very indiscreet conduct\nof Mr. Bonteen. He did accept the inferior office of President of\nthe Board of Trade, an office inferior at least to that for which\nhe had been designated, and agreed to fill it without a seat in the\nCabinet. But having done so he could not bring himself to bear his\ndisappointment quietly. He could not work and wait and make himself\nagreeable to those around him, holding his vexation within his own\nbosom. He was dark and sullen to his chief, and almost insolent to\nthe Duke of Omnium. Our old friend Plantagenet Palliser was a man who\nhardly knew insolence when he met it. There was such an absence about\nhim of all self-consciousness, he was so little given to think of his\nown personal demeanour and outward trappings,--that he never brought\nhimself to question the manners of others to him. Contradiction he\nwould take for simple argument. Strong difference of opinion even on\nthe part of subordinates recommended itself to him. He could put up\nwith apparent rudeness without seeing it, and always gave men credit\nfor good intentions. And with it all he had an assurance in his own\nposition,--a knowledge of the strength derived from his intellect,\nhis industry, his rank, and his wealth,--which made him altogether\nfearless of others. When the little dog snarls, the big dog does\nnot connect the snarl with himself, simply fancying that the little\ndog must be uncomfortable. Mr. Bonteen snarled a good deal, and the\nnew Lord Privy Seal thought that the new President of the Board of\nTrade was not comfortable within himself. But at last the little\ndog took the big dog by the ear, and then the big dog put out his\npaw and knocked the little dog over. Mr. Bonteen was told that he\nhad--forgotten himself; and there arose new rumours. It was soon\nreported that the Lord Privy Seal had refused to work out decimal\ncoinage under the management, in the House of Commons, of the\nPresident of the Board of Trade.\n\nMr. Bonteen, in his troubled spirit, certainly did misbehave himself.\nAmong his closer friends he declared very loudly that he didn't mean\nto stand it. He had not chosen to throw Mr. Gresham over at once, or\nto make difficulties at the moment;--but he would not continue to\nhold his present position or to support the Government without a seat\nin the Cabinet. Palliser had become quite useless,--so Mr. Bonteen\nsaid,--since his accession to the dukedom, and was quite unfit to\ndeal with decimal coinage. It was a burden to kill any man, and he\nwas not going to kill himself,--at any rate without the reward for\nwhich he had been working all his life, and to which he was fully\nentitled, namely, a seat in the Cabinet. Now there were Bonteenites\nin those days as well as Phineas Finnites. The latter tribe was for\nthe most part feminine; but the former consisted of some half-dozen\nmembers of Parliament, who thought they saw their way in encouraging\nthe forlorn hope of the unhappy financier.\n\nA leader of a party is nothing without an organ, and an organ came\nforward to support Mr. Bonteen,--not very creditable to him as a\nLiberal, being a Conservative organ,--but not the less gratifying to\nhis spirit, inasmuch as the organ not only supported him, but exerted\nits very loudest pipes in abusing the man whom of all men he hated\nthe most. The People's Banner was the organ, and Mr. Quintus Slide\nwas, of course, the organist. The following was one of the tunes he\nplayed, and was supposed by himself to be a second thunderbolt, and\nprobably a conclusively crushing missile. This thunderbolt fell on\nMonday, the 3rd of May:--\n\n\n   Early in last March we found it to be our duty to bring\n   under public notice the conduct of the member for\n   Tankerville in reference to a transaction which took place\n   at a small hotel in Judd Street, and as to which we then\n   ventured to call for the interference of the police. An\n   attempt to murder the member for Tankerville had been made\n   by a gentleman once well known in the political world,\n   who,--as it is supposed,--had been driven to madness by\n   wrongs inflicted on him in his dearest and nearest family\n   relations. That the unfortunate gentleman is now insane we\n   believe we may state as a fact. It had become our special\n   duty to refer to this most discreditable transaction,\n   from the fact that a paper, still in our hands, had been\n   confided to us for publication by the wretched husband\n   before his senses had become impaired,--which, however, we\n   were debarred from giving to the public by an injunction\n   served upon us in sudden haste by the Vice-Chancellor. We\n   are far from imputing evil motives, or even indiscretion,\n   to that functionary; but we are of opinion that the moral\n   feeling of the country would have been served by the\n   publication, and we are sure that undue steps were taken\n   by the member for Tankerville to procure that injunction.\n\n   No inquiries whatever were made by the police in reference\n   to that attempt at murder, and we do expect that some\n   member will ask a question on the subject in the House.\n   Would such culpable quiescence have been allowed had\n   not the unfortunate lady whose name we are unwilling to\n   mention been the daughter of one of the colleagues of our\n   present Prime Minister, the gentleman who fired the pistol\n   another of them, and the presumed lover, who was fired at,\n   also another? We think that we need hardly answer that\n   question.\n\n   One piece of advice which we ventured to give Mr. Gresham\n   in our former article he has been wise enough to follow.\n   We took upon ourselves to tell him that if, after what has\n   occurred, he ventured to place the member for Tankerville\n   again in office, the country would not stand it;--and he\n   has abstained. The jaunty footsteps of Mr. Phineas Finn\n   are not heard ascending the stairs of any office at about\n   two in the afternoon, as used to be the case in one of\n   those blessed Downing Street abodes about three years\n   since. That scandal is, we think, over,--and for ever. The\n   good-looking Irish member of Parliament who had been put\n   in possession of a handsome salary by feminine influences,\n   will not, we think, after what we have already said, again\n   become a burden on the public purse. But we cannot say\n   that we are as yet satisfied in this matter, or that we\n   believe that the public has got to the bottom of it,--as\n   it has a right to do in reference to all matters affecting\n   the public service. We have never yet learned why it is\n   that Mr. Bonteen, after having been nominated Chancellor\n   of the Exchequer,--for the appointment to that office\n   was declared in the House of Commons by the head of his\n   party,--was afterwards excluded from the Cabinet, and\n   placed in an office made peculiarly subordinate by the\n   fact of that exclusion. We have never yet been told why\n   this was done;--but we believe that we are justified in\n   saying that it was managed through the influence of the\n   member for Tankerville; and we are quite sure that the\n   public service of the country has thereby been subjected\n   to grievous injury.\n\n   It is hardly our duty to praise any of that very awkward\n   team of horses which Mr. Gresham drives with an audacity\n   which may atone for his incapacity if no fearful accident\n   should be the consequence; but if there be one among them\n   whom we could trust for steady work up hill, it is Mr.\n   Bonteen. We were astounded at Mr. Gresham's indiscretion\n   in announcing the appointment of his new Chancellor of the\n   Exchequer some weeks before he had succeeded in driving\n   Mr. Daubeny from office;--but we were not the less glad to\n   find that the finances of the country were to be entrusted\n   to the hands of the most competent gentleman whom\n   Mr. Gresham has induced to follow his fortunes. But\n   Mr. Phineas Finn, with his female forces, has again\n   interfered, and Mr. Bonteen has been relegated to the\n   Board of Trade, without a seat in the Cabinet. We should\n   not be at all surprised if, as the result of this\n   disgraceful manoeuvring, Mr. Bonteen found himself at\n   the head of the Liberal party before the Session be over.\n   If so, evil would have worked to good. But, be that as\n   it may, we cannot but feel that it is a disgrace to the\n   Government, a disgrace to Parliament, and a disgrace to\n   the country that such results should come from the private\n   scandals of two or three people among us by no means of\n   the best class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE BROWBOROUGH TRIAL.\n\n\nThere was another matter of public interest going on at this time\nwhich created a great excitement. And this, too, added to the\nimportance of Phineas Finn, though Phineas was not the hero of the\npiece. Mr. Browborough, the late member for Tankerville, was tried\nfor bribery. It will be remembered that when Phineas contested the\nborough in the autumn, this gentleman was returned. He was afterwards\nunseated, as the result of a petition before the judge, and Phineas\nwas declared to be the true member. The judge who had so decided had\nreported to the Speaker that further inquiry before a commission into\nthe practices of the late and former elections at Tankerville would\nbe expedient, and such commission had sat in the months of January\nand February. Half the voters in Tankerville had been examined, and\nmany who were not voters. The commissioners swept very clean, being\nnew brooms, and in their report recommended that Mr. Browborough,\nwhom they had themselves declined to examine, should be prosecuted.\nThat report was made about the end of March, when Mr. Daubeny's\ngreat bill was impending. Then there arose a double feeling about\nMr. Browborough, who had been regarded by many as a model member of\nParliament, a man who never spoke, constant in his attendance, who\nwanted nothing, who had plenty of money, who gave dinners, to whom a\nseat in Parliament was the be-all and the end-all of life. It could\nnot be the wish of any gentleman, who had been accustomed to his slow\nstep in the lobbies, and his burly form always quiescent on one of\nthe upper seats just below the gangway on the Conservative side of\nthe House, that such a man should really be punished. When the new\nlaws regarding bribery came to take that shape the hearts of members\nrevolted from the cruelty,--the hearts even of members on the other\nside of the House. As long as a seat was in question the battle\nshould of course be fought to the nail. Every kind of accusation\nmight then be lavished without restraint, and every evil practice\nimputed. It had been known to all the world,--known as a thing that\nwas a matter of course,--that at every election Mr. Browborough had\nbought his seat. How should a Browborough get a seat without buying\nit,--a man who could not say ten words, of no family, with no natural\nfollowing in any constituency, distinguished by no zeal in politics,\nentertaining no special convictions of his own? How should such a\none recommend himself to any borough unless he went there with money\nin his hand? Of course, he had gone to Tankerville with money in\nhis hand, with plenty of money, and had spent it--like a gentleman.\nCollectively the House of Commons had determined to put down\nbribery with a very strong hand. Nobody had spoken against bribery\nwith more fervour than Sir Gregory Grogram, who had himself, as\nAttorney-General, forged the chains for fettering future bribers. He\nwas now again Attorney-General, much to his disgust, as Mr. Gresham\nhad at the last moment found it wise to restore Lord Weazeling to the\nwoolsack; and to his hands was to be entrusted the prosecution of Mr.\nBrowborough. But it was observed by many that the job was not much to\nhis taste. The House had been very hot against bribery,--and certain\nmembers of the existing Government, when the late Bill had been\npassed, had expressed themselves with almost burning indignation\nagainst the crime. But, through it all, there had been a slight\nundercurrent of ridicule attaching itself to the question of which\nonly they who were behind the scenes were conscious. The House was\nbound to let the outside world know that all corrupt practices at\nelections were held to be abominable by the House; but Members of the\nHouse, as individuals, knew very well what had taken place at their\nown elections, and were aware of the cheques which they had drawn.\nPublic-houses had been kept open as a matter of course, and nowhere\nperhaps had more beer been drunk than at Clovelly, the borough\nfor which Sir Gregory Grogram sat. When it came to be a matter of\nindividual prosecution against one whom they had all known, and\nwho, as a member, had been inconspicuous and therefore inoffensive,\nagainst a heavy, rich, useful man who had been in nobody's way, many\nthought that it would amount to persecution. The idea of putting\nold Browborough into prison for conduct which habit had made second\nnature to a large proportion of the House was distressing to Members\nof Parliament generally. The recommendation for this prosecution was\nmade to the House when Mr. Daubeny was in the first agonies of his\ngreat Bill, and he at once resolved to ignore the matter altogether,\nat any rate for the present. If he was to be driven out of power\nthere could be no reason why his Attorney-General should prosecute\nhis own ally and follower,--a poor, faithful creature, who had never\nin his life voted against his party, and who had always been willing\nto accept as his natural leader any one whom his party might select.\nBut there were many who had felt that as Mr. Browborough must\ncertainly now be prosecuted sooner or later,--for there could be no\nfinal neglecting of the Commissioners' report,--it would be better\nthat he should be dealt with by natural friends than by natural\nenemies. The newspapers, therefore, had endeavoured to hurry the\nmatter on, and it had been decided that the trial should take place\nat the Durham Spring Assizes, in the first week of May. Sir Gregory\nGrogram became Attorney-General in the middle of April, and he\nundertook the task upon compulsion. Mr. Browborough's own friends,\nand Mr. Browborough himself, declared very loudly that there would\nbe the greatest possible cruelty in postponing the trial. His\nlawyers thought that his best chance lay in bustling the thing on,\nand were therefore able to show that the cruelty of delay would\nbe extreme,--nay, that any postponement in such a matter would be\nunconstitutional, if not illegal. It would, of course, have been just\nas easy to show that hurry on the part of the prosecutor was cruel,\nand illegal, and unconstitutional, had it been considered that the\nbest chance of acquittal lay in postponement.\n\nAnd so the trial was forced forward, and Sir Gregory himself was to\nappear on behalf of the prosecuting House of Commons. There could be\nno doubt that the sympathies of the public generally were with Mr.\nBrowborough, though there was as little doubt that he was guilty.\nWhen the evidence taken by the Commissioners had just appeared in\nthe newspapers,--when first the facts of this and other elections at\nTankerville were made public, and the world was shown how common it\nhad been for Mr. Browborough to buy votes,--how clearly the knowledge\nof the corruption had been brought home to himself,--there had for\na short week or so been a feeling against him. Two or three London\npapers had printed leading articles, giving in detail the salient\npoints of the old sinner's criminality, and expressing a conviction\nthat now, at least, would the real criminal be punished. But this\nhad died away, and the anger against Mr. Browborough, even on\nthe part of the most virtuous of the public press, had become no\nmore than lukewarm. Some papers boldly defended him, ridiculed\nthe Commissioners, and declared that the trial was altogether\nan absurdity. The People's Banner, setting at defiance with an\nadmirable audacity all the facts as given in the Commissioners'\nreport, declared that there was not one tittle of evidence against\nMr. Browborough, and hinted that the trial had been got up by\nthe malign influence of that doer of all evil, Phineas Finn. But\nmen who knew better what was going on in the world than did Mr.\nQuintus Slide, were well aware that such assertions as these were\nboth unavailing and unnecessary. Mr. Browborough was believed\nto be quite safe; but his safety lay in the indifference of his\nprosecutors,--certainly not in his innocence. Any one prominent in\naffairs can always see when a man may steal a horse and when a man\nmay not look over a hedge. Mr. Browborough had stolen his horse, and\nhad repeated the theft over and over again. The evidence of it all\nwas forthcoming,--had, indeed, been already sifted. But Sir Gregory\nGrogram, who was prominent in affairs, knew that the theft might be\ncondoned.\n\nNevertheless, the case came on at the Durham Assizes. Within the\nlast two months Browborough had become quite a hero at Tankerville.\nThe Church party had forgotten his broken pledges, and the Radicals\nremembered only his generosity. Could he have stood for the seat\nagain on the day on which the judges entered Durham, he might have\nbeen returned without bribery. Throughout the whole county the\nprosecution was unpopular. During no portion of his Parliamentary\ncareer had Mr. Browborough's name been treated with so much respect\nin the grandly ecclesiastical city as now. He dined with the Dean on\nthe day before the trial, and on the Sunday was shown by the head\nverger into the stall next to the Chancellor of the Diocese, with a\nreverence which seemed to imply that he was almost as graceful as\na martyr. When he took his seat in the Court next to his attorney,\neverybody shook hands with him. When Sir Gregory got up to open his\ncase, not one of the listeners then supposed that Mr. Browborough\nwas about to suffer any punishment. He was arraigned before Mr.\nBaron Boultby, who had himself sat for a borough in his younger\ndays, and who knew well how things were done. We are all aware how\nimpassionately grand are the minds of judges, when men accused of\ncrimes are brought before them for trial; but judges after all are\nmen, and Mr. Baron Boultby, as he looked at Mr. Browborough, could\nnot but have thought of the old days.\n\nIt was nevertheless necessary that the prosecution should be\nconducted in a properly formal manner, and that all the evidence\nshould be given. There was a cloud of witnesses over from\nTankerville,--miners, colliers, and the like,--having a very good\nturn of it at the expense of the poor borough. All these men must be\nexamined, and their evidence would no doubt be the same now as when\nit was given with so damnable an effect before those clean-sweeping\nCommissioners. Sir Gregory's opening speech was quite worthy of Sir\nGregory. It was essentially necessary, he said, that the atmosphere\nof our boroughs should be cleansed and purified from the taint of\ncorruption. The voice of the country had spoken very plainly on the\nsubject, and a verdict had gone forth that there should be no more\nbribery at elections. At the last election at Tankerville, and, as he\nfeared, at some former elections, there had been manifest bribery. It\nwould be for the jury to decide whether Mr. Browborough himself had\nbeen so connected with the acts of his agents as to be himself within\nthe reach of the law. If it were found that he had brought himself\nwithin the reach of the law, the jury would no doubt say so, and in\nsuch case would do great service to the cause of purity; but if Mr.\nBrowborough had not been personally cognisant of what his agents\nhad done, then the jury would be bound to acquit him. A man was not\nnecessarily guilty of bribery in the eye of the law because bribery\nhad been committed, even though the bribery so committed had been\nsufficiently proved to deprive him of the seat which he would\notherwise have enjoyed. Nothing could be clearer than the manner in\nwhich Sir Gregory explained it all to the jury; nothing more eloquent\nthan his denunciations against bribery in general; nothing more mild\nthan his allegations against Mr. Browborough individually.\n\nIn regard to the evidence Sir Gregory, with his two assistants, went\nthrough his work manfully. The evidence was given,--not to the same\nlength as at Tankerville before the Commissioners,--but really to\nthe same effect. But yet the record of the evidence as given in the\nnewspapers seemed to be altogether different. At Tankerville there\nhad been an indignant and sometimes an indiscreet zeal which had\ncommunicated itself to the whole proceedings. The general flavour\nof the trial at Durham was one of good-humoured raillery. Mr.\nBrowborough's counsel in cross-examining the witnesses for the\nprosecution displayed none of that righteous wrath,--wrath righteous\non behalf of injured innocence,--which is so common with gentlemen\nemployed in the defence of criminals; but bowed and simpered, and\nnodded at Sir Gregory in a manner that was quite pleasant to behold.\nNobody scolded anybody. There was no roaring of barristers, no\nclenching of fists and kicking up of dust, no threats, no allusions\nto witnesses' oaths. A considerable amount of gentle fun was poked\nat the witnesses by the defending counsel, but not in a manner to\ngive any pain. Gentlemen who acknowledged to have received seventeen\nshillings and sixpence for their votes at the last election were\nasked how they had invested their money. Allusions were made to their\nwives, and a large amount of good-humoured sparring was allowed, in\nwhich the witnesses thought that they had the best of it. The men\nof Tankerville long remembered this trial, and hoped anxiously that\nthere might soon be another. The only man treated with severity was\npoor Phineas Finn, and luckily for himself he was not present. His\nqualifications as member of Parliament for Tankerville were somewhat\nroughly treated. Each witness there, when he was asked what candidate\nwould probably be returned for Tankerville at the next election,\nreadily answered that Mr. Browborough would certainly carry the seat.\nMr. Browborough sat in the Court throughout it all, and was the hero\nof the day.\n\nThe judge's summing up was very short, and seemed to have been given\nalmost with indolence. The one point on which he insisted was the\ndifference between such evidence of bribery as would deprive a man\nof his seat, and that which would make him subject to the criminal\nlaw. By the criminal law a man could not be punished for the acts\nof another. Punishment must follow a man's own act. If a man were\nto instigate another to murder he would be punished, not for the\nmurder, but for the instigation. They were now administering the\ncriminal law, and they were bound to give their verdict for an\nacquittal unless they were convinced that the man on his trial had\nhimself,--wilfully and wittingly,--been guilty of the crime imputed.\nHe went through the evidence, which was in itself clear against the\nold sinner, and which had been in no instance validly contradicted,\nand then left the matter to the jury. The men in the box put their\nheads together, and returned a verdict of acquittal without one\nmoment's delay. Sir Gregory Grogram and his assistants collected\ntheir papers together. The judge addressed three or four words almost\nof compliment to Mr. Browborough, and the affair was over, to the\nmanifest contentment of every one there present. Sir Gregory Grogram\nwas by no means disappointed, and everybody, on his own side in\nParliament and on the other, thought that he had done his duty very\nwell. The clean-sweeping Commissioners, who had been animated with\nwonderful zeal by the nature and novelty of their work, probably felt\nthat they had been betrayed, but it may be doubted whether any one\nelse was disconcerted by the result of the trial, unless it might be\nsome poor innocents here and there about the country who had been\ninduced to believe that bribery and corruption were in truth to be\nbanished from the purlieus of Westminster.\n\nMr. Roby and Mr. Ratler, who filled the same office each for his own\nparty, in and out, were both acquainted with each other, and apt to\ndiscuss parliamentary questions in the library and smoking-room of\nthe House, where such discussions could be held on most matters.\n\"I was very glad that the case went as it did at Durham,\" said Mr.\nRatler.\n\n\"And so am I,\" said Mr. Roby. \"Browborough was always a good fellow.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it; and no good could have come from a conviction.\nI suppose there has been a little money spent at Tankerville.\"\n\n\"And at other places one could mention,\" said Mr. Roby.\n\n\"Of course there has;--and money will be spent again. Nobody dislikes\nbribery more than I do. The House, of course, dislikes it. But if a\nman loses his seat, surely that is punishment enough.\"\n\n\"It's better to have to draw a cheque sometimes than to be out in the\ncold.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, members would prefer that their seats should not cost\nthem so much,\" continued Mr. Ratler. \"But the thing can't be done all\nat once. That idea of pouncing upon one man and making a victim of\nhim is very disagreeable to me. I should have been sorry to have seen\na verdict against Browborough. You must acknowledge that there was no\nbitterness in the way in which Grogram did it.\"\n\n\"We all feel that,\" said Mr. Roby,--who was, perhaps, by nature a\nlittle more candid than his rival,--\"and when the time comes no doubt\nwe shall return the compliment.\"\n\nThe matter was discussed in quite a different spirit between two\nother politicians. \"So Sir Gregory has failed at Durham,\" said Lord\nCantrip to his friend, Mr. Gresham.\n\n\"I was sure he would.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Ah;--why? How am I to answer such a question? Did you think that Mr.\nBrowborough would be convicted of bribery by a jury?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" answered Lord Cantrip.\n\n\"And can you tell me why?\"\n\n\"Because there was no earnestness in the matter,--either with the\nAttorney-General or with any one else.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"Grogram is a very earnest man when he\nbelieves in his case. No member of Parliament will ever be punished\nfor bribery as for a crime till members of Parliament generally look\nupon bribery as a crime. We are very far from that as yet. I should\nhave thought a conviction to be a great misfortune.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it would have created ill blood, and our own hands in this\nmatter are not a bit cleaner than those of our adversaries. We\ncan't afford to pull their houses to pieces before we have put our\nown in order. The thing will be done; but it must, I fear, be done\nslowly,--as is the case with all reforms from within.\"\n\nPhineas Finn, who was very sore and unhappy at this time, and who\nconsequently was much in love with purity and anxious for severity,\nfelt himself personally aggrieved by the acquittal. It was almost\ntantamount to a verdict against himself. And then he knew so well\nthat bribery had been committed, and was so confident that such a one\nas Mr. Browborough could have been returned to Parliament by none\nother than corrupt means! In his present mood he would have been\nalmost glad to see Mr. Browborough at the treadmill, and would have\nthought six months' solitary confinement quite inadequate to the\noffence. \"I never read anything in my life that disgusted me so\nmuch,\" he said to his friend, Mr. Monk.\n\n\"I can't go along with you there.\"\n\n\"If any man ever was guilty of bribery, he was guilty!\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it for a moment.\"\n\n\"And yet Grogram did not try to get a verdict.\"\n\n\"Had he tried ever so much he would have failed. In a matter such as\nthat,--political and not social in its nature,--a jury is sure to\nbe guided by what it has, perhaps unconsciously, learned to be the\nfeeling of the country. No disgrace is attached to their verdict, and\nyet everybody knows that Mr. Browborough had bribed, and all those\nwho have looked into it know, too, that the evidence was conclusive.\"\n\n\"Then are the jury all perjured,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"I have nothing to say to that. No stain of perjury clings to them.\nThey are better received in Durham to-day than they would have been\nhad they found Mr. Browborough guilty. In business, as in private\nlife, they will be held to be as trustworthy as before;--and they\nwill be, for aught that we know, quite trustworthy. There are still\ncircumstances in which a man, though on his oath, may be untrue with\nno more stain of falsehood than falls upon him when he denies himself\nat his front door though he happen to be at home.\"\n\n\"What must we think of such a condition of things, Mr. Monk?\"\n\n\"That it's capable of improvement. I do not know that we can think\nanything else. As for Sir Gregory Grogram and Baron Boultby and the\njury, it would be waste of power to execrate them. In political\nmatters it is very hard for a man in office to be purer than his\nneighbours,--and, when he is so, he becomes troublesome. I have found\nthat out before to-day.\"\n\nWith Lady Laura Kennedy, Phineas did find some sympathy;--but then\nshe would have sympathised with him on any subject under the sun. If\nhe would only come to her and sit with her she would fool him to the\ntop of his bent. He had resolved that he would go to Portman Square\nas little as possible, and had been confirmed in that resolution\nby the scandal which had now spread everywhere about the town in\nreference to himself and herself. But still he went. He never left\nher till some promise of returning at some stated time had been\nextracted from him. He had even told her of his own scruples and of\nher danger,--and they had discussed together that last thunderbolt\nwhich had fallen from the Jove of The People's Banner. But she had\nlaughed his caution to scorn. Did she not know herself and her own\ninnocence? Was she not living in her father's house, and with her\nfather? Should she quail beneath the stings and venom of such a\nreptile as Quintus Slide? \"Oh, Phineas,\" she said, \"let us be braver\nthan that.\" He would much prefer to have stayed away,--but still he\nwent to her. He was conscious of her dangerous love for him. He knew\nwell that it was not returned. He was aware that it would be best for\nboth that he should be apart. But yet he could not bring himself to\nwound her by his absence. \"I do not see why you should feel it so\nmuch,\" she said, speaking of the trial at Durham.\n\n\"We were both on our trial,--he and I.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows that he bribed and that you did not.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and everybody despises me and pats him on the back. I am sick\nof the whole thing. There is no honesty in the life we lead.\"\n\n\"You got your seat at any rate.\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart that I had never seen the dirty wretched\nplace,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, Phineas, do not say that.\"\n\n\"But I do say it. Of what use is the seat to me? If I could only feel\nthat any one knew--\"\n\n\"Knew what, Phineas?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I understand. I know that you have meant to be honest, while this\nman has always meant to be dishonest. I know that you have intended\nto serve your country, and have wished to work for it. But you cannot\nexpect that it should all be roses.\"\n\n\"Roses! The nosegays which are worn down at Westminster are made of\ngarlick and dandelions!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nSOME PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF MR. EMILIUS.\n\n\nThe writer of this chronicle is not allowed to imagine that any of\nhis readers have read the wonderful and vexatious adventures of Lady\nEustace, a lady of good birth, of high rank, and of large fortune,\nwho, but a year or two since, became almost a martyr to a diamond\nnecklace which was stolen from her. With her history the present\nreader has but small concern, but it may be necessary that he should\nknow that the lady in question, who had been a widow with many\nsuitors, at last gave her hand and her fortune to a clergyman whose\nname was Joseph Emilius. Mr. Emilius, though not an Englishman by\nbirth,--and, as was supposed, a Bohemian Jew in the earlier days of\nhis career,--had obtained some reputation as a preacher in London,\nand had moved,--if not in fashionable circles,--at any rate in\ncircles so near to fashion as to be brought within the reach of Lady\nEustace's charms. They were married, and for some few months Mr.\nEmilius enjoyed a halcyon existence, the delights of which were,\nperhaps, not materially marred by the necessity which he felt of\nsubjecting his young wife to marital authority. \"My dear,\" he would\nsay, \"you will know me better soon, and then things will be smooth.\"\nIn the meantime he drew more largely upon her money than was pleasing\nto her and to her friends, and appeared to have requirements for\ncash which were both secret and unlimited. At the end of twelve\nmonths Lady Eustace had run away from him, and Mr. Emilius had made\novertures, by accepting which his wife would be enabled to purchase\nhis absence at the cost of half her income. The arrangement was not\nregarded as being in every respect satisfactory, but Lady Eustace\ndeclared passionately that any possible sacrifice would be preferable\nto the company of Mr. Emilius. There had, however, been a rumour\nbefore her marriage that there was still living in his old country a\nMrs. Emilius when he married Lady Eustace; and, though it had been\nsupposed by those who were most nearly concerned with Lady Eustace\nthat this report had been unfounded and malicious, nevertheless, when\nthe man's claims became so exorbitant, reference was again made to\nthe charge of bigamy. If it could be proved that Mr. Emilius had a\nwife living in Bohemia, a cheaper mode of escape would be found for\nthe persecuted lady than that which he himself had suggested.\n\nIt had happened that, since her marriage with Mr. Emilius, Lady\nEustace had become intimate with our Mr. Bonteen and his wife. She\nhad been at one time engaged to marry Lord Fawn, one of Mr. Bonteen's\ncolleagues, and during the various circumstances which had led to the\ndisruption of that engagement, this friendship had been formed. It\nmust be understood that Lady Eustace had a most desirable residence\nof her own in the country,--Portray Castle in Scotland,--and that\nit was thought expedient by many to cultivate her acquaintance.\nShe was rich, beautiful, and clever; and, though her marriage with\nMr. Emilius had never been looked upon as a success, still, in the\nestimation of some people, it added an interest to her career. The\nBonteens had taken her up, and now both Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen were\nhot in pursuit of evidence which might prove Mr. Emilius to be a\nbigamist.\n\nWhen the disruption of conjugal relations was commenced, Lady Eustace\nsucceeded in obtaining refuge at Portray Castle without the presence\nof her husband. She fled from London during a visit he made to\nBrighton with the object of preaching to a congregation by which his\neloquence was held in great esteem. He left London in one direction\nby the 5 P.M. express train on Saturday, and she in the other by the\nlimited mail at 8.45. A telegram, informing him of what had taken\nplace, reached him the next morning at Brighton while he was at\nbreakfast. He preached his sermon, charming the congregation by the\ngraces of his extempore eloquence,--moving every woman there to\ntears,--and then was after his wife before the ladies had taken their\nfirst glass of sherry at luncheon. But her ladyship had twenty-four\nhours' start of him,--although he did his best; and when he reached\nPortray Castle the door was shut in his face. He endeavoured to\nobtain the aid of blacksmiths to open, as he said, his own hall\ndoor,--to obtain the aid of constables to compel the blacksmiths, of\nmagistrates to compel the constables,--and even of a judge to compel\nthe magistrates; but he was met on every side by a statement that\nthe lady of the castle declared that she was not his wife, and that\ntherefore he had no right whatever to demand that the door should\nbe opened. Some other woman,--so he was informed that the lady\nsaid,--out in a strange country was really his wife. It was her\nintention to prove him to be a bigamist, and to have him locked up.\nIn the meantime she chose to lock herself up in her own mansion. Such\nwas the nature of the message that was delivered to him through the\nbars of the lady's castle.\n\nHow poor Lady Eustace was protected, and, at the same time, made\nmiserable by the energy and unrestrained language of one of her\nown servants, Andrew Gowran by name, it hardly concerns us now to\ninquire. Mr. Emilius did not succeed in effecting an entrance; but he\nremained for some time in the neighbourhood, and had notices served\non the tenants in regard to the rents, which puzzled the poor folk\nround Portray Castle very much. After a while Lady Eustace, finding\nthat her peace and comfort imperatively demanded that she should\nprove the allegations which she had made, fled again from Portray\nCastle to London, and threw herself into the hands of the Bonteens.\nThis took place just as Mr. Bonteen's hopes in regard to the\nChancellorship of the Exchequer were beginning to soar high, and when\nhis hands were very full of business. But with that energy for which\nhe was so conspicuous, Mr. Bonteen had made a visit to Bohemia during\nhis short Christmas holidays, and had there set people to work. When\nat Prague he had, he thought, very nearly unravelled the secret\nhimself. He had found the woman whom he believed to be Mrs. Emilius,\nand who was now living somewhat merrily in Prague under another name.\nShe acknowledged that in old days, when they were both young, she\nhad been acquainted with a certain Yosef Mealyus, at a time in\nwhich he had been in the employment of a Jewish moneylender in the\ncity; but,--as she declared,--she had never been married to him.\nMr. Bonteen learned also that the gentleman now known as Mr. Joseph\nEmilius of the London Chapel had been known in his own country as\nYosef Mealyus, the name which had been borne by the very respectable\nJew who was his father. Then Mr. Bonteen had returned home, and, as\nwe all know, had become engaged in matters of deeper import than even\nthe deliverance of Lady Eustace from her thraldom.\n\nMr. Emilius made no attempt to obtain the person of his wife while\nshe was under Mr. Bonteen's custody, but he did renew his offer\nto compromise. If the estate could not afford to give him the two\nthousand a year which he had first demanded, he would take fifteen\nhundred. He explained all this personally to Mr. Bonteen, who\ncondescended to see him. He was very eager to make Mr. Bonteen\nunderstand how bad even then would be his condition. Mr. Bonteen was,\nof course, aware that he would have to pay very heavily for insuring\nhis wife's life. He was piteous, argumentative, and at first gentle;\nbut when Mr. Bonteen somewhat rashly told him that the evidence\nof a former marriage and of the present existence of the former\nwife would certainly be forthcoming, he defied Mr. Bonteen and his\nevidence,--and swore that if his claims were not satisfied, he would\nmake use of the power which the English law gave him for the recovery\nof his wife's person. And as to her property,--it was his, not hers.\nFrom this time forward if she wanted to separate herself from him she\nmust ask him for an allowance. Now, it certainly was the case that\nLady Eustace had married the man without any sufficient precaution as\nto keeping her money in her own hands, and Mr. Emilius had insisted\nthat the rents of the property which was hers for her life should\nbe paid to him, and on his receipt only. The poor tenants had been\nnoticed this way and noticed that till they had begun to doubt\nwhether their safest course would not be to keep their rents in their\nown hands. But lately the lawyers of the Eustace family,--who were\nnot, indeed, very fond of Lady Eustace personally,--came forward for\nthe sake of the property, and guaranteed the tenants against all\nproceedings until the question of the legality of the marriage should\nbe settled. So Mr. Emilius,--or the Reverend Mealyus, as everybody\nnow called him,--went to law; and Lady Eustace went to law; and the\nEustace family went to law;--but still, as yet, no evidence was\nforthcoming sufficient to enable Mr. Bonteen, as the lady's friend,\nto put the gentleman into prison.\n\nIt was said for a while that Mealyus had absconded. After his\ninterview with Mr. Bonteen he certainly did leave England and made\na journey to Prague. It was thought that he would not return, and\nthat Lady Eustace would be obliged to carry on the trial, which was\nto liberate her and her property, in his absence. She was told that\nthe very fact of his absence would go far with a jury, and she was\nglad to be freed from his presence in England. But he did return,\ndeclaring aloud that he would have his rights. His wife should be\nmade to put herself into his hands, and he would obtain possession\nof the income which was his own. People then began to doubt. It was\nknown that a very clever lawyer's clerk had been sent to Prague to\ncomplete the work there which Mr. Bonteen had commenced. But the\nclerk did not come back as soon as was expected, and news arrived\nthat he had been taken ill. There was a rumour that he had been\npoisoned at his hotel; but, as the man was not said to be dead,\npeople hardly believed the rumour. It became necessary, however, to\nsend another lawyer's clerk, and the matter was gradually progressing\nto a very interesting complication.\n\nMr. Bonteen, to tell the truth, was becoming sick of it. When\nEmilius, or Mealyus, was supposed to have absconded, Lady Eustace\nleft Mr. Bonteen's house, and located herself at one of the large\nLondon hotels; but when the man came back, bolder than ever, she\nagain betook herself to the shelter of Mr. Bonteen's roof. She\nexpressed the most lavish affection for Mrs. Bonteen, and professed\nto regard Mr. Bonteen as almost a political god, declaring her\nconviction that he, and he alone, as Prime Minister, could save the\ncountry, and became very loud in her wrath when he was robbed of his\nseat in the Cabinet. Lizzie Eustace, as her ladyship had always been\ncalled, was a clever, pretty, coaxing little woman, who knew how to\nmake the most of her advantages. She had not been very wise in her\nlife, having lost the friends who would have been truest to her, and\nconfided in persons who had greatly injured her. She was neither\ntrue of heart or tongue, nor affectionate, nor even honest. But she\nwas engaging; she could flatter; and could assume a reverential\nadmiration which was very foreign to her real character. In these\ndays she almost worshipped Mr. Bonteen, and could never be happy\nexcept in the presence of her dearest darling friend Mrs. Bonteen.\nMr. Bonteen was tired of her, and Mrs. Bonteen was becoming almost\nsick of the constant kisses with which she was greeted; but Lizzie\nEustace had got hold of them, and they could not turn her off.\n\n\"You saw The People's Banner, Mrs. Bonteen, on Monday?\" Lady\nEustace had been reading the paper in her friend's drawing-room.\n\"They seem to think that Mr. Bonteen must be Prime Minister before\nlong.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"They seem to think that Mr. Bonteen must be\nPrime Minister.\"]\n\n\n\"I don't think he expects that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why not? Everybody says The People's Banner is the cleverest paper\nwe have now. I always hated the very name of that Phineas Finn.\"\n\n\"Did you know him?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. He was gone before my time; but poor Lord Fawn used to\ntalk of him. He was one of those conceited Irish upstarts that are\nnever good for anything.\"\n\n\"Very handsome, you know,\" said Mrs. Bonteen.\n\n\"Was he? I have heard it said that a good many ladies admired him.\"\n\n\"It was quite absurd; with Lady Laura Kennedy it was worse than\nabsurd. And there was Lady Glencora, and Violet Effingham, who\nmarried Lady Laura's brother, and that Madame Goesler, whom I\nhate,--and ever so many others.\"\n\n\"And is it true that it was he who got Mr. Bonteen so shamefully\nused?\"\n\n\"It was his faction.\"\n\n\"I do so hate that kind of thing,\" said Lady Eustace, with righteous\nindignation; \"I used to hear a great deal about Government and all\nthat when the affair was on between me and poor Lord Fawn, and that\nkind of dishonesty always disgusted me. I don't know that I think so\nmuch of Mr. Gresham after all.\"\n\n\"He is a very weak man.\"\n\n\"His conduct to Mr. Bonteen has been outrageous; and if he has done\nit just because that Duchess of Omnium has told him, I really do\nthink that he is not fit to rule the nation. As for Mr. Phineas Finn,\nit is dreadful to think that a creature like that should be able to\ninterfere with such a man as Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\nThis was on Wednesday afternoon,--the day on which members of\nParliament dine out,--and at that moment Mr. Bonteen entered the\ndrawing-room, having left the House for his half-holiday at six\no'clock. Lady Eustace got up, and gave him her hand, and smiled upon\nhim as though he were indeed her god. \"You look so tired and so\nworried, Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"Worried;--I should think so.\"\n\n\"Is there anything fresh?\" asked his wife.\n\n\"That fellow Finn is spreading all manner of lies about me.\"\n\n\"What lies, Mr. Bonteen?\" asked Lady Eustace. \"Not new lies, I hope.\"\n\n\"It all comes from Carlton Terrace.\" The reader may perhaps remember\nthat the young Duchess of Omnium lived in Carlton Terrace. \"I can\ntrace it all there. I won't stand it if it goes on like this. A\nclique of stupid women to take up the cudgels for a coal-heaving\nsort of fellow like that, and sting one like a lot of hornets! Would\nyou believe it?--the Duke almost refused to speak to me just now--a\nman for whom I have been working like a slave for the last twelve\nmonths!\"\n\n\"I would not stand it,\" said Lady Eustace.\n\n\"By the bye, Lady Eustace, we have had news from Prague.\"\n\n\"What news?\" said she, clasping her hands.\n\n\"That fellow Pratt we sent out is dead.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Not a doubt but what he was poisoned; but they seem to think that\nnothing can be proved. Coulson is on his way out, and I shouldn't\nwonder if they served him the same.\"\n\n\"And it might have been you!\" said Lady Eustace, taking hold of her\nfriend's arm with almost frantic affection.\n\nYes, indeed. It might have been the lot of Mr. Bonteen to have died\nat Prague--to have been poisoned by the machinations of the former\nMrs. Mealyus, if such really had been the fortune of the unfortunate\nMr. Pratt. For he had been quite as busy at Prague as his successor\nin the work. He had found out much, though not everything. It\ncertainly had been believed that Yosef Mealyus was a married man,\nbut he had brought the woman with him to Prague, and had certainly\nnot married her in the city. She was believed to have come from\nCracow, and Mr. Bonteen's zeal on behalf of his friend had not been\nsufficient to carry him so far East. But he had learned from various\nsources that the man and woman had been supposed to be married,--that\nshe had borne the man's name, and that he had taken upon himself\nauthority as her husband. There had been written communications with\nCracow, and information was received that a man of the name of Yosef\nMealyus had been married to a Jewess in that town. But this had\nbeen twenty years ago, and Mr. Emilius professed himself to be only\nthirty-five years old, and had in his possession a document from his\nsynagogue professing to give a record of his birth, proving such to\nbe his age. It was also ascertained that Mealyus was a name common\nat Cracow, and that there were very many of the family in Galicia.\nAltogether the case was full of difficulty, but it was thought that\nMr. Bonteen's evidence would be sufficient to save the property from\nthe hands of the cormorant, at any rate till such time as better\nevidence of the first marriage could be obtained. It had been hoped\nthat when the man went away he would not return; but he had returned,\nand it was now resolved that no terms should be kept with him and no\npayment offered to him. The house at Portray was kept barred, and the\nservants were ordered not to admit him. No money was to be paid to\nhim, and he was to be left to take any proceedings at law which he\nmight please,--while his adversaries were proceeding against him with\nall the weapons at their disposal. In the meantime his chapel was of\ncourse deserted, and the unfortunate man was left penniless in the\nworld.\n\nVarious opinions prevailed as to Mr. Bonteen's conduct in the matter.\nSome people remembered that during the last autumn he and his wife\nhad stayed three months at Portray Castle, and declared that the\nfriendship between them and Lady Eustace had been very useful. Of\nthese malicious people it seemed to be, moreover, the opinion that\nthe connection might become even more useful if Mr. Emilius could be\ndischarged. It was true that Mrs. Bonteen had borrowed a little money\nfrom Lady Eustace, but of this her husband knew nothing till the Jew\nin his wrath made the thing public. After all it had only been a\npoor \u00c2\u00a325, and the money had been repaid before Mr. Bonteen took his\njourney to Prague. Mr. Bonteen was, however, unable to deny that the\ncost of that journey was defrayed by Lady Eustace, and it was thought\nmean in a man aspiring to be Chancellor of the Exchequer to have his\ntravelling expenses paid for him by a lady. Many, however, were of\nopinion that Mr. Bonteen had been almost romantic in his friendship,\nand that the bright eyes of Lady Eustace had produced upon this\ndragon of business the wonderful effect that was noticed. Be that as\nit may, now, in the terrible distress of his mind at the political\naspect of the times, he had become almost sick of Lady Eustace, and\nwould gladly have sent her away from his house had he known how to do\nso without incurring censure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nTHE QUARREL.\n\n\nOn that Wednesday evening Phineas Finn was at The Universe. He dined\nat the house of Madame Goesler, and went from thence to the club in\nbetter spirits than he had known for some weeks past. The Duke and\nDuchess had been at Madame Goesler's, and Lord and Lady Chiltern,\nwho were now up in town, with Barrington Erle, and,--as it had\nhappened,--old Mr. Maule. The dinner had been very pleasant, and two\nor three words had been spoken which had tended to raise the heart of\nour hero. In the first place Barrington Erle had expressed a regret\nthat Phineas was not at his old post at the Colonies, and the young\nDuke had re-echoed it. Phineas thought that the manner of his old\nfriend Erle was more cordial to him than it had been lately, and\neven that comforted him. Then it was a delight to him to meet the\nChilterns, who were always gracious to him. But perhaps his greatest\npleasure came from the reception which was accorded by his hostess to\nMr. Maule, which was of a nature not easy to describe. It had become\nevident to Phineas that Mr. Maule was constant in his attentions to\nMadame Goesler; and, though he had no purpose of his own in reference\nto the lady,--though he was aware that former circumstances,\ncircumstances of that previous life to which he was accustomed to\nlook back as to another existence, made it impossible that he should\nhave any such purpose,--still he viewed Mr. Maule with dislike. He\nhad once ventured to ask her whether she really liked \"that old\npadded dandy.\" She had answered that she did like the old dandy. Old\ndandies, she thought, were preferable to old men who did not care how\nthey looked;--and as for the padding, that was his affair, not hers.\nShe did not know why a man should not have a pad in his coat, as well\nas a woman one at the back of her head. But Phineas had known that\nthis was her gentle raillery, and now he was delighted to find that\nshe continued it, after a still more gentle fashion, before the man's\nface. Mr. Maule's manner was certainly peculiar. He was more than\nordinarily polite,--and was afterwards declared by the Duchess to\nhave made love like an old gander. But Madame Goesler, who knew\nexactly how to receive such attentions, turned a glance now and then\nupon Phineas Finn, which he could now read with absolute precision.\n\"You see how I can dispose of a padded old dandy directly he goes an\ninch too far.\" No words could have said that to him more plainly than\ndid these one or two glances;--and, as he had learned to dislike Mr.\nMaule, he was gratified.\n\nOf course they all talked about Lady Eustace and Mr. Emilius. \"Do\nyou remember how intensely interested the dear old Duke used to be\nwhen we none of us knew what had become of the diamonds?\" said the\nDuchess.\n\n\"And how you took her part,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"So did you,--just as much as I; and why not? She was a most\ninteresting young woman, and I sincerely hope we have not got to the\nend of her yet. The worst of it is that she has got into such--very\nbad hands. The Bonteens have taken her up altogether. Do you know\nher, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"No, Duchess;--and am hardly likely to make her acquaintance while\nshe remains where she is now.\" The Duchess laughed and nodded her\nhead. All the world knew by this time that she had declared herself\nto be the sworn enemy of the Bonteens.\n\nAnd there had been some conversation on that terribly difficult\nquestion respecting the foxes in Trumpeton Wood. \"The fact is, Lord\nChiltern,\" said the Duke, \"I'm as ignorant as a child. I would do\nright if I knew how. What ought I to do? Shall I import some foxes?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose, Duke, that in all England there is a spot in which\nfoxes are more prone to breed.\"\n\n\"Indeed. I'm very glad of that. But something goes wrong afterwards,\nI fear.\"\n\n\"The nurseries are not well managed, perhaps,\" said the Duchess.\n\n\"Gipsy kidnappers are allowed about the place,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"Gipsies!\" exclaimed the Duke.\n\n\"Poachers!\" said Lord Chiltern. \"But it isn't that we mind. We could\ndeal with that ourselves if the woods were properly managed. A head\nof game and foxes can be reared together very well, if--\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw for a head of game, Lord Chiltern. As far as\nmy own tastes go, I would wish that there was neither a pheasant\nnor a partridge nor a hare on any property that I own. I think that\nsheep and barn-door fowls do better for everybody in the long run,\nand that men who cannot live without shooting should go beyond\nthickly-populated regions to find it. And, indeed, for myself, I must\nsay the same about foxes. They do not interest me, and I fancy that\nthey will gradually be exterminated.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" exclaimed Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"But I do not find myself called upon to exterminate them myself,\"\ncontinued the Duke. \"The number of men who amuse themselves by riding\nafter one fox is too great for me to wish to interfere with them. And\nI know that my neighbours in the country conceive it to be my duty to\nhave foxes for them. I will oblige them, Lord Chiltern, as far as I\ncan without detriment to other duties.\"\n\n\"You leave it to me,\" said the Duchess to her neighbour, Lord\nChiltern. \"I'll speak to Mr. Fothergill myself, and have it put\nright.\" It unfortunately happened, however, that Lord Chiltern got\na letter the very next morning from old Doggett telling him that a\nlitter of young cubs had been destroyed that week in Trumpeton Wood.\n\nBarrington Erle and Phineas went off to The Universe together, and\nas they went the old terms of intimacy seemed to be re-established\nbetween them. \"Nobody can be so sorry as I am,\" said Barrington, \"at\nthe manner in which things have gone. When I wrote to you, of course,\nI thought it certain that, if we came in, you would come with us.\"\n\n\"Do not let that fret you.\"\n\n\"But it does fret me,--very much. There are so many slips that of\ncourse no one can answer for anything.\"\n\n\"Of course not. I know who has been my friend.\"\n\n\"The joke of it is, that he himself is at present so utterly\nfriendless. The Duke will hardly speak to him. I know that as a fact.\nAnd Gresham has begun to find something is wrong. We all hoped that\nhe would refuse to come in without a seat in the Cabinet;--but that\nwas too good to be true. They say he talks of resigning. I shall\nbelieve it when I see it. He'd better not play any tricks, for if he\ndid resign, it would be accepted at once.\" Phineas, when he heard\nthis, could not help thinking how glorious it would be if Mr. Bonteen\nwere to resign, and if the place so vacated, or some vacancy so\noccasioned, were to be filled by him!\n\nThey reached the club together, and as they went up the stairs, they\nheard the hum of many voices in the room. \"All the world and his wife\nare here to-night,\" said Phineas. They overtook a couple of men at\nthe door, so that there was something of the bustle of a crowd as\nthey entered. There was a difficulty in finding places in which to\nput their coats and hats,--for the accommodation of The Universe is\nnot great. There was a knot of men talking not far from them, and\namong the voices Phineas could clearly hear that of Mr. Bonteen.\nRatler's he had heard before, and also Fitzgibbon's, though he\nhad not distinguished any words from them. But those spoken by Mr.\nBonteen he did distinguish very plainly. \"Mr. Phineas Finn, or some\nsuch fellow as that, would be after her at once,\" said Mr. Bonteen.\nThen Phineas walked immediately among the knot of men and showed\nhimself. As soon as he heard his name mentioned, he doubted for a\nmoment what he would do. Mr. Bonteen when speaking had not known of\nhis presence, and it might be his duty not to seem to have listened.\nBut the speech had been made aloud, in the open room,--so that those\nwho chose might listen;--and Phineas could not but have heard it. In\nthat moment he resolved that he was bound to take notice of what he\nhad heard. \"What is it, Mr. Bonteen, that Phineas Finn will do?\" he\nasked.\n\nMr. Bonteen had been--dining. He was not a man by any means\nhabitually intemperate, and now any one saying that he was tipsy\nwould have maligned him. But he was flushed with much wine, and\nhe was a man whose arrogance in that condition was apt to become\nextreme. _\"In vino veritas!\"_ The sober devil can hide his cloven\nhoof; but when the devil drinks he loses his cunning and grows\nhonest. Mr. Bonteen looked Phineas full in the face a second or two\nbefore he answered, and then said,--quite aloud--\"You have crept upon\nus unawares, sir.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, sir?\" said Phineas. \"I have come in as any\nother man comes.\"\n\n\"Listeners at any rate never hear any good of themselves.\"\n\nThen there were present among those assembled clear indications of\ndisapproval of Bonteen's conduct. In these days,--when no palpable\nand immediate punishment is at hand for personal insolence from man\nto man,--personal insolence to one man in a company seems almost\nto constitute an insult to every one present. When men could fight\nreadily, an arrogant word or two between two known to be hostile to\neach other was only an invitation to a duel, and the angry man was\ndoing that for which it was known that he could be made to pay. There\nwas, or it was often thought that there was, a real spirit in the\nangry man's conduct, and they who were his friends before became\nperhaps more his friends when he had thus shown that he had an enemy.\nBut a different feeling prevails at present;--a feeling so different,\nthat we may almost say that a man in general society cannot speak\neven roughly to any but his intimate comrades without giving offence\nto all around him. Men have learned to hate the nuisance of a row,\nand to feel that their comfort is endangered if a man prone to rows\ngets among them. Of all candidates at a club a known quarreller is\nmore sure of blackballs now than even in the times when such a one\nprovoked duels. Of all bores he is the worst; and there is always\nan unexpressed feeling that such a one exacts more from his company\nthan his share of attention. This is so strong, that too often the\nman quarrelled with, though he be as innocent as was Phineas on the\npresent occasion, is made subject to the general aversion which is\nfelt for men who misbehave themselves.\n\n\"I wish to hear no good of myself from you,\" said Phineas, following\nhim to his seat. \"Who is it that you said,--I should be after?\" The\nroom was full, and every one there, even they who had come in with\nPhineas, knew that Lady Eustace was the woman. Everybody at present\nwas talking about Lady Eustace.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Barrington Erle, taking him by the arm. \"What's\nthe use of a row?\"\n\n\"No use at all;--but if you heard your name mentioned in such a\nmanner you would find it impossible to pass it over. There is Mr.\nMonk;--ask him.\"\n\nMr. Monk was sitting very quietly in a corner of the room with\nanother gentleman of his own age by him,--one devoted to literary\npursuits and a constant attendant at The Universe. As he said\nafterwards, he had never known any unpleasantness of that sort in\nthe club before. There were many men of note in the room. There was\na foreign minister, a member of the Cabinet, two ex-members of the\nCabinet, a great poet, an exceedingly able editor, two earls, two\nmembers of the Royal Academy, the president of a learned society, a\ncelebrated professor,--and it was expected that Royalty might come\nin at any minute, speak a few benign words, and blow a few clouds of\nsmoke. It was abominable that the harmony of such a meeting should be\ninterrupted by the vinous insolence of Mr. Bonteen, and the useless\nwrath of Phineas Finn. \"Really, Mr. Finn, if I were you I would let\nit drop,\" said the gentleman devoted to literary pursuits.\n\nPhineas did not much affect the literary gentleman, but in such a\nmatter would prefer the advice of Mr. Monk to that of any man living.\nHe again appealed to his friend. \"You heard what was said?\"\n\n\"I heard Mr. Bonteen remark that you or somebody like you would in\ncertain circumstances be after a certain lady. I thought it to be\nan ill-judged speech, and as your particular friend I heard it with\ngreat regret.\"\n\n\"What a row about nothing!\" said Mr. Bonteen, rising from his seat.\n\"We were speaking of a very pretty woman, and I was saying that some\nyoung fellow generally supposed to be fond of pretty women would soon\nbe after her. If that offends your morals you must have become very\nstrict of late.\"\n\nThere was something in the explanation which, though very bad and\nvulgar, it was almost impossible not to accept. Such at least was the\nfeeling of those who stood around Phineas Finn. He himself knew that\nMr. Bonteen had intended to assert that he would be after the woman's\nmoney and not her beauty; but he had taste enough to perceive that he\ncould not descend to any such detail as that. \"There are reasons, Mr.\nBonteen,\" he said, \"why I think you should abstain from mentioning\nmy name in public. Your playful references should be made to your\nfriends, and not to those who, to say the least of it, are not your\nfriends.\"\n\nWhen the matter was discussed afterwards it was thought that Phineas\nFinn should have abstained from making the last speech. It was\ncertainly evidence of great anger on his part. And he was very angry.\nHe knew that he had been insulted,--and insulted by the man whom of\nall men he would feel most disposed to punish for any offence. He\ncould not allow Mr. Bonteen to have the last word, especially as a\ncertain amount of success had seemed to attend them. Fate at the\nmoment was so far propitious to Phineas that outward circumstances\nsaved him from any immediate reply, and thus left him in some degree\ntriumphant. Expected Royalty arrived, and cast its salutary oil\nupon the troubled waters. The Prince, with some well-known popular\nattendant, entered the room, and for a moment every gentleman rose\nfrom his chair. It was but for a moment, and then the Prince became\nas any other gentleman, talking to his friends. One or two there\npresent, who had perhaps peculiarly royal instincts, had crept up\ntowards him so as to make him the centre of a little knot, but,\notherwise, conversation went on much as it had done before the\nunfortunate arrival of Phineas. That quarrel, however, had been very\ndistinctly trodden under foot by the Prince, for Mr. Bonteen had\nfound himself quite incapacitated from throwing back any missile in\nreply to the last that had been hurled at him.\n\nPhineas took a vacant seat next to Mr. Monk,--who was deficient\nperhaps in royal instincts,--and asked him in a whisper his opinion\nof what had taken place. \"Do not think any more of it,\" said Mr.\nMonk.\n\n\"That is so much more easily said than done. How am I not to think of\nit?\"\n\n\"Of course I mean that you are to act as though you had forgotten\nit.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know a more gratuitous insult? Of course he was talking\nof that Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"I had not been listening to him before, but no doubt he was. I\nneed not tell you now what I think of Mr. Bonteen. He is not more\ngracious in my eyes than he is in yours. To-night I fancy he has\nbeen drinking, which has not improved him. You may be sure of this,\nPhineas,--that the less of resentful anger you show in such a\nwretched affair as took place just now, the more will be the blame\nattached to him and the less to you.\"\n\n\"Why should any blame be attached to me?\"\n\n\"I don't say that any will unless you allow yourself to become loud\nand resentful. The thing is not worth your anger.\"\n\n\"I am angry.\"\n\n\"Then go to bed at once, and sleep it off. Come with me, and we'll\nwalk home together.\"\n\n\"It isn't the proper thing, I fancy, to leave the room while the\nPrince is here.\"\n\n\"Then I must do the improper thing,\" said Mr. Monk. \"I haven't a key,\nand I musn't keep my servant up any longer. A quiet man like me can\ncreep out without notice. Good night, Phineas, and take my advice\nabout this. If you can't forget it, act and speak and look as though\nyou had forgotten it.\" Then Mr. Monk, without much creeping, left the\nroom.\n\nThe club was very full, and there was a clatter of voices, and the\nclatter round the Prince was the noisiest and merriest. Mr. Bonteen\nwas there, of course, and Phineas as he sat alone could hear him as\nhe edged his words in upon the royal ears. Every now and again there\nwas a royal joke, and then Mr. Bonteen's laughter was conspicuous. As\nfar as Phineas could distinguish the sounds no special amount of the\nroyal attention was devoted to Mr. Bonteen. That very able editor,\nand one of the Academicians, and the poet, seemed to be the most\nhonoured, and when the Prince went,--which he did when his cigar was\nfinished,--Phineas observed with inward satisfaction that the royal\nhand, which was given to the poet, to the editor, and to the painter,\nwas not extended to the President of the Board of Trade. And then,\nhaving taken delight in this, he accused himself of meanness in\nhaving even observed a matter so trivial. Soon after this a ruck of\nmen left the club, and then Phineas rose to go. As he went down the\nstairs Barrington Erle followed him with Laurence Fitzgibbon, and the\nthree stood for a moment at the door in the street talking to each\nother. Finn's way lay eastward from the club, whereas both Erle and\nFitzgibbon would go westwards towards their homes. \"How well the\nPrince behaves at these sort of places!\" said Erle.\n\n\"Princes ought to behave well,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Somebody else didn't behave very well,--eh, Finn, my boy?\" said\nLaurence.\n\n\"Somebody else, as you call him,\" replied Phineas, \"is very unlike a\nPrince, and never does behave well. To-night, however, he surpassed\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Don't bother your mind about it, old fellow,\" said Barrington.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Erle,\" said Phineas. \"I don't think that I'm\na vindictive man by nature, but with that man I mean to make it even\nsome of these days. You know as well as I do what it is he has done\nto me, and you know also whether I have deserved it. Wretched reptile\nthat he is! He has pretty nearly been able to ruin me,--and all from\nsome petty feeling of jealousy.\"\n\n\"Finn, me boy, don't talk like that,\" said Laurence.\n\n\"You shouldn't show your hand,\" said Barrington.\n\n\"I know what you mean, and it's all very well. After your different\nfashions you two have been true to me, and I don't care how much you\nsee of my hand. That man's insolence angers me to such an extent that\nI cannot refrain from speaking out. He hasn't spirit enough to go out\nwith me, or I would shoot him.\"\n\n\"Blankenberg, eh!\" said Laurence, alluding to the now notorious duel\nwhich had once been fought in that place between Phineas and Lord\nChiltern.\n\n\"I would,\" continued the angry man. \"There are times in which one is\ndriven to regret that there has come an end to duelling, and there is\nleft to one no immediate means of resenting an injury.\"\n\nAs they were speaking Mr. Bonteen came out from the front door\nalone, and seeing the three men standing, passed on towards the left,\neastwards. \"Good night, Erle,\" he said. \"Good night, Fitzgibbon.\"\nThe two men answered him, and Phineas stood back in the gloom. It\nwas about one o'clock and the night was very dark. \"By George, I\ndo dislike that man,\" said Phineas. Then, with a laugh, he took a\nlife-preserver out of his pocket, and made an action with it as\nthough he were striking some enemy over the head. In those days there\nhad been much garotting in the streets, and writers in the Press had\nadvised those who walked about at night to go armed with sticks.\nPhineas Finn had himself been once engaged with garotters,--as has\nbeen told in a former chronicle,--and had since armed himself,\nthinking more probably of the thing which he had happened to see\nthan men do who had only heard of it. As soon as he had spoken, he\nfollowed Mr. Bonteen down the street, at the distance of perhaps a\ncouple of hundred yards.\n\n\"They won't have a row,--will they?\" said Erle.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no; Finn won't think of speaking to him; and you may be\nsure that Bonteen won't say a word to Finn. Between you and me,\nBarrington, I wish Master Phineas would give him a thorough good\nhiding.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nWHAT CAME OF THE QUARREL.\n\n\nOn the next morning at seven o'clock a superintendent of police\ncalled at the house of Mr. Gresham and informed the Prime Minister\nthat Mr. Bonteen, the President of the Board of Trade, had been\nmurdered during the night. There was no doubt of the fact. The\nbody had been recognised, and information had been taken to the\nunfortunate widow at the house Mr. Bonteen had occupied in St.\nJames's Place. The superintendent had already found out that Mr.\nBonteen had been attacked as he was returning from his club late at\nnight,--or rather, early in the morning, and expressed no doubt that\nhe had been murdered close to the spot on which his body was found.\nThere is a dark, uncanny-looking passage running from the end of\nBolton Row, in May Fair, between the gardens of two great noblemen,\ncoming out among the mews in Berkeley Street, at the corner of\nBerkeley Square, just opposite to the bottom of Hay Hill. It was on\nthe steps leading up from the passage to the level of the ground\nabove that the body was found. The passage was almost as near a way\nas any from the club to Mr. Bonteen's house in St. James's Place;\nbut the superintendent declared that gentlemen but seldom used the\npassage after dark, and he was disposed to think that the unfortunate\nman must have been forced down the steps by the ruffian who had\nattacked him from the level above. The murderer, so thought the\nsuperintendent, must have been cognizant of the way usually taken\nby Mr. Bonteen, and must have lain in wait for him in the darkness\nof the mouth of the passage. The superintendent had been at work on\nhis inquiries since four in the morning, and had heard from Lady\nEustace,--and from Mrs. Bonteen, as far as that poor distracted\nwoman had been able to tell her story,--some account of the cause\nof quarrel between the respective husbands of those two ladies. The\nofficer, who had not as yet heard a word of the late disturbance\nbetween Mr. Bonteen and Phineas Finn, was strongly of opinion that\nthe Reverend Mr. Emilius had been the murderer. Mr. Gresham, of\ncourse, coincided in that opinion. What steps had been taken as to\nthe arrest of Mr. Emilius? The superintendent was of opinion that Mr.\nEmilius was already in custody. He was known to be lodging close to\nthe Marylebone Workhouse, in Northumberland Street, having removed to\nthat somewhat obscure neighbourhood as soon as his house in Lowndes\nSquare had been broken up by the running away of his wife and his\nconsequent want of means. Such was the story as told to the Prime\nMinister at seven o'clock in the morning.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, at his private room at the Treasury Chambers, Mr.\nGresham heard much more. At that time there were present with him two\nofficers of the police force, his colleagues in the Cabinet, Lord\nCantrip and the Duke of Omnium, three of his junior colleagues in the\nGovernment, Lord Fawn, Barrington Erle, and Laurence Fitzgibbon,--and\nMajor Mackintosh, the chief of the London police. It was not exactly\npart of the duty of Mr. Gresham to investigate the circumstances of\nthis murder; but there was so much in it that brought it closely home\nto him and his Government, that it became impossible for him not to\nconcern himself in the business. There had been so much talk about\nMr. Bonteen lately, his name had been so common in the newspapers,\nthe ill-usage which he had been supposed by some to have suffered\nhad been so freely discussed, and his quarrel, not only with Phineas\nFinn, but subsequently with the Duke of Omnium, had been so widely\nknown,--that his sudden death created more momentary excitement than\nmight probably have followed that of a greater man. And now, too, the\nfacts of the past night, as they became known, seemed to make the\ncrime more wonderful, more exciting, more momentous than it would\nhave been had it been brought clearly home to such a wretch as the\nBohemian Jew, Yosef Mealyus, who had contrived to cheat that wretched\nLizzie Eustace into marrying him.\n\nAs regarded Yosef Mealyus the story now told respecting him was this.\nHe was already in custody. He had been found in bed at his lodgings\nbetween seven and eight, and had, of course, given himself up without\ndifficulty. He had seemed to be horror-struck when he heard of the\nman's death,--but had openly expressed his joy. \"He has endeavoured\nto ruin me, and has done me a world of harm. Why should I sorrow for\nhim?\"--he said to the policeman when rebuked for his inhumanity. But\nnothing had been found tending to implicate him in the crime. The\nservant declared that he had gone to bed before eleven o'clock, to\nher knowledge,--for she had seen him there,--and that he had not\nleft the house afterwards. Was he in possession of a latch-key? It\nappeared that he did usually carry a latch-key, but that it was often\nborrowed from him by members of the family when it was known that\nhe would not want it himself,--and that it had been so lent on this\nnight. It was considered certain by those in the house that he had\nnot gone out after he went to bed. Nobody in fact had left the house\nafter ten; but in accordance with his usual custom Mr. Emilius had\nsent down the key as soon as he had found that he would not want\nit, and it had been all night in the custody of the mistress of the\nestablishment. Nevertheless his clothes were examined minutely, but\nwithout affording any evidence against him. That Mr. Bonteen had been\nkilled with some blunt weapon, such as a life-preserver, was assumed\nby the police, but no such weapon was in the possession of Mr.\nEmilius, nor had any such weapon yet been found. He was, however, in\ncustody, with no evidence against him except that which was afforded\nby his known and acknowledged enmity to Mr. Bonteen.\n\nSo far, Major Mackintosh and the two officers had told their story.\nThen came the united story of the other gentlemen assembled,--from\nhearing which, however, the two police officers were debarred. The\nDuke and Barrington Erle had both dined in company with Phineas\nFinn at Madame Goesler's, and the Duke was undoubtedly aware that\nill blood had existed between Finn and Mr. Bonteen. Both Erle and\nFitzgibbon described the quarrel at the club, and described also the\nanger which Finn had expressed against the wretched man as he stood\ntalking at the club door. His gesture of vengeance was remembered and\nrepeated, though both the men who heard it expressed their strongest\nconviction that the murder had not been committed by him. As Erle\nremarked, the very expression of such a threat was almost proof that\nhe had not at that moment any intention on his mind of doing such a\ndeed as had been done. But they told also of the life-preserver which\nFinn had shown them, as he took it from the pocket of his outside\ncoat, and they marvelled at the coincidences of the night. Then Lord\nFawn gave further evidence, which seemed to tell very hardly upon\nPhineas Finn. He also had been at the club, and had left it just\nbefore Finn and the two other men had clustered at the door. He had\nwalked very slowly, having turned down to Curzon Street and Bolton\nRow, from whence he made his way into Piccadilly by Clarges Street.\nHe had seen nothing of Mr. Bonteen; but as he crossed over to Clarges\nStreet he was passed at a very rapid pace by a man muffled in a top\ncoat, who made his way straight along Bolton Row towards the passage\nwhich has been described. At the moment he had not connected the\nperson of the man who passed him with any acquaintance of his own;\nbut he now felt sure,--after what he had heard,--that the man was Mr.\nFinn. As he passed out of the club Finn was putting on his overcoat,\nand Lord Fawn had observed the peculiarity of the grey colour. It was\nexactly a similar coat, only with its collar raised, that had passed\nhim in the street. The man, too, was of Mr. Finn's height and build.\nHe had known Mr. Finn well, and the man stepped with Mr. Finn's\nstep. Major Mackintosh thought that Lord Fawn's evidence was--\"very\nunfortunate as regarded Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I'm d---- if that idiot won't hang poor Phinny,\" said Fitzgibbon\nafterwards to Erle. \"And yet I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"Fawn wouldn't lie for the sake of hanging Phineas Finn,\" said Erle.\n\n\"No;--I don't suppose he's given to lying at all. He believes it\nall. But he's such a muddle-headed fellow that he can get himself\nto believe anything. He's one of those men who always unconsciously\nexaggerate what they have to say for the sake of the importance it\ngives them.\" It might be possible that a jury would look at Lord\nFawn's evidence in this light; otherwise it would bear very heavily,\nindeed, against Phineas Finn.\n\nThen a question arose as to the road which Mr. Bonteen usually took\nfrom the club. All the members who were there present had walked\nhome with him at various times,--and by various routes, but never by\nthe way through the passage. It was supposed that on this occasion\nhe must have gone by Berkeley Square, because he had certainly not\nturned down by the first street to the right, which he would have\ntaken had he intended to avoid the square. He had been seen by\nBarrington Erle and Fitzgibbon to pass that turning. Otherwise they\nwould have made no remark as to the possibility of a renewed quarrel\nbetween him and Phineas, should Phineas chance to overtake him;--for\nPhineas would certainly go by the square unless taken out of his way\nby some special purpose. The most direct way of all for Mr. Bonteen\nwould have been that followed by Lord Fawn; but as he had not turned\ndown this street, and had not been seen by Lord Fawn, who was known\nto walk very slowly, and had often been seen to go by Berkeley\nSquare,--it was presumed that he had now taken that road. In this\ncase he would certainly pass the end of the passage towards which\nLord Fawn declared that he had seen the man hurrying whom he now\nsupposed to have been Phineas Finn. Finn's direct road home would,\nas has been already said, have been through the square, cutting\noff the corner of the square, towards Bruton Street, and thence\nacross Bond Street by Conduit Street to Regent Street, and so to\nGreat Marlborough Street, where he lived. But it had been, no doubt,\npossible for him to have been on the spot on which Lord Fawn had seen\nthe man; for, although in his natural course thither from the club he\nwould have at once gone down the street to the right,--a course which\nboth Erle and Fitzgibbon were able to say that he did not take, as\nthey had seen him go beyond the turning,--nevertheless there had been\nample time for him to have retraced his steps to it in time to have\ncaught Lord Fawn, and thus to have deceived Fitzgibbon and Erle as to\nthe route he had taken.\n\nWhen they had got thus far Lord Cantrip was standing close to the\nwindow of the room at Mr. Gresham's elbow. \"Don't allow yourself to\nbe hurried into believing it,\" said Lord Cantrip.\n\n\"I do not know that we need believe it, or the reverse. It is a case\nfor the police.\"\n\n\"Of course it is;--but your belief and mine will have a weight.\nNothing that I have heard makes me for a moment think it possible.\nI know the man.\"\n\n\"He was very angry.\"\n\n\"Had he struck him in the club I should not have been much surprised;\nbut he never attacked his enemy with a bludgeon in a dark alley. I\nknow him well.\"\n\n\"What do you think of Fawn's story?\"\n\n\"He was mistaken in his man. Remember;--it was a dark night.\"\n\n\"I do not see that you and I can do anything,\" said Mr. Gresham. \"I\nshall have to say something in the House as to the poor fellow's\ndeath, but I certainly shall not express a suspicion. Why should I?\"\n\nUp to this moment nothing had been done as to Phineas Finn. It was\nknown that he would in his natural course of business be in his place\nin Parliament at four, and Major Mackintosh was of opinion that he\ncertainly should be taken before a magistrate in time to prevent the\nnecessity of arresting him in the House. It was decided that Lord\nFawn, with Fitzgibbon and Erle, should accompany the police officer\nto Bow Street, and that a magistrate should be applied to for a\nwarrant if he thought the evidence was sufficient. Major Mackintosh\nwas of opinion that, although by no possibility could the two\nmen suspected have been jointly guilty of the murder, still the\ncircumstances were such as to justify the immediate arrest of both.\nWere Yosef Mealyus really guilty and to be allowed to slip from\ntheir hands, no doubt it might be very difficult to catch him. Facts\ndid not at present seem to prevail against him; but, as the Major\nobserved, facts are apt to alter considerably when they are minutely\nsifted. His character was half sufficient to condemn him;--and then\nwith him there was an adequate motive, and what Lord Cantrip regarded\nas \"a possibility.\" It was not to be conceived that from mere rage\nPhineas Finn would lay a plot for murdering a man in the street. \"It\nis on the cards, my lord,\" said the Major, \"that he may have chosen\nto attack Mr. Bonteen without intending to murder him. The murder may\nafterwards have been an accident.\"\n\nIt was impossible after this for even a Prime Minister and two\nCabinet Ministers to go about their work calmly. The men concerned\nhad been too well known to them to allow their minds to become clear\nof the subject. When Major Mackintosh went off to Bow Street with\nErle and Laurence, it was certainly the opinion of the majority of\nthose who had been present that the blow had been struck by the hand\nof Phineas Finn. And perhaps the worst aspect of it all was that\nthere had been not simply a blow,--but blows. The constables had\ndeclared that the murdered man had been struck thrice about the head,\nand that the fatal stroke had been given on the side of his head\nafter the man's hat had been knocked off. That Finn should have\nfollowed his enemy through the street, after such words as he had\nspoken, with the view of having the quarrel out in some shape,\ndid not seem to be very improbable to any of them except Lord\nCantrip;--and then had there been a scuffle, out in the open path, at\nthe spot at which the angry man might have overtaken his adversary,\nit was not incredible to them that he should have drawn even such a\nweapon as a life-preserver from his pocket. But, in the case as it\nhad occurred, a spot peculiarly traitorous had been selected, and the\nattack had too probably been made from behind. As yet there was no\nevidence that the murderer had himself encountered any ill-usage. And\nFinn, if he was the murderer, must, from the time he was standing\nat the club door, have contemplated a traitorous, dastardly attack.\nHe must have counted his moments;--have returned slyly in the dark\nto the corner of the street which he had once passed;--have muffled\nhis face in his coat;--and have then laid wait in a spot to which an\nhonest man at night would hardly trust himself with honest purposes.\n\"I look upon it as quite out of the question,\" said Lord Cantrip,\nwhen the three Ministers were left alone. Now Lord Cantrip had served\nfor many months in the same office as Phineas Finn.\n\n\"You are simply putting your own opinion of the man against the\nfacts,\" said Mr. Gresham. \"But facts always convince, and another\nman's opinion rarely convinces.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that we know the facts yet,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"Of course we are speaking of them as far as they have been told to\nus. As far as they go,--unless they can be upset and shown not to be\nfacts,--I fear they would be conclusive to me on a jury.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you have heard enough to condemn him?\" asked Lord\nCantrip.\n\n\"Remember what we have heard. The murdered man had two enemies.\"\n\n\"He may have had a third.\"\n\n\"Or ten; but we have heard of but two.\"\n\n\"He may have been attacked for his money,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"But neither his money nor his watch were touched,\" continued Mr.\nGresham. \"Anger, or the desire of putting the man out of the way, has\ncaused the murder. Of the two enemies one,--according to the facts as\nwe now have them,--could not have been there. Nor is it probable that\nhe could have known that his enemy would be on that spot. The other\nnot only could have been there, but was certainly near the place\nat the moment,--so near that did he not do the deed himself, it\nis almost wonderful that it should not have been interrupted in\nits doing by his nearness. He certainly knew that the victim would\nbe there. He was burning with anger against him at the moment. He\nhad just threatened him. He had with him such an instrument as was\nafterwards used. A man believed to be him is seen hurrying to the\nspot by a witness whose credibility is beyond doubt. These are the\nfacts such as we have them at present. Unless they can be upset, I\nfear they would convince a jury,--as they have already convinced\nthose officers of the police.\"\n\n\"Officers of the police always believe men to be guilty,\" said Lord\nCantrip.\n\n\"They don't believe the Jew clergyman to be guilty,\" said Mr.\nGresham.\n\n\"I fear that there will be enough to send Mr. Finn to a trial,\" said\nthe Duke.\n\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" said Mr. Gresham.\n\n\"And yet I feel as convinced of his innocence as I do of my own,\"\nsaid Lord Cantrip.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nMR. MAULE'S ATTEMPT.\n\n\nAbout three o'clock in the day the first tidings of what had taken\nplace reached Madame Goesler in the following perturbed note from her\nfriend the Duchess:--\"Have you heard what took place last night? Good\nGod! Mr. Bonteen was murdered as he came home from his club, and they\nsay that it was done by Phineas Finn. Plantagenet has just come in\nfrom Downing Street, where everybody is talking about it. I can't get\nfrom him what he believes. One never can get anything from him. But\nI never will believe it;--nor will you, I'm sure. I vote we stick to\nhim to the last. He is to be put in prison and tried. I can hardly\nbelieve that Mr. Bonteen has been murdered, though I don't know why\nhe shouldn't as well as anybody else. Plantagenet talks about the\ngreat loss; I know which would be the greatest loss, and so do you.\nI'm going out now to try and find out something. Barrington Erle was\nthere, and if I can find him he will tell me. I shall be home by\nhalf-past five. Do come, there's a dear woman; there is no one else\nI can talk to about it. If I'm not back, go in all the same, and tell\nthem to bring you tea.\n\n\"Only think of Lady Laura,--with one mad and the other in Newgate!\nG. P.\"\n\nThis letter gave Madame Goesler such a blow that for a few minutes\nit altogether knocked her down. After reading it once she hardly\nknew what it contained beyond a statement that Phineas Finn was in\nNewgate. She sat for a while with it in her hands, almost swooning;\nand then with an effort she recovered herself, and read the letter\nagain. Mr. Bonteen murdered, and Phineas Finn,--who had dined with\nher only yesterday evening, with whom she had been talking of all the\nsins of the murdered man, who was her special friend, of whom she\nthought more than of any other human being, of whom she could not\nbring herself to cease to think,--accused of the murder! Believe\nit! The Duchess had declared with that sort of enthusiasm which was\ncommon to her, that she never would believe it. No, indeed! What\njudge of character would any one be who could believe that Phineas\nFinn could be guilty of a midnight murder? \"I vote we stick to him.\"\n\"Stick to him!\" Madame Goesler said, repeating the words to herself.\n\"What is the use of sticking to a man who does not want you?\" How\ncan a woman cling to a man who, having said that he did not want her,\nyet comes again within her influence, but does not unsay what he had\nsaid before? Nevertheless, if it should be that the man was in real\ndistress,--in absolutely dire sorrow,--she would cling to him with a\nconstancy which, as she thought, her friend the Duchess would hardly\nunderstand. Though they should hang him, she would bathe his body\nwith her tears, and live as a woman should live who had loved a\nmurderer to the last.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"What is the use of sticking to a man who\ndoes not want you?\"]\n\n\nBut she swore to herself that she would not believe it. Nay, she did\nnot believe it. Believe it, indeed! It was simply impossible. That he\nmight have killed the wretch in some struggle brought on by the man's\nown fault was possible. Had the man attacked Phineas Finn it was only\ntoo probable that there might have been such result. But murder,\nsecret midnight murder, could not have been committed by the man\nshe had chosen as her friend. And yet, through it all, there was a\nresolve that even though he should have committed murder she would\nbe true to him. If it should come to the very worst, then would she\ndeclare the intensity of the affection with which she regarded the\nmurderer. As to Mr. Bonteen, what the Duchess said was true enough;\nwhy should not he be killed as well as another? In her present frame\nof mind she felt very little pity for Mr. Bonteen. After a fashion a\nverdict of \"served him right\" crossed her mind, as it had doubtless\ncrossed that of the Duchess when she was writing her letter. The man\nhad made himself so obnoxious that it was well that he should be out\nof the way. But not on that account would she believe that Phineas\nFinn had murdered him.\n\nCould it be true that the man after all was dead? Marvellous reports,\nand reports marvellously false, do spread themselves about the world\nevery day. But this report had come from the Duke, and he was not\na man given to absurd rumours. He had heard the story in Downing\nStreet, and if so it must be true. Of course she would go down to the\nDuchess at the hour fixed. It was now a little after three, and she\nordered the carriage to be ready for her at a quarter past five. Then\nshe told the servant, at first to admit no one who might call, and\nthen to come up and let her know, if any one should come, without\nsending the visitor away. It might be that some one would come to her\nexpressly from Phineas, or at least with tidings about this affair.\n\nThen she read the letter again, and those few last words in it stuck\nto her thoughts like a burr. \"Think of Lady Laura, with one mad and\nthe other in Newgate.\" Was this man,--the only man whom she had ever\nloved,--more to Lady Laura Kennedy than to her; or rather, was Lady\nLaura more to him than was she herself? If so, why should she fret\nherself for his sake? She was ready enough to own that she could\nsacrifice everything for him, even though he should be standing as a\nmurderer in the dock, if such sacrifice would be valued by him. He\nhad himself told her that his feelings towards Lady Laura were simply\nthose of an affectionate friend; but how could she believe that\nstatement when all the world were saying the reverse? Lady Laura was\na married woman,--a woman whose husband was still living,--and of\ncourse he was bound to make such an assertion when he and she were\nnamed together. And then it was certain,--Madame Goesler believed it\nto be certain,--that there had been a time in which Phineas had asked\nfor the love of Lady Laura Standish. But he had never asked for her\nlove. It had been tendered to him, and he had rejected it! And now\nthe Duchess,--who, with all her inaccuracies, had that sharpness of\nvision which enables some men and women to see into facts,--spoke as\nthough Lady Laura were to be pitied more than all others, because of\nthe evil that had befallen Phineas Finn! Had not Lady Laura chosen\nher own husband; and was not the man, let him be ever so mad, still\nher husband? Madame Goesler was sore of heart, as well as broken down\nwith sorrow, till at last, hiding her face on the pillow of the sofa,\nstill holding the Duchess's letter in her hand, she burst into a fit\nof hysteric sobs.\n\nFew of those who knew Madame Max Goesler well, as she lived in town\nand in country, would have believed that such could have been the\neffect upon her of the news which she had heard. Credit was given to\nher everywhere for good nature, discretion, affability, and a certain\ngrace of demeanour which always made her charming. She was known to\nbe generous, wise, and of high spirit. Something of her conduct to\nthe old Duke had crept into general notice, and had been told, here\nand there, to her honour. She had conquered the good opinion of many,\nand was a popular woman. But there was not one among her friends\nwho supposed her capable of becoming a victim to a strong passion,\nor would have suspected her of reckless weeping for any sorrow.\nThe Duchess, who thought that she knew Madame Goesler well, would\nnot have believed it to be true, even if she had seen it. \"You like\npeople, but I don't think you ever love any one,\" the Duchess had\nonce said to her. Madame Goesler had smiled, and had seemed to\nassent. To enjoy the world,--and to know that the best enjoyment must\ncome from witnessing the satisfaction of others, had apparently been\nher philosophy. But now she was prostrate because this man was in\ntrouble, and because she had been told that his trouble was more than\nanother woman could bear!\n\nShe was still sobbing and crushing the letter in her hand when the\nservant came up to tell her that Mr. Maule had called. He was below,\nwaiting to know whether she would see him. She remembered at once\nthat Mr. Maule had met Phineas at her table on the previous evening,\nand, thinking that he must have come with tidings respecting this\ngreat event, desired that he might be shown up to her. But, as it\nhappened, Mr. Maule had not yet heard of the death of Mr. Bonteen. He\nhad remained at home till nearly four, having a great object in view,\nwhich made him deem it expedient that he should go direct from his\nown rooms to Madame Goesler's house, and had not even looked in at\nhis club. The reader will, perhaps, divine the great object. On this\nday he proposed to ask Madame Goesler to make him the happiest of\nmen,--as he certainly would have thought himself for a time, had\nshe consented to put him in possession of her large income. He had\ntherefore padded himself with more than ordinary care,--reduced but\nnot obliterated the greyness of his locks,--looked carefully to the\nfitting of his trousers, and spared himself those ordinary labours of\nthe morning which might have robbed him of any remaining spark of his\njuvenility.\n\nMadame Goesler met him more than half across the room as he entered\nit. \"What have you heard?\" said she. Mr. Maule wore his sweetest\nsmile, but he had heard nothing. He could only press her hand, and\nlook blank,--understanding that there was something which he ought to\nhave heard. She thought nothing of the pressure of her hand. Apt as\nshe was to be conscious at an instant of all that was going on around\nher, she thought of nothing now but that man's peril, and of the\ntruth or falsehood of the story that had been sent to her. \"You have\nheard nothing of Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Mr. Maule, withdrawing his hand. \"What has\nhappened to Mr. Finn?\" Had Mr. Finn broken his neck it would have\nbeen nothing to Mr. Maule. But the lady's solicitude was something to\nhim.\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen has been--murdered!\"\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen!\"\n\n\"So I hear. I thought you had come to tell me of it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen murdered! No;--I have heard nothing. I do not know the\ngentleman. I thought you said--Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"It is not known about London, then?\"\n\n\"I cannot say, Madame Goesler. I have just come from home, and have\nnot been out all the morning. Who has--murdered him?\"\n\n\"Ah! I do not know. That is what I wanted you to tell me.\"\n\n\"But what of Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"I also have not been out, Mr. Maule, and can give you no\ninformation. I thought you had called because you knew that Mr. Finn\nhad dined here.\"\n\n\"Has Mr. Finn been murdered?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen! I said that the report was that Mr. Bonteen had been\nmurdered.\" Madame Goesler was now waxing angry,--most unreasonably.\n\"But I know nothing about it, and am just going out to make inquiry.\nThe carriage is ordered.\" Then she stood, expecting him to go; and\nhe knew that he was expected to go. It was at any rate clear to him\nthat he could not carry out his great design on the present occasion.\n\"This has so upset me that I can think of nothing else at present,\nand you must, if you please, excuse me. I would not have let you take\nthe trouble of coming up, had not I thought that you were the bearer\nof some news.\" Then she bowed, and Mr. Maule bowed; and as he left\nthe room she forgot to ring the bell.\n\n\"What the deuce can she have meant about that fellow Finn?\" he said\nto himself. \"They cannot both have been murdered.\" He went to his\nclub, and there he soon learned the truth. The information was given\nto him with clear and undoubting words. Phineas Finn and Mr. Bonteen\nhad quarrelled at The Universe. Mr. Bonteen, as far as words went,\nhad got the best of his adversary. This had taken place in the\npresence of the Prince, who had expressed himself as greatly annoyed\nby Mr. Finn's conduct. And afterwards Phineas Finn had waylaid Mr.\nBonteen in the passage between Bolton Row and Berkeley Street, and\nhad there--murdered him. As it happened, no one who had been at The\nUniverse was at that moment present; but the whole affair was now\nquite well known, and was spoken of without a doubt.\n\n\"I hope he'll be hung, with all my heart,\" said Mr. Maule, who\nthought that he could read the riddle which had been so\nunintelligible in Park Lane.\n\nWhen Madame Goesler reached Carlton Terrace, which she did before the\ntime named by the Duchess, her friend had not yet returned. But she\nwent upstairs, as she had been desired, and they brought her tea. But\nthe teapot remained untouched till past six o'clock, and then the\nDuchess returned. \"Oh, my dear, I am so sorry for being late. Why\nhaven't you had tea?\"\n\n\"What is the truth of it all?\" said Madame Goesler, standing up with\nher fists clenched as they hung by her side.\n\n\"I don't seem to know nearly as much as I did when I wrote to you.\"\n\n\"Has the man been--murdered?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes. There's no doubt about that. I was quite sure of that\nwhen I sent the letter. I have had such a hunt. But at last I went up\nto the door of the House of Commons, and got Barrington Erle to come\nout to me.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Two men have been arrested.\"\n\n\"Not Phineas Finn?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Finn is one of them. Is it not awful? So much more dreadful\nto me than the other poor man's death! One oughtn't to say so, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"And who is the other man? Of course he did it.\"\n\n\"That horrid Jew preaching man that married Lizzie Eustace. Mr.\nBonteen had been persecuting him, and making out that he had another\nwife at home in Hungary, or Bohemia, or somewhere.\"\n\n\"Of course he did it.\"\n\n\"That's what I say. Of course the Jew did it. But then all the\nevidence goes to show that he didn't do it. He was in bed at the\ntime; and the door of the house was locked up so that he couldn't get\nout; and the man who did the murder hadn't got on his coat, but had\ngot on Phineas Finn's coat.\"\n\n\"Was there--blood?\" asked Madame Goesler, shaking from head to foot.\n\n\"Not that I know. I don't suppose they've looked yet. But Lord Fawn\nsaw the man, and swears to the coat.\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn! How I have always hated that man! I wouldn't believe a\nword he would say.\"\n\n\"Barrington doesn't think so much of the coat. But Phineas had a club\nin his pocket, and the man was killed by a club. There hasn't been\nany other club found, but Phineas Finn took his home with him.\"\n\n\"A murderer would not have done that.\"\n\n\"Barrington says that the head policeman says that it is just what a\nvery clever murderer would do.\"\n\n\"Do you believe it, Duchess?\"\n\n\"Certainly not;--not though Lord Fawn swore that he had seen it. I\nnever will believe what I don't like to believe, and nothing shall\never make me.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Well;--for the matter of that, I suppose he could.\"\n\n\"No, Duchess, he could not have done it.\"\n\n\"He is strong enough,--and brave enough.\"\n\n\"But not enough of a coward. There is nothing cowardly about him.\nIf Phineas Finn could have struck an enemy with a club, in a dark\npassage, behind his back, I will never care to speak to any man\nagain. Nothing shall make me believe it. If I did, I could never\nagain believe in any one. If they told you that your husband had\nmurdered a man, what would you say?\"\n\n\"But he isn't your husband, Madame Max.\"\n\n\"No;--certainly not. I cannot fly at them, when they say so, as you\nwould do. But I can be just as sure. If twenty Lord Fawns swore that\nthey had seen it, I would not believe them. Oh, God, what will they\ndo with him!\"\n\nThe Duchess behaved very well to her friend, saying not a single word\nto twit her with the love which she betrayed. She seemed to take\nit as a matter of course that Madame Goesler's interest in Phineas\nFinn should be as it was. The Duke, she said, could not come home\nto dinner, and Madame Goesler should stay with her. Both Houses\nwere in such a ferment about the murder, that nobody liked to be\naway. Everybody had been struck with amazement, not simply,--not\nchiefly,--by the fact of the murder, but by the double destruction of\nthe two men whose ill-will to each other had been of late so often\nthe subject of conversation. So Madame Goesler remained at Carlton\nTerrace till late in the evening, and during the whole visit there\nwas nothing mentioned but the murder of Mr. Bonteen and the peril of\nPhineas Finn. \"Some one will go and see him, I suppose,\" said Madame\nGoesler.\n\n\"Lord Cantrip has been already,--and Mr. Monk.\"\n\n\"Could not I go?\"\n\n\"Well, it would be rather strong.\"\n\n\"If we both went together?\" suggested Madame Goesler. And before she\nleft Carlton Terrace she had almost extracted a promise from the\nDuchess that they would together proceed to the prison and endeavour\nto see Phineas Finn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nSHOWING WHAT MRS. BUNCE SAID TO THE POLICEMAN.\n\n\n\"We have left Adelaide Palliser down at the Hall. We are up here\nonly for a couple of days to see Laura, and try to find out what had\nbetter be done about Kennedy.\" This was said to Phineas Finn in his\nown room in Great Marlborough Street by Lord Chiltern, on the morning\nafter the murder, between ten and eleven o'clock. Phineas had not\nas yet heard of the death of the man with whom he had quarrelled.\nLord Chiltern had now come to him with some proposition which he as\nyet did not understand, and which Lord Chiltern certainly did not\nknow how to explain. Looked at simply, the proposition was one for\nproviding Phineas Finn with an income out of the wealth belonging,\nor that would belong, to the Standish family. Lady Laura's fortune\nwould, it was thought, soon be at her own disposal. They who acted\nfor her husband had assured the Earl that the yearly interest of the\nmoney should be at her ladyship's command as soon as the law would\nallow them so to plan it. Of Robert Kennedy's inability to act for\nhimself there was no longer any doubt whatever, and there was, they\nsaid, no desire to embarrass the estate with so small a disputed\nmatter as the income derived from \u00c2\u00a340,000. There was great pride\nof purse in the manner in which the information was conveyed;--but\nnot the less on that account was it satisfactory to the Earl. Lady\nLaura's first thought about it referred to the imminent wants of\nPhineas Finn. How might it be possible for her to place a portion of\nher income at the command of the man she loved so that he should not\nfeel disgraced by receiving it from her hand? She conceived some plan\nas to a loan to be made nominally by her brother,--a plan as to which\nit may at once be said that it could not be made to hold water for a\nminute. But she did succeed in inducing her brother to undertake the\nembassy, with the view of explaining to Phineas that there would be\nmoney for him when he wanted it. \"If I make it over to Papa, Papa can\nleave it him in his will; and if he wants it at once there can be no\nharm in your advancing to him what he must have at Papa's death.\"\nHer brother had frowned angrily and had shaken his head. \"Think how\nhe has been thrown over by all the party,\" said Lady Laura. Lord\nChiltern had disliked the whole affair,--had felt with dismay that\nhis sister's name would become subject to reproach if it should be\nknown that this young man was supported by her bounty. She, however,\nhad persisted, and he had consented to see the young man, feeling\nsure that Phineas would refuse to bear the burden of the obligation.\n\nBut he had not touched the disagreeable subject when they were\ninterrupted. A knocking of the door had been heard, and now Mrs.\nBunce came upstairs, bringing Mr. Low with her. Mrs. Bunce had\nnot heard of the tragedy, but she had at once perceived from the\nbarrister's manner that there was some serious matter forward,--some\nmatter that was probably not only serious, but also calamitous. The\nexpression of her countenance announced as much to the two men, and\nthe countenance of Mr. Low when he followed her into the room told\nthe same story still more plainly. \"Is anything the matter?\" said\nPhineas, jumping up.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said Mr. Low, who then looked at Lord Chiltern and was\nsilent.\n\n\"Shall I go?\" said Lord Chiltern. Mr. Low did not know him, and of\ncourse was still silent.\n\n\"This is my friend, Mr. Low. This is my friend, Lord Chiltern,\" said\nPhineas, aware that each was well acquainted with the other's name.\n\"I do not know of any reason why you should go. What is it, Low?\"\n\nLord Chiltern had come there about money, and it occurred to him\nthat the impecunious young barrister might already be in some scrape\non that head. In nineteen cases out of twenty, when a man is in a\nscrape, he simply wants money. \"Perhaps I can be of help,\" he said.\n\n\"Have you heard, my Lord, what happened last night?\" said Mr. Low,\nwith his eyes fixed on Phineas Finn.\n\n\"I have heard nothing,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Phineas, looking aghast. He knew Mr. Low\nwell enough to be sure that the thing referred to was of great and\ndistressing moment.\n\n\"You, too, have heard nothing?\"\n\n\"Not a word--that I know of.\"\n\n\"You were at The Universe last night?\"\n\n\"Certainly I was.\"\n\n\"Did anything occur?\"\n\n\"The Prince was there.\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened to the Prince?\" said Chiltern.\n\n\"His name has not been mentioned to me,\" said Mr. Low. \"Was there not\na quarrel?\"\n\n\"Yes;\"--said Phineas. \"I quarrelled with Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"He behaved like a brute;--as he always does. Thrashing a brute\nhardly answers nowadays, but if ever a man deserved a thrashing he\ndoes.\"\n\n\"He has been murdered,\" said Mr. Low.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"He has been murdered,\" said Mr. Low.]\n\n\nThe reader need hardly be told that, as regards this great offence,\nPhineas Finn was as white as snow. The maintenance of any doubt on\nthat matter,--were it even desirable to maintain a doubt,--would be\naltogether beyond the power of the present writer. The reader has\nprobably perceived, from the first moment of the discovery of the\nbody on the steps at the end of the passage, that Mr. Bonteen had\nbeen killed by that ingenious gentleman, the Rev. Mr. Emilius, who\nfound it to be worth his while to take the step with the view of\nsuppressing his enemy's evidence as to his former marriage. But Mr.\nLow, when he entered the room, had been inclined to think that his\nfriend had done the deed. Laurence Fitzgibbon, who had been one of\nthe first to hear the story, and who had summoned Erle to go with him\nand Major Mackintosh to Downing Street, had, in the first place, gone\nto the house in Carey Street, in which Bunce was wont to work, and\nhad sent him to Mr. Low. He, Fitzgibbon, had not thought it safe that\nhe himself should warn his countryman, but he could not bear to think\nthat the hare should be knocked over on its form, or that his friend\nshould be taken by policemen without notice. So he had sent Bunce to\nMr. Low, and Mr. Low had now come with his tidings.\n\n\"Murdered!\" exclaimed Phineas.\n\n\"Who has murdered him?\" said Lord Chiltern, looking first at Mr. Low\nand then at Phineas.\n\n\"That is what the police are now endeavouring to find out.\" Then\nthere was a pause, and Phineas stood up with his hand on his\nforehead, looking savagely from one to the other. A glimmer of an\nidea of the truth was beginning to cross his brain. Mr. Low was there\nwith the object of asking him whether he had murdered the man! \"Mr.\nFitzgibbon was with you last night,\" continued Mr. Low.\n\n\"Of course he was.\"\n\n\"It was he who has sent me to you.\"\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Lord Chiltern. \"I suppose they do not\nintend to say that--our friend, here--murdered the man.\"\n\n\"I begin to suppose that is what they intend to say,\" rejoined\nPhineas, scornfully.\n\nMr. Low had entered the room, doubting indeed, but still inclined\nto believe,--as Bunce had very clearly believed,--that the hands of\nPhineas Finn were red with the blood of this man who had been killed.\nAnd, had he been questioned on such a matter, when no special case\nwas before his mind, he would have declared of himself that a few\ntones from the voice, or a few glances from the eye, of a suspected\nman would certainly not suffice to eradicate suspicion. But now he\nwas quite sure,--almost quite sure,--that Phineas was as innocent as\nhimself. To Lord Chiltern, who had heard none of the details, the\nsuspicion was so monstrous as to fill him with wrath. \"You don't mean\nto tell us, Mr. Low, that any one says that Finn killed the man?\"\n\n\"I have come as his friend,\" said Low, \"to put him on his guard. The\naccusation will be made against him.\"\n\nTo Phineas, not clearly looking at it, not knowing very accurately\nwhat had happened, not being in truth quite sure that Mr. Bonteen was\nactually dead, this seemed to be a continuation of the persecution\nwhich he believed himself to have suffered from that man's hand. \"I\ncan believe anything from that quarter,\" he said.\n\n\"From what quarter?\" asked Lord Chiltern. \"We had better let Mr. Low\ntell us what really has happened.\"\n\nThen Mr. Low told the story, as well as he knew it, describing the\nspot on which the body had been found. \"Often as I go to the club,\"\nsaid Phineas, \"I never was through that passage in my life.\" Mr. Low\nwent on with his tale, telling how the man had been killed with some\nshort bludgeon. \"I had that in my pocket,\" said Finn, producing the\nlife-preserver. \"I have almost always had something of the kind when\nI have been in London, since that affair of Kennedy's.\" Mr. Low cast\none glance at it,--to see whether it had been washed or scraped, or\nin any way cleansed. Phineas saw the glance, and was angry. \"There it\nis, as it is. You can make the most of it. I shall not touch it again\ntill the policeman comes. Don't put your hand on it, Chiltern. Leave\nit there.\" And the instrument was left lying on the table, untouched.\nMr. Low went on with his story. He had heard nothing of Yosef Mealyus\nas connected with the murder, but some indistinct reference to Lord\nFawn and the top-coat had been made to him. \"There is the coat, too,\"\nsaid Phineas, taking it from the sofa on which he had flung it when\nhe came home the previous night. It was a very light coat,--fitted\nfor May use,--lined with silk, and by no means suited for enveloping\nthe face or person. But it had a collar which might be made to stand\nup. \"That at any rate was the coat I wore,\" said Finn, in answer to\nsome observation from the barrister. \"The man that Lord Fawn saw,\"\nsaid Mr. Low, \"was, as I understand, enveloped in a heavy great\ncoat.\" \"So Fawn has got his finger in the pie!\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\nMr. Low had been there an hour, Lord Chiltern remaining also in\nthe room, when there came three men belonging to the police,--a\nsuperintendent and with him two constables. When the men were shown\nup into the room neither the bludgeon or the coat had been moved\nfrom the small table as Phineas had himself placed them there. Both\nPhineas and Chiltern had lit cigars, and they were all there sitting\nin silence. Phineas had entertained the idea that Mr. Low believed\nthe charge, and that the barrister was therefore an enemy. Mr. Low\nhad perceived this, but had not felt it to be his duty to declare his\nopinion of his friend's innocence. What he could do for his friend\nhe would do; but, as he thought, he could serve him better now by\nsilent observation than by protestation. Lord Chiltern, who had\nbeen implored by Phineas not to leave him, continued to pour forth\nunabating execrations on the monstrous malignity of the accusers.\n\"I do not know that there are any accusers,\" said Mr. Low, \"except\nthe circumstances which the police must, of course, investigate.\"\nThen the men came, and the nature of their duty was soon explained.\nThey must request Mr. Finn to go with them to Bow Street. They took\npossession of many articles besides the two which had been prepared\nfor them,--the dress coat and shirt which Phineas had worn, and the\nboots. He had gone out to dinner with a Gibus hat, and they took\nthat. They took his umbrella and his latch-key. They asked, even, as\nto his purse and money;--but abstained from taking the purse when\nMr. Low suggested that they could have no concern with that. As it\nhappened, Phineas was at the moment wearing the shirt in which he\nhad dined out on the previous day, and the men asked him whether\nhe had any objection to change it in their presence,--as it might\nbe necessary, after the examination, that it should be detained\nas evidence. He did so, in the presence of all the men assembled;\nbut the humiliation of doing it almost broke his heart. Then they\nsearched among his linen, clean and dirty, and asked questions of\nMrs. Bunce in audible whispers behind the door. Whatever Mrs. Bunce\ncould do to injure the cause of her favourite lodger by severity\nof manner, snubbing the policeman, and determination to give no\ninformation, she did do. \"Had a shirt washed? How do you suppose a\ngentleman's shirts are washed? You were brought up near enough to\na washtub yourself to know more than I can tell you!\" But the very\nrespectable constable did not seem to be in the least annoyed by the\nlandlady's amenities.\n\nHe was taken to Bow Street, going thither in a cab with the two\npolicemen, and the superintendent followed them with Lord Chiltern\nand Mr. Low. \"You don't mean to say that you believe it?\" said Lord\nChiltern to the officer. \"We never believe and we never disbelieve\nanything, my Lord,\" replied the man. Nevertheless, the superintendent\ndid most firmly believe that Phineas Finn had murdered Mr. Bonteen.\n\nAt the police-office Phineas was met by Lord Cantrip and Barrington\nErle, and soon became aware that both Lord Fawn and Fitzgibbon were\npresent. It seemed that everything else was made to give way to this\ninquiry, as he was at once confronted by the magistrate. Everybody\nwas personally very civil to him, and he was asked whether he would\nnot wish to have professional advice while the charge was being made\nagainst him. But this he declined. He would tell the magistrate,\nhe said, all he knew, but, at any rate for the present, he would\nhave no need of advice. He was, at last, allowed to tell his own\nstory,--after repeated cautions. There had been some words between\nhim and Mr. Bonteen in the club; after which, standing at the door of\nthe club with his friends, Mr. Erle and Mr. Fitzgibbon, who were now\nin court, he had seen Mr. Bonteen walk away towards Berkeley Square.\nHe had soon followed, but had never overtaken Mr. Bonteen. When\nreaching the Square he had crossed over to the fountain standing\nthere on the south side, and from thence had taken the shortest way\nup Bruton Street. He had seen Mr. Bonteen for the last time dimly,\nby the gaslight, at the corner of the Square. As far as he could\nremember, he himself had at the moment passed the fountain. He had\nnot heard the sound of any struggle, or of words, round the corner\ntowards Piccadilly. By the time that Mr. Bonteen would have reached\nthe head of the steps leading into the passage, he would have been\nnear Bruton Street, with his back completely turned to the scene of\nthe murder. He had walked faster than Mr. Bonteen, having gradually\ndrawn near to him; but he had determined in his own mind that he\nwould not pass the man, or get so near him as to attract attention.\nNor had he done so. He had certainly worn the grey coat which was\nnow produced. The collar of it had not been turned up. The coat was\nnearly new, and to the best of his belief the collar had never been\nturned up. He had carried the life-preserver now produced with him\nbecause it had once before been necessary for him to attack garotters\nin the street. The life-preserver had never been used, and, as it\nhappened, was quite new. It had been bought about a month since,--in\nconsequence of some commotion about garotters which had just then\ntaken place. But before the purchase of the life-preserver he had\nbeen accustomed to carry some stick or bludgeon at night. Undoubtedly\nhe had quarrelled with Mr. Bonteen before this occasion, and had\nbought this instrument since the commencement of the quarrel. He had\nnot seen any one on his way from the Square to his own house with\nsufficient observation to enable him to describe such person. He\ncould not remember that he had passed a policeman on his way home.\n\nThis took place after the hearing of such evidence as was then given.\nThe statements made both by Erle and Fitzgibbon as to what had taken\nplace in the club, and afterwards at the door, tallied exactly with\nthat afterwards given by Phineas. An accurate measurement of the\nstreets and ways concerned was already furnished. Taking the duration\nof time as surmised by Erle and Fitzgibbon to have passed after they\nhad turned their back upon Phineas, a constable proved that the\nprisoner would have had time to hurry back to the corner of the\nstreet he had passed, and to be in the place where Lord Fawn saw the\nman,--supposing that Lord Fawn had walked at the rate of three miles\nan hour, and that Phineas had walked or run at twice that pace. Lord\nFawn stated that he was walking very slow,--less he thought than\nthree miles an hour, and that the man was hurrying very fast,--not\nabsolutely running, but going as he thought at quite double his own\npace. The two coats were shown to his lordship. Finn knew nothing\nof the other coat,--which had, in truth, been taken from the Rev.\nMr. Emilius,--a rough, thick, brown coat, which had belonged to the\npreacher for the last two years. Finn's coat was grey in colour. Lord\nFawn looked at the coats very attentively, and then said that the man\nhe had seen had certainly not worn the brown coat. The night had been\ndark, but still he was sure that the coat had been grey. The collar\nhad certainly been turned up. Then a tailor was produced who gave it\nas his opinion that Finn's coat had been lately worn with the collar\nraised.\n\nIt was considered that the evidence given was sufficient to make a\nremand imperative, and Phineas Finn was committed to Newgate. He was\nassured that every attention should be paid to his comfort, and was\ntreated with great consideration. Lord Cantrip, who still believed in\nhim, discussed the subject both with the magistrate and with Major\nMackintosh. Of course the strictest search would be made for a second\nlife-preserver, or any such weapon as might have been used. Search\nhad already been made, and no such weapon had been as yet found.\nEmilius had never been seen with any such weapon. No one about Curzon\nStreet or Mayfair could be found who had seen the man with the\nquick step and raised collar, who doubtless had been the murderer,\nexcept Lord Fawn,--so that no evidence was forthcoming tending to\nshow that Phineas Finn could not have been that man. The evidence\nadduced to prove that Mr. Emilius,--or Mealyus, as he was henceforth\ncalled,--could not have been on the spot was so very strong, that the\nmagistrate told the constables that that man must be released on the\nnext examination unless something could be adduced against him.\n\nThe magistrate, with the profoundest regret, was unable to agree\nwith Lord Cantrip in his opinion that the evidence adduced was not\nsufficient to demand the temporary committal of Mr. Finn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nWHAT THE LORDS AND COMMONS SAID ABOUT THE MURDER.\n\n\nWhen the House met on that Thursday at four o'clock everybody was\ntalking about the murder, and certainly four-fifths of the members\nhad made up their minds that Phineas Finn was the murderer. To have\nknown a murdered man is something, but to have been intimate with\na murderer is certainly much more. There were many there who were\nreally sorry for poor Bonteen,--of whom without a doubt the end had\ncome in a very horrible manner; and there were more there who were\npersonally fond of Phineas Finn,--to whom the future of the young\nmember was very sad, and the fact that he should have become a\nmurderer very awful. But, nevertheless, the occasion was not without\nits consolations. The business of the House is not always exciting,\nor even interesting. On this afternoon there was not a member who\ndid not feel that something had occurred which added an interest to\nParliamentary life.\n\nVery soon after prayers Mr. Gresham entered the House, and men who\nhad hitherto been behaving themselves after a most unparliamentary\nfashion, standing about in knots, talking by no means in whispers,\nmoving in and out of the House rapidly, all crowded into their\nplaces. Whatever pretence of business had been going on was stopped\nin a moment, and Mr. Gresham rose to make his statement. \"It was with\nthe deepest regret,--nay, with the most profound sorrow,--that he was\ncalled upon to inform the House that his right honourable friend and\ncolleague, Mr. Bonteen, had been basely and cruelly murdered during\nthe past night.\" It was odd then to see how the name of the man, who,\nwhile he was alive and a member of that House, could not have been\npronounced in that assembly without disorder, struck the members\nalmost with dismay. \"Yes, his friend Mr. Bonteen, who had so lately\nfilled the office of President of the Board of Trade, and whose\nloss the country and that House could so ill bear, had been beaten\nto death in one of the streets of the metropolis by the arm of a\ndastardly ruffian during the silent watches of the night.\" Then Mr.\nGresham paused, and every one expected that some further statement\nwould be made. \"He did not know that he had any further communication\nto make on the subject. Some little time must elapse before he could\nfill the office. As for adequately supplying the loss, that would\nbe impossible. Mr. Bonteen's services to the country, especially in\nreference to decimal coinage, were too well known to the House to\nallow of his holding out any such hope.\" Then he sat down without\nhaving as yet made an allusion to Phineas Finn.\n\nBut the allusion was soon made. Mr. Daubeny rose, and with much\ngraceful and mysterious circumlocution asked the Prime Minister\nwhether it was true that a member of the House had been arrested, and\nwas now in confinement on the charge of having been concerned in the\nmurder of the late much-lamented President of the Board of Trade.\nHe--Mr. Daubeny--had been given to understand that such a charge had\nbeen made against an honourable member of that House, who had once\nbeen a colleague of Mr. Bonteen's, and who had always supported the\nright honourable gentleman opposite. Then Mr. Gresham rose again.\n\"He regretted to say that the honourable member for Tankerville was\nin custody on that charge. The House would of course understand that\nhe only made that statement as a fact, and that he was offering no\nopinion as to who was the perpetrator of the murder. The case seemed\nto be shrouded in great mystery. The two gentlemen had unfortunately\ndiffered, but he did not at all think that the House would on that\naccount be disposed to attribute guilt so black and damning to\na gentleman they had all known so well as the honourable member\nfor Tankerville.\" So much and no more was spoken publicly, to the\nreporters; but members continued to talk about the affair the whole\nevening.\n\nThere was nothing, perhaps, more astonishing than the absence of\nrancour or abhorrence with which the name of Phineas was mentioned,\neven by those who felt most certain of his guilt. All those who had\nbeen present at the club acknowledged that Bonteen had been the\nsinner in reference to the transaction there; and it was acknowledged\nto have been almost a public misfortune that such a man as Bonteen\nshould have been able to prevail against such a one as Phineas Finn\nin regard to the presence of the latter in the Government. Stories\nwhich were exaggerated, accounts worse even than the truth, were\nbandied about as to the perseverance with which the murdered man\nhad destroyed the prospects of the supposed murderer, and robbed\nthe country of the services of a good workman. Mr. Gresham, in the\nofficial statement which he had made, had, as a matter of course,\nsaid many fine things about Mr. Bonteen. A man can always have fine\nthings said about him for a few hours after his death. But in the\nsmall private conferences which were held the fine things said all\nreferred to Phineas Finn. Mr. Gresham had spoken of a \"dastardly\nruffian in the silent watches,\" but one would have almost thought\nfrom overhearing what was said by various gentlemen in different\nparts of the House that upon the whole Phineas Finn was thought to\nhave done rather a good thing in putting poor Mr. Bonteen out of the\nway.\n\nAnd another pleasant feature of excitement was added by the prevalent\nidea that the Prince had seen and heard the row. Those who had been\nat the club at the time of course knew that this was not the case;\nbut the presence of the Prince at The Universe between the row and\nthe murder had really been a fact, and therefore it was only natural\nthat men should allow themselves the delight of mixing the Prince\nwith the whole concern. In remote circles the Prince was undoubtedly\nsupposed to have had a great deal to do with the matter, though\nwhether as abettor of the murdered or of the murderer was never\nplainly declared. A great deal was said about the Prince that evening\nin the House, so that many members were able to enjoy themselves\nthoroughly.\n\n\"What a godsend for Gresham,\" said one gentleman to Mr. Ratler very\nshortly after the strong eulogium which had been uttered on poor Mr.\nBonteen by the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Well,--yes; I was afraid that the poor fellow would never have got\non with us.\"\n\n\"Got on! He'd have been a thorn in Gresham's side as long as he\nheld office. If Finn should be acquitted, you ought to do something\nhandsome for him.\" Whereupon Mr. Ratler laughed heartily.\n\n\"It will pretty nearly break them up,\" said Sir Orlando Drought, one\nof Mr. Daubeny's late Secretaries of State to Mr. Roby, Mr. Daubeny's\nlate patronage secretary.\n\n\"I don't quite see that. They'll be able to drop their decimal\ncoinage with a good excuse, and that will be a great comfort. They\nare talking of getting Monk to go back to the Board of Trade.\"\n\n\"Will that strengthen them?\"\n\n\"Bonteen would have weakened them. The man had got beyond himself,\nand lost his head. They are better without him.\"\n\n\"I suppose Finn did it?\" asked Sir Orlando.\n\n\"Not a doubt about it, I'm told. The queer thing is that he should\nhave declared his purpose beforehand to Erle. Gresham says that\nall that must have been part of his plan,--so as to make men think\nafterwards that he couldn't have done it. Grogram's idea is that he\nhad planned the murder before he went to the club.\"\n\n\"Will the Prince have to give evidence?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Roby. \"That's all wrong. The Prince had left the\nclub before the row commenced. Confucius Putt says that the Prince\ndidn't hear a word of it. He was talking to the Prince all the time.\"\nConfucius Putt was the distinguished artist with whom the Prince had\nshaken hands on leaving the club.\n\nLord Drummond was in the Peers' Gallery, and Mr. Boffin was talking\nto him over the railings. It may be remembered that those two\ngentlemen had conscientiously left Mr. Daubeny's Cabinet because they\nhad been unable to support him in his views about the Church. After\nsuch sacrifice on their parts their minds were of course intent on\nChurch matters. \"There doesn't seem to be a doubt about it,\" said Mr.\nBoffin.\n\n\"Cantrip won't believe it,\" said the peer.\n\n\"He was at the Colonies with Cantrip, and Cantrip found him very\nagreeable. Everybody says that he was one of the pleasantest fellows\ngoing. This makes it out of the question that they should bring in\nany Church bill this Session.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--certainly. There will be nothing else thought of now till\nthe trial.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said his Lordship. \"It's an ill wind that blows\nno one any good. Will they have evidence for a conviction?\"\n\n\"Oh dear yes; not a doubt about it. Fawn can swear to him,\" said Mr.\nBoffin.\n\nBarrington Erle was telling his story for the tenth time when he was\nsummoned out of the Library to the Duchess of Omnium, who had made\nher way up into the lobby. \"Oh, Mr. Erle, do tell me what you really\nthink,\" said the Duchess.\n\n\"That is just what I can't do.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I don't know what to think.\"\n\n\"He can't have done it, Mr. Erle.\"\n\n\"That's just what I say to myself, Duchess.\"\n\n\"But they do say that the evidence is so very strong against him.\"\n\n\"Very strong.\"\n\n\"I wish we could get that Lord Fawn out of the way.\"\n\n\"Ah;--but we can't.\"\n\n\"And will they--hang him?\"\n\n\"If they convict him, they will.\"\n\n\"A man we all knew so well! And just when we had made up our minds to\ndo everything for him. Do you know I'm not a bit surprised. I've felt\nbefore now as though I should like to have done it myself.\"\n\n\"He could be very nasty, Duchess!\"\n\n\"I did so hate that man. But I'd give,--oh, I don't know what I'd\ngive to bring him to life again this minute. What will Lady Laura\ndo?\" In answer to this, Barrington Erle only shrugged his shoulders.\nLady Laura was his cousin. \"We mustn't give him up, you know, Mr.\nErle.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Surely we can do something. Can't we get it in the papers that he\nmust be innocent,--so that everybody should be made to think so? And\nif we could get hold of the lawyers, and make them not want to--to\ndestroy him! There's nothing I wouldn't do. There's no getting hold\nof a judge, I know.\"\n\n\"No, Duchess. The judges are stone.\"\n\n\"Not that they are a bit better than anybody else,--only they like to\nbe safe.\"\n\n\"They do like to be safe.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we could do it if we put our shoulders to the wheel. I\ndon't believe, you know, for a moment that he murdered him. It was\ndone by Lizzie Eustace's Jew.\"\n\n\"It will be sifted, of course.\"\n\n\"But what's the use of sifting if Mr. Finn is to be hung while it's\nbeing done? I don't think anything of the police. Do you remember how\nthey bungled about that woman's necklace? I don't mean to give him\nup, Mr. Erle; and I expect you to help me.\" Then the Duchess returned\nhome, and, as we know, found Madame Goesler at her house.\n\nNothing whatever was done that night, either in the Lords or Commons.\nA \"statement\" about Mr. Bonteen was made in the Upper as well as\nin the Lower House, and after that statement any real work was out\nof the question. Had Mr. Bonteen absolutely been Chancellor of the\nExchequer, and in the Cabinet when he was murdered, and had Phineas\nFinn been once more an Under-Secretary of State, the commotion\nand excitement could hardly have been greater. Even the Duke of\nSt. Bungay had visited the spot,--well known to him, as there the\nurban domains meet of two great Whig peers, with whom and whose\npredecessors he had long been familiar. He also had known Phineas\nFinn, and not long since had said civil words to him and of him. He,\ntoo, had, of late days, especially disliked Mr. Bonteen, and had\nalmost insisted that the man now murdered should not be admitted into\nthe Cabinet. He had heard what was the nature of the evidence;--had\nheard of the quarrel, the life-preserver, and the grey coat. \"I\nsuppose he must have done it,\" said the Duke of St. Bungay to himself\nas he walked away up Hay Hill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n\"YOU THINK IT SHAMEFUL.\"\n\n\nThe tidings of what had taken place first reached Lady Laura Kennedy\nfrom her brother on his return to Portman Square after the scene in\nthe police court. The object of his visit to Finn's lodgings has\nbeen explained, but the nature of Lady Laura's vehemence in urging\nupon her brother the performance of a very disagreeable task has not\nbeen sufficiently described. No brother would willingly go on such a\nmission from a married sister to a man who had been publicly named\nas that sister's lover;--and no brother could be less likely to do\nso than Lord Chiltern. But Lady Laura had been very stout in her\narguments, and very strong-willed in her purpose. The income arising\nfrom this money,--which had been absolutely her own,--would again be\nexclusively her own should the claim to it on behalf of her husband's\nestate be abandoned. Surely she might do what she liked with her own.\nIf her brother would not assist her in making this arrangement, it\nmust be done by other means. She was quite willing that it should\nappear to come to Mr. Finn from her father and not from herself. Did\nher brother think any ill of her? Did he believe in the calumnies of\nthe newspapers? Did he or his wife for a moment conceive that she\nhad a lover? When he looked at her, worn out, withered, an old woman\nbefore her time, was it possible that he should so believe? She\nherself asked him these questions. Lord Chiltern of course declared\nthat he had no suspicion of the kind. \"No;--indeed,\" said Lady Laura.\n\"I defy any one to suspect me who knows me. And if so, why am not\nI as much entitled to help a friend as you might be? You need not\neven mention my name.\" He endeavoured to make her understand that her\nname would be mentioned, and others would believe and would say evil\nthings. \"They cannot say worse than they have said,\" she continued.\n\"And yet what harm have they done to me,--or you?\" Then he demanded\nwhy she desired to go so far out of her way with the view of spending\nher money upon one who was in no way connected with her. \"Because\nI like him better than any one else,\" she answered, boldly. \"There\nis very little left for which I care at all;--but I do care for his\nprosperity. He was once in love with me and told me so,--but I had\nchosen to give my hand to Mr. Kennedy. He is not in love with me\nnow,--nor I with him; but I choose to regard him as my friend.\" He\nassured her over and over again that Phineas Finn would certainly\nrefuse to touch her money;--but this she declined to believe. At any\nrate the trial might be made. He would not refuse money left to him\nby will, and why should he not now enjoy that which was intended for\nhim? Then she explained how certain it was that he must speedily\nvanish out of the world altogether, unless some assurance of an\nincome were made to him. So Lord Chiltern went on his mission, hardly\nmeaning to make the offer, and confident that it would be refused\nif made. We know the nature of the new trouble in which he found\nPhineas Finn enveloped. It was such that Lord Chiltern did not open\nhis mouth about money, and now, having witnessed the scene at the\npolice-office, he had come back to tell his tale to his sister. She\nwas sitting with his wife when he entered the room.\n\n\"Have you heard anything?\" he asked at once.\n\n\"Heard what?\" said his wife.\n\n\"Then you have not heard it. A man has been murdered.\"\n\n\"What man?\" said Lady Laura, jumping suddenly from her seat. \"Not\nRobert!\" Lord Chiltern shook his head. \"You do not mean that Mr. Finn\nhas been--killed!\" Again he shook his head; and then she sat down as\nthough the asking of the two questions had exhausted her.\n\n\"Speak, Oswald,\" said his wife. \"Why do you not tell us? Is it one\nwhom we knew?\"\n\n\"I think that Laura used to know him. Mr. Bonteen was murdered last\nnight in the streets.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen! The man who was Mr. Finn's enemy,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Mr. Bonteen!\" said Lady Laura, as though the murder of twenty Mr.\nBonteens were nothing to her.\n\n\"Yes;--the man whom you talk of as Finn's enemy. It would be better\nif there were no such talk.\"\n\n\"And who killed him?\" said Lady Laura, again getting up and coming\nclose to her brother.\n\n\"Who was it, Oswald?\" asked his wife; and she also was now too deeply\ninterested to keep her seat.\n\n\"They have arrested two men,\" said Lord Chiltern;--\"that Jew who\nmarried Lady Eustace, and--\" But there he paused. He had determined\nbeforehand that he would tell his sister the double arrest that the\ndoubt this implied might lessen the weight of the blow; but now he\nfound it almost impossible to mention the name.\n\n\"Who is the other, Oswald?\" said his wife.\n\n\"Not Phineas,\" screamed Lady Laura.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; they have arrested him, and I have just come from\nthe court.\" He had no time to go on, for his sister was crouching\nprostrate on the floor before him. She had not fainted. Women do\nnot faint under such shocks. But in her agony she had crouched down\nrather than fallen, as though it were vain to attempt to stand\nupright with so crushing a weight of sorrow on her back. She uttered\none loud shriek, and then covering her face with her hands burst out\ninto a wail of sobs. Lady Chiltern and her brother both tried to\nraise her, but she would not be lifted. \"Why will you not hear me\nthrough, Laura?\" said he.\n\n\"You do not think he did it?\" said his wife.\n\n\"I'm sure he did not,\" replied Lord Chiltern.\n\nThe poor woman, half-lying, half-seated, on the floor, still hiding\nher face with her hands, still bursting with half suppressed sobs,\nheard and understood both the question and the answer. But the fact\nwas not altered to her,--nor the condition of the man she loved.\nShe had not yet begun to think whether it were possible that he\nshould have been guilty of such a crime. She had heard none of the\ncircumstances, and knew nothing of the manner of the man's death. It\nmight be that Phineas had killed the man, bringing himself within the\nreach of the law, and that yet he should have done nothing to merit\nher reproaches;--hardly even her reprobation! Hitherto she felt only\nthe sorrow, the annihilation of the blow;--but not the shame with\nwhich it would overwhelm the man for whom she so much coveted the\ngood opinion of the world.\n\n\"You hear what he says, Laura.\"\n\n\"They are determined to destroy him,\" she sobbed out, through her\ntears.\n\n\"They are not determined to destroy him at all,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\"It will have to go by evidence. You had better sit up and let me\ntell you all. I will tell you nothing till you are seated again. You\ndisgrace yourself by sprawling there.\"\n\n\"Do not be hard to her, Oswald.\"\n\n\"I am disgraced,\" said Lady Laura, slowly rising and placing herself\nagain on the sofa. \"If there is anything more to tell, you can tell\nit. I do not care what happens to me now, or who knows it. They\ncannot make my life worse than it is.\"\n\nThen he told all the story,--of the quarrel, and the position of the\nstreets, of the coat, and the bludgeon, and the three blows, each on\nthe head, by which the man had been killed. And he told them also how\nthe Jew was said never to have been out of his bed, and how the Jew's\ncoat was not the coat Lord Fawn had seen, and how no stain of blood\nhad been found about the raiment of either of the men. \"It was the\nJew who did it, Oswald, surely,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"It was not Phineas Finn who did it,\" he replied.\n\n\"And they will let him go again?\"\n\n\"They will let him go when they find out the truth, I suppose. But\nthose fellows blunder so, I would never trust them. He will get some\nsharp lawyer to look into it; and then perhaps everything will come\nout. I shall go and see him to-morrow. But there is nothing further\nto be done.\"\n\n\"And I must see him,\" said Lady Laura slowly.\n\nLady Chiltern looked at her husband, and his face became redder than\nusual with an angry flush. When his sister had pressed him to take\nher message about the money, he had assured her that he suspected her\nof no evil. Nor had he ever thought evil of her. Since her marriage\nwith Mr. Kennedy, he had seen but little of her or of her ways of\nlife. When she had separated herself from her husband he had approved\nof the separation, and had even offered to assist her should she\nbe in difficulty. While she had been living a sad lonely life at\nDresden, he had simply pitied her, declaring to himself and his wife\nthat her lot in life had been very hard. When these calumnies about\nher and Phineas Finn had reached his ears,--or his eyes,--as such\ncalumnies always will reach the ears and eyes of those whom they\nare most capable of hurting, he had simply felt a desire to crush\nsome Quintus Slide, or the like, into powder for the offence. He had\nreceived Phineas in his own house with all his old friendship. He had\neven this morning been with the accused man as almost his closest\nfriend. But, nevertheless, there was creeping into his heart a sense\nof the shame with which he would be afflicted, should the world\nreally be taught to believe that the man had been his sister's lover.\nLady Laura's distress on the present occasion was such as a wife\nmight show, or a girl weeping for her lover, or a mother for her son,\nor a sister for a brother; but was extravagant and exaggerated in\nregard to such friendship as might be presumed to exist between the\nwife of Mr. Robert Kennedy and the member for Tankerville. He could\nsee that his wife felt this as he did, and he thought it necessary\nto say something at once, that might force his sister to moderate at\nany rate her language, if not her feelings. Two expressions of face\nwere natural to him; one eloquent of good humour, in which the reader\nof countenances would find some promise of coming frolic;--and\nthe other, replete with anger, sometimes to the extent almost of\nsavagery. All those who were dependent on him were wont to watch\nhis face with care and sometimes with fear. When he was angry it\nwould almost seem that he was about to use personal violence on the\nobject of his wrath. At the present moment he was rather grieved than\nenraged; but there came over his face that look of wrath with which\nall who knew him were so well acquainted. \"You cannot see him,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Why not I, as well as you?\"\n\n\"If you do not understand, I cannot tell you. But you must not see\nhim;--and you shall not.\"\n\n\"Who will hinder me?\"\n\n\"If you put me to it, I will see that you are hindered. What is the\nman to you that you should run the risk of evil tongues, for the sake\nof visiting him in gaol? You cannot save his life,--though it may be\nthat you might endanger it.\"\n\n\"Oswald,\" she said very slowly, \"I do not know that I am in any way\nunder your charge, or bound to submit to your orders.\"\n\n\"You are my sister.\"\n\n\"And I have loved you as a sister. How should it be possible that my\nseeing him should endanger his life?\"\n\n\"It will make people think that the things are true which have been\nsaid.\"\n\n\"And will they hang him because I love him? I do love him. Violet\nknows how well I have always loved him.\" Lord Chiltern turned his\nangry face upon his wife. Lady Chiltern put her arm round her\nsister-in-law's waist, and whispered some words into her ear. \"What\nis that to me?\" continued the half-frantic woman. \"I do love him. I\nhave always loved him. I shall love him to the end. He is all my life\nto me.\"\n\n\"Shame should prevent your telling it,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"I feel no shame. There is no disgrace in love. I did disgrace\nmyself when I gave the hand for which he asked to another man,\nbecause,--because--\" But she was too noble to tell her brother even\nthen that at the moment of her life to which she was alluding she had\nmarried the rich man, rejecting the poor man's hand, because she had\ngiven up all her fortune to the payment of her brother's debts. And\nhe, though he had well known what he had owed to her, and had never\nbeen easy till he had paid the debt, remembered nothing of all this\nnow. No lending and paying back of money could alter the nature\neither of his feelings or his duty in such an emergency as this.\n\"And, mind you,\" she continued, turning to her sister-in-law, \"there\nis no place for the shame of which he is thinking,\" and she pointed\nher finger out at her brother. \"I love him,--as a mother might love\nher child, I fancy; but he has no love for me; none;--none. When I am\nwith him, I am only a trouble to him. He comes to me, because he is\ngood; but he would sooner be with you. He did love me once;--but then\nI could not afford to be so loved.\"\n\n\"You can do no good by seeing him,\" said her brother.\n\n\"But I will see him. You need not scowl at me as though you wished\nto strike me. I have gone through that which makes me different from\nother women, and I care not what they say of me. Violet understands\nit all;--but you understand nothing.\"\n\n\"Be calm, Laura,\" said her sister-in-law, \"and Oswald will do all\nthat can be done.\"\n\n\"But they will hang him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said her brother. \"He has not been as yet committed for\nhis trial. Heaven knows how much has to be done. It is as likely as\nnot that in three days' time he will be out at large, and all the\nworld will be running after him just because he has been in Newgate.\"\n\n\"But who will look after him?\"\n\n\"He has plenty of friends. I will see that he is not left without\neverything that he wants.\"\n\n\"But he will want money.\"\n\n\"He has plenty of money for that. Do you take it quietly, and not\nmake a fool of yourself. If the worst comes to the worst--\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\"\n\n\"Listen to me, if you can listen. Should the worst come to the worst,\nwhich I believe to be altogether impossible,--mind, I think it next\nto impossible, for I have never for a moment believed him to be\nguilty,--we will,--visit him,--together. Good-bye now. I am going\nto see that friend of his, Mr. Low.\" So saying Lord Chiltern went,\nleaving the two women together.\n\n\"Why should he be so savage with me?\" said Lady Laura.\n\n\"He does not mean to be savage.\"\n\n\"Does he speak to you like that? What right has he to tell me of\nshame? Has my life been so bad, and his so good? Do you think it\nshameful that I should love this man?\" She sat looking into her\nfriend's face, but her friend for a while hesitated to answer. \"You\nshall tell me, Violet. We have known each other so well that I can\nbear to be told by you. Do not you love him?\"\n\n\"I love him!--certainly not.\"\n\n\"But you did.\"\n\n\"Not as you mean. Who can define love, and say what it is? There are\nso many kinds of love. We say that we love the Queen.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"And we are to love all our neighbours. But as men and women talk of\nlove, I never at any moment of my life loved any man but my husband.\nMr. Finn was a great favourite with me,--always.\"\n\n\"Indeed he was.\"\n\n\"As any other man might be,--or any woman. He is so still, and with\nall my heart I hope that this may be untrue.\"\n\n\"It is false as the Devil. It must be false. Can you think of the\nman,--his sweetness, the gentle nature of him, his open, free speech,\nand courage, and believe that he would go behind his enemy and knock\nhis brains out in the dark? I can conceive it of myself, that I\nshould do it, much easier than of him.\"\n\n\"Oswald says it is false.\"\n\n\"But he says it as partly believing that it is true. If it be true I\nwill hang myself. There will be nothing left among men or women fit\nto live for. You think it shameful that I should love him.\"\n\n\"I have not said so.\"\n\n\"But you do.\"\n\n\"I think there is cause for shame in your confessing it.\"\n\n\"I do confess it.\"\n\n\"You ask me, and press me, and because we have loved one another so\nwell I must answer you. If a woman,--a married woman,--be oppressed\nby such a feeling, she should lay it down at the bottom of her heart,\nout of sight, never mentioning it, even to herself.\"\n\n\"You talk of the heart as though we could control it.\"\n\n\"The heart will follow the thoughts, and they may be controlled. I\nam not passionate, perhaps, as you are, and I think I can control\nmy heart. But my fortune has been kind to me, and I have never been\ntempted. Laura, do not think I am preaching to you.\"\n\n\"Oh no;--but your husband; think of him, and think of mine! You have\nbabies.\"\n\n\"May God make me thankful. I have every good thing on earth that God\ncan give.\"\n\n\"And what have I? To see that man prosper in life, who they tell me\nis a murderer; that man who is now in a felon's gaol,--whom they\nwill hang for ought we know,--to see him go forward and justify\nmy thoughts of him! that yesterday was all I had. To-day I have\nnothing,--except the shame with which you and Oswald say that I have\ncovered myself.\"\n\n\"Laura, I have never said so.\"\n\n\"I saw it in your eye when he accused me. And I know that it is\nshameful. I do know that I am covered with shame. But I can bear my\nown disgrace better than his danger.\" After a long pause,--a silence\nof probably some fifteen minutes,--she spoke again. \"If Robert should\ndie,--what would happen then?\"\n\n\"It would be--a release, I suppose,\" said Lady Chiltern in a voice so\nlow, that it was almost a whisper.\n\n\"A release indeed;--and I would become that man's wife the next day,\nat the foot of the gallows;--if he would have me. But he would not\nhave me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nMR. KENNEDY'S WILL.\n\n\nMr. Kennedy had fired a pistol at Phineas Finn in Macpherson's Hotel\nwith the manifest intention of blowing out the brains of his presumed\nenemy, and no public notice had been taken of the occurrence. Phineas\nhimself had been only too willing to pass the thing by as a trifling\naccident, if he might be allowed to do so, and the Macphersons had\nbeen by far too true to their great friend to think of giving him in\ncharge to the police. The affair had been talked about, and had come\nto the knowledge of reporters and editors. Most of the newspapers had\ncontained paragraphs giving various accounts of the matter; and one\nor two had followed the example of The People's Banner in demanding\nthat the police should investigate the matter. But the matter had not\nbeen investigated. The police were supposed to know nothing about\nit,--as how should they, no one having seen or heard the shot but\nthey who were determined to be silent? Mr. Quintus Slide had been\nindignant all in vain, so far as Mr. Kennedy and his offence had\nbeen concerned. As soon as the pistol had been fired and Phineas\nhad escaped from the room, the unfortunate man had sunk back in\nhis chair, conscious of what he had done, knowing that he had\nmade himself subject to the law, and expecting every minute that\nconstables would enter the room to seize him. He had seen his enemy's\nhat lying on the floor, and, when nobody would come to fetch it, had\nthrown it down the stairs. After that he had sat waiting for the\npolice, with the pistol, still loaded in every barrel but one, lying\nby his side,--hardly repenting the attempt, but trembling for the\nresult,--till Macpherson, the landlord, who had been brought home\nfrom chapel, knocked at his door. There was very little said between\nthem; and no positive allusion was made to the shot that had been\nfired; but Macpherson succeeded in getting the pistol into his\npossession,--as to which the unfortunate man put no impediment in\nhis way, and he managed to have it understood that Mr. Kennedy's\ncousin should be summoned on the following morning. \"Is anybody else\ncoming?\" Robert Kennedy asked, when the landlord was about to leave\nthe room. \"Naebody as I ken o', yet, laird,\" said Macpherson, \"but\nlikes they will.\" Nobody, however, did come, and the \"laird\" had\nspent the evening by himself in very wretched solitude.\n\nOn the following day the cousin had come, and to him the whole story\nwas told. After that, no difficulty was found in taking the miserable\nman back to Loughlinter, and there he had been for the last two\nmonths in the custody of his more wretched mother and of his cousin.\nNo legal steps had been taken to deprive him of the management either\nof himself or of his property,--so that he was in truth his own\nmaster. And he exercised his mastery in acts of petty tyranny about\nhis domain, becoming more and more close-fisted in regard to money,\nand desirous, as it appeared, of starving all living things about the\nplace,--cattle, sheep, and horses, so that the value of their food\nmight be saved. But every member of the establishment knew that the\nlaird was \"nae just himself,\" and consequently his orders were not\nobeyed. And the laird knew the same of himself, and, though he would\ngive the orders not only resolutely, but with imperious threats of\npenalties to follow disobedience, still he did not seem to expect\ncompliance. While he was in this state, letters addressed to him came\nfor a while into his own hands, and thus more than one reached him\nfrom Lord Brentford's lawyer, demanding that restitution should be\nmade of the interest arising from Lady Laura's fortune. Then he would\nfly out into bitter wrath, calling his wife foul names, and swearing\nthat she should never have a farthing of his money to spend upon her\nparamour. Of course it was his money, and his only. All the world\nknew that. Had she not left his roof, breaking her marriage vows,\nthrowing aside every duty, and bringing him down to his present state\nof abject misery? Her own fortune! If she wanted the interest of her\nwretched money, let her come to Loughlinter and receive it there. In\nspite of all her wickedness, her cruelty, her misconduct, which had\nbrought him,--as he now said,--to the verge of the grave, he would\nstill give her shelter and room for repentance. He recognised his\nvows, though she did not. She should still be his wife, though she\nhad utterly disgraced both herself and him. She should still be his\nwife, though she had so lived as to make it impossible that there\nshould be any happiness in their household.\n\nIt was thus he spoke when first one and then another letter came\nfrom the Earl's lawyer, pointing out to him the injustice to which\nLady Laura was subjected by the loss of her fortune. No doubt these\nletters would not have been written in the line assumed had not Mr.\nKennedy proved himself to be unfit to have the custody of his wife\nby attempting to shoot the man whom he accused of being his wife's\nlover. An act had been done, said the lawyer, which made it quite\nout of the question that Lady Laura should return to her husband.\nTo this, when speaking of the matter to those around him,--which he\ndid with an energy which seemed to be foreign to his character,--Mr.\nKennedy made no direct allusion; but he swore most positively that\nnot a shilling should be given up. The fear of policemen coming down\nto Loughlinter to take account of that angry shot had passed away;\nand, though he knew, with an uncertain knowledge, that he was not in\nall respects obeyed as he used to be,--that his orders were disobeyed\nby stewards and servants, in spite of his threats of dismissal,--he\nstill felt that he was sufficiently his own master to defy the Earl's\nattorney and to maintain his claim upon his wife's person. Let her\nreturn to him first of all!\n\nBut after a while the cousin interfered still further; and Robert\nKennedy, who so short a time since had been a member of the\nGovernment, graced by permission to sit in the Cabinet, was not\nallowed to open his own post-bag. He had written a letter to one\nperson, and then again to another, which had induced those who\nreceived them to return answers to the cousin. To Lord Brentford's\nlawyer he had used a few very strong words. Mr. Forster had replied\nto the cousin, stating how grieved Lord Brentford would be, how much\ngrieved would be Lady Laura, to find themselves driven to take steps\nin reference to what they conceived to be the unfortunate condition\nof Mr. Robert Kennedy; but that such steps must be taken unless some\narrangement could be made which should be at any rate reasonable.\nThen Mr. Kennedy's post-bag was taken from him; the letters which\nhe wrote were not sent;--and he took to his bed. It was during this\ncondition of affairs that the cousin took upon himself to intimate\nto Mr. Forster that the managers of Mr. Kennedy's estate were by\nno means anxious of embarrassing their charge by so trumpery an\nadditional matter as the income derived from Lady Laura's forty\nthousand pounds.\n\nBut things were in a terrible confusion at Loughlinter. Rents were\npaid as heretofore on receipts given by Robert Kennedy's agent; but\nthe agent could only pay the money to Robert Kennedy's credit at his\nbank. Robert Kennedy's cheques would, no doubt, have drawn the money\nout again;--but it was almost impossible to induce Robert Kennedy\nto sign a cheque. Even in bed he inquired daily about his money,\nand knew accurately the sum lying at his banker's; but he could be\npersuaded to disgorge nothing. He postponed from day to day the\nsigning of certain cheques that were brought to him, and alleged very\nfreely that an attempt was being made to rob him. During all his life\nhe had been very generous in subscribing to public charities; but\nnow he stopped all his subscriptions. The cousin had to provide even\nfor the payment of wages, and things went very badly at Loughlinter.\nThen there arose the question whether legal steps should be taken for\nplacing the management of the estate in other hands, on the ground\nof the owner's insanity. But the wretched old mother begged that\nthis might not be done;--and Dr. Macnuthrie, from Callender, was of\nopinion that no steps should be taken at present. Mr. Kennedy was\nvery ill,--very ill indeed; would take no nourishment, and seemed to\nbe sinking under the pressure of his misfortunes. Any steps such as\nthose suggested would probably send their friend out of the world at\nonce.\n\nIn fact Robert Kennedy was dying;--and in the first week of May, when\nthe beauty of the spring was beginning to show itself on the braes of\nLoughlinter, he did die. The old woman, his mother, was seated by his\nbedside, and into her ears he murmured his last wailing complaint.\n\"If she had the fear of God before her eyes, she would come back\nto me.\" \"Let us pray that He may soften her heart,\" said the old\nlady. \"Eh, mother;--nothing can soften the heart Satan has hardened,\ntill it be hard as the nether millstone.\" And in that faith he died\nbelieving, as he had ever believed, that the spirit of evil was\nstronger than the spirit of good.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"He may soften her heart.\"]\n\n\nFor some time past there had been perturbation in the mind of that\ncousin, and of all other Kennedys of that ilk, as to the nature of\nthe will of the head of the family. It was feared lest he should have\nbeen generous to the wife who was believed by them all to have been\nso wicked and treacherous to her husband;--and so it was found to be\nwhen the will was read. During the last few months no one near him\nhad dared to speak to him of his will, for it had been known that\nhis condition of mind rendered him unfit to alter it; nor had he\never alluded to it himself. As a matter of course there had been a\nsettlement, and it was supposed that Lady Laura's own money would\nrevert to her; but when it was found that in addition to this the\nLoughlinter estate became hers for life, in the event of Mr. Kennedy\ndying without a child, there was great consternation among the\nKennedys generally. There were but two or three of them concerned,\nand for those there was money enough; but it seemed to them now that\nthe bad wife, who had utterly refused to acclimatise herself to the\nsoil to which she had been transplanted, was to be rewarded for her\nwicked stubbornness. Lady Laura would become mistress of her own\nfortune and of all Loughlinter, and would be once more a free woman,\nwith all the power that wealth and fashion can give. Alas, alas! it\nwas too late now for the taking of any steps to sever her from her\nrich inheritance! \"And the false harlot will come and play havoc\nhere, in my son's mansion,\" said the old woman with extremest\nbitterness.\n\nThe tidings were conveyed to Lady Laura through her lawyer, but did\nnot reach her in full till some eight or ten days after the news of\nher husband's death. The telegram announcing that event had come to\nher at her father's house in Portman Square, on the day after that\non which Phineas had been arrested, and the Earl had of course known\nthat his great longing for the recovery of his wife's fortune had\nbeen now realised. To him there was no sorrow in the news. He had\nonly known Robert Kennedy as one who had been thoroughly disagreeable\nto himself, and who had persecuted his daughter throughout\ntheir married life. There had come no happiness,--not even\nprosperity,--through the marriage. His daughter had been forced to\nleave the man's house,--and had been forced also to leave her money\nbehind her. Then she had been driven abroad, fearing persecution, and\nhad only dared to return when the man's madness became so notorious\nas to annul his power of annoying her. Now by his death, a portion\nof the injury which he had inflicted on the great family of Standish\nwould be remedied. The money would come back,--together with the\nstipulated jointure,--and there could no longer be any question of\nreturn. The news delighted the old Lord,--and he was almost angry\nwith his daughter because she also would not confess her delight.\n\n\"Oh, Papa, he was my husband.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, no doubt. I was always against it, you will remember.\"\n\n\"Pray do not talk in that way now, Papa. I know that I was not to him\nwhat I should have been.\"\n\n\"You used to say it was all his fault.\"\n\n\"We will not talk of it now, Papa. He is gone, and I remember his\npast goodness to me.\"\n\nShe clothed herself in the deepest of mourning, and made herself a\nthing of sorrow by the sacrificial uncouthness of her garments. And\nshe tried to think of him;--to think of him, and not to think of\nPhineas Finn. She remembered with real sorrow the words she had\nspoken to her sister-in-law, in which she had declared, while still\nthe wife of another man, that she would willingly marry Phineas at\nthe foot even of the gallows if she were free. She was free now; but\nshe did not repeat her assertion. It was impossible not to think of\nPhineas in his present strait, but she abstained from speaking of him\nas far as she could, and for the present never alluded to her former\npurpose of visiting him in his prison.\n\nFrom day to day, for the first few days of her widowhood, she heard\nwhat was going on. The evidence against him became stronger and\nstronger, whereas the other man, Yosef Mealyus, had been already\nliberated. There were still many who felt sure that Mealyus had been\nthe murderer, among whom were all those who had been ranked among\nthe staunch friends of our hero. The Chilterns so believed, and Lady\nLaura; the Duchess so believed, and Madame Goesler. Mr. Low felt sure\nof it, and Mr. Monk and Lord Cantrip; and nobody was more sure than\nMrs. Bunce. There were many who professed that they doubted; men such\nas Barrington Erle, Laurence Fitzgibbon, the two Dukes,--though the\nyounger Duke never expressed such doubt at home,--and Mr. Gresham\nhimself. Indeed, the feeling of Parliament in general was one of\ngreat doubt. Mr. Daubeny never expressed an opinion one way or the\nother, feeling that the fate of two second-class Liberals could\nnot be matter of concern to him;--but Sir Orlando Drought, and Mr.\nRoby, and Mr. Boffin, were as eager as though they had not been\nConservatives, and were full of doubt. Surely, if Phineas Finn were\nnot the murderer, he had been more ill-used by Fate than had been any\nman since Fate first began to be unjust. But there was also a very\nstrong party by whom no doubt whatever was entertained as to his\nguilt,--at the head of which, as in duty bound, was the poor widow,\nMrs. Bonteen. She had no doubt as to the hand by which her husband\nhad fallen, and clamoured loudly for the vengeance of the law. All\nthe world, she said, knew how bitter against her husband had been\nthis wretch, whose villainy had been exposed by her dear, gracious\nlord; and now the evidence against him was, to her thinking,\ncomplete. She was supported strongly by Lady Eustace, who, much as\nshe wished not to be the wife of the Bohemian Jew, thought even that\npreferable to being known as the widow of a murderer who had been\nhung. Mr. Ratler, with one or two others in the House, was certain\nof Finn's guilt. The People's Banner, though it prefaced each\none of its daily paragraphs on the subject with a statement as to\nthe manifest duty of an influential newspaper to abstain from the\nexpression of any opinion on such a subject till the question had\nbeen decided by a jury, nevertheless from day to day recapitulated\nthe evidence against the Member for Tankerville, and showed how\nstrong were the motives which had existed for such a deed. But, among\nthose who were sure of Finn's guilt, there was no one more sure than\nLord Fawn, who had seen the coat and the height of the man,--and the\nstep. He declared among his intimate friends that of course he could\nnot swear to the person. He could not venture, when upon his oath,\nto give an opinion. But the man who had passed him at so quick a\npace had been half a foot higher than Mealyus;--of that there could\nbe no doubt. Nor could there be any doubt as to the grey coat. Of\ncourse there might be other men with grey coats besides Mr. Phineas\nFinn,--and other men half a foot taller than Yosef Mealyus. And there\nmight be other men with that peculiarly energetic step. And the man\nwho hurried by him might not have been the man who murdered Mr.\nBonteen. Of all that Lord Fawn could say nothing. But what he did\nsay,--of that he was sure. And all those who knew him were well aware\nthat in his own mind he was convinced of the guilt of Phineas Finn.\nAnd there was another man equally convinced. Mr. Maule, Senior,\nremembered well the manner in which Madame Goesler spoke of Phineas\nFinn in reference to the murder, and was quite sure that Phineas was\nthe murderer.\n\nFor a couple of days Lord Chiltern was constantly with the poor\nprisoner, but after that he was obliged to return to Harrington\nHall. This he did a day after the news arrived of the death of his\nbrother-in-law. Both he and Lady Chiltern had promised to return\nhome, having left Adelaide Palliser alone in the house, and already\nthey had overstayed their time. \"Of course I will remain with you,\"\nLady Chiltern had said to her sister-in-law; but the widow had\npreferred to be left alone. For these first few days,--when she must\nmake pretence of sorrow because her husband had died; and had such\nreal cause for sorrow in the miserable condition of the man she\nloved,--she preferred to be alone. Who could sympathise with her now,\nor with whom could she speak of her grief? Her father was talking to\nher always of her money;--but from him she could endure it. She was\nused to him, and could remember when he spoke to her of her forty\nthousand pounds, and of her twelve hundred a year of jointure, that\nit had not always been with him like that. As yet nothing had been\nheard of the will, and the Earl did not in the least anticipate any\nfurther accession of wealth from the estate of the man whom they had\nall hated. But his daughter would now be a rich woman; and was yet\nyoung, and there might still be splendour. \"I suppose you won't care\nto buy land,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, Papa, do not talk of buying anything yet.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Laura, you must put your money into something. You can\nget very nearly 5 per cent. from Indian Stock.\"\n\n\"Not yet, Papa,\" she said. But he proceeded to explain to her how\nvery important an affair money is, and that persons who have got\nmoney cannot be excused for not considering what they had better do\nwith it. No doubt she could get 4 per cent. on her money by buying up\ncertain existing mortgages on the Saulsby property,--which would no\ndoubt be very convenient if, hereafter, the money should go to her\nbrother's child. \"Not yet, Papa,\" she said again, having, however,\nalready made up her mind that her money should have a different\ndestination.\n\nShe could not interest her father at all in the fate of Phineas Finn.\nWhen the story of the murder had first been told to him, he had been\namazed,--and, no doubt, somewhat gratified, as we all are, at tragic\noccurrences which do not concern ourselves. But he could not be made\nto tremble for the fate of Phineas Finn. And yet he had known the man\nduring the last few years most intimately, and had had much in common\nwith him. He had trusted Phineas in respect to his son, and had\ntrusted him also in respect to his daughter. Phineas had been his\nguest at Dresden; and, on his return to London, had been the first\nfriend he had seen, with the exception of his lawyer. And yet he\ncould hardly be induced to express the slightest interest as to\nthe fate of this friend who was to be tried for murder. \"Oh;--he's\ncommitted, is he? I think I remember that Protheroe once told me\nthat, in thirty-nine cases out of forty, men committed for serious\noffences have been guilty of them.\" The Protheroe here spoken of as\nan authority in criminal matters was at present Lord Weazeling, the\nLord Chancellor.\n\n\"But Mr. Finn has not been guilty, Papa.\"\n\n\"There is always the one chance out of forty. But, as I was saying,\nif you like to take up the Saulsby mortgages, Mr. Forster can't be\ntold too soon.\"\n\n\"Papa, I shall do nothing of the kind,\" said Lady Laura. And then she\nrose and walked out of the room.\n\nAt the end of ten days from the death of Mr. Kennedy, there came the\ntidings of the will. Lady Laura had written to Mrs. Kennedy a letter\nwhich had taken her much time in composition, expressing her deep\nsorrow, and condoling with the old woman. And the old woman had\nanswered. \"Madam, I am too old now to express either grief or anger.\nMy dear son's death, caused by domestic wrong, has robbed me of any\nremaining comfort which the undeserved sorrows of his latter years\nhad not already dispelled. Your obedient servant, Sarah Kennedy.\"\nFrom which it may be inferred that she had also taken considerable\ntrouble in the composition of her letter. Other communications\nbetween Loughlinter and Portman Square there were none, but there\ncame through the lawyers a statement of Mr. Kennedy's will, as far as\nthe interests of Lady Laura were concerned. This reached Mr. Forster\nfirst, and he brought it personally to Portman Square. He asked for\nLady Laura, and saw her alone. \"He has bequeathed to you the use of\nLoughlinter for your life, Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"To me!\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Laura. The will is dated in the first year of his\nmarriage, and has not been altered since.\"\n\n\"What can I do with Loughlinter? I will give it back to them.\" Then\nMr. Forster explained that the legacy referred not only to the house\nand immediate grounds,--but to the whole estate known as the domain\nof Loughlinter. There could be no reason why she should give it up,\nbut very many why she should not do so. Circumstanced as Mr. Kennedy\nhad been, with no one nearer to him than a first cousin, with a\nproperty purchased with money saved by his father,--a property to\nwhich no cousin could by inheritance have any claim,--he could not\nhave done better with it than to leave it to his widow in fault of\nany issue of his own. Then the lawyer explained that were she to give\nit up, the world would of course say that she had done so from a\nfeeling of her own unworthiness. \"Why should I feel myself to be\nunworthy?\" she asked. The lawyer smiled, and told her that of course\nshe would retain Loughlinter.\n\nThen, at her request, he was taken to the Earl's room and there\nrepeated the good news. Lady Laura preferred not to hear her father's\nfirst exultations. But while this was being done she also exulted.\nMight it not still be possible that there should be before her a\nhappy evening to her days; and that she might stand once more beside\nthe falls of Linter, contented, hopeful, nay, almost glorious, with\nher hand in his to whom she had once refused her own on that very\nspot?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nNONE BUT THE BRAVE DESERVE THE FAIR.\n\n\nThough Mr. Robert Kennedy was lying dead at Loughlinter, and though\nPhineas Finn, a member of Parliament, was in prison, accused of\nmurdering another member of Parliament, still the world went on with\nits old ways, down in the neighbourhood of Harrington Hall and Spoon\nHall as at other places. The hunting with the Brake hounds was now\nover for the season,--had indeed been brought to an auspicious end\nthree weeks since,--and such gentlemen as Thomas Spooner had time on\ntheir hands to look about their other concerns. When a man hunts five\ndays a week, regardless of distances, and devotes a due proportion\nof his energies to the necessary circumstances of hunting, the\npreservation of foxes, the maintenance of good humour with the\nfarmers, the proper compensation for poultry really killed by\nfour-legged favourites, the growth and arrangement of coverts, the\nlying-in of vixens, and the subsequent guardianship of nurseries, the\npersecution of enemies, and the warm protection of friends,--when\nhe follows the sport, accomplishing all the concomitant duties of a\ntrue sportsman, he has not much time left for anything. Such a one\nas Mr. Spooner of Spoon Hall finds that his off day is occupied from\nbreakfast to dinner with grooms, keepers, old women with turkeys'\nheads, and gentlemen in velveteens with information about wires and\nunknown earths. His letters fall naturally to the Sunday afternoon,\nand are hardly written before sleep overpowers him. Many a large\nfortune has been made with less of true devotion to the work than is\ngiven to hunting by so genuine a sportsman as Mr. Spooner.\n\nOur friend had some inkling of this himself, and felt that many of\nthe less important affairs of his life were neglected because he\nwas so true to the one great object of his existence. He had wisely\nendeavoured to prevent wrack and ruin among the affairs of Spoon\nHall,--and had thoroughly succeeded by joining his cousin Ned with\nhimself in the administration of his estate,--but there were things\nwhich Ned with all his zeal and all his cleverness could not do for\nhim. He was conscious that had he been as remiss in the matter of\nhunting, as that hard-riding but otherwise idle young scamp, Gerard\nMaule, he might have succeeded much better than he had hitherto done\nwith Adelaide Palliser. \"Hanging about and philandering, that's what\nthey want,\" he said to his cousin Ned.\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" said Ned. \"I was fond of a girl once myself, and\nI hung about a good deal. But we hadn't sixpence between us.\"\n\n\"That was Polly Maxwell. I remember. You behaved very badly then.\"\n\n\"Very badly, Tom; about as bad as a man could behave,--and she was\nas bad. I loved her with all my heart, and I told her so. And she\ntold me the same. There never was anything worse. We had just nothing\nbetween us, and nobody to give us anything.\"\n\n\"It doesn't pay; does it, Ned, that kind of thing?\"\n\n\"It doesn't pay at all. I wouldn't give her up,--nor she me. She was\nabout as pretty a girl as I remember to have seen.\"\n\n\"I suppose you were a decent-looking fellow in those days yourself.\nThey say so, but I never quite believed it.\"\n\n\"There wasn't much in that,\" said Ned. \"Girls don't want a man to be\ngood-looking, but that he should speak up and not be afraid of them.\nThere were lots of fellows came after her. You remember Blinks, of\nthe Carabineers. He was full of money, and he asked her three times.\nShe is an old maid to this day, and is living as companion to some\ncrusty crochetty countess.\"\n\n\"I think you did behave badly, Ned. Why didn't you set her free?\"\n\n\"Of course, I behaved badly. And why didn't she set me free, if you\ncome to that? I might have found a female Blinks of my own,--only\nfor her. I wonder whether it will come against us when we die, and\nwhether we shall be brought up together to receive punishment.\"\n\n\"Not if you repent, I suppose,\" said Tom Spooner, very seriously.\n\n\"I sometimes ask myself whether she has repented. I made her swear\nthat she'd never give me up. She might have broken her word a score\nof times, and I wish she had.\"\n\n\"I think she was a fool, Ned.\"\n\n\"Of course she was a fool. She knows that now, I dare say. And\nperhaps she has repented. Do you mean to try it again with that girl\nat Harrington Hall?\"\n\nMr. Thomas Spooner did mean to try it again with the girl at\nHarrington Hall. He had never quite trusted the note which he had\ngot from his friend Chiltern, and had made up his mind that, to say\nthe least of it, there had been very little friendship shown in the\nletter. Had Chiltern meant to have stood to him \"like a brick,\" as he\nought to have stood by his right hand man in the Brake country, at\nany rate a fair chance might have been given him. \"Where the devil\nwould he be in such a country as this without me,\"--Tom had said\nto his cousin,--\"not knowing a soul, and with all the shooting men\nagainst him? I might have had the hounds myself,--and might have 'em\nnow if I cared to take them. It's not standing by a fellow as he\nought to do. He writes to me, by George, just as he might do to some\nfellow who never had a fox about his place.\"\n\n\"I suppose he didn't put the two things together,\" said Ned Spooner.\n\n\"I hate a fellow that can't put two things together. If I stand to\nyou you've a right to stand to me. That's what you mean by putting\ntwo things together. I mean to have another shy at her. She has\nquarrelled with that fellow Maule altogether. I've learned that from\nthe gardener's girl at Harrington.\"\n\nYes,--he would make another attempt. All history, all romance, all\npoetry and all prose, taught him that perseverance in love was\ngenerally crowned with success,--that true love rarely was crowned\nwith success except by perseverance. Such a simple little tale of\nboy's passion as that told him by his cousin had no attraction for\nhim. A wife would hardly be worth having, and worth keeping, so won.\nAnd all proverbs were on his side. \"None but the brave deserve the\nfair,\" said his cousin. \"I shall stick to it,\" said Tom Spooner.\n\"Labor omnia vincit,\" said his cousin. But what should be his next\nstep? Gerard Maule had been sent away with a flea in his ear,--so, at\nleast, Mr. Spooner asserted, and expressed an undoubting opinion that\nthis imperative dismissal had come from the fact that Gerard Maule,\nwhen \"put through his facings\" about income was not able to \"show the\nmoney.\" \"She's not one of your Polly Maxwells, Ned.\" Ned said that he\nsupposed she was not one of that sort. \"Heaven knows I couldn't show\nthe money,\" said Ned, \"but that didn't make her any wiser.\" Then Tom\ngave it as his opinion that Miss Palliser was one of those young\nwomen who won't go anywhere without having everything about them.\n\"She could have her own carriage with me, and her own horses, and her\nown maid, and everything.\"\n\n\"Her own way into the bargain,\" said Ned. Whereupon Tom Spooner\nwinked, and suggested that that might be as things turned out after\nthe marriage. He was quite willing to run his chance for that.\n\nBut how was he to get at her to prosecute his suit? As to writing to\nher direct,--he didn't much believe in that. \"It looks as though one\nwere afraid of her, you know;--which I ain't the least. I stood up to\nher before, and I wasn't a bit more nervous than I am at this moment.\nWere you nervous in that affair with Miss Maxwell?\"\n\n\"Ah;--it's a long time ago. There wasn't much nervousness there.\"\n\n\"A sort of milkmaid affair?\"\n\n\"Just that.\"\n\n\"That is different, you know. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll just\ndrive slap over to Harrington and chance it. I'll take the two bays\nin the phaeton. Who's afraid?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of,\" said Ned.\n\n\"Old Chiltern is such a d---- cantankerous fellow, and perhaps Lady\nC. may say that I oughtn't to have taken advantage of her absence.\nBut, what's the odds? If she takes me there'll be an end of it. If\nshe don't, they can't eat me.\"\n\n\"The only thing is whether they'll let you in.\"\n\n\"I'll try at any rate,\" said Tom, \"and you shall go over with me.\nYou won't mind trotting about the grounds while I'm carrying on the\nwar inside? I'll take the two bays, and Dick Farren behind, and I\ndon't think there's a prettier got-up trap in the county. We'll go\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAnd on the morrow they did start, having heard on that very morning\nof the arrest of Phineas Finn. \"By George, don't it feel odd,\" said\nTom just as they started,--\"a fellow that we used to know down here,\nhaving him out hunting and all that, and now he's--a murderer! Isn't\nit a coincidence?\"\n\n\"It startles one,\" said Ned.\n\n\"That's what I mean. It's such a strange thing that it should be the\nman we know ourselves. These things always are happening to me. Do\nyou remember when poor Fred Fellows got his bad fall and died the\nnext year? You weren't here then.\"\n\n\"I've heard you speak of it.\"\n\n\"I was in the very same field, and should have been the man to pick\nhim up, only the hounds had just turned to the left. It's very odd\nthat these coincidences always are happening to some men and never do\nhappen to others. It makes one feel that he's marked out, you know.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll be marked out by victory to-day.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. That's more important just now than Mr. Bonteen's\nmurder. Do you know, I wish you'd drive. These horses are pulling,\nand I don't want to be all in a flurry when I get to Harrington.\"\nNow it was a fact very well known to all concerned with Spoon Hall,\nthat there was nothing as to which the Squire was so jealous as\nthe driving of his own horses. He would never trust the reins to a\nfriend, and even Ned had hardly ever been allowed the honour of the\nwhip when sitting with his cousin. \"I'm apt to get red in the face\nwhen I'm overheated,\" said Tom as he made himself comfortable and\neasy in the left hand seat.\n\nThere were not many more words spoken during the journey. The lover\nwas probably justified in feeling some trepidation. He had been quite\ncorrect in suggesting that the matter between him and Miss Palliser\nbore no resemblance at all to that old affair between his cousin Ned\nand Polly Maxwell. There had been as little trepidation as money in\nthat case,--simply love and kisses, parting, despair, and a broken\nheart. Here things were more august. There was plenty of money, and,\nlet affairs go as they might, there would be no broken heart. But\nthat perseverance in love of which Mr. Spooner intended to make\nhimself so bright an example does require some courage. The Adelaide\nPallisers of the world have a way of making themselves uncommonly\nunpleasant to a man when they refuse him for the third or fourth\ntime. They allow themselves sometimes to express a contempt which is\nalmost akin to disgust, and to speak to a lover as though he were no\nbetter than a footman. And then the lover is bound to bear it all,\nand when he has borne it, finds it so very difficult to get out of\nthe room. Mr. Spooner had some idea of all this as his cousin drove\nhim up to the door, at what he then thought a very fast pace. \"D----\nit all,\" he said, \"you needn't have brought them up so confoundedly\nhot.\" But it was not of the horses that he was really thinking, but\nof the colour of his own nose. There was something working within\nhim which had flurried him, in spite of the tranquillity of his idle\nseat.\n\nNot the less did he spring out of the phaeton with a quite youthful\njump. It was well that every one about Harrington Hall should know\nhow alert he was on his legs; a little weather-beaten about the face\nhe might be; but he could get in and out of his saddle as quickly\nas Gerard Maule even yet; and for a short distance would run Gerard\nMaule for a ten-pound note. He dashed briskly up to the door, and\nrang the bell as though he feared neither Adelaide nor Lord Chiltern\nany more than he did his own servants at Spoon Hall. \"Was Miss\nPalliser at home?\" The maid-servant who opened the door told him that\nMiss Palliser was at home, with a celerity which he certainly had\nnot expected. The male members of the establishment were probably\ndisporting themselves in the absence of their master and mistress,\nand Adelaide Palliser was thus left to the insufficient guardianship\nof young women who were altogether without discretion. \"Yes, sir;\nMiss Palliser is at home.\" So said the indiscreet female, and Mr.\nSpooner was for the moment confounded by his own success. He had\nhardly told himself what reception he had expected, or whether, in\nthe event of the servant informing him at the front door that the\nyoung lady was not at home he would make any further immediate effort\nto prolong the siege so as to force an entry; but now, when he had\ncarried the very fortress by surprise, his heart almost misgave him.\nHe certainly had not thought, when he descended from his chariot like\na young Bacchus in quest of his Ariadne, that he should so soon be\nenabled to repeat the tale of his love. But there he was, confronted\nwith Ariadne before he had had a moment to shake his godlike locks or\narrange the divinity of his thoughts. \"Mr. Spooner,\" said the maid,\nopening the door.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" exclaimed Ariadne, feeling the vainness of her wish to fly\nfrom the god. \"You know, Mary, that Lady Chiltern is up in London.\"\n\n\"But he didn't ask for Lady Chiltern, Miss.\" Then there was a pause,\nduring which the maid-servant managed to shut the door and to escape.\n\n\"Lord Chiltern is up in London,\" said Miss Palliser, rising from her\nchair, \"and Lady Chiltern is with him. They will be at home, I think,\nto-morrow, but I am not quite sure.\" She looked at him rather as\nDiana might have looked at poor Orion than as any Ariadne at any\nBacchus; and for a moment Mr. Spooner felt that the pale chillness of\nthe moon was entering in upon his very heart and freezing the blood\nin his veins.\n\n\"Miss Palliser--\" he began.\n\nBut Adelaide was for the moment an unmitigated Diana. \"Mr. Spooner,\"\nshe said, \"I cannot for an instant suppose that you wish to say\nanything to me.\"\n\n\"But I do,\" said he, laying his hand upon his heart.\n\n\"Then I must declare that--that--that you ought not to. And I hope\nyou won't. Lady Chiltern is not in the house, and I think that--that\nyou ought to go away. I do, indeed.\"\n\nBut Mr. Spooner, though the interview had been commenced with\nunexpected and almost painful suddenness, was too much a man to be\ndriven off by the first angry word. He remembered that this Diana was\nbut mortal; and he remembered, too, that though he had entered in\nupon her privacy he had done so in a manner recognised by the world\nas lawful. There was no reason why he should allow himself to be\ncongealed,--or even banished out of the grotto of the nymph,--without\nspeaking a word on his own behalf. Were he to fly now, he must\nfly for ever; whereas, if he fought now,--fought well, even though\nnot successfully at the moment,--he might fight again. While Miss\nPalliser was scowling at him he resolved upon fighting. \"Miss\nPalliser,\" he said, \"I did not come to see Lady Chiltern; I came to\nsee you. And now that I have been happy enough to find you I hope you\nwill listen to me for a minute. I shan't do you any harm.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of any harm, but I cannot think that you have\nanything to say that can do anybody any good.\" She sat down, however,\nand so far yielded. \"Of course I cannot make you go away, Mr.\nSpooner; but I should have thought, when I asked you--\"\n\nMr. Spooner also seated himself, and uttered a sigh. Making love to\na sweet, soft, blushing, willing, though silent girl is a pleasant\nemployment; but the task of declaring love to a stony-hearted,\nobdurate, ill-conditioned Diana is very disagreeable for any\ngentleman. And it is the more so when the gentleman really loves,--or\nthinks that he loves,--his Diana. Mr. Spooner did believe himself\nto be verily in love. Having sighed, he began: \"Miss Palliser, this\nopportunity of declaring to you the state of my heart is too valuable\nto allow me to give it up without--without using it.\"\n\n\"It can't be of any use.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Palliser,--if you knew my feelings!\"\n\n\"But I know my own.\"\n\n\"They may change, Miss Palliser.\"\n\n\"No, they can't.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Miss Palliser.\"\n\n\"But I do say it. I say it over and over again. I don't know what any\ngentleman can gain by persecuting a lady. You oughtn't to have been\nshown up here at all.\"\n\nMr. Spooner knew well that women have been won even at the tenth time\nof asking, and this with him was only the third. \"I think if you knew\nmy heart--\" he commenced.\n\n\"I don't want to know your heart.\"\n\n\"You might listen to a man, at any rate.\"\n\n\"I don't want to listen. It can't do any good. I only want you to\nleave me alone, and go away.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you take me for,\" said Mr. Spooner, beginning to\nwax angry.\n\n\"I haven't taken you for anything at all. This is very disagreeable\nand very foolish. A lady has a right to know her own mind, and she\nhas a right not to be persecuted.\" She would have referred to Lord\nChiltern's letter had not all the hopes of her heart been so terribly\ncrushed since that letter had been written. In it he had openly\ndeclared that she was already engaged to be married to Mr. Maule,\nthinking that he would thus put an end to Mr. Spooner's little\nadventure. But since the writing of Lord Chiltern's letter that\nunfortunate reference had been made to Boulogne, and every particle\nof her happiness had been destroyed. She was a miserable, blighted\nyoung woman, who had quarrelled irretrievably with her lover, feeling\ngreatly angry with herself because she had made the quarrel, and yet\nconscious that her own self-respect had demanded the quarrel. She was\nfull of regret, declaring to herself from morning to night that, in\nspite of all his manifest wickedness in having talked of Boulogne,\nshe never could care at all for any other man. And now there was this\naggravation to her misery,--this horrid suitor, who disgraced her by\nmaking those around her suppose it to be possible that she should\never accept him; who had probably heard of her quarrel, and had been\nmean enough to suppose that therefore there might be a chance for\nhimself! She did despise him, and wanted him to understand that she\ndespised him.\n\n\"I believe I am in a condition to offer my hand and fortune to any\nyoung lady without impropriety,\" said Mr. Spooner.\n\n\"I don't know anything about your condition.\"\n\n\"But I will tell you everything.\"\n\n\"I don't want to know anything about it.\"\n\n\"I have an estate of--\"\n\n\"I don't want to know about your estate. I won't hear about your\nestate. It can be nothing to me.\"\n\n\"It is generally considered to be a matter of some importance.\"\n\n\"It is of no importance to me, at all, Mr. Spooner; and I won't hear\nanything about it. If all the parish belonged to you, it would not\nmake any difference.\"\n\n\"All the parish does belong to me, and nearly all the next,\" replied\nMr. Spooner, with great dignity.\n\n\"Then you'd better find some lady who would like to have two\nparishes. They haven't any weight with me at all.\" At that moment\nshe told herself how much she would prefer even Bou--logne, to Mr.\nSpooner's two parishes.\n\n\"What is it that you find so wrong about me?\" asked the unhappy\nsuitor.\n\nAdelaide looked at him, and longed to tell him that his nose was red.\nAnd, though she would not quite do that, she could not bring herself\nto spare him. What right had he to come to her,--a nasty, red-nosed\nold man, who knew nothing about anything but foxes and horses,--to\nher, who had never given him the encouragement of a single smile? She\ncould not allude to his nose, but in regard to his other defects she\nwould not spare him. \"Our tastes are not the same, Mr. Spooner.\"\n\n\"You are very fond of hunting.\"\n\n\"And our ages are not the same.\"\n\n\"I always thought that there should be a difference of age,\" said Mr.\nSpooner, becoming very red.\n\n\"And,--and,--and,--it's altogether quite preposterous. I don't\nbelieve that you can really think it yourself.\"\n\n\"But I do.\"\n\n\"Then you must unthink it. And, indeed, Mr. Spooner, since you drive\nme to say so,--I consider it to be very unmanly of you, after what\nLord Chiltern told you in his letter.\"\n\n\"But I believe that is all over.\"\n\nThen her anger flashed up very high. \"And if you do believe it, what\na mean man you must be to come to me when you must know how miserable\nI am, and to think that I should be driven to accept you after losing\nhim! You never could have been anything to me. If you wanted to get\nmarried at all, you should have done it before I was born.\" This\nwas hard upon the man, as at that time he could not have been much\nmore than twenty. \"But you don't know anything of the difference in\npeople if you think that any girl would look at you, after having\nbeen--loved by Mr. Maule. Now, as you do not seem inclined to go\naway, I shall leave you.\" So saying, she walked off with stately\nstep, out of the room, leaving the door open behind her to facilitate\nher escape.\n\nShe had certainly been very rude to him, and had treated him very\nbadly. Of that he was sure. He had conferred upon her what is\ncommonly called the highest compliment which a gentleman can pay\nto a lady, and she had insulted him;--had doubly insulted him. She\nhad referred to his age, greatly exaggerating his misfortune in\nthat respect; and she had compared him to that poor beggar Maule in\nlanguage most offensive. When she left him, he put his hand beneath\nhis waistcoat, and turned with an air almost majestic towards the\nwindow. But in an instant he remembered that there was nobody there\nto see how he bore his punishment, and he sank down into human\nnature. \"Damnation!\" he said, as he put his hands into his trousers\npockets.\n\nSlowly he made his way down into the hall, and slowly he opened for\nhimself the front door, and escaped from the house on to the gravel\ndrive. There he found his cousin Ned still seated in the phaeton, and\nslowly driving round the circle in front of the hall door. The squire\nsucceeded in gaining such command over his own gait and countenance\nthat his cousin divined nothing of the truth as he clambered up into\nhis seat. But he soon showed his temper. \"What the devil have you got\nthe reins in this way for?\"\n\n\"The reins are all right,\" said Ned.\n\n\"No they ain't;--they're all wrong.\" And then he drove down the\navenue to Spoon Hall as quickly as he could make the horses trot.\n\n\"Did you see her?\" said Ned, as soon as they were beyond the gates.\n\n\"See your grandmother.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that I'm not to ask?\"\n\n\"There's nothing I hate so much as a fellow that's always asking\nquestions,\" said Tom Spooner. \"There are some men so d----d\nthick-headed that they never know when they ought to hold their\ntongue.\"\n\nFor a minute or two Ned bore the reproof in silence, and then he\nspoke. \"If you are unhappy, Tom, I can bear a good deal; but don't\noverdo it,--unless you want me to leave you.\"\n\n\"She's the d----t vixen that ever had a tongue in her head,\" said\nTom Spooner, lifting his whip and striking the poor off-horse in his\nagony. Then Ned forgave him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nTHE DUCHESS TAKES COUNSEL.\n\n\nPhineas Finn, when he had been thrice remanded before the Bow Street\nmagistrate, and four times examined, was at last committed to be\ntried for the murder of Mr. Bonteen. This took place on Wednesday,\nMay 19th, a fortnight after the murder. But during those fourteen\ndays little was learned, or even surmised, by the police, in addition\nto the circumstances which had transpired at once. Indeed the delay,\nslight as it was, had arisen from a desire to find evidence that\nmight affect Mr. Emilius, rather than with a view to strengthen that\nwhich did affect Phineas Finn. But no circumstance could be found\ntending in any way to add to the suspicion to which the converted Jew\nwas made subject by his own character, and by the supposition that\nhe would have been glad to get rid of Mr. Bonteen. He did not even\nattempt to run away,--for which attempt certain pseudo-facilities\nwere put in his way by police ingenuity. But Mr. Emilius stood his\nground and courted inquiry. Mr. Bonteen had been to him, he said, a\nvery bitter, unjust, and cruel enemy. Mr. Bonteen had endeavoured to\nrob him of his dearest wife;--had charged him with bigamy;--had got\nup false evidence in the hope of ruining him. He had undoubtedly\nhated Mr. Bonteen, and might probably have said so. But, as it\nhappened, through God's mercy, he was enabled to prove that he could\nnot possibly have been at the scene of the murder when the murder was\ncommitted. During that hour of the night he had been in his own bed;\nand, had he been out, could not have re-entered the house without\ncalling up the inmates. But, independently of his alibi, Mealyus was\nable to rely on the absolute absence of any evidence against him.\nNo grey coat could be traced to his hands, even for an hour. His\nheight was very much less than that attributed by Lord Fawn to the\nman whom he had seen hurrying to the spot. No weapon was found in his\npossession by which the deed could have been done. Inquiry was made\nas to the purchase of life-preservers, and the reverend gentleman was\ntaken to half-a-dozen shops at which such instruments had lately been\nsold. But there had been a run upon life-preservers, in consequence\nof recommendations as to their use given by certain newspapers;--and\nit was found as impossible to trace one particular purchase as it\nwould be that of a loaf of bread. At none of the half-dozen shops to\nwhich he was taken was Mr. Emilius remembered; and then all further\ninquiry in that direction was abandoned, and Mr. Emilius was set at\nliberty. \"I forgive my persecutors from the bottom of my heart,\" he\nsaid,--\"but God will requite it to them.\"\n\nIn the meantime Phineas was taken to Newgate, and was there confined,\nalmost with the glory and attendance of a State prisoner. This was no\ncommon murder, and no common murderer. Nor were they who interested\nthemselves in the matter the ordinary rag, tag, and bobtail of the\npeople,--the mere wives and children, or perhaps fathers and mothers,\nor brothers and sisters of the slayer or the slain. Dukes and Earls,\nDuchesses and Countesses, Members of the Cabinet, great statesmen,\nJudges, Bishops, and Queen's Counsellors, beautiful women, and\nwomen of highest fashion, seemed for a while to think of but little\nelse than the fate of Mr. Bonteen and the fate of Phineas Finn.\nPeople became intimately acquainted with each other through similar\nsympathies in this matter, who had never before spoken to or seen\neach other. On the day after the full committal of the man, Mr. Low\nreceived a most courteous letter from the Duchess of Omnium, begging\nhim to call in Carlton Terrace if his engagements would permit him\nto do so. The Duchess had heard that Mr. Low was devoting all his\nenergies to the protection of Phineas Finn; and, as a certain friend\nof hers,--a lady,--was doing the same, she was anxious to bring them\ntogether. Indeed, she herself was equally prepared to devote her\nenergies for the present to the same object. She had declared to\nall her friends,--especially to her husband and to the Duke of St.\nBungay,--her absolute conviction of the innocence of the accused man,\nand had called upon them to defend him. \"My dear,\" said the elder\nDuke, \"I do not think that in my time any innocent man has ever lost\nhis life upon the scaffold.\"\n\n\"Is that a reason why our friend should be the first instance?\" said\nthe Duchess.\n\n\"He must be tried according to the laws of his country,\" said the\nyounger Duke.\n\n\"Plantagenet, you always speak as if everything were perfect, whereas\nyou know very well that everything is imperfect. If that man is--is\nhung, I--\"\n\n\"Glencora,\" said her husband, \"do not connect yourself with the fate\nof a stranger from any misdirected enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"I do connect myself. If that man be hung--I shall go into mourning\nfor him. You had better look to it.\"\n\nMr. Low obeyed the summons, and called on the Duchess. But, in truth,\nthe invitation had been planned by Madame Goesler, who was present\nwhen the lawyer, about five o'clock in the afternoon, was shown into\nthe presence of the Duchess. Tea was immediately ordered, and Mr. Low\nwas almost embraced. He was introduced to Madame Goesler, of whom he\ndid not before remember that he had heard the name, and was at once\ngiven to understand that the fate of Phineas was now in question. \"We\nknow so well,\" said the Duchess, \"how true you are to him.\"\n\n\"He is an old friend of mine,\" said the lawyer, \"and I cannot believe\nhim to have been guilty of a murder.\"\n\n\"Guilty!--he is no more guilty than I am. We are as sure of that as\nwe are of the sun. We know that he is innocent;--do we not, Madame\nGoesler? And we, too, are very dear friends of his;--that is, I am.\"\n\n\"And so am I,\" said Madame Goesler, in a voice very low and sweet,\nbut yet so energetic as to make Mr. Low almost rivet his attention\nupon her.\n\n\"You must understand, Mr. Low, that Mr. Finn is a man horribly hated\nby certain enemies. That wretched Mr. Bonteen hated his very name.\nBut there are other people who think very differently of him. He must\nbe saved.\"\n\n\"Indeed I hope he may,\" said Mr. Low.\n\n\"We wanted to see you for ever so many reasons. Of course you\nunderstand that--that any sum of money can be spent that the case may\nwant.\"\n\n\"Nothing will be spared on that account certainly,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"But money will do a great many things. We would send all round\nthe world if we could get evidence against that other man,--Lady\nEustace's husband, you know.\"\n\n\"Can any good be done by sending all round the world?\"\n\n\"He went back to his own home not long ago,--in Poland, I think,\"\nsaid Madame Goesler. \"Perhaps he got the instrument there, and\nbrought it with him.\" Mr. Low shook his head. \"Of course we are very\nignorant;--but it would be a pity that everything should not be\ntried.\"\n\n\"He might have got in and out of the window, you know,\" said the\nDuchess. Still Mr. Low shook his head. \"I believe things can always\nbe found out, if only you take trouble enough. And trouble means\nmoney;--does it not? We wouldn't mind how many thousand pounds it\ncost; would we, Marie?\"\n\n\"I fear that the spending of thousands can do no good,\" said Mr. Low.\n\n\"But something must be done. You don't mean to say that Mr. Finn is\nto be hung because Lord Fawn says that he saw a man running along the\nstreet in a grey coat.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"There is nothing else against him;--nobody else saw him.\"\n\n\"If there be nothing else against him he will be acquitted.\"\n\n\"You think then,\" said Madame Goesler, \"that there will be no use in\ntracing what the man Mealyus did when he was out of England. He might\nhave bought a grey coat then, and have hidden it till this night,\nand then have thrown it away.\" Mr. Low listened to her with close\nattention, but again shook his head. \"If it could be shown that the\nman had a grey coat at that time it would certainly weaken the effect\nof Mr. Finn's grey coat.\"\n\n\"And if he bought a bludgeon there, it would weaken the effect of\nMr. Finn's bludgeon. And if he bought rope to make a ladder it would\nshow that he had got out. It was a dark night, you know, and nobody\nwould have seen it. We have been talking it all over, Mr. Low, and we\nreally think you ought to send somebody.\"\n\n\"I will mention what you say to the gentlemen who are employed on Mr.\nFinn's defence.\"\n\n\"But will not you be employed?\" Then Mr. Low explained that the\ngentlemen to whom he referred were the attorneys who would get up the\ncase on their friend's behalf, and that as he himself practised in\nthe Courts of Equity only, he could not defend Mr. Finn on his trial.\n\n\"He must have the very best men,\" said the Duchess.\n\n\"He must have good men, certainly.\"\n\n\"And a great many. Couldn't we get Sir Gregory Grogram?\" Mr. Low\nshook his head. \"I know very well that if you get men who are\nreally,--really swells, for that is what it is, Mr. Low,--and pay\nthem well enough, and so make it really an important thing, they\ncan browbeat any judge and hoodwink any jury. I daresay it is very\ndreadful to say so, Mr. Low; but, nevertheless, I believe it, and as\nthis man is certainly innocent it ought to be done. I daresay it's\nvery shocking, but I do think that twenty thousand pounds spent among\nthe lawyers would get him off.\"\n\n\"I hope we can get him off without expending twenty thousand pounds,\nDuchess.\"\n\n\"But you can have the money and welcome;--cannot he, Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"He could have double that, if double were necessary.\"\n\n\"I would fill the court with lawyers for him,\" continued the Duchess.\n\"I would cross-examine the witnesses off their legs. I would rake\nup every wicked thing that horrid Jew has done since he was born.\nI would make witnesses speak. I would give a carriage and pair of\nhorses to every one of the jurors' wives, if that would do any good.\nYou may shake your head, Mr. Low; but I would. And I'd carry Lord\nFawn off to the Antipodes, too;--and I shouldn't care if you left him\nthere. I know that this man is innocent, and I'd do anything to save\nhim. A woman, I know, can't do much;--but she has this privilege,\nthat she can speak out what men only think. I'd give them two\ncarriages and two pairs of horses a-piece if I could do it that way.\"\n\nMr. Low did his best to explain to the Duchess that the desired\nobject could hardly be effected after the fashion she proposed, and\nhe endeavoured to persuade her that justice was sure to be done in\nan English court of law. \"Then why are people so very anxious to get\nthis lawyer or that to bamboozle the witnesses?\" said the Duchess.\nMr. Low declared it to be his opinion that the poorest man in England\nwas not more likely to be hung for a murder he had not committed than\nthe richest. \"Then why would you, if you were accused, have ever so\nmany lawyers to defend you?\" Mr. Low went on to explain. \"The more\nmoney you spend,\" said the Duchess, \"the more fuss you make. And the\nlonger a trial is about and the greater the interest, the more chance\na man has to escape. If a man is tried for three days you always\nthink he'll get off, but if it lasts ten minutes he is sure to be\nconvicted and hung. I'd have Mr. Finn's trial made so long that they\nnever could convict him. I'd tire out all the judges and juries in\nLondon. If you get lawyers enough they may speak for ever.\" Mr.\nLow endeavoured to explain that this might prejudice the prisoner.\n\"And I'd examine every member of the House of Commons, and all the\nCabinet, and all their wives. I'd ask them all what Mr. Bonteen\nhad been saying. I'd do it in such a way as a trial was never done\nbefore;--and I'd take care that they should know what was coming.\"\n\n\"And if he were convicted afterwards?\"\n\n\"I'd buy up the Home Secretary. It's very horrid to say so, of\ncourse, Mr. Low; and I dare say there is nothing wrong ever done in\nChancery. But I know what Cabinet Ministers are. If they could get a\nmajority by granting a pardon they'd do it quick enough.\"\n\n\"You are speaking of a liberal Government, of course, Duchess.\"\n\n\"There isn't twopence to choose between them in that respect. Just\nat this moment I believe Mr. Finn is the most popular member of the\nHouse of Commons; and I'd bring all that to bear. You can't but know\nthat if everything of that kind is done it will have an effect. I\nbelieve you could make him so popular that the people would pull down\nthe prison rather than have him hung;--so that a jury would not dare\nto say he was guilty.\"\n\n\"Would that be justice, ladies?\" asked the just man.\n\n\"It would be success, Mr. Low,--which is a great deal the better\nthing of the two.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Finn were found guilty, I could not in my heart believe that\nthat would be justice,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\nMr. Low did his best to make them understand that the plan of pulling\ndown Newgate by the instrumentality of Phineas Finn's popularity,\nor of buying up the Home Secretary by threats of Parliamentary\ndefection, would hardly answer their purpose. He would, he assured\nthem, suggest to the attorneys employed the idea of searching for\nevidence against the man Mealyus in his own country, and would\ncertainly take care that nothing was omitted from want of means. \"You\nhad better let us put a cheque in your hands,\" said the Duchess. But\nto this he would not assent. He did admit that it would be well to\nleave no stone unturned, and that the turning of such stones must\ncost money;--but the money, he said, would be forthcoming. \"He's not\na rich man himself,\" said the Duchess. Mr. Low assured her that if\nmoney were really wanting he would ask for it. \"And now,\" said the\nDuchess, \"there is one other thing that we want. Can we see him?\"\n\n\"You, yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I myself, and Madame Goesler. You look as if it would be very\nwicked.\" Mr. Low thought that it would be wicked;--that the Duke\nwould not like it; and that such a visit would occasion ill-natured\nremarks. \"People do visit him, I suppose. He's not locked up like a\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"I visit him,\" said Mr. Low, \"and one or two other friends have done\nso. Lord Chiltern has been with him, and Mr. Erle.\"\n\n\"Has no lady seen him?\" asked the Duchess.\n\n\"Not to my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Then it's time some lady should do so. I suppose we could be\nadmitted. If we were his sisters they'd let us in.\"\n\n\"You must excuse me, Duchess, but--\"\n\n\"Of course I will excuse you. But what?\"\n\n\"You are not his sisters.\"\n\n\"If I were engaged to him, to be his wife?--\" said Madame Goesler,\nstanding up. \"I am not so. There is nothing of that kind. You must\nnot misunderstand me. But if I were?\"\n\n\"On that plea I presume you could be admitted.\"\n\n\"Why not as a friend? Lord Chiltern is admitted as his friend.\"\n\n\"Because of the prudery of a prison,\" said the Duchess. \"All things\nare wrong to the lookers after wickedness, my dear. If it would\ncomfort him to see us, why should he not have that comfort?\"\n\n\"Would you have gone to him in his own lodgings?\" asked Mr. Low.\n\n\"I would,--if he'd been ill,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Mr. Low, speaking with a gravity which for a moment had\nits effect even upon the Duchess of Omnium, \"I think, at any rate,\nthat if you visit Mr. Finn in prison, you should do so through the\ninstrumentality of his Grace, your husband.\"\n\n\"Of course you suspect me of all manner of evil.\"\n\n\"I suspect nothing;--but I am sure that it should be so.\"\n\n\"It shall be so,\" said the Duchess. \"Thank you, sir. We are much\nobliged to you for your wise counsel.\"\n\n\"I am obliged to you,\" said Madame Goesler, \"because I know that you\nhave his safety at heart.\"\n\n\"And so am I,\" said the Duchess, relenting, and giving him her\nhand. \"We are really ever so much obliged to you. You don't quite\nunderstand about the Duke; and how should you? I never do anything\nwithout telling him, but he hasn't time to attend to things.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not offended you.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no. You can't offend me unless you mean it. Good-bye,--and\nremember to have a great many lawyers, and all with new wigs; and let\nthem all get in a great rage that anybody should suppose it possible\nthat Mr. Finn is a murderer. I'm sure I am. Good-bye, Mr. Low.\"\n\n\"You'll never be able to get to him,\" said the Duchess, as soon as\nthey were alone.\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"And what good could you do? Of course I'd go with you if we could\nget in;--but what would be the use?\"\n\n\"To let him know that people do not think him guilty.\"\n\n\"Mr. Low will tell him that. I suppose, too, we can write to him.\nWould you mind writing?\"\n\n\"I would rather go.\"\n\n\"You might as well tell the truth when you are about it. You are\nbreaking your heart for him.\"\n\n\"If he were to be condemned, and--executed, I should break my heart.\nI could never appear bright before the world again.\"\n\n\"That is just what I told Plantagenet. I said I would go into\nmourning.\"\n\n\"And I should really mourn. And yet were he free to-morrow he would\nbe no more to me than any other friend.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you would not marry him?\"\n\n\"No;--I would not. Nor would he ask me. I will tell you what will be\nhis lot in life,--if he escapes from the present danger.\"\n\n\"Of course he will escape. They don't really hang innocent men.\"\n\n\"Then he will become the husband of Lady Laura Kennedy.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! If I believed that, I should think it cruel to help him\nescape from Newgate.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nPHINEAS IN PRISON.\n\n\nPhineas Finn himself, during the fortnight in which he was carried\nbackwards and forwards between his prison and the Bow Street\nPolice-office, was able to maintain some outward show of manly\ndignity,--as though he felt that the terrible accusation and great\nmaterial inconvenience to which he was subjected were only, and\ncould only be, temporary in their nature, and that the truth would\nsoon prevail. During this period he had friends constantly with\nhim,--either Mr. Low, or Lord Chiltern, or Barrington Erle, or his\nlandlord, Mr. Bunce, who, in these days, was very true to him. And he\nwas very frequently visited by the attorney, Mr. Wickerby, who had\nbeen expressly recommended to him for this occasion. If anybody could\nbe counted upon to see him through his difficulty it was Wickerby.\nBut the company of Mr. Wickerby was not pleasant to him, because, as\nfar as he could judge, Mr. Wickerby did not believe in his innocence.\nMr. Wickerby was willing to do his best for him; was, so to speak,\nmoving heaven and earth on his behalf; was fully conscious that this\ncase was a great affair, and in no respect similar to those which\nwere constantly placed in his hands; but there never fell from him a\nsympathetic expression of assurance of his client's absolute freedom\nfrom all taint of guilt in the matter. From day to day, and ten times\na day, Phineas would express his indignant surprise that any one\nshould think it possible that he had done this deed, but to all these\nexpressions Mr. Wickerby would make no answer whatever. At last\nPhineas asked him the direct question. \"I never suspect anybody of\nanything,\" said Mr. Wickerby. \"Do you believe in my innocence?\"\ndemanded Phineas. \"Everybody is entitled to be believed innocent till\nhe has been proved to be guilty,\" said Mr. Wickerby. Then Phineas\nappealed to his friend Mr. Low, asking whether he might not be\nallowed to employ some lawyer whose feelings would be more in unison\nwith his own. But Mr. Low adjured him to make no change. Mr. Wickerby\nunderstood the work and was a most zealous man. His client was\nentitled to his services, but to nothing more than his services. And\nso Mr. Wickerby carried on the work, fully believing that Phineas\nFinn had in truth murdered Mr. Bonteen.\n\nBut the prisoner was not without sympathy and confidence. Mr. Low,\nLord Chiltern, and Lady Chiltern, who, on one occasion, came to\nvisit him with her husband, entertained no doubts prejudicial to his\nhonour. They told him perhaps almost more than was quite true of the\nfeelings of the world in his favour. He heard of the friendship and\nfaith of the Duchess of Omnium, of Madame Goesler, and of Lady Laura\nKennedy,--hearing also that Lady Laura was now a widow. And then at\nlength his two sisters came over to him from Ireland, and wept and\nsobbed, and fell into hysterics in his presence. They were sure that\nhe was innocent, as was every one, they said, throughout the length\nand breadth of Ireland. And Mrs. Bunce, who came to see Phineas in\nhis prison, swore that she would tear the judge from his bench if he\ndid not at once pronounce a verdict in favour of her darling without\nwaiting for any nonsense of a jury. And Bunce, her husband, having\nconvinced himself that his lodger had not committed the murder, was\nzealous in another way, taking delight in the case, and proving that\nno jury could find a verdict of guilty.\n\nDuring that week Phineas, buoyed up by the sympathy of his friends,\nand in some measure supported by the excitement of the occasion,\ncarried himself well, and bore bravely the terrible misfortune to\nwhich he had been subjected by untoward circumstances. But when the\nmagistrate fully committed him, giving the first public decision\non the matter from the bench, declaring to the world at large that\non the evidence as given, prima facie, he, Phineas Finn, must be\nregarded as the murderer of Mr. Bonteen, our hero's courage almost\ngave way. If such was now the judicial opinion of the magistrate,\nhow could he expect a different verdict from a jury in two months'\ntime, when he would be tried before a final court? As far as he could\nunderstand, nothing more could be learned on the matter. All the\nfacts were known that could be known,--as far as he, or rather his\nfriends on his behalf, were able to search for facts. It seemed to\nhim that there was no tittle whatever of evidence against him. He had\nwalked straight home from his club with the life-preserver in his\npocket, and had never turned to the right or to the left. Till he\nfound himself committed, he would not believe that any serious and\nprolonged impediment could be thrown in the way of his liberty. He\nwould not believe that a man altogether innocent could be in danger\nof the gallows on a false accusation. It had seemed to him that the\npolice had kept their hold on him with a rabid ferocity, straining\nevery point with the view of showing that it was possible that he\nshould have been the murderer. Every policeman who had been near him,\ncarrying him backward and forward from his prison, or giving evidence\nas to the circumstances of the locality and of his walk home on that\nfatal night, had seemed to him to be an enemy. But he had looked for\nimpartiality from the magistrate,--and now the magistrate had failed\nhim. He had seen in court the faces of men well known to him,--men\nknown in the world,--with whom he had been on pleasant terms in\nParliament, who had sat upon the bench while he was standing as a\nculprit between two constables; and they who had been his familiar\nfriends had appeared at once to have been removed from him by some\nunmeasurable distance. But all that he had, as it were, discounted,\nbelieving that a few hours,--at the very longest a few days,--would\nremove the distance; but now he was sent back to his prison, there to\nawait his trial for the murder.\n\nAnd it seemed to him that his committal startled no one but himself.\nCould it be that even his dearest friends thought it possible that he\nhad been guilty? When that day came, and he was taken back to Newgate\non his last journey there from Bow Street, Lord Chiltern had returned\nfor a while to Harrington Hall, having promised that he would be back\nin London as soon as his business would permit; but Mr. Low came to\nhim almost immediately to his prison room. \"This is a pleasant state\nof things,\" said Phineas, with a forced laugh. But as he laughed he\nalso sobbed, with a low, irrepressible, convulsive movement in his\nthroat.\n\n\"Phineas, the time has come in which you must show yourself to be a\nman.\"\n\n\"A man! Oh, yes, I can be a man. A murderer you mean. I shall have to\nbe--hung, I suppose.\"\n\n\"May God, in His mercy, forbid.\"\n\n\"No;--not in His mercy; in His justice. There can be no need for\nmercy here,--not even from Heaven. When they take my life may He\nforgive my sins through the merits of my Saviour. But for this there\ncan be no mercy. Why do you not speak? Do you mean to say that I am\nguilty?\"\n\n\"I am sure that you are innocent.\"\n\n\"And yet, look here. What more can be done to prove it than has been\ndone? That blundering fool will swear my life away.\" Then he threw\nhimself on his bed, and gave way to his sobs.\n\nThat evening he was alone,--as, indeed, most of his evenings had been\nspent, and the minutes were minutes of agony to him. The external\ncircumstances of his position were as comfortable as circumstances\nwould allow. He had a room to himself looking out through heavy iron\nbars into one of the courts of the prison. The chamber was carpeted,\nand was furnished with bed and chairs and two tables. Books were\nallowed him as he pleased, and pen and ink. It was May, and no fire\nwas necessary. At certain periods of the day he could walk alone\nin the court below,--the restriction on such liberty being that at\nother certain hours the place was wanted for other prisoners. As far\nas he knew no friend who called was denied to him, though he was\nby no means certain that his privilege in that respect would not be\ncurtailed now that he had been committed for trial. His food had been\nplentiful and well cooked, and even luxuries, such as fish and wine\nand fruit, had been supplied to him. That the fruit had come from\nthe hot-houses of the Duchess of Omnium, and the wine from Mr. Low's\ncellar, and the fish and lamb and spring vegetables, the cream and\ncoffee and fresh butter from the unrestricted orders of another\nfriend, that Lord Chiltern had sent him champagne and cigars,\nand that Lady Chiltern had given directions about the books and\nstationery, he did not know. But as far as he could be consoled by\nsuch comforts, there had been the consolation. If lamb and salad\ncould make him happy he might have enjoyed his sojourn in Newgate.\nNow, this evening, he was past all enjoyment. It was impossible that\nhe should read. How could a man fix his attention on any book, with a\ncharge of murder against himself affirmed by the deliberate decision\nof a judge? And he knew himself to be as innocent as the magistrate\nhimself. Every now and then he would rise from his bed, and almost\nrush across the room as though he would dash his head against the\nwall. Murder! They really believed that he had deliberately murdered\nthe man;--he, Phineas Finn, who had served his country with repute,\nwho had sat in Parliament, who had prided himself on living with the\nbest of his fellow-creatures, who had been the friend of Mr. Monk and\nof Lord Cantrip, the trusted intimate of such women as Lady Laura\nand Lady Chiltern, who had never put his hand to a mean action, or\nallowed his tongue to speak a mean word! He laughed in his wrath,\nand then almost howled in his agony. He thought of the young loving\nwife who had lived with him little more than for one fleeting year,\nand wondered whether she was looking down upon him from Heaven, and\nhow her spirit would bear this accusation against the man upon whose\nbosom she had slept, and in whose arms she had gone to her long rest.\n\"They can't believe it,\" he said aloud. \"It is impossible. Why should\nI have murdered him?\" And then he remembered an example in Latin\nfrom some rule of grammar, and repeated it to himself over and over\nagain.--\"No one at an instant,--of a sudden,--becomes most base.\" It\nseemed to him that there was such a want of knowledge of human nature\nin the supposition that it was possible that he should have committed\nsuch a crime. And yet--there he was, committed to take his trial for\nthe murder of Mr. Bonteen.\n\nThe days were long, and it was daylight till nearly nine. Indeed the\ntwilight lingered, even through those iron bars, till after nine. He\nhad once asked for candles, but had been told that they could not be\nallowed him without an attendant in the room,--and he had dispensed\nwith them. He had been treated doubtless with great respect, but\nnevertheless he had been treated as a prisoner. They hardly denied\nhim anything that he asked, but when he asked for that which they did\nnot choose to grant they would annex conditions which induced him to\nwithdraw his request. He understood their ways now, and did not rebel\nagainst them.\n\nOn a sudden he heard the key in the door, and the man who attended\nhim entered the room with a candle in his hand. A lady had come to\ncall, and the governor had given permission for her entrance. He\nwould return for the light,--and for the lady, in half an hour. He\nhad said all this before Phineas could see who the lady was. And when\nhe did see the form of her who followed the gaoler, and who stood\nwith hesitating steps behind him in the doorway, he knew her by her\nsombre solemn raiment, and not by her countenance. She was dressed\nfrom head to foot in the deepest weeds of widowhood, and a heavy veil\nfell from her bonnet over her face. \"Lady Laura, is it you?\" said\nPhineas, putting out his hand. Of course it was Lady Laura. While the\nDuchess of Omnium and Madame Goesler were talking about such a visit,\nallowing themselves to be deterred by the wisdom of Mr. Low, she had\nmade her way through bolts and bars, and was now with him in his\nprison.\n\n\n[Illustration: Of course it was Lady Laura.]\n\n\n\"Oh, Phineas!\" She slowly raised her veil, and stood gazing at him.\n\"Of all my troubles this,--to see you here,--is the heaviest.\"\n\n\"And of all my consolations to see you here is the greatest.\" He\nshould not have so spoken. Could he have thought of things as they\nwere, and have restrained himself, he should not have uttered words\nto her which were pleasant but not true. There came a gleam of\nsunshine across her face as she listened to him, and then she threw\nherself into his arms, and wept upon his shoulder. \"I did not expect\nthat you would have found me,\" he said.\n\nShe took the chair opposite to that on which he usually sat, and\nthen began her tale. Her cousin, Barrington Erle, had brought her\nthere, and was below, waiting for her in the Governor's house. He\nhad procured an order for her admission that evening, direct from Sir\nHarry Coldfoot, the Home Secretary,--which, however, as she admitted,\nhad been given under the idea that she and Erle were to see him\ntogether. \"But I would not let him come with me,\" she said. \"I could\nnot have spoken to you, had he been here;--could I?\"\n\n\"It would not have been the same, Lady Laura.\" He had thought much of\nhis mode of addressing her on occasions before this, at Dresden and\nat Portman Square, and had determined that he would always give her\nher title. Once or twice he had lacked the courage to be so hard to\nher. Now as she heard the name the gleam of sunshine passed from her\naltogether. \"We hardly expected that we should ever meet in such a\nplace as this?\" he said.\n\n\"I cannot understand it. They cannot really think you killed him.\" He\nsmiled, and shook his head. Then she spoke of her own condition. \"You\nhave heard what has happened? You know that I am--a widow?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I had heard.\" And then he smiled again. \"You will have\nunderstood why I could not come to you,--as I should have done but\nfor this little accident.\"\n\n\"He died on the day that they arrested you. Was it not strange that\nsuch a double blow should fall together? Oswald, no doubt, told you\nall.\"\n\n\"He told me of your husband's death.\"\n\n\"But not of his will? Perhaps he has not seen you since he heard it.\"\nLord Chiltern had heard of the will before his last visit to Phineas\nin Newgate, but had not chosen then to speak of his sister's wealth.\n\n\"I have heard nothing of Mr. Kennedy's will.\"\n\n\"It was made immediately after our marriage,--and he never changed\nit, though he had so much cause of anger against me.\"\n\n\"He has not injured you, then,--as regards money.\"\n\n\"Injured me! No, indeed. I am a rich woman,--very rich. All\nLoughlinter is my own,--for life. But of what use can it be to\nme?\" He in his present state could tell her of no uses for such a\nproperty. \"I suppose, Phineas, it cannot be that you are really in\ndanger?\"\n\n\"In the greatest danger, I fancy.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that they will say--you are guilty?\"\n\n\"The magistrates have said so already.\"\n\n\"But surely that is nothing. If I thought so, I should die. If I\nbelieved it, they should never take me out of the prison while you\nare here. Barrington says that it cannot be. Oswald and Violet are\nsure that such a thing can never happen. It was that Jew who did it.\"\n\n\"I cannot say who did it. I did not.\"\n\n\"You! Oh, Phineas! The world must be mad when any can believe it!\"\n\n\"But they do believe it?\" This, he said, meaning to ask a question as\nto that outside world.\n\n\"We do not. Barrington says--\"\n\n\"What does Barrington say?\"\n\n\"That there are some who do;--just a few, who were Mr. Bonteen's\nspecial friends.\"\n\n\"The police believe it. That is what I cannot understand;--men who\nought to be keen-eyed and quick-witted. That magistrate believes it.\nI saw men in the Court who used to know me well, and I could see that\nthey believed it. Mr. Monk was here yesterday.\"\n\n\"Does he believe it?\"\n\n\"I asked him, and he told me--no. But I did not quite trust him as he\ntold me. There are two or three who believe me innocent.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Low, and Chiltern, and his wife;--and that man Bunce, and his wife.\nIf I escape from this,--if they do not hang me,--I will remember\nthem. And there are two other women who know me well enough not to\nthink me a murderer.\"\n\n\"Who are they, Phineas?\"\n\n\"Madame Goesler, and the Duchess of Omnium.\"\n\n\"Have they been here?\" she asked, with jealous eagerness.\n\n\"Oh, no. But I hear that it is so,--and I know it. One learns to feel\neven from hearsay what is in the minds of people.\"\n\n\"And what do I believe, Phineas? Can you read my thoughts?\"\n\n\"I know them of old, without reading them now.\" Then he put forth his\nhand and took hers. \"Had I murdered him in real truth, you would not\nhave believed it.\"\n\n\"Because I love you, Phineas.\"\n\nThen the key was again heard in the door, and Barrington Erle\nappeared with the gaolers. The time was up, he said, and he had come\nto redeem his promise. He spoke cordially to his old friend, and\ngrasped the prisoner's hand cordially,--but not the less did he\nbelieve that there was blood on it, and Phineas knew that such was\nhis belief. It appeared on his arrival that Lady Laura had not at\nall accomplished the chief object of her visit. She had brought\nwith her various cheques, all drawn by Barrington Erle on his\nbanker,--amounting altogether to many hundreds of pounds,--which\nit was intended that Phineas should use from time to time for the\nnecessities of his trial. Barrington Erle explained that the money\nwas in fact to be a loan from Lady Laura's father, and was simply\npassed through his banker's account. But Phineas knew that the loan\nmust come from Lady Laura, and he positively refused to touch it.\nHis friend, Mr. Low, was managing all that for him, and he would not\nembarrass the matter by a fresh account. He was very obstinate, and\nat last the cheques were taken away in Barrington Erle's pocket.\n\n\"Good-night, old fellow,\" said Erle, affectionately. \"I'll see you\nagain before long. May God send you through it all.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Barrington. It was kind of you to come to me.\" Then Lady\nLaura, watching to see whether her cousin would leave her alone for\na moment with the object of her idolatry, paused before she gave him\nher hand. \"Good-night, Lady Laura,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-night!\" Barrington Erle was now just outside the door.\n\n\"I shall not forget your coming here to me.\"\n\n\"How should we, either of us, forget it?\"\n\n\"Come, Laura,\" said Barrington Erle, \"we had better make an end of\nit.\"\n\n\"But if I should never see him again!\"\n\n\"Of course you will see him again.\"\n\n\"When! and where! Oh, God,--if they should murder him!\" Then she\nthrew herself into his arms, and covered him with kisses, though her\ncousin had returned into the room and stood over her as she embraced\nhim.\n\n\"Laura,\" said he, \"you are doing him an injury. How should he support\nhimself if you behave like this! Come away.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, if they should kill him!\" she exclaimed. But she allowed\nher cousin to take her in his arms, and Phineas Finn was left alone\nwithout having spoken another word to either of them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nTHE MEAGER FAMILY.\n\n\nOn the day after the committal a lady, who had got out of a cab at\nthe corner of Northumberland Street, in the Marylebone Road, walked\nup that very uninviting street, and knocked at a door just opposite\nto the deadest part of the dead wall of the Marylebone Workhouse.\nHere lived Mrs. and Miss Meager,--and also on occasions Mr. Meager,\nwho, however, was simply a trouble and annoyance in the world,\ngoing about to race-courses, and occasionally, perhaps, to worse\nplaces, and being of no slightest use to the two poor hard-worked\nwomen,--mother and daughter,--who endeavoured to get their living by\nletting lodgings. The task was difficult, for it is not everybody who\nlikes to look out upon the dead wall of a workhouse, and they who\ndo are disposed to think that their willingness that way should be\nconsidered in the rent. But Mr. Emilius, when the cruelty of his\nwife's friends deprived him of the short-lived luxury of his mansion\nin Lowndes Square, had found in Northumberland Street a congenial\nretreat, and had for a while trusted to Mrs. and Miss Meager for\nall his domestic comforts. Mr. Emilius was always a favourite with\nnew friends, and had not as yet had his Northumberland Street gloss\nrubbed altogether off him when Mr. Bonteen was murdered. As it\nhappened, on that night,--or rather early in the day, for Meager\nhad returned to the bosom of his family after a somewhat prolonged\nabsence in the provinces, and therefore the date had become specially\nremarkable in the Meager family from the double event,--Mr. Meager\nhad declared that unless his wife could supply him with a five-pound\nnote he must cut his throat instantly. His wife and daughter had\nregretted the necessity, but had declared the alternative to be out\nof the question. Whereupon Mr. Meager had endeavoured to force the\nlock of an old bureau with a carving-knife, and there had been some\nslight personal encounter,--after which he had had some gin and had\ngone to bed. Mrs. Meager remembered the day very well indeed, and\nMiss Meager, when the police came the next morning, had accounted\nfor her black eye by a tragical account of a fall she had had\nagainst the bed-post in the dark. Up to that period Mr. Emilius had\nbeen everything that was sweet and good,--an excellent, eloquent\nclergyman, who was being ill-treated by his wife's wealthy relations,\nwho was soft in his manners and civil in his words, and never gave\nmore trouble than was necessary. The period, too, would have been\none of comparative prosperity to the Meager ladies,--but for that\ninopportune return of the head of the family,--as two other lodgers\nhad been inclined to look out upon the dead wall, or else into the\ncheerful back-yard; which circumstance came to have some bearing\nupon our story, as Mrs. Meager had been driven by the press of her\nincreased household to let that good-natured Mr. Emilius know that\nif \"he didn't mind it\" the latch-key might be an accommodation on\noccasions. To give him his due, indeed, he had, when first taking the\nrooms, offered to give up the key when not intending to be out at\nnight.\n\nAfter the murder Mr. Emilius had been arrested, and had been kept in\ndurance for a week. Miss Meager had been sure that he was innocent;\nMrs. Meager had trusted the policemen, who evidently thought that\nthe clergyman was guilty. Of the policemen who were concerned on the\noccasion, it may be said in a general way that they believed that\nboth the gentlemen had committed the murder,--so anxious were they\nnot to be foiled in the attempts at discovery which their duty called\nupon them to make. Mr. Meager had left the house on the morning of\nthe arrest, having arranged that little matter of the five-pound\nnote by a compromise. When the policeman came for Mr. Emilius, Mr.\nMeager was gone. For a day or two the lodger's rooms were kept vacant\nfor the clergyman till Mrs. Meager became quite convinced that he\nhad committed the murder, and then all his things were packed up\nand placed in the passage. When he was liberated he returned to the\nhouse, and expressed unbounded anger at what had been done. He took\nhis two boxes away in a cab, and was seen no more by the ladies of\nNorthumberland Street.\n\nBut a further gleam of prosperity fell upon them in consequence of\nthe tragedy which had been so interesting to them. Hitherto the\ninquiries made at their house had had reference solely to the habits\nand doings of their lodger during the last few days; but now there\ncame to them a visitor who made a more extended investigation; and\nthis was one of their own sex. It was Madame Goesler who got out\nof the cab at the workhouse corner, and walked from thence to Mrs.\nMeager's house. This was her third appearance in Northumberland\nStreet, and at each coming she had spoken kind words, and had left\nbehind her liberal recompense for the trouble which she gave. She\nhad no scruples as to paying for the evidence which she desired to\nobtain,--no fear of any questions which might afterwards be asked\nin cross-examination. She dealt out sovereigns--womanfully, and had\nhad Mrs. and Miss Meager at her feet. Before the second visit was\ncompleted they were both certain that the Bohemian converted Jew had\nmurdered Mr. Bonteen, and were quite willing to assist in hanging\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, Ma'am,\" said Mrs. Meager, \"he did take the key with him. Amelia\nremembers we were a key short at the time he was away.\" The absence\nhere alluded to was that occasioned by the journey which Mr. Emilius\ntook to Prague, when he heard that evidence of his former marriage\nwas being sought against him in his own country.\n\n\"That he did,\" said Amelia, \"because we were put out ever so. And he\nhad no business, for he was not paying for the room.\"\n\n\"You have only one key.\"\n\n\"There is three, Ma'am. The front attic has one regular because he's\non a daily paper, and of course he doesn't get to bed till morning.\nMeager always takes another, and we can't get it from him ever so.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Emilius took the other away with him?\" asked Madame Goesler.\n\n\"That he did, Ma'am. When he came back he said it had been in a\ndrawer,--but it wasn't in the drawer. We always knows what's in the\ndrawers.\"\n\n\"The drawer wasn't left locked, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was, Ma'am, and he took that key--unbeknownst to us,\" said\nMrs. Meager. \"But there is other keys that open the drawers. We are\nobliged in our line to know about the lodgers, Ma'am.\"\n\nThis was certainly no time for Madame Goesler to express\ndisapprobation of the practices which were thus divulged. She smiled,\nand nodded her head, and was quite sympathetic with Mrs. Meager. She\nhad learned that Mr. Emilius had taken the latch-key with him to\nBohemia, and was convinced that a dozen other latch-keys might have\nbeen made after the pattern without any apparent detection by the\nLondon police. \"And now about the coat, Mrs. Meager.\"\n\n\"Well, Ma'am?\"\n\n\"Mr. Meager has not been here since?\"\n\n\"No, Ma'am. Mr. Meager, Ma'am, isn't what he ought to be. I never do\nown it up, only when I'm driven. He hasn't been home.\"\n\n\"I suppose he still has the coat.\"\n\n\"Well, Ma'am, no. We sent a young man after him, as you said, and the\nyoung man found him at the Newmarket Spring.\"\n\n\"Some water cure?\" asked Madame Goesler.\n\n\"No, Ma'am. It ain't a water cure, but the races. He hadn't got the\ncoat. He does always manage a tidy great coat when November is coming\non, because it covers everything, and is respectable, but he mostly\nparts with it in April. He gets short, and then he--just pawns it.\"\n\n\"But he had it the night of the murder?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ma'am, he had. Amelia and I remembered it especial. When we\nwent to bed, which we did soon after ten, it was left in this room,\nlying there on the sofa.\" They were now sitting in the little back\nparlour, in which Mrs. and Miss Meager were accustomed to live.\n\n\"And it was there in the morning?\"\n\n\"Father had it on when he went out,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"If we paid him he would get it out of the pawnshop, and bring it to\nus, would he not?\" asked the lady.\n\nTo this Mrs. Meager suggested that it was quite on the cards that Mr.\nMeager might have been able to do better with his coat by selling it,\nand if so, it certainly would have been sold, as no prudent idea of\nredeeming his garment for the next winter's wear would ever enter his\nmind. And Mrs. Meager seemed to think that such a sale would not have\ntaken place between her husband and any old friend. \"He wouldn't know\nwhere he sold it,\" said Mrs. Meager.\n\n\"Anyways he'd tell us so,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"But if we paid him to be more accurate?\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"They is so afraid of being took up themselves,\" said Mrs. Meager.\nThere was, however, ample evidence that Mr. Meager had possessed a\ngrey great coat, which during the night of the murder had been left\nin the little sitting-room, and which they had supposed to have lain\nthere all night. To this coat Mr. Emilius might have had easy access.\n\"But then it was a big man that was seen, and Emilius isn't no ways a\nbig man. Meager's coat would be too long for him, ever so much.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless we must try and get the coat,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\"I'll speak to a friend about it. I suppose we can find your husband\nwhen we want him?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Ma'am. We never can find him; but then we never do\nwant him,--not now. The police know him at the races, no doubt. You\nwon't go and get him into trouble, Ma'am, worse than he is? He's\nalways been in trouble, but I wouldn't like to be means of making it\nworse on him than it is.\"\n\nMadame Goesler, as she again paid the woman for her services, assured\nher that she would do no injury to Mr. Meager. All that she wanted of\nMr. Meager was his grey coat, and that not with any view that could\nbe detrimental either to his honour or to his safety, and she was\nwilling to pay any reasonable price,--or almost any unreasonable\nprice,--for the coat. But the coat must be made to be forthcoming if\nit were still in existence, and had not been as yet torn to pieces by\nthe shoddy makers.\n\n\"It ain't near come to that yet,\" said Amelia. \"I don't know that\nI ever see father more respectable,--that is, in the way of a great\ncoat.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCH FOR THE KEY AND THE COAT.\n\n\nWhen Madame Goesler revealed her plans and ideas to Mr. Wickerby,\nthe attorney, who had been employed to bring Phineas Finn through\nhis troubles, that gentleman evidently did not think much of the\nunprofessional assistance which the lady proposed to give him. \"I'm\nafraid it is far-fetched, Ma'am,--if you understand what I mean,\"\nsaid Mr. Wickerby. Madame Goesler declared that she understood very\nwell what Mr. Wickerby meant, but that she could hardly agree with\nhim. \"According to that the gentleman must have plotted the murder\nmore than a month before he committed it,\" said Mr. Wickerby.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Murder plots are generally the work of a few hours at the\nlongest, Madame Goesler. Anger, combined with an indifference to\nself-sacrifice, does not endure the wear of many days. And the object\nhere was insufficient. I don't think we can ask to have the trial put\noff in order to find out whether a false key may have been made in\nPrague.\"\n\n\"And you will not look for the coat?\"\n\n\"We can look for it, and probably get it, if the woman has not lied\nto you; but I don't think it will do us any good. The woman probably\nis lying. You have been paying her very liberally, so that she has\nbeen making an excellent livelihood out of the murder. No jury would\nbelieve her. And a grey coat is a very common thing. After all, it\nwould prove nothing. It would only let the jury know that Mr. Meager\nhad a grey coat as well as Mr. Finn. That Mr. Finn wore a grey coat\non that night is a fact which we can't upset. If you got hold of\nMeager's coat you wouldn't be a bit nearer to proof that Emilius had\nworn it.\"\n\n\"There would be the fact that he might have worn it.\"\n\n\"Madame Goesler, indeed it would not help our client. You see what\nare the difficulties in our way. Mr. Finn was on the spot at the\nmoment, or so near it as to make it certainly possible that he might\nhave been there. There is no such evidence as to Emilius, even if he\ncould be shown to have had a latch-key. The man was killed by such an\ninstrument as Mr. Finn had about him. There is no evidence that Mr.\nEmilius had such an instrument in his hand. A tall man in a grey coat\nwas seen hurrying to the spot at the exact hour. Mr. Finn is a tall\nman and wore a grey coat at the time. Emilius is not a tall man, and,\neven though Meager had a grey coat, there is no evidence to show\nthat Emilius ever wore it. Mr. Finn had quarrelled violently with\nMr. Bonteen within the hour. It does not appear that Emilius ever\nquarrelled with Mr. Bonteen, though Mr. Bonteen had exerted himself\nin opposition to Emilius.\"\n\n\"Is there to be no defence, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly there will be a defence, and such a defence as I think\nwill prevent any jury from being unanimous in convicting my client.\nThough there is a great deal of evidence against him, it is all--what\nwe call circumstantial.\"\n\n\"I understand, Mr. Wickerby.\"\n\n\"Nobody saw him commit the murder.\"\n\n\"Indeed no,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"Although there is personal similarity, there is no personal\nidentity. There is no positive proof of anything illegal on his\npart, or of anything that would have been suspicious had no murder\nbeen committed,--such as the purchase of poison, or carrying\nof a revolver. The life-preserver, had no such instrument been\nunfortunately used, might have been regarded as a thing of custom.\"\n\n\"But I am sure that that Bohemian did murder Mr. Bonteen,\" said\nMadame Goesler, with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Mr. Wickerby, holding up both his hands, \"I can only\nwish that you could be upon the jury.\"\n\n\"And you won't try to show that the other man might have done it?\"\n\n\"I think not. Next to an alibi that breaks down;--you know what an\nalibi is, Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Wickerby; I know what an alibi is.\"\n\n\"Next to an alibi that breaks down, an unsuccessful attempt to affix\nthe fault on another party is the most fatal blow which a prisoner's\ncounsel can inflict upon him. It is always taken by the jury as so\nmuch evidence against him. We must depend altogether on a different\nline of defence.\"\n\n\"What line, Mr. Wickerby?\"\n\n\"Juries are always unwilling to hang,\"--Madame Goesler shuddered\nas the horrid word was broadly pronounced,--\"and are apt to think\nthat simply circumstantial evidence cannot be suffered to demand\nso disagreeable a duty. They are peculiarly averse to hanging a\ngentleman, and will hardly be induced to hang a member of Parliament.\nThen Mr. Finn is very good-looking, and has been popular,--which\nis all in his favour. And we shall have such evidence on the score\nof character as was never before brought into one of our courts.\nWe shall have half the Cabinet. There will be two dukes.\" Madame\nGoesler, as she listened to the admiring enthusiasm of the attorney\nwhile he went on with his list, acknowledged to herself that her\ndear friend, the Duchess, had not been idle. \"There will be three\nSecretaries of State. The Secretary of State for the Home Department\nhimself will be examined. I am not quite sure that we mayn't get the\nLord Chancellor. There will be Mr. Monk,--about the most popular man\nin England,--who will speak of the prisoner as his particular friend.\nI don't think any jury would hang a particular friend of Mr. Monk's.\nAnd there will be ever so many ladies. That has never been done\nbefore, but we mean to try it.\" Madame Goesler had heard all this,\nand had herself assisted in the work. \"I rather think we shall get\nfour or five leading members of the Opposition, for they all disliked\nMr. Bonteen. If we could manage Mr. Daubeny and Mr. Gresham, I think\nwe might reckon ourselves quite safe. I forgot to say that the Bishop\nof Barchester has promised.\"\n\n\"All that won't prove his innocence, Mr. Wickerby.\" Mr. Wickerby\nshrugged his shoulders. \"If he be acquitted after that fashion men\nthen will say--that he was guilty.\"\n\n\"We must think of his life first, Madame Goesler,\" said the attorney.\n\nMadame Goesler when she left the attorney's room was very\nill-satisfied with him. She desired some adherent to her cause who\nwould with affectionate zeal resolve upon washing Phineas Finn white\nas snow in reference to the charge now made against him. But no man\nwould so resolve who did not believe in his innocence,--as Madame\nGoesler believed herself. She herself knew that her own belief was\nromantic and unpractical. Nevertheless, the conviction of the guilt\nof that other man, towards which she still thought that much could\nbe done if that coat were found and the making of a secret key were\nproved, was so strong upon her that she would not allow herself\nto drop it. It would not be sufficient for her that Phineas Finn\nshould be acquitted. She desired that the real murderer should be\nhung for the murder, so that all the world might be sure,--as she\nwas sure,--that her hero had been wrongfully accused.\n\n\"Do you mean that you are going to start yourself?\" the Duchess said\nto her that same afternoon.\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very far gone in love, indeed.\"\n\n\"You would do as much, Duchess, if you were free as I am. It isn't a\nmatter of love at all. It's womanly enthusiasm for the cause one has\ntaken up.\"\n\n\"I'm quite as enthusiastic,--only I shouldn't like to go to Prague in\nJune.\"\n\n\"I'd go to Siberia in January if I could find out that that horrid\nman really committed the murder.\"\n\n\"Who are going with you?\"\n\n\"We shall be quite a company. We have got a detective policeman, and\nan interpreter who understands Czech and German to go about with the\npoliceman, and a lawyer's clerk, and there will be my own maid.\"\n\n\"Everybody will know all about it before you get there.\"\n\n\"We are not to go quite together. The policeman and the interpreter\nare to form one party, and I and my maid another. The poor clerk is\nto be alone. If they get the coat, of course you'll telegraph to me.\"\n\n\"Who is to have the coat?\"\n\n\"I suppose they'll take it to Mr. Wickerby. He says he doesn't want\nit,--that it would do no good. But I think that if we could show that\nthe man might very easily have been out of the house,--that he had\ncertainly provided himself with means of getting out of the house\nsecretly,--the coat would be of service. I am going at any rate; and\nshall be in Paris to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I think it very grand of you, my dear; and for your sake I hope\nhe may live to be Prime Minister. Perhaps, after all, he may give\nPlantagenet his 'Garter.'\"\n\nWhen the old Duke died, a Garter became vacant, and had of course\nfallen to the gift of Mr. Gresham. The Duchess had expected that\nit would be continued in the family, as had been the Lieutenancy\nof Barsetshire, which also had been held by the old Duke. But the\nGarter had been given to Lord Cantrip, and the Duchess was sore. With\nall her Radical propensities and inclination to laugh at dukes and\nmarquises, she thought very much of Garters and Lieutenancies;--but\nher husband would not think of them at all, and hence there were\nwords between them. The Duchess had declared that the Duke should\ninsist on having the Garter. \"These are things that men do not ask\nfor,\" the Duke had said.\n\n\"Don't tell me, Plantagenet, about not asking. Everybody asks for\neverything nowadays.\"\n\n\"Your everybody is not correct, Glencora. I never yet asked for\nanything,--and never shall. No honour has any value in my eyes unless\nit comes unasked.\" Thereupon it was that the Duchess now suggested\nthat Phineas Finn, when Prime Minister, might perhaps bestow a Garter\nupon her husband.\n\nAnd so Madame Goesler started for Prague with the determination\nof being back, if possible, before the trial began. It was to be\ncommenced at the Old Bailey towards the end of June, and people\nalready began to foretell that it would extend over a very long\nperiod. The circumstances seemed to be simple; but they who\nunderstood such matters declared that the duration of a trial\ndepended a great deal more on the public interest felt in the matter\nthan upon its own nature. Now it was already perceived that no\ntrial of modern days had ever been so interesting as would be this\ntrial. It was already known that the Attorney-General, Sir Gregory\nGrogram, was to lead the case for the prosecution, and that the\nSolicitor-General, Sir Simon Slope, was to act with him. It had been\nthought to be due to the memory and character of Mr. Bonteen, who\nwhen he was murdered had held the office of President of the Board of\nTrade, and who had very nearly been Chancellor of the Exchequer, that\nso unusual a task should be imposed on these two high legal officers\nof the Government. No doubt there would be a crowd of juniors with\nthem, but it was understood that Sir Gregory Grogram would himself\ntake the burden of the task upon his own shoulders. It was declared\neverywhere that Sir Gregory did believe Phineas Finn to be guilty,\nbut it was also declared that Sir Simon Slope was convinced he was\ninnocent. The defence was to be entrusted to the well-practised\nbut now aged hands of that most experienced practitioner Mr.\nChaffanbrass, than whom no barrister living or dead ever rescued more\nculprits from the fangs of the law. With Mr. Chaffanbrass, who quite\nlate in life had consented to take a silk gown, was to be associated\nMr. Serjeant Birdbolt,--who was said to be employed in order that the\ncase might be in safe hands should the strength of Mr. Chaffanbrass\nfail him at the last moment; and Mr. Snow, who was supposed to handle\na witness more judiciously than any of the rising men, and that\nsubtle, courageous, eloquent, and painstaking youth, Mr. Golightly,\nwho now, with no more than ten or fifteen years' practice, was\nalready known to be earning his bread and supporting a wife and\nfamily.\n\nBut the glory of this trial would not depend chiefly on the array of\ncounsel, nor on the fact that the Lord Chief Justice himself would be\nthe judge, so much as on the social position of the murdered man and\nof the murderer. Noble lords and great statesmen would throng the\nbench of the court to see Phineas Finn tried, and all the world who\ncould find an entrance would do the same to see the great statesmen\nand the noble lords. The importance of such an affair increases\nlike a snowball as it is rolled on. Many people talk much, and then\nvery many people talk very much more. The under-sheriffs of the\nCity, praiseworthy gentlemen not hitherto widely known to fame,\nbecame suddenly conspicuous and popular, as being the dispensers of\nadmissions to seats in the court. It had been already admitted by\njudges and counsel that sundry other cases must be postponed, because\nit was known that the Bonteen murder would occupy at least a week. It\nwas supposed that Mr. Chaffanbrass would consume a whole day at the\nbeginning of the trial in getting a jury to his mind,--a matter on\nwhich he was known to be very particular,--and another whole day at\nthe end of the trial in submitting to the jury the particulars of all\nthe great cases on record in which circumstantial evidence was known\nto have led to improper verdicts. It was therefore understood that\nthe last week in June would be devoted to the trial, to the exclusion\nof all other matters of interest. When Mr. Gresham, hard pressed by\nMr. Turnbull for a convenient day, offered that gentleman Thursday,\nthe 24th of June, for suggesting to the House a little proposition\nof his own with reference to the English Church establishment, Mr.\nTurnbull openly repudiated the offer, because on that day the trial\nof Phineas Finn would be commenced. \"I hope,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"that\nthe work of the country will not be impeded by that unfortunate\naffair.\" \"I am afraid,\" said Mr. Turnbull, \"that the right honourable\ngentleman will find that the member for Tankerville will on that\nday monopolise the attention of this House.\" The remark was thought\nto have been made in very bad taste, but nobody doubted its truth.\nPerhaps the interest was enhanced among politicians by the existence\nvery generally of an opinion that though Phineas Finn had murdered\nMr. Bonteen, he would certainly be acquitted. Nothing could then\nprevent the acquitted murderer from resuming his seat in the House,\nand gentlemen were already beginning to ask themselves after what\nfashion it would become them to treat him. Would the Speaker catch\nhis eye when he rose to speak? Would he still be \"Phineas\" to the\nvery large number of men with whom his general popularity had made\nhim intimate? Would he be cold-shouldered at the clubs, and treated\nas one whose hands were red with blood? or would he become more\npopular than ever, and receive an ovation after his acquittal?\n\nIn the meantime Madame Goesler started on her journey for Prague.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nTHE TWO DUKES.\n\n\nIt was necessary that the country should be governed, even though\nMr. Bonteen had been murdered;--and in order that it should be duly\ngoverned it was necessary that Mr. Bonteen's late place at the Board\nof Trade should be filled. There was some hesitation as to the\nfilling it, and when the arrangement was completed people were very\nmuch surprised indeed. Mr. Bonteen had been appointed chiefly because\nit was thought that he might in that office act as a quasi House of\nCommons deputy to the Duke of Omnium in carrying out his great scheme\nof a five-farthinged penny and a ten-pennied shilling. The Duke, in\nspite of his wealth and rank and honour, was determined to go on with\nhis great task. Life would be nothing to him now unless he could at\nleast hope to arrange the five farthings. When his wife had bullied\nhim about the Garter he had declared to her, and with perfect truth,\nthat he had never asked for anything. He had gone on to say that he\nnever would ask for anything; and he certainly did not think that\nhe was betraying himself with reference to that assurance when he\nsuggested to Mr. Gresham that he would himself take the place left\nvacant by Mr. Bonteen--of course retaining his seat in the Cabinet.\n\n\"I should hardly have ventured to suggest such an arrangement to your\nGrace,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Feeling that it might be so, I thought that I would venture to\nask,\" said the Duke. \"I am sure you know that I am the last man to\ninterfere as to place or the disposition of power.\"\n\n\"Quite the last man,\" said Mr. Gresham.\n\n\"But it has always been held that the Board of Trade is not\nincompatible with the Peerage.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes.\"\n\n\"And I can feel myself nearer to this affair of mine there than I can\nelsewhere.\"\n\nMr. Gresham of course had no objection to urge. This great nobleman,\nwho was now asking for Mr. Bonteen's shoes, had been Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, and would have remained Chancellor of the Exchequer\nhad not the mantle of his nobility fallen upon him. At the present\nmoment he held an office in which peers are often temporarily\nshelved, or put away, perhaps, out of harm's way for the time, so\nthat they may be brought down and used when wanted, without having\nreceived crack or detriment from that independent action into which a\npolitician is likely to fall when his party is \"in\" but he is still\n\"out\". He was Lord Privy Seal,--a Lordship of State which does carry\nwith it a status and a seat in the Cabinet, but does not necessarily\nentail any work. But the present Lord, who cared nothing for status,\nand who was much more intent on his work than he was even on his seat\nin the Cabinet, was possessed by what many of his brother politicians\nregarded as a morbid dislike to pretences. He had not been happy\nduring his few weeks of the Privy Seal, and had almost envied Mr.\nBonteen the realities of the Board of Trade. \"I think upon the whole\nit will be best to make the change,\" he said to Mr. Gresham. And Mr.\nGresham was delighted.\n\nBut there were one or two men of mark,--one or two who were older\nthan Mr. Gresham probably, and less perfect in their Liberal\nsympathies,--who thought that the Duke of Omnium was derogating from\nhis proper position in the step which he was now taking. Chief among\nthese was his friend the Duke of St. Bungay, who alone perhaps could\nventure to argue the matter with him. \"I almost wish that you had\nspoken to me first,\" said the elder Duke.\n\n\"I feared that I should find you so strongly opposed to my\nresolution.\"\n\n\"If it was a resolution.\"\n\n\"I think it was,\" said the younger. \"It was a great misfortune to me\nthat I should have been obliged to leave the House of Commons.\"\n\n\"You should not feel it so.\"\n\n\"My whole life was there,\" said he who, as Plantagenet Palliser, had\nbeen so good a commoner.\n\n\"But your whole life should certainly not be there now,--nor your\nwhole heart. On you the circumstances of your birth have imposed\nduties quite as high, and I will say quite as useful, as any which a\ncareer in the House of Commons can put within the reach of a man.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Duke?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do. I do think that the England which we know could not\nbe the England that she is but for the maintenance of a high-minded,\nproud, and self-denying nobility. And though with us there is no\nline dividing our very broad aristocracy into two parts, a higher\nand a lower, or a greater and a smaller, or a richer and a poorer,\nnevertheless we all feel that the success of our order depends\nchiefly on the conduct of those whose rank is the highest and whose\nmeans are the greatest. To some few, among whom you are conspicuously\none, wealth has been given so great and rank so high that much of\nthe welfare of your country depends on the manner in which you bear\nyourself as the Duke of Omnium.\"\n\n\"I would not wish to think so.\"\n\n\"Your uncle so thought. And, though he was a man very different from\nyou, not inured to work in his early life, with fewer attainments,\nprobably a slower intellect, and whose general conduct was inferior\nto your own,--I speak freely because the subject is important,--he\nwas a man who understood his position and the requirements of his\norder very thoroughly. A retinue almost Royal, together with an\nexpenditure which Royalty could not rival, secured for him the\nrespect of the nation.\"\n\n\"Your life has not been as was his, and you have won a higher\nrespect.\"\n\n\"I think not. The greater part of my life was spent in the House of\nCommons, and my fortune was never much more than the tenth of his.\nBut I wish to make no such comparison.\"\n\n\"I must make it, if I am to judge which I would follow.\"\n\n\"Pray understand me, my friend,\" said the old man, energetically. \"I\nam not advising you to abandon public life in order that you may live\nin repose as a great nobleman. It would not be in your nature to do\nso, nor could the country afford to lose your services. But you need\nnot therefore take your place in the arena of politics as though you\nwere still Plantagenet Palliser, with no other duties than those of a\npolitician,--as you might so well have done had your uncle's titles\nand wealth descended to a son.\"\n\n\"I wish they had,\" said the regretful Duke.\n\n\"It cannot be so. Your brother perhaps wishes that he were a Duke,\nbut it has been arranged otherwise. It is vain to repine. Your wife\nis unhappy because your uncle's Garter was not at once given to you.\"\n\n\"Glencora is like other women,--of course.\"\n\n\"I share her feelings. Had Mr. Gresham consulted me, I should not\nhave scrupled to tell him that it would have been for the welfare of\nhis party that the Duke of Omnium should be graced with any and every\nhonour in his power to bestow. Lord Cantrip is my friend, almost as\nwarmly as are you; but the country would not have missed the ribbon\nfrom the breast of Lord Cantrip. Had you been more the Duke, and less\nthe slave of your country, it would have been sent to you. Do I make\nyou angry by speaking so?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. I have but one ambition.\"\n\n\"And that is--?\"\n\n\"To be the serviceable slave of my country.\"\n\n\"A master is more serviceable than a slave,\" said the old man.\n\n\"No; no; I deny it. I can admit much from you, but I cannot admit\nthat. The politician who becomes the master of his country sinks from\nthe statesman to the tyrant.\"\n\n\"We misunderstand each other, my friend. Pitt, and Peel, and\nPalmerston were not tyrants, though each assumed and held for\nhimself to the last the mastery of which I speak. Smaller men who\nhave been slaves, have been as patriotic as they, but less useful.\nI regret that you should follow Mr. Bonteen in his office.\"\n\n\"Because he was Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"All the circumstances of the transfer of office occasioned by your\nuncle's death seem to me to make it undesirable. I would not have\nyou make yourself too common. This very murder adds to the feeling.\nBecause Mr. Bonteen has been lost to us, the Minister has recourse to\nyou.\"\n\n\"It was my own suggestion.\"\n\n\"But who knows that it was so? You, and I, and Mr. Gresham--and\nperhaps one or two others.\"\n\n\"It is too late now, Duke; and, to tell the truth of myself, not even\nyou can make me other than I am. My uncle's life to me was always a\nproblem which I could not understand. Were I to attempt to walk in\nhis ways I should fail utterly, and become absurd. I do not feel the\ndisgrace of following Mr. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"I trust you may at least be less unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. I need not expect to be murdered in the streets because\nI am going to the Board of Trade. I shall have made no enemy by my\npolitical success.\"\n\n\"You think that--Mr. Finn--did do that deed?\" asked the elder Duke.\n\n\"I hardly know what I think. My wife is sure that he is innocent.\"\n\n\"The Duchess is enthusiastic always.\"\n\n\"Many others think the same. Lord and Lady Chiltern are sure of\nthat.\"\n\n\"They were always his best friends.\"\n\n\"I am told that many of the lawyers are sure that it will be\nimpossible to convict him. If he be acquitted I shall strive to think\nhim innocent. He will come back to the House, of course.\"\n\n\"I should think he would apply for the Hundreds,\" said the Duke of\nSt. Bungay.\n\n\"I do not see why he should. I would not in his place. If he be\ninnocent, why should he admit himself unfit for a seat in Parliament?\nI tell you what he might do;--resign, and then throw himself again\nupon his constituency.\" The other Duke shook his head, thereby\ndeclaring his opinion that Phineas Finn was in truth the man who had\nmurdered Mr. Bonteen.\n\nWhen it was publicly known that the Duke of Omnium had stepped into\nMr. Bonteen's shoes, the general opinion certainly coincided with\nthat given by the Duke of St. Bungay. It was not only that the\nlate Chancellor of the Exchequer should not have consented to fill\nso low an office, or that the Duke of Omnium should have better\nknown his own place, or that he should not have succeeded a man so\ninsignificant as Mr. Bonteen. These things, no doubt, were said,--but\nmore was said also. It was thought that he should not have gone to\nan office which had been rendered vacant by the murder of a man\nwho had been placed there merely to assist himself. If the present\narrangement was good, why should it not have been made independently\nof Mr. Bonteen? Questions were asked about it in both Houses, and\nthe transfer no doubt did have the effect of lowering the man in the\nestimation of the political world. He himself felt that he did not\nstand so high with his colleagues as when he was Chancellor of the\nExchequer; not even so high as when he held the Privy Seal. In the\nprinted lists of those who attended the Cabinets his name generally\nwas placed last, and an opponent on one occasion thought, or\npretended to think, that he was no more than Postmaster-General. He\ndetermined to bear all this without wincing,--but he did wince. He\nwould not own to himself that he had been wrong, but he was sore,--as\na man is sore who doubts about his own conduct; and he was not the\nless so because he strove to bear his wife's sarcasms without showing\nthat they pained him.\n\n\"They say that poor Lord Fawn is losing his mind,\" she said to him.\n\n\"Lord Fawn! I haven't heard anything about it.\"\n\n\"He was engaged to Lady Eustace once, you remember. They say that\nhe'll be made to declare why he didn't marry her if this bigamy case\ngoes on. And then it's so unfortunate that he should have seen the\nman in the grey coat; I hope he won't have to resign.\"\n\n\"I hope not, indeed.\"\n\n\"Because, of course, you'd have to take his place as\nUnder-Secretary.\" This was very awkward;--but the husband only\nsmiled, and expressed a hope that if he did so he might himself be\nequal to his new duties. \"By the bye, Plantagenet, what do you mean\nto do about the jewels?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought about them. Madame Goesler had better take them.\"\n\n\"But she won't.\"\n\n\"I suppose they had better be sold.\"\n\n\"By auction?\"\n\n\"That would be the proper way.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like that at all. Couldn't we buy them ourselves, and\nlet the money stand till she choose to take it? It's an affair of\ntrade, I suppose, and you're at the head of all that now.\" Then\nagain she asked him some question about the Home Secretary, with\nreference to Phineas Finn; and when he told her that it would be\nhighly improper for him to speak to that officer on such a subject,\nshe pretended to suppose that the impropriety would consist in the\ninterference of a man holding so low a position as he was. \"Of course\nit is not the same now,\" she said, \"as it used to be when you were at\nthe Exchequer.\" All which he took without uttering a word of anger,\nor showing a sign of annoyance. \"You only get two thousand a year, do\nyou, at the Board of Trade, Plantagenet?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I forget. I think it's two thousand five hundred.\"\n\n\"How nice! It was five at the Exchequer, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes; five thousand at the Exchequer.\"\n\n\"When you're a Lord of the Treasury it will only be one;--will it?\"\n\n\"What a goose you are, Glencora. If it suited me to be a Lord of the\nTreasury, what difference would the salary make?\"\n\n\"Not the least;--nor yet the rank, or the influence, or the prestige,\nor the general fitness of things. You are above all such sublunary\nideas. You would clean Mr. Gresham's shoes for him, if--the service\nof your country required it.\" These last words she added in a tone\nof voice very similar to that which her husband himself used on\noccasions.\n\n\"I would even allow you to clean them,--if the service of the country\nrequired it,\" said the Duke.\n\nBut, though he was magnanimous, he was not happy, and perhaps the\nintense anxiety which his wife displayed as to the fate of Phineas\nFinn added to his discomfort. The Duchess, as the Duke of St. Bungay\nhad said, was enthusiastic, and he never for a moment dreamed of\nteaching her to change her nature; but it would have been as well\nif her enthusiasm at the present moment could have been brought to\ndisplay itself on some other subject. He had been brought to feel\nthat Phineas Finn had been treated badly when the good things of\nGovernment were being given away, and that this had been caused by\nthe jealous prejudices of the man who had been since murdered. But an\nexpectant Under-Secretary of State, let him have been ever so cruelly\nleft out in the cold, should not murder the man by whom he has been\nill-treated. Looking at all the evidence as best he could, and\nlistening to the opinions of others, the Duke did think that Phineas\nhad been guilty. The murder had clearly been committed by a personal\nenemy, not by a robber. Two men were known to have entertained\nfeelings of enmity against Mr. Bonteen; as to one of whom he was\nassured that it was impossible that he should have been on the\nspot. As to the other it seemed equally manifest that he must have\nbeen there. If it were so, it would have been much better that his\nwife should not display her interest publicly in the murderer's\nfavour. But the Duchess, wherever she went, spoke of the trial as a\npersecution; and seemed to think that the prisoner should already be\ntreated as a hero and a martyr. \"Glencora,\" he said to her, \"I wish\nthat you could drop the subject of this trial till it be over.\"\n\n\"But I can't.\"\n\n\"Surely you can avoid speaking of it.\"\n\n\"No more than you can avoid your decimals. Out of the full heart the\nmouth speaks, and my heart is very full. What harm do I do?\"\n\n\"You set people talking of you.\"\n\n\"They have been doing that ever since we were married;--but I do not\nknow that they have made out much against me. We must go after our\nnature, Plantagenet. Your nature is decimals. I run after units.\" He\ndid not deem it wise to say anything further,--knowing that to this\nevil also of Phineas Finn the gods would at last vouchsafe an ending.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nMRS. BONTEEN.\n\n\nAt the time of the murder, Lady Eustace, whom we must regard as the\nwife of Mr. Emilius till it be proved that he had another wife when\nhe married her, was living as the guest of Mr. Bonteen. Mr. Bonteen\nhad pledged himself to prove the bigamy, and Mrs. Bonteen had opened\nher house and her heart to the injured lady. Lizzie Eustace, as\nshe had always been called, was clever, rich, and pretty, and knew\nwell how to ingratiate herself with the friend of the hour. She was\na greedy, grasping little woman, but, when she had before her a\nsufficient object, she could appear to pour all that she had into\nher friend's lap with all the prodigality of a child. Perhaps Mrs.\nBonteen had liked to have things poured into her lap. Perhaps Mr.\nBonteen had enjoyed the confidential tears of a pretty woman. It may\nbe that the wrongs of a woman doomed to live with Mr. Emilius as his\nwife had touched their hearts. Be that as it might, they had become\nthe acknowledged friends and supporters of Lady Eustace, and she was\nliving with them in their little house in St. James's Place on that\nfatal night.\n\n\n[Illustration: Lizzie Eustace.]\n\n\nLizzie behaved herself very well when the terrible tidings were\nbrought home. Mr. Bonteen was so often late at the House or at his\nclub that his wife rarely sat up for him; and when the servants were\ndisturbed between six and seven o'clock in the morning, no surprise\nhad as yet been felt at his absence. The sergeant of police who had\nbrought the news sent for the maid of the unfortunate lady, and the\nmaid, in her panic, told her story to Lady Eustace before daring to\ncommunicate it to her mistress. Lizzie Eustace, who in former days\nhad known something of policemen, saw the man, and learned from him\nall that there was to learn. Then, while the sergeant remained on the\nlanding place, outside, to support her, if necessary, with the maid\nby her side to help her, kneeling by the bed, she told the wretched\nwoman what had happened. We need not witness the paroxysms of the\nwidow's misery, but we may understand that Lizzie Eustace was from\nthat moment more strongly fixed than ever in her friendship with Mrs.\nBonteen.\n\nWhen the first three or four days of agony and despair had passed\nby, and the mind of the bereaved woman was able to turn itself from\nthe loss to the cause of the loss, Mrs. Bonteen became fixed in her\ncertainty that Phineas Finn had murdered her husband, and seemed\nto think that it was the first and paramount duty of the present\nGovernment to have the murderer hung,--almost without a trial.\nWhen she found that, at the best, the execution of the man she so\nvehemently hated could not take place for two months after the doing\nof the deed, even if then, she became almost frantic in her anger.\nSurely they would not let him escape! What more proof could be\nneeded? Had not the miscreant quarrelled with her husband, and\nbehaved abominably to him but a few minutes before the murder? Had he\nnot been on the spot with the murderous instrument in his pocket? Had\nhe not been seen by Lord Fawn hastening on the steps of her dear and\ndoomed husband? Mrs. Bonteen, as she sat enveloped in her new weeds,\nthirsting for blood, could not understand that further evidence\nshould be needed, or that a rational doubt should remain in the mind\nof any one who knew the circumstances. It was to her as though she\nhad seen the dastard blow struck, and with such conviction as this on\nher mind did she insist on talking of the coming trial to her inmate,\nLady Eustace. But Lizzie had her own opinion, though she was forced\nto leave it unexpressed in the presence of Mrs. Bonteen. She knew\nthe man who claimed her as his wife, and did not think that Phineas\nFinn was guilty of the murder. Her Emilius,--her Yosef Mealyus, as\nshe had delighted to call him, since she had separated herself from\nhim,--was, as she thought, the very man to commit a murder. He was\nby no means degraded in her opinion by the feeling. To commit great\ncrimes is the line of life that comes naturally to some men, and was,\nas she thought, a line less objectionable than that which confines\nitself to small crimes. She almost felt that the audacity of her\nhusband in doing such a deed redeemed her from some of the ignominy\nto which she had subjected herself by her marriage with a runaway\nwho had another wife living. There was a dash of adventure about\nit which was almost gratifying. But these feelings she was obliged,\nat any rate for the present, to keep to herself. Not only must she\nacknowledge the undoubted guilt of Phineas Finn for the sake of her\nfriend, Mrs. Bonteen; but she must consider carefully whether she\nwould gain or lose more by having a murderer for her husband. She\ndid not relish the idea of being made a widow by the gallows. She\nwas still urgent as to the charge of bigamy, and should she succeed\nin proving that the man had never been her husband, then she did\nnot care how soon they might hang him. But for the present it was\nbetter for all reasons that she should cling to the Phineas Finn\ntheory,--feeling certain that it was the bold hand of her own Emilius\nwho had struck the blow.\n\nShe was by no means free from the solicitations of her husband, who\nknew well where she was, and who still adhered to his purpose of\nreclaiming his wife and his wife's property. When he was released by\nthe magistrate's order, and had recovered his goods from Mr. Meager's\nhouse, and was once more established in lodgings, humbler, indeed,\nthan those in Northumberland Street, he wrote the following letter to\nher who had been for one blessed year the partner of his joys, and\nhis bosom's mistress:--\n\n\n   3, Jellybag Street, Edgware Road,\n   May 26, 18--.\n\n   DEAREST WIFE,--\n\n   You will have heard to what additional sorrow and disgrace\n   I have been subjected through the malice of my enemies.\n   But all in vain! Though princes and potentates have been\n   arrayed against me [the princes and potentates had no\n   doubt been Lord Chiltern and Mr. Low], innocence has\n   prevailed, and I have come out from the ordeal white as\n   bleached linen or unsullied snow. The murderer is in the\n   hands of justice, and though he be the friend of kings and\n   princes [Mr. Emilius had probably heard that the Prince\n   had been at the club with Phineas], yet shall justice\n   be done upon him, and the truth of the Lord shall be\n   made to prevail. Mr. Bonteen has been very hostile to\n   me, believing evil things of me, and instigating you, my\n   beloved, to believe evil of me. Nevertheless, I grieve\n   for his death. I lament bitterly that he should have been\n   cut off in his sins, and hurried before the judgment\n   seat of the great Judge without an hour given to him for\n   repentance. Let us pray that the mercy of the Lord may\n   be extended even to him. I beg that you will express my\n   deepest commiseration to his widow, and assure her that\n   she has my prayers.\n\n   And now, my dearest wife, let me approach my own affairs.\n   As I have come out unscorched from the last fiery furnace\n   which has been heated for me by my enemies seven times\n   hot, so shall I escape from that other fire with which the\n   poor man who has gone from us endeavoured to envelop me.\n   If they have made you believe that I have any wife but\n   yourself they have made you believe a falsehood. You, and\n   you only, have my hand. You, and you only, have my heart.\n   I know well what attempts are being made to suborn false\n   evidence in my old country, and how the follies of my\n   youth are being pressed against me,--how anxious are proud\n   Englishmen that the poor Bohemian should be robbed of the\n   beauty and wit and wealth which he had won for himself.\n   But the Lord fights on my side, and I shall certainly\n   prevail.\n\n   If you will come back to me all shall be forgiven. My\n   heart is as it ever was. Come, and let us leave this cold\n   and ungenial country and go to the sunny south; to the\n   islands of the blest,--\n\n\nMr. Emilius during his married life had not quite fathomed the depths\nof his wife's character, though, no doubt, he had caught some points\nof it with sufficient accuracy.\n\n\n   --where we may forget these blood-stained sorrows, and\n   mutually forgive each other. What happiness, what joys\n   can you expect in your present mode of life? Even your\n   income,--which in truth is my income,--you cannot obtain,\n   because the tenants will not dare to pay it in opposition\n   to my legal claims. But of what use is gold? What can\n   purple do for us, and fine linen, and rich jewels, without\n   love and a contented heart? Come, dearest, once more to\n   your own one, who will never remember aught of the sad\n   rupture which enemies have made, and we will hurry to the\n   setting sun, and recline on mossy banks, and give up our\n   souls to Elysium.\n\n\nAs Lizzie read this she uttered an exclamation of disgust. Did the\nman after all know so little of her as to suppose that she, with all\nher experiences, did not know how to keep her own life and her own\npocket separate from her romance? She despised him for this, almost\nas much as she respected him for the murder.\n\n\n   If you will only say that you will see me, I will be at\n   your feet in a moment. Till the solemnity with which the\n   late tragical event must have filled you shall have left\n   you leisure to think of all this, I will not force myself\n   into your presence, or seek to secure by law rights which\n   will be much dearer to me if they are accorded by your own\n   sweet goodwill. And in the meantime, I will agree that\n   the income shall be drawn, provided that it be equally\n   divided between us. I have been sorely straitened in\n   my circumstances by these last events. My congregation\n   is of course dispersed. Though my innocence has been\n   triumphantly displayed, my name has been tarnished. It is\n   with difficulty that I find a spot where to lay my weary\n   head. I am ahungered and athirst;--and my very garments\n   are parting from me in my need. Can it be that you\n   willingly doom me to such misery because of my love for\n   you? Had I been less true to you, it might have been\n   otherwise.\n\n   Let me have an answer at once, and I will instantly take\n   steps about the money if you will agree.\n\n   Your truly most loving husband,\n\n   JOSEPH EMILIUS.\n\n   To Lady Eustace, wife of the Rev. Joseph Emilius.\n\n\nWhen Lizzie had read the letter twice through she resolved that she\nwould show it to her friend. \"I know it will reopen the floodgates of\nyour grief,\" she said; \"but unless you see it, how can I ask from you\nthe advice which is so necessary to me?\" But Mrs. Bonteen was a woman\nsincere at any rate in this,--that the loss of her husband had been\nto her so crushing a calamity that there could be no reopening of the\nfloodgates. The grief that cannot bear allusion to its causes has\ngenerally something of affectation in its composition. The floodgates\nwith this widowed one had never yet been for a moment closed. It was\nnot that her tears were ever flowing, but that her heart had never\nyet for a moment ceased to feel that its misery was incapable of\nalleviation. No utterances concerning her husband could make her more\nwretched than she was. She took the letter and read it through. \"I\ndaresay he is a bad man,\" said Mrs. Bonteen.\n\n\"Indeed he is,\" said the bad man's wife.\n\n\"But he was not guilty of this crime.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--I am sure of that,\" said Lady Eustace, feeling certain at\nthe same time that Mr. Bonteen had fallen by her husband's hands.\n\n\"And therefore I am glad they have given him up. There can be no\ndoubt now about it.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows who did it now,\" said Lady Eustace.\n\n\"Infamous ruffian! My poor dear lost one always knew what he was. Oh\nthat such a creature should have been allowed to come among us.\"\n\n\"Of course he'll be hung, Mrs. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"Hung! I should think so! What other end would be fit for him? Oh,\nyes; they must hang him. But it makes one think that the world is too\nhard a place to live in, when such a one as he can cause so great a\nruin.\"\n\n\"It has been very terrible.\"\n\n\"Think what the country has lost! They tell me that the Duke of\nOmnium is to take my husband's place; but the Duke cannot do what\nhe did. Every one knows that for real work there was no one like\nhim. Nothing was more certain than that he would have been Prime\nMinister,--oh, very soon. They ought to pinch him to death with\nred-hot tweezers.\"\n\nBut Lady Eustace was anxious at the present moment to talk about her\nown troubles. \"Of course, Mr. Emilius did not commit the murder.\"\n\n\"Phineas Finn committed it,\" said the half-maddened woman, rising\nfrom her chair. \"And Phineas Finn shall hang by his neck till he is\ndead.\"\n\n\"But Emilius has certainly got another wife in Prague.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know. He said it was so, and he was always right.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,--just as you are sure of this horrid Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"The two things can't be named together, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I wouldn't think of being so unfeeling. But he has\nwritten me this letter, and what must I do? It is very dreadful about\nthe money, you know.\"\n\n\"He cannot touch your money. My dear one always said that he could\nnot touch it.\"\n\n\"But he prevents me from touching it. What they give me only comes\nby a sort of favour from the lawyer. I almost wish that I had\ncompromised.\"\n\n\"You would not be rid of him that way.\"\n\n\"No;--not quite rid of him. You see I never had to take that horrid\nname because of the title. I suppose I'd better send the letter to\nthe lawyer.\"\n\n\"Send it to the lawyer, of course. That is what he would have done.\nThey tell me that the trial is to be on the 24th of June. Why should\nthey postpone it so long? They know all about it. They always\npostpone everything. If he had lived, there would be an end of that\nbefore long.\"\n\nLady Eustace was tired of the virtues of her friend's martyred lord,\nand was very anxious to talk of her own affairs. She was still\nholding her husband's letter open in her hand, and was thinking how\nshe could force her friend's dead lion to give place for a while\nto her own live dog, when a servant announced that Mr. Camperdown,\nthe attorney, was below. In former days there had been an old Mr.\nCamperdown, who was vehemently hostile to poor Lizzie Eustace; but\nnow, in her new troubles, the firm that had ever been true to her\nfirst husband had taken up her case for the sake of the family and\nher property--and for the sake of the heir, Lizzie Eustace's little\nboy; and Mr. Camperdown's firm had, next to Mr. Bonteen, been the\ndepository of her trust. He had sent clerks out to Prague,--one who\nhad returned ill,--as some had said poisoned, though the poison had\nprobably been nothing more than the diet natural to Bohemians. And\nthen another had been sent. This, of course, had all been previous\nto Madame Goesler's self-imposed mission,--which, though it was\noccasioned altogether by the suspected wickednesses of Mr. Emilius,\nhad no special reference to his matrimonial escapades. And now Mr.\nCamperdown was down stairs. \"Shall I go down to him, dear Mrs.\nBonteen?\"\n\n\"He may come here if you please.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better go down. He will disturb you.\"\n\n\"My darling lost one always thought that there should be two present\nto hear such matters. He said it was safer.\" Mr. Camperdown, junior,\nwas therefore shown upstairs to Mrs. Bonteen's drawing-room.\n\n\"We have found it all out, Lady Eustace,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"Found out what?\"\n\n\"We've got Madame Mealyus over here.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mrs. Bonteen, with her hands raised. Lady Eustace sat\nsilent, with her mouth open.\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--and photographs of the registry of the marriage\nfrom the books of the synagogue at Cracow. His signature was Yosef\nMealyus, and his handwriting isn't a bit altered. I think we could\nhave proved it without the lady; but of course it was better to bring\nher if possible.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Lizzie, thinking that she would like to see her\nown predecessor.\n\n\"We have her safe, Lady Eustace. She's not in custody; but as\nshe can't speak a word of English or French, she finds it more\ncomfortable to be kept in private. We're afraid it will cost a little\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Will she swear that she is his wife?\" asked Mrs. Bonteen.\n\n\"Oh, yes; there'll be no difficulty about that. But her swearing\nalone mightn't be enough.\"\n\n\"Surely that settles it all,\" said Lady Eustace.\n\n\"For the money that we shall have to pay,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"we\nmight probably have got a dozen Bohemian ladies to come and swear\nthat they were married to Yosef Mealyus at Cracow. The difficulty has\nbeen to bring over documentary evidence which will satisfy a jury\nthat this is the woman she says she is. But I think we've got it.\"\n\n\"And I shall be free!\" said Lady Eustace, clasping her hands\ntogether.\n\n\"It will cost a good deal, I fear,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"But I shall be free! Oh, Mr. Camperdown, there is not a woman in all\nthe world who cares so little for money as I do. But I shall be free\nfrom the power of that horrid man who has entangled me in the meshes\nof his sinful life.\" Mr. Camperdown told her that he thought that\nshe would be free, and went on to say that Yosef Mealyus had already\nbeen arrested, and was again in prison. The unfortunate man had not\ntherefore long enjoyed that humbler apartment which he had found for\nhimself in Jellybag Street.\n\nWhen Mr. Camperdown went, Mrs. Bonteen followed him out to the top\nof the stairs. \"You have heard about the trial, Mr. Camperdown?\" He\nsaid that he knew that it was to take place at the Central Criminal\nCourt in June. \"Yes; I don't know why they have put it off so long.\nPeople know that he did it--eh?\" Mr. Camperdown, with funereal\nsadness, declared that he had never looked into the matter. \"I cannot\nunderstand that everybody should not know it,\" said Mrs. Bonteen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nTWO DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL.\n\n\nThere was a scene in the private room of Mr. Wickerby, the attorney\nin Hatton Garden, which was very distressing indeed to the feelings\nof Lord Fawn, and which induced his lordship to think that he was\nbeing treated without that respect which was due to him as a peer\nand a member of the Government. There were present at this scene Mr.\nChaffanbrass, the old barrister, Mr. Wickerby himself, Mr. Wickerby's\nconfidential clerk, Lord Fawn, Lord Fawn's solicitor,--that same\nMr. Camperdown whom we saw in the last chapter calling upon Lady\nEustace,--and a policeman. Lord Fawn had been invited to attend, with\nmany protestations of regret as to the trouble thus imposed upon him,\nbecause the very important nature of the evidence about to be given\nby him at the forthcoming trial seemed to render it expedient that\nsome questions should be asked. This was on Tuesday, the 22nd June,\nand the trial was to be commenced on the following Thursday. And\nthere was present in the room, very conspicuously, an old heavy grey\ngreat coat, as to which Mr. Wickerby had instructed Mr. Chaffanbrass\nthat evidence was forthcoming, if needed, to prove that that coat was\nlying on the night of the murder in a downstairs room in the house\nin which Yosef Mealyus was then lodging. The reader will remember\nthe history of the coat. Instigated by Madame Goesler, who was\nstill absent from England, Mr. Wickerby had traced the coat, and\nhad purchased the coat, and was in a position to prove that this\nvery coat was the coat which Mr. Meager had brought home with him to\nNorthumberland Street on that day. But Mr. Wickerby was of opinion\nthat the coat had better not be used. \"It does not go far enough,\"\nsaid Mr. Wickerby. \"It don't go very far, certainly,\" said Mr.\nChaffanbrass. \"And if you try to show that another man has done it,\nand he hasn't,\" said Mr. Wickerby, \"it always tells against you\nwith a jury.\" To this Mr. Chaffanbrass made no reply, preferring to\nform his own opinion, and to keep it to himself when formed. But in\nobedience to his instructions, Lord Fawn was asked to attend at Mr.\nWickerby's chambers, in the cause of truth, and the coat was brought\nout on the occasion. \"Was that the sort of coat the man wore, my\nlord?\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass as Mr. Wickerby held up the coat to\nview. Lord Fawn walked round and round the coat, and looked at it\nvery carefully before he would vouchsafe a reply. \"You see it is a\ngrey coat,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass, not speaking at all in the tone\nwhich Mr. Wickerby's note had induced Lord Fawn to expect.\n\n\"It is grey,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Perhaps it's not the same shade of grey, Lord Fawn. You see, my\nlord, we are most anxious not to impute guilt where guilt doesn't\nlie. You are a witness for the Crown, and, of course, you will tell\nthe Crown lawyers all that passes here. Were it possible, we would\nmake this little preliminary inquiry in their presence;--but we can\nhardly do that. Mr. Finn's coat was a very much smaller coat.\"\n\n\"I should think it was,\" said his lordship, who did not like being\nquestioned about coats.\n\n\"You don't think the coat the man wore when you saw him was a big\ncoat like that? You think he wore a little coat?\"\n\n\"He wore a grey coat,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"This is grey;--a coat shouldn't be greyer than that.\"\n\n\"I don't think Lord Fawn should be asked any more questions on the\nmatter till he gives his evidence in court,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"A man's life depends on it, Mr. Camperdown,\" said the barrister. \"It\nisn't a matter of cross-examination. If I bring that coat into court\nI must make a charge against another man by the very act of doing so.\nAnd I will not do so unless I believe that other man to be guilty.\nIt's an inquiry I can't postpone till we are before the jury. It\nisn't that I want to trump up a case against another man for the sake\nof extricating my client on a false issue. Lord Fawn doesn't want to\nhang Mr. Finn if Mr. Finn be not guilty.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said his lordship.\n\n\"Mr. Finn couldn't have worn that coat, or a coat at all like it.\"\n\n\"What is it you do want to learn, Mr. Chaffanbrass?\" asked Mr.\nCamperdown.\n\n\"Just put on the coat, Mr. Scruby.\" Then at the order of the\nbarrister, Mr. Scruby, the attorney's clerk, did put on Mr. Meager's\nold great coat, and walked about the room in it. \"Walk quick,\" said\nMr. Chaffanbrass;--and the clerk did \"walk quick.\" He was a stout,\nthick-set little man, nearly half a foot shorter than Phineas Finn.\n\"Is that at all like the figure?\" asked Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n\"I think it is like the figure,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"And like the coat?\"\n\n\"It's the same colour as the coat.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't swear it was not the coat?\"\n\n\"I am not on my oath at all, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"No, my lord;--but to me your word is as good as your oath. If you\nthink it possible that was the coat--\"\n\n\"I don't think anything about it at all. When Mr. Scruby hurries down\nthe room in that way he looks as the man looked when he was hurrying\nunder the lamp-post. I am not disposed to say any more at present.\"\n\n\"It's a matter of regret to me that Lord Fawn should have come here\nat all,\" said Mr. Camperdown, who had been summoned to meet his\nclient at the chambers, but had come with him.\n\n\"I suppose his lordship wishes us to know all that he knew, seeing\nthat it's a question of hanging the right man or the wrong one. I\nnever heard such trash in my life. Take it off, Mr. Scruby, and let\nthe policeman keep it. I understand Lord Fawn to say that the man's\nfigure was about the same as yours. My client, I believe, stands\nabout twelve inches taller. Thank you, my lord;--we shall get at\nthe truth at last, I don't doubt.\" It was afterwards said that Mr.\nChaffanbrass's conduct had been very improper in enticing Lord Fawn\nto Mr. Wickerby's chambers; but Mr. Chaffanbrass never cared what\nany one said. \"I don't know that we can make much of it,\" he said,\nwhen he and Mr. Wickerby were alone, \"but it may be as well to bring\nit into court. It would prove nothing against the Jew even if that\nfellow,\"--he meant Lord Fawn,--\"could be made to swear that the\ncoat worn was exactly similar to this. I am thinking now about the\nheight.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but you'll get him off.\"\n\n\"Well;--I may do so. They ought not to hang any man on such evidence\nas there is against him, even though there were no moral doubt of his\nguilt. There is nothing really to connect Mr. Phineas Finn with the\nmurder,--nothing tangible. But there is no saying nowadays what a\njury will do. Juries depend a great deal more on the judge than they\nused to do. If I were on trial for my life, I don't think I'd have\ncounsel at all.\"\n\n\"No one could defend you as well as yourself, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that. No;--I shouldn't defend myself. I should say\nto the judge, 'My lord, I don't doubt the jury will do just as you\ntell them, and you'll form your own opinion quite independent of the\narguments.'\"\n\n\"You'd be hung, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"No; I don't know that I should,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass, slowly. \"I\ndon't think I could affront a judge of the present day into hanging\nme. They've too much of what I call thick-skinned honesty for that.\nIt's the temper of the time to resent nothing,--to be mealy-mouthed\nand mealy-hearted. Jurymen are afraid of having their own opinion,\nand almost always shirk a verdict when they can.\"\n\n\"But we do get verdicts.\"\n\n\"Yes; the judges give them. And they are mealy-mouthed verdicts,\ntending to equalise crime and innocence, and to make men think that\nafter all it may be a question whether fraud is violence, which,\nafter all, is manly, and to feel that we cannot afford to hate\ndishonesty. It was a bad day for the commercial world, Mr. Wickerby,\nwhen forgery ceased to be capital.\"\n\n\"It was a horrid thing to hang a man for writing another man's name\nto a receipt for thirty shillings.\"\n\n\"We didn't do it, but the fact that the law held certain frauds to be\nhanging matters operated on the minds of men in regard to all fraud.\nWhat with the joint-stock working of companies, and the confusion\nbetween directors who know nothing and managers who know everything,\nand the dislike of juries to tread upon people's corns, you can't\npunish dishonest trading. Caveat emptor is the only motto going,\nand the worst proverb that ever came from dishonest stony-hearted\nRome. With such a motto as that to guide us no man dare trust his\nbrother. Caveat lex,--and let the man who cheats cheat at his\nperil.\"\n\n\"You'd give the law a great deal to do.\"\n\n\"Much less than at present. What does your Caveat emptor come to?\nThat every seller tries to pick the eyes out of the head of the\npurchaser. Sooner or later the law must interfere, and Caveat\nemptor falls to the ground. I bought a horse the other day; my\ndaughter wanted something to look pretty, and like an old ass as I am\nI gave a hundred and fifty pounds for the brute. When he came home he\nwasn't worth a feed of corn.\"\n\n\"You had a warranty, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! Did you ever hear of such an old fool?\"\n\n\"I should have thought any dealer would have taken him back for the\nsake of his character.\"\n\n\"Any dealer would; but--I bought him of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass!\"\n\n\"I ought to have known better, oughtn't I? Caveat emptor.\"\n\n\"It was just giving away your money, you know.\"\n\n\"A great deal worse than that. I could have given the--gentleman--a\nhundred and fifty pounds, and not have minded it much. I ought to\nhave had the horse killed, and gone to a dealer for another. Instead\nof that,--I went to an attorney.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Chaffanbrass;--the idea of your going to an attorney.\"\n\n\"I did then. I never had so much honest truth told me in my life.\"\n\n\"By an attorney!\"\n\n\"He said that he did think I'd been born long enough to have known\nbetter than that! I pleaded on my own behalf that the gentleman said\nthe horse was all right. 'Gentleman!' exclaimed my friend. 'You go\nto a gentleman for a horse; you buy a horse from a gentleman without\na warranty; and then you come to me! Didn't you ever hear of Caveat\nemptor, Mr. Chaffanbrass? What can I do for you?' That's what my\nfriend, the attorney, said to me.\"\n\n\"And what came of it, Mr. Chaffanbrass? Arbitration, I should say?\"\n\n\"Just that;--with the horse eating his head off every meal at ever\nso much per week,--till at last I fairly gave in from sheer vexation.\nSo the--gentleman--got my money, and I added something to my stock\nof experience. Of course, that's only my story, and it may be that\nthe gentleman could tell it another way. But I say that if my story\nbe right the doctrine of Caveat emptor does not encourage trade.\nI don't know how we got to all this from Mr. Finn. I'm to see him\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes;--he is very anxious to speak to you.\"\n\n\"What's the use of it, Wickerby? I hate seeing a client.--What comes\nof it?\"\n\n\"Of course he wants to tell his own story.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to hear his own story. What good will his own story\ndo me? He'll tell me either one of two things. He'll swear he didn't\nmurder the man--\"\n\n\"That's what he'll say.\"\n\n\"Which can have no effect upon me one way or the other; or else he'll\nsay that he did,--which would cripple me altogether.\"\n\n\"He won't say that, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"There's no knowing what they'll say. A man will go on swearing by\nhis God that he is innocent, till at last, in a moment of emotion, he\nbreaks down, and out comes the truth. In such a case as this I do not\nin the least want to know the truth about the murder.\"\n\n\"That is what the public wants to know.\"\n\n\"Because the public is ignorant. The public should not wish to know\nanything of the kind. What we should all wish to get at is the truth\nof the evidence about the murder. The man is to be hung not because\nhe committed the murder,--as to which no positive knowledge is\nattainable; but because he has been proved to have committed the\nmurder,--as to which proof, though it be enough for hanging, there\nmust always be attached some shadow of doubt. We were delighted to\nhang Palmer,--but we don't know that he killed Cook. A learned man\nwho knew more about it than we can know seemed to think that he\ndidn't. Now the last man to give us any useful insight into the\nevidence is the prisoner himself. In nineteen cases out of twenty a\nman tried for murder in this country committed the murder for which\nhe is tried.\"\n\n\"There really seems to be a doubt in this case.\"\n\n\"I dare say. If there be only nineteen guilty out of twenty, there\nmust be one innocent; and why not Mr. Phineas Finn? But, if it be so,\nhe, burning with the sense of injustice, thinks that everybody should\nsee it as he sees it. He is to be tried, because, on investigation,\neverybody sees it just in a different light. In such case he is\nunfortunate, but he can't assist me in liberating him from his\nmisfortune. He sees what is patent and clear to him,--that he walked\nhome on that night without meddling with any one. But I can't see\nthat, or make others see it, because he sees it.\"\n\n\"His manner of telling you may do something.\"\n\n\"If it do, Mr. Wickerby, it is because I am unfit for my business.\nIf he have the gift of protesting well, I am to think him innocent;\nand, therefore, to think him guilty, if he be unprovided with such\neloquence! I will neither believe or disbelieve anything that a\nclient says to me,--unless he confess his guilt, in which case my\nservices can be but of little avail. Of course I shall see him, as he\nasks it. We had better meet there,--say at half-past ten.\" Whereupon\nMr. Wickerby wrote to the governor of the prison begging that Phineas\nFinn might be informed of the visit.\n\nPhineas had now been in gaol between six and seven weeks, and the\nvery fact of his incarceration had nearly broken his spirits. Two\nof his sisters, who had come from Ireland to be near him, saw him\nevery day, and his two friends, Mr. Low and Lord Chiltern, were very\nfrequently with him; Lady Laura Kennedy had not come to him again;\nbut he heard from her frequently through Barrington Erle. Lord\nChiltern rarely spoke of his sister,--alluding to her merely in\nconnection with her father and her late husband. Presents still came\nto him from various quarters,--as to which he hardly knew whence they\ncame. But the Duchess and Lady Chiltern and Lady Laura all catered\nfor him,--while Mrs. Bunce looked after his wardrobe, and saw that he\nwas not cut down to prison allowance of clean shirts and socks. But\nthe only friend whom he recognised as such was the friend who would\nfreely declare a conviction of his innocence. They allowed him books\nand pens and paper, and even cards, if he chose to play at Patience\nwith them or build castles. The paper and pens he could use because\nhe could write about himself. From day to day he composed a diary in\nwhich he was never tired of expatiating on the terrible injustice of\nhis position. But he could not read. He found it to be impossible to\nfix his attention on matters outside himself. He assured himself from\nhour to hour that it was not death he feared,--not even death from\nthe hangman's hand. It was the condemnation of those who had known\nhim that was so terrible to him--the feeling that they with whom he\nhad aspired to work and live, the leading men and women of his day,\nMinisters of the Government and their wives, statesmen and their\ndaughters, peers and members of the House in which he himself had\nsat;--that these should think that, after all, he had been a base\nadventurer unworthy of their society! That was the sorrow that broke\nhim down, and drew him to confess that his whole life had been a\nfailure.\n\nMr. Low had advised him not to see Mr. Chaffanbrass;--but he had\npersisted in declaring that there were instructions which no one\nbut himself could give to the counsellor whose duty it would be to\ndefend him at the trial. Mr. Chaffanbrass came at the hour fixed,\nand with him came Mr. Wickerby. The old barrister bowed courteously\nas he entered the prison room, and the attorney introduced the two\ngentlemen with more than all the courtesy of the outer world. \"I am\nsorry to see you here, Mr. Finn,\" said the barrister.\n\n\"It's a bad lodging, Mr. Chaffanbrass, but the term will soon be\nover. I am thinking a good deal more of my next abode.\"\n\n\"It has to be thought of, certainly,\" said the barrister. \"Let us\nhope that it may be all that you would wish it to be. My services\nshall not be wanting to make it so.\"\n\n\"We are doing all we can, Mr. Finn,\" said Mr. Wickerby.\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass,\" said Phineas, \"there is one special thing that\nI want you to do.\" The old man, having his own idea as to what was\ncoming, laid one of his hands over the other, bowed his head, and\nlooked meek. \"I want you to make men believe that I am innocent of\nthis crime.\"\n\nThis was better than Mr. Chaffanbrass expected. \"I trust that we may\nsucceed in making twelve men believe it,\" said he.\n\n\"Comparatively I do not care a straw for the twelve men. It is not to\nthem especially that I am anxious that you should address yourself--\"\n\n\"But that will be my bounden duty, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I can well believe, sir, that though I have myself been bred a\nlawyer, I may not altogether understand the nature of an advocate's\nduty to his client. But I would wish something more to be done than\nwhat you intimate.\"\n\n\"The duty of an advocate defending a prisoner is to get a verdict\nof acquittal if he can, and to use his own discretion in making the\nattempt.\"\n\n\"But I want something more to be attempted, even if in the struggle\nsomething less be achieved. I have known men to be so acquitted that\nevery man in court believed them to be guilty.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--and such men have probably owed much to their advocates.\"\n\n\"It is not such a debt that I wish to owe. I know my own innocence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass takes that for granted,\" said Mr. Wickerby.\n\n\"To me it is a matter of astonishment that any human being should\nbelieve me to have committed this murder. I am lost in surprise when\nI remember that I am here simply because I walked home from my club\nwith a loaded stick in my pocket. The magistrate, I suppose, thought\nme guilty.\"\n\n\"He did not think about it, Mr. Finn. He went by the evidence;--the\nquarrel, your position in the streets at the time, the colour of the\ncoat you wore and that of the coat worn by the man whom Lord Fawn saw\nin the street; the doctor's evidence as to the blows by which the man\nwas killed; and the nature of the weapon which you carried. He put\nthese things together, and they were enough to entitle the public to\ndemand that a jury should decide. He didn't say you were guilty. He\nonly said that the circumstances were sufficient to justify a trial.\"\n\n\"If he thought me innocent he would not have sent me here.\"\n\n\"Yes, he would;--if the evidence required that he should do so.\"\n\n\"We will not argue about that, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"Here I am, and to-morrow I shall be tried for my life. My life will\nbe nothing to me unless it can be made clear to all the world that\nI am innocent. I would be sooner hung for this,--with the certainty\nat my heart that all England on the next day would ring with the\nassurance of my innocence, than be acquitted and afterwards be looked\nupon as a murderer.\" Phineas, when he was thus speaking, had stepped\nout into the middle of the room, and stood with his head thrown\nback, and his right hand forward. Mr. Chaffanbrass, who was himself\nan ugly, dirty old man, who had always piqued himself on being\nindifferent to appearance, found himself struck by the beauty and\ngrace of the man whom he now saw for the first time. And he was\nstruck, too, by his client's eloquence, though he had expressly\ndeclared to the attorney that it was his duty to be superior to any\nsuch influence. \"Oh, Mr. Chaffanbrass, for the love of Heaven, let\nthere be no quibbling.\"\n\n\"We never quibble, I hope, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"No subterfuges, no escaping by a side wind, no advantage taken of\nlittle forms, no objection taken to this and that as though delay\nwould avail us anything.\"\n\n\"Character will go a great way, we hope.\"\n\n\"It should go for nothing. Though no one would speak a word for me,\nstill am I innocent. Of course the truth will be known some day.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"It will certainly be known some day. That it should not be known\nas yet is my misfortune. But in defending me I would have you hurl\ndefiance at my accusers. I had the stick in my pocket,--having\nheretofore been concerned with ruffians in the street. I did quarrel\nwith the man, having been insulted by him at the club. The coat which\nI wore was such as they say. But does that make a murderer of me?\"\n\n\"Somebody did the deed, and that somebody could probably say all that\nyou say.\"\n\n\"No, sir;--he, when he is known, will be found to have been skulking\nin the streets; he will have thrown away his weapon; he will have\nbeen secret in his movements; he will have hidden his face, and have\nbeen a murderer in more than the deed. When they came to me in the\nmorning did it seem to them that I was a murderer? Has my life been\nlike that? They who have really known me cannot believe that I have\nbeen guilty. They who have not known me, and do believe, will live to\nlearn their error.\"\n\nHe then sat down and listened patiently while the old lawyer\ndescribed to him the nature of the case,--wherein lay his danger, and\nwherein what hope there was of safety. There was no evidence against\nhim other than circumstantial evidence, and both judges and jury\nwere wont to be unwilling to accept such, when uncorroborated, as\nsufficient in cases of life and death. Unfortunately, in this case\nthe circumstantial evidence was very strong against him. But, on the\nother hand, his character, as to which men of great mark would speak\nwith enthusiasm, would be made to stand very high. \"I would not have\nit made to stand higher than it is,\" said Phineas. As to the opinion\nof the world afterwards, Mr. Chaffanbrass went on to say, of that he\nmust take his chance. But surely he himself might fight better for it\nliving than any friend could do for him after his death. \"You must\nbelieve me in this, Mr. Finn, that a verdict of acquittal from the\njury is the one object that we must have before us.\"\n\n\"The one object that I shall have before me is the verdict of the\npublic,\" said Phineas. \"I am treated with so much injustice in being\nthought a murderer that they can hardly add anything to it by hanging\nme.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Chaffanbrass left the prison he walked back with Mr.\nWickerby to the attorney's chambers in Hatton Garden, and he lingered\nfor awhile on the Viaduct expressing his opinion of his client. \"He's\nnot a bad fellow, Wickerby.\"\n\n\"A very good sort of fellow, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"I never did,--and I never will,--express an opinion of my own as\nto the guilt or innocence of a client till after the trial is over.\nBut I have sometimes felt as though I would give the blood out of my\nveins to save a man. I never felt in that way more strongly than I do\nnow.\"\n\n\"It'll make me very unhappy, I know, if it goes against him,\" said\nMr. Wickerby.\n\n\"People think that the special branch of the profession into which I\nhave chanced to fall is a very low one,--and I do not know whether,\nif the world were before me again, I would allow myself to drift into\nan exclusive practice in criminal courts.\"\n\n\"Yours has been a very useful life, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"But I often feel,\" continued the barrister, paying no attention to\nthe attorney's last remark, \"that my work touches the heart more\nnearly than does that of gentlemen who have to deal with matters of\nproperty and of high social claims. People think I am savage,--savage\nto witnesses.\"\n\n\"You can frighten a witness, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"It's just the trick of the trade that you learn, as a girl learns\nthe notes of her piano. There's nothing in it. You forget it all the\nnext hour. But when a man has been hung whom you have striven to\nsave, you do remember that. Good-morning, Mr. Wickerby. I'll be there\na little before ten. Perhaps you may have to speak to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL.\n\n\nThe task of seeing an important trial at the Old Bailey is by no\nmeans a pleasant business, unless you be what the denizens of the\nCourt would call \"one of the swells,\"--so as to enjoy the privilege\nof being a benchfellow with the judge on the seat of judgment. And\neven in that case the pleasure is not unalloyed. You have, indeed,\nthe gratification of seeing the man whom all the world has been\ntalking about for the last nine days, face to face; and of being seen\nin a position which causes you to be acknowledged as a man of mark;\nbut the intolerable stenches of the Court and its horrid heat come\nup to you there, no doubt, as powerfully as they fall on those below.\nAnd then the tedium of a prolonged trial, in which the points of\ninterest are apt to be few and far between, grows upon you till you\nbegin to feel that though the Prime Minister who is out should murder\nthe Prime Minister who is in, and all the members of the two Cabinets\nwere to be called in evidence, you would not attend the trial, though\nthe seat of honour next to the judge were accorded to you. Those\nbe-wigged ones, who are the performers, are so insufferably long in\ntheir parts, so arrogant in their bearing,--so it strikes you, though\ndoubtless the fashion of working has been found to be efficient\nfor the purposes they have in hand,--and so uninteresting in their\nrepetition, that you first admire, and then question, and at last\nexecrate the imperturbable patience of the judge, who might, as you\nthink, force the thing through in a quarter of the time without any\ninjury to justice. And it will probably strike you that the length\nof the trial is proportioned not to the complicity but to the\nimportance, or rather to the public interest, of the case,--so\nthat the trial which has been suggested of a disappointed and\nbloody-minded ex-Prime Minister would certainly take at least a\nfortnight, even though the Speaker of the House of Commons and the\nLord Chancellor had seen the blow struck, whereas a collier may knock\nhis wife's brains out in the dark and be sent to the gallows with\na trial that shall not last three hours. And yet the collier has\nto be hung,--if found guilty,--and no one thinks that his life is\nimproperly endangered by reckless haste. Whether lives may not be\nimproperly saved by the more lengthened process is another question.\n\nBut the honours of such benchfellowship can be accorded but to few,\nand the task becomes very tiresome when the spectator has to enter\nthe Court as an ordinary mortal. There are two modes open to him,\neither of which is subject to grievous penalties. If he be the\npossessor of a decent coat and hat, and can scrape any acquaintance\nwith any one concerned, he may get introduced to that overworked and\ngreatly perplexed official, the under-sheriff, who will stave him off\nif possible,--knowing that even an under-sheriff cannot make space\nelastic,--but, if the introduction has been acknowledged as good,\nwill probably find a seat for him if he persevere to the end. But\nthe seat when obtained must be kept in possession from morning to\nevening, and the fight must be renewed from day to day. And the\nbenches are hard, and the space is narrow, and you feel that the\nunder-sheriff would prod you with his sword if you ventured to\nsneeze, or to put to your lips the flask which you have in your\npocket. And then, when all the benchfellows go out to lunch at\nhalf-past one, and you are left to eat your dry sandwich without room\nfor your elbows, a feeling of unsatisfied ambition will pervade you.\nIt is all very well to be the friend of an under-sheriff, but if you\ncould but have known the judge, or have been a cousin of the real\nsheriff, how different it might have been with you!\n\nBut you may be altogether independent, and, as a matter of right,\nwalk into an open English court of law as one of the British public.\nYou will have to stand of course,--and to commence standing very\nearly in the morning if you intend to succeed in witnessing any\nportion of the performance. And when you have made once good your\nentrance as one of the British public, you are apt to be a good\ndeal knocked about, not only by your public brethren, but also by\nthose who have to keep the avenues free for witnesses, and who will\nregard you from first to last as a disagreeable excrescence on the\nofficialities of the work on hand. Upon the whole it may be better\nfor you, perhaps, to stay at home and read the record of the affair\nas given in the next day's Times. Impartial reporters, judicious\nreaders, and able editors between them will preserve for you all the\nkernel, and will save you from the necessity of having to deal with\nthe shell.\n\nAt this trial there were among the crowd who succeeded in entering\nthe Court three persons of our acquaintance who had resolved to\novercome the various difficulties. Mr. Monk, who had formerly been\na Cabinet Minister, was seated on the bench,--subject, indeed, to\nthe heat and stenches, but priviledged to eat the lunch. Mr. Quintus\nSlide, of The People's Banner,--who knew the Court well, for in\nformer days he had worked many an hour in it as a reporter,--had\nobtained the good graces of the under-sheriff. And Mr. Bunce, with\nall the energy of the British public, had forced his way in among the\ncrowd, and had managed to wedge himself near to the dock, so that he\nmight be able by a hoist of the neck to see his lodger as he stood\nat the bar. Of these three men, Bunce was assured that the prisoner\nwas innocent,--led to such assurance partly by belief in the man,\nand partly by an innate spirit of opposition to all exercise of\nrestrictive power. Mr. Quintus Slide was certain of the prisoner's\nguilt, and gave himself considerable credit for having assisted in\nrunning down the criminal. It seemed to be natural to Mr. Quintus\nSlide that a man who had openly quarrelled with the Editor of The\nPeople's Banner should come to the gallows. Mr. Monk, as Phineas\nhimself well knew, had doubted. He had received the suspected\nmurderer into his warmest friendship, and was made miserable even\nby his doubts. Since the circumstances of the case had come to his\nknowledge, they had weighed upon his mind so as to sadden his whole\nlife. But he was a man who could not make his reason subordinate to\nhis feelings. If the evidence against his friend was strong enough\nto send his friend for trial, how should he dare to discredit the\nevidence because the man was his friend? He had visited Phineas in\nprison, and Phineas had accused him of doubting. \"You need not answer\nme,\" the unhappy man had said, \"but do not come unless you are able\nto tell me from your heart that you are sure of my innocence. There\nis no person living who could comfort me by such assurance as you\ncould do.\" Mr. Monk had thought about it very much, but he had not\nrepeated his visit.\n\nAt a quarter past ten the Chief Justice was on the bench, with a\nsecond judge to help him, and with lords and distinguished commoners\nand great City magnates crowding the long seat between him and the\ndoorway; the Court was full, so that you would say that another\nhead could not be made to appear; and Phineas Finn, the member\nfor Tankerville, was in the dock. Barrington Erle, who was there\nto see,--as one of the great ones, of course,--told the Duchess\nof Omnium that night that Phineas was thin and pale, and in many\nrespects an altered man,--but handsomer than ever.\n\n\"He bore himself well?\" asked the Duchess.\n\n\"Very well,--very well indeed. We were there for six hours, and he\nmaintained the same demeanour throughout. He never spoke but once,\nand that was when Chaffanbrass began his fight about the jury.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He addressed the judge, interrupting Slope, who was arguing that\nsome man would make a very good juryman, and declared that it was not\nby his wish that any objection was raised against any gentleman.\"\n\n\"What did the judge say?\"\n\n\"Told him to abide by his counsel. The Chief Justice was very civil\nto him,--indeed better than civil.\"\n\n\"We'll have him down to Matching, and make ever so much of him,\" said\nthe Duchess.\n\n\"Don't go too fast, Duchess, for he may have to hang poor Phineas\nyet.\"\n\n\"Oh dear; I wish you wouldn't use that word. But what did he say?\"\n\n\"He told Finn that as he had thought fit to employ counsel for his\ndefence,--in doing which he had undoubtedly acted wisely,--he must\nleave the case to the discretion of his counsel.\"\n\n\"And then poor Phineas was silenced?\"\n\n\"He spoke another word. 'My lord,' said he, 'I for my part wish\nthat the first twelve men on the list might be taken.' But old\nChaffanbrass went on just the same. It took them two hours and a half\nbefore they could swear a jury.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Erle,--taking it altogether,--which way is it going?\"\n\n\"Nobody can even guess as yet. There was ever so much delay besides\nthat about the jury. It seemed that somebody had called him Phinees\ninstead of Phineas, and that took half an hour. They begin with the\nquarrel at the club, and are to call the first witness to-morrow\nmorning. They are to examine Ratler about the quarrel, and\nFitzgibbon, and Monk, and, I believe, old Bouncer, the man who\nwrites, you know. They all heard what took place.\"\n\n\"So did you?\"\n\n\"I have managed to escape that. They can't very well examine all the\nclub. But I shall be called afterwards as to what took place at the\ndoor. They will begin with Ratler.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows there was a quarrel, and that Mr. Bonteen had been\ndrinking, and that he behaved as badly as a man could behave.\"\n\n\"It must all be proved, Duchess.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Erle. If,--if,--if this ends badly for\nMr. Finn I'll wear mourning to the day of my death. I'll go to the\nDrawing Room in mourning, to show what I think of it.\"\n\nLord Chiltern, who was also on the bench, took his account of the\ntrial home to his wife and sister in Portman Square. At this time\nMiss Palliser was staying with them, and the three ladies were\ntogether when the account was brought to them. In that house it was\ntaken as doctrine that Phineas Finn was innocent. In the presence of\nher brother, and before her sister-in-law's visitor, Lady Laura had\nlearned to be silent on the subject, and she now contented herself\nwith listening, knowing that she could relieve herself by speech\nwhen alone with Lady Chiltern. \"I never knew anything so tedious in\nmy life,\" said the Master of the Brake hounds. \"They have not done\nanything yet.\"\n\n\"I suppose they have made their speeches?\" said his wife.\n\n\"Sir Gregory Grogram opened the case, as they call it; and a very\nstrong case he made of it. I never believe anything that a lawyer\nsays when he has a wig on his head and a fee in his hand. I prepare\nmyself beforehand to regard it all as mere words, supplied at so much\nthe thousand. I know he'll say whatever he thinks most likely to\nforward his own views. But upon my word he put it very strongly. He\nbrought it all within so very short a space of time! Bonteen and Finn\nleft the club within a minute of each other. Bonteen must have been\nat the top of the passage five minutes afterwards, and Phineas at\nthat moment could not have been above two hundred yards from him.\nThere can be no doubt of that.\"\n\n\"Oswald, you don't mean to say that it's going against him!\"\nexclaimed Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"It's not going any way at present. The witnesses have not been\nexamined. But so far, I suppose, the Attorney-General was right. He\nhas got to prove it all, but so much no doubt he can prove. He can\nprove that the man was killed with some blunt weapon, such as Finn\nhad. And he can prove that exactly at the same time a man was running\nto the spot very like to Finn, and that by a route which would not\nhave been his route, but by using which he could have placed himself\nat that moment where the man was seen.\"\n\n\"How very dreadful!\" said Miss Palliser.\n\n\"And yet I feel that I know it was that other man,\" said Lady\nChiltern. Lady Laura sat silent through it all, listening with her\neyes intent on her brother's face, with her elbow on the table and\nher brow on her hand. She did not speak a word till she found herself\nalone with her sister-in-law, and then it was hardly more than a\nword. \"Violet, they will murder him!\" Lady Chiltern endeavoured to\ncomfort her, telling her that as yet they had heard but one side of\nthe case; but the wretched woman only shook her head. \"I know they\nwill murder him,\" she said, \"and then when it is too late they will\nfind out what they have done!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Violet, they will murder him.\"]\n\n\nOn the following day the crowd in Court was if possible greater, so\nthat the benchfellows were very much squeezed indeed. But it was\nimpossible to exclude from the high seat such men as Mr. Ratler and\nLord Fawn when they were required in the Court as witnesses;--and\nnot a man who had obtained a seat on the first day was willing to be\nexcluded on the second. And even then the witnesses were not called\nat once. Sir Gregory Grogram began the work of the day by saying\nthat he had heard that morning for the first time that one of\nhis witnesses had been,--\"tampered with\" was the word that he\nunfortunately used,--by his learned friend on the other side. He\nalluded, of course, to Lord Fawn, and poor Lord Fawn, sitting up\nthere on the seat of honour, visible to all the world, became very\nhot and very uncomfortable. Then there arose a vehement dispute\nbetween Sir Gregory, assisted by Sir Simon, and old Mr. Chaffanbrass,\nwho rejected with disdain any assistance from the gentler men who\nwere with him. \"Tampered with! That word should be recalled by the\nhonourable gentleman who was at the head of the bar, or--or--\" Had\nMr. Chaffanbrass declared that as an alternative he would pull the\nCourt about their ears, it would have been no more than he meant.\nLord Fawn had been invited,--not summoned to attend; and why? In\norder that no suspicion of guilt might be thrown on another man,\nunless the knowledge that was in Lord Fawn's bosom, and there alone,\nwould justify such a line of defence. Lord Fawn had been attended by\nhis own solicitor, and might have brought the Attorney-General with\nhim had he so pleased. There was a great deal said on both sides, and\nsomething said also by the judge. At last Sir Gregory withdrew the\nobjectionable word, and substituted in lieu of it an assertion that\nhis witness had been \"indiscreetly questioned.\" Mr. Chaffanbrass\nwould not for a moment admit the indiscretion, but bounced about in\nhis place, tearing his wig almost off his head, and defying every one\nin the Court. The judge submitted to Mr. Chaffanbrass that he had\nbeen indiscreet.--\"I never contradicted the Bench yet, my lord,\" said\nMr. Chaffanbrass,--at which there was a general titter throughout the\nbar,--\"but I must claim the privilege of conducting my own practice\naccording to my own views. In this Court I am subject to the Bench.\nIn my own chamber I am subject only to the law of the land.\" The\njudge looking over his spectacles said a mild word about the\nprofession at large. Mr. Chaffanbrass, twisting his wig quite on\none side, so that it nearly fell on Mr. Serjeant Birdbolt's face,\nmuttered something as to having seen more work done in that Court\nthan any other living lawyer, let his rank be what it might. When\nthe little affair was over, everybody felt that Sir Gregory had been\nvanquished.\n\nMr. Ratler, and Laurence Fitzgibbon, and Mr. Monk, and Mr. Bouncer\nwere examined about the quarrel at the club, and proved that the\nquarrel had been a very bitter quarrel. They all agreed that Mr.\nBonteen had been wrong, and that the prisoner had had cause for\nanger. Of the three distinguished legislators and statesmen above\nnamed Mr. Chaffanbrass refused to take the slightest notice. \"I have\nno question to put to you,\" he said to Mr. Ratler. \"Of course there\nwas a quarrel. We all know that.\" But he did ask a question or two of\nMr. Bouncer. \"You write books, I think, Mr. Bouncer?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Mr. Bouncer, with dignity. Now there was no peculiarity\nin a witness to which Mr. Chaffanbrass was so much opposed as an\nassumption of dignity.\n\n\"What sort of books, Mr. Bouncer?\"\n\n\"I write novels,\" said Mr. Bouncer, feeling that Mr. Chaffanbrass\nmust have been ignorant indeed of the polite literature of the day to\nmake such a question necessary.\n\n\"You mean fiction.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; fiction,--if you like that word better.\"\n\n\"I don't like either, particularly. You have to find plots, haven't\nyou?\"\n\nMr. Bouncer paused a moment. \"Yes; yes,\" he said. \"In writing a novel\nit is necessary to construct a plot.\"\n\n\"Where do you get 'em from?\"\n\n\"Where do I get 'em from?\"\n\n\"Yes,--where do you find them? You take them from the French\nmostly;--don't you?\" Mr. Bouncer became very red. \"Isn't that the way\nour English writers get their plots?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,--perhaps.\"\n\n\"Your's ain't French then?\"\n\n\"Well;--no;--that is--I won't undertake to say that--that--\"\n\n\"You won't undertake to say that they're not French.\"\n\n\"Is this relevant to the case before us, Mr. Chaffanbrass?\" asked the\njudge.\n\n\"Quite so, my lud. We have a highly-distinguished novelist before us,\nmy lud, who, as I have reason to believe, is intimately acquainted\nwith the French system of the construction of plots. It is a business\nwhich the French carry to perfection. The plot of a novel should, I\nimagine, be constructed in accordance with human nature?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mr. Bouncer.\n\n\"You have murders in novels?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Mr. Bouncer, who had himself done many murders in\nhis time.\n\n\"Did you ever know a French novelist have a premeditated murder\ncommitted by a man who could not possibly have conceived the murder\nten minutes before he committed it;--with whom the cause of the\nmurder anteceded the murder no more than ten minutes?\" Mr. Bouncer\nstood thinking for a while. \"We will give you your time, because an\nanswer to the question from you will be important testimony.\"\n\n\"I don't think I do,\" said Mr. Bouncer, who in his confusion had been\nquite unable to think of the plot of a single novel.\n\n\"And if there were such a French plot that would not be the plot that\nyou would borrow?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Bouncer.\n\n\"Did you ever read poetry, Mr. Bouncer?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--I read a great deal of poetry.\"\n\n\"Shakespeare, perhaps?\" Mr. Bouncer did not condescend to do more\nthan nod his head. \"There is a murder described in _Hamlet_. Was that\nsupposed by the poet to have been devised suddenly?\"\n\n\"I should say not.\"\n\n\"So should I, Mr. Bouncer. Do you remember the arrangements for the\nmurder in _Macbeth_? That took a little time in concocting;--didn't\nit?\"\n\n\"No doubt it did.\"\n\n\"And when Othello murdered Desdemona, creeping up to her in her\nsleep, he had been thinking of it for some time?\"\n\n\"I suppose he had.\"\n\n\"Do you ever read English novels as well as French, Mr. Bouncer?\" The\nunfortunate author again nodded his head. \"When Amy Robsart was lured\nto her death, there was some time given to the preparation,--eh?\"\n\n\"Of course there was.\"\n\n\"Of course there was. And Eugene Aram, when he murdered a man in\nBulwer's novel, turned the matter over in his mind before he did it?\"\n\n\"He was thinking a long time about it, I believe.\"\n\n\"Thinking about it a long time! I rather think he was. Those great\nmasters of human nature, those men who knew the human heart, did not\nventure to describe a secret murder as coming from a man's brain\nwithout premeditation?\"\n\n\"Not that I can remember.\"\n\n\"Such also is my impression. But now, I bethink me of a murder that\nwas almost as sudden as this is supposed to have been. Didn't a Dutch\nsmuggler murder a Scotch lawyer, all in a moment as it were?\"\n\n\"Dirk Hatteraick did murder Glossop in _The Antiquary_ very\nsuddenly;--but he did it from passion.\"\n\n\"Just so, Mr. Bouncer. There was no plot there, was there? No\narrangement; no secret creeping up to his victim; no escape even?\"\n\n\"He was chained.\"\n\n\"So he was; chained like a dog;--and like a dog he flew at his enemy.\nIf I understand you, then, Mr. Bouncer, you would not dare so to\nviolate probability in a novel, as to produce a murderer to the\npublic who should contrive a secret hidden murder,--contrive it and\nexecute it, all within a quarter of an hour?\"\n\nMr. Bouncer, after another minute's consideration, said that he\nthought he would not do so. \"Mr. Bouncer,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass,\n\"I am uncommonly obliged to our excellent friend, Sir Gregory, for\nhaving given us the advantage of your evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nLORD FAWN'S EVIDENCE.\n\n\nA crowd of witnesses were heard on the second day after Mr.\nChaffanbrass had done with Mr. Bouncer, but none of them were of much\ninterest to the public. The three doctors were examined as to the\nstate of the dead man's head when he was picked up, and as to the\nnature of the instrument with which he had probably been killed; and\nthe fact of Phineas Finn's life-preserver was proved,--in the middle\nof which he begged that the Court would save itself some little\ntrouble, as he was quite ready to acknowledge that he had walked\nhome with the short bludgeon, which was then produced, in his pocket.\n\"We would acknowledge a great deal if they would let us,\" said Mr.\nChaffanbrass. \"We acknowledge the quarrel, we acknowledge the walk\nhome at night, we acknowledge the bludgeon, and we acknowledge a grey\ncoat.\" But that happened towards the close of the second day, and\nthey had not then reached the grey coat. The question of the grey\ncoat was commenced on the third morning,--on the Saturday,--which\nday, as was well known, would be opened with the examination of\nLord Fawn. The anxiety to hear Lord Fawn undergo his penance was\nintense, and had been greatly increased by the conviction that\nMr. Chaffanbrass would resent upon him the charge made by the\nAttorney-General as to tampering with a witness. \"I'll tamper with\nhim by-and-bye,\" Mr. Chaffanbrass had whispered to Mr. Wickerby, and\nthe whispered threat had been spread abroad. On the table before Mr.\nChaffanbrass, when he took his place in the Court on the Saturday,\nwas laid a heavy grey coat, and on the opposite side of the table,\njust before the Solicitor-General, was laid another grey coat, of\nmuch lighter material. When Lord Fawn saw the two coats as he took\nhis seat on the bench his heart failed him.\n\nHe was hardly allowed to seat himself before he was called upon to be\nsworn. Sir Simon Slope, who was to examine him, took it for granted\nthat his lordship could give his evidence from his place on the\nbench, but to this Mr. Chaffanbrass objected. He was very well aware,\nhe said, that such a practice was usual. He did not doubt but that in\nhis time he had examined some hundreds of witnesses from the bench.\nIn nineteen cases out of twenty there could be no objection to such a\npractice. But in this case the noble lord would have to give evidence\nnot only as to what he had seen, but as to what he then saw. It would\nbe expedient that he should see colours as nearly as possible in\nthe same light as the jury, which he would do if he stood in the\nwitness-box. And there might arise questions of identity, in speaking\nof which it would be well that the noble lord should be as near as\npossible to the thing or person to be identified. He was afraid that\nhe must trouble the noble lord to come down from the Elysium of\nthe bench. Whereupon Lord Fawn descended, and was sworn in at the\nwitness-box.\n\nHis treatment from Sir Simon Slope was all that was due from a\nSolicitor-General to a distinguished peer who was a member of\nthe same Government as himself. Sir Simon put his questions so\nas almost to reassure the witness; and very quickly,--only too\nquickly,--obtained from him all the information that was needed on\nthe side of the prosecution. Lord Fawn, when he had left the club,\nhad seen both Mr. Bonteen and Mr. Finn preparing to follow him, but\nhe had gone alone, and had never seen Mr. Bonteen since. He walked\nvery slowly down into Curzon Street and Bolton Row, and when there,\nas he was about to cross the road at the top of Clarges Street,--as\nhe believed, just as he was crossing the street,--he saw a man come\nat a very fast pace out of the mews which runs into Bolton Row,\nopposite to Clarges Street, and from thence hurry very quickly\ntowards the passage which separates the gardens of Devonshire and\nLansdowne Houses. It had already been proved that had Phineas Finn\nretraced his steps after Erle and Fitzgibbon had turned their backs\nupon him, his shortest and certainly most private way to the spot\non which Lord Fawn had seen the man would have been by the mews in\nquestion. Lord Fawn went on to say that the man wore a grey coat,--as\nfar as he could judge it was such a coat as Sir Simon now showed him;\nhe could not at all identify the prisoner; he could not say whether\nthe man he had seen was as tall as the prisoner; he thought that as\nfar as he could judge, there was not much difference in the height.\nHe had not thought of Mr. Finn when he saw the man hurrying along,\nnor had he troubled his mind about the man. That was the end of Lord\nFawn's evidence-in-chief, which he would gladly have prolonged to the\nclose of the day could he thereby have postponed the coming horrors\nof his cross-examination. But there he was,--in the clutches of\nthe odious, dirty, little man, hating the little man, despising\nhim because he was dirty, and nothing better than an Old Bailey\nbarrister,--and yet fearing him with so intense a fear!\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass smiled at his victim, and for a moment was quite\nsoft with him,--as a cat is soft with a mouse. The reporters\ncould hardly hear his first question,--\"I believe you are an\nUnder-Secretary of State?\" Lord Fawn acknowledged the fact. Now it\nwas the case that in the palmy days of our hero's former career he\nhad filled the very office which Lord Fawn now occupied, and that\nLord Fawn had at the time filled a similar position in another\ndepartment. These facts Mr. Chaffanbrass extracted from his\nwitness,--not without an appearance of unwillingness, which was\nproduced, however, altogether by the natural antagonism of the\nvictim to his persecutor; for Mr. Chaffanbrass, even when asking the\nsimplest questions, in the simplest words, even when abstaining from\nthat sarcasm of tone under which witnesses were wont to feel that\nthey were being flayed alive, could so look at a man as to create an\nantagonism which no witness could conceal. In asking a man his name,\nand age, and calling, he could produce an impression that the man\nwas unwilling to tell anything, and that, therefore, the jury were\nentitled to regard his evidence with suspicion. \"Then,\" continued Mr.\nChaffanbrass, \"you must have met him frequently in the intercourse of\nyour business?\"\n\n\"I suppose I did,--sometimes.\"\n\n\"Sometimes? You belonged to the same party?\"\n\n\"We didn't sit in the same House.\"\n\n\"I know that, my lord. I know very well what House you sat in. But\nI suppose you would condescend to be acquainted with even a commoner\nwho held the very office which you hold now. You belonged to the same\nclub with him.\"\n\n\"I don't go much to the clubs,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"But the quarrel of which we have heard so much took place at a\nclub in your presence?\" Lord Fawn assented. \"In fact you cannot but\nhave been intimately and accurately acquainted with the personal\nappearance of the gentleman who is now on his trial. Is that so?\"\n\n\"I never was intimate with him.\"\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass looked up at the jury and shook his head sadly.\n\"I am not presuming, Lord Fawn, that you so far derogated as to be\nintimate with this gentleman,--as to whom, however, I shall be able\nto show by and by that he was the chosen friend of the very man under\nwhose mastership you now serve. I ask whether his appearance is not\nfamiliar to you?\" Lord Fawn at last said that it was. \"Do you know\nhis height? What should you say was his height?\" Lord Fawn altogether\nrefused to give an opinion on such a subject, but acknowledged that\nhe should not be surprised if he were told that Mr. Finn was over six\nfeet high. \"In fact you consider him a tall man, my lord? There he\nis, you can look at him. Is he a tall man?\" Lord Fawn did look, but\nwouldn't give an answer. \"I'll undertake to say, my lord, that there\nisn't a person in the Court at this moment, except yourself, who\nwouldn't be ready to express an opinion on his oath that Mr. Finn is\na tall man. Mr. Chief Constable, just let the prisoner step out from\nthe dock for a moment. He won't run away. I must have his lordship's\nopinion as to Mr. Finn's height.\" Poor Phineas, when this was said,\nclutched hold of the front of the dock, as though determined that\nnothing but main force should make him exhibit himself to the Court\nin the manner proposed.\n\nBut the need for exhibition passed away. \"I know that he is a very\ntall man,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"You know that he is a very tall man. We all know it. There can be\nno doubt about it. He is, as you say, a very tall man,--with whose\npersonal appearance you have long been familiar? I ask again, my\nlord, whether you have not been long familiar with his personal\nappearance?\" After some further agonising delay Lord Fawn at last\nacknowledged that it had been so. \"Now we shall get on like a house\non fire,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\nBut still the house did not burn very quickly. A string of questions\nwas then asked as to the attitude of the man who had been seen coming\nout of the mews wearing a grey great coat,--as to his attitude, and\nas to his general likeness to Phineas Finn. In answer to these Lord\nFawn would only say that he had not observed the man's attitude,\nand had certainly not thought of the prisoner when he saw the man.\n\"My lord,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass, very solemnly, \"look at your late\nfriend and colleague, and remember that his life depends probably on\nthe accuracy of your memory. The man you saw--murdered Mr. Bonteen.\nWith all my experience in such matters,--which is great; and with all\nmy skill,--which is something, I cannot stand against that fact. It\nis for me to show that that man and my client were not one and the\nsame person, and I must do so by means of your evidence,--by sifting\nwhat you say to-day, and by comparing it with what you have already\nsaid on other occasions. I understand you now to say that there is\nnothing in your remembrance of the man you saw, independently of the\ncolour of the coat, to guide you to an opinion whether that man was\nor was not one and the same with the prisoner?\"\n\nIn all the crowd then assembled there was no man more thoroughly\nunder the influence of conscience as to his conduct than was Lord\nFawn in reference to the evidence which he was called upon to give.\nNot only would the idea of endangering the life of a human being have\nbeen horrible to him, but the sanctity of an oath was imperative to\nhim. He was essentially a truth-speaking man, if only he knew how\nto speak the truth. He would have sacrificed much to establish the\ninnocence of Phineas Finn,--not for the love of Phineas, but for\nthe love of innocence;--but not even to do that would he have lied.\nBut he was a bad witness, and by his slowness, and by a certain\nunsustained pomposity which was natural to him, had already taught\nthe jury to think that he was anxious to convict the prisoner. Two\nmen in the Court, and two only, thoroughly understood his condition.\nMr. Chaffanbrass saw it all, and intended without the slightest\nscruple to take advantage of it. And the Chief Justice saw it all,\nand was already resolving how he could set the witness right with the\njury.\n\n\"I didn't think of Mr. Finn at the time,\" said Lord Fawn in answer to\nthe last question.\n\n\"So I understand. The man didn't strike you as being tall.\"\n\n\"I don't think that he did.\"\n\n\"But yet in the evidence you gave before the magistrate in Bow Street\nI think you expressed a very strong opinion that the man you saw\nrunning out of the mews was Mr. Finn?\" Lord Fawn was again silent. \"I\nam asking your lordship a question to which I must request an answer.\nHere is the Times report of the examination, with which you can\nrefresh your memory, and you are of course aware that it was mainly\non your evidence as here reported that my client stands there in\njeopardy of his life.\"\n\n\"I am not aware of anything of the kind,\" said the witness.\n\n\"Very well. We will drop that then. But such was your evidence,\nwhether important or not important. Of course your lordship can take\nwhat time you please for recollection.\"\n\nLord Fawn tried very hard to recollect, but would not look at the\nnewspaper which had been handed to him. \"I cannot remember what words\nI used. It seems to me that I thought it must have been Mr. Finn\nbecause I had been told that Mr. Finn could have been there by\nrunning round.\"\n\n\"Surely, my lord, that would not have sufficed to induce you to give\nsuch evidence as is there reported?\"\n\n\"And the colour of the coat,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"In fact you went by the colour of the coat, and that only?\"\n\n\"Then there had been the quarrel.\"\n\n\"My lord, is not that begging the question? Mr. Bonteen quarrelled\nwith Mr. Finn. Mr. Bonteen was murdered by a man,--as we all\nbelieve,--whom you saw at a certain spot. Therefore you identified\nthe man whom you saw as Mr. Finn. Was that so?\"\n\n\"I didn't identify him.\"\n\n\"At any rate you do not do so now? Putting aside the grey coat there\nis nothing to make you now think that that man and Mr. Finn were one\nand the same? Come, my lord, on behalf of that man's life, which is\nin great jeopardy,--is in great jeopardy because of the evidence\ngiven by you before the magistrate,--do not be ashamed to speak the\ntruth openly, though it be at variance with what you may have said\nbefore with ill-advised haste.\"\n\n\"My lord, is it proper that I should be treated in this way?\" said\nthe witness, appealing to the Bench.\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass,\" said the judge, again looking at the barrister\nover his spectacles, \"I think you are stretching the privilege of\nyour position too far.\"\n\n\"I shall have to stretch it further yet, my lord. His lordship in his\nevidence before the magistrate gave on his oath a decided opinion\nthat the man he saw was Mr. Finn;--and on that evidence Mr. Finn was\ncommitted for murder. Let him say openly, now, to the jury,--when Mr.\nFinn is on his trial for his life before the Court, and for all his\nhopes in life before the country,--whether he thinks as then he\nthought, and on what grounds he thinks so.\"\n\n\"I think so because of the quarrel, and because of the grey coat.\"\n\n\"For no other reasons?\"\n\n\"No;--for no other reasons.\"\n\n\"Your only ground for suggesting identity is the grey coat?\"\n\n\"And the quarrel,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"My lord, in giving evidence as to identity, I fear that you do not\nunderstand the meaning of the word.\" Lord Fawn looked up at the\njudge, but the judge on this occasion said nothing. \"At any rate we\nhave it from you at present that there was nothing in the appearance\nof the man you saw like to that of Mr. Finn except the colour of the\ncoat.\"\n\n\"I don't think there was,\" said Lord Fawn, slowly.\n\nThen there occurred a scene in the Court which no doubt was\ngratifying to the spectators, and may in part have repaid them for\nthe weariness of the whole proceeding. Mr. Chaffanbrass, while Lord\nFawn was still in the witness-box, requested permission for a certain\nman to stand forward, and put on the coat which was lying on the\ntable before him,--this coat being in truth the identical garment\nwhich Mr. Meager had brought home with him on the morning of the\nmurder. This man was Mr. Wickerby's clerk, Mr. Scruby, and he put on\nthe coat,--which seemed to fit him well. Mr. Chaffanbrass then asked\npermission to examine Mr. Scruby, explaining that much time might be\nsaved, and declaring that he had but one question to ask him. After\nsome difficulty this permission was given him, and Mr. Scruby was\nasked his height. Mr. Scruby was five feet eight inches, and had\nbeen accurately measured on the previous day with reference to the\nquestion. Then the examination of Lord Fawn was resumed, and Mr.\nChaffanbrass referred to that very irregular interview to which he\nhad so improperly enticed the witness in Mr. Wickerby's chambers. For\na long time Sir Gregory Grogram declared that he would not permit any\nallusion to what had taken place at a most improper conference,--a\nconference which he could not stigmatize in sufficiently strong\nlanguage. But Mr. Chaffanbrass, smiling blandly,--smiling very\nblandly for him,--suggested that the impropriety of the conference,\nlet it have been ever so abominable, did not prevent the fact of the\nconference, and that he was manifestly within his right in alluding\nto it. \"Suppose, my lord, that Lord Fawn had confessed in Mr.\nWickerby's chambers that he had murdered Mr. Bonteen himself, and\nhad since repented of that confession, would Mr. Camperdown and Mr.\nWickerby, who were present, and would I, be now debarred from stating\nthat confession in evidence, because, in deference to some fanciful\nrules of etiquette, Lord Fawn should not have been there?\" Mr.\nChaffanbrass at last prevailed, and the evidence was resumed.\n\n\"You saw Mr. Scruby wear that coat in Mr. Wickerby's chambers.\" Lord\nFawn said that he could not identify the coat. \"We'll take care to\nhave it identified. We shall get a great deal out of that coat yet.\nYou saw that man wear a coat like that.\"\n\n\"Yes; I did.\"\n\n\"And you see him now.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Does he remind you of the figure of the man you saw come out of the\nmews?\" Lord Fawn paused. \"We can't make him move about here as we did\nin Mr. Wickerby's room; but remembering that as you must do, does he\nlook like the man?\"\n\n\"I don't remember what the man looked like.\"\n\n\"Did you not tell us in Mr. Wickerby's room that Mr. Scruby with the\ngrey coat on was like the figure of the man?\"\n\nQuestions of this nature were prolonged for near half an hour, during\nwhich Sir Gregory made more than one attempt to defend his witness\nfrom the weapons of their joint enemies; but Lord Fawn at last\nadmitted that he had acknowledged the resemblance, and did, in some\nfaint ambiguous fashion, acknowledge it in his present evidence.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass as he allowed Lord Fawn to go down,\n\"you have no doubt taken a note of Mr. Scruby's height.\" Whereupon\nthe judge nodded his head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nMR. CHAFFANBRASS FOR THE DEFENCE.\n\n\nThe case for the prosecution was completed on the Saturday evening,\nMrs. Bunce having been examined as the last witness on that side.\nShe was only called upon to say that her lodger had been in the\nhabit of letting himself in and out of her house at all hours with\na latch-key;--but she insisted on saying more, and told the judge\nand the jury and the barristers that if they thought that Mr. Finn\nhad murdered anybody they didn't know anything about the world in\ngeneral. Whereupon Mr. Chaffanbrass said that he would like to ask\nher a question or two, and with consummate flattery extracted from\nher her opinion of her lodger. She had known him for years, and\nthought that, of all the gentlemen that ever were born, he was the\nleast likely to do such a bloody-minded action. Mr. Chaffanbrass was,\nperhaps, right in thinking that her evidence might be as serviceable\nas that of the lords and countesses.\n\nDuring the Sunday the trial was, as a matter of course, the talk\nof the town. Poor Lord Fawn shut himself up, and was seen by no\none;--but his conduct and evidence were discussed everywhere. At\nthe clubs it was thought that he had escaped as well as could be\nexpected; but he himself felt that he had been disgraced for ever.\nThere was a very common opinion that Mr. Chaffanbrass had admitted\ntoo much when he had declared that the man whom Lord Fawn had seen\nwas doubtless the murderer. To the minds of men generally it seemed\nto be less evident that the man so seen should have done the deed,\nthan that Phineas Finn should have been that man. Was it probable\nthat there should be two men going about in grey coats, in exactly\nthe same vicinity, and at exactly the same hour of the night? And\nthen the evidence which Lord Fawn had given before the magistrates\nwas to the world at large at any rate as convincing as that given in\nthe Court. The jury would, of course, be instructed to regard only\nthe latter; whereas the general public would naturally be guided by\nthe two combined. At the club it was certainly believed that the case\nwas going against the prisoner.\n\n\"You have read it all, of course,\" said the Duchess of Omnium to her\nhusband, as she sat with the Observer in her hand on that Sunday\nmorning. The Sunday papers were full of the report, and were enjoying\na very extended circulation.\n\n\"I wish you would not think so much about it,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"That's very easily said, but how is one to help thinking about it?\nOf course I am thinking about it. You know all about the coat. It\nbelonged to the man where Mealyus was lodging.\"\n\n\"I will not talk about the coat, Glencora. If Mr. Finn did commit the\nmurder it is right that he should be convicted.\"\n\n\"But if he didn't?\"\n\n\"It would be doubly right that he should be acquitted. But the jury\nwill have means of arriving at a conclusion without prejudice, which\nyou and I cannot have; and therefore we should be prepared to take\ntheir verdict as correct.\"\n\n\"If they find him guilty, their verdict will be damnable and false,\"\nsaid the Duchess. Whereupon the Duke turned away in anger, and\nresolved that he would say nothing more about the trial,--which\nresolution, however, he was compelled to break before the trial was\nover.\n\n\"What do you think about it, Mr. Erle?\" asked the other Duke.\n\n\"I don't know what to think;--I only hope.\"\n\n\"That he may be acquitted?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Whether guilty or innocent?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. But if he is acquitted I shall believe him to have been\ninnocent. Your Grace thinks--?\"\n\n\"I am as unwilling to think as you are, Mr. Erle.\" It was thus that\npeople spoke of it. With the exception of some very few, all those\nwho had known Phineas were anxious for an acquittal, though they\ncould not bring themselves to believe that an innocent man had been\nput in peril of his life.\n\nOn the Monday morning the trial was recommenced, and the whole day\nwas taken up by the address which Mr. Chaffanbrass made to the jury.\nHe began by telling them the history of the coat which lay before\nthem, promising to prove by evidence all the details which he stated.\nIt was not his intention, he said, to accuse any one of the murder.\nIt was his business to defend the prisoner, not to accuse others.\nBut, as he should prove to them, two persons had been arrested as\nsoon as the murder had been discovered,--two persons totally unknown\nto each other, and who were never for a moment supposed to have acted\ntogether,--and the suspicion of the police had in the first instance\npointed, not to his client, but to the other man. That other man\nhad also quarrelled with Mr. Bonteen, and that other man was now in\ncustody on a charge of bigamy chiefly through the instrumentality of\nMr. Bonteen, who had been the friend of the victim of the supposed\nbigamist. With the accusation of bigamy they would have nothing to\ndo, but he must ask them to take cognisance of that quarrel as well\nas of the quarrel at the club. He then named that formerly popular\npreacher, the Rev. Mr. Emilius, and explained that he would prove\nthat this man, who had incurred the suspicion of the police in\nthe first instance, had during the night of the murder been so\ncircumstanced as to have been able to use the coat produced. He would\nprove also that Mr. Emilius was of precisely the same height as the\nman whom they had seen wearing the coat. God forbid that he should\nbring an accusation of murder against a man on such slight testimony.\nBut if the evidence, as grounded on the coat, was slight against\nEmilius, how could it prevail at all against his client? The two\ncoats were as different as chalk from cheese, the one being what\nwould be called a gentleman's fashionable walking coat, and the other\nthe wrap-rascal of such a fellow as was Mr. Meager. And yet Lord\nFawn, who attempted to identify the prisoner only by his coat, could\ngive them no opinion as to which was the coat he had seen! But Lord\nFawn, who had found himself to be debarred by his conscience from\nrepeating the opinion he had given before the magistrate as to the\nidentity of Phineas Finn with the man he had seen, did tell them that\nthe figure of that man was similar to the figure of him who had worn\nthe coat on Saturday in presence of them all. This man in the street\nhad therefore been like Mr. Emilius, and could not in the least\nhave resembled the prisoner. Mr. Chaffanbrass would not tell the\njury that this point bore strongly against Mr. Emilius, but he took\nupon himself to assert that it was quite sufficient to snap asunder\nthe thin thread of circumstantial evidence by which his client was\nconnected with the murder. A great deal more was said about Lord\nFawn, which was not complimentary to that nobleman. \"His lordship is\nan honest, slow man, who has doubtless meant to tell you the truth,\nbut who does not understand the meaning of what he himself says. When\nhe swore before the magistrate that he thought he could identify my\nclient with the man in the street, he really meant that he thought\nthat there must be identity, because he believed from other reasons\nthat Mr. Finn was the man in the street. Mr. Bonteen had been\nmurdered;--according to Lord Fawn's thinking had probably been\nmurdered by Mr. Finn. And it was also probable to him that Mr.\nBonteen had been murdered by the man in the street. He came thus to\nthe conclusion that the prisoner was the man in the street. In fact,\nas far as the process of identifying is concerned, his lordship's\nevidence is altogether in favour of the prisoner. The figure seen by\nhim we must suppose was the figure of a short man, and not of one\ntall and commanding in his presence, as is that of the prisoner.\"\n\nThere were many other points on which Mr. Chaffanbrass insisted at\ngreat length;--but, chiefly, perhaps, on the improbability, he might\nsay impossibility, that the plot for a murder so contrived should\nhave entered into a man's head, have been completed and executed, all\nwithin a few minutes. \"But under no hypothesis compatible with the\nallegations of the prosecution can it be conceived that the murder\nshould have been contemplated by my client before the quarrel at the\nclub. No, gentlemen;--the murderer had been at his work for days. He\nhad examined the spot and measured the distances. He had dogged the\nsteps of his victim on previous nights. In the shade of some dark\ndoorway he had watched him from his club, and had hurried by his\nsecret path to the spot which he had appointed for the deed. Can any\nman doubt that the murder has thus been committed, let who will have\nbeen the murderer? But, if so, then my client could not have done\nthe deed.\" Much had been made of the words spoken at the club door.\nWas it probable,--was it possible,--that a man intending to commit\na murder should declare how easily he could do it, and display the\nweapon he intended to use? The evidence given as to that part of the\nnight's work was, he contended, altogether in the prisoner's favour.\nThen he spoke of the life-preserver, and gave a rather long account\nof the manner in which Phineas Finn had once taken two garotters\nprisoner in the street. All this lasted till the great men on the\nbench trooped out to lunch. And then Mr. Chaffanbrass, who had been\nspeaking for nearly four hours, retired to a small room and there\ndrank a pint of port wine. While he was doing so, Mr. Serjeant\nBirdbolt spoke a word to him, but he only shook his head and snarled.\nHe was telling himself at the moment how quick may be the resolves\nof the eager mind,--for he was convinced that the idea of attacking\nMr. Bonteen had occurred to Phineas Finn after he had displayed the\nlife-preserver at the club door; and he was telling himself also\nhow impossible it is for a dull conscientious man to give accurate\nevidence as to what he had himself seen,--for he was convinced that\nLord Fawn had seen Phineas Finn in the street. But to no human being\nhad he expressed this opinion; nor would he express it,--unless his\nclient should be hung.\n\nAfter lunch he occupied nearly three hours in giving to the jury,\nand of course to the whole assembled Court, the details of about two\ndozen cases, in which apparently strong circumstantial evidence had\nbeen wrong in its tendency. In some of the cases quoted, the persons\ntried had been acquitted; in some, convicted and afterwards pardoned;\nin one pardoned after many years of punishment;--and in one the poor\nvictim had been hung. On this he insisted with a pathetic eloquence\nwhich certainly would not have been expected from his appearance, and\nspoke with tears in his eyes,--real unaffected tears,--of the misery\nof those wretched jurymen who, in the performance of their duty,\nhad been led into so frightful an error. Through the whole of this\nlong recital he seemed to feel no fatigue, and when he had done with\nhis list of judicial mistakes about five o'clock in the afternoon,\nwent on to make what he called the very few remarks necessary as to\nthe evidence which on the next day he proposed to produce as to the\nprisoner's character. He ventured to think that evidence as to the\ncharacter of such a nature,--so strong, so convincing, so complete,\nand so free from all objection, had never yet been given in a\ncriminal court. At six o'clock he completed his speech, and it\nwas computed that the old man had been on his legs very nearly\nseven hours. It was said of him afterwards that he was taken home\nspeechless by one of his daughters and immediately put to bed, that\nhe roused himself about eight and ate his dinner and drank a bottle\nof port in his bedroom, that he then slept,--refusing to stir even\nwhen he was waked, till half-past nine in the morning, and that then\nhe scrambled into his clothes, breakfasted, and got down to the Court\nin half an hour. At ten o'clock he was in his place, and nobody knew\nthat he was any the worse for the previous day's exertion.\n\nThis was on a Tuesday, the fifth day of the trial, and upon the\nwhole perhaps the most interesting. A long array of distinguished\npersons,--of women as well as men,--was brought up to give to the\njury their opinion as to the character of Mr. Finn. Mr. Low was the\nfirst, who having been his tutor when he was studying at the bar,\nknew him longer than any other Londoner. Then came his countryman\nLaurence Fitzgibbon, and Barrington Erle, and others of his own party\nwho had been intimate with him. And men, too, from the opposite side\nof the House were brought up, Sir Orlando Drought among the number,\nall of whom said that they had known the prisoner well, and from\ntheir knowledge would have considered it impossible that he should\nhave become a murderer. The two last called were Lord Cantrip and Mr.\nMonk, one of whom was, and the other had been, a Cabinet Minister.\nBut before them came Lady Cantrip,--and Lady Chiltern, whom we once\nknew as Violet Effingham, whom this very prisoner had in early days\nfondly hoped to make his wife, who was still young and beautiful, and\nwho had never before entered a public Court.\n\nThere had of course been much question as to the witnesses to be\nselected. The Duchess of Omnium had been anxious to be one, but the\nDuke had forbidden it, telling his wife that she really did not know\nthe man, and that she was carried away by a foolish enthusiasm. Lady\nCantrip when asked had at once consented. She had known Phineas Finn\nwhen he had served under her husband, and had liked him much. Then\nwhat other woman's tongue should be brought to speak of the man's\nsoftness and tender bearing! It was out of the question that Lady\nLaura Kennedy should appear. She did not even propose it when her\nbrother with unnecessary sternness told her it could not be so. Then\nhis wife looked at him. \"You shall go,\" said Lord Chiltern, \"if you\nfeel equal to it. It seems to be nonsense, but they say that it is\nimportant.\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said Violet, with her eyes full of tears. Afterwards\nwhen her sister-in-law besought her to be generous in her testimony,\nshe only smiled as she assented. Could generosity go beyond hers?\n\nLord Chiltern preceded his wife. \"I have,\" he said, \"known Mr. Finn\nwell, and have loved him dearly. I have eaten with him and drank with\nhim, have ridden with him, have lived with him, and have quarrelled\nwith him; and I know him as I do my own right hand.\" Then he\nstretched forth his arm with the palm extended.\n\n\"Irrespectively of the evidence in this case you would not have\nthought him to be a man likely to commit such a crime?\" asked\nSerjeant Birdbolt.\n\n\"I am quite sure from my knowledge of the man that he could not\ncommit a murder,\" said Lord Chiltern; \"and I don't care what the\nevidence is.\"\n\nThen came his wife, and it certainly was a pretty sight to see as her\nhusband led her up to the box and stood close beside her as she gave\nher evidence. There were many there who knew much of the history of\nher life,--who knew that passage in it of her early love,--for the\ntale had of course been told when it was whispered about that Lady\nChiltern was to be examined as a witness. Every ear was at first\nstrained to hear her words;--but they were audible in every corner\nof the Court without any effort. It need hardly be said that she was\ntreated with the greatest deference on every side. She answered the\nquestions very quietly, but apparently without nervousness. \"Yes; she\nhad known Mr. Finn long, and intimately, and had very greatly valued\nhis friendship. She did so still,--as much as ever. Yes; she had\nknown him for some years, and in circumstances which she thought\njustified her in saying that she understood his character. She\nregarded him as a man who was brave and tender-hearted, soft in\nfeeling and manly in disposition. To her it was quite incredible that\nhe should have committed a crime such as this. She knew him to be a\nman prone to forgive offences, and of a sweet nature.\" And it was\npretty too to watch the unwonted gentleness of old Chaffanbrass as\nhe asked the questions, and carefully abstained from putting any one\nthat could pain her. Sir Gregory said that he had heard her evidence\nwith great pleasure, but that he had no question to ask her himself.\nThen she stepped down, again took her husband's arm, and left the\nCourt amidst a hum of almost affectionate greeting.\n\nAnd what must he have thought as he stood there within the dock,\nlooking at her and listening to her? There had been months in his\nlife when he had almost trusted that he would succeed in winning that\nfair, highly-born, and wealthy woman for his wife; and though he\nhad failed, and now knew that he had never really touched her heart,\nthat she had always loved the man whom,--though she had rejected him\ntime after time because of the dangers of his ways,--she had at last\nmarried, yet it must have been pleasant to him, even in his peril, to\nhear from her own lips how well she had esteemed him. She left the\nCourt with her veil down, and he could not catch her eye; but Lord\nChiltern nodded to him in his old pleasant familiar way, as though to\nbid him take courage, and to tell him that all things would even yet\nbe well with him.\n\nThe evidence given by Lady Cantrip and her husband and by Mr. Monk\nwas equally favourable. She had always regarded him as a perfect\ngentleman. Lord Cantrip had found him to be devoted to the service\nof the country,--modest, intelligent, and high-spirited. Perhaps the\nfew words which fell from Mr. Monk were as strong as any that were\nspoken. \"He is a man whom I have delighted to call my friend, and I\nhave been happy to think that his services have been at the disposal\nof his country.\"\n\nSir Gregory Grogram replied. It seemed to him that the evidence was\nas he had left it. It would be for the jury to decide, under such\ndirections as his lordship might be pleased to give them, how far\nthat evidence brought the guilt home to the prisoner. He would use no\nrhetoric in pushing the case against the prisoner; but he must submit\nto them that his learned friend had not shown that acquaintance with\nhuman nature which the gentleman undoubtedly possessed in arguing\nthat there had lacked time for the conception and execution of the\ncrime. Then, at considerable length, he strove to show that Mr.\nChaffanbrass had been unjustly severe upon Lord Fawn.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when Sir Gregory had finished his\nspeech, and the judge's charge was reserved for a sixth day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nCONFUSION IN THE COURT.\n\n\nOn the following morning it was observed that before the judges took\ntheir seats Mr. Chaffanbrass entered the Court with a manner much\nmore brisk than was expected from him now that his own work was done.\nAs a matter of course he would be there to hear the charge, but,\nalmost equally as a matter of course, he would be languid, silent,\ncross, and unenergetic. They who knew him were sure, when they saw\nhis bearing on this morning, that he intended to do something more\nbefore the charge was given. The judges entered the Court nearly half\nan hour later than usual, and it was observed with surprise that they\nwere followed by the Duke of Omnium. Mr. Chaffanbrass was on his feet\nbefore the Chief Justice had taken his seat, but the judge was the\nfirst to speak. It was observed that he held a scrap of paper in his\nhand, and that the barrister held a similar scrap. Then every man\nin the Court knew that some message had come suddenly by the wires.\n\"I am informed, Mr. Chaffanbrass, that you wish to address the Court\nbefore I begin my charge.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lud; and I am afraid, my lud, that I shall have to ask\nyour ludship to delay your charge for some days, and to subject the\njury to the very great inconvenience of prolonged incarceration for\nanother week;--either to do that or to call upon the jury to acquit\nthe prisoner. I venture to assert, on my own peril, that no jury can\nconvict the prisoner after hearing me read that which I hold in my\nhand.\" Then Mr. Chaffanbrass paused, as though expecting that the\njudge would speak;--but the judge said not a word, but sat looking\nat the old barrister over his spectacles.\n\nEvery eye was turned upon Phineas Finn, who up to this moment had\nheard nothing of these new tidings,--who did not in the least know\non what was grounded the singularly confident,--almost insolently\nconfident assertion which Mr. Chaffanbrass had made in his favour. On\nhim the effect was altogether distressing. He had borne the trying\nweek with singular fortitude, having stood there in the place of\nshame hour after hour, and day after day, expecting his doom. It had\nbeen to him as a lifetime of torture. He had become almost numb from\nthe weariness of his position and the agonising strain upon his mind.\nThe gaoler had offered him a seat from day to day, but he had always\nrefused it, preferring to lean upon the rail and gaze upon the Court.\nHe had almost ceased to hope for anything except the end of it. He\nhad lost count of the days, and had begun to feel that the trial was\nan eternity of torture in itself. At nights he could not sleep, but\nduring the Sunday, after Mass, he had slept all day. Then it had\nbegun again, and when the Tuesday came he hardly knew how long it had\nbeen since that vacant Sunday. And now he heard the advocate declare,\nwithout knowing on what ground the declaration was grounded, that\nthe trial must be postponed, or that the jury must be instructed to\nacquit him.\n\n\"This telegram has reached us only this morning,\" continued Mr.\nChaffanbrass. \"'Mealyus had a house door-key made in Prague. We have\nthe mould in our possession, and will bring the man who made the\nkey to England.' Now, my lud, the case in the hands of the police,\nas against this man Mealyus, or Emilius, as he has chosen to call\nhimself, broke down altogether on the presumption that he could not\nhave let himself in and out of the house in which he had put himself\nto bed on the night of the murder. We now propose to prove that he\nhad prepared himself with the means of doing so, and had done so\nafter a fashion which is conclusive as to his having required the key\nfor some guilty purpose. We assert that your ludship cannot allow the\ncase to go to the jury without taking cognisance of this telegram;\nand we go further, and say that those twelve men, as twelve human\nbeings with hearts in their bosoms and ordinary intelligence at their\ncommand, cannot ignore the message, even should your ludship insist\nupon their doing so with all the energy at your disposal.\"\n\nThen there was a scene in Court, and it appeared that no less\nthan four messages had been received from Prague, all to the same\neffect. One had been addressed by Madame Goesler to her friend the\nDuchess,--and that message had caused the Duke's appearance on the\nscene. He had brought his telegram direct to the Old Bailey, and the\nChief Justice now held it in his hand. The lawyer's clerk who had\naccompanied Madame Goesler had telegraphed to the Governor of the\ngaol, to Mr. Wickerby, and to the Attorney-General. Sir Gregory,\nrising with the telegram in his hand, stated that he had received the\nsame information. \"I do not see,\" said he, \"that it at all alters the\nevidence as against the prisoner.\"\n\n\"Let your evidence go to the jury, then,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass,\n\"with such observations as his lordship may choose to make on the\ntelegram. I shall be contented. You have already got your other man\nin prison on a charge of bigamy.\"\n\n\"I could not take notice of the message in charging the jury, Mr.\nChaffanbrass,\" said the judge. \"It has come, as far as we know,\nfrom the energy of a warm friend,--from that hearty friendship with\nwhich it seemed yesterday that this gentleman, the prisoner at the\nbar, has inspired so many men and women of high character. But it\nproves nothing. It is an assertion. And where should we all be, Mr.\nChaffanbrass, if it should appear hereafter that the assertion is\nfictitious,--prepared purposely to aid the escape of a criminal?\"\n\n\"I defy you to ignore it, my lord.\"\n\n\"I can only suggest, Mr. Chaffanbrass,\" continued the judge, \"that\nyou should obtain the consent of the gentlemen on the other side to\na postponement of my charge.\"\n\nThen spoke out the foreman of the jury. Was it proposed that they\nshould be locked up till somebody should come from Prague, and that\nthen the trial should be recommenced? The system, said the foreman,\nunder which Middlesex juries were chosen for service in the City was\nknown to be most horribly cruel;--but cruelty to jurymen such as this\nhad never even been heard of. Then a most irregular word was spoken.\nOne of the jurymen declared that he was quite willing to believe the\ntelegram. \"Every one believes it,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass. Then the\nChief Justice scolded the juryman, and Sir Gregory Grogram scolded\nMr. Chaffanbrass. It seemed as though all the rules of the Court\nwere to be set at defiance. \"Will my learned friend say that he\ndoesn't believe it?\" asked Mr. Chaffanbrass. \"I neither believe nor\ndisbelieve it; but it cannot affect the evidence,\" said Sir Gregory.\n\"Then send the case to the jury,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass. It seemed\nthat everybody was talking, and Mr. Wickerby, the attorney, tried\nto explain it all to the prisoner over the bar of the dock, not in\nthe lowest possible voice. The Chief Justice became angry, and the\nguardian of the silence of the Court bestirred himself energetically.\n\"My lud,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass, \"I maintain that it is proper that\nthe prisoner should be informed of the purport of these telegrams.\nMercy demands it, and justice as well.\" Phineas Finn, however, did\nnot understand, as he had known nothing about the latch-key of the\nhouse in Northumberland Street.\n\nSomething, however, must be done. The Chief Justice was of opinion\nthat, although the preparation of a latch-key in Prague could not\nreally affect the evidence against the prisoner,--although the facts\nagainst the prisoner would not be altered, let the manufacture\nof that special key be ever so clearly proved,--nevertheless the\njury were entitled to have before them the facts now tendered in\nevidence before they could be called upon to give a verdict, and\nthat therefore they should submit themselves, in the service of\ntheir country, to the very serious additional inconvenience which\nthey would be called upon to endure. Sundry of the jury altogether\ndisagreed with this, and became loud in their anger. They had already\nbeen locked up for a week. \"And we are quite prepared to give a\nverdict,\" said one. The judge again scolded him very severely; and\nas the Attorney-General did at last assent, and as the unfortunate\njurymen had no power in the matter, so it was at last arranged.\nThe trial should be postponed till time should be given for Madame\nGoesler and the blacksmith to reach London from Prague.\n\nIf the matter was interesting to the public before, it became doubly\ninteresting now. It was of course known to everybody that Madame\nGoesler had undertaken a journey to Bohemia,--and, as many supposed,\na roving tour through all the wilder parts of unknown Europe, Poland,\nHungary, and the Principalities for instance,--with the object of\nlooking for evidence to save the life of Phineas Finn; and grandly\nromantic tales were told of her wit, her wealth, and her beauty.\nThe story was published of the Duke of Omnium's will, only not\nexactly the true story. The late Duke had left her everything at his\ndisposal, and, it was hinted that they had been privately married\njust before the Duke's death. Of course Madame Goesler became very\npopular, and the blacksmith from Prague who had made the key was\nexpected with an enthusiasm which almost led to preparation for a\npublic reception.\n\nAnd yet, let the blacksmith from Prague be ever so minute in his\nevidence as to the key, let it be made as clear as running water that\nMealyus had caused to be constructed for him in Prague a key that\nwould open the door of the house in Northumberland Street, the facts\nas proved at the trial would not be at all changed. The lawyers were\nmuch at variance with their opinions on the matter, some thinking\nthat the judge had been altogether wrong in delaying his charge.\nAccording to them he should not have allowed Mr. Chaffanbrass to have\nread the telegram in Court. The charge should have been given, and\nthe sentence of the Court should have been pronounced if a verdict\nof guilty were given. The Home Secretary should then have granted\na respite till the coming of the blacksmith, and have extended\nthis respite to a pardon, if advised that the circumstances of the\nlatch-key rendered doubtful the propriety of the verdict. Others,\nhowever, maintained that in this way a grievous penalty would be\ninflicted on a man who, by general consent, was now held to be\ninnocent. Not only would he, by such an arrangement of circumstances,\nhave been left for some prolonged period under the agony of a\ncondemnation, but, by the necessity of the case, he would lose his\nseat for Tankerville. It would be imperative upon the House to\ndeclare vacant by its own action a seat held by a man condemned to\ndeath for murder, and no pardon from the Queen or from the Home\nSecretary would absolve the House from that duty. The House, as a\nHouse of Parliament, could only recognise the verdict of the jury\nas to the man's guilt. The Queen, of course, might pardon whom she\npleased, but no pardon from the Queen would remove the guilt implied\nby the sentence. Many went much further than this, and were prepared\nto prove that were he once condemned he could not afterwards sit in\nthe House, even if re-elected.\n\nNow there was unquestionably an intense desire,--since the arrival of\nthese telegrams,--that Phineas Finn should retain his seat. It may be\na question whether he would not have been the most popular man in the\nHouse could he have sat there on the day after the telegrams arrived.\nThe Attorney-General had declared,--and many others had declared\nwith him,--that this information about the latch-key did not in\nthe least affect the evidence as given against Mr. Finn. Could it\nhave been possible to convict the other man, merely because he had\nsurreptitiously caused a door-key of the house in which he lived\nto be made for him? And how would this new information have been\nreceived had Lord Fawn sworn unreservedly that the man he had seen\nrunning out of the mews had been Phineas Finn? It was acknowledged\nthat the latch-key could not be accepted as sufficient evidence\nagainst Mealyus. But nevertheless the information conveyed by the\ntelegrams altogether changed the opinion of the public as to the\nguilt or innocence of Phineas Finn. His life now might have been\ninsured, as against the gallows, at a very low rate. It was felt\nthat no jury could convict him, and he was much more pitied in\nbeing subjected to a prolonged incarceration than even those twelve\nunfortunate men who had felt sure that the Wednesday would have been\nthe last day of their unmerited martyrdom.\n\nPhineas in his prison was materially circumstanced precisely as\nhe had been before the trial. He was supplied with a profusion of\nluxuries, could they have comforted him; and was allowed to receive\nvisitors. But he would see no one but his sisters,--except that he\nhad one interview with Mr. Low. Even Mr. Low found it difficult to\nmake him comprehend the exact condition of the affair, and could not\ninduce him to be comforted when he did understand it. What had he to\ndo,--how could his innocence or his guilt be concerned,--with the\nmanufacture of a paltry key by such a one as Mealyus? How would it\nhave been with him and with his name for ever if this fact had not\nbeen discovered? \"I was to be hung or saved from hanging according to\nthe chances of such a thing as this! I do not care for my life in a\ncountry where such injustice can be done.\" His friend endeavoured to\nassure him that even had nothing been heard of the key the jury would\nhave acquitted him. But Phineas would not believe him. It had seemed\nto him as he had listened to the whole proceeding that the Court had\nbeen against him. The Attorney and Solicitor-General had appeared to\nhim resolved upon hanging him,--men who had been, at any rate, his\nintimate acquaintances, with whom he had sat on the same bench, who\nought to have known him. And the judge had taken the part of Lord\nFawn, who had seemed to Phineas to be bent on swearing away his life.\nHe had borne himself very gallantly during that week, having in all\nhis intercourse with his attorney, spoken without a quaver in his\nvoice, and without a flaw in the perspicuity of his intelligence.\nBut now, when Mr. Low came to him, explaining to him that it was\nimpossible that a verdict should be found against him, he was quite\nbroken down. \"There is nothing left of me,\" he said at the end of the\ninterview. \"I feel that I had better take to my bed and die. Even\nwhen I think of all that friends have done for me, it fails to cheer\nme. In this matter I should not have had to depend on friends. Had\nnot she gone for me to that place every one would have believed me to\nbe a murderer.\"\n\nAnd yet in his solitude he thought very much of the marvellous love\nshown to him by his friends. Words had been spoken which had been\nvery sweet to him in all his misery,--words such as neither men nor\nwomen can say to each other in the ordinary intercourse of life,\nmuch as they may wish that their purport should be understood. Lord\nChiltern, Lord Cantrip, and Mr. Monk had alluded to him as a man\nspecially singled out by them for their friendship. Lady Cantrip,\nthan whom no woman in London was more discreet, had been equally\nenthusiastic. Then how gracious, how tender, how inexpressibly sweet\nhad been the words of her who had been Violet Effingham! And now the\nnews had reached him of Madame Goesler's journey to the continent.\n\"It was a wonderful thing for her to do,\" Mr. Low had said. Yes,\nindeed! Remembering all that had passed between them he acknowledged\nto himself that it was very wonderful. Were it not that his back was\nnow broken, that he was prostrate and must remain so, a man utterly\ncrushed by what he had endured, it might have been possible that she\nshould do more for him even than she yet had done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\n\"I HATE HER!\"\n\n\nLady Laura Kennedy had been allowed to take no active part in the\nmanifestations of friendship which at this time were made on behalf\nof Phineas Finn. She had, indeed, gone to him in his prison, and made\ndaily efforts to administer to his comfort; but she could not go up\ninto the Court and speak for him. And now this other woman, whom she\nhated, would have the glory of his deliverance! She already began\nto see a fate before her, which would make even her past misery as\nnothing to that which was to come. She was a widow,--not yet two\nmonths a widow; and though she did not and could not mourn the death\nof a husband as do other widows,--though she could not sorrow in\nher heart for a man whom she had never loved, and from whom she had\nbeen separated during half her married life,--yet the fact of her\nwidowhood and the circumstances of her weeds were heavy on her. That\nshe loved this man, Phineas Finn, with a passionate devotion of which\nthe other woman could know nothing she was quite sure. Love him! Had\nshe not been true to him and to his interests from the very first\nday in which he had come among them in London, with almost more than\na woman's truth? She knew and recalled to her memory over and over\nagain her own one great sin,--the fault of her life. When she was, as\nregarded her own means, a poor woman, she had refused to be this poor\nman's wife, and had given her hand to a rich suitor. But she had done\nthis with a conviction that she could so best serve the interests of\nthe man in regard to whom she had promised herself that her feeling\nshould henceforth be one of simple and purest friendship. She had\nmade a great effort to carry out that intention, but the effort had\nbeen futile. She had striven to do her duty to a husband whom she\ndisliked,--but even in that she had failed. At one time she had been\npersistent in her intercourse with Phineas Finn, and at another had\nresolved that she would not see him. She had been madly angry with\nhim when he came to her with the story of his love for another woman,\nand had madly shown her anger; but yet she had striven to get for him\nthe wife he wanted, though in doing so she would have abandoned one\nof the dearest purposes of her life. She had moved heaven and earth\nfor him,--her heaven and earth,--when there was danger that he would\nlose his seat in Parliament. She had encountered the jealousy of\nher husband with scorn,--and had then deserted him because he was\njealous. And all this she did with a consciousness of her own virtue\nwhich was almost as sublime as it was ill-founded. She had been\nwrong. She confessed so much to herself with bitter tears. She had\nmarred the happiness of three persons by the mistake she had made in\nearly life. But it had not yet occurred to her that she had sinned.\nTo her thinking the jealousy of her husband had been preposterous and\nabominable, because she had known,--and had therefore felt that he\nshould have known,--that she would never disgrace him by that which\nthe world calls falsehood in a wife. She had married him without\nloving him, but it seemed to her that he was in fault for that. They\nhad become wretched, but she had never pitied his wretchedness. She\nhad left him, and thought herself to be ill-used because he had\nventured to reclaim his wife. Through it all she had been true in her\nregard to the one man she had ever loved, and,--though she admitted\nher own folly and knew her own shipwreck,--yet she had always drawn\nsome woman's consolation from the conviction of her own constancy.\nHe had vanished from her sight for a while with a young wife,--never\nfrom her mind,--and then he had returned a widower. Through silence,\nabsence, and distance she had been true to him. On his return to\nhis old ways she had at once welcomed him and strove to aid him.\nEverything that was hers should be his,--if only he would open his\nhands to take it. And she would tell it him all,--let him know every\ncorner of her heart. She was a married woman, and could not be his\nwife. She was a woman of virtue, and would not be his mistress. But\nshe would be to him a friend so tender that no wife, no mistress\nshould ever have been fonder! She did tell him everything as they\nstood together on the ramparts of the old Saxon castle. Then he had\nkissed her, and pressed her to his heart,--not because he loved her,\nbut because he was generous. She had partly understood it all,--but\nyet had not understood it thoroughly. He did not assure her of his\nlove,--but then she was a wife, and would have admitted no love that\nwas sinful. When she returned to Dresden that night she stood gazing\nat herself in the glass and saw that there was nothing there to\nattract the love of such a man as Phineas Finn,--of one who was\nhimself glorious with manly beauty; but yet for her sadness there was\nsome cure, some possibility of consolation in the fact that she was\na wife. Why speak of love at all when marriage was so far out of the\nquestion? But now she was a widow and as free as he was,--a widow\nendowed with ample wealth; and she was the woman to whom he had sworn\nhis love when they had stood together, both young, by the falls\nof the Linter! How often might they stand there again if only his\nconstancy would equal hers?\n\nShe had seen him once since Fate had made her a widow; but then she\nhad been but a few days a widow, and his life had at that moment been\nin strange jeopardy. There had certainly been no time then for other\nlove than that which the circumstances and the sorrow of the hour\ndemanded from their mutual friendship. From that day, from the first\nmoment in which she had heard of his arrest, every thought, every\neffort of her mind had been devoted to his affairs. So great was his\nperil and so strange, that it almost wiped out from her mind the\nremembrance of her own condition. Should they hang him,--undoubtedly\nshe would die. Such a termination to all her aspirations for him whom\nshe had selected as her god upon earth would utterly crush her. She\nhad borne much, but she could never bear that. Should he escape, but\nescape ingloriously;--ah, then he should know what the devotion of\na woman could do for a man! But if he should leave his prison with\nflying colours, and come forth a hero to the world, how would it be\nwith her then? She could foresee and understand of what nature would\nbe the ovation with which he would be greeted. She had already heard\nwhat the Duchess was doing and saying. She knew how eager on his\nbehalf were Lord and Lady Cantrip. She discussed the matter daily\nwith her sister-in-law, and knew what her brother thought. If the\nacquittal were perfect, there would certainly be an ovation,--in\nwhich, was it not certain to her, that she would be forgotten? And\nshe heard much, too, of Madame Goesler. And now there came the\nnews. Madame Goesler had gone to Prague, to Cracow,--and where\nnot?--spending her wealth, employing her wits, bearing fatigue,\nopenly before the world on this man's behalf; and had done so\nsuccessfully. She had found this evidence of the key, and now because\nthe tracings of a key had been discovered by a woman, people were\nready to believe that he was innocent, as to whose innocence she,\nLaura Kennedy, would have been willing to stake her own life from the\nbeginning of the affair!\n\nWhy had it not been her lot to go to Prague? Would not she have drunk\nup Esil, or swallowed a crocodile against any she-Laertes that would\nhave thought to rival and to parallel her great love? Would not\nshe have piled up new Ossas, had the opportunity been given her?\nWomanlike she had gone to him in her trouble,--had burst through\nhis prison doors, had thrown herself on his breast, and had wept\nat his feet. But of what avail had been that? This strange female,\nthis Moabitish woman, had gone to Prague, and had found a key,--and\neverybody said that the thing was done! How she hated the strange\nwoman, and remembered all the evil things that had been said of the\nintruder! She told herself over and over again that had it been\nany one else than this half-foreigner, this German Jewess, this\nintriguing unfeminine upstart, she could have borne it. Did not all\nthe world know that the woman for the last two years had been the\nmistress of that old doting Duke who was now dead? Had one ever heard\nwho was her father or who was her mother? Had it not always been\ndeclared of her that she was a pushing, dangerous, scheming creature?\nAnd then she was old enough to be his mother, though by some Medean\ntricks known to such women, she was able to postpone,--not the\nravages of age,--but the manifestation of them to the eyes of the\nworld. In all of which charges poor Lady Laura wronged her rival\nfoully;--in that matter of age especially, for, as it happened,\nMadame Goesler was by some months the younger of the two. But Lady\nLaura was a blonde, and trouble had told upon her outwardly, as it\nis wont to do upon those who are fair-skinned, and, at the same time,\nhigh-hearted. But Madame Goesler was a brunette,--swarthy, Lady Laura\nwould have called her,--with bright eyes and glossy hair and thin\ncheeks, and now being somewhat over thirty she was at her best. Lady\nLaura hated her as a fair woman who has lost her beauty can hate the\ndark woman who keeps it.\n\n\"What made her think of the key?\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"I don't believe she did think of it. It was an accident.\"\n\n\"Then why did she go?\"\n\n\"Oh, Violet, do not talk to me about that woman any more, or I shall\nbe mad.\"\n\n\"She has done him good service.\"\n\n\"Very well;--so be it. Let him have the service. I know they would\nhave acquitted him if she had never stirred from London. Oswald says\nso. But no matter. Let her have her triumph. Only do not talk to me\nabout her. You know what I have thought about her ever since she\nfirst came up in London. Nothing ever surprised me so much as that\nyou should take her by the hand.\"\n\n\"I do not know that I took her specially by the hand.\"\n\n\"You had her down at Harrington.\"\n\n\"Yes; I did. And I do like her. And I know nothing against her. I\nthink you are prejudiced against her, Laura.\"\n\n\"Very well. Of course you think and can say what you please. I hate\nher, and that is sufficient.\" Then, after a pause, she added, \"Of\ncourse he will marry her. I know that well enough. It is nothing to\nme whom he marries--only,--only,--only, after all that has passed it\nseems hard upon me that his wife should be the only woman in London\nthat I could not visit.\"\n\n\"Dear Laura, you should control your thoughts about this young man.\"\n\n\"Of course I should;--but I don't. You mean that I am disgracing\nmyself.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. Oswald is more candid, and tells me so openly. And\nyet what have I done? The world has been hard upon me, and I have\nsuffered. Do I desire anything except that he shall be happy and\nrespectable? Do I hope for anything? I will go back and linger\nout my life at Dresden, where my disgrace can hurt no one.\" Her\nsister-in-law with all imaginable tenderness said what she could to\nconsole the miserable woman;--but there was no consolation possible.\nThey both knew that Phineas Finn would never renew the offer which he\nhad once made.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nTHE FOREIGN BLUDGEON.\n\n\nIn the meantime Madame Goesler, having accomplished the journey from\nPrague in considerably less than a week, reached London with the\nblacksmith, the attorney's clerk, and the model of the key. The trial\nhad been adjourned on Wednesday, the 24th of June, and it had been\nsuggested that the jury should be again put into their box on that\nday week. All manner of inconvenience was to be endured by various\nmembers of the legal profession, and sundry irregularities were of\nnecessity sanctioned on this great occasion. The sitting of the Court\nshould have been concluded, and everybody concerned should have been\nsomewhere else, but the matter was sufficient to justify almost any\ndeparture from routine. A member of the House of Commons was in\ncustody, and it had already been suggested that some action should\nbe taken by the House as to his speedy deliverance. Unless a jury\ncould find him guilty, let him be at once restored to his duties and\nhis privileges. The case was involved in difficulties, but in the\nmeantime the jury, who had been taken down by train every day to have\na walk in the country in the company of two sheriff's officers, and\nwho had been allowed to dine at Greenwich one day and at Richmond on\nanother in the hope that whitebait with lamb and salad might in some\ndegree console them for their loss of liberty, were informed that\nthey would be once again put into their box on Wednesday. But Madame\nGoesler reached London on the Sunday morning, and on the Monday the\nwhole affair respecting the key was unravelled in the presence of the\nAttorney-General, and with the personal assistance of our old friend,\nMajor Mackintosh. Without a doubt the man Mealyus had caused to be\nmade for him in Prague a key which would open the door of the house\nin Northumberland Street. A key was made in London from the model now\nbrought which did open the door. The Attorney-General seemed to think\nthat it would be his duty to ask the judge to call upon the jury to\nacquit Phineas Finn, and that then the matter must rest for ever,\nunless further evidence could be obtained against Yosef Mealyus.\nIt would not be possible to hang a man for a murder simply because\nhe had fabricated a key,--even though he might possibly have\nobtained the use of a grey coat for a few hours. There was no tittle\nof evidence to show that he had ever had the great coat on his\nshoulders, or that he had been out of the house on that night. Lord\nFawn, to his infinite disgust, was taken to the prison in which\nMealyus was detained, and was confronted with the man, but he could\nsay nothing. Mealyus, at his own suggestion, put on the coat, and\nstalked about the room in it. But Lord Fawn would not say a word. The\nperson whom he now saw might have been the man in the street, or Mr.\nFinn might have been the man, or any other man might have been the\nman. Lord Fawn was very dignified, very reserved, and very unhappy.\nTo his thinking he was the great martyr of this trial. Phineas Finn\nwas becoming a hero. Against the twelve jurymen the finger of scorn\nwould never be pointed. But his sufferings must endure for his\nlife--might probably embitter his life to the very end. Looking into\nhis own future from his present point of view he did not see how\nhe could ever again appear before the eye of the public. And yet\nwith what persistency of conscience had he struggled to be true and\nhonest! On the present occasion he would say nothing. He had seen\na man in a grey coat, and for the future would confine himself to\nthat. \"You did not see me, my lord,\" said Mr. Emilius with touching\nsimplicity.\n\nSo the matter stood on the Monday afternoon, and the jury had\nalready been told that they might be released on the following\nTuesday,--might at any rate hear the judge's charge on that\nday,--when another discovery was made more wonderful than that of the\nkey. And this was made without any journey to Prague, and might, no\ndoubt, have been made on any day since the murder had been committed.\nAnd it was a discovery for not having made which the police force\ngenerally was subjected to heavy censure. A beautiful little boy was\nseen playing in one of those gardens through which the passage runs\nwith a short loaded bludgeon in his hand. He came into the house with\nthe weapon, the maid who was with him having asked the little lord no\nquestion on the subject. But luckily it attracted attention, and his\nlittle lordship took two gardeners and a coachman and all the nurses\nto the very spot at which he found it. Before an hour was over he was\nstanding at his father's knee, detailing the fact with great open\neyes to two policemen, having by this time become immensely proud of\nhis adventure. This occurred late on the Monday afternoon, when the\nnoble family were at dinner, and the noble family was considerably\ndisturbed, and at the same time very much interested, by the\noccurrence. But on the Tuesday morning there was the additional fact\nestablished that a bludgeon loaded with lead had been found among the\nthick grass and undergrowth of shrubs in a spot to which it might\neasily have been thrown by any one attempting to pitch it over the\nwall. The news flew about the town like wildfire, and it was now\nconsidered certain that the real murderer would be discovered.\n\n\n[Illustration: The boy who found the bludgeon.]\n\n\nBut the renewal of the trial was again postponed till the Wednesday,\nas it was necessary that an entire day should be devoted to the\nbludgeon. The instrument was submitted to the eyes and hands of\npersons experienced in such matters, and it was declared on all sides\nthat the thing was not of English manufacture. It was about a foot\nlong, with a leathern thong to the handle, with something of a spring\nin the shaft, and with the oval loaded knot at the end cased with\nleathern thongs very minutely and skilfully cut. They who understood\nmodern work in leather gave it as their opinion that the weapon had\nbeen made in Paris. It was considered that Mealyus had brought it\nwith him, and concealed it in preparation for this occasion. If the\npolice could succeed in tracing the bludgeon into his hands, or in\nproving that he had purchased any such instrument, then,--so it was\nthought,--there would be evidence to justify a police magistrate in\nsending Mr. Emilius to occupy the place so lately and so long held\nby poor Phineas Finn. But till that had been done, there could be\nnothing to connect the preacher with the murder. All who had heard\nthe circumstances of the case were convinced that Mr. Bonteen had\nbeen murdered by the weapon lately discovered, and not by that which\nPhineas had carried in his pocket,--but no one could adduce proof\nthat it was so. This second bludgeon would no doubt help to remove\nthe difficulty in regard to Phineas, but would not give atonement to\nthe shade of Mr. Bonteen.\n\nMealyus was confronted with the weapon in the presence of Major\nMackintosh, and was told its story;--how it was found in the\nnobleman's garden by the little boy. At the first moment, with\ninstant readiness, he took the thing in his hand, and looked at it\nwith feigned curiosity. He must have studied his conduct so as to\nhave it ready for such an occasion, thinking that it might some\nday occur. But with all his presence of mind he could not keep the\ntell-tale blood from mounting.\n\n\"You don't know anything about it, Mr. Mealyus?\" said one of the\npolicemen present, looking closely into his face. \"Of course you need\nnot criminate yourself.\"\n\n\"What should I know about it? No;--I know nothing about the stick. I\nnever had such a stick, or, as I believe, saw one before.\" He did it\nvery well, but he could not keep the blood from rising to his cheeks.\nThe policemen were sure that he was the murderer,--but what could\nthey do?\n\n\"You saved his life, certainly,\" said the Duchess to her friend on\nthe Sunday afternoon. That had been before the bludgeon was found.\n\n\"I do not believe that they could have touched a hair of his head,\"\nsaid Madame Goesler.\n\n\"Would they not? Everybody felt sure that he would be hung. Would\nit not have been awful? I do not see how you are to help becoming\nman and wife now, for all the world are talking about you.\" Madame\nGoesler smiled, and said that she was quite indifferent to the\nworld's talk. On the Tuesday after the bludgeon was found, the two\nladies met again. \"Now it was known that it was the clergyman,\" said\nthe Duchess.\n\n\"I never doubted it.\"\n\n\"He must have been a brave man for a foreigner,--to have attacked Mr.\nBonteen all alone in the street, when any one might have seen him.\nI don't feel to hate him so very much after all. As for that little\nwife of his, she has got no more than she deserved.\"\n\n\"Mr. Finn will surely be acquitted now.\"\n\n\"Of course he'll be acquitted. Nobody doubts about it. That is all\nsettled, and it is a shame that he should be kept in prison even\nover to-day. I should think they'll make him a peer, and give him a\npension,--or at the very least appoint him secretary to something.\nI do wish Plantagenet hadn't been in such a hurry about that nasty\nBoard of Trade, and then he might have gone there. He couldn't very\nwell be Privy Seal, unless they do make him a peer. You wouldn't\nmind,--would you, my dear?\"\n\n\"I think you'll find that they will console Mr. Finn with something\nless gorgeous than that. You have succeeded in seeing him, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"Plantagenet wouldn't let me, but I know who did.\"\n\n\"Some lady?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,--a lady. Half the men about the clubs went to him, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\n\"You won't be ill-natured?\"\n\n\"I'll endeavour at any rate to keep my temper, Duchess.\"\n\n\"It was Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"I supposed so.\"\n\n\"They say she is frantic about him, my dear.\"\n\n\"I never believe those things. Women do not get frantic about men\nin these days. They have been very old friends, and have known each\nother for many years. Her brother, Lord Chiltern, was his particular\nfriend. I do not wonder that she should have seen him.\"\n\n\"Of course you know that she is a widow.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--Mr. Kennedy had died long before I left England.\"\n\n\"And she is very rich. She has got all Loughlinter for her life, and\nher own fortune back again. I will bet you anything you like that she\noffers to share it with him.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said Madame Goesler, while the slightest blush in the\nworld suffused her cheek.\n\n\"And I'll make you another bet, and give you any odds.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That he refuses her. It is quite a common thing nowadays for ladies\nto make the offer, and for gentlemen to refuse. Indeed, it was felt\nto be so inconvenient while it was thought that gentlemen had not the\nalternative, that some men became afraid of going into society. It is\nbetter understood now.\"\n\n\"Such things have been done, I do not doubt,\" said Madame Goesler,\nwho had contrived to avert her face without making the motion\napparent to her friend.\n\n\"When this is all over we'll get him down to Matching, and manage\nbetter than that. I should think they'll hardly go on with the\nSession, as nobody has done anything since the arrest. While Mr. Finn\nhas been in prison legislation has come to a standstill altogether.\nEven Plantagenet doesn't work above twelve hours a day, and I'm\ntold that poor Lord Fawn hasn't been near his office for the last\nfortnight. When the excitement is over they'll never be able to get\nback to their business before the grouse. There'll be a few dinners\nof course, just as a compliment to the great man,--but London will\nbreak up after that, I should think. You won't come in for so much\nof the glory as you would have done if they hadn't found the stick.\nLittle Lord Frederick must have his share, you know.\"\n\n\"It's the most singular case I ever knew,\" said Sir Simon Slope that\nnight to one of his friends. \"We certainly should have hanged him but\nfor the two accidents, and yet neither of them brings us a bit nearer\nto hanging any one else.\"\n\n\"What a pity!\"\n\n\"It shows the danger of circumstantial evidence,--and yet without it\none never could get at any murder. I'm very glad, you know, that the\nkey and the stick did turn up. I never thought much about the coat.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nTHE VERDICT.\n\n\nOn the Wednesday morning Phineas Finn was again brought into the\nCourt, and again placed in the dock. There was a general feeling\nthat he should not again have been so disgraced; but he was still a\nprisoner under a charge of murder, and it was explained to him that\nthe circumstances of the case and the stringency of the law did not\nadmit of his being seated elsewhere during his trial. He treated the\napology with courteous scorn. He should not have chosen, he said,\nto have made any change till after the trial was over, even had any\nchange been permitted. When he was brought up the steps into the dock\nafter the judges had taken their seats there was almost a shout of\napplause. The crier was very angry, and gave it to be understood that\neverybody would be arrested unless everybody was silent; but the\nChief Justice said not a word, nor did those great men the Attorney\nand Solicitor-General express any displeasure. The bench was again\ncrowded with Members of Parliament from both Houses, and on this\noccasion Mr. Gresham himself had accompanied Lord Cantrip. The two\nDukes were there, and men no bigger than Laurence Fitzgibbon were\nforced to subject themselves to the benevolence of the Under-Sheriff.\n\nPhineas himself was pale and haggard. It was observed that he leaned\nforward on the rail of the dock all the day, not standing upright\nas he had done before; and they who watched him closely said that\nhe never once raised his eyes on this day to meet those of the men\nopposite to him on the bench, although heretofore throughout the\ntrial he had stood with his face raised so as to look directly at\nthose who were there seated. On this occasion he kept his eyes fixed\nupon the speaker. But the whole bearing of the man, his gestures, his\ngait, and his countenance were changed. During the first long week\nof his trial, his uprightness, the manly beauty of his countenance,\nand the general courage and tranquillity of his deportment had been\nconspicuous. Whatever had been his fatigue, he had managed not to\nshow the outward signs of weariness. Whatever had been his fears,\nno mark of fear had disfigured his countenance. He had never once\ncondescended to the exhibition of any outward show of effrontery.\nThrough six weary days he had stood there, supported by a manhood\nsufficient for the terrible emergency. But now it seemed that at any\nrate the outward grace of his demeanour had deserted him. But it\nwas known that he had been ill during the last few days, and it had\nbeen whispered through the Court that he had not slept at nights.\nSince the adjournment of the Court there had been bulletins as to his\nhealth, and everybody knew that the confinement was beginning to tell\nupon him.\n\nOn the present occasion the proceedings of the day were opened by the\nAttorney-General, who began by apologising to the jury. Apologies to\nthe jury had been very frequent during the trial, and each apology\nhad called forth fresh grumbling. On this occasion the foreman\nexpressed a hope that the Legislature would consider the condition\nof things which made it possible that twelve gentlemen all concerned\nextensively in business should be confined for fourteen days because\na mistake had been made in the evidence as to a murder. Then the\nChief Justice, bowing down his head and looking at them over the rim\nof his spectacles with an expression of wisdom that almost convinced\nthem, told them that he was aware of no mistake in the evidence. It\nmight become their duty, on the evidence which they had heard and the\nfurther evidence which they would hear, to acquit the prisoner at the\nbar; but not on that account would there have been any mistake or\nerroneous procedure in the Court, other than such error on the part\nof the prosecution in regard to the alleged guilt of the prisoner\nas it was the general and special duty of jurors to remedy. Then he\nendeavoured to reconcile them to their sacrifice by describing the\nimportance and glorious British nature of their position. \"My lord,\"\nsaid one of the jurors, \"if you was a salesman, and hadn't got no\npartner, only a very young 'un, you'd know what it was to be kept\nout of your business for a fortnight.\" Then that salesman wagged his\nhead, and put his handkerchief up to his eyes, and there was pity\nalso for him in the Court.\n\nAfter that the Attorney-General went on. His learned friend on\nthe other side,--and he nodded to Mr. Chaffanbrass,--had got some\nfurther evidence to submit to them on behalf of the prisoner who was\nstill on his trial before them. He now addressed them with the view\nof explaining to them that if that evidence should be such as he\nbelieved, it would become his duty on behalf of the Crown to join\nwith his learned friend in requesting the Court to direct the jury\nto acquit the prisoner. Not the less on that account would it be the\nduty of the jury to form their own opinion as to the credibility of\nthe fresh evidence which would be brought before them.\n\n\"There won't be much doubt about the credibility,\" said Mr.\nChaffanbrass, rising in his place. \"I am not a bit afraid about the\ncredibility, gentlemen; and I don't think that you need be afraid\neither. You must understand, gentlemen, that I am now going on\ncalling evidence for the defence. My last witness was the Right\nHonourable Mr. Monk, who spoke as to character. My next will be a\nBohemian blacksmith named Praska,--Peter Praska,--who naturally can't\nspeak a word of English, and unfortunately can't speak a word of\nGerman either. But we have got an interpreter, and I daresay we shall\nfind out without much delay what Peter Praska has to tell us.\" Then\nPeter Praska was handed up to the rostrum for the witnesses, and the\nman learned in Czech and also in English was placed close to him, and\nsworn to give a true interpretation.\n\nMealyus the unfortunate one was also in Court, brought in between\ntwo policemen, and the Bohemian blacksmith swore that he had made a\ncertain key on the instructions of the man he now saw. The reader\nneed not be further troubled with all the details of the evidence\nabout the key. It was clearly proved that in a village near to\nPrague a key had been made such as would open Mr. Meager's door in\nNorthumberland Street, and it was also proved that it was made from\na mould supplied by Mealyus. This was done by the joint evidence of\nMr. Meager and of the blacksmith. \"And if I lose my key,\" said the\nreverend gentleman, \"why should I not have another made? Did I ever\ndeny it? This, I think, is very strange.\" But Mr. Emilius was very\nquickly walked back out of the Court between the two policemen, as\nhis presence would not be required in regard to the further evidence\nregarding the bludgeon.\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass, having finished his business with the key, at once\nbegan with the bludgeon. The bludgeon was produced, and was handed\nup to the bench, and inspected by the Chief Justice. The instrument\nexcited great interest. Men rose on tiptoe to look at it even from a\ndistance, and the Prime Minister was envied because for a moment it\nwas placed in his hands. As the large-eyed little boy who had found\nit was not yet six years old, there was a difficulty in perfecting\nthe thread of the evidence. It was not held to be proper to\nadminister an oath to an infant. But in a roundabout way it was\nproved that the identical bludgeon had been picked up in the garden.\nThere was an elaborate surveyor's plan produced of the passage, the\ngarden, and the wall,--with the steps on which it was supposed that\nthe blow had been struck; and the spot was indicated on which the\nchild had said that he had found the weapon. Then certain workers\nin leather were questioned, who agreed in asserting that no such\ninstrument as that handed to them had ever been made in England.\nAfter that, two scientific chemists told the jury that they had\nminutely examined the knob of the instrument with reference to the\ndiscovery of human blood,--but in vain. They were, however, of\nopinion that the man might very readily have been killed by the\ninstrument without any effusion of blood at the moment of the blows.\nThis seemed to the jury to be the less necessary, as three or four\nsurgeons who had examined the murdered man's head had already told\nthem that in all probability there had been no such effusion. When\nthe judges went out to lunch at two o'clock the jury were trembling\nas to their fate for another night.\n\nThe fresh evidence, however, had been completed, and on the return of\nthe Court Mr. Chaffanbrass said that he should only speak a very few\nwords. For a few words he must ask indulgence, though he knew them to\nbe irregular. But it was the speciality of this trial that everything\nin it was irregular, and he did not think that his learned friend the\nAttorney-General would dispute the privilege. The Attorney-General\nsaid nothing, and Mr. Chaffanbrass went on with his little\nspeech,--with which he took up the greatest part of an hour. It was\nthought to have been unnecessary, as nearly all that he said was said\nagain--and was sure to have been so said,--by the judge. It was not\nhis business,--the business of him, Mr. Chaffanbrass,--to accuse\nanother man of the murder of Mr. Bonteen. It was not for him to tell\nthe jury whether there was or was not evidence on which any other man\nshould be sent to trial. But it was his bounden duty in defence of\nhis client to explain to them that a collection of facts tending\nto criminate another man,--which when taken together made a fair\nprobability that another man had committed the crime,--rendered it\nquite out of the question that they should declare his client to be\nguilty. He did not believe that there was a single person in the\nCourt who was not now convinced of the innocence of his client;--but\nit was not permitted to him to trust himself solely to that belief.\nIt was his duty to show them that, of necessity, they must acquit his\nclient. When Mr. Chaffanbrass sat down, the Attorney-General waived\nany right he might have of further reply.\n\nIt was half-past three when the judge began his charge. He would, he\nsaid, do his best to enable the jury to complete their tedious duty,\nso as to return to their families on that night. Indeed he would\ncertainly finish his charge before he rose from the seat, let the\nhour be what it might; and though time must be occupied by him in\ngoing through the evidence and explaining the circumstances of\nthis very singular trial, it might not be improbable that the jury\nwould be able to find their verdict without any great delay among\nthemselves. \"There won't be any delay at all, my lord,\" said the\nsuffering and very irrational salesman. The poor man was again\nrebuked, mildly, and the Chief Justice continued his charge.\n\nAs it occupied four hours in the delivery, of which by far the\ngreater part was taken up in recapitulating and sifting evidence\nwith which the careful reader, if such there be, has already been\nmade too intimately acquainted, the account of it here shall be\nvery short. The nature of circumstantial evidence was explained,\nand the truth of much that had been said in regard to such evidence\nby Mr. Chaffanbrass admitted;--but, nevertheless, it would be\nimpossible,--so said his lordship,--to administer justice if guilt\ncould never be held to have been proved by circumstantial evidence\nalone. In this case it might not improbably seem to them that the\ngentleman who had so long stood before them as a prisoner at the\nbar had been the victim of a most singularly untoward chain of\ncircumstances, from which he would have to be liberated, should he\nbe at last liberated, by another chain of circumstances as singular;\nbut it was his duty to inform them now, after they had heard what he\nmight call the double evidence, that he could not have given it to\nthem as his opinion that the charge had been brought home against the\nprisoner, even had those circumstances of the Bohemian key and of the\nforeign bludgeon never been brought to light. He did not mean to say\nthat the evidence had not justified the trial. He thought that the\ntrial had been fully justified. Nevertheless, had nothing arisen to\npoint to the possibility of guilt in another man, he should not the\nless have found himself bound in duty to explain to them that the\nthread of the evidence against Mr. Finn had been incomplete,--or,\nhe would rather say, the weight of it had been, to his judgment,\ninsufficient. He was the more intent on saying so much, as he was\ndesirous of making it understood that, even had the bludgeon still\nremained buried beneath the leaves, had the manufacturer of that\nkey never been discovered, the great evil would not, he thought,\nhave fallen upon them of punishing the innocent instead of the\nguilty,--that most awful evil of taking innocent blood in their just\nattempt to punish murder by death. As far as he knew, to the best of\nhis belief, that calamity had never fallen upon the country in his\ntime. The administration of the law was so careful of life that the\nopposite evil was fortunately more common. He said so much because he\nwould not wish that this case should be quoted hereafter as showing\nthe possible danger of circumstantial evidence. It had been a case in\nwhich the evidence given as to character alone had been sufficient\nto make him feel that the circumstances which seemed to affect the\nprisoner injuriously could not be taken as establishing his guilt.\nBut now other and imposing circumstances had been brought to light,\nand he was sure that the jury would have no difficulty with their\nverdict. A most frightful murder had no doubt been committed in the\ndead of the night. A gentleman coming home from his club had been\nkilled,--probably by the hand of one who had himself moved in the\ncompany of gentlemen. A plot had been made,--had probably been\nthought of for days and weeks before,--and had been executed with\nextreme audacity, in order that an enemy might be removed. There\ncould, he thought, be but little doubt that Mr. Bonteen had been\nkilled by the instrument found in the garden, and if so, he certainly\nhad not been killed by the prisoner, who could not be supposed\nto have carried two bludgeons in his pocket, and whose quarrel\nwith the murdered man had been so recent as to have admitted of no\npreparation. They had heard the story of Mr. Meager's grey coat, and\nof the construction of the duplicate key for Mr. Meager's house-door.\nIt was not for him to tell them on the present occasion whether these\nstories, and the evidence by which they had been supported, tended\nto affix guilt elsewhere. It was beyond his province to advert to\nsuch probability or possibility; but undoubtedly the circumstances\nmight be taken by them as an assistance, if assistance were needed,\nin coming to a conclusion on the charge against the prisoner.\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said at last, \"I think you will find no difficulty in\nacquitting the prisoner of the murder laid to his charge,\" whereupon\nthe jurymen put their heads together; and the foreman, without half\na minute's delay, declared that they were unanimous, and that they\nfound the prisoner Not Guilty. \"And we are of opinion,\" said the\nforeman, \"that Mr. Finn should not have been put upon his trial on\nsuch evidence as has been brought before us.\"\n\nThe necessity of liberating poor Phineas from the horrors of his\nposition was too urgent to allow of much attention being given at\nthe moment to this protest. \"Mr. Finn,\" said the judge, addressing\nthe poor broken wretch, \"you have been acquitted of the odious and\nabominable charge brought against you, with the concurrence, I am\nsure, not only of those who have heard this trial, but of all your\ncountrymen and countrywomen. I need not say that you will leave that\ndock with no stain on your character. It has, I hope, been some\nconsolation to you in your misfortune to hear the terms in which\nyou have been spoken of by such friends as they who came here to\ngive their testimony on your behalf. It is, and it has been, a great\nsorrow to me to see such a one as you subjected to so unmerited an\nignominy; but a man educated in the laws of his country, as you\nhave been, and understanding its constitution fundamentally, as you\ndo, will probably have acknowledged that, great as has been the\nmisfortune to you personally, nothing more than a proper attempt has\nbeen made to execute justice. I trust that you may speedily find\nyourself able to resume your place among the legislators of the\ncountry.\" Thus Phineas Finn was acquitted, and the judges, collecting\nup their robes, trooped off from the bench, following the long line\nof their assessors who had remained even to that hour to hear the\nlast word of the trial. Mr. Chaffanbrass collected his papers, with\nthe assistance of Mr. Wickerby,--totally disregardful of his junior\ncounsel, and the Attorney and Solicitor-General congratulated each\nother on the successful termination of a very disagreeable piece of\nbusiness.\n\nAnd Phineas was discharged. According to the ordinary meaning of the\nwords he was now to go about his business as he pleased, the law\nhaving no further need of his person. We can understand how in common\ncases the prisoner discharged on his acquittal,--who probably in\nnine cases out of ten is conscious of his own guilt,--may feel the\nsweetness of his freedom and enjoy his immunity from danger with a\nlight heart. He is received probably by his wife or young woman,--or\nperhaps, having no wife or young woman to receive him, betakes\nhimself to his usual haunts. The interest which has been felt in his\ncareer is over, and he is no longer the hero of an hour;--but he is a\nfree man, and may drink his gin-and-water where he pleases. Perhaps\na small admiring crowd may welcome him as he passes out into the\nstreet, but he has become nobody before he reaches the corner. But it\ncould not be so with this discharged prisoner,--either as regarded\nhimself and his own feelings, or as regarded his friends. When\nthe moment came he had hardly as yet thought about the immediate\nfuture,--had not considered how he would live, or where, during\nthe next few months. The sensations of the moment had been so full,\nsometimes of agony and at others of anticipated triumph, that he had\nnot attempted as yet to make for himself any schemes. The Duchess\nof Omnium had suggested that he would be received back into society\nwith an elaborate course of fashionable dinners; but that view of his\nreturn to the world had certainly not occurred to him. When he was\nled down from the dock he hardly knew whither he was being taken, and\nwhen he found himself in a small room attached to the Court, clasped\non one arm by Mr. Low and on the other by Lord Chiltern, he did not\nknow what they would propose to him,--nor had he considered what\nanswer he would make to any proposition. \"At last you are safe,\" said\nMr. Low.\n\n\"But think what he has suffered,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\nPhineas looked round to see if there was any other friend present.\nCertainly among all his friends he had thought most of her who had\ntravelled half across Europe for evidence to save him. He had seen\nMadame Goesler last on the evening preceding the night of the murder,\nand had not even heard from her since. But he had been told what she\nhad done for him, and now he had almost fancied that he would have\nfound her waiting for him. He smiled first at the one man and then\nat the other, and made an effort to carry himself with his ordinary\ntranquillity. \"It will be all right now, I dare say,\" he said. \"I\nwonder whether I could have a glass of water.\"\n\nHe sat down while the water was brought to him, and his two friends\nstood over him, hardly knowing how to do more than support him by\ntheir presence.\n\nThen Lord Cantrip made his way into the room. He had sat on the bench\nto the last, whereas the other two had gone down to receive the\nprisoner when acquitted;--and with him came Sir Harry Coldfoot, the\nHome Secretary. \"My friend,\" said the former, \"the bitter day has\npassed over you, and I hope that the bitterness will soon pass away\nalso.\" Phineas again attempted to smile as he held the hand of the\nman with whom he had formerly been associated in office.\n\n\"I should not intrude, Mr. Finn,\" said Sir Harry, \"did I not feel\nmyself bound in a special manner to express my regret at the great\ntrouble to which you have been subjected.\" Phineas rose, and\nbowed stiffly. He had conceived that every one connected with the\nadministration of the law had believed him to be guilty, and none in\nhis present mood could be dear to him but they who from the beginning\ntrusted in his innocence. \"I am requested by Mr. Gresham,\" continued\nSir Harry, \"to express to you his entire sympathy, and his joy that\nall this is at last over.\" Phineas tried to make some little speech,\nbut utterly failed. Then Sir Harry left them, and he burst out into\ntears.\n\n\"Who can be surprised?\" said Lord Cantrip. \"The marvel is that he\nshould have been able to bear it so long.\"\n\n\"It would have crushed me utterly, long since,\" said the other lord.\nThen there was a question asked as to what he would do, and Mr. Low\nproposed that he should be allowed to take Phineas to his own house\nfor a few days. His wife, he said, had known their friend so long and\nso intimately that she might perhaps be able to make herself more\nserviceable than any other lady, and at their house Phineas could\nreceive his sisters just as he would at his own. His sisters had been\nlodging near the prison almost ever since the committal, and it had\nbeen thought well to remove them to Mr. Low's house in order that\nthey might meet their brother there.\n\n\"I think I'll go to my--own room--in Marlborough Street.\" These were\nthe first intelligible words he had uttered since he had been led out\nof the dock, and to that resolution he adhered. Lord Cantrip offered\nthe retirements of a country house belonging to himself within an\nhour's journey of London, and Lord Chiltern declared that Harrington\nHall, which Phineas knew, was altogether at his service,--but Phineas\ndecided in favour of Mrs. Bunce, and to Great Marlborough Street he\nwas taken by Mr. Low.\n\n\"I'll come to you to-morrow,--with my wife,\"--said Lord Chiltern, as\nhe was going.\n\n\"Not to-morrow, Chiltern. But tell your wife how deeply I value her\nfriendship.\" Lord Cantrip also offered to come, but was asked to\nwait awhile. \"I am afraid I am hardly fit for visitors yet. All the\nstrength seems to have been knocked out of me this last week.\"\n\nMr. Low accompanied him to his lodgings, and then handed him over to\nMrs. Bunce, promising that his two sisters should come to him early\non the following morning. On that evening he would prefer to be quite\nalone. He would not allow the barrister even to go upstairs with him;\nand when he had entered his room, almost rudely begged his weeping\nlandlady to leave him.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Phineas, let me do something for you,\" said the poor woman.\n\"You have not had a bit of anything all day. Let me get you just a\ncup of tea and a chop.\"\n\nIn truth he had dined when the judges went out to their lunch,--dined\nas he had been wont to dine since the trial had been commenced,--and\nwanted nothing. She might bring him tea, he said, if she would leave\nhim for an hour. And then at last he was alone. He stood up in the\nmiddle of the room, stretching forth his hands, and putting one\nfirst to his breast and then to his brow, feeling himself as though\ndoubting his own identity. Could it be that the last week had been\nreal,--that everything had not been a dream? Had he in truth been\nsuspected of a murder and tried for his life? And then he thought of\nhim who had been murdered, of Mr. Bonteen, his enemy. Was he really\ngone,--the man who the other day was to have been Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer,--the scornful, arrogant, loud, boastful man? He had\nhardly thought of Mr. Bonteen before, during these weeks of his own\nincarceration. He had heard all the details of the murder with a\nfulness that had been at last complete. The man who had oppressed\nhim, and whom he had at times almost envied, was indeed gone, and the\nworld for awhile had believed that he, Phineas Finn, had been the\nman's murderer!\n\nAnd now what should be his own future life? One thing seemed certain\nto him. He could never again go into the House of Commons, and sit\nthere, an ordinary man of business, with other ordinary men. He had\nbeen so hacked and hewed about, so exposed to the gaze of the vulgar,\nso mauled by the public, that he could never more be anything but the\nwretched being who had been tried for the murder of his enemy. The\npith had been taken out of him, and he was no longer a man fit for\nuse. He could never more enjoy that freedom from self-consciousness,\nthat inner tranquillity of spirit, which are essential to public\nutility. Then he remembered certain lines which had long been\nfamiliar to him, and he repeated them aloud, with some conceit that\nthey were apposite to him:--\n\n   The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,--\n   For the reed that grows never more again\n      As a reed with the reeds in the river.\n\nHe sat drinking his tea, still thinking of himself,--knowing how\ninfinitely better it would be for him that he should indulge in no\nsuch thought, till an idea struck him, and he got up, and, drawing\nback the blinds from the open window, looked out into the night. It\nwas the last day of June, and the weather was very sultry; but the\nnight was dark, and it was now near midnight. On a sudden he took\nhis hat, and feeling with a smile for the latch-key which he always\ncarried in his pocket,--thinking of the latch-key which had been made\nat Prague for the lock of a house in Northumberland Street, New Road,\nhe went down to the front door. \"You'll be back soon, Mr. Finn, won't\nyou now?\" said Mrs. Bunce, who had heard his step, and had remained\nup, thinking it better this, the first night of his return, not to\nrest till he had gone to his bed.\n\n\"Why should I be back soon?\" he said, turning upon her. But then\nhe remembered that she had been one of those who were true to him,\nand he took her hand and was gracious to her. \"I will be back soon,\nMrs. Bunce, and you need fear nothing. But recollect how little\nI have had of liberty lately. I have not even had a walk for six\nweeks. You cannot wonder that I should wish to roam about a little.\"\nNevertheless she would have preferred that he should not have gone\nout all alone on that night.\n\nHe had taken off the black morning coat which he had worn during the\ntrial, and had put on that very grey garment by which it had been\nsought to identify him with the murderer. So clad he crossed Regent\nStreet into Hanover Square, and from thence went a short way down\nBond Street, and by Bruton Street into Berkeley Square. He took\nexactly the reverse of the route by which he had returned home\nfrom the club on the night of the murder. Every now and then he\ntrembled as he passed some figure which might be that of a man who\nwould recognise him. But he walked fast, and went on till he came\nto the spot at which the steps descend from the street into the\npassage,--the very spot at which the murder had been committed. He\nlooked down it with an awful dread, and stood there as though he were\nfascinated, thinking of all the details which he had heard throughout\nthe trial. Then he looked around him, and listened whether there were\nany step approaching through the passage. Hearing none and seeing no\none he at last descended, and for the first time in his life passed\nthrough that way into Bolton Row. Here it was that the wretch of whom\nhe had now heard so much had waited for his enemy,--the wretch for\nwhom during the last six weeks he had been mistaken. Heavens!--that\nmen who had known him should have believed him to have done such a\ndeed as that! He remembered well having shown the life-preserver to\nErle and Fitzgibbon at the door of the club; and it had been thought\nthat after having so shown it he had used it for the purpose to which\nin his joke he had alluded! Were men so blind, so ignorant of nature,\nso little capable of discerning the truth as this? Then he went on\ntill he came to the end of Clarges Street, and looked up the mews\nopposite to it,--the mews from which the man had been seen to hurry.\nThe place was altogether unknown to him. He had never thought whither\nit had led when passing it on his way up from Piccadilly to the club.\nBut now he entered the mews so as to test the evidence that had been\ngiven, and found that it brought him by a turn close up to the spot\nat which he had been described as having been last seen by Erle\nand Fitzgibbon. When there he went on, and crossed the street, and\nlooking back saw the club was lighted up. Then it struck him for the\nfirst time that it was the night of the week on which the members\nwere wont to assemble. Should he pluck up courage, and walk in among\nthem? He had not lost his right of entry there because he had been\naccused of murder. He was the same now as heretofore,--if he could\nonly fancy himself to be the same. Why not go in, and have done with\nall this? He would be the wonder of the club for twenty minutes, and\nthen it would all be over. He stood close under the shade of a heavy\nbuilding as he thought of this, but he found that he could not do it.\nHe had known from the beginning that he could not do it. How callous,\nhow hard, how heartless, must he have been, had such a course been\npossible to him! He again repeated the lines to himself--\n\n   The reed that grows never more again\n      As a reed with the reeds in the river.\n\nHe felt sure that never again would he enter that room, in which no\ndoubt all those assembled were now talking about him.\n\nAs he returned home he tried to make out for himself some plan for\nhis future life,--but, interspersed with any idea that he could weave\nwere the figures of two women, Lady Laura Kennedy and Madame Max\nGoesler. The former could be nothing to him but a friend; and though\nno other friend would love him as she loved him, yet she could not\ninfluence his life. She was very wealthy, but her wealth could be\nnothing to him. She would heap it all upon him if he would take\nit. He understood and knew that. Taking no pride to himself that\nit was so, feeling no conceit in her love, he was conscious of her\ndevotion to him. He was poor, broken in spirit, and almost without a\nfuture;--and yet could her devotion avail him nothing!\n\nBut how might it be with that other woman? Were she, after all that\nhad passed between them, to consent to be his wife,--and it might be\nthat she would consent,--how would the world be with him then? He\nwould be known as Madame Goesler's husband, and have to sit at the\nbottom of her table,--and be talked of as the man who had been tried\nfor the murder of Mr. Bonteen. Look at it in which way he might, he\nthought that no life could any longer be possible to him in London.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nPHINEAS AFTER THE TRIAL.\n\n\nTen days passed by, and Phineas Finn had not been out of his lodgings\ntill after daylight, and then he only prowled about in the manner\ndescribed in the last chapter. His sisters had returned to Ireland,\nand he saw no one, even in his own room, but two or three of his most\nintimate friends. Among those Mr. Low and Lord Chiltern were the most\nfrequently with him, but Fitzgibbon, Barrington Erle, and Mr. Monk\nhad also been admitted. People had called by the hundred, till Mrs.\nBunce was becoming almost tired of her lodger's popularity; but they\ncame only to inquire,--because it had been reported that Mr. Finn was\nnot well after his imprisonment. The Duchess of Omnium had written\nto him various notes, asking when he would come to her, and what\nshe could do for him. Would he dine, would he spend a quiet evening,\nwould he go to Matching? Finally, would he become her guest and the\nDuke's next September for the partridge shooting? They would have a\nfew friends with them, and Madame Goesler would be one of the number.\nHaving had this by him for a week, he had not as yet answered the\ninvitation. He had received two or three notes from Lady Laura, who\nhad frankly explained to him that if he were really ill she would\nof course go to him, but that as matters stood she could not do so\nwithout displeasing her brother. He had answered each note by an\nassurance that his first visit should be made in Portman Square. To\nMadame Goesler he had written a letter of thanks,--a letter which had\nin truth cost him some pains. \"I know,\" he said, \"for how much I have\nto thank you, but I do not know in what words to do it. I ought to\nbe with you telling you in person of my gratitude; but I must own to\nyou that for the present what has occurred has so unmanned me that\nI am unfit for the interview. I should only weep in your presence\nlike a school-girl, and you would despise me.\" It was a long letter,\ncontaining many references to the circumstances of the trial, and to\nhis own condition of mind throughout its period. Her answer to him,\nwhich was very short, was as follows:--\n\n\n   Park Lane, Sunday--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,\n\n   I can well understand that for a while you should be too\n   agitated by what has passed to see your friends. Remember,\n   however, that you owe it to them as well as to yourself\n   not to sink into seclusion. Send me a line when you think\n   that you can come to me that I may be at home. My journey\n   to Prague was nothing. You forget that I am constantly\n   going to Vienna on business connected with my own property\n   there. Prague lies but a few hours out of the route.\n\n   Most sincerely yours,\n\n   M. M. G.\n\n\nHis friends who did see him urged him constantly to bestir himself,\nand Mr. Monk pressed him very much to come down to the House. \"Walk\nin with me to-night, and take your seat as though nothing had\nhappened,\" said Mr. Monk.\n\n\"But so much has happened.\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened to alter your outward position as a man. No\ndoubt many will flock round you to congratulate you, and your first\nhalf-hour will be disagreeable; but then the thing will have been\ndone. You owe it to your constituents to do so.\" Then Phineas for the\nfirst time expressed an opinion that he would resign his seat,--that\nhe would take the Chiltern Hundreds, and retire altogether from\npublic life.\n\n\"Pray do nothing of the kind,\" said Mr. Monk.\n\n\"I do not think you quite understand,\" said Phineas, \"how such an\nordeal as this works upon a man, how it may change a man, and knock\nout of him what little strength there ever was there. I feel that I\nam broken, past any patching up or mending. Of course it ought not to\nbe so. A man should be made of better stuff;--but one is only what\none is.\"\n\n\"We'll put off the discussion for another week,\" said Mr. Monk.\n\n\"There came a letter to me when I was in prison from one of the\nleading men in Tankerville, saying that I ought to resign. I know\nthey all thought that I was guilty. I do not care to sit for a place\nwhere I was so judged,--even if I was fit any longer for a seat in\nParliament.\" He had never felt convinced that Mr. Monk had himself\nbelieved with confidence his innocence, and he spoke with soreness,\nand almost with anger.\n\n\"A letter from one individual should never be allowed to create\ninterference between a member and his constituents. It should simply\nbe answered to that effect, and then ignored. As to the belief of the\ntownspeople in your innocence,--what is to guide you? I believed you\ninnocent with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"But there was always sufficient possibility of your guilt to prevent\na rational man from committing himself to the expression of an\nabsolute conviction.\" The young member's brow became black as he\nheard this. \"I can see that I offend you by saying so,--but if you\nwill think of it, I must be right. You were on your trial; and I as\nyour friend was bound to await the result,--with much confidence,\nbecause I knew you; but with no conviction, because both you and I\nare human and fallible. If the electors at Tankerville, or any great\nproportion of them, express a belief that you are unfit to represent\nthem because of what has occurred, I shall be the last to recommend\nyou to keep your seat;--but I shall be surprised indeed if they\nshould do so. If there were a general election to-morrow, I should\nregard your seat as one of the safest in England.\"\n\nBoth Mr. Low and Lord Chiltern were equally urgent with him to\nreturn to his usual mode of life,--using different arguments for\ntheir purpose. Lord Chiltern told him plainly that he was weak and\nwomanly,--or rather that he would be were he to continue to dread\nthe faces of his fellow-creatures. The Master of the Brake hounds\nhimself was a man less gifted than Phineas Finn, and therefore hardly\ncapable of understanding the exaggerated feelings of the man who had\nrecently been tried for his life. Lord Chiltern was affectionate,\ntender-hearted, and true;--but there were no vacillating fibres in\nhis composition. The balance which regulated his conduct was firmly\nset, and went well. The clock never stopped, and wanted but little\nlooking after. But the works were somewhat rough, and the seconds\nwere not scored. He had, however, been quite true to Phineas during\nthe dark time, and might now say what he pleased. \"I am womanly,\"\nsaid Phineas. \"I begin to feel it. But I can't alter my nature.\"\n\n\"I never was so much surprised in my life,\" said Lord Chiltern. \"When\nI used to look at you in the dock, by heaven I envied you your pluck\nand strength.\"\n\n\"I was burning up the stock of coals, Chiltern.\"\n\n\"You'll come all right after a few weeks. You've been knocked out of\ntime;--that's the truth of it.\"\n\nMr. Low treated his patient with more indulgence; but he also was\nsurprised, and hardly understood the nature of the derangement of the\nmechanism in the instrument which he was desirous of repairing. \"I\nshould go abroad for a few months if I were you,\" said Mr. Low.\n\n\"I should stick at the first inn I got to,\" said Phineas. \"I think I\nam better here. By and bye I shall travel, I dare say,--all over the\nworld, as far as my money will last. But for the present I am only\nfit to sit still.\"\n\nMrs. Low had seen him more than once, and had been very kind to him;\nbut she also failed to understand. \"I always thought that he was such\na manly fellow,\" she said to her husband.\n\n\"If you mean personal courage, there is no doubt that he possesses\nit,--as completely now, probably, as ever.\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--he could go over to Flanders and let that lord shoot at\nhim; and he could ride brutes of horses, and not care about breaking\nhis neck. That's not what I mean. I thought that he could face the\nworld with dignity;--but now it seems that he breaks down.\"\n\n\"He has been very roughly used, my dear.\"\n\n\"So he has,--and tenderly used too. Nobody has had better friends. I\nthought he would have been more manly.\"\n\nThe property of manliness in a man is a great possession, but perhaps\nthere is none that is less understood,--which is more generally\naccorded where it does not exist, or more frequently disallowed where\nit prevails. There are not many who ever make up their minds as to\nwhat constitutes manliness, or even inquire within themselves upon\nthe subject. The woman's error, occasioned by her natural desire for\na master, leads her to look for a certain outward magnificence of\ndemeanour, a pretended indifference to stings and little torments,\na would-be superiority to the bread-and-butter side of life, an\nunreal assumption of personal grandeur. But a robe of State such as\nthis,--however well the garment may be worn with practice,--can never\nbe the raiment natural to a man; and men, dressing themselves in\nwomen's eyes, have consented to walk about in buckram. A composure of\nthe eye, which has been studied, a reticence as to the little things\nof life, a certain slowness of speech unless the occasion call for\npassion, an indifference to small surroundings, these,--joined, of\ncourse, with personal bravery,--are supposed to constitute manliness.\nThat personal bravery is required in the composition of manliness\nmust be conceded, though, of all the ingredients needed, it is the\nlowest in value. But the first requirement of all must be described\nby a negative. Manliness is not compatible with affectation. Women's\nvirtues, all feminine attributes, may be marred by affectation, but\nthe virtues and the vice may co-exist. An affected man, too, may\nbe honest, may be generous, may be pious;--but surely he cannot\nbe manly. The self-conscious assumption of any outward manner,\nthe striving to add,--even though it be but a tenth of a cubit to\nthe height,--is fatal, and will at once banish the all but divine\nattribute. Before the man can be manly, the gifts which make him\nso must be there, collected by him slowly, unconsciously, as are\nhis bones, his flesh, and his blood. They cannot be put on like a\ngarment for the nonce,--as may a little learning. A man cannot become\nfaithful to his friends, unsuspicious before the world, gentle with\nwomen, loving with children, considerate to his inferiors, kindly\nwith servants, tender-hearted with all,--and at the same time be\nfrank, of open speech, with springing eager energies,--simply because\nhe desires it. These things, which are the attributes of manliness,\nmust come of training on a nature not ignoble. But they are the very\nopposites, the antipodes, the direct antagonism, of that staring,\nposed, bewhiskered and bewigged deportment, that _nil admirari_,\nself-remembering assumption of manliness, that endeavour of twopence\nhalfpenny to look as high as threepence, which, when you prod it\nthrough, has in it nothing deeper than deportment. We see the two\nthings daily, side by side, close to each other. Let a man put\nhis hat down, and you shall say whether he has deposited it with\naffectation or true nature. The natural man will probably be manly.\nThe affected man cannot be so.\n\nMrs. Low was wrong when she accused our hero of being unmanly. Had\nhis imagination been less alert in looking into the minds of men, and\nin picturing to himself the thoughts of others in reference to the\ncrime with which he had been charged, he would not now have shrunk\nfrom contact with his fellow-creatures as he did. But he could not\npretend to be other than he was. During the period of his danger,\nwhen men had thought that he would be hung,--and when he himself had\nbelieved that it would be so,--he had borne himself bravely without\nany conscious effort. When he had confronted the whole Court with\nthat steady courage which had excited Lord Chiltern's admiration, and\nhad looked the Bench in the face as though he at least had no cause\nto quail, he had known nothing of what he was doing. His features had\nanswered the helm from his heart, but had not been played upon by his\nintellect. And it was so with him now. The reaction had overcome him,\nand he could not bring himself to pretend that it was not so. The\ntears would come to his eyes, and he would shiver and shake like one\nstruck by palsy.\n\nMr. Monk came to him often, and was all but forgiven for the apparent\ndefection in his faith. \"I have made up my mind to one thing,\"\nPhineas said to him at the end of the ten days.\n\n\"And what is the one thing?\"\n\n\"I will give up my seat.\"\n\n\"I do not see a shadow of a reason for it.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless I will do it. Indeed, I have already written to Mr.\nRatler for the Hundreds. There may be and probably are men down\nat Tankerville who still think that I am guilty. There is an\noffensiveness in murder which degrades a man even by the accusation.\nI suppose it wouldn't do for you to move for the new writ.\"\n\n\"Ratler will do it, as a matter of course. No doubt there will be\nexpressions of great regret, and my belief is that they will return\nyou again.\"\n\n\"If so, they'll have to do it without my presence.\"\n\nMr. Ratler did move for a new writ for the borough of Tankerville,\nand within a fortnight of his restoration to liberty Phineas Finn was\nno longer a Member of Parliament. It cannot be alleged that there\nwas any reason for what he did, and yet the doing of it for the time\nrather increased than diminished his popularity. Both Mr. Gresham and\nMr. Daubeny expressed their regret in the House, and Mr. Monk said a\nfew words respecting his friend, which were very touching. He ended\nby expressing a hope that they soon might see him there again, and an\nopinion that he was a man peculiarly fitted by the tone of his mind,\nand the nature of his intellect, for the duties of Parliament.\n\nThen at last, when all this had been settled, he went to Lord\nBrentford's house in Portman Square. He had promised that that should\nbe the first house he would visit, and he was as good as his word.\nOne evening he crept out, and walked slowly along Oxford Street, and\nknocked timidly at the door. As he did so he longed to be told that\nLady Laura was not at home. But Lady Laura was at home,--as a matter\nof course. In those days she never went into society, and had not\npassed an evening away from her father's house since Mr. Kennedy's\ndeath. He was shown up into the drawing-room in which she sat, and\nthere he found her--alone. \"Oh, Phineas, I am so glad you have come.\"\n\n\"I have done as I said, you see.\"\n\n\"I could not go to you when they told me that you were ill. You will\nhave understood all that?\"\n\n\"Yes; I understand.\"\n\n\"People are so hard, and cold, and stiff, and cruel, that one can\nnever do what one feels, oneself, to be right. So you have given up\nyour seat.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I am no longer a Member of Parliament.\"\n\n\"Barrington says that they will certainly re-elect you.\"\n\n\"We shall see. You may be sure at any rate of this,--that I shall\nnever ask them to do so. Things seem to be so different now from what\nthey did. I don't care for the seat. It all seems to be a bore and a\ntrouble. What does it matter who sits in Parliament? The fight goes\non just the same. The same falsehoods are acted. The same mock truths\nare spoken. The same wrong reasons are given. The same personal\nmotives are at work.\"\n\n\"And yet, of all believers in Parliament, you used to be the most\nfaithful.\"\n\n\"One has time to think of things, Lady Laura, when one lies in\nNewgate. It seems to me to be an eternity of time since they locked\nme up. And as for that trial, which they tell me lasted a week, I\nlook back at it till the beginning is so distant that I can hardly\nremember it. But I have resolved that I will never talk of it again.\nLady Chiltern is out probably.\"\n\n\"Yes;--she and Oswald are dining with the Baldocks.\"\n\n\"She is well?\"\n\n\"Yes;--and most anxious to see you. Will you go to their place in\nSeptember?\"\n\nHe had almost made up his mind that if he went anywhere in September\nhe would go to Matching Priory, accepting the offer of the Duchess\nof Omnium; but he did not dare to say so to Lady Laura, because she\nwould have known that Madame Goesler also would be there. And he had\nnot as yet accepted the invitation, and was still in doubt whether he\nwould not escape by himself instead of attempting to return into the\ngrooves of society. \"I think not;--I am hardly as yet sufficiently\nmaster of myself to know what I shall do.\"\n\n\"They will be much disappointed.\"\n\n\"And you?--what will you do?\"\n\n\"I shall not go there. I am told that I ought to visit Loughlinter,\nand I suppose I shall. Oswald has promised to go down with me before\nthe end of the month, but he will not remain above a day or two.\"\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"We shall leave him at Saulsby. I cannot look it all in the face\nyet. It is not possible that I should remain all alone in that great\nhouse. The people all around would hate and despise me. I think\nViolet will come down with me, but of course she cannot remain there.\nOswald must go to Harrington because of the hunting. It has become\nthe business of his life. And she must go with him.\"\n\n\"You will return to Saulsby.\"\n\n\"I cannot say. They seem to think that I should live at\nLoughlinter;--but I cannot live there alone.\"\n\nHe soon took leave of her, and did so with no warmer expressions of\nregard on either side than have here been given. Then he crept back\nto his lodgings, and she sat weeping alone in her father's house.\nWhen he had come to her during her husband's lifetime at Dresden, or\neven when she had visited him at his prison, it had been better than\nthis.\n\n\n[Illustration: And she sat weeping alone in her father's house.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nTHE DUKE'S FIRST COUSIN.\n\n\nOur pages have lately been taken up almost exclusively with the\ntroubles of Phineas Finn, and indeed have so far not unfairly\nrepresented the feelings and interest of people generally at the\ntime. Not to have talked of Phineas Finn from the middle of May to\nthe middle of July in that year would have exhibited great ignorance\nor a cynical disposition. But other things went on also. Moons\nwaxed and waned; children were born; marriages were contracted; and\nthe hopes and fears of the little world around did not come to an\nend because Phineas Finn was not to be hung. Among others who had\ninterests of their own there was poor Adelaide Palliser, whom we last\nsaw under the affliction of Mr. Spooner's love,--but who before that\nhad encountered the much deeper affliction of a quarrel with her own\nlover. She had desired him to free her,--and he had gone. Indeed,\nas to his going at that moment there had been no alternative, as\nhe considered himself to have been turned out of Lord Chiltern's\nhouse. The red-headed lord, in the fierceness of his defence of Miss\nPalliser, had told the lover that under such and such circumstances\nhe could not be allowed to remain at Harrington Hall. Lord Chiltern\nhad said something about \"his roof.\" Now, when a host questions the\npropriety of a guest remaining under his roof, the guest is obliged\nto go. Gerard Maule had gone; and, having offended his sweetheart\nby a most impolite allusion to Boulogne, had been forced to go as\na rejected lover. From that day to this he had done nothing,--not\nbecause he was contented with the lot assigned to him, for every\nmorning, as he lay on his bed, which he usually did till twelve,\nhe swore to himself that nothing should separate him from Adelaide\nPalliser,--but simply because to do nothing was customary with him.\n\"What is a man to do?\" he not unnaturally asked his friend Captain\nBoodle at the club. \"Let her out on the grass for a couple of\nmonths,\" said Captain Boodle, \"and she'll come up as clean as a\nwhistle. When they get these humours there's nothing like giving them\na run.\" Captain Boodle undoubtedly had the reputation of being very\ngreat in council on such matters; but it must not be supposed that\nGerard Maule was contented to take his advice implicitly. He was\nunhappy, ill at ease, half conscious that he ought to do something,\nfull of regrets,--but very idle.\n\nIn the meantime Miss Palliser, who had the finer nature of the two,\nsuffered grievously. The Spooner affair was but a small addition to\nher misfortune. She could get rid of Mr. Spooner,--of any number of\nMr. Spooners; but how should she get back to her the man she loved?\nWhen young ladies quarrel with their lovers it is always presumed,\nespecially in books, that they do not wish to get them back. It is to\nbe understood that the loss to them is as nothing. Miss Smith begs\nthat Mr. Jones may be assured that he is not to consider her at all.\nIf he is pleased to separate, she will be at any rate quite as well\npleased,--probably a great deal better. No doubt she had loved him\nwith all her heart, but that will make no difference to her, if he\nwishes,--to be off. Upon the whole Miss Smith thinks that she would\nprefer such an arrangement, in spite of her heart. Adelaide Palliser\nhad said something of the kind. As Gerard Maule had regarded her\nas a \"trouble,\" and had lamented that prospect of \"Boulogne\" which\nmarriage had presented to his eyes, she had dismissed him with a few\neasily spoken words. She had assured him that no such troubles need\nweigh upon him. No doubt they had been engaged;--but, as far as she\nwas concerned, the remembrance of that need not embarrass him. And so\nshe and Lord Chiltern between them had sent him away. But how was she\nto get him back again?\n\nWhen she came to think it over, she acknowledged to herself that it\nwould be all the world to her to have him back. To have him at all\nhad been all the world to her. There had been nothing peculiarly\nheroic about him, nor had she ever regarded him as a hero. She\nhad known his faults and weaknesses, and was probably aware\nthat he was inferior to herself in character and intellect. But,\nnevertheless, she had loved him. To her he had been, though not\nheroic, sufficiently a man to win her heart. He was a gentleman,\npleasant-mannered, pleasant to look at, pleasant to talk to, not\neducated in the high sense of the word, but never making himself\nridiculous by ignorance. He was the very antipodes of a Spooner, and\nhe was,--or rather had been,--her lover. She did not wish to change.\nShe did not recognise the possibility of changing. Though she had\ntold him that he might go if he pleased, to her his going would be\nthe loss of everything. What would life be without a lover,--without\nthe prospect of marriage? And there could be no other lover. There\ncould be no further prospect should he take her at her word.\n\nOf all this Lord Chiltern understood nothing, but Lady Chiltern\nunderstood it all. To his thinking the young man had behaved so badly\nthat it was incumbent on them all to send him away and so have done\nwith him. If the young man wanted to quarrel with any one, there was\nhe to be quarrelled with. The thing was a trouble, and the sooner\nthey got to the end of it the better. But Lady Chiltern understood\nmore than that. She could not prevent the quarrel as it came,--or was\ncoming; but she knew that \"the quarrel of lovers is the renewal of\nlove.\" At any rate, the woman always desires that it may be so, and\nendeavours to reconcile the parted ones. \"You'll see him in London,\"\nLady Chiltern had said to her friend.\n\n\"I do not want to see him,\" said Adelaide proudly.\n\n\"But he'll want to see you, and then,--after a time,--you'll want to\nsee him. I don't believe in quarrels, you know.\"\n\n\"It is better that we should part, Lady Chiltern, if marrying will\ncause him--dismay. I begin to feel that we are too poor to be\nmarried.\"\n\n\"A great deal poorer people than you are married every day. Of course\npeople can't be equally rich. You'll do very well if you'll only be\npatient, and not refuse to speak to him when he comes to you.\" This\nwas said at Harrington after Lady Chiltern had returned from her\nfirst journey up to London. That visit had been very short, and Miss\nPalliser had been left alone at the hall. We already know how Mr.\nSpooner took advantage of her solitude. After that, Miss Palliser was\nto accompany the Chilterns to London, and she was there with them\nwhen Phineas Finn was acquitted. By that time she had brought herself\nto acknowledge to her friend Lady Chiltern that it would perhaps be\ndesirable that Mr. Maule should return. If he did not do so, and that\nat once, there must come an end to her life in England. She must go\naway to Italy,--altogether beyond the reach of Gerard Maule. In such\ncase all the world would have collapsed for her, and she would become\nthe martyr of a shipwreck. And yet the more that she confessed to\nherself that she loved the man so well that she could not part with\nhim, the more angry she was with him for having told her that, when\nmarried, they must live at Boulogne.\n\nThe house in Portman Square had been practically given up by Lord\nBrentford to his son; but nevertheless the old Earl and Lady Laura\nhad returned to it when they reached England from Dresden. It was,\nhowever, large, and now the two families,--if the Earl and his\ndaughter can be called a family,--were lodging there together. The\nEarl troubled them but little, living mostly in his own rooms, and\nLady Laura never went out with them. But there was something in the\npresence of the old man and the widow which prevented the house from\nbeing gay as it might have been. There were no parties in Portman\nSquare. Now and then a few old friends dined there; but at the\npresent moment Gerard Maule could not be admitted as an old friend.\nWhen Adelaide had been a fortnight in London she had not as yet seen\nGerard Maule or heard a word from him. She had been to balls and\nconcerts, to dinner parties and the play; but no one had as yet\nbrought them together. She did know that he was in town. She was able\nto obtain so much information of him as that. But he never came to\nPortman Square, and had evidently concluded that the quarrel--was to\nbe a quarrel.\n\nAmong other balls in London that July there had been one at the\nDuchess of Omnium's. This had been given after the acquittal of\nPhineas Finn, though fixed before that great era. \"Nothing on earth\nshould have made me have it while he was in prison,\" the Duchess\nhad said. But Phineas was acquitted, and cakes and ale again became\npermissible. The ball had been given, and had been very grand.\nPhineas had been asked, but of course had not gone. Madame Goesler,\nwho was a great heroine since her successful return from Prague, had\nshown herself there for a few minutes. Lady Chiltern had gone, and of\ncourse taken Adelaide. \"We are first cousins,\" the Duke said to Miss\nPalliser,--for the Duke did steal a moment from his work in which to\nwalk through his wife's drawing-room. Adelaide smiled and nodded, and\nlooked pleased as she gave her hand to her great relative. \"I hope we\nshall see more of each other than we have done,\" said the Duke. \"We\nhave all been sadly divided, haven't we?\" Then he said a word to his\nwife, expressing his opinion that Adelaide Palliser was a nice girl,\nand asking her to be civil to so near a relative.\n\nThe Duchess had heard all about Gerard Maule and the engagement. She\nalways did hear all about everything. And on this evening she asked a\nquestion or two from Lady Chiltern. \"Do you know,\" she said, \"I have\nan appointment to-morrow with your husband?\"\n\n\"I did not know;--but I won't interfere to prevent it, now you are\ngenerous enough to tell me.\"\n\n\"I wish you would, because I don't know what to say to him. He is to\ncome about that horrid wood, where the foxes won't get themselves\nborn and bred as foxes ought to do. How can I help it? I'd send down\na whole Lying-in Hospital for the foxes if I thought that that would\ndo any good.\"\n\n\"Lord Chiltern thinks it's the shooting.\"\n\n\"But where is a person to shoot if he mayn't shoot in his own woods?\nNot that the Duke cares about the shooting for himself. He could not\nhit a pheasant sitting on a haystack, and wouldn't know one if he saw\nit. And he'd rather that there wasn't such a thing as a pheasant in\nthe world. He cares for nothing but farthings. But what is a man to\ndo? Or, rather, what is a woman to do?--for he tells me that I must\nsettle it.\"\n\n\"Lord Chiltern says that Mr. Fothergill has the foxes destroyed. I\nsuppose Mr. Fothergill may do as he pleases if the Duke gives him\npermission.\"\n\n\"I hate Mr. Fothergill, if that'll do any good,\" said the Duchess;\n\"and we wish we could get rid of him altogether. But that, you know,\nis impossible. When one has an old man on one's shoulders one never\ncan get rid of him. He is my incubus; and then you see Trumpeton Wood\nis such a long way from us at Matching that I can't say I want the\nshooting for myself. And I never go to Gatherum if I can help it.\nSuppose we made out that the Duke wanted to let the shooting?\"\n\n\"Lord Chiltern would take it at once.\"\n\n\"But the Duke wouldn't really let it, you know. I'll lay awake at\nnight and think about it. And now tell me about Adelaide Palliser. Is\nshe to be married?\"\n\n\"I hope so,--sooner or later.\"\n\n\"There's a quarrel or something;--isn't there? She's the Duke's first\ncousin, and we should be so sorry that things shouldn't go pleasantly\nwith her. And she's a very good-looking girl, too. Would she like to\ncome down to Matching?\"\n\n\"She has some idea of going back to Italy.\"\n\n\"And leaving her lover behind her! Oh, dear, that will be very bad.\nShe'd much better come to Matching, and then I'd ask the man to come\ntoo. Mr. Maud, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Gerard Maule.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; Maule. If it's the kind of thing that ought to be, I'd\nmanage it in a week. If you get a young man down into a country\nhouse, and there has been anything at all between them, I don't see\nhow he is to escape. Isn't there some trouble about money?\"\n\n\"They wouldn't be very rich, Duchess.\"\n\n\"What a blessing for them! But then, perhaps, they'd be very poor.\"\n\n\"They would be rather poor.\"\n\n\"Which is not a blessing. Isn't there some proverb about going\nsafely in the middle? I'm sure it's true about money,--only perhaps\nyou ought to be put a little beyond the middle. I don't know why\nPlantagenet shouldn't do something for her.\"\n\nAs to this conversation Lady Chiltern said very little to Adelaide,\nbut she did mention the proposed visit to Matching.\n\n\"The Duchess said nothing to me,\" replied Adelaide, proudly.\n\n\"No; I don't suppose she had time. And then she is so very odd;\nsometimes taking no notice of one, and at others so very loving.\"\n\n\"I hate that.\"\n\n\"But with her it is neither impudence nor affectation. She says\nexactly what she thinks at the time, and she is always as good as her\nword. There are worse women than the Duchess.\"\n\n\"I am sure I wouldn't like going to Matching,\" said Adelaide.\n\nLady Chiltern was right in saying that the Duchess of Omnium was\nalways as good as her word. On the next day, after that interview\nwith Lord Chiltern about Mr. Fothergill and the foxes,--as to which\nno present further allusion need be made here,--she went to work and\ndid learn a good deal about Gerard Maule and Miss Palliser. Something\nshe learned from Lord Chiltern,--without any consciousness on his\nlordship's part, something from Madame Goesler, and something from\nthe Baldock people. Before she went to bed on the second night she\nknew all about the quarrel, and all about the money. \"Plantagenet,\"\nshe said the next morning, \"what are you going to do about the Duke's\nlegacy to Marie Goesler?\"\n\n\"I can do nothing. She must take the things, of course.\"\n\n\"She won't.\"\n\n\"Then the jewels must remain packed up. I suppose they'll be sold at\nlast for the legacy duty, and, when that's paid, the balance will\nbelong to her.\"\n\n\"But what about the money?\"\n\n\"Of course it belongs to her.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you give it to that girl who was here last night?\"\n\n\"Give it to a girl!\"\n\n\"Yes;--to your cousin. She's as poor as Job, and can't get married\nbecause she hasn't got any money. It's quite true; and I must say\nthat if the Duke had looked after his own relations instead of\nleaving money to people who don't want it and won't have it, it would\nhave been much better. Why shouldn't Adelaide Palliser have it?\"\n\n\"How on earth should I give Adelaide Palliser what doesn't belong to\nme? If you choose to make her a present, you can, but such a sum as\nthat would, I should say, be out of the question.\"\n\nThe Duchess had achieved quite as much as she had anticipated. She\nknew her husband well, and was aware that she couldn't carry her\npoint at once. To her mind it was \"all nonsense\" his saying that the\nmoney was not his. If Madame Goesler wouldn't take it, it must be\nhis; and nobody could make a woman take money if she did not choose.\nAdelaide Palliser was the Duke's first cousin, and it was intolerable\nthat the Duke's first cousin should be unable to marry because she\nwould have nothing to live upon. It became, at least, intolerable\nas soon as the Duchess had taken it into her head to like the first\ncousin. No doubt there were other first cousins as badly off, or\nperhaps worse, as to whom the Duchess would care nothing whether\nthey were rich or poor,--married or single; but then they were first\ncousins who had not had the advantage of interesting the Duchess.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the Duchess to her friend, Madame Goesler, \"you know\nall about those Maules?\"\n\n\"What makes you ask?\"\n\n\"But you do?\"\n\n\"I know something about one of them,\" said Madame Goesler. Now, as\nit happened, Mr. Maule, senior, had on that very day asked Madame\nGoesler to share her lot with his, and the request had been--almost\nindignantly, refused. The general theory that the wooing of widows\nshould be quick had, perhaps, misled Mr. Maule. Perhaps he did not\nthink that the wooing had been quick. He had visited Park Lane with\nthe object of making his little proposition once before, and had\nthen been stopped in his course by the consternation occasioned by\nthe arrest of Phineas Finn. He had waited till Phineas had been\nacquitted, and had then resolved to try his luck. He had heard of the\nlady's journey to Prague, and was acquainted of course with those\nrumours which too freely connected the name of our hero with that of\nthe lady. But rumours are often false, and a lady may go to Prague on\na gentleman's behalf without intending to marry him. All the women in\nLondon were at present more or less in love with the man who had been\naccused of murder, and the fantasy of Madame Goesler might be only as\nthe fantasy of others. And then, rumour also said that Phineas Finn\nintended to marry Lady Laura Kennedy. At any rate a man cannot have\nhis head broken for asking a lady to marry him,--unless he is very\nawkward in the doing of it. So Mr. Maule made his little proposition.\n\n\"Mr. Maule,\" said Madame, smiling, \"is not this rather sudden?\" Mr.\nMaule admitted that it was sudden, but still persisted. \"I think,\nif you please, Mr. Maule, we will say no more about it,\" said the\nlady, with that wicked smile still on her face. Mr. Maule declared\nthat silence on the subject had become impossible to him. \"Then, Mr.\nMaule, I shall have to leave you to speak to the chairs and tables,\"\nsaid Madame Goesler. No doubt she was used to the thing, and knew how\nto conduct herself well. He also had been refused before by ladies of\nwealth, but had never been treated with so little consideration. She\nhad risen from her chair as though about to leave the room, but was\nslow in her movement, showing him that she thought it was well for\nhim to leave it instead of her. Muttering some words, half of apology\nand half of self-assertion, he did leave the room; and now she told\nthe Duchess that she knew something of one of the Maules.\n\n\"That is, the father?\"\n\n\"Yes,--the father.\"\n\n\"He is one of your tribe, I know. We met him at your house just\nbefore the murder. I don't much admire your taste, my dear, because\nhe's a hundred and fifty years old;--and what there is of him comes\nchiefly from the tailor.\"\n\n\"He's as good as any other old man.\"\n\n\"I dare say,--and I hope Mr. Finn will like his society. But he has\ngot a son.\"\n\n\"So he tells me.\"\n\n\"Who is a charming young man.\"\n\n\"He never told me that, Duchess.\"\n\n\"I dare say not. Men of that sort are always jealous of their sons.\nBut he has. Now I am going to tell you something and ask you to do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What was it the French Minister said. If it is simply difficult it\nis done. If it is impossible, it shall be done.\"\n\n\"The easiest thing in the world. You saw Plantagenet's first cousin\nthe other night,--Adelaide Palliser. She is engaged to marry young\nMr. Maule, and they neither of them have a shilling in the world. I\nwant you to give them five-and-twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be peculiar?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"At any rate it would be inconvenient.\"\n\n\"No it wouldn't, my dear. It would be the most convenient thing in\nthe world. Of course I don't mean out of your pocket. There's the\nDuke's legacy.\"\n\n\"It isn't mine, and never will be.\"\n\n\"But Plantagenet says it never can be anybody else's. If I can get\nhim to agree, will you? Of course there will be ever so many papers\nto be signed; and the biggest of all robbers, the Chancellor of the\nExchequer, will put his fingers into the pudding and pull out a plum,\nand the lawyers will take more plums. But that will be nothing to\nus. The pudding will be very nice for them let ever so many plums be\ntaken. The lawyers and people will do it all, and then it will be her\nfortune,--just as though her uncle had left it to her. As it is now,\nthe money will never be of any use to anybody.\" Madame Goesler said\nthat if the Duke consented she also would consent. It was immaterial\nto her who had the money. If by signing any receipt she could\nfacilitate the return of the money to any one of the Duke's family,\nshe would willingly sign it. But Miss Palliser must be made to\nunderstand that the money did not come to her as a present from\nMadame Goesler.\n\n\"But it will be a present from Madame Goesler,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"Plantagenet, if you go and upset everything by saying that, I shall\nthink it most ill-natured. Bother about true! Somebody must have the\nmoney. There's nothing illegal about it.\" And the Duchess had her own\nway. Lawyers were consulted, and documents were prepared, and the\nwhole thing was arranged. Only Adelaide Palliser knew nothing about\nit, nor did Gerard Maule; and the quarrels of lovers had not yet\nbecome the renewal of love. Then the Duchess wrote the two following\nnotes:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR ADELAIDE,\n\n   We shall hope to see you at Matching on the 15th of\n   August. The Duke, as head of the family, expects implicit\n   obedience. You'll meet fifteen young gentlemen from the\n   Treasury and the Board of Trade, but they won't incommode\n   you, as they are kept at work all day. We hope Mr. Finn\n   will be with us, and there isn't a lady in England who\n   wouldn't give her eyes to meet him. We shall stay ever so\n   many weeks at Matching, so that you can do as you please\n   as to the time of leaving us.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   G. O.\n\n   Tell Lord Chiltern that I have my hopes of making\n   Trumpeton Wood too hot for Mr. Fothergill,--but I have\n   to act with the greatest caution. In the meantime I am\n   sending down dozens of young foxes, all labelled Trumpeton\n   Wood, so that he shall know them.\n\n\nThe other was a card rather than a note. The Duke and Duchess of\nOmnium presented their compliments to Mr. Gerard Maule, and requested\nthe honour of his company to dinner on,--a certain day named. When\nGerard Maule received this card at his club he was rather surprised,\nas he had never made the acquaintance either of the Duke or the\nDuchess. But the Duke was the first cousin of Adelaide Palliser, and\nof course he accepted the invitation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\n\"I WILL NOT GO TO LOUGHLINTER.\"\n\n\nThe end of July came, and it was settled that Lady Laura Kennedy\nshould go to Loughlinter. She had been a widow now for nearly three\nmonths, and it was thought right that she should go down and see the\nhouse, and the lands, and the dependents whom her husband had left\nin her charge. It was now three years since she had seen Loughlinter,\nand when last she had left it, she had made up her mind that she\nwould never place her foot upon the place again. Her wretchedness\nhad all come upon her there. It was there that she had first been\nsubjected to the unendurable tedium of Sabbath Day observances. It\nwas there she had been instructed in the unpalatable duties that\nhad been expected from her. It was there that she had been punished\nwith the doctor from Callender whenever she attempted escape under\nthe plea of a headache. And it was there, standing by the waterfall,\nthe noise of which could be heard from the front-door, that Phineas\nFinn had told her of his love. When she accepted the hand of Robert\nKennedy she had known that she had not loved him; but from the moment\nin which Phineas had spoken to her, she knew well that her heart had\ngone one way, whereas her hand was to go another. From that moment\nher whole life had quickly become a blank. She had had no period of\nmarried happiness,--not a month, not an hour. From the moment in\nwhich the thing had been done she had found that the man to whom she\nhad bound herself was odious to her, and that the life before her\nwas distasteful to her. Things which before had seemed worthy to her,\nand full at any rate of interest, became at once dull and vapid. Her\nhusband was in Parliament, as also had been her father, and many of\nher friends,--and, by weight of his own character and her influence,\nwas himself placed high in office; but in his house politics lost all\nthe flavour which they had possessed for her in Portman Square. She\nhad thought that she could at any rate do her duty as the mistress\nof a great household, and as the benevolent lady of a great estate;\nbut household duties under the tutelage of Mr. Kennedy had been\nimpossible to her, and that part of a Scotch Lady Bountiful which she\nhad intended to play seemed to be denied to her. The whole structure\nhad fallen to the ground, and nothing had been left to her.\n\nBut she would not sin. Though she could not bring herself to love her\nhusband, she would at any rate be strong enough to get rid of that\nother love. Having so resolved, she became as weak as water. She at\none time determined to be the guiding genius of the man she loved,--a\nsort of devoted elder sister, intending him to be the intimate friend\nof her husband; then she had told him not to come to her house, and\nhad been weak enough to let him know why it was that she could not\nbear his presence. She had failed altogether to keep her secret, and\nher life during the struggle had become so intolerable to her that\nshe had found herself compelled to desert her husband. He had shown\nher that he, too, had discovered the truth, and then she had become\nindignant, and had left him. Every place that she had inhabited\nwith him had become disagreeable to her. The house in London had\nbeen so odious, that she had asked her intimate friends to come to\nher in that occupied by her father. But, of all spots upon earth,\nLoughlinter had been the most distasteful to her. It was there that\nthe sermons had been the longest, the lessons in accounts the most\nobstinate, the lectures the most persevering, the dullness the most\nheavy. It was there that her ears had learned the sound of the wheels\nof Dr. Macnuthrie's gig. It was there that her spirit had been nearly\nbroken. It was there that, with spirit not broken, she had determined\nto face all that the world might say of her, and fly from a tyranny\nwhich was insupportable. And now the place was her own, and she was\ntold that she must go there as its owner;--go there and be potential,\nand beneficent, and grandly bland with persons, all of whom knew what\nhad been the relations between her and her husband.\n\nAnd though she had been indignant with her husband when at last she\nhad left him,--throwing it in his teeth as an unmanly offence that he\nhad accused her of the truth; though she had felt him to be a tyrant\nand herself to be a thrall; though the sermons, and the lessons,\nand the doctor had each, severally, seemed to her to be horrible\ncruelties; yet she had known through it all that the fault had\nbeen hers, and not his. He only did that which she should have\nexpected when she married him;--but she had done none of that which\nhe was entitled to expect from her. The real fault, the deceit, the\nfraud,--the sin had been with her,--and she knew it. Her life had\nbeen destroyed,--but not by him. His life had also been destroyed,\nand she had done it. Now he was gone, and she knew that his\npeople,--the old mother who was still left alone, his cousins, and\nthe tenants who were now to be her tenants, all said that had she\ndone her duty by him he would still have been alive. And they must\nhate her the worse, because she had never sinned after such a fashion\nas to liberate him from his bond to her. With a husband's perfect\nfaith in his wife, he had, immediately after his marriage, given to\nher for her life the lordship over his people, should he be without\na child and should she survive him. In his hottest anger he had not\naltered that. His constant demand had been that she should come back\nto him, and be his real wife. And while making that demand,--with a\npersistency which had driven him mad,--he had died; and now the place\nwas hers, and they told her that she must go and live there!\n\nIt is a very sad thing for any human being to have to say to\nhimself,--with an earnest belief in his own assertion,--that all the\njoy of this world is over for him; and is the sadder because such\nconviction is apt to exclude the hope of other joy. This woman had\nsaid so to herself very often during the last two years, and had\ncertainly been sincere. What was there in store for her? She was\nbanished from the society of all those she liked. She bore a name\nthat was hateful to her. She loved a man whom she could never see.\nShe was troubled about money. Nothing in life had any taste for her.\nAll the joys of the world were over,--and had been lost by her own\nfault. Then Phineas Finn had come to her at Dresden, and now her\nhusband was dead!\n\nCould it be that she was entitled to hope that the sun might rise\nagain for her once more and another day be reopened for her with\na gorgeous morning? She was now rich and still young,--or young\nenough. She was two and thirty, and had known many women,--women\nstill honoured with the name of girls,--who had commenced the world\nsuccessfully at that age. And this man had loved her once. He had\ntold her so, and had afterwards kissed her when informed of her own\nengagement. How well she remembered it all. He, too, had gone through\nvicissitudes in life, had married and retired out of the world,\nhad returned to it, and had gone through fire and water. But now\neverybody was saying good things of him, and all he wanted was the\nsplendour which wealth would give him. Why should he not take it at\nher hands, and why should not the world begin again for both of them?\n\nBut though she would dream that it might be so, she was quite sure\nthat there was no such life in store for her. The nature of the man\nwas too well known to her. Fickle he might be;--or rather capable of\nchange than fickle; but he was incapable of pretending to love when\nhe did not love. She felt that in all the moments in which he had\nbeen most tender with her. When she had endeavoured to explain to him\nthe state of her feelings at K\u00c3\u00b6nigstein,--meaning to be true in what\nshe said, but not having been even then true throughout,--she had\nacknowledged to herself that at every word he spoke she was wounded\nby his coldness. Had he then professed a passion for her she would\nhave rebuked him, and told him that he must go from her,--but it\nwould have warmed the blood in all her veins, and brought back to\nher a sense of youthful life. It had been the same when she visited\nhim in the prison;--the same again when he came to her after his\nacquittal. She had been frank enough to him, but he would not even\npretend that he loved her. His gratitude, his friendship, his\nservices, were all hers. In every respect he had behaved well to her.\nAll his troubles had come upon him because he would not desert her\ncause,--but he would never again say he loved her.\n\nShe gazed at herself in the glass, putting aside for the moment the\nhideous widow's cap which she now wore, and told herself that it\nwas natural that it should be so. Though she was young in years\nher features were hard and worn with care. She had never thought\nherself to be a beauty, though she had been conscious of a certain\naristocratic grace of manner which might stand in the place of\nbeauty. As she examined herself she found that that was not all\ngone;--but she now lacked that roundness of youth which had been hers\nwhen first she knew Phineas Finn. She sat opposite the mirror, and\npored over her own features with an almost skilful scrutiny, and told\nherself at last aloud that she had become an old woman. He was in the\nprime of life; but for her was left nothing but its dregs.\n\n\n[Illustration: Lady Laura at the glass.]\n\n\nShe was to go to Loughlinter with her brother and her brother's wife,\nleaving her father at Saulsby on the way. The Chilterns were to\nremain with her for one week, and no more. His presence was demanded\nin the Brake country, and it was with difficulty that he had been\ninduced to give her so much of his time. But what was she to do when\nthey should leave her? How could she live alone in that great house,\nthinking, as she ever must think, of all that had happened to her\nthere? It seemed to her that everybody near to her was cruel in\ndemanding from her such a sacrifice of her comfort. Her father\nhad shuddered when she had proposed to him to accompany her to\nLoughlinter; but her father was one of those who insisted on the\npropriety of her going there. Then, in spite of that lesson which she\nhad taught herself while sitting opposite to the glass, she allowed\nher fancy to revel in the idea of having him with her as she wandered\nover the braes. She saw him a day or two before her journey, when\nshe told him her plans as she might tell them to any friend. Lady\nChiltern and her father had been present, and there had been no\nspecial sign in her outward manner of the mingled tenderness and\nsoreness of her heart within. No allusion had been made to any visit\nfrom him to the North. She would not have dared to suggest it in\nthe presence of her brother, and was almost as much cowed by her\nbrother's wife. But when she was alone, on the eve of her departure,\nshe wrote to him as follows:--\n\n\n   Sunday, 1st August, ----.\n\n   DEAR FRIEND,\n\n   I thought that perhaps you might have come in this\n   afternoon, and I have not left the house all day. I\n   was so wretched that I could not go to church in the\n   morning;--and when the afternoon came, I preferred the\n   chance of seeing you to going out with Violet. We two\n   were alone all the evening, and I did not give you up\n   till nearly ten. I dare say you were right not to come.\n   I should only have bored you with my complaints, and have\n   grumbled to you of evils which you cannot cure.\n\n   We start at nine to-morrow, and get to Saulsby in the\n   afternoon. Such a family party as we shall be! I did fancy\n   that Oswald would escape it; but, like everybody else, he\n   has changed,--and has become domestic and dutiful. Not but\n   that he is as tyrannous as ever; but his tyranny is now\n   that of the responsible father of a family. Papa cannot\n   understand him at all, and is dreadfully afraid of him. We\n   stay two nights at Saulsby, and then go on to Scotland,\n   leaving papa at home.\n\n   Of course it is very good in Violet and Oswald to come\n   with me,--if, as they say, it be necessary for me to go at\n   all. As to living there by myself, it seems to me to be\n   impossible. You know the place well, and can you imagine\n   me there all alone, surrounded by Scotch men and women,\n   who, of course, must hate and despise me, afraid of every\n   face that I see, and reminded even by the chairs and\n   tables of all that is past? I have told papa that I know\n   I shall be back at Saulsby before the middle of the month.\n   He frets, and says nothing; but he tells Violet, and then\n   she lectures me in that wise way of hers which enables her\n   to say such hard things with so much seeming tenderness.\n   She asks me why I do not take a companion with me, as I am\n   so much afraid of solitude. Where on earth should I find a\n   companion who would not be worse than solitude? I do feel\n   now that I have mistaken life in having so little used\n   myself to the small resources of feminine companionship.\n   I love Violet dearly, and I used to be always happy in her\n   society. But even with her now I feel but a half sympathy.\n   That girl that she has with her is more to her than I am,\n   because after the first half-hour I grow tired about her\n   babies. I have never known any other woman with whom I\n   cared to be alone. How then shall I content myself with\n   a companion, hired by the quarter, perhaps from some\n   advertisement in a newspaper?\n\n   No companionship of any kind seems possible to me,--and\n   yet never was a human being more weary of herself. I\n   sometimes wonder whether I could go again and sit in\n   that cage in the House of Commons to hear you and other\n   men speak,--as I used to do. I do not believe that any\n   eloquence in the world would make it endurable to me. I\n   hardly care who is in or out, and do not understand the\n   things which my cousin Barrington tells me,--so long does\n   it seem since I was in the midst of them all. Not but that\n   I am intensely anxious that you should be back. They tell\n   me that you will certainly be re-elected this week, and\n   that all the House will receive you with open arms. I\n   should have liked, had it been possible, to be once more\n   in the cage to see that. But I am such a coward that I did\n   not even dare to propose to stay for it. Violet would have\n   told me that such manifestation of interest was unfit for\n   my condition as a widow. But in truth, Phineas, there is\n   nothing else now that does interest me. If, looking on\n   from a distance, I can see you succeed, I shall try once\n   more to care for the questions of the day. When you have\n   succeeded, as I know you will, it will be some consolation\n   to me to think that I also helped a little.\n\n   I suppose I must not ask you to come to Loughlinter? But\n   you will know best. If you will do so I shall care nothing\n   for what any one may say. Oswald hardly mentions your\n   name in my hearing, and of course I know of what he is\n   thinking. When I am with him I am afraid of him, because\n   it would add infinitely to my grief were I driven to\n   quarrel with him; but I am my own mistress as much as he\n   is his own master, and I will not regulate my conduct by\n   his wishes. If you please to come you will be welcome as\n   the flowers in May. Ah, how weak are such words in giving\n   any idea of the joy with which I should see you!\n\n   God bless you, Phineas.\n\n   Your most affectionate friend,\n\n   LAURA KENNEDY.\n\n   Write to me at Loughlinter. I shall long to hear that you\n   have taken your seat immediately on your re-election. Pray\n   do not lose a day. I am sure that all your friends will\n   advise you as I do.\n\n\nThroughout her whole letter she was struggling to tell him once again\nof her love, and yet to do it in some way of which she need not be\nashamed. It was not till she had come to the last words that she\ncould force her pen to speak of her affection, and then the words did\nnot come freely as she would have had them. She knew that he would\nnot come to Loughlinter. She felt that were he to do so he could come\nonly as a suitor for her hand, and that such a suit, in these early\ndays of her widowhood, carried on in her late husband's house, would\nbe held to be disgraceful. As regarded herself, she would have faced\nall that for the sake of the thing to be attained. But she knew\nthat he would not come. He had become wise by experience, and would\nperceive the result of such coming,--and would avoid it. His answer\nto her letter reached Loughlinter before she did:--\n\n\n   Great Marlborough Street,\n   Monday night.\n\n   DEAR LADY LAURA,--\n\n   I should have called in the Square last night, only that\n   I feel that Lady Chiltern must be weary of the woes of so\n   doleful a person as myself. I dined and spent the evening\n   with the Lows, and was quite aware that I disgraced myself\n   with them by being perpetually lachrymose. As a rule I do\n   not think that I am more given than other people to talk\n   of myself, but I am conscious of a certain incapability of\n   getting rid of myself what has grown upon me since those\n   weary weeks in Newgate and those frightful days in the\n   dock; and this makes me unfit for society. Should I again\n   have a seat in the House I shall be afraid to get up upon\n   my legs, lest I should find myself talking of the time\n   in which I stood before the judge with a halter round my\n   neck.\n\n   I sympathise with you perfectly in what you say about\n   Loughlinter. It may be right that you should go there and\n   show yourself,--so that those who knew the Kennedys in\n   Scotland should not say that you had not dared to visit\n   the place, but I do not think it possible that you should\n   live there as yet. And why should you do so? I cannot\n   conceive that your presence there should do good, unless\n   you took delight in the place.\n\n   I will not go to Loughlinter myself, although I know how\n   warm would be my welcome.\n\nWhen he had got so far with his letter he found the difficulty of\ngoing on with it to be almost insuperable. How could he give her any\nreasons for his not making the journey to Scotland? \"People would say\nthat you and I should not be alone together after all the evil that\nhas been spoken of us;--and would be specially eager in saying so\nwere I now to visit you, so lately made a widow, and to sojourn with\nyou in the house that did belong to your husband. Only think how\neloquent would be the indignation of The People's Banner were it\nknown that I was at Loughlinter.\" Could he have spoken the truth\nopenly, such were the reasons that he would have given; but it was\nimpossible that such truths should be written by him in a letter to\nherself. And then it was almost equally difficult for him to tell\nher of a visit which he had resolved to make. But the letter must be\ncompleted, and at last the words were written.\n\n   I could be of no real service to you there, as will be\n   your brother and your brother's wife, even though their\n   stay with you is to be so short. Were I you I would go\n   out among the people as much as possible, even though\n   they should not receive you cordially at first. Though\n   we hear so much of clanship in the Highlands, I think\n   the Highlanders are prone to cling to any one who has\n   territorial authority among them. They thought a great\n   deal of Mr. Kennedy, but they had never heard his name\n   fifty years ago. I suppose you will return to Saulsby\n   soon, and then, perhaps, I may be able to see you.\n\n   In the meantime I am going to Matching. [This difficulty\n   was worse even than the other.] Both the Duke and Duchess\n   have asked me, and I know that I am bound to make an\n   effort to face my fellow-creatures again. The horror I\n   feel at being stared at, as the man that was not--hung\n   as a murderer, is stronger than I can describe; and I am\n   well aware that I shall be talked to and made a wonder\n   of on that ground. I am told that I am to be re-elected\n   triumphantly at Tankerville without a penny of cost\n   or the trouble of asking for a vote, simply because I\n   didn't knock poor Mr. Bonteen on the head. This to me is\n   abominable, but I cannot help myself, unless I resolve to\n   go away and hide myself. That I know cannot be right, and\n   therefore I had better go through it and have done with\n   it. Though I am to be stared at, I shall not be stared at\n   very long. Some other monster will come up and take my\n   place, and I shall be the only person who will not forget\n   it all. Therefore I have accepted the Duke's invitation,\n   and shall go to Matching some time in the end of August.\n   All the world is to be there.\n\n   This re-election,--and I believe I shall be re-elected\n   to-morrow,--would be altogether distasteful to me were it\n   not that I feel that I should not allow myself to be cut\n   to pieces by what has occurred. I shall hate to go back\n   to the House, and have somehow learned to dislike and\n   distrust all those things that used to be so fine and\n   lively to me. I don't think that I believe any more in the\n   party;--or rather in the men who lead it. I used to have a\n   faith that now seems to me to be marvellous. Even twelve\n   months ago, when I was beginning to think of standing for\n   Tankerville, I believed that on our side the men were\n   patriotic angels, and that Daubeny and his friends were\n   all fiends or idiots,--mostly idiots, but with a strong\n   dash of fiendism to control them. It has all come now to\n   one common level of poor human interests. I doubt whether\n   patriotism can stand the wear and tear and temptation of\n   the front benches in the House of Commons. Men are flying\n   at each other's throats, thrusting and parrying, making\n   false accusations and defences equally false, lying and\n   slandering,--sometimes picking and stealing,--till they\n   themselves become unaware of the magnificence of their own\n   position, and forget that they are expected to be great.\n   Little tricks of sword-play engage all their skill. And\n   the consequence is that there is no reverence now for any\n   man in the House,--none of that feeling which we used to\n   entertain for Mr. Mildmay.\n\n   Of course I write--and feel--as a discontented man; and\n   what I say to you I would not say to any other human\n   being. I did long most anxiously for office, having made\n   up my mind a second time to look to it as a profession.\n   But I meant to earn my bread honestly, and give it up,--as\n   I did before, when I could not keep it with a clear\n   conscience. I knew that I was hustled out of the object\n   of my poor ambition by that unfortunate man who has\n   been hurried to his fate. In such a position I ought to\n   distrust, and do, partly, distrust my own feelings. And\n   I am aware that I have been soured by prison indignities.\n   But still the conviction remains with me that\n   parliamentary interests are not those battles of gods\n   and giants which I used to regard them. Our Gyas with\n   the hundred hands is but a Three-fingered Jack, and I\n   sometimes think that we share our great Jove with the\n   Strand Theatre. Nevertheless I shall go back,--and if they\n   will make me a joint lord to-morrow I shall be in heaven!\n\n   I do not know why I should write all this to you except\n   that there is no one else to whom I can say it. There\n   is no one else who would give a moment of time to such\n   lamentations. My friends will expect me to talk to them of\n   my experiences in the dock rather than politics, and will\n   want to know what rations I had in Newgate. I went to call\n   on the Governor only yesterday, and visited the old room.\n   \"I never could really bring myself to think that you did\n   it, Mr. Finn,\" he said. I looked at him and smiled, but\n   I should have liked to fly at his throat. Why did he not\n   know that the charge was a monstrous absurdity? Talking\n   of that, not even you were truer to me than your brother.\n   One expects it from a woman;--both the truth and the\n   discernment.\n\n   I have written to you a cruelly long letter; but when\n   one's mind is full such relief is sometimes better than\n   talking. Pray answer it before long, and let me know what\n   you intend to do.\n\n   Yours most affectionately,\n\n   PHINEAS FINN.\n\n\nShe did read the letter through,--read it probably more than once;\nbut there was only one sentence in it that had for her any enduring\ninterest. \"I will not go to Loughlinter myself.\" Though she had known\nthat he would not come her heart sank within her, as though now, at\nthis moment, the really fatal wound had at last been inflicted. But,\nin truth, there was another sentence as a complement to the first,\nwhich rivetted the dagger in her bosom. \"In the meantime I am going\nto Matching.\" Throughout his letter the name of that woman was not\nmentioned, but of course she would be there. The thing had all been\narranged in order that they two might be brought together. She\ntold herself that she had always hated that intriguing woman, Lady\nGlencora. She read the remainder of the letter and understood it; but\nshe read it all in connection with the beauty, and the wealth, and\nthe art,--and the cunning of Madame Max Goesler.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nPHINEAS FINN IS RE-ELECTED.\n\n\nThe manner in which Phineas Finn was returned a second time for the\nborough of Tankerville was memorable among the annals of English\nelections. When the news reached the town that their member was to be\ntried for murder no doubt every elector believed that he was guilty.\nIt is the natural assumption when the police and magistrates and\nlawyers, who have been at work upon the matter carefully, have come\nto that conclusion, and nothing but private knowledge or personal\naffection will stand against such evidence. At Tankerville there was\nnothing of either, and our hero's guilt was taken as a certainty.\nThere was an interest felt in the whole matter which was full of\nexcitement, and not altogether without delight to the Tankervillians.\nOf course the borough, as a borough, would never again hold up its\nhead. There had never been known such an occurrence in the whole\nhistory of this country as the hanging of a member of the House of\nCommons. And this Member of Parliament was to be hung for murdering\nanother member, which, no doubt, added much to the importance of\nthe transaction. A large party in the borough declared that it\nwas a judgment. Tankerville had degraded itself among boroughs by\nsending a Roman Catholic to Parliament, and had done so at the very\nmoment in which the Church of England was being brought into danger.\nThis was what had come upon the borough by not sticking to honest\nMr. Browborough! There was a moment,--just before the trial was\nbegun,--in which a large proportion of the electors was desirous\nof proceeding to work at once, and of sending Mr. Browborough back\nto his own place. It was thought that Phineas Finn should be made\nto resign. And very wise men in Tankerville were much surprised\nwhen they were told that a member of Parliament cannot resign his\nseat,--that when once returned he is supposed to be, as long as that\nParliament shall endure, the absolute slave of his constituency\nand his country, and that he can escape from his servitude only\nby accepting some office under the Crown. Now it was held to be\nimpossible that a man charged with murder should be appointed even to\nthe stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. The House, no doubt, could\nexpel a member, and would, as a matter of course, expel the member\nfor Tankerville,--but the House could hardly proceed to expulsion\nbefore the member's guilt could have been absolutely established. So\nit came to pass that there was no escape for the borough from any\npart of the disgrace to which it had subjected itself by its unworthy\nchoice, and some Tankervillians of sensitive minds were of opinion\nthat no Tankervillian ever again ought to take part in politics.\n\nThen, quite suddenly, there came into the borough the tidings that\nPhineas Finn was an innocent man. This happened on the morning on\nwhich the three telegrams from Prague reached London. The news\nconveyed by the telegrams was at Tankerville almost as soon as in\nthe Court at the Old Bailey, and was believed as readily. The name\nof the lady who had travelled all the way to Bohemia on behalf of\ntheir handsome young member was on the tongue of every woman in\nTankerville, and a most delightful romance was composed. Some few\nProtestant spirits regretted the now assured escape of their Roman\nCatholic enemy, and would not even yet allow themselves to doubt that\nthe whole murder had been arranged by Divine Providence to bring down\nthe scarlet woman. It seemed to them to be so fitting a thing that\nProvidence should interfere directly to punish a town in which the\nsins of the scarlet woman were not held to be abominable! But the\nmultitude were soon convinced that their member was innocent; and\nas it was certain that he had been in great peril,--as it was known\nthat he was still in durance, and as it was necessary that the trial\nshould proceed, and that he should still stand at least for another\nday in the dock,--he became more than ever a hero. Then came the\nfurther delay, and at last the triumphant conclusion of the trial.\nWhen acquitted, Phineas Finn was still member for Tankerville and\nmight have walked into the House on that very night. Instead of doing\nso he had at once asked for the accustomed means of escape from his\nservitude, and the seat for Tankerville was vacant. The most loving\nfriends of Mr. Browborough perceived at once that there was not\na chance for him. The borough was all but unanimous in resolving\nthat it would return no one as its member but the man who had been\nunjustly accused of murder.\n\nMr. Ruddles was at once despatched to London with two other political\nspirits,--so that there might be a real deputation,--and waited upon\nPhineas two days after his release from prison. Ruddles was very\nanxious to carry his member back with him, assuring Phineas of an\nentry into the borough so triumphant that nothing like to it had ever\nbeen known at Tankerville. But to all this Phineas was quite deaf.\nAt first he declined even to be put in nomination. \"You can't escape\nfrom it, Mr. Finn, you can't indeed,\" said Ruddles. \"You don't at all\nunderstand the enthusiasm of the borough; does he, Mr. Gadmire?\"\n\n\"I never knew anything like it in my life before,\" said Gadmire.\n\n\"I believe Mr. Finn would poll two-thirds of the Church party\nto-morrow,\" said Mr. Troddles, a leading dissenter in Tankerville,\nwho on this occasion was the third member of the deputation.\n\n\"I needn't sit for the borough unless I please, I suppose,\" pleaded\nPhineas.\n\n\"Well, no;--at least I don't know,\" said Ruddles. \"It would be\nthrowing us over a good deal, and I'm sure you are not the gentleman\nto do that. And then, Mr. Finn, don't you see that though you have\nbeen knocked about a little lately--\"\n\n\"By George, he has,--most cruel,\" said Troddles.\n\n\"You'll miss the House if you give it up; you will, after a bit, Mr.\nFinn. You've got to come round again, Mr. Finn,--if I may be so bold\nas to say so, and you shouldn't put yourself out of the way of coming\nround comfortably.\"\n\nPhineas knew that there was wisdom in the words of Mr. Ruddles, and\nconsented. Though at this moment he was low in heart, disgusted with\nthe world, and sick of humanity,--though every joint in his body was\nstill sore from the rack on which he had been stretched, yet he knew\nthat it would not be so with him always. As others recovered so would\nhe, and it might be that he would live to \"miss the House,\" should he\nnow refuse the offer made to him. He accepted the offer, but he did\nso with a positive assurance that no consideration should at present\ntake him to Tankerville.\n\n\"We ain't going to charge you, not one penny,\" said Mr. Gadmire, with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"I feel all that I owe to the borough,\" said Phineas, \"and to the\nwarm friends there who have espoused my cause; but I am not in a\ncondition at present, either of mind or body, to put myself forward\nanywhere in public. I have suffered a great deal.\"\n\n\"Most cruel!\" said Troddles.\n\n\"And am quite willing to confess that I am therefore unfit in my\npresent position to serve the borough.\"\n\n\"We can't admit that,\" said Gadmire, raising his left hand.\n\n\"We mean to have you,\" said Troddles.\n\n\"There isn't a doubt about your re-election, Mr. Finn,\" said Ruddles.\n\n\"I am very grateful, but I cannot be there. I must trust to one of\nyou gentlemen to explain to the electors that in my present condition\nI am unable to visit the borough.\"\n\nMessrs. Ruddles, Gadmire, and Troddles returned to\nTankerville,--disappointed no doubt at not bringing with them him\nwhose company would have made their feet glorious on the pavement of\ntheir native town,--but still with a comparative sense of their own\nimportance in having seen the great sufferer whose woes forbade that\nhe should be beheld by common eyes. They never even expressed an idea\nthat he ought to have come, alluding even to their past convictions\nas to the futility of hoping for such a blessing; but spoke of him as\na personage made almost sacred by the sufferings which he had been\nmade to endure. As to the election, that would be a matter of course.\nHe was proposed by Mr. Ruddles himself, and was absolutely seconded\nby the rector of Tankerville,--the staunchest Tory in the place,\nwho on this occasion made a speech in which he declared that as an\nEnglishman, loving justice, he could not allow any political or even\nany religious consideration to bias his conduct on this occasion. Mr.\nFinn had thrown up his seat under the pressure of a false accusation,\nand it was, the rector thought, for the honour of the borough that\nthe seat should be restored to him. So Phineas Finn was re-elected\nfor Tankerville without opposition and without expense; and for\nsix weeks after the ceremony parcels were showered upon him by\nthe ladies of the borough who sent him worked slippers, scarlet\nhunting waistcoats, pocket handkerchiefs, with \"P.F.\" beautifully\nembroidered, and chains made of their own hair.\n\nIn this conjunction of affairs the editor of The People's Banner\nfound it somewhat difficult to trim his sails. It was a rule of life\nwith Mr. Quintus Slide to persecute an enemy. An enemy might at any\ntime become a friend, but while an enemy was an enemy he should be\ntrodden on and persecuted. Mr. Slide had striven more than once to\nmake a friend of Phineas Finn; but Phineas Finn had been conceited\nand stiff-necked. Phineas had been to Mr. Slide an enemy of enemies,\nand by all his ideas of manliness, by all the rules of his life, by\nevery principle which guided him, he was bound to persecute Phineas\nto the last. During the trial and the few weeks before the trial he\nhad written various short articles with the view of declaring how\nimproper it would be should a newspaper express any opinion of the\nguilt or innocence of a suspected person while under trial; and he\ngave two or three severe blows to contemporaries for having sinned in\nthe matter; but in all these articles he had contrived to insinuate\nthat the member for Tankerville would, as a matter of course, be\ndealt with by the hands of justice. He had been very careful to\nrecapitulate all circumstances which had induced Finn to hate the\nmurdered man, and had more than once related the story of the\nfiring of the pistol at Macpherson's Hotel. Then came the telegram\nfrom Prague, and for a day or two Mr. Slide was stricken dumb. The\nacquittal followed, and Quintus Slide had found himself compelled to\njoin in the general satisfaction evinced at the escape of an innocent\nman. Then came the re-election for Tankerville, and Mr. Slide felt\nthat there was opportunity for another reaction. More than enough\nhad been done for Phineas Finn in allowing him to elude the gallows.\nThere could certainly be no need for crowning him with a political\nchaplet because he had not murdered Mr. Bonteen. Among a few other\nremarks which Mr. Slide threw together, the following appeared in the\ncolumns of The People's Banner:--\n\n\n   We must confess that we hardly understand the principle on\n   which Mr. Finn has been re-elected for Tankerville with so\n   much enthusiasm,--free of expense,--and without that usual\n   compliment to the constituency which is implied by the\n   personal appearance of the candidate. We have more than\n   once expressed our belief that he was wrongly accused in\n   the matter of Mr. Bonteen's murder. Indeed our readers\n   will do us the justice to remember that, during the trial\n   and before the trial, we were always anxious to allay the\n   very strong feeling against Mr. Finn with which the public\n   mind was then imbued, not only by the facts of the murder,\n   but also by the previous conduct of that gentleman. But we\n   cannot understand why the late member should be thought\n   by the electors of Tankerville to be especially worthy of\n   their confidence because he did not murder Mr. Bonteen. He\n   himself, instigated, we hope, by a proper feeling, retired\n   from Parliament as soon as he was acquitted. His career\n   during the last twelve months has not enhanced his credit,\n   and cannot, we should think, have increased his comfort.\n   We ventured to suggest after that affair in Judd Street,\n   as to which the police were so benignly inefficient, that\n   it would not be for the welfare of the nation that a\n   gentleman should be employed in the public service whose\n   public life had been marked by the misfortune which had\n   attended Mr. Finn. Great efforts were made by various\n   ladies of the old Whig party to obtain official employment\n   for him, but they were made in vain. Mr. Gresham was too\n   wise, and our advice,--we will not say was followed,--but\n   was found to agree with the decision of the Prime\n   Minister. Mr. Finn was left out in the cold in spite\n   of his great friends,--and then came the murder of Mr.\n   Bonteen.\n\n   Can it be that Mr. Finn's fitness for Parliamentary duties\n   has been increased by Mr. Bonteen's unfortunate death, or\n   by the fact that Mr. Bonteen was murdered by other hands\n   than his own? We think not. The wretched husband, who,\n   in the madness of jealousy, fired a pistol at this young\n   man's head, has since died in his madness. Does that\n   incident in the drama give Mr. Finn any special claim\n   to consideration? We think not;--and we think also that\n   the electors of Tankerville would have done better had\n   they allowed Mr. Finn to return to that obscurity which\n   he seems to have desired. The electors of Tankerville,\n   however, are responsible only to their borough, and may\n   do as they please with the seat in Parliament which is\n   at their disposal. We may, however, protest against the\n   employment of an unfit person in the service of his\n   country,--simply because he has not committed a murder.\n   We say so much now because rumours of an arrangement have\n   reached our ears, which, should it come to pass,--would\n   force upon us the extremely disagreeable duty of referring\n   very forcibly to past circumstances, which may otherwise,\n   perhaps, be allowed to be forgotten.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nTHE END OF THE STORY OF MR. EMILIUS AND LADY EUSTACE.\n\n\nThe interest in the murder by no means came to an end when Phineas\nFinn was acquitted. The new facts which served so thoroughly to prove\nhim innocent tended with almost equal weight to prove another man\nguilty. And the other man was already in custody on a charge which\nhad subjected him to the peculiar ill-will of the British public. He,\na foreigner and a Jew, by name Yosef Mealyus,--as every one was now\nvery careful to call him,--had come to England, had got himself to be\nordained as a clergyman, had called himself Emilius, and had married\na rich wife with a title, although he had a former wife still living\nin his own country. Had he called himself Jones it would have been\nbetter for him, but there was something in the name of Emilius which\nadded a peculiar sting to his iniquities. It was now known that the\nbigamy could be certainly proved, and that his last victim,--our\nold friend, poor little Lizzie Eustace,--would be rescued from his\nclutches. She would once more be a free woman, and as she had been\nstrong enough to defend her future income from his grasp, she was\nperhaps as fortunate as she deserved to be. She was still young\nand pretty, and there might come another lover more desirable than\nYosef Mealyus. That the man would have to undergo the punishment of\nbigamy in its severest form, there was no doubt;--but would law, and\njustice, and the prevailing desire for revenge, be able to get at\nhim in such a way that he might be hung? There certainly did exist\na strong desire to prove Mr. Emilius to have been a murderer, so\nthat there might come a fitting termination to his career in Great\nBritain.\n\nThe police seemed to think that they could make but little either of\nthe coat or of the key, unless other evidence, that would be almost\nsufficient in itself, should be found. Lord Fawn was informed that\nhis testimony would probably be required at another trial,--which\nintimation affected him so grievously that his friends for a week\nor two thought that he would altogether sink under his miseries.\nBut he would say nothing which would seem to criminate Mealyus. A\nman hurrying along with a grey coat was all that he could swear to\nnow,--professing himself to be altogether ignorant whether the man,\nas seen by him, had been tall or short. And then the manufacture of\nthe key,--though it was that which made every one feel sure that\nMealyus was the murderer,--did not, in truth, afford the slightest\nevidence against him. Even had it been proved that he had certainly\nused the false key and left Mrs. Meager's house on the night in\nquestion, that would not have sufficed at all to prove that therefore\nhe had committed a murder in Berkeley Street. No doubt Mr. Bonteen\nhad been his enemy,--and Mr. Bonteen had been murdered by an enemy.\nBut so great had been the man's luck that no real evidence seemed to\ntouch him. Nobody doubted;--but then but few had doubted before as to\nthe guilt of Phineas Finn.\n\nThere was one other fact by which the truth might, it was hoped,\nstill be reached. Mr. Bonteen had, of course, been killed by\nthe weapon which had been found in the garden. As to that a\ngeneral certainty prevailed. Mrs. Meager and Miss Meager, and the\nmaid-of-all-work belonging to the Meagers, and even Lady Eustace,\nwere examined as to this bludgeon. Had anything of the kind ever\nbeen seen in the possession of the clergyman? The clergyman had been\nso sly that nothing of the kind had been seen. Of the drawers and\ncupboards which he used, Mrs. Meager had always possessed duplicate\nkeys, and Miss Meager frankly acknowledged that she had a general and\nfairly accurate acquaintance with the contents of these receptacles;\nbut there had always been a big trunk with an impenetrable lock,--a\nlock which required that even if you had the key you should be\nacquainted with a certain combination of letters before you could\nopen it,--and of that trunk no one had seen the inside. As a matter\nof course, the weapon, when brought to London, had been kept\naltogether hidden in the trunk. Nothing could be easier. But a man\ncannot be hung because he has had a secret hiding place in which a\nmurderous weapon may have been stowed away.\n\nBut might it not be possible to trace the weapon? Mealyus, on his\nreturn from Prague, had certainly come through Paris. So much was\nlearned,--and it was also learned as a certainty that the article\nwas of French,--and probably of Parisian manufacture. If it could be\nproved that the man had bought this weapon, or even such a weapon, in\nParis then,--so said all the police authorities,--it might be worth\nwhile to make an attempt to hang him. Men very skilful in unravelling\nsuch mysteries were sent to Paris, and the police of that capital\nentered upon the search with most praiseworthy zeal. But the number\nof life-preservers which had been sold altogether baffled them. It\nseemed that nothing was so common as that gentlemen should walk about\nwith bludgeons in their pockets covered with leathern thongs. A young\nwoman and an old man who thought that they could recollect something\nof a special sale were brought over,--and saw the splendour of London\nunder very favourable circumstances;--but when confronted with Mr.\nEmilius, neither could venture to identify him. A large sum of money\nwas expended,--no doubt justified by the high position which poor Mr.\nBonteen had filled in the counsels of the nation; but it was expended\nin vain. Mr. Bonteen had been murdered in the streets at the West End\nof London. The murderer was known to everybody. He had been seen a\nminute or two before the murder. The motive which had induced the\ncrime was apparent. The weapon with which it had been perpetrated had\nbeen found. The murderer's disguise had been discovered. The cunning\nwith which he had endeavoured to prove that he was in bed at home\nhad been unravelled, and the criminal purpose of his cunning made\naltogether manifest. Every man's eye could see the whole thing from\nthe moment in which the murderer crept out of Mrs. Meager's house\nwith Mr. Meager's coat upon his shoulders and the life-preserver in\nhis pocket, till he was seen by Lord Fawn hurrying out of the mews\nto his prey. The blows from the bludgeon could be counted. The very\nmoment in which they had been struck had been ascertained. His very\nact in hurling the weapon over the wall was all but seen. And yet\nnothing could be done. \"It is a very dangerous thing hanging a man on\ncircumstantial evidence,\" said Sir Gregory Grogram, who, a couple of\nmonths since, had felt almost sure that his honourable friend Phineas\nFinn would have to be hung on circumstantial evidence. The police\nand magistrates and lawyers all agreed that it would be useless, and\nindeed wrong, to send the case before a jury. But there had been\nquite sufficient evidence against Phineas Finn!\n\nIn the meantime the trial for bigamy proceeded in order that poor\nlittle Lizzie Eustace might be freed from the incubus which afflicted\nher. Before the end of July she was made once more a free woman, and\nthe Rev. Joseph Emilius,--under which name it was thought proper that\nhe should be tried,--was convicted and sentenced to penal servitude\nfor five years. A very touching appeal was made for him to the jury\nby a learned serjeant, who declared that his client was to lose his\nwife and to be punished with extreme severity as a bigamist, because\nit was found to be impossible to bring home against him a charge of\nmurder. There was, perhaps, some truth in what the learned serjeant\nsaid, but the truth had no effect upon the jury. Mr. Emilius was\nfound guilty as quickly as Phineas Finn had been acquitted, and was,\nperhaps, treated with a severity which the single crime would hardly\nhave elicited. But all this happened in the middle of the efforts\nwhich were being made to trace the purchase of the bludgeon, and\nwhen men hoped two or five or twenty-five years of threatened\nincarceration might be all the same to Mr. Emilius. Could they have\nsucceeded in discovering where he had bought the weapon, his years\nof penal servitude would have afflicted him but little. They did not\nsucceed; and though it cannot be said that any mystery was attached\nto the Bonteen murder, it has remained one of those crimes which are\nunavenged by the flagging law. And so the Rev. Mr. Emilius will pass\naway from our story.\n\nThere must be one or two words further respecting poor little\nLizzie Eustace. She still had her income almost untouched, having\nbeen herself unable to squander it during her late married life,\nand having succeeded in saving it from the clutches of her pseudo\nhusband. And she had her title, of which no one could rob her, and\nher castle down in Ayrshire,--which, however, as a place of residence\nshe had learned to hate most thoroughly. Nor had she done anything\nwhich of itself must necessarily have put her out of the pale of\nsociety. As a married woman she had had no lovers; and, when a widow,\nvery little fault in that line had been brought home against her. But\nthe world at large seemed to be sick of her. Mrs. Bonteen had been\nher best friend, and, while it was still thought that Phineas Finn\nhad committed the murder, with Mrs. Bonteen she had remained. But\nit was impossible that the arrangement should be continued when it\nbecame known,--for it was known,--that Mr. Bonteen had been murdered\nby the man who was still Lizzie's reputed husband. Not that Lizzie\nperceived this,--though she was averse to the idea of her husband\nhaving been a murderer. But Mrs. Bonteen perceived it, and told her\nfriend that she must--go. It was most unwillingly that the wretched\nwidow changed her faith as to the murderer; but at last she found\nherself bound to believe as the world believed; and then she hinted\nto the wife of Mr. Emilius that she had better find another home.\n\n\"I don't believe it a bit,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"It is not a subject I can discuss,\" said the widow.\n\n\"And I don't see that it makes any difference. He isn't my husband.\nYou have said that yourself very often, Mrs. Bonteen.\"\n\n\"It is better that we shouldn't be together, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can go, of course, Mrs. Bonteen. There needn't be the\nslightest trouble about that. I had thought perhaps it might be\nconvenient; but of course you know best.\"\n\nShe went forth into lodgings in Half Moon Street, close to the scene\nof the murder, and was once more alone in the world. She had a child\nindeed, the son of her first husband, as to whom it behoved many to\nbe anxious, who stood high in rank and high in repute; but such had\nbeen Lizzie's manner of life that neither her own relations nor those\nof her husband could put up with her, or endure her contact. And yet\nshe was conscious of no special sins, and regarded herself as one who\nwith a tender heart of her own, and a too-confiding spirit, had been\nmuch injured by the cruelty of those with whom she had been thrown.\nNow she was alone, weeping in solitude, pitying herself with deepest\ncompassion; but it never occurred to her that there was anything in\nher conduct that she need alter. She would still continue to play her\ngame as before, would still scheme, would still lie; and might still,\nat last, land herself in that Elysium of life of which she had been\nalways dreaming. Poor Lizzie Eustace! Was it nature or education\nwhich had made it impossible to her to tell the truth, when a lie\ncame to her hand? Lizzie, the liar! Poor Lizzie!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nPHINEAS FINN RETURNS TO HIS DUTIES.\n\n\nThe election at Tankerville took place during the last week in July;\nand as Parliament was doomed to sit that year as late as the 10th\nof August, there was ample time for Phineas to present himself and\ntake the oaths before the Session was finished. He had calculated\nthat this could hardly be so when the matter of re-election was\nfirst proposed to him, and had hoped that his reappearance might be\ndeferred till the following year. But there he was, once more member\nfor Tankerville, while yet there was nearly a fortnight's work to be\ndone, pressed by his friends, and told by one or two of those whom he\nmost trusted, that he would neglect his duty and show himself to be\na coward, if he abstained from taking his place. \"Coward is a hard\nword,\" he said to Mr. Low, who had used it.\n\n\"So men think when this or that other man is accused of running away\nin battle or the like. Nobody will charge you with cowardice of that\nkind. But there is moral cowardice as well as physical.\"\n\n\"As when a man lies. I am telling no lie.\"\n\n\"But you are afraid to meet the eyes of your fellow-creatures.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. You may call me a coward if you like. What matters the\nname, if the charge be true? I have been so treated that I am afraid\nto meet the eyes of my fellow-creatures. I am like a man who has had\nhis knees broken, or his arms cut off. Of course I cannot be the same\nafterwards as I was before.\" Mr. Low said a great deal more to him on\nthe subject, and all that Mr. Low said was true; but he was somewhat\nrough, and did not succeed. Barrington Erle and Lord Cantrip also\ntried their eloquence upon him; but it was Mr. Monk who at last drew\nfrom him a promise that he would go down to the House and be sworn\nin early on a certain Tuesday afternoon. \"I am quite sure of this,\"\nMr. Monk had said, \"that the sooner you do it the less will be the\nannoyance. Indeed there will be no trouble in the doing of it. The\ntrouble is all in the anticipation, and is therefore only increased\nand prolonged by delay.\" \"Of course it is your duty to go at once,\"\nMr. Monk had said again, when his friend argued that he had never\nundertaken to sit before the expiration of Parliament. \"You did\nconsent to be put in nomination, and you owe your immediate services\njust as does any other member.\"\n\n\"If a man's grandmother dies he is held to be exempted.\"\n\n\"But your grandmother has not died, and your sorrow is not of the\nkind that requires or is supposed to require retirement.\" He gave way\nat last, and on the Tuesday afternoon Mr. Monk called for him at Mrs.\nBunce's house, and went down with him to Westminster. They reached\ntheir destination somewhat too soon, and walked the length of\nWestminster Hall two or three times while Phineas tried to justify\nhimself. \"I don't think,\" said he, \"that Low quite understands my\nposition when he calls me a coward.\"\n\n\"I am sure, Phineas, he did not mean to do that.\"\n\n\"Do not suppose that I am angry with him. I owe him a great deal too\nmuch for that. He is one of the few friends I have who are entitled\nto say to me just what they please. But I think he mistakes the\nmatter. When a man becomes crooked from age it is no good telling him\nto be straight. He'd be straight if he could. A man can't eat his\ndinner with a diseased liver as he could when he was well.\"\n\n\"But he may follow advice as to getting his liver in order again.\"\n\n\"And so am I following advice. But Low seems to think the disease\nshouldn't be there. The disease is there, and I can't banish it by\nsimply saying that it is not there. If they had hung me outright it\nwould be almost as reasonable to come and tell me afterwards to shake\nmyself and be again alive. I don't think that Low realises what it is\nto stand in the dock for a week together, with the eyes of all men\nfixed on you, and a conviction at your heart that every one there\nbelieves you to have been guilty of an abominable crime of which you\nknow yourself to have been innocent. For weeks I lived under the\nbelief that I was to be made away by the hangman, and to leave behind\nme a name that would make every one who has known me shudder.\"\n\n\"God in His mercy has delivered you from that.\"\n\n\"He has;--and I am thankful. But my back is not strong enough to bear\nthe weight without bending under it. Did you see Ratler going in?\nThere is a man I dread. He is intimate enough with me to congratulate\nme, but not friend enough to abstain, and he will be sure to say\nsomething about his murdered colleague. Very well;--I'll follow you.\nGo up rather quick, and I'll come close after you.\" Whereupon Mr.\nMonk entered between the two lamp-posts in the hall, and, hurrying\nalong the passages, soon found himself at the door of the House.\nPhineas, with an effort at composure, and a smile that was almost\nghastly at the door-keeper, who greeted him with some muttered word\nof recognition, held on his way close behind his friend, and walked\nup the House hardly conscious that the benches on each side were\nempty. There were not a dozen members present, and the Speaker had\nnot as yet taken the chair. Mr. Monk stood by him while he took the\noath, and in two minutes he was on a back seat below the gangway,\nwith his friend by him, while the members, in slowly increasing\nnumbers, took their seats. Then there were prayers, and as yet not a\nsingle man had spoken to him. As soon as the doors were again open\ngentlemen streamed in, and some few whom Phineas knew well came and\nsat near him. One or two shook hands with him, but no one said a word\nto him of the trial. No one at least did so in this early stage of\nthe day's proceedings; and after half an hour he almost ceased to be\nafraid.\n\nThen came up an irregular debate on the great Church question of the\nday, as to which there had been no cessation of the badgering with\nwhich Mr. Gresham had been attacked since he came into office. He\nhad thrown out Mr. Daubeny by opposing that gentleman's stupendous\nmeasure for disestablishing the Church of England altogether,\nalthough,--as was almost daily asserted by Mr. Daubeny and his\nfriends,--he was himself in favour of such total disestablishment.\nOver and over again Mr. Gresham had acknowledged that he was in\nfavour of disestablishment, protesting that he had opposed Mr.\nDaubeny's Bill without any reference to its merits,--solely on\nthe ground that such a measure should not be accepted from such a\nquarter. He had been stout enough, and, as his enemies had said,\ninsolent enough, in making these assurances. But still he was accused\nof keeping his own hand dark, and of omitting to say what bill he\nwould himself propose to bring in respecting the Church in the next\nSession. It was essentially necessary,--so said Mr. Daubeny and his\nfriends,--that the country should know and discuss the proposed\nmeasure during the vacation. There was, of course, a good deal of\nretaliation. Mr. Daubeny had not given the country, or even his own\nparty, much time to discuss his Church Bill. Mr. Gresham assured Mr.\nDaubeny that he would not feel himself equal to producing a measure\nthat should change the religious position of every individual in the\ncountry, and annihilate the traditions and systems of centuries,\naltogether complete out of his own unaided brain; and he went on\nto say that were he to do so, he did not think that he should find\nhimself supported in such an effort by the friends with whom he\nusually worked. On this occasion he declared that the magnitude of\nthe subject and the immense importance of the interests concerned\nforbade him to anticipate the passing of any measure of general\nChurch reform in the next Session. He was undoubtedly in favour of\nChurch reform, but was by no means sure that the question was one\nwhich required immediate settlement. Of this he was sure,--that\nnothing in the way of legislative indiscretion could be so injurious\nto the country, as any attempt at a hasty and ill-considered measure\non this most momentous of all questions.\n\nThe debate was irregular, as it originated with a question asked by\none of Mr. Daubeny's supporters,--but it was allowed to proceed for a\nwhile. In answer to Mr. Gresham, Mr. Daubeny himself spoke, accusing\nMr. Gresham of almost every known Parliamentary vice in having talked\nof a measure coming, like Minerva, from his, Mr. Daubeny's, own\nbrain. The plain and simple words by which such an accusation might\nnaturally be refuted would be unparliamentary; but it would not be\nunparliamentary to say that it was reckless, unfounded, absurd,\nmonstrous, and incredible. Then there were various very spirited\nreferences to Church matters, which concern us chiefly because\nMr. Daubeny congratulated the House upon seeing a Roman Catholic\ngentleman with whom they were all well acquainted, and whose presence\nin the House was desired by each side alike, again take his seat for\nan English borough. And he hoped that he might at the same time take\nthe liberty of congratulating that gentleman on the courage and manly\ndignity with which he had endured the unexampled hardships of the\ncruel position in which he had been placed by an untoward combination\nof circumstances. It was thought that Mr. Daubeny did the thing very\nwell, and that he was right in doing it;--but during the doing of\nit poor Phineas winced in agony. Of course every member was looking\nat him, and every stranger in the galleries. He did not know at\nthe moment whether it behoved him to rise and make some gesture to\nthe House, or to say a word, or to keep his seat and make no sign.\nThere was a general hum of approval, and the Prime Minister turned\nround and bowed graciously to the newly-sworn member. As he said\nafterwards, it was just this which he had feared. But there must\nsurely have been something of consolation in the general respect\nwith which he was treated. At the moment he behaved with natural\ninstinctive dignity, though himself doubting the propriety of his own\nconduct. He said not a word, and made no sign, but sat with his eyes\nfixed upon the member from whom the compliment had come. Mr. Daubeny\nwent on with his tirade, and was called violently to order. The\nSpeaker declared that the whole debate had been irregular, but had\nbeen allowed by him in deference to what seemed to be the general\nwill of the House. Then the two leaders of the two parties composed\nthemselves, throwing off their indignation while they covered\nthemselves well up with their hats,--and, in accordance with the\norder of the day, an honourable member rose to propose a pet measure\nof his own for preventing the adulteration of beer by the publicans.\nHe had made a calculation that the annual average mortality of\nEngland would be reduced one and a half per cent., or in other words\nthat every English subject born would live seven months longer if the\naction of the Legislature could provide that the publicans should\nsell the beer as it came from the brewers. Immediately there was\nsuch a rush of members to the door that not a word said by the\nphilanthropic would-be purifier of the national beverage could be\nheard. The quarrels of rival Ministers were dear to the House, and as\nlong as they could be continued the benches were crowded by gentlemen\nenthralled by the interest of the occasion. But to sink from that\nto private legislation about beer was to fall into a bathos which\ngentlemen could not endure; and so the House was emptied, and at\nabout half-past seven there was a count-out. That gentleman whose\nstatistics had been procured with so much care, and who had been at\nwork for the last twelve months on his effort to prolong the lives\nof his fellow-countrymen, was almost broken-hearted. But he knew the\nworld too well to complain. He would try again next year, if by dint\nof energetic perseverance he could procure a day.\n\nMr. Monk and Phineas Finn, behaving no better than the others,\nslipped out in the crowd. It had indeed been arranged that they\nshould leave the House early, so that they might dine together at\nMr. Monk's house. Though Phineas had been released from his prison\nnow for nearly a month, he had not as yet once dined out of his own\nrooms. He had not been inside a club, and hardly ventured during the\nday into the streets about Pall Mall and Piccadilly. He had been\nfrequently to Portman Square, but had not even seen Madame Goesler.\nNow he was to dine out for the first time; but there was to be no\nguest but himself.\n\n\"It wasn't so bad after all,\" said Mr. Monk, when they were seated\ntogether.\n\n\"At any rate it has been done.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and there will be no doing of it over again. I don't like Mr.\nDaubeny, as you know; but he is happy at that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"I hate men who are what you call happy, but who are never in\nearnest,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"He was earnest enough, I thought.\"\n\n\"I don't mean about myself, Mr. Monk. I suppose he thought that it\nwas suitable to the occasion that he should say something, and he\nsaid it neatly. But I hate men who can make capital out of occasions,\nwho can be neat and appropriate at the spur of the moment,--having,\nhowever, probably had the benefit of some forethought,--but whose\nwords never savour of truth. If I had happened to have been hung at\nthis time,--as was so probable,--Mr. Daubeny would have devoted one\nof his half hours to the composition of a dozen tragic words which\nalso would have been neat and appropriate. I can hear him say them\nnow, warning young members around him to abstain from embittered\nwords against each other, and I feel sure that the funereal grace\nof such an occasion would have become him even better than the\ngenerosity of his congratulations.\"\n\n\"It is rather grim matter for joking, Phineas.\"\n\n\"Grim enough; but the grimness and the jokes are always running\nthrough my mind together. I used to spend hours in thinking what my\ndear friends would say about it when they found that I had been hung\nin mistake;--how Sir Gregory Grogram would like it, and whether men\nwould think about it as they went home from The Universe at night.\nI had various questions to ask and answer for myself,--whether they\nwould pull up my poor body, for instance, from what unhallowed ground\nis used for gallows corpses, and give it decent burial, placing 'M.P.\nfor Tankerville' after my name on some more or less explicit tablet.\"\n\n\"Mr. Daubeny's speech was, perhaps, preferable on the whole.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was;--though I used to feel assured that the explicit\ntablet would be as clear to my eyes in purgatory as Mr. Daubeny's\nwords have been to my ears this afternoon. I never for a moment\ndoubted that the truth would be known before long,--but did doubt so\nvery much whether it would be known in time. I'll go home now, Mr.\nMonk, and endeavour to get the matter off my mind. I will resolve,\nat any rate, that nothing shall make me talk about it any more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nAT MATCHING.\n\n\nFor about a week in the August heat of a hot summer, Phineas attended\nParliament with fair average punctuality, and then prepared for his\njourney down to Matching Priory. During that week he spoke no word\nto any one as to his past tribulation, and answered all allusions to\nit simply by a smile. He had determined to live exactly as though\nthere had been no such episode in his life as that trial at the Old\nBailey, and in most respects he did so. During this week he dined at\nthe club, and called at Madame Goesler's house in Park Lane,--not,\nhowever, finding the lady at home. Once, and once only, did he break\ndown. On the Wednesday evening he met Barrington Erle, and was asked\nby him to go to The Universe. At the moment he became very pale, but\nhe at once said that he would go. Had Erle carried him off in a cab\nthe adventure might have been successful; but as they walked, and\nas they went together through Clarges Street and Bolton Row and\nCurzon Street, and as the scenes which had been so frequently and so\ngraphically described in Court appeared before him one after another,\nhis heart gave way, and he couldn't do it. \"I know I'm a fool,\nBarrington; but if you don't mind I'll go home. Don't mind me, but\njust go on.\" Then he turned and walked home, passing through the\npassage in which the murder had been committed.\n\n\"I brought him as far as the next street,\" Barrington Erle said to\none of their friends at the club, \"but I couldn't get him in. I doubt\nif he'll ever be here again.\"\n\nIt was past six o'clock in the evening when he reached Matching\nPriory. The Duchess had especially assured him that a brougham should\nbe waiting for him at the nearest station, and on arriving there he\nfound that he had the brougham to himself. He had thought a great\ndeal about it, and had endeavoured to make his calculations. He knew\nthat Madame Goesler would be at Matching, and it would be necessary\nthat he should say something of his thankfulness at their first\nmeeting. But how should he meet her,--and in what way should he\ngreet her when they met? Would any arrangement be made, or would all\nbe left to chance? Should he go at once to his own chamber,--so as\nto show himself first when dressed for dinner, or should he allow\nhimself to be taken into any of the morning rooms in which the other\nguests would be congregated? He had certainly not sufficiently\nconsidered the character of the Duchess when he imagined that she\nwould allow these things to arrange themselves. She was one of those\nwomen whose minds were always engaged on such matters, and who are\nable to see how things will go. It must not be asserted of her\nthat her delicacy was untainted, or her taste perfect; but she was\nclever,--discreet in the midst of indiscretions,--thoughtful, and\ngood-natured. She had considered it all, arranged it all, and given\nher orders with accuracy. When Phineas entered the hall,--the\nbrougham with the luggage having been taken round to some back\ndoor,--he was at once ushered by a silent man in black into the\nlittle sitting-room on the ground floor in which the old Duke\nused to take delight. Here he found two ladies,--but only two\nladies,--waiting to receive him. The Duchess came forward to welcome\nhim, while Madame Goesler remained in the background, with composed\nface,--as though she by no means expected his arrival and he had\nchanced to come upon them as she was standing by the window. He was\nthinking of her much more than of her companion, though he knew\nalso how much he owed to the kindness of the Duchess. But what she\nhad done for him had come from caprice, whereas the other had been\ninstigated and guided by affection. He understood all that, and must\nhave shown his feeling on his countenance. \"Yes, there she is,\" said\nthe Duchess, laughing. She had already told him that he was welcome\nto Matching, and had spoken some short word of congratulation at his\nsafe deliverance from his troubles. \"If ever one friend was grateful\nto another, you should be grateful to her, Mr. Finn.\" He did not\nspeak, but walking across the room to the window by which Marie\nGoesler stood, took her right hand in his, and passing his left arm\nround her waist, kissed her first on one cheek and then on the other.\nThe blood flew to her face and suffused her forehead, but she did not\nspeak, or resist him or make any effort to escape from his embrace.\nAs for him, he had no thought of it at all. He had made no plan. No\nidea of kissing her when they should meet had occurred to him till\nthe moment came. \"Excellently well done,\" said the Duchess, still\nlaughing with silent pleasant laughter. \"And now tell us how you are,\nafter all your troubles.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Yes, there she is.\"]\n\n\nHe remained with them for half an hour, till the ladies went to\ndress, when he was handed over to some groom of the chambers to show\nhim his room. \"The Duke ought to be here to welcome you, of course,\"\nsaid the Duchess; \"but you know official matters too well to expect\na President of the Board of Trade to do his domestic duties. We dine\nat eight; five minutes before that time he will begin adding up his\nlast row of figures for the day. You never added up rows of figures,\nI think. You only managed colonies.\" So they parted till dinner, and\nPhineas remembered how very little had been spoken by Madame Goesler,\nand how few of the words which he had spoken had been addressed to\nher. She had sat silent, smiling, radiant, very beautiful as he had\nthought, but contented to listen to her friend the Duchess. She, the\nDuchess, had asked questions of all sorts, and made many statements;\nand he had found that with those two women he could speak without\ndiscomfort, almost with pleasure, on subjects which he could not bear\nto have touched by men. \"Of course you knew all along who killed the\npoor man,\" the Duchess had said. \"We did;--did we not, Marie?--just\nas well as if we had seen it. She was quite sure that he had got out\nof the house and back into it, and that he must have had a key. So\nshe started off to Prague to find the key; and she found it. And we\nwere quite sure too about the coat;--weren't we. That poor blundering\nLord Fawn couldn't explain himself, but we knew that the coat he saw\nwas quite different from any coat you would wear in such weather.\nWe discussed it all over so often;--every point of it. Poor Lord\nFawn! They say it has made quite an old man of him. And as for those\npolicemen who didn't find the life-preserver; I only think that\nsomething ought to be done to them.\"\n\n\"I hope that nothing will ever be done to anybody, Duchess.\"\n\n\"Not to the Reverend Mr. Emilius;--poor dear Lady Eustace's Mr.\nEmilius? I do think that you ought to desire that an end should\nbe put to his enterprising career! I'm sure I do.\" This was said\nwhile the attempt was still being made to trace the purchase of the\nbludgeon in Paris. \"We've got Sir Gregory Grogram here on purpose to\nmeet you, and you must fraternise with him immediately, to show that\nyou bear no grudge.\"\n\n\"He only did his duty.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--though I think he was an addle-pated old ass not to see\nthe thing more clearly. As you'll be coming into the Government\nbefore long, we thought that things had better be made straight\nbetween you and Sir Gregory. I wonder how it was that nobody but\nwomen did see it clearly? Look at that delightful woman, Mrs. Bunce.\nYou must bring Mrs. Bunce to me some day,--or take me to her.\"\n\n\"Lord Chiltern saw it clearly enough,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Finn, Lord Chiltern is the best fellow in the world, but\nhe has only one idea. He was quite sure of your innocence because\nyou ride to hounds. If it had been found possible to accuse poor\nMr. Fothergill, he would have been as certain that Mr. Fothergill\ncommitted the murder, because Mr. Fothergill thinks more of his\nshooting. However, Lord Chiltern is to be here in a day or two, and\nI mean to go absolutely down on my knees to him,--and all for your\nsake. If foxes can be had, he shall have foxes. We must go and dress\nnow, Mr. Finn, and I'll ring for somebody to show you your room.\"\n\nPhineas, as soon as he was alone, thought, not of what the Duchess\nhad said, but of the manner in which he had greeted his friend,\nMadame Goesler. As he remembered what he had done, he also blushed.\nHad she been angry with him, and intended to show her anger by her\nsilence? And why had he done it? What had he meant? He was quite sure\nthat he would not have given those kisses had he and Madame Goesler\nbeen alone in the room together. The Duchess had applauded him,--but\nyet he thought that he regretted it. There had been matters between\nhim and Marie Goesler of which he was quite sure that the Duchess\nknew nothing.\n\nWhen he went downstairs he found a crowd in the drawing-room, from\namong whom the Duke came forward to welcome him. \"I am particularly\nhappy to see you at Matching,\" said the Duke. \"I wish we had shooting\nto offer you, but we are too far south for the grouse. That was\na bitter passage of arms the other day, wasn't it? I am fond of\nbitterness in debate myself, but I do regret the roughness of the\nHouse of Commons. I must confess that I do.\" The Duke did not say a\nword about the trial, and the Duke's guests followed their host's\nexample.\n\nThe house was full of people, most of whom had before been known\nto Phineas, and many of whom had been asked specially to meet him.\nLord and Lady Cantrip were there, and Mr. Monk, and Sir Gregory his\naccuser, and the Home Secretary, Sir Harry Coldfoot, with his wife.\nSir Harry had at one time been very keen about hanging our hero,\nand was now of course hot with reactionary zeal. To all those who\nhad been in any way concerned in the prosecution, the accidents by\nwhich Phineas had been enabled to escape had been almost as fortunate\nas to Phineas himself. Sir Gregory himself quite felt that had he\nprosecuted an innocent and very popular young Member of Parliament to\nthe death, he could never afterwards have hoped to wear his ermine in\ncomfort. Barrington Erle was there, of course, intending, however,\nto return to the duties of his office on the following day,--and our\nold friend Laurence Fitzgibbon with a newly-married wife, a lady\npossessing a reputed fifty thousand pounds, by which it was hoped\nthat the member for Mayo might be placed steadily upon his legs\nfor ever. And Adelaide Palliser was there also,--the Duke's first\ncousin,--on whose behalf the Duchess was anxious to be more than\nordinarily good-natured. Mr. Maule, Adelaide's rejected lover, had\ndined on one occasion with the Duke and Duchess in London. There\nhad been nothing remarkable at the dinner, and he had not at all\nunderstood why he had been asked. But when he took his leave the\nDuchess had told him that she would hope to see him at Matching. \"We\nexpect a friend of yours to be with us,\" the Duchess had said. He had\nafterwards received a written invitation and had accepted it; but he\nwas not to reach Matching till the day after that on which Phineas\narrived. Adelaide had been told of his coming only on this morning,\nand had been much flurried by the news.\n\n\"But we have quarrelled,\" she said. \"Then the best thing you can do\nis to make it up again, my dear,\" said the Duchess. Miss Palliser was\nundoubtedly of that opinion herself, but she hardly believed that so\nterrible an evil as a quarrel with her lover could be composed by so\nrough a remedy as this. The Duchess, who had become used to all the\ndisturbing excitements of life, and who didn't pay so much respect as\nsome do to the niceties of a young lady's feelings, thought that it\nwould be only necessary to bring the young people together again. If\nshe could do that, and provide them with an income, of course they\nwould marry. On the present occasion Phineas was told off to take\nMiss Palliser down to dinner. \"You saw the Chilterns before they left\ntown, I know,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I am constantly in Portman Square.\"\n\n\"Of course. Lady Laura has gone down to Scotland;--has she not;--and\nall alone?\"\n\n\"She is alone now, I believe.\"\n\n\"How dreadful! I do not know any one that I pity so much as I do her.\nI was in the house with her some time, and she gave me the idea of\nbeing the most unhappy woman I had ever met with. Don't you think\nthat she is very unhappy?\"\n\n\"She has had very much to make her so,\" said Phineas. \"She was\nobliged to leave her husband because of the gloom of his\ninsanity;--and now she is a widow.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she ever really--cared for him; did she?\" The\nquestion was no sooner asked than the poor girl remembered the\nwhole story which she had heard some time back,--the rumour of the\nhusband's jealousy and of the wife's love, and she became as red as\nfire, and unable to help herself. She could think of no word to say,\nand confessed her confusion by her sudden silence.\n\nPhineas saw it all, and did his best for her. \"I am sure she cared\nfor him,\" he said, \"though I do not think it was a well-assorted\nmarriage. They had different ideas about religion, I fancy. So you\nsaw the hunting in the Brake country to the end? How is our old\nfriend, Mr. Spooner?\"\n\n\"Don't talk of him, Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"I rather like Mr. Spooner;--and as for hunting the country, I don't\nthink Chiltern could get on without him. What a capital fellow your\ncousin the Duke is.\"\n\n\"I hardly know him.\"\n\n\"He is such a gentleman;--and, at the same time, the most abstract\nand the most concrete man that I know.\"\n\n\"Abstract and concrete!\"\n\n\"You are bound to use adjectives of that sort now, Miss Palliser, if\nyou mean to be anybody in conversation.\"\n\n\"But how is my cousin concrete? He is always abstracted when I speak\nto him, I know.\"\n\n\"No Englishman whom I have met is so broadly and intuitively and\nunceremoniously imbued with the simplicity of the character of a\ngentleman. He could no more lie than he could eat grass.\"\n\n\"Is that abstract or concrete?\"\n\n\"That's abstract. And I know no one who is so capable of throwing\nhimself into one matter for the sake of accomplishing that one thing\nat a time. That's concrete.\" And so the red colour faded away from\npoor Adelaide's face, and the unpleasantness was removed.\n\n\"What do you think of Laurence's wife?\" Erle said to him late in the\nevening.\n\n\"I have only just seen her. The money is there, I suppose.\"\n\n\"The money is there, I believe; but then it will have to remain\nthere. He can't touch it. There's about \u00c2\u00a32,000 a-year, which will\nhave to go back to her family unless they have children.\"\n\n\"I suppose she's--forty?\"\n\n\"Well; yes, or perhaps forty-five. You were locked up at the time,\npoor fellow,--and had other things to think of; but all the interest\nwe had for anything beyond you through May and June was devoted to\nLaurence and his prospects. It was off and on, and on and off, and he\nwas in a most wretched condition. At last she wouldn't consent unless\nshe was to be asked here.\"\n\n\"And who managed it?\"\n\n\"Laurence came and told it all to the Duchess, and she gave him the\ninvitation at once.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Not the Duchess,--nor yet Laurence. So it may be untrue, you\nknow;--but I believe it. He did ask me whether he'd have to stand\nanother election at his marriage. He has been going in and out of\noffice so often, and always going back to the Co. Mayo at the expense\nof half a year's salary, that his mind had got confused, and he\ndidn't quite know what did and what did not vacate his seat. We\nmust all come to it sooner or later, I suppose, but the question is\nwhether we could do better than an annuity of \u00c2\u00a32,000 a year on the\nlife of the lady. Office isn't very permanent, but one has not to\nattend the House above six months a year, while you can't get away\nfrom a wife much above a week at a time. It has crippled him in\nappearance very much, I think.\"\n\n\"A man always looks changed when he's married.\"\n\n\"I hope, Mr. Finn, that you owe me no grudge,\" said Sir Gregory, the\nAttorney-General.\n\n\"Not in the least; why should I?\"\n\n\"It was a very painful duty that I had to perform,--the most painful\nthat ever befel me. I had no alternative but to do it, of course, and\nto do it in the hope of reaching the truth. But a counsel for the\nprosecution must always appear to the accused and his friends like\na hound running down his game, and anxious for blood. The habitual\nand almost necessary acrimony of the defence creates acrimony in the\nattack. If you were accustomed as I am to criminal courts you would\nobserve this constantly. A gentleman gets up and declares in perfect\nfaith that he is simply anxious to lay before the jury such evidence\nas has been placed in his hands. And he opens his case in that\nspirit. Then his witnesses are cross-examined with the affected\nincredulity and assumed indignation which the defending counsel is\nalmost bound to use on behalf of his client, and he finds himself\ngradually imbued with pugnacity. He becomes strenuous, energetic, and\nperhaps eager for what must after all be regarded as success, and at\nlast he fights for a verdict rather than for the truth.\"\n\n\"The judge, I suppose, ought to put all that right?\"\n\n\"So he does;--and it comes right. Our criminal practice does not sin\non the side of severity. But a barrister employed on the prosecution\nshould keep himself free from that personal desire for a verdict\nwhich must animate those engaged on the defence.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose you wanted to--hang me, Sir Gregory.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I wanted the truth. But you in your position must\nhave regarded me as a bloodhound.\"\n\n\"I did not. As far as I can analyse my own feelings, I entertained\nanger only against those who, though they knew me well, thought that\nI was guilty.\"\n\n\"You will allow me, at any rate, to shake hands with you,\" said Sir\nGregory, \"and to assure you that I should have lived a broken-hearted\nman if the truth had been known too late. As it is I tremble and\nshake in my shoes as I walk about and think of what might have been\ndone.\" Then Phineas gave his hand to Sir Gregory, and from that time\nforth was inclined to think well of Sir Gregory.\n\nThroughout the whole evening he was unable to speak to Madame\nGoesler, but to the other people around him he found himself talking\nquite at his ease, as though nothing peculiar had happened to him.\nAlmost everybody, except the Duke, made some slight allusion to his\nadventure, and he, in spite of his resolution to the contrary, found\nhimself driven to talk of it. It had seemed quite natural that Sir\nGregory,--who had in truth been eager for his condemnation, thinking\nhim to have been guilty,--should come to him and make peace with him\nby telling him of the nature of the work that had been imposed upon\nhim;--and when Sir Harry Coldfoot assured him that never in his life\nhad his mind been relieved of so heavy a weight as when he received\nthe information about the key,--that also was natural. A few days ago\nhe had thought that these allusions would kill him. The prospect of\nthem had kept him a prisoner in his lodgings; but now he smiled and\nchatted, and was quiet and at ease.\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Finn,\" the Duchess said to him, \"I know the people\nhave been boring you.\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"I saw Sir Gregory at it, and I can guess what Sir Gregory was\ntalking about.\"\n\n\"I like Sir Gregory, Duchess.\"\n\n\"That shows a very Christian disposition on your part. And then there\nwas Sir Harry. I understood it all, but I could not hinder it. But it\nhad to be done, hadn't it?--And now there will be an end of it.\"\n\n\"Everybody has treated me very well,\" said Phineas, almost in tears.\n\"Some people have been so kind to me that I cannot understand why it\nshould have been so.\"\n\n\"Because some people are your very excellent good friends. We,--that\nis, Marie and I, you know,--thought it would be the best thing for\nyou to come down and get through it all here. We could see that you\nweren't driven too hard. By the bye, you have hardly seen her,--have\nyou?\"\n\n\"Hardly, since I was upstairs with your Grace.\"\n\n\"My Grace will manage better for you to-morrow. I didn't like to tell\nyou to take her out to dinner, because it would have looked a little\nparticular after her very remarkable journey to Prague. If you ain't\ngrateful you must be a wretch.\"\n\n\"But I am grateful.\"\n\n\"Well; we shall see. Good-night. You'll find a lot of men going to\nsmoke somewhere, I don't doubt.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\nTHE TRUMPETON FEUD IS SETTLED.\n\n\nIn these fine early autumn days spent at Matching, the great\nTrumpeton Wood question was at last settled. During the summer\nconsiderable acerbity had been added to the matter by certain\narticles which had appeared in certain sporting papers, in which the\nnew Duke of Omnium was accused of neglecting his duty to the county\nin which a portion of his property lay. The question was argued at\nconsiderable length. Is a landed proprietor bound, or is he not,\nto keep foxes for the amusement of his neighbours? To ordinary\nthinkers, to unprejudiced outsiders,--to Americans, let us say, or\nFrenchmen,--there does not seem to be room even for an argument. By\nwhat law of God or man can a man be bound to maintain a parcel of\ninjurious vermin on his property, in the pursuit of which he finds no\nsport himself, and which are highly detrimental to another sport in\nwhich he takes, perhaps, the keenest interest? Trumpeton Wood was the\nDuke's own,--to do just as he pleased with it. Why should foxes be\ndemanded from him then any more than a bear to be baited, or a badger\nto be drawn, in, let us say, his London dining-room? But a good deal\nhad been said which, though not perhaps capable of convincing the\nunprejudiced American or Frenchman, had been regarded as cogent\narguments to country-bred Englishmen. The Brake Hunt had been\nestablished for a great many years, and was the central attraction of\na district well known for its hunting propensities. The preservation\nof foxes might be an open question in such counties as Norfolk and\nSuffolk, but could not be so in the Brake country. Many things are,\nno doubt, permissible under the law, which, if done, would show the\ndoer of them to be the enemy of his species,--and this destruction\nof foxes in a hunting country may be named as one of them. The Duke\nmight have his foxes destroyed if he pleased, but he could hardly\ndo so and remain a popular magnate in England. If he chose to put\nhimself in opposition to the desires and very instincts of the people\namong whom his property was situated, he must live as a \"man forbid.\"\nThat was the general argument, and then there was the argument\nspecial to this particular case. As it happened, Trumpeton Wood\nwas, and always had been, the great nursery of foxes for that side\nof the Brake country. Gorse coverts make, no doubt, the charm of\nhunting, but gorse coverts will not hold foxes unless the woodlands\nbe preserved. The fox is a travelling animal. Knowing well that\n\"home-staying youths have ever homely wits,\" he goes out and sees the\nworld. He is either born in the woodlands, or wanders thither in his\nearly youth. If all foxes so wandering be doomed to death, if poison,\nand wires, and traps, and hostile keepers await them there instead\nof the tender welcome of the loving fox-preserver, the gorse coverts\nwill soon be empty, and the whole country will be afflicted with a\nwild dismay. All which Lord Chiltern understood well when he became\nso loud in his complaint against the Duke.\n\nBut our dear old friend, only the other day a duke, Planty Pall as he\nwas lately called, devoted to work and to Parliament, an unselfish,\nfriendly, wise man, who by no means wanted other men to cut their\ncoats according to his pattern, was the last man in England to put\nhimself forward as the enemy of an established delight. He did not\nhunt himself,--but neither did he shoot, or fish, or play cards. He\nrecreated himself with Blue Books, and speculations on Adam Smith had\nbeen his distraction;--but he knew that he was himself peculiar, and\nhe respected the habits of others. It had fallen out in this wise. As\nthe old Duke had become very old, the old Duke's agent had gradually\nacquired more than an agent's proper influence in the property; and\nas the Duke's heir would not shoot himself, or pay attention to the\nshooting, and as the Duke would not let the shooting of his wood, Mr.\nFothergill, the steward, had gradually become omnipotent. Now Mr.\nFothergill was not a hunting man,--but the mischief did not at all\nlie there. Lord Chiltern would not communicate with Mr. Fothergill.\nLord Chiltern would write to the Duke, and Mr. Fothergill became an\nestablished enemy. Hinc ill\u00c3\u00a6 ir\u00c3\u00a6. From this source sprung all those\npowerfully argued articles in _The Field_, _Bell's Life_, and _Land\nand Water_;--for on this matter all the sporting papers were of one\nmind.\n\nThere is something doubtless absurd in the intensity of the worship\npaid to the fox by hunting communities. The animal becomes sacred,\nand his preservation is a religion. His irregular destruction is a\nprofanity, and words spoken to his injury are blasphemous. Not long\nsince a gentleman shot a fox running across a woodland ride in a\nhunting country. He had mistaken it for a hare, and had done the deed\nin the presence of keepers, owner, and friends. His feelings were so\nacute and his remorse so great that, in their pity, they had resolved\nto spare him; and then, on the spot, entered into a solemn compact\nthat no one should be told. Encouraged by the forbearing tenderness,\nthe unfortunate one ventured to return to the house of his friend,\nthe owner of the wood, hoping that, in spite of the sacrilege\ncommitted, he might be able to face a world that would be ignorant\nof his crime. As the vulpicide, on the afternoon of the day of the\ndeed, went along the corridor to his room, one maid-servant whispered\nto another, and the poor victim of an imperfect sight heard the\nwords--\"That's he as shot the fox!\" The gentleman did not appear at\ndinner, nor was he ever again seen in those parts.\n\nMr. Fothergill had become angry. Lord Chiltern, as we know, had been\nvery angry. And even the Duke was angry. The Duke was angry because\nLord Chiltern had been violent;--and Lord Chiltern had been violent\nbecause Mr. Fothergill's conduct had been, to his thinking, not only\nsacrilegious, but one continued course of wilful sacrilege. It may\nbe said of Lord Chiltern that in his eagerness as a master of hounds\nhe had almost abandoned his love of riding. To kill a certain number\nof foxes in the year, after the legitimate fashion, had become to\nhim the one great study of life;--and he did it with an energy equal\nto that which the Duke devoted to decimal coinage. His huntsman was\nalways well mounted, with two horses; but Lord Chiltern would give\nup his own to the man and take charge of a weary animal as a common\ngroom when he found that he might thus further the object of the\nday's sport. He worked as men work only at pleasure. He never missed\na day, even when cub-hunting required that he should leave his bed at\n3 A.M. He was constant at his kennel. He was always thinking about\nit. He devoted his life to the Brake Hounds. And it was too much for\nhim that such a one as Mr. Fothergill should be allowed to wire foxes\nin Trumpeton Wood! The Duke's property, indeed! Surely all that was\nunderstood in England by this time. Now he had consented to come\nto Matching, bringing his wife with him, in order that the matter\nmight be settled. There had been a threat that he would give up the\ncountry, in which case it was declared that it would be impossible\nto carry on the Brake Hunt in a manner satisfactory to masters,\nsubscribers, owners of coverts, or farmers, unless a different order\nof things should be made to prevail in regard to Trumpeton Wood.\n\nThe Duke, however, had declined to interfere personally. He had\ntold his wife that he should be delighted to welcome Lord and Lady\nChiltern,--as he would any other friends of hers. The guests, indeed,\nat the Duke's house were never his guests, but always hers. But he\ncould not allow himself to be brought into an argument with Lord\nChiltern as to the management of his own property. The Duchess was\nmade to understand that she must prevent any such awkwardness. And\nshe did prevent it. \"And now, Lord Chiltern,\" she said, \"how about\nthe foxes?\" She had taken care there should be a council of war\naround her. Lady Chiltern and Madame Goesler were present, and also\nPhineas Finn.\n\n\"Well;--how about them?\" said the lord, showing by the fiery\neagerness of his eye, and the increased redness of his face, that\nthough the matter had been introduced somewhat jocosely, there could\nnot really be any joke about it.\n\n\"Why couldn't you keep it all out of the newspapers?\"\n\n\"I don't write the newspapers, Duchess. I can't help the newspapers.\nWhen two hundred men ride through Trumpeton Wood, and see one fox\nfound, and that fox with only three pads, of course the newspapers\nwill say that the foxes are trapped.\"\n\n\"We may have traps if we like it, Lord Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Certainly;--only say so, and we shall know where we are.\" He looked\nvery angry, and poor Lady Chiltern was covered with dismay. \"The Duke\ncan destroy the hunt if he pleases, no doubt,\" said the lord.\n\n\"But we don't like traps, Lord Chiltern;--nor yet poison, nor\nanything that is wicked. I'd go and nurse the foxes myself if I knew\nhow, wouldn't I, Marie?\"\n\n\"They have robbed the Duchess of her sleep for the last six months,\"\nsaid Madame Goesler.\n\n\"And if they go on being not properly brought up and educated,\nthey'll make an old woman of me. As for the Duke, he can't be\ncomfortable in his arithmetic for thinking of them. But what can one\ndo?\"\n\n\"Change your keepers,\" said Lord Chiltern energetically.\n\n\"It is easy to say,--change your keepers. How am I to set about it?\nTo whom can I apply to appoint others? Don't you know what vested\ninterests mean, Lord Chiltern?\"\n\n\"Then nobody can manage his own property as he pleases?\"\n\n\"Nobody can,--unless he does the work himself. If I were to go and\nlive in Trumpeton Wood I could do it; but you see I have to live\nhere. I vote that we have an officer of State, to go in and out with\nthe Government,--with a seat in the Cabinet or not according as\nthings go, and that we call him Foxmaster-General. It would be just\nthe thing for Mr. Finn.\"\n\n\"There would be a salary, of course,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"Then I suppose that nothing can be done,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"My dear Lord Chiltern, everything has been done. Vested interests\nhave been attended to. Keepers shall prefer foxes to pheasants, wires\nshall be unheard of, and Trumpeton Wood shall once again be the glory\nof the Brake Hunt. It won't cost the Duke above a thousand or two a\nyear.\"\n\n\"I should be very sorry indeed to put the Duke to any unnecessary\nexpense,\" said Lord Chiltern solemnly,--still fearing that the\nDuchess was only playing with him. It made him angry that he could\nnot imbue other people with his idea of the seriousness of the\namusement of a whole county.\n\n\"Do not think of it. We have pensioned poor Mr. Fothergill, and he\nretires from the administration.\"\n\n\"Then it'll be all right,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said his wife.\n\n\"And so the great Mr. Fothergill falls from power, and goes down into\nobscurity,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"He was an impudent old man, and that's the truth,\" said the\nDuchess;--\"and he has always been my thorough detestation. But if you\nonly knew what I have gone through to get rid of him,--and all on\naccount of Trumpeton Wood,--you'd send me every brush taken in the\nBrake country during the next season.\"\n\n\"Your Grace shall at any rate have one of them,\" said Lord Chiltern.\n\nOn the next day Lord and Lady Chiltern went back to Harrington Hall.\nWhen the end of August comes, a Master of Hounds,--who is really a\nmaster,--is wanted at home. Nothing short of an embassy on behalf of\nthe great coverts of his country would have kept this master away at\npresent; and now, his diplomacy having succeeded, he hurried back to\nmake the most of its results. Lady Chiltern, before she went, made a\nlittle speech to Phineas Finn.\n\n\"You'll come to us in the winter, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"I should like.\"\n\n\"You must. No one was truer to you than we were, you know. Indeed,\nregarding you as we do, how should we not have been true? It was\nimpossible to me that my old friend should have been--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Chiltern!\"\n\n\"Of course you'll come. You owe it to us to come. And may I say this?\nIf there be anybody to come with you, that will make it only so much\nthe better. If it should be so, of course there will be letters\nwritten?\" To this question, however, Phineas Finn made no answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\nMADAME GOESLER'S LEGACY.\n\n\nOne morning, very shortly after her return to Harrington, Lady\nChiltern was told that Mr. Spooner of Spoon Hall had called, and\ndesired to see her. She suggested that the gentleman had probably\nasked for her husband,--who, at that moment, was enjoying his\nrecovered supremacy in the centre of Trumpeton Wood; but she was\nassured that on this occasion Mr. Spooner's mission was to herself.\nShe had no quarrel with Mr. Spooner, and she went to him at once.\nAfter the first greeting he rushed into the subject of the great\ntriumph. \"So we've got rid of Mr. Fothergill, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Fothergill will not, I believe, trouble us any more. He\nis an old man, it seems, and has retired from the Duke's service.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how glad I am, Lady Chiltern. We were afraid that\nChiltern would have thrown it up, and then I don't know where we\nshould have been. England would not have been England any longer, to\nmy thinking, if we hadn't won the day. It'd have been just like a\nFrench revolution. Nobody would have known what was coming or where\nhe was going.\"\n\nThat Mr. Spooner should be enthusiastic on any hunting question was a\nmatter of course; but still it seemed to be odd that he should have\ndriven himself over from Spoon Hall to pour his feelings into Lady\nChiltern's ear. \"We shall go on very nicely now, I don't doubt,\" said\nshe; \"and I'm sure that Lord Chiltern will be glad to find that you\nare pleased.\"\n\n\"I am very much pleased, I can tell you.\" Then he paused, and the\ntone of his voice was changed altogether when he spoke again. \"But\nI didn't come over only about that, Lady Chiltern. Miss Palliser has\nnot come back with you, Lady Chiltern?\"\n\n\"We left Miss Palliser at Matching. You know she is the Duke's\ncousin.\"\n\n\"I wish she wasn't, with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Why should you want to rob her of her relations, Mr. Spooner?\"\n\n\"Because-- because--. I don't want to say a word against her, Lady\nChiltern. To me she is perfect as a star;--beautiful as a rose.\"\nMr. Spooner as he said this pointed first to the heavens and then\nto the earth. \"But perhaps she wouldn't have been so proud of her\ngrandfather hadn't he been a Duke.\"\n\n\"I don't think she is proud of that.\"\n\n\"People do think of it, Lady Chiltern; and I don't say that they\nought not. Of course it makes a difference, and when a man lives\naltogether in the country, as I do, it seems to signify so much\nmore. But if you go back to old county families, Lady Chiltern, the\nSpooners have been here pretty nearly as long as the Pallisers,--if\nnot longer. The Desponders, from whom we come, came over with William\nthe Conqueror.\"\n\n\"I have always heard that there isn't a more respectable family in\nthe county.\"\n\n\"That there isn't. There was a grant of land, which took their name,\nand became the Manor of Despond; there's where Spoon Hall is now. Sir\nThomas Desponder was one of those who demanded the Charter, though\nhis name wasn't always given because he wasn't a baron. Perhaps Miss\nPalliser does not know all that.\"\n\n\"I doubt whether she cares about those things.\"\n\n\"Women do care about them,--very much. Perhaps she has heard of the\ntwo spoons crossed, and doesn't know that that was a stupid vulgar\npractical joke. Our crest is a knight's head bowed, with the motto,\n'Desperandum.' Soon after the Conquest one of the Desponders fell in\nlove with the Queen, and never would give it up, though it wasn't\nany good. Her name was Matilda, and so he went as a Crusader and got\nkilled. But wherever he went he had the knight's head bowed, and the\nmotto on the shield.\"\n\n\"What a romantic story, Mr. Spooner!\"\n\n\"Isn't it? And it's quite true. That's the way we became Spooners. I\nnever told her of it, but, somehow I wish I had now. It always seemed\nthat she didn't think that I was anybody.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Mr. Spooner, that she was always thinking that\nsomebody else was everything. When a gentleman is told that a lady's\naffections have been pre-engaged, however much he may regret the\ncircumstances, he cannot, I think, feel any hurt to his pride. If I\nunderstand the matter, Miss Palliser explained to you that she was\nengaged when first you spoke to her.\"\n\n\"You are speaking of young Gerard Maule.\"\n\n\"Of course I am speaking of Mr. Maule.\"\n\n\"But she has quarrelled with him, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\n\"Don't you know what such quarrels come to?\"\n\n\"Well, no. That is to say, everybody tells me that it is really\nbroken off, and that he has gone nobody knows where. At any rate he\nnever shows himself. He doesn't mean it, Lady Chiltern.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he means.\"\n\n\"And he can't afford it, Lady Chiltern. I mean it, and I can afford\nit. Surely that might go for something.\"\n\n\"I cannot say what Mr. Maule may mean to do, Mr. Spooner, but I think\nit only fair to tell you that he is at present staying at Matching,\nunder the same roof with Miss Palliser.\"\n\n\"Maule staying at the Duke's!\" When Mr. Spooner heard this there\ncame a sudden change over his face. His jaw fell, and his mouth was\nopened, and the redness of his cheeks flew up to his forehead.\n\n\"He was expected there yesterday, and I need hardly suggest to you\nwhat will be the end of the quarrel.\"\n\n\"Going to the Duke's won't give him an income.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that, Mr. Spooner. But it really seems to me\nthat you misinterpret the nature of the affections of such a girl as\nMiss Palliser. Do you think it likely that she should cease to love a\nman because he is not so rich as another?\"\n\n\"People, when they are married, want a house to live in, Lady\nChiltern. Now at Spoon Hall--\"\n\n\"Believe me, that is in vain, Mr. Spooner.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure of it?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"I'd have done anything for her,--anything! She might have had what\nsettlements she pleased. I told Ned that he must go, if she made a\npoint of it. I'd have gone abroad, or lived just anywhere. I'd come\nto that, that I didn't mind the hunting a bit.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you,--I am indeed.\"\n\n\"It cuts a fellow all to pieces so! And yet what is it all about? A\nslip of a girl that isn't anything so very much out of the way after\nall. Lady Chiltern, I shouldn't care if the horse kicked the trap all\nto pieces going back to Spoon Hall, and me with it.\"\n\n\"You'll get over it, Mr. Spooner.\"\n\n\"Get over it! I suppose I shall; but I shall never be as I was. I've\nbeen always thinking of the day when there must be a lady at Spoon\nHall, and putting it off, you know. There'll never be a lady there\nnow;--never. You don't think there's any chance at all?\"\n\n\"I'm sure there is none.\"\n\n\"I'd give half I've got in all the world,\" said the wretched man,\n\"just to get it out of my head. I know what it will come to.\" Though\nhe paused, Lady Chiltern could ask no question respecting Mr.\nSpooner's future prospects. \"It'll be two bottles of champagne at\ndinner, and two bottles of claret afterwards, every day. I only hope\nshe'll know that she did it. Good-bye, Lady Chiltern. I thought that\nperhaps you'd have helped me.\"\n\n\"I cannot help you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\" So he went down to his trap, and drove himself violently\nhome,--without, however, achieving the ruin which he desired. Let\nus hope that as time cures his wound that threat as to increased\nconsumption of wine may fall to the ground unfulfilled.\n\nIn the meantime Gerard Maule had arrived at Matching Priory.\n\n\"We have quarrelled,\" Adelaide had said when the Duchess told her\nthat her lover was to come. \"Then you had better make it up again,\"\nthe Duchess had answered,--and there had been an end of it. Nothing\nmore was done; no arrangement was made, and Adelaide was left to\nmeet the man as best she might. The quarrel to her had been as the\ndisruption of the heavens. She had declared to herself that she would\nbear it; but the misfortune to be borne was a broken world falling\nabout her own ears. She had thought of a nunnery, of Ophelia among\nthe water-lilies, and of an early death-bed. Then she had pictured\nto herself the somewhat ascetic and very laborious life of an old\nmaiden lady whose only recreation fifty years hence should consist\nin looking at the portrait of him who had once been her lover. And\nnow she was told that he was coming to Matching as though nothing\nhad been the matter! She tried to think whether it was not her duty\nto have her things at once packed, and ask for a carriage to take\nher to the railway station. But she was in the house of her nearest\nrelative,--of him and also of her who were bound to see that things\nwere right; and then there might be a more pleasureable existence\nthan that which would have to depend on a photograph for its keenest\ndelight. But how should she meet him? In what way should she address\nhim? Should she ignore the quarrel, or recognize it, or take some\nmilder course? She was half afraid of the Duchess, and could not ask\nfor assistance. And the Duchess, though good-natured, seemed to her\nto be rough. There was nobody at Matching to whom she could say a\nword;--so she lived on, and trembled, and doubted from hour to hour\nwhether the world would not come to an end.\n\nThe Duchess was rough, but she was very good-natured. She had\ncontrived that the two lovers should be brought into the same house,\nand did not doubt at all but what they would be able to adjust their\nown little differences when they met. Her experiences of the world\nhad certainly made her more alive to the material prospects than to\nthe delicate aroma of a love adventure. She had been greatly knocked\nabout herself, and the material prospects had come uppermost. But all\nthat had happened to her had tended to open her hand to other people,\nand had enabled her to be good-natured with delight, even when\nshe knew that her friends imposed upon her. She didn't care much\nfor Laurence Fitzgibbon; but when she was told that the lady with\nmoney would not consent to marry the aristocratic pauper except on\ncondition that she should be received at Matching, the Duchess at\nonce gave the invitation. And now, though she couldn't go into the\n\"fal-lallery,\"--as she called it, to Madame Goesler,--of settling\na meeting between two young people who had fallen out, she worked\nhard till she accomplished something perhaps more important to their\nfuture happiness. \"Plantagenet,\" she said, \"there can be no objection\nto your cousin having that money.\"\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"Oh come; you must remember about Adelaide, and that young man who is\ncoming here to-day.\"\n\n\"You told me that Adelaide is to be married. I don't know anything\nabout the young man.\"\n\n\"His name is Maule, and he is a gentleman, and all that. Some day\nwhen his father dies he'll have a small property somewhere.\"\n\n\"I hope he has a profession.\"\n\n\"No, he has not. I told you all that before.\"\n\n\"If he has nothing at all, Glencora, why did he ask a young lady to\nmarry him?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear; what's the good of going into all that? He has got\nsomething. They'll do immensely well, if you'll only listen. She is\nyour first cousin.\"\n\n\"Of course she is,\" said Plantagenet, lifting up his hand to his\nhair.\n\n\"And you are bound to do something for her.\"\n\n\"No; I am not bound. But I'm very willing,--if you wish it. Put the\nthing on a right footing.\"\n\n\"I hate footings,--that is, right footings. We can manage this\nwithout taking money out of your pocket.\"\n\n\"My dear Glencora, if I am to give my cousin money I shall do so by\nputting my hand into my own pocket in preference to that of any other\nperson.\"\n\n\"Madame Goesler says that she'll sign all the papers about the Duke's\nlegacy,--the money, I mean,--if she may be allowed to make it over to\nthe Duke's niece.\"\n\n\"Of course Madame Goesler may do what she likes with her own. I\ncannot hinder her. But I would rather that you should not interfere.\nTwenty-five thousand pounds is a very serious sum of money.\"\n\n\"You won't take it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Nor will Madame Goesler; and therefore there can be no reason why\nthese young people should not have it. Of course Adelaide being the\nDuke's niece does make a difference. Why else should I care about it?\nShe is nothing to me,--and as for him, I shouldn't know him again if\nI were to meet him in the street.\"\n\nAnd so the thing was settled. The Duke was powerless against the\nenergy of his wife, and the lawyer was instructed that Madame Goesler\nwould take the proper steps for putting herself into possession of\nthe Duke's legacy,--as far as the money was concerned,--with the view\nof transferring it to the Duke's niece, Miss Adelaide Palliser. As\nfor the diamonds, the difficulty could not be solved. Madame Goesler\nstill refused to take them, and desired her lawyer to instruct her\nas to the form by which she could most thoroughly and conclusively\nrenounce that legacy.\n\nGerard Maule had his ideas about the meeting which would of course\ntake place at Matching. He would not, he thought, have been asked\nthere had it not been intended that he should marry Adelaide. He did\nnot care much for the grandeur of the Duke and Duchess, but he was\nconscious of certain profitable advantages which might accrue from\nsuch an acknowledgement of his position from the great relatives of\nhis intended bride. It would be something to be married from the\nhouse of the Duchess, and to receive his wife from the Duke's hand.\nHis father would probably be driven to acquiesce, and people who were\nalmost omnipotent in the world would at any rate give him a start.\nHe expected no money; nor did he possess that character, whether it\nbe good or bad, which is given to such expectation. But there would\nbe encouragement, and the thing would probably be done. As for the\nmeeting,--he would take her in his arms if he found her alone, and\nbeg her pardon for that cross word about Boulogne. He would assure\nher that Boulogne itself would be a heaven to him if she were with\nhim,--and he thought that she would believe him. When he reached the\nhouse he was asked into a room in which a lot of people were playing\nbilliards or crowded round a billiard-table. The Chilterns were gone,\nand he was at first ill at ease, finding no friend. Madame Goesler,\nwho had met him at Harrington, came up to him, and told him that\nthe Duchess would be there directly, and then Phineas, who had been\nplaying at the moment of his entrance, shook hands with him, and said\na word or two about the Chilterns. \"I was so delighted to hear of\nyour acquittal,\" said Maule.\n\n\"We never talk about that now,\" said Phineas, going back to his\nstroke. Adelaide Palliser was not present, and the difficulty of\nthe meeting had not yet been encountered. They all remained in the\nbilliard-room till it was time for the ladies to dress, and Adelaide\nhad not yet ventured to show herself. Somebody offered to take him to\nhis room, and he was conducted upstairs, and told that they dined at\neight,--but nothing had been arranged. Nobody had as yet mentioned\nher name to him. Surely it could not be that she had gone away when\nshe heard that he was coming, and that she was really determined to\nmake the quarrel perpetual? He had three quarters of an hour in which\nto get ready for dinner, and he felt himself to be uncomfortable and\nout of his element. He had been sent to his chamber prematurely,\nbecause nobody had known what to do with him; and he wished\nhimself back in London. The Duchess, no doubt, had intended to be\ngood-natured, but she had made a mistake. So he sat by his open\nwindow, and looked out on the ruins of the old Priory, which were\nclose to the house, and wondered why he mightn't have been allowed to\nwander about the garden instead of being shut up there in a bedroom.\nBut he felt that it would be unwise to attempt any escape now. He\nwould meet the Duke or the Duchess, or perhaps Adelaide herself, in\nsome of the passages,--and there would be an embarrassment. So he\ndawdled away the time, looking out of the window as he dressed, and\ndescended to the drawing room at eight o'clock. He shook hands with\nthe Duke, and was welcomed by the Duchess, and then glanced round the\nroom. There she was, seated on a sofa between two other ladies,--of\nwhom one was his friend, Madame Goesler. It was essentially necessary\nthat he should notice her in some way, and he walked up to her, and\noffered her his hand. It was impossible that he should allude to what\nwas past, and he merely muttered something as he stood over her. She\nhad blushed up to her eyes, and was absolutely dumb. \"Mr. Maule,\nperhaps you'll take our cousin Adelaide out to dinner,\" said the\nDuchess, a moment afterwards, whispering in his ear.\n\n\"Have you forgiven me?\" he said to her, as they passed from one room\nto the other.\n\n\"I will,--if you care to be forgiven.\" The Duchess had been quite\nright, and the quarrel was all over without any arrangement.\n\nOn the following morning he was allowed to walk about the grounds\nwithout any impediment, and to visit the ruins which had looked so\ncharming to him from the window. Nor was he alone. Miss Palliser was\nnow by no means anxious as she had been yesterday to keep out of the\nway, and was willingly persuaded to show him all the beauties of the\nplace.\n\n\"I shouldn't have said what I did, I know,\" pleaded Maule.\n\n\"Never mind it now, Gerard.\"\n\n\"I mean about going to Boulogne.\"\n\n\"It did sound so melancholy.\"\n\n\"But I only meant that we should have to be very careful how we\nlived. I don't know quite whether I am so good at being careful about\nmoney as a fellow ought to be.\"\n\n\"You must take a lesson from me, sir.\"\n\n\"I have sent the horses to Tattersall's,\" he said in a tone that was\nalmost funereal.\n\n\"What!--already?\"\n\n\"I gave the order yesterday. They are to be sold,--I don't know when.\nThey won't fetch anything. They never do. One always buys bad horses\nthere for a lot of money, and sells good ones for nothing. Where the\ndifference goes to I never could make out.\"\n\n\"I suppose the man gets it who sells them.\"\n\n\"No; he don't. The fellows get it who have their eyes open. My eyes\nnever were open,--except as far as seeing you went.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if you had opened them wider you wouldn't have to go to--\"\n\n\"Don't, Adelaide. But, as I was saying about the horses, when they're\nsold of course the bills won't go on. And I suppose things will come\nright. I don't owe so very much.\"\n\n\"I've got something to tell you,\" she said.\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"You're to see my cousin to-day at two o'clock.\"\n\n\"The Duke?\"\n\n\"Yes,--the Duke; and he has got a proposition. I don't know that you\nneed sell your horses, as it seems to make you so very unhappy. You\nremember Madame Goesler?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. She was at Harrington.\"\n\n\"There's something about a legacy which I can't understand at all. It\nis ever so much money, and it did belong to the old Duke. They say\nit is to be mine,--or yours rather, if we should ever be married.\nAnd then you know, Gerard, perhaps, after all, you needn't go to\nBoulogne.\" So she took her revenge, and he had his as he pressed his\narm round her waist and kissed her among the ruins of the old Priory.\n\nPrecisely at two to the moment he had his interview with the Duke,\nand very disagreeable it was to both of them. The Duke was bound\nto explain that the magnificent present which was being made to\nhis cousin was a gift, not from him, but from Madame Goesler; and,\nthough he was intent on making this as plain as possible, he did\nnot like the task. \"The truth is, Mr. Maule, that Madame Goesler is\nunwilling, for reasons with which I need not trouble you, to take\nthe legacy which was left to her by my uncle. I think her reasons to\nbe insufficient, but it is a matter in which she must, of course,\njudge for herself. She has decided,--very much, I fear, at my wife's\ninstigation, which I must own I regret,--to give the money to one\nof our family, and has been pleased to say that my cousin Adelaide\nshall be the recipient of her bounty. I have nothing to do with it.\nI cannot stop her generosity if I would, nor can I say that my cousin\nought to refuse it. Adelaide will have the entire sum as her fortune,\nshort of the legacy duty, which, as you are probably aware, will be\nten per cent., as Madame Goesler was not related to my uncle. The\nmoney will, of course, be settled on my cousin and on her children.\nI believe that will be all I shall have to say, except that Lady\nGlencora,--the Duchess, I mean,--wishes that Adelaide should be\nmarried from our house. If this be so I shall, of course, hope to\nhave the honour of giving my cousin away.\" The Duke was by no means\na pompous man, and probably there was no man in England of so high\nrank who thought so little of his rank. But he was stiff and somewhat\nungainly, and the task which he was called upon to execute had been\nvery disagreeable to him. He bowed when he had finished his speech,\nand Gerard Maule felt himself bound to go, almost without expressing\nhis thanks.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Maule,\" said Madame Goesler, \"you literally must not\nsay a word to me about it. The money was not mine, and under no\ncircumstances would or could be mine. I have given nothing, and could\nnot have presumed to make such a present. The money, I take it, does\nundoubtedly belong to the present Duke, and, as he does not want it,\nit is very natural that it should go to his cousin. I trust that you\nmay both live to enjoy it long, but I cannot allow any thanks to be\ngiven to me by either of you.\"\n\nAfter that he tried the Duchess, who was somewhat more gracious. \"The\ntruth is, Mr. Maule, you are a very lucky man to find twenty thousand\npounds and more going begging about the country in that way.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, Duchess.\"\n\n\"And Adelaide is lucky, too, for I doubt whether either of you are\ngiven to any very penetrating economies. I am told that you like\nhunting.\"\n\n\"I have sent my horses to Tattersall's.\"\n\n\"There is enough now for a little hunting, I suppose, unless you\nhave a dozen children. And now you and Adelaide must settle when\nit's to be. I hate things to be delayed. People go on quarrelling\nand fancying this and that, and thinking that the world is full of\nromance and poetry. When they get married they know better.\"\n\n\"I hope the romance and poetry do not all vanish.\"\n\n\"Romance and poetry are for the most part lies, Mr. Maule, and are\nvery apt to bring people into difficulty. I have seen something of\nthem in my time, and I much prefer downright honest figures. Two and\ntwo make four; idleness is the root of all evil; love your neighbour\nlike yourself, and the rest of it. Pray remember that Adelaide is to\nbe married from here, and that we shall be very happy that you should\nmake every use you like of our house until then.\"\n\nWe may so far anticipate in our story as to say that Adelaide\nPalliser and Gerard Maule were married from Matching Priory at\nMatching Church early in that October, and that as far as the\ncoming winter was concerned, there certainly was no hunting for\nthe gentleman. They went to Naples instead of Boulogne, and there\nremained till the warm weather came in the following spring. Nor was\nthat peremptory sale at Tattersall's countermanded as regarded any of\nthe horses. What prices were realised the present writer has never\nbeen able to ascertain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nPHINEAS FINN'S SUCCESS.\n\n\nWhen Phineas Finn had been about a week at Matching, he received a\nletter, or rather a very short note, from the Prime Minister, asking\nhim to go up to London; and on the same day the Duke of Omnium\nspoke to him on the subject of the letter. \"You are going up to\nsee Mr. Gresham. Mr. Gresham has written to me, and I hope that we\nshall be able to congratulate ourselves in having your assistance\nnext Session.\" Phineas declared that he had no idea whatever of\nMr. Gresham's object in summoning him up to London. \"I have his\npermission to inform you that he wishes you to accept office.\"\nPhineas felt that he was becoming very red in the face, but he did\nnot attempt to make any reply on the spur of the moment. \"Mr. Gresham\nthinks it well that so much should be said to you before you see him,\nin order that you may turn the matter over in your own mind. He would\nhave written to you probably, making the offer at once, had it not\nbeen that there must be various changes, and that one man's place\nmust depend on another. You will go, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes; I shall go, certainly. I shall be in London this evening.\"\n\n\"I will take care that a carriage is ready for you. I do not presume\nto advise, Mr. Finn, but I hope that there need be no doubt as to\nyour joining us.\" Phineas was somewhat confounded, and did not know\nthe Duke well enough to give expression to his thoughts at the\nmoment. \"Of course you will return to us, Mr. Finn.\" Phineas said\nthat he would return and trespass on the Duke's hospitality for yet a\nfew days. He was quite resolved that something must be said to Madame\nGoesler before he left the roof under which she was living. In the\ncourse of the autumn she purposed, as she had told him, to go to\nVienna, and to remain there almost up to Christmas. Whatever there\nmight be to be said should be said at any rate before that.\n\nHe did speak a few words to her before his journey to London, but in\nthose words there was no allusion made to the great subject which\nmust be discussed between them. \"I am going up to London,\" he said.\n\n\"So the Duchess tells me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Gresham has sent for me,--meaning, I suppose, to offer me the\nplace which he would not give me while that poor man was alive.\"\n\n\"And you will accept it of course, Mr. Finn?\"\n\n\"I am not at all so sure of that.\"\n\n\"But you will. You must. You will hardly be so foolish as to let the\npeevish animosity of an ill-conditioned man prejudice your prospects\neven after his death.\"\n\n\"It will not be any remembrance of Mr. Bonteen that will induce me to\nrefuse.\"\n\n\"It will be the same thing;--rancour against Mr. Gresham because he\nhad allowed the other man's counsel to prevail with him. The action\nof no individual man should be to you of sufficient consequence to\nguide your conduct. If you accept office, you should not take it as a\nfavour conferred by the Prime Minister; nor if you refuse it, should\nyou do so from personal feelings in regard to him. If he selects you,\nhe is presumed to do so because he finds that your services will be\nvaluable to the country.\"\n\n\"He does so because he thinks that I should be safe to vote for him.\"\n\n\"That may be so, or not. You can't read his bosom quite\ndistinctly;--but you may read your own. If you go into office you\nbecome the servant of the country,--not his servant, and should\nassume his motive in selecting you to be the same as your own in\nsubmitting to the selection. Your foot must be on the ladder before\nyou can get to the top of it.\"\n\n\"The ladder is so crooked.\"\n\n\"Is it more crooked now than it was three years ago;--worse than it\nwas six months ago, when you and all your friends looked upon it as\ncertain that you would be employed? There is nothing, Mr. Finn, that\na man should fear so much as some twist in his convictions arising\nfrom a personal accident to himself. When we heard that the Devil\nin his sickness wanted to be a monk, we never thought that he would\nbecome a saint in glory. When a man who has been rejected by a lady\nexpresses a generally ill opinion of the sex, we are apt to ascribe\nhis opinions to disappointment rather than to judgment. A man\nfalls and breaks his leg at a fence, and cannot be induced to ride\nagain,--not because he thinks the amusement to be dangerous, but\nbecause he cannot keep his mind from dwelling on the hardship that\nhas befallen himself. In all such cases self-consciousness gets the\nbetter of the judgment.\"\n\n\"You think it will be so with me?\"\n\n\"I shall think so if you now refuse--because of the misfortune which\nbefell you--that which I know you were most desirous of possessing\nbefore that accident. To tell you the truth, Mr. Finn, I wish Mr.\nGresham had delayed his offer till the winter.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because by that time you will have recovered your health. Your mind\nnow is morbid, and out of tune.\"\n\n\"There was something to make it so, Madame Goesler.\"\n\n\"God knows there was; and the necessity which lay upon you of bearing\na bold front during those long and terrible weeks of course consumed\nyour strength. The wonder is that the fibres of your mind should\nhave retained any of their elasticity after such an ordeal. But as\nyou are so strong, it would be a pity that you should not be strong\naltogether. This thing that is now to be offered to you is what you\nhave always desired.\"\n\n\"A man may have always desired that which is worthless.\"\n\n\"You tried it once, and did not find it worthless. You found yourself\nable to do good work when you were in office. If I remember right,\nyou did not give it up then because it was irksome to you, or\ncontemptible, or, as you say, worthless; but from difference of\nopinion on some political question. You can always do that again.\"\n\n\"A man is not fit for office who is prone to do so.\"\n\n\"Then do not you be prone. It means success or failure in the\nprofession which you have chosen, and I shall greatly regret to see\nyou damage your chance of success by yielding to scruples which have\ncome upon you when you are hardly as yet yourself.\"\n\nShe had spoken to him very plainly, and he had found it to be\nimpossible to answer her, and yet she had hardly touched the motives\nby which he believed himself to be actuated. As he made his journey\nup to London he thought very much of her words. There had been\nnothing said between them about money. No allusion had been made to\nthe salary of the office which would be offered to him, or to the\nterrible shortness of his own means of living. He knew well enough\nhimself that he must take some final step in life, or very shortly\nreturn into absolute obscurity. This woman who had been so strongly\nadvising him to take a certain course as to his future life, was very\nrich;--and he had fully decided that he would sooner or later ask\nher to be his wife. He knew well that all her friends regarded their\nmarriage as certain. The Duchess had almost told him so in as many\nwords. Lady Chiltern, who was much more to him than the Duchess,\nhad assured him that if he should have a wife to bring with him to\nHarrington, the wife would be welcome. Of what other wife could Lady\nChiltern have thought? Laurence Fitzgibbon, when congratulated on\nhis own marriage, had returned counter congratulations. Mr. Low had\nsaid that it would of course come to pass. Even Mrs. Bunce had hinted\nat it, suggesting that she would lose her lodger and be a wretched\nwoman. All the world had heard of the journey to Prague, and all the\nworld expected the marriage. And he had come to love the woman with\nexcessive affection, day by day, ever since the renewal of their\nintimacy at Broughton Spinnies. His mind was quite made up;--but\nhe was by no means so sure of her mind as the rest of the world might\nbe. He knew of her, what nobody else in all the world knew,--except\nhimself. In that former period of his life, on which he now sometimes\nlooked back as though it had been passed in another world, this woman\nhad offered her hand and fortune to him. She had done so in the\nenthusiasm of her love, knowing his ambition and knowing his poverty,\nand believing that her wealth was necessary to the success of his\ncareer in life. He had refused the offer,--and they had parted\nwithout a word. Now they had come together again, and she was\ncertainly among the dearest of his friends. Had she not taken that\nwondrous journey to Prague in his behalf, and been the first among\nthose who had striven,--and had striven at last successfully,--to\nsave his neck from the halter? Dear to her! He knew well as he sat\nwith his eyes closed in the railway carriage that he must be dear to\nher! But might it not well be that she had resolved that friendship\nshould take the place of love? And was it not compatible with her\nnature,--with all human nature,--that in spite of her regard for him\nshe should choose to be revenged for the evil which had befallen her,\nwhen she offered her hand in vain? She must know by this time that he\nintended to throw himself at her feet; and would hardly have advised\nhim as she had done as to the necessity of following up that success\nwhich had hitherto been so essential to him, had she intended to\ngive him all that she had once offered him before. It might well be\nthat Lady Chiltern, and even the Duchess, should be mistaken. Marie\nGoesler was not a woman, he thought, to reveal the deeper purposes of\nher life to any such friend as the Duchess of Omnium.\n\nOf his own feelings in regard to the offer which was about to be made\nto him he had hardly succeeded in making her understand anything.\nThat a change had come upon himself was certain, but he did not\nat all believe that it had sprung from any weakness caused by his\nsufferings in regard to the murder. He rather believed that he\nhad become stronger than weaker from all that he had endured. He\nhad learned when he was younger,--some years back,--to regard\nthe political service of his country as a profession in which a\nman possessed of certain gifts might earn his bread with more\ngratification to himself than in any other. The work would be hard,\nand the emolument only intermittent; but the service would in\nitself be pleasant; and the rewards of that service,--should he be\nso successful as to obtain reward,--would be dearer to him than\nanything which could accrue to him from other labours. To sit in\nthe Cabinet for one Session would, he then thought, be more to him\nthan to preside over the Court of Queen's Bench as long as did Lord\nMansfield. But during the last few months a change had crept across\nhis dream,--which he recognized but could hardly analyse. He had\nseen a man whom he despised promoted, and the place to which the man\nhad been exalted had at once become contemptible in his eyes. And\nthere had been quarrels and jangling, and the speaking of evil words\nbetween men who should have been quiet and dignified. No doubt Madame\nGoesler was right in attributing the revulsion in his hopes to Mr.\nBonteen and Mr. Bonteen's enmity; but Phineas Finn himself did not\nknow that it was so.\n\nHe arrived in town in the evening, and his appointment with Mr.\nGresham was for the following morning. He breakfasted at his club,\nand there he received the following letter from Lady Laura Kennedy:--\n\n\n   Saulsby, 28th August, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR PHINEAS,\n\n   I have just received a letter from Barrington in which he\n   tells me that Mr. Gresham is going to offer you your old\n   place at the Colonies. He says that Lord Fawn has been so\n   upset by this affair of Lady Eustace's husband, that he\n   is obliged to resign and go abroad. [This was the first\n   intimation that Phineas had heard of the nature of the\n   office to be offered to him.--] But Barrington goes on to\n   say that he thinks you won't accept Mr. Gresham's offer,\n   and he asks me to write to you. Can this possibly be true?\n   Barrington writes most kindly,--with true friendship,--and\n   is most anxious for you to join. But he thinks that\n   you are angry with Mr. Gresham because he passed you\n   over before, and that you will not forgive him for\n   having yielded to Mr. Bonteen. I can hardly believe this\n   possible. Surely you will not allow the shade of that\n   unfortunate man to blight your prospects? And, after all,\n   of what matter to you is the friendship or enmity of Mr.\n   Gresham? You have to assert yourself, to make your own\n   way, to use your own opportunities, and to fight your own\n   battle without reference to the feelings of individuals.\n   Men act together in office constantly, and with constancy,\n   who are known to hate each other. When there are so many\n   to get what is going, and so little to be given, of course\n   there will be struggling and trampling. I have no doubt\n   that Lord Cantrip has made a point of this with Mr.\n   Gresham;--has in point of fact insisted upon it. If so,\n   you are lucky to have such an ally as Lord Cantrip. He and\n   Mr. Gresham are, as you know, sworn friends, and if you\n   get on well with the one you certainly may with the other\n   also. Pray do not refuse without asking for time to think\n   about it;--and if so, pray come here, that you may consult\n   my father.\n\n   I spent two weary weeks at Loughlinter, and then could\n   stand it no longer. I have come here, and here I shall\n   remain for the autumn and winter. If I can sell my\n   interest in the Loughlinter property I shall do so, as I\n   am sure that neither the place nor the occupation is fit\n   for me. Indeed I know not what place or what occupation\n   will suit me! The dreariness of the life before me is\n   hardly preferable to the disappointments I have already\n   endured. There seems to be nothing left for me but to\n   watch my father to the end. The world would say that such\n   a duty in life is fit for a widowed childless daughter;\n   but to you I cannot pretend to say that my bereavements or\n   misfortunes reconcile me to such a fate. I cannot cease\n   to remember my age, my ambition, and I will say, my love.\n   I suppose that everything is over for me,--as though\n   I were an old woman, going down into the grave, but at\n   my time of life I find it hard to believe that it must\n   be so. And then the time of waiting may be so long! I\n   suppose I could start a house in London, and get people\n   around me by feeding and flattering them, and by little\n   intrigues,--like that woman of whom you are so fond. It\n   is money that is chiefly needed for that work, and of\n   money I have enough now. And people would know at any rate\n   who I am. But I could not flatter them, and I should wish\n   the food to choke them if they did not please me. And you\n   would not come, and if you did,--I may as well say it\n   boldly,--others would not. An ill-natured sprite has been\n   busy with me, which seems to deny me everything which is\n   so freely granted to others.\n\n   As for you, the world is at your feet. I dread two things\n   for you,--that you should marry unworthily, and that\n   you should injure your prospects in public life by an\n   uncompromising stiffness. On the former subject I can say\n   nothing to you. As to the latter, let me implore you to\n   come down here before you decide upon anything. Of course\n   you can at once accept Mr. Gresham's offer; and that is\n   what you should do unless the office proposed to you be\n   unworthy of you. No friend of yours will think that your\n   old place at the Colonies should be rejected. But if your\n   mind is still turned towards refusing, ask Mr. Gresham to\n   give you three or four days for decision, and then come\n   here. He cannot refuse you,--nor after all that is passed\n   can you refuse me.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   L. K.\n\n\nWhen he had read this letter he at once acknowledged to himself\nthat he could not refuse her request. He must go to Saulsby, and he\nmust do so at once. He was about to see Mr. Gresham immediately,\n--within half an hour; and as he could not expect at the most above\ntwenty-four hours to be allowed to him for consideration, he must\ngo down to Saulsby on the same evening. As he walked to the Prime\nMinister's house he called at a telegraph office and sent down his\nmessage. \"I will be at Saulsby by the train arriving at 7 P.M. Send\nto meet me.\" Then he went on, and in a few minutes found himself in\nthe presence of the great man.\n\nThe great man received him with an excellent courtesy. It is the\nspecial business of Prime Ministers to be civil in detail, though\nroughness, and perhaps almost rudeness in the gross, becomes not\nunfrequently a necessity of their position. To a proposed incoming\nsubordinate a Prime Minister is, of course, very civil, and to a\nretreating subordinate he is generally more so,--unless the retreat\nbe made under unfavourable circumstances. And to give good things\nis always pleasant, unless there be a suspicion that the good thing\nwill be thought to be not good enough. No such suspicion as that now\ncrossed the mind of Mr. Gresham. He had been pressed very much by\nvarious colleagues to admit this young man into the Paradise of his\ngovernment, and had been pressed very much also to exclude him; and\nthis had been continued till he had come to dislike the name of the\nyoung man. He did believe that the young man had behaved badly to Mr.\nRobert Kennedy, and he knew that the young man on one occasion had\ntaken to kicking in harness, and running a course of his own. He had\ndecided against the young man,--very much no doubt at the instance of\nMr. Bonteen,--and he believed that in so doing he closed the Gates of\nParadise against a Peri most anxious to enter it. He now stood with\nthe key in his hand and the gate open,--and the seat to be allotted\nto the re-accepted one was that which he believed the Peri would\nmost gratefully fill. He began by making a little speech about Mr.\nBonteen. That was almost unavoidable. And he praised in glowing words\nthe attitude which Phineas had maintained during the trial. He had\nbeen delighted with the re-election at Tankerville, and thought\nthat the borough had done itself much honour. Then came forth his\nproposition. Lord Fawn had retired, absolutely broken down by\nrepeated examinations respecting the man in the grey coat, and the\noffice which Phineas had before held with so much advantage to the\npublic, and comfort to his immediate chief, Lord Cantrip, was there\nfor his acceptance. Mr. Gresham went on to express an ardent hope\nthat he might have the benefit of Mr. Finn's services. It was quite\nmanifest from his manner that he did not in the least doubt the\nnature of the reply which he would receive.\n\nPhineas had come primed with his answer,--so ready with it that it\ndid not even seem to be the result of any hesitation at the moment.\n\"I hope, Mr. Gresham, that you will be able to give me a few hours to\nthink of this.\" Mr. Gresham's face fell, for, in truth, he wanted an\nimmediate answer; and though he knew from experience that Secretaries\nof State, and First Lords, and Chancellors, do demand time, and will\noften drive very hard bargains before they will consent to get into\nharness, he considered that Under-Secretaries, Junior Lords, and the\nlike, should skip about as they were bidden, and take the crumbs\noffered them without delay. If every underling wanted a few hours to\nthink about it, how could any Government ever be got together? \"I\nam sorry to put you to inconvenience,\" continued Phineas, seeing\nthat the great man was but ill-satisfied, \"but I am so placed that I\ncannot avail myself of your flattering kindness without some little\ntime for consideration.\"\n\n\"I had hoped that the office was one which you would like.\"\n\n\"So it is, Mr. Gresham.\"\n\n\"And I was told that you are now free from any scruples,--political\nscruples, I mean,--which might make it difficult for you to support\nthe Government.\"\n\n\"Since the Government came to our way of thinking,--a year or two\nago,--about Tenant Right, I mean,--I do not know that there is any\nsubject on which I am likely to oppose it. Perhaps I had better tell\nyou the truth, Mr. Gresham.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said the Prime Minister, who knew very well that\non such occasions nothing could be worse than the telling of\ndisagreeable truths.\n\n\"When you came into office, after beating Mr. Daubeny on the Church\nquestion, no man in Parliament was more desirous of place than\nI was,--and I am sure that none of the disappointed ones felt\ntheir disappointment so keenly. It was aggravated by various\ncircumstances,--by calumnies in newspapers, and by personal\nbickerings. I need not go into that wretched story of Mr. Bonteen,\nand the absurd accusation which grew out of those calumnies. These\nthings have changed me very much. I have a feeling that I have been\nill-used,--not by you, Mr. Gresham, specially, but by the party; and\nI look upon the whole question of office with altered eyes.\"\n\n\"In filling up the places at his disposal, a Prime Minister, Mr.\nFinn, has a most unenviable task.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it.\"\n\n\"When circumstances, rather than any selection of his own, indicate\nthe future occupant of any office, this abrogation of his patronage\nis the greatest blessing in the world to him.\"\n\n\"I can believe that also.\"\n\n\"I wish it were so with every office under the Crown. A Minister is\nrarely thanked, and would as much look for the peace of heaven in his\noffice as for gratitude.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I should have made no exception to such\nthanklessness.\"\n\n\"We shall neither of us get on by complaining;--shall we, Mr. Finn?\nYou can let me have an answer perhaps by this time to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If an answer by telegraph will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"Quite sufficient. Yes or No. Nothing more will be wanted. You\nunderstand your own reasons, no doubt, fully; but if they were stated\nat length they would perhaps hardly enlighten me. Good-morning.\" Then\nas Phineas was turning his back, the Prime Minister remembered that\nit behoved him as Prime Minister to repress his temper. \"I shall\nstill hope, Mr. Finn, for a favourable answer.\" Had it not been for\nthat last word Phineas would have turned again, and at once rejected\nthe proposition.\n\nFrom Mr. Gresham's house he went by appointment to Mr. Monk's, and\ntold him of the interview. Mr. Monk's advice to him had been exactly\nthe same as that given by Madame Goesler and Lady Laura. Phineas,\nindeed, understood perfectly that no friend could or would give him\nany other advice. \"He has his troubles, too,\" said Mr. Monk, speaking\nof the Prime Minister.\n\n\"A man can hardly expect to hold such an office without trouble.\"\n\n\"Labour of course there must be,--though I doubt whether it is\nso great as that of some other persons;--and responsibility. The\namount of trouble depends on the spirit and nature of the man.\nDo you remember old Lord Brock? He was never troubled. He had\na triple shield,--a thick skin, an equable temper, and perfect\nself-confidence. Mr. Mildmay was of a softer temper, and would have\nsuffered had he not been protected by the idolatry of a large class\nof his followers. Mr. Gresham has no such protection. With a finer\nintellect than either, and a sense of patriotism quite as keen, he\nhas a self-consciousness which makes him sore at every point. He\nknows the frailty of his temper, and yet cannot control it. And he\ndoes not understand men as did these others. Every word from an enemy\nis a wound to him. Every slight from a friend is a dagger in his\nside. But I can fancy that self-accusations make the cross on which\nhe is really crucified. He is a man to whom I would extend all my\nmercy, were it in my power to be merciful.\"\n\n\"You will hardly tell me that I should accept office under him by way\nof obliging him.\"\n\n\"Were I you I should do so,--not to oblige him, but because I know\nhim to be an honest man.\"\n\n\"I care but little for honesty,\" said Phineas, \"which is at the\ndisposal of those who are dishonest. What am I to think of a Minister\nwho could allow himself to be led by Mr. Bonteen?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\n\nTHE LAST VISIT TO SAULSBY.\n\n\nPhineas, as he journeyed down to Saulsby, knew that he had in truth\nmade up his mind. He was going thither nominally that he might\nlisten to the advice of almost his oldest political friend before he\nresolved on a matter of vital importance to himself; but in truth he\nwas making the visit because he felt that he could not excuse himself\nfrom it without unkindness and ingratitude. She had implored him to\ncome, and he was bound to go, and there were tidings to be told which\nhe must tell. It was not only that he might give her his reasons for\nnot becoming an Under-Secretary of State that he went to Saulsby.\nHe felt himself bound to inform her that he intended to ask Marie\nGoesler to be his wife. He might omit to do so till he had asked\nthe question,--and then say nothing of what he had done should\nhis petition be refused; but it seemed to him that there would be\ncowardice in this. He was bound to treat Lady Laura as his friend\nin a special degree, as something more than his sister,--and he was\nbound above all things to make her understand in some plainest manner\nthat she could be nothing more to him than such a friend. In his\ndealings with her he had endeavoured always to be honest,--gentle as\nwell as honest; but now it was specially his duty to be honest to\nher. When he was young he had loved her, and had told her so,--and\nshe had refused him. As a friend he had been true to her ever since,\nbut that offer could never be repeated. And the other offer,--to the\nwoman whom she was now accustomed to abuse,--must be made. Should\nLady Laura choose to quarrel with him it must be so; but the quarrel\nshould not be of his seeking.\n\nHe was quite sure that he would refuse Mr. Gresham's offer, although\nby doing so he would himself throw away the very thing which he had\ndevoted his life to acquire. In a foolish, soft moment,--as he now\nconfessed to himself,--he had endeavoured to obtain for his own\nposition the sympathy of the Minister. He had spoken of the calumnies\nwhich had hurt him, and of his sufferings when he found himself\nexcluded from place in consequence of the evil stories which had\nbeen told of him. Mr. Gresham had, in fact, declined to listen to\nhim;--had said Yes or No was all that he required, and had gone on to\nexplain that he would be unable to understand the reasons proposed to\nbe given even were he to hear them. Phineas had felt himself to be\nrepulsed, and would at once have shown his anger, had not the Prime\nMinister silenced him for the moment by a civilly-worded repetition\nof the offer made.\n\nBut the offer should certainly be declined. As he told himself that\nit must be so, he endeavoured to analyse the causes of this decision,\nbut was hardly successful. He had thought that he could explain the\nreasons to the Minister, but found himself incapable of explaining\nthem to himself. In regard to means of subsistence he was no better\noff now than when he began the world. He was, indeed, without\nincumbrance, but was also without any means of procuring an income.\nFor the last twelve months he had been living on his little capital,\nand two years more of such life would bring him to the end of all\nthat he had. There was, no doubt, one view of his prospects which was\nbright enough. If Marie Goesler accepted him, he need not, at any\nrate, look about for the means of earning a living. But he assured\nhimself with perfect confidence that no hope in that direction would\nhave any influence upon the answer he would give to Mr. Gresham. Had\nnot Marie Goesler herself been most urgent with him in begging him to\naccept the offer; and was he not therefore justified in concluding\nthat she at least had thought it necessary that he should earn his\nbread? Would her heart be softened towards him,--would any further\nsoftening be necessary,--by his obstinate refusal to comply with her\nadvice? The two things had no reference to each other,--and should be\nregarded by him as perfectly distinct. He would refuse Mr. Gresham's\noffer,--not because he hoped that he might live in idleness on the\nwealth of the woman he loved,--but because the chicaneries and\nintrigues of office had become distasteful to him. \"I don't know\nwhich are the falser,\" he said to himself, \"the mock courtesies or\nthe mock indignations of statesmen.\"\n\nHe found the Earl's carriage waiting for him at the station, and\nthought of many former days, as he was carried through the little\ntown for which he had sat in Parliament, up to the house which he\nhad once visited in the hope of wooing Violet Effingham. The women\nwhom he had loved had all, at any rate, become his friends, and his\nthorough friendships were almost all with women. He and Lord Chiltern\nregarded each other with warm affection; but there was hardly\nground for real sympathy between them. It was the same with Mr. Low\nand Barrington Erle. Were he to die there would be no gap in their\nlives;--were they to die there would be none in his. But with Violet\nEffingham,--as he still loved to call her to himself,--he thought it\nwould be different. When the carriage stopped at the hall door he was\nthinking of her rather than of Lady Laura Kennedy.\n\nHe was shown at once to his bedroom,--the very room in which he had\nwritten the letter to Lord Chiltern which had brought about the duel\nat Blankenberg. He was told that he would find Lady Laura in the\ndrawing-room waiting for dinner for him. The Earl had already dined.\n\n\"I am so glad you are come,\" said Lady Laura, welcoming him. \"Papa is\nnot very well and dined early, but I have waited for you, of course.\nOf course I have. You did not suppose I would let you sit down alone?\nI would not see you before you dressed because I knew that you must\nbe tired and hungry, and that the sooner you got down the better. Has\nit not been hot?\"\n\n\"And so dusty! I only left Matching yesterday, and seem to have been\non the railway ever since.\"\n\n\"Government officials have to take frequent journeys, Mr. Finn. How\nlong will it be before you have to go down to Scotland twice in one\nweek, and back as often to form a Ministry? Your next journey must be\ninto the dining-room;--in making which will you give me your arm?\"\n\nShe was, he thought, lighter in heart and pleasanter in manner than\nshe had been since her return from Dresden. When she had made her\nlittle joke about his future ministerial duties the servant had been\nin the room, and he had not, therefore, stopped her by a serious\nanswer. And now she was solicitous about his dinner,--anxious that\nhe should enjoy the good things set before him, as is the manner of\nloving women, pressing him to take wine, and playing the good hostess\nin all things. He smiled, and ate, and drank, and was gracious\nunder her petting; but he had a weight on his bosom, knowing, as\nhe did, that he must say that before long which would turn all\nher playfulness either to anger or to grief. \"And who had you at\nMatching?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just the usual set.\"\n\n\"Minus the poor old Duke?\"\n\n\"Yes; minus the old Duke certainly. The greatest change is in the\nname. Lady Glencora was so specially Lady Glencora that she ought to\nhave been Lady Glencora to the end. Everybody calls her Duchess, but\nit does not sound half so nice.\"\n\n\"And is he altered?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. You can trace the lines of lingering regret upon\nhis countenance when people be-Grace him; but that is all. There was\nalways about him a simple dignity which made it impossible that any\none should slap him on the back; and that of course remains. He is\nthe same Planty Pall; but I doubt whether any man ever ventured to\ncall him Planty Pall to his face since he left Eton.\"\n\n\"The house was full, I suppose?\"\n\n\"There were a great many there; among others Sir Gregory Grogram, who\napologised to me for having tried to--put an end to my career.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phineas!\"\n\n\"And Sir Harry Coldfoot, who seemed to take some credit to himself\nfor having allowed the jury to acquit me. And Chiltern and his wife\nwere there for a day or two.\"\n\n\"What could take Oswald there?\"\n\n\"An embassy of State about the foxes. The Duke's property runs into\nhis country. She is one of the best women that ever lived.\"\n\n\"Violet?\"\n\n\"And one of the best wives.\"\n\n\"She ought to be, for she is one of the happiest. What can she wish\nfor that she has not got? Was your great friend there?\"\n\nHe knew well what great friend she meant. \"Madame Max Goesler was\nthere.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I can never quite forgive Lady Glencora for her\nintimacy with that woman.\"\n\n\"Do not abuse her, Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"I do not intend,--not to you at any rate. But I can better\nunderstand that she should receive the admiration of a gentleman than\nthe affectionate friendship of a lady. That the old Duke should have\nbeen infatuated was intelligible.\"\n\n\"She was very good to the old Duke.\"\n\n\"But it was a kind of goodness which was hardly likely to recommend\nitself to his nephew's wife. Never mind; we won't talk about her now.\nBarrington was there?\"\n\n\"For a day or two.\"\n\n\"He seems to be wasting his life.\"\n\n\"Subordinates in office generally do, I think.\"\n\n\"Do not say that, Phineas.\"\n\n\"Some few push through, and one can almost always foretell who\nthe few will be. There are men who are destined always to occupy\nsecond-rate places, and who seem also to know their fate. I never\nheard Erle speak even of an ambition to sit in the Cabinet.\"\n\n\"He likes to be useful.\"\n\n\"All that part of the business which distresses me is pleasant\nto him. He is fond of arrangements, and delights in little party\nsuccesses. Either to effect or to avoid a count-out is a job of\nwork to his taste, and he loves to get the better of the Opposition\nby keeping it in the dark. A successful plot is as dear to him as\nto a writer of plays. And yet he is never bitter as is Ratler, or\nunscrupulous as was poor Mr. Bonteen, or full of wrath as is Lord\nFawn. Nor is he idle like Fitzgibbon. Erle always earns his salary.\"\n\n\"When I said he was wasting his life, I meant that he did not marry.\nBut perhaps a man in his position had better remain unmarried.\"\nPhineas tried to laugh, but hardly succeeded well. \"That, however, is\na delicate subject, and we will not touch it now. If you won't drink\nany wine we might as well go into the other room.\"\n\nNothing had as yet been said on either of the subjects which had\nbrought him to Saulsby, but there had been words which made the\nintroduction of them peculiarly unpleasant. His tidings, however,\nmust be told. \"I shall not see Lord Brentford to-night?\" he asked,\nwhen they were together in the drawing-room.\n\n\"If you wish it you can go up to him. He will not come down.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It is only because I must return to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, Phineas!\"\n\n\"I must do so. I have pledged myself to see Mr. Monk,--and others\nalso.\"\n\n\"It is a short visit to make to us on my first return home! I hardly\nexpected you at Loughlinter, but I thought that you might have\nremained a few nights under my father's roof.\" He could only reassert\nhis assurance that he was bound to be back in London, and explain as\nbest he might that he had come to Saulsby for a single night, only\nbecause he would not refuse her request to him. \"I will not trouble\nyou, Phineas, by complaints,\" she said.\n\n\"I would give you no cause for complaint if I could avoid it.\"\n\n\"And now tell me what has passed between you and Mr. Gresham,\" she\nsaid as soon as the servant had given them coffee. They were sitting\nby a window which opened down to the ground, and led on to the\nterrace and to the lawns below. The night was soft, and the air was\nheavy with the scent of many flowers. It was now past nine, and the\nsun had set; but there was a bright harvest moon, and the light,\nthough pale, was clear as that of day. \"Will you come and take a turn\nround the garden? We shall be better there than sitting here. I will\nget my hat; can I find yours for you?\" So they both strolled out,\ndown the terrace steps, and went forth, beyond the gardens, into the\npark, as though they had both intended from the first that it should\nbe so. \"I know you have not accepted Mr. Gresham's offer, or you\nwould have told me so.\"\n\n\"I have not accepted.\"\n\n\"Nor have you refused?\"\n\n\"No; it is still open. I must send my answer by telegram\nto-morrow--Yes or No,--Mr. Gresham's time is too precious to admit of\nmore.\"\n\n\"Phineas, for Heaven's sake do not allow little feelings to injure\nyou at such a time as this. It is of your own career, not of Mr.\nGresham's manners, that you should think.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to object to in Mr. Gresham. Yes or No will be quite\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"It must be Yes.\"\n\n\"It cannot be Yes, Lady Laura. That which I desired so ardently six\nmonths ago has now become so distasteful to me that I cannot accept\nit. There is an amount of hustling on the Treasury Bench which makes\na seat there almost ignominious.\"\n\n\"Do they hustle more than they did three years ago?\"\n\n\"I think they do, or if not it is more conspicuous to my eyes. I\ndo not say that it need be ignominious. To such a one as was Mr.\nPalliser it certainly is not so. But it becomes so when a man goes\nthere to get his bread, and has to fight his way as though for bare\nlife. When office first comes, unasked for, almost unexpected, full\nof the charms which distance lends, it is pleasant enough. The\nnew-comer begins to feel that he too is entitled to rub his shoulders\namong those who rule the world of Great Britain. But when it has been\nexpected, longed for as I longed for it, asked for by my friends\nand refused, when all the world comes to know that you are a suitor\nfor that which should come without any suit,--then the pleasantness\nvanishes.\"\n\n\"I thought it was to be your career.\"\n\n\"And I hoped so.\"\n\n\"What will you do, Phineas? You cannot live without an income.\"\n\n\"I must try,\" he said, laughing.\n\n\"You will not share with your friend, as a friend should?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Laura. That cannot be done.\"\n\n\"I do not see why it cannot. Then you might be independent.\"\n\n\"Then I should indeed be dependent.\"\n\n\"You are too proud to owe me anything.\"\n\nHe wanted to tell her that he was too proud to owe such obligation as\nshe had suggested to any man or any woman; but he hardly knew how to\ndo so, intending as he did to inform her before they returned to the\nhouse of his intention to ask Madame Goesler to be his wife. He could\ndiscern the difference between enjoying his wife's fortune and taking\ngifts of money from one who was bound to him by no tie;--but to her\nin her present mood he could explain no such distinction. On a sudden\nhe rushed at the matter in his mind. It had to be done, and must be\ndone before he brought her back to the house. He was conscious that\nhe had in no degree ill-used her. He had in nothing deceived her. He\nhad kept back from her nothing which the truest friendship had called\nupon him to reveal to her. And yet he knew that her indignation would\nrise hot within her at his first word. \"Laura,\" he said, forgetting\nin his confusion to remember her rank, \"I had better tell you at once\nthat I have determined to ask Madame Goesler to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, then;--of course your income is certain.\"\n\n\"If you choose to regard my conduct in that light I cannot help it. I\ndo not think that I deserve such reproach.\"\n\n\"Why not tell it all? You are engaged to her?\"\n\n\"Not so. I have not asked her yet.\"\n\n\"And why do you come to me with the story of your intentions,--to me\nof all persons in the world? I sometimes think that of all the hearts\nthat ever dwelt within a man's bosom yours is the hardest.\"\n\n\"For God's sake do not say that of me.\"\n\n\"Do you remember when you came to me about Violet,--to me,--to me? I\ncould bear it then because she was good and earnest, and a woman that\nI could love even though she robbed me. And I strove for you even\nagainst my own heart,--against my own brother. I did; I did. But how\nam I to bear it now? What shall I do now? She is a woman I loathe.\"\n\n\"Because you do not know her.\"\n\n\"Not know her! And are your eyes so clear at seeing that you must\nknow her better than others? She was the Duke's mistress.\"\n\n\"That is untrue, Lady Laura.\"\n\n\"But what difference does it make to me? I shall be sure that you\nwill have bread to eat, and horses to ride, and a seat in Parliament\nwithout being forced to earn it by your labour. We shall meet no\nmore, of course.\"\n\n\"I do not think that you can mean that.\"\n\n\"I will never receive that woman, nor will I cross the sill of her\ndoor. Why should I?\"\n\n\"Should she become my wife,--that I would have thought might have\nbeen the reason why.\"\n\n\"Surely, Phineas, no man ever understood a woman so ill as you do.\"\n\n\"Because I would fain hope that I need not quarrel with my oldest\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; because you think you can do this without quarrelling. How\nshould I speak to her of you; how listen to what she would tell me?\nPhineas, you have killed me at last.\" Why could he not tell her that\nit was she who had done the wrong when she gave her hand to Robert\nKennedy? But he could not tell her, and he was dumb. \"And so it's\nsettled!\"\n\n\"No; not settled.\"\n\n\"Psha! I hate your mock modesty! It is settled. You have become far\ntoo cautious to risk fortune in such an adventure. Practice has\ntaught you to be perfect. It was to tell me this that you came down\nhere.\"\n\n\"Partly so.\"\n\n\"It would have been more generous of you, sir, to have remained\naway.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to be ungenerous.\"\n\nThen she suddenly turned upon him, throwing her arms round his neck,\nand burying her face upon his bosom. They were at the moment in the\ncentre of the park, on the grass beneath the trees, and the moon was\nbright over their heads. He held her to his breast while she sobbed,\nand then relaxed his hold as she raised herself to look into his\nface. After a moment she took his hat from his head with one hand,\nand with the other swept the hair back from his brow. \"Oh, Phineas,\"\nshe said, \"Oh, my darling! My idol that I have worshipped when I\nshould have worshipped my God!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Then she suddenly turned upon him, throwing\nher arms round his neck.]\n\n\nAfter that they roamed for nearly an hour backwards and forwards\nbeneath the trees, till at last she became calm and almost\nreasonable. She acknowledged that she had long expected such a\nmarriage, looking forward to it as a great sorrow. She repeated\nover and over again her assertion that she could not \"know\" Madame\nGoesler as the wife of Phineas, but abstained from further evil words\nrespecting the lady. \"It is better that we should be apart,\" she said\nat last. \"I feel that it is better. When we are both old, if I should\nlive, we may meet again. I knew that it was coming, and we had better\npart.\" And yet they remained out there, wandering about the park for\na long portion of the summer night. She did not reproach him again,\nnor did she speak much of the future; but she alluded to all the\nincidents of their past life, showing him that nothing which he had\ndone, no words which he had spoken, had been forgotten by her. \"Of\ncourse it has been my fault,\" she said, as at last she parted with\nhim in the drawing-room. \"When I was younger I did not understand\nhow strong the heart can be. I should have known it, and I pay\nfor my ignorance with the penalty of my whole life.\" Then he left\nher, kissing her on both cheeks and on her brow, and went to his\nbedroom with the understanding that he would start for London on the\nfollowing morning before she was up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\n\nAT LAST--AT LAST.\n\n\nAs he took his ticket Phineas sent his message to the Prime Minister,\ntaking that personage literally at his word. The message was, No.\nWhen writing it in the office it seemed to him to be uncourteous, but\nhe found it difficult to add any other words that should make it less\nso. He supplemented it with a letter on his arrival in London, in\nwhich he expressed his regret that certain circumstances of his life\nwhich had occurred during the last month or two made him unfit to\nundertake the duties of the very pleasant office to which Mr. Gresham\nhad kindly offered to appoint him. That done, he remained in town\nbut one night, and then set his face again towards Matching. When\nhe reached that place it was already known that he had refused to\naccept Mr. Gresham's offer, and he was met at once with regrets and\ncondolements. \"I am sorry that it must be so,\" said the Duke,--who\nwas sorry, for he liked the man, but who said not a word more\nupon the subject. \"You are still young, and will have further\nopportunities,\" said Lord Cantrip, \"but I wish that you could have\nconsented to come back to your old chair.\" \"I hope that at any\nrate we shall not have you against us,\" said Sir Harry Coldfoot.\nAmong themselves they declared one to another that he had been so\ncompletely upset by his imprisonment and subsequent trial as to be\nunable to undertake the work proposed to him. \"It is not a very nice\nthing, you know, to be accused of murder,\" said Sir Gregory, \"and to\npass a month or two under the full conviction that you are going to\nbe hung. He'll come right again some day. I only hope it may not be\ntoo late.\"\n\n\"So you have decided for freedom?\" said Madame Goesler to him that\nevening,--the evening of the day on which he had returned.\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say against your decision now. No doubt your\nfeelings have prompted you right.\"\n\n\"Now that it is done, of course I am full of regrets,\" said Phineas.\n\n\"That is simple human nature, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Simple enough; and the worst of it is that I cannot quite explain\neven to myself why I have done it. Every friend I had in the world\ntold me that I was wrong, and yet I could not help myself. The thing\nwas offered to me, not because I was thought to be fit for it, but\nbecause I had become wonderful by being brought near to a violent\ndeath! I remember once, when I was a child, having a rocking-horse\ngiven to me because I had fallen from the top of the house to the\nbottom without breaking my neck. The rocking-horse was very well\nthen, but I don't care now to have one bestowed upon me for any such\nreason.\"\n\n\"Still, if the rocking-horse is in itself a good rocking-horse--\"\n\n\"But it isn't.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to say a word against your decision.\"\n\n\"It isn't good. It is one of those toys which look to be so very\ndesirable in the shop-windows, but which give no satisfaction when\nthey are brought home. I'll tell you what occurred the other day. The\ncircumstances happen to be known to me, though I cannot tell you my\nauthority. My dear old friend Laurence Fitzgibbon, in the performance\nof his official duties, had to give an opinion on a matter affecting\nan expenditure of some thirty or forty thousand pounds of public\nmoney. I don't think that Laurence has generally a very strong bias\nthis way or that on such questions, but in the case in question he\ntook upon himself to be very decided. He wrote, or got some one to\nwrite, a report proving that the service of the country imperatively\ndemanded that the money should be spent, and in doing so was strictly\nwithin his duty.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that he can be so energetic.\"\n\n\"The Chancellor of the Exchequer got hold of the matter, and told\nFitzgibbon that the thing couldn't be done.\"\n\n\"That was all right and constitutional, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Quite right and constitutional. But something had to be said about\nit in the House, and Laurence, with all his usual fluency and\nbeautiful Irish brogue, got up and explained that the money would be\nabsolutely thrown away if expended on a purpose so futile as that\nproposed. I am assured that the great capacity which he has thus\nshown for official work and official life will cover a multitude of\nsins.\"\n\n\"You would hardly have taken Mr. Fitzgibbon as your model statesman.\"\n\n\"Certainly not;--and if the story affected him only it would hardly\nbe worth telling. But the point of it lies in this;--that he\ndisgusted no one by what he did. The Chancellor of the Exchequer\nthinks him a very convenient man to have about him, and Mr. Gresham\nfeels the comfort of possessing tools so pliable.\"\n\n\"Do you think that public life then is altogether a mistake, Mr.\nFinn?\"\n\n\"For a poor man I think that it is, in this country. A man of fortune\nmay be independent; and because he has the power of independence\nthose who are higher than he will not expect him to be subservient.\nA man who takes to parliamentary office for a living may live by it,\nbut he will have but a dog's life of it.\"\n\n\"If I were you, Mr. Finn, I certainly would not choose a dog's life.\"\n\nHe said not a word to her on that occasion about herself, having\nmade up his mind that a certain period of the following day should\nbe chosen for the purpose, and he had hardly yet arranged in his\nmind what words he would use on that occasion. It seemed to him that\nthere would be so much to be said that he must settle beforehand some\norder of saying it. It was not as though he had merely to tell her of\nhis love. There had been talk of love between them before, on which\noccasion he had been compelled to tell her that he could not accept\nthat which she offered to him. It would be impossible, he knew, not\nto refer to that former conversation. And then he had to tell her\nthat he, now coming to her as a suitor and knowing her to be a very\nrich woman, was himself all but penniless. He was sure, or almost\nsure, that she was as well aware of this fact as he was himself; but,\nnevertheless, it was necessary that he should tell her of it,--and if\npossible so tell her as to force her to believe him when he assured\nher that he asked her to be his wife, not because she was rich, but\nbecause he loved her. It was impossible that all this should be said\nas they sat side by side in the drawing-room with a crowd of people\nalmost within hearing, and Madame Goesler had just been called upon\nto play, which she always did directly she was asked. He was invited\nto make up a rubber, but he could not bring himself to care for cards\nat the present moment. So he sat apart and listened to the music.\n\nIf all things went right with him to-morrow that music,--or the\nmusician who made it,--would be his own for the rest of his life. Was\nhe justified in expecting that she would give him so much? Of her\ngreat regard for him as a friend he had no doubt. She had shown it in\nvarious ways, and after a fashion that had made it known to all the\nworld. But so had Lady Laura regarded him when he first told her of\nhis love at Loughlinter. She had been his dearest friend, but she had\ndeclined to become his wife; and it had been partly so with Violet\nEffingham, whose friendship to him had been so sweet as to make him\nfor a while almost think that there was more than friendship. Marie\nGoesler had certainly once loved him;--but so had he once loved Laura\nStandish. He had been wretched for a while because Lady Laura had\nrefused him. His feelings now were altogether changed, and why should\nnot the feelings of Madame Goesler have undergone a similar change?\nThere was no doubt of her friendship; but then neither was there any\ndoubt of his for Lady Laura. And in spite of her friendship, would\nnot revenge be dear to her,--revenge of that nature which a slighted\nwoman must always desire? He had rejected her, and would it not be\nfair also that he should be rejected? \"I suppose you'll be in your\nown room before lunch to-morrow,\" he said to her as they separated\nfor the night. It had come to pass from the constancy of her visits\nto Matching in the old Duke's time, that a certain small morning-room\nhad been devoted to her, and this was still supposed to be her\nproperty,--so that she was not driven to herd with the public or to\nremain in her bedroom during all the hours of the morning. \"Yes,\" she\nsaid; \"I shall go out immediately after breakfast, but I shall soon\nbe driven in by the heat, and then I shall be there till lunch. The\nDuchess always comes about half-past twelve, to complain generally of\nthe guests.\" She answered him quite at her ease, making arrangement\nfor privacy if he should desire it, but doing so as though she\nthought that he wanted to talk to her about his trial, or about\npolitics, or the place he had just refused. Surely she would hardly\nhave answered him after such a fashion had she suspected that he\nintended to ask her to be his wife.\n\nAt a little before noon the next morning he knocked at her door, and\nwas told to enter. \"I didn't go out after all,\" she said. \"I hadn't\ncourage to face the sun.\"\n\n\"I saw that you were not in the garden.\"\n\n\"If I could have found you I would have told you that I should be\nhere all the morning. I might have sent you a message, only--only\nI didn't.\"\n\n\"I have come--\"\n\n\"I know why you have come.\"\n\n\"I doubt that. I have come to tell you that I love you.\"\n\n\"Oh Phineas;--at last, at last!\" And in a moment she was in his arms.\n\nIt seemed to him that from that moment all the explanations, and all\nthe statements, and most of the assurances were made by her and not\nby him. After this first embrace he found himself seated beside her,\nholding her hand. \"I do not know that I am right,\" said he.\n\n\"Why not right?\"\n\n\"Because you are rich and I have nothing.\"\n\n\"If you ever remind me of that again I will strike you,\" she said,\nraising up her little fist and bringing it down with gentle pressure\non his shoulder. \"Between you and me there must be nothing more about\nthat. It must be an even partnership. There must be ever so much\nabout money, and you'll have to go into dreadful details, and make\njourneys to Vienna to see that the houses don't tumble down;--but\nthere must be no question between you and me of whence it came.\"\n\n\"You will not think that I have to come to you for that?\"\n\n\"Have you ever known me to have a low opinion of myself? Is it\nprobable that I shall account myself to be personally so mean and of\nso little value as to imagine that you cannot love me? I know you\nlove me. But Phineas, I have not been sure till very lately that you\nwould ever tell me so. As for me--! Oh, heavens! when I think of it.\"\n\n\"Tell me that you love me now.\"\n\n\"I think I have said so plainly enough. I have never ceased to love\nyou since I first knew you well enough for love. And I'll tell you\nmore,--though perhaps I shall say what you will think condemns\nme;--you are the only man I ever loved. My husband was very good\nto me,--and I was, I think, good to him. But he was many years my\nsenior, and I cannot say I loved him,--as I do you.\" Then she turned\nto him, and put her head on his shoulder. \"And I loved the old Duke,\ntoo, after a fashion. But it was a different thing from this. I will\ntell you something about him some day that I have never yet told to a\nhuman being.\"\n\n\"Tell me now.\"\n\n\"No; not till I am your wife. You must trust me. But I will tell\nyou,\" she said, \"lest you should be miserable. He asked me to be his\nwife.\"\n\n\"The old Duke?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and I refused to be a--duchess. Lady Glencora knew it\nall, and, just at the time I was breaking my heart,--like a fool, for\nyou! Yes, for you! But I got over it, and am not broken-hearted a\nbit. Oh, Phineas, I am so happy now.\"\n\nExactly at the time she had mentioned on the previous evening, at\nhalf-past twelve, the door was opened, and the Duchess entered the\nroom. \"Oh dear,\" she exclaimed, \"perhaps I am in the way; perhaps I\nam interrupting secrets.\"\n\n\"No, Duchess.\"\n\n\"Shall I retire? I will at once if there be anything confidential\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"It has gone on already, and been completed,\" said Madame Goesler\nrising from her seat. \"It is only a trifle. Mr. Finn has asked me to\nbe his wife.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I couldn't refuse Mr. Finn a little thing like that.\"\n\n\"I should think not, after going all the way to Prague to find a\nlatch-key! I congratulate you, Mr. Finn, with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Duchess.\"\n\n\"And when is it to be?\"\n\n\"We have not thought about that yet, Mr. Finn,--have we?\" said Madame\nGoesler.\n\n\"Adelaide Palliser is going to be married from here some time in the\nautumn,\" said the Duchess, \"and you two had better take advantage of\nthe occasion.\" This plan, however, was considered as being too rapid\nand rash. Marriage is a very serious affair, and many things would\nrequire arrangement. A lady with the wealth which belonged to Madame\nGoesler cannot bestow herself off-hand as may a curate's daughter,\nlet her be ever so willing to give her money as well as herself. It\nwas impossible that a day should be fixed quite at once; but the\nDuchess was allowed to understand that the affair might be mentioned.\nBefore dinner on that day every one of the guests at Matching Priory\nknew that the man who had refused to be made Under-Secretary of State\nhad been accepted by that possessor of fabulous wealth who was well\nknown to the world as Madame Goesler of Park Lane. \"I am very glad\nthat you did not take office under Mr. Gresham,\" she said to him when\nthey first met each other again in London. \"Of course when I was\nadvising you I could not be sure that this would happen. Now you can\nbide your time, and if the opportunity offers you can go to work\nunder better auspices.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nThere remains to us the very easy task of collecting together the\nends of the thread of our narrative, and tying them into a simple\nknot, so that there may be no unravelling. Of Mr. Emilius it has been\nalready said that his good fortune clung to him so far that it was\nfound impossible to connect him with the tragedy of Bolton Row. But\nhe was made to vanish for a certain number of years from the world,\nand dear little Lizzie Eustace was left a free woman. When last we\nheard of her she was at Naples, and there was then a rumour that\nshe was about to join her fate to that of Lord George de Bruce\nCarruthers, with whom pecuniary matters had lately not been going\ncomfortably. Let us hope that the match, should it be a match, may\nlead to the happiness and respectability of both of them.\n\nAs all the world knows, Lord and Lady Chiltern still live at\nHarrington Hall, and he has been considered to do very well with\nthe Brake country. He still grumbles about Trumpeton Wood, and says\nthat it will take a lifetime to repair the injuries done by Mr.\nFothergill;--but then who ever knew a Master of Hounds who wasn't\nill-treated by the owners of coverts?\n\nOf Mr. Tom Spooner it can only be said that he is still a bachelor,\nliving with his cousin Ned, and that none of the neighbours expect\nto see a lady at Spoon Hall. In one winter, after the period of his\nmisfortune, he became slack about his hunting, and there were rumours\nthat he was carrying out that terrible threat of his as to the\ncrusade which he would go to find a cure for his love. But his cousin\ntook him in hand somewhat sharply, made him travel abroad during the\nsummer, and brought him out the next season, \"as fresh as paint,\"\nas the members of the Brake Hunt declared. It was known to every\nsportsman in the country that poor Mr. Spooner had been in love; but\nthe affair was allowed to be a mystery, and no one ever spoke to\nSpooner himself upon the subject. It is probable that he now reaps no\nslight amount of gratification from his memory of the romance.\n\nThe marriage between Gerard Maule and Adelaide Palliser was\ncelebrated with great glory at Matching, and was mentioned in all the\nleading papers as an alliance in high life. When it became known to\nMr. Maule, Senior, that this would be so, and that the lady would\nhave a very considerable fortune from the old Duke, he reconciled\nhimself to the marriage altogether, and at once gave way in that\nmatter of Maule Abbey. Nothing he thought would be more suitable than\nthat the young people should live at the old family place. So Maule\nAbbey was fitted up, and Mr. and Mrs. Maule have taken up their\nresidence there. Under the influence of his wife he has promised to\nattend to his farming, and proposes to do no more than go out and see\nthe hounds when they come into his neighbourhood. Let us hope that he\nmay prosper. Should the farming come to a good end more will probably\nhave been due to his wife's enterprise than to his own. The energetic\nfather is, as all the world knows, now in pursuit of a widow with\nthree thousand a year who has lately come out in Cavendish Square.\n\nOf poor Lord Fawn no good account can be given. To his thinking,\nofficial life had none of those drawbacks with which the fantastic\nfeelings of Phineas Finn had invested it. He could have been happy\nfor ever at the India Board or at the Colonial Office;--but his life\nwas made a burden to him by the affair of the Bonteen murder. He was\ncharged with having nearly led to the fatal catastrophe of Phineas\nFinn's condemnation by his erroneous evidence, and he could not bear\nthe accusation. Then came the further affair of Mr. Emilius, and his\nmind gave way;--and he disappeared. Let us hope that he may return\nsome day with renewed health, and again be of service to his country.\n\nPoetical justice reached Mr. Quintus Slide of The People's Banner.\nThe acquittal and following glories of Phineas Finn were gall and\nwormwood to him; and he continued his attack upon the member for\nTankerville even after it was known that he had refused office, and\nwas about to be married to Madame Goesler. In these attacks he made\nallusions to Lady Laura which brought Lord Chiltern down upon him,\nand there was an action for libel. The paper had to pay damages and\ncosts, and the proprietors resolved that Mr. Quintus Slide was too\nenergetic for their purposes. He is now earning his bread in some\nhumble capacity on the staff of The Ballot Box,--which is supposed\nto be the most democratic daily newspaper published in London. Mr.\nSlide has, however, expressed his intention of seeking his fortune in\nNew York.\n\nLaurence Fitzgibbon certainly did himself a good turn by his obliging\ndeference to the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has\nbeen in office ever since. It must be acknowledged of all our leading\nstatesmen that gratitude for such services is their characteristic.\nIt is said that he spends much of his eloquence in endeavouring to\nmake his wife believe that the air of County Mayo is the sweetest in\nthe world. Hitherto, since his marriage, this eloquence has been\nthrown away, for she has always been his companion through the\nSession in London.\n\nIt is rumoured that Barrington Erle is to be made Secretary for\nIreland, but his friends doubt whether the office will suit him.\n\nThe marriage between Marie Goesler and our hero did not take place\ntill October, and then they went abroad for the greater part of the\nwinter, Phineas having received leave of absence officially from\nthe Speaker and unofficially from his constituents. After all that\nhe had gone through it was acknowledged that so much ease should\nbe permitted to him. They went first to Vienna, and then back into\nItaly, and were unheard of by their English friends for nearly six\nmonths. In April they reappeared in London, and the house in Park\nLane was opened with great _\u00c3\u00a9clat_. Of Phineas every one says that\nof all living men he has been the most fortunate. The present writer\nwill not think so unless he shall soon turn his hand to some useful\ntask. Those who know him best say that he will of course go into\noffice before long.\n\nOf poor Lady Laura hardly a word need be said. She lives at Saulsby\nthe life of a recluse, and the old Earl her father is still alive.\n\nThe Duke, as all the world knows, is on the very eve of success with\nthe decimal coinage. But his hair is becoming grey, and his back is\nbecoming bent; and men say that he will never live as long as his\nuncle. But then he will have done a great thing,--and his uncle did\nonly little things. Of the Duchess no word need be said. Nothing will\never change the Duchess.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHINEAS REDUX***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 18640-8.txt or 18640-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/8\/6\/4\/18640\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":762,"split":"train"}
