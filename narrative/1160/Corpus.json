{"ori_id":"23672f8565f6fe83d031412530cd00ed1d2d8745","title":"Color of Night","context":"Color of Night\n Dr. Bill Capa (Willis), a New York City psychologist, falls into a deep depression after an unstable patient commits suicide in front of him by jumping from his office window. The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red.\nTo restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. But one night Moore is violently murdered in the office and Capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death.\nMoore would gather his patients every Monday for a discussion of their problems. Police detective Lt. Hector Martinez (Blades) considers them, and possibly Capa, suspects in the murder. Capa continues to live in Moore's house and begins an affair with Rose (March), a mysterious girl who comes and goes. He takes over Moore's therapy group and learns of their pasts and obsessions:\nClark (Brad Dourif) suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things. He also has a violent temper, and months earlier beat up his wife.\nSondra (Lesley Ann Warren) is a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac. She stabbed her father with a knife and fork and her husband died of unnatural causes.\nBuck (Lance Henriksen) is a suicidal ex-cop. The murder of his wife and daughter remains unsolved.\nCasey (Kevin J. O'Connor), the arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art. He once burned down his father's house.\nRichie is a transgender 16-year-old who wishes to transition to female. Richie also has social anxiety disorder, a stutter and a history of drug use.\nOne of these patients is violently murdered. Capa also becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose.\nThis leads to a twist ending: \"Richie\" is really Rose, and the murders have been committed by her deranged brother Dale (Andrew Lowery). They once had an actual brother named Richie who was molested by a child psychiatrist named Niedelmeyer. Richie committed suicide and, unable to cope with the loss, Dale forced Rose to play the part of their brother. Dale \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who was also one of Niedelmeyer's victims \u00e2\u0080\u0094 began abusing Rose until she actually became \"Richie\". When \"Richie\" was arrested for drug possession, \"he\" was forced into therapy. Rose soon started to re-emerge and, under another personality, \"Bonnie\", started relationships with other members of the group. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to \"Richie\".\nCapa confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Capa is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one at the beginning, resulting in Capa's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.\n<html>\n<head><title>Color of Night Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Color of Night script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Color of Night script, Color of Night movie script, Color of Night film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

       box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see\n          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the\n          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and\n          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.\n           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various\n          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.\n           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not\n          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which\n          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her\n          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away\n          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.\n                         \n<b>                          MICHELLE\n<\/b>           God !......

She\n          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her\n          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in\n          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.\n           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put\n          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the\n          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to\n          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while\n          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.\n                         \n<b>          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>                         \n          Large planes of ground glass.

During Bill's message, the tracking shot\n          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head\n          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to\n          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting\n          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman\n          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another\n          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of\n          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a\n          weightlifting bench.

His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly\n          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when\n          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back\n          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled\n          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,\n          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its\n          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated\n          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in\n          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.\n           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked\n          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely\n          avoid driving on Bill.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n<\/b>          Yelling to the driver.\n           Hey !\n                         \n          The car honks.

Hey !... Help !... Shit !\n          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He\n          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.\n           Fuck !\n          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.\n           Hello !\n          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall\n          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the\n          road.\n           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck\n           with me !\n          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks\n          at the envelopes.\n           Fuckin' bill. Great.\n                         \n          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the\n          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter\n          the house. A car stops and honks.

In spite of the very dangerous\n          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on\n          following him.\n           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and\n          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the\n          pavement.\n           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere.

Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her\n          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump\n          again into each other and arrive into a main road.\n           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on\n          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The\n          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on\n          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.\n          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and\n          causes a pile-up on the road.\n           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a\n          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.\n          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then\n          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and\n          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the\n          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.\n           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?\n          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and\n          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.\n           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car\n          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.\n           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.\n          We see the train moving behind him.\n                         \n<b>          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>                         \n          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular.

Bill, wearing\n          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,\n          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is\n          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read\n          \u00abNate Starkman & Son\u00bb on the front of the building.\n           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom\n          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above\n          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of\n          the building.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n<\/b>          He yells.\n           Casey !\n<b>          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>                         \n          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench.

He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He\n          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of\n          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches\n          the ladder, which he brings down.\n                         \n<b>          CASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>                         \n          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort\n          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern\n          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a\n          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,\n          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of\n          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along\n          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n<\/b>           Oh, Jesus Christ.\n          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open.

He takes\n          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He\n          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.\n           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are\n          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put\n          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and\n          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.\n           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,\n          flooding the room with bright light.\n           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings\n          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair\n          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the\n          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought\n          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from\n          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a\n          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.\n           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on\n          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this\n          slimy liquid.\n           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable\n          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the\n          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead\n          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is\n          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's\n          blood.\n                         \n<b>                          BILL\n<\/b>           Ow ! Ow ! Ow !
