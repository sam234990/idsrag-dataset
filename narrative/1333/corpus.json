{"ori_id":"a9a03a147849d65e6bcaf3cc74c3dd93d0ef88d4","title":"The Cask of Amontillado","context":"The Cask of Amontillado\n The story's narrator, Montresor, tells the story of the day that he took his revenge on Fortunato (Italian for \"the fortunate one\"), a fellow nobleman, to an unspecified person who knows him very well. Angry over numerous injuries and some unspecified insult, he plots to murder his friend during Carnival when the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley.\nMontresor lures Fortunato into a private wine-tasting excursion by telling him he has obtained a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of what he believes to be a rare vintage of amontillado. He mentions obtaining confirmation of the pipe's contents by inviting a fellow wine aficionado, Luchesi, for a private tasting. Montresor knows Fortunato will not be able to resist demonstrating his discerning palate for wine and will insist that he taste the amontillado rather than Luchesi who, as he claims, \"cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry\". Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato in order to keep him inebriated. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the damp, and suggests they go back; Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that \"[he] shall not die of a cough.\" During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (\"No one attacks me with impunity\").\nAt one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, \"You are not of the masons?\" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the amontillado is within. Fortunato enters drunk and unsuspecting and therefore, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, Montresor must \"positively leave\" him there.\nMontresor reveals brick and mortar, previously hidden among the bones nearby, and walls up the niche, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated he would, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As the murderer finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, \"For the love of God, Montresor!\" to which Montresor replies, \"Yes, for the love of God!\" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs.\nIn the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that 50 years later, Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: In pace requiescat! (\"May he rest in peace!\").\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cask of Amontillado, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cask of Amontillado\n\n\nby\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\n\n\nThe thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but\nwhen he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who so well know\nthe nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance\nto a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitely\nsettled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,\nprecluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but punish with\nimpunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its\nredresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make\nhimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\n\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given\nFortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, to\nsmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at\nthe thought of his immolation.\n\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a\nman to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on his\nconnoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\nFor the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\nopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian\n_millionaires_.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,\nwas a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.  In this\nrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the\nItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\n\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\ncarnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me with\nexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore motley.\nHe had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was\nsurmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased to see him,\nthat I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\n\nI said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How remarkably\nwell you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe of what passes\nfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"How?\" said he.  \"Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the middle\nof the carnival!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full\nAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to\nbe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has a\ncritical turn, it is he.  He will tell me--\"\n\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\n\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your\nown.\"\n\n\"Come, let us go.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To your vaults.\"\n\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I perceive\nyou have an engagement.  Luchesi--\"\n\n\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\n\n\"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with\nwhich I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp.\nThey are encrusted with nitre.\"\n\n\"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado!\nYou have been imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish\nSherry from Amontillado.\"\n\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask\nof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I\nsuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\nhonour of the time.  I had told them that I should not return until the\nmorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\nThese orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\ndisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\nbowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\nthe vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him\nto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the\ndescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\nMontresors.\n\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled\nas he strode.\n\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\n\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which\ngleams from these cavern walls.\"\n\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\ndistilled the rheum of intoxication.\n\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\n\n\"Nitre,\" I replied.  \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!\nugh! ugh!\"\n\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is\nprecious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as\nonce I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  We\nwill go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides,\nthere is Luchesi--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me.\nI shall not die of a cough.\"\n\n\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\nyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of\nthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\n\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\nits fellows that lay upon the mould.\n\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\n\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to me\nfamiliarly, while his bells jingled.\n\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n\n\"And I to your long life.\"\n\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n\n\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n\n\"I forget your arms.\"\n\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\nrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\n\n\"And the motto?\"\n\n\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he said.\n\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy grew\nwarm with the Medoc.  We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\ncasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of\ncatacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize\nFortunato by an arm above the elbow.\n\n\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the\nvaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle\namong the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your\ncough--\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught of\nthe Medoc.\"\n\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a\nbreath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw\nthe bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n\nI looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\n\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\n\n\"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"\n\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\n\n\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\n\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\nmy _roquelaire_.\n\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceed\nto the Amontillado.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again\noffering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our\nroute in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of low\narches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep\ncrypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to\nglow than flame.\n\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\nspacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\nvault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three\nsides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.\nFrom the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay\npromiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some\nsize.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we\nperceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width\nthree, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for\nno especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between\ntwo of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was\nbacked by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to\npry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did\nnot enable us to see.\n\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"\n\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\nforward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant he\nhad reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress\narrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and I\nhad fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples,\ndistant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one of\nthese depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing the\nlinks about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure\nit.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key I\nstepped back from the recess.\n\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\nnitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you to\nreturn.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must first\nrender you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\nastonishment.\n\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which\nI have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity\nof building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid of\nmy trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered\nthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\nearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\nof the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\nlong and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and\nthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The\nnoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\nit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon\nthe bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\nand finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\ntier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again\npaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\nfeeble rays upon the figure within.\n\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\nthroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a\nbrief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began\nto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant\nreassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,\nand felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of\nhim who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume\nand in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\n\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had\ncompleted the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a\nportion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone\nto be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placed\nit partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out the\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was\nsucceeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that\nof the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest.\nWe shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he!\nhe!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n\n\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not getting\nlate?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato\nand the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n\n\"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient.\nI called aloud--\n\n\"Fortunato!\"\n\nNo answer.  I called again--\n\n\"Fortunato--\"\n\nNo answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and\nlet it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of the\nbells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.\nI hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone into\nits position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erected\nthe old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no mortal has\ndisturbed them.  _In pace requiescat!_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cask of Amontillado, by Edgar Allan Poe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1063.txt or 1063.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/6\/1063\/\n\nProduced by Levent Kurnaz.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1333,"split":"test"}
