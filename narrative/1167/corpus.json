However, nothing comes of his many attempts to find work, and he despairs. Friendship with a pickpocket known as \"The Lizard\" cheers him up and he reapplies himself, finally finding work in a department store. He also makes the acquaintance of a young lady of quality, one Elizabeth Compton. Torrance gains (and loses) a number of jobs in rapid succession, including ladies' hosiery clerk, waiter, boxer, and milkman, chancing to meet Elizabeth and her friend Harriet Holden in most of these occupations. During his stint as a waiter, he also wins the friendship of a prostitute with a heart of gold named Edith (Little Eva).\nElizabeth's father runs a factory and is worried that he is losing money. He advertises for an \"efficiency expert\" to come help him turn things around. Edith sees the ad and encourages Torrance to apply, writing him fraudulent letters of recommendation to assist him. Torrance does indeed get the job, where he immediately begins to improve things while simultaneously beginning to suspect that someone at the factory is stealing. Elizabeth's fianc\u00e9 Harold Bince, the factory's assistant manager\u00a0\u2013 who is himself the embezzler in question, due to large gambling debts\u00a0\u2013 tries to get Torrance fired, an effort in which Elizabeth herself eagerly assists.\nTorrance figures out the truth and has Mr. Compton engage an outside firm of accountants to prove his case, not wanting to deliver the bad news himself. In desperation, Bince tries to get rid of Torrance, leading up to a violent climax in which Elizabeth's father is murdered and Torrance is framed. The Lizard and Little Eva work to get him off, an effort that finally succeeds when The Lizard takes the stand and proves Torrance could not have committed the murder. Bince, who has persuaded Elizabeth to marry him, is exposed and commits suicide.

Drawing to a close were the nearly four years of his\ncollege career--profitable years, Jimmy considered them, and certainly\nsuccessful up to this point. In the beginning of his senior year he had\ncaptained the varsity eleven, and in the coming spring he would again\nsally forth upon the diamond as the star initial sacker of collegedom.\n\nHis football triumphs were in the past, his continued baseball successes\na foregone conclusion--if he won to-night his cup of happiness, and an\nunassailably dominant position among his fellows, would be assured,\nleaving nothing more, in so far as Jimmy reasoned, to be desired from\nfour years attendance at one of America's oldest and most famous\nuniversities.\n\nThe youth who would dispute the right to championship honors with Jimmy\nwas a dark horse to the extent that he was a freshman, and, therefore,\npractically unknown. He had worked hard, however, and given a good\naccount of himself in his preparations for the battle, and there were\nrumors, as there always are about every campus, of marvelous exploits\nprior to his college days. It was even darkly hinted that he was a\nprofessional pugilist. As a matter of fact, he was the best exponent of\nthe manly art of self-defense that Jimmy Torrance had ever faced, and in\naddition thereto he outweighed the senior and outreached him.\n\nThe boxing contest, as the faculty members of the athletic committee\npreferred to call it, was, from the tap of the gong, as pretty a\ntwo-fisted scrap as ever any aggregation of low-browed fight fans\nwitnessed. The details of this gory contest, while interesting, have no\nparticular bearing upon the development of this tale. What interests us\nis the outcome, which occurred in the middle of a very bloody fourth\nround, in which Jimmy Torrance scored a clean knock-out.\n\nIt was a battered but happy Jimmy who sat in his room the following\nMonday afternoon, striving to concentrate his mind upon a college\ntext-book which should, by all the laws of fiction, have been 'well\nthumbed,' but in reality, possessed unruffled freshness which belied its\nreal age.\n\n\"I wish,\" mused Jimmy, \"that I could have got to the bird who invented\nmathematics before he inflicted all this unnecessary anguish upon an\nalready unhappy world. In about three rounds I could have saved\nthousands from the sorrow which I feel every time I open this blooming\nbook.\"\n\nHe was still deeply engrossed in the futile attempt of accomplishing in\nan hour that for which the college curriculum set aside several months\nwhen there came sounds of approaching footsteps rapidly ascending the\nstairway. His door was unceremoniously thrown open, and there appeared\none of those strange apparitions which is the envy and despair of the\nsmall-town youth--a naturally good-looking young fellow, the sartorial\narts of whose tailor had elevated his waist-line to his arm-pits,\ndragged down his shoulders, and caved in his front until he had the\nappearance of being badly dished from chin to knees. His trousers\nappeared to have been made for a man with legs six inches longer than\nhis, while his hat was evidently several sizes too large, since it would\nhave entirely extinguished his face had it not been supported by his\nears.\n\n\"Hello, Kid!\" cried Jimmy.  \"What's new?\"\n\n\"Whiskers wants you,\" replied the other.  \"Faculty meeting. They just\ngot through with me.\"\n\n\"Hell!\" muttered Jimmy feelingly.  \"I don't know what Whiskers wants\nwith me, but he never wants to see anybody about anything pleasant.\"\n\n\"I am here,\" agreed the other, \"to announce to the universe that you are\nright, Jimmy. He didn't have anything pleasant to say to me. In fact, he\ninsinuated that dear old alma mater might be able to wiggle along\nwithout me if I didn't abjure my criminal life. Made some nasty\ncomparison between my academic achievements and foxtrotting. I wonder,\nJimmy, how they get that way?\"\n\n\"That's why they are profs,\" explained Jimmy.  \"There are two kinds of\npeople in this world--human beings and profs. When does he want me?\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\nJimmy arose and put on his hat and coat.  \"Good-by, Kid,\" he said.\n\"Pray for me, and leave me one cigarette to smoke when I get back,\"\nand, grinning, he left the room.\n\nJames Torrance, Jr., was not greatly abashed as he faced the dour\ntribunal of the faculty. The younger members, among whom were several he\nknew to be mighty good fellows at heart, sat at the lower end of the\nlong table, and with owlish gravity attempted to emulate the appearance\nand manners of their seniors. At the head of the table sat Whiskers, as\nthe dignified and venerable president of the university was popularly\nnamed. It was generally believed and solemnly sworn to throughout the\nlarge corps of undergraduates that within the knowledge of any living\nman Whiskers had never been known to smile, and to-day he was running\ntrue to form.\n\n\"Mr. Torrance,\" he said, sighing, \"it has been my painful duty on more\nthan one occasion to call your attention to the uniformly low average of\nyour academic standing. At the earnest solicitation of the faculty\nmembers of the athletic committee, I have been influenced, against my\nbetter judgment, to temporize with an utterly insufferable condition.\n\n\"You are rapidly approaching the close of your senior year, and in the\nlight of the records which I have before me I am constrained to believe\nthat it will be utterly impossible for you to graduate, unless from now\nto the end of the semester you devote yourself exclusively to your\nacademic work. If you cannot assure me that you will do this, I believe\nit would be to the best interests of the university for you to resign\nnow, rather than to fail of graduation. And in this decision I am fully\nseconded by the faculty members of the athletic committee, who realize\nthe harmful effect upon university athletics in the future were so\nprominent an athlete as you to fail at graduation.\"\n\nIf they had sentenced Jimmy to be shot at sunrise the blow could\nscarcely have been more stunning than that which followed the\nrealization that he was not to be permitted to round out his fourth\nsuccessful season at first base. But if Jimmy was momentarily stunned he\ngave no outward indication of the fact, and in the brief interval of\nsilence following the president's ultimatum his alert mind functioned\nwith the rapidity which it had often shown upon the gridiron, the\ndiamond, and the squared circle.\n\nJust for a moment the thought of being deprived of the pleasure and\nexcitement of the coming baseball season filled his mind to the\nexclusion of every other consideration, but presently a less selfish\nimpulse projected upon the screen of recollection the figure of the\nfather he idolized. The boy realized the disappointment that this man\nwould feel should his four years of college end thus disastrously and\nwithout the coveted diploma.\n\nAnd then it was that he raised his eyes to those of the president.\n\n\"I hope, sir,\" he said, \"that you will give me one more chance--that you\nwill let me go on as I have in the past as far as baseball is concerned,\nwith the understanding that if at the end of each month between now and\ncommencement I do not show satisfactory improvement I shall not be\npermitted to play on the team. But please don't make that restriction\nbinding yet. If I lay off the track work I believe I can make up enough\nso that baseball will not interfere with my graduation.\"\n\nAnd so Whiskers, who was much more human than the student body gave him\ncredit for being, and was, in the bargain, a good judge of boys, gave\nJimmy another chance on his own terms, and the university's heavyweight\nchampion returned to his room filled with determination to make good at\nthe eleventh hour.\n\nPossibly one of the greatest obstacles which lay in Jimmy's path toward\nacademic honors was the fact that he possessed those qualities of\ncharacter which attracted others to him, with the result that there was\nseldom an hour during the day that he had his room to himself. On his\nreturn from the faculty meeting he found a half-dozen of his classmates\nthere, awaiting his return.\n\n\"Well?\" they inquired as he entered.\n\n\"It's worse than that,\" said Jimmy, as he unfolded the harrowing details\nof what had transpired at his meeting with the faculty. \"And now,\" he\nsaid, \"if you birds love me, keep out of here from now until\ncommencement. There isn't a guy on earth can concentrate on anything\nwith a roomful of you mental ciphers sitting around and yapping about\ngirls and other non-essential creations.\"\n\n\"Non-essential!\" gasped one of his visitors, letting his eyes wander\nover the walls of Jimmy's study, whereon were nailed, pinned or hung\ncountless framed and unframed pictures of non-essential creations.\n\n\"All right, Jimmy,\" said another.  \"We are with you, horse, foot and\nartillery. When you want us, give us the high-sign and we will come.\nOtherwise we will leave you to your beloved books. It is too bad,\nthough, as the bar-boy was just explaining how the great drought might\nbe circumvented by means of carrots, potato peelings, dish-water, and a\nraisin.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Jimmy; \"I am not interested,\" and the boys left him to his\n\"beloved\" books.\n\nJimmy Torrance worked hard, and by dint of long hours and hard-working\ntutors he finished his college course and won his diploma. Nor did he\nhave to forego the crowning honors of his last baseball season,\nalthough, like Ulysses S. Grant, he would have graduated at the head of\nhis class had the list been turned upside down.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nJIMMY WILL ACCEPT A POSITION.\n\nFollowing his graduation he went to New York to visit with one of his\nclassmates for a short time before returning home. He was a very\nself-satisfied Jimmy, nor who can wonder, since almost from his\nmatriculation there had been constantly dinned into his ears the\nplaudits of his fellow students. Jimmy Torrance had been the one big\noutstanding feature of each succeeding class from his freshman to his\nsenior year, and as a junior and senior he had been the acknowledged\nleader of the student body and as popular a man as the university had\never known.\n\nTo his fellows, as well as to himself, he had been a great success--the\nsuccess of the university--and he and they saw in the future only\ncontinued success in whatever vocation he decided to honor with his\npresence. It was in a mental attitude that had become almost habitual\nwith him, and which was superinduced by these influences, that Jimmy\napproached the new life that was opening before him. For a while he\nwould play, but in the fall it was his firm intention to settle down to\nsome serious occupation, and it was in this attitude that he opened a\nletter from his father--the first that he had received since his\ngraduation.\n\nThe letter was written on the letterhead of the Beatrice Corn Mills,\nIncorporated, Beatrice, Nebraska, and in the upper left-hand corner, in\nsmall type, appeared \"James Torrance, Sr., President and General\nManager,\" and this is what he read:\n\n\n     Dear Jim\n\n    You have graduated--I didn't think you would--with honors in\n    football, baseball, prize-fighting, and five thousand\n    dollars in debt. How you got your diploma is beyond me--in\n    my day you would have got the sack. Well, son, I am not\n    surprised nor disappointed--it is what I expected. I know\n    you are clean, though, and that some day you will awaken to\n    the sterner side of life and an appreciation of your\n    responsibilities.\n\n    To be an entirely orthodox father I should raise merry hell\n    about your debts and utter inutility, at the same time\n    disinheriting you, but instead I am going to urge you to\n    come home and run in debt here where the cost of living is\n    not so high as in the East--meanwhile praying that your\n    awakening may come while I am on earth to rejoice.\n\n          Your affectionate\n                  FATHER,\n\n    Am enclosing check to cover your debts and present needs.\n\n\nFor a long time the boy sat looking at the letter before him.  He reread\nit once, twice, three times, and with each reading the film of\nunconscious egotism that had blinded him to his own shortcomings\ngradually became less opaque, until finally he saw himself as his father\nmust see him. He had come to college for the purpose of fitting himself\nto succeed in some particular way in the stern battle of life which\nmust follow his graduation; for, though his father had ample means to\nsupport him in indolence, Jimmy had never even momentarily considered\nsuch an eventuality.\n\nIn weighing his assets now he discovered that he had probably as\nexcellent a conception of gridiron strategy and tactics as any man in\nAmerica; that as a boxer he occupied a position in the forefront of\namateur ranks; and he was quite positive that out-side of the major\nleagues there was not a better first baseman.\n\nBut in the last few minutes there had dawned upon him the realization\nthat none of these accomplishments was greatly in demand in the business\nworld. Jimmy spent a very blue and unhappy hour, and then slowly his\nnatural optimism reasserted itself, and with it came the realization of\nhis youth and strength and inherent ability, which, without egotism, he\nmight claim.\n\n\"And then, too,\" he mused, \"I have my diploma.  I am a college graduate,\nand that must mean something. If dad had only reproached me or\nthreatened some condign punishment I don't believe I should feel half as\nbadly as I do. But every line of that letter breathes disappointment in\nme; and yet, God bless him, he tells me to come home and spend his money\nthere. Not on your life! If he won't disinherit me, I am going to\ndisinherit myself. I am going to make him proud of me. He's the best dad\na fellow ever had, and I am going to show him that I appreciate him.\"\n\nAnd so he sat down and wrote his father this reply:\n\n\n    DEAR DAD:\n\n    I have your letter and check.  You may not believe it, but\n    the former is worth more to me than the latter. Not,\n    however, that I spurn the check, which it was just like you\n    to send without a lot of grumbling and reproaches, even if I\n    do deserve them.\n\n    Your letter shows me what a rotten mess I have made of\n    myself. I'm not going to hand you a lot of mush, dad, but I\n    want to try to do something that will give you reason to at\n    least have hopes of rejoicing before I come home again. If I\n    fail I'll come home anyway, and then neither one of us will\n    have any doubt but what you will have to support me for the\n    rest of my life. However, I don't intend to fail, and one of\n    these days I will bob up all serene as president of a bank\n    or a glue factory. In the mean time I'll keep you posted as\n    to my whereabouts, but don't send me another cent until I\n    ask for it; and when I do you will know that I have failed.\n\n    Tell mother that I will write her in a day or two, probably\n    from Chicago, as I have always had an idea that that was one\n    burg where I could make good.\n\n    With lots of love to you all,\n\n                                        Your affectionate\n                                        SON.\n\nIt was a hot July day that James Torrance, Jr., alighted from the\nTwentieth Century Limited at the La Salle Street Station, and, entering\na cab, directed that he be driven to a small hotel; \"for,\" he\nsoliloquized, \"I might as well start economizing at once, as it might be\nseveral days before I land a job such as I want,\" in voicing which\nsentiments he spoke with the tongues of the prophets.\n\nJimmy had many friends in Chicago with whom, upon the occasion of\nnumerous previous visits to the Western metropolis, he had spent many\nhilarious and expensive hours, but now he had come upon the serious\nbusiness of life, and there moved within him a strong determination to\nwin financial success without recourse to the influence of rich and\npowerful acquaintances.\n\nSince the first crushing blow that his father's letter had dealt his\negotism, Jimmy's self-esteem had been gradually returning, though along\nnew and more practical lines. His self-assurance was formed in a similar\nmold to those of all his other salient characteristics, and these\nconformed to his physical proportions, for physically, mentally and\nmorally Jimmy Torrance was big; not that he was noticeably taller than\nother men or his features more than ordinarily attractive, but there was\nsomething so well balanced and harmonious in all the proportions of his\nframe and features as to almost invariably compel a second glance from\neven a casual observer, especially if the casual observer happened to be\nin the nonessential creation class.\n\nAnd so Jimmy, having had plenty of opportunity to commune with himself\nduring the journey from New York, was confident that there were many\nopportunities awaiting him in Chicago. He remembered distinctly of\nhaving read somewhere that the growing need of big business concerns was\ncompetent executive material--that there were fewer big men than there\nwere big jobs--and that if such was the case all that remained to be\ndone was to connect himself with the particular big job that suited him.\n\nIn the lobby of the hotel he bought several of the daily papers, and\nafter reaching his room he started perusing the \"Help Wanted\" columns.\nImmediately he was impressed and elated by the discovery that there were\nplenty of jobs, and that a satisfactory percentage of them appeared to\nbe big jobs. There were so many, however, that appealed to him as\nexcellent possibilities that he saw it would be impossible to apply for\neach and every one; and then it occurred to him that he might occupy a\nmore strategic position in the negotiations preceding his acceptance of\na position if his future employer came to him first, rather than should\nhe be the one to apply for the position.\n\nAnd so he decided the wisest plan would be to insert an ad in the\n\"Situations Wanted\" column, and then from the replies select those\nwhich most appealed to him; in other words, he would choose from the\ncream of those who desired the services of such a man as himself rather\nthan risk the chance of obtaining a less profitable position through\nundue haste in seizing upon the first opening advertised.\n\nHaving reached this decision, and following his habitual custom, he\npermitted no grass to grow beneath his feet. Writing out an ad, he\nreviewed it carefully, compared it with others that he saw upon the\nprinted page, made a few changes, rewrote it, and then descended to the\nlobby, where he called a cab and was driven to the office of one of the\narea's metropolitan morning newspapers.\n\nJimmy felt very important as he passed through the massive doorway into\nthe great general offices of the newspaper. Of course, he didn't exactly\nexpect that he would be ushered into the presence of the president or\nbusiness manager, or that even the advertising manager would necessarily\nhave to pass upon his copy, but there was within him a certain sensation\nthat at that instant something was transpiring that in later years would\nbe a matter of great moment, and he was really very sorry for the\npublishers of the newspaper that they did not know who it was who was\ninserting an ad in their Situations Wanted column.\n\nHe could not help but watch the face of the young man who received his\nad and counted the words, as he was sure that the clerk's facial\nexpression would betray his excitement. It was a great moment for Jimmy\nTorrance. He realized that it was probably the greatest moment of his\nlife--that here Jimmy Torrance ceased to be, and James Torrance, Jr.,\nEsq., began his career. But though he carefully watched the face of the\nclerk, he was finally forced to admit that the young man possessed\nwonderful control over his facial expression.\n\n\"That bird has a regular poker-face,\" mused Jimmy; \"never batted an\neye,\" and paying for his ad he pocketed the change and walked out.\n\n\"Let's see,\" he figured; \"it will be in tomorrow morning's edition.  The\ntired business man will read it either at breakfast or after he reaches\nhis office. I understand that there are three million people here in\nChicago. Out of that three million it is safe to assume that one million\nwill read my advertisement, and of that one-million there must be at\nleast one thousand who have responsible positions which are, at present,\ninadequately filled.\n\n\"Of course, the truth of the matter is that there are probably tens of\nthousands of such positions, but to be conservative I will assume that\nthere are only one thousand, and reducing it still further to almost an\nabsurdity, I will figure that only ten per cent of those reply to my\nadvertisement. In other words, at the lowest possible estimate I should\nhave one hundred replies on the first day. I knew it was foolish to run\nit for three days, but the fellow insisted that that was the proper way\nto do, as I got a lower rate.\n\n\"By taking it for three days, however, it doesn't seem right to make so\nmany busy men waste their time answering the ad when I shall doubtless\nfind a satisfactory position the first day.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE LIZARD.\n\nThat night Jimmy attended a show, and treated himself to a lonely dinner\nafterward. He should have liked very much to have looked up some of his\nfriends. A telephone call would have brought invitations to dinner and a\npleasant evening with convivial companions, but he had mapped his course\nand he was determined to stick to it to the end.\n\n\"There will be plenty of time,\" he thought, \"for amusement after I have\ngotten a good grasp of my new duties.\" Jimmy elected to walk from the\ntheater to his hotel, and as he was turning the corner from Randolph\ninto La Salle a young man jostled him. An instant later the stranger was\nupon his knees, his wrist doubled suddenly backward and very close to\nthe breaking-point.\n\n\"Wot t' hell yuh doin'?\" he screamed.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Jimmy: \"you got your hand in the wrong pocket.  I\nsuppose you meant to put it in your own, but you didn't.\"\n\n\"Aw, g'wan; lemme go,\" pleaded the stranger.  \"I didn't get nuthin'--\nyou ain't got the goods on me.\"\n\nNow, such a tableau as Jimmy and his new acquaintance formed cannot be\nstaged at the corner of Randolph and La Salle beneath an arc light, even\nat midnight, without attracting attention. And so it was that before\nJimmy realized it a dozen curious pedestrians were approaching them from\ndifferent directions, and a burly blue-coated figure was shouldering his\nway forward.\n\nJimmy had permitted his captive to rise, but he still held tightly to\nhis wrist as the officer confronted them. He took one look at Jimmy's\ncompanion, and then grabbed him roughly by the arm. \"So, it's you again,\nis it?\" he growled.\n\n\"I ain't done nuthin',\" muttered the man.\n\nThe officer looked inquiringly at Jimmy.\n\n\"What's all the excitement about?\" asked the latter.  \"My friend and I\nhave done nothing.\"\n\n\"Your fri'nd and you?\" replied the policeman.  \"He ain't no fri'nd o'\nyours, or yez wouldn't be sayin' so.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll admit,\" replied Jimmy, \"that possibly I haven't known him\nlong enough to presume to claim any close friendship, but there's no\ntelling what time may develop.\"\n\n\"You don't want him pinched?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied Jimmy.  \"Why should he be pinched?\"\n\nThe officer turned roughly upon the stranger, shook him viciously a few\ntimes, and then gave him a mighty shove which all but sent him sprawling\ninto the gutter.\n\n\"G'wan wid yez,\" he yelled after him, \"and if I see ye on this beat\nagain I'll run yez in. An' you\"--he turned upon Jimmy--\"ye'd\nbetther be on your way--and not be afther makin' up with ivery dip ye\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy.  \"Have a cigar.\"\n\nAfter the officer had helped himself and condescended to relax his stern\nfeatures into the semblance of a smile the young man bid him good night\nand resumed his way toward the hotel.\n\n\"Pretty early to go to bed,\" he thought as he reached for his watch to\nnote the time, running his fingers into an empty pocket. Gingerly he\nfelt in another pocket, where he knew his watch couldn't possibly be,\nnor was. Carefully Jimmy examined each pocket of his coat and trousers,\na slow and broad grin illumining his face.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" he mused.  \"And I thought I was a wise\nguy.\"\n\nA few minutes after Jimmy reached his room the office called him on the\ntelephone to tell him that a man had called to see him.\n\n\"Send him up,\" said Jimmy, wondering who it might be, since he was sure\nthat no one knew of his presence in the city. He tried to connect the\ncall in some way with his advertisement, but inasmuch as that had been\ninserted blind he felt that there could be no possible connection\nbetween that and his caller.\n\nA few minutes later there was a knock on his door, and in response to\nhis summons to enter the door opened, and there stood before him the\nyoung man of his recent encounter upon the street. The latter entered\nsoftly, closing the door behind him. His feet made no sound upon the\ncarpet, and no sound came from the door as he closed it, nor any\nslightest click from the latch. His utter silence and the stealth of his\nmovements were so pronounced as to attract immediate attention. He did\nnot speak until he had reached the center of the room and halted on the\nopposite side of the table at which Jimmy was standing; and then a very\nslow smile moved his lips, though the expression of his eyes remained\nunchanged.\n\n\"Miss anything?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the visitor, laying the other's watch upon the table.\n\n\"Why this spasm of virtue?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" replied the other.  \"I guess it's because you're a\nwhite guy. O'Donnell has been trying to get something on me for the last\nyear. He's got it in for me--I wouldn't cough every time the big stiff\nseen me.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Naw,\" said the other; \"I gotta be goin'.\"\n\n\"Come,\" insisted the host; \"sit down for a few minutes at least. I was\njust wishing that I had someone to talk to.\"\n\nThe other sank noiselessly into a chair.  \"All right, bo,\" he said.\n\nJimmy proffered him his cigar-case.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" declined the visitor. \"I'd rather have a coffin-nail,\"\nwhich Jimmy forthwith furnished.\n\n\"I should think,\" said Jimmy, \"that your particular line of endeavor\nwould prove rather hazardous in a place where you are known by the\npolice.\"\n\nThe other smiled and, as before, with his lips alone.\n\n\"Naw,\" he said; \"this is the safest place to work.  If ten per cent of\nthe bulls know me I got that much on them, and then some, because any\nboob can spot any one o' de harness bunch, and I know nearly every fly\non the department. They're the guys yuh gotta know, and usually I know\nsomething besides their names, too,\" and again his lips smiled.\n\n\"How much of your time do you have to put in at your occupation to make\na living?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Sometimes I put in six or eight hours a day,\" replied the visitor.  \"De\nrush hours on de surface line are usually good for two or t'ree hours a\nday, but I been layin' off dat stuff lately and goin' in fer de t'ater\ncrowd. Dere's more money and shorter hours.\"\n\n\"You confine yourself,\" asked Jimmy, \"to--er--ah--pocket-picking\nsolely?\"\n\nAgain the lip smile. \"I'll tell youse sumpin', bo, dat dey don't none o'\ndem big stiffs on de department know. De dip game is a stall. I learned\nit when I was a kid, an' dese yaps t'ink dat's all I know, and I keep\ndem t'inkin' it by pullin' stuff under der noses often enough to give\n'em de hunch dat I'm still at de same ol' business.\" He leaned\nconfidentially across the table. \"If you ever want a box cracked, look\nup the Lizard.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Me, bo, I'm the Lizard.\"\n\n\"Box cracked?\" repeated Jimmy.  \"An ice-box or a hot box?\"\n\nHis visitor grinned.  \"Safe,\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jimmy, \"if I ever want any one to break into a safe, come to\nyou, huh?\"\n\n\"You get me,\" replied the other.\n\n\"All right,\" said Jimmy, laughing, \"I'll call on you.  That the only\nname you got, Mr. Lizard?\"\n\n\"That's all--just the Lizard.  Now I gotta be beatin' it.\"\n\n\"Goin' to crack a box?\" asked Jimmy.\n\nThe other smiled his lip smile and turned toward the door.\n\n\"Wait a second,\" said Jimmy.  \"What would you have gotten on this watch\nof mine?\"\n\n\"It would have stood me about twenty bucks.\"\n\nJimmy reached into his pocket and drew forth a roll of bills.  \"Here,\"\nhe said, handing the other two tens.\n\n\"Naw,\" said the Lizard, shoving the proffered money away.  \"I'm no cheap\nskate.\"\n\n\"Come on--take it,\" said Jimmy.  \"I may want a box cracked some day.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Lizard, \"if you put it that way, bo.\"\n\n\"I should think,\" said Jimmy, \"that a man of your ability could earn a\nliving by less precarious methods.\"\n\n\"You would think so,\" replied the Lizard. \"I've tried two or three\ntimes to go straight. Wore out my shoes looking for a job. Never landed\nanything that paid me more than ten bucks per, and worked nine or ten\nhours a day, and half the time I couldn't get that.\"\n\n\"I suppose the police hounded you all the time, too,\" suggested Jimmy.\n\n\"Naw,\" said the Lizard; \"dat's all bunk.  De fellows that couldn't even\nfloat down a sewer straight pull dat. Once in a while dey get it in for\nsome guy, but dey're glad enough to leave us alone if we leave dem\nalone. I worked four hours to-day, maybe six before I get through, and\nI'll stand a chance of makin' all the way from fifty dollars to five\nthousand. Suppose I was drivin' a milk-wagon, gettin' up at t'ree\no'clock in the mornin' and workin' like hell--how much would I get out\nof dat? Expectin' every minute some one was goin' tuh fire me. Nuthin'\ndoin'--dey can't nobody fire me now. I'm my own boss.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jimmy, \"your logic sounds all right, but it all depends\nupon the viewpoint. But I'll tell you: you've offered me your services;\nI'll offer you mine. Whenever you want a job, look me up. I'm going to\nbe general manager of a big concern here, and you'll find me in the next\nissue of the telephone directory.\" He handed the Lizard his card.\n\n\"Tanks,\" said the latter.  \"If you don't want a box cracked any sooner\nthan I want a job, the chances are we will never meet again. So-long,\"\nand he was gone as noiselessly as he had come.\n\nJimmy breakfasted at nine the next morning, and as he waited for his\nbacon and eggs he searched the Situations Wanted columns of the morning\npaper until his eye finally alighted upon that for which he sought--the\nad that was to infuse into the business life of the great city a new and\npotent force. Before his breakfast was served Jimmy had read the few\nlines over a dozen times, and with each succeeding reading he was more\nand more pleased with the result of his advertising ability as it\nappeared in print.\n\n\n        WANTED--By College Graduate--Position as\n        General Manager of Large Business where ability,\n        energy and experience will be appreciated.\n        Address 263-S, Tribune Office.\n\nHe had decided to wait until after lunch before calling at the newspaper\noffice for replies to his advertisement, but during breakfast it\noccurred to him there probably would be several alert prospective\nemployers who would despatch their replies by special messengers, and\nrealizing that promptness was one of the cardinal virtues in the\nbusiness world, Jimmy reasoned that it would make a favorable impression\nwere he to present himself as soon as possible after the receipt of\nreplies.\n\nBy a simple system of reasoning he deduced that ten o'clock would be\nnone too early to expect some returns from his ad, and therefore at ten\npromptly he presented himself at the Want Ad Department in the Tribune\noffice.\n\nComparing the number of the receipt which Jimmy handed him with the\nnumbers upon a file of little pigeonholes, the clerk presently turned\nback toward the counter with a handful of letters.\n\n\"Whew!\" thought Jimmy.  \"I never would have guessed that I would receive\na bunch like that so early in the morning.\" But then, as he saw the\nclerk running through them one by one, he realized that they were not\nall for him, and as the young man ran through them Jimmy's spirits\ndropped a notch with each letter that was passed over without being\nthrown out to him, until, when the last letter had passed beneath the\nscrutiny of the clerk, and the advertiser realized that he had received\nno replies, he was quite sure that there was some error.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the clerk, shaking his head negatively.\n\n\"Are you sure you looked in the right compartment?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied the clerk.  \"There is nothing for you.\"\n\nJimmy pocketed his slip and walked from the office.  \"This town is\nslower than I thought it was,\" he mused. \"'I guess they do need some\nlive wires here to manage their business.\"\n\nAt noon he returned, only to be again disappointed, and then at two\no'clock, and when he came in at four the same clerk looked up wearily\nand shook his head.\n\n\"Nothing for you,\" he said.  \"I distributed all the stuff myself since\nyou were in last.\"\n\nAs Jimmy stood there almost dazed by surprise that during an entire day\nhis ad had appeared in Chicago's largest newspaper, and he had not\nreceived one reply, a man approached the counter, passed a slip similar\nto Jimmy's to the clerk, and received fully a hundred letters in return.\nJimmy was positive now that something was wrong.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" he asked the clerk, \"that my replies haven't been\nsidetracked somewhere? I have seen people taking letters away from here\nall day, and that bird there just walked off with a fistful.\"\n\nThe clerk grinned.  \"What you advertising for?\" he asked.\n\n\"A position,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"That's the answer,\" explained the clerk.  \"That fellow there was\nadvertising for help.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nJIMMY HUNTS A JOB.\n\nOnce again Jimmy walked out onto Madison Street, and, turning to his\nright, dropped into a continuous vaudeville show in an attempt to coax\nhis spirits back to somewhere near their normal high-water mark. Upon\nthe next day he again haunted the newspaper office without reward, and\nagain upon the third day with similar results. To say that Jimmy was\ndumfounded would be but a futile description of his mental state. It was\nsimply beyond him to conceive that in one of the largest cities in the\nworld, the center of a thriving district of fifty million souls, there\nwas no business man with sufficient acumen to realize how badly he\nneeded James Torrance, Jr., to conduct his business for him\nsuccessfully.\n\nWith the close of the fourth day, and no reply, Jimmy was thoroughly\nexasperated. The kindly clerk, who by this time had taken a personal\ninterest in this steadiest of customers, suggested that Jimmy try\napplying for positions advertised in the Help Wanted column, and this he\ndecided to do.\n\nThere were only two concerns advertising for general managers in the\nissue which Jimmy scanned; one ad called for an experienced executive to\nassume the general management of an old established sash, door and blind\nfactory; the other insisted upon a man with mail-order experience to\ntake charge of the mail-order department of a large department store.\n\nNeither of these were precisely what Jimmy had hoped for, his preference\nreally being for the general management of an automobile manufactory or\npossibly something in the airplane line. Sash, door and blind sounded\nextremely prosaic and uninteresting to Mr. Torrance. The mail-order\nproposition, while possibly more interesting, struck him as being too\ntrifling and unimportant.\n\n\"However,\" he thought, \"it will do no harm to have a talk with these\npeople, and possibly I might even consider giving one of them a trial.\"\n\nAnd so, calling a taxi, he drove out onto the west side where, in a\ndingy and squalid neighborhood, the taxi stopped in front of a grimy\nunpainted three-story brick building, from which a great deal of noise\nand dust were issuing. Jimmy found the office on the second floor, after\nascending a narrow, dark, and dirty stairway. Jimmy's experience of\nmanufacturing plants was extremely limited, but he needed no experience\nas he entered the room to see that he was in a busy office of a busy\nplant. Everything about the office was plain and rather dingy, but there\nwere a great many file clerks and typists and considerable bustling\nabout.\n\nAfter stating his business to a young lady who sat behind a switchboard,\nupon the front of which was the word \"Information,\" and waiting while\nshe communicated with an inner office over the telephone, he was\ndirected in the direction of a glass partition at the opposite end of\nthe room--a partition in which there were doors at intervals, and upon\neach door a name.\n\nHe had been told that Mr. Brown would see him, and rapping upon the door\nbearing that name he was bid to enter, and a moment later found himself\nin the presence of a middle-aged man whose every gesture and movement\nwas charged with suppressed nerve energy.\n\nAs Jimmy entered the man was reading a letter.  He finished it quickly,\nslapped it into a tray, and wheeled in his chair toward his caller.\n\n\"Well?\" he snapped, as Jimmy approached him.\n\n\"I came in reply to your advertisement for a general manager,\" announced\nJimmy confidently.\n\nThe man sized him up quickly from head to foot.  His eyes narrowed and\nhis brows contracted.\n\n\"What experience you had?  Who you been with, and how many years?\"  He\nsnapped the questions at Jimmy with the rapidity of machine-gun fire.\n\n\"I have the necessary ability,\" replied Jimmy, \"to manage your\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"How many years have you had in the sash, door and blind business?\"\nsnapped Mr. Brown.\n\n\"I have never had any experience in the sash, door and blind business,\"\nreplied Jimmy. \"I didn't come here to make sash, doors and blinds. I\ncame here to manage your business.\"\n\nMr. Brown half rose from his chair.  His eyes opened a little wider than\nnormal. \"What the--\" he started; and then, \"Well, of all the--\" Once\nagain he found it impossible to go on. \"You came here to manage a sash,\ndoor and blind factory, and don't know anything about the business!\nWell, of all--\"\n\n\"I assumed,\" said Jimmy, \"that what you wanted in a general manager was\nexecutive ability, and that's what I have.\"\n\n\"What you have,\" replied Mr. Brown, \"is a hell of a crust.  Now, run\nalong, young fellow. I am a very busy man--and don't forget to close\nthe door after you as you go out.\"\n\nJimmy did not forget to close the door.  As he walked the length of the\ninterminable room between rows of desks, before which were seated young\nmen and young women, all of whom Jimmy thought were staring at him, he\ncould feel the deep crimson burning upward from his collar to the roots\nof his hair.\n\nNever before in his life had Jimmy's self-esteem received such a\ntremendous jolt. He was still blushing when he reached his cab, and as\nhe drove back toward the Loop he could feel successive hot waves suffuse\nhis countenance at each recollection of the humiliating scene through\nwhich he had just passed.\n\nIt was not until the next day that Jimmy had sufficiently reestablished\nhis self-confidence to permit him to seek out the party who wished a\nmail-order manager, and while in this instance he met with very pleasant\nand gentlemanly treatment, his application was no less definitely turned\ndown.\n\nFor a month Jimmy trailed one job after another.  At the end of the\nfirst week he decided that the street-cars and sole leather were less\nexpensive than taxicabs, as his funds were running perilously low; and\nhe also lowered his aspirations successively from general managerships\nthrough departmental heads, assistants thereto, office managers,\nassistant office managers, and various other vocations, all with the\nsame result; discovering meanwhile that experience, while possibly not\nessential as some of the ads stated, was usually the rock upon which his\nhopes were dashed.\n\nHe also learned something else which surprised him greatly: that rather\nthan being an aid to his securing employment, his college education was\na drawback, several men telling him bluntly that they had no vacancies\nfor rah-rah boys.\n\nAt the end of the second week Jimmy had moved from his hotel to a still\nless expensive one, and a week later to a cheap boarding-house on the\nnorth side. At first he had written his father and his mother regularly,\nbut now he found it difficult to write them at all. Toward the middle of\nthe fourth week Jimmy had reached a point where he applied for a\nposition as office-boy.\n\n\"I'll be damned if I'm going to quit,\" he said to himself, \"if I have to\nturn street-sweeper. There must be some job here in the city that I am\ncapable of filling, and I'm pretty sure that I can at least get a job as\noffice-boy.\"\n\nAnd so he presented himself to the office manager of a life-insurance\ncompany that had advertised such a vacancy. A very kindly gentleman\ninterviewed him.\n\n\"What experience have you had?\" he asked.\n\nJimmy looked at him aghast.\n\n\"Do I have to have experience to be an office-boy?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, of course,\" replied the gentleman, \"it is not essential, but it\nis preferable. I already have applications from a dozen or more fellows,\nhalf of whom have had experience, and one in particular, whom I have\nabout decided to employ, held a similar position with another\nlife-insurance company.\"\n\nJimmy rose.  \"Good day,\" he said, and walked out.\n\nThat day he ate no lunch, but he had discovered a place where an\nabundance might be had for twenty-five cents if one knew how to order\nand ordered judiciously. And so to this place he repaired for his\ndinner. Perched upon a high stool, he filled at least a corner of the\naching void within.\n\nSitting in his room that night he took account of his assets and his\nliabilities. His room rent was paid until Saturday and this was\nThursday, and in his pocket were one dollar and sixty cents. Opening his\ntrunk, he drew forth a sheet of paper and an envelope, and, clearing the\ntop of the rickety little table which stood at the head of his bed, he\nsat down on the soiled counterpane and wrote a letter.\n\n\n       DEAR DAD:\n\n       I guess I'm through,  I have tried and\n       failed.  It is hard to admit it, but I guess I'll\n       have to.  If you will send me the price I'll\n       come home.\n                           With love,\n                           Jim\n\n\n\nSlowly he folded the letter and inserted it in the envelope, his face\nmirroring an utter dejection such as Jimmy Torrance had never before\nexperienced in his life.\n\n\"Failure,\" he muttered, \"unutterable failure.\"\n\nTaking his hat, he walked down the creaking stairway, with its\nthreadbare carpet, and out onto the street to post his letter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nJIMMY LANDS ONE.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Compton sat in the dimly lighted library upon a\ndeep-cushioned, tapestried sofa. She was not alone, yet although there\nwere many comfortable chairs in the large room, and the sofa was an\nexceptionally long one, she and her companion occupied but little more\nspace than would have comfortably accommodated a single individual.\n\n\"Stop it, Harold,\" she admonished.  \"I utterly loathe being mauled.\"\n\n\"But I can't help it, dear.  It seems so absolutely wonderful!  I can't\nbelieve it--that you are really mine.\"\n\n\"But I'm not--yet!\" exclaimed the girl.\n\n\"There are a lot of formalities and bridesmaids and ministers and things\nthat have got to be taken into consideration before I am yours. And\nanyway there is no necessity for mussing me up so. You might as well\nknow now as later that I utterly loathe this cave-man stuff. And really,\nHarold, there is nothing about your appearance that suggests a cave-man,\nwhich is probably one reason that I like you.\"\n\n\"Like me?\" exclaimed the young man.  \"I thought you loved me.\"\n\n\"I have to like you in order to love you, don't I?\" she parried.  \"And\none certainly has to like the man she is going to marry.\"\n\n\"Well,\" grumbled Mr. Bince, \"you might be more enthusiastic about it.\"\n\n\"I prefer,\" explained the girl, \"to be loved decorously.  I do not care\nto be pawed or clawed or crumpled. After we have been married for\nfifteen or twenty years and are really well acquainted--\"\n\n\"Possibly you will permit me to kiss you,\" Bince finished for her.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Harold,\" she retorted.  \"You have kissed me so much now\nthat my hair is all down, and my face must be a sight. Lips are what you\nare supposed to kiss with--you don't have to kiss with your hands.\"\n\n\"Possibly I was a little bit rough.  I am sorry,\" apologized the young\nman. \"But when a fellow has just been told by the sweetest girl in the\nworld that she will marry him, it's enough to make him a little bit\ncrazy.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" rejoined Miss Compton.  \"We should never forget the\nstratum of society to which we belong, and what we owe to the\nmaintenance of the position we hold. My father has always impressed upon\nme the fact that gentlemen or gentlewomen are always gentle-folk under\nany and all circumstances and conditions. I distinctly recall his remark\nabout one of his friends, whom he greatly admired, to this effect: that\nhe always got drunk like a gentleman. Therefore we should do everything\nas gentle-folk should do things, and when we make love we should make\nlove like gentlefolk, and not like hod-carriers or cavemen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man; \"I'll try to remember.\"\n\nIt was a little after nine o'clock when Harold Bince arose to leave.\n\n\"I'll drive you home,\" volunteered the girl.  \"Just wait, and I'll have\nBarry bring the roadster around.\"\n\n\"I thought we should always do the things that gentle-folk should do,\"\nsaid Bince, grinning, after being seated safely in the car. They had\nturned out of the driveway into Lincoln Parkway.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"Is it perfectly proper for young ladies to drive around the streets of\na big city alone after dark?\"\n\n\"But I'm not alone,\" she said.\n\n\"You will be after you leave me at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I'm different.\"\n\n\"And I'm glad that you are!\" exclaimed Bince fervently.  \"I wouldn't\nlove you if you were like the ordinary run.\"\n\nBince lived at one of the down-town clubs, and after depositing him\nthere and parting with a decorous handclasp the girl turned her machine\nand headed north for home. At Erie Street came a sudden loud hissing of\nescaping air.\n\n\"Darn!\" exclaimed Miss Elizabeth Compton as she drew in beside the curb\nand stopped. Although she knew perfectly well that one of the tires was\npunctured, she got out and walked around in front as though in search of\nthe cause of the disturbance, and sure enough, there it was, flat as a\npancake, the left front tire.\n\nThere was an extra wheel on the rear of the roadster, but it was heavy\nand cumbersome, and the girl knew from experience what a dirty job\nchanging a wheel is. She had just about decided to drive home on the\nrim, when a young man crossed the walk from Erie Street and joined her\nin her doleful appraisement of the punctured casing.\n\n\"Can I help you any?\" he asked.\n\nShe looked up at him.  \"Thank you,\" she replied, \"but I think I'll drive\nhome on it as it is. They can change it there.\"\n\n\"It looks like a new casing,\" he said.  \"It would be too bad to ruin it.\nIf you have a spare I will be very glad to change it for you,\" and\nwithout waiting for her acquiescence he stripped off his coat, rolled up\nhis shirt-sleeves, and dove under the seat for the jack.\n\nElizabeth Compton was about to protest, but there was something about\nthe way in which the stranger went at the job that indicated that he\nwould probably finish it if he wished to, in spite of any arguments she\ncould advance to the contrary. As he worked she talked with him,\ndiscovering not only that he was a rather nice person to look at, but\nthat he was equally nice to talk to.\n\nShe could not help but notice that his clothes were rather badly\nwrinkled and that his shoes were dusty and well worn; for when he\nkneeled in the street to operate the jack the sole of one shoe was\nrevealed beneath the light of an adjacent arc, and she saw that it was\nbadly worn. Evidently he was a poor young man.\n\nShe had observed these things almost unconsciously, and yet they made\ntheir impression upon her, so that when he had finished she recalled\nthem, and was emboldened thereby to offer him a bill in payment for his\nservices. He refused, as she had almost expected him to do, for while\nhis clothes and his shoes suggested that he might accept a gratuity, his\nvoice and his manner belied them.\n\nDuring the operation of changing the wheel the young man had a good\nopportunity to appraise the face and figure of the girl, both of which\nhe found entirely to his liking, and when finally she started off, after\nthanking him, he stood upon the curb watching the car until it\ndisappeared from view.\n\nSlowly he drew from his pocket an envelope which had been addressed and\nstamped for mailing, and very carefully tore it into small bits which he\ndropped into the gutter. He could not have told had any one asked him\nwhat prompted him to the act. A girl had come into his life for an\ninstant, and had gone out again, doubtless forever, and yet in that\ninstant Jimmy Torrance had taken a new grasp upon his self-esteem.\n\nIt might have been the girl, and again it might not have been.  He could\nnot tell. Possibly it was the simple little act of refusing the tip she\nhad proffered him. It might have been any one of a dozen little\ndifferent things, or an accumulation of them all, that had brought back\na sudden flood of the old self-confidence and optimism.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said Jimmy as he climbed into his bed, \"I am going to land\na job.\"\n\nAnd he did.  In the department store to the general managership of whose\nmail-order department he had aspired Jimmy secured a position in the\nhosiery department at ten dollars a week. The department buyer who had\ninterviewed him asked him what experience he had had with ladies'\nhosiery.\n\n\"About four or five years,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"For whom did you work?\"\n\n\"I was in business for myself,\" replied the applicant, \"both in the West\nand in the East. I got my first experience in a small town in Nebraska,\nbut I carried on a larger business in the East later.\"\n\nSo they gave Jimmy a trial in a new section of the hosiery department,\nwherein he was the only male clerk. The buyer had discovered that there\nwas a sufficient proportion of male customers, many of whom displayed\nevident embarrassment in purchasing hosiery from young ladies, to\nwarrant putting a man clerk in one of the sections for this class of\ntrade.\n\nThe fact of the matter was, however, that the astute buyer was never\nable to determine the wisdom of his plan, since Jimmy's entire time was\nusually occupied in waiting upon impressionable young ladies. However,\ninasmuch as it redounded to the profit of the department, the buyer\nfound no fault.\n\nPossibly if Jimmy had been almost any other type of man from what he\nwas, his presence would not have been so flamboyantly noticeable in a\nhosiery department. His stature, his features, and his bronzed skin,\nthat had lost nothing of its bronze in his month's search for work\nthrough the hot summer streets of a big city, were as utterly out of\nplace as would have been the salient characteristics of a chorus-girl in\na blacksmith-shop.\n\nFor the first week Jimmy was frightfully embarrassed, and to his natural\nbronze was added an almost continuous flush of mortification from the\nmoment that he entered the department in the morning until he left it at\nnight.\n\n\"It is a job, however,\" he thought, \"and ten dollars is better than\nnothing. I can hang onto it until something better turns up.\"\n\nWith his income now temporarily fixed at the amount of his wages, he was\nforced to find a less expensive boarding-place, although at the time he\nhad rented his room he had been quite positive that there could not be a\ncheaper or more undesirable habitat for man. Transportation and other\nconsiderations took him to a place on Indiana Avenue near Eighteenth\nStreet, from whence he found he could walk to and from work, thereby\nsaving ten cents a day. \"And believe me,\" he cogitated, \"I need the\nten.\"\n\nJimmy saw little of his fellow roomers.  A strange, drab lot he thought\nthem from the occasional glimpses he had had in passings upon the dark\nstairway and in the gloomy halls. They appeared to be quiet, inoffensive\nsort of folk, occupied entirely with their own affairs. He had made no\nfriends in the place, not even an acquaintance, nor did he care to. What\nleisure time he had he devoted to what he now had come to consider as\nhis life work--the answering of blind ads in the Help Wanted columns of\none morning and one evening paper--the two mediums which seemed to\ncarry the bulk of such advertising.\n\nFor a while he had sought a better position by applying during the noon\nhour to such places as gave an address close enough to the department\nstore in which he worked to permit him to make the attempt during the\nforty-five-minute period he was allowed for his lunch.\n\nBut he soon discovered that nine-tenths of the positions were filled\nbefore he arrived, and that in the few cases where they were not he not\nonly failed of employment, but was usually so delayed that he was late\nin returning to work after noon.\n\nBy replying to blind ads evenings he could take his replies to the two\nnewspaper offices during his lunch hour, thereby losing no great amount\nof time. Although he never received a reply, he still persisted as he\nfound the attempt held something of a fascination for him, similar\nprobably to that which holds the lottery devotee or the searcher after\nburied treasure--there was always the chance that he would turn up\nsomething big.\n\nAnd so another month dragged by slowly.  His work in the department\nstore disgusted him. It seemed such a silly, futile occupation for a\nfull-grown man, and he was always fearful that the sister or sweetheart\nor mother of some of his Chicago friends would find him there behind the\ncounter in the hosiery section.\n\nThe store was a large one, including many departments, and Jimmy tried\nto persuade the hosiery buyer to arrange for his transfer to another\ndepartment where his work would be more in keeping with his sex and\nappearance.\n\nHe rather fancied the automobile accessories line, but the buyer was\nperfectly satisfied with Jimmy's sales record, and would do nothing to\nassist in the change. The university heavyweight champion had reached a\npoint where he loathed but one thing more than he did silk hosiery, and\nthat one thing was himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nHAROLD PLAYS THE RAVEN.\n\nMason Compton, president and general manager, sat in his private office\nin the works of the International Machine Company, chewing upon an\nunlighted cigar and occasionally running his fingers through his\niron-gray hair as he compared and recompared two statements which lay\nupon the desk before him.\n\n\"Damn strange,\" he muttered as he touched a button beneath the edge of\nhis desk. A boy entered the room. \"Ask Mr. Bince if he will be good\nenough to step in here a moment, please,\" said Compton; and a moment\nlater, when Harold Bince entered, the older man leaned back in his chair\nand motioned the other to be seated.\n\n\"I can't understand these statements, Harold,\" said Compton.  \"Here is\none for August of last year and this is this August's statement of\ncosts. We never had a better month in the history of this organization\nthan last month, and yet our profits are not commensurate with the\nvolume of business that we did. That's the reason I sent for these cost\nstatements and have compared them, and I find that our costs have\nincreased out of all proportions to what is warranted. How do you\naccount for it?\"\n\n\"Principally the increased cost of labor,\" replied Bince.  \"The same\nholds true of everybody else. Every manufacturer in the country is in\nthe same plight we are.\"\n\n\"I know,\" agreed Compton, \"that that is true to some measure.  Both\nlabor and raw materials have advanced, but we have advanced our prices\ncorrespondingly. In some instances it seems to me that our advance in\nprices, particularly on our specialties, should have given us even a\nhandsomer profit over the increased cost of production than we formerly\nreceived.\n\n\"In the last six months since I appointed you assistant manager I am\nafraid that I have sort of let things get out of my grasp. I have a lot\nof confidence in you, Harold, and now that you and Elizabeth are engaged\nI feel even more inclined to let you shoulder the responsibilities that\nI have carried alone from the inception of this organization. But I've\ngot to be mighty sure that you are going to do at least as well as I\ndid. You have shown a great deal of ability, but you are young and\nhaven't had the advantage of the years of experience that made it\npossible for me to finally develop a business second to none in this\nline in the West.\n\n\"I never had a son, and after Elizabeth's mother died I have lived in\nthe hope somehow that she would marry the sort of chap who would really\ntake the place of such a son as every man dreams of--some one who will\ntake his place and carry on his work when he is ready to lay aside his\ntools. I liked your father, Harold. He was one of the best friends that\nI ever had, and I can tell you now what I couldn't have you a month ago:\nthat when I employed you and put you in this position it was with the\nhope that eventually you would fill the place in my business and in my\nhome of the son I never had.\"\n\n\"Do you think Elizabeth guessed what was in your mind?\" asked Bince.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied the older man.  \"I have tried never to say\nanything to influence her. Years ago when she was younger we used to\ntalk about it half jokingly and shortly after you told me of your\nengagement she remarked to me one day that she was happy, for she knew\nyou were going to be the sort of son I had wanted.\n\n\"I haven't anybody on earth but her, Harold, and when I die she gets the\nbusiness. I have arranged it in my will so you two will share and share\nalike in profits after I go, but that will be some time. I am far from\nbeing an old man, and I am a mighty healthy one. However, I should like\nto be relieved of the active management. There are a lot of things that I\nhave always wanted to do that I couldn't do because I couldn't spare the\ntime from my business.\n\n\"And so I want you to get thoroughly into the harness as soon as\npossible, that I may turn over the entire management to you. But I can't do\nit, Harold, while the profits are diminishing.\"\n\nAs the older man's gaze fell again to statements before him the eyes of\nthe younger man narrowed just a trifle as they rested upon Mason Compton,\nand then as the older man looked up Bince's expression changed.\n\n\"I'll do my best, sir,\" he said, smiling.  \"Of course I realize, as you\nmust, that I have tried to learn a great deal in a short time. I think I\nhave reached a point now where I pretty thoroughly grasp the\npossibilities and requirements of my work, and I am sure that from now\non you will note a decided change for the better on the right side of\nthe ledger.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, my boy,\" said Compton heartily.  \"Don't think that I\nhave been finding fault with anything you have done. I just wanted to\ncall your attention to these figures. They mean something, and it's up\nto you to find out just what they do mean.\"\n\nAnd then there came a light tap on the door, which opened immediately\nbefore any summons to enter had been given, and Elizabeth Compton\nentered, followed by another young woman.\n\n\"Hello, there!\" exclaimed Compton.  \"What gets us out so early?  And\nHarriet too! There is only one thing that would bring you girls in here\nso early.\"\n\n\"And what's that?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"You are going shopping, and Elizabeth wants some money.\"\n\nThey all laughed.  \"You're a regular Sherlock Holmes!\" exclaimed Harriet\nHolden.\n\n\"How much?\" asked Compton of his daughter, still smiling.\n\n\"How much have you?\" asked Elizabeth.  \"I am utterly broke.\"\n\nCompton turned to Bince.  \"Get her what she needs, Harold,\" he said.\n\nThe young man started to the door.\n\n\"Come with me, Elizabeth,\" he said; \"we will go out to the cashier's\ncage and get you fixed up.\"\n\nThey entered Bince's office, which adjoined Compton's.\n\n\"Wait here a minute, Elizabeth,\" said Bince.  \"How much do you want?\nI'll get it for you and bring it back. I want to see you a moment alone\nbefore you go.\"\n\nShe told him how much she wanted, and he was back shortly with the\ncurrency.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said, \"I don't know whether you have noticed it or not,\nbecause your father isn't a man to carry his troubles home, but I\nbelieve that he is failing rapidly, largely from overwork. He worries\nabout conditions here which really do not exist. I have been trying to\ntake the load off his shoulders so that he could ease up a bit, but he\nhas got into a rut from which he cannot be guided.\n\n\"He will simply have to be lifted completely out of it, or he will stay\nhere and die in the harness. Everything is running splendidly, and now\nthat I have a good grasp of the business I can handle it. Don't you\nsuppose you could persuade him to take a trip? I know that he wants to\ntravel. He has told me so several times, and if he could get away from\nhere this fall and stay away for a year, if possible, it would make a\nnew man of him. I am really very much worried about him, and while I\nhate to worry you I feel that you are the only person who can influence\nhim and that something ought to be done and done at once.\"\n\n\"Why, Harold,\" exclaimed the girl, \"there is nothing the matter with\nfather! He was never better in his life nor more cheerful.\"\n\n\"That's the side of him that he lets you see,\" replied the man.  \"His\ngaiety is all forced. If you could see him after you leave you would\nrealize that he is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Your father is\nnot an old man in years, but he has placed a constant surtax on his\nnervous system for the last twenty-five years without a let-up, and it\ndoesn't make any difference how good a machine may be it is going to\nwear out some day, and the better the machine the more complete will be\nthe wreck when the final break occurs.\"\n\nAs he spoke he watched the girl's face, the changing expression of it,\nwhich marked her growing mental perturbation.\n\n\"You really believe it is as bad as that, Harold?\" she asked.\n\n\"It may be worse than I think,\" he said.  \"It is surely fully as bad.\"\n\nThe girl rose slowly from the chair.  \"I will try and persuade him to\nsee Dr. Earle.\"\n\nThe man took a step toward her.  \"I don't believe a doctor is what he\nneeds,\" he said quickly. \"His condition is one that even a nerve\nspecialist might not diagnose correctly. It is only some one in a\nposition like mine, who has an opportunity to observe him almost hourly,\nday by day, who would realize his condition. I doubt if he has any\norganic trouble whatever. What he needs is a long rest, entirely free\nfrom any thought whatever of business. At least, Elizabeth, it will do\nhim no harm, and it may prolong his life for years. I wouldn't go\nmessing around with any of these medical chaps.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said at last, with a sigh, \"I will talk to him and see if I\ncan't persuade him to take a trip. He has always wanted to visit Japan\nand China.\"\n\n\"Just the thing!\" exclaimed Bince; \"just the thing for him.  The long\nsea voyage will do him a world of good. And now,\" he said, stepping to\nher side and putting an arm around her.\n\nShe pushed him gently away.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"I do not feel like kissing now,\" and turning she\nentered her father's office, followed by Bince.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nJOBLESS AGAIN.\n\nFrom her father's works Elizabeth and Harriet drove to the shopping\ndistrict, where they strolled through a couple of shops and then stopped\nat one of the larger stores.\n\nJimmy Torrance was arranging his stock, fully nine-tenths of which he\ncould have sworn he had just shown an elderly spinster who had taken at\nleast half an hour of his time and then left without making a purchase.\nHis back was toward his counter when his attention was attracted by a\nfeminine voice asking if he was busy. As he turned about he recognized\nher instantly--the girl for whom he had changed a wheel a month before\nand who unconsciously had infused new ambition into his blood and saved\nhim, temporarily at least, from becoming a quitter.\n\nHe noticed as he waited on her that she seemed to be appraising him very\ncarefully, and at times there was a slightly puzzled expression on her\nface, but evidently she did not recognize him, and finally when she had\nconcluded her purchases he was disappointed that she paid for them in\ncash. He had rather hoped that she would have them charged and sent,\nthat he might learn her name and address. And then she left, with Jimmy\nnone the wiser concerning her other than that her first name was\nElizabeth and that she was even better-looking than he recalled her to\nhave been.\n\n\"And the girl with her!\" exclaimed Jimmy mentally.  \"She was no slouch\neither. They are the two best-looking girls I have seen in this town,\nnotwithstanding the fact that whether one likes Chicago or not he's got\nto admit that there are more pretty girls here than in any other city in\nthe country.\n\n\"I'm glad she didn't recognize me.  Of course, I don't know her, and the\nchances are that I never shall, but I should hate to have any one\nrecognize me here, or hereafter, as that young man at the stocking\ncounter. Gad! but it's beastly that a regular life-sized man should be\nselling stockings to women for a living, or rather for a fraction of a\nliving.\"\n\nWhile Jimmy had always been hugely disgusted with his position, the\nsight of the girl seemed to have suddenly crystallized all those weeks\nof self-contempt into a sudden almost mad desire to escape what he\nconsidered his degrading and effeminating surroundings. One must bear\nwith Jimmy and judge him leniently, for after all, notwithstanding his\ncollege diploma and physique, he was still but a boy and so while it is\ndifficult for a mature and sober judgment to countenance his next step,\nif one can look back a few years to his own youth he can at least find\nextenuating circumstances surrounding Jimmy's seeming foolishness.\n\nFor with a bang that caused startled clerks in all directions to look up\nfrom their work he shattered the decorous monotone of the great store by\nslamming his sales book viciously upon the counter, and without a word\nof explanation to his fellow clerks marched out of the section toward\nthe buyer's desk.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Torrance,\" asked that gentleman, \"what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I am going to quit,\" announced Jimmy.\n\n\"Quit!\"' exclaimed the buyer.  \"Why, what's wrong?  Isn't everything\nperfectly satisfactory? You have never complained to me.\"\n\n\"I can't explain,\" replied Jimmy.  \"I am going to quit.  I am not\nsatisfied. I am going to er--ah--accept another position.\"\n\nThe buyer raised his eyebrows.  \"Ah!\" he said.  \"With--\" and he named\ntheir closest competitor.\n\n\"No,\" said Jimmy.  \"I am going to get a regular he-job.\"\n\nThe other smiled.  \"If an increase in salary,\" he suggested, \"would\ninfluence you, I had intended to tell you that I would take care of you\nbeginning next week. I thought of making it fifteen dollars,\" and with\nthat unanswerable argument for Jimmy's continued service the buyer sat\nback and folded his hands.\n\n\"Nothing stirring,\" said Jimmy.  \"I wouldn't sell another sock if you\npaid me ten thousand dollars a year. I am through.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the buyer aggrievedly, \"but if you leave me this\nway you will be unable to refer to the house.\"\n\nBut nothing, not even a team of oxen, could have held Jimmy in that\nsection another minute, and so he got his pay and left with nothing more\nin view than a slow death by starvation.\n\n\"There,\" exclaimed Elizabeth Compton, as she sank back on the cushions\nof her car.\n\n\"There what?\" asked Harriet.\n\n\"I have placed him.\"\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"That nice-looking young person who waited on us in the hosiery\nsection.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Harriet.  \"He was nice-looking, wasn't he?  But he looked out\nof place there, and I think he felt out of place. Did you notice how he\nflushed when he asked you what size?\" and the girls laughed heartily at\nthe recollection. \"But where have you ever met him before?\" Harriet\nasked.\n\n\"I have never met him,\" corrected Elizabeth, accenting the \"met.\" \"He\nchanged a wheel on the roadster several weeks ago one evening after I\nhad taken Harold down to the club. And he was very nice about it. I\nshould say that he is a gentleman, although his clothes were pretty\nbadly worn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harriet, \"his suit was shabby, but his linen was clean and\nhis coat well brushed.\"\n\n\"My!\" exclaimed Elizabeth.  \"He must have made an impression on some\none.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Harriet, \"it isn't often you see such a nice-looking chap\nin the hosiery section.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Elizabeth, \"and probably if he were as nice as he looks he\nwouldn't be there.\"\n\nWhereupon the subject was changed, and she promptly forgot Mr. Jimmy\nTorrance. But Jimmy was not destined soon to forget her, for as the\njobless days passed and he realized more and more what an ass he had\nmade of himself, and why, he had occasion to think about her a great\ndeal, although never in any sense reproaching her. He realized that the\nfault was his own and that he had done a foolish thing in giving up his\nposition because of a girl he did not know and probably never would.\n\nThere came a Saturday when Jimmy, jobless and fundless, dreaded his\nreturn to the Indiana Avenue rooming-house, where he knew the landlady\nwould be eagerly awaiting him, for he was a week in arrears in his room\nrent already, and had been warned he could expect no further credit.\n\n\"There is a nice young man wanting your room,\" the landlady had told\nhim, \"and I shall have to be having it Saturday night unless you can pay\nup.\"\n\nJimmy stood on the corner of Clark and Van Buren looking at his watch.\n\"I hate to do it,\" he thought, \"but the Lizard said he could get twenty\nfor it, and twenty would give me another two weeks.\" And so his watch\nwent, and two weeks later his cigarette-case and ring followed. Jimmy\nhad never gone in much for jewelry--a fact which he now greatly\nlamented.\n\nSome of the clothes he still had were good, though badly in want of\npressing, and when, after still further days of fruitless searching for\nwork the proceeds from the articles he had pawned were exhausted, it\noccurred to him he might raise something on all but what he actually\nneeded to cover his nakedness.\n\nIn his search for work he was still wearing his best-looking suit; the\nothers he would dispose of; and with this plan in his mind on his return\nto his room that night he went to the tiny closet to make a bundle of\nthe things which he would dispose of on the morrow, only to discover\nthat in his absence some one had been there before him, and that there\nwas nothing left for him to sell.\n\nIt would be two days before his room rent was again due, but in the mean\ntime Jimmy had no money wherewith to feed the inner man. It was an\nalmost utterly discouraged Jimmy who crawled into his bed to spend a\nsleepless night of worry and vain regret, the principal object of his\nregret being that he was not the son of a blacksmith who had taught him\nhow to shoe horses and who at the same time had been too poor to send\nhim to college.\n\nLong since there had been driven into his mind the conviction that for\nany practical purpose in life a higher education was as useless as the\nproverbial fifth wheel to the coach.\n\n\"And even,\" mused Jimmy, \"if I had graduated at the head of my class, I\nwould be no better off than I am now.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nBREAD FROM THE WATERS.\n\nThe next day, worn out from loss of sleep, the young man started out\nupon a last frenzied search for employment. He had no money for\nbreakfast, and so he went breakfastless, and as he had no carfare it was\nnecessary for him to walk the seemingly interminable miles from one\nprospective job to another. By the middle of the afternoon Jimmy was\nhungrier than he had ever been before in his life. He was so hungry that\nit actually hurt, and he was weak from physical fatigue and from\ndisappointment and worry.\n\n\"I've got to eat,\" he soliloquized fiercely,  \"if I have to go out\nto-night and pound somebody on the head to get the price, and I'm going\nto do it,\" he concluded as the odors of cooking food came to him from a\ncheap restaurant which he was passing. He stopped a moment and looked\ninto the window at the catsup bottles and sad-looking pies which the\nproprietor apparently seemed to think formed an artistic and attractive\nwindow display.\n\n\"If I had a brick,\" thought Jimmy, \"I would have one of those pies, even\nif I went to the jug for it,\" but his hunger had not made him as\ndesperate as he thought he was, and so he passed slowly on, and,\nglancing into the windows of the store next door, saw a display of\nsecond-hand clothes and the sign \"Clothes Bought and Sold.\"\n\nJimmy looked at those in the window and then down at his own, which,\nthough wrinkled, were infinitely better than anything on display.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he mused, \"if I couldn't put something over in the way of\nhigh finance here,\" and, acting upon the inspiration, he entered the\ndingy little shop. When he emerged twenty minutes later he wore a shabby\nand rather disreputable suit of hand-me-downs, but he had two silver\ndollars in his pocket.\n\nWhen Jimmy returned to his room that night it was with a full stomach,\nbut with the knowledge that he had practically reached the end of his\nrope. He had been unable to bring himself to the point of writing his\nfather an admission of his failure, and in fact he had gone so far, and\nin his estimation had sunk so low, that he had definitely determined he\nwould rather starve to death now than admit his utter inefficiency to\nthose whose respect he most valued.\n\nAs he climbed the stairway to his room he heard some one descending from\nabove, and as they passed beneath the dim light of a flickering gas-jet\nhe realized that the other stopped suddenly and turned back to look\nafter him as Jimmy continued his ascent of the stairs; and then a low\nvoice inquired:\n\n\"Say, bo, what you doin' here?\"\n\nJimmy turned toward the questioner.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed as recognition of the other dawned slowly upon him.\n\"It's you, is it? My old and esteemed friend, the Lizard.\"\n\n\"Sure, it's me,\" replied the Lizard.  \"But what you doin' here?  Looking\nfor an assistant general manager?\"\n\nJimmy grinned.\n\n\"Don't rub it in,\" he said, still smiling.\n\nThe other ascended toward him, his keen eyes appraising him from head to\nfoot.\n\n\"You live here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jimmy; \"do you?\"\n\n\"Sure, I been livin' here for the last six months.\"\n\n\"That's funny,\" said Jimmy; \"I have been here about two months myself.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked the Lizard.  \"Didn't you like the\njob as general manager?\"\n\nJimmy flushed.\n\n\"Forget it,\" he admonished.\n\n\"Where's your room?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"Up another flight,\" said Jimmy.  \"Won't you come up?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the Lizard, and together the two ascended the stairs and\nentered Jimmy's room. Under the brighter light there the Lizard\nscrutinized his host.\n\n\"You been against it, bo, haven't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I sure have,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Gee,\" said the other, \"what a difference clothes make!  You look like a\nregular bum.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"What you doin'?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Lose your job?\"\n\n\"I quit it,\" said Jimmy.  \"I've only worked a month since I've been\nhere, and that for the munificent salary of ten dollars a week.\"\n\n\"Do you want to make some coin?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"I sure do,\" said Jimmy.  \"I don't know of anything I would rather\nhave.\"\n\n\"I'm pullin' off something to-morrow night.  I can use you,\" and he eyed\nJimmy shrewdly as he spoke.\n\n\"Cracking a box?\" asked Jimmy, grinning.\n\n\"It might be something like that,\" replied the Lizard; \"but you won't\nhave nothin' to do but stand where I put you and make a noise like a cat\nif you see anybody coming. It ought to be something good. I been working\non it for three months. We'll split something like fifty thousand\nthirty-seventy.\"\n\n\"Is that the usual percentage?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"It's what I'm offerin' you,\" replied the lizard.\n\nThirty per cent of fifty thousand dollars!  Jimmy jingled the few pieces\nof silver remaining in his pocket. Fifteen thousand dollars! And here he\nhad been walking his legs off and starving in a vain attempt to earn a\nfew paltry dollars honestly.\n\n\"There's something wrong somewhere,\" muttered Jimmy to himself.\n\n\"I'm taking it from an old crab who has more than he can use, and all of\nit he got by robbing people that didn't have any to spare. He's a big\nguy here. When anything big is doing the newspaper guys interview him\nand his name is in all the lists of subscriptions to charity--when\nthey're going to be published in the papers. I'll bet he takes\nnine-tenths of his kale from women and children, and he's an honored\ncitizen. I ain't no angel, but whatever I've taken didn't cause nobody\nany sufferin'--I'm a thief, bo, and I'm mighty proud of it when I think\nof what this other guy is.\"\n\nThirty per cent of fifty thousand dollars!  Jimmy was sitting with his\nlegs crossed. He looked down at his ill-fitting, shabby trousers, and\nthen turned up the sole of one shoe which was worn through almost to his\nsock. The Lizard watched him as a cat watches a mouse. He knew that the\nother was thinking hard, and that presently he would reach a decision,\nand through Jimmy's mind marched a sordid and hateful procession of\nrecent events--humiliation, rebuff, shame, poverty, hunger, and in the\nbackground the face of his father and the face of a girl whose name,\neven, he did not know.\n\nPresently he looked up at the Lizard.\n\n\"Nothing doing, old top,\" he said.  \"But don't mistake the motives which\nprompt me to refuse your glittering offer. I am moved by no moral\nscruples, however humiliating such a confession should be. The way I\nfeel now I would almost as lief go out and rob widows and orphans\nmyself, but each of us, some time in our life, has to consider some one\nwho would probably rather see us dead than disgraced. I don't know\nwhether you get me or not.\"\n\n\"I get you,\" replied the Lizard, \"and while you may never wear diamonds,\nyou'll get more pleasure out of life than I ever will, provided you\ndon't starve to death too soon. You know, I had a hunch you would turn\nme down, and I'm glad you did. If you were going crooked some time I\nthought I'd like to have you with me. When it comes to men, I'm a pretty\ngood picker. That's the reason I have kept out of jail so long. I either\npick a square one or I work alone.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy, \"but how do you know that after you pull this job\nI won't tip off the police and claim the reward.\"\n\nThe Lizard grinned his lip grin.\n\n\"There ain't one chance in a million,\" he said.  \"You'd starve to death\nbefore you'd do it. And now, what you want is a job. I can probably get\nyou one if you ain't too particular.\"\n\n\"I'd do anything,\" said Jimmy, \"that I could do and still look a policeman\nin the face.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Lizard.  \"When I come back I'll bring you a job of\nsome sort. I may be back to-night, and I may not be back again for a\nmonth, and in the mean time you got to live.\"\n\nHe drew a roll of bills from his pocket and commenced to count out\nseveral.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Jimmy.  \"Once again, nothing doing.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" admonished the Lizard.  \"I'm just payin' back the twenty\nyou loaned me.\"\n\n\"But I didn't loan it to you,\" said Jimmy; \"I gave it to you as a reward\nfor finding my watch.\"\n\nThe Lizard laughed and shoved the money across the table.\n\n\"Take it,\" he said; \"don't be a damn fool.  And now so-long!  I may\nbring you home a job to-night, but if I don't you've got enough to live\non for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nAfter the Lizard had gone Jimmy sat looking at the twenty dollars for a\nlong time.\n\n\"That fellow may be a thief,\" he soliloquized, \"but whatever he is he's\nwhite. Just imagine, the only friend I've got in Chicago is a\nsafe-blower.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nHAROLD SITS IN A GAME.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Compton broached to her father the subject of a\nmuch-needed rest and a trip to the Orient, he laughed at her. \"Why,\ngirl,\" he cried, \"I was never better in my life! Where in the world did\nyou get this silly idea?\"\n\n\"Harold noticed it first,\" she replied, \"and called my attention to it;\nand now I can see that you really have been failing.\"\n\n\"Failing!\" ejaculated Compton, with a scoff.  \"Failing nothing!  You're\na pair of young idiots. I'm good for twenty years more of hard work,\nbut, as I told Harold, I would like to quit and travel, and I shall do\nso just as soon as I am convinced that he can take my place.\"\n\n\"Couldn't he do it now?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"No, I am afraid not,\" replied Compton.  \"It is too much to expect of\nhim, but I believe that in another year he will be able to.\"\n\nAnd so Compton put an end to the suggestion that he travel for his\nhealth, and that night when Bince called she told him that she had been\nunable to persuade her father that he needed a rest.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that you don't take it seriously enough\nyourself, and that you failed to impress upon him the real gravity of\nhis condition. It is really necessary that he go--he must go.\"\n\nThe girl looked up quickly at the speaker, whose tones seemed\nunnecessarily vehement.\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" she said, \"why you should take the matter so\nto heart. Father is the best judge of his own condition, and, while he\nmay need a rest, I cannot see that he is in any immediate danger.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" replied Bince irritably, \"I just wanted him to get away for\nhis own sake. Of course, it don't mean anything to me.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you tonight, anyway, Harold?\" she asked a half\nan hour later. \"You're as cross and disagreeable as you can be.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" he said.  \"There is nothing the matter with me at all.\"\n\nBut his denial failed to convince her, and as, unusually early, a few\nminutes later he left, she realized that she had spent a most unpleasant\nevening.\n\nBince went directly to his club, where he found four other men who were\nevidently awaiting him.\n\n\"Want to sit in a little game to-night, Harold?\" asked one of them.\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" replied Bince, \"you fellows have been sitting here all\nevening waiting for me. You know I want to. My luck's got to change some\ntime.\"\n\n\"Sure thing it has,\" agreed another of the men.  \"You certainly have\nbeen playing in rotten luck, but when it does change--oh, baby!\"\n\nAs the five men entered one of the cardrooms several of the inevitable\nspectators drew away from the other games and approached their table,\nfor it was a matter of club gossip that these five played for the\nlargest stakes of any coterie among the habitues of the card-room.\n\nIt was two o'clock in the morning before Bince disgustedly threw his\ncards upon the table and rose. There was a nasty expression on his face\nand in his mind a thing which he did not dare voice--the final\ncrystallization of a suspicion that he had long harbored, that his\ncompanions had been for months deliberately fleecing him. Tonight he had\nlost five thousand dollars, nor was there a man at the table who did not\nhold his I. O. U's. for similar amounts.\n\n\"I'm through, absolutely through,\" he said.  \"I'll be damned if I ever\ntouch another card.\"\n\nHis companions only smiled wearily, for they knew that to-morrow night\nhe would be back at the table.\n\n\"How much of old man Compton's money did you get tonight?\" asked one of\nthe four after Bince had left the room.\n\n\"About two thousand dollars,\" was the reply, \"which added to what I\nalready hold, puts Mr. Compton in my debt some seven or eight thousand\ndollars.\"\n\nWhereupon they all laughed.\n\n\"I suppose,\" remarked anther, \"that it's a damn shame, but if we don't\nget it some one else will.\"\n\n\"Is he paying anything at all?\" asked another.\n\n\"Oh, yes; he comes across with something now and then, but we'll\nprobably have to carry the bulk of it until after the wedding.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't carry it forever,\" said the first speaker.  \"I'm not\nplaying here for my health,\" and, rising, he too left the room. Going\ndirectly to the buffet, he found Bince, as he was quite sure that he\nwould.\n\n\"Look here, old man,\" he said, \"I hate to seem insistent, but, on the\nlevel, I've got to have some money.\"\n\n\"I've told you two or three times,\"' replied Bince, \"that I'd let you\nhave it as soon as I could get it. I can't get you any now.\"\n\n\"If you haven't got it, Mason Compton has,\" retorted the creditor, \"and\nif you don't come across I'll go to him and get it.\"\n\nBince paled.\n\n\"You wouldn't do that, Harry?\" he almost whimpered.  \"For God's sake,\ndon't do that, and I'll try and see what I can do for you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the other, \"I don't want to be nasty, but I need some\nmoney badly.\"\n\n\"Give me a little longer,\" begged Bince, \"and I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nJimmy Torrance sat a long time in thought after the Lizard left.  \"God!\"\nhe muttered. \"I wonder what dad would say if he knew that I had come to\na point where I had even momentarily considered going into partnership\nwith a safe-blower, and that for the next two weeks I shall be\ncompelled to subsist upon the charity of a criminal?\n\n\"I'm sure glad that I have a college education.  It has helped me\nmaterially to win to my present exalted standing in society. Oh, well I\nmight be worse off, I suppose. At least I don't have to worry about the\nincome tax.\n\n\"It is now October, and since the first of the year I have earned forty\ndollars exactly. I have also received a bequest of twenty dollars, which\nof course is exempt. I venture to say that there is not another\nable-bodied adult male in the United States the making of whose\nincome-tax schedule would be simpler than mine.\"\n\nWith which philosophic trend of thought, and the knowledge that he could\neat for at least two weeks longer, the erstwhile star amateur first\nbaseman sought the doubtful comfort of his narrow, lumpy bed.\n\nIt was in the neighborhood of two o'clock the next morning that he was\nawakened by a gentle tapping upon the panels of his door.\n\n\"Who is it?\" he asked.  \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"It's me bo,\" came the whispered reply in the unmistakable tones of the\nLizard.\n\nJimmy arose, lighted the gas, and opened the door.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Are the police on your trail?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Lizard, grinning. \"I just dropped in to tell you that\nI grabbed a job for you.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" exclaimed Jimmy. \"You're a regular fellow all right.\"\n\n\"But you might not like the job,\" suggested the Lizard.\n\n\"As long as I can earn an honest dollar,\" cried Jimmy, striking a\ndramatic pose, \"I care not what it may be.\"\n\nThe Lizard's grin broadened.\n\n\"I ain't so sure about that,\" he said.  \"I know your kind.  You're a\nregular gent. There is some honest jobs that you would just as soon have\nas the smallpox, and maybe this is one of them.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jimmy.  \"Don't keep me guessing any longer.\"\n\n\"You know Feinheimer's Cabaret.\"\n\n\"The basement joint on Wells Street?\" asked Jimmy.  \"Sure I know it.\"\n\n\"Well, that's where I got you a job,\" said the Lizard.\n\n\"What doing?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Waiter,\" was the reply.\n\n\"It isn't any worse than standing behind a counter, selling stockings to\nwomen,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"It ain't such a bad job,\" admitted the Lizard, \"if a guy ain't too\nswelled up. Some of 'em make a pretty good thing out of it, what with\ntheir tips and short changing--Oh, there are lots of little ways to\nget yours at Feinheimer's.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Jimmy; \"but don't he pay any wages?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" replied the Lizard; \"you get the union scale.\"\n\n\"When do I go to work?\"\n\n\"Go around and see him to-morrow morning.  He will put you right to\nwork.\"\n\nAnd so the following evening the patrons of Feinheimer's Cabaret saw a\nnew face among the untidy servitors of the establishment--a new face\nand a new figure, both of which looked out of place in the atmosphere of\nthe basement resort.\n\nFeinheimer's Cabaret held a unique place among the restaurants of the\ncity. Its patrons were from all classes of society. At noon its many\ntables were largely filled by staid and respectable business men, but at\nnight a certain element of the underworld claimed it as their own, and\nthere was always a sprinkling of people of the stage, artists, literary\nmen and politicians. It was, as a certain wit described it, a social\ngoulash, for in addition to its regular habitues there were those few\nwho came occasionally from the upper stratum of society in the belief\nthat they were doing something devilish. As a matter of fact, slumming\nparties which began and ended at Feinheimer's were of no uncommon\noccurrence, and as the place was more than usually orderly it was with\nthe greatest safety that society made excursions into the underworld of\ncrime and vice through its medium.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nAT FEINHEIMER'S.\n\nFeinheimer liked Jimmy's appearance.  He was big and strong, and the\nfact that Feinheimer always retained one or two powerful men upon his\npayroll accounted in a large measure for the orderliness of his place.\nOccasionally one might start something at Feinheimer's, but no one was\never known to finish what he started.\n\nAnd so Jimmy found himself waiting upon table at a place that was both\nreputable and disreputable, serving business men at noon and criminals\nand the women of the underworld at night. In the weeks that he was there\nhe came to know many of the local celebrities in various walks of life,\nto know them at least by name. There was Steve Murray, the labor leader,\nwhom rumor said was one of Feinheimer's financial backers--a large man\nwith a loud voice and the table manners of a Duroc-Jersey. Jimmy took an\ninstinctive dislike to the man the first time that he saw him.\n\nAnd then there was Little Eva, whose real name was Edith.  She was a\ndemure looking little girl, who came in every afternoon at four o'clock\nfor her breakfast. She usually came to Jimmy's table when it was vacant,\nand at four o'clock she always ate alone. Later in the evening she would\ncome in again with a male escort, who was never twice the same.\n\n\"I wonder what's the matter with me?\" she said to Jimmy one day as he\nwas serving her breakfast. \"I'm getting awfully nervous.\"\n\n\"That's quite remarkable,\" said Jimmy.  \"I should think any one who\nsmoked as many cigarettes and drank as much whisky as you would have\nperfect nerves.\"\n\nThe girl laughed, a rather soft and mellow laugh.  \"I suppose I do hit\nit up a little strong,\" she said.\n\n\"Strong?\" exclaimed Jimmy.  \"Why, if I drank half what you do I'd be in\nthe Washingtonian Home in a week.\"\n\nShe looked at him quizzically for a moment, as she had looked at him\noften since he had gone to work for Feinheimer.\n\n\"You're a funny guy,\" she said.  \"I can't quite figure you out.  What\nare you doing here anyway?\"\n\n\"I never claimed to be much of a waiter,\" said Jimmy, \"but I didn't know\nI was so rotten that a regular customer of the place couldn't tell what\nI was trying to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on,\" she cried; \"I don't mean that.  These other hash-slingers\naround here look the part. Aside from that, about the only thing they\nknow how to do is roll a souse; but you're different.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"I am different.  My abilities are limited.  All I\ncan do is wait on table, while they have two accomplishments.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't have to tell me,\" said the girl.  \"I wasn't rubbering.  I\nwas just sort of interested in you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy.\n\nShe went on with her breakfast while Jimmy set up an adjoining table.\nPresently when he came to fill her water-glass she looked up at him\nagain.\n\n\"I like you, kid,\" she said.  \"You're not fresh.  You know what I am as\nwell as the rest of them, but you wait on me just the same as you would\non\"--she hesitated and there was a little catch in her voice as she\nfinished her sentence--\"just the same as you would on a decent girl.\"\n\nJimmy looked at her in surprise.  It was the first indication that he\nhad ever had from an habitue of Feinheimer's that there might lurk\nwithin their breasts any of the finer characteristics whose outward\nindices are pride and shame. He was momentarily at a loss as to what to\nsay, and as he hesitated the girl's gaze went past him and she\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Look who's here!\"\n\nJimmy turned to look at the newcomer, and saw the Lizard directly behind\nhim.\n\n\"Howdy, bo,\" said his benefactor.  \"I thought I'd come in and give you\nthe once-over. And here's Little Eva with a plate of ham and at four\no'clock in the afternoon.\"\n\nThe Lizard dropped into a chair at the table with the girl, and after\nJimmy had taken his order and departed for the kitchen Little Eva jerked\nher thumb toward his retreating figure.\n\n\"Friend of yours?\" she asked.\n\n\"He might have a worse friend,\" replied the Lizard non-committally.\n\n\"What's his graft?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"He ain't got none except being on the square.  It's funny,\" the Lizard\nphilosophized, \"but here's me with a bank roll that would choke a horse,\nand you probably with a stocking full of dough, and I'll bet all the\nmoney I ever had or ever expect to have if one of us could change places\nwith that poor simp we'd do it.\"\n\n\"He is a square guy, isn't he?\" said the girl.  \"You can almost tell it\nby looking at him. How did you come to know him?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a long story,\" said the Lizard.  \"We room at the same place,\nbut I knew him before that.\"\n\n\"On Indiana near Eighteenth?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"How the hell did you know?\" he queried.\n\n\"I know a lot of things I ain't supposed to know,\" replied she.\n\n\"You're a wise guy, all right, Eva, and one thing I like about you is\nthat you don't let anything you know hurt you.\"\n\nAnd then, after a pause: \"I like him,\" she said.  \"What's his name?\"\n\nThe Lizard eyed her for a moment.\n\n\"Don't you get to liking him too much,\" he said.  \"That bird's the class.\nHe ain't for any little--\"\n\n\"Cut it!\" exclaimed the girl.  \"I'm as good as you are and a damn\nstraighter. What I get I earn, and I don't steal it.\"\n\nThe Lizard grinned.  \"I guess you're right at that; but don't try to\npull him down any lower than he is. He is coming up again some day to\nwhere he belongs.\"\n\n\"I ain't going to try to pull him down,\" said the girl.  \"And anyhow,\nwhen were you made his godfather?\"\n\nJimmy saw Eva almost daily for many weeks.  He saw her at her\npost-meridian breakfast--sober and subdued; he saw her later in the\nevening, in various stages of exhilaration, but at those times she did\nnot come to his table and seldom if ever did he catch her eye.\n\nThey talked a great deal while she breakfasted, and he learned to like\nthe girl and to realize that she possessed two personalities. The one\nwhich he liked dominated her at breakfast; the other which he loathed\nguided her actions later in the evening. Neither of them ever referred\nto those hours of her life, and as the days passed Jimmy found himself\nlooking forward to the hour when Little Eva would come to Feinheimer's\nfor her breakfast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nCHRISTMAS EVE.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve.  Elizabeth Compton and Harriet Holden were\ncompleting the rounds of their friends' homes with Christmas\nremembrances--a custom that they had continued since childhood. The\nlast parcel had been delivered upon the South Side, and they were now\nbeing driven north on Michigan Boulevard toward home. Elizabeth directed\nthe chauffeur to turn over Van Buren to State, which at this season of\nthe year was almost alive with belated Christmas shoppers and those\nother thousands who always seize upon the slightest pretext for a\ncelebration.\n\nIt was a noisy, joyous crowd whose spirit, harmonizing with the bright\nlights and the gay shop windows, infected all who came within its\ninfluence. As the car moved slowly northward along the world's greatest\nretail street the girls leaned forward to watch the passing throng\nthrough the windows.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful,\" exclaimed Harriet, \"what a transformation a few\nlights make? Who would ever think of State Street as a fairy-land? And\nyet, if you half close your eyes the hallucination is complete. Even the\npeople who by daylight are shoddy and care-worn take on an appearance of\nromance and gaiety, and the tawdry colored lights are the scintillant\ngems of the garden of a fairy prince.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Elizabeth pleaded.  \"The city night always affects me.  It\nmakes me want to do something adventurous, and on Christmas Eve it is\neven worse. If you keep on like that I shall soon be telling David to\ndrive us up and down State Street all night.\"\n\n\"I wish we didn't have to go home right away,\" said Harriet.  \"I feel\nlike doing something devilish.\"\n\n\"Well, let's!\" exclaimed Elizabeth.\n\n\"Do something devilish?\" inquired Harriet. \"What, for instance?\"\n\n\"Oh, 'most anything that we shouldn't do,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and there\nisn't anything that we could do down here alone that we should do.\"\n\nThey both laughed.  \"I have it!\" exclaimed Elizabeth suddenly.  \"We'll\nbe utterly abandoned--we'll have supper at Feinheimer's without an\nescort.\"\n\nHarriet cast a horrified glance at her companion.  \"Why, Elizabeth\nCompton,\" she cried, \"you wouldn't dare. You know you wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"Do you dare me?\" asked the other.\n\n\"But suppose some one should see us?\" argued Harriet.  \"Your father\nwould never forgive us.\"\n\n\"If we see any one in Feinheimer's who knows us,\" argued Elizabeth\nshrewdly, \"they will be just as glad to forget it as we. And anyway it\nwill do it no harm. I shall have David stay right outside the door\nso that if I call him he can come. I don't know what I would do without\nDavid. He is a sort of Rock of Ages and Gibraltar all in one.\"\n\nThrough the speaking-tube Elizabeth directed David to drive to\nFeinheimer's, and, whatever David may have thought of the order, he gave\nno outward indication of it.\n\nChristmas Eve at Feinheimer's is, or was, a riot of unconfined hilarity,\nalthough the code of ethics of the place was on a higher plane than that\nwhich governed the Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve patrons of so-called\nrespectable restaurants, where a woman is not safe from insult even\nthough she be properly escorted, while in Feinheimer's a woman with an\nescort was studiously avoided by the other celebrators unless she chose\nto join with them. As there was only one class of women who came to\nFeinheimer's at night without escort, the male habitues had no\ndifficulty in determining who they might approach and who they might\nnot.\n\nJimmy Torrance was as busy as a cranberry merchant.  He had four tables\nto attend to, and while the amount of food he served grew more and more\nnegligible as the evening progressed, his trips to the bar were\nexceedingly frequent. One of his tables had been vacated for a few minutes\nwhen, upon his return from the bar with a round of drinks for Steve\nMurray and his party he saw that two women had entered and were\noccupying his fourth table. Their backs were toward him, and he gave\nthem but little attention other than to note that they were unescorted\nand to immediately catalogue them accordingly. Having distributed Steve\nMurray's order, Jimmy turned toward his new patrons, and, laying a menu\ncard before each, he stood between them waiting for their order.\n\n\"What shall we take?\" asked Elizabeth of Harriet.  Then: \"What have you\nthat's good?\" and she looked up at the waiter.\n\nJimmy prided himself upon self-control, and his serving at Feinheimer's\nhad still further schooled him in the repression of any outward\nindication of his emotions. For, as most men of his class, he had a\nwell-defined conception of what constituted a perfect waiter, one of the\nrequisites being utter indifference to any of the affairs of his patrons\noutside of those things which actually pertained to his duties as a\nservitor; but in this instance Jimmy realized that he had come very\nclose to revealing the astonishment which he felt on seeing this girl in\nFeinheimer's and unescorted.\n\nIf Jimmy was schooled in self-control, Elizabeth Compton was equally so.\nShe recognized the waiter immediately, but not even by a movement of an\neyelid did she betray the fact; which may possibly be accounted for by\nthe fact that it meant little more to her than as though she had chanced\nto see the same street-sweeper several times in succession, although\nafter he had left with their order she asked Harriet if she, too, had\nrecognized him.\n\n\"Immediately,\" replied her friend.  \"It doesn't seem possible that such\na good-looking chap should be occupying such a menial position.\"\n\n\"There must be something wrong with him,\" rejoined Elizabeth; \"probably\nutterly inefficient.\"\n\n\"Or he may have some vice,\" suggested Harriet.\n\n\"He doesn't look it,\" said Elizabeth.  \"He looks too utterly healthy for\nthat. We've seen some of these drug addicts in our own set, as you may\nreadily recall. No, I shouldn't say that he was that.\"\n\n\"I suppose the poor fellow has never had an opportunity,\" said Harriet.\n\"He has a good face, his eyes and forehead indicate intelligence, and\nhis jaw is strong and aggressive. Probably, though, he was raised in\npoverty and knows nothing better than what he is doing now. It is too\nbad that some of these poor creatures couldn't have the advantages of\nhigher education.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"it is too bad.  Take a man like that; with a\ncollege education he could attain almost any decree of success he\nchose.\"\n\n\"He certainly could,\" agreed Harriet; and then suddenly: \"Why, what's\nthe matter, Elizabeth? Your face is perfectly scarlet.\"\n\nThe other girl tapped the floor with the toe of one boot impatiently.\n\n\"That horrid creature at the next table just winked at me,\" she said\ndisgustedly.\n\nHarriet looked about in the direction her companion had indicated, to\nsee a large, overdressed man staring at them. There was a smirk on his\nface, and as Harriet caught his eye she saw him rise and, to her horror,\nrealized that he was advancing toward their table.\n\nHe stopped in front of them with his huge hands resting on the edge of\ntheir table and looked down at Elizabeth.\n\n\"Hello, kiddo!\" he said.  \"What are you going to drink?\"\n\nElizabeth gave the man one look such as would utterly have frozen a male\nfrom her own stratum of society, but it had as little effect upon Steve\nMurray's self-assurance as the cork from a popgun would have on the\narmored sides of a rhinoceros.\n\n\"All right,\" said the man, \"what's the use of asking?  There's only one\nthing when Steve Murray buys. Here, waiter,\" he yelled, pounding on the\ntable. The nearest waiter, who chanced not to be Jimmy, who was then in\nthe kitchen, came hurriedly forward. \"Open up some wine,\" commanded\nMurray. \"Come on, boys! Bring your chairs over here,\" he continued,\naddressing his companions; \"let's have a little party.\"\n\nElizabeth Compton rose.\n\n\"You will oblige me,\" she said, \"by leaving our table.\"\n\nSteve Murray laughed uproariously.  He had dropped into a chair next to\nhers.\n\n\"That's great!\" he cried. \"I guess you don't know who I am, kiddo.  You\nwon't cop off anything better in this joint than Steve Murray. Come\non--let's be friends. That's a good girl,\" and before Elizabeth\nrealized the man's intentions he had seized her wrist and pulled her\ndown into his lap.\n\nIt was this scene that broke upon Jimmy's view as he emerged from the\nkitchen with a laden tray. He saw Steve Murray seize the girl, and he\nsaw her struggling to free herself, and then there was a mighty crash as\nJimmy dropped the tray of steaming food upon the floor and ran quickly\nforward.\n\nMurray was endeavoring to draw the girl's lips to his as Jimmy's hand\nshot between their faces and pushed that of the man away. With his free\narm he encircled the girl's body and attempted to draw her from her\nassailant.\n\n\"Cut it, Murray!\" he commanded in a low tone of voice.  \"She isn't your\nsort.\"\n\n\"Who the hell are you?\" cried the labor leader, releasing the girl and\nrising to his feet. \"Get the hell out of here, you dirty hash-slinger!\nAny girl in this place belongs to me if I want her. There don't only one\nkind come in here without an escort, or with one, either, for that\nmatter. You get back on your job, where you belong,\" and the man pressed\nforward trying to push Jimmy aside and lay hands on Elizabeth again.\n\nJimmy did not strike him then.  He merely placed the palm of one hand\nagainst the man's breast and pushed him backward, but with such force\nthat, striking a chair, Steve Murray fell backward and sprawled upon the\nfloor. Scrambling to his feet, he rushed Jimmy like a mad bull.\n\nIn his younger days Murray had been a boiler-maker, and he still\nretained most of his great strength. He was a veritable mountain of a\nman, and now in the throes of a berserker rage he was a formidable\nopponent. His face was white and his lips were drawn back tightly,\nexposing his teeth in a bestial snarl as he charged at Jimmy. His great\narms and huge hands beat to the right and left like enormous flails, one\nblow from which might seemingly have felled an ox.\n\nTorrance had stood for a moment with an arm still around the girl; but\nas Murray rose to his feet he pushed her gently behind him, and then as\nthe man was upon him Jimmy ducked easily under the other's clumsy left\nand swung a heavy right hook to his jaw. As Murray staggered to the\nimpact of the blow Jimmy reached him again quickly and easily with a\nleft to the nose, from which a crimson burst spattered over the waiter\nand his victim. Murray went backward and would have fallen but for the\nfact he came in contact with one of his friends, and then he was at\nJimmy again.\n\nBy this time waiters and patrons were crowding forward from all parts of\nthe room, and Feinheimer, shrieking at the top of his voice, was\nendeavoring to worm his fat, toadlike body through the cordon of excited\nspectators. The proprietor reached the scene of carnage just in time to\nsee Jimmy plant a lovely left on the point of Murray's jaw.\n\nThe big man tottered drunkenly for an instant, his knees sagged, and, as\nJimmy stood in readiness for any eventuality, the other crashed heavily\nto the floor.\n\nTowering above the others in the room suddenly came a big young fellow\nshouldering his way through the crowd, a young man in the uniform of a\nchauffeur. Elizabeth saw him before he discovered her.\n\n\"Oh David!\" she cried.  \"Quick! Quick! Take us out of here!\"\n\nAs the chauffeur reached her side and took in the scene he jerked his\nhead toward Jimmy. \"Did any one hurt you miss?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she cried.  \"This man was very kind.  Just get us out of here,\nDavid, as quickly as you can.\" And, turning to Jimmy: \"How can I ever\nrepay you? If it hadn't been for you--oh, I hate to think what would\nhave happened. Come out to the car and give David your name and address,\nand I will send you something tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said Jimmy.  \"You just get out of here as quick\nas you can. If the police happened to look in now you might be held as a\nwitness.\"\n\n\"How utterly horrible!\" exclaimed Elizabeth.  \"Come, David! Come,\nHarriet!\" David making a way for her, she started for the door.\n\nHarriet paused long enough to extend her hand to Jimmy.  \"It was\nwonderfully brave of you,\" she said. \"We could never do enough to repay\nyou. My name is Harriet Holden,\" and she gave him an address on Lake\nShore Drive. \"If you will come Monday morning about ten o'clock,\" she\nsaid, \"I am sure that there is something we can do for you. If you want\na better position,\" she half suggested, \"I know my father could help,\nalthough he must never know about this to-night.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy, smiling.  \"It's awfully good of you, but you must\nhurry now. There goes your friend.\"\n\nFeinheimer stood as one dazed, looking down at the bulk of his friend\nand associate.\n\n\"Mein Gott!\" he cried. \"What kind of a place you think I run, young\nman?\" He turned angrily on Jimmy. \"What you think I hire you for? To\nbeat up my best customer?\"\n\n\"He got what was coming to him,\" said a soft feminine voice at Jimmy's\nelbow. The man looked to see Little Eva standing at his side. \"I didn't\nthink anybody could do that to Murray,\" she continued. \"Lord, but it was\npretty. He's had it coming to him ever since I've known him, but the big\nstiff had everybody around this joint buffaloed. He got away with\nanything he started.\"\n\nFeinheimer looked at Little Eva disgustedly.\n\n\"He's my best customer,\" he cried, \"and a bum waiter comes along and\nbeats him up just when he is trying to have a little innocent sport on\nChristmas Eve. You take off your apron, young man, and get your time. I\nwon't have no rough stuff in Feinheimer's.\"\n\nJimmy shrugged his shoulders and grinned.\n\n\"Shouldn't I wait to see if I can't do something more for Mr. Murray?\"\nhe suggested.\n\n\"You get out of here!\" cried Feinheimer, \"Get out of here or I'll call\nthe police.\"\n\nJimmy laughed and took off his apron  as he walked back to the servants'\ncoat-room. As he emerged again and crossed through the dining-room he\nsaw that Murray had regained consciousness and was sitting at a table\nwiping the blood from his face with a wet napkin. As Murray's eyes fell\nupon his late antagonist he half rose from his chair and shook his fist\nat Jimmy.\n\n\"I'll get you for this, young feller!\" he yelled.  \"I'll get you yet,\nand don't you forget it.\"\n\n\"You just had me,\" Jimmy called back; \"but it didn't seem to make you\nvery happy.\"\n\nHe could still hear Murray fuming and cursing as he passed out into the\nbarroom, at the front of which was Feinheimer's office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nUP OR DOWN?\n\nAfter Jimmy had received his check and was about to leave, a couple of\nmen approached him.\n\n\"We seen that little mix-up in there,\" said one of them.  \"You handle\nyour mitts like you been there before.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, smiling, \"I've had a little experience in the manly\nart of self-defense.\"\n\nThe two men were sizing him up.\n\n\"Feinheimer can you?\" asked one of them.  Jimmy nodded affirmatively.\n\"Got anything else in view?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"How'd you like a job as one of Brophy's sparring partners?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" said Jimmy.  \"What is there in it?\"\n\nThey named a figure that was entirely satisfactory to Jimmy.\n\n\"Come over the day after Christmas,\" he was told, \"and we'll give you a\ntrial.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" thought Jimmy as he started for home, \"if I have gone up a\nnotch in the social scale or down a notch? From the view-point of the\nunderworld a pug occupies a more exalted position than a waiter; but--\noh, well, a job's a job, and at least I won't have to look at that\ngreasy Feinheimer all day.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock Monday Jimmy was at Young Brophy's training quarters,\nfor, although he had not forgotten Harriet Holden's invitation, he had\nnever seriously considered availing himself of her offer to help him to\na better position. While he had not found it difficult to accept the\nrough friendship and assistance of the Lizard, the idea of becoming an\nobject of \"charity,\" as he considered it, at the hands of a girl in the\nsame walk of life as that to which he belonged was intolerable.\n\nYoung Brophy's manager, whom Jimmy discovered to be one of the men who\nhad accosted him in Feinheimer's after his trouble with Murray, took him\ninto a private office and talked with him confidentially for a half-hour\nbefore he was definitely employed.\n\nIt seemed that one of the principal requisites of the position was a\nwillingness to take punishment without attempting to inflict too much\nupon Young Brophy. The manager did not go into specific details as to\nthe reason for this restriction, and Jimmy, badly in need of a job, felt\nno particular inclination to search too deeply for the root of the\nmatter.\n\n\"What I don't know,\" he soliloquized, \"won't hurt me any.\" But he had\nnot been there many days before the piecing together of chance remarks\nand the gossip of the hangers-on and other sparring partners made it\nvery apparent why Brophy should not be badly man-handled. As it finally\nrevealed itself to Jimmy it was very simple indeed. Brophy was to be\npitted against a man whom he had already out-pointed in a former bout.\nHe was the ruling favorite in the betting, and it was the intention to\nkeep him so while he and his backers quietly placed all their money on\nthe other man.\n\nOne of the sparring partners who seemed to harbor a petty grudge against\nBrophy finally explained the whole plan to Jimmy. Everything was to be\ndone to carry the impression to the public through the newspapers, who\nwere usually well represented at the training quarters, that Brophy was\nin the pink of condition; that he was training hard; that it was\nimpossible to find men who could stand up to him on account of the\nterrific punishment he inflicted upon his sparring partners; and that\nthe result of the fight was already a foregone conclusion; and then in\nthe third round Young Brophy was to lie down and by reclining peacefully\non his stomach for ten seconds make more money than several years of\nhard and conscientious work earnestly performed could ever net him.\n\nIt was all very, very simple; but how easily public opinion might be\nchanged should one of the sparring partners really make a good stand\nagainst Brophy in the presence of members of the newspaper fraternity!\n\n\"I see,\" said Jimmy, running his fingers through his hair.  \"Oh, well,\nit's none of my business, and if the suckers want to bet their money on\na prize-fight they're about due to lose it anyway.\"\n\nAnd so he continued permitting himself to be battered up four or five\ntimes a week at the hands of the pussy Mr. Brophy. He paid back the\ntwenty the Lizard had loaned him, got his watch out of pawn, and was\neven figuring on a new suit of clothes. Never before in his life had\nJimmy realized what it meant to be prosperous, since for obvious reasons\nYoung Brophy's manager was extremely liberal in the matter of salaries\nwith all those connected with the training-camp.\n\nAt first it had been rather humiliating to Jimmy to take the drubbings\nhe did at the hands of Young Brophy in the presence of the audience\nwhich usually filled the small gymnasium where the fighter was training.\nIt was nearly always about the same crowd, however, made up of\ndyed-in-the-wool fans, a few newspaper men, and a sprinkling of\nthrill-seekers from other walks of life far removed from the prize-ring.\nJimmy often noticed women among the spectators--well-dressed women,\nwith every appearance of refinement, and there were always men of the\nsame upper class of society.\n\nHe mentioned the fact once to the same young man who had previously\nexplained the plan under which the fight was to be faked.\n\n\"That's just part of the graft,\" said his informant.  \"These birds have\ngot next to a bunch of would-be sports with more money than brains\nthrough the athletic director of--\" he mentioned the name of one of\nthe big athletic clubs--\"and they been inviting 'em here to watch\nBrophy training. Every one of the simps will be tryin' to get money down\non Brophy, and this bunch will take it all up as fast as they come.\n\n\"The bettin' hasn't really started yet; in fact, they are holding off\nthemselves until the odds are better. If Brophy goes into the ring a\nthree-to-one favorite these fellows will make a killing that will be\ntalked of for the next twenty years.\"\n\n\"And incidentally give boxing another black eye,\" interjected Jimmy.\n\n\"Oh, what the hell do we care?\" said the other. \"I'm goin' to make mine\nout of it, and you better do the same. I'm goin' to put up every cent I\ncan borrow or steal on the other guy.\"\n\nIt was Saturday, the 15th of January, just a week before the fight, that\nJimmy, trained now almost to perfection, stepped into the ring to take\nhis usual mauling. For some time past there had been insidiously working\nits way into his mind a vast contempt for the pugilistic prowess of\nYoung Brophy.\n\n\"If,\" thought Jimmy, \"this bird is of championship caliber, I might be a\nchampion myself.\" For, though Young Brophy was not a champion, the\nnewspapers had been pointing to him for some time as a likely possibility for\nthese pugilistic honors later.\n\nAs this mental attitude grew within him and took hold of Jimmy it more\nand more irked him to take the punishment which he inwardly felt he\ncould easily inflict upon Brophy instead, but, as Jimmy had learned\nthrough lean and hungry months, a job is a job, and no job is to be\nsneezed at or lightly thrown aside.\n\nThere was quite a gathering that afternoon to watch Young Brophy's\nwork-out, and rather a larger representation than usual from society's\nyounger set. The program, which had consisted in part of shadow boxing\nand bag punching by Young Brophy, was to terminate with three rounds\nwith Jimmy.\n\nFor two rounds the young man had permitted Brophy to make a monkey of\nhim, hitting him where he would at will, while Jimmy, as a result of\nseveral weeks of diligent practice, was able to put up apparently a very\nferocious attempt to annihilate his opponent without doing the latter\nany material damage.\n\nAt the close of the second round Brophy landed a particularly vicious\nright, which dropped Jimmy to the canvas. The crowd applauded\nvociferously, and as the gong sounded as Jimmy was slowly rising to his\nfeet they were all assured that it was all that had saved the young man\nfrom an even worse thrashing.\n\nAs Jimmy returned to his corner there arose within him a determination\nto thrash Young Brophy within an inch of his life after the big fight\nwas out of the way and Jimmy no longer bound by any obligations, for he\nrealized that for some reason Brophy had just gone a little too far with\nhis rough tactics, there having been in the arrangement with the\nsparring partners an understanding that when a knock-down was to be\nstaged Brophy was to give his opponent the cue. No cue had been given,\nhowever. Jimmy had not been expecting it, and he had been floored with a\npunch behind which were all the weight and brawn of the pugilist.\n\nHe had long since ceased to consider what the spectators might think.\nSo far as Jimmy was concerned, they might have been so many chairs. He\nwas merely angry at the unnecessary punishment that had been inflicted.\nAs he sprawled in his corner he let his eyes run over the faces of the\nspectators directly in front of him, to whom previously he had paid no\nparticular attention, and even now it was scarcely more than an\ninvoluntary glance; but his eyes stopped suddenly upon a face, and as\nrecognition suddenly dawned upon him he could feel the hot blood rushing\nto his own. For there was the girl whom Fate had thrice before thrown in\nhis path! Beside her he recognized the Miss Harriet Holden who had been\nwith her the night at Feinheimer's, and with them were two young men.\n\nSomething within Jimmy Torrance rebelled to a point where it utterly\ndominated him--rebelled at the thought that this girl, whom he had\nunconsciously set upon a pedestal to worship from afar, should always\nfind him in some menial and humiliating position. It was bad enough that\nshe should see him as a sparring partner of a professional pug, but it\nmade it infinitely worse that she should see him as what he must appear,\nan unsuccessful third or fourth rate fighter.\n\nEverything within Jimmy's mind turned suddenly topsyturvy.  He seemed to\nlose all sense of proportion and all sense of value in one overpowering\nthought, that he must not again be humiliated in her presence.\n\nAnd so it was that at the tap of the gong for the third round it was not\nTorrance the sparring partner that advanced from his corner, but Jimmy\nTorrance, champion heavyweight boxer of a certain famous university. But\nwhy enter into the harrowing details of the ensuing minute and a half?\n\nIn thirty seconds it was unquestionably apparent to every one in the\nroom, including Young Brophy himself, that the latter was pitifully\noutclassed. Jimmy hit him whenever and wherever he elected to hit, and\nhe hit him hard, while Brophy, at best only a second or third rate\nfighter, pussy and undertrained, was not only unable to elude the blows\nof his adversary but equally so to land effectively himself.\n\nAnd there before the eyes of half a dozen newspaper reporters, of a\ndozen wealthy young men who had fully intended to place large sums on\nBrophy, and before the eyes of his horrified manager and backer, Jimmy,\nat the end of ninety seconds, landed a punch that sent the flabby Mr.\nBrophy through the ropes and into dreamland for a much longer period\nthan the requisite ten seconds.\n\nBefore Jimmy got dressed and out of the gymnasium he, with difficulty,\nescaped a half-dozen more fistic encounters, as everybody from the\nmanager down felt that his crime deserved nothing short of capital\npunishment. He had absolutely wrecked a perfectly good scheme in the\nperfection of which several thousand dollars had been spent, and now\nthere could not be even the possibility of a chance of their breaking\neven.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nHARRIET PHILOSOPHIZES.\n\nWhen Jimmy got home that night he saw a light in the Lizard's room and\nentered.\n\n\"Well,\" said the cracksman, \"how's every little thing?\"\n\nJimmy smiled ruefully.\n\n\"Canned again,\" he announced, and then he told the Lizard the story of\nhis downfall, attributing the results of the third round, however, to\nBrophy's unwarranted action at the end of the second.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Lizard, \"you certainly are the champion boob.  There\nyou had a chance to cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and\ninstead you kill it for yourself and everybody else.\"\n\n\"You don't think,\" said Jimmy, \"that I would have put any money on that\ncrooked scrap.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the Lizard, and then he shook his head sadly.  \"No, I\ndon't suppose you would. There's lots of things about you that I can't\nunderstand, and one of them is the fact that you would rather starve to\ndeath than take a little easy money off of birds that have got more than\nthey got any business to have. Why, with your education and front we two\ncould pull off some of the classiest stuff that this burg ever saw.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" admonished Jimmy.\n\n\"What are you going to do now?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"Go out and hunt for another job,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Well, I wish you luck,\" said the Lizard.\n\n\"Maybe I can find something for you.  I'll try, and in the mean time if\nyou need any mazuma I always got a little roll tucked away in my sock.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy, \"and I don't mind telling you that you're the one\nman I know whom I'd just as soon borrow from and would like the\nopportunity of loaning to. You say that you can't understand me, and yet\nyou're a whole lot more of an enigma yourself! You admit, in fact,\nyou're inclined to boast, that you're a pickpocket and a safe-blower and\nyet I'd trust you, Lizard, with anything that I had.\"\n\nThe Lizard smiled, and for the first time since he had known him Jimmy\nnoticed that his eyes smiled with his lips.\n\n\"I've always had the reputation,\" said the Lizard, \"of being a white guy\nwith my friends. As a matter of fact, I ain't no different from what\nyou'd probably be if you were in business and what most of your friends\nare. Morally they're a bunch of thieves and crooks. Of course, they\ndon't go out and frisk any one and they don't work with a jimmy or a\nbottle of soup. They work their graft with the help of contracts and\nlawyers, and they'd gyp a friend or a pauper almost as soon as they\nwould an enemy. I don't know much about morality, but when it comes\nright down to a question of morals I believe my trade is just as decent\nas that of a lot of these birds you see rolling up and down Mich Boul in\ntheir limousines.\"\n\n\"It's all in the point of view,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Lizard.  \"It's all in the point of view, and my point of\nview ain't warped by no college education.\"\n\nJimmy grinned.  \"Eventually, Lizard, you may win me over; but when you\ndo why fritter away our abilities upon this simple village when we have\nthe capitals of all Europe to play around in?\"\n\n\"There's something in that,\" said the Lizard; \"but don't get it into\nyour head for a minute that I am tryin' to drag you from the straight\nand narrow. I think I like you better the way you are.\"\n\n\"Did you ever,\" said Harriet Holden, \"see anything so weird as the way\nwe keep bumping into that stocking-counter young man?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Elizabeth, \"it's commencing to get on my nerves.  Every time\nI turn a corner now I expect to bump into him. I suppose we see other\npeople many times without recognizing them, but he is so utterly\ngood-looking that he sort of sticks in one's memory.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Harriet, \"that I have a suspicion that he recognized\nus. I saw him looking up at us just after that other person knocked him\ndown and I could have sworn that he blushed. And then, you know, he went\nin and was entirely different from what he had been in the two preceding\nrounds. Billy said that he is really a wonderful fighter, and there are\nnot very many good fights that Billy misses. What in the world do you\nsuppose his profession is anyway? Since we first noticed him he has been\na hosiery clerk, a waiter, and a prize-fighter.\"\n\n\"I don't know, I am sure,\" said Elizabeth, yawning.  \"You seem to be\nterribly interested in him.\"\n\n\"I am,\" admitted Harriet frankly.  \"He's a regular adventure all in\nhimself--a whole series of adventures.\"\n\n\"I've never been partial to serials,\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Well, I should think one would be a relief after a whole winter of\nheavy tragedy,\" retorted Harriet.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"Oh, I mean Harold, of course,\" said Harriet.  \"He's gone around all\nwinter with a grouch and a face a mile long. What's the matter with him\nanyway?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" sighed Elizabeth.  \"I'm afraid he's working too hard.\"\n\nHarriet giggled.\n\n\"Oh, fiddlesticks!\" she exclaimed.  \"You know perfectly well that\nHarold Bince will never work himself to death.\"\n\n\"Well, he is working hard, Harriet.  Father says so.  And he's worrying\nabout the business, too. He's trying so hard to make good.\"\n\n\"I will admit that he has stuck to his job more faithfully than anybody\nexpected him to.\"\n\nElizabeth turned slowly upon her friend, \"You don't like Harold,\" she\nsaid; \"why is it?\"\n\nHarriet shook her head.\n\n\"I do like him, Elizabeth, for your sake.  I suppose the trouble is that\nI realize that he is not good enough for you. I have known him all my\nlife, and even as a little child he was never sincere. Possibly he has\nchanged now. I hope so. And then again I know as well as you do that you\nare not in love with him.\"\n\n\"How perfectly ridiculous!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"Do you suppose that I\nwould marry a man whom I didn't love?\"\n\n\"You haven't the remotest idea what love is.  You've never been in\nlove.\"\n\n\"Have you?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"No,\" replied Harriet, \"I haven't, but I know the symptoms and you\ncertainly haven't got one of them. Whenever Harold isn't going to be up\nfor dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't\nrealize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you.\"\n\n\"Well, I do love him,\" insisted Elizabeth, \"and I intend to marry him.\nI never had any patience with this silly, love-sick business that\nrequires people to pine away when they are not together and bore\neverybody else to death when they were.\"\n\n\"All of which proves,\" said Harriet, \"that you haven't been stung yet,\nand I sincerely hope that you may never be unless it happens before you\nmarry Harold.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nIN AGAIN--OUT AGAIN.\n\nJimmy Torrance was out of a job a week this time, and once more he was\nindebted to the Lizard for a position, the latter knowing a politician\nwho was heavily interested in a dairy company, with the result that\nJimmy presently found himself driving a milk-wagon. Jimmy's route was on\nthe north side, which he regretted, as it was in the district where a\nnumber of the friends of his former life resided. His delivery schedule,\nhowever, and the fact that his point of contact with the homes of his\ncustomers was at the back door relieved him of any considerable\napprehension of being discovered by an acquaintance.\n\nHis letters home were infrequent, for he found that his powers of\ninvention were being rapidly depleted. It was difficult to write glowing\naccounts of the business success he was upon the point of achieving on\nthe strength of any of the positions he so far had held, and doubly so\nduring the far greater period that he had been jobless and hungry. But\nhe had not been able to bring himself to the point of admitting to his\nfamily his long weeks of consistent and unrelieved failure.\n\nRecently he had abandoned his futile attempts to obtain positions\nthrough the medium of the Help Wanted columns.\n\n\"It is no use,\" he thought.  \"There must be something inherently wrong\nwith me that in a city full of jobs I am unable to land anything without\nsome sort of a pull and then only work that any unskilled laborer could\nperform.\"\n\nThe truth of the matter was that Jimmy Torrance was slowly approaching\nthat mental condition that is aptly described by the phrase, \"losing\nyour grip,\" one of the symptoms of which was the fact that he was almost\ncontented with his present job.\n\nHe had driven for about a week when, upon coming into the barn after\ncompleting his morning delivery, he was instructed to take a special\norder to a certain address on Lake Shore Drive. Although the address was\nnot that of one of his regular customers he felt that there was\nsomething vaguely familiar about it, but when he finally arrived he\nrealized that it was a residence at which he had never before called.\n\nDriving up the alley Jimmy stopped in the rear of a large and\npretentious home, and entering through a gateway in a high stone wall he\nsaw that the walk to the rear entrance bordered a very delightful\ngarden. He realized what a wonderfully pretty little spot it must be in\nthe summer time, with its pool and fountain and tree-shaded benches, its\nvine-covered walls and artistically arranged shrubs, and it recalled to\nJimmy with an accompanying sigh the homes in which he had visited in\nwhat seemed now a remote past, and also of his own home in the West.\n\nOn the alley in one corner of the property stood a garage and stable, in\nwhich Jimmy could see men working upon the owner's cars and about the\nbox-stalls of his saddle horses. At the sight of the horses Jimmy heaved\nanother sigh as he continued his way to the rear entrance. As he stood\nwaiting for a reply to his summons he glanced back at the stable to see\nthat horses had just entered and that their riders were dismounting,\nevidently two of the women of the household, and then a houseman opened\nthe door and Jimmy made his delivery and started to retrace his steps to\nhis wagon.\n\nApproaching him along the walk from the stable were the riders--two\nyoung women, laughing and talking as they approached the house, and\nsuddenly Jimmy, in his neat white suit, carrying his little tray of\nmilk-bottles, recognized them, and instantly there flashed into\nrecollection the address that Harriet Holden had given him that night at\nFeinheimer's.\n\n\"What infernal luck,\" he groaned inwardly; \"I suppose the next time I\nsee that girl I'll be collecting garbage from her back door.\" And then,\nwith his eyes straight to the front, he stepped aside to let the two\npass.\n\nIt was Harriet Holden who recognized him first, and stopped with a\nlittle exclamation of surprise. Jimmy stopped, too. There was nothing\nelse that a gentleman might do, although he would have given his right\nhand to have been out of the yard.\n\n\"You never came to the house as I asked you to,\" said Miss Holden\nreproachfully. \"We wanted so much to do something to repay you for your\nprotection that night.\"\n\n\"There was no use in my coming,\" said Jimmy, \"for, you see, I couldn't\nhave accepted anything for what I did--I couldn't very well have done\nanything else, could I, under the circumstances?\"\n\n\"There were many other men in the place,\" replied Harriet, \"but you were\nthe only one who came to our help.\"\n\n\"But the others were not---\" Jimmy been upon the point of saying\ngentlemen, but then he happened to think that in the eyes of these two\ngirls, and according to their standard, he might not be a gentleman,\neither. \"Well, you see,\" he continued lamely, \"they probably didn't know\nwho you were.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"No,\" Jimmy admitted, \"of course, I didn't know who you were, but I knew\nwhat you were not, which was the thing that counted most then.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Harriet, \"that you would let us do something for you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"if a hundred dollars would be of any use to\nyou--\" Harriet laid a hand quickly on her friend's arm.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of money,\" she said to Jimmy.  \"One can't pay for\nthings like that with money, but we know so many people here we might\nhelp you in some way, if you are not entirely satisfied with your\npresent position.\"\n\nOut of the corner of his eye Jimmy could not help but note that\nElizabeth was appraising him critically from head to foot and he felt\nthat he could almost read what was passing through her mind as she took\nstock of his cheap cotton uniform and his cap, with the badge of his\nemployer above the vizor. Involuntarily Jimmy straightened his shoulders\nand raised his chin a trifle.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" he said to Harriet, \"it is kind of you, but really I am\nperfectly satisfied with my present job. It is by far the best one I\nhave ever held,\" and touching his cap, he continued his interrupted way\nto his wagon.\n\n\"What a strange young man,\" exclaimed Harriet. \"He is like many of his\nclass,\" replied Elizabeth, \"probably entirely without ambition and with\nno desire to work any too hard or to assume additional\nresponsibilities.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" retorted Harriet.  \"Unless I am greatly mistaken,\nthat man is a gentleman. Everything about him indicates it; his\ninflection even is that of a well-bred man.\"\n\n\"How utterly silly,\" exclaimed Elizabeth.  \"You've heard him speak\nscarcely a dozen words. I venture to say that in a fifteen-minute\nconversation he would commit more horrible crimes against the king's\nEnglish than even that new stable-boy of yours. Really, Harriet, you\nseem very much interested in this person.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" asked Harriet.  \"He's becoming my little pet\nmystery. I wonder under what circumstances we see him next?\"\n\n\"Probably as a white-wings,\" laughed Elizabeth.  \"But if so I positively\nrefuse to permit you to stop in the middle of Michigan Boulevard and\nconverse with a street-sweeper while I'm with you.\"\n\nJimmy's new job lasted two weeks, and then the milk-wagon drivers went\non strike and Jimmy was thrown out of employment.\n\n\"Tough luck,\" sympathized the Lizard.  \"You sure are the Calamity Kid.\nBut don't worry, we'll land you something else. And remember that that\npartnership proposition is still open.\"\n\nThere ensued another month of idleness, during which Jimmy again had\nrecourse to the Help Wanted column. The Lizard tried during the first\nweek to find something for him, and then occurred a certain very famous\nsafe-robbery, and the Lizard disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nLITTLE  EVA.\n\nEarly in March Jimmy was again forced to part with his watch.  As he was\ncoming out of the pawn-shop late in the afternoon he almost collided\nwith Little Eva.\n\n\"For the love of Mike!\" cried that young lady, \"where have you been all\nthis time, and what's happened to you? You look as though you'd lost\nyour last friend.\" And then noting the shop from which he had emerged\nand the deduction being all too obvious, she laid one of her shapely\nhands upon the sleeve of his cheap, ill-fitting coat. \"You're up against\nit, kid, ain't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" said Jimmy ruefully. \"I'm getting used to it.\"\n\n\"I guess you're too square,\" said the girl. \"I heard about that Brophy\nbusiness.\" And then she laughed softly. \"Do you know who the biggest\nbackers of that graft were?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Well, don't laugh yourself to death,\" she admonished. \"They were Steve\nMurray and Feinheimer. Talk about sore pups! You never saw anything like\nit, and when they found who it was that had ditched their wonderful\nscheme they threw another fit. Say, those birds have been weeping on\neach other's shoulders ever since.\"\n\n\"Do you still breakfast at Feinheimer's?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Once in a while,\" said the girl, \"but not so often now.\"  And she\ndropped her eyes to the ground in what, in another than Little Eva,\nmight have been construed as embarrassment. \"Where you going now?\" she\nasked quickly.\n\n\"To eat,\" said Jimmy, and then prompted by the instincts of his earlier\ntraining and without appreciable pause: \"Won't you take dinner with me?\"\n\"No,\" said the girl, \"but you are going to take dinner with me. You're\nout of a job and broke, and the chances are you've just this minute\nhocked your watch, while I have plenty of money. No,\" she said as Jimmy\nstarted to protest, \"this is going to be on me. I never knew how much I\nenjoyed talking with you at breakfast until after you had left\nFeinheimer's. I've been real lonesome ever since,\" she admitted frankly.\n\"You talk to me different from what the other men do.\" She pressed his\narm gently. \"You talk to me, kid, just like a fellow might talk to his\nsister.\"\n\nJimmy didn't know just what rejoinder to make, and so he made none.  As\na matter of fact, he had not realized that he had said or done anything\nto win her confidence, nor could he explain his attitude toward her in\nthe light of what he knew of her life and vocation. There is a type of\nman that respects and reveres woman-hood for those inherent virtues\nwhich are supposed to be the natural attributes of the sex because in\ntheir childhood they have seen them exemplified in their mothers, their\nsisters and in the majority of women and girls who were parts of the\nnatural environment of their early lives.\n\nIt is difficult ever entirely to shatter the faith of such men, and\nhowever they may be wronged by individuals of the opposite sex their\nsubjective attitude toward woman in the abstract is one of chivalrous\nrespect. As far as outward appearances were concerned Little Eva might\nhave passed readily as a paragon of all the virtues. As yet, there was\nno sign nor line of dissipation marked upon her piquant face, nor in her\nconsociation with Jimmy was there ever the slightest reference to or\nreminder of her vocation.\n\nThey chose a quiet and eminently respectable dining place, and after\nthey had ordered, Jimmy spread upon the table an evening paper he had\npurchased upon the street.\n\n\"Help me find a job,\" he said to the girl, and together the two ran\nthrough the want columns.\n\n\"Here's a bunch of them,\" cried the girl laughingly, \"all in one ad.\nNight cook, one hundred and fifty dollars; swing man, one hundred and\nforty dollars; roast cook, one hundred and twenty dollars; broiler, one\nhundred and twenty dollars. I'd better apply for that. Fry cook, one\nhundred and ten dollars. Oh, here's something for Steve Murray: chicken\nbutcher, eighty dollars; here's a job I'd like,\" she cried, \"ice-cream\nman, one hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Quit your kidding,\" said Jimmy.  \"I'm looking for a job, not an\nacrostic.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"here are two solid pages of them, but nobody seems to\nwant a waiter. What else can you do?\" she asked smiling up at him.\n\n\"I can drive a milk-wagon,\" said Jimmy, \"but the drivers are all on\nstrike.\"\n\n\"Now, be serious,\" she announced. \"Let's look for something really good.\nHere's somebody wants a finishing superintendent for a string music\ninstrument factory, and a business manager and electrical engineer in\nthis one. What's an efficiency expert?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a fellow who gums up the works, puts you three weeks behind in\nless than a week and has all your best men resigning inside of a month.\nI know, because my dad had one at his plant a few years ago.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him for a moment. \"Your father is a business man?\"\nshe asked, and without waiting for an answer, \"Why don't you work for\nhim?\"\n\nIt was the first reference that Jimmy had ever made to his connections\nor his past.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"he's a long way off and--if I'm no good to any one here\nI certainly wouldn't be any good to him.\"\n\nHis companion made no comment, but resumed her reading of the\nadvertisement before her:\n\n\n\n            WANTED, an Efficiency Expert--Machine works\n            wants man capable of thoroughly reorganizing large\n            business along modern lines, stopping leaks and\n            systematizing every activity.

Ask for\n            Mr. Compton.\n\n\n\n\"What do you have to know to be an efficiency expert?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"From what I saw of the bird I just mentioned the less one knows about\nanything the more successful he should be as an efficiency expert, for\nhe certainly didn't know anything. And yet the results from kicking\neverybody in the plant out of his own particular rut eventually worked\nwonders for the organization. If the man had had any sense, tact or\ndiplomacy nothing would have been accomplished.\"\n\n\"Why don't you try it?\" asked the girl.\n\nJimmy looked at her with a quizzical smile.  \"Thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean it that way,\" she cried.  \"But from what you tell me\nI imagine that all a man needs is a front and plenty of punch. You've\ngot the front all right with your looks and gift of gab, and I leave it\nto Young Brophy if you haven't got the punch.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's not the punch an efficiency expert needs,\" suggested\nJimmy.\n\n\"It might be a good thing to have up his sleeve,\" replied the girl, and\nthen suddenly, \"do you believe in hunches?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"Well, this is a hunch, take it from me,\" she continued. \"I'll bet you\ncan land that job and make good.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she replied, \"but you know what a woman's intuition is.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Jimmy, \"that it's the feminine of hunch. But however\ngood your hunch or intuition may be it would certainly get a terrible\njolt if I presented myself to the head of the International Machine\nCompany in this scenery. Do you see anything about my clothes that\nindicates efficiency?\"\n\n\"It isn't your clothes that count, Jimmy,\" she said, \"it's the\ncombination of that face of yours and what you've got in your head.\nYou're the most efficient looking person I ever saw, and if you want a\nreference I'll say this much for you, you're the most efficient waiter\nthat Feinheimer ever had. He said so himself, even after he canned you.\"\n\n\"Your enthusiasm,\" said Jimmy, \"is contagious.  If it wasn't for these\nsorry rags of mine I'd take a chance on that hunch of yours.\"\n\nThe girl laid her hand impulsively upon his.\n\n\"Won't you let me help you?\" she asked. \"I'd like to, and it will only\nbe a loan if you wanted to look at it that way. Enough to get you a\ndecent-looking outfit, such an outfit as you ought to have to land a\ngood job. I know, and everybody else knows, that clothes do count no\nmatter what we say to the contrary. I'll bet you're some looker when\nyou're dolled up! Please,\" she continued, \"just try it for a gamble?\"\n\n\"I don't see how I can,\" he objected.  \"The chances are I could never\npay you back, and there is no reason in the world why you should loan me\nmoney. You are certainly under no obligation to me.\"\n\n\"I wish you would let me, Jimmy,\" she said. \"It would make me awfully\nhappy!\"\n\nThe man hesitated.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I'm going to do it, anyway. Wait a minute,\" and,\nrising, she left the table.\n\nIn a few minutes she returned. \"Here,\" she said, \"you've got to take\nit,\" and extended her hand toward him beneath the edge of the table. \"I\ncan't,\" said Jimmy. \"It wouldn't be right.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him and flushed.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" she said, \"because it's my--because of what I am?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Jimmy; \"please don't think that!\"  And impulsively he\ntook her hand beneath the table. At the contact the girl caught her\nbreath with a little quick-drawn sigh.\n\n\"Here, take it!\" she said, and drawing her hand away quickly, left a\nroll of bills in Jimmy's hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nJIMMY THROWS A BLUFF.\n\nThat afternoon Mr. Harold Bince had entered his superior's office with\nan afternoon paper in his hand.\n\n\"What's the idea of this ad, Mr. Compton?\" he asked.  \"Why do we need an\nefficiency expert? I wish you had let me know what you intended doing.\"\n\n\"I knew that if I told you, Harold, you would object,\" said the older\nman, \"and I thought I would have a talk with several applicants before\nsaying anything about it to any one. Of course, whoever we get will work\nwith you, but I would rather not have it generally known about the\nplant. There seems to be a leak somewhere and evidently we are too close\nto the work to see it ourselves. It will require an outsider to discover\nit.\"\n\n\"I am very much opposed to the idea,\" said Bince. \"These fellows usually\ndo nothing more than disrupt an organization. We have a force that has\nbeen here, many of them, for years. There is as little lost motion in\nthis plant as in any in the country, and if we start in saddling these\nmen with a lot of red tape which will necessitate their filling out\ninnumerable forms for every job, about half their time will be spent in\nbookkeeping, which can just as well be done here in the office as it is\nnow. I hope that you will reconsider your intention and let us work out\nour own solution in a practical manner, which we can do better in the\nlight of our own experience than can an outsider who knows nothing of\nour peculiar problems.\"\n\n\"We will not permit the organization to be disrupted,\" replied Mr.\nCompton. \"It may do a lot of good to get a new angle on our problems and\nat least it will do no harm.\"\n\n\"I can't agree with you,\" replied Bince.  \"I think it will do a lot of\nharm.\"\n\nCompton looked at his watch.  \"It is getting late, Harold,\" he said,\n\"and this is pay-day. I should think Everett could help you with the\npay-roll.\" Everett was the cashier.\n\n\"I prefer to do it myself,\" replied Bince.  \"Everett has about all he\ncan do, and anyway, I don't like to trust it to any one else.\" And\nrealizing that Compton did not care to discuss the matter of the\nefficiency expert further Bince returned to his own office.\n\nThe following afternoon the office boy entered Mr. Compton's office. \"A\ngentleman to see you, sir,\" he announced. \"He said to tell you that he\ncame in reply to your advertisement.\"\n\n\"Show him in,\" instructed Compton, and a moment later Jimmy entered--a\nrehabilitated Jimmy. Upon his excellent figure the ready-made suit had\nall the appearance of faultlessly tailored garments. Compton looked up\nat his visitor, and with the glance he swiftly appraised Jimmy--a\nglance that assured him that here might be just the man he wanted, for\nintelligence, aggressiveness and efficiency were evidently the\noutstanding characteristics of the young man before him. After Jimmy had\npresented himself the other motioned him to a chair.\n\n\"I am looking,\" said Mr. Compton, \"for an experienced man who can come\nin here and find out just what is wrong with us. We have an\nold-established business which has been making money for years. We are\ntaking all the work that we can possibly handle at the highest prices we\nhave ever received, and yet our profits are not at all commensurate with\nthe volume of business. It has occurred to me that an experienced man\nfrom the outside would be able to more quickly put his finger on the\nleaks and stop them. Now tell me just what your experience has been and\nwe will see if we can come to some understanding.\"\n\nFrom his pocket Jimmy drew a half-dozen envelopes, and taking the\ncontents from them one by one laid them on the desk before Mr. Compton.\nOn the letter-heads of half a dozen large out-of-town manufacturers in\nvarious lines were brief but eulogistic comments upon the work done in\ntheir plants by Mr. James Torrance, Jr. As he was reading them Mr.\nCompton glanced up by chance to see that the face of the applicant was\nslightly flushed, which he thought undoubtedly due to the fact that the\nother knew he was reading the words of praise contained in the letters,\nwhereas the truth of the matter was that Jimmy's color was heightened by\na feeling of guilt.\n\n\"These are very good,\" said Mr. Compton, looking up from the letters. \"I\ndon't know that I need go any further. A great deal depends on a man's\npersonality in a position of this sort, and from your appearance I\nshould imagine that you're all right along that line and you seem to\nhave had the right kind of experience. Now, what arrangement can we\nmake?\"\n\nJimmy had given the matter of pay considerable thought, but the trouble\nwas that he did not know what an efficiency expert might be expected to\ndemand. He recalled vaguely that the one his father had employed got\nsomething like ten dollars a day, or one hundred a day, Jimmy couldn't\nremember which, and so he was afraid that he might ask too much and lose\nthe opportunity, or too little and reveal that he had no knowledge of\nthe value of such services.\n\n\"I would rather leave that to you,\" he said. \"What do you think the work\nwould be worth to you?\"\n\n\"Do you expect to continue in this line of work?\" asked Mr. Compton.\n\"When this job is finished you would want to go somewhere else, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nJimmy saw an opening and leaped for it. \"Oh, no!\" he replied. \"On the\ncontrary, I wouldn't mind working into a permanent position, and if you\nthink there might be a possibility of that I would consider a reasonable\nsalary arrangement rather than the usual contract rate for expert\nservice.\"\n\n\"It is very possible,\" said Mr. Compton, \"that if you are the right man\nthere would be a permanent place in the organization for you. With that\nidea in mind I should say that two hundred and fifty dollars a month\nmight be a mutually fair arrangement to begin with.\"\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month!  Jimmy tried to look bored, but\nnot too bored.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"with the idea that it may become a permanent,\nwell-paying position I think I might be inclined to consider it--in\nfact, I am very favorably inclined toward it,\" he added hastily as he\nthought he noted a sudden waning of interest in Compton's expression.\n\"But be sure yourself that I am the man you want. For instance, my\nmethods--you should know something of them first.\"\n\nIn Jimmy's pocket was a small book he had purchased at a second-hand\nbookshop the evening before, upon the cover of which appeared the title\n\"How to Get More Out of Your Factory.\" He had not had sufficient time to\nstudy it thoroughly, but had succeeded in memorizing several principal\nheadings on the contents page.\n\n\"At first,\" he explained, \"I won't seem to be accomplishing much, as I\nalways lay the foundation of my future work by studying my men. Some men\nhave that within them which spurs them on; while some need artificial\ninitiative--outside encouragement,\" he quoted glibly from \"How to Get\nMore Out of Your Factory.\" \"Some men extend themselves under stern\ndiscipline; some respond only to a gentle rein. I study men--the men\nover me, under me, around me. I study them and learn how to get from\neach the most that is in him. At the same time I shall be looking for\nleaks and investigating timekeeping methods, wage-paying systems and\nplanning on efficiency producers. Later I shall start reducing costs by\nstudying machines, handling material economically and producing power at\nlowest cost; keeping the product moving, making environment count on the\nbalance-sheet and protecting against accident and fire.\" This was as far\nas Jimmy had memorized, and so he stopped.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mr. Compton, \"that you have the right idea.  Some of\nyour points are not entirely clear to me, as there are many modern\nmethods that I have not, I am sorry to say, investigated sufficiently.\"\n\nJimmy did not think it necessary to explain that they were not clear to\nhim either.\n\n\"And now,\" said Compton, \"if you are satisfied with the salary, when can\nyou start?\"\n\nJimmy rose with a brisk and businesslike manner. \"I am free now,\" he\nsaid, \"with the exception of a little personal business which I can\ndoubtless finish up tomorrow--suppose I come Thursday?\"\n\n\"Good,\" exclaimed Compton, \"but before you go I want you to meet our\nassistant general manager, Mr. Bince.\" And he led Jimmy toward Bince's\noffice.\n\n\"This is Mr. Torrance, Harold,\" said Mr. Compton as they entered. \"Mr.\nBince, Mr. Torrance. Mr. Torrance is going to help us systematize the\nplant. He will report directly to me and I know you will do everything\nin your power to help him. You can go to Mr. Bince for anything in the\nway of information you require, and Harold, when Mr. Torrance comes\nThursday I wish you would introduce him to Everett and the various\ndepartment heads and explain that they are to give him full cooperation.\nAnd now, as I have an appointment, I shall have to ask you to excuse me.\nI will see you Thursday. If there are any questions you want to ask, Mr.\nBince will be glad to give you any information you wish or care for.\"\n\nJimmy had felt from the moment that he was introduced to Bince that the\nlatter was antagonistic and now that the two were alone together he was\nnot long left in doubt as to the correctness of his surmise. As soon as\nthe door had closed behind Mr. Compton Bince wheeled toward Jimmy.\n\n\"I don't mind telling you, Mr. Torrance,\" he said, \"that I consider the\nservices of an expert absolutely unnecessary, but if Mr. Compton wishes\nto experiment I will interfere in no way and I shall help you all I can,\nbut I sincerely hope that you, on your part, will refrain from\ninterfering with my activities. As a matter of fact, you won't have to\nleave this office to get all the information you need, and if you will\ncome to me I can make it easy for you to investigate the entire workings\nof the plant and save you a great deal of unnecessary personal labor. I\nsuppose that you have had a great deal of experience along this line?\"\n\nJimmy nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"Just how do you purpose proceeding?\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Jimmy, \"each one of us really has a system of his own.\nAt first I won't seem to be accomplishing much, as I always lay the\nfoundation of my future work by studying my men. Some men have that\nwithin them which spurs them on; while some need artificial\ninitiative--outside encouragement.\" He hoped that the door to Compton's\noffice was securely closed.\n\n\"Some men extend themselves under stern discipline; some respond only to\na gentle rein. I study men--the men over me, under me, around me. I\nstudy them and learn how to get from each the most that is in him. At\nthe same time I shall be looking for leaks and investigating\ntime-keeping methods\"--he was looking straight at Bince and he could\nnot help but note the slight narrowing of the other's lids--\n\"wage-paying systems and planning on efficiency producers.\"\n\nHere he hesitated a moment as though weighing his words, though as a\nmatter of fact he had merely forgotten the title of the next chapter,\nbut presently he went on again:\n\n\"Later I shall start reducing costs by studying machines, handling\nmaterial economically and producing power at lowest costs: keeping the\nproduct moving, making environment count on the balance-sheet and\nprotecting against accident and fire.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Mr. Bince.\n\n\"Oh, no, indeed!\" said Jimmy. \"That's just a very brief outline of the\nway I shall start.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Bince. \"And just how, may I ask, do you make environment\ncount on the balance-sheet? I do not quite understand.\"\n\nJimmy was mentally gasping and going down for the third time. He had\nwondered when he read that chapter title just what it might mean.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"you will understand that thoroughly when we reach that\npoint. It is one of the steps in my method. Other things lead up to it.\nIt is really rather difficult to explain until we have a concrete\nexample, something that you can really visualize, you know. But I assure\nyou that it will be perfectly plain to you when we arrive at that point.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, rising, \"I must be going.  I have a great deal to\nattend to this afternoon and to-morrow, as I wish to get some personal\nmatters out of the way before I start in here Thursday.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Bince, \"I suppose we shall see you Thursday, but\njust bear in mind, please, that you and I can work better together than\nat cross-purposes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nJIMMY ON THE JOB.\n\nAs Jimmy left the office he discovered that those last words of Bince's\nhad made a considerable and a rather unfavorable impression on him. He\nwas sure that there was an underlying meaning, though just what it\nportended he was unable to imagine.\n\nFrom the International Machine Company Jimmy went directly to the\nrestaurant where he and Little Eva had dined the night before. He found\nher waiting for him, as they had agreed she would.\n\n\"Well, what luck?\" she asked as he took the chair next to her.\n\n\"Oh, I landed the job all right,\" said Jimmy, \"but I feel like a crook.\nI don't know how in the world I ever came to stand for those letters of\nrecommendation. They were the things that got me the job all right, but\nI honestly feel just as though I had stolen something.\"\n\n\"Don't feel that way,\" said the girl.  \"You'll make good, I know, and\nthen it won't make any difference about the letters.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Jimmy, \"tell me where you got them. You promised me that\nyou would tell me afterward.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the girl, \"that was easy.  A girl who rooms at the same place\nI do works in a big printing and engraving plant and I got her to get me\nsome samples of letterheads early this morning. In fact, I went\ndown-town with her when she went to work and then I went over to the\nUnderwood offices and wrote the recommendations out on a machine--I\nused to be a stenographer.\"\n\n\"And you forged these names?\" asked Jimmy, horrified.\n\n\"I didn't forge anybody's name,\" replied the girl.  \"I made them up.\"\n\n\"You mean there are no such men?\"\n\n\"As far as I know there are not,\" she replied, laughing.\n\nSlowly Jimmy drew the letters from his inside pocket and read them one\nby one, spreading them out upon the table before him. Presently he\nlooked up at the girl.\n\n\"Why don't you get a position again as a stenographer?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have been thinking of it,\" she said; \"do you want me to?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I want you to very much.\"\n\n\"It will be easy,\" she said.  \"There is no reason why I shouldn't except\nthat there was no one ever cared what I did.\"\n\nAs she finished speaking they were both aware that a man had approached\ntheir table and stopped opposite them. Jimmy and the girl looked up to\nsee a large man in a dark suit looking down at Eva. Jimmy did not\nrecognize the man, but he knew at once what he was.\n\n\"Well, O'Donnell, what's doing?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"You know what's doing,\" said the officer.  \"How miny toimes do the\ncapt'in have to be afther isshuin' orrders tellin' you janes to kape out\nuv dacent places?\"\n\nThe girl flushed.  \"I'm not working here,\" she said.\n\n\"To hell ye ain't,\" sneered O'Donnell.  \"Didn't I see ye flag this guy\nwhin he came in?\"\n\n\"This young lady is a friend of mine,\" said Jimmy.  \"I had an\nappointment to meet her here.\"\n\nO'Donnell shifted his gaze from the girl to her escort and for the first\ntime appraised Jimmy thoroughly. \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is,\" said Jimmy; \"you guessed it the first time, but far be it from\nme to know what you have guessed, as I never saw you before, my friend.\"\n\n\"Well, I've seen you before,\" said O'Donnell, \"and ye put one over on me\nthat time all roight, I can see now. I don't know what your game was,\nbut you and the Lizard played it pretty slick when you could pull the\nwool over Patrick O'Donnell's eyes the way ye done.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jimmy, \"I've got you now.  You're the bull who interfered\nwith my friend and me on Randolph and La Salle way back last July.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said O'Donnell, \"and I thought ye was a foine young gentleman,\nand you are a foine one,\" he said with intense sarcasm.\n\n\"Go away and leave us alone,\" said the girl. \"We're not doing anything.\nWe ate in here last night together. This man is perfectly respectable.\nHe isn't what you think him, at all.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to pinch him,\" said O'Donnell; \"I ain't got nothin' to\npinch him for, but the next time I see him I'll know him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl, \"are you going to beat it or are you going to\nstick around here bothering us all evening? There hasn't anybody\nregistered a complaint against me in here.\"\n\n\"Naw,\" said O'Donnell, \"they ain't, but you want to watch your step or\nthey will.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the girl, \"run along and sell your papers.\"  And she\nturned again to Jimmy, and as though utterly unconscious of the presence\nof the police officer, she remarked, \"That big stiff gives me a pain.\nHe's the original Buttinsky Kid.\"\n\nO'Donnell flushed.  \"Watch your step, young lady,\" he said as he turned\nand walked away.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Jimmy, \"that it was the customary practise to attempt\nto mollify the guardians of the law.\"\n\n\"Mollify nothing,\" returned the girl.  \"None of these big bruisers knows\nwhat decency is, and if you're decent to them they think you're afraid\nof them. When they got something on you you got to be nice, but when\nthey haven't, tell them where they get off. I knew he wouldn't pinch me;\nhe's got nothing to pinch me for, and he'd have been out of luck if he\nhad, for there hasn't one of them got anything on me.\"\n\n\"But won't he have it in for you?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Sure, he will,\" said the girl.  \"He's got it in for everybody. That's\nwhat being a policeman does to a man. Say, most of these guys hate\nthemselves. I tell you, though,\" she said presently and more seriously,\n\"I'm sorry on your account. These dicks never forget a face. He's got\nyou catalogued and filed away in what he calls his brain alongside of a\ndip and--a\"--she hesitated--\"a girl like me, and no matter how high\nup you ever get if your foot slips up will bob O'Donnell with these two\nfacts.\"\n\n\"I'm not worrying,\" said Jimmy.  \"I don't intend to let my foot slip in\nhis direction.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said the girl.\n\n                ------------------------\n\nThursday morning Jimmy took up his duties as efficiency expert at the\nplant of the International Machine Company. Since his interview with\nCompton his constant companion had been \"How to Get More Out of Your\nFactory,\" with the result that he felt that unless he happened to be\npitted against another efficiency expert he could at least make a noise\nlike efficiency, and also he had grasped what he considered the\nfundamental principle of efficiency, namely, simplicity.\n\n\"If,\" he reasoned, \"I cannot find in any plant hundreds of operations\nthat are not being done in the simplest manner it will be because I\nhaven't even ordinary powers of observation or intelligence,\" for after\nhis second interview with Compton, Jimmy had suddenly realized that the\njob meant something to him beside the two hundred and fifty dollars a\nmonth--that he couldn't deliberately rob Compton, as he felt that he\nwould be doing unless he could give value received in services, and he\nmeant to do his best to accomplish that end.\n\nHe knew that for a while his greatest asset would be bluff, but there\nwas something about Mason Compton that had inspired in the young man a\nvast respect and another sentiment that he realized upon better\nacquaintance might ripen into affection. Compton reminded him in many\nways of his father, and with the realization of that resemblance Jimmy\nfelt more and more ashamed of the part he was playing, but now that he\nhad gone into it he made up his mind that he would stick to it, and\nthere was besides the slight encouragement that he had derived from the\nenthusiasm of the girl who had suggested the idea to him and of her\noft-repeated assertion relative to her \"hunch\", that he would make good.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE EFFICIENCY EXPERT.\n\nUnlike most other plants the International Machine Company paid on\nMonday, and it was on the Monday following his assumption of his new\nduties that Jimmy had his first clash with Bince. He had been talking\nwith Everett, the cashier, whom, in accordance with his \"method,\" he was\nstudying. From Everett he had learned that it was pay-day and he had\nasked the cashier to let him see the pay-roll.\n\n\"I don't handle the pay-roll,\" replied Everett a trifle peevishly.\n\"Shortly after Mr. Bince was made assistant general manager a new rule\nwas promulgated, to the effect that all salaries and wages were to be\nconsidered as confidential and that no one but the assistant general\nmanager would handle the pay-rolls. All I know is the amount of the\nweekly check. He hires and fires everybody and pays everybody.\"\n\n\"Rather unusual, isn't it?\" commented Jimmy.\n\n\"Very,\" said Everett. \"Here's some of us have been with Mr. Compton\nsince Bince was in long clothes, and then he comes in here and says that\nwe are not to be trusted with the pay-roll.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jimmy, \"I shall have to go to him to see it then.\"\n\n\"He won't show it to you,\" said Everett.\n\n\"Oh, I guess he will,\" said Jimmy, and a moment later he knocked at\nBince's office door. When Bince saw who it was he turned back to his\nwork with a grunt.\n\n\"I am sorry, Torrance,\" he said, \"but I can't talk with you just now.\nI'm very busy.\"\n\n\"Working on the pay-roll?\" said Jimmy.  \"Yes,\" snarled Bince.\n\n\"That's what I came in to see,\" said the efficiency expert.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Bince.  \"The International Machine Company's pay-roll\nis confidential, absolutely confidential. Nobody sees it but me or Mr.\nCompton if he wishes to.\"\n\n\"I understood from Mr. Compton,\" said Jimmy, \"that I was to have full\naccess to all records.\"\n\n\"That merely applied to operation records,\" said Bince.  \"It had nothing\nto do with the pay-roll.\"\n\n\"I should consider the pay-roll very closely allied to operations,\"\nresponded Jimmy.\n\n\"I shouldn't,\" said Bince.\n\n\"You won't let me see it then?\" demanded Jimmy.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Bince, \"we agreed that we wouldn't interfere with each\nother. I haven't interfered with you. Now don't you interfere with me.\nThis is my work, and my office is not being investigated by any\nefficiency expert or any one else.\"\n\n\"I don't recall that I made any such agreement,\" said Jimmy.  \"I must\ninsist on seeing that pay-roll.\"\n\nBince turned white with suppressed anger, and then suddenly slamming his\npen on the desk, he wheeled around toward the other.\n\n\"I might as well tell you something,\" he said, \"that will make your path\neasier here, if you know it. I understand that you want a permanent job\nwith us. If you do you might as well understand now as any other time\nthat you have got to be satisfactory to me. Of course, it is none of\nyour business, but it may help you to understand conditions when I tell\nyou that I am to marry Mr. Compton's daughter, and when I do that he\nexpects to retire from business, leaving me in full charge here. Now, do\nyou get me?\"\n\nJimmy had involuntarily acquired antipathy toward Bince at their first\nmeeting, an antipathy which had been growing the more that he saw of the\nassistant general manager. This fact, coupled with Bince's present\nrather nasty manner, was rapidly arousing the anger of the efficiency\nexpert. \"I didn't come in here,\" he said, \"to discuss your matrimonial\nprospects, Mr. Bince. I came in here to see the pay-roll, and you will\noblige me by letting me see it.\"\n\n\"I tell you again,\" said Bince, \"once and for all, that you don't see\nthe pay-roll nor anything else connected with my office, and you will\noblige me by not bothering me any longer. As I told you when you first\ncame in, I am very busy.\"\n\nJimmy turned and left the room.  He was on the point of going to\nCompton's office and asking for authority to see the pay-roll, and then\nit occurred to him that Compton would probably not take sides against\nhis assistant general manager and future son-in-law.\n\n\"I've got to get at it some other way,\" said Jimmy, \"but you bet your\nlife I'm going to get at it. It looks to me as though there's something\nfunny about that pay-roll.\"\n\nOn his way out he stopped at Everett's cage. \"What was the amount of the\ncheck for the pay-roll for this week, Everett?\" he asked.\n\n\"A little over ninety-six hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Jimmy, and returned to the shops to continue his study of\nhis men, and as he studied them he asked many questions, made many notes\nin his little note-book, and always there were two questions that were\nthe same: \"What is your name? What wages do you get?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" said Jimmy, \"that in a short time I will know as much about\nthe payroll as the assistant general manager.\"\n\nNor was it the pay-roll only that claimed Jimmy's attention. He found\nthat several handlings of materials could be eliminated by the adoption\nof simple changes, and that a rearrangement of some of the machines\nremoved the necessity for long hauls from one part of the shop to\nanother. After an evening with the little volume he had purchased for\ntwenty-five cents in the second-hand bookshop he ordered changes that\nenabled him to cut five men from the pay-roll and at the same time do\nthe work more expeditiously and efficiently.\n\n\"Little book,\" he said one evening, \"I take my hat off to you. You are\nthe best two-bits' worth I ever purchased.\"\n\nThe day following the completion of the changes he had made in the shop\nhe was in Compton's office.\n\n\"Patton was explaining some of the changes you have made,\" remarked\nCompton. Patton was the shop foreman. \"He said they were so simple that\nhe wondered none of us had thought of them before. I quite agree with\nhim.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" returned Jimmy, \"but, then, my whole method is based upon\nsimplicity.\" And his mind traveled to the unpretentious little book on\nthe table in his room on Indiana Avenue.\n\n\"The feature that appeals to me most strongly is that you have been able\nto get the cooperation of the men,\" continued Compton \"that's what I\nfeared--that they wouldn't accept your suggestions. How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I showed them how they could turn out more work and make more money by\nmy plan. This appealed to the piece-workers. I demonstrated to the\nothers that the right way is the easiest way--I showed them how they\ncould earn their wages with less effort.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Compton. \"You are running into no difficulties then?  Is\nthere any way in which I can help you?\"\n\n\"I am getting the best kind of cooperation from the men in the shop,\npractically without exception,\" replied Jimmy, \"although there is one\nfellow, a straw boss named Krovac, who does not seem to take as kindly\nto the changes I have made as the others, but he really doesn't amount\nto anything as an obstacle.\" Jimmy also thought of Bince and the\npay-roll, but he was still afraid to broach the subject. Suddenly an\ninspiration came to him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I believe your accounting system could be improved--it\nwill take me months to get around to it, as my work is primarily in the\nshop, at first, at least. You can save both time and money by having\nyour books audited by a firm of public accountants who can also suggest\na new and more up-to-date system.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea,\" said Compton. \"I think we will do it.\"\n\nFor another half-hour they discussed Jimmy's work, and then as the\nlatter was leaving Compton stopped him.\n\n\"By the way, you don't happen to know of a good stenographer, do you?\nMiss Withe is leaving me Saturday.\"\n\nJimmy thought a moment.  Instantly he thought of Little Eva and what she\nhad said of her experience as a stenographer, and her desire to abandon\nher present life for something in the line of her former work. Here was\na chance to repay her in some measure for her kindness to him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I do know of a young lady who, I believe, could do the\nwork. Shall I have her call on you?\"\n\n\"If you will, please,\" replied Compton\n\nAs Jimmy left the office Compton rang for Bince, and when the latter\ncame, told him of his plan to employ a firm of accountants to renovate\ntheir entire system of bookkeeping.\n\n\"Is that one of Torrance's suggestions?\" asked Bince.\n\n\"Yes, the idea is his,\" replied Compton, \"and I think it is a good one.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Bince, \"that Torrance is balling things up\nsufficiently as it is without getting in other theorizers who have no\npractical knowledge of our business. The result of all this will be to\ngreatly increase our overhead by saddling us with a lot of red-tape in\nthe accounting department similar to that which Torrance is loading the\nproducing end with.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that you are prejudiced, Harold,\" said Compton.  \"I cannot\ndiscover that Torrance is doing anything to in any way complicate the\nshop work. As a matter of fact a single change which he has just made\nhas resulted in our performing certain operations in less time and to\nbetter advantage with five less men than formerly. Just in this one\nthing he has not only more than earned his salary, but is really paying\ndividends on our investment.\"\n\nBince was silent for a moment.  He had walked to the window and was\nlooking out on the street below, then he turned suddenly toward Compton.\n\n\"Mr. Compton,\" he said, \"you have made me assistant general manager here\nand now, just when I am reaching a point where I feel I can accomplish\nsomething, you are practically taking the authority out of my hands and\nputting it in that of a stranger. I feel not only that you are making a\ngrave mistake, but that it is casting a reflection on my work. It is\nmaking a difference in the attitude of the men toward me that I am\nafraid can never be overcome, and consequently while lessening my\nauthority it is also lessening my value to the plant. I am going to ask\nyou to drop this whole idea. As assistant general manager, I feel that\nit is working injury to the organization, and I hope that before it is\ntoo late--that, in fact, immediately, you will discharge Torrance and\ndrop this idea of getting outsiders to come in and install a new\naccounting system.\"\n\n\"You're altogether too sensitive, Harold,\" replied Compton. \"It is no\nreflection on you whatsoever. The system under which we have been\nworking is, with very few exceptions, the very system that I evolved\nmyself through years of experience in this business. If there is any\nreflection upon any one it is upon me and not you. You must learn to\nrealize, if you do not already, what I realize--that no one is\ninfallible. Just because the system is mine or yours we must not think\nthat no better system can be devised. I am perfectly satisfied with what\nMr. Torrance is doing, and I agree with his suggestion that we employ a\nfirm of accountants, but I think no less of you or your ability on that\naccount.\"\n\nBince saw that it was futile to argue the matter further.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. \"I hope that I am mistaken and that no\nserious harm will result. When do you expect to start these accountants\nin?\"\n\n\"Immediately,\" replied Compton.  \"I shall get in touch with somebody\ntoday.\"\n\nBince shook his head dubiously as he returned to his own office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nPLOTTING.\n\nThe following Monday Miss Edith Hudson went to work for the\nInternational Machine Company as Mr. Compton's stenographer. Nor could\nthe most fastidious have discovered aught to criticize in the appearance\nor deportment of Little Eva.\n\nThe same day the certified public accountants came.  Mr. Harold Bince\nappeared nervous and irritable, and he would have been more nervous and\nmore irritable had he known that Jimmy had just learned the amount of\nthe pay-check from Everett and that he had discovered that, although\nfive men had been laid off and no new ones employed since the previous\nweek, the payroll check was practically the same as before--\napproximately one thousand dollars more than his note-book indicated\nit should be.\n\n\"Phew!\" whistled Jimmy. \"These C.P.A.s are going to find this a more\ninteresting job than they anticipated. Poor old Compton! I feel mighty\nsorry for him, but he had better find it out now than after that grafter\nhas wrecked his business entirely.\"\n\nThat afternoon Mr. Compton left the office earlier than usual,\ncomplaining of a headache, and the next morning his daughter telephoned\nthat he was ill and would not come to the office that day. During the\nmorning as Bince was walking through the shop he stopped to talk with\nKrovac.\n\nPete Krovac was a rat-faced little foreigner, looked upon among the men\nas a trouble-maker. He nursed a perpetual grievance against his employer\nand his job, and whenever the opportunity presented, and sometimes when\nit did not present itself, he endeavored to inoculate others with his\ndissatisfaction. Bince had hired the man, and during the several months\nthat Krovac had been with the company, the assistant general manager had\nlearned enough from other workers to realize that the man was an\nagitator and a troublemaker. Several times he had been upon the point of\ndischarging him, but now he was glad that he had not, for he thought he\nsaw in him a type that in the light of present conditions might be of\nuse to him.\n\nIn fact, for the past couple of weeks he had been using the man in an\nendeavor to get some information concerning Torrance and his methods\nthat would permit him to go to Compton with a valid argument for Jimmy's\ndischarge.\n\n\"Well, Krovac,\" he said as he came upon the man, \"is Torrance\ninterfering with you any now?\"\n\n\"He hasn't got my job yet,\" growled the other, \"but he's letting out\nhard-working men with families without any reason. The first thing you\nknow you'll have a strike on your hands.\"\n\n\"I haven't heard any one else complaining,\" said Bince. \"You will,\nthough,\" replied Krovac. \"They don't any of us know when we are going to\nbe canned to give Compton more profit, and men are not going to stand\nfor that long.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Bince, \"I take it that he really hasn't interfered with you\nmuch?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's always around asking a lot of fool questions,\" said Krovac.\n\"Last week he asked every man in the place what his name was and what\nwages he was getting. Wrote it all down in a little book. I suppose he\nis planning on cutting pay.\"\n\nBince's eyes narrowed.  \"He got that information from every man in the\nshop?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Krovac.\n\nBince was very pale.  He stood in silence for some minutes, apparently\nstudying the man before him. At last he spoke.\n\n\"Krovac,\" he said, \"you don't like this man Torrance, do you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other, \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" said Bince. \"I know his plans even better than you.\nThis shop has short hours and good pay, but if we don't get rid of him\nit will have the longest hours and lowest pay of any shop in the city.\"\n\n\"Well?\" questioned Krovac.\n\n\"I think,\" said Bince, \"that there ought to be some way to prevent this\nman doing any further harm here.\"\n\nHe looked straight into Krovac's eyes.\n\n\"There is,\" muttered the latter.\n\n\"It would be worth something of course,\" suggested Bince. \"How much?\"\nasked Krovac.\n\n\"Oh, I should think it ought to be worth a hundred dollars,\" replied\nBince.\n\nKrovac thought for a moment.\n\n\"I think I can arrange it,\" he said, \"but I would have to have fifty\nnow.\"\n\n\"I cannot give it to you here,\" said Bince, \"but if I should happen to\npass through the shop this afternoon you might find an envelope on the\nfloor beside your machine after I have gone.\"\n\nThe following evening as Jimmy alighted from the Indiana Avenue car at\nEighteenth Street, two men left the car behind him. He did not notice\nthem, although, as he made his way toward his boarding-house, he heard\nfootsteps directly in his rear, and suddenly noting that they were\napproaching him rapidly, he involuntarily cast a glance behind him just\nas one of the men raised an arm to strike at him with what appeared to\nbe a short piece of pipe.\n\nJimmy dodged the blow and then both men sprang for him.  The first one\nJimmy caught on the point of the chin with a blow that put its recipient\nout of the fight before he got into it, and then his companion, who was\nthe larger, succeeded in closing with the efficiency expert.\nInadvertently, however, he caught Jimmy about the neck, leaving both his\nintended victim's arms free with the result that the latter was able to\nseize his antagonist low down about the body, and then pressing him\nclose to him and hurling himself suddenly forward, he threw the fellow\nbackward upon the cement sidewalk with his own body on top. With a\nresounding whack the attacker's head came in contact with the concrete,\nhis arms relaxed their hold upon Jimmy's neck, and as the latter arose\nhe saw both his assailants, temporarily at least, out of the fighting.\n\nJimmy glanced hastily in both directions.  There was no one in sight.\nHis boardinghouse was but a few steps away, and two minutes later he was\nsafe in his room.\n\n\"A year ago,\" he thought to himself, smiling, \"my first thought would\nhave been to have called in the police, but the Lizard has evidently\ngiven me a new view-point in regard to them,\" for the latter had\nimpressed upon Jimmy the fact that whatever knowledge a policeman might\nhave regarding one was always acquired with the idea that eventually it\nmight be used against the person to whom it pertained.\n\n\"What a policeman don't know about you will never hurt you,\" was one way\nthat the Lizard put it.\n\nWhen Jimmy appeared in the shop the next morning he noted casually that\nKrovac had a cut upon his chin, but he did not give the matter a second\nthought. Bince had arrived late. His first question, as he entered the\nsmall outer office where Mr. Compton's stenographer and his worked, was\naddressed to Miss Edith Hudson.\n\n\"Is Mr. Torrance down yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl, \"he has been here some time.  Do you wish to\nsee him?\"\n\nEdith thought that the \"No\" which he snapped at her was a trifle more\nemphatic than the circumstances seemed to warrant, nor could she help\nbut notice after he had entered his office the vehement manner in which\nhe slammed the door.\n\n\"I wonder what's eating him,\" thought Miss Hudson to herself.  \"Of\ncourse he doesn't like Jimmy, but why is he so peeved because Jimmy came\nto work this morning--I don't quite get it.\"\n\nAlmost immediately Bince sent for Krovac, and when the latter came and\nstood before his desk the assistant general manager looked up at him\nquestioningly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Look at my chin,\" was Krovac's reply, \"and he damn near killed the\nother guy.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll have better luck the next time,\" growled Bince.\n\n\"There ain't goin' to be no next time,\" asserted Krovac. \"I don't tackle\nthat guy again.\"\n\nBince held out his hand.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"you might return the fifty then.\"\n\n\"Return nothin',\" growled Krovac. \"I sure done fifty dollars' worth last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Bince, \"hand over the fifty.\"\n\n\"Nothin' doin',\" said Krovac with an angry snarl.  \"It might be worth\nanother fifty to you to know that I wasn't going to tell old man\nCompton.\"\n\n\"You  damn  scoundrel!\"  exclaimed Bince.\n\n\"Don't go callin' me names,\" admonished Krovac.  \"A fellow that hires\nanother to croak a man for him for one hundred bucks ain't got no\nlicense to call nobody names.\"\n\nBince realized only too well that he was absolutely in the power of the\nfellow and immediately his manner changed.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"Krovac, there is no use in our quarreling.  You can\nhelp me and I can help you. There must be some other way to get around\nthis.\"\n\n\"What are you trying to do?\" asked Krovac.  \"I got enough on you now to\nsend you up, and I don't mind tellin' yuh,\" he added, \"that I had a guy\nhid down there in the shop where he could watch you drop the envelope\nbehind my machine. I got a witness, yuh understand!\"\n\nMr. Bince did understand, but still he managed to control his temper.\n\n\"What of it?\" he said. \"Nobody would believe your story, but let's\nforget that. What we want to do is get rid of Torrance.\"\n\n\"That isn't all you want to do,\" said Krovac. \"There is something else.\"\n\nBince realized that he was compromised as hopelessly already as he could\nbe if the man had even more information.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"there is something beside Torrance's interference in\nthe shop. He's interfering with our accounting system and I don't want\nit interfered with just now.\"\n\n\"You mean the pay-roll?\" asked Krovac.\n\n\"It might be,\" said Bince.\n\n\"You want them two new guys that are working in the office croaked,\ntoo?\" asked Krovac.\n\n\"I don't want anybody 'croaked',\" replied Bince. \"I didn't tell you to\nkill Torrance in the first place. I just said I didn't want him to come\nback here to work.\"\n\n\"Ah, hell, what you givin' us?\" growled the other. \"I knew what you\nmeant and you knew what you meant, too. Come across straight. What do\nyou want?\"\n\n\"I want all the records of the certified public accountants who are\nworking here,\" said Bince after a moment's pause. \"I want them\ndestroyed, together with the pay-roll records.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"They will all be in the safe in Mr. Compton's office.\"\n\nKrovac knitted his brows in thought for several moments. \"Say,\" he said,\n\"we can do the whole thing with one job.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Bince,\n\n\"We can get rid of this Torrance guy and get the records, too.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Bince. \"Do you know where Feinheimer's is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you be over there to-night about ten thirty and I'll introduce\nyou to a guy who can pull off this whole thing, and you and I won't have\nto be mixed up in it at all.\"\n\n\"To-night at ten thirty,\" said Bince.\n\n\"At Feinheimer's,\" said Krovac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nAN INVITATION TO DINE.\n\nAs the workman passed through the little outer office Edith Hudson\nglanced up at him.\n\n\"Where,\" she thought after he had gone, \"have I seen that fellow\nbefore?\"\n\nJimmy was in the shop applying \"How to Get More Out of Your Factory\" to\nthe problems of the International Machine Company when he was called to\nthe telephone.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Torrance?\" asked a feminine voice.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"I am Miss Compton.  My father will probably not be able to get to the\noffice for several days, and as he wishes very much to talk with you he\nhas asked me to suggest that you take dinner with us this evening.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Jimmy. \"Tell Mr. Compton that I will come to the house\nright after the shop closes to-night.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Elizabeth Compton as she turned away from the phone,\n\"that an efficiency expert is a very superior party and that his\nconversation will be far above my head.\"\n\nCompton laughed.  \"Torrance seems to be a very likable chap,\" he said,\n\"and as far as his work is concerned he is doing splendidly.\"\n\n\"Harold doesn't think so,\" said Elizabeth.  \"He is terribly put out\nabout the fellow. He told me only the other night that he really\nbelieved that it would take years to overcome the bad effect that this\nman has had upon the organization and upon the work in general.\"\n\n\"That is all poppycock,\" exclaimed Compton, rather more irritably than\nwas usual with him. \"For some reason Harold has taken an unwarranted\ndislike to this man, but I am watching him closely, and I will see that\nno very serious mistakes are made.\"\n\nWhen Jimmy arrived at the Compton home he was ushered into the library\nwhere Mr. Compton was sitting. In a corner of the room, with her back\ntoward the door, Elizabeth Compton sat reading. She did not lay aside\nher book or look in his direction as Jimmy entered, for the man was in\nno sense a guest in the light of her understanding of the term. He was\nmerely one of her father's employees here on business to see him,\ndoubtless a very ordinary sort of person whom she would, of course, have\nto meet when dinner was announced, but not one for whom it was necessary\nto put oneself out in any way.\n\nMr. Compton rose and greeted Jimmy cordially and then turned toward his\ndaughter.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said, \"this is Mr. Torrance, the efficiency expert at\nthe plant.\"\n\nLeisurely Miss Compton laid aside her book.  Rising, she faced the\nnewcomer, and as their eyes met, Jimmy barely stifled a gasp of\nastonishment and dismay. Elizabeth Compton's arched brows raised\nslightly and involuntarily she breathed a low ejaculation, \"Efficiency\nexpert!\"\n\nSimultaneously there flashed through the minds of both in rapid\nsuccession a series of recollections of their previous meetings. The\ngirl saw the clerk at the stocking-counter, the waiter at Feinheimer's,\nthe prize-fighter at the training quarters and the milk-wagon driver.\nAll these things passed through her mind in the brief instant of the\nintroduction and her acknowledgment of it. She was too well-bred to\npermit any outward indication of her recognition of the man other than\nthe first almost inaudible ejaculation that had been surprised from her.\n\n The indifference she had felt prior to meeting the efficiency expert\n was altered now to a feeling of keen interest as she realized that she\n held the power to relieve Bince of the further embarrassment of the\n man's activities in the plant, and also to save her father from the\n annoyance and losses that Bince had assured her would result from\n Torrance's methods. And so she greeted Jimmy Torrance pleasantly,\n almost cordially.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" she said, \"but I am afraid that I am a little awed,\ntoo, as I was just saying to father before you came that I felt an\nefficiency expert must be a very superior sort of person.\"\n\nIf she placed special emphasis on the word \"superior\" it was so cleverly\ndone that it escaped the notice of her father.\n\n\"Oh, not at all,\" replied Jimmy. \"We efficiency experts are really quite\nordinary people. One is apt to meet us in any place that nice people are\nsupposed to go.\"\n\nElizabeth felt the color rising slowly to her cheek.  She realized then\nthat if she had thrown down the gage of battle the young man had lost no\ntime in taking it up.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" she said, \"that I do not understand very much about the\nnature or the purpose of your work, but I presume the idea is to make\nthe concern with which you are connected more prosperous--more\nsuccessful?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said her father, \"that is the idea, and even in the short time he\nhas been with us Mr. Torrance has effected some very excellent changes.\"\n\n\"It must be very interesting work,\" commented the girl; \"a profession\nthat requires years of particular experience and study, and I suppose\none must be really thoroughly efficient and successful himself, too,\nbefore he can help to improve upon the methods of others or to bring\nthem greater prosperity.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" said Jimmy. \"Whatever a man undertakes he should succeed\nin before he can hope to bring success to others.\"\n\n\"Even in trifling occupations, I presume,\" suggested the girl,\n\"efficiency methods are best--an efficiency expert could doubtlessly\ndrive a milk-wagon better than an ordinary person?\" And she looked\nstraight into Jimmy's eyes, an unquestioned challenge in her own.\n\n\"Unquestionably,\" said Jimmy.  \"He could wait on table better, too.\"\n\n\"Or sell stockings?\" suggested Elizabeth.\n\nIt was at this moment that Mr. Compton was called to the telephone in an\nadjoining room, and when he had gone the girl turned suddenly upon Jimmy\nTorrance. There was no cordiality nor friendship in her expression; a\nsneer upcurved her short upper lip.\n\n\"I do not wish to humiliate you unnecessarily in the presence of my\nfather,\" she said. \"You have managed to deceive him into believing that\nyou are what you claim to be. Mr. Bince has known from the start that\nyou are incompetent and incapable of accomplishing the results father\nthinks you are accomplishing. Now that you know that I know you to be an\nimpostor, what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I intend to keep right on with my work in the plant, Miss Compton,\"\nreplied Jimmy.\n\n\"How long do you suppose father would keep you after I told him what I\nknow of you? Do you think that he would for a moment place the future of\nhis business in the hands of an ex-waiter from Feinheimer's---that he\nwould let a milk-wagon driver tell him how to run his business?\"\n\n\"It probably might make a difference,\" said Jimmy, \"if he knew, but he\nwill not know--listen, Miss Compton, I have discovered some things\nthere that I have not even dared as yet to tell your father. The whole\nfuture of the business may depend upon my being there during the next\nfew weeks. If I wasn't sure of what I am saying I might consider\nacceding to your demands rather than to embarrass you with certain\nknowledge which I have.\"\n\n\"You refuse to leave, then?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I do,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" she replied; \"I shall tell father when he returns to this\nroom just what I know of you.\"\n\n\"Will you tell him,\" asked Jimmy, \"that you went to the training\nquarters of a prize-fighter, or that you dined unescorted at\nFeinheimer's at night and were an object of the insulting attentions of\nsuch a notorious character as Steve Murray?\"\n\nThe girl flushed. \"You would tell him that?\" she demanded. \"Oh, of\ncourse, I might have known that you would. It is difficult to realize\nthat any one dining at my father's home is not a gentleman. I had\nforgotten for the moment.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"I would tell him, not from a desire to harm you, but\nbecause this is the only way that I can compel you to refrain from\nsomething that would result in inestimable harm to your father.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nJIMMY TELLS THE TRUTH.\n\nMr. Compton returned to the room before  Jimmy  had  discovered whether\nthe girl intended to expose him or not. She said nothing about the\nmatter during dinner, and immediately thereafter she excused herself,\nleaving the two men alone.\n\nDuring the conversation that ensued Jimmy discovered that Bince had been\nusing every argument at his command to induce Compton to let him go, as\nwell as getting rid of the certified public accountants.\n\n\"I can't help but feel,\" said Compton, \"that possibly there may be some\nreason in what Mr. Bince says, for he seems to feel more strongly on\nthis subject than almost any question that has ever arisen in the plant\nwherein we differed, and it may be that I am doing wrong to absolutely\nignore his wishes in the matter.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, Mr. Torrance, I have reached the point where I\ndon't particularly relish a fight, as I did in the past. I would rather\nhave things run along smoothly than to have this feeling of unrest and\nunpleasantness that now exists in the plant. I do not say that you are\nto blame for it, but the fact remains that ever since you came I have\nbeen constantly harassed by this same unpleasant condition which grows\nworse day by day. There is no question but what you have accomplished a\ngreat deal for us of a practical nature, but I believe in view of Mr.\nBince's feelings in the matter that we had better terminate our\narrangement.\"\n\nJimmy suddenly noted how old and tired his employer looked.  He\nrealized, too, that for a week he had been fighting an incipient\ninfluenza and that doubtless his entire mental attitude was influenced\nby the insidious workings of the disease, one of the marked symptoms of\nwhich he knew to be a feeling of despondency and mental depression,\nwhich sapped both courage and initiative.\n\nThey were passing through the hallway from the dining-room to the\nlibrary, and as Compton concluded what was equivalent to Jimmy's\ndischarge, he had stopped and turned toward the younger man. They were\nstanding near the entrance to the music-room in which Elizabeth chanced\nto be, so that she overheard her father's words, and not without a smile\nof satisfaction and relief.\n\n\"Mr. Compton,\" replied Jimmy, \"no matter what you do with me, you simply\nmust not let those C.P.A.'s go until they have completed their work. I\nknow something of what it is going to mean to your business, but I would\nrather that the reports come from them than from me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Compton.\n\n\"I didn't want to be the one to tell you,\" replied Jimmy. \"I preferred\nthat the C.P.A.'s discover it, as they will within the next day or\ntwo--you are being systematically robbed. I suspected it before I had\nbeen there ten days, and I was absolutely sure of it at the time I\nsuggested you employ the C.P.A.'s. You are being robbed at the rate of\napproximately one thousand dollars a week.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Compton.\n\n\"I would rather you would wait for the report of the C.P.A.'s,\" returned\nJimmy.\n\n\"I wish to know now,\" said Compton, \"how I am being robbed.\"\n\nJimmy looked straight into the older man's eyes.  \"Through the\npay-roll,\" he replied.\n\nFor a full minute Compton did not speak.\n\n\"You may continue with your work in the plant,\" he said at last, \"and we\nwill keep the accountants, for a while at least. And now I am going to\nask you to excuse me. I find that I tire very quickly since I have been\nthreatened with influenza.\"\n\nJimmy bid his employer good night, and Mr. Compton turned into the\nlibrary as the former continued along across the hall to the entrance.\nHe was putting on his overcoat when Elizabeth Compton emerged from the\nmusic-room and approached him.\n\n\"I overheard your conversation with father,\" she said. \"It seems to me\nthat you are making a deliberate attempt to cause him worry and\napprehension--you are taking advantage of his illness to frighten him\ninto keeping you in his employ. I should think you would be ashamed of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you think that,\" said Jimmy.  \"If it was not for your\nfather and you I wouldn't have urged the matter at all.\"\n\n\"You are just doing it to hold your position,\" retorted the girl, \"and\nnow, by threats of blackmail you prevent me from exposing you--you are\na despicable cur.\"\n\nJimmy felt the blood mounting to his face. He was mortified and angry,\nand yet he was helpless because his traducer was a woman. Unconsciously\nhe drew himself to his full height.\n\n\"You will have to think about me as you please,\" he said; \"I cannot\ninfluence that, but I want you to understand that you are not to\ninterfere with my work. I think we understand one another perfectly,\nMiss Compton. Good night.\"\n\nAnd as he closed the door behind him he left a very angry young lady\nbiting her lower lip and almost upon the verge of angry tears.\n\n\"The boor,\" she exclaimed; \"he dared to order me about and threaten me.\"\n\nThe telephone interrupted her unhappy train of thoughts.  It was Bince.\n\n\"I am sorry, Elizabeth,\" he said, \"but I won't be able to come up this\nevening. I have some important business to attend to. How is your\nfather?\"\n\n\"He seems very tired and despondent,\" replied Elizabeth. \"That\nefficiency person was here to dinner. He just left.\"\n\nShe could not see the startled and angry expression of Bince's face as\nhe received this information. \"Torrance was there?\" he asked. \"How did\nthat happen?\"\n\n\"Father asked him to dinner, and when he wanted to discharge the fellow\nTorrance told him something that upset father terribly, and urged that\nhe be kept a little while longer, to which father agreed.\"\n\n\"What did he tell him?\" asked Bince.\n\n\"Oh, some alarmist tale about somebody robbing father.  I didn't quite\nmake out what it was all about, but it had something to do with the\npay-roll.\"\n\nBince went white. \"Don't believe anything that fellow says,\" he\nexclaimed excitedly: \"he's nothing but a crook. Elizabeth, can't you\nmake your father realize that he ought to get rid of the man, that he\nought to leave things to me instead of trusting an absolute stranger?\"\n\n\"I have,\" replied the girl, \"and he was on the point of doing it until\nTorrance told him this story.\"\n\n\"Something will have to be done,\" said Bince, \"at once.  I'll be over to\nsee your father in the morning. Good-by, dear,\" and he hung up the\nreceiver.\n\nAfter Jimmy left the Compton home he started to walk down-town.  It was\ntoo early to go to his dismal little room on Indiana Avenue. The Lizard\nwas still away. He had seen nothing of him for weeks, and with his going\nhe had come to realize that he had rather depended upon the Lizard for\ncompany. He was full of interesting stories of the underworld and his\ndry humor and strange philosophy amused and entertained Jimmy.\n\nAnd now as he walked along the almost deserted drive after his recent\nunpleasant scene with Elizabeth Compton he felt more blue and lonely\nthan he had for many weeks. He craved human companionship, and so strong\nwas the urge that his thoughts naturally turned to the only person other\nthan the Lizard who seemed to have taken any particularly kindly\ninterest in him. Acting on the impulse he turned west at the first cross\nstreet until he came to a drugstore. Entering a telephone-booth he\ncalled a certain number and a moment later had his connection.\n\n\"Is that you, Edith?\" he asked, and at the affirmative reply, \"this is\nJimmy Torrance. I'm feeling terribly lonesome. I was wondering if I\ncouldn't drag you out to listen to my troubles?\"\n\n\"Surest thing you know,\" cried the girl.  \"Where are you?\"  He told her.\n\"Take a Clark Street car,\" she told him, \"and I'll be at the corner of\nNorth Avenue by the time you get there.\"\n\nAs the girl hung up the receiver and turned from the phone a slightly\nquizzical expression reflected some thought that was in her mind. \"I\nwonder,\" she said as she returned to her room, \"if he is going to be\nlike the rest?\"\n\nShe seated herself before her mirror and critically examined her\nreflection in the glass. She knew she was good-looking. No need of a\nmirror to tell her that. Her youth and her good looks had been her stock\nin trade, and yet this evening she appraised her features most\ncritically, and as with light fingers she touched her hair, now in one\nplace and now in another, she found herself humming a gay little tune\nand she realized that she was very happy.\n\nWhen Jimmy Torrance alighted from the Clark Street car he found Edith\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"It was mighty good of you,\" he said.  \"I don't know when I have had\nsuch a fit of blues, but I feel better already.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked.\n\n\"I just had a talk with Mr. Compton,\" he replied. \"He sent for me and I\nhad to tell him something that I didn't want to tell him, although he's\ngot to find it out sooner or later anyway.\"\n\n\"Is there something wrong at the plant?\" she asked.\n\n\"Wrong doesn't describe it,\" he exclaimed bitterly.  \"The man that he\nhas done the most for and in whose loyalty he ought to have the right of\nimplicit confidence, is robbing him blind.\"\n\n\"Bince?\" asked the girl.  Jimmy nodded.  \"I didn't like that pill,\" she\nsaid, \"from the moment I saw him.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Jimmy, \"but he is going to marry Miss Compton and inherit\nthe business. He's the last man in the place that Compton would suspect.\nIt was just like suggesting to a man that his son was robbing him.\"\n\n\"Have you got the goods on him?\" asked Edith.\n\n\"I will have as soon as the C.P.A.'s get to digging into the pay-roll,\"\nhe replied, \"and I just as good as got the information I need even\nwithout that. Well, let's forget our troubles. What shall we do?\"\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" she asked.\n\nHe could not tell by either her tone or expression with what anxiety she\nawaited his reply. \"Suppose we do something exciting, like going to the\nmovies,\" he suggested with a laugh.\n\n\"That suits me all right,\" said the girl.  \"There is a dandy comedy down\nat the Castle.\"\n\nAnd so they went to the picture show, and when it was over he suggested\nthat they have a bite to eat.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" Edith suggested.  \"Suppose we go to Feinheimer's\nrestaurant and see if we can't get that table that I used to eat at when\nyou waited on me?\" They both laughed.\n\n\"If old Feinheimer sees me he will have me poisoned,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Not if you have any money to spend in his place.\"\n\nIt was eleven thirty when they reached Feinheimer's.  The table they\nwanted was vacant, a little table in a corner of the room and furthest\nfrom the orchestra. The waiter, a new man, did not know them, and no one\nhad recognized them as they entered.\n\nJimmy sat looking at the girl's profile as she studied the menu-card.\nShe was very pretty. He had always thought her that, but somehow\nto-night she seemed to be different, even more beautiful than in the\npast. He wished that he could forget what she had been. And he realized\nas he looked at her sweet girlish face upon which vice had left no\nslightest impression to mark her familiarity with vice, that it might be\neasy to forget her past. And then between him and the face of the girl\nbefore him arose the vision of another face, the face of the girl that\nhe had set upon a pedestal and worshiped from afar. And with the\nrecollection of her came a realization of the real cause of his sorrow\nand depression earlier in the evening.\n\nHe had attributed it to the unpleasant knowledge he had been forced to\npartially impart to her father and also in some measure to the\nregrettable interview he had had with her, but now he knew that these\nwere only contributory causes, that the real reason was that during the\nmonths she had occupied his thoughts and in the few meetings he had had\nwith her there had developed within him, unknown to himself, a sentiment\nfor her that could be described by but one word--love.\n\nAlways, though he had realized that she was unattainable, there must\nhave lingered within his breast a faint spark of hope that somehow, some\ntime, there would be a chance, but after to-night he knew there could\nnever be a chance. She had openly confessed her contempt for him, and\nhow would she feel later when she realized that through his efforts her\nhappiness was to be wrecked, and the man she loved and was to marry\nbranded as a criminal?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nA LETTER FROM MURRAY.\n\nThe girl opposite him looked up from the card before her.  The lines of\nher face were softened by the suggestion of a contented smile. \"My\ngracious!\" she exclaimed. \"What's the matter now? You look as though you\nhad lost your last friend.\"\n\nJimmy quickly forced a smile to his lips.  \"On the contrary,\" he said,\n\"I think I've found a regular friend--in you.\"\n\nIt was easy to see that his words pleased her.\n\n\"No,\" continued Jimmy; \"I was thinking of what an awful mess I make of\neverything I tackle.\"\n\n\"You're not making any mess of this new job,\" she said.  \"You're making\ngood. You see, my hunch was all right.\"\n\n\"I wish you hadn't had your hunch,\" he said with a smile.  \"It's going\nto bring a lot of trouble to several people, but now that I'm in it I'm\ngoing to stick to it to a finish.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes were wandering around the room, taking in the faces of\nthe diners about them. Suddenly she extended her hand and laid it on\nJimmy's.\n\n\"For the love of Mike,\" she exclaimed.  \"Look over there.\"\n\nSlowly Jimmy turned his eyes in the direction she indicated.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" he ejaculated.  \"Steve Murray and Bince!\"\n\n\"And thick as thieves,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Naturally,\" commented Jimmy.\n\nThe two men left the restaurant before Edith and Jimmy had finished\ntheir supper, leaving the two hazarding various guesses as to the reason\nfor their meeting.\n\n\"You can bet it's for no good,\" said the girl.  \"I've known Murray for a\nlong while, and I never knew him to do a decent thing in his life.\"\n\nTheir supper over, they walked to Clark Street and took a northbound\ncar, but after alighting Jimmy walked with the girl to the entrance of\nher apartment.\n\n\"I can't thank you enough,\" he said, \"for giving me this evening.  It is\nthe only evening I have enjoyed since I struck this town last July.\"\n\nHe unlocked the outer door for her and was holding it open.\n\n\"It is I who ought to thank you,\" she said.  Her voice was very low and\nfilled with suppressed feeling. \"I ought to thank you, for this has been\nthe happiest evening of my life,\" and as though she could not trust\nherself to say more, she entered the hallway and closed the door between\nthem.\n\nAs Jimmy turned away to retrace his steps to the car-line he found his\nmind suddenly in a whirl of jumbled emotions, for he was not so stupid\nas to have failed to grasp something of the significance of the girl's\nwords and manner.\n\n\"Hell!\" he muttered.  \"Look what I've done now!\"\n\nThe girl hurried to her room and turned on the lights, and again she\nseated herself before her mirror, and for a moment sat staring at the\ncountenance reflected before her. She saw lips parted to rapid\nbreathing, lips that curved sweetly in a happy smile, and then as she\nsat there looking she saw the expression of the face before her change.\nThe lips ceased to smile, the soft, brown eyes went wide and staring as\nthough in sudden horror. For a moment she sat thus and then, throwing\nher body forward upon her dressing-table, she buried her face in her\narms.\n\n\"My God!\" she cried through choking sobs.\n\nMason Compton was at his office the next morning, contrary to the pleas\nof his daughter and the orders of his physician. Bince was feeling more\ncheerful. Murray had assured him that there was a way out. He would not\ntell Bince what the way was.\n\n\"Just leave it to me,\" he said.  \"The less you know, the better off\nyou'll be. What you want is to get rid of this fresh guy and have all\nthe papers in a certain vault destroyed. You see to it that only the\npapers you want destroyed are in that vault, and I'll do the rest.\"\n\nAll of which relieved Mr. Harold Bince's elastic conscience of any\nfeeling of responsibility in the matter. Whatever Murray did was no\nbusiness of his. He was glad that Murray hadn't told him.\n\nHe greeted Jimmy Torrance almost affably, but he lost something of his\nself-composure when Mason Compton arrived at the office, for Bince had\nbeen sure that his employer would be laid up for at least another week,\nduring which time Murray would have completed his work.\n\nThe noon mail brought a letter from Murray.\n\n\"Show the enclosed to Compton,\" it read. \"Tell him you found it on your\ndesk, and destroy this letter.\" The enclosure was a crudely printed note\non a piece of soiled wrapping-paper:\n\n\n\n                      TREAT YOUR MEN RIGHT OR\n                      SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES\n                              I. W. W.\n\n\n\nBince laid Murray's letter face down upon the balance of the open mail,\nand sat for a long time looking at the ominous words of the enclosure.\nAt first he was inclined to be frightened, but finally a crooked smile\ntwisted his lips. \"Murray's not such a fool, after all,\" he\nsoliloquized.\n\n\"He's framing an alibi before he starts.\"\n\nWith the note in his hand, Bince entered Compton's office, where he\nfound the latter dictating to Edith Hudson. \"Look at this thing!\"\nexclaimed Bince, laying the note before Compton. \"What do you suppose it\nmeans?\"\n\nCompton read it, and his brows knitted. \"Have the men been complaining\nat all?\" he asked.\n\n\"Recently I have heard a little grumbling,\"  replied Bince.  \"They\nhaven't taken very kindly to Torrance's changes, and I guess some of\nthem are afraid they are going to lose their jobs, as they know he is\ncutting down the force in order to cut costs.\"\n\n\"He ought to know about this,\" said Compton.  \"Wait; I'll have him in,\"\nand he pressed a button on his desk. A moment later Jimmy entered, and\nCompton showed him the note.\n\n\"What do you think of it?\" asked Compton.\n\n\"I doubt if it amounts to much,\" replied Jimmy.  \"The men have no\ngrievance. It may be the work of some fellow who was afraid of his job,\nbut I doubt if it really emanates from any organized scheme of\nintimidation. If I were you, sir, I would simply ignore it.\"\n\nTo Jimmy's surprise, Bince agreed with him.  It was the first time that\nBince had agreed with anything Jimmy had suggested.\n\n\"Very well,\" assented Compton, \"but we'll preserve this bit of evidence\nin case we may need it later,\" and he handed the slip of paper to Edith\nHudson. \"File this, please, Miss Hudson,\" he said; and then, turning to\nBince:\n\n\"It may be nothing, but I don't like the idea of it.  There is apt to be\nsomething underlying this, or even if it is only a single individual and\nhe happens to be a crank he could cause a lot of trouble. Suppose, for\ninstance, one of these crack-brained foreigners in the shop got it into\nhis head that Torrance here was grinding him down in order to increase\nour profits? Why, he might attack him at any time! I tell you, we have\ngot to be prepared for such a contingency, especially now that we have\nconcrete evidence that there is such a man in our employ. I think you\nought to be armed, Mr. Torrance. Have you a pistol?\"\n\nJimmy shook his head negatively.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said; \"not here.\"\n\nCompton opened a desk drawer.\n\n\"Take this one,\" he said, and handed Jimmy an automatic.\n\nThe latter smiled.  \"Really, Mr. Compton,\" he said, \"I don't believe I\nneed such an article.\"\n\n\"I want you to take it,\" insisted Compton.  \"I want you to be on the\nsafe side.\"\n\nA moment later Bince and Jimmy left the office together.  Jimmy still\ncarried the pistol in his hand.\n\n\"You'd better put that thing in your pocket,\" cautioned Bince.\n\nThey were in the small office on which Compton's and Bince's offices\nopened, and Jimmy had stopped beside the desk that had been placed there\nfor him.\n\n\"I think I'll leave it here,\" he said. \"The thing would be a nuisance in\nmy pocket,\" and he dropped it into one of the desk drawers, while Bince\ncontinued his way toward the shop.\n\nCompton was looking through the papers and letters on his desk,\nevidently searching for something which he could not find, while the\ngirl sat waiting for him to continue his dictation.\n\n\"That's funny,\" commented Compton.\n\n\"I was certain that that letter was here.  Have you seen anything of a\nletter from Mosher?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Edith.\n\n\"Well, I wish you would step into Mr. Bince's office, and see if it is\non his desk.\"\n\nUpon the assistant general manager's desk lay a small pile of papers,\nface down, which Edith proceeded to examine in search of the Mosher\nletter. She had turned them all over at once, commencing at what had\npreviously been the bottom of the pile, so that she ran through them all\nwithout finding the Mosher letter before she came to Murray's epistle.\n\nAs its import dawned upon her, her eyes widened at first in surprise and\nthen narrowed as she realized the value of her discovery. At first she\nplaced the letter back with the others just as she had found them, but\non second thought she took it up quickly and, folding it, slipped it\ninside her waist. Then she returned to Compton's office.\n\n\"I cannot find the Mosher letter,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nLAID UP.\n\nHarriet Holden was sitting in Elizabeth's boudoir.  \"And he had the\neffrontery,\" the latter was saying, \"to tell me what I must do and must\nnot do! The idea! A miserable little milk-wagon driver dictating to me!\"\n\nMiss Holden smiled.\n\n\"I should not call him very little,\" she remarked.\n\n\"I didn't mean physically,\" retorted Elizabeth.  \"It is absolutely\ninsufferable. I am going to demand that father discharge the man.\"\n\n\"And suppose he asks you why?\" asked Harriet.  \"You will tell him, of\ncourse, that you want this person discharged because he protected you\nfrom the insults and attacks of a ruffian while you were dining in\nFeinheimer's at night--is that it?\"\n\n\"You are utterly impossible, Harriet!\" cried Elizabeth, stamping her\nfoot. \"You are as bad as that efficiency person. But, then, I might have\nexpected it! You have always, it seems to me, shown a great deal more\ninterest in the fellow than necessary, and probably the fact that Harold\ndoesn't like him is enough to make you partial toward him, for you have\nnever tried to hide the fact that you don't like Harold.\"\n\n\"If you're going to be cross,\" said Harriet, \"I think I shall go home.\"\n\nAt about the same time the Lizard entered Feinheimer's.  In the far\ncorner of the room Murray was seated at a table. The Lizard approached\nand sat down opposite him. \"Here I am,\" he said. \"What do you want, and\nhow did you know I was in town?\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said Murray.  \"I got a swell job for you, and so I sent\nout word to get you.\"\n\n\"You're in luck then,\" said the Lizard. \"I just blew in this morning.\nWhat kind of a job you got?\"\n\nMurray explained at length.\n\n\"They got a watchman,\" he concluded, \"but I've got a guy on de inside\nthat'll fix him.\"\n\n\"When do I pull this off?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"In about a week.  I'll let you know the night later.  Dey ordinarily\ndraw the payroll money Monday, the same day dey pay, but dis week\nthey'll draw it Saturday and leave it in the safe. It'll be layin' on\ntop of a bunch of books and papers. Dey're de t'ings you're to destroy.\nAs I told you, it will all be fixed from de inside. Dere's no danger of\na pinch. All you gotta do is crack de safe, put about a four or five\nt'ousand dollar roll in your pocket, and as you cross de river drop a\nhandful of books and papers in. Nothin' to it--it's the easiest graft\nyou ever had.\"\n\n\"You're sure dat's all?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"Sure thing!\" replied Murray.\n\n\"Where's de place?\"\n\n\"Dat I can't tell you until the day we're ready to pull off de job.\"\n\nAt four o'clock that afternoon Jimmy Torrance collapsed at his desk.\nThe flu had struck him as suddenly and as unexpectedly as it had\nattacked many of its victims. Edith Hudson found him, and immediately\nnotified Mr. Compton, with the result that half an hour later Jimmy\nTorrance was in a small private hospital in Park Avenue.\n\nThat night Bince got Murray over the phone.  He told him of Jimmy's\nsickness.\n\n\"He's balled up the whole plan,\" he complained.  \"We've either got to\nwait until he croaks or is out again before we can go ahead, unless\nsomething else arises to make it necessary to act before. I think I can\nhold things off, though, at this end, all right.\"\n\nFor four or five days Jimmy was a pretty sick man.  He was allowed to\nsee no one, but even if Jimmy had been in condition to give the matter\nany thought he would not have expected to see any one, for who was there\nto visit him in the hospital, who was there who knew of his illness, to\ncare whether he was sick or well, alive or dead? It was on the fifth day\nthat Jimmy commenced to take notice of anything. At Compton's orders he\nhad been placed in a private room and given a special nurse, and to-day\nfor the first time he learned of Mr. Compton's kindness and the fact\nthat the nurse was instructed to call Jimmy's employer twice a day and\nreport the patient's condition.\n\n\"Mighty nice of him,\" thought Jimmy, and then to the nurse: \"And the\nflowers, too? Does he send those?\"\n\nThe young woman shook her head negatively.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"a young lady comes every evening about six and leaves\nthe flowers. She always asks about your condition and when she may see\nyou.\"\n\nJimmy was silent for some time.  \"She comes every evening?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the nurse.\n\n\"May I see her this evening?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"We'll ask the doctor,\" she replied; and the doctor must have given\nconsent, for at six o'clock that evening the nurse brought Edith Hudson\nto his bedside.\n\nThe girl came every evening thereafter and sat with Jimmy as long as the\nnurse would permit her to remain. Jimmy discovered during those periods\na new side to her character, a mothering tenderness that filled him with\na feeling of content and happiness the moment that she entered the room,\nand which doubtless aided materially in his rapid convalescence, for\nuntil she had been permitted to see him Jimmy had suffered as much from\nmental depression as from any other of the symptoms of his disease.\n\nHe had felt utterly alone and uncared for, and in this mental state he\nhad brooded over his failures to such an extent that he had reached a\npoint where he felt that death would be something of a relief.\nMilitating against his recovery had been the parting words of Elizabeth\nCompton the evening that he had dined at her father's home, but now all\nthat was very nearly forgotten--at least crowded into the dim vistas of\nrecollection by the unselfish friendship of this girl of the streets.\n\nJimmy's nurse quite fell in love with Edith.\n\n\"She is such a sweet girl,\" she said, \"and always so cheerful.  She is\ngoing to make some one a mighty good wife,\" and she smiled knowingly at\nJimmy.\n\nThe suggestion which her words implied came to Jimmy as a distinct\nshock. He had never thought of Edith Hudson in the light of this\nsuggestion, and now he wondered if there could be any such sentiment as\nit implied in Edith's heart, but finally he put the idea away with a\nshrug.\n\n\"Impossible,\" he thought. \"She thinks of me as I think of her, only as a\ngood friend.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nIN THE TOILS.\n\nAt the office of the International Machine Company the work of the\nC.P.A.'s was drawing to a close. Their report would soon be ready to\nsubmit to Mr. Compton, and as the time approached Bince's nervousness\nand irritability increased. Edith noticed that he inquired each day with\ngrowing solicitude as to the reports from the hospital relative to\nJimmy's condition. She knew that Bince disliked Jimmy, and yet the man\nseemed strangely anxious for his recovery and return to work.\n\nIn accordance with Jimmy's plan, the C.P.A.'s were to give out no\ninformation to any one, even to Mr. Compton, until their investigation\nand report were entirely completed. This plan had been approved by Mr.\nCompton, although he professed to be at considerable loss to understand\nwhy it was necessary. It was, however, in accordance with Jimmy's plan\nto prevent, if possible, any interference with the work of the auditors\nuntil every available fact in the case had been ascertained and\nrecorded.\n\nIn the investigation of the pay-roll Bince had worked diligently with\nthe accountants. As a matter of fact, he had never left them a moment\nwhile the pay-roll records were in their hands, and had gone to much\npain to explain in detail every question arising therefrom.\n\nAlthough the investigators seemed to accept his statements at their face\nvalue, the assistant general manager was far from being assured that\ntheir final report would redound to his credit.\n\nOn a Thursday they informed him that they had completed their\ninvestigation, and the report would be submitted to Mr. Compton on\nSaturday.\n\nWhen Edith reached the hospital that evening she found Jimmy in high\nspirits. He was dressed for the first time, and assured her that he was\nquite able to return to work if the doctor would let him, but the nurse\nshook her head. \"You ought to stay here for another week or ten days,\"\nshe admonished him.\n\n\"Nothing doing,\"' cried Jimmy.  \"I'll be out of here Monday at the\nlatest.\" But when Edith told him that the C.P.A.'s had finished, and\nthat their report would be handed in Saturday, Jimmy announced that he\nwould leave the hospital the following day.\n\n\"But you can't do it,\" said the nurse.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jimmy.\n\n\"The doctor won't permit it.\"\n\nEdith tried to dissuade him, but he insisted that it was absolutely\nnecessary for him to be at the office when the C.P.A.'s report was made.\n\n\"I'll be over there Friday evening or Saturday morning at the latest,\"\nhe said as she bid him good-bye.\n\nAnd so it was that, despite the pleas of his nurse and the orders of his\nphysician, Jimmy appeared at the plant Friday afternoon. Bince greeted\nhim almost effusively, and Mr. Compton seemed glad to see him out again.\n\nThat evening Harold Bince met Murray at Feinheimer's, and still later\nthe Lizard received word that Murray wanted to see him.\n\n\"Everything's ready,\" the boss explained to the Lizard. \"The whole\nthing's framed for to-morrow night. The watchman was discharged to-day.\nAnother man is supposed to have been hired to take the job, but of\ncourse he won't show up. You meet me here at seven thirty to-morrow\nnight, and I'll give you your final instructions and tell you how to get\nto the plant.\" The C.P.A.'s were slow in completing their report. At\nnoon on Saturday it looked very much to Bince that there would be no\nreport ready before Monday. He had spent most of the forenoon pacing his\noffice, and at last, unable longer to stand the strain, he had announced\nthat he was going out to his country club for a game of golf.\n\nHe returned to his down-town club about dinner-time, and at eight\no'clock he called up Elizabeth Compton.\n\n\"Come on up,\" said the girl. \"I'm all alone this evening.  Father went\nback to the office to examine some reports that were just finished up\nlate this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'll be over,\" said Bince, \"as soon as I dress.\" If there was any trace\nof surprise or shock in his tones the girl failed to notice it.\n\nAt ten o'clock that night a figure moved silently through the dark\nshadows of an alleyway in the area of the International Machine\nCompany's plant on West Superior Street. As he moved along he counted\nthe basement windows silently, and at the fifth window he halted. Just a\ncasual glance he cast up and down the alley, and then, kneeling, he\nraised the sash and slipped quietly into the darkness of the basement.\n\nAt about the same time Jimmy's landlady called him to the telephone,\nwhere a man's voice asked if \"this was Mr. Torrance?\" Assured that such\nwas the fact, the voice continued: \"I am the new watchman at the plant.\nThere's something wrong here. I can't get hold of Mr. Compton. I think\nyou better come down. I'll be in Mr. Compton's office--\" The message\nceased as though central had disconnected them.\n\n\"Funny,\" thought Jimmy, \"that he should call me up. I wonder what the\ntrouble can be.\" But he lost no time in getting his hat and starting for\nthe works.\n\nAlthough the Lizard knew that there was no danger of detection, yet from\nlong habit he moved through the plant of the International Machine\nCompany with the noiselessness of a disembodied spirit. Occasionally,\nand just for the briefest instant, he flashed his lamp ahead of him, but\nthough he had never been in the place before he found it scarcely\nnecessary, so minute had been his instructions for reaching the office\nfrom the fifth basement window.\n\nThe room he sought was on the second floor, and the Lizard had mounted\nthe steps from the basement to the first floor when he was brought to a\nsudden stop by a noise from the floor above him. The Lizard listened\nintently. No, he could not be mistaken. Too often had he heard a similar\nsound.\n\nSome one was tiptoeing across the floor above.  The Lizard was in the\nhallway close beside the stairs when he realized the footsteps were\ncoming toward the stairway, and a moment later that they were cautiously\ndescending. The Lizard flattened himself against the wall, and if he\nbreathed his lungs gave forth no sound.\n\nIf one may interpret footsteps--and the Lizard, from the fund of a\ngreat experience, felt that he could--those descending the stairway\nfrom above him might have been described as nervous and repressed; for\nat least they gave the Lizard the impression of one who desired to flee\nin haste and yet dared not do so, for fear of attracting attention by\nthe increased noise that greater speed might entail.\n\nAt least the Lizard knew that those were the footsteps of no watchman,\nbut whether it be guardian of the law or fellow criminal the Lizard had\nno wish to be discovered. He wondered what had gone wrong with Murray's\nplans, and, suddenly imbued with the natural suspicion of the criminal,\nit occurred to him that the whole thing might be a frame-up to get him;\nand yet why Murray should wish to get him he could not imagine. He ran\nover in his mind a list of all those who might feel enmity toward him, but\namong them all the Lizard could cast upon none who might have sufficient\nagainst him to warrant such an elaborate scheme of revenge.\n\nThe footsteps passed him and continued on toward the foot of the stairs\nwhere was the main entrance which opened upon the street. At the door\nthe footsteps halted, and as the Lizard's eyes bored through the\ndarkness in the direction of the other prowler the latter struck a match\nupon the panel of the door and lighted a cigarette, revealing his\nfeatures momentarily but distinctly to the watcher in the shadow of the\nstairway. Then he opened the door and passed out into the night.\n\nThe Lizard, listening intently for a few moments to assure himself that\nthere was no one else above, and that the man who had just departed was\nnot returning, at last continued his way to the foot of the stairs,\nwhich he ascended to the second floor. Passing through the outer office,\nhe paused a moment before the door to Compton's private office, and then\nsilently turning the knob he gently pushed the door open and stepped\ninto the room.\n\nBeyond the threshold he halted and pressed the button of his flash-lamp.\nFor just an instant its faint rays illumined the interior of the room,\nand then darkness blotted out the scene. But whatever it was that the\nlittle flash-lamp had revealed was evidently in the nature of a\nsurprise, and perhaps something of a shock, to the Lizard, for he drew\nback with a muttered oath, backed quietly out of the room, closed the\ndoor after him, and, moving much more swiftly than he had entered,\nretraced his steps to the fifth window on the alley, and was gone from\nthe scene with whatever job he had contemplated unexecuted.\n\nA half-hour later detective headquarters at the Central Station received\nan anonymous tip: \"Send some one to the office of the International\nMachine Company, on the second floor of West Superior Street.\"\n\nIt was ten thirty when Jimmy reached the plant.  He entered the front\ndoor with his own latchkey, pressed the button which lighted the\nstairway and the landing above, and, ascending, went straight to Mr.\nCompton's office, turned the knob, and opened the door, to find that the\ninterior was dark.\n\n \"Strange,\" he thought, \"that after sending for me the fellow didn't\n wait.\" As these thoughts passed through his mind he fumbled on the wall\n for the switch, and, finding it, flooded the office with light.\n\nAs he turned again toward the room he voiced a sudden exclamation of\nhorror, for on the floor beside his desk lay the body of Mason Compton!\nAs Jimmy stepped quickly toward Compton's body and kneeled beside it a\nman tiptoed quietly up the front stairway, while another, having\nascended from the rear, was crossing the outer office with equal\nstealth.\n\nJimmy felt of Compton's face and hands.  They were warm.  And then he\nplaced his ear close against the man's breast, in order to see if he\ncould detect the beating of the heart. He was in this position when he\nwas startled by a gruff voice behind him.\n\n\"Put 'em up!\" it admonished curtly, and Jimmy turned to see two men\nstanding in the doorway with pistols leveled at him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nCIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n\nAt first Jimmy thought they were the perpetrators of the deed, but\nalmost immediately he recognized one of them as O'Donnell, the erstwhile\ntraffic officer who had been promoted to a detective sergeancy since\nJimmy had first met him.\n\n\"Compton has been murdered,\" said Jimmy dully. \"He is dead.\"\n\n\"Put up your hands,\" snapped O'Donnell for the second time, \"and be\nquick about it!\"\n\nIt was then for the first time that Jimmy realized the meaning that\nmight be put upon his presence alone in the office with his dead\nemployer. O'Donnell's partner searched him, but found no weapon upon\nhim.\n\n\"Where's the gat?\" he asked.\n\n\"Whoever did this probably took it with him,\" said Jimmy. \"Find the\nwatchman.\"\n\nThey made Jimmy sit down in a corner, and while one of them guarded him\nthe other called up central, made his report, and asked for an ambulance\nand the wagon. Then O'Donnell commenced to examine the room. A moment\nlater he found an automatic behind the door across the room from where\nCompton's body lay.\n\n\"Ever see this before?\" asked O'Donnell, holding the pistol up to Jimmy.\n\n\"If you're asking me if it's mine, no,\" said Jimmy.  \"I have a gun, but\nit's home. I never carry it. I didn't do this, O'Donnell,\" he continued.\n\"There was no reason why I should do it, so instead of wasting your time\non me while the murderer escapes you'd better get busy on some other\ntheory, too. It won't do any harm, anyway.\"\n\nThe wagon came and took Jimmy to the station, and later he was\nquestioned by the lieutenant in charge.\n\n\"You say this is not your pistol?\" asked the police officer.\n\n\"It is not,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"You never saw it before?\"\n\n\"No, I have not.\"\n\nThe lieutenant turned to one of his men, who went to the door, and,\nopening it, returned almost immediately with Bince.\n\n\"Do you know this man, Mr. Bince?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"I certainly do,\" said Bince.\n\n\"Did you ever see this pistol before?\"\n\nBince took the weapon and examined it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Under what circumstances?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"It was one of two that Mr. Compton had in his desk.  This one he loaned\nto Torrance two or three weeks ago. I was in the office at the time.\"\n\nThe officer turned toward Jimmy.\n\n\"Now do you recognize it?\" he asked.\n\n\"I haven't denied,\" said Jimmy, \"that Mr. Compton had loaned me a\npistol. As a matter of fact, I had forgotten all about it. I do not\nparticularly recognize this one as the weapon he loaned me, though it is\nof the same type. There is no way that I could identify the particular\nweapon he handed me.\"\n\n\"But you admit he loaned you one?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"What did you do with it?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"I put it in my desk within five minutes after he gave it to me, and I\nhaven't seen it since.\"\n\n\"You say you couldn't identify the pistol?\" said the officer.\n\nJimmy nodded.\n\n\"Well, we can, and have.  The number of this pistol was recorded when\nMr. Compton bought it, as was the number of the other one which is still\nin his desk. They were the only two pistols he ever bought, according to\nMr. Bince, and his daughter, aside from one which he had at home, which\nhas also been accounted for. The drawer in which Mr. Bince saw you place\nthis pistol we found open and the pistol gone. It looks pretty bad for\nyou, young fellow, and if you want a chance to dodge the rope you'd\nbetter plead guilty and tell us why you did it.\"\n\nJimmy was given little opportunity for sleep that night.  A half-dozen\ntimes he was called back to the lieutenant's office for further\nquestioning. He commenced to realize that the circumstantial evidence\nwas strongly against him, and now, as the girl had warned him, his\nentirely innocent past was brought up against him simply because his\nexistence had been called to the attention of a policeman, and the same\npoliceman an inscrutable Fate had ordained should discover him alone\nwith a murdered man.\n\nO'Donnell made the most of his meager knowledge of Jimmy.  He told the\nlieutenant with embellishments of Jimmy's association with such\ncharacters as the Lizard and Little Eva; but the police were still at a\nloss to discover a motive.\n\nThis, however, was furnished the next morning, when Elizabeth Compton,\nwhite and heavy-eyed, was brought to the station to identify Jimmy.\nThere was deep compassion in the young man's face as he was ushered into\nthe presence of the stricken girl, while at sight of him hers mirrored\nhorror, contempt, and hatred.\n\n\"You know this man?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"His name is Torrance.  I have seen him a number of\ntimes in the past year. He worked as a clerk in a store, in the hosiery\ndepartment, and waited on me there. Later I\"--she hesitated--\"I saw\nhim in a place called Feinheimer's. He was a waiter. Then he was a\nsparring partner, I think they call it, for a prizefighter. Some of my\nfriends took me to a gymnasium to see the fighter training, and I\nrecognized this man.\n\n\"I saw him again when he was driving a milk-wagon.  He  delivered milk\nat a friend's house where I chanced to be. The last time I saw him was\nat my father's home. He had obtained employment in my father's plant as\nan efficiency expert. He seemed to exercise some strange power over\nfather, who believed implicitly in him, until recently, when he\nevidently commenced to have doubts; for the night that the man was at\nour house I was sitting in the music-room when they passed through the\nhallway, and I heard father discharge him. But the fellow pleaded to be\nretained, and finally father promised to keep him for a while longer, as\nI recall it, at least until certain work was completed at the plant.\nThis work was completed yesterday. That's all I know. I do not know\nwhether father discharged him again or not.\"\n\nHarriet Holden had accompanied her friend to the police station, and was\nsitting close beside her during the examination, her eyes almost\nconstantly upon the face of the prisoner. She saw no fear there, only an\nexpression of deep-seated sorrow for her friend.\n\nThe lieutenant was still asking questions when there came a knock at the\ndoor, which was immediately opened, revealing O'Donnell with a young\nwoman, whom he brought inside.\n\n\"I guess we're getting to the bottom of it,\" announced the sergeant.\n\"Look who I found workin' over there as Compton's stenographer.\"\n\n\"Well, who is she?\" demanded the lieutenant.\n\n\"A jane who used to hang out at Feinheimer's.  She has been runnin'\naround with this bird. They tell me over there that Compton hired her on\nthis fellow's recommendation. Get hold of the Lizard now, and you'll\nhave the whole bunch.\"\n\nThus did Sergeant Patrick O'Donnell solve the entire mystery with\nSherlockian ease and despatch.\n\nAt Jimmy's preliminary hearing he was held to the grand jury, and on the\nstrength of the circumstantial evidence against him that body voted a\ntrue bill. Edith Hudson, against whom there was no evidence of any\nnature, was held as a witness for the State, and a net was thrown out\nfor the Lizard which dragged in nearly every pickpocket in town except\nthe man they sought.\n\nJimmy had been in jail for about a week when he received a visitor.  A\nturnkey brought her to his cell. It was Harriet Holden. She greeted him\nseriously but pleasantly, and then she asked the turnkey if she might go\ninside.\n\n\"It's against the rules, miss,\" he said, \"but I guess it will be all\nright.\" He recalled that the sheriff had said that the girl's father was\na friend of his, and so assumed that it would be safe to relax the rules\nin her behalf. He had been too long an employee of the county not to\nknow that rules are often elastic to the proper pressure.\n\n\"I have been wanting to talk to you,\" said the girl to Jimmy, \"ever\nsince this terrible thing happened. Somehow I can not believe that you\nare guilty, and there must be some way in which you can prove your\ninnocence.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to think out how I might,\" said Jimmy, \"but the more\nI think about it the more damning the circumstantial evidence against me\nappears.\"\n\n\"There must always be a motive for a crime like that,\" said Harriet.  \"I\ncannot believe that a simple fear of his discharge would be sufficient\nmotive for any man to kill his employer.\"\n\n\"Not to kill a man who had been as good to me as Mr. Compton was,\" said\nJimmy, \"or a man whom I admired so much as I did him. As a matter of\nfact, he was not going to discharge me, Miss Holden, and I had an\nopportunity there for a very successful future; but now that he is dead\nthere is no one who could verify such a statement on my part.\"\n\n\"Who could there be, then, who might wish to kill him, and what could\nthe motive be?\"\n\n\"I can only think,\" said Jimmy, \"of one man; and even in his case the\nidea is too horrible--too preposterous to be entertained.\"\n\nHarriet Holden looked up at him quickly, a sudden light in her eyes, and\nan expression of almost horrified incredulity upon her face. \"You don't\nmean--\" she started.\n\n\"I wouldn't even use his name in connection with the thought,\" Jimmy\ninterrupted; \"but he is the only man of whom I know who could have\nprofited by Mr. Compton's death, and, on the other hand, whose entire\nfuture would have been blasted possibly had Mr. Compton lived until the\nfollowing morning.\"\n\nThe girl remained for half an hour longer, and when she left she went\ndirectly to the home of Elizabeth Compton.\n\n\"I told you, Elizabeth,\" she said, \"that I was going to see Mr.\nTorrance. You dissuaded me for some time, but I finally went today, and\nI am glad that I went. No one except yourself could have loved your\nfather more than I, or have been more horrified or grieved at his death;\nbut that is no reason why you should aid in the punishment of an\ninnocent man, as I am confident that this man Torrance is, and I tell\nyou Elizabeth if you were not prejudiced you would agree with me.\n\n\"I have talked with Torrance for over half an hour to-day, and since\nthen nothing can ever make me believe that that man could commit a\ncold-blooded murder. Harold has always hated him--you admit that\nyourself--and now you are permitting him to prejudice you against the\nman purely on the strength of that dislike. I am going to help him. I'm\ngoing to do it, not only to obtain justice for him, but to assist in\ndetecting and punishing the true murderer.\"\n\n\"I don't see, Harriet, how you can take any interest in such a\ncreature,\" said Elizabeth. \"You know from the circumstances under which\nwe saw him before father employed him what type of man he is, and it was\nfurther exemplified by the evidence of his relationship with that common\nwoman of the streets.\"\n\n\"He told me about her to-day,\" replied Harriet. \"He had only known her\nvery casually, but she helped him once--loaned him some money when he\nneeded it---and when he found that she had been a stenographer and\nwanted to give up the life she had been leading and be straight again,\nhe helped her.\n\n\"I asked Sergeant O'Donnell particularly about that, and even he had to\nadmit that there was no evidence whatever to implicate the girl or show\nthat the relations between her and Mr. Torrance had been anything that\nwas not right; and you know yourself how anxious O'Donnell has been to\ndig up evidence of any kind derogatory to either of them.\"\n\n\"How are you going to help him?\" asked Elizabeth.  \"Take flowers and\ncake to him in jail?\"\n\nThere was a sneer on her face and on her lips. \"If he cares for flowers\nand cakes,\" replied Harriet, \"I probably shall; but I have another plan\nwhich will probably be more practical.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\"THE ONLY FRIENDS HE HAS.\"\n\nSo it befell that the next day a well-known criminal attorney called on\nJimmy Torrance at the county jail. \"I understand,\" he said to Jimmy,\n\"that you have retained no attorney. I have been instructed by one of my\nclients to take your case.\"\n\nJimmy looked at him in silence for a moment.\n\n\"Who is going to pay you?\" he asked with a smile.  \"I understand\nattorneys expect to be paid.\"\n\n\"That needn't worry you!\" replied the lawyer.\n\n\"You mean that your client is going to pay for my defense?  What's his\nname?\"\n\n\"That I am not permitted to tell you,\" replied the lawyer.\n\n\"Very well.  Tell your client that I appreciate his kindness, but I\ncannot accept it.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" said the attorney. \"This client of mine can well\nafford the expense, and anyway, my instructions are to defend you\nwhether you want me to or not, so I guess you can't help yourself.\"\n\nJimmy laughed with the lawyer. \"All right,\" he said. \"The first thing I\nwish you'd do is to get Miss Hudson out of jail. There is doubtless some\nreason for suspicion attaching to me because I was found alone with Mr.\nCompton's body, and the pistol with which he was shot was one that had\nbeen given to me and which I kept in my desk, but there is no earthly\nreason why she should be detained. She could have had absolutely nothing\nto do with it.\"\n\n\"I will see what can be done,\" replied the attorney, \"although I had no\ninstructions to defend her also.\"\n\n\"I will make that one of the conditions under which I will accept your\nservices,\" said Jimmy.\n\nThe result was that within a few days Edith was released.  From the\nmoment that she left the jail she was aware that she was being shadowed.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she thought, \"that they expect to open up a fund of new\nclues through me,\" but she was disturbed nevertheless, because she\nrealized that it was going to make difficult a thing that she had been\ntrying to find some means to accomplish ever since she had been\narrested.\n\nShe went directly to her apartment and presently took down the\ntelephone-receiver, and after calling a public phone in a building\ndown-town, she listened intently while the operator was getting her\nconnection, and before the connection was made she hung up the receiver\nwith a smile, for she had distinctly heard the sound of a man's\nbreathing over the line, and she knew that in all probability O'Donnell\nhad tapped in immediately on learning that she had been released from\njail.\n\nThat evening she attended a local motion-picture theater which she often\nfrequented. It was one of those small affairs, the width of a city\nblock, with a narrow aisle running down either side and an emergency\nexit upon the alley at the far end of each aisle. The theater was\ndarkened when she entered and, a quick glance apprizing her that no one\nfollowed her in immediately, she continued on down one of the side\naisles and passed through the doorway into the alley.\n\nFive minutes later she was in a telephone-booth in a drug-store two\nblocks away.\n\n\"Is this Feinheimer's?\" she asked after she had got her connection. \"I\nwant to talk to Carl.\" She asked for Carl because she knew that this man\nwho had been head-waiter at Feinheimer's for years would know her voice.\n\n\"Is that you, Carl?\" she asked as a man's voice finally answered the\ntelephone. \"This is Little Eva.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello!\" said the man. \"I thought you were over at the county jail.\"\n\n\"I was released to-day,\" she explained.  \"Well, listen, Carl; I've got\nto see the Lizard. I've simply got to see him to-night. I was being\nshadowed, but I got away from them. Do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"I guess I could find him,\" said Carl in a low voice. \"You go out to\nMother Kruger's. I'll tell him you'll be there in about an hour.\"\n\n\"I'll be waiting in a taxi outside,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Good,\" said Carl. \"If he isn't there in an hour you can know that he\nwas afraid to come. He's layin' pretty low.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the girl, \"I'll be there.  You tell him that he simply\nmust come.\" She hung up the receiver and then called a taxi. She gave a\nnumber on a side street about a half block away, where she knew it would\nbe reasonably dark, and consequently less danger of detection.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later her taxi drew up beside Mother Kruger's,\nbut the girl did not alight. She had waited but a short time when\nanother taxi swung in beside the road-house, turned around and backed up\nalongside hers. A man stepped out and peered through the glass of her\nmachine. It was the Lizard.\n\nRecognizing the girl he opened the door and took a seat beside her.\n\"Well,\" inquired the Lizard, \"What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Jimmy,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"I thought so,\"  returned the Lizard.  \"It looks pretty bad for him,\ndon't it? I wish there was some way to help him.\"\n\n\"He did not do it,\" said the girl.\n\n\"It didn't seem like him,\" said the Lizard, \"but I got it straight from\na guy who knows that he done it all right.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Edith.\n\n\"Murray.\"\n\n\"I thought he knew a lot about it,\" said the girl. \"That's why I sent\nfor you. You haven't got any love for Murray, have you?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Lizard; \"not so you could notice it.\"\n\n\"I think Murray knows a lot about that job.  If you want to help Jimmy I\nknow where you can get the dope that will start something, anyway.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the Lizard.\n\n\"This fellow Bince, who is assistant general manager for Compton, got a\nletter from Murray two or three weeks before Compton was killed. Murray\nenclosed a threat signed I.W.W., and his letter instructed Bince to show\nthe threat to Compton. I haven't got all the dope on it, but I've got a\nhunch that in some way it is connected with this job. Anyway, I've got\nboth Murray's letter and the threat he enclosed. They're hidden in my\ndesk at the plant. I can't get them, of course; they wouldn't let me in\nthe place now, and Murray's so strong with the police that I wouldn't\ntrust them, so I haven't told any one. What I want is for you to go\nthere to-night and get them.\"\n\nThe Lizard was thinking fast.  The girl knew nothing of his connection\nwith the job. She did not know that he had entered Compton's office and\nhad been first to find his dead body; in fact, no one knew that. Even\nMurray did not know that the Lizard had succeeded in entering the plant,\nas the latter had told him that he was delayed, and that when he reached\nthere a patrol and ambulance were already backed up in front of the\nbuilding. He felt that he had enough knowledge, however, to make the\nconviction of Jimmy a very difficult proposition, but if he divulged the\nknowledge he had and explained how he came by it he could readily see\nthat suspicion would be at once transferred from Jimmy to himself.\n\nThe Lizard therefore was in a quandary.  Of course, if Murray's\nconnection was ever discovered the Lizard might then be drawn into it,\nbut if he could keep Murray out the Lizard would be reasonably safe from\nsuspicion, and now the girl had shown him how he might remove a damaging\npiece of evidence against Murray.\n\n\"You will get it, won't you?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Where are these papers?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are in the outer office which adjoins Mr. Compton's.  My desk\nstands at the right of the door as you enter from the main office.\nRemove the right-hand lower drawer and you will find the papers lying on\nthe little wooden partition directly underneath the drawer.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Lizard; \"I'll get them.\"\n\n\"Bless you, Lizard,\" cried the girl. \"I knew you would help. You and I\nare the only friends he has. If we went back on him he'd be sent up, for\nthere's lots of money being used against him. He might even be hanged. I\nknow from what I have heard that the prosecuting attorney intends to ask\nfor the death penalty.\"\n\nThe Lizard made no reply as he started to leave the taxi.\n\n\"Take them to his attorney,\" said the girl, and she gave him the name\nand address.\n\nThe Lizard grunted and entered his own cab.  As he did so a man on a\nmotorcycle drew up on the opposite side and peered through the window.\nThe driver had started his motor as the newcomer approached. From her\ncab the girl saw the Lizard and the man on the motorcycle look into each\nother's face for a moment, then she heard the Lizard's quick admonition\nto his driver, \"Beat it, bo!\"\n\nA sharp \"Halt!\" came from the man on the motorcycle, but the taxicab\nleaped forward, and, accelerating rapidly, turned to the left into the\nroad toward the city. The girl had guessed at the first glance that the\nman on the motorcycle was a police officer. As the Lizard's taxi raced\naway the officer circled quickly and started in pursuit. \"No chance,\"\nthought the girl. \"He'll get caught sure.\" She could hear the staccato\nreports from the open exhaust of the motorcycle diminishing rapidly in\nthe distance, indicating the speed of the pursued and the pursuer.\n\nAnd then from the distance came a shot and then another and another.\nShe leaned forward and spoke to her own driver. \"Go on to Elmhurst,\" she\nsaid, \"and then come back to the city on the St. Charles Road.\"\n\nIt was after two o'clock in the morning when the Lizard entered an\napartment on Ashland Avenue which he had for several years used as a\nhiding-place when the police were hot upon his trail. The people from\nwhom he rented the room were eminently respectable Jews who thought\ntheir occasional roomer what he represented himself to be, a special\nagent for one of the federal departments, a vocation which naturally\nexplained the Lizard's long absences and unusual hours.\n\nOnce within his room the Lizard sank into a chair and wiped the\nperspiration from his forehead, although it was by no means a warm\nnight. He drew a folded paper from his inside pocket, which, when\nopened, revealed a small piece of wrapping paper within. They were\nMurray's letter to Bince and the enclosure.\n\n\"Believe me,\" muttered the Lizard, \"that was the toughest job I ever\npulled off and all I gets is two pieces of paper, but I don't know but\nwhat they're worth it.\"\n\nHe sat for a long time looking at the papers in his hand, but he did not\nsee them. He was thinking of other things: of prison walls that he had\neluded so far through years of crime; of O'Donnell, whom he knew to be\nworking on the Compton case and whose boast it had been that sooner or\nlater he would get the Lizard; of what might naturally be expected were\nthe papers in his hands to fall into the possession of Torrance's\nattorney. It would mean that Murray would be immediately placed in\njeopardy, and the Lizard knew Murray well enough to know that he would\nsacrifice his best friend to save himself, and the Lizard was by no\nmeans Murray's best friend.\n\nHe realized that he knew more about the Compton murder case than any one\nelse. He was of the opinion that he could clear it up if he were almost\nany one other than the Lizard, but with the record of his past life\nagainst him, would any one believe him? In order to prove his assertion\nit would be necessary to make admissions that might incriminate himself,\nand there would be Murray and the Compton millions against him; and as\nhe pondered these things there ran always through his mind the words of\nthe girl, \"You and I are the only friends he has.\"\n\n\"Hell,\" ejaculated the Lizard as he rose from his chair and prepared for\nbed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nTHE TRIAL.\n\nEdith Hudson spent a restless night, and early in the morning, as early\nas she thought she could reach him, she called the office of Jimmy's\nattorney. She told the lawyer that some new evidence was to have been\nbrought in to him and asked if he had received it. Receiving a negative\nreply she asked that she be called the moment it was brought in.\n\nAll that day and the next she waited, scarcely leaving her room for fear\nthat the call might come while she was away. The days ran into weeks and\nstill there was no word from the Lizard.\n\nJimmy was brought to trial, and she saw him daily in the courtroom and\nas often as they would let her she would visit him in jail. On several\noccasions she met Harriet Holden, also visiting him, and she saw that\nthe other young woman was as constant an attendant at court as she.\n\nThe State had established as unassailable a case as might be built on\ncircumstantial evidence. Krovac had testified that Torrance had made\nthreats against Compton in his presence, and there was no way in which\nJimmy's attorneys could refute the perjured statement. Jimmy himself had\ncome to realize that his attorney was fighting now for his life, that\nthe verdict of the jury was already a foregone conclusion and that the\nonly thing left to fight for now was the question of the penalty.\n\nDaily he saw in the court-room the faces of the three girls who had\nentered so strangely into his life. He noticed, with not a little sorrow\nand regret, that Elizabeth Compton and Harriet Holden always sat apart\nand that they no longer spoke. He saw the effect of the strain of the\nlong trial on Edith Hudson. She looked wan and worried, and then finally\nshe was not in court one day, and later, through Harriet Holden, he\nlearned that she was confined to her room with a bad cold.\n\nJimmy's sentiments toward the three women whose interests brought them\ndaily to the court-room had undergone considerable change. The girl that\nhe had put upon a pedestal to worship from afar, the girl to whom he had\ngiven an idealistic love, he saw now in another light. His reverence for\nher had died hard, but in the face of her arrogance, her vindictiveness\nand her petty snobbery it had finally succumbed, so that when he\ncompared her with the girl who had been of the street the latter\nsuffered in no way by the comparison.\n\nHarriet Holden's friendship and loyalty were a never-ending source of\nwonderment to him, but he accepted her own explanation, which, indeed,\nwas fair enough, that her innate sense of justice had compelled her to\ngive him her sympathy and assistance.\n\nJust how far that assistance had gone Jimmy did not know, though of late\nhe had come to suspect that his attorney was being retained by Harriet\nHolden's father.\n\nBince appeared in the court-room only when necessity compelled his\npresence on the witness stand. The nature of the man's testimony was\nsuch that, like Krovac's, it was difficult of impeachment, although\nJimmy was positive that Bince perjured himself, especially in a\nstatement that he made of a conversation he had with Mr. Compton the\nmorning of the murder, in which he swore that Compton stated that he\nintended to discharge Torrance that day.\n\nThe effect of the trial seemed to have made greater inroads upon Bince\nthan upon Jimmy. The latter gave no indication of nervous depression or\nof worry, while Bince, on the other hand, was thin, pale and haggard.\nHis hands and face continually moved and twitched as he sat in the\ncourtroom or on the witness chair. Never for an instant was he at rest.\n\nElizabeth Compton had noticed this fact, too, and commented upon it one\nevening when Bince was at her home.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Harold?\" she asked.  \"You look as though\nyou are on the verge of nervous prostration.\"\n\n\"I've had enough to make any man nervous,\" retorted Bince irritably.  \"I\ncan't get over this terrible affair, and in addition I have had all the\nweight and responsibility of the business on my shoulders since, and the\nstraightening out of your father's estate, which, by the way, was in\npretty bad shape.\n\n\"I wish, Elizabeth,\" he went on, \"that we might be married immediately.\nI have asked you so many times before, however, and you have always\nrefused, that I suppose it is useless now. I believe that I would get\nover this nervous condition if you and I were settled down here\ntogether. I have no real home, as you know--the club is just a\nstopping place. I might as well be living at a hotel. If after the day's\nwork I could come home to a regular home it would do me a world of good,\nI know. We could be married quietly. There is every reason why we\nshould, especially now that you are left all alone.\"\n\n\"Just what do you mean by immediately?\" she asked.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he replied.\n\nFor a long time she demurred, but finally she acceded to his wishes, for\nan early marriage, though she would not listen to the ceremony being\nperformed the following day. They reached a compromise on Friday\nmorning, a delay of only a few days, and Harold Bince breathed more\nfreely thereafter than he had for a long time before.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Harold Bince entered the court-room late on Friday morning\nfollowing the brief ceremony that had made them man and wife. It had\nbeen generally supposed that to-day the case would go to the jury as the\nevidence was all in, and the final arguments of the attorneys, which had\nstarted the preceding day, would be concluded during the morning\nsession. It had been conceded that the judge's charge would be brief and\nperfunctory, and there was even hope that the jury might return a\nverdict before the close of the afternoon session, but when Bince and\nhis bride entered the court-room they found Torrance's attorney making a\nmotion for the admission of new evidence on the strength of the recent\ndiscovery of witnesses, the evidence of whom he claimed would materially\nalter the aspect of the case.\n\nAn hour was consumed in argument before the judge finally granted the\nmotion. The first of the new witnesses called was an employee of the\nInternational Machine Company. After the usual preliminary questions the\nattorney for the defense asked him if he was employed in the plant on\nthe afternoon of March 24. The reply was in the affirmative.\n\n\"Will you tell the jury, please, of any occurrence that you witnessed\nthere that afternoon out of the ordinary?\"\n\n\"I was working at my machine,\" said the witness, \"when Pete Krovac comes\nto me and asks me to hide behind a big drill-press and watch what the\nassistant general manager done when he comes through the shop again. So\nI hides there and I saw this man Bince come along and drop an envelope\nbeside Krovac's machine, and after he left I comes out as Krovac picks\nit up, and I seen him take some money out of it.\"\n\n\"How much money?\" asked the attorney.\n\n\"There was fifty dollars there.  He counted it in front of me.\"\n\n\"Did he say what it was for?\"\n\n\"Yes, he said Bince gave it to him to croak this fellow\"--nodding\ntoward Jimmy.\n\n\"What fellow?\" asked the attorney.  \"You mean Mr. Torrance, the\ndefendant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And what else?  What happened after that?\"\n\n\"Krovac said he'd split it with me if I'd go along and help him.\"\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"The guy beat up Krovac and come near croaking me, and got away.\"\n\n\"That is all,\" said the attorney.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney, whose repeated objections to the testimony of\nthe witness had been overruled, waived cross-examination.\n\nTurning to the clerk, \"Please call Stephen Murray,\" said Jimmy's\nattorney.\n\nMurray, burly and swaggering, took the witness chair.  The attorney\nhanded him a letter. It was the letter that Murray had written Bince\nenclosing the supposed I.W.W. threat.\n\n\"Did you ever see that before?\" he asked.\n\nMurray took the letter and read it over several times.  He was trying to\nsee in it anything which could possibly prove damaging to him.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said at last in a blustering tone of voice.  \"I wrote it.\nBut what of it?\"\n\n\"And this enclosure?\" asked the attorney. He handed Murray the slip\nof soiled wrapping paper with the threat lettered upon it. \"This was\nreceived with your letter.\"\n\nMurray hesitated before replying.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"that ain't nothing.\nThat was just a little joke.\"\n\n\"You were seen in Feinheimer's with Mr. Bince on March--Do you recall\nthe object of this meeting?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bince thought there was going to be a strike at his plant and he\nwanted me to fix it up for him,\" replied Murray.\n\n\"You know the defendant, James Torrance?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Didn't he knock you down once for insulting a girl?\"  Murray flushed,\nbut was compelled to admit the truth of the allegation.\n\n\"You haven't got much use for him, have you?\" continued the attorney.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" replied Murray.\n\n\"You called the defendant on the telephone a half or three-quarters of\nan hour before the police discovered Mr. Compton's body, did you not?\"\n\nMurray started to deny that he had done so.  Jimmy's attorney stopped\nhim. \"Just a moment, Mr. Murray,\" he said, \"if you will stop a moment\nand give the matter careful thought I am sure you will recall that you\ntelephoned Mr. Torrance at that time, and that you did it in the\npresence of a witness,\" and the attorney pointed toward the back of the\ncourt-room. Murray looked in the direction that the other indicated and\nagain he paled and his hand trembled where it rested on the arm of his\nchair, for seated in the back of the courtroom was the head-waiter from\nFeinheimer's. \"Now do you recall?\" asked the attorney.\n\nMurray was silent for a moment.  Suddenly he half rose from his chair.\n\"Yes I remember it,\" he said. \"They are all trying to double-cross me. I\nhad nothing to do with killing Compton. That wasn't in the deal at all.\nAsk that man there; he will tell you that I had nothing to do with\nkilling Compton. He hired me and he knows,\" and with shaking finger\nMurray pointed at Mr. Harold Bince where he sat with his wife beside the\nprosecuting attorney.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nTHE VERDICT.\n\nFor a moment there was tense silence in the court-room which was broken\nby the defense's perfunctory \"Take the witness\" to the prosecuting\nattorney, but again cross-examination was waived.\n\n\"Call the next witness, please,\" and a moment later the Lizard emerged\nfrom the witness-room.\n\n\"I wish you would tell the jury,\" said the counsel for defense after the\nwitness had been sworn, \"just what you told me in my office yesterday\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the Lizard.  \"You see, it was like this: Murray there\nsent for me and tells me that he's got a job for me. He wants me to go\nand crack a safe at the International Machine Company's plant. He said\nthere was a fellow on the inside helping him, that there wouldn't be any\nwatchman there that night and that in the safe I was to crack was some\nbooks and papers that was to be destroyed, and on top of it was three or\nfour thousand dollars in pay-roll money that I was to have as my pay for\nthe job. Murray told me that the guy on the inside who wanted the job\ndone had been working some kind of a pay-roll graft and he wanted the\nrecords destroyed, and he also wanted to get rid of the guy that was hep\nto what he had been doin'. All that I had to do with it was go and crack\nthe safe and get the records, which I was to throw in the river, and\nkeep the money for myself, but the frame-up on the other guy was to send\nhim a phony message that would get him at the plant after I got through,\nand then notify the police so they could catch him there in the room\nwith the cracked safe.\n\n\"I didn't know who they were framin' this job on.  If I had I wouldn't\nhave had nothin' to do with it.\n\n\"Well, I goes to the plant and finds a window in the basement open just\nas they tells me it will be, but when I gets on the first floor just\nbefore I go up-stairs to the office, which is on the second floor, I\nheard some one walking around up-stairs. I hid in the hallway while he\ncame down. He stopped at the front door and lighted a cigarette and then\nhe went on out, and I went up-stairs to finish the job.\n\n\"When I gets in Compton's office where the safe is I flashes my light\nand the first thing I sees is Compton's body on the floor beside his\ndesk. That kind of stuff ain't in my line, so I beats it out without\ncrackin' the safe. That's all I know about it until I sees the papers,\nand then for a while I was afraid to say anything because this guy\nO'Donnell has it in for me, and I know enough about police methods to\nknow that they could frame up a good case of murder against me. But\nafter a while Miss Hudson finds me and puts it up to me straight that\nthis guy Torrance hasn't got no friends except me and her.\n\n\"Of course she didn't know how much I knew, but I did, and it's been\nworryin' me ever since. I was waiting, though, hopin' that something\nwould turn up so that he would be acquitted, but I been watchin' the\npapers close, and I seen yesterday that there wasn't much chance, so\nhere I am.\"\n\n\"You say that a man came down from Mr. Compton's office just before you\nwent up? What time was that?\"\n\n\"It was about ten o'clock, about half an hour before the cops finds\nTorrance there.\"\n\n\"And then you went upstairs and found Mr. Compton dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You say this man that came downstairs stopped and lighted a\ncigarette before he left the building. Did you see his face?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Would you recognize him if you saw him again?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Look around the court-room and see if you can find him here.\"\n\n\"Sure I can find him.  I seen him when I first came in, but I can't see\nhis face because he's hiding behind the prosecuting attorney.\"\n\nAll eyes were turned in the direction of the prosecuting attorney to see\nBince leap suddenly to his feet and lean forward upon the desk before\nhim, supported by a trembling arm as he shook his finger at the Lizard,\nand in high-pitched tones screamed, \"It's a lie! It's a lie!\"\n\nFor a moment longer he stood looking wildly about the room, and then\nwith rapid strides he crossed it to an open window, and before any one\ncould interfere he vaulted out, to fall four stories to the cement\nsidewalk below.\n\nFor  several  minutes  pandemonium reigned in the court-room.  Elizabeth\nCompton Bince swooned, and when she regained consciousness she found\nherself in the arms of Harriet Holden.\n\n\"Take me home, Harriet,\" she asked; \"take me away from this place.  Take\nme to your home. I do not want to go back to mine yet.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, in accordance with the judge's charge to the jury, a\nverdict of \"Not guilty\" was rendered in the case of the People of\nIllinois versus James Torrance, Jr.\n\nMr. Holden and Jimmy's attorney were the first to congratulate him, and\nthe former insisted that he come home with him to dinner.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Jimmy; \"I should like to immensely, but there is some\none I must see first. If I may I should like to come out later in the\nevening to thank you and Miss Holden.\"\n\nJimmy searched about the court-room until he found the Lizard.  \"I don't\nknow how to thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't then,\" said the Lizard. \"Who you ought to thank is that little\ngirl who is sick in bed up on the north side.\"\n\n\"That's just where I am going now,\" said Jimmy. \"Is she very sick?\"\n\n\"Pneumonia,\" said the Lizard. \"I telephoned her doctor just before I\ncame over here, and I guess if you want to see her at all you'd better\nhurry.\"\n\n\"It's not that had, is it?\" Jimmy said.\n\n\"I'm afraid it is,\" said the Lizard.\n\nJimmy lost no time in reaching the street and calling a taxi.  A nurse\nadmitted him to the apartment. \"How is she?\" he asked.\n\nThe nurse shook her head.\n\n\"Can she see any one?\"\n\n\"It won't make any difference now,\" said the nurse, and Jimmy was led\ninto the room where the girl, wasted by fever and suffering, lay in a\nhalf-comatose condition upon her narrow bed. Jimmy crossed the room and\nlaid his hand upon her forehead and at the touch she opened her eyes and\nlooked up at him. He saw that she recognized him and was trying to say\nsomething, and he kneeled beside the bed so that his ear might be closer\nto her lips.\n\n\"Jimmy,\" she whispered, \"you are free?  Tell me.\"\n\nHe told her briefly of what had happened. \"I am so happy,\" she murmured.\n\"Oh, Jimmy, I am so happy!\"\n\nHe took one of her wasted hands in his own and carried it to his lips.\n\"Not on the hand,\" she said faintly. \"Just once, on the lips, before I\ndie.\"\n\nHe gathered her in his arms and lifted her face to his. \"Dear little\ngirl,\" he said, \"you are not going to die. It is not as bad as that.\"\n\nShe did not reply, but only clung to him tightly, and against his cheek\nhe felt her tears and a little choking sob before she relaxed, and he\nlaid her back again on her pillow. He thought she was dead then and he\ncalled the nurse, but she still breathed, though her eyes were closed.\nJimmy sat down on the edge of the bed beside her and stroked her hand.\nAfter a while she roused again and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Jimmy,\" she said, \"will you stay with me until I go?\"  The man could\nmake no articulate response, but he pressed her hand reassuringly. She\nwas silent again for some time. Once more she whispered faintly, so\nfaintly that he had to lean close to catch her words:\n\n\"Miss Holden,\" she whispered, \"she is a--good girl.  It is--she--who\nhired--the attorney for you. Go to her--Jimmy--when I--am\ngone--she loves--you.\" Again there was a long pause.\n\n\"Good-by--Jimmy,\" she whispered at last.\n\nThe nurse was standing at the foot of the bed.  She came and put her\nhand on Jimmy's shoulder. \"It is too bad,\" she said; \"she was such a\ngood girl.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"I think she was the best little girl I ever knew.\"\n\nIt was after nine o'clock when Jimmy, depressed and sorrowing, arrived\nat the Holden home. The houseman who admitted him told him that Mr.\nHolden had been called out, but that Miss Holden was expecting him, and\nhe ushered Jimmy to the big living-room, and to his consternation he saw\nthat Elizabeth Compton was there with Harriet. The latter came forward\nto greet him, and to his surprise the other girl followed her.\n\n\"I discovered to-day, Mr. Torrance,\" she said, \"that I have wronged you.\nHowever unintentionally it was the fact remains that I might have done\nyou a very great harm and injustice. I realize now how very different\nthings might have been if I had listened to you and believed in you at\nfirst. Harriet told me that you were coming tonight and I asked to see\nyou for just a moment to tell you this and also to ask you if you would\ncontinue with the International Machine Company.\n\n\"There is no one now whom I feel I would have so much confidence in as\nyou. I wish you would come back and take charge for me. If you will tell\nme that you will consider it we will arrange the details later.\"\n\nIf an archangel had suddenly condescended to honor him with an\ninvitation to assist in the management of Heaven Jimmy could not have\nbeen more surprised. He realized at what cost of pride and self-esteem\nthe offer must have been made and acknowledgment of error. He told her\nthat he would be very glad to assist her for the present, at least, and\nthen she excused herself on the plea of nervous exhaustion and went to\nher room.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Harriet, after Elizabeth had gone, \"she really feels\nworse over her past attitude toward you than she does over Harold's\ndeath? I think she realizes now what I have told her from the first,\nthat she never really loved him. Of course, her pride has suffered\nterribly, but she will get over that quickly enough.\n\n\"But do you know I have not had an opportunity before to congratulate\nyou? I wish that I might have been there to have heard the verdict, but\nreally you don't look half as happy as I should think you would feel.\"\n\n\"I am happy about that,\" said Jimmy, \"but on top of my happiness came a\nsorrow. I just came from Edith's apartment. She died while I was there.\"\n\nHarriet gave a little cry of shocked surprise. \"Oh, Jimmy,\" she cried,\nlaying her hand upon his arm. \"Oh, Jimmy, I am so sorry!\" It was the\nfirst time that she had ever addressed him by his given name, but there\nseemed nothing strange or unusual in the occurrence.\n\n\"She was such a good little girl,\" said Harriet.\n\nIt was strange that so many should use these same words in connection\nwith Edith Hudson, and even this girl, so far removed from the sphere in\nwhich Little Eva had existed and who knew something of her past, could\nyet call her \"good.\"\n\nIt gave Jimmy a new insight into the sweetness and charity of Harriet\nHolden's character. \"Yes,\" he said, \"her soul and her heart were good\nand pure.\"\n\n\"She believed so in you,\" said the girl.  \"She thought you were the best\nman who ever lived. She told me that you were the only really good man\nshe had ever known, and her confidence and belief in you were\ncontagious. You will probably never know all that she did for you. It\nwas really she that imbued my father and his attorney with a belief in\nyour innocence, and it was she who influenced the Lizard to take the\nstand in your behalf. Yes, she was a very good friend.\"\n\n\"And you have been a good friend,\" said Jimmy. \"In the face of the same\ncircumstances that turned Miss Compton against me you believed in me.\nYour generosity made it possible for me to be defended by the best\nattorney in Chicago, but more than all that to me has been your\nfriendship and the consciousness of your sympathy at a time when, above\nall things, I needed sympathy. And now, after all you have done for me I\ncame to ask still more of you.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked.\n\nShe was standing very close to him, looking up in his face.\n\n\"You, Harriet,\" he said.\n\nShe smiled tremulously.  \"I have been yours for a long time, Jimmy, but\nyou didn't know it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Efficiency Expert, by Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3475.txt or 3475.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/7\/3475\/\n\nProduced by Fred M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1167,"split":"test"}
