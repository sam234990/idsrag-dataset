When they leave the convent, however, their lives follow two very different paths. Louise chooses a life of romance, whereas Ren\u00e9e takes a much more pragmatic approach; but their friendship is preserved through their correspondence, which continues for a dozen years from 1823 through 1835.\nLouise is expected to sacrifice herself for her two brothers and take the veil, but the young girl refuses to submit to such a fate. Her dying grandmother intercedes on her behalf and bequeaths her her fortune, thereby rescuing her from the enclosed life of a Carmelite nun and leaving her financially independent. Free to assist her brothers financially without having to sacrifice her own ambitions, Louise settles in Paris and throws herself into a life of Italian operas, masqued balls and romantic intrigues. She falls in love with an unbecoming but noble Spaniard, Felipe H\u00e9narez, Baron de Macumer. Banished from Spain, he lives incognito in Paris where he is forced to support himself by teaching Spanish. When he regains his fortune and noble standing, he woos Louise with a romantic fervour that finally wins her over. The pair are married in March 1825. They live a life of carefree happiness, but Louise's jealousy embitters him and leads to his physical break-down. He dies in 1829, leaving a grieving widow of twenty-four.\nRen\u00e9e de Maucombe's attitude to love and life are in marked contrast to those of Louise. When she leaves the convent at Blois Ren\u00e9e moves to Provence, where she marries an older man of little wealth or standing whom she can hardly be said to love. She bears Louis de L'Estorade three children, and over the course of the next decade she devotes herself body and soul to the happiness of her family. Gradually she grows to love her husband in her own way, and with her encouragement he makes a career for himself in local politics, which culminates in his becoming a peer of France and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. During this time Ren\u00e9e is quite scathing in her criticisms of Louise, whom she sees as a selfish and self-indulgent coquette. True happiness for a woman lies in motherhood and devotion to her family.\nMeanwhile, four years after the death of Felipe, Louise falls in love again. This time the object of her love is a poor poet and playwright Marie Gaston, who is several years younger than she is. As though taking a leaf out of Ren\u00e9e's book, Louise sells her Parisian property, moves to a chalet in Ville d'Avray (a small village near Paris) and lives a life of seclusion with her new husband. But Ren\u00e9e is not fooled by this masquerade. Louise, she warns, is still living a life devoted to selfishness and self-indulgence, while true happiness lies only in self-sacrifice to one's husband and children - Louise remains childless.\nAfter a few years of apparent bliss, Louise detects a change in her husband. He becomes solicitous about the financial success of his plays, and a large sum of money goes missing. Suspecting him of having an expensive mistress, Louise makes enquiries and comes to the shocking conclusion that he has another family in Paris \u2013 an Englishwoman known by the name Madame Gaston, and two children, who look remarkably like Marie. Louise confides her feelings of despair to Ren\u00e9e and announces her determination to commit suicide rather than to submit to such a fate. Ren\u00e9e's husband makes enquiries and discovers the truth of the situation. Madame Gaston is the widow of Marie's brother. The death of her husband has left her financially destitute and Marie has taken it upon himself to assist her and his two nephews, but he is ashamed to ask his wife for money. Rene\u00e9 writes to Louise to inform her of the truth and rushes to the chalet, but she is too late. Louise has contracted consumption by lying out in the dew overnight and she dies a few days later.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Letters of Two Brides, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

S. Scott\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n  To George Sand\n\n  Your name, dear George, while casting a reflected radiance on my\n  book, can gain no new glory from this page. And yet it is neither\n  self-interest nor diffidence which has led me to place it there,\n  but only the wish that it should bear witness to the solid\n  friendship between us, which has survived our wanderings and\n  separations, and triumphed over the busy malice of the world. This\n  feeling is hardly likely now to change. The goodly company of\n  friendly names, which will remain attached to my works, forms an\n  element of pleasure in the midst of the vexation caused by their\n  increasing number. Each fresh book, in fact, gives rise to fresh\n  annoyance, were it only in the reproaches aimed at my too prolific\n  pen, as though it could rival in fertility the world from which I\n  draw my models! Would it not be a fine thing, George, if the\n  future antiquarian of dead literatures were to find in this\n  company none but great names and generous hearts, friends bound by\n  pure and holy ties, the illustrious figures of the century? May I\n  not justly pride myself on this assured possession, rather than on\n  a popularity necessarily unstable? For him who knows you well, it\n  is happiness to be able to sign himself, as I do here,\n\n  Your friend,\n  DE BALZAC.\n\n  PARIS, June 1840.\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTERS OF TWO BRIDES\n\n\n\n\nFIRST PART\n\n\n\n\nI. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE. PARIS, September.\n\nSweetheart, I too am free! And I am the first too, unless you have\nwritten to Blois, at our sweet tryst of letter-writing.\n\nRaise those great black eyes of yours, fixed on my opening sentence,\nand keep this excitement for the letter which shall tell you of my first\nlove. By the way, why always \"first?\" Is there, I wonder, a second love?\n\nDon't go running on like this, you will say, but tell me rather how\nyou made your escape from the convent where you were to take your vows.\nWell, dear, I don't know about the Carmelites, but the miracle of my own\ndeliverance was, I can assure you, most humdrum. The cries of an alarmed\nconscience triumphed over the dictates of a stern policy--there's the\nwhole mystery. The sombre melancholy which seized me after you left\nhastened the happy climax, my aunt did not want to see me die of a\ndecline, and my mother, whose one unfailing cure for my malady was a\nnovitiate, gave way before her.\n\nSo I am in Paris, thanks to you, my love! Dear Renee, could you have\nseen me the day I found myself parted from you, well might you have\ngloried in the deep impression you had made on so youthful a bosom. We\nhad lived so constantly together, sharing our dreams and letting our\nfancy roam together, that I verily believe our souls had become welded\ntogether, like those two Hungarian girls, whose death we heard about\nfrom M. Beauvisage--poor misnamed being! Never surely was man better cut\nout by nature for the post of convent physician!\n\nTell me, did you not droop and sicken with your darling?\n\nIn my gloomy depression, I could do nothing but count over the ties\nwhich bind us. But it seemed as though distance had loosened them; I\nwearied of life, like a turtle-dove widowed of her mate. Death smiled\nsweetly on me, and I was proceeding quietly to die. To be at Blois, at\nthe Carmelites, consumed by dread of having to take my vows there, a\nMlle. de la Valliere, but without her prelude, and without my Renee! How\ncould I not be sick--sick unto death?\n\nHow different it used to be! That monotonous existence, where every hour\nbrings its duty, its prayer, its task, with such desperate regularity\nthat you can tell what a Carmelite sister is doing in any place, at any\nhour of the night or day; that deadly dull routine, which crushes out\nall interest in one's surroundings, had become for us two a world of\nlife and movement. Imagination had thrown open her fairy realms, and in\nthese our spirits ranged at will, each in turn serving as magic steed\nto the other, the more alert quickening the drowsy; the world from\nwhich our bodies were shut out became the playground of our fancy, which\nreveled there in frolicsome adventure. The very _Lives of the Saints_\nhelped us to understand what was so carefully left unsaid! But the day\nwhen I was reft of your sweet company, I became a true Carmelite, such\nas they appeared to us, a modern Danaid, who, instead of trying to fill\na bottomless barrel, draws every day, from Heaven knows what deep, an\nempty pitcher, thinking to find it full.\n\nMy aunt knew nothing of this inner life. How could she, who has made a\nparadise for herself within the two acres of her convent, understand my\nrevolt against life? A religious life, if embraced by girls of our age,\ndemands either an extreme simplicity of soul, such as we, sweetheart, do\nnot possess, or else an ardor for self-sacrifice like that which makes\nmy aunt so noble a character. But she sacrificed herself for a brother\nto whom she was devoted; to do the same for an unknown person or an idea\nis surely more than can be asked of mortals.\n\nFor the last fortnight I have been gulping down so many reckless words,\nburying so many reflections in my bosom, and accumulating such a store\nof things to tell, fit for your ear alone, that I should certainly\nhave been suffocated but for the resource of letter-writing as a sorry\nsubstitute for our beloved talks. How hungry one's heart gets! I am\nbeginning my journal this morning, and I picture to myself that yours\nis already started, and that, in a few days, I shall be at home in your\nbeautiful Gemenos valley, which I know only through your descriptions,\njust as you will live that Paris life, revealed to you hitherto only in\nour dreams.\n\nWell, then, sweet child, know that on a certain morning--a red-letter\nday in my life--there arrived from Paris a lady companion and Philippe,\nthe last remaining of my grandmother's valets, charged to carry me off.\nWhen my aunt summoned me to her room and told me the news, I could not\nspeak for joy, and only gazed at her stupidly.\n\n\"My child,\" she said, in her guttural voice, \"I can see that you leave\nme without regret, but this farewell is not the last; we shall meet\nagain. God has placed on your forehead the sign of the elect. You have\nthe pride which leads to heaven or to hell, but your nature is too noble\nto choose the downward path. I know you better than you know yourself;\nwith you, passion, I can see, will be very different from what it is\nwith most women.\"\n\nShe drew me gently to her and kissed my forehead. The kiss made my flesh\ncreep, for it burned with that consuming fire which eats away her life,\nwhich has turned to black the azure of her eyes, and softened the lines\nabout them, has furrowed the warm ivory of her temples, and cast a\nsallow tinge over the beautiful face.\n\nBefore replying, I kissed her hands.\n\n\"Dear aunt,\" I said, \"I shall never forget your kindness; and if it has\nnot made your nunnery all that it ought to be for my health of body and\nsoul, you may be sure nothing short of a broken heart will bring me\nback again--and that you would not wish for me. You will not see me\nhere again till my royal lover has deserted me, and I warn you that if I\ncatch him, death alone shall tear him from me. I fear no Montespan.\"\n\nShe smiled and said:\n\n\"Go, madcap, and take your idle fancies with you. There is certainly\nmore of the bold Montespan in you than of the gentle la Valliere.\"\n\nI threw my arms round her. The poor lady could not refrain from\nescorting me to the carriage. There her tender gaze was divided between\nme and the armorial bearings.\n\nAt Beaugency night overtook me, still sunk in a stupor of the mind\nproduced by these strange parting words. What can be awaiting me in this\nworld for which I have so hungered?\n\nTo begin with, I found no one to receive me; my heart had been schooled\nin vain. My mother was at the Bois de Boulogne, my father at the\nCouncil; my brother, the Duc de Rhetore, never comes in, I am told,\ntill it is time to dress for dinner. Miss Griffith (she is not unlike a\ngriffin) and Philippe took me to my rooms.\n\nThe suite is the one which belonged to my beloved grandmother, the\nPrincess de Vauremont, to whom I owe some sort of a fortune which no\none has ever told me about. As you read this, you will understand\nthe sadness which came over me as I entered a place sacred to so many\nmemories, and found the rooms just as she had left them! I was to sleep\nin the bed where she died.\n\nSitting down on the edge of the sofa, I burst into tears, forgetting I\nwas not alone, and remembering only how often I had stood there by her\nknees, the better to hear her words. There I had gazed upon her face,\nburied in its brown laces, and worn as much by age as by the pangs of\napproaching death. The room seemed to me still warm with the heat which\nshe kept up there. How comes it that Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu\nmust be like some peasant girl, who sleeps in her mother's bed the very\nmorrow of her death? For to me it was as though the Princess, who died\nin 1817, had passed away but yesterday.\n\nI saw many things in the room which ought to have been removed. Their\npresence showed the carelessness with which people, busy with the\naffairs of state, may treat their own, and also the little thought which\nhad been given since her death to this grand old lady, who will always\nremain one of the striking figures of the eighteenth century. Philippe\nseemed to divine something of the cause of my tears. He told me that the\nfurniture of the Princess had been left to me in her will and that my\nfather had allowed all the larger suites to remain dismantled, as the\nRevolution had left them. On hearing this I rose, and Philippe opened\nthe door of the small drawing-room which leads into the reception-rooms.\n\nIn these I found all the well-remembered wreckage; the panels above\nthe doors, which had contained valuable pictures, bare of all but empty\nframes; broken marbles, mirrors carried off. In old days I was afraid\nto go up the state staircase and cross these vast, deserted rooms; so I\nused to get to the Princess' rooms by a small staircase which runs\nunder the arch of the larger one and leads to the secret door of her\ndressing-room.\n\nMy suite, consisting of a drawing-room, bedroom, and the pretty\nmorning-room in scarlet and gold, of which I have told you, lies in the\nwing on the side of the Invalides. The house is only separated from the\nboulevard by a wall, covered with creepers, and by a splendid avenue\nof trees, which mingle their foliage with that of the young elms on\nthe sidewalk of the boulevard. But for the blue-and-gold dome of the\nInvalides and its gray stone mass, you might be in a wood.\n\nThe style of decoration in these rooms, together with their situation,\nindicates that they were the old show suite of the duchesses, while\nthe dukes must have had theirs in the wing opposite. The two suites are\ndecorously separated by the two main blocks, as well as by the central\none, which contained those vast, gloomy, resounding halls shown me\nby Philippe, all despoiled of their splendor, as in the days of my\nchildhood.\n\nPhilippe grew quite confidential when he saw the surprise depicted on my\ncountenance. For you must know that in this home of diplomacy the very\nservants have a reserved and mysterious air. He went on to tell me that\nit was expected a law would soon be passed restoring to the fugitives\nof the Revolution the value of their property, and that my father is\nwaiting to do up his house till this restitution is made, the king's\narchitect having estimated the damage at three hundred thousand livres.\n\nThis piece of news flung me back despairing on my drawing-room sofa.\nCould it be that my father, instead of spending this money in arranging\na marriage for me, would have left me to die in the convent? This was\nthe first thought to greet me on the threshold of my home.\n\nAh! Renee, what would I have given then to rest my head upon your\nshoulder, or to transport myself to the days when my grandmother made\nthe life of these rooms? You two in all the world have been alone in\nloving me--you away at Maucombe, and she who survives only in my heart,\nthe dear old lady, whose still youthful eyes used to open from sleep at\nmy call. How well we understood each other!\n\nThese memories suddenly changed my mood. What at first had seemed\nprofanation, now breathed of holy association. It was sweet to inhale\nthe faint odor of the powder she loved still lingering in the room;\nsweet to sleep beneath the shelter of those yellow damask curtains with\ntheir white pattern, which must have retained something of the spirit\nemanating from her eyes and breath. I told Philippe to rub up the old\nfurniture and make the rooms look as if they were lived in; I explained\nto him myself how I wanted everything arranged, and where to put each\npiece of furniture. In this way I entered into possession, and showed\nhow an air of youth might be given to the dear old things.\n\nThe bedroom is white in color, a little dulled with time, just as the\ngilding of the fanciful arabesques shows here and there a patch of red;\nbut this effect harmonizes well with the faded colors of the Savonnerie\ntapestry, which was presented to my grandmother by Louis XV. along with\nhis portrait. The timepiece was a gift from the Marechal de Saxe,\nand the china ornaments on the mantelpiece came from the Marechal de\nRichelieu. My grandmother's portrait, painted at the age of twenty-five,\nhangs in an oval frame opposite that of the King. The Prince, her\nhusband, is conspicuous by his absence. I like this frank negligence,\nuntinged by hypocrisy--a characteristic touch which sums up her charming\npersonality. Once when my grandmother was seriously ill, her confessor\nwas urgent that the Prince, who was waiting in the drawing-room, should\nbe admitted.\n\n\"He can come in with the doctor and his drugs,\" was the reply.\n\nThe bed has a canopy and well-stuffed back, and the curtains are looped\nup with fine wide bands. The furniture is of gilded wood, upholstered in\nthe same yellow damask with white flowers which drapes the windows,\nand which is lined there with a white silk that looks as though it were\nwatered. The panels over the doors have been painted, by what artist\nI can't say, but they represent one a sunrise, the other a moonlight\nscene.\n\nThe fireplace is a very interesting feature in the room. It is easy to\nsee that life in the last century centered largely round the hearth,\nwhere great events were enacted. The copper gilt grate is a marvel\nof workmanship, and the mantelpiece is most delicately finished; the\nfire-irons are beautifully chased; the bellows are a perfect gem.\nThe tapestry of the screen comes from the Gobelins and is exquisitely\nmounted; charming fantastic figures run all over the frame, on the feet,\nthe supporting bar, and the wings; the whole thing is wrought like a\nfan.\n\nDearly should I like to know who was the giver of this dainty work of\nart, which was such a favorite with her. How often have I seen the old\nlady, her feet upon the bar, reclining in the easy-chair, with her dress\nhalf raised in front, toying with the snuff-box, which lay upon the\nledge between her box of pastilles and her silk mits. What a coquette\nshe was! to the day of her death she took as much pains with her\nappearance as though the beautiful portrait had been painted only\nyesterday, and she were waiting to receive the throng of exquisites from\nthe Court! How the armchair recalls to me the inimitable sweep of her\nskirts as she sank back in it!\n\nThese women of a past generation have carried off with them secrets\nwhich are very typical of their age. The Princess had a certain turn\nof the head, a way of dropping her glance and her remarks, a choice of\nwords, which I look for in vain, even in my mother. There was subtlety\nin it all, and there was good-nature; the points were made without any\naffectation. Her talk was at once lengthy and concise; she told a good\nstory, and could put her meaning in three words. Above all, she was\nextremely free-thinking, and this has undoubtedly had its effect on my\nway of looking at things.\n\nFrom seven years old till I was ten, I never left her side; it pleased\nher to attract me as much as it pleased me to go. This preference was\nthe cause of more than one passage at arms between her and my mother,\nand nothing intensifies feeling like the icy breath of persecution. How\ncharming was her greeting, \"Here you are, little rogue!\" when curiosity\nhad taught me how to glide with stealthy snake-like movements to her\nroom. She felt that I loved her, and this childish affection was welcome\nas a ray of sunshine in the winter of her life.\n\nI don't know what went on in her rooms at night, but she had many\nvisitors; and when I came on tiptoe in the morning to see if she\nwere awake, I would find the drawing-room furniture disarranged, the\ncard-tables set out, and patches of snuff scattered about.\n\nThis drawing-room is furnished in the same style as the bedroom. The\nchairs and tables are oddly shaped, with claw feet and hollow mouldings.\nRich garlands of flowers, beautifully designed and carved, wind over the\nmirrors and hang down in festoons. On the consoles are fine china\nvases. The ground colors are scarlet and white. My grandmother was a\nhigh-spirited, striking brunette, as might be inferred from her choice\nof colors. I have found in the drawing-room a writing-table I remember\nwell; the figures on it used to fascinate me; it is plaited in graven\nsilver, and was a present from one of the Genoese Lomellini. Each side\nof the table represents the occupations of a different season; there are\nhundreds of figures in each picture, and all in relief.\n\nI remained alone for two hours, while old memories rose before me,\none after another, on this spot, hallowed by the death of a woman most\nremarkable even among the witty and beautiful Court ladies of Louis\nXV.'s day.\n\nYou know how abruptly I was parted from her, at a day's notice, in 1816.\n\n\"Go and bid good-bye to your grandmother,\" said my mother.\n\nThe Princess received me as usual, without any display of feeling, and\nexpressed no surprise at my departure.\n\n\"You are going to the convent, dear,\" she said, \"and will see your aunt\nthere, who is an excellent woman. I shall take care, though, that they\ndon't make a victim of you; you shall be independent, and able to marry\nwhom you please.\"\n\nSix months later she died. Her will had been given into the keeping of\nthe Prince de Talleyrand, the most devoted of all her old friends. He\ncontrived, while paying a visit to Mlle. de Chargeboeuf, to intimate\nto me, through her, that my grandmother forbade me to take the vows. I\nhope, sooner or later, to meet the Prince, and then I shall doubtless\nlearn more from him.\n\nThus, sweetheart, if I have found no one in flesh and blood to meet me,\nI have comforted myself with the shade of the dear Princess, and have\nprepared myself for carrying out one of our pledges, which was, as you\nknow, to keep each other informed of the smallest details in our homes\nand occupations. It makes such a difference to know where and how the\nlife of one we love is passed. Send me a faithful picture of the veriest\ntrifles around you, omitting nothing, not even the sunset lights among\nthe tall trees.\n\nOctober 19th.\n\nIt was three in the afternoon when I arrived. About half-past five, Rose\ncame and told me that my mother had returned, so I went downstairs to\npay my respects to her.\n\nMy mother lives in a suite on the ground floor, exactly corresponding\nto mine, and in the same block. I am just over her head, and the same\nsecret staircase serves for both. My father's rooms are in the block\nopposite, but are larger by the whole of the space occupied by the grand\nstaircase on our side of the building. These ancestral mansions are so\nspacious, that my father and mother continue to occupy the ground-floor\nrooms, in spite of the social duties which have once more devolved on\nthem with the return of the Bourbons, and are even able to receive in\nthem.\n\nI found my mother, dressed for the evening, in her drawing-room, where\nnothing is changed. I came slowly down the stairs, speculating with\nevery step how I should be met by this mother who had shown herself so\nlittle of a mother to me, and from whom, during eight years, I had heard\nnothing beyond the two letters of which you know. Judging it unworthy to\nsimulate an affection I could not possibly feel, I put on the air of\na pious imbecile, and entered the room with many inward qualms, which\nhowever soon disappeared. My mother's tack was equal to the occasion.\nShe made no pretence of emotion; she neither held me at arm's-length nor\nhugged me to her bosom like a beloved daughter, but greeted me as though\nwe had parted the evening before. Her manner was that of the kindliest\nand most sincere friend, as she addressed me like a grown person, first\nkissing me on the forehead.\n\n\"My dear little one,\" she said, \"if you were to die at the convent, it\nis much better to live with your family. You frustrate your father's\nplans and mine; but the age of blind obedience to parents is past. M. de\nChaulieu's intention, and in this I am quite at one with him, is to lose\nno opportunity of making your life pleasant and of letting you see the\nworld. At your age I should have thought as you do, therefore I am not\nvexed with you; it is impossible you should understand what we expected\nfrom you. You will not find any absurd severity in me; and if you have\never thought me heartless, you will soon find out your mistake. Still,\nthough I wish you to feel perfectly free, I think that, to begin with,\nyou would do well to follow the counsels of a mother, who wishes to be a\nsister to you.\"\n\nI was quite charmed by the Duchess, who talked in a gentle voice,\nstraightening my convent tippet as she spoke. At the age of thirty-eight\nshe is still exquisitely beautiful. She has dark-blue eyes, with silken\nlashes, a smooth forehead, and a complexion so pink and white that you\nmight think she paints. Her bust and shoulders are marvelous, and her\nwaist is as slender as yours. Her hand is milk-white and extraordinarily\nbeautiful; the nails catch the light in their perfect polish, the thumb\nis like ivory, the little finger stands just a little apart from the\nrest, and the foot matches the hand; it is the Spanish foot of Mlle. de\nVandenesse. If she is like this at forty, at sixty she will still be a\nbeautiful woman.\n\nI replied, sweetheart, like a good little girl. I was as nice to her as\nshe to me, nay, nicer. Her beauty completely vanquished me; it seemed\nonly natural that such a woman should be absorbed in her regal part. I\ntold her this as simply as though I had been talking to you. I daresay\nit was a surprise to her to hear words of affection from her daughter's\nmouth, and the unfeigned homage of my admiration evidently touched her\ndeeply. Her manner changed and became even more engaging; she dropped\nall formality as she said:\n\n\"I am much pleased with you, and I hope we shall remain good friends.\"\n\nThe words struck me as charmingly naive, but I did not let this appear,\nfor I saw at once that the prudent course was to allow her to believe\nherself much deeper and cleverer than her daughter. So I only stared\nvacantly and she was delighted. I kissed her hands repeatedly, telling\nher how happy it made me to be so treated and to feel at my ease with\nher. I even confided to her my previous tremors. She smiled, put her\narm round my neck, and drawing me towards her, kissed me on the forehead\nmost affectionately.\n\n\"Dear child,\" she said, \"we have people coming to dinner to-day. Perhaps\nyou will agree with me that it is better for you not to make your first\nappearance in society till you have been in the dressmaker's hands; so,\nafter you have seen your father and brother, you can go upstairs again.\"\n\nI assented most heartily. My mother's exquisite dress was the first\nrevelation to me of the world which our dreams had pictured; but I did\nnot feel the slightest desire to rival her.\n\nMy father now entered, and the Duchess presented me to him.\n\nHe became all at once most affectionate, and played the father's part so\nwell, that I could not but believe his heart to be in it. Taking my two\nhands in his, and kissing them, with more of the lover than the father\nin his manner, he said:\n\n\"So this is my rebel daughter!\"\n\nAnd he drew me towards him, with his arm passed tenderly round my waist,\nwhile he kissed me on the cheeks and forehead.\n\n\"The pleasure with which we shall watch your success in society will\natone for the disappointment we felt at your change of vocation,\" he\nsaid. Then, turning to my mother, \"Do you know that she is going to turn\nout very pretty, and you will be proud of her some day?--Here is your\nbrother, Rhetore.--Alphonse,\" he said to a fine young man who came in,\n\"here is your convent-bred sister, who threatens to send her nun's frock\nto the deuce.\"\n\nMy brother came up in a leisurely way and took my hand, which he\npressed.\n\n\"Come, come, you may kiss her,\" said my father.\n\nAnd he kissed me on both cheeks.\n\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" he said, \"and I take your side against my\nfather.\"\n\nI thanked him, but could not help thinking he might have come to Blois\nwhen he was at Orleans visiting our Marquis brother in his quarters.\n\nFearing the arrival of strangers, I now withdrew. I tidied up my rooms,\nand laid out on the scarlet velvet of my lovely table all the materials\nnecessary for writing to you, meditating all the while on my new\nsituation.\n\nThis, my fair sweetheart, is a true and veracious account of the return\nof a girl of eighteen, after an absence of nine years, to the bosom of\none of the noblest families in the kingdom. I was tired by the journey\nas well as by all the emotions I had been through, so I went to bed in\nconvent fashion, at eight o'clock after supper. They have preserved even\na little Saxe service which the dear Princess used when she had a fancy\nfor taking her meals alone.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE SAME TO THE SAME November 25th.\n\nNext day I found my rooms done out and dusted, and even flowers put\nin the vases, by old Philippe. I began to feel at home. Only it didn't\noccur to anybody that a Carmelite schoolgirl has an early appetite, and\nRose had no end of trouble in getting breakfast for me.\n\n\"Mlle. goes to bed at dinner-time,\" she said to me, \"and gets up when\nthe Duke is just returning home.\"\n\nI began to write. About one o'clock my father knocked at the door of the\nsmall drawing-room and asked if he might come in. I opened the door; he\ncame in, and found me writing to you.\n\n\"My dear,\" he began, \"you will have to get yourself clothes, and to make\nthese rooms comfortable. In this purse you will find twelve thousand\nfrancs, which is the yearly income I purpose allowing you for your\nexpenses. You will make arrangements with your mother as to some\ngoverness whom you may like, in case Miss Griffith doesn't please\nyou, for Mme. de Chaulieu will not have time to go out with you in the\nmornings. A carriage and man-servant shall be at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Let me keep Philippe,\" I said.\n\n\"So be it,\" he replied. \"But don't be uneasy; you have money enough of\nyour own to be no burden either to your mother or me.\"\n\n\"May I ask how much I have?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my child,\" he said. \"Your grandmother left you five hundred\nthousand francs; this was the amount of her savings, for she would not\nalienate a foot of land from the family. This sum has been placed in\nGovernment stock, and, with the accumulated interest, now brings in\nabout forty thousand francs a year. With this I had purposed making an\nindependence for your second brother, and it is here that you have upset\nmy plans. Later, however, it is possible that you may fall in with them.\nIt shall rest with yourself, for I have confidence in your good sense\nfar more than I had expected.\n\n\"I do not need to tell you how a daughter of the Chaulieus ought\nto behave. The pride so plainly written in your features is my best\nguarantee. Safeguards, such as common folk surround their daughters\nwith, would be an insult in our family. A slander reflecting on your\nname might cost the life of the man bold enough to utter it, or the life\nof one of your brothers, if by chance the right should not prevail. No\nmore on this subject. Good-bye, little one.\"\n\nHe kissed me on the forehead and went out. I cannot understand the\nrelinquishment of this plan after nine years' persistence in it. My\nfather's frankness is what I like. There is no ambiguity about his\nwords. My money ought to belong to his Marquis son. Who, then, has had\nbowels of mercy? My mother? My father? Or could it be my brother?\n\nI remained sitting on my grandmother's sofa, staring at the purse which\nmy father had left on the mantelpiece, at once pleased and vexed that\nI could not withdraw my mind from the money. It is true, further\nspeculation was useless. My doubts had been cleared up and there was\nsomething fine in the way my pride was spared.\n\nPhilippe has spent the morning rushing about among the various shops and\nworkpeople who are to undertake the task of my metamorphosis. A\nfamous dressmaker, by name Victorine, has come, as well as a woman for\nunderclothing, and a shoemaker. I am as impatient as a child to know\nwhat I shall be like when I emerge from the sack which constituted the\nconventual uniform; but all these tradespeople take a long time; the\ncorset-maker requires a whole week if my figure is not to be spoilt. You\nsee, I have a figure, dear; this becomes serious. Janssen, the Operatic\nshoemaker, solemnly assures me that I have my mother's foot. The whole\nmorning has gone in these weighty occupations. Even a glovemaker has\ncome to take the measure of my hand. The underclothing woman has got my\norders.\n\nAt the meal which I call dinner, and the others lunch, my mother told me\nthat we were going together to the milliner's to see some hats, so that\nmy taste should be formed, and I might be in a position to order my own.\n\nThis burst of independence dazzles me. I am like a blind man who has\njust recovered his sight. Now I begin to understand the vast interval\nwhich separates a Carmelite sister from a girl in society. Of ourselves\nwe could never have conceived it.\n\nDuring this lunch my father seemed absent-minded, and we left him to his\nthoughts; he is deep in the King's confidence. I was entirely forgotten;\nbut, from what I have seen, I have no doubt he will remember me when he\nhas need of me. He is a very attractive man in spite of his fifty years.\nHis figure is youthful; he is well made, fair, and extremely graceful\nin his movements. He has a diplomatic face, at once dumb and expressive;\nhis nose is long and slender, and he has brown eyes.\n\nWhat a handsome pair! Strange thoughts assail me as it becomes plain\nto me that these two, so perfectly matched in birth, wealth, and mental\nsuperiority, live entirely apart, and have nothing in common but their\nname. The show of unity is only for the world.\n\nThe cream of the Court and diplomatic circles were here last night. Very\nsoon I am going to a ball given by the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, and\nI shall be presented to the society I am so eager to know. A\ndancing-master is coming every morning to give me lessons, for I must be\nable to dance in a month, or I can't go to the ball.\n\nBefore dinner, my mother came to talk about the governess with me. I\nhave decided to keep Miss Griffith, who was recommended by the English\nambassador. Miss Griffith is the daughter of a clergyman; her mother was\nof good family, and she is perfectly well bred. She is thirty-six, and\nwill teach me English. The good soul is quite handsome enough to have\nambitions; she is Scotch--poor and proud--and will act as my chaperon.\nShe is to sleep in Rose's room. Rose will be under her orders. I saw at\na glance that my governess would be governed by me. In the six days we\nhave been together, she has made very sure that I am the only\nperson likely to take an interest in her; while, for my part, I have\nascertained that, for all her statuesque features, she will prove\naccommodating. She seems to me a kindly soul, but cautious. I have not\nbeen able to extract a word of what passed between her and my mother.\n\nAnother trifling piece of news! My father has this morning refused the\nappointment as Minister of State which was offered him. This accounts\nfor his preoccupied manner last night. He says he would prefer an\nembassy to the worries of public debate. Spain in especial attracts him.\n\nThis news was told me at lunch, the one moment of the day when my\nfather, mother, and brother see each other in an easy way. The servants\nthen only come when they are rung for. The rest of the day my brother,\nas well as my father, spends out of the house. My mother has her toilet\nto make; between two and four she is never visible; at four o'clock she\ngoes out for an hour's drive; when she is not dining out, she receives\nfrom six to seven, and the evening is given to entertainments of various\nkinds--theatres, balls, concerts, at homes. In short, her life is so\nfull, that I don't believe she ever has a quarter of an hour to herself.\nShe must spend a considerable time dressing in the morning; for at\nlunch, which takes place between eleven and twelve, she is exquisite.\nThe meaning of the things that are said about her is dawning on me. She\nbegins the day with a bath barely warmed, and a cup of cold coffee with\ncream; then she dresses. She is never, except on some great emergency,\ncalled before nine o'clock. In summer there are morning rides, and at\ntwo o'clock she receives a young man whom I have never yet contrived to\nsee.\n\nBehold our family life! We meet at lunch and dinner, though often I\nam alone with my mother at this latter meal, and I foresee that still\noftener I shall take it in my own rooms (following the example of\nmy grandmother) with only Miss Griffith for company, for my mother\nfrequently dines out. I have ceased to wonder at the indifference my\nfamily have shown to me. In Paris, my dear, it is a miracle of virtue to\nlove the people who live with you, for you see little enough of them; as\nfor the absent--they do not exist!\n\nKnowing as this may sound, I have not yet set foot in the streets, and\nam deplorably ignorant. I must wait till I am less of the country cousin\nand have brought my dress and deportment into keeping with the society\nI am about to enter, the whirl of which amazes me even here, where only\ndistant murmurs reach my ear. So far I have not gone beyond the garden;\nbut the Italian opera opens in a few days, and my mother has a box\nthere. I am crazy with delight at the thought of hearing Italian music\nand seeing French acting.\n\nAlready I begin to drop convent habits for those of society. I spend the\nevening writing to you till the moment for going to bed arrives. This\nhas been postponed to ten o'clock, the hour at which my mother goes out,\nif she is not at the theatre. There are twelve theatres in Paris.\n\nI am grossly ignorant and I read a lot, but quite indiscriminately, one\nbook leading to another. I find the names of fresh books on the cover of\nthe one I am reading; but as I have no one to direct me, I light on some\nwhich are fearfully dull. What modern literature I have read all turns\nupon love, the subject which used to bulk so largely in our thoughts,\nbecause it seemed that our fate was determined by man and for man. But\nhow inferior are these authors to two little girls, known as Sweetheart\nand Darling--otherwise Renee and Louise. Ah! my love, what wretched\nplots, what ridiculous situations, and what poverty of sentiment!\nTwo books, however, have given me wonderful pleasure--_Corinne_ and\n_Adolphe_. Apropos of this, I asked my father one day whether it would\nbe possible for me to see Mme. de Stael. My father, mother, and Alphonse\nall burst out laughing, and Alphonse said:\n\n\"Where in the world has she sprung from?\"\n\nTo which my father replied:\n\n\"What fools we are! She springs from the Carmelites.\"\n\n\"My child, Mme. de Stael is dead,\" said my mother gently.\n\nWhen I finished _Adolphe_, I asked Miss Griffith how a woman could be\nbetrayed.\n\n\"Why, of course, when she loves,\" was her reply.\n\nRenee, tell me, do you think we could be betrayed by a man?\n\nMiss Griffith has at last discerned that I am not an utter ignoramus,\nthat I have somewhere a hidden vein of knowledge, the knowledge we\nlearned from each other in our random arguments. She sees that it is\nonly superficial facts of which I am ignorant. The poor thing has opened\nher heart to me. Her curt reply to my question, when I compare it with\nall the sorrows I can imagine, makes me feel quite creepy. Once more she\nurged me not to be dazzled by the glitter of society, to be always on my\nguard, especially against what most attracted me. This is the sum-total\nof her wisdom, and I can get nothing more out of her. Her lectures,\ntherefore, become a trifle monotonous, and she might be compared in this\nrespect to the bird which has only one cry.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE SAME TO THE SAME December.\n\nMy Darling,--Here I am ready to make my bow to the world. By way of\npreparation I have been trying to commit all the follies I could think\nof before sobering down for my entry. This morning, I have seen myself,\nafter many rehearsals, well and duly equipped--stays, shoes, curls,\ndress, ornaments,--all in order. Following the example of duelists\nbefore a meeting, I tried my arms in the privacy of my chamber. I wanted\nto see how I would look, and had no difficulty in discovering a certain\nair of victory and triumph, bound to carry all before it. I mustered all\nmy forces, in accordance with that splendid maxim of antiquity,\n\"Know thyself!\" and boundless was my delight in thus making my own\nacquaintance. Griffith was the sole spectator of this doll's play,\nin which I was at once doll and child. You think you know me? You are\nhugely mistaken.\n\nHere is a portrait, then, Renee, of your sister, formerly disguised as a\nCarmelite, now brought to life again as a frivolous society girl. She is\none of the greatest beauties in France--Provence, of course, excepted.\nI don't see that I can give a more accurate summary of this interesting\ntopic.\n\nTrue, I have my weak points; but were I a man, I should adore them. They\narise from what is most promising in me. When you have spent a fortnight\nadmiring the exquisite curves of your mother's arms, and that mother the\nDuchesse de Chaulieu, it is impossible, my dear, not to deplore your own\nangular elbows. Yet there is consolation in observing the fineness of\nthe wrist, and a certain grace of line in those hollows, which will yet\nfill out and show plump, round, and well modeled, under the satiny skin.\nThe somewhat crude outline of the arms is seen again in the shoulders.\nStrictly speaking, indeed, I have no shoulders, but only two bony\nblades, standing out in harsh relief. My figure also lacks pliancy;\nthere is a stiffness about the side lines.\n\nPoof! There's the worst out. But then the contours are bold and\ndelicate, the bright, pure flame of health bites into the vigorous\nlines, a flood of life and of blue blood pulses under the transparent\nskin, and the fairest daughter of Eve would seem a Negress beside me! I\nhave the foot of a gazelle! My joints are finely turned, my features\nof a Greek correctness. It is true, madame, that the flesh tints do not\nmelt into each other; but, at least, they stand out clear and bright. In\nshort, I am a very pretty green fruit, with all the charm of unripeness.\nI see a great likeness to the face in my aunt's old missal, which rises\nout of a violet lily.\n\nThere is no silly weakness in the blue of my insolent eyes; the white\nis pure mother-of-pearl, prettily marked with tiny veins, and the thick,\nlong lashes fall like a silken fringe. My forehead sparkles, and the\nhair grows deliciously; it ripples into waves of pale gold, growing\nbrowner towards the centre, whence escape little rebel locks, which\nalone would tell that my fairness is not of the insipid and hysterical\ntype. I am a tropical blonde, with plenty of blood in my veins, a\nblonde more apt to strike than to turn the cheek. What do you think the\nhairdresser proposed? He wanted, if you please, to smooth my hair into\ntwo bands, and place over my forehead a pearl, kept in place by a gold\nchain! He said it would recall the Middle Ages.\n\nI told him I was not aged enough to have reached the middle, or to need\nan ornament to freshen me up!\n\nThe nose is slender, and the well-cut nostrils are separated by a\nsweet little pink partition--an imperious, mocking nose, with a tip\ntoo sensitive ever to grow fat or red. Sweetheart, if this won't find\na husband for a dowerless maiden, I'm a donkey. The ears are daintily\ncurled, a pearl hanging from either lobe would show yellow. The neck\nis long, and has an undulating motion full of dignity. In the shade the\nwhite ripens to a golden tinge. Perhaps the mouth is a little large. But\nhow expressive! what a color on the lips! how prettily the teeth laugh!\n\nThen, dear, there is a harmony running through all. What a gait! what\na voice! We have not forgotten how our grandmother's skirts fell into\nplace without a touch. In a word, I am lovely and charming. When the\nmood comes, I can laugh one of our good old laughs, and no one will\nthink the less of me; the dimples, impressed by Comedy's light fingers\non my fair cheeks, will command respect. Or I can let my eyes fall\nand my heart freeze under my snowy brows. I can pose as a Madonna with\nmelancholy, swan-like neck, and the painters' virgins will be nowhere;\nmy place in heaven would be far above them. A man would be forced to\nchant when he spoke to me.\n\nSo, you see, my panoply is complete, and I can run the whole gamut of\ncoquetry from deepest bass to shrillest treble. It is a huge advantage\nnot to be all of one piece. Now, my mother is neither playful nor\nvirginal. Her only attitude is an imposing one; when she ceases to be\nmajestic, she is ferocious. It is difficult for her to heal the wounds\nshe makes, whereas I can wound and heal together. We are absolutely\nunlike, and therefore there could not possibly be rivalry between us,\nunless indeed we quarreled over the greater or less perfection of our\nextremities, which are similar. I take after my father, who is shrewd\nand subtle. I have the manner of my grandmother and her charming voice,\nwhich becomes falsetto when forced, but is a sweet-toned chest voice at\nthe ordinary pitch of a quiet talk.\n\nI feel as if I had left the convent to-day for the first time. For\nsociety I do not yet exist; I am unknown to it. What a ravishing moment!\nI still belong only to myself, like a flower just blown, unseen yet of\nmortal eye.\n\nIn spite of this, my sweet, as I paced the drawing-room during my\nself-inspection, and saw the poor cast-off school-clothes, a queer\nfeeling came over me. Regret for the past, anxiety about the future,\nfear of society, a long farewell to the pale daisies which we used to\npick and strip of their petals in light-hearted innocence, there was\nsomething of all that; but strange, fantastic visions also rose, which I\ncrushed back into the inner depths, whence they had sprung, and whither\nI dared not follow them.\n\nMy Renee, I have a regular trousseau! It is all beautifully laid away\nand perfumed in the cedar-wood drawers with lacquered front of my\ncharming dressing-table. There are ribbons, shoes, gloves, all in lavish\nabundance. My father has kindly presented me with the pretty gewgaws a\ngirl loves--a dressing-case, toilet service, scent-box, fan, sunshade,\nprayer-book, gold chain, cashmere shawl. He has also promised to give\nme riding lessons. And I can dance! To-morrow, yes, to-morrow evening, I\ncome out!\n\nMy dress is white muslin, and on my head I wear a garland of white\nroses in Greek style. I shall put on my Madonna face; I mean to play the\nsimpleton, and have all the women on my side. My mother is miles away\nfrom any idea of what I write to you. She believes me quite destitute of\nmind, and would be dumfounded if she read my letter. My brother honors\nme with a profound contempt, and is uniformly and politely indifferent.\n\nHe is a handsome young fellow, but melancholy, and given to moods. I\nhave divined his secret, though neither the Duke nor Duchess has an\ninkling of it. In spite of his youth and his title, he is jealous of his\nfather. He has no position in the State, no post at Court, he never has\nto say, \"I am going to the Chamber.\" I alone in the house have sixteen\nhours for meditation. My father is absorbed in public business and his\nown amusements; my mother, too, is never at leisure; no member of the\nhousehold practises self-examination, they are constantly in company,\nand have hardly time to live.\n\nI should immensely like to know what is the potent charm wielded by\nsociety to keep people prisoner from nine every evening till two or\nthree in the morning, and force them to be so lavish alike of strength\nand money. When I longed for it, I had no idea of the separations it\nbrought about, or its overmastering spell. But, then, I forget, it is\nParis which does it all.\n\nIt is possible, it seems, for members of one family to live side by side\nand know absolutely nothing of each other. A half-fledged nun arrives,\nand in a couple of weeks has grasped domestic details, of which the\nmaster diplomatist at the head of the house is quite ignorant. Or\nperhaps he _does_ see, and shuts his eyes deliberately, as part of the\nfather's _role_. There is a mystery here which I must plumb.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE SAME TO THE SAME December 15th.\n\nYesterday, at two o'clock, I went to drive in the Champs-Elysees and the\nBois de Boulogne. It was one of those autumn days which we used to find\nso beautiful on the banks of the Loire. So I have seen Paris at last!\nThe Place Louis XV. is certainly very fine, but the beauty is that of\nman's handiwork.\n\nI was dressed to perfection, pensive, with set face (though inwardly\nmuch tempted to laugh), under a lovely hat, my arms crossed. Would you\nbelieve it? Not a single smile was thrown at me, not one poor youth was\nstruck motionless as I passed, not a soul turned to look again; and yet\nthe carriage proceeded with a deliberation worthy of my pose.\n\nNo, I am wrong, there was one--a duke, and a charming man--who suddenly\nreined in as we went by. The individual who thus saved appearances for\nme was my father, and he proclaimed himself highly gratified by what he\nsaw. I met my mother also, who sent me a butterfly kiss from the tips\nof her fingers. The worthy Griffith, who fears no man, cast her glances\nhither and thither without discrimination. In my judgment, a young woman\nshould always know exactly what her eye is resting on.\n\nI was mad with rage. One man actually inspected my carriage without\nnoticing me. This flattering homage probably came from a carriage-maker.\nI have been quite out in the reckoning of my forces. Plainly, beauty,\nthat rare gift which comes from heaven, is commoner in Paris than I\nthought. I saw hats doffed with deference to simpering fools; a purple\nface called forth murmurs of, \"It is she!\" My mother received an immense\namount of admiration. There is an answer to this problem, and I mean to\nfind it.\n\nThe men, my dear, seemed to me generally very ugly. The very few\nexceptions are bad copies of us. Heaven knows what evil genius has\ninspired their costume; it is amazingly inelegant compared with those\nof former generations. It has no distinction, no beauty of color or\nromance; it appeals neither to the senses, nor the mind, nor the eye,\nand it must be very uncomfortable. It is meagre and stunted. The hat,\nabove all, struck me; it is a sort of truncated column, and does not\nadapt itself in the least to the shape of the head; but I am told it\nis easier to bring about a revolution than to invent a graceful hat.\nCourage in Paris recoils before the thought of appearing in a round\nfelt; and for lack of one day's daring, men stick all their lives to\nthis ridiculous headpiece. And yet Frenchmen are said to be fickle!\n\nThe men are hideous anyway, whatever they put on their heads. I have\nseen nothing but worn, hard faces, with no calm nor peace in the\nexpression; the harsh lines and furrows speak of foiled ambition and\nsmarting vanity. A fine forehead is rarely seen.\n\n\"And these are the product of Paris!\" I said to Miss Griffith.\n\n\"Most cultivated and pleasant men,\" she replied.\n\nI was silent. The heart of a spinster of thirty-six is a well of\ntolerance.\n\nIn the evening I went to the ball, where I kept close to my mother's\nside. She gave me her arm with a devotion which did not miss its\nreward. All the honors were for her; I was made the pretext for charming\ncompliments. She was clever enough to find me fools for my partners, who\none and all expatiated on the heat and the beauty of the ball, till you\nmight suppose I was freezing and blind. Not one failed to enlarge on the\nstrange, unheard-of, extraordinary, odd, remarkable fact--that he saw me\nfor the first time.\n\nMy dress, which dazzled me as I paraded alone in my white-and-gold\ndrawing-room, was barely noticeable amidst the gorgeous finery of most\nof the married women. Each had her band of faithful followers, and they\nall watched each other askance. A few were radiant in triumphant\nbeauty, and amongst these was my mother. A girl at a ball is a mere\ndancing-machine--a thing of no consequence whatever.\n\nThe men, with rare exceptions, did not impress me more favorably here\nthan at the Champs-Elysees. They have a used-up look; their features\nare meaningless, or rather they have all the same meaning. The proud,\nstalwart bearing which we find in the portraits of our ancestors--men\nwho joined moral to physical vigor--has disappeared. Yet in this\ngathering there was one man of remarkable ability, who stood out from\nthe rest by the beauty of his face. But even he did not rouse in me the\nfeeling which I should have expected. I do not know his works, and he is\na man of no family. Whatever the genius and the merits of a plebeian\nor a commoner, he could never stir my blood. Besides, this man was\nobviously so much more taken up with himself than with anybody else,\nthat I could not but think these great brain-workers must look on us as\nthings rather than persons. When men of intellectual power love, they\nought to give up writing, otherwise their love is not the real thing.\nThe lady of their heart does not come first in all their thoughts. I\nseemed to read all this in the bearing of the man I speak of. I am told\nhe is a professor, orator, and author, whose ambition makes him the\nslave of every bigwig.\n\nMy mind was made up on the spot. It was unworthy of me, I determined,\nto quarrel with society for not being impressed by my merits, and I gave\nmyself up to the simple pleasure of dancing, which I thoroughly enjoyed.\nI heard a great deal of inept gossip about people of whom I know\nnothing; but perhaps it is my ignorance on many subjects which prevents\nme from appreciating it, as I saw that most men and women took a lively\npleasure in certain remarks, whether falling from their own lips or\nthose of others. Society bristles with enigmas which look hard to solve.\nIt is a perfect maze of intrigue. Yet I am fairly quick of sight and\nhearing, and as to my wits, Mlle. de Maucombe does not need to be told!\n\nI returned home tired with a pleasant sort of tiredness, and in all\ninnocence began describing my sensations to my mother, who was with me.\nShe checked me with the warning that I must never say such things to any\none but her.\n\n\"My dear child,\" she added, \"it needs as much tact to know when to be\nsilent as when to speak.\"\n\nThis advice brought home to me the nature of the sensations which ought\nto be concealed from every one, not excepting perhaps even a mother. At\na glance I measured the vast field of feminine duplicity. I can assure\nyou, sweetheart, that we, in our unabashed simplicity, would pass for\ntwo very wide-awake little scandal-mongers. What lessons may be conveyed\nin a finger on the lips, in a word, a look! All in a moment I was seized\nwith excessive shyness. What! may I never again speak of the natural\npleasure I feel in the exercise of dancing? \"How then,\" I said to\nmyself, \"about the deeper feelings?\"\n\nI went to bed sorrowful, and I still suffer from the shock produced by\nthis first collision of my frank, joyous nature with the harsh laws\nof society. Already the highway hedges are flecked with my white wool!\nFarewell, beloved.\n\n\n\n\nV. RENEE DE MAUCOMBE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU October.\n\nHow deeply your letter moved me; above all, when I compare our widely\ndifferent destinies! How brilliant is the world you are entering, how\npeaceful the retreat where I shall end my modest career!\n\nIn the Castle of Maucombe, which is so well known to you by description\nthat I shall say no more of it, I found my room almost exactly as I\nleft it; only now I can enjoy the splendid view it gives of the Gemenos\nvalley, which my childish eyes used to see without comprehending. A\nfortnight after my arrival, my father and mother took me, along with my\ntwo brothers, to dine with one of our neighbors, M. de l'Estorade,\nan old gentleman of good family, who has made himself rich, after the\nprovincial fashion, by scraping and paring.\n\nM. de l'Estorade was unable to save his only son from the clutches of\nBonaparte; after successfully eluding the conscription, he was forced\nto send him to the army in 1813, to join the Emperor's bodyguard. After\nLeipsic no more was heard of him. M. de Montriveau, whom the father\ninterviewed in 1814, declared that he had seen him taken by the\nRussians. Mme. de l'Estorade died of grief whilst a vain search was\nbeing made in Russia. The Baron, a very pious old man, practised that\nfine theological virtue which we used to cultivate at Blois--Hope!\nHope made him see his son in dreams. He hoarded his income for him, and\nguarded carefully the portion of inheritance which fell to him from the\nfamily of the late Mme. de l'Estorade, no one venturing to ridicule the\nold man.\n\nAt last it dawned upon me that the unexpected return of this son was the\ncause of my own. Who could have imagined, whilst fancy was leading us\na giddy dance, that my destined husband was slowly traveling on foot\nthrough Russia, Poland, and Germany? His bad luck only forsook him\nat Berlin, where the French Minister helped his return to his native\ncountry. M. de l'Estorade, the father, who is a small landed proprietor\nin Provence, with an income of about ten thousand livres, has not\nsufficient European fame to interest the world in the wandering Knight\nde l'Estorade, whose name smacks of his adventures.\n\nThe accumulated income of twelve thousand livres from the property of\nMme. de l'Estorade, with the addition of the father's savings, provides\nthe poor guard of honor with something like two hundred and fifty\nthousand livres, not counting house and lands--quite a considerable\nfortune in Provence. His worthy father had bought, on the very eve\nof the Chevalier's return, a fine but badly-managed estate, where he\ndesigns to plant ten thousand mulberry-trees, raised in his nursery\nwith a special view to this acquisition. The Baron, having found his\nlong-lost son, has now but one thought, to marry him, and marry him to a\ngirl of good family.\n\nMy father and mother entered into their neighbor's idea with an eye to\nmy interests so soon as they discovered that Renee de Maucombe would be\nacceptable without a dowry, and that the money the said Renee ought\nto inherit from her parents would be duly acknowledged as hers in the\ncontract. In a similar way, my younger brother, Jean de Maucombe, as\nsoon as he came of age, signed a document stating that he had received\nfrom his parents an advance upon the estate equal in amount to one-third\nof whole. This is the device by which the nobles of Provence elude the\ninfamous Civil Code of M. de Bonaparte, a code which will drive as many\ngirls of good family into convents as it will find husbands for. The\nFrench nobility, from the little I have been able to gather, seem to be\ndivided on these matters.\n\nThe dinner, darling, was a first meeting between your sweetheart and the\nexile. The Comte de Maucombe's servants donned their old laced\nliveries and hats, the coachman his great top-boots; we sat five in the\nantiquated carriage, and arrived in state about two o'clock--the dinner\nwas for three--at the grange, which is the dwelling of the Baron de\nl'Estorade.\n\nMy father-in-law to be has, you see, no castle, only a simple country\nhouse, standing beneath one of our hills, at the entrance of that noble\nvalley, the pride of which is undoubtedly the Castle of Maucombe.\nThe building is quite unpretentious: four pebble walls covered with a\nyellowish wash, and roofed with hollow tiles of a good red, constitute\nthe grange. The rafters bend under the weight of this brick-kiln.\nThe windows, inserted casually, without any attempt at symmetry, have\nenormous shutters, painted yellow. The garden in which it stands is a\nProvencal garden, enclosed by low walls, built of big round pebbles set\nin layers, alternately sloping or upright, according to the artistic\ntaste of the mason, which finds here its only outlet. The mud in which\nthey are set is falling away in places.\n\nThanks to an iron railing at the entrance facing the road, this simple\nfarm has a certain air of being a country-seat. The railing, long sought\nwith tears, is so emaciated that it recalled Sister Angelique to me.\nA flight of stone steps leads to the door, which is protected by a\npent-house roof, such as no peasant on the Loire would tolerate for his\ncoquettish white stone house, with its blue roof, glittering in the sun.\nThe garden and surrounding walks are horribly dusty, and the trees seem\nburnt up. It is easy to see that for years the Baron's life has been a\nmere rising up and going to bed again, day after day, without a thought\nbeyond that of piling up coppers. He eats the same food as his two\nservants, a Provencal lad and the old woman who used to wait on his\nwife. The rooms are scantily furnished.\n\nNevertheless, the house of l'Estorade had done its best; the cupboards\nhad been ransacked, and its last man beaten up for the dinner, which was\nserved to us on old silver dishes, blackened and battered. The exile, my\ndarling pet, is like the railing, emaciated! He is pale and silent, and\nbears traces of suffering. At thirty-seven he might be fifty. The once\nbeautiful ebon locks of youth are streaked with white like a lark's\nwing. His fine blue eyes are cavernous; he is a little deaf, which\nsuggests the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance.\n\nSpite of all this, I have graciously consented to become Mme. de\nl'Estorade and to receive a dowry of two hundred and fifty thousand\nlivres, but only on the express condition of being allowed to work my\nwill upon the grange and make a park there. I have demanded from my\nfather, in set terms, a grant of water, which can be brought thither\nfrom Maucombe. In a month I shall be Mme. de l'Estorade; for, dear, I\nhave made a good impression. After the snows of Siberia a man is ready\nenough to see merit in those black eyes, which according to you, used to\nripen fruit with a look. Louis de l'Estorade seems well content to marry\nthe _fair Renee de Maucombe_--such is your friend's splendid title.\n\nWhilst you are preparing to reap the joys of that many-sided existence\nwhich awaits a young lady of the Chaulieu family, and to queen it in\nParis, your poor little sweetheart, Renee, that child of the desert,\nhas fallen from the empyrean, whither together we had soared, into\nthe vulgar realities of a life as homely as a daisy's. I have vowed to\nmyself to comfort this young man, who has never known youth, but passed\nstraight from his mother's arms to the embrace of war, and from the joys\nof his country home to the frosts and forced labor of Siberia.\n\nHumble country pleasures will enliven the monotony of my future. It\nshall be my ambition to enlarge the oasis round my house, and to give\nit the lordly shade of fine trees. My turf, though Provencal, shall be\nalways green. I shall carry my park up the hillside and plant on the\nhighest point some pretty kiosque, whence, perhaps, my eyes may catch\nthe shimmer of the Mediterranean. Orange and lemon trees, and all\nchoicest things that grow, shall embellish my retreat; and there will I\nbe a mother among my children. The poetry of Nature, which nothing can\ndestroy, shall hedge us round; and standing loyally at the post of\nduty, we need fear no danger. My religious feelings are shared by my\nfather-in-law and by the Chevalier.\n\nAh! darling, my life unrolls itself before my eyes like one of the great\nhighways of France, level and easy, shaded with evergreen trees. This\ncentury will not see another Bonaparte; and my children, if I have\nany, will not be rent from me. They will be mine to train and make men\nof--the joy of my life. If you also are true to your destiny, you\nwho ought to find your mate amongst the great ones of the earth, the\nchildren of your Renee will not lack a zealous protectress.\n\nFarewell, then, for me at least, to the romances and thrilling\nadventures in which we used ourselves to play the part of heroine. The\nwhole story of my life lies before me now; its great crises will be\nthe teething and nutrition of the young Masters de l'Estorade, and the\nmischief they do to my shrubs and me. To embroider their caps, to\nbe loved and admired by a sickly man at the mouth of the Gemenos\nvalley--there are my pleasures. Perhaps some day the country dame may go\nand spend a winter in Marseilles; but danger does not haunt the purlieus\nof a narrow provincial stage. There will be nothing to fear, not even an\nadmiration such as could only make a woman proud. We shall take a great\ndeal of interest in the silkworms for whose benefit our mulberry-leaves\nwill be sold! We shall know the strange vicissitudes of life in\nProvence, and the storms that may attack even a peaceful household.\nQuarrels will be impossible, for M. de l'Estorade has formally announced\nthat he will leave the reins in his wife's hands; and as I shall\ndo nothing to remind him of this wise resolve, it is likely he may\npersevere in it.\n\nYou, my dear Louise, will supply the romance of my life. So you must\nnarrate to me in full all your adventures, describe your balls and\nparties, tell me what you wear, what flowers crown your lovely golden\nlocks, and what are the words and manners of the men you meet. Your\nother self will be always there--listening, dancing, feeling her\nfinger-tips pressed--with you. If only I could have some fun in Paris\nnow and then, while you played the house-mother at La Crampade! such\nis the name of our grange. Poor M. de l'Estorade, who fancies he is\nmarrying one woman! Will he find out there are two?\n\nI am writing nonsense now, and as henceforth I can only be foolish by\nproxy, I had better stop. One kiss, then, on each cheek--my lips are\nstill virginal, he has only dared to take my hand. Oh! our deference and\npropriety are quite disquieting, I assure you. There, I am off again....\nGood-bye, dear.\n\n_P. S._--I have just opened your third letter. My dear, I have about one\nthousand livres to dispose of; spend them for me on pretty things, such\nas we can't find here, nor even at Marseilles. While speeding on your\nown business, give a thought to the recluse of La Crampade. Remember\nthat on neither side have the heads of the family any people of taste in\nParis to make their purchases. I shall reply to your letter later.\n\n\n\n\nVI. DON FELIPE HENAREZ TO DON FERNAND PARIS, September.\n\nThe address of this letter, my brother, will show you that the head of\nyour house is out of reach of danger. If the massacre of our ancestors\nin the Court of Lions made Spaniards and Christians of us against our\nwill, it left us a legacy of Arab cunning; and it may be that I owe my\nsafety to the blood of the Abencerrages still flowing in my veins.\n\nFear made Ferdinand's acting so good, that Valdez actually believed in\nhis protestations. But for me the poor Admiral would have been done\nfor. Nothing, it seems, will teach the Liberals what a king is. This\nparticular Bourbon has been long known to me; and the more His Majesty\nassured me of his protection, the stronger grew my suspicions. A true\nSpaniard has no need to repeat a promise. A flow of words is a sure sign\nof duplicity.\n\nValdez took ship on an English vessel. For myself, no sooner did I see\nthe cause of my beloved Spain wrecked in Andalusia, than I wrote to the\nsteward of my Sardinian estate to make arrangements for my escape. Some\nhardy coral fishers were despatched to wait for me at a point on the\ncoast; and when Ferdinand urged the French to secure my person, I was\nalready in my barony of Macumer, amidst brigands who defy all law and\nall avengers.\n\nThe last Hispano-Moorish family of Granada has found once more the\nshelter of an African desert, and even a Saracen horse, in an estate\nwhich comes to it from Saracens. How the eyes of these brigands--who but\nyesterday had dreaded my authority--sparkled with savage joy and\npride when they found they were protecting against the King of Spain's\nvendetta the Duc de Soria, their master and a Henarez--the first who had\ncome to visit them since the time when the island belonged to the Moors.\nMore than a score of rifles were ready to point at Ferdinand of Bourbon,\nson of a race which was still unknown when the Abencerrages arrived as\nconquerors on the banks of the Loire.\n\nMy idea had been to live on the income of these huge estates, which,\nunfortunately, we have so greatly neglected; but my stay there convinced\nme that this was impossible, and that Queverdo's reports were only too\ncorrect. The poor man had twenty-two lives at my disposal, and not\na single _real_; prairies of twenty thousand acres, and not a house;\nvirgin forests, and not a stick of furniture! A million piastres and\na resident master for half a century would be necessary to make these\nmagnificent lands pay. I must see to this.\n\nThe conquered have time during their flight to ponder their own case and\nthat of their vanquished party. At the spectacle of my noble country, a\ncorpse for monks to prey on, my eyes filled with tears; I read in it the\npresage of Spain's gloomy future.\n\nAt Marseilles I heard of Riego's end. Painfully did it come home to\nme that my life also would henceforth be a martyrdom, but a martyrdom\nprotracted and unnoticed. Is existence worthy the name, when a man can\nno longer die for his country or live for a woman? To love, to conquer,\nthis twofold form of the same thought, is the law graven on our sabres,\nemblazoned on the vaulted roofs of our palaces, ceaselessly whispered\nby the water, which rises and falls in our marble fountains. But in vain\ndoes it nerve my heart; the sabre is broken, the palace in ashes, the\nliving spring sucked up by the barren sand.\n\nHere, then, is my last will and testament.\n\nDon Fernand, you will understand now why I put a check upon your ardor\nand ordered you to remain faithful to the _rey netto_. As your brother\nand friend, I implore you to obey me; as your master, I command. You\nwill go to the King and will ask from him the grant of my dignities and\nproperty, my office and titles. He will perhaps hesitate, and may treat\nyou to some regal scowls; but you must tell him that you are loved by\nMarie Heredia, and that Marie can marry none but a Duc de Soria. This\nwill make the King radiant. It is the immense fortune of the Heredia\nfamily which alone has stood between him and the accomplishment of my\nruin. Your proposal will seem to him, therefore, to deprive me of a last\nresource, and he will gladly hand over to you my spoils.\n\nYou will then marry Marie. The secret of the mutual love against which\nyou fought was no secret to me, and I have prepared the old Count to see\nyou take my place. Marie and I were merely doing what was expected of us\nin our position and carrying out the wishes of our fathers; everything\nelse is in your favor. You are beautiful as a child of love, and are\npossessed of Marie's heart. I am an ill-favored Spanish grandee, for\nwhom she feels an aversion to which she will not confess. Some slight\nreluctance there may be on the part of the noble Spanish girl on account\nof my misfortunes, but this you will soon overcome.\n\nDuc de Soria, your predecessor would neither cost you a regret nor rob\nyou of a maravedi. My mother's diamonds, which will suffice to make me\nindependent, I will keep, because the gap caused by them in the family\nestate can be filled by Marie's jewels. You can send them, therefore, by\nmy nurse, old Urraca, the only one of my servants whom I wish to retain.\nNo one can prepare my chocolate as she does.\n\nDuring our brief revolution, my life of unremitting toil was reduced to\nthe barest necessaries, and these my salary was sufficient to provide.\nYou will therefore find the income of the last two years in the hands of\nyour steward. This sum is mine; but a Duc de Soria cannot marry without\na large expenditure of money, therefore we will divide it. You will not\nrefuse this wedding-present from your brigand brother. Besides, I mean\nto have it so.\n\nThe barony of Macumer, not being Spanish territory, remains to me. Thus\nI have still a country and a name, should I wish to take up a position\nin the world again.\n\nThank Heaven, this finishes our business, and the house of Soria is\nsaved!\n\nAt the very moment when I drop into simple Baron de Macumer, the French\ncannon announce the arrival of the Duc d'Angouleme. You will understand\nwhy I break off....\n\nOctober.\n\nWhen I arrived here I had not ten doubloons in my pocket. He would\nindeed be a poor sort of leader who, in the midst of calamities he has\nnot been able to avert, has found means to feather his own nest. For the\nvanquished Moor there remains a horse and the desert; for the Christian\nfoiled of his hopes, the cloister and a few gold pieces.\n\nBut my present resignation is mere weariness. I am not yet so near the\nmonastery as to have abandoned all thoughts of life. Ozalga had given me\nseveral letters of introduction to meet all emergencies, amongst these\none to a bookseller, who takes with our fellow-countrymen the place\nwhich Galignani holds with the English in Paris. This man has found\neight pupils for me at three francs a lesson. I go to my pupils every\nalternate day, so that I have four lessons a day and earn twelve francs,\nwhich is more than I require. When Urraca comes I shall make some\nSpanish exile happy by passing on to him my connection.\n\nI lodge in the Rue Hillerin-Bertin with a poor widow, who takes\nboarders. My room faces south and looks out on a little garden. It is\nperfectly quiet; I have green trees to look upon, and spend the sum\nof one piastre a day. I am amazed at the amount of calm, pure pleasure\nwhich I enjoy in this life, after the fashion of Dionysius at Corinth.\nFrom sunrise until ten o'clock I smoke and take my chocolate, sitting at\nmy window and contemplating two Spanish plants, a broom which rises out\nof a clump of jessamine--gold on a white ground, colors which must send\na thrill through any scion of the Moors. At ten o'clock I start for my\nlessons, which last till four, when I return for dinner. Afterwards I\nread and smoke till I go to bed.\n\nI can put up for a long time with a life like this, compounded of work\nand meditation, of solitude and society. Be happy, therefore, Fernand;\nmy abdication has brought no afterthoughts; I have no regrets like\nCharles V., no longing to try the game again like Napoleon. Five days\nand nights have passed since I wrote my will; to my mind they might have\nbeen five centuries. Honor, titles, wealth, are for me as though they\nhad never existed.\n\nNow that the conventional barrier of respect which hedged me round has\nfallen, I can open my heart to you, dear boy. Though cased in the armor\nof gravity, this heart is full of tenderness and devotion, which have\nfound no object, and which no woman has divined, not even she who, from\nher cradle, has been my destined bride. In this lies the secret of\nmy political enthusiasm. Spain has taken the place of a mistress and\nreceived the homage of my heart. And now Spain, too, is gone! Beggared\nof all, I can gaze upon the ruin of what once was me and speculate over\nthe mysteries of my being.\n\nWhy did life animate this carcass, and when will it depart? Why has that\nrace, pre-eminent in chivalry, breathed all its primitive virtues--its\ntropical love, its fiery poetry--into this its last offshoot, if the\nseed was never to burst its rugged shell, if no stem was to spring\nforth, no radiant flower scatter aloft its Eastern perfumes? Of what\ncrime have I been guilty before my birth that I can inspire no love? Did\nfate from my very infancy decree that I should be stranded, a useless\nhulk, on some barren shore! I find in my soul the image of the deserts\nwhere my fathers ranged, illumined by a scorching sun which shrivels up\nall life. Proud remnant of a fallen race, vain force, love run to waste,\nan old man in the prime of youth, here better than elsewhere shall I\nawait the last grace of death. Alas! under this murky sky no spark will\nkindle these ashes again to flame. Thus my last words may be those of\nChrist, _My God, Thou hast forsaken me!_ Cry of agony and terror, to the\ncore of which no mortal has ventured yet to penetrate!\n\nYou can realize now, Fernand, what a joy it is to me to live afresh in\nyou and Marie. I shall watch you henceforth with the pride of a creator\nsatisfied in his work. Love each other well and go on loving if you\nwould not give me pain; any discord between you would hurt me more than\nit would yourselves.\n\nOur mother had a presentiment that events would one day serve her\nwishes. It may be that the longing of a mother constitutes a pact\nbetween herself and God. Was she not, moreover, one of those mysterious\nbeings who can hold converse with Heaven and bring back thence a vision\nof the future? How often have I not read in the lines of her forehead\nthat she was coveting for Fernand the honors and the wealth of Felipe!\nWhen I said so to her, she would reply with tears, laying bare the\nwounds of a heart, which of right was the undivided property of both her\nsons, but which an irresistible passion gave to you alone.\n\nHer spirit, therefore, will hover joyfully above your heads as you bow\nthem at the altar. My mother, have you not a caress for your Felipe now\nthat he has yielded to your favorite even the girl whom you regretfully\nthrust into his arms? What I have done is pleasing to our womankind,\nto the dead, and to the King; it is the will of God. Make no difficulty\nthen, Fernand; obey, and be silent.\n\n_P. S._ Tell Urraca to be sure and call me nothing but M. Henarez. Don't\nsay a word about me to Marie. You must be the one living soul to know\nthe secrets of the last Christianized Moor, in whose veins runs the\nblood of a great family, which took its rise in the desert and is now\nabout to die out in the person of a solitary exile.\n\nFarewell.\n\n\n\n\nVII. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE\n\nWHAT! To be married so soon. But this is unheard of. At the end of a\nmonth you become engaged to a man who is a stranger to you, and about\nwhom you know nothing. The man may be deaf--there are so many kinds of\ndeafness!--he may be sickly, tiresome, insufferable!\n\nDon't you see, Renee, what they want with you? You are needful for\ncarrying on the glorious stock of the l'Estorades, that is all. You will\nbe buried in the provinces. Are these the promises we made each other?\nWere I you, I would sooner set off to the Hyeres islands in a caique,\non the chance of being captured by an Algerian corsair and sold to the\nGrand Turk. Then I should be a Sultana some day, and wouldn't I make a\nstir in the harem while I was young--yes, and afterwards too!\n\nYou are leaving one convent to enter another. I know you; you are a\ncoward, and you will submit to the yoke of family life with a lamblike\ndocility. But I am here to direct you; you must come to Paris. There\nwe shall drive the men wild and hold a court like queens. Your husband,\nsweetheart, in three years from now may become a member of the Chamber.\nI know all about members now, and I will explain it to you. You will\nwork that machine very well; you can live in Paris, and become there\nwhat my mother calls a woman of fashion. Oh! you needn't suppose I will\nleave you in your grange!\n\nMonday.\n\nFor a whole fortnight now, my dear, I have been living the life of\nsociety; one evening at the Italiens, another at the Grand Opera, and\nalways a ball afterwards. Ah! society is a witching world. The music of\nthe Opera enchants me; and whilst my soul is plunged in divine pleasure,\nI am the centre of admiration and the focus of all the opera-glasses.\nBut a single glance will make the boldest youth drop his eyes.\n\nI have seen some charming young men there; all the same, I don't care\nfor any of them; not one has roused in me the emotion which I feel when\nI listen to Garcia in his splendid duet with Pellegrini in _Otello_.\nHeavens! how jealous Rossini must have been to express jealousy so well!\nWhat a cry in \"Il mio cor si divide!\" I'm speaking Greek to you, for you\nnever heard Garcia, but then you know how jealous I am!\n\nWhat a wretched dramatist Shakespeare is! Othello is in love with glory;\nhe wins battles, he gives orders, he struts about and is all over the\nplace while Desdemona sits at home; and Desdemona, who sees herself\nneglected for the silly fuss of public life, is quite meek all the time.\nSuch a sheep deserves to be slaughtered. Let the man whom I deign to\nlove beware how he thinks of anything but loving me!\n\nFor my part, I like those long trials of the old-fashioned chivalry.\nThat lout of a young lord, who took offence because his sovereign-lady\nsent him down among the lions to fetch her glove, was, in my opinion,\nvery impertinent, and a fool too. Doubtless the lady had in reserve\nfor him some exquisite flower of love, which he lost, as he well\ndeserved--the puppy!\n\nBut here am I running on as though I had not a great piece of news to\ntell you. My father is certainly going to represent our master the King\nat Madrid. I say _our_ master, for I shall make part of the embassy. My\nmother wishes to remain here, and my father will take me so as to have\nsome woman with him.\n\nMy dear, this seems to you, no doubt, very simple, but there are horrors\nbehind it, all the same: in a fortnight I have probed the secrets of the\nhouse. My mother would accompany my father to Madrid if he would take\nM. de Canalis as a secretary to the embassy. But the King appoints\nthe secretaries; the Duke dare neither annoy the King, who hates to be\nopposed, nor vex my mother; and the wily diplomat believes he has cut\nthe knot by leaving the Duchess here. M. de Canalis, who is the great\npoet of the day, is the young man who cultivates my mother's society,\nand who no doubt studies diplomacy with her from three o'clock to five.\nDiplomacy must be a fine subject, for he is as regular as a gambler on\nthe Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Duc de Rhetore, our elder brother, solemn, cold, and whimsical,\nwould be extinguished by his father at Madrid, therefore he remains in\nParis. Miss Griffith has found out also that Alphonse is in love with a\nballet-girl at the Opera. How is it possible to fall in love with legs\nand pirouettes? We have noticed that my brother comes to the theatre\nonly when Tullia dances there; he applauds the steps of this creature,\nand then goes out. Two ballet-girls in a family are, I fancy, more\ndestructive than the plague. My second brother is with his regiment, and\nI have not yet seen him. Thus it comes about that I have to act as\nthe Antigone of His Majesty's ambassador. Perhaps I may get married in\nSpain, and perhaps my father's idea is a marriage there without dowry,\nafter the pattern of yours with this broken-down guard of honor. My\nfather asked if I would go with him, and offered me the use of his\nSpanish master.\n\n\"Spain, the country for castles in the air!\" I cried. \"Perhaps you hope\nthat it may mean marriages for me!\"\n\nFor sole reply he honored me with a meaning look. For some days he has\namused himself with teasing me at lunch; he watches me, and I dissemble.\nIn this way I have played with him cruelly as father and ambassador _in\npetto_. Hadn't he taken me for a fool? He asked me what I thought of\nthis and that young man, and of some girls whom I had met in several\nhouses. I replied with quite inane remarks on the color of their hair,\ntheir faces, and the difference in their figures. My father seemed\ndisappointed at my crassness, and inwardly blamed himself for having\nasked me.\n\n\"Still, father,\" I added, \"don't suppose I am saying what I really\nthink: mother made me afraid the other day that I had spoken more\nfrankly than I ought of my impressions.\"\n\n\"With your family you can speak quite freely,\" my mother replied.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" I went on. \"The young men I have met so far strike\nme as too self-centered to excite interest in others; they are much more\ntaken up with themselves than with their company. They can't be accused\nof lack of candor at any rate. They put on a certain expression to talk\nto us, and drop it again in a moment, apparently satisfied that we don't\nuse our eyes. The man as he converses is the lover; silent, he is the\nhusband. The girls, again, are so artificial that it is impossible to\nknow what they really are, except from the way they dance; their figures\nand movements alone are not a sham. But what has alarmed me most in this\nfashionable society is its brutality. The little incidents which take\nplace when supper is announced give one some idea--to compare small\nthings with great--of what a popular rising might be. Courtesy is only\na thin veneer on the general selfishness. I imagined society very\ndifferent. Women count for little in it; that may perhaps be a survival\nof Bonapartist ideas.\"\n\n\"Armande is coming on extraordinarily,\" said my mother.\n\n\"Mother, did you think I should never get beyond asking to see Mme. de\nStael?\"\n\nMy father smiled, and rose from the table.\n\nSaturday.\n\nMy dear, I have left one thing out. Here is the tidbit I have reserved\nfor you. The love which we pictured must be extremely well hidden; I\nhave seen not a trace of it. True, I have caught in drawing-rooms now\nand again a quick exchange of glances, but how colorless it all is!\nLove, as we imagined it, a world of wonders, of glorious dreams, of\ncharming realities, of sorrows that waken sympathy, and smiles that make\nsunshine, does not exist. The bewitching words, the constant interchange\nof happiness, the misery of absence, the flood of joy at the presence\nof the beloved one--where are they? What soil produces these radiant\nflowers of the soul? Which is wrong? We or the world?\n\nI have already seen hundreds of men, young and middle-aged; not one has\nstirred the least feeling in me. No proof of admiration and devotion on\ntheir part, not even a sword drawn in my behalf, would have moved me.\nLove, dear, is the product of such rare conditions that it is quite\npossible to live a lifetime without coming across the being on whom\nnature has bestowed the power of making one's happiness. The thought is\nenough to make one shudder; for if this being is found too late, what\nthen?\n\nFor some days I have begun to tremble when I think of the destiny of\nwomen, and to understand why so many wear a sad face beneath the flush\nbrought by the unnatural excitement of social dissipation. Marriage is\na mere matter of chance. Look at yours. A storm of wild thoughts\nhas passed over my mind. To be loved every day the same, yet with a\ndifference, to be loved as much after ten years of happiness as on the\nfirst day!--such a love demands years. The lover must be allowed to\nlanguish, curiosity must be piqued and satisfied, feeling roused and\nresponded to.\n\nIs there, then, a law for the inner fruits of the heart, as there is\nfor the visible fruits of nature? Can joy be made lasting? In what\nproportion should love mingle tears with pleasures? The cold policy of\nthe funereal, monotonous, persistent routine of the convent seemed to me\nat these moments the only real life; while the wealth, the splendor, the\ntears, the delights, the triumph, the joy, the satisfaction, of a love\nequal, shared, and sanctioned, appeared a mere idle vision.\n\nI see no room in this city for the gentle ways of love, for precious\nwalks in shady alleys, the full moon sparkling on the water, while the\nsuppliant pleads in vain. Rich, young, and beautiful, I have only to\nlove, and love would become my sole occupation, my life; yet in the\nthree months during which I have come and gone, eager and curious,\nnothing has appealed to me in the bright, covetous, keen eyes around me.\nNo voice has thrilled me, no glance has made the world seem brighter.\n\nMusic alone has filled my soul, music alone has at all taken the place\nof our friendship. Sometimes, at night, I will linger for an hour by\nmy window, gazing into the garden, summoning the future, with all it\nbrings, out of the mystery which shrouds it. There are days too when,\nhaving started for a drive, I get out and walk in the Champs-Elysees,\nand picture to myself that the man who is to waken my slumbering soul\nis at hand, that he will follow and look at me. Then I meet only\nmountebanks, vendors of gingerbread, jugglers, passers-by hurrying to\ntheir business, or lovers who try to escape notice. These I am tempted\nto stop, asking them, \"You who are happy, tell me what is love.\"\n\nBut the impulse is repressed, and I return to my carriage, swearing\nto die an old maid. Love is undoubtedly an incarnation, and how many\nconditions are needful before it can take place! We are not certain of\nnever quarreling with ourselves, how much less so when there are two?\nThis is a problem which God alone can solve.\n\nI begin to think that I shall return to the convent. If I remain in\nsociety, I shall do things which will look like follies, for I cannot\npossibly reconcile myself to what I see. I am perpetually wounded either\nin my sense of delicacy, my inner principles, or my secret thoughts.\n\nAh! my mother is the happiest of women, adored as she is by Canalis,\nher great little man. My love, do you know I am seized sometimes with a\nhorrible craving to know what goes on between my mother and that young\nman? Griffith tells me she has gone through all these moods; she has\nlonged to fly at women, whose happiness was written in their face; she\nhas blackened their character, torn them to pieces. According to her,\nvirtue consists in burying all these savage instincts in one's innermost\nheart. But what then of the heart? It becomes the sink of all that is\nworst in us.\n\nIt is very humiliating that no adorer has yet turned up for me. I am\na marriageable girl, but I have brothers, a family, relations, who are\nsensitive on the point of honor. Ah! if that is what keeps men back,\nthey are poltroons.\n\nThe part of Chimene in the _Cid_ and that of the Cid delight me. What a\nmarvelous play! Well, good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE SAME TO THE SAME January.\n\nOur master is a poor refugee, forced to keep in hiding on account of\nthe part he played in the revolution which the Duc d'Angouleme has\njust quelled--a triumph to which we owe some splendid fetes. Though a\nLiberal, and doubtless a man of the people, he has awakened my interest:\nI fancy that he must have been condemned to death. I make him talk for\nthe purpose of getting at his secret; but he is of a truly Castilian\ntaciturnity, proud as though he were Gonsalvo di Cordova, and\nnevertheless angelic in his patience and gentleness. His pride is not\nirritable like Miss Griffith's, it belongs to his inner nature; he\nforces us to civility because his own manners are so perfect, and holds\nus at a distance by the respect he shows us. My father declares that\nthere is a great deal of the nobleman in Senor Henarez, whom, among\nourselves, he calls in fun Don Henarez.\n\nA few days ago I took the liberty of addressing him thus. He raised his\neyes, which are generally bent on the ground, and flashed a look from\nthem that quite abashed me; my dear, he certainly has the most beautiful\neyes imaginable. I asked him if I had offended him in any way, and he\nsaid to me in his grand, rolling Spanish:\n\n\"I am here only to teach you Spanish.\"\n\nI blushed and felt quite snubbed. I was on the point of making some pert\nanswer, when I remembered what our dear mother in God used to say to us,\nand I replied instead:\n\n\"It would be a kindness to tell me if you have anything to complain of.\"\n\nA tremor passed through him, the blood rose in his olive cheeks; he\nreplied in a voice of some emotion:\n\n\"Religion must have taught you, better than I can, to respect the\nunhappy. Had I been a _don_ in Spain, and lost everything in the triumph\nof Ferdinand VII., your witticism would be unkind; but if I am only\na poor teacher of languages, is it not a heartless satire? Neither is\nworthy of a young lady of rank.\"\n\nI took his hand, saying:\n\n\"In the name of religion also, I beg you to pardon me.\"\n\nHe bowed, opened my _Don Quixote_, and sat down.\n\nThis little incident disturbed me more than the harvest of compliments,\ngazing and pretty speeches on my most successful evening. During the\nlesson I watched him attentively, which I could do the more safely, as\nhe never looks at me.\n\nAs the result of my observations, I made out that the tutor, whom we\ntook to be forty, is a young man, some years under thirty. My governess,\nto whom I had handed him over, remarked on the beauty of his black hair\nand of his pearly teeth. As to his eyes, they are velvet and fire; but\nhe is plain and insignificant. Though the Spaniards have been described\nas not a cleanly people, this man is most carefully got up, and his\nhands are whiter than his face. He stoops a little, and has an extremely\nlarge, oddly-shaped head. His ugliness, which, however, has a dash of\npiquancy, is aggravated by smallpox marks, which seam his face. His\nforehead is very prominent, and the shaggy eyebrows meet, giving a\nrepellent air of harshness. There is a frowning, plaintive look on his\nface, reminding one of a sickly child, which owes its life to superhuman\ncare, as Sister Marthe did. As my father observed, his features are a\nshrunken reproduction of those of Cardinal Ximenes. The natural dignity\nof our tutor's manners seems to disconcert the dear Duke, who doesn't\nlike him, and is never at ease with him; he can't bear to come in\ncontact with superiority of any kind.\n\nAs soon as my father knows enough Spanish, we start for Madrid. When\nHenarez returned, two days after the reproof he had given me, I remarked\nby way of showing my gratitude:\n\n\"I have no doubt that you left Spain in consequence of political events.\nIf my father is sent there, as seems to be expected, we shall be in a\nposition to help you, and might be able to obtain your pardon, in case\nyou are under sentence.\"\n\n\"It is impossible for any one to help me,\" he replied.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"is that because you refuse to accept any help, or\nbecause the thing itself is impossible?\"\n\n\"Both,\" he said, with a bow, and in a tone which forbade continuing the\nsubject.\n\nMy father's blood chafed in my veins. I was offended by this haughty\ndemeanor, and promptly dropped Senor Henarez.\n\nAll the same, my dear, there is something fine in this rejection of\nany aid. \"He would not accept even our friendship,\" I reflected, whilst\nconjugating a verb. Suddenly I stopped short and told him what was in\nmy mind, but in Spanish. Henarez replied very politely that equality\nof sentiment was necessary between friends, which did not exist in this\ncase, and therefore it was useless to consider the question.\n\n\"Do you mean equality in the amount of feeling on either side, or\nequality in rank?\" I persisted, determined to shake him out of this\nprovoking gravity.\n\nHe raised once more those awe-inspiring eyes, and mine fell before them.\nDear, this man is a hopeless enigma. He seemed to ask whether my words\nmeant love; and the mixture of joy, pride, and agonized doubt in his\nglance went to my heart. It was plain that advances, which would be\ntaken for what they were worth in France, might land me in difficulties\nwith a Spaniard, and I drew back into my shell, feeling not a little\nfoolish.\n\nThe lesson over, he bowed, and his eyes were eloquent of the humble\nprayer: \"Don't trifle with a poor wretch.\"\n\nThis sudden contrast to his usual grave and dignified manner made a\ngreat impression on me. It seems horrible to think and to say, but I\ncan't help believing that there are treasures of affection in that man.\n\n\n\n\nIX. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU. December.\n\nAll is over, my dear child, and it is Mme. de l'Estorade who writes to\nyou. But between us there is no change; it is only a girl the less.\n\nDon't be troubled; I did not give my consent recklessly or without much\nthought. My life is henceforth mapped out for me, and the freedom\nfrom all uncertainty as to the road for me to follow suits my mind and\ndisposition. A great moral power has stepped in, and once for all swept\nwhat we call chance out of my life. We have the property to develop, our\nhome to beautify and adorn; for me there is also a household to direct\nand sweeten and a husband to reconcile to life. In all probability I\nshall have a family to look after, children to educate.\n\nWhat would you have? Everyday life cannot be cast in heroic mould. No\ndoubt there seems, at any rate at first sight, no room left in this\nscheme of life for that longing after the infinite which expands the\nmind and soul. But what is there to prevent me from launching on that\nboundless sea our familiar craft? Nor must you suppose that the humble\nduties to which I dedicate my life give no scope for passion. To restore\nfaith in happiness to an unfortunate, who has been the sport of adverse\ncircumstances, is a noble work, and one which alone may suffice to\nrelieve the monotony of my existence. I can see no opening left for\nsuffering, and I see a great deal of good to be done. I need not hide\nfrom you that the love I have for Louis de l'Estorade is not of the kind\nwhich makes the heart throb at the sound of a step, and thrills us at\nthe lightest tones of a voice, or the caress of a burning glance; but,\non the other hand, there is nothing in him which offends me.\n\nWhat am I to do, you will ask, with that instinct for all which is great\nand noble, with those mental energies, which have made the link between\nus, and which we still possess? I admit that this thought has troubled\nme. But are these faculties less ours because we keep them concealed,\nusing them only in secret for the welfare of the family, as instruments\nto produce the happiness of those confided to our care, to whom we are\nbound to give ourselves without reserve? The time during which a woman\ncan look for admiration is short, it will soon be past; and if my life\nhas not been a great one, it will at least have been calm, tranquil,\nfree from shocks.\n\nNature has favored our sex in giving us a choice between love and\nmotherhood. I have made mine. My children shall be my gods, and this\nspot of earth my Eldorado.\n\nI can say no more to-day. Thank you much for all the things you have\nsent me. Give a glance at my needs on the enclosed list. I am determined\nto live in an atmosphere of refinement and luxury, and to take from\nprovincial life only what makes its charm. In solitude a woman can never\nbe vulgarized--she remains herself. I count greatly on your kindness for\nkeeping me up to the fashion. My father-in-law is so delighted that he\ncan refuse me nothing, and turns his house upside down. We are getting\nworkpeople from Paris and renovating everything.\n\n\n\n\nX. MLLE. DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE January.\n\nOh! Renee, you have made me miserable for days! So that bewitching body,\nthose beautiful proud features, that natural grace of manner, that soul\nfull of priceless gifts, those eyes, where the soul can slake its thirst\nas at a fountain of love, that heart, with its exquisite delicacy,\nthat breadth of mind, those rare powers--fruit of nature and of\nour interchange of thought--treasures whence should issue a unique\nsatisfaction for passion and desire, hours of poetry to outweigh years,\njoys to make a man serve a lifetime for one gracious gesture,--all this\nis to be buried in the tedium of a tame, commonplace marriage, to vanish\nin the emptiness of an existence which you will come to loath! I hate\nyour children before they are born. They will be monsters!\n\nSo you know all that lies before you; you have nothing left to hope,\nor fear, or suffer? And supposing the glorious morning rises which will\nbring you face to face with the man destined to rouse you from the sleep\ninto which you are plunging!... Ah! a cold shiver goes through me at the\nthought!\n\nWell, at least you have a friend. You, it is understood, are to be the\nguardian angel of your valley. You will grow familiar with its beauties,\nwill live with it in all its aspects, till the grandeur of nature,\nthe slow growth of vegetation, compared with the lightning rapidity of\nthought, become like a part of yourself; and as your eye rests on\nthe laughing flowers, you will question your own heart. When you walk\nbetween your husband, silent and contented, in front, and your children\nscreaming and romping behind, I can tell you beforehand what you\nwill write to me. Your misty valley, your hills, bare or clothed with\nmagnificent trees, your meadow, the wonder of Provence, with its\nfresh water dispersed in little runlets, the different effects of the\natmosphere, this whole world of infinity which laps you round, and which\nGod has made so various, will recall to you the infinite sameness of\nyour soul's life. But at least I shall be there, my Renee, and in me you\nwill find a heart which no social pettiness shall ever corrupt, a heart\nall your own.\n\nMonday.\n\nMy dear, my Spaniard is quite adorably melancholy; there is something\ncalm, severe, manly, and mysterious about him which interests me\nprofoundly. His unvarying solemnity and the silence which envelops him\nact like an irritant on the mind. His mute dignity is worthy of a fallen\nking. Griffith and I spend our time over him as though he were a riddle.\n\nHow odd it is! A language-master captures my fancy as no other man has\ndone. Yet by this time I have passed in review all the young men of\nfamily, the attaches to embassies, and the ambassadors, generals, and\ninferior officers, the peers of France, their sons and nephews, the\ncourt, and the town.\n\nThe coldness of the man provokes me. The sandy waste which he tries to\nplace, and does place, between us is covered by his deeprooted pride; he\nwraps himself in mystery. The hanging back is on his side, the boldness\non mine. This odd situation affords me the more amusement because the\nwhole thing is mere trifling. What is a man, a Spaniard, and a teacher\nof languages to me? I make no account of any man whatever, were he a\nking. We are worth far more, I am sure, than the greatest of them. What\na slave I would have made of Napoleon! If he had loved me, shouldn't he\nhave felt the whip!\n\nYesterday I aimed a shaft at M. Henarez which must have touched him to\nthe quick. He made no reply; the lesson was over, and he bowed with a\nglance at me, in which I read that he would never return. This suits\nme capitally; there would be something ominous in starting an imitation\n_Nouvelle Heloise_. I have just been reading Rousseau's, and it has left\nme with a strong distaste for love. Passion which can argue and moralize\nseems to me detestable.\n\nClarissa also is much too pleased with herself and her long, little\nletter; but Richardson's work is an admirable picture, my father tells\nme, of English women. Rousseau's seems to me a sort of philosophical\nsermon, cast in the form of letters.\n\nLove, as I conceive it, is a purely subjective poem. In all that books\ntell us about it, there is nothing which is not at once false and true.\nAnd so, my pretty one, as you will henceforth be an authority only on\nconjugal love, it seems to me my duty--in the interest, of course, of\nour common life--to remain unmarried, and have a grand passion, so that\nwe may enlarge our experience.\n\nTell me every detail of what happens to you, especially in the first\nfew days, with that strange animal called a husband. I promise to do the\nsame for you if ever I am loved.\n\nFarewell, poor martyred darling.\n\n\n\n\nXI. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU La Crampade.\n\nYour Spaniard and you make me shudder, my darling. I write this line to\nbeg of you to dismiss him. All that you say of him corresponds with the\ncharacter of those dangerous adventurers who, having nothing to lose,\nwill take any risk. This man cannot be your husband, and must not be\nyour lover. I will write to you more fully about the inner history of my\nmarried life when my heart is free from the anxiety your last letter has\nroused in it.\n\n\n\n\nXII. MLLE. DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE February.\n\nAt nine o'clock this morning, sweetheart, my father was announced in my\nrooms. I was up and dressed. I found him solemnly seated beside the fire\nin the drawing-room, looking more thoughtful than usual. He pointed to\nthe armchair opposite to him. Divining his meaning, I sank into it\nwith a gravity, which so well aped his, that he could not refrain from\nsmiling, though the smile was dashed with melancholy.\n\n\"You are quite a match for your grandmother in quick-wittedness,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Come, father, don't play the courtier here,\" I replied; \"you want\nsomething from me.\"\n\nHe rose, visibly agitated, and talked to me for half an hour. This\nconversation, dear, really ought to be preserved. As soon as he had\ngone, I sat down to my table and tried to recall his words. This is the\nfirst time that I have seen my father revealing his inner thoughts.\n\nHe began by flattering me, and he did not do it badly. I was bound to be\ngrateful to him for having understood and appreciated me.\n\n\"Armande,\" he said, \"I was quite mistaken in you, and you have agreeably\nsurprised me. When you arrived from the convent, I took you for an\naverage young girl, ignorant and not particularly intelligent, easily\nto be bought off with gewgaws and ornaments, and with little turn for\nreflection.\"\n\n\"You are complimentary to young girls, father.\"\n\n\"Oh! there is no such thing as youth nowadays,\" he said, with the air\nof a diplomat. \"Your mind is amazingly open. You take everything at\nits proper worth; your clear-sightedness is extraordinary, there is no\nhoodwinking you. You pass for being blind, and all the time you have\nlaid your hand on causes, while other people are still puzzling over\neffects. In short, you are a minister in petticoats, the only person\nhere capable of understanding me. It follows, then, that if I have any\nsacrifice to ask from you, it is only to yourself I can turn for help in\npersuading you.\n\n\"I am therefore going to explain to you, quite frankly, my former plans,\nto which I still adhere. In order to recommend them to you, I must show\nthat they are connected with feelings of a very high order, and I\nshall thus be obliged to enter into political questions of the greatest\nimportance to the kingdom, which might be wearisome to any one less\nintelligent than you are. When you have heard me, I hope you will take\ntime for consideration, six months if necessary. You are entirely your\nown mistress; and if you decline to make the sacrifice I ask, I shall\nbow to your decision and trouble you no further.\"\n\nThis preface, my sweetheart, made me really serious, and I said:\n\n\"Speak, father.\"\n\nHere, then, is the deliverance of the statesman:\n\n\"My child, France is in a very critical position, which is understood\nonly by the King and a few superior minds. But the King is a head\nwithout arms; the great nobles, who are in the secret of the danger,\nhave no authority over the men whose co-operation is needful in order\nto bring about a happy result. These men, cast up by popular election,\nrefuse to lend themselves as instruments. Even the able men among them\ncarry on the work of pulling down society, instead of helping us to\nstrengthen the edifice.\n\n\"In a word, there are only two parties--the party of Marius and the\nparty of Sulla. I am for Sulla against Marius. This, roughly speaking,\nis our position. To go more into details: the Revolution is still\nactive; it is embedded in the law and written on the soil; it fills\npeople's minds. The danger is all the greater because the greater number\nof the King's counselors, seeing it destitute of armed forces and of\nmoney, believe it completely vanquished. The King is an able man, and\nnot easily blinded; but from day to day he is won over by his brother's\npartisans, who want to hurry things on. He has not two years to live,\nand thinks more of a peaceful deathbed than of anything else.\n\n\"Shall I tell you, my child, which is the most destructive of all the\nconsequences entailed by the Revolution? You would never guess. In Louis\nXVI. the Revolution has decapitated every head of a family. The family\nhas ceased to exist; we have only individuals. In their desire to become\na nation, Frenchmen have abandoned the idea of empire; in proclaiming\nthe equal rights of all children to their father's inheritance, they\nhave killed the family spirit and created the State treasury. But all\nthis has paved the way for weakened authority, for the blind force\nof the masses, for the decay of art and the supremacy of individual\ninterests, and has left the road open to the foreign invader.\n\n\"We stand between two policies--either to found the State on the basis\nof the family, or to rest it on individual interest--in other words,\nbetween democracy and aristocracy, between free discussion and\nobedience, between Catholicism and religious indifference. I am among\nthe few who are resolved to oppose what is called the people, and\nthat in the people's true interest. It is not now a question of feudal\nrights, as fools are told, nor of rank; it is a question of the State\nand of the existence of France. The country which does not rest on the\nfoundation of paternal authority cannot be stable. That is the foot of\nthe ladder of responsibility and subordination, which has for its summit\nthe King.\n\n\"The King stands for us all. To die for the King is to die for oneself,\nfor one's family, which, like the kingdom, cannot die. All animals have\ncertain instincts; the instinct of man is for family life. A country\nis strong which consists of wealthy families, every member of whom is\ninterested in defending a common treasure; it is weak when composed of\nscattered individuals, to whom it matters little whether they obey seven\nor one, a Russian or a Corsican, so long as each keeps his own plot\nof land, blind, in their wretched egotism, to the fact that the day is\ncoming when this too will be torn from them.\n\n\"Terrible calamities are in store for us, in case our party fails.\nNothing will be left but penal or fiscal laws--your money or your life.\nThe most generous nation on the earth will have ceased to obey the\ncall of noble instincts. Wounds past curing will have been fostered and\naggravated, an all pervading jealousy being the first. Then the upper\nclasses will be submerged; equality of desire will be taken for equality\nof strength; true distinction, even when proved and recognized, will\nbe threatened by the advancing tide of middle-class prejudice. It\nwas possible to choose one man out of a thousand, but, amongst three\nmillions, discrimination becomes impossible, when all are moved by\nthe same ambitions and attired in the same livery of mediocrity. No\nforesight will warn this victorious horde of that other terrible horde,\nsoon to be arrayed against them in the peasant proprietors; in other\nwords, twenty million acres of land, alive, stirring, arguing, deaf to\nreason, insatiable of appetite, obstructing progress, masters in their\nbrute force----\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, interrupting my father, \"what can I do to help the State.\nI feel no vocation for playing Joan of Arc in the interests of the\nfamily, or for finding a martyr's block in the convent.\"\n\n\"You are a little hussy,\" cried my father. \"If I speak sensibly to you,\nyou are full of jokes; when I jest, you talk like an ambassadress.\"\n\n\"Love lives on contrasts,\" was my reply.\n\nAnd he laughed till the tears stood in his eyes.\n\n\"You will reflect on what I have told you; you will do justice to the\nlarge and confiding spirit in which I have broached the matter, and\npossibly events may assist my plans. I know that, so far as you are\nconcerned, they are injurious and unfair, and this is the reason why I\nappeal for your sanction of them less to your heart and your imagination\nthan to your reason. I have found more judgment and commonsense in you\nthan in any one I know----\"\n\n\"You flatter yourself,\" I said, with a smile, \"for I am every inch your\nchild!\"\n\n\"In short,\" he went on, \"one must be logical. You can't have the end\nwithout the means, and it is our duty to set an example to others. From\nall this I deduce that you ought not to have money of your own till your\nyounger brother is provided for, and I want to employ the whole of your\ninheritance in purchasing an estate for him to go with the title.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"you won't interfere with my living in my own fashion and\nenjoying life if I leave you my fortune?\"\n\n\"Provided,\" he replied, \"that your view of life does not conflict with\nthe family honor, reputation, and, I may add, glory.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" I cried, \"what has become of my excellent judgment?\"\n\n\"There is not in all France,\" he said with bitterness, \"a man who would\ntake for wife a daughter of one of our noblest families without a dowry\nand bestow one on her. If such a husband could be found, it would\nbe among the class of rich _parvenus_; on this point I belong to the\neleventh century.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" I said. \"But why despair? Are there no aged peers?\"\n\n\"You are an apt scholar, Louise!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThen he left me, smiling and kissing my hand.\n\nI received your letter this very morning, and it led me to contemplate\nthat abyss into which you say that I may fall. A voice within seemed\nto utter the same warning. So I took my precautions. Henarez, my dear,\ndares to look at me, and his eyes are disquieting. They inspire me with\nwhat I can only call an unreasoning dread. Such a man ought no more to\nbe looked at than a frog; he is ugly and fascinating.\n\nFor two days I have been hesitating whether to tell my father\npoint-blank that I want no more Spanish lessons and have Henarez sent\nabout his business. But in spite of all my brave resolutions, I feel\nthat the horrible sensation which comes over me when I see that man has\nbecome necessary to me. I say to myself, \"Once more, and then I will\nspeak.\"\n\nHis voice, my dear, is sweetly thrilling; his speaking is just like la\nFodor's singing. His manners are simple, entirely free from affectation.\nAnd what teeth!\n\nJust now, as he was leaving, he seemed to divine the interest I take\nin him, and made a gesture--oh! most respectfully--as though to take my\nhand and kiss it; then checked himself, apparently terrified at his own\nboldness and the chasm he had been on the point of bridging. There was\nthe merest suggestion of all this, but I understood it and smiled, for\nnothing is more pathetic than to see the frank impulse of an inferior\nchecking itself abashed. The love of a plebeian for a girl of noble\nbirth implies such courage!\n\nMy smile emboldened him. The poor fellow looked blindly about for his\nhat; he seemed determined not to find it, and I handed it to him with\nperfect gravity. His eyes were wet with unshed tears. It was a mere\npassing moment, yet a world of facts and ideas were contained in it. We\nunderstood each other so well that, on a sudden, I held out my hand for\nhim to kiss.\n\nPossibly this was equivalent to telling him that love might bridge\nthe interval between us. Well, I cannot tell what moved me to do it.\nGriffith had her back turned as I proudly extended my little white paw.\nI felt the fire of his lips, tempered by two big tears. Oh! my love, I\nlay in my armchair, nerveless, dreamy. I was happy, and I cannot\nexplain to you how or why. What I felt only a poet could express.\nMy condescension, which fills me with shame now, seemed to me then\nsomething to be proud of; he had fascinated me, that is my one excuse.\n\nFriday.\n\nThis man is really very handsome. He talks admirably, and has remarkable\nintellectual power. My dear, he is a very Bossuet in force and\npersuasiveness when he explains the mechanism, not only of the Spanish\ntongue, but also of human thought and of all language. His mother tongue\nseems to be French. When I expressed surprise at this, he replied that\nhe came to France when quite a boy, following the King of Spain to\nValencay.\n\nWhat has passed within this enigmatic being? He is no longer the same\nman. He came, dressed quite simply, but just as any gentleman would for\na morning walk. He put forth all his eloquence, and flashed wit, like\nrays from a beacon, all through the lesson. Like a man roused from\nlethargy, he revealed to me a new world of thoughts. He told me the\nstory of some poor devil of a valet who gave up his life for a single\nglance from a queen of Spain.\n\n\"What could he do but die?\" I exclaimed.\n\nThis delighted him, and he looked at me in a way which was truly\nalarming.\n\nIn the evening I went to a ball at the Duchesse de Lenoncourt's. The\nPrince de Talleyrand happened to be there; and I got M. de Vandenesse,\na charming young man, to ask him whether, among the guests at his\ncountry-place in 1809, he remembered any one of the name of Henarez.\nVandenesse reported the Prince's reply, word for word, as follows:\n\n\"Henarez is the Moorish name of the Soria family, who are, they say,\ndescendants of the Abencerrages, converted to Christianity. The old Duke\nand his two sons were with the King. The eldest, the present Duke de\nSoria, has just had all his property, titles, and dignities confiscated\nby King Ferdinand, who in this way avenges a long-standing feud. The\nDuke made a huge mistake in consenting to form a constitutional ministry\nwith Valdez. Happily, he escaped from Cadiz before the arrival of the\nDuc d'Angouleme, who, with the best will in the world, could not have\nsaved him from the King's wrath.\"\n\nThis information gave me much food for reflection. I cannot describe to\nyou the suspense in which I passed the time till my next lesson, which\ntook place this morning.\n\nDuring the first quarter of an hour I examined him closely, debating\ninwardly whether he were duke or commoner, without being able to come to\nany conclusion. He seemed to read my fancies as they arose and to take\npleasure in thwarting them. At last I could endure it no longer. Putting\ndown my book suddenly, I broke off the translation I was making of it\naloud, and said to him in Spanish:\n\n\"You are deceiving us. You are no poor middle-class Liberal. You are the\nDuke de Soria!\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he replied, with a gesture of sorrow, \"unhappily, I am\nnot the Duc de Soria.\"\n\nI felt all the despair with which he uttered the word \"unhappily.\" Ah!\nmy dear, never should I have conceived it possible to throw so much\nmeaning and passion into a single word. His eyes had dropped, and he\ndared no longer look at me.\n\n\"M. de Talleyrand,\" I said, \"in whose house you spent your years of\nexile, declares that any one bearing the name of Henarez must either be\nthe late Duc de Soria or a lacquey.\"\n\nHe looked at me with eyes like two black burning coals, at once blazing\nand ashamed. The man might have been in the torture-chamber. All he said\nwas:\n\n\"My father was in truth the servant of the King of Spain.\"\n\nGriffith could make nothing of this sort of lesson. An awkward silence\nfollowed each question and answer.\n\n\"In one word,\" I said, \"are you a nobleman or not?\"\n\n\"You know that in Spain even beggars are noble.\"\n\nThis reticence provoked me. Since the last lesson I had given play to my\nimagination in a little practical joke. I had drawn an ideal portrait\nof the man whom I should wish for my lover in a letter which I designed\ngiving to him to translate. So far, I had only put Spanish into French,\nnot French into Spanish; I pointed this out to him, and begged Griffith\nto bring me the last letter I had received from a friend of mine.\n\n\"I shall find out,\" I thought, from the effect my sketch has on him,\n\"what sort of blood runs in his veins.\"\n\nI took the paper from Griffith's hands, saying:\n\n\"Let me see if I have copied it rightly.\"\n\nFor it was all in my writing. I handed him the paper, or, if you will,\nthe snare, and I watched him while he read as follows:\n\n\"He who is to win my heart, my dear, must be harsh and unbending with\nmen, but gentle with women. His eagle eye must have power to quell with\na single glance the least approach to ridicule. He will have a pitying\nsmile for those who would jeer at sacred things, above all, at\nthat poetry of the heart, without which life would be but a dreary\ncommonplace. I have the greatest scorn for those who would rob us of\nthe living fountain of religious beliefs, so rich in solace. His faith,\ntherefore, should have the simplicity of a child, though united to the\nfirm conviction of an intelligent man, who has examined the foundations\nof his creed. His fresh and original way of looking at things must be\nentirely free from affectation or desire to show off. His words will\nbe few and fit, and his mind so richly stored, that he cannot possibly\nbecome a bore to himself any more than to others.\n\n\"All his thoughts must have a high and chivalrous character, without\nalloy of self-seeking; while his actions should be marked by a total\nabsence of interested or sordid motives. Any weak points he may have\nwill arise from the very elevation of his views above those of the\ncommon herd, for in every respect I would have him superior to his age.\nEver mindful of the delicate attentions due to the weak, he will be\ngentle to all women, but not prone lightly to fall in love with any; for\nlove will seem to him too serious to turn into a game.\n\n\"Thus it might happen that he would spend his life in ignorance of\ntrue love, while all the time possessing those qualities most fitted\nto inspire it. But if ever he find the ideal woman who has haunted his\nwaking dreams, if he meet with a nature capable of understanding his\nown, one who could fill his soul and pour sunlight over his life, could\nshine as a star through the mists of this chill and gloomy world, lend\nfresh charm to existence, and draw music from the hitherto silent chords\nof his being--needless to say, he would recognize and welcome his good\nfortune.\n\n\"And she, too, would be happy. Never, by word or look, would he wound\nthe tender heart which abandoned itself to him, with the blind trust of\na child reposing in its mother's arms. For were the vision shattered, it\nwould be the wreck of her inner life. To the mighty waters of love she\nwould confide her all!\n\n\"The man I picture must belong, in expression, in attitude, in gait, in\nhis way of performing alike the smallest and the greatest actions, to\nthat race of the truly great who are always simple and natural. He need\nnot be good-looking, but his hands must be beautiful. His upper lip will\ncurl with a careless, ironic smile for the general public, whilst he\nreserves for those he loves the heavenly, radiant glance in which he\nputs his soul.\"\n\n\"Will mademoiselle allow me,\" he said in Spanish, in a voice full of\nagitation, \"to keep this writing in memory of her? This is the last\nlesson I shall have the honor of giving her, and that which I have just\nreceived in these words may serve me for an abiding rule of life. I\nleft Spain, a fugitive and penniless, but I have to-day received from\nmy family a sum sufficient for my needs. You will allow me to send some\npoor Spaniard in my place.\"\n\nIn other words, he seemed to me to say, \"This little game must stop.\" He\nrose with an air of marvelous dignity, and left me quite upset by such\nunheard-of delicacy in a man of his class. He went downstairs and asked\nto speak with my father.\n\nAt dinner my father said to me with a smile:\n\n\"Louise, you have been learning Spanish from an ex-minister and a man\ncondemned to death.\"\n\n\"The Duc de Soria,\" I said.\n\n\"Duke!\" replied my father. \"No, he is not that any longer; he takes the\ntitle now of Baron de Macumer from a property which still remains to him\nin Sardinia. He is something of an original, I think.\"\n\n\"Don't brand with that word, which with you always implies some mockery\nand scorn, a man who is your equal, and who, I believe, has a noble\nnature.\"\n\n\"Baronne de Macumer?\" exclaimed my father, with a laughing glance at me.\n\nPride kept my eyes fixed on the table.\n\n\"But,\" said my mother, \"Henarez must have met the Spanish ambassador on\nthe steps?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my father, \"the ambassador asked me if I was conspiring\nagainst the King, his master; but he greeted the ex-grandee of Spain\nwith much deference, and placed his services at his disposal.\"\n\nAll this, dear, Mme. de l'Estorade, happened a fortnight ago, and it\nis a fortnight now since I have seen the man who loves me, for that he\nloves me there is not a doubt. What is he about? If only I were a fly,\nor a mouse, or a sparrow! I want to see him alone, myself unseen, at his\nhouse. Only think, a man exists, to whom I can say, \"Go and die for me!\"\nAnd he is so made that he would go, at least I think so. Anyhow, there\nis in Paris a man who occupies my thoughts, and whose glance pours\nsunshine into my soul. Is not such a man an enemy, whom I ought to\ntrample under foot? What? There is a man who has become necessary to\nme--a man without whom I don't know how to live! You married, and I--in\nlove! Four little months, and those two doves, whose wings erst bore\nthem so high, have fluttered down upon the flat stretches of real life!\n\nSunday.\n\nYesterday, at the Italian Opera, I could feel some one was looking at\nme; my eyes were drawn, as by a magnet, to two wells of fire, gleaming\nlike carbuncles in a dim corner of the orchestra. Henarez never moved\nhis eyes from me. The wretch had discovered the one spot from which\nhe could see me--and there he was. I don't know what he may be as a\npolitician, but for love he has a genius.\n\n  Behold, my fair Renee, where our business now stands,\n\nas the great Corneille has said.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU LA CRAMPADE, February.\n\nMy dear Louise,--I was bound to wait some time before writing to you;\nbut now I know, or rather I have learned, many things which, for the\nsake of your future happiness, I must tell you. The difference between\na girl and a married woman is so vast, that the girl can no more\ncomprehend it than the married woman can go back to girlhood again.\n\nI chose to marry Louis de l'Estorade rather than return to the convent;\nthat at least is plain. So soon as I realized that the convent was the\nonly alternative to marrying Louis, I had, as girls say, to \"submit,\"\nand my submission once made, the next thing was to examine the situation\nand try to make the best of it.\n\nThe serious nature of what I was undertaking filled me at first with\nterror. Marriage is a matter concerning the whole of life, whilst love\naims only at pleasure. On the other hand, marriage will remain when\npleasures have vanished, and it is the source of interests far more\nprecious than those of the man and woman entering on the alliance. Might\nit not therefore be that the only requisite for a happy marriage was\nfriendship--a friendship which, for the sake of these advantages, would\nshut its eyes to many of the imperfections of humanity? Now there was\nno obstacle to the existence of friendship between myself and Louis\nde l'Estorade. Having renounced all idea of finding in marriage those\ntransports of love on which our minds used so often, and with such\nperilous rapture, to dwell, I found a gentle calm settling over me.\n\"If debarred from love, why not seek for happiness?\" I said to myself.\n\"Moreover, I am loved, and the love offered me I shall accept. My\nmarried life will be no slavery, but rather a perpetual reign. What is\nthere to say against such a situation for a woman who wishes to remain\nabsolute mistress of herself?\"\n\nThe important point of separating marriage from marital rights was\nsettled in a conversation between Louis and me, in the course of which\nhe gave proof of an excellent temper and a tender heart. Darling, my\ndesire was to prolong that fair season of hope which, never culminating\nin satisfaction, leaves to the soul its virginity. To grant nothing\nto duty or the law, to be guided entirely by one's own will, retaining\nperfect independence--what could be more attractive, more honorable?\n\nA contract of this kind, directly opposed to the legal contract, and\neven to the sacrament itself, could be concluded only between Louis and\nme. This difficulty, the first which has arisen, is the only one which\nhas delayed the completion of our marriage. Although, at first, I\nmay have made up my mind to accept anything rather than return to the\nconvent, it is only in human nature, having got an inch, to ask for an\nell, and you and I, sweet love, are of those who would have it all.\n\nI watched Louis out of the corner of my eye, and put it to myself, \"Has\nsuffering had a softening or a hardening effect on him?\" By dint of\nclose study, I arrived at the conclusion that his love amounted to a\npassion. Once transformed into an idol, whose slightest frown would turn\nhim white and trembling, I realized that I might venture anything. I\ndrew him aside in the most natural manner on solitary walks, during\nwhich I discreetly sounded his feelings. I made him talk, and got him to\nexpound to me his ideas and plans for our future. My questions betrayed\nso many preconceived notions, and went so straight for the weak points\nin this terrible dual existence, that Louis has since confessed to me\nthe alarm it caused him to find in me so little of the ignorant maiden.\n\nThen I listened to what he had to say in reply. He got mixed up in his\narguments, as people do when handicapped by fear; and before long it\nbecame clear that chance had given me for adversary one who was the\nless fitted for the contest because he was conscious of what you\nmagniloquently call my \"greatness of soul.\" Broken by sufferings and\nmisfortune, he looked on himself as a sort of wreck, and three fears in\nespecial haunted him.\n\nFirst, we are aged respectively thirty-seven and seventeen; and he could\nnot contemplate without quaking the twenty years that divide us. In the\nnext place, he shares our views on the subject of my beauty, and it is\ncruel for him to see how the hardships of his life have robbed him\nof youth. Finally, he felt the superiority of my womanhood over his\nmanhood. The consciousness of these three obvious drawbacks made him\ndistrustful of himself; he doubted his power to make me happy, and\nguessed that he had been chosen as the lesser of two evils.\n\nOne evening he tentatively suggested that I only married him to escape\nthe convent.\n\n\"I cannot deny it,\" was my grave reply.\n\nMy dear, it touched me to the heart to see the two great tears which\nstood in his eyes. Never before had I experienced the shock of emotion\nwhich a man can impart to us.\n\n\"Louis,\" I went on, as kindly as I could, \"it rests entirely with you\nwhether this marriage of convenience becomes one to which I can give\nmy whole heart. The favor I am about to ask from you will demand\nunselfishness on your part, far nobler than the servitude to which a\nman's love, when sincere, is supposed to reduce him. The question is,\nCan you rise to the height of friendship such as I understand it?\n\n\"Life gives us but one friend, and I wish to be yours. Friendship is the\nbond between a pair of kindred souls, united in their strength, and yet\nindependent. Let us be friends and comrades to bear jointly the burden\nof life. Leave me absolutely free. I would put no hindrance in the\nway of your inspiring me with a love similar to your own; but I am\ndetermined to be yours only of my own free gift. Create in me the wish\nto give up my freedom, and at once I lay it at your feet.\n\n\"Infuse with passion, then, if you will, this friendship, and let the\nvoice of love disturb its calm. On my part I will do what I can to bring\nmy feelings into accord with yours. One thing, above all, I would beg\nof you. Spare me the annoyances to which the strangeness of our mutual\nposition might give rise to our relations with others. I am neither\nwhimsical nor prudish, and should be sorry to get that reputation; but\nI feel sure that I can trust to your honor when I ask you to keep up the\noutward appearance of wedded life.\"\n\nNever, dear, have I seen a man so happy as my proposal made Louis. The\nblaze of joy which kindled in his eyes dried up the tears.\n\n\"Do not fancy,\" I concluded, \"that I ask this from any wish to be\neccentric. It is the great desire I have for your respect which prompts\nmy request. If you owe the crown of your love merely to the legal and\nreligious ceremony, what gratitude could you feel to me later for a\ngift in which my goodwill counted for nothing? If during the time that I\nremained indifferent to you (yielding only a passive obedience, such as\nmy mother has just been urging on me) a child were born to us, do you\nsuppose that I could feel towards it as I would towards one born of our\ncommon love? A passionate love may not be necessary in marriage, but, at\nleast, you will admit that there should be no repugnance. Our position\nwill not be without its dangers; in a country life, such as ours will\nbe, ought we not to bear in mind the evanescent nature of passion? Is it\nnot simple prudence to make provision beforehand against the calamities\nincident to change of feeling?\"\n\nHe was greatly astonished to find me at once so reasonable and so apt at\nreasoning; but he made me a solemn promise, after which I took his hand\nand pressed it affectionately.\n\nWe were married at the end of the week. Secure of my freedom, I was able\nto throw myself gaily into the petty details which always accompany a\nceremony of the kind, and to be my natural self. Perhaps I may have been\ntaken for an old bird, as they say at Blois. A young girl, delighted\nwith the novel and hopeful situation she had contrived to make for\nherself, and may have passed for a strong-minded female.\n\nDear, the difficulties which would beset my life had appeared to\nme clearly as in a vision, and I was sincerely anxious to make the\nhappiness of the man I married. Now, in the solitude of a life like\nours, marriage soon becomes intolerable unless the woman is the\npresiding spirit. A woman in such a case needs the charm of a mistress,\ncombined with the solid qualities of a wife. To introduce an element\nof uncertainty into pleasure is to prolong illusion, and render lasting\nthose selfish satisfactions which all creatures hold, and should shroud\na woman in expectancy, crown her sovereign, and invest her with an\nexhaustless power, a redundancy of life, that makes everything blossom\naround her. The more she is mistress of herself, the more certainly will\nthe love and happiness she creates be fit to weather the storms of life.\n\nBut, above all, I have insisted on the greatest secrecy in regard to\nour domestic arrangements. A husband who submits to his wife's yoke\nis justly held an object of ridicule. A woman's influence ought to be\nentirely concealed. The charm of all we do lies in its unobtrusiveness.\nIf I have made it my task to raise a drooping courage and restore their\nnatural brightness to gifts which I have dimly descried, it must all\nseem to spring from Louis himself.\n\nSuch is the mission to which I dedicate myself, a mission surely not\nignoble, and which might well satisfy a woman's ambition. Why, I could\nglory in this secret which shall fill my life with interest, in this\ntask towards which my every energy shall be bent, while it remains\nconcealed from all but God and you.\n\nI am very nearly happy now, but should I be so without a friendly heart\nin which to pour the confession? For how make a confidant of him? My\nhappiness would wound him, and has to be concealed. He is sensitive as a\nwoman, like all men who have suffered much.\n\nFor three months we remained as we were before marriage. As you may\nimagine, during this time I made a close study of many small personal\nmatters, which have more to do with love than is generally supposed. In\nspite of my coldness, Louis grew bolder, and his nature expanded. I saw\non his face a new expression, a look of youth. The greater refinement\nwhich I introduced into the house was reflected in his person.\nInsensibly I became accustomed to his presence, and made another self\nof him. By dint of constant watching I discovered how his mind and\ncountenance harmonize. \"The animal that we call a husband,\" to quote\nyour words, disappeared, and one balmy evening I discovered in his stead\na lover, whose words thrilled me and on whose arm I leant with pleasure\nbeyond words. In short, to be open with you, as I would be with God,\nbefore whom concealment is impossible, the perfect loyalty with which\nhe had kept his oath may have piqued me, and I felt a fluttering of\ncuriosity in my heart. Bitterly ashamed, I struggled with myself. Alas!\nwhen pride is the only motive for resistance, excuses for capitulation\nare soon found.\n\nWe celebrated our union in secret, and secret it must remain between us.\nWhen you are married you will approve this reserve. Enough that nothing\nwas lacking either of satisfaction for the most fastidious sentiment, or\nof that unexpectedness which brings, in a sense, its own sanction. Every\nwitchery of imagination, of passion, of reluctance overcome, of the\nideal passing into reality, played its part.\n\nYet, in spite of all this enchantment, I once more stood out for my\ncomplete independence. I can't tell you all my reasons for this. To\nyou alone shall I confide even as much as this. I believe that women,\nwhether passionately loved or not, lose much in their relation with\ntheir husbands by not concealing their feelings about marriage and the\nway they look at it.\n\nMy one joy, and it is supreme, springs from the certainty of having\nbrought new life to my husband before I have borne him any children.\nLouis has regained his youth, strength, and spirits. He is not the same\nman. With magic touch I have effaced the very memory of his sufferings.\nIt is a complete metamorphosis. Louis is really very attractive now.\nFeeling sure of my affection, he throws off his reserve and displays\nunsuspected gifts.\n\nTo be the unceasing spring of happiness for a man who knows it and adds\ngratitude to love, ah! dear one, this is a conviction which fortifies\nthe soul, even more than the most passionate love can do. The force\nthus developed--at once impetuous and enduring, simple and\ndiversified--brings forth ultimately the family, that noble product of\nwomanhood, which I realize now in all its animating beauty.\n\nThe old father has ceased to be a miser. He gives blindly whatever I\nwish for. The servants are content; it seems as though the bliss of\nLouis had let a flood of sunshine into the household, where love has\nmade me queen. Even the old man would not be a blot upon my pretty home,\nand has brought himself into line with all my improvements; to please me\nhe has adopted the dress, and with the dress, the manners of the day.\n\nWe have English horses, a coupe, a barouche, and a tilbury. The livery\nof our servants is simple but in good taste. Of course we are looked\non as spendthrifts. I apply all my intellect (I am speaking quite\nseriously) to managing my household with economy, and obtaining for it\nthe maximum of pleasure with the minimum of cost.\n\nI have already convinced Louis of the necessity of getting roads made,\nin order that he may earn the reputation of a man interested in the\nwelfare of his district. I insist too on his studying a great deal.\nBefore long I hope to see him a member of the Council General of the\nDepartment, through the influence of my family and his mother's. I have\ntold him plainly that I am ambitious, and that I was very well pleased\nhis father should continue to look after the estate and practise\neconomies, because I wished him to devote himself exclusively to\npolitics. If we had children, I should like to see them all prosperous\nand with good State appointments. Under penalty, therefore, of\nforfeiting my esteem and affection, he must get himself chosen deputy\nfor the department at the coming elections; my family would support his\ncandidature, and we should then have the delight of spending all our\nwinters in Paris. Ah! my love, by the ardor with which he embraced my\nplans, I can gauge the depth of his affection.\n\nTo conclude here is a letter he wrote me yesterday from Marseilles,\nwhere he had gone to spend a few hours:\n\n  \"MY SWEET RENEE,--When you gave me permission to love you, I began\n  to believe in happiness; now, I see it unfolding endlessly before\n  me. The past is merely a dim memory, a shadowy background, without\n  which my present bliss would show less radiant. When I am with\n  you, love so transports me that I am powerless to express the\n  depth of my affection; I can but worship and admire. Only at a\n  distance does the power of speech return. You are supremely\n  beautiful, Renee, and your beauty is of the statuesque and regal\n  type, on which time leaves but little impression. No doubt the\n  love of husband and wife depends less on outward beauty than on\n  graces of character, which are yours also in perfection; still,\n  let me say that the certainty of having your unchanging beauty, on\n  which to feast my eyes, gives me a joy that grows with every\n  glance. There is a grace and dignity in the lines of your face,\n  expressive of the noble soul within, and breathing of purity\n  beneath the vivid coloring. The brilliance of your dark eyes, the\n  bold sweep of your forehead, declare a spirit of no common\n  elevation, sound and trustworthy in every relation, and well\n  braced to meet the storms of life, should such arise. The keynote\n  of your character is its freedom from all pettiness. You do not\n  need to be told all this; but I write it because I would have you\n  know that I appreciate the treasure I possess. Your favors to me,\n  however slight, will always make my happiness in the far-distant\n  future as now; for I am sensible how much dignity there is in our\n  promise to respect each other's liberty. Our own impulse shall\n  with us alone dictate the expression of feeling. We shall be free\n  even in our fetters. I shall have the more pride in wooing you\n  again now that I know the reward you place on victory. You cannot\n  speak, breathe, act, or think, without adding to the admiration I\n  feel for your charm both of body and mind. There is in you a rare\n  combination of the ideal, the practical, and the bewitching which\n  satisfies alike judgment, a husband's pride, desire, and hope, and\n  which extends the boundaries of love beyond those of life itself.\n  Oh! my loved one, may the genius of love remain faithful to me,\n  and the future be full of those delights by means of which you\n  have glorified all that surrounds me! I long for the day which\n  shall make you a mother, that I may see you content with the\n  fulness of your life, may hear you, in the sweet voice I love and\n  with the thoughts, bless the love which has refreshed my soul and\n  given new vigor to my powers, the love which is my pride, and\n  whence I have drawn, as from a magic fountain, fresh life. Yes, I\n  shall be all that you would have me. I shall take a leading part\n  in the public life of the district, and on you shall fall the rays\n  of a glory which will owe its existence to the desire of pleasing\n  you.\"\n\nSo much for my pupil, dear! Do you suppose he could have written like\nthis before? A year hence his style will have still further improved.\nLouis is now in his first transport; what I look forward to is the\nuniform and continuous sensation of content which ought to be the fruit\nof a happy marriage, when a man and woman, in perfect trust and mutual\nknowledge, have solved the problem of giving variety to the infinite.\nThis is the task set before every true wife; the answer begins to dawn\non me, and I shall not rest till I have made it mine.\n\nYou see that he fancies himself--vanity of men!--the chosen of my heart,\njust as though there were no legal bonds. Nevertheless, I have not yet\ngot beyond that external attraction which gives us strength to put up\nwith a good deal. Yet Louis is lovable; his temper is wonderfully even,\nand he performs, as a matter of course, acts on which most men would\nplume themselves. In short, if I do not love him, I shall find no\ndifficulty in being good to him.\n\nSo here are my black hair and my black eyes--whose lashes act, according\nto you, like Venetian blinds--my commanding air, and my whole person,\nraised to the rank of sovereign power! Ten years hence, dear, why should\nwe not both be laughing and gay in your Paris, whence I shall carry you\noff now and again to my beautiful oasis in Provence?\n\nOh! Louise, don't spoil the splendid future which awaits us both! Don't\ndo the mad things with which you threaten me. My husband is a young man,\nprematurely old; why don't you marry some young-hearted graybeard in the\nChamber of Peers? There lies your vocation.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. THE DUC DE SORIA TO THE BARON DE MACUMER MADRID.\n\nMY DEAR BROTHER,--You did not make me Duc de Soria in order that my\nactions should belie the name. How could I tolerate my happiness if\nI knew you to be a wanderer, deprived of the comforts which wealth\neverywhere commands? Neither Marie nor I will consent to marry till we\nhear that you have accepted the money which Urraca will hand over to\nyou. These two millions are the fruit of your own savings and Marie's.\n\nWe have both prayed, kneeling before the same altar--and with what\nearnestness, God knows!--for your happiness. My dear brother, it cannot\nbe that these prayers will remain unanswered. Heaven will send you the\nlove which you seek, to be the consolation of your exile. Marie read\nyour letter with tears, and is full of admiration for you. As for me,\nI consent, not for my own sake, but for that of the family. The King\njustified your expectations. Oh! that I might avenge you by letting him\nsee himself, dwarfed before the scorn with which you flung him his toy,\nas you might toss a tiger its food.\n\nThe only thing I have taken for myself, dear brother, is my happiness.\nI have taken Marie. For this I shall always be beholden to you, as the\ncreature to the Creator. There will be in my life and in Marie's one day\nnot less glorious than our wedding day--it will be the day when we hear\nthat your heart has found its mate, that a woman loves you as you ought\nto be, and would be, loved. Do not forget that if you live for us, we\nalso live for you.\n\nYou can write to us with perfect confidence under cover to the Nuncio,\nsending your letters _via_ Rome. The French ambassador at Rome will,\nno doubt, undertake to forward them to Monsignore Bemboni, at the State\nSecretary's office, whom our legate will have advised. No other way\nwould be safe. Farewell, dear exile, dear despoiled one. Be proud at\nleast of the happiness which you have brought to us, if you cannot be\nhappy in it. God will doubtless hear our prayers, which are full of your\nname.\n\n\n\n\nXV. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE March.\n\nAh! my love, marriage is making a philosopher of you! Your darling face\nmust, indeed, have been jaundiced when you wrote me those terrible views\nof human life and the duty of women. Do you fancy you will convert me to\nmatrimony by your programme of subterranean labors?\n\nAlas! is this then the outcome for you of our too-instructed dreams! We\nleft Blois all innocent, armed with the pointed shafts of meditation,\nand, lo! the weapons of that purely ideal experience have turned against\nyour own breast! If I did not know you for the purest and most angelic\nof created beings, I declare I should say that your calculations smack\nof vice. What, my dear, in the interest of your country home, you submit\nyour pleasures to a periodic thinning, as you do your timber. Oh! rather\nlet me perish in all the violence of the heart's storms than live in the\narid atmosphere of your cautious arithmetic!\n\nAs girls, we were both unusually enlightened, because of the large\namount of study we gave to our chosen subjects; but, my child,\nphilosophy without love, or disguised under a sham love, is the most\nhideous of conjugal hypocrisies. I should imagine that even the biggest\nof fools might detect now and again the owl of wisdom squatting in your\nbower of roses--a ghastly phantom sufficient to put to flight the most\npromising of passions. You make your own fate, instead of waiting, a\nplaything in its hands.\n\nWe are each developing in strange ways. A large dose of philosophy to\na grain of love is your recipe; a large dose of love to a grain of\nphilosophy is mine. Why, Rousseau's Julie, whom I thought so learned, is\na mere beginner to you. Woman's virtue, quotha! How you have weighed up\nlife! Alas! I make fun of you, and, after all, perhaps you are right.\n\nIn one day you have made a holocaust of your youth and become a miser\nbefore your time. Your Louis will be happy, I daresay. If he loves you,\nof which I make no doubt, he will never find out, that, for the sake of\nyour family, you are acting as a courtesan does for money; and certainly\nmen seem to find happiness with them, judging by the fortunes they\nsquander thus. A keen-sighted husband might no doubt remain in love\nwith you, but what sort of gratitude could he feel in the long run for a\nwoman who had made of duplicity a sort of moral armor, as indispensable\nas her stays?\n\nLove, dear, is in my eyes the first principle of all the virtues,\nconformed to the divine likeness. Like all other first principles, it is\nnot a matter of arithmetic; it is the Infinite in us. I cannot but think\nyou have been trying to justify in your own eyes the frightful position\nof a girl, married to a man for whom she feels nothing more than esteem.\nYou prate of duty, and make it your rule and measure; but surely to take\nnecessity as the spring of action is the moral theory of atheism?\nTo follow the impulse of love and feeling is the secret law of every\nwoman's heart. You are acting a man's part, and your Louis will have to\nplay the woman!\n\nOh! my dear, your letter has plunged me into an endless train of\nthought. I see now that the convent can never take the place of mother\nto a girl. I beg of you, my grand angel with the black eyes, so pure\nand proud, so serious and so pretty, do not turn away from these cries,\nwhich the first reading of your letter has torn from me! I have taken\ncomfort in the thought that, while I was lamenting, love was doubtless\nbusy knocking down the scaffolding of reason.\n\nIt may be that I shall do worse than you without any reasoning or\ncalculations. Passion is an element in life bound to have a logic not\nless pitiless than yours.\n\nMonday.\n\nYesterday night I placed myself at the window as I was going to bed, to\nlook at the sky, which was wonderfully clear. The stars were like silver\nnails, holding up a veil of blue. In the silence of the night I could\nhear some one breathing, and by the half-light of the stars I saw my\nSpaniard, perched like a squirrel on the branches of one of the trees\nlining the boulevard, and doubtless lost in admiration of my windows.\n\nThe first effect of this discovery was to make me withdraw into the\nroom, my feet and hands quite limp and nerveless; but, beneath the fear,\nI was conscious of a delicious undercurrent of joy. I was overpowered\nbut happy. Not one of those clever Frenchmen, who aspire to marry me,\nhas had the brilliant idea of spending the night in an elm-tree at the\nrisk of being carried off by the watch. My Spaniard has, no doubt, been\nthere for some time. Ah! he won't give me any more lessons, he wants to\nreceive them--well, he shall have one. If only he knew what I said to\nmyself about his superficial ugliness! Others can philosophize besides\nyou, Renee! It was horrid, I argued, to fall in love with a handsome\nman. Is it not practically avowing that the senses count for three parts\nout of four in a passion which ought to be super-sensual?\n\nHaving got over my first alarm, I craned my neck behind the window in\norder to see him again--and well was I rewarded! By means of a hollow\ncane he blew me in through the window a letter, cunningly rolled round a\nleaden pellet.\n\nGood Heavens! will he suppose I left the window open on purpose?\n\nBut what was to be done? To shut it suddenly would be to make oneself an\naccomplice.\n\nI did better. I returned to my window as though I had seen nothing and\nheard nothing of the letter, then I said aloud:\n\n\"Come and look at the stars, Griffith.\"\n\nGriffith was sleeping as only old maids can. But the Moor, hearing me,\nslid down, and vanished with ghostly rapidity.\n\nHe must have been dying of fright, and so was I, for I did not hear him\ngo away; apparently he remained at the foot of the elm. After a good\nquarter of an hour, during which I lost myself in contemplation of the\nheavens, and battled with the waves of curiosity, I closed my widow and\nsat down on the bed to unfold the delicate bit of paper, with the tender\ntouch of a worker amongst the ancient manuscripts at Naples. It felt\nredhot to my fingers. \"What a horrible power this man has over me!\" I\nsaid to myself.\n\nAll at once I held out the paper to the candle--I would burn it without\nreading a word. Then a thought stayed me, \"What can he have to say that\nhe writes so secretly?\" Well, dear, I _did_ burn it, reflecting that,\nthough any other girl in the world would have devoured the letter, it\nwas not fitting that I--Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu--should read\nit.\n\nThe next day, at the Italian opera, he was at his post. But I feel sure\nthat, ex-prime minister of a constitutional government though he is, he\ncould not discover the slightest agitation of mind in any movement of\nmine. I might have seen nothing and received nothing the evening before.\nThis was most satisfactory to me, but he looked very sad. Poor man! in\nSpain it is so natural for love to come in at the window!\n\nDuring the interval, it seems, he came and walked in the passages. This\nI learned from the chief secretary of the Spanish embassy, who also told\nthe story of a noble action of his.\n\nAs Duc de Soria he was to marry one of the richest heiresses in Spain,\nthe young princess Marie Heredia, whose wealth would have mitigated the\nbitterness of exile. But it seems that Marie, disappointing the wishes\nof the fathers, who had betrothed them in their earliest childhood,\nloved the younger son of the house of Soria, to whom my Felipe, gave her\nup. Allowing himself to be despoiled by the King of Spain.\n\n\"He would perform this piece of heroism quite simply,\" I said to the\nyoung man.\n\n\"You know him then?\" was his ingenuous reply.\n\nMy mother smiled.\n\n\"What will become of him, for he is condemned to death?\" I asked.\n\n\"Though dead to Spain, he can live in Sardinia.\"\n\n\"Ah! then Spain is the country of tombs as well as castles?\" I said,\ntrying to carry it off as a joke.\n\n\"There is everything in Spain, even Spaniards of the old school,\" my\nmother replied.\n\n\"The Baron de Macumer obtained a passport, not without difficulty, from\nthe King of Sardinia,\" the young diplomatist went on. \"He has now become\na Sardinian subject, and he possesses a magnificent estate in the island\nwith full feudal rights. He has a palace at Sassari. If Ferdinand VII.\nwere to die, Macumer would probably go in for diplomacy, and the Court\nof Turin would make him ambassador. Though young, he is--\"\n\n\"Ah! he is young?\"\n\n\"Certainly, mademoiselle... though young, he is one of the most\ndistinguished men in Spain.\"\n\nI scanned the house meanwhile through my opera-glass, and seemed to\nlend an inattentive ear to the secretary; but, between ourselves, I was\nwretched at having burnt his letter. In what terms would a man like that\nexpress his love? For he does love me. To be loved, adored in secret;\nto know that in this house, where all the great men of Paris were\ncollected, there was one entirely devoted to me, unknown to everybody!\nAh! Renee, now I understand the life of Paris, its balls, and its\ngaieties. It all flashed on me in the true light. When we love, we\nmust have society, were it only to sacrifice it to our love. I felt\na different creature--and such a happy one! My vanity, pride,\nself-love,--all were flattered. Heaven knows what glances I cast upon\nthe audience!\n\n\"Little rogue!\" the Duchess whispered in my ear with a smile.\n\nYes, Renee, my wily mother had deciphered the hidden joy in my bearing,\nand I could only haul down my flag before such feminine strategy. Those\ntwo words taught me more of worldly wisdom than I have been able to pick\nup in a year--for we are in March now. Alas! no more Italian opera in\nanother month. How will life be possible without that heavenly music,\nwhen one's heart is full of love?\n\nWhen I got home, my dear, with determination worthy of a Chaulieu, I\nopened my window to watch a shower of rain. Oh! if men knew the magic\nspell that a heroic action throws over us, they would indeed rise to\ngreatness! a poltroon would turn hero! What I had learned about my\nSpaniard drove me into a very fever. I felt certain that he was there,\nready to aim another letter at me.\n\nI was right, and this time I burnt nothing. Here, then, is the first\nlove-letter I have received, madame logician: each to her kind:--\n\n  \"Louise, it is not for your peerless beauty I love you, nor for\n  your gifted mind, your noble feeling, the wondrous charm of all\n  you say and do, nor yet for your pride, your queenly scorn of\n  baser mortals--a pride blent in you with charity, for what angel\n  could be more tender?--Louise, I love you because, for the sake of\n  a poor exile, you have unbent this lofty majesty, because by a\n  gesture, a glance, you have brought consolation to a man so far\n  beneath you that the utmost he could hope for was your pity, the\n  pity of a generous heart. You are the one woman whose eyes have\n  shone with a tenderer light when bent on me.\n\n  \"And because you let fall this glance--a mere grain of dust, yet a\n  grace surpassing any bestowed on me when I stood at the summit of\n  a subject's ambition--I long to tell you, Louise, how dear you are\n  to me, and that my love is for yourself alone, without a thought\n  beyond, a love that far more than fulfils the conditions laid down\n  by you for an ideal passion.\n\n  \"Know, then, idol of my highest heaven, that there is in the world\n  an offshoot of the Saracen race, whose life is in your hands, who\n  will receive your orders as a slave, and deem it an honor to\n  execute them. I have given myself to you absolutely and for the\n  mere joy of giving, for a single glance of your eye, for a touch\n  of the hand which one day you offered to your Spanish master. I am\n  but your servitor, Louise; I claim no more.\n\n  \"No, I dare not think that I could ever be loved; but perchance my\n  devotion may win for me toleration. Since that morning when you\n  smiled upon me with generous girlish impulse, divining the misery\n  of my lonely and rejected heart, you reign there alone. You are\n  the absolute ruler of my life, the queen of my thoughts, the god\n  of my heart; I find you in the sunshine of my home, the fragrance\n  of my flowers, the balm of the air I breathe, the pulsing of my\n  blood, the light that visits me in sleep.\n\n  \"One thought alone troubled this happiness--your ignorance. All\n  unknown to you was this boundless devotion, the trusty arm, the\n  blind slave, the silent tool, the wealth--for henceforth all I\n  possess is mine only as a trust--which lay at your disposal;\n  unknown to you, the heart waiting to receive your confidence, and\n  yearning to replace all that your life (I know it well) has lacked\n  --the liberal ancestress, so ready to meet your needs, a father to\n  whom you could look for protection in every difficulty, a friend,\n  a brother. The secret of your isolation is no secret to me! If I\n  am bold, it is because I long that you should know how much is\n  yours.\n\n  \"Take all, Louise, and is so doing bestow on me the one life\n  possible for me in this world--the life of devotion. In placing\n  the yoke on my neck, you run no risk; I ask nothing but the joy of\n  knowing myself yours. Needless even to say you will never love me;\n  it cannot be otherwise. I must love you from afar, without hope,\n  without reward beyond my own love.\n\n  \"In my anxiety to know whether you will accept me as your servant,\n  I have racked my brain to find some way in which you may\n  communicate with me without any danger of compromising yourself.\n  Injury to your self-respect there can be none in sanctioning a\n  devotion which has been yours for many days without your\n  knowledge. Let this, then, be the token. At the opera this\n  evening, if you carry in your hand a bouquet consisting of one red\n  and one white camellia--emblem of a man's blood at the service of\n  the purity he worships--that will be my answer. I ask no more;\n  thenceforth, at any moment, ten years hence or to-morrow, whatever\n  you demand shall be done, so far as it is possible for man to do\n  it, by your happy servant,\n\n  \"FELIPE HENAREZ.\"\n\n_P. S._--You must admit, dear, that great lords know how to love! See\nthe spring of the African lion! What restrained fire! What loyalty! What\nsincerity! How high a soul in low estate! I felt quite small and dazed\nas I said to myself, \"What shall I do?\"\n\nIt is the mark of a great man that he puts to flight all ordinary\ncalculations. He is at once sublime and touching, childlike and of the\nrace of giants. In a single letter Henarez has outstripped volumes from\nLovelace or Saint-Preux. Here is true love, no beating about the bush.\nLove may be or it may not, but where it is, it ought to reveal itself in\nits immensity.\n\nHere am I, shorn of all my little arts! To refuse or accept! That is the\nalternative boldly presented me, without the ghost of an opening for a\nmiddle course. No fencing allowed! This is no longer Paris; we are in\nthe heart of Spain or the far East. It is the voice of Abencerrage,\nand it is the scimitar, the horse, and the head of Abencerrage which\nhe offers, prostrate before a Catholic Eve! Shall I accept this last\ndescendant of the Moors? Read again and again his Hispano-Saracenic\nletter, Renee dear, and you will see how love makes a clean sweep of all\nthe Judaic bargains of your philosophy.\n\nRenee, your letter lies heavy on my heart; you have vulgarized life for\nme. What need have I for finessing? Am I not mistress for all time of\nthis lion whose roar dies out in plaintive and adoring sighs? Ah! how he\nmust have raged in his lair of the Rue Hillerin-Bertin! I know where he\nlives, I have his card: _F., Baron de Macumer_.\n\nHe has made it impossible for me to reply. All I can do is to fling\ntwo camellias in his face. What fiendish arts does love possess--pure,\nhonest, simple-minded love! Here is the most tremendous crisis of a\nwoman's heart resolved into an easy, simple action. Oh, Asia! I have\nread the _Arabian Nights_, here is their very essence: two flowers,\nand the question is settled. We clear the fourteen volumes of _Clarissa\nHarlowe_ with a bouquet. I writhe before this letter, like a thread in\nthe fire. To take, or not to take, my two camellias. Yes or No, kill or\ngive life! At last a voice cries to me, \"Test him!\" And I will test him.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. THE SAME TO THE SAME March.\n\nI am dressed in white--white camellias in my hair, and another in my\nhand. My mother has red camellias; so it would not be impossible to\ntake one from her--if I wished! I have a strange longing to put off the\ndecision to the last moment, and make him pay for his red camellia by a\nlittle suspense.\n\nWhat a vision of beauty! Griffith begged me to stop for a little and\nbe admired. The solemn crisis of the evening and the drama of my secret\nreply have given me a color; on each cheek I sport a red camellia laid\nupon a white!\n\n1 A. M.\n\nEverybody admired me, but only one adored. He hung his head as I entered\nwith a white camellia, but turned pale as the flower when, later, I took\na red one from my mother's hand. To arrive with the two flowers might\npossibly have been accidental; but this deliberate action was a reply.\nMy confession, therefore, is fuller than it need have been.\n\nThe opera was _Romeo and Juliet_. As you don't know the duet of the two\nlovers, you can't understand the bliss of two neophytes in love, as they\nlisten to this divine outpouring of the heart.\n\nOn returning home I went to bed, but only to count the steps which\nresounded on the sidewalk. My heart and head, darling, are all on fire\nnow. What is he doing? What is he thinking of? Has he a thought, a\nsingle thought, that is not of me? Is he, in very truth, the devoted\nslave he painted himself? How to be sure? Or, again, has it ever entered\nhis head that, if I accept him, I lay myself open to the shadow of a\nreproach or am in any sense rewarding or thanking him? I am harrowed by\nthe hair-splitting casuistry of the heroines in _Cyrus_ and _Astraea_,\nby all the subtle arguments of the court of love.\n\nHas he any idea that, in affairs of love, a woman's most trifling\nactions are but the issue of long brooding and inner conflicts, of\nvictories won only to be lost! What are his thoughts at this moment? How\ncan I give him my orders to write every evening the particulars of the\nday just gone? He is my slave whom I ought to keep busy. I shall deluge\nhim with work!\n\nSunday Morning.\n\nOnly towards morning did I sleep a little. It is midday now. I have just\ngot Griffith to write the following letter:\n\n  \"_To the Baron de Macumer_.\n\n  \"Mademoiselle de Chaulieu begs me, Monsieur le Baron, to ask you\n  to return to her the copy of a letter written to her by a friend,\n  which is in her own handwriting, and which you carried away.--\n  Believe me, etc.,\n\n  \"GRIFFITH.\"\n\nMy dear, Griffith has gone out; she has gone to the Rue Hillerin-Bertin;\nshe had handed in this little love-letter for my slave, who returned to\nme in an envelope my sweet portrait, stained with tears. He has obeyed.\nOh! my sweet, it must have been dear to him! Another man would have\nrefused to send it in a letter full of flattery; but the Saracen has\nfulfilled his promises. He has obeyed. It moves me to tears.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. THE SAME TO THE SAME April 2nd.\n\nYesterday the weather was splendid. I dressed myself like a girl who\nwants to look her best in her sweetheart's eyes. My father, yielding\nto my entreaties, has given me the prettiest turnout in Paris--two\ndapple-gray horses and a barouche, which is a masterpiece of elegance.\nI was making a first trial of this, and peeped out like a flower from\nunder my sunshade lined with white silk.\n\nAs I drove up the avenue of the Champs-Elysees, I saw my Abencerrage\napproaching on an extraordinarily beautiful horse. Almost every man\nnowadays is a finished jockey, and they all stopped to admire and\ninspect it. He bowed to me, and on receiving a friendly sign of\nencouragement, slackened his horse's pace so that I was able to say to\nhim:\n\n\"You are not vexed with me for asking for my letter; it was no use to\nyou.\" Then in a lower voice, \"You have already transcended the ideal.\n... Your horse makes you an object of general interest,\" I went on\naloud.\n\n\"My steward in Sardinia sent it to me. He is very proud of it; for this\nhorse, which is of Arab blood, was born in my stables.\"\n\nThis morning, my dear, Henarez was on an English sorrel, also very fine,\nbut not such as to attract attention. My light, mocking words had done\ntheir work. He bowed to me and I replied with a slight inclination of\nthe head.\n\nThe Duc d'Angouleme has bought Macumer's horse. My slave understood that\nhe was deserting the role of simplicity by attracting the notice of the\ncrowd. A man ought to be remarked for what he is, not for his horse, or\nanything else belonging to him. To have too beautiful a horse seems to\nme a piece of bad taste, just as much as wearing a huge diamond pin. I\nwas delighted at being able to find fault with him. Perhaps there may\nhave been a touch of vanity in what he did, very excusable in a poor\nexile, and I like to see this childishness.\n\nOh! my dear old preacher, do my love affairs amuse you as much as\nyour dismal philosophy gives me the creeps? Dear Philip the Second in\npetticoats, are you comfortable in my barouche? Do you see those velvet\neyes, humble, yet so eloquent, and glorying in their servitude, which\nflash on me as some one goes by? He is a hero, Renee, and he wears my\nlivery, and always a red camellia in his buttonhole, while I have always\na white one in my hand.\n\nHow clear everything becomes in the light of love! How well I know my\nParis now! It is all transfused with meaning. And love here is lovelier,\ngrander, more bewitching than elsewhere.\n\nI am convinced now that I could never flirt with a fool or make any\nimpression on him. It is only men of real distinction who can enter into\nour feelings and feel our influence. Oh! my poor friend, forgive me. I\nforgot our l'Estorade. But didn't you tell me you were going to make a\ngenius of him? I know what that means. You will dry nurse him till some\nday he is able to understand you.\n\nGood-bye. I am a little off my head, and must stop.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU April.\n\nMy angel--or ought I not rather to say my imp of evil?--you have,\nwithout meaning it, grieved me sorely. I would say wounded were we not\none soul. And yet it is possible to wound oneself.\n\nHow plain it is that you have never realized the force of the word\n_indissoluble_ as applied to the contract binding man and woman! I\nhave no wish to controvert what has been laid down by philosophers or\nlegislators--they are quite capable of doing this for themselves--but,\ndear one, in making marriage irrevocable and imposing on it a relentless\nformula, which admits of no exceptions, they have rendered each union\na thing as distinct as one individual is from another. Each has its\nown inner laws which differ from those of others. The laws regulating\nmarried life in the country, for instance, cannot be the same as those\nregulating a household in town, where frequent distractions give variety\nto life. Or conversely, married life in Paris, where existence is one\nperpetual whirl, must demand different treatment from the more peaceful\nhome in the provinces.\n\nBut if place alters the conditions of marriage, much more does\ncharacter. The wife of a man born to be a leader need only resign\nherself to his guidance; whereas the wife of a fool, conscious of\nsuperior power, is bound to take the reins in her own hand if she would\navert calamity.\n\nYou speak of vice; and it is possible that, after all, reason and\nreflection produce a result not dissimilar from what we call by that\nname. For what does a woman mean by it but perversion of feeling through\ncalculation? Passion is vicious when it reasons, admirable only when it\nsprings from the heart and spends itself in sublime impulses that set\nat naught all selfish considerations. Sooner or later, dear one, you too\nwill say, \"Yes! dissimulation is the necessary armor of a woman, if by\ndissimulation be meant courage to bear in silence, prudence to foresee\nthe future.\"\n\nEvery married woman learns to her cost the existence of certain social\nlaws, which, in many respects, conflict with the laws of nature.\nMarrying at our age, it would be possible to have a dozen children. What\nis this but another name for a dozen crimes, a dozen misfortunes? It\nwould be handing over to poverty and despair twelve innocent darlings;\nwhereas two children would mean the happiness of both, a double\nblessing, two lives capable of developing in harmony with the customs\nand laws of our time. The natural law and the code are in hostility,\nand we are the battle ground. Would you give the name of vice to the\nprudence of the wife who guards her family from destruction through its\nown acts? One calculation or a thousand, what matter, if the decision no\nlonger rests with the heart?\n\nAnd of this terrible calculation you will be guilty some day, my noble\nBaronne de Macumer, when you are the proud and happy wife of the man who\nadores you; or rather, being a man of sense, he will spare you by making\nit himself. (You see, dear dreamer, that I have studied the code in its\nbearings on conjugal relations.) And when at last that day comes, you\nwill understand that we are answerable only to God and to ourselves for\nthe means we employ to keep happiness alight in the heart of our homes.\nFar better is the calculation which succeeds in this than the reckless\npassion which introduces trouble, heart-burnings, and dissension.\n\nI have reflected painfully on the duties of a wife and mother of a\nfamily. Yes, sweet one, it is only by a sublime hypocrisy that we can\nattain the noblest ideal of a perfect woman. You tax me with insincerity\nbecause I dole out to Louis, from day to day, the measure of his\nintimacy with me; but is it not too close an intimacy which provokes\nrupture? My aim is to give him, in the very interest of his happiness,\nmany occupations, which will all serve as distractions to his love; and\nthis is not the reasoning of passion. If affection be inexhaustible,\nit is not so with love: the task, therefore, of a woman--truly no light\none--is to spread it out thriftily over a lifetime.\n\nAt the risk of exciting your disgust, I must tell you that I persist in\nthe principles I have adopted, and hold myself both heroic and generous\nin so doing. Virtue, my pet, is an abstract idea, varying in\nits manifestations with the surroundings. Virtue in Provence, in\nConstantinople, in London, and in Paris bears very different fruit, but\nis none the less virtue. Each human life is a substance compacted of\nwidely dissimilar elements, though, viewed from a certain height, the\ngeneral effect is the same.\n\nIf I wished to make Louis unhappy and to bring about a separation, all\nI need do is to leave the helm in his hands. I have not had your good\nfortune in meeting with a man of the highest distinction, but I may\nperhaps have the satisfaction of helping him on the road to it. Five\nyears hence let us meet in Paris and see! I believe we shall succeed\nin mystifying you. You will tell me then that I was quite mistaken, and\nthat M. de l'Estorade is a man of great natural gifts.\n\nAs for this brave love, of which I know only what you tell me, these\ntremors and night watches by starlight on the balcony, this idolatrous\nworship, this deification of woman--I knew it was not for me. You can\nenlarge the borders of your brilliant life as you please; mine is hemmed\nin to the boundaries of La Crampade.\n\nAnd you reproach me for the jealous care which alone can nurse this\nmodest and fragile shoot into a wealth of lasting and mysterious\nhappiness! I believed myself to have found out how to adapt the charm of\na mistress to the position of a wife, and you have almost made me blush\nfor my device. Who shall say which of us is right, which is wrong?\nPerhaps we are both right and both wrong. Perhaps this is the heavy\nprice which society exacts for our furbelows, our titles, and our\nchildren.\n\nI too have my red camellias, but they bloom on my lips in smiles for my\ndouble charge--the father and the son--whose slave and mistress I am.\nBut, my dear, your last letters made me feel what I have lost! You have\ntaught me all a woman sacrifices in marrying. One single glance did\nI take at those beautiful wild plateaus where you range at your sweet\nwill, and I will not tell you the tears that fell as I read. But regret\nis not remorse, though it may be first cousin to it.\n\nYou say, \"Marriage has made you a philosopher!\" Alas! bitterly did I\nfeel how far this was from the truth, as I wept to think of you swept\naway on love's torrent. But my father has made me read one of the\nprofoundest thinkers of these parts, the man on whom the mantle of\nBoussuet has fallen, one of those hard-headed theorists whose words\nforce conviction. While you were reading _Corinne_, I conned Bonald; and\nhere is the whole secret of my philosophy. He revealed to me the Family\nin its strength and holiness. According to Bonald, your father was right\nin his homily.\n\nFarewell, my dear fancy, my friend, my wild other self.\n\n\n\n\nXIX. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE\n\nWell, my Renee, you are a love of a woman, and I quite agree now that we\ncan only be virtuous by cheating. Will that satisfy you? Moreover, the\nman who loves us is our property; we can make a fool or a genius of him\nas we please; only, between ourselves, the former happens more commonly.\nYou will make yours a genius, and you won't tell the secret--there are\ntwo heroic actions, if you will!\n\nAh! if there were no future life, how nicely you would be sold, for this\nis martyrdom into which you are plunging of your own accord. You want to\nmake him ambitious and to keep him in love! Child that you are, surely\nthe last alone is sufficient.\n\nTell me, to what point is calculation a virtue, or virtue calculation?\nYou won't say? Well, we won't quarrel over that, since we have Bonald to\nrefer to. We are, and intend to remain, virtuous; nevertheless at this\nmoment I believe that you, with all your pretty little knavery, are a\nbetter woman than I am.\n\nYes, I am shockingly deceitful. I love Felipe, and I conceal it from him\nwith an odious hypocrisy. I long to see him leap from his tree to the\ntop of the wall, and from the wall to my balcony--and if he did, how I\nshould wither him with my scorn! You see, I am frank enough with you.\n\nWhat restrains me? Where is the mysterious power which prevents me from\ntelling Felipe, dear fellow, how supremely happy he has made me by\nthe outpouring of his love--so pure, so absolute, so boundless, so\nunobtrusive, and so overflowing?\n\nMme. de Mirbel is painting my portrait, and I intend to give it to him,\nmy dear. What surprises me more and more every day is the animation\nwhich love puts into life. How full of interest is every hour, every\naction, every trifle! and what amazing confusion between the past, the\nfuture, and the present! One lives in three tenses at once. Is it still\nso after the heights of happiness are reached? Oh! tell me, I implore\nyou, what is happiness? Does it soothe, or does it excite? I am horribly\nrestless; I seem to have lost all my bearings; a force in my heart drags\nme to him, spite of reason and spite of propriety. There is this gain,\nthat I am better able to enter into your feelings.\n\nFelipe's happiness consists in feeling himself mine; the aloofness of\nhis love, his strict obedience, irritate me, just as his attitude of\nprofound respect provoked me when he was only my Spanish master. I am\ntempted to cry out to him as he passes, \"Fool, if you love me so much as\na picture, what will it be when you know the real me?\"\n\nOh! Renee, you burn my letters, don't you? I will burn yours. If other\neyes than ours were to read these thoughts which pass from heart to\nheart, I should send Felipe to put them out, and perhaps to kill the\nowners, by way of additional security.\n\nMonday.\n\nOh! Renee, how is it possible to fathom the heart of man? My father\nought to introduce me to M. Bonald, since he is so learned; I would ask\nhim. I envy the privilege of God, who can read the undercurrents of the\nheart.\n\nDoes he still worship? That is the whole question.\n\nIf ever, in gesture, glance, or tone, I were to detect the slightest\nfalling off in the respect he used to show me in the days when he was\nmy instructor in Spanish, I feel that I should have strength to put the\nwhole thing from me. \"Why these fine words, these grand resolutions?\"\nyou will say. Dear, I will tell you.\n\nMy fascinating father, who treats me with the devotion of an Italian\n_cavaliere servente_ for his lady, had my portrait painted, as I told\nyou, by Mme. de Mirbel. I contrived to get a copy made, good enough\nto do for the Duke, and sent the original to Felipe. I despatched it\nyesterday, and these lines with it:\n\n  \"Don Felipe, your single-hearted devotion is met by a blind\n  confidence. Time will show whether this is not to treat a man as\n  more than human.\"\n\nIt was a big reward. It looked like a promise and--dreadful to say--a\nchallenge; but--which will seem to you still more dreadful--I quite\nintended that it should suggest both these things, without going so far\nas actually to commit me. If in his reply there is \"Dear Louise!\" or\neven \"Louise,\" he is done for!\n\nTuesday.\n\nNo, he is not done for. The constitutional minister is perfect as a\nlover. Here is his letter:--\n\n  \"Every moment passed away from your sight has been filled by me\n  with ideal pictures of you, my eyes closed to the outside world\n  and fixed in meditation on your image, which used to obey the\n  summons too slowly in that dim palace of dreams, glorified by your\n  presence. Henceforth my gaze will rest upon this wondrous ivory--\n  this talisman, might I not say?--since your blue eyes sparkle with\n  life as I look, and paint passes into flesh and blood. If I have\n  delayed writing, it is because I could not tear myself away from\n  your presence, which wrung from me all that I was bound to keep\n  most secret.\n\n  \"Yes, closeted with you all last night and to-day, I have, for the\n  first time in my life, given myself up to full, complete, and\n  boundless happiness. Could you but see yourself where I have\n  placed you, between the Virgin and God, you might have some idea\n  of the agony in which the night has passed. But I would not offend\n  you by speaking of it; for one glance from your eyes, robbed of\n  the tender sweetness which is my life, would be full of torture\n  for me, and I implore your clemency therefore in advance. Queen of\n  my life and of my soul, oh! that you could grant me but one-\n  thousandth part of the love I bear you!\n\n  \"This was the burden of my prayer; doubt worked havoc in my soul\n  as I oscillated between belief and despair, between life and\n  death, darkness and light. A criminal whose verdict hangs in the\n  balance is not more racked with suspense than I, as I own to my\n  temerity. The smile imaged on your lips, to which my eyes turned\n  ever and again, and alone able to calm the storm roused by the\n  dread of displeasing you. From my birth no one, not even my\n  mother, has smiled on me. The beautiful young girl who was\n  designed for me rejected my heart and gave hers to my brother.\n  Again, in politics all my efforts have been defeated. In the eyes\n  of my king I have read only thirst for vengeance; from childhood\n  he has been my enemy, and the vote of the Cortes which placed me\n  in power was regarded by him as a personal insult.\n\n  \"Less than this might breed despondency in the stoutest heart.\n  Besides, I have no illusion; I know the gracelessness of my\n  person, and am well aware how difficult it is to do justice to the\n  heart within so rugged a shell. To be loved had ceased to be more\n  than a dream to me when I met you. Thus when I bound myself to\n  your service I knew that devotion alone could excuse my passion.\n\n  \"But, as I look upon this portrait and listen to your smile that\n  whispers of rapture, the rays of a hope which I had sternly\n  banished pierced the gloom, like the light of dawn, again to be\n  obscured by rising mists of doubt and fear of your displeasure, if\n  the morning should break to day. No, it is impossible you should\n  love me yet--I feel it; but in time, as you make proof of the\n  strength, the constancy, and depth of my affection, you may yield\n  me some foothold in your heart. If my daring offends you, tell me\n  so without anger, and I will return to my former part. But if you\n  consent to try and love me, be merciful and break it gently to one\n  who has placed the happiness of his life in the single thought of\n  serving you.\"\n\nMy dear, as I read these last words, he seemed to rise before me,\npale as the night when the camellias told their story and he knew his\noffering was accepted. These words, in their humility, were clearly\nsomething quite different from the usual flowery rhetoric of lovers, and\na wave of feeling broke over me; it was the breath of happiness.\n\nThe weather has been atrocious; impossible to go to the Bois without\nexciting all sorts of suspicions. Even my mother, who often goes out,\nregardless of rain, remains at home, and alone.\n\nWednesday evening.\n\nI have just seen _him_ at the Opera, my dear; he is another man. He came\nto our box, introduced by the Sardinian ambassador.\n\nHaving read in my eyes that this audacity was taken in good part, he\nseemed awkwardly conscious of his limbs, and addressed the Marquise\nd'Espard as \"mademoiselle.\" A light far brighter than the glare of the\nchandeliers flashed from his eyes. At last he went out with the air of a\nman who didn't know what he might do next.\n\n\"The Baron de Macumer is in love!\" exclaimed Mme. de Maufrigneuse.\n\n\"Strange, isn't it, for a fallen minister?\" replied my mother.\n\nI had sufficient presence of mind myself to regard with curiosity Mmes.\nde Maufrigneuse and d'Espard and my mother, as though they were talking\na foreign language and I wanted to know what it was all about, but\ninwardly my soul sank in the waves of an intoxicating joy. There is\nonly one word to express what I felt, and that is: rapture. Such love\nas Felipe's surely makes him worthy of mine. I am the very breath of\nhis life, my hands hold the thread that guides his thoughts. To be quite\nfrank, I have a mad longing to see him clear every obstacle and stand\nbefore me, asking boldly for my hand. Then I should know whether this\nstorm of love would sink to placid calm at a glance from me.\n\nAh! my dear, I stopped here, and I am still all in a tremble. As I\nwrote, I heard a slight noise outside, and rose to see what it was. From\nmy window I could see him coming along the ridge of the wall at the risk\nof his life. I went to the bedroom window and made him a sign, it was\nenough; he leaped from the wall--ten feet--and then ran along the road,\nas far as I could see him, in order to show me that he was not hurt.\nThat he should think of my fear at the moment when he must have been\nstunned by his fall, moved me so much that I am still crying; I don't\nknow why. Poor ungainly man! what was he coming for? what had he to say\nto me?\n\nI dare not write my thoughts, and shall go to bed joyful, thinking of\nall that we would say if we were together. Farewell, fair silent one. I\nhave not time to scold you for not writing, but it is more than a month\nsince I have heard from you! Does this mean that you are at last happy?\nHave you lost the \"complete independence\" which you were so proud of,\nand which to-night has so nearly played me false?\n\n\n\n\nXX. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU May.\n\nIf love be the life of the world, why do austere philosophers count it\nfor nothing in marriage? Why should Society take for its first law that\nthe woman must be sacrificed to the family, introducing thus a note of\ndiscord into the very heart of marriage? And this discord was foreseen,\nsince it was to meet the dangers arising from it that men were armed\nwith new-found powers against us. But for these, we should have been\nable to bring their whole theory to nothing, whether by the force of\nlove or of a secret, persistent aversion.\n\nI see in marriage, as it at present exists, two opposing forces which\nit was the task of the lawgiver to reconcile. \"When will they be\nreconciled?\" I said to myself, as I read your letter. Oh! my dear, one\nsuch letter alone is enough to overthrow the whole fabric constructed by\nthe sage of Aveyron, under whose shelter I had so cheerfully ensconced\nmyself! The laws were made by old men--any woman can see that--and\nthey have been prudent enough to decree that conjugal love, apart from\npassion, is not degrading, and that a woman in yielding herself may\ndispense with the sanction of love, provided the man can legally call\nher his. In their exclusive concern for the family they have imitated\nNature, whose one care is to propagate the species.\n\nFormerly I was a person, now I am a chattel. Not a few tears have I\ngulped down, alone and far from every one. How gladly would I have\nexchanged them for a consoling smile! Why are our destinies so unequal?\nYour soul expands in the atmosphere of a lawful passion. For you, virtue\nwill coincide with pleasure. If you encounter pain, it will be of your\nown free choice. Your duty, if you marry Felipe, will be one with the\nsweetest, freest indulgence of feeling. Our future is big with the\nanswer to my question, and I look for it with restless eagerness.\n\nYou love and are adored. Oh! my dear, let this noble romance, the\nold subject of our dreams, take full possession of your soul. Womanly\nbeauty, refined and spiritualized in you, was created by God, for His\nown purposes, to charm and to delight. Yes, my sweet, guard well the\nsecret of your heart, and submit Felipe to those ingenious devices of\nours for testing a lover's metal. Above all, make trial of your own\nlove, for this is even more important. It is so easy to be misled by\nthe deceptive glamour of novelty and passion, and by the vision of\nhappiness.\n\nAlone of the two friends, you remain in your maiden independence; and\nI beseech you, dearest, do not risk the irrevocable step of marriage\nwithout some guarantee. It happens sometimes, when two are talking\ntogether, apart from the world, their souls stripped of social disguise,\nthat a gesture, a word, a look lights up, as by a flash, some dark\nabyss. You have courage and strength to tread boldly in paths where\nothers would be lost.\n\nYou have no conception in what anxiety I watch you. Across all this\nspace I see you; my heart beats with yours. Be sure, therefore, to write\nand tell me everything. Your letters create an inner life of passion\nwithin my homely, peaceful household, which reminds me of a level\nhighroad on a gray day. The only event here, my sweet, is that I am\nplaying cross-purposes with myself. But I don't want to tell you about\nit just now; it must wait for another day. With dogged obstinacy, I pass\nfrom despair to hope, now yielding, now holding back. It may be that\nI ask from life more than we have a right to claim. In youth we are so\nready to believe that the ideal and the real will harmonize!\n\nI have been pondering alone, seated beneath a rock in my park, and the\nfruit of my pondering is that love in marriage is a happy accident on\nwhich it is impossible to base a universal law. My Aveyron philosopher\nis right in looking on the family as the only possible unit in society,\nand in placing woman in subjection to the family, as she has been in all\nages. The solution of this great--for us almost awful--question lies in\nour first child. For this reason, I would gladly be a mother, were it\nonly to supply food for the consuming energy of my soul.\n\nLouis' temper remains as perfect as ever; his love is of the active, my\ntenderness of the passive, type. He is happy, plucking the flowers which\nbloom for him, without troubling about the labor of the earth which has\nproduced them. Blessed self-absorption! At whatever cost to myself, I\nfall in with his illusions, as a mother, in my idea of her, should be\nready to spend herself to satisfy a fancy of her child. The intensity of\nhis joy blinds him, and even throws its reflection upon me. The smile\nor look of satisfaction which the knowledge of his content brings to my\nface is enough to satisfy him. And so, \"my child\" is the pet name which\nI give him when we are alone.\n\nAnd I wait for the fruit of all these sacrifices which remain a secret\nbetween God, myself, and you. On motherhood I have staked enormously;\nmy credit account is now too large, I fear I shall never receive full\npayment. To it I look for employment of my energy, expansion of my\nheart, and the compensation of a world of joys. Pray Heaven I be not\ndeceived! It is a question of all my future and, horrible thought, of my\nvirtue.\n\n\n\n\nXXI. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE June.\n\nDear wedded sweetheart,--Your letter has arrived at the very moment to\nhearten me for a bold step which I have been meditating night and day.\nI feel within me a strange craving for the unknown, or, if you will, the\nforbidden, which makes me uneasy and reveals a conflict in progress in\nmy soul between the laws of society and of nature. I cannot tell whether\nnature in me is the stronger of the two, but I surprise myself in the\nact of meditating between the hostile powers.\n\nIn plain words, what I wanted was to speak with Felipe, alone, at night,\nunder the lime-trees at the bottom of our garden. There is no denying\nthat this desire beseems the girl who has earned the epithet of an\n\"up-to-date young lady,\" bestowed on me by the Duchess in jest, and\nwhich my father has approved.\n\nYet to me there seems a method in this madness. I should recompense\nFelipe for the long nights he has passed under my window, at the same\ntime that I should test him, by seeing what he thinks of my escapade and\nhow he comports himself at a critical moment. Let him cast a halo round\nmy folly--behold in him my husband; let him show one iota\nless of the tremulous respect with which he bows to me in the\nChamps-Elysees--farewell, Don Felipe.\n\nAs for society, I run less risk in meeting my lover thus than when I\nsmile to him in the drawing-rooms of Mme. de Maufrigneuse and the old\nMarquise de Beauseant, where spies now surround us on every side; and\nHeaven only knows how people stare at the girl, suspected of a weakness\nfor a grotesque, like Macumer.\n\nI cannot tell you to what a state of agitation I am reduced by dreaming\nof this idea, and the time I have given to planning its execution. I\nwanted you badly. What happy hours we should have chattered away, lost\nin the mazes of uncertainty, enjoying in anticipation all the delights\nand horrors of a first meeting in the silence of night, under the noble\nlime-trees of the Chaulieu mansion, with the moonlight dancing through\nthe leaves! As I sat alone, every nerve tingling, I cried, \"Oh! Renee,\nwhere are you?\" Then your letter came, like a match to gunpowder, and my\nlast scruples went by the board.\n\nThrough the window I tossed to my bewildered adorer an exact tracing of\nthe key of the little gate at the end of the garden, together with this\nnote:\n\n  \"Your madness must really be put a stop to. If you broke your\n  neck, you would ruin the reputation of the woman you profess to\n  love. Are you worthy of a new proof of regard, and do you deserve\n  that I should talk with you under the limes at the foot of the\n  garden at the hour when the moon throws them into shadow?\"\n\nYesterday at one o'clock, when Griffith was going to bed, I said to her:\n\n\"Take your shawl, dear, and come out with me. I want to go to the bottom\nof the garden without anyone knowing.\"\n\nWithout a word, she followed me. Oh! my Renee, what an awful moment\nwhen, after a little pause full of delicious thrills of agony, I saw him\ngliding along like a shadow. When he had reached the garden safely, I\nsaid to Griffith:\n\n\"Don't be astonished, but the Baron de Macumer is here, and, indeed, it\nis on that account I brought you with me.\"\n\nNo reply from Griffith.\n\n\"What would you have with me?\" said Felipe, in a tone of such agitation\nthat it was easy to see he was driven beside himself by the noise,\nslight as it was, of our dresses in the silence of the night and of our\nsteps upon the gravel.\n\n\"I want to say to you what I could not write,\" I replied.\n\nGriffith withdrew a few steps. It was one of those mild nights, when\nthe air is heavy with the scent of flowers. My head swam with the\nintoxicating delight of finding myself all but alone with him in the\nfriendly shade of the lime-trees, beyond which lay the garden, shining\nall the more brightly because the white facade of the house reflected\nthe moonlight. The contrast seemed, as it were, an emblem of our\nclandestine love leading up to the glaring publicity of a wedding.\nNeither of us could do more at first than drink in silently the ecstasy\nof a moment, as new and marvelous for him as for me. At last I found\ntongue to say, pointing to the elm-tree:\n\n\"Although I am not afraid of scandal, you shall not climb that tree\nagain. We have long enough played schoolboy and schoolgirl, let us rise\nnow to the height of our destiny. Had that fall killed you, I should\nhave died disgraced...\"\n\nI looked at him. Every scrap of color had left his face.\n\n\"And if you had been found there, suspicion would have attached either\nto my mother or to me...\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he murmured.\n\n\"If you walk along the boulevard, I shall hear your step; and when I\nwant to see you, I will open my window. But I would not run such a risk\nunless some emergency arose. Why have you forced me by your rash act to\ncommit another, and one which may lower me in your eyes?\"\n\nThe tears which I saw in his eyes were to me the most eloquent of\nanswers.\n\n\"What I have done to-night,\" I went on with a smile, \"must seem to you\nthe height of madness...\"\n\nAfter we had walked up and down in silence more than once, he recovered\ncomposure enough to say:\n\n\"You must think me a fool; and, indeed, the delirium of my joy has\nrobbed me of both nerve and wits. But of this at least be assured,\nwhatever you do is sacred in my eyes from the very fact that it seemed\nright to you. I honor you as I honor only God besides. And then, Miss\nGriffith is here.\"\n\n\"She is here for the sake of the others, not for us,\" I put in hastily.\n\nMy dear, he understood me at once.\n\n\"I know very well,\" he said, with the humblest glance at me, \"that\nwhether she is there or not makes no difference. Unseen of men, we are\nstill in the presence of God, and our own esteem is not less important\nto us than that of the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Felipe,\" I said, holding out my hand to him with a gesture\nwhich you ought to see. \"A woman, and I am nothing, if not a woman,\nis on the road to loving the man who understands her. Oh! only on the\nroad,\" I went on, with a finger on my lips. \"Don't let your hopes carry\nyou beyond what I say. My heart will belong only to the man who can\nread it and know its every turn. Our views, without being absolutely\nidentical, must be the same in their breadth and elevation. I have no\nwish to exaggerate my own merits; doubtless what seem virtues in my\neyes have their corresponding defects. All I can say is, I should be\nheartbroken without them.\"\n\n\"Having first accepted me as your servant, you now permit me to love\nyou,\" he said, trembling and looking in my face at each word. \"My first\nprayer has been more than answered.\"\n\n\"But,\" I hastened to reply, \"your position seems to me a better one than\nmine. I should not object to change places, and this change it lies with\nyou to bring about.\"\n\n\"In my turn, I thank you,\" he replied. \"I know the duties of a faithful\nlover. It is mine to prove that I am worthy of you; the trials shall\nbe as long as you choose to make them. If I belie your hopes, you have\nonly--God! that I should say it--to reject me.\"\n\n\"I know that you love me,\" I replied. \"_So far_,\" with a cruel emphasis\non the words, \"you stand first in my regard. Otherwise you would not be\nhere.\"\n\nThen we began to walk up and down as we talked, and I must say that\nso soon as my Spaniard had recovered himself he put forth the genuine\neloquence of the heart. It was not passion it breathed, but a marvelous\ntenderness of feeling which he beautifully compared to the divine\nlove. His thrilling voice, which lent an added charm to thoughts, in\nthemselves so exquisite, reminded me of the nightingale's note. He spoke\nlow, using only the middle tones of a fine instrument, and words flowed\nupon words with the rush of a torrent. It was the overflow of the heart.\n\n\"No more,\" I said, \"or I shall not be able to tear myself away.\"\n\nAnd with a gesture I dismissed him.\n\n\"You have committed yourself now, mademoiselle,\" said Griffith.\n\n\"In England that might be so, but not in France,\" I replied with\nnonchalance. \"I intend to make a love match, and am feeling my way--that\nis all.\"\n\nYou see, dear, as love did not come to me, I had to do as Mahomet did\nwith the mountain.\n\nFriday.\n\nOnce more I have seen my slave. He has become very timid, and puts on an\nair of pious devotion, which I like, for it seems to say that he feels\nmy power and fascination in every fibre. But nothing in his look or\nmanner can rouse in these society sibyls any suspicion of the boundless\nlove which I see. Don't suppose though, dear, that I am carried away,\nmastered, tamed; on the contrary, the taming, mastering, and carrying\naway are on my side...\n\nIn short, I am quite capable of reason. Oh! to feel again the terror of\nthat fascination in which I was held by the schoolmaster, the plebeian,\nthe man I kept at a distance!\n\nThe fact is that love is of two kinds--one which commands, and one which\nobeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one\ngives rise is not the passion of the other. To get her full of life,\nperhaps a woman ought to have experience of both. Can the two passions\never co-exist? Can the man in whom we inspire love inspire it in us?\nWill the day ever come when Felipe is my master? Shall I tremble then,\nas he does now? These are questions which make me shudder.\n\nHe is very blind! In his place I should have thought Mlle. de Chaulieu,\nmeeting me under the limes, a cold, calculating coquette, with starched\nmanners. No, that is not love, it is playing with fire. I am still fond\nof Felipe, but I am calm and at my ease with him now. No more obstacles!\nWhat a terrible thought! It is all ebb-tide within, and I fear to\nquestion my heart. His mistake was in concealing the ardor of his love;\nhe ought to have forced my self-control.\n\nIn a word, I was naughty, and I have not got the reward such naughtiness\nbrings. No, dear, however sweet the memory of that half-hour beneath\nthe trees, it is nothing like the excitement of the old time with its:\n\"Shall I go? Shall I not go? Shall I write to him? Shall I not write?\"\n\nIs it thus with all our pleasures? Is suspense always better than\nenjoyment? Hope than fruition? Is it the rich who in very truth are\nthe poor? Have we not both perhaps exaggerated feeling by giving to\nimagination too free a rein? There are times when this thought freezes\nme. Shall I tell you why? Because I am meditating another visit to\nthe bottom of the garden--without Griffith. How far could I go in this\ndirection? Imagination knows no limit, but it is not so with pleasure.\nTell me, dear be-furbelowed professor, how can one reconcile the two\ngoals of a woman's existence?\n\n\n\n\nXXII. LOUISE TO FELIPE\n\nI am not pleased with you. If you did not cry over Racine's _Berenice_,\nand feel it to be the most terrible of tragedies, there is no kinship in\nour souls; we shall never get on together, and had better break off\nat once. Let us meet no more. Forget me; for if I do not have a\nsatisfactory reply, I shall forget you. You will become M. le Baron de\nMacumer for me, or rather you will cease to be at all.\n\nYesterday at Mme. d'Espard's you had a self-satisfied air which\ndisgusted me. No doubt, apparently, about your conquest! In sober\nearnest, your self-possession alarms me. Not a trace in you of\nthe humble slave of your first letter. Far from betraying the\nabsent-mindedness of a lover, you polished epigrams! This is not the\nattitude of a true believer, always prostrate before his divinity.\n\nIf you do not feel me to be the very breath of your life, a being nobler\nthan other women, and to be judged by other standards, then I must\nbe less than a woman in your sight. You have roused in me a spirit of\nmistrust, Felipe, and its angry mutterings have drowned the accents of\ntenderness. When I look back upon what has passed between us, I feel in\ntruth that I have a right to be suspicious. For know, Prime Minister of\nall the Spains, that I have reflected much on the defenceless condition\nof our sex. My innocence has held a torch, and my fingers are not burnt.\nLet me repeat to you, then, what my youthful experience taught me.\n\nIn all other matters, duplicity, faithlessness, and broken pledges are\nbrought to book and punished; but not so with love, which is at once the\nvictim, the accuser, the counsel, judge, and executioner. The cruelest\ntreachery, the most heartless crimes, are those which remain for ever\nconcealed, with two hearts alone for witness. How indeed should the\nvictim proclaim them without injury to herself? Love, therefore, has its\nown code, its own penal system, with which the world has no concern.\n\nNow, for my part, I have resolved never to pardon a serious misdemeanor,\nand in love, pray, what is not serious? Yesterday you had all the air of\na man successful in his suit. You would be wrong to doubt it; and yet,\nif this assurance robbed you of the charming simplicity which sprang\nfrom uncertainty, I should blame you severely. I would have you neither\nbashful nor self-complacent; I would not have you in terror of losing\nmy affection--that would be an insult--but neither would I have you wear\nyour love lightly as a thing of course. Never should your heart be freer\nthan mine. If you know nothing of the torture that a single stab of\ndoubt brings to the soul, tremble lest I give you a lesson!\n\nIn a single glance I confided my heart to you, and you read the meaning.\nThe purest feelings that ever took root in a young girl's breast are\nyours. The thought and meditation of which I have told you served only\nto enrich the mind; but if ever the wounded heart turns to the brain for\ncounsel, be sure the young girl would show some kinship with the demon\nof knowledge and of daring.\n\nI swear to you, Felipe, if you love me, as I believe you do and if I\nhave reason to suspect the least falling off in the fear, obedience, and\nrespect which you have hitherto professed, if the pure flame of passion\nwhich first kindled the fire of my heart should seem to me any day to\nburn less vividly, you need fear no reproaches. I would not weary you\nwith letters bearing any trace of weakness, pride, or anger, nor even\nwith one of warning like this. But if I spoke no words, Felipe, my face\nwould tell you that death was near. And yet I should not die till I\nhad branded you with infamy, and sown eternal sorrow in your heart; you\nwould see the girl you loved dishonored and lost in this world, and know\nher doomed to everlasting suffering in the next.\n\nDo not therefore, I implore you, give me cause to envy the old, happy\nLouise, the object of your pure worship, whose heart expanded in the\nsunshine of happiness, since, in the words of Dante, she possessed,\n\n  Senza brama, sicura ricchezza!\n\nI have searched the _Inferno_ through to find the most terrible\npunishment, some torture of the mind to which I might link the vengeance\nof God.\n\nYesterday, as I watched you, doubt went through me like a sharp, cold\ndagger's point. Do you know what that means? I mistrusted you, and the\npang was so terrible, I could not endure it longer. If my service be\ntoo hard, leave it, I would not keep you. Do I need any proof of your\ncleverness? Keep for me the flowers of your wit. Show to others no fine\nsurface to call forth flattery, compliments, or praise. Come to me,\nladen with hatred or scorn, the butt of calumny, come to me with the\nnews that women flout you and ignore you, and not one loves you; then,\nah! then you will know the treasures of Louise's heart and love.\n\nWe are only rich when our wealth is buried so deep that all the world\nmight trample it under foot, unknowing. If you were handsome, I don't\nsuppose I should have looked at you twice, or discovered one of the\nthousand reasons out of which my love sprang. True, we know no more of\nthese reasons than we know why it is the sun makes the flowers to bloom,\nand ripens the fruit. Yet I could tell you of one reason very dear to\nme.\n\nThe character, expression, and individuality that ennoble your face are\na sealed book to all but me. Mine is the power which transforms you into\nthe most lovable of men, and that is why I would keep your mental gifts\nalso for myself. To others they should be as meaningless as your eyes,\nthe charm of your mouth and features. Let it be mine alone to kindle the\nbeacon of your intelligence, as I bring the lovelight into your eyes.\nI would have you the Spanish grandee of old days, cold, ungracious,\nhaughty, a monument to be gazed at from afar, like the ruins of some\nbarbaric power, which no one ventures to explore. Now, you have nothing\nbetter to do than to open up pleasant promenades for the public, and\nshow yourself of a Parisian affability!\n\nIs my ideal portrait, then, forgotten? Your excessive cheerfulness was\nredolent of your love. Had it not been for a restraining glance from me,\nyou would have proclaimed to the most sharp-sighted, keen-witted,\nand unsparing of Paris salons, that your inspiration was drawn from\nArmande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu.\n\nI believe in your greatness too much to think for a moment that your\nlove is ruled by policy; but if you did not show a childlike simplicity\nwhen with me, I could only pity you. Spite of this first fault, you are\nstill deeply admired by LOUISE DE CHAULIEU.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. FELIPE TO LOUISE\n\nWhen God beholds our faults, He sees also our repentance. Yes, my\nbeloved mistress, you are right. I felt that I had displeased you, but\nknew not how. Now that you have explained the cause of your trouble, I\nfind in it fresh motive to adore you. Like the God of Israel, you are\na jealous deity, and I rejoice to see it. For what is holier and\nmore precious than jealousy? My fair guardian angel, jealousy is an\never-wakeful sentinel; it is to love what pain is to the body, the\nfaithful herald of evil. Be jealous of your servant, Louise, I beg of\nyou; the harder you strike, the more contrite will he be and kiss the\nrod, in all submission, which proves that he is not indifferent to you.\n\nBut, alas! dear, if the pains it cost me to vanquish my timidity and\nmaster feelings you thought so feeble were invisible to you, will\nHeaven, think you, reward them? I assure you, it needed no slight effort\nto show myself to you as I was in the days before I loved. At Madrid I\nwas considered a good talker, and I wanted you to see for yourself the\nfew gifts I may possess. If this were vanity, it has been well punished.\n\nYour last glance utterly unnerved me. Never had I so quailed, even when\nthe army of France was at the gates of Cadiz and I read peril for my\nlife in the dissembling words of my royal master. Vainly I tried to\ndiscover the cause of your displeasure, and the lack of sympathy between\nus which this fact disclosed was terrible to me. For in truth I have no\nwish but to act by your will, think your thoughts, see with your eyes,\nrespond to your joy and suffering, as my body responds to heat and cold.\nThe crime and the anguish lay for me in the breach of unison in that\ncommon life of feeling which you have made so fair.\n\n\"I have vexed her!\" I exclaimed over and over again, like one\ndistraught. My noble, my beautiful Louise, if anything could increase\nthe fervor of my devotion or confirm my belief in your delicate moral\nintuitions, it would be the new light which your words have thrown upon\nmy own feelings. Much in them, of which my mind was formerly but dimly\nconscious, you have now made clear. If this be designed as chastisement,\nwhat can be the sweetness of your rewards?\n\nLouise, for me it was happiness enough to be accepted as your servant.\nYou have given me the life of which I despaired. No longer do I draw a\nuseless breath, I have something to spend myself for; my force has an\noutlet, if only in suffering for you. Once more I say, as I have said\nbefore, that you will never find me other than I was when first I\noffered myself as your lowly bondman. Yes, were you dishonored and lost,\nto use your own words, my heart would only cling the more closely to you\nfor your self-sought misery. It would be my care to staunch your wounds,\nand my prayers should importune God with the story of your innocence and\nyour wrongs.\n\nDid I not tell you that the feelings of my heart for you are not a\nlover's only, that I will be to you father, mother, sister, brother--ay,\na whole family--anything or nothing, as you may decree? And is it not\nyour own wish which has confined within the compass of a lover's feeling\nso many varying forms of devotion? Pardon me, then, if at times the\nfather and brother disappear behind the lover, since you know they are\nnone the less there, though screened from view. Would that you could\nread the feelings of my heart when you appear before me, radiant in your\nbeauty, the centre of admiring eyes, reclining calmly in your carriage\nin the Champs-Elysees, or seated in your box at the Opera! Then would\nyou know how absolutely free from selfish taint is the pride with which\nI hear the praises of your loveliness and grace, praises which warm\nmy heart even to the strangers who utter them! When by chance you have\nraised me to elysium by a friendly greeting, my pride is mingled with\nhumility, and I depart as though God's blessing rested on me. Nor does\nthe joy vanish without leaving a long track of light behind. It breaks\non me through the clouds of my cigarette smoke. More than ever do I feel\nhow every drop of this surging blood throbs for you.\n\nCan you be ignorant how you are loved? After seeing you, I return to\nmy study, and the glitter of its Saracenic ornaments sinks to nothing\nbefore the brightness of your portrait, when I open the spring that\nkeeps it locked up from every eye and lose myself in endless musings or\nlink my happiness to verse. From the heights of heaven I look down\nupon the course of a life such as my hopes dare to picture it! Have you\nnever, in the silence of the night, or through the roar of the town,\nheard the whisper of a voice in your sweet, dainty ear? Does no one of\nthe thousand prayers that I speed to you reach home?\n\nBy dint of silent contemplation of your pictured face, I have succeeded\nin deciphering the expression of every feature and tracing its\nconnection with some grace of the spirit, and then I pen a sonnet to\nyou in Spanish on the harmony of the twofold beauty in which nature\nhas clothed you. These sonnets you will never see, for my poetry is too\nunworthy of its theme, I dare not send it to you. Not a moment passes\nwithout thoughts of you, for my whole being is bound up in you, and if\nyou ceased to be its animating principle, every part would ache.\n\nNow, Louise, can you realize the torture to me of knowing that I had\ndispleased you, while entirely ignorant of the cause? The ideal double\nlife which seemed so fair was cut short. My heart turned to ice within\nme as, hopeless of any other explanation, I concluded that you had\nceased to love me. With heavy heart, and yet not wholly without comfort,\nI was falling back upon my old post as servant; then your letter came\nand turned all to joy. Oh! might I but listen for ever to such chiding!\n\nOnce a child, picking himself up from a tumble, turned to his mother\nwith the words \"Forgive me.\" Hiding his own hurt, he sought pardon for\nthe pain he had caused her. Louise, I was that child, and such as I was\nthen, I am now. Here is the key to my character, which your slave in all\nhumility places in your hands.\n\nBut do not fear, there will be no more stumbling. Keep tight the chain\nwhich binds me to you, so that a touch may communicate your lightest\nwish to him who will ever remain your slave, FELIPE.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE October.\n\nMy dear friend,--How is it possible that you, who brought yourself in\ntwo months to marry a broken-down invalid in order to mother him, should\nknow anything of that terrible shifting drama, enacted in the recesses\nof the heart, which we call love--a drama where death lies in a glance\nor a light reply?\n\nI had reserved for Felipe one last supreme test which was to be\ndecisive. I wanted to know whether his love was the love of a Royalist\nfor his King, who can do no wrong. Why should the loyalty of a Catholic\nbe less supreme?\n\nHe walked with me a whole night under the limes at the bottom of the\ngarden, and not a shadow of suspicion crossed his soul. Next day\nhe loved me better, but the feeling was as reverent, as humble, as\nregretful as ever; he had not presumed an iota. Oh! he is a very\nSpaniard, a very Abencerrage. He scaled my wall to come and kiss the\nhand which in the darkness I reached down to him from my balcony. He\nmight have broken his neck; how many of our young men would do the like?\n\nBut all this is nothing; Christians suffer the horrible pangs of\nmartyrdom in the hope of heaven. The day before yesterday I took aside\nthe royal ambassador-to-be at the court of Spain, my much respected\nfather, and said to him with a smile:\n\n\"Sir, some of your friends will have it that you are marrying your dear\nArmande to the nephew of an ambassador who has been very anxious\nfor this connection, and has long begged for it. Also, that the\nmarriage-contract arranges for his nephew to succeed on his death to his\nenormous fortune and his title, and bestows on the young couple in the\nmeantime an income of a hundred thousand livres, on the bride a dowry\nof eight hundred thousand francs. Your daughter weeps, but bows to the\nunquestioned authority of her honored parent. Some people are unkind\nenough to say that, behind her tears, she conceals a worldly and\nambitious soul.\n\n\"Now, we are going to the gentleman's box at the Opera to-night, and M.\nle Baron de Macumer will visit us there.\"\n\n\"Macumer needs a touch of the spur then,\" said my father, smiling at me,\nas though I were a female ambassador.\n\n\"You mistake Clarissa Harlowe for Figaro!\" I cried, with a glance of\nscorn and mockery. \"When you see me with my right hand ungloved,\nyou will give the lie to this impertinent gossip, and will mark your\ndispleasure at it.\"\n\n\"I may make my mind easy about your future. You have no more got a\ngirl's headpiece than Jeanne d'Arc had a woman's heart. You will be\nhappy, you will love nobody, and will allow yourself to be loved.\"\n\nThis was too much. I burst into laughter.\n\n\"What is it, little flirt?\" he said.\n\n\"I tremble for my country's interests...\"\n\nAnd seeing him look quite blank, I added:\n\n\"At Madrid!\"\n\n\"You have no idea how this little nun has learned, in a year's time, to\nmake fun of her father,\" he said to the Duchess.\n\n\"Armande makes light of everything,\" my mother replied, looking me in\nthe face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, you are not even afraid of rheumatism on these damp nights,\" she\nsaid, with another meaning glance at me.\n\n\"Oh!\" I answered, \"the mornings are so hot!\"\n\nThe Duchess looked down.\n\n\"It's high time she were married,\" said my father, \"and it had better be\nbefore I go.\"\n\n\"If you wish it,\" I replied demurely.\n\nTwo hours later, my mother and I, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme.\nd'Espard, were all four blooming like roses in the front of the box. I\nhad seated myself sideways, giving only a shoulder to the house, so that\nI could see everything, myself unseen, in that spacious box which fills\none of the two angles at the back of the hall, between the columns.\n\nMacumer came, stood up, and put his opera-glasses before his eyes so\nthat he might be able to look at me comfortably.\n\nIn the first interval entered the young man whom I call \"king of the\nprofligates.\" The Comte Henri de Marsay, who has great beauty of an\neffeminate kind, entered the box with an epigram in his eyes, a smile\nupon his lips, and an air of satisfaction over his whole countenance.\nHe first greeted my mother, Mme. d'Espard, and the Duchesse de\nMaufrigneuse, the Comte d'Esgrignon, and M. de Canalis; then turning to\nme, he said:\n\n\"I do not know whether I shall be the first to congratulate you on an\nevent which will make you the object of envy to many.\"\n\n\"Ah! a marriage!\" I cried. \"Is it left for me, a girl fresh from the\nconvent, to tell you that predicted marriages never come off.\"\n\nM. de Marsay bent down, whispering to Macumer, and I was convinced, from\nthe movement of his lips, that what he said was this:\n\n\"Baron, you are perhaps in love with that little coquette, who has used\nyou for her own ends; but as the question is one not of love, but of\nmarriage, it is as well for you to know what is going on.\"\n\nMacumer treated this officious scandal-monger to one of those glances\nof his which seem to me so eloquent of noble scorn, and replied to the\neffect that he was \"not in love with any little coquette.\" His whole\nbearing so delighted me, that directly I caught sight of my father, the\nglove was off.\n\nFelipe had not a shadow of fear or doubt. How well did he bear out my\nexpectations! His faith is only in me, society cannot hurt him with its\nlies. Not a muscle of the Arab's face stirred, not a drop of the blue\nblood flushed his olive cheek.\n\nThe two young counts went out, and I said, laughing, to Macumer:\n\n\"M. de Marsay has been treating you to an epigram on me.\"\n\n\"He did more,\" he replied. \"It was an epithalamium.\"\n\n\"You speak Greek to me,\" I said, rewarding him with a smile and a\ncertain look which always embarrasses him.\n\nMy father meantime was talking to Mme. de Maufrigneuse.\n\n\"I should think so!\" he exclaimed. \"The gossip which gets about is\nscandalous. No sooner has a girl come out than everyone is keen to marry\nher, and the ridiculous stories that are invented! I shall never force\nArmande to marry against her will. I am going to take a turn in the\npromenade, otherwise people will be saying that I allowed the rumor to\nspread in order to suggest the marriage to the ambassador; and Caesar's\ndaughter ought to be above suspicion, even more than his wife--if that\nwere possible.\"\n\nThe Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme. d'Espard shot glances first at\nmy mother, then at the Baron, brimming over with sly intelligence and\nrepressed curiosity. With their serpent's cunning they had at last got\nan inkling of something going on. Of all mysteries in life, love is the\nleast mysterious! It exhales from women, I believe, like a perfume, and\nshe who can conceal it is a very monster! Our eyes prattle even more\nthan our tongues.\n\nHaving enjoyed the delightful sensation of finding Felipe rise to the\noccasion, as I had wished, it was only in nature I should hunger for\nmore. So I made the signal agreed on for telling him that he might come\nto my window by the dangerous road you know of. A few hours later I\nfound him, upright as a statue, glued to the wall, his hand resting on\nthe balcony of my window, studying the reflections of the light in my\nroom.\n\n\"My dear Felipe,\" I said, \"You have acquitted yourself well to-night;\nyou behaved exactly as I should have done had I been told that you were\non the point of marrying.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" he replied, \"that you would hardly have told others before\nme.\"\n\n\"And what right have you to this privilege?\"\n\n\"The right of one who is your devoted slave.\"\n\n\"In very truth?\"\n\n\"I am, and shall ever remain so.\"\n\n\"But suppose this marriage was inevitable; suppose that I had agreed...\"\n\nTwo flashing glances lit up the moonlight--one directed to me, the other\nto the precipice which the wall made for us. He seemed to calculate\nwhether a fall together would mean death; but the thought merely passed\nlike lightning over his face and sparkled in his eyes. A power, stronger\nthan passion, checked the impulse.\n\n\"An Arab cannot take back his word,\" he said in a husky voice. \"I am\nyour slave to do with as you will; my life is not mine to destroy.\"\n\nThe hand on the balcony seemed as though its hold were relaxing. I\nplaced mine on it as I said:\n\n\"Felipe, my beloved, from this moment I am your wife in thought and\nwill. Go in the morning to ask my father for my hand. He wishes to\nretain my fortune; but if you promise to acknowledge receipt of it in\nthe contract, his consent will no doubt be given. I am no longer Armande\nde Chaulieu. Leave me at once; no breath of scandal must touch Louise de\nMacumer.\"\n\nHe listened with blanched face and trembling limbs, then, like a flash,\nhad cleared the ten feet to the ground in safety. It was a moment of\nagony, but he waved his hand to me and disappeared.\n\n\"I am loved then,\" I said to myself, \"as never woman was before.\" And I\nfell asleep in the calm content of a child, my destiny for ever fixed.\n\nAbout two o'clock next day my father summoned me to his private room,\nwhere I found the Duchess and Macumer. There was an interchange of\ncivilities. I replied quite simply that if my father and M. Henarez were\nof one mind, I had no reason to oppose their wishes. Thereupon my mother\ninvited the Baron to dinner; and after dinner, we all four went for\na drive in the Bois de Boulogne, where I had the pleasure of smiling\nironically to M. de Marsay as he passed on horseback and caught sight of\nMacumer sitting opposite to us beside my father.\n\nMy bewitching Felipe has had his cards reprinted as follows:\n\nHENAREZ\n\n(Baron de Macumer, formerly Duc de Soria.)\n\nEvery morning he brings me with his own hands a splendid bouquet, hidden\nin which I never fail to find a letter, containing a Spanish sonnet in\nmy honor, which he has composed during the night.\n\nNot to make this letter inordinately large, I send you as specimens only\nthe first and last of these sonnets, which I have translated for your\nbenefit, word for word, and line for line:--\n\nFIRST SONNET\n\n  Many a time I've stood, clad in thin silken vest,\n  Drawn sword in hand, with steady pulse,\n  Waiting the charge of a raging bull,\n  And the thrust of his horn, sharper-pointed than Phoebe's crescent.\n\n  I've scaled, on my lips the lilt of an Andalusian dance,\n  The steep redoubt under a rain of fire;\n  I've staked my life upon a hazard of the dice\n  Careless, as though it were a gold doubloon.\n\n  My hand would seek the ball out of the cannon's mouth,\n  But now meseems I grow more timid than a crouching hair,\n  Or a child spying some ghost in the curtain's folds.\n\n  For when your sweet eye rests on me,\n  Any icy sweat covers my brow, my knees give way,\n  I tremble, shrink, my courage gone.\n\nSECOND SONNET\n\n  Last night I fain would sleep to dream of thee,\n  But jealous sleep fled my eyelids,\n  I sought the balcony and looked towards heaven,\n  Always my glance flies upward when I think of thee.\n\n  Strange sight! whose meaning love alone can tell,\n  The sky had lost its sapphire hue,\n  The stars, dulled diamonds in their golden mount,\n  Twinkled no more nor shed their warmth.\n\n  The moon, washed of her silver radiance lily-white,\n  Hung mourning over the gloomy plain, for thou hast robbed\n  The heavens of all that made them bright.\n\n  The snowy sparkle of the moon is on thy lovely brow,\n  Heaven's azure centres in thine eyes,\n  Thy lashes fall like starry rays.\n\nWhat more gracious way of saying to a young girl that she fills your\nlife? Tell me what you think of this love, which expends itself in\nlavishing the treasures alike of the earth and of the soul. Only within\nthe last ten days have I grasped the meaning of that Spanish gallantry,\nso famous in old days.\n\nAh me! dear, what is going on now at La Crampade? How often do I take\na stroll there, inspecting the growth of our crops! Have you no news\nto give of our mulberry trees, our last winter's plantations? Does\neverything prosper as you wish? And while the buds are opening on our\nshrubs--I will not venture to speak of the bedding-out plants--have they\nalso blossomed in the bosom of the wife? Does Louis continue his policy\nof madrigals? Do you enter into each other's thoughts? I wonder whether\nyour little runlet of wedding peace is better than the raging torrent of\nmy love! Has my sweet lady professor taken offence? I cannot believe\nit; and if it were so, I should send Felipe off at once, post-haste, to\nfling himself at her knees and bring back to me my pardon or her head.\nSweet love, my life here is a splendid success, and I want to know how\nit fares with life in Provence. We have just increased our family by the\naddition of a Spaniard with the complexion of a Havana cigar, and your\ncongratulations still tarry.\n\nSeriously, my sweet Renee, I am anxious. I am afraid lest you should be\neating your heart out in silence, for fear of casting a gloom over my\nsunshine. Write to me at once, naughty child! and tell me your life in\nits every minutest detail; tell me whether you still hold back, whether\nyour \"independence\" still stands erect, or has fallen on its knees,\nor is sitting down comfortably, which would indeed be serious. Can you\nsuppose that the incidents of your married life are without interest for\nme? I muse at times over all that you have said to me. Often when, at\nthe Opera, I seem absorbed in watching the pirouetting dancers, I am\nsaying to myself, \"It is half-past nine, perhaps she is in bed. What is\nshe about? Is she happy? Is she alone with her independence? or has her\nindependence gone the way of other dead and castoff independences?\"\n\nA thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nXXV. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU\n\nSaucy girl! Why should I write? What could I say? Whilst your life is\nvaried by social festivities, as well as by the anguish, the tempers,\nand the flowers of love--all of which you describe so graphically, that\nI might be watching some first-rate acting at the theatre--mine is as\nmonotonous and regular as though it were passed in a convent.\n\nWe always go to bed at nine and get up with daybreak. Our meals are\nserved with a maddening punctuality. Nothing ever happens. I have\naccustomed myself without much difficulty to this mapping out of the\nday, which perhaps is, after all, in the nature of things. Where would\nthe life of the universe be but for that subjection to fixed laws which,\naccording to the astronomers, so Louis tells me, rule the spheres! It is\nnot order of which we weary.\n\nThen I have laid upon myself certain rules of dress, and these occupy\nmy time in the mornings. I hold it part of my duty as a wife to look as\ncharming as possible. I feel a certain satisfaction in it, and it causes\nlively pleasure to the good old man and to Louis. After lunch, we walk.\nWhen the newspapers arrive, I disappear to look after my household\naffairs or to read--for I read a great deal--or to write to you. I\ncome back to the others an hour before dinner; and after dinner we\nplay cards, or receive visits, or pay them. Thus my days pass between a\ncontented old man, who has done with passions, and the man who owes\nhis happiness to me. Louis' happiness is so radiant that it has at last\nwarmed my heart.\n\nFor women, happiness no doubt cannot consist in the mere satisfaction of\ndesire. Sometimes, in the evening, when I am not required to take a hand\nin the game, and can sink back in my armchair, imagination bears me on\nits strong wings into the very heart of your life. Then, its riches, its\nchangeful tints, its surging passions become my own, and I ask myself to\nwhat end such a stormy preface can lead. May I not swallow up the book\nitself? For you, my darling, the illusions of love are possible; for\nme, only the facts of homely life remain. Yes, your love seems to me a\ndream!\n\nTherefore I find it hard to understand why you are determined to throw\nso much romance over it. Your ideal man must have more soul than fire,\nmore nobility and self-command than passion. You persist in trying to\nclothe in living form the dream ideal of a girl on the threshold of\nlife; you demand sacrifices for the pleasure of rewarding them; you\nsubmit your Felipe to tests in order to ascertain whether desire, hope,\nand curiosity are enduring in their nature. But, child, behind all your\nfantastic stage scenery rises the altar, where everlasting bonds are\nforged. The very morrow of your marriage the graceful structure raised\nby your subtle strategy may fall before that terrible reality which\nmakes of a girl a woman, of a gallant a husband. Remember that there is\nnot exemption for lovers. For them, as for ordinary folk like Louis and\nme, there lurks beneath the wedding rejoicings the great \"Perhaps\" of\nRabelais.\n\nI do not blame you, though, of course, it was rash, for talking with\nFelipe in the garden, or for spending a night with him, you on your\nbalcony, he on his wall; but you make a plaything of life, and I am\nafraid that life may some day turn the tables. I dare not give you the\ncounsel which my own experience would suggest; but let me repeat once\nmore from the seclusion of my valley that the viaticum of married life\nlies in these words--resignation and self-sacrifice. For, spite of all\nyour tests, your coyness, and your vigilance, I can see that marriage\nwill mean to you what it has been to me. The greater the passion,\nthe steeper the precipice we have hewn for our fall--that is the only\ndifference.\n\nOh! what I would give to see the Baron de Macumer and talk with him for\nan hour or two! Your happiness lies so near my heart.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI. LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE March.\n\nAs Felipe has carried out, with a truly Saracenic generosity, the wishes\nof my father and mother in acknowledging the fortune he has not received\nfrom me, the Duchess has become even more friendly to me than before.\nShe calls me little sly-boots, little woman of the world, and says I\nknow how to use my tongue.\n\n\"But, dear mamma,\" I said to her the evening before the contract was\nsigned, \"you attribute to cunning and smartness on my part what is\nreally the outcome of the truest, simplest, most unselfish, most devoted\nlove that ever was! I assure you that I am not at all the 'woman of the\nworld' you do me the honor of believing me to be.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Armande,\" she said, putting her arm on my neck and drawing\nme to her, in order to kiss my forehead, \"you did not want to go back\nto the convent, you did not want to die an old maid, and, like a fine,\nnoble-hearted Chaulieu, as you are, you recognized the necessity of\nbuilding up your father's family. (The Duke was listening. If you knew,\nRenee, what flattery lies for him in these words.) I have watched you\nduring the whole winter, poking your little nose into all that goes\non, forming very sensible opinions about men and the present state of\nsociety in France. And you have picked out the one Spaniard capable of\ngiving you the splendid position of a woman who reigns supreme in her\nown house. My little girl, you treated him exactly as Tullia treats your\nbrother.\"\n\n\"What lessons they give in my sister's convent!\" exclaimed my father.\n\nA glance at my father cut him short at once; then, turning to the\nDuchess, I said:\n\n\"Madame, I love my future husband, Felipe de Soria, with all the\nstrength of my soul. Although this love sprang up without my knowledge,\nand though I fought it stoutly when it first made itself felt, I swear\nto you that I never gave way to it till I had recognized in the Baron de\nMacumer a character worthy of mine, a heart of which the delicacy, the\ngenerosity, the devotion, and the temper are suited to my own.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" she began, interrupting me, \"he is as ugly as...\"\n\n\"As anything you like,\" I retorted quickly, \"but I love his ugliness.\"\n\n\"If you love him, Armande,\" said my father, \"and have the strength to\nmaster your love, you must not risk your happiness. Now, happiness in\nmarriage depends largely on the first days--\"\n\n\"Days only?\" interrupted my mother. Then, with a glance at my father,\nshe continued, \"You had better leave us, my dear, to have our talk\ntogether.\"\n\n\"You are to be married, dear child,\" the Duchess then began in a low\nvoice, \"in three days. It becomes my duty, therefore, without silly\nwhimpering, which would be unfitting our rank in life, to give you the\nserious advice which every mother owes to her daughter. You are marrying\na man whom you love, and there is no reason why I should pity you or\nmyself. I have only known you for a year; and if this period has been\nlong enough for me to learn to love you, it is hardly sufficient to\njustify floods of tears at the idea of losing you. Your mental gifts\nare even more remarkable than those of your person; you have gratified\nmaternal pride, and have shown yourself a sweet and loving daughter. I,\nin my turn, can promise you that you will always find a staunch friend\nin your mother. You smile? Alas! it too often happens that a mother who\nhas lived on excellent terms with her daughter, as long as the daughter\nis a mere girl, comes to cross purposes with her when they are both\nwomen together.\n\n\"It is your happiness which I want, so listen to my words. The love\nwhich you now feel is that of a young girl, and is natural to us all,\nfor it is woman's destiny to cling to a man. Unhappily, pretty one,\nthere is but one man in the world for a woman! And sometimes this man,\nwhom fate has marked out for us, is not the one whom we, mistaking a\npassing fancy for love, choose as husband. Strange as what I say may\nappear to you, it is worth noting. If we cannot love the man we have\nchosen, the fault is not exclusively ours, it lies with both, or\nsometimes with circumstances over which we have no control. Yet there is\nno reason why the man chosen for us by our family, the man to whom our\nfancy has gone out, should not be the man whom we can love. The barriers\nwhich arise later between husband and wife are often due to lack of\nperseverance on both sides. The task of transforming a husband into a\nlover is not less delicate than that other task of making a husband\nof the lover, in which you have just proved yourself marvelously\nsuccessful.\n\n\"I repeat it, your happiness is my object. Never allow yourself, then,\nto forget that the first three months of your married life may work\nyour misery if you do not submit to the yoke with the same forbearance,\ntenderness, and intelligence that you have shown during the days of\ncourtship. For, my little rogue, you know very well that you have\nindulged in all the innocent pleasures of a clandestine love affair. If\nthe culmination of your love begins with disappointment, dislike, nay,\neven with pain, well, come and tell me about it. Don't hope for too much\nfrom marriage at first; it will perhaps give you more discomfort than\njoy. The happiness of your life requires at least as patient cherishing\nas the early shoots of love.\n\n\"To conclude, if by chance you should lose the lover, you will find in\nhis place the father of your children. In this, my dear child, lies the\nwhole secret of social life. Sacrifice everything to the man whose name\nyou bear, the man whose honor and reputation cannot suffer in the least\ndegree without involving you in frightful consequences. Such sacrifice\nis thus not only an absolute duty for women of our rank, it is also\ntheir wisest policy. This, indeed, is the distinctive mark of great\nmoral principles, that they hold good and are expedient from whatever\naspect they are viewed. But I need say no more to you on this point.\n\n\"I fancy you are of a jealous disposition, and, my dear, if you knew\nhow jealous I am! But you must not be stupid over it. To publish your\njealousy to the world is like playing at politics with your cards upon\nthe table, and those who let their own game be seen learn nothing\nof their opponents'. Whatever happens, we must know how to suffer in\nsilence.\"\n\nShe added that she intended having some plain talk about me with Macumer\nthe evening before the wedding.\n\nRaising my mother's beautiful arm, I kissed her hand and dropped on it\na tear, which the tone of real feeling in her voice had brought to my\neyes. In the advice she had given me, I read high principle worthy of\nherself and of me, true wisdom, and a tenderness of heart unspoilt by\nthe narrow code of society. Above all, I saw that she understood my\ncharacter. These few simple words summed up the lessons which life and\nexperience had brought her, perhaps at a heavy price. She was moved, and\nsaid, as she looked at me:\n\n\"Dear little girl, you've got a nasty crossing before you. And most\nwomen, in their ignorance or their disenchantment, are as wise as the\nEarl of Westmoreland!\"\n\nWe both laughed; but I must explain the joke. The evening before, a\nRussian princess had told us an anecdote of this gentleman. He had\nsuffered frightfully from sea-sickness in crossing the Channel, and\nturned tail when he got near Italy, because he had heard some one speak\nof \"crossing\" the Alps. \"Thank you; I've had quite enough crossings\nalready,\" he said.\n\nYou will understand, Renee, that your gloomy philosophy and my mother's\nlecture were calculated to revive the fears which used to disturb us at\nBlois. The nearer marriage approached, the more did I need to summon\nall my strength, my resolution, and my affection to face this terrible\npassage from maidenhood to womanhood. All our conversations came back to\nmy mind, I re-read your letters and discerned in them a vague undertone\nof sadness.\n\nThis anxiety had one advantage at least; it helped me to the regulation\nexpression for a bride as commonly depicted. The consequence was that\non the day of signing the contract everybody said I looked charming and\nquite the right thing. This morning, at the Mairie, it was an informal\nbusiness, and only the witnesses were present.\n\nI am writing this tail to my letter while they are putting out my\ndress for dinner. We shall be married at midnight at the Church of\nSainte-Valere, after a very gay evening. I confess that my fears give me\na martyr-like and modest air to which I have no right, but which will be\nadmired--why, I cannot conceive. I am delighted to see that poor Felipe\nis every whit as timorous as I am; society grates on him, he is like a\nbat in a glass shop.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, the day won't last for ever!\" he whispered to me in all\ninnocence.\n\nIn his bashfulness and timidity he would have liked to have no one\nthere.\n\nThe Sardinian ambassador, when he came to sign the contract, took me\naside in order to present me with a pearl necklace, linked together\nby six splendid diamonds--a gift from my sister-in-law, the Duchess de\nSoria. Along with the necklace was a sapphire bracelet, on the under\nside of which were engraved the words, \"_Though unknown, beloved_.\" Two\ncharming letters came with these presents, which, however, I could not\naccept without consulting Felipe.\n\n\"For,\" I said, \"I should not like to see you wearing ornaments that came\nfrom any one but me.\"\n\nHe kissed my hand, quite moved, and replied:\n\n\"Wear them for the sake of the inscription, and also for the kind\nfeeling, which is sincere.\"\n\nSaturday evening.\n\nHere, then, my poor Renee, are the last words of your girl friend. After\nthe midnight Mass, we set off for an estate which Felipe, with kind\nthought for me, has bought in Nivernais, on the way to Provence. Already\nmy name is Louise de Macumer, but I leave Paris in a few hours as Louise\nde Chaulieu. However I am called, there will never be for you but one\nLouise.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII. THE SAME TO THE SAME October.\n\nI have not written to you, dear, since our marriage, nearly eight months\nago. And not a line from you! Madame, you are inexcusable.\n\nTo begin with, we set off in a post-chaise for the Castle of\nChantepleurs, the property which Macumer has bought in Nivernais.\nIt stands on the banks of the Loire, sixty leagues from Paris. Our\nservants, with the exception of my maid, were there before us, and we\narrived, after a very rapid journey, the next evening. I slept all the\nway from Paris to beyond Montargis. My lord and master put his arm\nround me and pillowed my head on his shoulder, upon an arrangement of\nhandkerchiefs. This was the one liberty he took; and the almost motherly\ntenderness which got the better of his drowsiness, touched me strangely.\nI fell asleep then under the fire of his eyes, and awoke to find them\nstill blazing; the passionate gaze remained unchanged, but what thoughts\nhad come and gone meanwhile! Twice he had kissed me on the forehead.\n\nAt Briare we had breakfast in the carriage. Then followed a talk like\nour old talks at Blois, while the same Loire we used to admire called\nforth our praises, and at half-past seven we entered the noble long\navenue of lime-trees, acacias, sycamores, and larches which leads\nto Chantepleurs. At eight we dined; at ten we were in our bedroom, a\ncharming Gothic room, made comfortable with every modern luxury. Felipe,\nwho is thought so ugly, seemed to me quite beautiful in his graceful\nkindness and the exquisite delicacy of his affection. Of passion, not\na trace. All through the journey he might have been an old friend of\nfifteen years' standing. Later, he has described to me, with all the\nvivid touches of his first letter, the furious storms that raged within\nand were not allowed to ruffle the outer surface.\n\n\"So far, I have found nothing very terrible in marriage,\" I said, as I\nwalked to the window and looked out on the glorious moon which lit up a\ncharming park, breathing of heavy scents.\n\nHe drew near, put his arm again round me, and said:\n\n\"Why fear it? Have I ever yet proved false to my promise in gesture or\nlook? Why should I be false in the future?\"\n\nYet never were words or glances more full of mastery; his voice thrilled\nevery fibre of my heart and roused a sleeping force; his eyes were like\nthe sun in power.\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, \"what a world of Moorish perfidy in this attitude of\nperpetual prostration!\"\n\nHe understood, my dear.\n\nSo, my fair sweetheart, if I have let months slip by without writing,\nyou can now divine the cause. I have to recall the girl's strange past\nin order to explain the woman to myself. Renee, I understand you now.\nNot to her dearest friend, not to her mother, not, perhaps, even to\nherself, can a happy bride speak of her happiness. This memory ought to\nremain absolutely her own, an added rapture--a thing beyond words, too\nsacred for disclosure!\n\nIs it possible that the name of duty has been given to the delicious\nfrenzy of the heart, to the overwhelming rush of passion? And for what\npurpose? What malevolent power conceived the idea of crushing a woman's\nsensitive delicacy and all the thousand wiles of her modesty under\nthe fetters of constraint? What sense of duty can force from her these\nflowers of the heart, the roses of life, the passionate poetry of her\nnature, apart from love? To claim feeling as a right! Why, it blooms of\nitself under the sun of love, and shrivels to death under the cold blast\nof distaste and aversion! Let love guard his own rights!\n\nOh! my noble Renee! I understand you now. I bow to your greatness,\namazed at the depth and clearness of your insight. Yes, the woman who\nhas not used the marriage ceremony, as I have done, merely to legalize\nand publish the secret election of her heart, has nothing left but to\nfly to motherhood. When earth fails, the soul makes for heaven!\n\nOne hard truth emerges from all that you have said. Only men who are\nreally great know how to love, and now I understand the reason of this.\nMan obeys two forces--one sensual, one spiritual. Weak or inferior men\nmistake the first for the last, whilst great souls know how to clothe\nthe merely natural instinct in all the graces of the spirit. The very\nstrength of this spiritual passion imposes severe self-restraint and\ninspires them with reverence for women. Clearly, feeling is sensitive\nin proportion to the calibre of the mental powers generally, and this\nis why the man of genius alone has something of a woman's delicacy.\nHe understands and divines woman, and the wings of passion on which he\nraises her are restrained by the timidity of the sensitive spirit. But\nwhen the mind, the heart, and the senses all have their share in the\nrapture which transports us--ah! then there is no falling to earth,\nrather it is to heaven we soar, alas! for only too brief a visit.\n\nSuch, dear soul, is the philosophy of the first three months of my\nmarried life. Felipe is angelic. Without figure of speech, he is another\nself, and I can think aloud with him. His greatness of soul passes my\ncomprehension. Possession only attaches him more closely to me, and he\ndiscovers in his happiness new motives for loving me. For him, I am the\nnobler part of himself. I can foresee that years of wedded life, far\nfrom impairing his affection, will only make it more assured, develop\nfresh possibilities of enjoyment, and bind us in more perfect sympathy.\nWhat a delirium of joy!\n\nIt is part of my nature that pleasure has an exhilarating effect on me;\nit leaves sunshine behind, and becomes a part of my inner being. The\ninterval which parts one ecstasy from another is like the short night\nwhich marks off our long summer days. The sun which flushed the mountain\ntops with warmth in setting finds them hardly cold when it rises. What\nhappy chance has given me such a destiny? My mother had roused a host of\nfears in me; her forecast, which, though free from the alloy of vulgar\npettiness, seemed to me redolent of jealousy, has been falsified by the\nevent. Your fears and hers, my own--all have vanished in thin air!\n\nWe remained at Chantepleurs seven months and a half, for all the world\nlike a couple of runaway lovers fleeing the parental warmth, while the\nroses of pleasure crowned our love and embellished our dual solitude.\nOne morning, when I was even happier than usual, I began to muse over my\nlot, and suddenly Renee and her prosaic marriage flashed into my mind.\nIt seemed to me that now I could grasp the inner meaning in your life.\nOh! my sweet, why do we speak a different tongue? Your marriage of\nconvenience and my love match are two worlds, as widely separated as\nthe finite from infinity. You still walk the earth, whilst I range the\nheavens! Your sphere is human, mine divine! Love crowned me queen, you\nreign by reason and duty. So lofty are the regions where I soar, that a\nfall would shiver me to atoms.\n\nBut no more of this. I shrink from painting to you the rainbow\nbrightness, the profusion, the exuberant joy of love's springtime, as we\nknow it.\n\nFor ten days we have been in Paris, staying in a charming house in the\nRue du Bac, prepared for us by the architect to whom Felipe intrusted\nthe decoration of Chantepleurs. I have been listening, in all the full\ncontent of an assured and sanctioned love, to that divine music of\nRossini's, which used to soothe me when, as a restless girl, I hungered\nvaguely after experience. They say I am more beautiful, and I have a\nchildish pleasure in hearing myself called \"Madame.\"\n\nFriday morning.\n\nRenee, my fair saint, the happiness of my own life pulls me for ever\nback to you. I feel that I can be more to you than ever before, you are\nso dear to me! I have studied your wedded life closely in the light of\nmy own opening chapters; and you seem to me to come out of the scrutiny\nso great, so noble, so splendid in your goodness, that I here declare\nmyself your inferior and humble admirer, as well as your friend. When\nI think what marriage has been to me, it seems to me that I should have\ndied, had it turned out otherwise. And you live! Tell me what your heart\nfeeds on! Never again shall I make fun of you. Mockery, my sweet, is the\nchild of ignorance; we jest at what we know nothing of. \"Recruits will\nlaugh where the veteran soldier looks grave,\" was a remark made to me\nby the Comte de Chaulieu, that poor cavalry officer whose campaigning so\nfar has consisted in marches from Paris to Fontainebleau and back again.\n\nI surmise, too, my dear love, that you have not told me all. There\nare wounds which you have hidden. You suffer; I am convinced of it. In\ntrying to make out at this distance and from the scraps you tell me the\nreasons of your conduct, I have weaved together all sorts of romantic\ntheories about you. \"She has made a mere experiment in marriage,\" I\nthought one evening, \"and what is happiness for me had proved only\nsuffering to her. Her sacrifice is barren of reward, and she would not\nmake it greater than need be. The unctuous axioms of social morality are\nonly used to cloak her disappointment.\" Ah! Renee, the best of happiness\nis that it needs no dogma and no fine words to pave the way; it speaks\nfor itself, while theory has been piled upon theory to justify the\nsystem of women's vassalage and thralldom. If self-denial be so noble,\nso sublime, what, pray, of my joy, sheltered by the gold-and-white\ncanopy of the church, and witnessed by the hand and seal of the most\nsour-faced of mayors? Is it a thing out of nature?\n\nFor the honor of the law, for her own sake, but most of all to make my\nhappiness complete, I long to see my Renee content. Oh! tell me that\nyou see a dawn of love for this Louis who adores you! Tell me that the\nsolemn, symbolic torch of Hymen has not alone served to lighten your\ndarkness, but that love, the glorious sun of our hearts, pours his rays\non you. I come back always, you see, to this midday blaze, which will be\nmy destruction, I fear.\n\nDear Renee, do you remember how, in your outbursts of girlish devotion,\nyou would say to me, as we sat under the vine-covered arbor of the\nconvent garden, \"I love you so, Louise, that if God appeared to me in a\nvision, I would pray Him that all the sorrows of life might be mine, and\nall the joy yours. I burn to suffer for you\"? Now, darling, the day has\ncome when I take up your prayer, imploring Heaven to grant you a share\nin my happiness.\n\nI must tell you my idea. I have a shrewd notion that you are hatching\nambitious plans under the name of Louis de l'Estorade. Very good; get\nhim elected deputy at the approaching election, for he will be very\nnearly forty then; and as the Chamber does not meet till six months\nlater, he will have just attained the age necessary to qualify for a\nseat. You will come to Paris--there, isn't that enough? My father,\nand the friends I shall have made by that time, will learn to know and\nadmire you; and if your father-in-law will agree to found a family, we\nwill get the title of Comte for Louis. That is something at least! And\nwe shall be together.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER December.\n\nMy thrice happy Louise, your letter made me dizzy. For a few moments I\nheld it in my listless hands, while a tear or two sparkled on it in the\nsetting sun. I was alone beneath the small barren rock where I have had\na seat placed; far off, like a lance of steel, the Mediterranean shone.\nThe seat is shaded by aromatic shrubs, and I have had a very large\njessamine, some honeysuckle, and Spanish brooms transplanted there, so\nthat some day the rock will be entirely covered with climbing plants.\nThe wild vine has already taken root there. But winter draws near, and\nall this greenery is faded like a piece of old tapestry. In this spot I\nam never molested; it is understood that here I wish to be alone. It is\nnamed Louise's seat--a proof, is it not, that even in solitude I am not\nalone here?\n\nIf I tell you all these details, to you so paltry, and try to describe\nthe vision of green with which my prophetic gaze clothes this bare\nrock--on which top some freak of nature has set up a magnificent parasol\npine--it is because in all this I have found an emblem to which I cling.\n\nIt was while your blessed lot was filling me with joy and--must I\nconfess it?--with bitter envy too, that I felt the first movement of my\nchild within, and this mystery of physical life reacted upon the inner\nrecesses of my soul. This indefinable sensation, which partakes of\nthe nature at once of a warning, a delight, a pain, a promise, and a\nfulfilment; this joy, which is mine alone, unshared by mortal, this\nwonder of wonders, has whispered to me that one day this rock shall be a\ncarpet of flowers, resounding to the merry laughter of children, that\nI shall at last be blessed among women, and from me shall spring forth\nfountains of life. Now I know what I have lived for! Thus the first\ncertainty of bearing within me another life brought healing to my\nwounds. A joy that beggars description has crowned for me those long\ndays of sacrifice, in which Louis had already found his.\n\nSacrifice! I said to myself, how far does it excel passion! What\npleasure has roots so deep as one which is not personal but creative? Is\nnot the spirit of Sacrifice a power mightier than any of its results? Is\nit not that mysterious, tireless divinity, who hides beneath innumerable\nspheres in an unexplored centre, through which all worlds in turn must\npass? Sacrifice, solitary and secret, rich in pleasures only tasted\nin silence, which none can guess at, and no profane eye has ever\nseen; Sacrifice, jealous God and tyrant, God of strength and victory,\nexhaustless spring which, partaking of the very essence of all\nthat exists, can by no expenditure be drained below its own\nlevel;--Sacrifice, there is the keynote of my life.\n\nFor you, Louise, love is but the reflex of Felipe's passion; the life\nwhich I shed upon my little ones will come back to me in ever-growing\nfulness. The plenty of your golden harvest will pass; mine, though late,\nwill be but the more enduring, for each hour will see it renewed. Love\nmay be the fairest gem which Society has filched from Nature; but what\nis motherhood save Nature in her most gladsome mood? A smile has dried\nmy tears. Love makes my Louis happy, but marriage has made me a mother,\nand who shall say I am not happy also?\n\nWith slow steps, then, I returned to my white grange, with the green\nshutters, to write you these thoughts.\n\nSo it is, darling, that the most marvelous, and yet the simplest,\nprocess of nature has been going on in me for five months; and yet--in\nyour ear let me whisper it--so far it agitates neither my heart nor\nmy understanding. I see all around me happy; the grandfather-to-be has\nbecome a child again, trespassing on the grandchild's place; the father\nwears a grave and anxious look; they are all most attentive to me, all\ntalk of the joy of being a mother. Alas! I alone remain cold, and I dare\nnot tell you how dead I am to all emotion, though I affect a little in\norder not to damp the general satisfaction. But with you I may be frank;\nand I confess that, at my present stage, motherhood is a mere affair of\nthe imagination.\n\nLouis was to the full as much surprised as I. Does not this show how\nlittle, unless by his impatient wishes, the father counts for in this\nmatter? Chance, my dear, is the sovereign deity in child-bearing. My\ndoctor, while maintaining that this chance works in harmony with nature,\ndoes not deny that children who are the fruit of passionate love are\nbound to be richly endowed both physically and mentally, and that often\nthe happiness which shone like a radiant star over their birth seems to\nwatch over them through life. It may be then, Louise, that motherhood\nreserves joys for you which I shall never know. It may be that the\nfeeling of a mother for the child of a man whom she adores, as you adore\nFelipe, is different from that with which she regards the offspring of\nreason, duty, and desperation!\n\nThoughts such as these, which I bury in my inmost heart, add to the\npreoccupation only natural to a woman soon to be a mother. And yet, as\nthe family cannot exist without children, I long to speed the moment\nfrom which the joys of family, where alone I am to find my life, shall\ndate their beginning. At present I live a life all expectation and\nmystery, except for a sickening physical discomfort, which no doubt\nserves to prepare a woman for suffering of a different kind. I watch my\nsymptoms; and in spite of the attentions and thoughtful care with which\nLouis' anxiety surrounds me, I am conscious of a vague uneasiness,\nmingled with the nausea, the distaste for food, and abnormal longings\ncommon to my condition. If I am to speak candidly, I must confess,\nat the risk of disgusting you with the whole business, to an\nincomprehensible craving for rotten fruit. My husband goes to Marseilles\nto fetch the finest oranges the world produces--from Malta, Portugal,\nCorsica--and these I don't touch. Then I hurry there myself, sometimes\non foot, and in a little back street, running down to the harbor, close\nto the Town Hall, I find wretched, half-putrid oranges, two for a sou,\nwhich I devour eagerly. The bluish, greenish shades on the mouldy parts\nsparkle like diamonds in my eyes, they are flowers to me; I forget\nthe putrid odor, and find them delicious, with a piquant flavor, and\nstimulating as wine. My dear, they are the first love of my life! Your\npassion for Felipe is nothing to this! Sometimes I can slip out secretly\nand fly to Marseilles, full of passionate longings, which grow more\nintense as I draw near the street. I tremble lest the woman should be\nsold out of rotten oranges; I pounce on them and devour them as I stand.\nIt seems to me an ambrosial food, and yet I have seen Louis turn aside,\nunable to bear the smell. Then came to my mind the ghastly words of\nObermann in his gloomy elegy, which I wish I had never read, \"Roots\nslake their thirst in foulest streams.\" Since I took to this diet, the\nsickness has ceased, and I feel much stronger. This depravity of taste\nmust have a meaning, for it seems to be part of a natural process and to\nbe common to most women, sometimes going to most extravagant lengths.\n\nWhen my situation is more marked, I shall not go beyond the grounds,\nfor I should not like to be seen under these circumstances. I have\nthe greatest curiosity to know at what precise moment the sense of\nmotherhood begins. It cannot possibly be in the midst of frightful\nsuffering, the very thought of which makes me shudder.\n\nFarewell, favorite of fortune! Farewell, my friend, in whom I live\nagain, and through whom I am able to picture to myself this brave love,\nthis jealousy all on fire at a look, these whisperings in the ear,\nthese joys which create for women, as it were, a new atmosphere, a new\ndaylight, fresh life! Ah! pet, I too understand love. Don't weary of\ntelling me everything. Keep faithful to our bond. I promise, in my turn,\nto spare you nothing.\n\nNay--to conclude in all seriousness--I will not conceal from you that,\non reading your letter a second time, I was seized with a dread which\nI could not shake off. This superb love seems like a challenge to\nProvidence. Will not the sovereign master of this earth, Calamity, take\numbrage if no place be left for him at your feast? What mighty edifice\nof fortune has he not overthrown? Oh! Louise, forget not, in all this\nhappiness, your prayers to God. Do good, be kind and merciful; let your\nmoderation, if it may be, avert disaster. Religion has meant much more\nto me since I left the convent and since my marriage; but your Paris\nnews contains no mention of it. In your glorification of Felipe it seems\nto me you reverse the saying, and invoke God less than His saint.\n\nBut, after all, this panic is only excess of affection. You go to church\ntogether, I do not doubt, and do good in secret. The close of this\nletter will seem to you very primitive, I expect, but think of the too\neager friendship which prompts these fears--a friendship of the type\nof La Fontaine's, which takes alarms at dreams, at half-formed, misty\nideas. You deserve to be happy, since, through it all, you still think\nof me, no less than I think of you, in my monotonous life, which, though\nit lacks color, is yet not empty, and, if uneventful, is not unfruitful.\nGod bless you, then!\n\n\n\n\nXXIX. M. DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER December 1825.\n\nMadame,--It is the desire of my wife that you should not learn first\nfrom the formal announcement of an event which has filled us with\njoy. Renee has just given birth to a fine boy, whose baptism we are\npostponing till your return to Chantepleurs. Renee and I both earnestly\nhope that you may then come as far as La Crampade, and will consent to\nact as godmother to our firstborn. In this hope, I have had him placed\non the register under the name of Armand-Louis de l'Estorade.\n\nOur dear Renee suffered much, but bore it with angelic patience. You,\nwho know her, will easily understand that the assurance of bringing\nhappiness to us all supported her through this trying apprenticeship to\nmotherhood.\n\nWithout indulging in the more or less ludicrous exaggerations to which\nthe novel sensation of being a father is apt to give rise, I may tell\nyou that little Armand is a beautiful infant, and you will have no\ndifficulty in believing it when I add that he has Renee's features and\neyes. So far, at least, this gives proof of intelligence.\n\nThe physician and accoucheur assure us that Renee is now quite out of\ndanger; and as she is proving an admirable nurse--Nature has endowed her\nso generously!--my father and I are able to give free rein to our joy.\nMadame, may I be allowed to express the hope that this joy, so vivid and\nintense, which has brought fresh life into our house, and has changed\nthe face of existence for my dear wife, may ere long be yours?\n\nRenee has had a suite of rooms prepared, and I only wish I could make\nthem worthy of our guests. But the cordial friendliness of the reception\nwhich awaits you may perhaps atone for any lack of splendor.\n\nI have heard from Renee, madame, of your kind thought in regard to us,\nand I take this opportunity of thanking you for it, the more gladly\nbecause nothing could now be more appropriate. The birth of a grandson\nhas reconciled my father to sacrifices which bear hardly on an old man.\nHe has just bought two estates, and La Crampade is now a property with\nan annual rental of thirty thousand francs. My father intends asking the\nKing's permission to form an entailed estate of it; and if you are good\nenough to get for him the title of which you spoke in your last letter,\nyou will have already done much for your godson.\n\nFor my part, I shall carry out your suggestions solely with the object\nof bringing you and Renee together during the sessions of the Chamber.\nI am working hard with the view of becoming what is called a specialist.\nBut nothing could give me greater encouragement in my labors than the\nthought that you will take an interest in my little Armand. Come, then,\nwe beg of you, and with your beauty and your grace, your playful fancy\nand your noble soul, enact the part of good fairy to my son and heir.\nYou will thus, madame, add undying gratitude to the respectful regard of\nYour very humble, obedient servant, LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE.\n\n\n\n\nXXX. LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE January 1826.\n\nMacumer has just wakened me, darling, with your husband's letter. First\nand foremost--Yes. We shall be going to Chantepleurs about the end of\nApril. To me it will be a piling up of pleasure to travel, to see\nyou, and to be the godmother of your first child. I must, please, have\nMacumer for godfather. To take part in a ceremony of the Church with\nanother as my partner would be hateful to me. Ah! if you could see the\nlook he gave me as I said this, you would know what store this sweetest\nof lovers sets on his wife!\n\n\"I am the more bent on our visiting La Crampade together, Felipe,\" I\nwent on, \"because I might have a child there. I too, you know, would be\na mother!... And yet, can you fancy me torn in two between you and\nthe infant? To begin with, if I saw any creature--were it even my\nown son--taking my place in your heart, I couldn't answer for the\nconsequences. Medea may have been right after all. The Greeks had some\ngood notions!\"\n\nAnd he laughed.\n\nSo, my sweetheart, you have the fruit without the flowers; I the flowers\nwithout the fruit. The contrast in our lives still holds good. Between\nthe two of us we have surely enough philosophy to find the moral of it\nsome day. Bah! only ten months married! Too soon, you will admit, to\ngive up hope.\n\nWe are leading a gay, yet far from empty life, as is the way with happy\npeople. The days are never long enough for us. Society, seeing me in\nthe trappings of a married woman, pronounces the Baronne de Macumer\nmuch prettier than Louise de Chaulieu: a happy love is a most becoming\ncosmetic. When Felipe and I drive along the Champs-Elysees in the\nbright sunshine of a crisp January day, beneath the trees, frosted with\nclusters of white stars, and face all Paris on the spot where last year\nwe met with a gulf between us, the contrast calls up a thousand fancies.\nSuppose, after all, your last letter should be right in its forecast,\nand we are too presumptuous!\n\nIf I am ignorant of a mother's joys, you shall tell me about them; I\nwill learn by sympathy. But my imagination can picture nothing to equal\nthe rapture of love. You will laugh at my extravagance; but, I assure\nyou, that a dozen times in as many months the longing has seized me to\ndie at thirty, while life was still untarnished, amidst the roses of\nlove, in the embrace of passion. To bid farewell to the feast at its\nbrightest, before disappointment has come, having lived in this sunshine\nand celestial air, and well-nigh spent myself in love, not a leaf\ndropped from my crown, not an illusion perished in my heart, what a\ndream is there! Think what it would be to bear about a young heart in an\naged body, to see only cold, dumb faces around me, where even strangers\nused to smile; to be a worthy matron! Can Hell have a worse torture?\n\nOn this very subject, in fact, Felipe and I have had our first quarrel.\nI contended that he ought to have sufficient moral strength to kill me\nin my sleep when I have reached thirty, so that I might pass from one\ndream to another. The wretch declined. I threatened to leave him alone\nin the world, and, poor child, he turned white as a sheet. My dear,\nthis distinguished statesman is neither more nor less than a baby. It is\nincredible what youth and simplicity he contrived to hide away. Now that\nI allow myself to think aloud with him, as I do with you, and have no\nsecrets from him, we are always giving each other surprises.\n\nDear Renee, Felipe and Louise, the pair of lovers, want to send a\npresent to the young mother. We would like to get something that would\ngive you pleasure, and we don't share the popular taste for surprises;\nso tell me quite frankly, please, what you would like. It ought to be\nsomething which would recall us to you in a pleasant way, something\nwhich you will use every day, and which won't wear out with use. The\nmeal which with us is most cheerful and friendly is lunch, and therefore\nthe idea occurred to me of a special luncheon service, ornamented with\nfigures of babies. If you approve of this, let me know at once; for it\nwill have to be ordered immediately if we are to bring it. Paris artists\nare gentlemen of far too much importance to be hurried. This will be my\noffering to Lucina.\n\nFarewell, dear nursing mother. May all a mother's delights be yours! I\nawait with impatience your first letter, which will tell me all about\nit, I hope. Some of the details in your husband's letter went to my\nheart. Poor Renee, a mother has a heavy price to pay. I will tell my\ngodson how dearly he must love you. No end of love, my sweet one.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER\n\nIt is nearly five months now since baby was born, and not once, dear\nheart, have I found a single moment for writing to you. When you are a\nmother yourself, you will be more ready to excuse me, than you are now;\nfor you have punished me a little bit in making your own letters so few\nand far between. Do write, my darling! Tell me of your pleasures; lay on\nthe blue as brightly as you please. It will not hurt me, for I am happy\nnow, happier than you can imagine.\n\nI went in state to the parish church to hear the Mass for recovery from\nchildbirth, as is the custom in the old families of Provence. I was\nsupported on either side by the two grandfathers--Louis' father and my\nown. Never had I knelt before God with such a flood of gratitude in my\nheart. I have so much to tell you of, so many feelings to describe, that\nI don't know where to begin; but from amidst these confused memories,\none rises distinctly, that of my prayer in the church.\n\nWhen I found myself transformed into a joyful mother, on the very spot\nwhere, as a girl, I had trembled for my future, it seemed to my fancy\nthat the Virgin on the altar bowed her head and pointed to the infant\nChrist, who smiled at me! My heart full of pure and heavenly love,\nI held out little Armand for the priest to bless and bathe, in\nanticipation of the regular baptism to come later. But you will see us\ntogether then, Armand and me.\n\nMy child--come see how readily the word comes, and indeed there is none\nsweeter to a mother's heart and mind or on her lips--well, then, dear\nchild, during the last two months I used to drag myself wearily and\nheavily about the gardens, not realizing yet how precious was the\nburden, spite of all the discomforts it brought! I was haunted by\nforebodings so gloomy and ghastly, that they got the better even of\ncuriosity; in vain did I picture the delights of motherhood. My heart\nmade no response even to the thought of the little one, who announced\nhimself by lively kicking. That is a sensation, dear, which may be\nwelcome when it is familiar; but as a novelty, it is more strange than\npleasing. I speak for myself at least; you know I would never affect\nanything I did not really feel, and I look on my child as a gift\nstraight from Heaven. For one who saw in it rather the image of the man\nshe loved, it might be different.\n\nBut enough of such sad thoughts, gone, I trust, for ever.\n\nWhen the crisis came, I summoned all my powers of resistance, and braced\nmyself so well for suffering, that I bore the horrible agony--so they\ntell me--quite marvelously. For about an hour I sank into a sort of\nstupor, of the nature of a dream. I seemed to myself then two beings--an\nouter covering racked and tortured by red-hot pincers, and a soul at\npeace. In this strange state the pain formed itself into a sort of halo\nhovering over me. A gigantic rose seemed to spring out of my head\nand grow ever larger and larger, till it enfolded me in its blood-red\npetals. The same color dyed the air around, and everything I saw was\nblood-red. At last the climax came, when soul and body seemed no longer\nable to hold together; the spasms of pain gripped me like death itself.\nI screamed aloud, and found fresh strength against this fresh torture.\nSuddenly this concert of hideous cries was overborne by a joyful\nsound--the shrill wail of the newborn infant. No words can describe that\nmoment. It was as though the universe took part in my cries, when all at\nonce the chorus of pain fell hushed before the child's feeble note.\n\nThey laid me back again in the large bed, and it felt like paradise to\nme, even in my extreme exhaustion. Three or four happy faces pointed\nthrough tears to the child. My dear, I exclaimed in terror:\n\n\"It's just like a little monkey! Are you really and truly certain it is\na child?\"\n\nI fell back on my side, miserably disappointed at my first experience of\nmotherly feeling.\n\n\"Don't worry, dear,\" said my mother, who had installed herself as\nnurse. \"Why, you've got the finest baby in the world. You mustn't excite\nyourself; but give your whole mind now to turning yourself as much as\npossible into an animal, a milch cow, pasturing in the meadow.\"\n\nI fell asleep then, fully resolved to let nature have her way.\n\nAh! my sweet, how heavenly it was to waken up from all the pain\nand haziness of the first days, when everything was still dim,\nuncomfortable, confused. A ray of light pierced the darkness; my heart\nand soul, my inner self--a self I had never known before--rent the\nenvelope of gloomy suffering, as a flower bursts its sheath at the first\nwarm kiss of the sun, at the moment when the little wretch fastened on\nmy breast and sucked. Not even the sensation of the child's first cry\nwas so exquisite as this. This is the dawn of motherhood, this is the\n_Fiat lux_!\n\nHere is happiness, joy ineffable, though it comes not without pangs. Oh!\nmy sweet jealous soul, how you will relish a delight which exists only\nfor ourselves, the child, and God! For this tiny creature all knowledge\nis summed up in its mother's breast. This is the one bright spot in its\nworld, towards which its puny strength goes forth. Its thoughts cluster\nround this spring of life, which it leaves only to sleep, and whither\nit returns on waking. Its lips have a sweetness beyond words, and their\npressure is at once a pain and a delight, a delight which by every\nexcess becomes pain, or a pain which culminates in delight. The\nsensation which rises from it, and which penetrates to the very core\nof my life, baffles all description. It seems a sort of centre whence a\nmyriad joy-bearing rays gladden the heart and soul. To bear a child is\nnothing; to nourish it is birth renewed every hour.\n\nOh! Louise, there is no caress of lover with half the power of those\nlittle pink hands, as they stray about, seeking whereby to lay hold on\nlife. And the infant glances, now turned upon the breast, now raised to\nmeet our own! What dreams come to us as we watch the clinging nursling!\nAll our powers, whether of mind or body, are at its service; for it we\nbreathe and think, in it our longings are more than satisfied! The\nsweet sensation of warmth at the heart, which the sound of his first cry\nbrought to me--like the first ray of sunshine on the earth--came again\nas I felt the milk flow into his mouth, again as his eyes met mine, and\nat this moment I have felt it once more as his first smile gave token of\na mind working within--for he has laughed, my dear! A laugh, a glance,\na bite, a cry--four miracles of gladness which go straight to the heart\nand strike chords that respond to no other touch. A child is tied to\nour heart-strings, as the spheres are linked to their creator; we cannot\nthink of God except as a mother's heart writ large.\n\nIt is only in the act of nursing that a woman realizes her motherhood\nin visible and tangible fashion; it is a joy of every moment. The\nmilk becomes flesh before our eyes; it blossoms into the tips of those\ndelicate flower-like fingers; it expands in tender, transparent nails;\nit spins the silky tresses; it kicks in the little feet. Oh! those baby\nfeet, how plainly they talk to us! In them the child finds its first\nlanguage.\n\nYes, Louise, nursing is a miracle of transformation going on before\none's bewildered eyes. Those cries, they go to your heart and not your\nears; those smiling eyes and lips, those plunging feet, they speak\nin words which could not be plainer if God traced them before you in\nletters of fire! What else is there in the world to care about? The\nfather? Why, you could kill him if he dreamed of waking the baby! Just\nas the child is the world to us, so do we stand alone in the world for\nthe child. The sweet consciousness of a common life is ample recompense\nfor all the trouble and suffering--for suffering there is. Heaven save\nyou, Louise, from ever knowing the maddening agony of a wound which\ngapes afresh with every pressure of rosy lips, and is so hard to\nheal--the heaviest tax perhaps imposed on beauty. For know, Louise, and\nbeware! it visits only a fair and delicate skin.\n\nMy little ape has in five months developed into the prettiest darling\nthat ever mother bathed in tears of joy, washed, brushed, combed, and\nmade smart; for God knows what unwearied care we lavish upon those\ntender blossoms! So my monkey has ceased to exist, and behold in his\nstead a _baby_, as my English nurse says, a regular pink-and-white baby.\nHe cries very little too now, for he is conscious of the love bestowed\non him; indeed, I hardly ever leave him, and I strive to wrap him round\nin the atmosphere of my love.\n\nDear, I have a feeling now for Louis which is not love, but which ought\nto be the crown of a woman's love where it exists. Nay, I am not sure\nwhether this tender fondness, this unselfish gratitude, is not superior\nto love. From all that you have told me of it, dear pet, I gather that\nlove has something terribly earthly about it, whilst a strain of holy\npiety purifies the affection a happy mother feels for the author of her\nfar-reaching and enduring joys. A mother's happiness is like a beacon,\nlighting up the future, but reflected also on the past in the guise of\nfond memories.\n\nThe old l'Estorade and his son have moreover redoubled their devotion to\nme; I am like a new person to them. Every time they see me and speak\nto me, it is with a fresh holiday joy, which touches me deeply. The\ngrandfather has, I verily believe, turned child again; he looks at me\nadmiringly, and the first time I came down to lunch he was moved to\ntears to see me eating and suckling the child. The moisture in these dry\nold eyes, generally expressive only of avarice, was a wonderful comfort\nto me. I felt that the good soul entered into my joy.\n\nAs for Louis, he would shout aloud to the trees and stones of the\nhighway that he has a son; and he spends whole hours watching your\nsleeping godson. He does not know, he says, when he will grow used to\nit. These extravagant expressions of delight show me how great must\nhave been their fears beforehand. Louis has confided in me that he had\nbelieved himself condemned to be childless. Poor fellow! he has all\nat once developed very much, and he works even harder than he did. The\nfather in him has quickened his ambition.\n\nFor myself, dear soul, I grow happier and happier every moment. Each\nhour creates a fresh tie between the mother and her infant. The very\nnature of my feelings proves to me that they are normal, permanent, and\nindestructible; whereas I shrewdly suspect love, for instance, of being\nintermittent. Certainly it is not the same at all moments, the flowers\nwhich it weaves into the web of life are not all of equal brightness;\nlove, in short, can and must decline. But a mother's love has no\nebb-tide to fear; rather it grows with the growth of the child's needs,\nand strengthens with its strength. Is it not at once a passion, a\nnatural craving, a feeling, a duty, a necessity, a joy? Yes, darling,\nhere is woman's true sphere. Here the passion for self-sacrifice can\nexpend itself, and no jealousy intrudes.\n\nHere, too, is perhaps the single point on which society and nature\nare at one. Society, in this matter, enforces the dictates of nature,\nstrengthening the maternal instinct by adding to it family spirit and\nthe desire of perpetuating a name, a race, an estate. How tenderly must\nnot a woman cherish the child who has been the first to open up to her\nthese joys, the first to call forth the energies of her nature and to\ninstruct her in the grand art of motherhood! The right of the eldest,\nwhich in the earliest times formed a part of the natural order and was\nlost in the origins of society, ought never, in my opinion, to have been\nquestioned. Ah! how much a mother learns from her child! The constant\nprotection of a helpless being forces us to so strict an alliance with\nvirtue, that a woman never shows to full advantage except as a mother.\nThen alone can her character expand in the fulfilment of all life's\nduties and the enjoyment of all its pleasures. A woman who is not a\nmother is maimed and incomplete. Hasten, then, my sweetest, to fulfil\nyour mission. Your present happiness will then be multiplied by the\nwealth of my delights.\n\n23rd.\n\nI had to tear myself from you because your godson was crying. I can\nhear his cry from the bottom of the garden. But I would not let this go\nwithout a word of farewell. I have just been reading over what I have\nsaid, and am horrified to see how vulgar are the feelings expressed!\nWhat I feel, every mother, alas! since the beginning must have felt, I\nsuppose, in the same way, and put into the same words. You will laugh\nat me, as we do at the naive father who dilates on the beauty and\ncleverness of his (of course) quite exceptional offspring. But the\nrefrain of my letter, darling, is this, and I repeat it: I am as happy\nnow as I used to be miserable. This grange--and is it not going to be an\nestate, a family property?--has become my land of promise. The desert is\npast and over. A thousand loves, darling pet. Write to me, for now I can\nread without a tear the tale of your happy love. Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII. MME. DE MACUMER TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE March 1826.\n\nDo you know, dear, that it is more than three months since I have\nwritten to you or heard from you? I am the more guilty of the two, for I\ndid not reply to your last, but you don't stand on punctilio surely?\n\nMacumer and I have taken your silence for consent as regards the\nbaby-wreathed luncheon service, and the little cherubs are starting this\nmorning for Marseilles. It took six months to carry out the design.\nAnd so when Felipe asked me to come and see the service before it was\npacked, I suddenly waked up to the fact that we had not interchanged a\nword since the letter of yours which gave me an insight into a mother's\nheart.\n\nMy sweet, it is this terrible Paris--there's my excuse. What, pray, is\nyours? Oh! what a whirlpool is society! Didn't I tell you once that\nin Paris one must be as the Parisians? Society there drives out all\nsentiment; it lays en embargo on your time; and unless you are\nvery careful, soon eats away your heart altogether. What an amazing\nmasterpiece is the character of Celimene in Moliere's _Le Misanthrope_!\nShe is the society woman, not only of Louis XIV.'s time, but of our own,\nand of all, time.\n\nWhere should I be but for my breastplate--the love I bear Felipe? This\nvery morning I told him, as the outcome of these reflections, that he\nwas my salvation. If my evenings are a continuous round of parties,\nballs, concerts, and theatres, at night my heart expands again, and\nis healed of the wounds received in the world by the delights of the\npassionate love which await my return.\n\nI dine at home only when we have friends, so-called, with us, and spend\nthe afternoon there only on my day, for I have a day now--Wednesday--for\nreceiving. I have entered the lists with Mmes. d'Espard and de\nMaufrigneuse, and with the old Duchesse de Lenoncourt, and my house has\nthe reputation of being a very lively one. I allowed myself to become\nthe fashion, because I saw how much pleasure my success gave Felipe. My\nmornings are his; from four in the afternoon till two in the morning I\nbelong to Paris. Macumer makes an admirable host, witty and dignified,\nperfect in courtesy, and with an air of real distinction. No woman could\nhelp loving such a husband even if she had chosen him without consulting\nher heart.\n\nMy father and mother have left for Madrid. Louis XVIII. being out of the\nway, the Duchess had no difficulty in obtaining from our good-natured\nCharles X. the appointment of her fascinating poet; so he is carried off\nin the capacity of attache.\n\nMy brother, the Duc de Rhetore, deigns to recognize me as a person of\nmark. As for my younger brother, The Comte de Chaulieu, this buckram\nwarrior owes me everlasting gratitude. Before my father left, he spent\nmy fortune in acquiring for the Count an estate of forty thousand francs\na year, entailed on the title, and his marriage with Mlle. de Mortsauf,\nan heiress from Touraine, is definitely arranged. The King, in order to\npreserve the name and titles of the de Lenoncourt and de Givry families\nfrom extinction, is to confer these, together with the armorial\nbearings, by patent on my brother. Certainly it would never have done\nto allow these two fine names and their splendid motto, _Faciem semper\nmonstramus_, to perish. Mlle. de Mortsauf, who is granddaughter and\nsole heiress of the Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry, will, it is said, inherit\naltogether more than one hundred thousand livres a year. The only\nstipulation my father has made is that the de Chaulieu arms should\nappear in the centre of the de Lenoncourt escutcheon. Thus my brother\nwill be Duc de Lenoncourt. The young de Mortsauf, to whom everything\nwould otherwise go, is in the last stage of consumption; his death is\nlooked for every day. The marriage will take place next winter when\nthe family are out of mourning. I am told that I shall have a charming\nsister-in-law in Mlle. de Mortsauf.\n\nSo you see that my father's reasoning is justified. The outcome of\nit all has won me many compliments, and my marriage is explained\nto everybody's satisfaction. To complete our success, the Prince de\nTalleyrand, out of affection for my grandmother, is showing himself a\nwarm friend to Macumer. Society, which began by criticising me, has now\npassed to cordial admiration.\n\nIn short, I now reign a queen where, barely two years ago, I was an\ninsignificant item. Macumer finds himself the object of universal envy,\nas the husband of \"the most charming woman in Paris.\" At least a score\nof women, as you know, are always in that proud position. Men murmur\nsweet things in my ear, or content themselves with greedy glances. This\nchorus of longing and admiration is so soothing to one's vanity, that I\nconfess I begin to understand the unconscionable price women are ready\nto pay for such frail and precarious privileges. A triumph of this kind\nis like strong wine to vanity, self-love, and all the self-regarding\nfeelings. To pose perpetually as a divinity is a draught so potent in\nits intoxicating effects, that I am no longer surprised to see women\ngrow selfish, callous, and frivolous in the heart of this adoration. The\nfumes of society mount to the head. You lavish the wealth of your soul\nand spirit, the treasures of your time, the noblest efforts of your\nwill, upon a crowd of people who repay you in smiles and jealousy. The\nfalse coin of their pretty speeches, compliments, and flattery is the\nonly return they give for the solid gold of your courage and sacrifices,\nand all the thought that must go to keep up without flagging the\nstandard of beauty, dress, sparkling talk, and general affability. You\nare perfectly aware how much it costs, and that the whole thing is a\nfraud, but you cannot keep out of the vortex.\n\nAh! my sweetheart, how one craves for a real friend! How precious to me\nare the love and devotion of Felipe, and how my heart goes out to you!\nJoyfully indeed are we preparing for our move to Chantepleurs, where\nwe can rest from the comedy of the Rue de Bac and of the Paris\ndrawing-rooms. Having just read your letter again, I feel that I cannot\nbetter describe this demoniac paradise than by saying that no woman of\nfashion in Paris can possibly be a good mother.\n\nGood-bye, then, for a short time, dear one. We shall stay at\nChantepleurs only a week at most, and shall be with you about May 10th.\nSo we are actually to meet again after more than two years! What changes\nsince then! Here we are, both matrons, both in our promised land--I of\nlove, you of motherhood.\n\nIf I have not written, my sweetest, it is not because I have forgotten\nyou. And what of the monkey godson? Is he still pretty and a credit to\nme? He must be more than nine months' old now. I should dearly like to\nbe present when he makes his first steps upon this earth; but Macumer\ntells me that even precocious infants hardly walk at ten months.\n\nWe shall have some good gossips there, and \"cut pinafores,\" as the Blois\nfolk say. I shall see whether a child, as the saying goes, spoils the\npattern.\n\nP. S.--If you deign to reply from your maternal heights, address to\nChantepleurs. I am just off.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. DE MACUMER\n\nMy child,--If ever you become a mother, you will find out that it is\nimpossible to write letters during the first two months of your nursing.\nMary, my English nurse, and I are both quite knocked up. It is true I\nhad not told you that I was determined to do everything myself.\nBefore the event I had with my own fingers sewn the baby clothes and\nembroidered and edged with lace the little caps. I am a slave, my pet, a\nslave day and night.\n\nTo begin with, Master Armand-Louis takes his meals when it pleases\nhim, and that is always; then he has often to be changed, washed, and\ndressed. His mother is so fond of watching him sleep, of singing songs\nto him, of walking him about in her arms on a fine day, that she has\nlittle time left to attend to herself. In short, what society has been\nto you, my child--our child--has been to me!\n\nI cannot tell you how full and rich my life has become, and I long\nfor your coming that you may see for yourself. The only thing is, I\nam afraid he will soon be teething, and that you will find a peevish,\ncrying baby. So far he has not cried much, for I am always at hand.\nBabies only cry when their wants are not understood, and I am constantly\non the lookout for his. Oh! my sweet, my heart has opened up so wide,\nwhile you allow yours to shrink and shrivel at the bidding of society! I\nlook for your coming with all a hermit's longing. I want so much to know\nwhat you think of l'Estorade, just as you no doubt are curious for my\nopinion of Macumer.\n\nWrite to me from your last resting-place. The gentlemen want to go and\nmeet our distinguished guests. Come, Queen of Paris, come to our humble\ngrange, where love at least will greet you!\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE April 1826.\n\nThe name on this address will tell you, dear, that my petition has been\ngranted. Your father-in-law is now Comte de l'Estorade. I would not\nleave Paris till I had obtained the gratification of your wishes, and I\nam writing in the presence of the Keeper of the Seals, who has come to\ntell me that the patent is signed.\n\nGood-bye for a short time!\n\n\n\n\nXXXV. THE SAME TO THE SAME MARSEILLES, July.\n\nI am ashamed to think how my sudden flight will have taken you by\nsurprise. But since I am above all honest, and since I love you not one\nbit the less, I shall tell you the truth in four words: I am horribly\njealous!\n\nFelipe's eyes were too often on you. You used to have little talks\ntogether at the foot of your rock, which were a torture to me; and I\nwas fast becoming irritable and unlike myself. Your truly Spanish beauty\ncould not fail to recall to him his native land, and along with it Marie\nHeredia, and I can be jealous of the past too. Your magnificent black\nhair, your lovely dark eyes, your brow, where the peaceful joy of\nmotherhood stands out radiant against the shadows which tell of past\nsuffering, the freshness of your southern skin, far fairer than that\nof a blonde like me, the splendid lines of your figure, the breasts,\non which my godson hangs, peeping through the lace like some luscious\nfruit,--all this stabbed me in the eyes and in the heart. In vain did\nI stick cornflowers in my curls, in vain set off with cherry-colored\nribbons the tameness of my pale locks, everything looked washed out when\nRenee appeared--a Renee so unlike the one I expected to find in your\noasis.\n\nThen Felipe made too much of the child, whom I found myself beginning to\nhate. Yes, I confess it, that exuberance of life which fills your house,\nmaking it gay with shouts and laughter--I wanted it for myself. I read a\nregret in Macumer's eyes, and, unknown to him, I cried over it two whole\nnights. I was miserable in your house. You are too beautiful as a woman,\ntoo triumphant as a mother, for me to endure your company.\n\nAh! you complained of your lot. Hypocrite! What would you have?\nL'Estorade is most presentable; he talks well; he has fine eyes; and his\nblack hair, dashed with white, is very becoming; his southern manners,\ntoo, have something attractive about them. As far as I can make out, he\nwill, sooner or later, be elected deputy for the Bouches-du-Rhone; in\nthe Chamber he is sure to come to the front, for you can always count on\nme to promote your interests. The sufferings of his exile have given him\nthat calm and dignified air which goes half-way, in my opinion, to\nmake a politician. For the whole art of politics, dear, seems to me to\nconsist in looking serious. At this rate, Macumer, as I told him, ought\ncertainly to have a high position in the state.\n\nAnd so, having completely satisfied myself of your happiness, I fly off\ncontented to my dear Chantepleurs, where Felipe must really achieve his\naspirations. I have made up my mind not to receive you there without a\nfine baby at my breast to match yours.\n\nOh! I know very well I deserve all the epithets you can hurl at me. I am\na fool, a wretch, an idiot. Alas! that is just what jealousy means. I\nam not vexed with you, but I was miserable, and you will forgive me\nfor escaping from my misery. Two days more, and I should have made\nan exhibition of myself; yes, there would have been an outbreak of\nvulgarity.\n\nBut in spite of the rage gnawing at my heart, I am glad to have come,\nglad to have seen you in the pride of your beautiful motherhood, my\nfriend still, as I remain yours in all the absorption of my love. Why,\neven here at Marseilles, only a step from your door, I begin to feel\nproud of you and of the splendid mother that you will make.\n\nHow well you judged your vocation! You seem to me born for the part of\nmother rather than of lover, exactly as the reverse is true of me. There\nare women capable of neither, hard-favored or silly women. A good mother\nand a passionately loving wife have this in common, that they both need\nintelligence and discretion ever at hand, and an unfailing command of\nevery womanly art and grace. Oh! I watched you well; need I add, sly\npuss, that I admired you too! Your children will be happy, but not\nspoilt, with your tenderness lapping them round and the clear light of\nyour reason playing softly on them.\n\nTell Louis the truth about my going away, but find some decent\nexcuse for your father-in-law, who seems to act as steward for the\nestablishment; and be careful to do the same for your family--a true\nProvencal version of the Harlowe family. Felipe does not know why I\nleft, and he will never know. If he asks, I shall contrive to find some\ncolorable pretext, probably that you were jealous of me! Forgive me this\nlittle conventional fib.\n\nGood-bye. I write in haste, as I want you to get this at lunch-time;\nand the postilion, who has undertaken to convey it to you, is here,\nrefreshing himself while he waits.\n\nMany kisses to my dear little godson. Be sure you come to Chantepleurs\nin October. I shall be alone there all the time that Macumer is away\nin Sardinia, where he is designing great improvements in his estate. At\nleast that is his plan for the moment, and his pet vanity consists in\nhaving a plan. Then he feels that he has a will of his own, and this\nmakes him very uneasy when he unfolds it to me. Good-bye!\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI. THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER\n\nDear,--no words can express the astonishment of all our party when, at\nluncheon, we were told that you had both gone, and, above all, when the\npostilion who took you to Marseilles handed me your mad letter. Why,\nnaughty child, it was of your happiness, and nothing else, that made the\ntheme of those talks below the rock, on the \"Louise\" seat, and you had\nnot the faintest justification for objecting to them. _Ingrata!_ My\nsentence on you is that you return here at my first summons. In that\nhorrid letter, scribbled on the inn paper, you did not tell me\nwhat would be your next stopping place; so I must address this to\nChantepleurs.\n\nListen to me, dear sister of my heart. Know first, that my mind is set\non your happiness. Your husband, dear Louise, commands respect, not only\nby his natural gravity and dignified expression, but also because he\nsomehow impresses one with the splendid power revealed in his piquant\nplainness and in the fire of his velvet eyes; and you will understand\nthat it was some little time before I could meet him on those easy terms\nwhich are almost necessary for intimate conversation. Further, this man\nhas been Prime Minister, and he idolizes you; whence it follows that he\nmust be a profound dissembler. To fish up secrets, therefore, from the\nrocky caverns of this diplomatic soul is a work demanding a skilful hand\nno less than a ready brain. Nevertheless, I succeeded at last, without\nrousing my victim's suspicions, in discovering many things of which you,\nmy pet, have no conception.\n\nYou know that, between us two, my part is rather that of reason, yours\nof imagination: I personify sober duty, you reckless love. It has\npleased fate to continue in our lives this contrast in character\nwhich was imperceptible to all except ourselves. I am a simple country\nvicountess, very ambitious, and making it her task to lead her family on\nthe road to prosperity. On the other hand, Macumer, late Duc de Soria,\nhas a name in the world, and you, a duchess by right, reign in Paris,\nwhere reigning is no easy matter even for kings. You have a considerable\nfortune, which will be doubled if Macumer carries out his projects for\ndeveloping his great estates in Sardinia, the resources of which are\nmatter of common talk at Marseilles. Deny, if you can, that if either\nhas the right to be jealous, it is not you. But, thank God, we have\nboth hearts generous enough to place our friendship beyond reach of such\nvulgar pettiness.\n\nI know you, dear; I know that, ere now, you are ashamed of having fled.\nBut don't suppose that your flight will save you from a single word of\ndiscourse which I had prepared for your benefit to-day beneath the rock.\nRead carefully then, I beg of you, what I say, for it concerns you even\nmore closely than Macumer, though he also enters largely into my sermon.\n\nFirstly, my dear, you do not love him. Before two years are over, you\nwill be sick of adoration. You will never look on Felipe as a husband;\nto you he will always be the lover whom you can play with, for that\nis how all women treat their lovers. You do not look up to him, or\nreverence, or worship him as a woman should the god of her idolatry. You\nsee, I have made a study of love, my sweet, and more than once have I\ntaken soundings in the depth of my own heart. Now, as the result of a\ncareful diagnosis of your case, I can say with confidence, this is not\nlove.\n\nYes, dear Queen of Paris, you cannot escape the destiny of all queens.\nThe day will come when you long to be treated as a light-o'-love, to\nbe mastered and swept off your feet by a strong man, one who will not\nprostrate himself in adoration before you, but will seize your arm\nroughly in a fit of jealousy. Macumer loves you too fondly ever to be\nable either to resist you or find fault with you. A single glance from\nyou, a single coaxing word, would melt his sternest resolution. Sooner\nor later, you will learn to scorn this excessive devotion. He spoils\nyou, alas! just as I used to spoil you at the convent, for you are a\nmost bewitching woman, and there is no escaping your siren-like charms.\n\nWorse than all, you are candid, and it often happens that our happiness\ndepends on certain social hypocrisies to which you will never stoop. For\ninstance, society will not tolerate a frank display of the wife's power\nover her husband. The convention is that a man must no more show himself\nthe lover of his wife, however passionately he adores her, than a\nmarried woman may play the part of a mistress. This rule you both\ndisregard.\n\nIn the first place, my child, from what you have yourself told me, it\nis clear that the one unpardonable sin in society is to be happy. If\nhappiness exists, no one must know of it. But this is a small point.\nWhat seems to me important is that the perfect equality which reigns\nbetween lovers ought never to appear in the case of husband and wife,\nunder pain of undermining the whole fabric of society and entailing\nterrible disasters. If it is painful to see a man whom nature has made a\nnonentity, how much worse is the spectacle of a man of parts brought\nto that position? Before very long you will have reduced Macumer to the\nmere shadow of a man. He will cease to have a will and character of his\nown, and become mere clay in your hands. You will have so completely\nmoulded him to your likeness, that your household will consist of only\none person instead of two, and that one necessarily imperfect. You will\nregret it bitterly; but when at last you deign to open your eyes, the\nevil will be past cure. Do what we will, women do not, and never\nwill, possess the qualities which are characteristic of men, and these\nqualities are absolutely indispensable to family life. Already Macumer,\nblinded though he is, has a dim foreshadowing of this future; he feels\nhimself less a man through his love. His visit to Sardinia is a proof to\nme that he hopes by this temporary separation to succeed in recovering\nhis old self.\n\nYou never scruple to use the power which his love has placed in your\nhand. Your position of vantage may be read in a gesture, a look, a tone.\nOh! darling, how truly are you the mad wanton your mother called you!\nYou do not question, I fancy, that I am greatly Louis' superior. Well,\nI would ask you, have you ever heard me contradict him? Am I not always,\nin the presence of others, the wife who respects in him the authority of\nthe family? Hypocrisy! you will say. Well, listen to me. It is true that\nif I want to give him any advice which I think may be of use to him, I\nwait for the quiet and seclusion of our bedroom to explain what I\nthink and wish; but, I assure you, sweetheart, that even there I never\narrogate to myself the place of mentor. If I did not remain in private\nthe same submissive wife that I appear to others, he would lose\nconfidence in himself. Dear, the good we do to others is spoilt unless\nwe efface ourselves so completely that those we help have no sense of\ninferiority. There is a wonderful sweetness in these hidden sacrifices,\nand what a triumph for me in your unsuspecting praises of Louis! There\ncan be no doubt also that the happiness, the comfort, the hope of the\nlast two years have restored what misfortune, hardship, solitude, and\ndespondency has robbed him of.\n\nThis, then, is the sum-total of my observations. At the present moment\nyou love in Felipe, not your husband, but yourself. There is truth in\nyour father's words; concealed by the spring-flowers of your passion\nlies all the great lady's selfishness. Ah! my child, how I must love you\nto speak such bitter truths!\n\nLet me tell you, if you will promise never to breathe a word of this\nto the Baron, the end of our talk. We had been singing your praises\nin every key, for he soon discovered that I loved you like a\nfondly-cherished sister, and having insensibly brought him to a\nconfidential mood, I ventured to say:\n\n\"Louise has never yet had to struggle with life. She has been the spoilt\nchild of fortune, and she might yet have to pay for this were you not\nthere to act the part of father as well as lover.\"\n\n\"Ah! but is it possible?...\" He broke off abruptly, like a man who sees\nhimself on the edge of a precipice. But the exclamation was enough for\nme. No doubt, if you had stayed, he would have spoken more freely later.\n\nMy sweet, think of the day awaiting you when your husband's strength\nwill be exhausted, when pleasure will have turned to satiety, and he\nsees himself, I will not say degraded, but shorn of his proper dignity\nbefore you. The stings of conscience will then waken a sort of remorse\nin him, all the more painful for you, because you will feel yourself\nresponsible, and you will end by despising the man whom you have not\naccustomed yourself to respect. Remember, too, that scorn with a woman\nis only the earliest phase of hatred. You are too noble and generous, I\nknow, ever to forget the sacrifices which Felipe has made for you; but\nwhat further sacrifices will be left for him to make when he has, so to\nspeak, served up himself at the first banquet? Woe to the man, as to\nthe woman, who has left no desire unsatisfied! All is over then. To our\nshame or our glory--the point is too nice for me to decide--it is of\nlove alone that women are insatiable.\n\nOh! Louise, change yet, while there is still time. If you would only\nadopt the same course with Macumer that I have done with l'Estorade, you\nmight rouse the sleeping lion in your husband, who is made of the stuff\nof heroes. One might almost say that you grudge him his greatness.\nWould you feel no pride in using your power for other ends than your own\ngratification, in awakening the genius of a gifted man, as I in raising\nto a higher level one of merely common parts?\n\nHad you remained with us, I should still have written this letter, for\nin talking you might have cut me short or got the better of me with your\nsharp tongue. But I know that you will read this thoughtfully and weigh\nmy warnings. Dear heart, you have everything in life to make you happy,\ndo not spoil your chances; return to Paris, I entreat you, as soon\nas Macumer comes back. The engrossing claims of society, of which I\ncomplained, are necessary for both of you; otherwise you would spend\nyour life in mutual self-absorption. A married woman ought not to be too\nlavish of herself. The mother of a family, who never gives her household\nan opportunity of missing her, runs the risk of palling on them. If I\nhave several children, as I trust for my own sake I may, I assure you I\nshall make a point of reserving to myself certain hours which shall\nbe held sacred; even to one's children one's presence should not be a\nmatter of daily bread.\n\nFarewell, my dear jealous soul! Do you know that many women would be\nhighly flattered at having roused this passing pang in you? Alas! I can\nonly mourn, for what is not mother in me is your dear friend. A thousand\nloves. Make what excuse you will for leaving; if you are not sure of\nMacumer, I am of Louis.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE Genoa.\n\nMy beloved beauty,--I was bitten with the fancy to see something of\nItaly, and I am delighted at having carried off Macumer, whose plans in\nregard to Sardinia are postponed.\n\nThis country is simple ravishing. The churches--above all, the\nchapels--have a seductive, bewitching air, which must make every female\nProtestant yearn after Catholicism. Macumer has been received with\nacclamation, and they are all delighted to have made an Italian of so\ndistinguished a man. Felipe could have the Sardinian embassy at Paris if\nI cared about it, for I am made much of at court.\n\nIf you write, address your letters to Florence. I have not time now\nto go into any details, but I will tell you the story of our travels\nwhenever you come to Paris. We only remain here a week, and then go on\nto Florence, taking Leghorn on the way. We shall stay a month in Tuscany\nand a month at Naples, so as to reach Rome in November. Thence we return\nhome by Venice, where we shall spend the first fortnight of December,\nand arrive in Paris, _via_ Milan and Turin, for January.\n\nOur journey is a perfect honeymoon; the sight of new places gives fresh\nlife to our passion. Macumer did not know Italy at all, and we have\nbegun with that splendid Cornice road, which might be the work of fairy\narchitects.\n\nGood-bye, darling. Don't be angry if I don't write. It is impossible\nto get a minute to oneself in traveling; my whole time is taken up with\nseeing, admiring, and realizing my impressions. But not a word to you of\nthese till memory has given them their proper atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII. THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER\nSeptember.\n\nMy dear,--There is lying for you at Chantepleurs a full reply to the\nletter you wrote me from Marseilles. This honeymoon journey, so far from\ndiminishing the fears I there expressed, makes me beg of you to get my\nletter sent on from Nivernais.\n\nThe Government, it is said, are resolved on dissolution. This is unlucky\nfor the Crown, since the last session of this loyal Parliament would\nhave been devoted to the passing of laws, essential to the consolidation\nof its power; and it is not less so for us, as Louis will not be forty\ntill the end of 1827. Fortunately, however, my father has agreed to\nstand, and he will resign his seat when the right moment arrives.\n\nYour godson has found out how to walk without his godmother's help. He\nis altogether delicious, and begins to make the prettiest little signs\nto me, which bring home to one that here is really a thinking being, not\na mere animal or sucking machine. His smiles are full of meaning. I have\nbeen so successful in my profession of nurse that I shall wean Armand in\nDecember. A year at the breast is quite enough; children who are suckled\nlonger are said to grow stupid, and I am all for popular sayings.\n\nYou must make a tremendous sensation in Italy, my fair one with the\ngolden locks. A thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nYour atrocious letter has reached me here, the steward having forwarded\nit by my orders. Oh! Renee... but I will spare you the outburst of my\nwounded feelings, and simply tell you the effect your letter produced.\n\nWe had just returned from a delightful reception given in our honor\nby the ambassador, where I appeared in all my glory, and Macumer was\ncompletely carried away in a frenzy of love which I could not describe.\nThen I read him your horrible answer to my letter, and I read it\nsobbing, at the risk of making a fright of myself. My dear Arab fell at\nmy feet, declaring that you raved. Then he carried me off to the balcony\nof the palace where we are staying, from which we have a view over\npart of the city; there he spoke to me words worthy of the magnificent\nmoonlight scene which lay stretched before us. We both speak Italian\nnow, and his love, told in that voluptuous tongue, so admirably adapted\nto the expression of passion, sounded in my ears like the most exquisite\npoetry. He swore that, even were you right in your predictions, he\nwould not exchange for a lifetime a single one of our blessed nights\nor charming mornings. At this reckoning he has already lived a thousand\nyears. He is content to have me for his mistress, and would claim\nno other title than that of lover. So proud and pleased is he to see\nhimself every day the chosen of my heart, that were Heaven to offer\nhim the alternative between living as you would have us to for another\nthirty years with five children, and five years spent amid the dear\nroses of our love, he would not hesitate. He would take my love, such as\nit is, and death.\n\nWhile he was whispering this in my ear, his arm round me, my head\nresting on his shoulder, the cries of a bat, surprised by an owl,\ndisturbed us. This death-cry struck me with such terror that Felipe\ncarried me half-fainting to my bed. But don't be alarmed! Though\nthis augury of evil still resounds in my soul, I am quite myself this\nmorning. As soon as I was up, I went to Felipe, and, kneeling before\nhim, my eyes fixed on his, his hands clasped in mine, I said to him:--\n\n\"My love, I am a child, and Renee may be right after all. It may be only\nyour love that I love in you; but at least I can assure you that this\nis the one feeling of my heart, and that I love you as it is given me to\nlove. But if there be aught in me, in my lightest thought or deed, which\njars on your wishes or conception of me, I implore you to tell me, to\nsay what it is. It will be a joy to me to hear you and to take your eyes\nas the guiding-stars of my life. Renee has frightened me, for she is a\ntrue friend.\"\n\nMacumer could not find voice to reply, tears choked him.\n\nI can thank you now, Renee. But for your letter I should not have known\nthe depths of love in my noble, kingly Macumer. Rome is the city of\nlove; it is there that passion should celebrate its feast, with art and\nreligion as confederates.\n\nAt Venice we shall find the Duc and Duchesse de Soria. If you write,\naddress now to Paris, for we shall leave Rome in three days. The\nambassador's was a farewell party.\n\nP. S.--Dear, silly child, your letter only shows that you knew nothing\nof love, except theoretically. Learn then that love is a quickening\nforce which may produce fruits so diverse that no theory can embrace or\nco-ordinate them. A word this for my little Professor with her armor of\nstays.\n\n\n\n\nXL. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER January 1827.\n\nMy father has been elected to the Chamber, my father-in-law is dead, and\nI am on the point of my second confinement; these are the chief events\nmarking the end of the year for us. I mention them at once, lest the\nsight of the black seal should frighten you.\n\nMy dear, your letter from Rome made my flesh creep. You are nothing but\na pair of children. Felipe is either a dissembling diplomat or else his\nlove for you is the love a man might have for a courtesan, on whom he\nsquanders his all, knowing all the time that she is false to him. Enough\nof this. You say I rave, so I had better hold my tongue. Only this would\nI say, from the comparison of our two very different destinies I draw\nthis harsh moral--Love not if you would be loved.\n\nMy dear, when Louis was elected to the provincial Council, he received\nthe cross of the Legion of Honor. That is now nearly three years ago;\nand as my father--whom you will no doubt see in Paris during the course\nof the session--has asked the rank of Officer of the Legion for his\nson-in-law, I want to know if you will do me the kindness to take in\nhand the bigwig, whoever he may be, to whom this patronage belongs, and\nto keep an eye upon the little affair. But, whatever you do, don't get\nentangled in the concerns of my honored father. The Comte de Maucombe\nis fishing for the title of Marquis for himself; but keep your good\nservices for me, please. When Louis is a deputy--next winter that is--we\nshall come to Paris, and then we will move heaven and earth to get\nsome Government appointment for him, so that we may be able to save our\nincome by living on his salary. My father sits between the centre and\nthe right; a title will content him. Our family was distinguished\neven in the days of King Rene, and Charles X. will hardly say no to a\nMaucombe; but what I fear is that my father may take it into his head to\nask some favor for my younger brother. Now, if the marquisate is dangled\nout of his reach, he will have no thoughts to spare from himself.\n\nJanuary 15th.\n\nAh! Louise, I have been in hell. If I can bear to tell you of my\nanguish, it is because you are another self; even so, I don't know\nwhether I shall ever be able to live again in thought those five ghastly\ndays. The mere word \"convulsions\" makes my very heart sick. Five days!\nto me they were five centuries of torture. A mother who has not been\nthrough this martyrdom does not know what suffering is. So frenzied was\nI that I even envied you, who never had a child!\n\nThe evening before that terrible day the weather was close, almost hot,\nand I thought my little Armand was affected by it. Generally so sweet\nand caressing, he was peevish, cried for nothing, wanted to play, and\nthen broke his toys. Perhaps this sort of fractiousness is the usual\nsign of approaching illness with children. While I was wondering about\nit, I noticed Armand's cheeks flush, but this I set down to teething,\nfor he is cutting four large teeth at once. So I put him to bed beside\nme, and kept constantly waking through the night. He was a little\nfeverish, but not enough to make me uneasy, my mind being still full of\nthe teething. Towards morning he cried \"Mamma!\" and asked by signs for\nsomething to drink; but the cry was spasmodic, and there were convulsive\ntwitchings in the limbs, which turned me to ice. I jumped out of bed to\nfetch him a drink. Imagine my horror when, on my handing him the cup, he\nremained motionless, only repeating \"Mamma!\" in that strange, unfamiliar\nvoice, which was indeed by this time hardly a voice at all. I took his\nhand, but it did not respond to my pressure; it was quite stiff. I put\nthe cup to his lips; the poor little fellow gulped down three or four\nmouthfuls in a convulsive manner that was terrible to see, and the water\nmade a strange sound in his throat. He clung to me desperately, and I\nsaw his eyes roll, as though some hidden force within were pulling at\nthem, till only the whites were visible; his limbs were turning rigid. I\nscreamed aloud, and Louis came.\n\n\"A doctor! quick!... he is dying,\" I cried.\n\nLouis vanished, and my poor Armand again gasped, \"Mamma! Mamma!\" The\nnext moment he lost all consciousness of his mother's existence. The\npretty veins on his forehead swelled, and the convulsions began. For a\nwhole hour before the doctors came, I held in my arms that merry baby,\nall lilies and roses, the blossom of my life, my pride, and my joy,\nlifeless as a piece of wood; and his eyes! I cannot think of them\nwithout horror. My pretty Armand was a mere mummy--black, shriveled,\nmisshapen.\n\nA doctor, two doctors, brought from Marseilles by Louis, hovered about\nlike birds of ill omen; it made me shudder to look at them. One spoke of\nbrain fever, the other saw nothing but an ordinary case of convulsions\nin infancy. Our own country doctor seemed to me to have the most\nsense, for he offered no opinion. \"It's teething,\" said the second\ndoctor.--\"Fever,\" said the first. Finally it was agreed to put leeches\non his neck and ice on his head. It seemed to me like death. To look on,\nto see a corpse, all purple or black, and not a cry, not a movement from\nthis creature but now so full of life and sound--it was horrible!\n\nAt one moment I lost my head, and gave a sort of hysterical laugh, as I\nsaw the pretty neck which I used to devour with kisses, with the leeches\nfeeding on it, and his darling head in a cap of ice. My dear, we had\nto cut those lovely curls, of which we were so proud and with which\nyou used to play, in order to make room for the ice. The convulsions\nreturned every ten minutes with the regularity of labor pains, and then\nthe poor baby writhed and twisted, now white, now violet. His supple\nlimbs clattered like wood as they struck. And this unconscious flesh\nwas the being who smiled and prattled, and used to say Mamma! At the\nthought, a storm of agony swept tumultuously over my soul, like the\nsea tossing in a hurricane. It seemed as though every tie which binds\na child to its mother's heart was strained to rending. My mother, who\nmight have given me help, advice, or comfort, was in Paris. Mothers, it\nis my belief, know more than doctors do about convulsions.\n\nAfter four days and nights of suspense and fear, which almost killed\nme, the doctors were unanimous in advising the application of a horrid\nointment, which would produce open sores. Sores on my Armand! who only\nfive days before was playing about, and laughing, and trying to say\n\"Godmother!\" I would not have it done, preferring to trust in nature.\nLouis, who believes in doctors, scolded me. A man remains the same\nthrough everything. But there are moments when this terrible disease\ntakes the likeness of death, and in one of these it seemed borne in upon\nme that this hateful remedy was the salvation of Armand. Louise, the\nskin was so dry, so rough and parched, that the ointment would not act.\nThen I broke into weeping, and my tears fell so long and so fast, that\nthe bedside was wet through. And the doctors were at dinner!\n\nSeeing myself alone with the child, I stripped him of all medical\nappliances, and seizing him like a mad woman, pressed him to my bosom,\nlaying my forehead against his, and beseeching God to grant him the life\nwhich I was striving to pass into his veins from mine. For some minutes\nI held him thus, longing to die with him, so that neither life nor death\nmight part us. Dear, I felt the limbs relaxing; the writhings ceased,\nthe child stirred, and the ghastly, corpselike tints faded away! I\nscreamed, just as I did when he was taken ill; the doctors hurried up,\nand I pointed to Armand.\n\n\"He is saved!\" exclaimed the oldest of them.\n\nWhat music in those words! The gates of heaven opened! And, in fact, two\nhours later Armand came back to life; but I was utterly crushed, and it\nwas only the healing power of joy which saved me from a serious illness.\nMy God! by what tortures do you bind a mother to her child! To fasten\nhim to our heart, need the nails be driven into the very quick? Was\nI not mother enough before? I, who wept tears of joy over his broken\nsyllables and tottering steps, who spent hours together planning how\nbest to perform my duty, and fit myself for the sweet post of mother?\nWhy these horrors, these ghastly scenes, for a mother who already\nidolized her child?\n\nAs I write, our little Armand is playing, shouting, laughing. What can\nbe the cause of this terrible disease with children? Vainly do I try to\npuzzle it out, remembering that I am again with child. Is it teething?\nIs it some peculiar process in the brain? Is there something wrong with\nthe nervous system of children who are subject to convulsions? All these\nthoughts disquiet me, in view alike of the present and the future.\nOur country doctor holds to the theory of nervous trouble produced by\nteething. I would give every tooth in my head to see little Armand's all\nthrough. The sight of one of those little white pearls peeping out of\nthe swollen gum brings a cold sweat over me now. The heroism with which\nthe little angel bore his sufferings proves to me that he will be his\nmother's son. A look from him goes to my very heart.\n\nMedical science can give no satisfactory explanation as to the origin\nof this sort of tetanus, which passes off as rapidly as it comes on, and\ncan apparently be neither guarded against nor cured. One thing alone, as\nI said before, is certain, that it is hell for a mother to see her child\nin convulsions. How passionately do I clasp him to my heart! I could\nwalk for ever with him in my arms!\n\nTo have suffered all this only six weeks before my confinement made it\nmuch worse; I feared for the coming child. Farewell, my dear beloved.\nDon't wish for a child--there is the sum and substance of my letter!\n\n\n\n\nXLI. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE Paris.\n\nPoor sweet,--Macumer and I forgave you all your naughtiness when we\nheard of your terrible trouble. I thrilled with pain as I read the\ndetails of the double agony, and there seem compensations now in being\nchildless.\n\nI am writing at once to tell you that Louis has been promoted. He can\nnow wear the ribbon of an officer of the Legion. You are a lucky woman,\nRenee, and you will probably have a little girl, since that used to be\nyour wish!\n\nThe marriage of my brother with Mlle. de Mortsauf was celebrated on our\nreturn. Our gracious King, who really is extraordinarily kind, has given\nmy brother the reversion of the post of first gentleman of the chamber,\nwhich his father-in-law now fills, on the one condition that the\nscutcheon of the Mortsaufs should be placed side by side with that of\nthe Lenoncourts.\n\n\"The office ought to go with the title,\" he said to the Duc de\nLenoncourt-Givry.\n\nMy father is justified a hundred-fold. Without the help of my fortune\nnothing of all this could have taken place. My father and mother came\nfrom Madrid for the wedding, and return there, after the reception which\nI give to-morrow for the bride and bridegroom.\n\nThe carnival will be a very gay one. The Duc and Duchesse de Soria are\nin Paris, and their presence makes me a little uneasy. Marie Heredia is\ncertainly one of the most beautiful women in Europe, and I don't like\nthe way Felipe looks at her. Therefore I am doubly lavish of sweetness\nand caresses. Every look and gesture speak the words which I am careful\nmy lips should not utter, \"_She_ could not love like this!\" Heaven knows\nhow lovely and fascinating I am! Yesterday Mme. de Maufrigneuse said to\nme:\n\n\"Dear child, who can compete with you?\"\n\nThen I keep Felipe so well amused, that his sister-in-law must seem as\nlively as a Spanish cow in comparison. I am the less sorry that a little\nAbencerrage is not on his way, because the Duchess will no doubt stay in\nParis over her confinement, and she won't be a beauty any longer. If\nthe baby is a boy, it will be called Felipe, in honor of the exile.\nAn unkind chance has decreed that I shall, a second time, serve as\ngodmother.\n\nGood-bye, dear, I shall go to Chantepleurs early this year, for our\nItalian tour was shockingly expensive. I shall leave about the end\nof March, and retire to economize in Nivenais. Besides, I am tired of\nParis. Felipe sighs, as I do, after the beautiful quiet of the park, our\ncool meadows, and our Loire, with its sparkling sands, peerless among\nrivers. Chantepleurs will seem delightful to me after the pomps and\nvanities of Italy; for, after all, splendor becomes wearisome, and a\nlover's glance has more beauty than a _capo d'opera_ or a _bel quadro_!\n\nWe shall expect you there. Don't be afraid that I shall be jealous\nagain. You are free to take what soundings you please in Macumer's\nheart, and fish up all the interjections and doubts you can. I am\nsupremely indifferent. Since that day at Rome Felipe's love for me has\ngrown. He told me yesterday (he is looking over my shoulder now) that\nhis sister-in-law, the Princess Heredia, his destined bride of old,\nthe dream of his youth, had no brains. Oh! my dear, I am worse than a\nballet-dancer! If you knew what joy that slighting remark gave me! I\nhave pointed out to Felipe that she does not speak French correctly. She\nsays _esemple_ for _exemple_, _sain_ for _cinq_, _cheu_ for _je_. She is\nbeautiful of course, but quite without charm or the slightest scintilla\nof wit. When a compliment is paid her, she looks at you as though she\ndidn't know what to do with such a strange thing. Felipe, being what he\nis, could not have lived two months with Marie after his marriage.\nDon Fernand, the Duc de Soria, suits her very well. He has generous\ninstincts, but it's easy to see he has been a spoilt child. I am tempted\nto be naughty and make you laugh; but I won't draw the long bow. Ever so\nmuch love, darling.\n\n\n\n\nXLII. RENEE TO LOUISE\n\nMy little girl is two months old. She is called Jeanne-Athenais, and has\nfor godmother and godfather my mother, and an old grand-uncle of Louis'.\n\nAs soon as I possibly can, I shall start for my visit to Chantepleurs,\nsince you are not afraid of a nursing mother. Your godson can say your\nname now; he calls it _Matoumer_, for he can't say _c_ properly. You\nwill be quite delighted with him. He has got all his teeth, and eats\nmeat now like a big boy; he is all over the place, trotting about like\na little mouse; but I watch him all the time with anxious eyes, and it\nmakes me miserable that I cannot keep him by me when I am laid up. The\ntime is more than usually long with me, as the doctors consider some\nspecial precautions necessary. Alas! my child, habit does not inure one\nto child-bearing. There are the same old discomforts and misgivings.\nHowever (don't show this to Felipe), this little girl takes after me,\nand she may yet cut out your Armand.\n\nMy father thought Felipe looking very thin, and my dear pet also not\nquite so blooming. Yet the Duc and Duchesse de Soria have gone; not a\nloophole for jealousy is left! Is there any trouble which you are hiding\nfrom me? Your letter is neither so long nor so full of loving thoughts\nas usual. Is this only a whim of my dear whimsical friend?\n\nI am running on too long. My nurse is angry with me for writing, and\nMlle. Athenais de l'Estorade wants her dinner. Farewell, then; write me\nsome nice long letters.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nFor the first time in my life, my dear Renee, I have been alone and\ncrying. I was sitting under a willow, on a wooden bench by the side of\nthe long Chantepleurs marsh. The view there is charming, but it needs\nsome merry children to complete it, and I wait for you. I have been\nmarried nearly three years, and no child! The thought of your quiver\nfull drove me to explore my heart.\n\nAnd this is what I find there. \"Oh! if I had to suffer a hundred-fold\nwhat Renee suffered when my godson was born; if I had to see my child in\nconvulsions, even so would to God that I might have a cherub of my own,\nlike your Athenais!\" I can see her from here in my mind's eye, and\nI know she is beautiful as the day, for you tell me nothing about\nher--that is just like my Renee! I believe you divine my trouble.\n\nEach time my hopes are disappointed, I fall a prey for some days to the\nblackest melancholy. Then I compose sad elegies. When shall I embroider\nlittle caps and sew lace edgings to encircle a tiny head? When choose\nthe cambric for the baby-clothes? Shall I never hear baby lips shout\n\"Mamma,\" and have my dress pulled by a teasing despot whom my heart\nadores? Are there to be no wheelmarks of a little carriage on the\ngravel, no broken toys littered about the courtyard? Shall I never visit\nthe toy-shops, as mothers do, to buy swords, and dolls, and baby-houses?\nAnd will it never be mine to watch the unfolding of a precious\nlife--another Felipe, only more dear? I would have a son, if only to\nlearn how a lover can be more to one in his second self.\n\nMy park and castle are cold and desolate to me. A childless woman is\na monstrosity of nature; we exist only to be mothers. Oh! my sage in\nwoman's livery, how well you have conned the book of life! Everywhere,\ntoo, barrenness is a dismal thing. My life is a little too much like\none of Gessner's or Florian's sheepfolds, which Rivarol longed to see\ninvaded by a wolf. I too have it in me to make sacrifices! There are\nforces in me, I feel, which Felipe has no use for; and if I am not to be\na mother, I must be allowed to indulge myself in some romantic sorrow.\n\nI have just made this remark to my belated Moor, and it brought tears\nto his eyes. He cannot stand any joking on his love, so I let him off\neasily, and only called him a paladin of folly.\n\nAt times I am seized with a desire to go on pilgrimage, to bear my\nlongings to the shrine of some madonna or to a watering-place. Next\nwinter I shall take medical advice. I am too much enraged with myself to\nwrite more. Good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nXLIV. THE SAME TO THE SAME Paris, 1829.\n\nA whole year passed, my dear, without a letter! What does this mean? I\nam a little hurt. Do you suppose that your Louis, who comes to see me\nalmost every alternate day, makes up for you? It is not enough to know\nthat you are well and that everything prospers with you; for I love you,\nRenee, and I want to know what you are feeling and thinking of, just as\nI say everything to you, at the risk of being scolded, or censured, or\nmisunderstood. Your silence and seclusion in the country, at the time\nwhen you might be in Paris enjoying all the Parliamentary honors of\nthe Comte de l'Estorade, cause me serious anxiety. You know that your\nhusband's \"gift of gab\" and unsparing zeal have won for him quite a\nposition here, and he will doubtless receive some very good post when\nthe session is over. Pray, do you spend your life writing him letters of\nadvice? Numa was not so far removed from his Egeria.\n\nWhy did you not take this opportunity of seeing Paris? I might have\nenjoyed your company for four months. Louis told me yesterday that\nyou were coming to fetch him, and would have your third confinement in\nParis--you terrible mother Gigogne! After bombarding Louis with queries,\nexclamations, and regrets, I at last defeated his strategy so far as to\ndiscover that his grand-uncle, the godfather of Athenais, is very ill.\nNow I believe that you, like a careful mother, would be quite equal to\nangling with the member's speeches and fame for a fat legacy from your\nhusband's last remaining relative on the mother's side. Keep your mind\neasy, my Renee--we are all at work for Louis, Lenoncourts, Chaulieus,\nand the whole band of Mme. de Macumer's followers. Martignac will\nprobably put him into the audit department. But if you won't tell me why\nyou bury yourself in the country, I shall be cross.\n\nTell me, are you afraid that the political wisdom of the house of\nl'Estorade should seem to centre in you? Or is it the uncle's legacy?\nPerhaps you were afraid you would be less to your children in Paris? Ah!\nwhat I would give to know whether, after all, you were not simply\ntoo vain to show yourself in Paris for the first time in your present\ncondition! Vain thing! Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nXLV. RENEE TO LOUISE\n\nYou complain of my silence; have you forgotten, then, those two little\nbrown heads, at once my subjects and my tyrants? And as to staying at\nhome, you have yourself hit upon several of my reasons. Apart from the\ncondition of our dear uncle, I didn't want to drag with me to Paris a\nboy of four and a little girl who will soon be three, when I am again\nexpecting my confinement. I had no intention of troubling you and\nupsetting your husband with such a party. I did not care to appear,\nlooking my worst, in the brilliant circle over which you preside, and I\ndetest life in hotels and lodgings.\n\nWhen I come to spend the session in Paris, it will be in my own house.\nLouis' uncle, when he heard of the rank his grand-nephew had received,\nmade me a present of two hundred thousand francs (the half of his\nsavings) with which to buy a house in Paris, and I have charged Louis\nto find one in your neighborhood. My mother has given me thirty thousand\nfrancs for the furnishing, and I shall do my best not to disgrace the\ndear sister of my election--no pun intended.\n\nI am grateful to you for having already done so much at Court for\nLouis. But though M. de Bourmont and M. de Polignac have paid him\nthe compliment of asking him to join their ministry, I do not wish so\nconspicuous a place for him. It would commit him too much; and I prefer\nthe Audit Office because it is permanent. Our affairs here are in very\ngood hands; so you need not fear; as soon as the steward has mastered\nthe details, I will come and support Louis.\n\nAs for writing long letters nowadays, how can I. This one, in which I\nwant to describe to you the daily routine of my life, will be a week on\nthe stocks. Who can tell but Armand may lay hold of it to make caps for\nhis regiments drawn up on my carpet, or vessels for the fleets which\nsail his bath! A single day will serve as a sample of the rest, for they\nare all exactly alike, and their characteristics reduce themselves to\ntwo--either the children are well, or they are not. For me, in this\nsolitary grange, it is no exaggeration to say that hours become minutes,\nor minutes hours, according to the children's health.\n\nIf I have some delightful hours, it is when they are asleep and I am no\nlonger needed to rock the one or soothe the other with stories. When I\nhave them sleeping by my side, I say to myself, \"Nothing can go wrong\nnow.\" The fact is, my sweet, every mother spends her time, so soon\nas her children are out of her sight, in imagining dangers for them.\nPerhaps it is Armand seizing the razors to play with, or his coat taking\nfire, or a snake biting him, or he might tumble in running and start\nan abscess on his head, or he might drown himself in a pond. A mother's\nlife, you see, is one long succession of dramas, now soft and tender,\nnow terrible. Not an hour but has its joys and fears.\n\nBut at night, in my room, comes the hour for waking dreams, when I plan\nout their future, which shines brightly in the smile of the guardian\nangel, watching over their beds. Sometimes Armand calls me in his sleep;\nI kiss his forehead (without rousing him), then his sister's feet,\nand watch them both lying in their beauty. These are my merry-makings!\nYesterday, it must have been our guardian angel who roused me in the\nmiddle of the night and summoned me in fear to Athenais' cradle. Her\nhead was too low, and I found Armand all uncovered, his feet purple with\ncold.\n\n\"Darling mother!\" he cried, rousing up and flinging his arms round me.\n\nThere, dear, is one of our night scenes for you.\n\nHow important it is for a mother to have her children by her side at\nnight! It is not for a nurse, however careful she may be, to take\nthem up, comfort them, and hush them to sleep again, when some horrid\nnightmare has disturbed them. For they have their dreams, and the task\nof explaining away one of those dread visions of the night is the more\narduous because the child is scared, stupid, and only half awake. It is\na mere interlude in the unconsciousness of slumber. In this way I have\ncome to sleep so lightly, that I can see my little pair and see them\nstirring, through the veil of my eyelids. A sigh or a rustle wakens me.\nFor me, the demon of convulsions is ever crouching by their beds.\n\nSo much for the nights; with the first twitter of the birds my babies\nbegin to stir. Through the mists of dispersing sleep, their chatter\nblends with the warblings that fill the morning air, or with the\nswallows' noisy debates--little cries of joy or woe, which make their\nway to my heart rather than my ears. While Nais struggles to get at\nme, making the passage from her cradle to my bed on all fours or with\nstaggering steps, Armand climbs up with the agility of a monkey, and has\nhis arms round me. Then the merry couple turn my bed into a playground,\nwhere mother lies at their mercy. The baby-girl pulls my hair, and would\ntake to sucking again, while Armand stands guard over my breast,\nas though defending his property. Their funny ways, their peals of\nlaughter, are too much for me, and put sleep fairly to flight.\n\nThen we play the ogress game; mother ogress eats up the white, soft\nflesh with hugs, and rains kisses on those rosy shoulders and eyes\nbrimming over with saucy mischief; we have little jealous tiffs too, so\npretty to see. It has happened to me, dear, to take up my stockings at\neight o'clock and be still bare-footed at nine!\n\nThen comes the getting up. The operation of dressing begins. I slip on\nmy dressing-gown, turn up my sleeves, and don the mackintosh apron; with\nMary's assistance, I wash and scrub my two little blossoms. I am sole\narbiter of the temperature of the bath, for a good half of children's\ncrying and whimpering comes from mistakes here. The moment has arrived\nfor paper fleets and glass ducks, since the only way to get children\nthoroughly washed is to keep them well amused. If you knew the\ndiversions that have to be invented before these despotic sovereigns\nwill permit a soft sponge to be passed over every nook and cranny, you\nwould be awestruck at the amount of ingenuity and intelligence demanded\nby the maternal profession when one takes it seriously. Prayers,\nscoldings, promises, are alike in requisition; above all, the jugglery\nmust be so dexterous that it defies detection. The case would be\ndesperate had not Providence to the cunning of the child matched that\nof the mother. A child is a diplomatist, only to be mastered, like the\ndiplomatists of the great world, through his passions! Happily, it takes\nlittle to make these cherubs laugh; the fall of a brush, a piece of soap\nslipping from the hand, and what merry shouts! And if our triumphs are\ndearly bought, still triumphs they are, though hidden from mortal\neye. Even the father knows nothing of it all. None but God and His\nangels--and perhaps you--can fathom the glances of satisfaction which\nMary and I exchange when the little creatures' toilet is at last\nconcluded, and they stand, spotless and shining, amid a chaos of soap,\nsponges, combs, basins, blotting-paper, flannel, and all the nameless\nlitter of a true English \"nursery.\"\n\nFor I am so far a convert as to admit that English women have a talent\nfor this department. True, they look upon the child only from the point\nof view of material well-being; but where this is concerned, their\narrangements are admirable. My children must always be bare-legged and\nwear woollen socks. There shall be no swaddling nor bandages; on the\nother hand, they shall never be left alone. The helplessness of\nthe French infant in its swaddling-bands means the liberty of the\nnurse--that is the whole explanation. A mother, who is really a mother,\nis never free.\n\nThere is my answer to your question why I do not write. Besides the\nmanagement of the estate, I have the upbringing of two children on my\nhands.\n\nThe art of motherhood involves much silent, unobtrusive self-denial,\nan hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute. The soup warming\nbefore the fire must be watched. Am I the kind of woman, do you suppose,\nto shirk such cares? The humblest task may earn a rich harvest of\naffection. How pretty is a child's laugh when he finds the food to his\nliking! Armand has a way of nodding his head when he is pleased that\nis worth a lifetime of adoration. How could I leave to any one else the\nprivilege and delight, as well as the responsibility, of blowing on the\nspoonful of soup which is too hot for my little Nais, my nursling\nof seven months ago, who still remembers my breast? When a nurse has\nallowed a child to burn its tongue and lips with scalding food, she\ntells the mother, who hurries up to see what is wrong, that the child\ncried from hunger. How could a mother sleep in peace with the thought\nthat a breath, less pure than her own, has cooled her child's food--the\nmother whom Nature has made the direct vehicle of food to infant lips.\nTo mince a chop for Nais, who has just cut her last teeth, and mix the\nmeat, cooked to a turn, with potatoes, is a work of patience, and there\nare times, indeed, when none but a mother could succeed in making an\nimpatient child go through with its meal.\n\nNo number of servants, then, and no English nurse can dispense a mother\nfrom taking the field in person in that daily contest, where gentleness\nalone should grapple with the little griefs and pains of childhood.\nLouise, the care of these innocent darlings is a work to engage the\nwhole soul. To whose hand and eyes, but one's own, intrust the task of\nfeeding, dressing, and putting to bed? Broadly speaking, a crying child\nis the unanswerable condemnation of mother or nurse, except when the cry\nis the outcome of natural pain. Now that I have two to look after (and\na third on the road), they occupy all my thoughts. Even you, whom I love\nso dearly, have become a memory to me.\n\nMy own dressing is not always completed by two o'clock. I have no faith\nin mothers whose rooms are in apple-pie order, and who themselves might\nhave stepped out of a bandbox. Yesterday was one of those lovely days\nof early April, and I wanted to take my children for a walk, while I was\nstill able--for the warning bell is in my ears. Such an expedition is\nquite an epic to a mother! One dreams of it the night before! Armand was\nfor the first time to put on a little black velvet jacket, a new collar\nwhich I had worked, a Scotch cap with the Stuart colors and cock's\nfeathers; Nais was to be in white and pink, with one of those delicious\nlittle baby caps; for she is a baby still, though she will lose that\npretty title on the arrival of the impatient youngster, whom I call my\nbeggar, for he will have the portion of a younger son. (You see, Louise,\nthe child has already appeared to me in a vision, so I know it is a\nboy.)\n\nWell, caps, collars, jackets, socks, dainty little shoes, pink garters,\nthe muslin frock with silk embroidery,--all was laid out on my bed. Then\nthe little brown heads had to be brushed, twittering merrily all the\ntime like birds, answering each other's call. Armand's hair is in curls,\nwhile Nais' is brought forward softly on the forehead as a border to the\npink-and-white cap. Then the shoes are buckled; and when the little\nbare legs and well-shod feet have trotted off to the nursery, while\ntwo shining faces (_clean_, Mary calls them) and eyes ablaze with life\npetition me to start, my heart beats fast. To look on the children whom\none's own hand has arrayed, the pure skin brightly veined with blue,\nthat one has bathed, laved, and sponged and decked with gay colors of\nsilk or velvet--why, there is no poem comes near to it! With what eager,\ncovetous longing one calls them back for one more kiss on those white\nnecks, which, in their simple collars, the loveliest woman cannot rival.\nEven the coarsest lithograph of such a scene makes a mother pause, and I\nfeast my eyes daily on the living picture!\n\nOnce out of doors, triumphant in the result of my labors, while I was\nadmiring the princely air with which little Armand helped baby to totter\nalong the path you know, I saw a carriage coming, and tried to get them\nout of the way. The children tumbled into a dirty puddle, and lo! my\nworks of art are ruined! We had to take them back and change their\nthings. I took the little one in my arms, never thinking of my own\ndress, which was ruined, while Mary seized Armand, and the cavalcade\nre-entered. With a crying baby and a soaked child, what mind has a\nmother left for herself?\n\nDinner time arrives, and as a rule I have done nothing. Now comes the\nproblem which faces me twice every day--how to suffice in my own person\nfor two children, put on their bibs, turn up their sleeves, and get\nthem to eat. In the midst of these ever-recurring cares, joys, and\ncatastrophes, the only person neglected in the house is myself. If the\nchildren have been naughty, often I don't get rid of my curl-papers\nall day. Their tempers rule my toilet. As the price of a few minutes\nin which I write you these half-dozen pages, I have had to let them\ncut pictures out of my novels, build castles with books, chessmen, or\nmother-of-pearl counters, and give Nais my silks and wools to arrange\nin her own fashion, which, I assure you, is so complicated, that she is\nentirely absorbed in it, and has not uttered a word.\n\nYet I have nothing to complain of. My children are both strong and\nindependent; they amuse themselves more easily then you would think.\nThey find delight in everything; a guarded liberty is worth many toys.\nA few pebbles--pink, yellow, purple, and black, small shells, the\nmysteries of sand, are a world of pleasure to them. Their wealth\nconsists in possessing a multitude of small things. I watch Armand and\nfind him talking to the flowers, the flies, the chickens, and imitating\nthem. He is on friendly terms with insects, and never wearies of\nadmiring them. Everything which is on a minute scale interests them.\nArmand is beginning to ask the \"why\" of everything he sees. He has come\nto ask what I am saying to his godmother, whom he looks on as a fairy.\nStrange how children hit the mark!\n\nAlas! my sweet, I would not sadden you with the tale of my joys. Let me\ngive you some notion of your godson's character. The other day we were\nfollowed by a poor man begging--beggars soon find out that a mother with\nher child at her side can't resist them. Armand has no idea what hunger\nis, and money is a sealed book to him; but I have just bought him a\ntrumpet which had long been the object of his desires. He held it out to\nthe old man with a kingly air, saying:\n\n\"Here, take this!\"\n\nWhat joy the world can give would compare with such a moment?\n\n\"May I keep it?\" said the poor man to me. \"I too, madame, have had\nchildren,\" he added, hardly noticing the money I put into his hand.\n\nI shudder when I think that Armand must go to school, and that I have\nonly three years and a half more to keep him by me. The flowers that\nblossom in his sunny childhood will fall before the scythe of a public\nschool system; his gracious ways and bewitching candor will lose their\nspontaneity. They will cut the curls that I have brushed and smoothed\nand kissed so often! What will they do with the thinking being that is\nArmand?\n\nAnd what of you? You tell me nothing of your life. Are you still in\nlove with Felipe? For, as regards the Saracen, I have no uneasiness.\nGood-bye; Nais has just had a tumble, and if I run on like this, my\nletter will become a volume.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE 1829.\n\nMy sweet, tender Renee, you will have learned from the papers the\nterrible calamity which has overwhelmed me. I have not been able to\nwrite you even a word. For twenty days I never left his bedside; I\nreceived his last breath and closed his eyes; I kept holy watch over him\nwith the priests and repeated the prayers for the dead. The cruel pangs\nI suffered were accepted by me as a rightful punishment; and yet, when\nI saw on his calm lips the smile which was his last farewell to me, how\nwas it possible to believe that I had caused his death!\n\nBe it so or not, he is gone, and I am left. To you, who have known us\nboth so well, what more need I say? These words contain all. Oh! I would\ngive my share of Heaven to hear the flattering tale that my prayers have\npower to bring him back to life! To see him again, to have him once more\nmine, were it only for a second, would mean that I could draw breath\nagain without mortal agony. Will you not come soon and soothe me with\nsuch promises? Is not your love strong enough to deceive me?\n\nBut stay! it was you who told me beforehand that he would suffer through\nme. Was it so indeed? Yes, it is true, I had no right to his love. Like\na thief, I took what was not mine, and my frenzied grasp has crushed\nthe life out of my bliss. The madness is over now, but I feel that I am\nalone. Merciful God! what torture of the damned can exceed the misery in\nthat word?\n\nWhen they took him away from me, I lay down on the same bed and hoped to\ndie. There was but a door between us, and it seemed to me I had strength\nto force it! But, alas! I was too young for death; and after forty days,\nduring which, with cruel care and all the sorry inventions of medical\nscience, they slowly nursed me back to life, I find myself in the\ncountry, seated by my window, surrounded with lovely flowers, which he\nmade to bloom for me, gazing on the same splendid view over which\nhis eyes have so often wandered, and which he was so proud to have\ndiscovered, since it gave me pleasure. Ah! dear Renee, no words can tell\nhow new surroundings hurt when the heart is dead. I shiver at the sight\nof the moist earth in my garden, for the earth is a vast tomb, and it\nis almost as though I walked on _him_! When I first went out, I trembled\nwith fear and could not move. It was so sad to see his flowers, and he\nnot there!\n\nMy father and mother are in Spain. You know what my brothers are, and\nyou yourself are detained in the country. But you need not be uneasy\nabout me; two angels of mercy flew to my side. The Duc and the Duchesse\nde Soria hastened to their brother in his illness, and have been\neverything that heart could wish. The last few nights before the end\nfound the three of us gathered, in calm and wordless grief, round the\nbed where this great man was breathing his last, a man among a thousand,\nrare in any age, head and shoulders above the rest of us in everything.\nThe patient resignation of my Felipe was angelic. The sight of his\nbrother and Marie gave him a moment's pleasure and easing of his pain.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said to me with the simple frankness which never deserted\nhim, \"I had almost gone from life without leaving to Fernand the Barony\nof Macumer; I must make a new will. My brother will forgive me; he knows\nwhat it is to love!\"\n\nI owe my life to the care of my brother-in-law and his wife; they want\nto carry me off to Spain!\n\nAh! Renee, to no one but you can I speak freely of my grief. A sense of\nmy own faults weighs me to the ground, and there is a bitter solace in\npouring them out to you, poor, unheeded Cassandra. The exactions, the\npreposterous jealousy, the nagging unrest of my passion wore him to\ndeath. My love was the more fraught with danger for him because we had\nboth the same exquisitely sensitive nature, we spoke the same language,\nnothing was lost on him, and often the mocking shaft, so carelessly\ndischarged, went straight to his heart. You can have no idea of the\npoint to which he carried submissiveness. I had only to tell him to go\nand leave me alone, and the caprice, however wounding to him, would be\nobeyed without a murmur. His last breath was spent in blessing me and in\nrepeating that a single morning alone with me was more precious to him\nthan a lifetime spent with another woman, were she even the Marie of his\nyouth. My tears fall as I write the words.\n\nThis is the manner of my life now. I rise at midday and go to bed\nat seven; I linger absurdly long over meals; I saunter about slowly,\nstanding motionless, an hour at a time, before a single plant; I gaze\ninto the leafy trees; I take a sober and serious interest in mere\nnothings; I long for shade, silence, and night; in a word, I fight\nthrough each hour as it comes, and take a gloomy pleasure in adding it\nto the heap of the vanquished. My peaceful park gives me all the company\nI care for; everything there is full of glorious images of my vanished\njoy, invisible for others but eloquent to me.\n\n\"I cannot away with you Spaniards!\" I exclaimed one morning, as my\nsister-in-law flung herself on my neck. \"You have some nobility that we\nlack.\"\n\nAh! Renee, if I still live, it is doubtless because Heaven tempers the\nsense of affliction to the strength of those who have to bear it. Only a\nwoman can know what it is to lose a love which sprang from the heart and\nwas genuine throughout, a passion which was not ephemeral, and satisfied\nat once the spirit and the flesh. How rare it is to find a man so gifted\nthat to worship him brings no sense of degradation! If such supreme\nfortune befall us once, we cannot hope for it a second time. Men of true\ngreatness, whose strength and worth are veiled by poetic grace, and who\ncharm by some high spiritual power, men made to be adored, beware of\nlove! Love will ruin you, and ruin the woman of your heart. This is the\nburden of my cry as I pace my woodland walks.\n\nAnd he has left me no child! That love so rich in smiles, which rained\nperpetual flowers and joy, has left no fruit. I am a thing accursed. Can\nit be that, even as the two extremes of polar ice and torrid sand\nare alike intolerant of life, so the very purity and vehemence of a\nsingle-hearted passion render it barren as hate? Is it only a marriage\nof reason, such as yours, which is blessed with a family? Can Heaven be\njealous of our passions? There are wild words.\n\nYou are, I believe, the one person whose company I could endure. Come to\nme, then; none but Renee should be with Louise in her sombre garb.\nWhat a day when I first put on my widow's bonnet! When I saw myself all\narrayed in black, I fell back on a seat and wept till night came; and I\nweep again as I recall that moment of anguish.\n\nGood-bye. Writing tires me; thoughts crowd fast, but I have no heart\nto put them into words. Bring your children; you can nurse baby here\nwithout making me jealous; all that is gone, _he_ is not here, and I\nshall be very glad to see my godson. Felipe used to wish for a child\nlike little Armand. Come, then, come and help me to bear my woe.\n\n\n\n\nXLVII. RENEE TO LOUISE 1829.\n\nMy darling,--When you hold this letter in your hands, I shall be already\nnear, for I am starting a few minutes after it. We shall be alone\ntogether. Louis is obliged to remain in Provence because of the\napproaching elections. He wants to be elected again, and the Liberals\nare already plotting against his return.\n\nI don't come to comfort you; I only bring you my heart to beat in\nsympathy with yours, and help you to bear with life. I come to bid you\nweep, for only with tears can you purchase the joy of meeting him again.\nRemember, he is traveling towards Heaven, and every step forward which\nyou take brings you nearer to him. Every duty done breaks a link in the\nchain that keeps you apart.\n\nLouise, in my arms you will once more raise your head and go on your way\nto him, pure, noble, washed of all those errors, which had no root in\nyour heart, and bearing with you the harvest of good deeds which, in his\nname, you will accomplish here.\n\nI scribble these hasty lines in all the bustle of preparation, and\ninterrupted by the babies and by Armand, who keeps saying, \"Godmother,\ngodmother! I want to see her,\" till I am almost jealous. He might be\nyour child!\n\n\n\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE October 15,\n1833.\n\nYes, Renee, it is quite true; you have been correctly informed. I\nhave sold my house, I have sold Chantepleurs, and the farms in\nSeine-et-Marne, but no more, please! I am neither mad nor ruined, I\nassure you.\n\nLet us go into the matter. When everything was wound up, there remained\nto me of my poor Macumer's fortune about twelve hundred thousand francs.\nI will account, as to a practical sister, for every penny of this.\n\nI put a million in the Three per Cents when they were at fifty, and so\nI have got an income for myself of sixty thousand francs, instead of\nthe thirty thousand which the property yielded. Then, only think what\nmy life was. Six months of the year in the country, renewing leases,\nlistening to the grumbles of the farmers, who pay when it pleases them,\nand getting as bored as a sportsman in wet weather. There was produce\nto sell, and I always sold it at a loss. Then, in Paris, my house\nrepresented a rental of ten thousand francs; I had to invest my money\nat the notaries; I was kept waiting for the interest, and could only\nget the money back by prosecuting; in addition I had to study the law of\nmortgage. In short, there was business in Nivernais, in Seine-et-Marne,\nin Paris--and what a burden, what a nuisance, what a vexing and losing\ngame for a widow of twenty-seven!\n\nWhereas now my fortune is secured on the Budget. In place of paying\ntaxes to the State, I receive from it, every half-year, in my own\nperson, and free from cost, thirty thousand francs in thirty notes,\nhanded over the counter to me by a dapper little clerk at the Treasury,\nwho smiles when he sees me coming!\n\nSupposing the nation went bankrupt? Well, to begin with:\n\n  'Tis not mine to see trouble so far from my door.\n\nAt the worst, too, the nation would not dock me of more than half my\nincome, so I should still be as well off as before my investment, and\nin the meantime I shall be drawing a double income until the catastrophe\narrives. A nation doesn't become bankrupt more than once in a century,\nso I shall have plenty of time to amass a little capital out of my\nsavings.\n\nAnd finally, is not the Comte de l'Estorade a peer of this July\nsemi-republic? Is he not one of those pillars of royalty offered by the\n\"people\" to the King of the French? How can I have qualms with a friend\nat Court, a great financier, head of the Audit Department? I defy you to\narraign my sanity! I am almost as good at sums as your citizen king.\n\nDo you know what inspires a woman with all this arithmetic? Love, my\ndear!\n\nAlas! the moment has come for unfolding to you the mysteries of my\nconduct, the motives of which have baffled even your keen sight, your\nprying affection, and your subtlety. I am to be married in a country\nvillage near Paris. I love and am loved. I love as much as a woman can\nwho knows love well. I am loved as much as a woman ought to be by the\nman she adores.\n\nForgive me, Renee, for keeping this a secret from you and from every\none. If your friend evades all spies and puts curiosity on a false\ntrack, you must admit that my feeling for poor Macumer justified some\ndissimulation. Besides, de l'Estorade and you would have deafened me\nwith remonstrances, and plagued me to death with your misgivings, to\nwhich the facts might have lent some color. You know, if no one else\ndoes, to what pitch my jealousy can go, and all this would only have\nbeen useless torture to me. I was determined to carry out, on my own\nresponsibility, what you, Renee, will call my insane project, and I\nwould take counsel only with my own head and heart, for all the world\nlike a schoolgirl giving the slip to her watchful parents.\n\nThe man I love possesses nothing but thirty thousand francs' worth of\ndebts, which I have paid. What a theme for comment here! You would have\ntried to make Gaston out an adventurer; your husband would have set\ndetectives on the dear boy. I preferred to sift him for myself. He\nhas been wooing me now close on two years. I am twenty-seven, he is\ntwenty-three. The difference, I admit, is huge when it is on the wrong\nside. Another source of lamentation!\n\nLastly, he is a poet, and has lived by his trade--that is to say, on\nnext to nothing, as you will readily understand. Being a poet, he has\nspent more time weaving day-dreams, and basking, lizard-like, in the\nsun, than scribing in his dingy garret. Now, practical people have a way\nof tarring with the same brush of inconstancy authors, artists, and in\ngeneral all men who live by their brains. Their nimble and fertile wit\nlays them open to the charge of a like agility in matters of the heart.\n\nSpite of the debts, spite of the difference in age, spite of the poetry,\nan end is to be placed in a few days to a heroic resistance of more than\nnine months, during which he has not been allowed even to kiss my hand,\nand so also ends the season of our sweet, pure love-making. This is not\nthe mere surrender of a raw, ignorant, and curious girl, as it was eight\nyears ago; the gift is deliberate, and my lover awaits it with such\nloyal patience that, if I pleased, I could postpone the marriage for\na year. There is no servility in this; love's slave he may be, but the\nheart is not slavish. Never have I seen a man of nobler feeling, or\none whose tenderness was more rich in fancy, whose love bore more the\nimpress of his soul. Alas! my sweet one, the art of love is his by\nheritage. A few words will tell his story.\n\nMy friend has no other name than Marie Gaston. He is the illegitimate\nson of the beautiful Lady Brandon, whose fame must have reached you,\nand who died broken-hearted, a victim to the vengeance of Lady Dudley--a\nghastly story of which the dear boy knows nothing. Marie Gaston was\nplaced by his brother Louis in a boarding-school at Tours, where he\nremained till 1827. Louis, after settling his brother at school, sailed\na few days later for foreign parts \"to seek his fortune,\" to use the\nwords of an old woman who had played the part of Providence to him.\nThis brother turned sailor used to write him, at long intervals, letters\nquite fatherly in tone, and breathing a noble spirit; but a struggling\nlife never allowed him to return home. His last letter told Marie that\nhe had been appointed Captain in the navy of some American republic, and\nexhorted him to hope for better days.\n\nAlas! since then three years have passed, and my poor poet has never\nheard again. So dearly did he love his brother, that he would have\nstarted to look for him but for Daniel d'Arthez, the well-known author,\nwho took a generous interest in Marie Gaston, and prevented him carrying\nout his mad impulse. Nor was this all; often would he give him a crust\nand a corner, as the poet puts it in his graphic words.\n\nFor, in truth, the poor lad was in terrible straits; he was actually\ninnocent enough to believe--incredible as it seems--that genius was the\nshortest road to fortune, and from 1828 to 1833 his one aim has been to\nmake a name for himself in letters. Naturally his life was a frightful\ntissue of toil and hardships, alternating between hope and despair. The\ngood advice of d'Arthez could not prevail against the allurements of\nambition, and his debts went on growing like a snowball. Still he\nwas beginning to come into notice when I happened to meet him at Mme.\nd'Espard's. At first sight he inspired me, unconsciously to himself,\nwith the most vivid sympathy. How did it come about that this virgin\nheart has been left for me? The fact is that my poet combines genius and\ncleverness, passion and pride, and women are always afraid of greatness\nwhich has no weak side to it. How many victories were needed before\nJosephine could see the great Napoleon in the little Bonaparte whom she\nhad married.\n\nPoor Gaston is innocent enough to think he knows the measure of my love!\nHe simply has not an idea of it, but to you I must make it clear;\nfor this letter, Renee, is something in the nature of a last will and\ntestament. Weigh well what I am going to say, I beg of you.\n\nAt this moment I am confident of being loved as perhaps not another\nwomen on this earth, nor have I a shadow of doubt as to the perfect\nhappiness of our wedded life, to which I bring a feeling hitherto\nunknown to me. Yes, for the first time in my life, I know the delight\nof being swayed by passion. That which every woman seeks in love will\nbe mine in marriage. As poor Felipe once adored me, so do I now adore\nGaston. I have lost control of myself, I tremble before this boy as the\nArab hero used to tremble before me. In a word, the balance of love is\nnow on my side, and this makes me timid. I am full of the most absurd\nterrors. I am afraid of being deserted, afraid of becoming old and ugly\nwhile Gaston still retains his youth and beauty, afraid of coming short\nof his hopes!\n\nAnd yet I believe I have it in me, I believe I have sufficient devotion\nand ability, not only to keep alive the flame of his love in our\nsolitary life, far from the world, but even to make it burn stronger and\nbrighter. If I am mistaken, if this splendid idyl of love in hiding must\ncome to an end--an end! what am I saying?--if I find Gaston's love less\nintense any day than it was the evening before, be sure of this, Renee,\nI should visit my failure only on myself; no blame should attach to him.\nI tell you now it would mean my death. Not even if I had children could\nI live on these terms, for I know myself, Renee, I know that my nature\nis the lover's rather than the mother's. Therefore before taking this\nvow upon my soul, I implore you, my Renee, if this disaster befall me,\nto take the place of mother to my children; let them be my legacy to\nyou! All that I know of you, your blind attachment to duty, your rare\ngifts, your love of children, your affection for me, would help to make\nmy death--I dare not say easy--but at least less bitter.\n\nThe compact I have thus made with myself adds a vague terror to the\nsolemnity of my marriage ceremony. For this reason I wish to have no one\nwhom I know present, and it will be performed in secret. Let my heart\nfail me if it will, at least I shall not read anxiety in your dear eyes,\nand I alone shall know that this new marriage-contract which I sign may\nbe my death warrant.\n\nI shall not refer again to this agreement entered into between my\npresent self and the self I am to be. I have confided it to you in\norder that you might know the full extent of your responsibilities. In\nmarrying I retain full control of my property; and Gaston, while aware\nthat I have enough to secure a comfortable life for both of us, is\nignorant of its amount. Within twenty-four hours I shall dispose of it\nas I please; and in order to save him from a humiliating position, I\nshall have stock, bringing in twelve thousand francs a year, assigned\nto him. He will find this in his desk on the eve of our wedding. If\nhe declined to accept, I should break off the whole thing. I had to\nthreaten a rupture to get his permission to pay his debts.\n\nThis long confession has tired me. I shall finish it the day after\nto-morrow; I have to spend to-morrow in the country.\n\nOctober 20th.\n\nI will tell you now the steps I have taken to insure secrecy. My object\nhas been to ward off every possible incitement to my ever-wakeful\njealousy, in imitation of the Italian princess, who, like a lioness\nrushing on her prey, carried it off to some Swiss town to devour in\npeace. And I confide my plans to you because I have another favor to\nbeg; namely, that you will respect our solitude and never come to see us\nuninvited.\n\nTwo years ago I purchased a small property overlooking the ponds of\nVille d'Avray, on the road to Versailles. It consists of twenty acres\nof meadow land, the skirts of a wood, and a fine fruit garden. Below\nthe meadows the land has been excavated so as to make a lakelet of about\nthree acres in extent, with a charming little island in the middle. The\nsmall valley is shut in by two graceful, thickly-wooded slopes, where\nrise delicious springs that water my park by means of channels cleverly\ndisposed by my architect. Finally, they fall into the royal ponds,\nglimpses of which can be seen here and there, gleaming in the distance.\nMy little park has been admirably laid out by the architect, who has\nsurrounded it by hedges, walls, or ha-has, according to the lie of the\nland, so that no possible point of view may be lost.\n\nA chalet has been built for me half-way up the hillside, with a charming\nexposure, having the woods of the Ronce on either side, and in front a\ngrassy slope running down to the lake. Externally the chalet is an exact\ncopy of those which are so much admired by travelers on the road from\nSion to Brieg, and which fascinated me when I was returning from Italy.\nThe internal decorations will bear comparison with those of the most\ncelebrated buildings of the kind.\n\nA hundred paces from this rustic dwelling stands a charming and\nornamental house, communicating with it by a subterranean passage.\nThis contains the kitchen, and other servants' rooms, stables, and\ncoach-houses. Of all this series of brick buildings, the facade alone\nis seen, graceful in its simplicity, against a background of shrubbery.\nAnother building serves to lodge the gardeners and masks the entrance to\nthe orchards and kitchen-gardens.\n\nThe entrance gate to the property is so hidden in the wall dividing the\npark from the wood as almost to defy detection. The plantations, already\nwell grown, will, in two or three years, completely hide the buildings,\nso that, except in winter, when the trees are bare, no trace of\nhabitation will appear to the outside world, save only the smoke visible\nfrom the neighboring hills.\n\nThe surroundings of my chalet have been modeled on what is called the\nKing's Garden at Versailles, but it has an outlook on my lakelet and\nisland. The hills on every side display their abundant foliage--those\nsplendid trees for which your new civil list has so well cared. My\ngardeners have orders to cultivate new sweet-scented flowers to any\nextent, and no others, so that our home will be a fragrant emerald. The\nchalet, adorned with a wild vine which covers the roof, is literally\nembedded in climbing plants of all kinds--hops, clematis, jasmine,\nazalea, copaea. It will be a sharp eye which can descry our windows!\n\nThe chalet, my dear, is a good, solid house, with its heating system and\nall the conveniences of modern architecture, which can raise a palace in\nthe compass of a hundred square feet. It contains a suite of rooms for\nGaston and another for me. The ground-floor is occupied by an ante-room,\na parlor, and a dining room. Above our floor again are three rooms\ndestined for the nurseries. I have five first-rate horses, a small light\ncoupe, and a two-horse cabriolet. We are only forty-minutes' drive from\nParis; so that, when the spirit moves us to hear an opera or see a new\nplay, we can start after dinner and return the same night to our bower.\nThe road is a good one, and passes under the shade of our green dividing\nwall.\n\nMy servants--cook, coachman, groom, and gardeners, in addition to my\nmaid--are all very respectable people, whom I have spent the last six\nmonths in picking up, and they will be superintended by my old Philippe.\nAlthough confident of their loyalty and good faith, I have not neglected\nto cultivate self-interest; their wages are small, but will receive an\nannual addition in the shape of a New Year's Day present. They are all\naware that the slightest fault, or a mere suspicion of gossiping,\nmight lose them a capital place. Lovers are never troublesome to their\nservants; they are indulgent by disposition, and therefore I feel that I\ncan reckon on my household.\n\nAll that is choice, pretty, or decorative in my house in the Rue du\nBac has been transported to the chalet. The Rembrandt hangs on the\nstaircase, as though it were a mere daub; the Hobbema faces the Rubens\nin _his_ study; the Titian, which my sister-in-law Mary sent me from\nMadrid, adorns the boudoir. The beautiful furniture picked up by Felipe\nlooks very well in the parlor, which the architect has decorated most\ntastefully. Everything at the chalet is charmingly simple, with the\nsimplicity which can't be got under a hundred thousand francs. Our\nground-floor rests on cellars, which are built of millstone and embedded\nin concrete; it is almost completely buried in flowers and shrubs, and\nis deliciously cool without a vestige of damp. To complete the picture,\na fleet of white swans sail over my lake!\n\nOh! Renee, the silence which reigns in this valley would bring joy to\nthe dead! One is awakened by the birds singing or the breeze rustling in\nthe poplars. A little spring, discovered by the architect in digging the\nfoundations of the wall, trickles down the hillside over silvery sand\nto the lake, between two banks of water-cress, hugging the edge of the\nwoods. I know nothing that money can buy to equal it.\n\nMay not Gaston come to loathe this too perfect bliss? I shudder to think\nhow complete it is, for the ripest fruits harbor the worms, the most\ngorgeous flowers attract the insects. Is it not ever the monarch of the\nforest which is eaten away by the fatal brown grub, greedy as death?\nI have learned before now that an unseen and jealous power attacks\nhappiness which has reached perfection. Besides, this is the moral of\nall your preaching, and you have been proved a prophet.\n\nWhen I went, the day before yesterday, to see whether my last whim had\nbeen carried out, tears rose to my eyes; and, to the great surprise of\nmy architect, I at once passed his account for payment.\n\n\"But, madame,\" he exclaimed, \"your man of business will refuse to pay\nthis; it is a matter of three hundred thousand francs.\" My only reply\nwas to add the words, \"To be paid without question,\" with the bearing of\na seventeenth-century Chaulieu.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"there is one condition to my gratitude. No human being\nmust hear from you of the park and buildings. Promise me, on your honor,\nto observe this article in our contract--not to breathe to a soul the\nproprietor's name.\"\n\nNow, can you understand the meaning of my sudden journeys, my mysterious\ncomings and goings? Now, do you know whither those beautiful things,\nwhich the world supposes to be sold, have flown? Do you perceive the\nultimate motive of my change of investment? Love, my dear, is a vast\nbusiness, and they who would succeed in it should have no other.\nHenceforth I shall have no more trouble from money matters; I have taken\nall the thorns out of my life, and done my housekeeping work once for\nall with a vengeance, so as never to be troubled with it again, except\nduring the daily ten minutes which I shall devote to my old major-domo\nPhilippe. I have made a study of life and its sharp curves; there came\na day when death also gave me harsh lessons. Now I want to turn all this\nto account. My one occupation will be to please _him_ and love _him_, to\nbrighten with variety what to common mortals is monotonously dull.\n\nGaston is still in complete ignorance. At my request he has, like\nmyself, taken up his quarters at Ville d'Avray; to-morrow we start for\nthe chalet. Our life there will cost but little; but if I told you the\nsum I am setting aside for my toilet, you would exclaim at my madness,\nand with reason. I intend to take as much trouble to make myself\nbeautiful for him every day as other women do for society. My dress in\nthe country, year in, year out, will cost twenty-four thousand francs,\nand the larger portion of this will not go in day costumes. As for him,\nhe can wear a blouse if he pleases! Don't suppose that I am going to\nturn our life into an amorous duel and wear myself out in devices for\nfeeding passion; all that I want is to have a conscience free from\nreproach. Thirteen years still lie before me as a pretty woman, and I\nam determined to be loved on the last day of the thirteenth even more\nfondly than on the morrow of our mysterious nuptials. This time no\ncutting words shall mar my lowly, grateful content. I will take the part\nof servant, since that of mistress throve so ill with me before.\n\nAh! Renee, if Gaston has sounded, as I have, the heights and depths of\nlove, my happiness is assured! Nature at the chalet wears her fairest\nface. The woods are charming; each step opens up to you some fresh\nvista of cool greenery, which delights the soul by the sweet thoughts it\nwakens. They breathe of love. If only this be not the gorgeous theatre\ndressed by my hand for my own martyrdom!\n\nIn two days from now I shall be Mme. Gaston. My God! is it fitting a\nChristian so to love mortal man?\n\n\"Well, at least you have the law with you,\" was the comment of my man\nof business, who is to be one of my witnesses, and who exclaimed, on\ndiscovering why my property was to be realized, \"I am losing a client!\"\n\nAnd you, my sweetheart (whom I dare no longer call my loved one), may\nyou not cry, \"I am losing a sister?\"\n\nMy sweet, address when you write in future to Mme. Gaston, Poste\nRestante, Versailles. We shall send there every day for letters. I don't\nwant to be known to the country people, and we shall get our provisions\nfrom Paris. In this way I hope we may guard the secret of our lives.\nNobody has been seen in the place during the years spent in preparing\nour retreat; and the purchase was made in the troubled period which\nfollowed the revolution of July. The only person who has shown himself\nhere is the architect; he alone is known, and he will not return.\n\nFarewell. As I write this word, I know not whether my heart is fuller\nof grief or joy. That proves, does it not, that the pain of losing you\nequals my love for Gaston?\n\n\n\n\nXLIX. MARIE GASTON TO DANIEL D'ARTHEZ October 1833.\n\nMy Dear Daniel,--I need two witnesses for my marriage. I beg of you to\ncome to-morrow evening for this purpose, bringing with you our worthy\nand honored friend, Joseph Bridau. She who is to be my wife, with an\ninstinctive divination of my dearest wishes, has declared her intention\nof living far from the world in complete retirement. You, who have done\nso much to lighten my penury, have been left in ignorance of my love;\nbut you will understand that absolute secrecy was essential.\n\nThis will explain to you why it is that, for the last year, we have seen\nso little of each other. On the morrow of my wedding we shall be\nparted for a long time; but, Daniel, you are of stuff to understand me.\nFriendship can subsist in the absence of the friend. There may be times\nwhen I shall want you badly, but I shall not see you, at least not in\nmy own house. Here again _she_ has forestalled our wishes. She has\nsacrificed to me her intimacy with a friend of her childhood, who has\nbeen a sister to her. For her sake, then, I also must relinquish my\ncomrade!\n\nFrom this fact alone you will divine that ours is no mere passing\nfancy, but love, absolute, perfect, godlike; love based upon the fullest\nknowledge that can bind two hearts in sympathy. To me it is a perpetual\nspring of purest delight.\n\nYet nature allows of no happiness without alloy; and deep down, in the\ninnermost recess of my heart, I am conscious of a lurking thought, not\nshared with her, the pang of which is for me alone. You have too often\ncome to the help of my inveterate poverty to be ignorant how desperate\nmatters were with me. Where should I have found courage to keep up the\nstruggle of life, after seeing my hopes so often blighted, but for your\ncheering words, your tactful aid, and the knowledge of what you had come\nthrough? Briefly, then, my friend, she freed me from that crushing load\nof debt, which was no secret to you. She is wealthy, I am penniless.\nMany a time have I exclaimed, in one of my fits of idleness, \"Oh for\nsome great heiress to cast her eye on me!\" And now, in presence of\nthis reality, the boy's careless jest, the unscrupulous cynicism of the\noutcast, have alike vanished, leaving in their place only a bitter sense\nof humiliation, which not the most considerate tenderness on her part,\nnor my own assurance of her noble nature, can remove. Nay, what better\nproof of my love could there exist, for her or for myself, than this\nshame, from which I have not recoiled, even when powerless to overcome\nit? The fact remains that there is a point where, far from protecting, I\nam the protected.\n\nThis is my pain which I confide to you.\n\nExcept in this one particular, dear Daniel, my fondest dreams are more\nthan realized. Fairest and noblest among women, such a bride might\nindeed raise a man to giddy heights of bliss. Her gentle ways are\nseasoned with wit, her love comes with an ever-fresh grace and charm;\nher mind is well informed and quick to understand; in person, she is\nfair and lovely, with a rounded slimness, as though Raphael and Rubens\nhad conspired to create a woman! I do not know whether I could have\nworshiped with such fervor at the shrine of a dark beauty; a brunette\nalways strikes me as an unfinished boy. She is a widow, childless, and\ntwenty-seven years of age. Though brimful of life and energy, she has\nher moods also of dreamy melancholy. These rare gifts go with a proud\naristocratic bearing; she has a fine presence.\n\nShe belongs to one of those old families who make a fetich of rank, yet\nloves me enough to ignore the misfortune of my birth. Our secret passion\nis now of long standing; we have made trial, each of the other, and find\nthat in the matter of jealousy we are twin spirits; our thoughts are the\nreverberation of the same thunderclap. We both love for the first time,\nand this bewitching springtime has filled its days for us with all the\nimages of delight that fancy can paint in laughing, sweet, or musing\nmood. Our path has been strewn with the flowers of tender imaginings.\nEach hour brought its own wealth, and when we parted, it was to put our\nthoughts in verse. Not for a moment did I harbor the idea of sullying\nthe brightness of such a time by giving the rein to sensual passion,\nhowever it might chafe within. She was a widow and free; intuitively,\nshe realized all the homage implied in this constant self-restraint,\nwhich often moved her to tears. Can you not read in this, my friend, a\nsoul of noble temper? In mutual fear we shunned even the first kiss of\nlove.\n\n\"We have each a wrong to reproach ourselves with,\" she said one day.\n\n\"Where is yours?\" I asked.\n\n\"My marriage,\" was her reply.\n\nDaniel, you are a giant among us and you love one of the most gifted\nwomen of the aristocracy, which has produced my Armande; what need to\ntell you more? Such an answer lays bare to you a woman's heart and all\nthe happiness which is in store for your friend, MARIE GASTON.\n\n\n\n\nL. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. DE MACUMER\n\nLouise, can it be that, with all your knowledge of the deep-seated\nmischief wrought by the indulgence of passion, even within the heart of\nmarriage, you are planning a life of wedded solitude? Having sacrificed\nyour first husband in the course of a fashionable career, would you now\nfly to the desert to consume a second? What stores of misery you are\nlaying up for yourself!\n\nBut I see from the way you have set about it that there is no going\nback. The man who has overcome your aversion to a second marriage must\nindeed possess some magic of mind and heart; and you can only be left\nto your illusions. But have you forgotten your former criticism on young\nmen? Not one, you would say, but has visited haunts of shame, and\nhas besmirched his purity with the filth of the streets. Where is the\nchange, pray--in them or in you?\n\nYou are a lucky woman to be able to believe in happiness. I have not the\ncourage to blame you for it, though the instinct of affection urges me\nto dissuade you from this marriage. Yes, a thousand times, yes, it\nis true that nature and society are at one in making war on absolute\nhappiness, because such a condition is opposed to the laws of both;\npossibly, also, because Heaven is jealous of its privileges. My love\nfor you forebodes some disaster to which all my penetration can give no\ndefinite form. I know neither whence nor from whom it will arise; but\none need be no prophet to foretell that the mere weight of a boundless\nhappiness will overpower you. Excess of joy is harder to bear than any\namount of sorrow.\n\nAgainst him I have not a word to say. You love him, and in all\nprobability I have never seen him; but some idle day I hope you will\nsend me a sketch, however slight, of this rare, fine animal.\n\nIf you see me so resigned and cheerful, it is because I am convinced\nthat, once the honeymoon is over you will both with one accord, fall\nback into the common track. Some day, two years hence, when we are\nwalking along this famous road, you will exclaim, \"Why, there is the\nchalet which was to be my home for ever!\" And you will laugh your dear\nold laugh, which shows all your pretty teeth!\n\nI have said nothing yet to Louis; it would be too good an opening for\nhis ridicule. I shall tell him simply that you are going to be married,\nand that you wish it kept secret. Unluckily, you need neither mother\nnor sister for your bridal evening. We are in October now; like a brave\nwoman, you are grappling with winter first. If it were not a question\nof marriage, I should say you were taking the bull by the horns. In any\ncase, you will have in me the most discreet and intelligent of friends.\nThat mysterious region, known as the centre of Africa, has swallowed\nup many travelers, and you seem to me to be launching on an expedition\nwhich, in the domain of sentiment, corresponds to those where so\nmany explorers have perished, whether in the sands or at the hands of\nnatives. Your desert is, happily, only two leagues from Paris, so I can\nwish you quite cheerfully, \"A safe journey and speedy return.\"\n\n\n\n\nLI. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. MARIE GASTON 1835.\n\nWhat has come to you, my dear? After a silence of two years, surely\nRenee has a right to feel anxious about Louise. So this is love! It\nbrushes aside and scatters to the winds a friendship such as ours! You\nmust admit that, devoted as I am to my children--more even perhaps than\nyou to your Gaston--a mother's love has something expansive about it\nwhich does not allow it to steal from other affections, or interfere\nwith the claims of friendship. I miss your letters, I long for a sight\nof your dear, sweet face. Oh! Louise, my heart has only conjecture to\nfeed upon!\n\nAs regards ourselves, I will try and tell you everything as briefly as\npossible.\n\nOn reading your last letter but one, I find some stinging comments on\nour political situation. You mocked at us for keeping the post in the\nAudit Department, which, as well as the title of Count, Louis owed to\nthe favor of Charles X. But I should like to know, please, how it would\nbe possible out of an income of forty thousand livres, thirty thousand\nof which go with the entail, to give a suitable start in life to\nAthenais and my poor little beggar Rene. Was it not a duty to live on\nour salary and prudently allow the income of the estate to accumulate?\nIn this way we shall, in twenty years, have put together about six\nhundred thousand francs, which will provide portions for my daughter and\nfor Rene, whom I destine for the navy. The poor little chap will have an\nincome of ten thousand livres, and perhaps we may contrive to leave him\nin cash enough to bring his portion up to the amount of his sister's.\n\nWhen he is Captain, my beggar will be able to make a wealthy marriage,\nand take a position in society as good as his elder brother's.\n\nThese considerations of prudence determined the acceptance in our family\nof the new order of things. The new dynasty, as was natural, raised\nLouis to the Peerage and made him a grand officer of the Legion of\nHonor. The oath once taken, l'Estorade could not be half-hearted in his\nservices, and he has since then made himself very useful in the Chamber.\nThe position he has now attained is one in which he can rest upon his\noars till the end of his days. He has a good deal of adroitness in\nbusiness matters; and though he can hardly be called an orator, speaks\npleasantly and fluently, which is all that is necessary in politics.\nHis shrewdness and the extent of his information in all matters of\ngovernment and administration are fully appreciated, and all parties\nconsider him indispensable. I may tell you that he was recently offered\nan embassy, but I would not let him accept it. I am tied to Paris by the\neducation of Armand and Athenais--who are now respectively thirteen and\nnearly eleven--and I don't intend leaving till little Rene has completed\nhis, which is just beginning.\n\nWe could not have remained faithful to the elder branch of the dynasty\nand returned to our country life without allowing the education and\nprospects of the three children to suffer. A mother, my sweet, is hardly\ncalled on to be a Decius, especially at a time when the type is rare. In\nfifteen years from now, l'Estorade will be able to retire to La Crampade\non a good pension, having found a place as referendary for Armand in the\nAudit Department.\n\nAs for Rene, the navy will doubtless make a diplomatist of him.\nThe little rogue, at seven years old, has all the cunning of an old\nCardinal.\n\nOh! Louise, I am indeed a happy mother. My children are an endless\nsource of joy to me.\n\n  Senza brama sicura ricchezza.\n\nArmand is a day scholar at Henry IV.'s school. I made up my mind he\nshould have a public-school training, yet could not reconcile myself to\nthe thought of parting with him; so I compromised, as the Duc d'Orleans\ndid before he became--or in order that he might become--Louis Philippe.\nEvery morning Lucas, the old servant whom you will remember, takes\nArmand to school in time for the first lesson, and brings him home again\nat half-past four. In the house we have a private tutor, an admirable\nscholar, who helps Armand with his work in the evenings, and calls him\nin the morning at the school hour. Lucas takes him some lunch during the\nplay hour at midday. In this way I am with my boy at dinner and until he\ngoes to bed at night, and I see him off in the morning.\n\nArmand is the same charming little fellow, full of feeling and unselfish\nimpulse, whom you loved; and his tutor is quite pleased with him. I\nstill have Nais and the baby--two restless little mortals--but I am\nquite as much a child as they are. I could not bring myself to lose the\ndarlings' sweet caresses. I could not live without the feeling that\nat any moment I can fly to Armand's bedside and watch his slumbers or\nsnatch a kiss.\n\nYet home education is not without its drawbacks, to which I am fully\nalive. Society, like nature, is a jealous power, and will have not her\nrights encroached on, or her system set at naught. Thus, children who\nare brought up at home are exposed too early to the fire of the world;\nthey see its passions and become at home with its subterfuges. The finer\ndistinctions, which regulate the conduct of matured men and women, elude\ntheir perceptions, and they take feeling and passion for their guide\ninstead of subordinating those to the code of society; whilst the gay\ntrappings and tinsel which attract so much of the world's favor blind\nthem to the importance of the more sober virtues. A child of fifteen\nwith the assurance of a man of the world is a thing against all nature;\nat twenty-five he will be prematurely old, and his precocious knowledge\nonly unfits him for the genuine study on which all solid ability must\nrest. Life in society is one long comedy, and those who take part in it,\nlike other actors, reflect back impressions which never penetrate\nbelow the surface. A mother, therefore, who wishes not to part from her\nchildren, must resolutely determine that they shall not enter the gay\nworld; she must have courage to resist their inclinations, as well\nas her own, and keep them in the background. Cornelia had to keep her\njewels under lock and key. Shall I do less for the children who are all\nthe world to me?\n\nNow that I am thirty, the heat of the day is over, the hardest bit of\nthe road lies behind me. In a few years I shall be an old woman, and the\nsense of duty done is an immense encouragement. It would almost seem as\nthough my trio can read my thoughts and shape themselves accordingly. A\nmysterious bond of sympathy unites me to these children who have never\nleft my side. If they knew the blank in my life which they have to fill,\nthey could not be more lavish of the solace they bring.\n\nArmand, who was dull and dreamy during his first three years at school,\nand caused me some uneasiness, has made a sudden start. Doubtless\nhe realized, in a way most children never do, the aim of all this\npreparatory work, which is to sharpen the intelligence, to get them into\nhabits of application and accustom them to that fundamental principle of\nall society--obedience. My dear, a few days ago I had the proud joy of\nseeing Armand crowned at the great interscholastic competition in\nthe crowded Sorbonne, when your godson received the first prize for\ntranslation. At the school distribution he got two first prizes--one for\nverse, and one for an essay. I went quite white when his name was called\nout, and longed to shout aloud, \"I am his mother!\" Little Nais squeezed\nmy hand till it hurt, if at such a moment it were possible to feel pain.\nAh! Louise, a day like this might outweigh many a dream of love!\n\nHis brother's triumphs have spurred on little Rene, who wants to go to\nschool too. Sometimes the three children make such a racket, shouting\nand rushing about the house, that I wonder how my head stands it. I am\nalways with them; no one else, not even Mary, is allowed to take care\nof my children. But the calling of a mother, if taxing, has so many\ncompensating joys! To see a child leave its play and run to hug one, out\nof the fulness of its heart, what could be sweeter?\n\nThen it is only in being constantly with them that one can study their\ncharacters. It is the duty of a mother, and one which she can depute to\nno hired teacher, to decipher the tastes, temper, and natural aptitudes\nof her children from their infancy. All home-bred children are\ndistinguished by ease of manner and tact, two acquired qualities which\nmay go far to supply the lack of natural ability, whereas no natural\nability can atone for the loss of this early training. I have already\nlearned to discriminate this difference of tone in the men whom I meet\nin society, and to trace the hand of a woman in the formation of a\nyoung man's manners. How could any woman defraud her children of such a\npossession? You see what rewards attend the performance of my tasks!\n\nArmand, I feel certain, will make an admirable judge, the most upright\nof public servants, the most devoted of deputies. And where would you\nfind a sailor bolder, more adventurous, more astute than my Rene will be\na few years hence? The little rascal has already an iron will, whatever\nhe wants he manages to get; he will try a thousand circuitous ways to\nreach his end, and if not successful then, will devise a thousand and\nfirst. Where dear Armand quietly resigns himself and tries to get at the\nreason of things, Rene will storm, and strive, and puzzle, chattering\nall the time, till at last he finds some chink in the obstacle; if there\nis room for the blade of a knife to pass, his little carriage will ride\nthrough in triumph.\n\nAnd Nais? Nais is so completely a second self that I can hardly realize\nher as distinct from my own flesh and blood. What a darling she is, and\nhow I love to make a little lady of her, to dress her curly hair, tender\nthoughts mingling the while with every touch! I must have her happy; I\nshall only give her to the man who loves her and whom she loves.\nBut, Heavens! when I let her put on her little ornaments, or pass a\ncherry-colored ribbon through her hair, or fasten the shoes on her tiny\nfeet, a sickening thought comes over me. How can one order the destiny\nof a girl? Who can say that she will not love a scoundrel or some man\nwho is indifferent to her? Tears often spring to my eyes as I watch her.\nThis lovely creature, this flower, this rosebud which has blossomed in\none's heart, to be handed over to a man who will tear it from the stem\nand leave it bare! Louise, it is you--you, who in two years have not\nwritten three words to tell me of your welfare--it is you who have\nrecalled to my mind the terrible possibilities of marriage, so full of\nanguish for a mother wrapped up, as I am, in her child. Farewell now,\nfor in truth you don't deserve my friendship, and I hardly know how to\nwrite. Oh! answer me, dear Louise.\n\n\n\n\nLII. MME. GASTON TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE The Chalet.\n\nSo, after a silence of two years, you are pricked by curiosity, and want\nto know why I have not written. My dear Renee, there are no words, no\nimages, no language to express my happiness. That we have strength to\nbear it sums up all I could say. It costs us no effort, for we are in\nperfect sympathy. The whole two years have known no note of discord in\nthe harmony, no jarring word in the interchange of feeling, no shade of\ndifference in our lightest wish. Not one in this long succession of\ndays has failed to bear its own peculiar fruit; not a moment has passed\nwithout being enriched by the play of fancy. So far are we from dreading\nthe canker of monotony in our life, that our only fear is lest it should\nnot be long enough to contain all the poetic creations of a love as rich\nand varied in its development as Nature herself. Of disappointment not\na trace! We find more pleasure in being together than on the first day,\nand each hour as it goes by discloses fresh reason for our love. Every\nday as we take our evening stroll after dinner, we tell each other that\nwe really must go and see what is doing in Paris, just as one might talk\nof going to Switzerland.\n\n\"Only think,\" Gaston will exclaim, \"such and such a boulevard is\nbeing made, the Madeleine is finished. We ought to see it. Let us go\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAnd to-morrow comes, and we are in no hurry to get up, and we breakfast\nin our bedroom. Then midday is on us, and it is too hot; a siesta seems\nappropriate. Then Gaston wishes to look at me, and he gazes on my face\nas though it were a picture, losing himself in this contemplation,\nwhich, as you may suppose, is not one-sided. Tears rise to the eyes\nof both as we think of our love and tremble. I am still the mistress,\npretending, that is, to give less than I receive, and I revel in this\ndeception. To a woman what can be sweeter than to see passion ever held\nin check by tenderness, and the man who is her master stayed, like a\ntimid suitor, by a word from her, within the limits that she chooses?\n\nYou asked me to describe him; but, Renee, it is not possible to make\na portrait of the man we love. How could the heart be kept out of the\nwork? Besides, to be frank between ourselves, we may admit that one of\nthe dire effects of civilization on our manners is to make of man in\nsociety a being so utterly different from the natural man of strong\nfeeling, that sometimes not a single point of likeness can be found\nbetween these two aspects of the same person. The man who falls into the\nmost graceful operatic poses, as he pours sweet nothings into your ear\nby the fire at night, may be entirely destitute of those more intimate\ncharms which a woman values. On the other hand, an ugly, boorish,\nbadly-dressed figure may mark a man endowed with the very genius of\nlove, and who has a perfect mastery over situations which might baffle\nus with our superficial graces. A man whose conventional aspect accords\nwith his real nature, who, in the intimacy of wedded love, possesses\nthat inborn grace which can be neither given nor acquired, but which\nGreek art has embodied in statuary, that careless innocence of the\nancient poets which, even in frank undress, seems to clothe the soul as\nwith a veil of modesty--this is our ideal, born of our own conceptions,\nand linked with the universal harmony which seems to be the reality\nunderlying all created things. To find this ideal in life is the problem\nwhich haunts the imagination of every woman--in Gaston I have found it.\n\nAh! dear, I did not know what love could be, united to youth, talent,\nand beauty. Gaston has no affectations, he moves with an instinctive and\nunstudied grace. When we walk alone together in the woods, his arm round\nmy waist, mine resting on his shoulder, body fitting to body, and head\ntouching head, our step is so even, uniform, and gentle, that those who\nsee us pass by night take the vision for a single figure gliding over\nthe graveled walks, like one of Homer's immortals. A like harmony exists\nin our desires, our thoughts, our words. More than once on some evening\nwhen a passing shower has left the leaves glistening and the moist grass\nbright with a more vivid green, it has chanced that we ended our walk\nwithout uttering a word, as we listened to the patter of falling drops\nand feasted our eyes on the scarlet sunset, flaring on the hilltops or\ndyeing with a warmer tone the gray of the tree trunks.\n\nBeyond a doubt our thoughts then rose to Heaven in silent prayer,\npleading as it were, for our happiness. At times a cry would escape\nus at the moment when some sudden bend on the path opened up fresh\nbeauties. What words can tell how honey-sweet, how full of meaning, is\na kiss half-timidly exchanged within the sanctuary of nature--it is as\nthough God had created us to worship in this fashion.\n\nAnd we return home, each more deeply in love than ever.\n\nA love so passionate between old married people would be an outrage on\nsociety in Paris; only in the heart of the woods, like lovers, can we\ngive scope to it.\n\nTo come to particulars, Gaston is of middle height--the height proper\nto all men of purpose. Neither stout nor thin, his figure is admirably\nmade, with ample fulness in the proportions, while every motion is\nagile; he leaps a ditch with the easy grace of a wild animal. Whatever\nhis attitude, he seems to have an instinctive sense of balance, and this\nis very rare in men who are given to thought. Though a dark man, he has\nan extraordinarily fair complexion; his jet-black hair contrasts finely\nwith the lustreless tints of the neck and forehead. He has the tragic\nhead of Louis XIII. His moustache and tuft have been allowed to grow,\nbut I made him shave the whiskers and beard, which were getting too\ncommon. An honorable poverty has been his safeguard, and handed him over\nto me, unsoiled by the loose life which ruins so many young men. His\nteeth are magnificent, and he has a constitution of iron. His keen\nblue eyes, for me full of tenderness, will flash like lightning at any\nrousing thought.\n\nLike all men of strong character and powerful mind, he has an admirable\ntemper; its evenness would surprise you, as it did me. I have listened\nto the tale of many a woman's home troubles; I have heard of the moods\nand depression of men dissatisfied with themselves, who either won't get\nold or age ungracefully, men who carry about through life the rankling\nmemory of some youthful excess, whose veins run poison and whose eyes\nare never frankly happy, men who cloak suspicion under bad temper, and\nmake their women pay for an hour's peace by a morning of annoyance, who\ntake vengeance on us for a beauty which is hateful to them because they\nhave ceased themselves to be attractive,--all these are horrors unknown\nto youth. They are the penalty of unequal unions. Oh! my dear, whatever\nyou do, don't marry Athenais to an old man!\n\nBut his smile--how I feast on it! A smile which is always there, yet\nalways fresh through the play of subtle fancy, a speaking smile which\nmakes of the lips a storehouse for thoughts of love and unspoken\ngratitude, a smile which links present joys to past. For nothing is\nallowed to drop out of our common life. The smallest works of nature\nhave become part and parcel of our joy. In these delightful woods\neverything is alive and eloquent of ourselves. An old moss-grown oak,\nnear the woodsman's house on the roadside, reminds us how we sat there,\nwearied, under its shade, while Gaston taught me about the mosses at our\nfeet and told me their story, till, gradually ascending from science to\nscience, we touched the very confines of creation.\n\nThere is something so kindred in our minds that they seem to me like\ntwo editions of the same book. You see what a literary tendency I have\ndeveloped! We both have the habit, or the gift, of looking at every\nsubject broadly, of taking in all its points of view, and the proof we\nare constantly giving ourselves of the singleness of our inward vision\nis an ever-new pleasure. We have actually come to look on this community\nof mind as a pledge of love; and if it ever failed us, it would mean as\nmuch to us as would a breach of fidelity in an ordinary home.\n\nMy life, full as it is of pleasures, would seem to you, nevertheless,\nextremely laborious. To begin with, my dear, you must know that\nLouise-Armande-Marie de Chaulieu does her own room. I could not bear\nthat a hired menial, some woman or girl from the outside, should become\ninitiated--literary touch again!--into the secrets of my bedroom. The\nveriest trifles connected with the worship of my heart partake of its\nsacred character. This is not jealousy; it is self-respect. Thus my\nroom is done out with all the care a young girl in love bestows on her\nperson, and with the precision of an old maid. My dressing-room is no\nchaos of litter; on the contrary, it makes a charming boudoir. My keen\neye has foreseen all contingencies. At whatever hour the lord and master\nenters, he will find nothing to distress, surprise, or shock him; he is\ngreeted by flowers, scents, and everything that can please the eye.\n\nI get up in the early dawn, while he is still sleeping, and, without\ndisturbing him, pass into the dressing-room, where, profiting by my\nmother's experience, I remove the traces of sleep by bathing in cold\nwater. For during sleep the skin, being less active, does not perform\nits functions adequately; it becomes warm and covered with a sort\nof mist or atmosphere of sticky matter, visible to the eye. From a\nsponge-bath a woman issues ten years younger, and this, perhaps, is the\ninterpretation of the myth of Venus rising from the sea. So the cold\nwater restores to me the saucy charm of dawn, and, having combed\nand scented my hair and made a most fastidious toilet, I glide back,\nsnake-like, in order that my master may find me, dainty as a spring\nmorning, at his wakening. He is charmed with this freshness, as of a\nnewly-opened flower, without having the least idea how it is produced.\n\nThe regular toilet of the day is a matter for my maid, and this takes\nplace later in a larger room, set aside for the purpose. As you may\nsuppose, there is also a toilet for going to bed. Three times a day, you\nsee, or it may be four, do I array myself for the delight of my husband;\nwhich, again, dear one, is suggestive of certain ancient myths.\n\nBut our work is not all play. We take a great deal of interest in our\nflowers, in the beauties of the hothouse, and in our trees. We give\nourselves in all seriousness to horticulture, and embosom the chalet in\nflowers, of which we are passionately fond. Our lawns are always green,\nour shrubberies as well tended as those of a millionaire. And nothing\nI assure you, can match the beauty of our walled garden. We are regular\ngluttons over our fruit, and watch with tender interest our Montreuil\npeaches, our hotbeds, our laden trellises, and pyramidal pear-trees.\n\nBut lest these rural pursuits should fail to satisfy my beloved's mind,\nI have advised him to finish, in the quiet of this retreat, some plays\nwhich were begun in his starvation days, and which are really very fine.\nThis is the only kind of literary work which can be done in odd moments,\nfor it requires long intervals of reflection, and does not demand\nthe elaborate pruning essential to a finished style. One can't make a\ntask-work of dialogue; there must be biting touches, summings-up, and\nflashes of wit, which are the blossoms of the mind, and come rather by\ninspiration than reflection. This sort of intellectual sport is very\nmuch in my line. I assist Gaston in his work, and in this way manage to\naccompany him even in the boldest flights of his imagination. Do you see\nnow how it is that my winter evenings never drag?\n\nOur servants have such an easy time, that never once since we were\nmarried have we had to reprimand any of them. When questioned about us,\nthey have had wit enough to draw on their imaginations, and have given\nus out as the companion and secretary of a lady and gentleman supposed\nto be traveling. They never go out without asking permission, which they\nknow will not be refused; they are contented too, and see plainly that\nit will be their own fault if there is a change for the worse. The\ngardeners are allowed to sell the surplus of our fruits and vegetables.\nThe dairymaid does the same with the milk, the cream, and the fresh\nbutter, on condition that the best of the produce is reserved for us.\nThey are well pleased with their profits, and we are delighted with an\nabundance which no money and no ingenuity can procure in that terrible\nParis, where it costs a hundred francs to produce a single fine peach.\n\nAll this is not without its meaning, my dear. I wish to fill the place\nof society to my husband; now society is amusing, and therefore his\nsolitude must not be allowed to pall on him. I believed myself jealous\nin the old days, when I merely allowed myself to be loved; now I know\nreal jealousy, the jealousy of the lover. A single indifferent glance\nunnerves me. From time to time I say to myself, \"Suppose he ceased to\nlove me!\" And a shudder goes through me. I tremble before him, as the\nChristian before his God.\n\nAlas! Renee, I am still without a child. The time will surely come--it\nmust come--when our hermitage will need a father's and a mother's care\nto brighten it, when we shall both pine to see the little frocks and\npelisses, the brown or golden heads, leaping, running through our\nshrubberies and flowery paths. Oh! it is a cruel jest of Nature's, a\nflowering tree that bears no fruit. The thought of your lovely children\ngoes through me like a knife. My life has grown narrower, while yours\nhas expanded and shed its rays afar. The passion of love is essentially\nselfish, while motherhood widens the circle of our feelings. How well\nI felt this difference when I read your kind, tender letter! To see you\nthus living in three hearts roused my envy. Yes, you are happy; you have\nhad wisdom to obey the laws of social life, whilst I stand outside, an\nalien.\n\nChildren, dear and loving children, can alone console a woman for the\nloss of her beauty. I shall soon be thirty, and at that age the dirge\nwithin begins. What though I am still beautiful, the limits of my\nwoman's reign are none the less in sight. When they are reached, what\nthen? I shall be forty before he is; I shall be old while he is still\nyoung. When this thought goes to my heart, I lie at his feet for an hour\nat a time, making him swear to tell me instantly if ever he feels his\nlove diminishing.\n\nBut he is a child. He swears, as though the mere suggestion were an\nabsurdity, and he is so beautiful that--Renee, you understand--I believe\nhim.\n\nGood-bye, sweet one. Shall we ever again let years pass without writing?\nHappiness is a monotonous theme, and that is, perhaps, the reason why,\nto souls who love, Dante appears even greater in the _Paradiso_ than in\nthe _Inferno_. I am not Dante; I am only your friend, and I don't\nwant to bore you. You can write, for in your children you have an\never-growing, every-varying source of happiness, while mine... No more\nof this. A thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nLIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. GASTON\n\nMy dear Louise,--I have read and re-read your letter, and the more\ndeeply I enter into its spirit, the clearer does it become to me that\nit is the letter, not of a woman, but of a child. You are the same old\nLouise, and you forget, what I used to repeat over and over again to\nyou, that the passion of love belongs rightly to a state of nature, and\nhas only been purloined by civilization. So fleeting is its character,\nthat the resources of society are powerless to modify its primitive\ncondition, and it becomes the effort of all noble minds to make a man\nof the infant Cupid. But, as you yourself admit, such love ceases to be\nnatural.\n\nSociety, my dear abhors sterility; but substituting a lasting sentiment\nfor the mere passing frenzy of nature, it has succeeded in creating\nthat greatest of all human inventions--the family, which is the enduring\nbasis of all organized society. To the accomplishment of this end, it\nhas sacrificed the individual, man as well as woman; for we must not\nshut our eyes to the fact that a married man devotes his energy, his\npower, and all his possession to his wife. Is it not she who reaps the\nbenefit of all his care? For whom, if not for her, are the luxury and\nwealth, the position and distinction, the comfort and the gaiety of the\nhome?\n\nOh! my sweet, once again you have taken the wrong turning in life. To be\nadored is a young girl's dream, which may survive a few springtimes; it\ncannot be that of the mature woman, the wife and mother. To a woman's\nvanity it is, perhaps, enough to know that she can command adoration if\nshe likes. If you would live the life of a wife and mother, return, I\nbeg of you, to Paris. Let me repeat my warning: It is not misfortune\nwhich you have to dread, as others do--it is happiness.\n\nListen to me, my child! It is the simple things of life--bread, air,\nsilence--of which we do not tire; they have no piquancy which can create\ndistaste; it is highly-flavored dishes which irritate the palate, and in\nthe end exhaust it. Were it possible that I should to-day be loved by\na man for whom I could conceive a passion, such as yours for Gaston, I\nwould still cling to the duties and the children, who are so dear to\nme. To a woman's heart the feelings of a mother are among the simple,\nnatural, fruitful, and inexhaustible things of life. I can recall\nthe day, now nearly fourteen years ago, when I embarked on a life of\nself-sacrifice with the despair of a shipwrecked mariner clinging to the\nmast of his vessel; now, as I invoke the memory of past years, I feel\nthat I would make the same choice again. No other guiding principle\nis so safe, or leads to such rich reward. The spectacle of your life,\nwhich, for all the romance and poetry with which you invest it, still\nremains based on nothing but a ruthless selfishness, has helped to\nstrengthen my convictions. This is the last time I shall speak to you in\nthis way; but I could not refrain from once more pleading with you when\nI found that your happiness had been proof against the most searching of\nall trials.\n\nAnd one more point I must urge on you, suggested by my meditations on\nyour retirement. Life, whether of the body or the heart, consists in\ncertain balanced movements. Any excess introduced into the working of\nthis routine gives rise either to pain or to pleasure, both of which are\na mere fever of the soul, bound to be fugitive because nature is not\nso framed as to support it long. But to make of life one long excess is\nsurely to choose sickness for one's portion. You are sick because you\nmaintain at the temperature of passion a feeling which marriage ought to\nconvert into a steadying, purifying influence.\n\nYes, my sweet, I see it clearly now; the glory of a home consists in\nthis very calm, this intimacy, this sharing alike of good and evil,\nwhich the vulgar ridicule. How noble was the reply of the Duchesse de\nSully, the wife of the great Sully, to some one who remarked that her\nhusband, for all his grave exterior, did not scruple to keep a mistress.\n\"What of that?\" she said. \"I represent the honor of the house, and\nshould decline to play the part of a courtesan there.\"\n\nBut you, Louise, who are naturally more passionate than tender, would\nbe at once the wife and the mistress. With the soul of a Heloise and the\npassions of a Saint Theresa, you slip the leash on all your impulses, so\nlong as they are sanctioned by law; in a word, you degrade the marriage\nrite. Surely the tables are turned. The reproaches you once heaped on me\nfor immorally, as you said, seizing the means of happiness from the\nvery outset of my wedded life, might be directed against yourself for\ngrasping at everything which may serve your passion. What! must nature\nand society alike be in bondage to your caprice? You are the old Louise;\nyou have never acquired the qualities which ought to be a woman's;\nself-willed and unreasonable as a girl, you introduce withal into your\nlove the keenest and most mercenary of calculations! Are you sure that,\nafter all, the price you ask for your toilets is not too high? All these\nprecautions are to my mind very suggestive of mistrust.\n\nOh, dear Louise, if only you knew the sweetness of a mother's efforts\nto discipline herself in kindness and gentleness to all about her! My\nproud, self-sufficing temper gradually dissolved into a soft melancholy,\nwhich in turn has been swallowed up by those delights of motherhood\nwhich have been its reward. If the early hours were toilsome, the\nevening will be tranquil and clear. My dread is lest the day of your\nlife should take the opposite course.\n\nWhen I had read your letter to a close, I prayed God to send you among\nus for a day, that you might see what family life really is, and learn\nthe nature of those joys, which are lasting and sweeter than tongue can\ntell, because they are genuine, simple, and natural. But, alas! what\nchance have I with the best of arguments against a fallacy which makes\nyou happy? As I write these words, my eyes fill with tears. I had felt\nso sure that some months of honeymoon would prove a surfeit and restore\nyou to reason. But I see that there is no limit to your appetite, and\nthat, having killed a man who loved you, you will not cease till you\nhave killed love itself. Farewell, dear misguided friend. I am in\ndespair that the letter which I hoped might reconcile you to society by\nits picture of my happiness should have brought forth only a paean of\nselfishness. Yes, your love is selfish; you love Gaston far less for\nhimself than for what he is to you.\n\n\n\n\nLIV. MME. GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE May 20th.\n\nRenee, calamity has come--no, that is no word for it--it has burst like\na thunderbolt over your poor Louise. You know what that means; calamity\nfor me is doubt; certainty would be death.\n\nThe day before yesterday, when I had finished my first toilet, I looked\neverywhere for Gaston to take a little turn with me before lunch, but\nin vain. I went to the stable, and there I saw his mare all in a lather,\nwhile the groom was removing the foam with a knife before rubbing her\ndown.\n\n\"Who in the world has put Fedelta in such a state?\" I asked.\n\n\"Master,\" replied the lad.\n\nI saw the mud of Paris on the mare's legs, for country mud is quite\ndifferent; and at once it flashed through me, \"He has been to Paris.\"\n\nThis thought raised a swarm of others in my heart, and it seemed as\nthough all the life in my body rushed there. To go to Paris without\ntelling me, at the hour when I leave him alone, to hasten there and back\nat such speed as to distress Fedelta. Suspicion clutched me in its iron\ngrip, till I could hardly breathe. I walked aside a few steps to a seat,\nwhere I tried to recover my self-command.\n\nHere Gaston found me, apparently pale and fluttered, for he immediately\nexclaimed, \"What is wrong?\" in a tone of such alarm, that I rose and\ntook his arm. But my muscles refused to move, and I was forced to sit\ndown again. Then he took me in his arms and carried me to the parlor\nclose by, where the frightened servants pressed after us, till Gaston\nmotioned them away. Once left to ourselves, I refused to speak, but was\nable to reach my room, where I shut myself in, to weep my fill. Gaston\nremained something like two hours at my door, listening to my sobs\nand questioning with angelic patience his poor darling, who made no\nresponse.\n\nAt last I told him that I would see him when my eyes were less red and\nmy voice was steady again.\n\nMy formal words drove him from the house. But by the time I had bathed\nmy eyes in iced water and cooled my face, I found him in our room, the\ndoor into which was open, though I had heard no steps. He begged me to\ntell him what was wrong.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said; \"I saw the mud of Paris on Fedelta's trembling legs;\nit seemed strange that you should go there without telling me; but, of\ncourse, you are free.\"\n\n\"I shall punish you for such wicked thoughts by not giving any\nexplanation till to-morrow,\" he replied.\n\n\"Look at me,\" I said.\n\nMy eyes met his; deep answered to deep. No, not a trace of the cloud of\ndisloyalty which, rising from the soul, must dim the clearness of the\neye. I feigned satisfaction, though really unconvinced. It is not women\nonly who can lie and dissemble!\n\nThe whole of the day we spent together. Ever and again, as I looked\nat him, I realized how fast my heart-strings were bound to him. How\nI trembled and fluttered within when, after a moment's absence, he\nreappeared. I live in him, not in myself. My cruel sufferings gave the\nlie to your unkind letter. Did I ever feel my life thus bound up in the\nnoble Spaniard, who adored me, as I adore this heartless boy? I hate\nthat mare! Fool that I was to keep horses! But the next thing would have\nbeen to lame Gaston or imprison him in the cottage. Wild thoughts like\nthese filled my brain; you see how near I was to madness! If love be\nnot the cage, what power on earth can hold back the man who wants to be\nfree?\n\nI asked him point-blank, \"Do I bore you?\"\n\n\"What needless torture you give yourself!\" was his reply, while he\nlooked at me with tender, pitying eyes. \"Never have I loved you so\ndeeply.\"\n\n\"If that is true, my beloved, let me sell Fedelta,\" I answered.\n\n\"Sell her, by all means!\"\n\nThe reply crushed me. Was it not a covert taunt at my wealth and his\nown nothingness in the house? This may never have occurred to him, but\nI thought it had, and once more I left him. It was night, and I would go\nto bed.\n\nOh! Renee, to be alone with a harrowing thought drives one to thoughts\nof death. These charming gardens, the starry night, the cool air, laden\nwith incense from our wealth of flowers, our valley, our hills--all\nseemed to me gloomy, black, and desolate. It was as though I lay at the\nfoot of a precipice, surrounded by serpents and poisonous plants, and\nsaw no God in the sky. Such a night ages a woman.\n\nNext morning I said:\n\n\"Take Fedelta and be off to Paris! Don't sell her; I love her. Does she\nnot carry you?\"\n\nBut he was not deceived; my tone betrayed the storm of feeling which I\nstrove to conceal.\n\n\"Trust me!\" he replied; and the gesture with which he held out his hand,\nthe glance of his eye, were so full of loyalty that I was overcome.\n\n\"What petty creatures women are!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"No, you love me, that is all,\" he said, pressing me to his heart.\n\n\"Go to Paris without me,\" I said, and this time I made him understand\nthat my suspicions were laid aside.\n\nHe went; I thought he would have stayed. I won't attempt to tell you\nwhat I suffered. I found a second self within, quite strange to me. A\ncrisis like this has, for the woman who loves, a tragic solemnity that\nbaffles words; the whole of life rises before you then, and you search\nin vain for any horizon to it; the veriest trifle is big with meaning, a\nglance contains a volume, icicles drift on uttered words, and the death\nsentence is read in a movement of the lips.\n\nI thought he would have paid me back in kind; had I not been\nmagnanimous? I climbed to the top of the chalet, and my eyes followed\nhim on the road. Ah! my dear Renee, he vanished from my sight with an\nappalling swiftness.\n\n\"How keen he is to go!\" was the thought that sprang of itself.\n\nOnce more alone, I fell back into the hell of possibilities, the\nmaelstrom of mistrust. There were moments when I would have welcomed\nany certainty, even the worst, as a relief from the torture of suspense.\nSuspense is a duel carried on in the heart, and we give no quarter to\nourselves.\n\nI paced up and down the walks. I returned to the house, only to tear\nout again, like a mad woman. Gaston, who left at seven o'clock, did not\nreturn till eleven. Now, as it only takes half an hour to reach Paris\nthrough the park of St. Cloud and the Bois de Boulogne, it is plain that\nhe must have spent three hours in town. He came back radiant, with a\nwhip in his hand for me, an india-rubber whip with a gold handle.\n\nFor a fortnight I had been without a whip, my old one being worn and\nbroken.\n\n\"Was it for this you tortured me?\" I said, as I admired the workmanship\nof this beautiful ornament, which contains a little scent-box at one\nend.\n\nThen it flashed on me that the present was a fresh artifice.\nNevertheless I threw myself at once on his neck, not without reproaching\nhim gently for having caused me so much pain for the sake of a trifle.\nHe was greatly pleased with his ingenuity; his eyes and his whole\nbearing plainly showed the restrained triumph of the successful plotter;\nfor there is a radiance of the soul which is reflected in every feature\nand turn of the body. While still examining the beauties of this work of\nart, I asked him at a moment when we happened to be looking each other\nin the face:\n\n\"Who is the artist?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see it has been mounted by Verdier,\" and I read the name of the\nshop printed on the handle.\n\nGaston is nothing but a child yet. He blushed, and I made much of him\nas a reward for the shame he felt in deceiving me. I pretended to notice\nnothing, and he may well have thought the incident was over.\n\nMay 25th.\n\nThe next morning I was in my riding-habit by six o'clock, and by seven\nlanded at Verdier's, where several whips of the same pattern were shown\nto me. One of the men serving recognized mine when I pointed it out to\nhim.\n\n\"We sold that yesterday to a young gentleman,\" he said. And from the\ndescription I gave him of my traitor Gaston, not a doubt was left of his\nidentity. I will spare you the palpitations which rent my heart during\nthat journey to Paris and the little scene there, which marked the\nturning-point of my life.\n\nBy half-seven I was home again, and Gaston found me, fresh and blooming,\nin my morning dress, sauntering about with a make-believe nonchalance. I\nfelt confident that old Philippe, who had been taken into my confidence,\nwould not have betrayed my absence.\n\n\"Gaston,\" I said, as we walked by the side of the lake, \"you cannot\nblind me to the difference between a work of art inspired by friendship\nand something which has been cast in a mould.\"\n\nHe turned white, and fixed his eyes on me rather than on the damaging\npiece of evidence I thrust before them.\n\n\"My dear,\" I went on, \"this is not a whip; it is a screen behind which\nyou are hiding something from me.\"\n\nThereupon I gave myself the gratification of watching his hopeless\nentanglement in the coverts and labyrinths of deceit and the desperate\nefforts he made to find some wall he might scale and thus escape. In\nvain; he had perforce to remain upon the field, face to face with an\nadversary, who at last laid down her arms in a feigned complacence. But\nit was too late. The fatal mistake, against which my mother had tried to\nwarm me, was made. My jealousy, exposed in all its nakedness, had led\nto war and all its stratagems between Gaston and myself. Jealousy, dear,\nhas neither sense nor decency.\n\nI made up my mind now to suffer in silence, but to keep my eyes open,\nuntil my doubts were resolved one way or another. Then I would either\nbreak with Gaston or bow to my misfortune: no middle course is possible\nfor a woman who respects herself.\n\nWhat can he be concealing? For a secret there is, and the secret has\nto do with a woman. Is it some youthful escapade for which he still\nblushes? But if so, what? The word _what_ is written in letters of\nfire on all I see. I read it in the glassy water of my lake, in the\nshrubbery, in the clouds, on the ceilings, at table, in the flowers of\nthe carpets. A voice cries to me _what?_ in my sleep. Dating from the\nmorning of my discovery, a cruel interest has sprung into our lives, and\nI have become familiar with the bitterest thought that can corrode the\nheart--the thought of treachery in him one loves. Oh! my dear, there is\nheaven and hell together in such a life. Never had I felt this scorching\nflame, I to whom love had appeared only in the form of devoutest\nworship.\n\n\"So you wished to know the gloomy torture-chamber of pain!\" I said to\nmyself. Good, the spirits of evil have heard your prayer; go on your\nroad, unhappy wretch!\n\nMay 30th.\n\nSince that fatal day Gaston no longer works with the careless ease of\nthe wealthy artist, whose work is merely pastime; he sets himself tasks\nlike a professional writer. Four hours a day he devotes to finishing his\ntwo plays.\n\n\"He wants money!\"\n\nA voice within whispered the thought. But why? He spends next to\nnothing; we have absolutely no secrets from each other; there is not a\ncorner of his study which my eyes and my fingers may not explore. His\nyearly expenditure does not amount to two thousand francs, and I know\nthat he has thirty thousand, I can hardly say laid by, but scattered\nloose in a drawer. You can guess what is coming. At midnight, while he\nwas sleeping, I went to see if the money was still there. An icy shiver\nran through me. The drawer was empty.\n\nThat same week I discovered that he went to Sevres to fetch his letters,\nand these letters he must tear up immediately; for though I am a very\nFigaro in contrivances, I have never yet seen a trace of one. Alas! my\nsweet, despite the fine promises and vows by which I bound myself after\nthe scene of the whip, an impulse, which I can only call madness, drove\nme to follow him in one of his rapid rides to the post-office. Gaston\nwas appalled to be thus discovered on horseback, paying the postage of a\nletter which he held in his hand. He looked fixedly at me, and then put\nspurs to Fedelta. The pace was so hard that I felt shaken to bits when I\nreached the lodge gate, though my mental agony was such at the time that\nit might well have dulled all consciousness of bodily pain. Arrived at\nthe gate, Gaston said nothing; he rang the bell and waited without a\nword. I was more dead than alive. I might be mistaken or I might not,\nbut in neither case was it fitting for Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu\nto play the spy. I had sunk to the level of the gutter, by the side of\ncourtesans, opera-dancers, mere creatures of instinct; even the vulgar\nshop-girl or humble seamstress might look down on me.\n\nWhat a moment! At last the door opened; he handed his horse to the\ngroom, and I also dismounted, but into his arms, which were stretched\nout to receive me. I threw my skirt over my left arm, gave him my right,\nand we walked on--still in silence. The few steps we thus took might\nbe reckoned to me for a hundred years of purgatory. A swarm of thoughts\nbeset me as I walked, now seeming to take visible form in tongues of\nfire before my eyes, now assailing my mind, each with its own poisoned\ndart. When the groom and the horses were far away, I stopped Gaston,\nand, looking him in the face, said, as I pointed, with a gesture that\nyou should have seen, to the fatal letter still in his right hand:\n\n\"May I read it?\"\n\nHe gave it to me. I opened it and found a letter from Nathan, the\ndramatic author, informing Gaston that a play of his had been accepted,\nlearned, rehearsed, and would be produced the following Saturday. He\nalso enclosed a box ticket.\n\nThough for me this was the opening of heaven's gates to the martyr, yet\nthe fiend would not leave me in peace, but kept crying, \"Where are the\nthirty thousand francs?\" It was a question which self-respect, dignity,\nall my old self in fact, prevented me from uttering. If my thought\nbecame speech, I might as well throw myself into the lake at once, and\nyet I could hardly keep the words down. Dear friend, was not this a\ntrial passing the strength of woman?\n\nI returned the letter, saying:\n\n\"My poor Gaston, you are getting bored down here. Let us go back to\nParis, won't you?\"\n\n\"To Paris?\" he said. \"But why? I only wanted to find out if I had any\ngift, to taste the flowing bowl of success!\"\n\nNothing would be easier than for me to ransack the drawer sometime while\nhe is working and pretend great surprise at finding the money gone.\nBut that would be going half-way to meet the answer, \"Oh! my friend\nSo-and-So was hard up!\" etc., which a man of Gaston's quick wit would\nnot have far to seek.\n\nThe moral, my dear, is that the brilliant success of this play, which\nall Paris is crowding to see, is due to us, though the whole credit goes\nto Nathan. I am represented by one of the two stars in the legend: Et M\n* *. I saw the first night from the depths of one of the stage boxes.\n\nJuly 1st.\n\nGaston's work and his visits to Paris shall continue. He is preparing\nnew plays, partly because he wants a pretext for going to Paris, partly\nin order to make money. Three plays have been accepted, and two more are\ncommissioned.\n\nOh! my dear, I am lost, all is darkness around me. I would set fire to\nthe house in a moment if that would bring light. What does it all mean?\nIs he ashamed of taking money from me? He is too high-minded for so\ntrumpery a matter to weigh with him. Besides, scruples of the kind could\nonly be the outcome of some love affair. A man would take anything from\nhis wife, but from the woman he has ceased to care for, or is thinking\nof deserting, it is different. If he needs such large sums, it must be\nto spend them on a woman. For himself, why should he hesitate to draw\nfrom my purse? Our savings amount to one hundred thousand francs!\n\nIn short, my sweetheart, I have explored a whole continent of\npossibilities, and after carefully weighing all the evidence, am\nconvinced I have a rival. I am deserted--for whom? At all costs I must\nsee the unknown.\n\nJuly 10th.\n\nLight has come, and it is all over with me. Yes, Renee, at the age of\nthirty, in the perfection of my beauty, with all the resources of\na ready wit and the seductive charms of dress at my command, I am\nbetrayed--and for whom? A large-boned Englishwoman, with big feet and\nthick waist--a regular British cow! There is no longer room for doubt. I\nwill tell you the history of the last few days.\n\nWorn out with suspicions, which were fed by Gaston's guilty silence\n(for, if he had helped a friend, why keep it a secret from me?), his\ninsatiable desire for money, and his frequent journeys to Paris; jealous\ntoo of the work from which he seemed unable to tear himself, I at last\nmade up my mind to take certain steps, of such a degrading nature that\nI cannot tell you about them. Suffice it to say that three days ago I\nascertained that Gaston, when in Paris, visits a house in the Rue de\nla Ville l'Eveque, where he guards his mistress with jealous mystery,\nunexampled in Paris. The porter was surly, and I could get little out of\nhim, but that little was enough to put an end to any lingering hope, and\nwith hope to life. On this point my mind was resolved, and I only waited\nto learn the whole truth first.\n\nWith this object I went to Paris and took rooms in a house exactly\nopposite the one which Gaston visits. Thence I saw him with my own eyes\nenter the courtyard on horseback. Too soon a ghastly fact forced itself\non me. This Englishwoman, who seems to me about thirty-six, is known as\nMme. Gaston. This discovery was my deathblow.\n\nI saw him next walking to the Tuileries with a couple of children. Oh!\nmy dear, two children, the living images of Gaston! The likeness is\nso strong that it bears scandal on the face of it. And what pretty\nchildren! in their handsome English costumes! She is the mother of his\nchildren. Here is the key to the whole mystery.\n\nThe woman herself might be a Greek statue, stepped down from some\nmonument. Cold and white as marble, she moves sedately with a mother's\npride. She is undeniably beautiful but heavy as a man-of-war. There\nis no breeding or distinction about her; nothing of the English lady.\nProbably she is a farmer's daughter from some wretched and remote\ncountry village, or, it may be, the eleventh child of some poor\nclergyman!\n\nI reached home, after a miserable journey, during which all sorts of\nfiendish thoughts had me at their mercy, with hardly any life left in\nme. Was she married? Did he know her before our marriage? Had she been\ndeserted by some rich man, whose mistress she was, and thus thrown back\nupon Gaston's hands? Conjectures without end flitted through my brain,\nas though conjecture were needed in the presence of the children.\n\nThe next day I returned to Paris, and by a free use of my purse\nextracted from the porter the information that Mme. Gaston was legally\nmarried.\n\nHis reply to my question took the form, \"Yes, _Miss_.\"\n\nJuly 15th.\n\nMy dear, my love for Gaston is stronger than ever since that morning,\nand he has every appearance of being still more deeply in love. He is\nso young! A score of times it has been on my lips, when we rise in the\nmorning, to say, \"Then you love me better than the lady of the Rue de\nla Ville l'Eveque?\" But I dare not explain to myself why the words are\nchecked on my tongue.\n\n\"Are you very fond of children?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" was his reply; \"but children will come!\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I have consulted the best doctors, and they agree in advising me to\ntravel for a couple of months.\"\n\n\"Gaston,\" I said, \"if love in absence had been possible for me, do you\nsuppose I should ever have left the convent?\"\n\nHe laughed; but as for me, dear, the word \"travel\" pierced my heart.\nRather, far rather, would I leap from the top of the house than be\nrolled down the staircase, step by step.--Farewell, my sweetheart. I\nhave arranged for my death to be easy and without horrors, but certain.\nI made my will yesterday. You can come to me now, the prohibition is\nremoved. Come, then, and receive my last farewell. I will not die by\ninches; my death, like my life, shall bear the impress of dignity and\ngrace.\n\nGood-bye, dear sister soul, whose affection has never wavered nor grown\nweary, but has been the constant tender moonlight of my soul. If the\nintensity of passion has not been ours, at least we have been spared its\nvenomous bitterness. How rightly you have judged of life! Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nLV. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. GASTON July 16th.\n\nMy dear Louise,--I send this letter by an express before hastening\nto the chalet myself. Take courage. Your last letter seemed to me so\nfrantic, that I thought myself justified, under the circumstances, in\nconfiding all to Louis; it was a question of saving you from yourself.\nIf the means we have employed have been, like yours, repulsive, yet the\nresult is so satisfactory that I am certain you will approve. I went so\nfar as to set the police to work, but the whole thing remains a secret\nbetween the prefect, ourselves and you.\n\nIn one word, Gaston is a jewel! But here are the facts. His brother,\nLouis Gaston, died at Calcutta, while in the service of a mercantile\ncompany, when he was on the very point of returning to France, a rich,\nprosperous, married man, having received a very large fortune with his\nwife, who was the widow of an English merchant. For ten years he had\nworked hard that he might be able to send home enough to support his\nbrother, to whom he was devotedly attached, and from whom his letters\ngenerously concealed all his trials and disappointments.\n\nThen came the failure of the great Halmer house; the widow was ruined,\nand the sudden shock affected Louis Gaston's brain. He had no mental\nenergy left to resist the disease which attacked him, and he died in\nBengal, whither he had gone to try and realize the remnants of his\nwife's property. The dear, good fellow had deposited with a banker\na first sum of three hundred thousand francs, which was to go to his\nbrother, but the banker was involved in the Halmer crash, and thus their\nlast resource failed them.\n\nLouis' widow, the handsome woman whom you took for your rival, arrived\nin Paris with two children--your nephews--and an empty purse, her\nmother's jewels having barely sufficed to pay for bringing them over.\nThe instructions which Louis Gaston had given the banker for sending\nthe money to his brother enabled the widow to find your husband's former\nhome. As Gaston had disappeared without leaving any address, Mme. Louis\nGaston was directed to d'Arthez, the only person who could give any\ninformation about him.\n\nD'Arthez was the more ready to relieve the young woman's pressing needs,\nbecause Louis Gaston, at the time of his marriage four years before, had\nwritten to make inquiries about his brother from the famous author, whom\nhe knew to be one of his friends. The Captain had consulted d'Arthez as\nto the best means of getting the money safely transferred to Marie, and\nd'Arthez had replied, telling him that Gaston was now a rich man through\nhis marriage with the Baronne de Macumer. The personal beauty, which\nwas the mother's rich heritage to her sons, had saved them both--one\nin India, the other in Paris--from destitution. A touching story, is it\nnot?\n\nD'Arthez naturally wrote, after a time, to tell your husband of the\ncondition of his sister-in-law and her children, informing him, at the\nsame time, of the generous intentions of the Indian Gaston towards his\nParis brother, which an unhappy chance had frustrated. Gaston, as you\nmay imagine, hurried off to Paris. Here is the first ride accounted for.\nDuring the last five years he had saved fifty thousand francs out of the\nincome you forced him to accept, and this sum he invested in the public\nfunds under the names of his two nephews, securing them each, in\nthis way, an income of twelve hundred francs. Next he furnished his\nsister-in-law's rooms, and promised her a quarterly allowance of three\nthousand francs. Here you see the meaning of his dramatic labors and the\npleasure caused him by the success of his first play.\n\nMme. Gaston, therefore, is no rival of yours, and has every right to\nyour name. A man of Gaston's sensitive delicacy was bound to keep the\naffair secret from you, knowing as he did, your generous nature. Nor\ndoes he look on what you give him as his own. D'Arthez read me the\nletter he had from your husband, asking him to be one of the witnesses\nat his marriage. Gaston in this declares that his happiness would have\nbeen perfect but for the one drawback of his poverty and indebtedness\nto you. A virgin soul is at the mercy of such scruples. Either they make\nthemselves felt or they do not; and when they do, it is easy to imagine\nthe conflict of feeling and embarrassment to which they give rise.\nNothing is more natural than Gaston's wish to provide in secret a\nsuitable maintenance for the woman who is his brother's widow, and who\nhad herself set aside one hundred thousand francs for him from her own\nfortune. She is a handsome woman, warm-hearted, and extremely well-bred,\nbut not clever. She is a mother; and, you may be sure, I lost my heart\nto her at first sight when I found her with one child in her arms, and\nthe other dressed like a little lord. The children first! is written in\nevery detail of her house.\n\nFar from being angry, therefore, with your beloved husband, you should\nfind in all this fresh reason for loving him. I have met him, and think\nhim the most delightful young fellow in Paris. Yes! dear child, when I\nsaw him, I had no difficulty in understanding that a woman might lose\nher head about him; his soul is mirrored in his countenance. If I were\nyou, I should settle the widow and her children at the chalet, in a\npretty little cottage which you could have built for them, and adopt the\nboys!\n\nBe at peace, then, dear soul, and plan this little surprise, in your\nturn, for Gaston.\n\n\n\n\nLVI. MME. GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nAh! my dear friend, what can I say in answer except the cruel _\"It is\ntoo late\"_ of that fool Lafayette to his royal master? Oh! my life,\nmy sweet life, what physician will give it back to me. My own hand has\ndealt the deathblow. Alas! have I not been a mere will-o'-the-wisp,\nwhose twinkling spark was fated to perish before it reached a flame? My\neyes rain torrents of tears--and yet they must not fall when I am with\nhim. I fly to him, and he seeks me. My despair is all within. This\ntorture Dante forgot to place in his _Inferno._ Come to see me die!\n\n\n\n\nLVII. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE COMTE DE L'ESTORADE THE CHALET,\nAugust 7th.\n\nMy love,--Take the children away to Provence without me; I remain with\nLouise, who has only a few days yet to live. I cannot leave either her\nor her husband, for whose reason I fear.\n\nYou know the scrap of letter which sent me flying to Ville d'Avray,\npicking up the doctors on my way. Since then I have not left my darling\nfriend, and it has been impossible to write to you, for I have sat up\nevery night for a fortnight.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found her with Gaston, in full dress, beautiful,\nlaughing, happy. It was a heroic falsehood! They were like two lovely\nchildren together in their restored confidence. For a moment I was\ndeceived, like Gaston, by the effrontery; but Louise pressed my hand,\nwhispering:\n\n\"He must not know; I am dying.\"\n\nAn icy chill fell over me as I felt her burning hand and saw the red\nspots on her cheeks. I congratulated myself on my prudence in leaving\nthe doctors in the wood till they should be sent for.\n\n\"Leave us for a little,\" she said to Gaston. \"Two women who have not met\nfor five years have plenty of secrets to talk over, and Renee, I have no\ndoubt, has things to confide in me.\"\n\nDirectly we were alone, she flung herself into my arms, unable longer to\nrestrain her tears.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" I said. \"I have brought with me, in case of need,\nthe best surgeon and the best physician from the hospital, and Bianchon\nas well; there are four altogether.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried, \"have them in at once if they can save me, if there is\nstill time. The passion which hurried me to death now cries for life!\"\n\n\"But what have you done to yourself?\"\n\n\"I have in a few days brought myself to the last stage of consumption.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I got myself into a profuse perspiration in the night, and then ran out\nand lay down by the side of the lake in the dew. Gaston thinks I have a\ncold, and I am dying!\"\n\n\"Send him to Paris; I will fetch the doctors myself,\" I said, as I\nrushed out wildly to the spot where I had left them.\n\nAlas! my love, after the consultation was over, not one of the doctors\ngave me the least hope; they all believe that Louise will die with the\nfall of the leaves. The dear child's constitution has wonderfully helped\nthe success of her plan. It seems she has a predisposition to this\ncomplaint; and though, in the ordinary course, she might have lived a\nlong time, a few days' folly has made the case desperate.\n\nI cannot tell you what I felt on hearing this sentence, based on such\nclear explanations. You know that I have lived in Louise as much as in\nmy own life. I was simply crushed, and could not stir to escort to the\ndoor these harbingers of evil. I don't know how long I remained lost\nin bitter thoughts, the tears running down my cheeks, when I was roused\nfrom my stupor by the words:\n\n\"So there is no hope for me!\" in a clear, angelic voice.\n\nIt was Louise, with her hand on my shoulder. She made me get up, and\ncarried me off to her small drawing-room. With a beseeching glance, she\nwent on:\n\n\"Stay with me to the end; I won't have doleful faces round me. Above\nall, I must keep the truth from _him_. I know that I have the strength\nto do it. I am full of youth and spirit, and can die standing! For\nmyself, I have no regrets. I am dying as I wished to die, still young\nand beautiful, in the perfection of my womanhood.\n\n\"As for him, I can see very well now that I should have made his\nlife miserable. Passion has me in its grips, like a struggling fawn,\nimpatient of the toils. My groundless jealousy has already wounded\nhim sorely. When the day came that my suspicions met only\nindifference--which in the long run is the rightful meed of all\njealousy--well, that would have been my death. I have had my share of\nlife. There are people whose names on the muster-roll of the world show\nsixty years of service, and yet in all that time they have not had\ntwo years of real life, whilst my record of thirty is doubled by the\nintensity of my love.\n\n\"Thus for him, as well as for me, the close is a happy one. But between\nus, dear Renee, it is different. You lose a loving sister, and that is a\nloss which nothing can repair. You alone here have the right to mourn my\ndeath.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, during which I could only see her through a mist of\ntears, she continued:\n\n\"The moral of my death is a cruel one. My dear doctor in petticoats was\nright; marriage cannot rest upon passion as its foundation, nor even\nupon love. How fine and noble is your life! keeping always to the one\nsafe road, you give your husband an ever-growing affection; while the\npassionate eagerness with which I threw myself into wedded life was\nbound in nature to diminish. Twice have I gone astray, and twice has\nDeath stretched forth his bony hand to strike my happiness. The first\ntime, he robbed me of the noblest and most devoted of men; now it is my\nturn, the grinning monster tears me from the arms of my poet husband,\nwith all his beauty and his grace.\n\n\"Yet I would not complain. Have I not known in turn two men, each the\nvery pattern of nobility--one in mind, the other in outward form? In\nFelipe, the soul dominated and transformed the body; in Gaston, one\ncould not say which was supreme--heart, mind, or grace of form. I die\nadored--what more could I wish for? Time, perhaps, in which to draw near\nthe God of whom I may have too little thought. My spirit will take its\nflight towards Him, full of love, and with the prayer that some day, in\nthe world above, He will unite me once more to the two who made a heaven\nof my life below. Without them, paradise would be a desert to me.\n\n\"To others, my example would be fatal, for mine was no common lot. To\nmeet a Felipe or a Gaston is more than mortals can expect, and therefore\nthe doctrine of society in regard to marriage accords with the natural\nlaw. Woman is weak, and in marrying she ought to make an entire\nsacrifice of her will to the man who, in return, should lay his\nselfishness at her feet. The stir which women of late years have created\nby their whining and insubordination is ridiculous, and only shows how\nwell we deserve the epithet of children, bestowed by philosophers on our\nsex.\"\n\nShe continued talking thus in the gentle voice you know so well,\nuttering the gravest truths in the prettiest manner, until Gaston\nentered, bringing with him his sister-in-law, the two children, and\nthe English nurse, whom, at Louise's request, he had been to fetch from\nParis.\n\n\"Here are the pretty instruments of my torture,\" she said, as her\nnephews approached. \"Was not the mistake excusable? What a wonderful\nlikeness to their uncle!\"\n\nShe was most friendly to Mme. Gaston the elder and begged that she would\nlook upon the chalet as her home; in short, she played the hostess to\nher in her best de Chaulieu manner, in which no one can rival her.\n\nI wrote at once to the Duc and Duchesse de Chaulieu, the Duc de Rhetore,\nand the Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry, as well as to Madeleine. It was time.\nNext day, Louise, worn out with so much exertion, was unable to go\nout; indeed, she only got up for dinner. In the course of the evening,\nMadeleine de Lenoncourt, her two brothers, and her mother arrived. The\ncoolness which Louise's second marriage had caused between herself and\nher family disappeared. Every day since that evening, Louise's father\nand both her brothers have ridden over in the morning, and the two\nduchesses spend all their evenings at the chalet. Death unites as well\nas separates; it silences all paltry feeling.\n\nLouise is perfection in her charm, her grace, her good sense, her wit,\nand her tenderness. She has retained to the last that perfect tact for\nwhich she has been so famous, and she lavishes on us the treasures of\nher brilliant mind, which made her one of the queens of Paris.\n\n\"I should like to look well even in my coffin,\" she said with her\nmatchless smile, as she lay down on the bed where she was to linger for\na fortnight.\n\nHer room has nothing of the sick-chamber in it; medicines, ointments,\nthe whole apparatus of nursing, is carefully concealed.\n\n\"Is not my deathbed pretty!\" she said to the Sevres priest who came to\nconfess her.\n\nWe gloated over her like misers. All this anxiety, and the terrible\ntruths which dawned on him, have prepared Gaston for the worst. He is\nfull of courage, but the blow has gone home. It would not surprise me\nto see him follow his wife in the natural course. Yesterday, as we were\nwalking round the lake, he said to me:\n\n\"I must be a father to those two children,\" and he pointed to his\nsister-in-law, who was taking the boys for a walk. \"But though I shall\ndo nothing to hasten my end, I want your promise that you will be a\nsecond mother to them, and will persuade your husband to accept the\noffice of guardian, which I shall depute to him in conjunction with my\nsister-in-law.\"\n\nHe said this quite simply, like a man who knows he is not long for this\nworld. He has smiles on his face to meet Louise's, and it is only I whom\nhe does not deceive. He is a mate for her in courage.\n\nLouise has expressed a wish to see her godson, but I am not sorry he\nshould be in Provence; she might want to remember him generously, and I\nshould be in a great difficulty.\n\nGood-bye, my love.\n\nAugust 25th (her birthday).\n\nYesterday evening Louise was delirious for a short time; but her\ndelirium was the prettiest babbling, which shows that even the madness\nof gifted people is not that of fools or nobodies. In a mere thread of\na voice she sang some Italian airs from _I Puritani, La Sonnambula,\nMoise_, while we stood round the bed in silence. Not one of us, not even\nthe Duc de Rhetore, had dry eyes, so clear was it to us all that her\nsoul was in this fashion passing from us. She could no longer see us!\nYet she was there still in the charm of the faint melody, with its\nsweetness not of this earth.\n\nDuring the night the death agony began. It is now seven in the morning,\nand I have just myself raised her from bed. Some flicker of strength\nrevived; she wished to sit by her window, and asked for Gaston's hand.\nAnd then, my love, the sweetest spirit whom we shall ever see on this\nearth departed, leaving us the empty shell.\n\nThe last sacrament had been administered the evening before, unknown to\nGaston, who was taking a snatch of sleep during this agonizing ceremony;\nand after she was moved to the window, she asked me to read her the _De\nProfundis_ in French, while she was thus face to face with the lovely\nscene, which was her handiwork. She repeated the words after me to\nherself, and pressed the hands of her husband, who knelt on the other\nside of the chair.\n\nAugust 26th.\n\nMy heart is broken. I have just seen her in her winding-sheet; her\nface is quite pale now with purple shadows. Oh! I want my children! my\nchildren! Bring me my children!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\n     The following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Arthez, Daniel d'\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       The Member for Arcis\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n\n     Beauseant, Marquise de\n       The Deserted Woman\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Honorine\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Country Parson\n     In addition, M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1338,"split":"test"}
