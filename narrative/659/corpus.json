{"ori_id":"9cbe9d08ff6673e8dba308ac11ba88d71b425209","title":"Last Tango in Paris","context":"Last Tango in Paris\n Paul (Marlon Brando), a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning his wife's suicide, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne (Maria Schneider) at an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul takes the apartment after they begin an anonymous sexual relationship there. He insists that neither of them must share any personal information, even given names. The affair continues until one day, Jeanne arrives at the apartment and finds that Paul has packed up and left without warning.\nPaul later meets Jeanne on the street and says he wants to renew the relationship. He tells her of the recent tragedy of his wife. As he tells his life story, they walk into a tango bar, where he continues telling her about himself. The loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about their relationship. She tells Paul she does not want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her back to her apartment, where he tells her he loves her and wants to know her name.\nJeanne takes a gun from a drawer. She tells Paul her name and shoots him. Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses. As Paul dies, a dazed Jeanne mutters to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her and she did not know who he was, as if in a rehearsal, preparing herself for questioning by the police.\n<html>\n<head><title>Last Tango in Paris Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Last Tango in Paris script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Last Tango in Paris script, Last Tango in Paris movie script, Last Tango in Paris film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

And she\n           used to hunt for rabbits in that\n           field but she couldn't see them. So\n           she'd have to leap up in this\n           mustard field and look around very\n           quickly to see where the rabbits\n           were.

For\n          five years, I was more a guest in\n          this fucking flophouse than a\n          husband. With privileges, of\n          course. And then, to help me\n          understand you, you let me inherit\n          Marcel. The husband's double, whose\n          room was the double of ours. And\n          you know what? I didn't even have\n          the guts to ask him. Didn't have\n          the guts to ask him if the same\n          numbers you and I did were the same\n          numbers you did with him. Our\n          marriage was nothing more than a\n          foxhole for you. And all it took\n          for you to get out was a -cent\n          razor and a tub full of water. You\n          cheap, goddamn, fucking,\n          godforsaken whore. I hope you rot\n          in hell. You're worse than the\n          dirtiest street pig anybody could\n          find, and you know why? You know\n          why? Because you lied. You lied to\n          me and I trusted you. You lied. You\n          knew you were lying! Go on, tell me\n          you didn't lie. Haven't you got\n          anything to say about that?
