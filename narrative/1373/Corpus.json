During the reign of Domitian, Agricola, a faithful imperial general, had been the most important general involved in the conquest of a great part of Britain. The proud tone of the Agricola recalls the style of the laudationes funebres (funeral speeches). A quick r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the career of Agricola prior to his mission in Britain is followed by a narration of the conquest of the island. There is a geographical and ethnological digression, taken not only from notes and memories of Agricola but also from the De Bello Gallico of Julius Caesar. The content is so varied as to go beyond the limits of a simple biography, but the narration, whatever its form, serves to exalt the subject of the biography.\nTacitus exalts the character of his father-in-law, by showing how \u2014 as governor of Roman Britain and commander of the army \u2014 he attends to matters of state with fidelity, honesty, and competence, even under the government of the hated Emperor Domitian. Critiques of Domitian and of his regime of spying and repression come to the fore at the work's conclusion. Agricola remained uncorrupted; in disgrace under Domitian, he died without seeking the glory of an ostentatious martyrdom. Tacitus condemns the suicide of the Stoics as of no benefit to the state. Tacitus makes no clear statement as to whether the death of Agricola was from natural causes or ordered by Domitian, although he does say that rumors were voiced in Rome that Agricola was poisoned on the Emperor's orders.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Germania and Agricola, by Caius Cornelius Tacitus\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

S. Tyler\n\nProfessor of the Greek and Latin Languages in Amherst College\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nThis edition of the Germania and Agricola of Tacitus is designed to meet\nthe following wants, which, it is believed, have been generally felt by\nteachers and pupils in American Colleges.\n\n1. A Latin text, approved and established by the essential concurrence of\nall the more recent editors. The editions of Tacitus now in use in this\ncountry abound in readings purely conjectural, adopted without due regard\nto the peculiarities of the author, and in direct contravention of the\ncritical canon, that, other things being equal, the more difficult\nreading is the more likely to be genuine. The recent German editions\nlabor to exhibit and explain, so far as possible, the reading of the best\nMSS.\n\n2. A more copious illustration of the grammatical constructions, also of\nthe rhetorical and poetical usages peculiar to Tacitus, without\ntranslating, however, to such an extent as to supersede the proper\nexertions of the student. Few books require so much illustration of this\nkind, as the Germania and Agricola of Tacitus; few have received more in\nGermany, yet few so little here. In a writer so concise and abrupt as\nTacitus, it has been deemed necessary to pay particular regard to the\nconnexion of thought, and to the particles, as the hinges of that\nconnexion.\n\n3. A comparison of the writer and his cotemporaries with authors of the\nAugustan age, so as to mark concisely the changes which had been already\nwrought in the language and taste of the Roman people. It is chiefly with\na view to aid such a comparison, that it has been thought advisable to\nprefix a Life of Tacitus, which is barren indeed of personal incidents,\nbut which it is hoped may serve to exhibit the author in his relation to\nthe history, and especially to the literature, of his age.\n\n4. The department in which less remained to be done than any other, for\nthe elucidation of Tacitus, was that of Geography, History, and\nArchaeology. The copious notes of Gordon and Murphy left little to be\ndesired in this line; and these notes are not only accessible to American\nscholars in their original forms, but have been incorporated, more or\nless, into all the college editions. If any peculiar merit attaches to\nthis edition, in this department, it will be found in the frequent\nreferences to such classic authors as furnish collateral information, and\nin the illustration of the private life of the Romans, by the help of\nsuch recent works as Becker's Gallus. The editor has also been able to\navail himself of Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo Saxons, which sheds\nnot a little light on the manners of the Germans.\n\n5. Many of the ablest commentaries on the Germania and Agricola have\nappeared within a comparatively recent period, some of them remarkable\nexamples of critical acumen and exegetical tact, and others, models of\nschool and college editions. It has been the endeavor of the editor to\nbring down the literature pertaining to Tacitus to the present time, and\nto embody in small compass the most valuable results of the labors of\nsuch recent German editors as Grimm, G\u00c3\u00bcnther, Gruber, Kiessling, Dronke,\nRoth, Ruperti, and Walther.\n\nThe text is, in the main, that of Walther, though the other editors just\nnamed have been consulted; and in such minor differences as exist between\nthem, I have not hesitated to adopt the reading which seemed best to\naccord with the usage and genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioned\nby a decided preponderance of critical suffrage. Other readings have been\nreferred to in the Notes, so far as they are of any considerable\nimportance, or supported by respectable authority. Partly for\nconvenience, but chiefly as a matter of taste, I have ventured to follow\nthe German editions in dispensing entirely with diacritical marks, and in\nsome peculiarities of less importance, which if not viewed with favor, it\nis hoped, will not be judged with severity. The punctuation is the result\nof a diligent comparison of the best editions, together with a careful\nstudy of the connexion of language and of thought.\n\nThe German editions above mentioned, together with several French,\nEnglish, and American works, have not only been constantly before me, but\nhave been used with great freedom, and credit awarded to them\naccordingly. Some may think their names should have appeared less\nfrequently; others that they should have received credit to a still\ngreater extent. Suffice it to say, I have never intended to quote the\nlanguage, or borrow the thoughts of an author, without giving his name;\nand in matters of fact or opinion, I have cited authorities not only when\nI have been indebted to them for the suggestion, but whenever, in a case\nof coincidence of views, I thought the authorities would be of any\ninterest to the student.\n\nI have not considered it needful, with German scrupulosity, to\ndistinguish between my own references and those of others. It may safely\nbe taken for granted, that the major, perhaps the better, part of them\nhave been derived from foreign sources. But no references have been\nadmitted on trust. They have been carefully verified, and it is hoped\nthat numerous as they are, they will be found pertinent and useful,\nwhether illustrative of things, or of mere verbal usage. Some, who use\nthe book, will doubtless find occasion to follow them out either in whole\nor in part; and those who do not, will gain a general impression as to\nthe sources from which collateral information may be obtained, that will\nbe of no small value.\n\nThe frequent references to the Notes of Professor Kingsley, will show the\nestimation in which I hold them. Perhaps I have used them too freely. My\nonly apology is, that so far as they go, they are just what is wanted;\nand if I had avoided using them to a considerable extent, I must have\nsubstituted something less perfect of my own. Had they been more copious,\nand extended more to verbal and grammatical illustrations, these Notes\nnever would have appeared.\n\nThe editor is convinced, from his experience as a teacher, that the\nstudent of Tacitus will not master the difficulties, or appreciate the\nmerits, of so peculiar an author, unless his peculiarities are distinctly\npointed out and explained. Indeed, the student, in reading any classic\nauthor, needs, not to be carried along on the broad shoulders of an\nindiscriminate translator, but to be guided at every step in learning his\nlessons, by a judicious annotator, who will remove his difficulties, and\naid his progress; who will point out to him what is worthy of attention,\nand guard him against the errors to which he is constantly exposed; for\nfirst impressions are lively and permanent, and the errors of the study,\neven though corrected in the recitation, not unfrequently leave an\nimpression on the mind which is never effaced.\n\nBesides the aid derived from books, to which the merit of this edition,\nif it have any merit, will be chiefly owing, the editor takes this\nopportunity to acknowledge his many obligations to those professors and\nother literary gentlemen, who have extended to him assistance and\nencouragement. To Prof. H. B. Hackett, of Newton Theological Seminary,\nespecially, he is indebted for favors, which, numerous and invaluable in\nthemselves, as the results of a singularly zealous and successful\ndevotion to classical learning, are doubly grateful as the tokens of a\npersonal friendship, which began when we were members of the same class\nin college. The work was commenced at his suggestion, and has been\ncarried forward with his constant advice and co-operation. His ample\nprivate library, and, through his influence, the library of the Seminary,\nhave been placed at my disposal; and the notes passed under his eye and\nwere improved in not a few particulars, at his suggestion, though he is\nin no way responsible for their remaining imperfections. I have also\nreceived counsel and encouragement in all my labors from my esteemed\ncolleague, Prof. N. W. Fiske, whose instructions in the same department\nwhich has since been committed to my charge, first taught me to love the\nGreek and Latin classics. I have only to regret that his ill health and\nabsence from the country have prevented me from deriving still greater\nadvantages from his learning and taste. An unforeseen event has, in like\nmanner, deprived me of the expected cooperation of Prof. Lyman Coleman,\nnow of Nassau Hall College in N. J., in concert with whom this work was\nplanned, and was to have been executed, and on whose ripe scholarship,\nand familiarity with the German language and literature, I chiefly relied\nfor its successful accomplishment.\n\nI should not do justice to my feelings, were I to omit the expression of\nmy obligations to the printer and publishers for the unwearied patience\nwith which they have labored to perfect the work, under all the\ndisadvantages attending the superintendance of the press, at such a\ndistance. If there should still be found in it inaccuracies and\nblemishes, it will not be because they have spared any pains to make it a\ncorrect and beautiful book.\n\nIt is with unfeigned diffidence that I submit to the public this first\nattempt at literary labor. I am fully sensible of its many imperfections,\nat the same time I am conscious of an ability to make it better at some\nfuture day, should it meet the favorable regard of the classical teachers\nof our land, to whom it is dedicated as an humble contribution to that\ncause in which they are now laboring, with such unprecedented zeal.\nShould it contribute in any measure to a better understanding, or a\nhigher appreciation by our youthful countrymen of a classic author, from\nwhom, beyond almost any other, I have drawn instruction and delight, I\nshall not have labored in vain.\n\n_Amherst College, June 1, 1847_.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION\n\n\nThe text of this edition has been carefully revised and compared with\nthose of D\u00c3\u00b6derlein, Halle, 1847, Orelli, Zurich, 1848, and Ritter, Bonn\nand Cambridge, 1848. The notes also have been re-examined and, to a\nconsiderable extent, re-written; partly to correspond with the progress\nof my own mind, partly in accordance with suggestions derived from the\nabove named editions, and from friendly criticisms either by letter or in\nthe public journals. Among the journals, I am particularly indebted to\nthe Bibliotheca Sacra and the New-Englander; and for communications by\nletter, I am under especial obligations to Professors Crosby and Sanborn\nof Dartmouth College, Robbins of Middlebury, and Lincoln of Brown\nUniversity.\n\nIn revising the geography of the Germania, I have consulted, without\nhowever entering much into detail, Ukert's invaluable treatise on the\nGeography of the Greeks and Romans, whose volume on Germany contains a\ntranslation and running commentary on almost the entire work of Tacitus.\nParticular attention has been paid to the ethnology of the tribes and\nnations, in reference to whose origin and early history Tacitus is among\nthe best authorities. In this department the works of Prichard and Latham\nhave been my chief reliance. Grimm and Zeuss, though often referred to, I\nregret to say I have been able to consult only at second hand.\n\nIn sending out this revised edition of these most delightful treatises of\nan author, in the study of whose works I never tire, I cannot but express\nthe hope, that it has been not a little improved by these alterations and\nadditions, while it will be found to have lost none of the essential\nfeatures by which the first edition was commended to so good a measure of\npublic favor.\n\nW. S. Tyler.\n\n_Amherst, May_, 1852\n\n\n\n\nLIFE OF TACITUS.\n\n\nIt is the office of genius and learning, as of light, to illustrate\nother things, and not itself. The writers, who, of all others perhaps,\nhave told us most of the world, just as it has been and is, have told us\nleast of themselves. Their character we may infer, with more or less\nexactness, from their works, but their history is unwritten and must for\never remain so. Homer, though, perhaps, the only one who has been argued\nout of existence, is by no means the only one whose age and birthplace\nhave been disputed. The native place of Tacitus is mere matter of\nconjecture. His parentage is not certainly known. The time of his birth\nand the year of his death are ascertained only by approximation, and very\nfew incidents are recorded in the history of his life; still we know the\nperiod in which he lived, the influences under which his character was\ndeveloped and matured, and the circumstances under which he wrote his\nimmortal works. In short, we know his times, though we can scarcely\ngather up enough to denominate his life; and the times in which an author\nlived, are often an important, not to say, essential means of elucidating\nhis writings.\n\nCAIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS was born in the early part of the reign of Nero,\nand near the middle of the first century in the Christian Era. The\nprobability is, that he was the son of Cornelius Tacitus, a man of\nequestrian rank, and procurator of Belgic Gaul under Nero; that he was\nborn at Interamna in Umbria, and that he received a part of his education\nat Massilia (the modern Marseilles), which was then the Athens of the\nWest, a Grecian colony, and a seat of truly Grecian culture and\nrefinement. It is not improbable that he enjoyed also the instructions of\nQuintilian, who for twenty years taught at Rome that pure and manly\neloquence, of which his Institutes furnish at once such perfect rules,\nand so fine an example. If we admit the Dialogue de Claris Oratoribus to\nbe the work of Tacitus, his beau-id\u00c3\u00a9al of the education proper for an\norator was no less comprehensive, no less elevated, no less liberal, than\nthat of Cicero himself; and if his theory of education was, like\nCicero's, only a transcript of his own education, he must have been\ndisciplined early in all the arts and sciences--in all the departments\nof knowledge which were then cultivated at Rome; a conclusion in which we\nare confirmed also by the accurate and minute acquaintance which he\nshows, in his other works, with all the affairs, whether civil or\nmilitary, public or private, literary or religious, both of Greece and\nRome.\n\nThe boyhood and youth of Tacitus did, indeed, fall on evil times.\nMonsters in vice and crime had filled the throne, till their morals and\nmanners had infected those of all the people. The state was distracted,\nand apparently on the eve of dissolution. The public taste, like the\ngeneral conscience, was perverted. The fountains of education were\npoisoned. Degenerate Grecian masters were inspiring their Roman pupils\nwith a relish for a false science, a frivolous literature, a vitiated\neloquence, an Epicurean creed, and a voluptuous life.\n\nBut with sufficient discernment to see the follies and vices of his age,\nand with sufficient virtue to detest them, Tacitus must have found his\nlove of wisdom and goodness, of liberty and law, strengthened by the\nvery disorders and faults of the times. If the patriot ever loves a\nwell-regulated freedom, it will be in and after the reign of a tyrant,\npreceded or followed by what is still worse, anarchy. If the pure and the\ngood ever reverence purity and goodness, it will be amid the general\nprevalence of vice and crime. If the sage ever pants after wisdom, it is\nwhen the fountains of knowledge have become corrupted. The reigns of Nero\nand his immediate successors were probably the very school, of all\nothers, to which we are most indebted for the comprehensive wisdom, the\nelevated sentiments, and the glowing eloquence of the biographer of\nAgricola, and the historian of the Roman Empire. His youth saw, and felt,\nand deplored the disastrous effects of Nero's inhuman despotism, and of\nthe anarchy attending the civil wars of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. His\nmanhood saw, and felt, and exulted in the contrast furnished by the\nreigns of Vespasian and Titus, though the sun of the latter too soon went\ndown, in that long night of gloom, and blood, and terror, the tyranny of\nDomitian. And when, in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, he enjoyed the\nrare felicity of thinking what he pleased, and speaking what he thought,\nhe was just fitted in the maturity of his faculties, and the extent of\nhis observation and reflections, \"to enroll slowly, year after year, that\ndreadful reality of crimes and sufferings, which even dramatic horror, in\nall its license of wild imagination, can scarcely reach, the long\nunvarying catalogue of tyrants and executioners, and victims that return\nthanks to the gods and die, and accusers rich with their blood, and more\nmighty as more widely hated, amid the multitudes of prostrate slaves,\nstill looking whether there may not yet have escaped some lingering\nvirtue which it may be a merit to destroy, and having scarcely leisure to\nfeel even the agonies of remorse in the continued sense of the\nprecariousness of their own gloomy existence.\" [Brown's Philosophy of the\nMind.]\n\nTacitus was educated for the bar, and continued to plead causes,\noccasionally at least, and with not a little success, even after he had\nentered upon the great business of his life, as a writer of history. We\nfind references to his first, and perhaps his last appearance, as an\nadvocate, in the Letters of Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The\nfirst was, when Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus a little older (how much\nwe are not informed), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as to awaken\nthe emulation and the envy, though not in a bad sense, of Pliny. The last\nwas some twenty years later, when Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends of\na whole life, the brightest ornaments of literature and of the forum,\nwere associated by the choice of the Senate, and pleaded together at\nthe bar of the Senate, and in the presence of the Emperor Trajan, for\nthe execution of justice upon Marius Priscus, who was accused of\nmaladministration in the proconsulship of Africa. Pliny says, that\nTacitus spoke with singular gravity and eloquence, and the Senate passed\na unanimous vote of approbation and thanks to both the orators, for the\nability and success with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.\nEpis. ii. 11)\n\nWe have also the comments of Pliny on a panegyrical oration, which\nTacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his predecessor in the consular\noffice, Verginius Rufus, perhaps the most remarkable man of his age,\ndistinguished alike as a hero, a statesman, and a scholar, and yet so\nmodest or so wise that he repeatedly refused the offer of the imperial\npurple. \"Fortune,\" says Pliny, \"always faithful to Verginius, reserved\nfor her last favor, such an orator to pronounce a eulogium on such\nvirtues. It was enough to crown the glory of a well spent life\" (Plin.\nEpis. ii. 1).\n\nThe speeches in the historical works of Tacitus, though rather concise\nand abstract for popular orations, are full of force and fire. Some of\nthem are truly Demosthenic in their impassioned and fiery logic. The\nspeech of Galgacus before the Briton army, when driven into the extremity\nof Caledonia by the Romans under Agricola, can hardly be surpassed for\npatriotic sentiments, vigorous reasoning, and burning invective. The\naddress of Germanicus to his mutinous soldiers (in the Annals) is not\nless remarkable for tender pathos. The sage and yet soldierlike address\nof the aged Galba to his adopted son Piso, the calm and manly speech of\nPiso to the body guard, the artful harangue of the demagogue Otho to his\ntroops, the no less crafty address of Mucianus to Vespasian, the headlong\nrapidity of Antonius' argument for immediate action, the plausible plea\nof Marcellus Eprius against the honest attack of Helvidius Priscus, and\nthe burning rebukes of the intrepid Vocula to his cowardly and\ntreacherous followers--all these, in the Histories, show no ordinary\ndegree of rhetorical skill and versatility. Indeed, the entire body of\nhis works is animated with the spirit of the orator, as it is tinged also\nwith the coloring of the poet. For this reason, they are doubtless\ndeficient in the noble simplicity of the earlier classical histories; but\nfor the same reason they may be a richer treasure for the professional\nmen at least of modern times.\n\nOf his marriage with the daughter of Agricola, and its influence on his\ncharacter and prospects, as also of his passing in regular gradation\nthrough the series of public honors at Rome, beginning with the\nquaestorship under Vespasian, and ending with the consulship under Nerva,\nTacitus informs us himself (A. 9, His. i. 1), barely alluding to them,\nhowever, in the general, and leaving all the details to mere conjecture.\nWe learn to our surprise, that he not only escaped the jealousy of the\ntyrant Domitian, but was even promoted by him to the office of\nQuindecimvir and Praetor (Ann. ii. 11). Beyond these vague notices, we\nknow little or nothing of his course of life, except that Pliny says\n(Epist. iv. 13), he was much esteemed by the learned and the great at\nRome, who went in crowds to his levees. Of the time of his death, we can\nonly conjecture, that he died before the Emperor Trajan, but after his\nfriend Pliny--the former, because, had he outlived the Emperor, he would\nprobably have executed his purpose of writing the history of his reign\n(His. i. 1); the latter, because, if he had not survived his friend,\nPliny, who lamented the death of so many others, would not have failed to\npay the last tribute to the memory of Tacitus.\n\nIt is generally admitted, though without direct testimony, that Tacitus\ndied not without issue. That excellent prince, M. Claudius Tacitus,\ndeduced his pedigree from the historian, and ordered his image to be set\nup, and a complete collection of his works to be placed in the public\narchives, with a special direction that twelve copies should be made\nevery year at the public expense. It is greatly to be regretted that such\npraiseworthy precautions should have failed to preserve for us that\ntreasure entire!\n\nThe age of Tacitus is usually styled the silver age of Roman Literature;\nand it merits no higher title, when compared with the golden age of\nAugustus. It was the good fortune of Augustus to gain the supremacy at\nRome, when society had reached its maximum of refinement, and was just\nready to enter upon its stage of corruption and decline. Hence his name\nis identified with that proud era in literature, in producing which he\nbore at best only an accidental and secondary part. In the literature of\nthe Augustan age, we admire the substance of learning and philosophy\nwithout the show, the cultivation of taste without the parade of\ncriticism, the fascination of poetry without its corruption, and the use\nof eloquence without its abuse. Grecian refinement was no longer\ndespised; Grecian effeminacy had not yet prevailed. The camp was not now\nthe home of the Romans; neither were the theatres and the schools. They\nhad ceased to be a nation of soldiers, and had not yet become a nation of\nslaves. At no other period could Rome have had her Cicero, her Livy, and\nher Virgil.\n\nThe silver age produced no men who \"attained unto these first three.\" But\nthere are not wanting other bright names to associate with Tacitus,\nthough most of them lived a little earlier than he. There was Seneca, the\nPhilosopher, whose style, with its perpetual antitheses, is the very\nworst of the age, but his sentiments, perhaps more or less under the\ninfluence of Christianity, approach nearer to the Christian code of\nmorals than those of any other Latin author. There were Martial and\nJuvenal, whose satires made vice tremble in its high places, and helped\nto confer on the Romans the honor of originating one species of literary\ncomposition, unknown to the Greeks. There were Suetonius and Plutarch;\nthe one natural, simple, and pure in his style, far beyond his age, but\nwithout much depth or vigor of thought; the other involved and affected\nin his manner, but in his matter of surpassing richness and incalculable\nworth. There was the elder Pliny, a prodigy of learning and industry,\nwhose researches in Natural History cost him his life, in that fatal\neruption of Vesuvius which buried Herculaneum and Pompeii. There was also\nthe judicious Quintilian, at once neat and nervous in his language,\ndelicate and correct in his criticisms, a man of genius and a scholar, a\nteacher and an exemplar of eloquence. Finally, there were the younger\nPliny and Tacitus, rival candidates for literary and professional\ndistinction, yet cherishing for each other the most devoted and\ninviolable attachment, each viewing the other as the ornament of their\ncountry, each urging the other to write the history of their age, and\neach relying chiefly on the genius of the other for his own immortality\n(Plin. Epis. vii. 33). Their names were together identified by their\ncontemporaries with the literature of the age of Trajan: \"I never was\ntouched with a more sensible pleasure,\" says Pliny, in one of his\nbeautiful Letters [Eleven of these are addressed to Tacitus, and two\nor three are written expressly for the purpose of furnishing materials\nfor his history.] (which rival Cicero's in epistolary ease and\nelegance), \"than by an account which I lately received from Cornelius\nTacitus. He informed me, that at the last Circensian Games, he sat next\na stranger, who, after much discourse on various topics of learning,\nasked him whether he was an Italian or a Provincial. Tacitus replied,\n'Your acquaintance with literature must have informed you who I am.'\n'Aye,' said the man, 'is it then Tacitus or Pliny I am talking with?' I\ncannot express how highly I am pleased to find, that our names are not\nso much the proper appellations of individuals, as a designation of\nlearning itself\" (Plin. Epis. ix. 23). Critics are not agreed to which\nof these two literary friends belongs the delicate encomium of\nQuintilian, when, after enumerating the principal writers of the day,\nhe adds, \"There is another ornament of the age, who will deserve the\nadmiration of posterity. I do not mention him at present; his name will\nbe known hereafter.\" Pliny, Tacitus, and Quintilian, are also rival\ncandidates for the honor of having written the Dialogue de Claris\nOratoribus, one of the most valuable productions in ancient criticism.\n\nAs a writer, Tacitus was not free from the faults of his age. The native\nsimplicity of Greek and Latin composition had passed away. An affected\npoint and an artificial brilliancy were substituted in their place. The\nrhetoric and philosophy of the schools had infected all the departments\nof literature. Simple narrative no longer suited the pampered taste of\nthe readers or the writers of history. It must be highly seasoned with\nsentimentalism and moralizing, with romance and poetry. Tacitus,\ncertainly, did not escape the infection. In the language of Macaulay, \"He\ncarries his love of effect far beyond the limits of moderation. He tells\na fine story finely, but he cannot tell a plain story plainly. He\nstimulates, till stimulants lose their power.\" [See a fine article on\nhistory, Ed. Her., 1828. Also in Macaulay's Miscellanies.] We have taken\noccasion in the notes to point out not a few examples of rhetorical\npomp, and poetical coloring, and even needless multiplication of words,\nwhere plainness and precision would have been much better, and which\nmay well surprise us in a writer of so much conciseness. Lord Monboddo,\nin a very able, though somewhat extravagant critique on Tacitus, has\nselected numerous instances of what he calls the ornamented dry style,\nmany of which are so concise, so rough, and so broken, that he says,\nthey do not deserve the name of composition, but seem rather like the\nraw materials of history, than like history itself (Orig. and Prog.\nof Lang., vol iii. chap. 12).\n\nStill, few readers can fail to pronounce Tacitus, as Macaulay affirms,\nand even Lord Monboddo admits him to be, the greatest of Latin\nhistorians, superior to Thucydides himself in the moral painting of his\nbest narrative scenes, and in the delineation of character without a\nrival among historians, with scarcely a superior among dramatists and\nnovelists. The common style of his narrative is, indeed, wanting in\nsimplicity, and sometimes in perspicuity. He does not deal enough in the\nspecific and the picturesque, the where, the when and the how. But when\nhis subject comes up to the grandeur of his conceptions, and the strength\nof his language, his descriptions are graphic and powerful. No battle\nscenes are more grand and terrific than those of Tacitus. Military men\nand scholars have also remarked their singular correctness and\ndefiniteness. The military evolutions, the fierce encounter, the doubtful\nstruggle, the alternations of victory and defeat, the disastrous rout and\nhot pursuit, the carnage and blood, are set forth with the warrior's\naccuracy and the poet's fire; while, at the same time, the conflicting\npassions and emotions of the combatants are discerned, as it were, by the\neye of a seer--their hidden springs of action, and the lowest depths of\ntheir hearts laid bare, as if by the wand of a magician. In the painting\nof large groups, in the moral portraiture of vast bodies of men under\nhigh excitement and in strenuous exertion, we think that Tacitus far\nsurpasses all other historians. Whether it be a field of battle or a\ncaptured city, a frightened senate or a flattering court, a mutiny or a\nmob, that he describes, we not only see in a clear and strong light the\noutward actions, but we look into the hearts of all the mixed multitude,\nand gaze with wonder on the changing emotions and conflicting passions by\nwhich they are agitated.\n\nHis delineations of individual character are also marked by the same\nprofound insight into the human soul. Like the old Latin Poet, he might\nhave said,\n\n    \"Homo sum; nihil _humani_ a me alienum puto.\"\n\nThere is scarcely a landscape picture in his whole gallery. It is full of\nportraits of _men_, in groups and as individuals, every grade of\ncondition, every variety of character, performing all kinds of actions,\nexhibiting every human passion, the colors laid on with a bold hand, the\nprincipal features presented in a strong light, the minuter strokes\nomitted, the soft and delicate finish despised. We feel, that we have\ngained not a little insight into the character of those men, who are\nbarely introduced in the extant books of Tacitus, but whose history is\ngiven in the books that are lost. Men of inferior rank even, who appear\non the stage only for a short time, develope strongly marked characters,\nwhich are drawn with dramatic distinctness and power, while yet the\nthread of history is never broken, the dignity of history never\nsacrificed. And those Emperors, whose history is preserved entire,--with\nthem we feel acquainted, we know the controlling principles, as well as\nthe leading events of their lives, and we feel sure that we could predict\nhow they would act, under almost any imaginable circumstances.\n\nIn a faithful portraiture of the private and public life of the\ndegenerate Romans, there was much to call for the hand of a master in\n_satire_. And we find in the glowing sketches of our author, all the\nvigor and point of a Juvenal, without his vulgarity and obscenity; all\nthe burning indignation which the Latin is so peculiarly capable of\nexpressing, with all the vigor and stateliness by which the same language\nis equally characterized. Tacitus has been sometimes represented as a\nvery Diogenes, for carping and sarcasm--a very Aristophanes, to blacken\ncharacter with ridicule and reproach. But he is as far removed from the\ncynic or the buffoon, as from the panegyrist or the flatterer. He is not\nthe indiscriminate admirer that Plutarch was. Nor is he such a universal\nhater as Sallust. It is the fault of the times that he is obliged to deal\nso much in censure. If there ever were perfect monsters on earth, such\nwere several of the Roman Emperors. Yet Tacitus describes few, if any, of\nthem without some of the traits of humanity. He gives us in his history\nneither demons nor gods, but veritable men and women. In this respect, as\nalso in his descriptions of battles, Tacitus is decidedly superior to\nLivy. The characters of Livy are distinguishable only as classes--the\ngood all very good, the bad very bad, the indifferent very indifferent.\nYou discover no important difference between a Fabius and a Marcellus,\nfurther than it lies on the face of their actions. In Tacitus, the\ncharacters are all individuals. Each stands out distinctly from the\nsurrounding multitude, and not only performs his own proper actions, but\nis governed by his own peculiar motives. Livy places before us the\nstatues of heroes and gods; Tacitus conducts us through the crowd of\nliving men.\n\nIn an attempt to sketch the most striking features of Tacitus, as a\nwriter, no critic can omit to mention his sage and pithy maxims.\nApothegms abound on every page--sagacious, truthful, and profound in\nsentiment, in style concise, antithetic and sententious. Doubtless he is\nexcessively fond of pointed antithesis. Perhaps he is too much given to\nmoralizing and reflection. It was, as we have said, the fault of his age.\nBut no one, who is familiar with Seneca, will severely censure Tacitus.\nHe will only wonder that he should have risen so far above the faults of\nhis contemporaries. Indeed, Tacitus interweaves his reflections with so\nmuch propriety, and clothes his apothegms with so much dignity--he is so\nmanifestly competent to instruct the world by maxims, whether in civil,\nsocial, or individual life, that we are far from wishing he had indulged\nin it less. His reflections do not interrupt the thread of his narrative.\nThey grow naturally out of his incidents. They break forth spontaneously\nfrom the lips of his men. His history is indeed philosophy teaching by\nexamples; and his pithy sayings are truly lessons of wisdom, embodied in\nthe form most likely to strike the attention, and impress the memory. We\nshould love to see a collection of apothegms from the pen of Tacitus. It\nwould make an admirable book of laconics. No book would give you more\nideas in fewer words. Nowhere could you gain so much knowledge, and lose\nso little time. The reader of Tacitus, who will study him with pen in\nhand, to mark, or refer to the most striking passages, will soon find\nhimself master of a text book in moral and political science, we might\nsay a text book in human nature, singularly concise and sententious, and\nwhat is not always true even of concise and sententious writers, as\nsingularly wise and profound. In such a book, many of the _speeches_\nwould find a place entire; for many of them are little else than a series\nof condensed, well-timed, and most instructive apothegms. [E.g. the\nspeech of Galba to Piso. His. i. 15, 16.]\n\nBut the scholar, who is on the lookout, will find lurking in every\nsection, and almost every sentence, some important truth in morals, in\npolitics, in the individual or social nature of man. Neither the editor\nnor the teacher can be expected to develope these sentiments, nor even,\nin many instances, to point them out. That labor must be performed by the\nscholar; and his will be the reward.\n\nNo hasty perusal, no single reading of Tacitus, will give a just\nconception of the surpassing richness of his works. They must be studied\nprofoundly to be duly appreciated. They are a mine of wisdom, of vast\nextent and unknown depth, whose treasures lie chiefly beneath the\nsurface, imbedded in the solid rock which must be entered with mining\nimplements, explored with strong lights, and its wealth brought up by\nsevere toil and sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC.

Germania omnis a Gallis Rhaetisque et Pannoniis Rheno et Danubio\nfluminibus, a Sarmatis Dacisque mutuo metu aut montibus separatur: cetera\nOceanus ambit, latos sinus et insularum immensa spatia complectens, nuper\ncognitis quibusdam gentibus ac regibus, quos bellum aperuit. Rhenus,\nRhaeticarum Alpium inaccesso ac praecipiti vertice ortus, modico flexu in\noccidentem versus, septentrionali Oceano miscetur. Danubius, molli et\nclementer edito montis Abnobae jugo effusus, plures populos adit, donec\nin Ponticum mare sex meatibus erumpat: septimum os paludibus hauritur.\n\nII. Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim, minimeque aliarum gentium\nadventibus et hospitiis mixtos; quia nec terra olim, sed classibus\nadvehebantur, qui mutare sedes quaerebant, et immensus ultra, utque sic\ndixerim, adversus Oceanus raris ab orbe nostro navibus aditur. Quis\nporro, praeter periculum horridi et ignoti maris, Asia aut Africa aut\nItalia relicta, Germaniam peteret, informem terris, asperam coelo,\ntristem cultu aspectuque, nisi si patria sit? Celebrant carminibus\nantiquis (quod unum apud illos memoriae et annalium genus est) Tuisconem\ndeum terra editum, et filium Mannum, originem gentis conditoresque. Manno\ntres filios assignant, e quorum nominibus proximi Oceano Ingaevones,\nmedii Hermiones, ceteri Istaevones vocentur. Quidam autem, ut in licentia\nvetustatis, plures deo ortos pluresque gentis appellationes, Marsos,\nGambrivios, Suevos, Vandalios, affirmant; eaque vera et antiqua nomina.\nCeterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum; quoniam, qui primi\nRhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint, ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati\nsint: ita nationis nomen, non gentis evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum\na victore ob metum, mox a seipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur.\n\nIII. Fuisse apud eos et Herculem memorant, primumque omnium virorum\nfortium ituri in proelia canunt. Sunt illis haec quoque carmina, quorum\nrelatu, quem baritum vocant, accendunt animos, futuraeque pugnae fortunam\nipso cantu augurantur: terrent enim trepidantve, prout sonuit acies. Nec\ntam voces illae, quam virtutis concentus videntur. Affectatur praecipue\nasperitas soni et fractum murmur, objectis ad os scutis, quo plenior et\ngravior vox repercussu intumescat. Ceterum et Ulixem quidam opinantur\nlongo illo et fabuloso errore in hunc Occanum delatum, adisse Germaniae\nterras, Asciburgiumque, quod in ripa Rheni situm hodieque incolitur, ab\nillo constitutum nominatumque. Aram quin etiam Ulixi consecratam,\nadjecto Laertae patris nomine, eodem loco olim repertam, monumentaque et\ntumulos quosdam Graecis litteris inscriptos in confinio Germaniae\nRhaetiaeque adhuc exstare: quae neque confirmare argumentis, neque\nrefellere in animo est: ex ingenio suo quisque demat, vel addat fidem.\n\nIV. Ipse eorum opinionibus accedo, qui Germaniae populos nullis aliis\naliarum nationum connubiis infectos propriam et sinceram et tantum sui\nsimilem gentem exstitisse arbitrantur: unde habitus quoque corporum,\nquanquam in tanto hominum numero, idem omnibus; truces et cacrulei\noculi, rutilae comae, magna corpora et tantum ad impetum valida; laboris\natque operum non eadem patientia: minimeque sitim aestumque tolerare,\nfrigora atque inediam coelo solove assueverunt.\n\nV. Terra, etsi aliquanto specie differt, in universum tamen aut silvis\nhorrida aut paludibus foeda: humidior, qua Gallias; ventosior, qua\nNoricum ac Pannoniam aspicit: satis ferax; frugiferarum arborum\nimpatiens: pecorum fecunda, sed plerumque improcera; ne armentis quidem\nsuus honor, aut gloria frontis: numero gaudent; eaeque solae et\ngratissimae opes sunt. Argentum et aurum propitii an irati dii\naegaverint, dubito. Nec tamen affirmaverim, nullam Germaniae venam\nargentum aurumve gignere: quis enim scrutatus est? possessione et usu\nhaud perinde afficiuntur. Est videre apud illos argentea vasa, legatis et\nprincipibus eorum muneri data, non in alia vilitate, quam quae humo\nfinguntur quanquam proximi, ob usum commerciorum, aurum et argentum in\npretio habent, formasque quasdam nostrae pecuniae agnoscunt atque\neligunt: interiores simplicius et antiquius permutatione mercium utuntur.\nPecuniam probant veterem et diu notam, serratos bigatosque. Argentum\nquoque, magis quam aurum sequuntur, nulla affectione animi, sed quia\nnumerus argenteorum facilior usui est promiscua ac vilia mercantibus.\n\nVI. Ne ferrum quidem superest, sicut ex genere telorum colligitur. Rari\ngladiis aut majoribus lanceis utuntur: hastas, vel ipsorum vocabulo\nframeas gerunt, angusto et brevi ferro sed ita acri et ad usum habili, ut\neodem telo, prout ratio poscit, vel cominus vel eminus pugnent: et eques\nquidem scuto frameaque contentus est: pedites et missilia spargunt, plura\nsinguli, atque in immensum vibrant, nudi aut sagulo leves. Nulla cultus\njactatio; scuta tantum lectissimis coloribus distinguunt: paucis loricae:\nvix uni alterive cassis aut galea. Equi non forma, non velocitate\nconspicui: sed nec variare gyros in morem nostrum docentur. In rectum,\naut uno flexu dextros agunt ita conjuncto orbe, ut nemo posterior sit. In\nuniversum aestimanti, plus penes peditem roboris: eoque mixti\nproeliantur, apta et congruente ad equestrem pugnam velocitate peditum,\nquos ex omni juventute delectos ante aciem locant. Definitur et numerus:\ncenteni ex singulis pagis sunt: idque ipsum inter suos vocantur; et quod\nprimo numerus fuit, jam nomen et honor est. Acies per cuneos componitur.\nCedere loco, dummodo rursus instes, consilii quam formidinis arbitrantur.\nCorpora suorum etiam in dubiis proeliis referunt. Scutum reliquisse,\npraecipuum flagitium; nec aut sacris adesse, aut concilium inire,\nignominioso fas; multique superstites bellorum infamiam laqueo finierunt.\n\nVII. Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt. Nec regibus infinita\naut libera potestas: et duces exemplo potius, quam imperio, si prompti,\nsi conspicui, si ante aciem agant, admiratione praesunt. Ceterum neque\nanimadvertere neque vincire, ne verberare quidem, nisi sacerdotibus\npermissum; non quasi in poenam, nec ducis jussu, sed velut deo imperante,\nquem adesse bellantibus credunt: effigiesque et signa quaedam, detracta\nlucis, in proelium ferunt. Quodque praecipuum fortitudinis incitamentum\nest, non casus nec fortuita conglobatio turmam aut cuneum facit, sed\nfamiliae et propinquitates, et in proximo pignora, unde feminarum\nululatus audiri, unde vagitus infantium: hi cuique sanctissimi testes, hi\nmaximi laudatores. Ad matres, ad conjuges vulnera ferunt; nec illae\nnumerare, aut exigere plagas pavent; cibosque et hortamina pugnantibus\ngestant.\n\nVIII. Memoriae proditur, quasdam acies, inclinatas jam et labantes, a\nfeminis restitutas, constantia precum et objectu pectorum et monstrata\ncominus captivitate, quam longe impatientius feminarum suarum nomine\ntiment: adeo ut efficacius obligentur animi civitatum, quibus inter\nobsides puellae quoque nobiles imperantur. Inesse quin etiam sanctum\naliquid et providum putant: nec aut consilia earum aspernantur, aut\nresponsa negligunt. Vidimus sub divo Vespasiano Veledam diu apud\nplerosque numinis loco habitam. Sed et olim Auriniam et complures alias\nvenerati sunt non adulatione, nec tanquam facerent deas.\n\nIX. Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt, cui certis diebus humanis quoque\nhostiis litare fas habent. Herculem ac Martem concessis animalibus\nplacant: pars Suevorum et Isidi sacrificat. Unde causa et origo peregrino\nsacro parum comperi, nisi quod signum ipsum, in modum liburnae figuratum,\ndocet advectam religionem. Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos, neque in\nullam humani oris speciem assimulare, ex magnitudine coelestium\narbitrantur: lucos ac nemora consecrant, deorumque nominibus appellant\nsecretum illud, quod sola reverentia vident.\n\nX. Auspicia sortesque, ut qui maxime, observant. Sortium consuetudo\nsimplex: virgam, frugiferae arbori decisam, in surculos amputant, eosque,\nnotis quibusdam discretos, super candidam vestem temere ac fortuito\nspargunt: mox, si publice consuletur, sacerdos civitatis, sin privatim,\nipse paterfamiliae, precatus deos coelumque suspiciens, ter singulos\ntollit, sublatos secundum impressam ante notam interpretatur. Si\nprohibuerunt, nulla de eadem re in eundem diem consultatio; sin\npermissum, auspiciorum adhuc fides exigitur. Et illud quidem etiam hic\nnotum, avium voces volatusque interrogare: proprium gentis, equorum\nquoque praesagia ac monitus experiri; publice aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac\nlucis candidi et nullo mortali opere contacti: quos pressos sacro curru\nsacerdos ac rex vel princeps civitatis comitantur, hinnitusque ac\nfremitus observant. Nec ulli auspicio major fides non solum apud plebem,\nsed apud proceres, apud sacerdotes; se enim ministros deorum, illos\nconscios putant. Est et alia observatio auspiciorum, qua gravium bellorum\neventus explorant; ejus gentis, cum qua bellum est, captivum, quoquo modo\ninterceptum, cum electo popularium suorum, patriis quemque armis,\ncommittunt: victoria hujus vel illius pro praejudicio accipitur.\n\nXI. De minoribus rebus principes consultant; de majoribus omnes: ita\ntamen, ut ea quoque, quorum penes plebem arbitrium est, apud principes\npertractentur. Coeunt, nisi quid fortuitum et subitum inciderit, certis\ndiebus, cum aut inchoatur luna aut impletur: nam agendis rebus hoc\nauspicatissimum initium credunt. Nec dierum numerum, ut nos, sed noctium\ncomputant. Sic constituunt, sic condicunt: nox ducere diem videtur. Illud\nex libertate vitium, quod non simul, nec ut jussi conveniunt, sed et\nalter et tertius dies cunctatione coeuntium absumitur. Ut turbae placuit,\nconsidunt armati. Silentium per sacerdotes, quibus tum et coercendi jus\nest, imperatur. Mox rex vel princeps, prout aetas cuique, prout nobilitas,\nprout decus bellorum, prout facundia est, audiuntur, auctoritate suadendi\nmagis, quam jubendi potestate. Si displicuit sententia, fremitu\naspernantur; sin placuit, frameas concutiunt. Honoratissimum assensus\ngenus est, armis laudare.\n\nXII. Licet apud concilium accusare quoque et discrimen capitis intendere.\nDistinctio poenarum ex delicto: proditores et transfugas arboribus\nsuspendunt; ignavos et imbelles et corpore infames coeno ac palude,\ninjecta insuper crate, mergunt. Diversitas supplicii illuc respicit,\ntanquam scelera ostendi oporteat, dum puniuntur, flagitia abscondi. Sed\net levioribus delictis, pro modo poenarum, equorum pecorumque numero\nconvicti mulctantur: pars mulctae regi vel civitati, pars ipsi, qui\nvindicatur, vel propinquis ejus exsolvitur. Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis\net principes, qui jura per pagos vicosque reddunt. Centeni singulis ex\nplebe comites, consilium simul et auctoritas, adsunt.\n\nXIII. Nihil autem neque publicae neque privatae rei, nisi armati agunt.\nSed arma sumere non ante cuiquam moris, quam civitas suffecturum\nprobaverit. Tum in ipso concilio, vel principum aliquis vel pater vel\npropinquus scuto frameaque juvenem ornant: haec apud illos toga, hic\nprimus juventae honos: ante hoc domus pars videntur, mox reipublicae.\nInsignis nobilitas, aut magna patrum merita, principis dignationem etiam\nadolescentulis assignant: ceteris robustioribus ac jampridem probatis\naggregantur; nec rubor, inter comites aspici. Gradus quin etiam et ipse\ncomitatus habet judicio ejus, quem sectantur: magnaque et comitum\naemulatio, quibus primus apud principem suum locus, et principum, cui\nplurimi et acerrimi comites. Haec dignitas, hae vires, magno semper\nelectorum juvenum globo circumdari, in pace decus, in bello praesidium.\nNec solum in sua gente cuique, sed apud finitimas quoque civitates id\nnomen, ea gloria est, si numero ac virtute comitatus emineat: expetuntur\nenim legationibus et muneribus ornantur et ipsa plerumque fama bella\nprofligant.\n\nXIV. Cum ventum in aciem, turpe principi virtute vinci, turpe comitatui,\nvirtutem principis non adaequare. Jam vero infame in omnem vitam ac\nprobrosum, superstitem principi suo ex acie recessisse. Illum defendere,\ntueri, sua quoque fortia facta gloriae ejus assignare, praecipuum\nsacramentum est. Principes pro victoria pugnant; comites pro principe. Si\ncivitas, in qua orti sunt, longa pace et otio torpeat plerique nobilium\nadolescentium petunt ultro eas nationes, quae tum bellum aliquod gerunt;\nquia et ingrata genti quies, et facilius inter ancipitia clarescunt,\nmagnumque comitatum non nisi vi belloque tuentur: exigunt enim principis\nsui liberalitate illum bellatorem equum, illam cruentam victricemque\nframeam. Nam epulae et, quanquam incompti, largi tamen apparatus pro\nstipendio cedunt: materia munificentiae per bella et raptus. Nec arare\nterram, aut expectare annum, tam facile persuaseris, quam vocare hostes\net vulnera mereri. Pigrum quinimmo et iners videtur, sudore acquirere,\nquod possis sanguine parare.\n\nXV. Quotiens bella non ineunt, non multum venatibus, plus per otium\ntransigunt, dediti somno ciboque, fortissimus quisque ac bellicosissimus\nnihil agens, delegata domus et penatium et agrorum cura feminis\nsenibusque et infirmissimo cuique ex familia: ipsi hebent; mira\ndiversitate naturae, cum iidem homines sic ament inertiam et oderint\nquietem. Mos est civitatibus ultro ac viritim conferre principibus vel\narmentorum vel frugum, quod pro honore acceptum, etiam necessitatibus\nsubvenit. Gaudent praecipue finitimarum gentium donis, quae non modo a\nsingulis, sed publice mittuntur: electi equi, magna arma, phalerae,\ntorquesque. Jam et pecuniam accipere docuimus.\n\nXVI. Nullas Germanorum populis urbes habitari, satis notum est: ne pati\nquidem inter se junctas sedes. Colunt discreti ac diversi, ut fons, ut\ncampus, ut nemus placuit. Vicos locant, non in nostrum morem, connexis et\ncohaerentibus aedificiis: suam quisque domum spatio circumdat, sive\nadversus casus ignis remedium, sive inscitia aedificandi. Ne caementorum\nquidem apud illos aut tegularum usus: materia ad omnia utuntur informi et\ncitra speciem aut delectationem. Quaedam loca diligentius illinunt terra\nita pura ac splendente, ut picturam ac lineamenta colorum imitetur.\nSolent et subterraneos specus aperire, eosque multo insuper fimo onerant,\nsuffugium hiemi et receptaculum frugibus: quia rigorem frigorum ejusmodi\nlocis molliunt: et, si quando hostis advenit, aperta populatur, abdita\nautem et defossa aut ignorantur, aut eo ipso fallunt, quod quaerenda\nsunt.\n\nXVII. Tegumen omnibus sagum, fibula, aut, si desit, spina consertum:\ncetera intecti totos dies juxta focum atque ignem agunt. Locupletissimi\nveste distinguuntur, non fluitante, sicut Sarmatae ac Parthi, sed stricta\net singulos artus exprimente. Gerunt et ferarum pelles, proximi ripae\nnegligenter, ulteriores exquisitius, ut quibus nullus per commercia\ncultus. Eligunt feras, et detracta velamina spargunt maculis pellibusque\nbelluarum, quas exterior Oceanus atque ignotum mare gignit. Nec alius\nfeminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod feminae saepius lineis amictibus\nvelantur, eosque purpura variant, partemque vestitus superioris in\nmanicas non extendunt, nudae brachia ac lacertos: sed et proxima pars\npectoris patet.\n\nXVIII. Quanquam severa illic matrimonia; nec ullam morum partem magis\nlaudaveris: nam prope soli barbarorum singulis uxoribus contenti sunt,\nexceptis admodum paucis, qui non libidine, sed ob nobilitatem, plurimis\nnuptiis ambiuntur, Dotem non uxor marito, sed uxori maritus offert.\nIntersunt parentes et propinqui, ac munera probant: munera non ad\ndelicias muliebres quaesita, nec quibus nova nupta comatur: sed boves et\nfrenatum equum et scutum cum framea gladioque. In haec munera uxor\naccipitur: atque invicem ipsa armorum aliquid viro affert: hoc maximum\nvinculum, haec arcana sacra, hos conjugales deos arbitrantur. Ne se\nmulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus putet, ipsis\nincipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur, venire se laborum\npericulorumque sociam, idem in pace, idem in proelio passuram ausuramque:\nhoc juncti boves, hoc paratus equus, hoc data arma denuntiant; sic\nvivendum, sic pereundum: accipere se, quae liberis inviolata ac digna\nreddat, quae nurus accipiant rursus, quae ad nepotes referantur.\n\nXIX. Ergo septa pudicitia agunt, nullis spectaculorum illecebris, nullis\nconviviorum irritationibus corruptae. Litterarum secreta viri pariter ac\nfeminae ignorant. Paucissima in tam numerosa gente adulteria; quorum\npoena praesens et maritis permissa. Accisis crinibus, nudatam, coram\npropinquis, expellit domo maritus, ac per omnem vicum verbere agit:\npublicatae enim pudicitiae nulla venia: non forma, non aetate, non opibus\nmaritum invenerit. Neme enim illic vitia ridet: nec corrumpere et\ncorrumpi saeculum vocatur. Melius quidem adhuc eae civitates, in quibus\ntantum virgines nubunt, et cum spe votoque uxoris semel transigitur. Sic\nunum accipiunt maritum, quo modo unum corpus unamque vitam, ne ulla\ncogitatio ultra, ne longior cupiditas, ne tanquam maritum, sed tanquam\nmatrimonium ament. Numerum liberorum finire, aut quenquam ex agnatis\nnecare, flagitium habetur: plusque ibi boni mores valent, quam alibi\nbonae leges.\n\nXX. In omni domo nudi ac sordidi, in hos artus, in haec corpora, quae\nmiramur, excrescunt. Sua quemque mater uberibus alit, nec ancillis ac\nnutricibus delegantur. Dominum ac servum nullis educationis deliciis\ndignoscas: inter eadem pecora, in eadem humo degunt; donec aetas separet\ningenuos, virtus agnoscat. Sera juvenum Venus; eoque inexhausta pubertas:\nnec virgines festinantur; eadem juventa, similis proceritas: pares\nvalidaeque miscentur; ac robora parentum liberi referunt. Sororum filiis\nidem apud avunculum, qui ad patrem honor. Quidam sanctiorem arctioremque\nhunc nexum sanguinis arbitrantur, et in accipiendis obsidibus magis\nexigunt; tanquam et in animum firmius, et domum latius teneant. Heredes\ntamen successoresque sui cuique liberi: et nullum testamentum. Si liberi\nnon sunt, proximus gradus in possessione fratres, patrui, avunculi.\nQuanto plus propinquorum, quo major affinium numerus, tanto gratiosior\nsenectus, nec ulla orbitatis pretia.\n\nXXI. Suscipere tam inimicitias, seu patris, seu propinqui, quam\namicitias, necesse est: nec implacabiles durant. Luitur enim etiam\nhomicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero, recipitque satisfactionem\nuniversa domus: utiliter in publicum; quia periculosiores sunt\ninimicitiae juxta libertatem. Convictibus et hospitiis non alia gens\neffusius indulget. Quemcunque mortalium arcere tecto, nefas habetur: pro\nfortuna quisque apparatis epulis excipit. Cum defecere, qui modo hospes\nfuerat, monstrator hospitii et comes: proximam domum non invitati adeunt:\nnec interest; pari humanitate accipiuntur. Notum ignotumque, quantum ad\njus hospitis, nemo discernit. Abeunti, si quid poposcerit, concedere\nmoris: et poscendi invicem eadem facilitas. Gaudent muneribus: sed nec\ndata imputant, nec acceptis obligantur. Victus inter hospites comis.\n\nXXII. Statim e somno, quem plerumque in diem extrahunt, lavantur, saepius\ncalida, ut apud quos plurimum hiems occupat. Lauti cibum capiunt:\nseparatae singulis sedes et sua cuique mensa: tum ad negotia, nec minus\nsaepe ad convivia, procedunt armati. Diem noctemque continuare potando,\nnulli probrum. Crebrae, ut inter vinolentos, rixae, raro conviciis,\nsaepius caede et vulneribus transiguntur. Sed et de reconciliandis\ninvicem inimicis et jungendis affinitatibus et asciscendis principibus,\nde pace denique ac bello plerumque in conviviis consultant: tanquam nullo\nmagis tempore aut ad simplices cogitationes pateat animus, aut ad magnas\nincalescat. Gens non astuta nec callida aperit adhuc secreta pectoris\nlicentia joci. Ergo detecta et nuda omnium mens postera die retractatur,\net salva utriusque temporis ratio est: deliberant, dum fingere nesciunt;\nconstituunt, dum errare non possunt.\n\nXXIII. Potui humor ex hordeo aut frumento, in quandam similitudinem vini\ncorruptus. Proximi ripae et vinum mercantur. Cibi simplices; agrestia\npoma, recens fera, aut lac concretum. Sine apparatu, sine blandimentis,\nexpellunt famem. Adversus sitim non eadem temperantia. Si indulseris\nebrietati suggerendo quantum concupiscunt, haud minus facile vitiis, quam\narmis vincentur.\n\nXXIV. Genus spectaculorum unum atque in omni coetu idem. Nudi juvenes,\nquibus id ludicrum est, inter gladios se atque infestas frameas saltu\njaciunt. Exercitatio artem paravit, ars decorem: non in quaestum tamen\naut mercedem; quamvis audacis lasciviae pretium est voluptas spectantium.\nAleam, quod mirere, sobrii inter seria exercent tanta lucrandi perdendive\ntemeritate, ut, cum omnia defecerunt, extremo ac novissimo jactu de\nlibertate ac de corpore contendant. Victus voluntariam servitutem adit:\nquamvis juvenior, quamvis robustior, alligari se ac venire patitur: ea\nest in re prava pervicacia: ipsi fidem vocant. Servos conditionis hujus\nper commercia tradunt, ut se quoque pudore victoriae exsolvant.\n\nXXV. Ceteris servis, non in nostrum morem descriptis per familiam\nministeriis, utuntur. Suam quisque sedem, suos penates regit. Frumenti\nmodum dominus, aut pecoris aut vestis, ut colono, injungit: et servus\nhactenus paret; cetera domus officia uxor ac liberi exsequuntur.\nVerberare servum ac vinculis et opere coercere, rarum. Occidere solent,\nnon disciplina et severitate, sed impetu et ira, ut inimicum, nisi quod\nimpune. Liberti non multum supra servos sunt, raro aliquod momentum in\ndomo, nunquam in civitate; exceptis duntaxat iis gentibus, quae\nregnantur: ibi enim et super ingenuos et super nobiles ascendunt: apud\nceteros impares libertini libertatis argumentum sunt.\n\nXXVI. Fenus agitare et in usuras extendere, igno tum: ideoque magis\nservatur, quam si vetitum esset. Agri pro numero cultorum ab universis in\nvices occupantur, quos mox inter se secundum dignationem partiuntur:\nfacilitatem partiendi camporum spatia praestant. Arva per annos mutant:\net superest ager; nec enim cum ubertate et amplitudine soli labore\ncontendunt, ut pomaria conserant et prata separent et hortos rigent: sola\nterrae seges imperatur. Unde annum quoque ipsum non in totidem digerunt\nspecies hiems et ver et aestas intellectum ac vocabula habent autumni\nperinde nomen ac bona ignorantur.\n\nXXVII. Funerum nulla ambitio; id solum observatur, ut corpora clarorum\nvirorum certis lignis crementur. Struem rogi nec vestibus nec odoribus\ncumulant: sua cuique arma, quorundam igni et equus adjicitur. Sepulcrum\ncaespes erigit; monumentorum arduum et operosum honorem, ut gravem\ndefunctis, aspernantur. Lamenta ac lacrimas cito, dolorem et tristitiam\ntarde ponunt. Feminis lugere honestum est; viris meminisse. Haec in\ncommune de omnium Germanorum origine ac moribus accepimus: nunc\nsingularum gentium instituta ritusque, quatenus differant, quae nationes\ne Germania in Gallias commigraverint, expediam.\n\nXXVIII. Validiores olim Gallorum res fuisse, summus auctorum divus Julius\ntradit: eoque credibile est etiam Gallos in Germaniam transgressos.\nQuantulum enim amnis obstabat, quo minus, ut quaeque gens evaluerat,\noccuparet permutaretque sedes, promiscuas adhuc et nulla regnorum\npotentia divisas? Igitur inter Hercyniam sylvam Rhenumque et Moenum amnes\nHelvetii, ulteriora Boii, Gallica utraque gens, tenuere. Manet adhuc\n_Boihemi_ nomen, signatque loci veterem memoriam, quamvis mutatis\ncultoribus. Sed utrum Aravisci in Pannoniam ab Osis, Germanorum natione,\nan Osi ab Araviscis in Germaniam commigraverint, cum eodem adhuc sermone,\ninstitutis, moribus utantur, incertum est: quia, pari olim inopia ac\nlibertate, eadem utriusque ripae bona malaque erant. Treveri et Nervii\ncirca affectationem Germanicae originis ultro ambitiosi sunt, tanquam per\nhanc gloriam sanguinis a similitudine et inertia Gallorum separentur.\nIpsam Rheni ripam haud dubie Germanorum populi colunt, Vangiones,\nTriboci, Nemetes. Ne Ubii quidem, quanquam Romana colonia esse meruerint\nac libentius Agrippinenses conditoris sui nomine vocentur, origine\nerubescunt, transgressi olim et experimento fidei super ipsam Rheni ripam\ncollocati, ut arcerent, non ut custodirentur.\n\nXXIX. Omnium harum gentium virtute praecipui Batavi, non multum ex ripa,\nsed insulam Rheni amnis colunt, Chattorum quondam populus et seditione\ndomestica in eas sedes transgressus, in quibus pars Romani imperii\nfierent. Manet honos et antiquae societatis insigne: nam nec tributis\ncontemnuntur, nec publicanis atterit: exempti oneribus et collationibus\net tantum in usum proeliorum sepositi, velut tela atque arma, bellis\nreservantur. Est in eodem obsequio et Mattiacorum gens; protulit enim\nmagnitudo populi Romani ultra Rhenum, ultraque veteres terminos, imperii\nreverentiam. Ita sede finibusque in sua ripa, mente animoque nobiscum\nagunt, cetera similes Batavis, nisi quod ipso adhuc terrae suae solo et\ncoelo acrius animantur. Non numeraverim inter Germaniae populos, quanquam\ntrans Rhenum Danubiumque consederint, eos, qui Decumates agros exercent.\nLevissimus quisque Gallorum et inopia audax, dubiae possessionis solum\noccupavere. Mox limite acto promotisque praesidiis, sinus imperii et pars\nprovinciae habentur.\n\nXXX. Ultra hos Chatti initium sedis ab Hercynio saltu inchoant, non ita\neffusis ac palustribus locis ut ceterae civitates, in quas Germania\npatescit; durant siquidem colles, paulatim rarescunt, et Chattos suos\nsaltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit. Duriora genti corpora,\nstricti artus, minax vultus et major animi vigor. Multum, ut inter\nGermanos, rationis ac solertiae: praeponere electos, audire praepositos,\nnosse ordines, intelligere occasiones, differre impetus, disponere diem,\nvallare noctem, fortunam inter dubia, virtutem inter certa numerare:\nquodque rarissimum nec nisi ratione disciplinae concessum, plus reponere\nin duce, quam exercitu. Omne robur in pedite, quem, super arma,\nferramentis quoque et copiis onerant. Alios ad proelium ire videas,\nChattos ad bellum. Rari excursus et fortuita pugna; equestrium sane\nvirium id proprium, cito parare victoriam, cito cedere: velocitas juxta\nformidinem, cunctatio propior constantiae est.\n\nXXXI. Et aliis Germanorum populis usurpatum rara et privata cujusque\naudentia apud Chattos in consensum vertit, ut primum adoleverint, crinem\nbarbamque submittere, nec, nisi hoste caeso, exuere votivum obligatumque\nvirtuti oris habitum. Super sanguinem et spolia revelant frontem, seque\ntum demum pretia nascendi retulisse, dignosque patria ac parentibus\nferunt. Ignavis et imbellibus manet squalor. Fortissimus quisque ferreum\ninsuper annulum (ignominiosum id genti) velut vinculum gestat, donec se\ncaede hostis absolvat. Plurimis Chattorum hic placet habitus. Jamque\ncanent insignes, et hostibus simul suisque monstrati. Omnium penes hos\ninitia pugnarum: haec prima semper acies, visu nova; nam ne in pace\nquidem vultu mitiore mansuescunt. Nulli domus aut ager aut aliqua cura:\nprout ad quemque venere, aluntur: prodigi alieni, contemptores sui donec\nexsanguis senectus tam durae virtuti impares faciat.\n\nXXXII. Proximi Chattis certum jam alveo Rhenum, quique terminus esse\nsufficiat, Usipii ac Tencteri colunt. Tencteri, super solitum bellorum\ndecus, equestris disciplinae arte praecellunt: nec major apud Chattos\npeditum laus, quam Tencteris equitum. Sic instituere majores, posteri\nimitantur; hi lusus infantium, haec juvenum aemulatio, perseverant senes\ninter familiam et penates et jura successionum equi traduntur; excipit\nfilius, non, ut cetera, maximus natu, sed prout ferox bello et melior.\n\nXXXIII. Juxta Tencteros Bructeri olim occurrebant: nunc Chamavos et\nAngrivarios immigrasse narratur, pulsis Bructeris ac penitus excisis\nvicinarum consensu nationum, seu superbiae odio, seu praedae dulcedine,\nseu favore quodam erga nos deorum: nam ne spectaculo quidem proelii\ninvidere: super sexaginta millia, non armis telisque Romanis, sed, quod\nmagnificentius est, oblectationi oculisque ceciderunt. Maneat, quaeso,\nduretque gentibus, si non amor nostri, at certe odium sui: quando,\nurgentibus imperii fatis, nihil jam praestare fortuna majus potest, quam\nhostium discordiam.\n\nXXXIV. Angrivarios et Chamavos a tergo Dulgibini et Chasuarii cludunt\naliaeque gentes, haud perinde memoratae. A fronte Frisii excipiunt.\nMajoribus minoribusque Frisiis vocabulum est ex modo virium: utraeque\nnationes usque ad Oceanum Rheno praetexuntur, ambiuntque immensos insuper\nlacus et Romanis classibus navigatos. Ipsum quin etiam Oceanum illa\ntentavimus: et superesse adhuc Herculis columnas fama vulgavit; sive\nadiit Hercules, seu, quicquid ubique magnificum est, in claritatem ejus\nreferre consensimus. Nec defuit audentia Druso Germanico: sed obstitit\nOceanus in se simul atque in Herculem inquiri. Mox nemo tentavit;\nsanctiusque ac reverentius visum, de actis deorum credere, quam scire.\n\nXXXV. Hactenus in Occidentem Germaniam novimus. In Septentrionem ingenti\nflexu redit. Ac primo statim Chaucorum gens, quanquam incipiat a Frisiis\nac partem littoris occupet, omnium, quas exposui, gentium lateribus\nobtenditur, donec in Chattos usque sinuetur. Tam immensum terrarum\nspatium non tenent tantum Chauci, sed et implent: populus inter Germanos\nnobilissimus, quique magnitudinem suam malit justitia tueri: sine\ncupiditate, sine impotentia, quieti secretique, nulla provocant bella,\nnullis raptibus aut latrociniis populantur. Id praecipuum virtutis ac\nvirium argumentum est, quod, ut superiores agant, non per injurias\nassequuntur. Prompta tamen omnibus arma, ac, si res poscat, exercitus,\nplurimum virorum equorumque: et quiescentibus eadem fama.\n\nXXXVI. In latere Chaucorum Chattorumque Cherusci nimiam ac marcentem diu\npacem illacessiti nutrierunt; idque jucundius, quam tutius, fuit: quia\ninter impotentes et validos falso quiescas; ubi manu agitur, modestia ac\nprobitas nomina superioris sunt. Ita, qui olim boni aequique Cherusci,\nnunc inertes ac stulti vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna in sapientiam\ncessit. Tracti ruina Cheruscorum et Fosi, contermina gens, adversarum\nrerum ex aequo socii, cum in secundis minores fuissent.\n\nXXXVII. Eundem Germaniae sinum proximi Oceano Cimbri tenent, parva nunc\ncivitas, sed gloria ingens; veterisque famae lata vestigia manent,\nutraque ripa castra ac spatia, quorum ambitu nunc quoque metiaris molem\nmanusque gentis et tam magni exitus fidem. Sexcentesimum et quadragesimum\nannum urbs nostra agebat, cum primum Cimbrorum audita sunt arma, Caecilio\nMetello et Papirio Carbone consulibus. Ex quo si ad alterum Imperatoris\nTrajani consulatum computemus, ducenti ferme et decem anni colliguntur;\ntamdiu Germania vincitur. Medio tam longi aevi spatio, multa invicem\ndamna: non Samnis, non Poeni, non Hispaniae Galliaeve, ne Parthi quidem\nsaepius admonuere: quippe regno Arsacis acrior est Germanorum libertas.\nQuid enim aliud nobis, quam caedem Crassi, amisso et ipse Pacoro, infra\nVentidium dejectus Oriens objecerit? At Germani, Carbone et Cassio et\nScauro Aurelio et Servilio Caepione, M. quoque Manlio fusis vel captis,\nquinque simul consulares exercitus Populo Romano, Varum, tresque cum eo\nlegiones, etiam Caesari abstulerunt: nec impune C. Marius in Italia,\ndivus Julius in Gallia, Drusus ac Nero et Germanicus in suis eos sedibus\nperculerunt. Mox ingentes C. Caesaris minae in ludibrium versae. Inde\notium, donec occasione discordiae nostrae et civilium armorum, expugnatis\nlegionum hibernis, etiam Gallias affectavere: ac rursus pulsi, inde\nproximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi sunt.\n\nXXXVIII. Nunc de Suevis dicendum est, quorum non una, ut Chattorum\nTencterorumve, gens: majorem enim Germaniae partem obtinent, propriis\nadhuc nationibus nominibusque discreti, quanquam in commune Suevi\nvocentur. Insigne gentis obliquare crinem nodoque substringere: sic Suevi\na ceteris Germanis, sic Suevorum ingenui a servis separantur in aliis\ngentibus, seu cognatione aliqua Suevorum, seu quod saepe accidit,\nimitatione, rarum et intra juventae spatium; apud Suevos, usque ad\ncanitiem, horrentem capillum retro sequuntur, ac saepe in ipso solo\nvertice religant. Principes et ornatiorem habent: ea cura formae, sed\ninnoxiae: neque enim ut ament amenturve; in altitudinem quandam et\nterrorem, adituri bella, compti, ut hostium oculis, ornantur.\n\nXXXIX. Vetustissimos se nobilissimosque Suevorum Semnones memorant.\nFides antiquitatis religione firmatur. Stato tempore in silvam auguriis\npatrum et prisca formidine sacram, omnes ejusdem sanguinis populi\nlegationibus coeunt, caesoque publice homine celebrant barbari ritus\nhorrenda primordia. Est et alia luco reverentia. Nemo nisi vinculo\nligatus ingreditur, ut minor et potestatem numinis prae se ferens, Si\nforte prolapsus est, attolli et insurgere haud licitum: per humum\nevolvuntur: eoque omnis superstitio respicit, tanquam inde initia gentis,\nibi regnator omnium deus, cetera subjecta atque parentia. Adjicit\nauctoritatem fortuna Semnonum: centum pagis habitantur; magnoque corpore\nefficitur, ut se Suevorum caput credant.\n\nXL. Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis ac valentissimis\nnationibus cincti, non per obsequium, sed proeliis et periclitando tuti\nsunt. Reudigni deinde et Aviones et Anglii et Varini et Eudoses et\nSuardones et Nuithones fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur: nec quidquam\nnotabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune Nerthum, id est Terram matrem\ncolunt, eamque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis arbitrantur. Est\nin insula Oceani castum nemus, dicatumque in eo vehiculum, veste\ncontectum attingere uni sacerdoti concessum. Is adesse penetrali deam\nintelligit, vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur.\nLaeti tunc dies, festa loca, quaecumque adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non\nbella ineunt, non arma sumunt; clausum omne ferrum: pax et quies tunc\ntantum nota, tunc tantum amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam\nconversatione mortalium deam templo reddat. Mox vehiculum et vestes, et,\nsi credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant,\nquos statim idem lacus haurit; arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia,\nquid sit illud, quod tantum perituri vident.\n\nXLI. Et haec quidem pars Suevorum in secretiora Germaniae porrigitur.\nPropior, ut quo modo paulo ante Rhenum, sic nunc Danubium sequar,\nHermundurorum civitas, fida Romanis, eoque solis Germanorum non in ripa\ncommercium, sed penitus, atque in splendidissima Rhaetiae provinciae\ncolonia. Passim et sine custode transeunt: et, cum ceteris gentibus arma\nmodo castraque nostra ostendamus, his domos villasque patefecimus non\nconcupiscentibus. In Hermunduris Albis oritur, flumen inclitum et notum\nolim; nunc tantum auditur.\n\nXLII. Juxta Hermunduros Narisci, ac deinde Marcomanni et Quadi agunt.\nPraecipua Marcomannorum gloria viresque, atque ipsa etiam sedes, pulsis\nolim Boiis, virtute parta. Nec Narisci Quadive degenerant. Eaque\nGermaniae velut frons est, quatenus Danubio peragitur. Marcomannis\nQuadisque usque ad nostram memoriam reges manserunt ex gente ipsorum,\nnobile Marobodui et Tudri genus: jam et externos patiuntur. Sed vis et\npotentia regibus ex auctoritate Romana: raro armis nostris, saepius\npecunia juvantur, nec minus valent.\n\nXLIII. Retro Marsigni, Gothini, Osi, Burii, terga Marcomannorum\nQuadorumque claudunt: e quibus Marsigni et Burii sermone cultuque Suevos\nreferunt Gothinos Gallica, Osos Pannonica lingua coarguit non esse\nGermanos, et quod tributa patiuntur. Partem tributorum Sarmatae, partem\nQuadi, ut alienigenis, imponunt. Gothini, quo magis pudeat, et ferrum\neffodiunt. Omnesque hi populi pauca campestrium, ceterum saltus et\nvertices montium jugumque insederunt. Dirimit enim scinditque Sueviam\ncontinuum montium jugum, ultra quod plurimae gentes agunt: ex quibus\nlatissime patet Lygiorum nomen in plures civitates diffusum.\nValentissimas nominasse sufficiet, Arios, Helveconas, Manimos, Elysios,\nNaharvalos. Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur.\nPraesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu: sed deos, interpretatione Romana,\nCastorem Pollucemque memorant: ea vis numini; nomen Alcis. Nulla\nsimulacra, nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium: ut fratres tamen,\nut juvenes, venerantur. Ceterum Arii super vires, quibus enumeratos paulo\nante populos antecedunt, truces, insitae feritati arte ac tempore\nlenocinantur. Nigra scuta, tincta corpora: atras ad proelia noctes\nlegunt: ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exercitus terrorem\ninferant, nullo hostium sustinente novum ac velut infernum aspectum: nam\nprimi in omnibus proeliis oculi vincuntur. Trans Lygios Gothones\nregnantur, paulo jam adductius, quam ceterae Germanorum gentes, nondum\ntamen supra libertatem. Protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemovii\nomniumque harum gentium insigne, rotunda scuta, breves gladii, et erga\nreges obsequium.\n\nXLIV. Suionum hinc civitates, ipso in Oceano, praeter viros armaque\nclassibus valent: forma navium eo differt, quod utrimque prora paratam\nsemper appulsui frontem agit: nec velis ministrantur, nec remos in\nordinem lateribus adjungunt. Solutum, ut in quibusdam fluminum, et\nmutabile, ut res poscit, hinc vel illinc remigium. Est apud illos et\nopibus honos; eoque unus imperitat, nullis jam exceptionibus, non\nprecario jure parendi. Nec arma, ut apud ceteros Germanos, in promiscuo,\nsed clausa sub custode et quidem servo: quia subitos hostium incursus\nprohibet Oceanus, otiosa porro armatorum manus facile lasciviunt:\nenimvero neque nobilem neque ingenuum ne libertinum quidem, armis\npraeponere regia utilitas est.\n\nXLV. Trans Suionas aliud mare, pigrum ac prope immotum, quo cingi\ncludique terrarum orbem hinc fides, quod extremus cadentis jam solis\nfulgor in ortus edurat adeo clarus, ut sidera hebetet; sonum insuper\naudiri, formasque deorum et radios capitis aspici persuasio adjicit.\nIlluc usque, et fama vera, tantum natura. Ergo jam dextro Suevici maris\nlittore Aestyorum gentes alluuntur: quibus ritus habitusque Suevorum;\nlingua Britannicae propior. Matrem deum venerantur: insigne\nsuperstitionis, formas aprorum gestant; id pro armis omnique tutela:\nsecurum deae cultorem etiam inter hostes praestat. Rarus ferri, frequens\nfustium usus. Frumenta ceterosque fructus patientius, quam pro solita\nGermanorum inertia, laborant. Sed et mare scrutantur, ac soli omnium\nsuccinum, quod ipsi glesum vocant inter vada atque in ipso littore\nlegunt. Nec, quae natura quaeve ratio gignat, ut barbaris, quaesitum\ncompertumve. Diu quin etiam inter cetera ejectamenta maris jacebat, donec\nluxuria nostra dedit nomen: ipsis in nullo usu: rude legitur, informe\nperfertur, pretiumque mirantes accipiunt. Succum tamen arborum esse\nintelligas, quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque\ninterlucent, quae implicata humore, mox, durescente materia, cluduntur.\nFecundiora igitur nemora lucosque, sicut Orientis secretis, ubi thura\nbalsamaque sudantur, ita Occidentis insulis terrisque inesse, crediderim;\nquae vicini solis radiis expressa atque liquentia in proximum mare\nlabuntur, ac vi tempestatum in adversa littora exundant. Si naturam\nsuccini admoto igne tentes, in modum taedae accenditur, alitque flammam\npinguem et olentem: mox ut in picem resinamve lentescit. Suionibus\nSitonum gentes continuantur. Cetera similes, uno differunt, quod femina\ndominatur: in tantum non modo a libertate, sed etiam a servitute\ndegenerant.\n\nXLVI. Hic Sueviae finis. Peucinorum Vene dorumque et Fennorum nationes\nGermanis an Sarmatis ascribam, dubito: quanquam Peucini, quos quidam\nBastarnas vocant, sermone, cultu, sede ac domiciliis, ut Germani, agunt.\nSordes omnium ac torpor procerum: connubiis mixtis, nonnihil in\nSarmatarum habitum foedantur. Venedi multum ex moribus traxerunt. Nam\nquidquid inter Peucinos Fennosque silvarum ac montium erigitur,\nlatrociniis pererrant. Hi tamen inter Germanos potius referuntur, quia et\ndomos figunt et scuta gestant et pedum usu ac pernicitate gaudent; quae\nomnia diversa Sarmatis sunt, in plaustro equoque viventibus. Fennis mira\nferitas, foeda paupertas: non arma, non equi, non penates: victui herba,\nvestitui pelles, cubile humus: sola in sagittis spes, quas, inopia ferri,\nossibus asperant. Idemque venatus viros pariter ac feminas alit. Passim\nenim comitantur, partemque praedae petunt. Nec aliud infantibus ferarum\nimbriumque suffugium, quam ut in aliquo ramorum nexu contegantur: huc\nredeunt juvenes, hoc senum receptaculum. Sed beatius arbitrantur, quam\ningemere agris, illaborare domibus, suas alienasque fortunas spe metuque\nversare. Securi adversus homines, securi adversus deos, rem difficillimam\nassecuti sunt, ut illis ne vote quidem opus esset. Cetera jam fabulosa:\nHellusios et Oxionas ora hominum vultusque, corpora atque artus ferarum,\ngerere: quod ego, ut incompertum, in medium relinquam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCN.

Excusat se, ne provinciam sortiatur proconsul. 43.\nObit non sine veneni suspicione, a Domitiano dati. 44. Ejus aetas,\nhabitus, honores, opes. 45. Mortis opportunitas ante Domitiani\natrocitates. 46. Questus auctoris et ex virtute solatia. Fama Agricolae\nad posteros transmissa.\n\n\n\n\nI. Clarorum virorum facta moresque posteris tradere, antiquitus usitatum,\nne nostris quidem temporibus quanquam incuriosa suorum aetas omisit,\nquotiens magna aliqua ac nobilis virtus vicit ac supergressa est vitium\nparvis magnisque civitatibus commune, ignorantiam recti et invidiam. Sed\napud priores, ut agere digna memoratu pronum magisque in aperto erat, ita\nceleberrimus quisque ingenio ad prodendam virtutis memoriam, sine gratia\naut ambitione, bonae tantum conscientiae pretio ducebatur. Ac plerique\nsuam ipsi vitam narrare fiduciam potius morum, quam arrogantiam arbitrati\nsunt: nec id Rutilio et Scauro citra fidem aut obtrectationi fuit: adeo\nvirtutes iisdem temporibus optime aestimantur, quibus facillime\ngignuntur. At nunc narraturo mihi vitam defuncti hominis, venia opus\nfuit: quam non petissem incursaturus tam saeva et infesta virtutibus\ntempora.\n\nII. Legimus, cum Aruleno Rustico Paetus Thrasea, Herennio Senecioni\nPriscus Helvidius laudati essent, capitale fuisse: neque in ipsos modo\nauctores, sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum, delegato triumviris\nministerio, ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro\nurerentur. Scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani et libertatem senatus\net conscientiam generis humani aboleri arbitrabantur, expulsis insuper\nsapientiae professoribus atque omni bona arte in exilium acta, ne quid\nusquam honestum occurreret. Dedimus profecto grande patientiae\ndocumentum: et sicut vetus aetas vidit, quid ultimum in libertate esset,\nita nos, quid in servitute, adempto per inquisitiones et loquendi\naudiendique commercio. Memoriam quoque ipsam cum voce perdidissemus, si\ntam in nostra potestate esset oblivisci, quam tacere.\n\nIII. Nunc demum redit animus: et quanquam primo statim beatissimi saeculi\nortu Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabiles miscuerit, principatum ac\nlibertatem, augeatque quotidie felicitatem imperii Nerva Trajanus, nec\nspem modo ac votum securitas publica, sed ipsius voti fiduciam ac robur\nassumpserit; natura tamen infirmitatis humanae tardiora sunt remedia,\nquam mala; et, ut corpora nostra lente augescunt, cito exstinguuntur, sic\ningenia studiaque oppresseris facilius, quam revocaveris. Subit quippe\netiam ipsius inertiae dulcedo: et invisa primo desidia postremo amatur.\nQuid, si per quindecim annos, grande mortalis aevi spatium, multi\nfortuitis casibus, promptissimus quisque saevitia principis\ninterciderunt? Pauci, et, ut ita dixerim, non modo aliorum, sed etiam\nnostri superstites sumus, exemptis e media vita tot annis, quibus juvenes\nad senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis terminos per\nsilentium venimus. Non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi voce memoriam\nprioris servitutis ac testimonium praesentium bonorum composuisse. Hic\ninterim liber honori Agricolae soceri mei destinatus, professione\npietatis aut laudatus erit aut excusatus.\n\nIV. Cnaeus Julius Agricola, veteri et illustri Forojuliensium colonia\nortus, utrumque avum procuratorem Caesarum habuit: quae equestris\nnobilitas est. Pater Julius Graecinus, senatorii ordinis, studio\neloquentiae sapientiaeque notus, iisque ipsis virtutibus iram Caii\nCaesaris meritus: namque M. Silanum accusare jussus et, quia abnuerat,\ninterfectus est. Mater Julia Procilla fuit, rarae castitatis: in hujus\nsinu indulgentiaque educatus, per omnem honestarum artium cultum\npueritiam adolescentiamque transegit. Arcebat eum ab illecebris\npeccantium, praeter ipsius bonam integramque naturam, quod statim\nparvulus sedem ac magistram studiorum Massiliam habuit, locum Graeca\ncomitate et provinciali parsimonia mistum ac bene compositum. Memoria\nteneo solitum ipsum narrare, se in prima juventa studium philosophiae\nacrius, ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori, hausisse, ni prudentia\nmatris incensum ac flagrantem animum coercuisset. Scilicet sublime et\nerectum ingenium pulchritudinem ac speciem excelsae magnaeque gloriae\nvehementius, quam caute, appetebat: mox mitigavit ratio et aetas:\nretinuitque, quod est difficillimum, ex sapientia modum.\n\nV. Prima castrorum rudimenta in Britannia Suetonio Paullino, diligenti ac\nmoderato duci, approbavit, electus, quem contubernio aestimaret. Nec\nAgricola licenter more juvenum, qui militiam in lasciviam vertunt, neque\nsegniter ad voluptates et commeatus titulum tribunatus et inscitiam\nretulit: sed noscere provinciam, nosci exercitui, discere a peritis,\nsequi optimos, nihil appetere jactatione, nihil ob formidinem recusare,\nsimulque et anxius et intentus agere. Non sane alias exercitatior\nmagisque in ambiguo Britannia fuit: trucidati veterani, incensae\ncoloniae, intercepti exercitus; tum de salute, mox de victoria,\ncertavere. Quae cuncta, etsi consiliis ductuque alterius agebantur ac\nsumma rerum et recuperatae provinciae gloria in ducem cessit, artem et\nusum et stimulos addidere juveni; intravitque animum militaris gloriae\ncupido ingrata temporibus, quibus sinistra erga eminentes interpretatio,\nnec minus periculum ex magna fama, quam ex mala.\n\nVI. Hinc ad capessendos magistratus in urbem digressus, Domitiam\nDecidianam, splendidis natalibus ortam, sibi junxit; idque matrimonium ad\nmajora nitenti decus ac robur fuit; vixeruntque mira concordia, per\nmutuam caritatem et invicem se anteponendo: nisi quod in bona uxore tanto\nmajor laus, quanto in mala plus culpae est. Sors quaesturae provinciam\nAsiam, proconsulem Salvium Titianum dedit: quorum neutro corruptus est;\nquanquam et provincia dives ac parata peccantibus, et proconsul in omnem\naviditatem pronus, quantalibet facilitate redempturus esset mutuam\ndissimulationem mali. Auctus est ibi filia, in subsidium simul et\nsolatium: nam filium ante sublatum brevi amisit. Mox inter quaesturam ac\ntribunatum plebis atque etiam ipsum tribunatus annum quiete et otio\ntransiit, gnarus sub Nerone temporum, quibus inertia pro sapientia fuit.\nIdem praeturae tenor et silentium; nec enim jurisdictio obvenerat: ludos\net inania honoris medio rationis atque abundantiae duxit, uti longe a\nluxuria, ita famae propior. Tum electus a Galba ad dona templorum\nrecognoscenda, diligentissima conquisitione fecit, ne cujus alterius\nsacrilegium respublica, quam Neronis sensisset.\n\nVII. Sequens annus gravi vulnere animum domumque ejus afflixit: nam\nclassis Othoniana, licenter vaga, dum Intemelios (Liguriae pars est)\nhostiliter populatur, matrem Agricolae in praediis suis interfecit:\npraediaque ipsa et magnam patrimonii partem diripuit, quae causa caedis\nfuerat. Igitur ad solemnia pietatis profectus Agricola, nuntio affectati\na Vespasiano imperii deprehensus ac statim in partes transgressus est.\nInitia principatus ac statim urbis Mucianus regebat, juvene admodum\nDomitiano et ex paterna fortuna tantum licentiam usurpante. Is missum ad\ndelectus agendos Agricolam integreque ac strenue versatum, vicesimae\nlegioni, tarde ad sacramentum transgressae; praeposuit, ubi decessor\nseditiose agere narrabatur: quippe legatis quoque consularibus nimia ac\nformidolosa erat. Nec legatus praetorius ad cohibendum potens, incertum,\nsuo an militum ingenio: ita successor simul et ultor electus, rarissima\nmoderatione maluit videri invenisse bonos, quam fecisse.\n\nVIII. Praeerat tunc Britanniae Vettius Bolanus placidius, quam feroci\nprovincia dignum est: temperavit Agricola vim suam ardoremque compescuit,\nne incresceret; peritus obsequi eruditusque utilia honestis miscere.\nBrevi deinde Britannia consularem Petilium Cerialem accepit. Habuerunt\nvirtutes spatium exemplorum. Sed primo Cerialis labores modo et\ndiscrimina, mox et gloriam communicabat: saepe parti exercitus in\nexperimentum, aliquando majoribus copiis ex eventu praefecit: nec\nAgricola unquam in suam famam gestis exsultavit; ad auctorem et ducem, ut\nminister, fortunam referebat: ita virtute in obsequendo, verecundia in\npraedicando, extra invidiam, nec extra gloriam erat.\n\nIX. Revertentem ab legatione legionis divus Vespasianus inter patricios\nascivit, ac deinde provinciae Aquitaniae praeposuit, splendidae in primis\ndignitatis, administratione ac spe consulatus, cui destinarat. Credunt\nplerique militaribus ingeniis subtilitatem deesse, quia castrensis\njurisdictio secura et obtusior ac plura manu agens calliditatem fori non\nexerceat. Agricola naturali prudentia, quamvis inter togatos, facile\njusteque agebat. Jam vero tempora curarum remissionumque divisa: ubi\nconventus ac judicia poscerent, gravis, intentus, severus, et saepius\nmisericors; ubi officio satisfactum, nulla ultra potestatis persona:\ntristitiam et arrogantiam et avaritiam exuerat: nec illi, quod est\nrarissimum, aut facilitas auctoritatem aut severitas amorem deminuit.\nIntegritatem atque abstinentiam in tanto viro referre, injuria virtutum\nfuerit. Ne famam quidem, cui etiam saepe boni indulgent, ostentanda\nvirtute, aut per artem quaesivit: procul ab aemulatione adversus\ncollegas, procul a contentione adversus procuratores, et vincere\ninglorium, et atteri sordidum arbitrabatur. Minus triennium in ea\nlegatione detentus ac statim ad spem consulatus revocatus est, comitante\nopinione Britanniam ei provinciam dari nullis in hoc suis sermonibus sed\nquia par videbatur. Haud semper errat fama, aliquando et elegit. Consul\negregiae tum spei filiam juveni mihi despondit ac post Consulatum\ncollocavit, et statim Britanniae praepositus est, adjecto pontificatus\nsacerdotio.\n\nX. Britanniae situm populosque, multis scriptoribus memoratos non in\ncomparationem curae ingeniive referam; sed quia tum primum perdomita est.\nIta quae priores nondum comperta eloquentia percoluere, rerum fide\ntradentur. Britannia, insularum quas Romana notitia complectitur, maxima,\nspatio ac coelo in orientem Germaniae, in occidentem Hispaniae\nobtenditur: Gallis in meridiem etiam inspicitur: septemtrionalia ejus,\nnullis contra terris, vasto atque aperto mari pulsantur. Formam totius\nBritanniae Livius veterum, Fabius Rusticus recentium eloquentissimi\nauctores, oblongae scutulae vel bipenni assimulavere: et est ea facies\ncitra Caledoniam, unde et in universum fama est transgressa: sed\nimmensunt et enorme spatium procurrentium extremo jam littore terrarum,\nvelut in cuneum tenuatur. Hanc oram novissimi maris tunc primum Romana\nclassis circumvecta insulam esse Britanniam affirmavit, ac simul\nincognitas ad id tempus insulas, quas Orcadas vocant, invenit domuitque.\nDispecta est et Thule, nam hactenus jussum, et hiems appetebat; sed mare\npigrum et grave remigantibus; perhibent ne ventis quidem perinde attolli:\ncredo, quod rariores terrae montesque, causa ac materia tempestatum, et\nprofunda moles continui maris tardius impellitur. Naturam Oceani atque\naestus neque quaerere hujus operis est, ac multi retulere; unum\naddiderim: nusquam latius dominari mare, multum fluminum huc atque illuc\nferre, nec littore tenus accrescere aut resorberi, sed influere penitus\natque ambire, et jugis etiam atque montibus inseri velut in suo.\n\nXI. Ceterum Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerint, indigenae an\nadvecti, ut inter barbaros, parum compertum. Habitus corporum varii:\natque ex eo argumenta; namque rutilae Caledoniam habitantium comae, magni\nartus, Germanicam originem asseverant. Silurum colorati vultus et torti\nplerumque crines et posita contra Hispania Iberos veteres trajecisse\neasque sedes occupasse fidem faciunt. Proximi Gallis et similes sunt; seu\ndurante originis vi, seu, procurrentibus in diversa terris, positio coeli\ncorporibus habitum dedit: in universum tamen aestimanti, Gallos vicinam\ninsulam occupasse credibile est. Eorum sacra deprehendas superstitionum\npersuasione: sermo haud multum diversus; in deposcendis periculis eadem\naudacia et, ubi advenere, in detrectandis eadem formido. Plus tamen\nferociae Britanni praeferunt, ut quos nondum longa pax emollierit: nam\nGallos quoque in bellis floruisse accepimus: mox segnitia cum otio\nintravit, amissa virtute pariter ac libertate; quod Britannorum olim\nvictis evenit: ceteri manent, quales Galli fuerunt.\n\nXII. In pedite robur: quaedam nationes et curru proeliantur: honestior\nauriga, clientes propugnant. Olim regibus parebant, nunc per principes\nfactionibus et studiis trahuntur: nec aliud adversus validissimas gentes\npro nobis utilius, quam quod in commune non consulunt. Rarus duabus\ntribusve civitatibus ad propulsandum commune periculum conventus: ita,\ndum singuli pugnant, universi vincuntur. Coelum crebris imbribus ac\nnebulis foedum: asperitas frigorum abest. Dierum spatia ultra nostri\norbis mensuram, et nox clara et extrema Britanniae parte brevis, ut finem\natque initium lucis exiguo discrimine internoscas. Quod si nubes non\nofficiant, aspici per noctem solis fulgorem, nec occidere et exsurgere,\nsed transire affirmant. Scilicet extrema et plana terrarum, humili umbra,\nnon erigunt tenebras, infraque coelum et sidera nox cadit. Solum, praeter\noleam vitemque et cetera calidioribus terris oriri sueta, patiens frugum,\nfecundum. Tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt: eadem utriusque rei causa,\nmultus humor terrarum coelique. Fert Britannia aurum et argentum et alia\nmetalla, pretium victoriae: gignit et Oceanus margarita, sed subfusca ac\nliventia. Quidam artem abesse legentibus arbitrantur: nam in Rubro mari\nviva ac spirantia saxis avelli, in Britannia, prout expulsa sint,\ncolligi: ego facilius crediderim naturam margaritis deesse, quam nobis\navaritiam.\n\nXIII. Ipsi Britanni delectum ac tributa et injuncta imperii munera\nimpigre obeunt, si injuriae absint: has aegre tolerant, jam domiti ut\npareant, nondum ut serviant. Igitur primus omnium Romanorum divus Julius\ncum exercitu Britanniam ingressus, quanquam prospera pugna terruerit\nincolas ac littore potitus sit, potest videri ostendisse posteris, non\ntradidisse. Mox bella civilia et in rempublicam versa principum arma, ac\nlonga oblivio Britanniae etiam in pace. Consilium id divus Augustus\nvocabat, Tiberius praeceptum. Agitasse C. Caesarem de intranda Britannia\nsatis, constat, ni velox ingenio, mobilis poenitentiae, et ingentes\nadversus Germaniam conatus frustra fuissent. Divus Claudius auctor\noperis, transvectis legionibus auxiliisque et assumpto in partem rerum\nVespasiano: quod initium venturae mox fortunae fuit: domitae gentes,\ncapti reges, et monstratus fatis Vespasianus.\n\nXIV. Consularium primus Aulus Plautius praepositus, ac subinde Ostorius\nScapula, uterque bello egregius: redactaque paulatim in formam provinciae\nproxima pars Britanniae: addita insuper veteranorum colonia: quaedam\ncivitates Cogiduno regi donatae (is id nostram usque memoriam fidissimus\nmansit) ut vetere ac jam pridem recepta populi Romani consuetudine,\nhaberet instrumenta servitutis et reges. Mox Didius Gallus parta a\nprioribus continuit, paucis admodum castellis in ulteriora promotis, per\nquae fama aucti officii quaereretur. Didium Veranius excepit, isque intra\nannum exstinctus est. Suetonius hinc Paullinus biennio prosperas res\nhabuit, subactis nationibus firmatisque praesidiis: quorum fiducia Monara\ninsulam, ut vires rebellibus ministrantem, aggressus, terga occasioni\npatefecit.\n\nXV. Namque absentia legati remoto metu, Britanni agitare inter se mala\nservitutis, conferre injurias et interpretando accendere: nihil profici\npatientia, nisi ut graviora, tanquam ex facili toleratibus, imperentur:\nsingulos sibi olim reges fuisse, nunc binos imponi: e quibus legatus in\nsanguinem, procurator in bona saeviret. Aeque discordiam praepositorum,\naeque concordiam, subjectis exitiosam: alterius manus centuriones,\nalterius servos vim et contumelias miscere. Nihil jam cupiditati, nihil\nlibidini exceptum: in proelio fortiorem esse, qui spoliet; nunc ab\nignavis plerumque et imbellibus eripi domos, abstrahi liberos, injungi\ndelectus, tanquam mori tantum pro patria nescientibus: quantulum enim\ntransisse militum, si sese Britanni numerent? sic Germanias excussisse\njugum: et flumine, non Oceano, defendi: sibi patriam, conjuges, parentes,\nillis avaritiam et luxuriam causas belli esse. Recessuros, ut divus\nJulius recessisset, modo virtutes majorum suorum aemularentur. Neve\nproelii unius aut alterius eventu pavescerent: plus impetus, majorem\nconstantiam, penes miseros esse. Jam Britannorum etiam deos misereri, qui\nRomanum ducem absentem, qui relegatum in alia insula exercitum\ndetinerent: jam ipsos, quod difficillimum fuerit, deliberare: porro in\nejusmodi consiliis periculosius esse deprehendi, quam audere.\n\nXVI. His atque talibus invicem instincti, Boudicea, generis regii femina,\nduce (neque enim sexum in imperiis discernunt) sumpsere universi bellum:\nac sparsos per castella milites consectati, expugnatis praesidiis, ipsam\ncoloniam invasere, ut sedem servitutis: nec ullum in barbaris saevitiae\ngenus omisit ira et victoria. Quod nisi Paullinus, cognito provinciae\nmotu, propere subvenisset, amissa Britannia foret: quam unius proelii\nfortuna veteri patientiae restituit, tenentibus arma plerisque, quos\nconscientia defectionis et propius ex legato timor agitabat, ne, quanquam\negregius cetera, arroganter in deditos et, ut suae quoque injuriae\nultor, durius consuleret. Missus igitur Petronius Turpilianus, tanquam\nexorabilior: et delictis hostium novus, eoque poenitentiae mitior,\ncompositis prioribus, nihil ultra ausus, Trebellio Maximo provinciam\ntradidit. Trebellius segnior, et nullis castrorum experimentis, comitate\nquadam curandi provinciam tenuit. Didicere jam barbari quoque ignoscere\nvitiis blandientibus: et interventus civilium armorum praebuit justam\nsegnitiae excusationem: sed discordia laboratum, cum assuetus\nexpeditionibus miles otio lasciviret. Trebellius fuga ac latebris vitata\nexercitus ira, indecorus atque humilis, precario mox praefuit: ac velut\npacti, exercitus licentiam, dux salutem; et seditio sine sanguina stetit.\nNec Vettius Bolanus, manentibus adhuc civilibus bellis, agitavit\nBritanniam disciplina: eadem inertia erga hostes, similis petulantia\ncastrorum: nisi quod innocens Bolanus et nullis delictis invisus,\ncaritatem paraverat loco auctoritatis.\n\nXVII. Sed, ubi cum cetero orbe Vespasianus et Britanniam recuperavit,\nmagni duces, egregii exercitus, minuta hostium spes. Et terrorem statira\nintulit Petilius Cerialis, Brigantum civitatem, quae numerosissima\nprovinciae totius perhibetur, aggressus. Multa proelia, et aliquando non\nincruenta magnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria amplexus est aut bello.\nEt, cum Cerialis quidem alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset,\nsustinuit quoque molem Julius Frontinus, vir magnus quantum licebat,\nvalidamque et pugnacem Silurum gentem armis subegit, super virtutem\nhostium, locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus.\n\nXVIII. Hunc Britanniae statum, has bellorum vices media jam aestate\ntransgressus Agricola invenit, cum et milites, velut omissa expeditione,\nad securitatem, et hostes ad occasionem verterentur. Ordovicum civitas,\nhaud multo ante adventum ejus, alam, in finibus suis agentem, prope\nuniversam obtriverat eoque initio erecta provincia: et, quibus bellum\nvolentibus erat, probare exemplum, ac recentis legati animum opperiri,\ncum Agricola, quanquam transvecta aestas, sparsi per provinciam numeri,\npraesumpta apud militem illius anni quies, tarda et contraria bellum\ninchoaturo, et plerisque custodiri suspecta potius videbatur, ire obviam\ndiscrimini statuit: contractisque legionum vexillis et modica auxiliorum\nmanu, quia in aequum degredi Ordovices non audebant, ipse ante agmen, quo\nceteris par animus simili periculo esset, erexit aciem: caesaque prope\nuniversa gente, non ignarus instandum famae, ac, prout prima cessissent,\nterrorem ceteris fore, Monam insulam, cujus possessione revocatum\nPaullinum rebellione totius Britanniae supra memoravi, redigere in\npotestatem animo intendit. Sed, ut in dubiis consiliis, naves deerant:\nratio et constantia ducis transvexit. Depositis omnibus sarcinis,\nlectissimos auxiliarium, quibus nota vada et patrius nandi usus, quo\nsimul seque et arma et equos regunt, ita repente immisit, ut obstupefacti\nhostes, qui classem, qui naves, qui mare expectabant, nihil arduum aut\ninvictum crediderint sic ad bellum venientibus. Ita petita pace ac dedita\ninsula, clarus ac magnus haberi Agricola: quippe cui ingredienti\nprovinciam, quod tempus alii per ostentationem aut officiorum ambitum\ntransigunt, labor et periculum placuisset. Nec Agricola, prosperitate\nrerum in vanitatem usus, expeditionem aut victoriam vocabat victos\ncontinuisse: ne laureatis quidem gesta prosecutus est: sed ipsa\ndissimulatione famae famam auxit, aestimantibus, quanta futuri spe tam\nmagna tacuisset.\n\nXIX. Ceterum animorum provinciae prudens, simulque doctus per aliena\nexperimenta parum profici armis, si injuriae sequerentur, causas bellorum\nstatuit excidere. A se suisque orsus, primum domum suam coercuit; quod\nplerisque haud minus arduum est, quam provinciam regere. Nihil per\nlibertos servosque publicae rei: non studiis privatis nec ex\ncommendatione aut precibus centurionum milites ascire, sed optimum\nquemque fidissimum putare: omnia scire, non omnia exsequi: parvis\npeccatis veniam, magnis severitatem commodare: nec poena semper, sed\nsaepius poenitentia contentus esse: officiis et administrationibus potius\nnon peccaturos praeponere, quam damnare, cum peccassent. Frumenti et\ntributorum auctionem aequalitate munerum mollire, circumcisis, quae, in\nquaestum reperta, ipso tributo gravius tolerabantur: namque per ludibrium\nassidere clausis horreis et emere ultro frumenta, ac vendere pretio\ncogebantur: devortia itinerum et longinquitas regionum indicebatur, ut\ncivitates a proximis hibernis in remota et avia referrent, donec, quod\nomnibus in promptu erat, paucis lucrosum fieret.\n\nXX. Haec primo statim anno comprimendo, egregiam famam paci circumdedit;\nquae vel incuria vel intolerantia priorum haud minus quam bellum\ntimebatur. Sed, ubi aestas advenit, contracto exercitu, multus in agmine\nlaudare modestiam, disjectos coercere: loca castris ipse capere,\naestuaria ac silvas ipse praetentare; et nihil interim apud hostes\nquietum pati, quo minus subitis excursibus popularetur: atque, ubi satis\nterruerat, parcendo rursus irritamenta pacis ostentare. Quibus rebus\nmultae civitates, quae in illum diem ex aequo egerant, datis obsidibus,\niram posuere, et praesidiis castellisque circumdatae tanta ratione\ncuraque, ut nulla ante Britanniae nova pars illacessita transierit.\n\nXXI. Sequens hiems saluberrimis consiliis absumpta: namque, ut homines\ndispersi ac rudes, eoque in bella faciles, quieti et otio per voluptates\nassuescerent, hortari privatim, adjuvare publice, ut templa, fora, domus\nexstruerent, laudando promptos et castigando segnes: ita honoris\naemulatio pro necessitate erat. Jam vero principum filios liberalibus\nartibus erudire, et ingenia Britannorum studiis Gallorum anteferre, ut,\nqui modo linguam Romanam abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent. Inde\netiam habitus nostri honor et frequens toga: paulatimque discessum ad\ndelenimenta vitiorum, porticus et balnea et conviviorum elegantiam: idque\napud imperitos humanitas vocabatur, cum pars servitutis esset.\n\nXXII. Tertius expeditionum annus novas gentes aperuit, vastatis usque ad\nTaum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus: qua formidine territi hostes\nquanquam conflictatum saevis tempestatibus exercitum lacessere non ausi;\nponendisque insuper castellis spatium fuit. Annotabant periti non alium\nducem opportunitates locorum sapientius legisse: nullum ab Agricola\npositum castellum aut vi hostium expugnatum aut pactione ac fuga\ndesertum. Crebrae eruptiones: nam adversus moras obsidionis annuis copiis\nfirmabantur: ita intrepida ibi hiems, et sibi quisque praesidio, irritis\nhostibus eoque desperantibus, quia soliti plerumque damna aestatis\nhibernis eventibus pensare, tum aestate atque hieme juxta pellebantur.\nNec Agricola unquam per alios gesta avidus intercepit: seu centurio seu\npraefectus, incorruptum facti testem habebat. Apud quosdam acerbior in\nconviciis narrabatur; ut erat comis bonis, adversus malos injucundus:\nceterum ex iracundia nihil supererat; secretum et silentium ejus non\ntimeres: honestius putabat offendere, quam odisse.\n\nXXIII. Quarta aestas obtinendis, quae percurrerat, insumpta: ac, si\nvirtus exercituum et Romani nominis gloria pateretur, inventus in ipsa\nBritannia terminus. Nam Clota et Bodotria, diversi maris aestibus per\nimmensum revectae, angusto terrarum spatio dirimuntur: quod tum\npraesidiis firmabatur: atque omnis propior sinus tenebatur, summotis\nvelut in aliam insulam hostibus.\n\nXXIV. Quinto expeditionum anno, nave prima transgressus, ignotas ad id\ntempus gentes crebris simul ac prosperis proeliis domuit: eamque partem\nBritanniae, quae Hiberniam aspicit, copiis instruxit in spem magis quam\nob formidinem; si quidem Hibernia, medio inter Britanniam atque Hispaniam\nsita et Gallico quoque mari opportuna, valentissimam imperii partem\nmagnis invicem usibus miscuerit. Spatium ejus, si Britanniae comparetur,\nangustius, nostri maris insulas superat. Solum coelumque et ingenia\ncultusque hominum haud multum a Britannia differunt: in melius aditus\nportusque per commercia et negotiatores cogniti. Agricola expulsum\nseditione domestica unum ex regulis gentis exceperat ac specie amicitiae\nin occasionem retinebat. Saepe ex eo audivi, legione una et modicis\nauxiliis debellari obtinerique Hiberniam posse. Idque etiam adversus\nBritanniam profuturum, si Romana ubique arma, et velut e conspectu\nlibertas tolleretur.\n\nXXV. Ceterum aestate, qua sextum officii annum inchoabat, amplexus\ncivitates trans Bodotriam sitas, quia motus universarum ultra gentium et\ninfesta hostilis exercitus itinera timebantur, portus classe exploravit:\nquae, ab Agricola primum assumpta in partem virium, sequebatur egregia\nspecie, cum simul terra, simul mari bellum impelleretur, ac saepe iisdem\ncastris pedes equesque et nauticus miles, mixti copiis et laetitia, sua\nquisque facta, suos casus attollerent: ac modo silvarum ac montium\nprofunda, modo tempestatum ac fluctuum adversa, hinc terra et hostis,\nhinc victus Oceanus militari jactantia compararentur. Britannos quoque,\nut ex captivis audiebatur, visa classis obstupefaciebat, tanquam, aperto\nmaris sui secreto, ultimum victis perfugium clauderetur. Ad manus et arma\nconversi Caledoniam incolentes populi, paratu magno, majore fama, uti mos\nest de ignotis, oppugnasse ultro, castella adorti, metum, ut provocantes,\naddiderant: regrediendumque citra Bodotriam, et excedendum potius, quam\npellerentur, specie prudentium ignavi admonebant: cum interim cognoscit\nhostes pluribus agminibus irrupturos. Ac, ne superante numero et peritia\nlocorum circumiretur, diviso et ipse in tres partes exercitu incessit.\n\nXXVI. Quod ubi cognitum hosti, mutato repente consilio, universi nonam\nlegionem, ut maxime invalidam, nocte aggressi, inter somnum ac\ntrepidationem caesis vigilibus, irrupere. Jamque in ipsis castris\npugnabant, cum Agricola, iter hostium ab exploratoribus edoctus et\nvestigiis insecutus, velocissimos equitum peditumque assultare tergis\npugnantium jubet, mox ab universis adjici clamorem; et propinqua luce\nfulsere signa: ita ancipiti malo territi Britanni: et Romanis redit\nanimus, ac, securi pro salute, de gloria certabant. Ultro quin etiam\nerupere: et fuit atrox in ipsia portarum angustiis proelium, donec pulsi\nhostes; utroque exercitu certante, his, ut tulisse opem, illis, ne\neguisse auxilio viderentur. Quod nisi paludes et silvae fugientes\ntexissent, debellatum illa victoria foret.\n\nXXVII. Cujus conscientia ac fama ferox exercitus nihil virtuti suae\ninvium: penetrandam Caledoniam, inveniendumque tandem Britanniae terminum\ncontinuo proeliorum cursu, fremebant: atque illi modo cauti ac sapientes,\nprompti post eventum ac magniloqui erant. Iniquissima haec bellorum\nconditio est: prospera omnes sibi vindicant, adversa uni imputantur. At\nBritanni non virtute, sed occasione et arte ducis rati, nihil ex\narrogantia remittere, quo minus juventutem armarent, conjuges ac liberos\nin loca tuta transferrent, coetibus ac sacrificiis conspirationem\ncivitatum sancirent: atque ita irritatis utrimque animis discessum.\n\nXXVIII. Eadem aestate cohors Usipiorum, per Germanias conscripta, in\nBritanniam transmissa, magnum ac memorabile facinus ausa est. Occiso\ncenturione ac militibus, qui ad tradendam disciplinam immixti manipulis\nexemplum et rectores habebantur, tres liburnicas, adactis per vim\ngubernatoribus, ascendere: et uno remigante, suspectis duobus eoque\ninterfectis, nondum vulgato rumore ut miraculum praevehebantur: mox hac\natque illa rapti, et cum plerisque Britannorum, sua defensantium, proelio\ncongressi, ac saepe victores, aliquando pulsi, eo ad extremum inopiae\nvenere, ut infirmissimos suorum, mox sorte ductos, vescerentur. Atque\ncircumvecti Britanniam, amissis per inscitiam regendi navibus, pro\npraedonibus habiti, primum a Suevis, mox a Frisiis intercepti sunt: ac\nfuere, quos per commercia venumdatos et in nostram usque ripam mutatione\nementium adductos, indicium tanti casus illustravit.\n\nXXIX. Initio aestatis Agricola, domestico vulnere ictus, anno ante natum\nfilum amisit. Quem casum neque, ut plerique fortium virorum, ambitiose,\nneque per lamenta rursus ac moerorem muliebriter tulit: et in luctu\nbellum inter remedia erat. Igitur praemissa classe, quae pluribus locis\npraedata, magnum et incertum terrorem faceret, expedito exercitu, cui ex\nBritannis fortissimos et longa pace exploratos addiderat, ad montem\nGrampium pervenit, quem jam hostis insederat. Nam Britanni, nihil fracti\npugnae prioris eventu, et ultionem aut servitium exspectantes, tandemque\ndocti commune periculum concordia propulsandum, legationibus et\nfoederibus omnium civitatum vires exciverant. Jamque super triginta\nmillia armatorum aspiciebantur, et adhuc affluebat omnis juventus et\nquibus cruda ac viridis senectus, clari bello et sua quisque decora\ngestantes: cum inter plures duces virtute et genere praestans, nomine\nCalgacus, apud contractam multitudinem proelium poscentem, in hunc modum\nlocutus fertur:\n\nXXX. \"Quotiens causas belli et necessitatem nostram intueor, magnus mihi\nanimus est hodiernum diem consensumque vestrum initium libertatis totius\nBritanniae fore. Nam et universi servitutis expertes, et nullae ultra\nterrae, ac ne mare quidem securum, imminente nobis classe Romana: ita\nproelium atque arma, quae fortibus honesta, eadem etiam ignavis tutissima\nsunt. Priores pugnae, quibus adversus Romanos varia fortuna certatum est,\nspem ac subsidium in nostris manibus habebant: quia nobilissimi totius\nBritanniae eoque in ipsis penetralibus siti, nec servientium littora\naspicientes, oculos quoque a contactu dominationis inviolatos habebamus.\nNos terrarum ac libertatis extremos, recessus ipse ac sinus famae in\nhunc diem defendit: nunc terminus Britanniae patet; atque omne ignotum\npro magnifico est. Sed nulla jam ultra gens, nihil nisi fluctus et saxa,\net infestiores Romani: quorum superbiam frustra per obsequium et\nmodestiam effugeris. Raptores orbis, postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere\nterrae, et mare scrutantur: si locuples hostis est, avari; si pauper,\nambitiosi: quos non Oriens, non Occidens, satiaverit. Soli omnium opes\natque inopiam pari affectu concupiscunt. Auferre, trucidare, rapere,\nfalsis nominibus imperium; atque, ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem\nappellant.\"\n\nXXXI. \"Liberos cuique ac propinquos suos natura carissimos esse voluit;\nhi per delectus, alibi servituri, auferuntur conjuges sororesque, etsi\nhostilem libidinem effugiant, nomine amicorum atque hospitum polluuntur.\nBona fortunasque in tributum egerunt, annos in frumentum: corpora ipsa ac\nmanus silvis ac paludibus emuniendis inter verbera ac contumelias\nconterunt. Nata servituti mancipia semel veneunt, atque ultro a dominis\naluntur: Britannia servitutem suam quotidie emit, quotidie pascit. Ac,\nsicut in familia recentissimus quisque servorum et conservis ludibrio\nest, sic in hoc orbis terrarum vetere famulatu novi nos et viles in\nexcidium petimur. Neque enim arva nobis aut metalla aut portus sunt,\nquibus exercendis reservemur. Virtus porro ac ferocia subjectorum ingrata\nimperantibus: et longinquitas ac secretum ipsum quo tutius, eo\nsuspectius. Ita, sublata spe veniae, tandem sumite animum, tam quibus\nsalus, quam quibus gloria carissima est. Trinobantes, femina duce,\nexurere coloniam, expugnare castra, ac, nisi felicitas in socordiam\nvertisset, exuere jugum potuere: nos integri et indomiti et libertatem\nnon in poenitentiam laturi, primo statim congressu nonne ostendamus, quos\nsibi Caledonia viros seposuerit? An eandem Romanis in bello virtutem,\nquam in pace lasciviam adesse creditis?\"\n\nXXXII. \"Nostris illi dissensionibus ac discordiis clari, vitia hostium in\ngloriam exercitus sui vertunt: quem contractum ex diversissimis gentibus,\nut secundae res tenent, ita adversae dissolvent: nisi si Gallos et\nGermanos et (pudet dictu) Britannorum plerosque, licet dominationi\nalienae sanguinem commodent, diutius tamen hostes quam servos, fide et\naffectu teneri putatis: metus et terror est, infirma vincula caritatis\nquae ubi removeris, qui timere desierint, odisse incipient. Omnia\nvictoriae incitamenta pro nobis sunt: nullae Romanos conjuges accendunt;\nnulli parentes fugam exprobraturi sunt; aut nulla plerisque patria, aut\nalia est. Paucos numero, trepidos ignorantia, coelum ipsum ac mare et\nsilvas, ignota omnia circumspectantes, clausos quodammodo ac vinctos dii\nnobis tradiderunt. Ne terreat vanus aspectus et auri fulgor atque\nargenti, quod neque tegit neque vulnerat. In ipsa hostium acie inveniemus\nnostras manus: agnoscent Britanni suam causam: recordabuntur Galli\npriorem libertatem: deserent illos ceteri Germani, tanquam nuper Usipii\nreliquerunt. Nec quidquam ultra formidinis: vacua castella, senum\ncoloniae, inter male parentes et injuste imperantes aegra municipia et\ndiscordantia: hic dux, hic exercitus: ibi tributa et metalla et ceterae\nservientium poenae: quas in aeternum perferre aut statim ulcisci in hoc\ncampo est. Proinde ituri in aciem et majores vestros et posteros\ncogitate.\"\n\nXXXIII. Excepere orationem alacres, ut barbaris moris, cantu et fremitu\nclamoribusque dissonis. Jam que agmina, et armorum fulgores audentissimi\ncujusque procursu: simul instruebantur acies: cum Agricola, quanquam\nlaetum et vix munimentis coercitum militem adhortatus, ita disseruit:\n\"Octavus annus est, commilitones, ex quo virtute et auspiciis imperii\nRomani fide atque opera vestra Britanniam vicistis: tot expeditionibus,\ntot proeliis, seu fortitudine adversus hostes seu patientia ac labore\npaene adversus ipsam rerum naturam opus fuit, neque me militum neque vos\nducis poenituit. Ergo egressi, ego veterum legatorum, vos priorum\nexercituum terminos, finem Britanniae non fama nec rumore, sed castris et\narmis tenemus. Inventa Britannia et subacta. Equidem saepe in agmine, cum\nvos paludes montesve et flumina fatigarent, fortissimi cujusque voces\naudiebam, Quando dabitur hostis, quando acies? Veniunt, e latebris suis\nextrusi: et vota virtusque in aperto, omniaque prona victoribus, atque\neadem victis adversa. Nam, ut superasse tantum itineris, silvas evasisse,\ntransisse aestuaria pulchrum ac decorum in frontem; ita fugientibus\npericulosissima, quae hodie prosperrima sunt. Neque enim nobis aut\nlocorum eadem notitia aut commeatuum eadem abundantia: sed manus et arma\net in his omnia. Quod ad me attinet, jam pridem mihi decretum est, neque\nexercitus neque ducis terga tuta esse. Proinde et honesta mors turpi vita\npotior; et incolumitas ac decus eodem loco sita sunt: nec inglorium\nfuerit, in ipso terrarum ac naturae fine cecidisse.\"\n\nXXXIV. \"Si novae gentes atque ignota acies constitisset, aliorum\nexercituum exemplis vos hortarer: nunc vestra decora recensete, vestros\noculos interrogate. Ii sunt, quos proximo anno, unam legionem furto\nnoctis aggressos, clamore debellastis: ii ceterorum Britannorum\nfugacissimi, ideoque tam diu superstites. Quomodo silvas saltusque\npenetrantibus fortissimum quodque animal contra ruere, pavida et inertia\nipso agminis sono pelluntur, sic acerrimi Britannorum jam pridem\nceciderunt: reliquus est numerus ignavorum et metuentium, quos quod\ntandem invenistis, non restiterunt, sed deprehensi sunt: novissimae res\net extremo metu corpora defixere aciem in his vestigiis, in quibus\npulchram et spectabilem victoriam ederetis. Transigite cum\nexpeditionibus: imponite quinquaginta annis magnum diem: approbate\nreipublicae nunquam exercitui imputari potuisse aut moras belli aut\ncausas rebellandi.\"\n\nXXXV. Et alloquente adhuc Agricola, militum ardor eminebat, et finem\norationis ingens alacritas consecuta est, statimque ad arma discursum.\nInstinctos ruentesque ita disposuit, ut peditum auxilia, quae octo\nmillia erant, mediam aciem firmarent, equitum tria millia cornibus\naffunderentur: legiones pro vallo stetere, ingens victoriae decus citra\nRomanum sanguinem bellanti, et auxilium, si pellerentur. Britannorum\nacies, in speciem simul ac terrorem, editioribus locis constiterat\nita, ut primum agmen aequo, ceteri per acclive jugum connexi velut\ninsurgerent: media campi covinarius et eques strepitu ac discursu\ncomplebat. Tum Agricola superante hostium multitudine veritus, ne simul\nin frontem, simul et latera suorum pugnaretur, diductis ordinibus,\nquanquam porrectior acies futura erat et arcessendas plerique legiones\nadmonebant, promptior in spem et firmus adversis, dimisso equo pedes\nante vexilla constitit.\n\nXXXVI. Ac primo congressu eminus certabatur simul constantia, simul arte\nBritanni ingentibus gladiis et brevibus cetris missilia nostrorum vitare\nvel excutere, atque ipsi magnam vim telorum superfundere: donec Agricola\nBatavorum cohortes ac Tungrorum duas cohortatus est, ut rem ad mucrones\nac manus adducerent: quod et ipsis vetustate militiae exercitatum, et\nhostibus inhabile parva scuta et enormes gladios gerentibus: nam\nBritannorum gladii sine mucrone complexum armorum et in aperto pugnam non\ntolerabant. Igitur, ut Batavi miscere ictus, ferire umbonibus, ora\nfoedare, et stratis qui in aequo obstiterant, erigere in colles aciem\ncoepere, ceterae cohortes, aemulatione et impetu commistae, proximos\nquosque caedere; ac plerique semineces aut integri festinatione victoriae\nrelinquebantur. Interim equitum turmae fugere, covinarii peditum se\nproelio miscuere: et, quanquam recentem terrorem intulerant, densis tamen\nhostium agminibus et inaequalibus locis haerebant: minimeque equestris ea\npugnae facies erat, cum aegre diu stantes simul equorum corporibus\nimpellerentur, ac saepe vagi currus, exterriti sine rectoribus equi, ut\nquemque formido tulerat, transversos aut obvios incursabant.\n\nXXXVII. Et Britanni, qui adhuc pugnae expertes summa collium insederant\net paucitatem nostrorum vacui spernebant, degredi paulatim et circumire\nterga vincentium coeperant: ni id ipsum veritus Agricola, quatuor equitum\nalas, ad subita belli retentas, venientibus opposuisset, quantoque\nferocius accurrerant, tanto acrius pulsos in fugam disjecisset. Ita\nconsilium Britannorum in ipsos versum: transvectaeque praecepto ducis a\nfronte pugnantium alae, aversam hostium aciem invasere. Tum vero\npatentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum: sequi, vulnerare, capere\natque eosdem, oblatis aliis, trucidare. Jam hostium, prout cuique\ningenium erat, catervae armatorum paucioribus terga praestare, quidam\ninermes ultro ruere ac se morti offerre; passim arma et corpora et laceri\nartus et cruenta humus: et aliquando etiam victis ira virtusque; postquam\nsilvis appropinquarunt, collecti primos sequentium incautos et locorum\nignaros circumveniebant. Quod ni frequens ubique Agricola validas et\nexpeditas cohortes indaginis modo, et, sicubi arctiora erant, partem\nequitum dimissis equis, simul rariores silvas equitem persultare\njussisset, acceptum aliquod vulnus per nimiam fiduciam foret. Ceterum,\nubi compositos firmis ordinibus sequi rursus videre, in fugam versi, non\nagminibus, ut prius, nec alius alium respectantes, rari et vitabundi\ninvicem, longinqua atque avia petiere. Finis sequendi nox et satietas\nfuit: caesa hostium ad decem millia: nostrorum trecenti sexaginta\ncecidere: in quis Aulus Atticus praefectus cohortis, juvenili ardore et\nferocia equi hostibus illatus.\n\nXXXVIII. Et nox quidem gaudio praedaque laeta victoribus: Britanni\npalantes, mixtoque virorum mulierumque ploratu, trahere vulneratos,\nvocare integros, deserere domos ac per iram ultro incendere: eligere\nlatebras et statim relinquere: miscere invicem consilia aliqua, dein\nseparare: aliquando frangi aspectu pignorum suorum, saepius concitari:\nsatisque constabat, saevisse quosdam in conjuges ac liberos, tanquam\nmisererentur. Proximus dies faciem victoriae latius aperuit: vastum\nubique silentium, secreti colles, fumantia procul tecta, nemo\nexploratoribus obvius: quibus in omnem partem dimissis, ubi incerta fugae\nvestigia neque usquam conglobari hostes compertum et exacta jam aestate\nspargi bellum nequibat, in fines Horestorum exercitum deducit. Ibi\nacceptis obsidibus, praefecto classis circumvehi Britanniam praecepit.\nDatae ad id vires, et praecesserat terror. Ipse peditem atque equites\nlento itinere, quo novarum gentium animi ipsa transitus mora terrerentur,\nin hibernis locavit. Et simul classis secunda tempestate ac fama\nTrutulensem portum tenuit, unde proximo latere Britanniae lecto omni\nredierat.\n\nXXXIX. Hunc rerum cursum, quanquam nulla verborum jactantia epistolis\nAgricolae actum, ut Domitiano moris erat, fronte laetus, pectore anxius\nexcepit. Inerat conscientia derisui fuisse nuper falsum e Germania\ntriumphum, emptis per commercia, quorum habitus et crines in captivorum\nspeciem formarentur: at nunc veram magnamque victoriam, tot millibus\nhostium caesis, ingenti fama celebrari. Id sibi maxime formidolosum,\nprivati hominis nomen supra principis attolli: frustra studia fori et\ncivilium artium decus in silentium acta, si militarem gloriam alius\noccuparet: et cetera utcumque facilius dissimulari: ducis boni\nimperatoriam virtutem esse. Talibus curis exercitus, quodque saevae\ncogitationis indicium erat, secreto suo satiatus, optimum in praesentia\nstatuit reponere odium, donec impetus famae et favor exercitus\nlanguesceret: nam etiam tum Agricola Britanniam obtinebat.\n\nXL. Igitur triumphalia ornamenta et illustris statuae honorem et quidquid\npro triumpho datur, multo verborum honore cumulata, decerni in senatu\njubet; addique insuper opinionem, Syriam provinciam Agricolae destinari,\nvacuam tum morte Atilii Rufi consularis et majoribus reservatam.\nCredidere plerique libertum ex secretioribus ministeriis missum ad\nAgricolam codicillos, quibus ei Syria dabatur, tulisse cum praecepto, ut,\nsi in Britannia foret, traderentur: eumque libertum in ipso freto Oceani\nobvium Agricolae, ne appellato quidem eo, ad Domitianum remeasse: sive\nverum istud, sive ex ingenio principis fictum ac compositum est.\nTradiderat interim Agricola successori suo provinciam quietam tutamque.\nAc, ne notabilis celebritate et frequentia occurrentium introitus esset,\nvitato amicorum officio, noctu in urbem, noctu in palatium, ita ut\npraeceptum erat, venit: exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone turbae\nservientium immixtus est. Ceterum, ut militare nomen, grave inter\notiosos, aliis virtutibus temperaret, tranquillitatem atque otium penitus\nauxit, cultu modicus, sermone facilis, uno aut altero amicorum comitatus;\nadeo ut plerique quibus magnos viros per ambitionem aestimare mos est,\nviso aspectoque Agricola, quaererent famam, pauci interpretarentur.\n\nXLI. Crebro per eos dies apud Domitianum absens accusatus, absens\nabsolutus est. Causa periculi non crimen ullum aut querela laesi\ncujusquam, sed infensus virtutibus princeps et gloria viri ac pessimum\ninimicorum genus, laudantes. Et ea insecuta sunt reipublicae tempora,\nquae sileri Agricolam non sinerent: tot exercitus in Moesia Daciaque et\nGermania Pannoniaque, temeritate aut per ignaviam ducum amissi: tot\nmilitares viri cum tot cohortibus expugnati et capti: nec jam de limite\nimperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legionum et possessione dubitatum. Ita,\ncum damna damnis continuarentur atque omnis annus funeribus et cladibus\ninsigniretur, poscebatur ore vulgi dux Agricola: comparantibus cunctis\nvigorem, constantiam et expertum bellis animum cum inertia et formidine\nceterorum. Quibus sermonibus satis constat Domitiani quoque aures\nverberatas, dum optimus quisque libertorum amore et fide, pessimi\nmalignitate et livore, pronum deterioribus principem exstimulabant. Sic\nAgricola simul suis virtutibus, simul vitiis aliorum, in ipsam gloriam\npraeceps agebatur.\n\nXLII. Aderat jam annus, quo proconsulatum Asiae et Africae sortiretur, et\nocciso Civica nuper nec Agricolae consilium deerat, nec Domitiano\nexemplum. Accessere quidam cogitationum principis periti, qui, iturusne\nesset in provinciam, ultro Agricolam interrogarent: ac primo occultius\nquietem et otium laudare, mox operam suam in approbanda excusatione\nofferre: postremo non jam obscuri, suadentes simul terrentesque,\npertraxere ad Domitianum; qui paratus simulatione, in arrogantiam\ncompositus, et audiit preces excusantis, et, cum annuisset, agi sibi\ngratias passus est: nec erubuit beneficii invidia. Salarium tamen,\nproconsulari solitum offerri et quibusdam a se ipso concessum, Agricolae\nnon dedit: sive offensus non petitum, sive ex conscientia, ne, quod\nvetuerat, videretur emisse. Proprium humani ingenii est, odisse quem\nlaeseris: Domitiani vero natura praeceps in iram, et quo obscurior, eo\nirrevocabilior, moderatione tamen prudentiaque Agricolae leniebatur: quia\nnon contumacia neque inani jactatione libertatis famam fatumque\nprovocabat. Sciant. quibus moris illicita mirari, posse etiam sub malis\nprincipibus magnos viros esse: obsequiumque ac modestiam, si industria ac\nvigor adsint, eo laudis excedere, quo plerique per abrupta, sed in nullum\nreipublicae usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt.\n\nXLIII. Finis vitae ejus nobis luctuosus, amicis tristis, extraneis etiam\nignotisque non sine cura fuit. Vulgus quoque et hic aliud agens populus\net ventitavere ad domum, et per fora et circulos locuti sunt: nec\nquisquam audita morte Agricolae aut laetatus est aut statim oblitus.\nAugebat miserationem constans rumor, veneno interceptum. Nobis nihil\ncomperti affirmare ausim: ceterum per omnem valetudinem ejus, crebrius\nquam ex more principatus per nuntios visentis, et libertorum primi et\nmedicorum intimi venere: sive cura illud sive inquisitio erat. Supremo\nquidem die, momenta deficientis per dispositos cursores nuntiata\nconstabat, nullo credente sic accelerari, quae tristis audiret. Speciem\ntamen doloris animo vultuque prae se tulit, securus jam odii, et qui\nfacilius dissimularet gaudium, quam metum. Satis constabat, lecto\ntestamento Agricolae, quo cohaeredem optimae uxori et piissimae filiae\nDomitianum scripsit, laetatum eum velut honore judicioque: tam caeca et\ncorrupta mens assiduis adulationibus erat, ut nesciret a bono patre non\nscribi haeredem, nisi malum principem.\n\nXLIV. Natus erat Agricola, Caio Caesare tertium consule, Idibus Juniis:\nexcessit sexto et quinquagesimo anno, decimo Kalendas Septembris, Collega\nPriscoque consulibus. Quod si habitum quoque ejus posteri noscere velint,\ndecentior quam sublimior fuit; nihil metus in vultu, gratia oris\nsupererat bonum virum facile crederes, magnum libenter. Et ipse quidem,\nquanquam medio in spatio integrae aetatis ereptus, quantum ad gloriam,\nlongissimum aevum peregit. Quippe et vera bona, quae in virtutibus sita\nsunt, impleverat, et consulari ac triumphalibus ornamentis praedito, quid\naliud adstruere fortuna poterat? Opibus nimiis non gaudebat; speciosae\ncontigerant. Filia atque uxore superstitibus, potest videri etiam beatus;\nincolumi dignitate, florente fama, salvis affinitatibus et amicitiis,\nfutura effugisse. Nam sicuti durare in hac beatissimi saeculi luce ac\nprincipem Trajanum videre, quod augurio votisque apud nostras aures\nominabatur, ita festinatae mortis grande solatium tulit, evasisse\npostremum illud tempus, quo Domitianus non jam per intervalla ac\nspiramenta temporum, sed continuo et velut uno ictu rempublicam exhausit.\n\nXLV. Non vidit Agricola obsessam curiam, et clausum armis senatum, et\neadem strage tot consularium caedes, tot nobilissimarum feminarum exsilia\net fugas. Una adhuc victoria Carus Metius censebatur, et intra Albanam\narcem sententia Messalini strepebat, et Massa Bebius jam tum reus erat.\nMox nostrae duxere Helvidium in carcerem manus: nos Maurici Rusticique\nvisus, nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit. Nero tamen subtraxit\noculos jussitque scelera, non spectavit: praecipua sub Domitiano\nmiseriarum pars erat videre et aspici: cum suspiria nostra\nsubscriberentur; cum denotandis tot hominum palloribus sufficeret saevus\nille vultus et rubor, quo se contra pudorem muniebat. Tu vero felix,\nAgricola, non vitae tantum claritate, sed etiam opportunitate mortis. Ut\nperhibent qui interfuerunt novissimis sermonibus tuis, constans et libens\nfatum excepisti; tanquam pro virili portione innocentiam principi\ndonares. Sed mihi filiaeque ejus, praeter acerbitatem parentis erepti,\nauget moestitiam, quod assidere valetudini, fovere deficientem, satiari\nvultu, complexu, non contigit: excepissemus certe mandata vocesque, quas\npenitus animo figeremus. Noster hic dolor, nostrum vulnus: nobis tam\nlongae absentiae conditione ante quadriennium amissus est. Omnia sine\ndubio, optime parentum, assidente amantissima uxore, superfuere honori\ntuo: paucioribus tamen lacrimis compositus es, et novissima in luce\ndesideravere aliquid oculi tui.\n\nXLVI. Si quis piorum manibus locus, si, ut sapientibus placet, non cum\ncorpore exstinguuntur magnae animae, placide quiescas, nosque, domum\ntuam, ab infirmo desiderio et muliebribus lamentis ad contemplationem\nvirtutum tuarum voces, quas neque lugeri neque plangi fas est:\nadmiratione te potius, te immortalibus laudibus, et, si natura\nsuppeditet, similitudine decoremus. Is verus honos, ea conjunctissimi\ncujusque pietas. Id filiae quoque uxorique praeceperim, sic patris, sic\nmariti memoriam venerari, ut omnia facta dictaque ejus secum revolvant,\nformamque ac figuram animi magis quam corporis complectantur: non quia\nintercedendum putem imaginibus, quae marmore aut aere finguntur; sed ut\nvultus hominum, ita simulacra vultus imbecilla ac mortalia sunt; forma\nmentis aeterna, quam tenere et exprimere non per alienam materiam et\nartem, sed tuis ipse moribus possis. Quidquid ex Agricola amavimus,\nquidquid mirati sumus, manet mansurumque est in animis hominum, in\naeternitate temporum, fama rerum.

The design of the author in its\npublication has been variously interpreted. From the censure which it\nfrequently passes upon the corruption and degeneracy of the times, it has\nbeen considered as a mere satire upon Roman manners, in the age of\nTacitus. But to say nothing of the ill adaptation of the whole plan to a\nsatirical work, there are large parts of the treatise, which must have\nbeen prepared with great labor, and yet can have no possible bearing on\nsuch a design. Satires are not wont to abound in historical notices and\ngeographical details, especially touching a foreign and distant land.\n\nThe same objection lies against the _political_ ends, which have been\nimputed to the author, such as the persuading of Trajan to engage, or\n_not_ to engage, in a war with the Germans, as the most potent and\ndangerous enemy of Rome. For both these aims have been alleged, and we\nmight content ourselves with placing the one as an offset against the\nother. But aside from the neutralizing force of such contradictions,\nwherefore such an imposing array of geographical research, of historical\nlore, of political and moral philosophy, for the accomplishment of so\nsimple a purpose? And why is the purpose so scrupulously concealed, that\nconfessedly it can be gathered only from obscure intimations, and those\nof ambiguous import? Besides, there are passages whose tendency must have\nbeen directly counter to either of these alleged aims (cf. note \u00c2\u00a7 33).\nThe author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem to appreciate\nwith almost prophetic accuracy, those dangers to the Roman Empire, which\nwere so fearfully illustrated in its subsequent fall beneath the power of\nthe German Tribes; and he utters, as what true Roman would not in such\nforebodings, the warnings and the prayers of a patriot sage. But he does\nthis only in episodes, which are so manifestly incidental, and yet arise\nso naturally out of the narrative or description, that it is truly\nsurprising it should ever have occurred to any reader, to seek in them\nthe key to the whole treatise.\n\nThe entire warp and woof of the work is obviously _historical_ and\n_geographical_. The satire, the political maxims, the moral sentiments,\nand all the rest, are merely incidental, interwoven for the sake of\ninstruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind so thoughtful and\nso acute as that of Tacitus, could not leave them out. Tacitus had long\nbeen collecting the materials for his Roman Histories. In so doing, his\nattention was necessarily drawn often and with special interest to a\npeople, who, for two centuries and more, had been the most formidable\nenemy of the Roman State. In introducing them into his history, he would\nnaturally wish to give some preliminary account of their origin, manners,\nand institutions, as he does in introducing the Jews in the Fifth Book of\nhis Histories, which happens to be, in part, preserved. Nor would it be\nstrange, if he should, with this view, collect a mass of materials, which\nhe could not incorporate entire into a work of such compass, and which\nany slight occasion might induce him to publish in a separate form,\nperhaps as a sort of forerunner to his Histories. [It has even been\nargued by highly respectable scholars, that the Germania of Tacitus is\nitself only such a collection of materials, not published by the Author,\nand never intended for publication in that form. But it is quite too\nmethodical, too studied, and too finished a work to admit of that\nsupposition (cf. Prolegom. of K.).] Such an occasion now was furnished\nin the campaigns and victories of Trajan, who, at the time of his\nelevation to the imperial power, was at the head of the Roman armies in\nGermany, where he also remained for a year or more after his accession to\nthe throne, till he had received the submission of the hostile tribes and\nwiped away the disgrace which the Germans, beyond any other nation of\nthat age, had brought upon the Roman arms. Such a people, at such a time,\ncould not fail to be an object of deep interest at Rome. This was the\ntime when Tacitus published his work on Germany; and such are believed\nto have been the motives and the circumstances, which led to the\nundertaking. His grand object was not to point a satire or to compass a\npolitical end, but as he himself informs us (\u00c2\u00a7 27), to treat of the\norigin and manners, the geography and history, of the German Tribes.\n\nThe same candor and sincerity, the same correctness and truthfulness,\nwhich characterize the Histories, mark also the work on Germany. The\nauthor certainly aimed to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, on\nthe subject of which he treats. Moreover, he had abundant means of\nknowing the truth, on all the main points, in the character and history\nof the Germans. It has even been argued from such expression as _vidimus_\n(\u00c2\u00a7 8), that Tacitus had himself been in Germany, and could, therefore,\nwrite from personal observation. Bnt the argument proceeds on a\nmisinterpretation of his language (cf. note in _loc. cit_.). And the use\nof _accepimus_ (as in \u00c2\u00a7 27), shows that he derived his information from\nothers. But the Romans had been in constant intercourse and connection,\ncivil or military, with the Germans, for two hundred years. Germany\nfurnished a wide theatre for their greatest commanders, and a fruitful\ntheme for their best authors, some of whom, as Julius Caesar (to whom\nTacitus particularly refers, 28), were themselves the chief actors in\nwhat they relate. These authors, some of whose contributions to the\nhistory of Germany are now lost (e.g. the elder Pliny, who wrote twenty\nbooks on the German wars), must have all been in the hands of Tacitus,\nand were, doubtless, consulted by him; not, however, as a servile\ncopyist, or mere compiler (for he sometimes differs from his authorities,\nfrom Caesar even, whom he declares to be the best of them), but as a\ndiscriminating and judicious inquirer. The account of German customs and\ninstitutions may, therefore, be relied on, from the intrinsic credibility\nof the author. It receives confirmation, also, from its general\naccordance with other early accounts of the Germans, and with their\nbetter known subsequent history, as well as from its strong analogy to\nthe well-known habits of our American aborigines, and other tribes in a\nlike stage of civilization (cf. note, \u00c2\u00a7 15). The geographical details are\ncomposed with all the accuracy which the ever-shifting positions and\nrelations of warring and wandering tribes rendered possible in the nature\nof the case (cf. note, \u00c2\u00a7 28). In sentiment, the treatise is surpassingly\nrich and instructive, like all the works of this prince of philosophical\nhistorians. In style, it is concise and nervous, yet quite rhetorical,\nand in parts, even poetical to a fault (see notes passim, cf. also,\nMonboddo's critique on the style of Tacitus). \"The work,\" says La\nBletterie, \"is brief without being superficial. Within the compass of a\nfew pages, it comprises more of ethics and politics, more fine\ndelineations of character, more substance and pith (_suc_), than can be\ncollected from many a ponderous volume. It is not one of those barely\nagreeable descriptions, which gradually diffuse their influence over\nthe soul, and leave it in undisturbed tranquillity. It is a picture in\nstrong light, like the subject itself, full of fire, of sentiment, of\nlightning-flashes, that go at once to the heart. We imagine ourselves\nin Germany; we become familiar with these so-called barbarians; we pardon\ntheir faults, and almost their vices, out of regard to their virtues; and\nin our moments of enthusiasm, we even wish we were Germans.\"\n\nThe following remarks of Murphy will illustrate the value of the\ntreatise, to modern Europeans and their descendants. \"It is a draught of\nsavage manners, delineated by a masterly hand; the more interesting, as\nthe part of the world which it describes was the seminary of the modern\nEuropean nations, the VAGINA GENTIUM, as historians have emphatically\ncalled it. The work is short but, as Montesquieu observes, it is the work\nof a man who abridged every thing, because he knew every thing. A\nthorough knowledge of the transactions of barbarous ages, will throw more\nlight than is generally imagined on the laws of modern times. Wherever\nthe barbarians, who issued from their northern hive, settled in new\nhabitations, they carried with them their native genius, their original\nmanners, and the first rudiments of the political system which has\nprevailed in different parts of Europe. They established monarchy and\nliberty, subordination and freedom, the prerogative of the prince and the\nrights of the subject, all united in so bold a combination, that the\nfabric, in some places, stands to this hour the wonder of mankind. The\nBritish constitution, says Montesquieu, came out of the woods of Germany.\nWhat the state of this country (Britain) was before the arrival of our\nSaxon ancestors, Tacitus has shown in the life of Agricola. If we add to\nhis account of the Germans and Britons, what has been transmitted to us,\nconcerning them, by Julius Caesar, we shall see the origin of the\nAnglo-Saxon government, the great outline of that Gothic constitution\nunder which the people enjoy their rights and liberties at this hour.\nMontesquieu, speaking of his own country, declares it impossible to form\nan adequate notion of the French monarchy, and the changes of their\ngovernment, without a previous inquiry into the manners, genius, and\nspirit of the German nations. Much of what was incorporated with the\ninstitutions of those fierce invaders, has flowed down in the stream of\ntime, and still mingles with our modern jurisprudence. The subject, it is\nconceived, is interesting to every Briton. In the manners of the Germans,\nthe reader will see our present frame of government, as it were, in its\ncradle, _gentis cunabula nostrae_! in the Germans themselves, a fierce\nand warlike people, to whom this country owes that spirit of liberty,\nwhich, through so many centuries, has preserved our excellent form of\ngovernment, and raised the glory of the British nation:\n\n         ------Genus unde Latinum,\n    Albanique patres, atque altae\n    moenia Romae.\"\n\n\nCHAP. I. _Germania_ stands first as the emphatic word, and is followed by\n_omnis_ for explanation. _Germania omnis_ here does not include Germania\nPrima and Secunda, which were Roman provinces on the left bank of the\nRhine (so called because settled by Germans). It denotes _Germany\nproper_, as a _whole_, in distinction from the provinces just mentioned\nand from the several tribes, of which Tacitus treats in the latter part\nof the work. So Caesar (B.G. 1,1) uses _Gallia omnis_, as exclusive of\nthe Roman provinces called Gaul and inclusive of the three _parts_, which\nhe proceeds to specify.\n\n_Gallis--Pannoniis_. People used for the countries. Cf. His. 5,6:\n_Phoenices. Gaul_, now France; _Rhaetia_, the country of the Grisons and\nthe Tyrol, with part of Bavaria; _Pannonia_, lower Hungary and part of\nAustria. Germany was separated from Gaul by the Rhine; from Rhaetia and\nPannonia, by the Danube.--_Rheno et Danubio_. Rhine and Rhone are\nprobably different forms of the same root (Rh-n). Danube, in like manner,\nhas the same root as Dnieper (Dn-p); perhaps also the same as Don and\nDwina (D-n). Probably each of these roots was originally a generic name\nfor river, water, stream. So there are several _Avons_ in England and\nScotland. Cf. Latham's Germania sub voc.\n\n_Sarmatis Dacisque_. The Slavonic Tribes were called Sarmatians by the\nancients. _Sarmatia_ included the country north of the Carpathian\nMountains, between the Vistula and the Don in Europe, together with the\nadjacent part of Asia, without any definite limits towards the north,\nwhich was terra incognita to the ancients--in short, Sarmatia was\n_Russia_, as far as known at that time. _Dacia_ lay between the\nCarpathian mountains on the north, and the Danube on the south, including\nUpper Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia.\n\n_Mutuo metu_. Rather a poetical boundary! Observe also the alliteration.\nAt the same time, the words are not a bad description of those wide and\nsolitary wastes, which, as Caesar informs us (B.G. 6, 23), the Germans\ndelighted to interpose between themselves and other nations, so that it\nmight appear that _no one dared to dwell near them.--Montibus_. The\nCarpathian.--_Cetera_. Ceteram Germaniae partem.\n\n_Sinus_. This word denotes any thing with a curved outline (cf. 29, also\nA. 23); hence bays, peninsulas, and prominent bends or borders, whether\nof land or water. Here _peninsulas_ (particularly that of Jutland, now\nDenmark), for it is to the author's purpose here to speak of land rather\nthan water, and the ocean is more properly said to _embrace peninsulas_,\nthan _gulfs_ and _bays_. Its association with _islands_ here favors the\nsame interpretation. So Passow, Or., Rit. Others, with less propriety,\nrefer it to the _gulfs_ and _bays_, which so mark the Baltic and the\nGerman Oceans.--_Oceanus_ here, includes both the Baltic Sea, and the\nGerman Ocean (Oceanus Septentrionalis).\n\n_Insularum--spatia. Islands of vast extent_, viz. Funen, Zealand, &c.\nScandinavia also (now Sweden and Norway) was regarded by the ancients as\nan island, cf. Plin. Nat. His. iv. 27: quarum (insularum) clarissima\nScandinavia est, incompertae magnitudinis.\n\n_Nuper--regibus_. Understand with this clause _ut compertum est_. The\nabove mentioned features of the Northern Ocean had been _discovered_\nin the prosecution of the late wars, of the Romans, among the tribes\nand kings previously unknown. _Nuper_ is to be taken in a general\nsense==recentioribus temporibus, cf. _nuper additum_, \u00c2\u00a7 2, where it goes\nback one hundred and fifty years to the age of Julius Caesar.--_Bellum_.\nWar in general, no particular war.--_Versus_. This word has been\nconsidered by some as an adverb, and by others as a preposition. It is\nbetter however to regard it as a participle, like _ortus_, with which it\nis connected, though without a conjunction expressed. Ritter omits _in_.\n\n_Molli et clementer edito. Of gentle slope and moderate elevation_ in\nstudied antithesis to _inaccesso ac praecipiti, lofty and steep_. In like\nmanner, _jugo, ridge, summit_, is contrasted with _vertice, peak,\nheight_, cf. Virg. Ecl. 9, 7: _molli clivo_; Ann. 17, 38: _colles\nclementer assurgentes_. The _Rhaetian_ Alps, now the mountains of the\nGrisons. _Alp_ is a Celtic word==hill. _Albion_ has the same root==_hilly\ncountry. Mons Abnoba_ (al. Arnoba) is the northern part of the\nSchwartzwald, or Black Forest.--_Erumpat_, al. erumpit. But the best MSS.\nand all the recent editions have _erumpat_: and Tacitus never uses the\npres. ind. after _donec, until_, cf. Rup. & Rit. in loc. Whenever he uses\nthe present after _donec, until_, he seems to have conceived the relation\nof the two clauses, which it connects, as that of a means to an end, or a\ncondition to a result, and hence to have used the subj. cf. chap. 20:\n_separet_; 31: _absolvat_; 35: _sinuetur_; Ann. 2, 6: _misceatur_. The\ntwo examples last cited, like this, describe the course of a river and\nboundary line. For the general rule of the modes after _donec_, see H.\n522; Z. 575. See also notes H. 1, 13. 35.--_Septimum_. According to the\ncommon understanding, the Danube had _seven_ mouths. So Strabo, Mela,\nAmmian, and Ovid; Pliny makes six. T. reconciles the two accounts. The\n_enim_ inserted after _septimum_ in most editions is not found in the\nbest mss. and is unnecessary. Or. & Rit. omit it.\n\n\n II. _Ipsos_ marks the transition from the country to the people--_the\nGermans themselves_. So A. 13: _Ipsi Britanni_.\n\n_Crediderim_. Subj. attice. A modest way of expressing his opinion, like\nour: I should say, I am inclined to think. H. 486, I. 3; Z. 527.\n\n_Adventibus et hospitiis. Immigrants and visitors. Adventibus_ certae\nsedes, _hospitiis_ preregrinationes significantur. G\u00c3\u00bcn. Both abstract for\nconcrete. D\u00c3\u00b6d. compares [Greek: epoikoi] and [Greek: metoikoi].\n\n_Terra--advehebantur_. Zeugma for _terra adveniebant_, classibus\nadvehebantur. H. 704, I. 2; Z. 775.\n\n_Nec--et_. These correlatives connect the members more closely than\net--et; as in Greek oute-te. The sentiment here advanced touching\ncolonization (as by sea, rather than by land), though true of Carthage,\nSicily, and most _Grecian_, colonies, is directly the reverse of the\ngeneral fact; and Germany itself is now known to have received its\npopulation by land emigration, from western Asia. The Germans, as we\nlearn from affinities of languages and occasional references of\nhistorians and geographers, belonged to the same great stock of the human\nfamily with the Goths and Scythians, and may be traced back to that hive\nof nations, that primitive residence of mankind, the country east and\nsouth of the Caspian Sea and in the vicinity of Mount Ararat: cf. Tur.\nHis. Ang. Sax. B. II. C. 1; also Donaldson's New Cratylus, B. I. Chap. 4.\nLatham's dogmatic skepticism will hardly shake the now established faith\non this subject. The science of ethnography was unknown to the ancients.\nTacitus had not the remotest idea, that all mankind were sprung from a\ncommon ancestry, and diffused themselves over the world from a common\ncentre, a fact asserted in the Scriptures, and daily receiving fresh\nconfirmation from literature and science. Hence he speaks of the Germans\nas _indigenas_, which he explains below by _editum terra_, sprung from\nthe earth, like the mutum et turpe pecus of Hor. Sat. 1. 3, 100. cf.\nA. 11.\n\n_Mutare quaerebant. Quaerere_ with inf. is poet. constr., found, however,\nin later prose writers, and once in Cic. (de Fin. 313: quaeris scire,\nenclosed in brackets in Tauchnitz's edition), to avoid repetition of\n_cupio_. _Cupio_ or _volo mutare_ would be regular classic prose.\n\n_Adversus_. That the author here uses _adversus_ in some unusual and\nrecondite sense, is intimated by the clause: _ut sic dixerim_. It is\nunderstood by some, of a sea _unfriendly to navigation_. But its\nconnexion by _que_ with _immensus ultra_, shows that it refers to\n_position_, and means _lying opposite_, i.e., belonging, as it were, to\nanother hemisphere or world from ours; for so the Romans regarded the\nNorthern Ocean and Britain itself, cf. A 12: ultra _nostri orbis_\nmensuram; G. 17: _exterior_ oceanus. So Cic. (Som. Scip. 6.) says:\nHomines partim obliquos, partim aversos, partim etiam _adversos_, stare\nvobis. This interpretation is confirmed by _ab orbe nostra_ in the\nantithesis. On the use of _ut sic dixerim_ for _ut sic dicam_, which is\npeculiar to the silver age, see Z. 528.\n\n_Asia_, sc. Minor. _Africa_, sc. the Roman Province of that name,\ncomprising the territory of Carthage.--_Peteret_. The question implies a\nnegative answer, cf. Z. 530. The subj. implies a protasis understood: if\nhe could, or the like. H. 502.\n\n_Sit_. Praesens, ut de re vera. G\u00c3\u00bcn. _Nisi si_ is nearly equivalent to\n_nisi forte: unless perchance_; unless if we may suppose the case. Cf.\nWr. note on Ann. 2, 63, and Hand's Tursellinus, 3, 240.\n\n_Memoriae et annalium_. Properly opposed to each other as _tradition_ and\n_written history_, though we are not to infer that written books existed\nin Germany in the age of Tacitus.\n\n_Carminibus_. _Songs, ballads_ (from cano). Songs and rude poetry have\nbeen, in all savage countries, the memorials of public transactions,\ne.g. the runes of the Goths, the bards of the Britons and Celts, the\nscalds of Scandinavia, &c.\n\n_Tuisconem_. The god from whom Tuesday takes its name, as Wednesday from\nWoden, Thursday from Thor, &c., cf. Sharon Turner's His. of Ang. Sax.\napp. to book 2. chap. 3. Some find in the name of this god the root of\nthe words Teutonic, Dutch (Germ. Deutsche or Teutsche &c.,) Al. Tuistonem,\nTristonem, &c. More likely it has the same root as the Latin divus,\ndius, deus, and the Greek theios, dios, theos, cf. Grimm's _Deutsche\nMythologie_, sub v.\n\n_Terra editum==indigena_ above; and gaegenaes and autochthon in Greek.\n\n_Originem_==auctores. It is predicate after _Mannum_.\n\n_Ut in licentia vetustatis. As in the license of antiquity_, i.e. since\nsuch license is allowed in regard to ancient times.\n\n_Ingaevones_. \"According to some German antiquaries, the _Ingaevones_ are\ndie _Einwohner_, those dwelling inwards towards the sea; the _Istaevones_\nare die _Westwohner_, the inhabitants of the western parts; and the\n_Hermiones_ are the _Herumwohner_, midland inhabitants,\" Ky. cf.\nKiessling in loc. Others, e.g. Zeuss and Grimm, with more probability,\nfind in these names the roots of German words significant of _honor_\nand _bravery_, assumed by different tribes or confederacies as epithets\nor titles of distinction. Grimm identifies these three divisions with\nthe Franks, Saxons, and Thuringians of a later age. See further, note\nchap. 27.\n\n_Vocentur_. The subj. expresses the opinion of others, not the direct\naffirmation of the author. H. 529; Z. 549.\n\n_Deo_==hoc deo, sc. Mannus--Germ. Mann, Eng. Man.\n\n_Marsos, Gambrivios_. Under the names of Franci and Salii these tribes\nafterwards became formidable to the Romans. Cf. Prichard's Researches\ninto the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. III. chap. 6, sec. 2.--\n_Suevos_, cf. note, 38.--_Vandalios_. The Vandals, now so familiar in\nhistory.\n\n_Additum_, sc. esse, depending on _affirmant_.\n\n_Nunc Tungri_, sc. vocentur, cf. His. 4, 15, 16. In confirmation of the\nhistorical accuracy of this passage, Gr. remarks, that Caes. (B.G. 2, 4)\ndoes not mention the Tungri, but names four tribes on the left bank of\nthe Rhine, who, he says, are called by the common name of _Germans_;\nwhile Pliny (Nat. His. 4, 31), a century later, gives not the names of\nthese four tribes, but calls them by the new name _Tungri_.\n\n_Ita--vocarentur_. Locus vexatissimus! exclaim all the critics. And so\nthey set themselves to amend the text by conjecture. Some have written\n_in nomen gentis_ instead of _non gentis_. Others have proposed _a\nvictorum metu_, or _a victo ob metum_, or _a victis ob metum_. But these\nemendations are wholly conjectural and unnecessary. G\u00c3\u00bcnther and Walch\nrender _a victore, from_ the victorious tribe, i.e. _after the name of_\nthat tribe. But _a se ipsis_ means _by_ themselves; and the antithesis\ndoubtless requires _a_ to be understood in the same sense in both\nclauses. Gr\u00c3\u00bcber translates and explains thus: \"In this way the name of a\nsingle tribe, and not of the whole people, has come into use, so that\nall, at first by the victor (the Tungri), in order to inspire fear, then\nby themselves (by the mouth of the whole people), when once the name\nbecame known, were called by the name of Germans. That is, the Tungri\ncalled all the kindred tribes that dwelt beyond the Rhine, Germans, in\norder to inspire fear by the wide extension of the name, since they gave\nthemselves out to be a part of so vast a people; but at length all the\ntribes began to call themselves by this name, probably because they were\npleased to see the fear which it excited.\" This is, on the whole, the\nmost satisfactory explanation of the passage, and meets the essential\nconcurrence of Wr., Or. and D\u00c3\u00b6d.--_Germani_. If of German etymology,\nthis word==gehr or wehr (Fr. guerre) and mann, _men of war_; hence the\n_metus_, which the name carried with it. If it is a Latin word\ncorresponding only in _sense_ with the original German, then==_brethren_.\nIt will be seen, that either etymology would accord with Gr\u00c3\u00bcber's\nexplanation of the whole passage--in either case, the name would\ninspire fear. The latter, however, is the more probable, cf. Ritter in\nloc. A people often bear quite different names abroad from that by which\nthey call themselves at home. Thus the people, whom we call _Germans_,\ncall themselves _Deutsche_ (Dutch), and are called by the French\n_Allemands_, cf. Latham. _Vocarentur_ is subj. because it stands in a\nsubordinate clause of the oratio obliqua, cf. H. 531; Z. 603.\n\n_Metum_. Here taken in an _active_ sense; oftener passive, but used in\nboth senses. Quintilian speaks of _metum duplicem_, quem patimur et quem\nfacimus (6, 2, 21). cf. A. 44: nihil metus in vultu, i.e., nothing to\ninspire fear in his countenance. In like manner admiratio (\u00c2\u00a7 7) is used\nfor the admiration which one excites, though it usually denotes the\nadmiration which one feels. For _ob_, cf. Ann. 1, 79: _ob moderandas\nTiberis exundationes_.\n\n_Nationis--gentis. Gens_ is often used by T. as a synonym with _natio_.\nBut in antithesis, _gens_ is the whole, of which _nationes_ or _populi_\nare the parts, e.g. G. 4: populos--gentem; \u00c2\u00a7 14: nationes--genti. In\nlike manner, in the civil constitution of Rome, a _gens_ included several\nrelated _families_.\n\n\nIII. _Herculem_. That is, Romana interpretatione, cf. \u00c2\u00a7 34. The Romans\nfound _their_ gods everywhere, and ascribed to Hercules, quidquid ubique\nmagnificum est, cf. note 34: _quicquid--consensimus_. That this is a\nRoman account of the matter is evident, from the use of _eos_, for if\nthe Germans were the subject of _memorant_, _se_ must have been used. On\nthe use of _et_ here, cf. note 11.\n\n_Primum_--ut principem, fortissimum. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Haec quoque_. _Haec_ is rendered _such_ by Ritter. But it seems rather,\nas Or. and D\u00c3\u00b6d. explain it, to imply nearness and familiarity to the mind\nof the author and his readers: _these_ well known songs. So 20: _in haec\ncorpora, quae miramur_. _Quoque_, like _quidem_, follows the emphatic\nword in a clause, H. 602, III. 1; Z. 355.\n\n_Relatu_, called _cantus trux_, H. 2, 22. A Tacitean word. Freund. Cf. H.\n1, 30.\n\n_Baritum_. Al. barditum and barritum. But the latter has no ms.\nauthority, and the former seems to have been suggested by the bards of\nthe Gauls, of whose existence among the Germans however there is no\nevidence. D\u00c3\u00b6d. says the root of the word is common to the Greek, Latin,\nand German languages, viz. _baren_, i.e. _fremere_, a verb still used by\nthe Batavians, and the noun _bar_, i.e. carmen, of frequent occurrence\nin Saxon poetry to this day.\n\n_Terrent trepidantve. They inspire terror or tremble with fear, according\nas the line_ (the troops drawn up in battle array) _has sounded_, sc. the\n_baritus_ or battle cry. Thus the Batavians perceived, that the _sonitus\naciei_ on the part of the Romans was more feeble than their own, and\npressed on, as to certain triumph. H. 4, 18. So the Highlanders augured\nvictory, if their shouts were louder than those of the enemy. See Murphy\nin loco.\n\n_Repercussu_. A post-Augustan word. The earlier Latin authors would have\nsaid _repercussa_, or _repercutiendo_. The later Latin, like the English,\nuses more abstract terms.--_Nec tam--videntur. Nor do those carmina seem\nto be so much voices_ (well modulated and harmonized), _as acclamations_\n(unanimous, but inarticulate and indistinct) _of courage_. So Pliny uses\n_concentus_ of the acclamations of the people. Panegyr. 2. It is often\napplied by the poets to the concerts of birds, as in Virg. Geor. 1, 422.\nIt is here plural, cf. Or. in loc. The reading _vocis_ is without MS.\nauthority.\n\n_Ulixem_. \"The love of fabulous history, which was the passion of ancient\ntimes, produced a new Hercules in every country, and made Ulysses wander\non every shore. Tacitus mentions it as a romantic tale; but Strabo seems\nwilling to countenance the fiction, and gravely tells us that Ulysses\nfounded a city, called Odyssey, in Spain. Lipsius observes, that Lisbon,\nin the name of Strabo, had the appellation of Ulysippo, or Olisipo. At\nthis rate, he pleasantly adds, what should hinder us inhabitants of the\nLow Countries from asserting that Ulysses built the city of Ulyssinga,\nand Circe founded that of Circzea or Ziriczee?\" Murphy.\n\n_Fabuloso errore. Storied, celebrated in song_, cf. fabulosus Hydaspes.\nHor. Od. 1, 227. Ulysses having _wandered westward_ gave plausibility to\nalleged traces of him in Gaul, Spain and Germany--_Asciburgium_. Now\nAsburg.\n\n_Quin etiam_, cf. notes, 13: _quin etiam_, and 14: _quin immo.--Ulixi_,\ni.e. ab Ulixe, cf. Ann. 15,41: Aedes statoris Jovis Romulo vota, i.e. by\nRomulus. This usage is especially frequent in the poets and the later\nprose writers, cf. H. 388, II. 3; Z. 419; and in T. above all others, cf.\nB\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac. sub _Dativus_. Wr. and Rit. understand however an altar\n(or monument) consecrated to Ulysses, i.e. erected in honor of him by the\ncitizens.\n\n_Adjecto_. Inscribed with the name of his father, as well as his own,\ni.e. [Greek: Laertiadae].\n\n_Graecis litteris. Grecian characters_, cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 29: In castris\n_Helvetiorum_, tabulae repertae sunt _litteris Graecis_ confectae; and\n(6, 14): _Galli_ in publicis privatisque rationibus _Graecis utuntur\nlitteris_. T. speaks (Ann. 11, 14) of alphabetic characters, as passing\nfrom Phenicia into Greece, and Strabo (4, 1) traces them from the Grecian\ncolony at Marseilles, into Gaul, whence they doubtless passed into\nGermany, and even into Britain.\n\n\nIV. _Aliis aliarum_. The Greek and Latin are both fond of a repetition\nof different cases of the same word, even where one of them is redundant,\ne.g. [Greek: oioden oios] (Hom. II. 7, 39), and particularly in the\nwords [Greek: allos] and _alius_. _Aliis_ is not however wholly\nredundant; but brings out more fully the idea: _no intermarriages, one\nwith one nation, and another with another_. Walch and Ritter omit\n_aliis_, though it is found in all the MSS.\n\n_Infectos_. Things are said _infici_ and _imbui_, which are so penetrated\nand permeated by something else, that that something becomes a part of\nits nature or substance, as inficere colore, sanguine, veneno, animum\nvirtutibus. It does not necessarily imply corruption or degeneracy.\n\n_Propriam--similem_. Three epithets not essentially different used for\nthe sake of emphasis==_peculiar, pure, and sui-generis. Similis_ takes\nthe gen., when it expresses, as here, an internal resemblance in\ncharacter; otherwise the dat., cf. Z. 411, H. 391, 2. 4.\n\n_Habitus_. Form and features, external appearance. The physical features\nof the Germans as described by Tacitus, though still sufficient to\ndistinguish them from the more southern European nations, have proved\nless permanent than their mental and social characteristics.\n\n_Idem omnibus_. Cf. Juv. 13, 164:\n\n    _Caerula_ quis stupuit _Germani lumina? flavam\n    Caesariem_, et madido torquentem cornua cirro?\n    Nempe quod haec illis natura est _omnibus una_.\n\n_Magna corpora_. \"Sidonius Apollinaris says, that, being in Germany and\nfinding the men so very tall, he could not address verses of six feet to\npatrons who were seven feet high:\n\n    Spernit senipedem stilum Thalia,\n    Ex quo septipedes vidit patronos.\"    Mur.\n\nSkeletons, in the ancient graves of Germany, are found to vary from 5 ft.\n10 in. to 6 ft. 10 in. and even 7 ft. Cf. Ukert, Geog. III. 1. p. 197.\nThese skeletons indicate a _strong_ and _well formed_ body.\n\n_Impetum. Temporary exertion_, as opposed to _persevering toil and\neffort, laboris atque operum_.\n\n_Eadem_. Not so much _patientia_, as _ad impetum valida_. See a like\nelliptical use of _idem_ \u00c2\u00a7 23: eadem temperantia; \u00c2\u00a7 10: iisdem nemoribus.\nAlso of totidem \u00c2\u00a7 26.\n\n_Minime--assueverunt_. \"Least of all, are they capable of sustaining\nthirst and heat; cold and hunger, they are accustomed, by their soil and\nclimate, to endure.\" Ky. The force of _minime_ is confined to the first\nclause, and the proper antithetic particle is omitted at the beginning of\nthe second. _Tolerare_ depends on _assueverunt_, and belongs to both\nclauses. _Ve_ is distributive, referring _coelo_ to _frigora_ and _solo_\nto _inediam_. So _vel_ in H. 1, 62: strenuis _vel_ ignavis spem metumque\naddere==strenuis spem, ignavis metum addere.\n\n\nV. _Humidior--ventosior. Humidior_ refers to _paludibus, ventosior_ to\n_silvis_; the mountains (which were exposed to sweeping _winds_) being\nfor the most part covered with forests, and the low grounds with marshes.\n_Ventosus_==Homeric [Greek: aenemoeis], windy, i.e. lofty. H. 3, 305:\n[Greek: Ilion aenemoessan].\n\n_Satis ferax. Satis==segetibus_ poetice. _Ferax_ is constructed with\nabl., vid. Virg. Geor. 2, 222: ferax oleo.\n\n_Impatiens_. Not to be taken in the absolute sense, cf. \u00c2\u00a7 20, 23, 26,\nwhere fruit trees and fruits are spoken of.\n\n_Improcera_ agrees with _pecora_ understood.\n\n_Armentis. Pecora_--flocks in general. _Armenta_ (from _aro_, to plough),\nlarger cattle in particular. It _may_ include horses.\n\n_Suus honor_. Their proper, i.e. usual size and beauty.\n\n_Gloria frontis_. Poetice for _cornua_. Their horns were small.\n\n_Numero_. Emphatic: _number_, rather than _quality_. Or, with Ritter,\n_gaudent_ may be taken in the sense of enjoy, possess: _they have a good\nnumber of them_. In the same sense he interprets _gaudent_ in A. 44:\n_opibus nimiis non gaudebat_.\n\n_Irati_, sc. quia _opes_ sunt _irritamenta malorum_. Ov. Met. 1, 140.--\n_Negaverint_. Subj. H. 525; Z. 552--_Affirmaverim_. cf. note, 2:\n_crediderim_.\n\n_Nullam venam_. \"Mines of gold and silver have since been discovered in\nGermany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable, but the latter valuable.\"\nKy. T. himself in his later work (the Annals), speaks of the discovery of\na silver mine in Germany. Ann. 11, 20.\n\n_Perinde. Not so much as might be expected_, or as the _Romans_, and\nother civilized nations. So Gronovius, D\u00c3\u00b6d. and most commentators. See\nRup. in loc. Others, as Or. and Rit. allow no ellipsis, and render: _not\nmuch_. See Hand's Tursellinus, vol. IV. p. 454. We sometimes use _not so\nmuch, not so very, not so bad_, &c., for _not very, not much_, and _not\nbad_. Still the form of expression strictly implies a comparison. And the\nsame is true of _haud perinde_, cf. B\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac.\n\n_Est videre. Est_ for _licet_. Graece et poetice. Not so used in the\nearlier Latin prose. See Z. 227.\n\n_Non in alia vilitate_, i.e. eadem vilitate, aeque vilia, _held in the\nsame low estimation.--Humo_. Abl. of material.\n\n_Proximi_, sc. ad ripam. Nearest to the Roman border, opposed to\n_interiores_.\n\n_Serratos_. Not elsewhere mentioned; probably coins with serrated edges,\nstill found. The word is post-Augustan.\n\n_Bigatos_. Roman coins stamped with a biga or two-horse chariot. Others\nwere stamped with a quadriga and called quadrigati. The bigati seem to\nhave circulated freely in foreign lands, cf. Ukert's Geog. of Greeks and\nRomans, III. 1: Trade of Germany, and places cited there. \"The serrati\nand bigati were old coins, of purer silver than those of tho Emperors.\"\nKy. Cf. Pliny, H. N. 33, 13.\n\n_Sequuntur_. Sequi==expetere. So used by Cic., Sal., and the best\nwriters. Compare our word _seek_.\n\n_Nulla affectione animi. Not from any partiality for the silver in\nitself_ (but for convenience).\n\n_Numerus_. Greater number and consequently less relative value of the\nsilver coins. On _quia_, cf. note, H. 1, 31.\n\n\nVI. _Ne--quidem_. _Not even_, i.e. iron is scarce as well as gold and\nsilver. The weapons found in ancient German graves are of _stone_, and\nbear a striking resemblance to those of the American Indians. Cf. Ukert,\np. 216. Ad verba, cf. note, His. 1, 16: _ne--fueris_. The emphatic word\nalways stands between _ne_ and _quidem_. H. 602, III. 2; Z. 801.--\n_Superest_. Is over and above, i.e. _abounds_. So superest ager, \u00c2\u00a7 26.\n\n_Vel_. Pro _sive_, Ciceroni inauditum. G\u00c3\u00bcn. Cf. note, 17.\n\n_Frameas_. The word is still found in Spain, as well as Germany.\n_Lancea_. is also a Spanish word, cf. Freund.\n\n_Nudi_. Cf. \u00c2\u00a7 17, 20, and 24. Also Caes., B.G. 6, 21: magna corporis\nparte nuda.\n\n_Sagulo_. Dim. of sago. A small short cloak.--_Leves_==Leviter induti.\nThe clause _nudi--leves_ is added _here_ to show, that their dress is\nfavorable to the use of missiles.\n\n_Missilia spargunt_. Dictio est Virgiliana. K.\n\n_Coloribus_. Cf. nigra scuta, \u00c2\u00a7 43. \"Hence coats of arms and the origin\nof heraldry.\" Mur.\n\n_Cultus_. Military equipments. Cultus complectitur omnia, quae studio et\narte eis, quae natura instituit, adduntur. K.\n\n_Cassis aut galea_. _Cassis_, properly of metal; _galea_ of leather (Gr.:\ngalen); though the distinction is not always observed.\n\n_Equi--conspicui_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 4, 2, 7, 65.\n\n_Sed nec variare_. _But_ (i.e. on the other hand) _they are not even_\n(for _nec_ in this sense see Ritter in loc.) _taught to vary their\ncurves_ (i.e. as the antithesis shows, to bend now towards the right and\nnow towards the left in their gyrations), _but they drive them straight\nforward or by a constant bend towards the right in so connected a circle_\n(i.e. a complete ring), _that no one is behind_ (for the obvious reason,\nthat there is neither beginning nor end to such a ring). Such is on the\nwhole the most satisfactory explanation of this difficult passage, which\nwe can give after a careful examination. A different version was given in\nthe first edition. It refers not to battle, but to equestrian exercises,\ncf. Gerlach, as cited by Or. in loc.\n\n_Aestimanti_. Greek idiom. Elliptical dative, nearly equivalent to the\nabl. abs. (nobis aestimantibus), and called by some the dat. abs. In A.\nII. the ellipsis is supplied by _credibile est_. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6tticher's Lex.\nTac. sub _Dativus_.\n\n_Eoque mixti. Eo_, causal particle==for that reason. Caesar adopted this\narrangement in the battle of Pharsalia. B.C. 3, 84. The Greeks also had\n[Greek: pezoi amippoi]. Xen. Hellen. 7, 5.\n\n_Centeni_. A hundred is a favorite number with the Germans and their\ndescendants. Witness the hundred _pagi_ of the Suevi (Caes. B.G. 4, 1),\nand of the Semnones (G. 39), the _cantons_ of Switzerland, and the\n_hundreds_ of our Saxon ancestors in England. The _centeni_ here are a\nmilitary division. In like manner, Caesar (B.G. 4, 1) speaks of a\n_thousand_ men drafted annually from each _pagus_ of the Suevi, for\nmilitary service abroad.\n\n_Idque ipsum_. Predicate nominative after a verb of calling, H. 362,\n2. 2; Z. 394. The division was called a _hundred_, and each man in it a\n_hundreder_; and such was the estimation in which this service was held,\nthat to be a hundreder, became an honorable distinction, _nomen et\nhonor_==honorificum nomen.\n\n_Cuneos_. A body of men arranged in the form of a wedge, i.e. narrow in\nfront and widening towards the rear; hence peculiarly adapted to break\nthe lines of the enemy.\n\n_Consilii quam formidinis_. Supply _magis_. The conciseness of T.\nleads him often to omit one of two correlative particles, cf. note on\n_minime_, 4.\n\n_Referunt. Carry into the rear_, and so secure them for burial.\n\n_Etiam in dubiis proeliis_. Even while the battle remains undecided. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Finierunt_. In a present or aorist sense, as often in T. So\n_prohibuerunt_, \u00c2\u00a7 10; _placuit_ and _displicuit_, 11. cf. Lex. Tac. B\u00c3\u00b6t.\n\n\nVII. _Reges_, civil rulers; _duces_, military commanders. _Ex_==\nsecundum. So _ex ingenio_, \u00c2\u00a7 3. The government was elective, yet not\nwithout some regard to hereditary distinctions. They _chose (sumunt)_\ntheir sovereign, but chose him from the royal family, or at least one of\nnoble extraction. They chose also their commander--the king, if he was\nthe bravest and ablest warrior; if not, they were at liberty to choose\nsome one else. And among the Germans, as among their descendants, the\nFranks, the authority of the commander was quite distinct from, and\nsometimes (in war) paramount to, that of the king. Here Montesquieu and\nothers find the original of the kings of the first race in the French\nmonarchy, and the _mayors of the palace_, who once had so much power in\nFrance. Cf. Sp. of Laws, B. 31, chap. 4.\n\n_Nec_ is correlative to _et. The kings on the one hand do not possess\nunlimited or unrestrained authority, and the commanders on the other, &c.\nInfinita_==sine modo; _libera_==sine vinculo. Wr. _Potestas_==rightful\npower, authority; _potentia_==power without regard to right, ability,\nforce, cf. note, 42. Ad rem, cf. Caes. B.G. 5, 27. Ambiorix tells Caesar,\nthat though he governed, yet the people made laws for him, and the\nsupreme power was shared equally between him and them.\n\n_Exemplo--imperio_. \"_Dative_ after _sunt==are to set an example, rather\nthan to give command_.\" So Gr\u00c3\u00bcber and D\u00c3\u00b6d. But Wr. and Rit. with more\nreason consider them as ablatives of means limiting a verb implied in\n_duces: commanders_ (command) _more by example, than by authority_\n(official power). See the principle well stated and illustrated in\nD\u00c3\u00b6derlein's Essay on the style of Tacitus, p. 15, in my edition of the\nHistories.\n\n_Admiratione praesunt. Gain influence, or ascendency, by means of the\nadmiration which they inspire_, cf. note on metus, \u00c2\u00a7 2.\n\n_Agant_. Subj., ut ad judicium admirantium, non mentem scriptoris\ntrahatur. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Animadvertere_==interficere. Cf. H. 1, 46. 68. _None but the priests are\nallowed to put to death, to place in irons, nor even_ (ne quidem) _to\nscourge_. Thus punishment was clothed with divine authority.\n\n_Effigies et signa. Images and standards_, i.e. images, which serve for\nstandards. Images of wild beasts are meant, cf. H. 4, 22: depromptae\nsilvis lucisve ferarum imagines.--_Turmam_, cavalry. _Cuneum_, infantry,\nbut sometimes both. _Conglobatio_ is found only in writers after the\nAugustan age and rarely in them. It occurs in Sen. Qu. Nat. 1, 15, cf.\nFreund.\n\n_Familiae_ is less comprehensive than _propinquitates. Audiri_, sc.\nsolent. Cf. A. 34 _ruere_. Wr. calls it histor. inf., and Rit. pronounces\nit a gloss.\n\n_Pignora_. Whatever is most dear, particularly mothers, wives, and\nchildren.--_Unde_, adv. of place, referring to _in proximo_.\n\n_Vulnera ferunt_, i.e. on their return from battle.\n\n_Exigere. Examine_, and compare, to see who has the most and the most\nhonorable, or perhaps to soothe and dress them.--_Cibos et hortamina_.\nObserve the singular juxtaposition of things so unlike. So 1: _metu aut\nmontibus_; A. 25: _copiis et laetitia_; 37: _nox et satietas_; 38:\n_gaudio praedaque_.\n\n\nVIII. _Constantia precum==importunate entreaties_.\n\n_Objectu pectorum. By opposing their breasts_, not to the enemy but to\ntheir retreating husbands, praying for death in preference to captivity.\n\n_Monstrata--captivitate_. _Cominus_ limits _captivitate_, pointing to\ncaptivity as just before them.--_Impatientius_. _Impatienter_ and\n_impatientia_ (the adv. and the subst.) are post-Augustan words. The adj.\n(impatiens) is found earlier. Cf. Freund.\n\n_Feminarum--nomine_, i.e. propter feminas suas. G\u00c3\u00bcn. So Cic.: tuo nomine\net reipublicae==on your account and for the sake of the republic. But it\nmeans perhaps more than that here, viz. in the person of. They dreaded\ncaptivity more for their women than for themselves. _Adeo==insomuch\nthat_.\n\n_Inesse_, sc. feminis. _They think, there is in their women something\nsacred and prophetic_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 50, where Caesar is informed by\nthe prisoners, that Ariovistus had declined an engagement because the\n_women_ had declared against coming to action before the new moon.--\n_Consilia, advice_ in general; _responsa, inspired answers_, when\nconsulted.\n\n_Vidimus_, i.e. she lived in our day--under the reign of Vespasian.--\n_Veledam_. Cf. H. 4, 61. 65.\n\n_Auriniam_. Aurinia seems to have been a common name in Germany for\nprophetess or wise woman. Perhaps==Al-runas, women knowing all things. So\n_Veleda_==wise woman. Cf. Wr. in loc.\n\n_Non adulatione_, etc. \"Not through adulation, nor as if they were\nraising mortals to the rank of goddesses.\" Ky. This is one of those\noblique censures on Roman customs in which the treatise abounds. The\nRomans in the excess of their adulation to the imperial family _made_\nordinary women goddesses, as Drusilla, sister of Caligula, the infant\ndaughter of Poppaea (Ann. 15, 23), and Poppaea herself (Dio 63, 29). The\nGermans, on the other hand, really thought some of their wise women to be\ndivine. Cf. His. 4, 62, and my note ibid. Reverence and affection for\nwoman was characteristic of the German Tribes, and from them has diffused\nitself throughout European society.\n\n\nIX. _Deorum_. T. here, as elsewhere, applies Roman names, and puts a\nRoman construction (Romana interpretatione, \u00c2\u00a7 43), upon the gods of other\nnations, cf. \u00c2\u00a7 3.\n\n_Mercurium_. So Caes. B.G. 6, 17: Deum maxime Mercurium colunt. Probably\nthe German _Woden_, whose name is preserved in our Wednesday, as that of\nMercury is in the French name of the same day, and who with a name\nslightly modified (Woden, Wuotan, Odin), was a prominent object of\nworship among all the nations of Northern Europe. _Mars_ is perhaps the\nGerman god of war (Tiw, Tiu, Tuisco) whence Tuesday, French Mardi, cf.\nTur. His. Ang. Sax. App. to B. 2. chap. 3. _Herculem_ is omitted by\nRitter on evidence (partly external and partly internal) which is\nentitled to not a little consideration. Hercules is the god of strength,\nperhaps Thor.\n\n_Certis diebus_. Statis diebus. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Humanis--hostiis_. Even _facere_ in the sense of _sacrifice_ is\nconstrued with abl. Virg. Ec. 3, 77. _Quoque_==even. For its position in\nthe sentence, cf. note, 3.\n\n_Concessis animalibus_. Such as the Romans and other civilized nations\noffer, in contradistinction to _human_ sacrifices, which the author\nregards as _in_-concessa. The attempt has been made to remove from the\nGermans the stain of human sacrifices. But it rests on incontrovertible\nevidence (cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3), and indeed\nattaches to them only in common with nearly all uncivilized nations. The\nGauls and Britons, and the Celtic nations generally, carried the practice\nto great lengths, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 15. The neighbors of the Hebrews\noffered human victims in great numbers to their gods, as we learn from\nthe Scriptures. Nay, the reproach rests also upon the Greeks and Romans\nin their early history. Pliny informs us, that men were sacrificed as\nlate as the year of Rome 657.\n\n_Isidi_. The Egyptian Isis in Germany! This shows, how far the Romans\nwent in comparing the gods of different nations. Gr. Ritter identifies\nthis goddess with the Nertha of chap. 40, the Egyptian Isis and Nertha\nbeing both equivalent to Mother Earth, the Terra or Tellus of the Romans.\n\n_Liburnae_. A light galley, so called from the Liburnians, a people of\nIllyricum, who built and navigated them. The _signum_, here likened to a\ngalley, was more probably a rude crescent, connected with the worship of\nthe moon, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 21: Germani deorum numero ducunt Solem et\n_Lunam_.\n\n_Cohibere parietibus_==aedificiis includere, K. T. elsewhere speaks of\ntemples of German divinities (e.g. 40: templum Nerthi; Ann. 1, 51:\ntemplum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove or any other sacred place was\ncalled _templum_ by the Romans (templum from [Greek: temno], cut off, set\napart).\n\n_Ex magnitudine_. _Ex_==secundum, cf. _ex nobilitate_, _ex virtute_ \u00c2\u00a7 7.\n_Ex magnitudine_ is predicate after _arbitrantur: they deem it unbecoming\nthe greatness_, etc.\n\n_Humani--speciem_. Images of the gods existed at a later day in Germany\n(S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax., App. to B. 2. cap. 3). But this does not\nprove their existence in the days of T. Even as late as A.D. 240 Gregory\nThaumaturgus expressly declares, there were no images among the Goths. No\ntraces of temple-walls or images have been discovered in connection with\nthe numerous sites of ancient altars or places of offering which have\nbeen exhumed in _Germany_, though both these are found on the _borders_,\nboth south and west, cf. Ukert, p. 236.\n\n_Lucos et nemora_. \"Lucus (a [Greek: lukae], crepusculum) sylva densior,\nobumbrans; nemus ([Greek: nemos]) sylva rarior, in quo jumenta et pecora\npascuntur.\" Bredow.\n\n_Deorumque--vident. They invoke under the name of gods that mysterious\nexistence, which they see_ (not under any human or other visible form,\nbut) _with the eye of spiritual reverence alone_. So Gr. and K. Others\nget another idea thus loosely expressed: They give to that sacred recess\nthe name of the divinity that fills the place, which is never profaned by\nthe steps of man.\n\n_Sola reverentia_, cf. _sola mente_ applied by T. to the spiritual\nreligion of the Jews, H. 5, 5. The religion of the Germans and other\nnorthern tribes was more spiritual than that of southern nations, when\nboth were Pagan. And after the introduction of Christianity, the Germans\nwere disinclined to the image-worship of the Papists.\n\n\nX. _Auspicia sortesque_. _Auspicia_ (avis-spicia) properly divination by\nobserving the flight and cry of birds; _sortes_, by drawing lots: but\nboth often used in the general sense of omens, oracles.\n\n_Ut qui maxime_, sc. _observant_. Ellipsis supplied by repeating\n_observant_==to the greatest extent, none more.\n\n_Simplex_. Sine Romana arte, cf. Cic. de Div. 2, 41, K. The Scythians had\na similar method of divining, Herod. 4, 67. Indeed, the practice of\n_divining_ by _rods_ has hardly ceased to this day, among the descendants\nof the German Tribes.\n\n_Temere_, without plan on the part of the diviner.--_Fortuito_, under the\ndirection of chance. Gr.\n\n_Si publice consuletur_. If the question to be decided is of a public\nnature. _Consuletur_, fut., because at the time of drawing lots the\ndeliberation and decision are future. Or it may refer to the consultation\nof the gods (cf. Ann. 14, 30: _consulere deos_): _if it is by the state\nthat the gods are to be consulted_. So Ritter in his last edition.\n\n_Ter singulos tollit_. A three-fold drawing for the sake of certainty.\nThus Ariovistus drew lots three times touching the death of Valerius\n(Caes. B.G. 1, 53). So also the Romans drew lots three times, Tibul. 1,\n3, 10: sortes ter sustulit. Such is the interpretation of these disputed\nwords by Gr\u00c3\u00bcber, Ritter and many others, and such is certainly their\nnatural and obvious meaning: _he takes up three times one after another_\nall the slips he has _scattered_ (_spargere_ is hardly applicable to\n_three_ only): if the signs are twice or thrice favorable, the thing is\npermitted; if twice or thrice unfavorable it is prohibited. The language\nof Caesar (in loc. cit.) is still more explicit: _ter sortibus\nconsultum_. But Or., Wr. and D\u00c3\u00b6d. understand simply the taking up of\nthree lots one each time.\n\n_Si prohibuerunt_ sc. sortes==dii. The reading _prohibuerunt_ (aL\nprohibuerint) is favored by the analogy of _si displicuit_, 11, and other\npassages. _Sin (==si--ne)_ is particularly frequent in antithesis with\n_si_, and takes the same construction after it.\n\n_Auspiciorum--exigitur. Auspiciorum_, here some other omens, than lots;\nsuch as the author proceeds to specify. _Adhuc_==ad hoc, praeterea, i.e.\nin addition to the lots. The sense is: _besides drawing lots, the\npersuasion produced by auspices is required_.\n\n_Etiam hic_. In Germany also (as well as at Rome and other well known\ncountries). _Hic_ is referred to Rome by some. But it was hardly needful\nfor T. to inform the Romans of that custom at Rome.\n\n_Proprium gentis. It is a peculiarity of the German race_. It is not,\nhowever, exclusively German. Something similar prevailed among the\nPersians, Herod. 1, 189. 7, 55. Darius Hystaspes was indebted to the\nneighing of his horse for his elevation to the throne.\n\n_Iisdem memoribus_, \u00c2\u00a7 9.--_Mortali opere_==hominum opere.--_Contacti_.\nNotio contaminandi inest, K.--_Pressi curru_. Harnessed to the sacred\nchariot. More common, pressi jugo. Poetice.\n\n_Conscios_ sc. deorum. _The priests consider themselves the servants of\nthe gods, the horses the confidants of the same_. So Tibullus speaks of\nthe _conscia_ fibra _deorum_. Tibul. 1, 8, 3.\n\n_Committunt_. Con and mitto, send together==_engage in fight_. A\ntechnical expression used of gladiators and champions.\n\n_Praejudicio. Sure prognostic_. Montesquieu finds in this custom the\norigin of the duel and of knight-errantry.\n\n\nXI. _Apud--pertractentur. Are handled_, i.e. discussed, among, i.e. _by\nthe chiefs_, sc. before being referred to the people.\n\n_Nisi_ refers not to _coeunt_, but to _certis diebus_.\n\n_Fortuitum_, casual, unforeseen; _subitum_, requiring immediate action.\n\n_Inchoatur--impletur_. Ariovistus would not _fight_ before the new moon,\nCaes. B.G. 1, 50.\n\n_Numerum--noctium_. Of which custom, we have a relic and a proof in our\nseven-_night_ and fort-_night_. So also the Gauls. Caes. B.G. 6, 18.\n\n_Constituunt_==decree, determine; _condicunt_==proclaim, appoint. The\n_con_ in both implies _concerted_ or public action. They are forensic\nterms.\n\n_Nox--videtur_. So with the Athenians, Macrob. Saturn. 1, 3.; and the\nHebrews, Gen. 1, 5.\n\n_Ex libertate_, sc. _ortum, arising from_. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Nec ut jussi. Not precisely at the appointed time_, but a day or two\nlater, if they choose.\n\n_Ut turbae placuit. Ut_==simul ac, as soon as, _when_. It is the _time of\ncommencing their session_, that depends on the will of the multitude; not\ntheir sitting _armed_, for that they always did, cf. _frameas concutiunt_\nat the close of the section; also \u00c2\u00a7 13: nihil neque publicae neque\nprivatae rei nisi armati agunt. To express this latter idea, the order of\nthe words would have been reversed thus: _armati considunt_.\n\n_Tum et coercendi_. When the session is commenced, _then (tum)_ the\npriests have the right not merely to command silence, but _also (et) to\nenforce it_. This use of _et_ for _etiam_ is very rare in Cic., but\nfrequent in Livy, T. and later writers. See note, His. 1, 23.\n\n_Imperatur. Imperare_ plus est, quam _jubere_. See the climax in Ter.\nEun. 2, 3, 98; jubeo, cogo atque impero. _Impero_ is properly military\ncommand. K.\n\n_Prout_ refers, not to the order of speaking, but to the degree of\ninfluence they have over the people. Gr.--_Aetas_. Our word _alderman_\n(elderman) is a proof, that office and honor were conferred on _age_ by\nour German ancestors. So _senator_ (senex) among the Romans.\n\n_Armis laudare_, i.e. armis concussis. \"Montesquieu is of opinion that\nin this Treatise on the manners of the Germans, an attentive reader may\ntrace the origin of the British constitution. That beautiful system, he\nsays, was formed in the forests of Germany, Sp. of Laws 11, 6. The\n_Saxon_ Witena-gemot (Parliament) was, beyond all doubt, an improved\npolitical institution, grafted on the rights exercised by the people in\ntheir own country.\" Murphy, cf. S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax. B. 8. cap. 4\n\n\nXII. _Accusare--intendere. To accuse and impeach for capital crimes_.\nMinor offences were tried before the courts described at the end of the\nsection.--_Quoque_. In addition to the legislative power spoken of in the\nprevious section, the council exercised _also_ certain judicial\nfunctions. _Discrimen capitis intendere_, lit. _to endeavor to bring one\nin danger of losing his life_.\n\n_Ignavos--infames. The sluggish, the cowardly, and the impure_; for so\n_corpore infames_ usually means, and there is no sufficient reason for\nadopting another sense here. _Infames_ foeda Veneris aversae nota. K. Gr.\nunderstands those, whose persons were disfigured by dishonorable wounds,\nor who had mutilated themselves to avoid military duty. G\u00c3\u00bcn. includes\nboth ideas: _quocunque_, non tantum _venereo_, corporis abusu contempti.\n\n_Insuper_==superne. So 16: multo _insuper_ fimo onerant.\n\n_Diversitas_ is a post-Augustan word, cf. Freund, sub v.\n\n_Illuc respicit. Has respect to this principle. Scelera==crimes;\nflagitia==vices, low and base actions. Scelus_ poena, _flagitium_\ncontemptu dignum. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Levioribus delictis_. Abl. abs.==_when lighter offences are committed_;\nor abl. of circum.==_in case of lighter offences_.\n\n_Pro modo poenarum_. Such is the reading of all the MSS. _Pro modo,\npoena_ is an ingenious _conjecture_ of Acidalius. But it is unnecessary.\nRender thus: _in case of lighter offences, the convicted persons are\nmulcted in a number of horses or cattle, in proportion to the severity of\nthe sentence adjudged to be due_.\n\n_Qui vindicatur. The injured party_, or _plaintiff_. This principle\nof pecuniary satisfaction was carried to great lengths among the\nAnglo-Saxons. See Turner, as cited, 21.\n\n_Qui reddunt_. Whose _business_ or _custom_ it is to administer justice,\netc. E. proposes _reddant_. But it is without authority and would give a\nless appropriate sense.\n\n_Centeni_. Cf. note, \u00c2\u00a7 6: centeni ex singulis pagis. \"Sunt in quibusdam\nlocis Germaniae, velut Palatinatu, Franconia, etc. Zentgericht\n(hundred-courts),\" cf. Bernegger.\n\n_Consilia et auctoritas_. Abstract for concrete==_his advisers and the\nsupporters of his dignity_.\n\n\nXIII. _Nihil nisi armati_. The _Romans_ wore arms only in time of war or\non a journey.\n\n_Moris_, sc. est. A favorite expression of T. So 21: concedere moris\n(est). And in A. 39.\n\n_Suffecturum probaverit. On examination has pronounced him competent_\n(sc. to bear arms). Subj. after _antequam_. H. 523, II.; Z. 576.\n\n_Ornant. Ornat_ would have been more common Latin, and would have made\nbetter English. But this construction is not unfrequent in T., cf. 11:\nrex vel princeps audiuntur. Nor is it without precedent in other authors.\nCf. Z. 374. Ritter reads _propinqui_. The attentive reader will discover\nhere traces of many subsequent usages of _chivalry_.\n\n_Haec toga_. This is the badge of manhood among the Germans, as the toga\nvirilis was among the Romans. The Romans assumed the toga at the age of\nseventeen. The Athenians were reckoned as [Greek: Ephaeboi] at the same\nage, Xen. Cyr, 1, 2, 8. The Germans (in their colder climate) not till\nthe 20th year. Caes. B.G. 6, 21.\n\n_Dignationem. Rank, title_. It differs from _dignitas_ in being more\nexternal. Cf. H. 1, 19: _dignatio Caesaris_; 8, 80: _dignatio viri_.\nRitter reads _dignitatem_.\n\n_Assignant. High birth or great merits of their fathers assign_ (i.e.\nmark out, not consign, or fully confer) _the title of chief even to young\nmen_.\n\n_Gradus--habet_. Observe the emphatic position of _gradus_, and the force\nof _quin etiam ipse: Gradations of rank, moreover the retinue itself\nhas_, i.e. the retainers are not only distinguished as a body in\nfollowing such a leader, _but_ there are _also distinctions_ among\n_themselves. Quin etiam_ seldom occupies the second place. T. is fond of\nanastrophe. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac.\n\n_Si--emineat. If he_ (cuique) _stands pre-eminent for the number and\nvalor of his followers. Comitatus_ is gen. _Emineat_, subj. pres. H. 504\net 509; Z. 524.\n\n_Ceteris--aspici_. These noble youth, thus designated to the rank of\nchieftains, _attach themselves_ (for a time, with some followers perhaps)\n_to the other_ chiefs, who are _older and already distinguished, nor are\nthey ashamed to be seen among their attendants_.\n\n_Quibus--cui_, sc. sit==_who shall have_, etc.\n\n_Ipsa fama. Mere reputation_ or _rumor_ without coming to arms.\n\n_Profligant_==ad finem perducunt. So Kiessling, B\u00c3\u00b6tticher and Freund.\nRitter makes it==_propellunt_, frighten away. _Profligare bella,\nproelia_, &c., is Tacitean. _Profligare hostes_, etc., is the common\nexpression.\n\n\nXIV. _Jam vero_==porro. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac. It marks a transition to a\ntopic of special importance. Cf. H. 1, 2. See D\u00c3\u00b6d, in loc.\n\n_Recessisse_. All the best Latin writers are accustomed to use the\npreterite after pudet, taedet, and other words of the like signification.\nG\u00c3\u00bcn. The cause of shame is prior to the shame.\n\n_Infame_. \"When Chonodomarus, king of the Alemanni, was taken prisoner by\nthe Romans, his military companions, to the number of two hundred, and\nthree of the king's most intimate friends, thinking it a most flagitious\ncrime to live in safety after such an event, surrendered themselves to be\nloaded with fetters. Ammian. Marcell, 16, 12, 60. There are instances of\nthe same kind in Tacitus.\" Mur. Cf. also Caes. B.G. 3, 22. 7, 40.\n\n_Defendere, to defend him_, when attacked; _tueri, to protect him_ at all\ntimes.\n\n_Praecipuum sacramentum. Their most sacred duty_, G\u00c3\u00bcn. and K.; _or the\nchief part of their oath_, Gr.--_Clarescunt--tuentur_. So Ritter after\nthe best MSS. Al. _clarescant--tueantur_, or _tueare_.\n\n_Non nisi_. In Cic. usually separated by a word or a clause. In T.\ngenerally brought together.\n\n_Exigunt. They expect.--Illum--illam_. Angl. _this--that_, cf.\n_hinc--hinc_, A. 25.--_Bellatorem equum_. Cf. Virg. G. 2, 145.\n\n_Incompti--apparatus. Entertainments, though inelegant yet liberal.\nApparatus_ is used in the same way, Suet. Vitel. 10 and 13.--_Cedunt_==\niis dantur. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Nec arare_, etc. The whole language of this sentence is poetical, e.g.\nthe use of the inf. after _persuaseris_, of _annum_ for annuam mensem,\nthe sense of _vocare_ and _mereri_, &c. _Vocare_, i.e. provocare, cf. H.\n4, 80, and Virg. Geor. 4, 76. _Mereri, earn, deserve_, i.e. by bravery.\n\n_Pigrum et iners_. Piger est natura ad laborem tardus; iners, in quo\nnihil artis et virtutis. K. Render: _a mark of stupidity and incapacity_.\n\n_Quin immo. Nay but, nay more_. These words connect the clause, though\nnot placed at the beginning, as they are by other writers. They seem to\nbe placed after _pigrum_ in order to throw it into an emphatic position.\nSo _gradus quin etiam_, 13, where see note.--_Possis_. You, i.e., any one\ncan. Z. 524. Cf. note II. 1, 10: _laudares_. So _persuaseris_ in the\npreceding sentence. The subj. gives a contingent or potential turn==_can\nprocure_, sc. if you will _would persuade_, sc. if you should try. An\nindefinite person is always addressed in the subj. in Latin, even when\nthe ind. would be used if a definite person were addressed. Z. 524.\n\nIn the chieftains and their retainers, as described in the last two\nsections, the reader cannot fail to discover the germ of the feudal\nsystem. Cf. Montesq. Sp. of Laws, 30, 3, 4; also Robertson's Chas. V.\n\n\nXV. _Non multum_. The common reading (multum without the negative) is a\nmere conjecture, and that suggested by a misapprehension of the meaning\nof T. _Non multum_ is to be taken comparatively. Though in time of peace\nthey hunt often, yet they spend _so much more time in eating, drinking,\nand sleeping_, that the former is comparatively small. Thus understood,\nthis passage of T. is not inconsistent with the declarations of Caesar,\nB.G. 6, 21: Vita Germanorum omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei\nmilitaris consistit. Caesar leaves out of account their periods of\ninaction, and speaks only of their active employments, which were war and\nthe chase. It was the special object of Tacitus, on the contrary, to give\nprominence to that striking feature of the German character which Caesar\noverlooks; and therein, as Wr. well observes, the later historian shows\nhis more exact acquaintance with the Germans. _Non multum_, as opposed to\n_plus_, is nearly equivalent to _minus_.\n\n_Venatibus, per otium_. Enallage for _venatibus, otio_, H. 704, III. This\nfigure is very frequent in T., e.g. \u00c2\u00a7 40: per obsequium, proeliis; A. 9:\nvirtute aut per artem; A. 41: temeritate aut per ignaviam, &c. Seneca,\nand indeed most Latin authors, prefer a _similar_ construction in\nantithetic clauses; T. seems rather to avoid it. In all such cases\nhowever, as the examples just cited show, _per_ with the acc. is not\nprecisely equivalent to the abl. The abl. is more active and implies\nmeans, agency; the acc. with _per_ is more passive and denotes manner or\noccasion.\n\n_Delegata, transferred_.\n\n_Familiae. Household_, properly of servants (from famel, Oscan for\nservant), as in chapp. 25 and 32: but sometimes the whole family, as here\nand in chap. 7: _familiae et propinquitates_.\n\n_Ipsi_. The men of middle life, the heads of the _familiae_.\n\n_Diversitate. Contrariety.--Ament_. Subj. H. 518, I.; Z. 577.--\n_Oderint_. Perf. in the sense of the pres. H. 297, I. 2; Z. 221.\n\n_Inertiam. Inertiam==idleness_, freedom from business and care (from _in_\nand _ars_); _quietem==tranquillity_, a life of undisturbed repose without\naction or excitement. Cf. 14: _ingrata genti quies_. In this account of\nthe habits of the Germans, one might easily fancy, he was reading a\ndescription of the manner of life among our American Indians. It may be\nremarked here, once for all, that this resemblance may be traced in very\nmany particulars, e.g. in their personal independence, in the military\nchieftains and their followers, in their extreme fondness for the\nhardships and dangers of war, in their strange inactivity, gluttony and\ndrunkenness in peace, in their deliberative assemblies and the power of\neloquence to sway their counsels, in their half elective, half hereditary\nform of government, in the spirituality of their conceptions of God, and\nsome other features of their religion (Robertson has drawn out this\ncomparison in his history of Charles V). All tribes in a rude and savage\nstate must have many similar usages and traits of character. And this\nresemblance between the well-known habits of our wandering savages and\nthose which T. ascribes to the rude tribes of Germany, may impress us\nwith confidence in the truthfulness of his narrative.\n\n_Vel armentorum vel frugum_. Partitive gen. Supply aliquid.--\n_Vel--vel==whether--or_, merely distinctive; _aut--aut==either--or_,\nadversative and exclusive. _Vel--vel_ (from _volo_) implies, that one\nmay _choose_ between the alternatives or particulars named; _aut--aut_\n(from [Greek: au, autis]), that if one is affirmed, the other is denied,\nsince both cannot be true at the same time. Cf. note, A. 17: _aut--aut.\n--Pecuniam_. An oblique censure of the Romans for purchasing peace and\nalliance with the Germans, cf. H. 4, 76. Herodian 6, 7: [Greek: touto\ngar (sc. chrusio) malista Germanoi peithontai, philargyroi te\nontes kai taen eiraenaen aei pros tous Romaious chrusiou kapaeleuontes].\nOn _et_, cf. note 11.\n\nXVI. _Populis_. Dative of the agent instead of the abl. with _a_ or _ab_.\nCf. note 3: _Ulixi_.\n\n_Ne--quidem_. These words are always separated, the word on which the\nemphasis rests being placed between them. H. 602, III. 2; Z. 801. Here\nhowever the emphasis seems to belong to the whole clause--_Inter se_, sc.\n_sedes junctas inter se_.\n\n_Colunt_==in-colunt. Both often used intransitively, or rather with an\nellipsis of the object,==_dwell_.\n\n_Discreti ac diversi. Separate and scattered_ in different directions,\ni.e. without regular streets or highways. See Or. in loc.\n\n_Ut fons--placuit_. Hence to this day, the names of German towns often\nend in bach (brook), feld (field), holz (grove), wald (wood), born\n(spring). On the permanence of names of places, see note H. 1, 53.\n\n_Connexis_, with some intervening link, such as fences, hedges, and\nouthouses; _cohaerentibus_, in immediate contact.\n\n_Remedium--inscitia. It may be as a remedy_, etc.--_or it may be through\nignorance_, etc. _Sive--sive_ expresses an alternative conditionally,\nor contingently==it may be thus, or it may be thus. Compare it with\n_vel--vel_, chap. 15, and with _aut--aut_, A 17. See also Ramshorn's\nSynonyms, 138. _Remedium_ is acc. in app. with the foregoing clause.\n_Inscitia_ is abl. of cause==per inscitiam.\n\n_Caementorum_. Properly _hewn_ stone (from caedo), but in usage any\nbuilding stone.--_Tegularum_. Tiles, any materials for the _roof_ (tego),\nwhether of brick, stone, or wood.\n\n_Citra_. Properly this side of, hence short of, or _without_, as used by\nthe _later_ Latin authors. This word is kindred to _cis_, i.e. _is_ with\nthe demonstrative prefix _ce_. Cf. Freund sub v.\n\n_Speciem_ refers more to the _eye, delectationem_ to the _mind_. Taken\nwith _citra_, they are equivalent to adjectives, connected to _informi_\nand limiting _materia_ (citra speciem==non speciosa, G\u00c3\u00bcn.). Render:\n_rude materials, neither beautiful to the eye nor attractive to the\ntaste_. _Materia_ is distinctively wood for building. Fire-wood is\n_lignum_.\n\n_Quaedam loca_. Some parts of their houses, e.g. the walls.\n\n_Terra ita pura_. Probably red earth, such as chalk or gypsum.\n\n_Imitetur. Resembles painting and colored outlines_ or figures.\n\n_Aperire_. Poetice==_excavate_. Cellars under ground were unknown to the\nRomans. See Beck. Gal., and Smith's Dict. Ant.\n\n_Ignorantur--fallunt. They are not known to exist, or else_ (though known\nto exist) _they escape discovery from the very fact that they must be\nsought_ (in order to be found). G\u00c3\u00bcn. calls attention to the multiform\nenallage in this sentence: 1. in number (_populatur, ignorantur,\nfallunt_); 2. of the active, passive, and deponent verbs; 3. in the\nchange of cases (_aperta_, acc.; _abdita_ and _defossa_, nom.).\n\n\nXVII. _Sagum_. A short, thick cloak, worn by Roman soldiers and\ncountrymen.\n\n_Fibula_==figibula, any artificial fastening; _spina_==natural.\n\n_Si desit_. Observe the difference between this clause, and _si quando\nadvenit_ in the preceding chapter. This is a mere supposition without\nregard to fact; that implies an expectation, that the case will sometimes\nhappen.\n\n_Cetera intecti. Uncovered as to the rest of the body_, cf. 6: nudi aut\nsagulo leves.\n\n_Totos dies_. Acc. of duration of time.--_Agunt_==vivunt. K.\n\n_Fluitante_. The flowing robe of the southern and eastern nations;\n_stricta_, the close dress and short clothes of the northern nations.\n\n_Artus exprimente_. Quae tam arte artus includit, ut emineant, earumque\nlineamenta et forma appareant, K. K. and Gr. understand this of coat and\nvest, as well as breeches; G\u00c3\u00bcn. of breeches only.\n\n_Proximi ripae_. Near the banks of the Rhine and the Danube, so as to\nhave commercial intercourse with the Romans. These having introduced the\ncloth and dress of the Romans, attached little importance to the manner\nof wearing their _skins_. But those in the interior, having no other\napparel, valued themselves on the nice adjustment of them.\n\n_Cultus_, artificial refinement. Cf. note, 6.\n\n_Maculis pellibusque_, for maculatis pellibus or maculis pellium, perhaps\nto avoid the concurrence of genitives.\n\n_Belluarum--gignit. Oceanus_==terrae, quas Oceanus alluit; and\n_belluae_==lutrae, mustelae, erminiae, etc., so K. But Gr. says _belluae_\ncannot mean such small creatures, and agrees with Lipsius, in\nunderstanding by it marine animals, seadogs, seals, &c. Freund connects\nit in derivation with [Greek: thaer], fera (bel==ber==ther==fer), but\ndefines it as properly an animal remarkable for size or wildness.\n_Exterior Oceanus_==Oceanus extra orbem Romanum, further explained by\n_ignotum mare_. Cf. note, 2: adversus Oceanus.\n\n_Habitus_, here==vestitus; in \u00c2\u00a7 4.==forma corporis.\n\n_Saepius, oftener_ than the _men_, who also wore linen more or less. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Purpura_. Facta e succo plantis et floribus expresso. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Nudae--lacertos_. Graece et poetice. Brachia a manu ad cubitum; lacerti\na cubito ad humeros.\n\n\nXVIII. _Quanquam_==sed tamen, i.e. notwithstanding the great freedom in\nthe dress of German women, yet the marriage relation is sacred. This use\nof _quanquam_ is not unfrequent in T., and sometimes occurs in Cic.,\noften in Pliny. See Z. 341, N.\n\n_Qui ambiuntur_. This passage is construed in two ways: _who are\nsurrounded_ (ambiuntur==circumdantur, cf. II. 5, 12.) _by many wives not\nto gratify lust, but to increase their rank and influence_ (_ob_ in the\nsense _for the sake of_, cf. ob metum, 2). Or thus: _who_ (take many\nwives) _not to gratify lust, but on account of their rank they are\nsolicited to form many matrimonial alliances_. For _ambio_ in this sense\nand with the same somewhat peculiar construction after it, see H. 4, 51:\n_tantis sociorum auxiliis ambiri_; also Virg. Aen. 7, 333: connubiis\nambire Latinum. The latter is preferable, and is adopted by Wr., K., Gr.,\n&c. The former by G\u00c3\u00bcn. and others. Ariovistus had two wives. Caes. B.G.\n1, 53.\n\n_Probant_, cf. probaverit, 13, note.--_Comatur_. Subj. denoting the\nintention of the presents _with which she is to be adorned_. H 500, 1; Z.\n567.\n\n_Frenatum_, bridled, _caparisoned==paratus_ below.\n\n_In haec munera_==[Greek: epi toutois tois dorois]. _In_==upon the basis\nof, _on condition of_. So Liv.: in has leges, in easdem leges.\n\n_Hoc--vinculum_, So, \u00c2\u00a7 13: haec apud illos toga. In both passages the\nallusion is to Roman customs (for which see Becker's Gallus, Exc. 1.\nScene 1). In Germany, _these presents_ take the place of the\n_confarreatio_ (see Fiske's Manual, p. 286. 4. ed.), and the various\nother methods of ratifying the marriage contract at Rome; _these_, of\nthe religious rites in which the parties mutually engaged on the wedding\nday (see Man., p. 287).--_Conjugales deos_. Certain gods at Rome\npresided over marriage, e.g. Jupiter, Juno, Venus, Jugatinus, Hymenaeus,\nDiana, &c.\n\n_Extra_. Cic. would have said _expertem_ or _positum extra_. But T. is\nfond of the adv. used elliptically.\n\n_Auspiciis==initiatory rites_.\n\n_Denuntiant, proclaim, denote.--Accipere_ depends on _denuntiant_ or\n_admonetur_.\n\n_Rursus, quae--referantur_. Rhenanus conjectured; rursusque--referant,\nwhich has since become the common reading. But _referantur_ is the\nreading of all the MSS., and needs no emendation; and _quae_, with as\ngood authority as _que_, makes the construction more natural and the\nsense more apposite. The passage, as Gr. well suggests, consists of two\nparts (_accipere--reddat_, and _quae--accipiant--referantur_), _each_ of\nwhich includes the _two_ ideas of _receiving_ and _handing down_ to the\nnext generation. Render thus: _she is reminded that she receives gifts,\nwhich she is to hand over pure and unsullied to her children; which her\ndaughters-in-law are to receive again_ (sc. from her sons, as she did\nfrom her husband), _which are to be transmitted by them to her\ngrand-children_.\n\n_Referantur_. In another writer, we might expect _referant_ to correspond\nin construction and subject with _accipiant_. But Tacitus is fond of\nvarying the construction. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6tticher's Lex Tac., and note, 16:\n_ignorantur_.\n\n\nXIX. _Septa_. So the MSS. for the most part. Al. _septae_. Meaning: _with\nchastity guarded_, sc. by the sacredness of marriage and the excellent\ninstitutions of the Germans.\n\n_Nullis--corruptae_. Here, as every where else in this treatise, T.\nappears as the censor of Roman manners. He has in mind those fruitful\nsources of corruption at Rome, public shows, (cf. Sen. Epist. 7: _nihil\nvero est tam damnosum bonis moribus, quam in aliquo spectaculo\ndesidere_), convivial entertainments (cf. Hor. Od. 3, 6, 27), and\nepistolary correspondence between the two sexes.\n\n_Litterarum secreta_==litteras secretas, _secret correspondence_ between\nthe sexes, for this limitation is obvious from the connexion.--\n_Praesens. Immediate_.\n\n_Maritis permissa_, sc. as a _domestic_ crime, cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 19: Viri\nin uxores, sicut in liberos, vitae necisque habent potestatem. Cf. Beck.\nGall., Exc. 1. Sc. 1.\n\n_Accisis crinibus_, as a special mark of _disgrace_, cf. 1 Cor. 11, 6. So\nin the laws of the Lombards, the punishment of adulteresses was\n_decalvari et fustigari.--Omnem vicum, the whole village_, cf. Germania\nomnis, \u00c2\u00a7 1.--_Aetate==juventa_.\n\n_Non--invenerit. She would not find, could not expect to find_. This use\nof the perf. subj., for a softened fut., occurs in negative sentences\noftener than in positive ones. Cf. Arnold's Prose Comp. 417, Note.\n\n_Saeculum_==indoles et mores saeculi, _the spirit of the age, the\nfashion_.\n\n_Adhuc_ (==ad-hoc) is generally used by Cicero, and often by Tacitus, in\nthe sense either of _still_ (to this day), or _moreover_ (in addition to\nthis). From these, it passed naturally, in Quintilian and the writers\nafter him, into the sense of _even more, still more, even_, especially in\nconnection with the comparative degree; where the authors of the Augustan\nage would have used _etiam_. See Z. 486; B\u00c3\u00b6tticher's Lex. Tac. sub. voce;\nand Hand's Tursellinus, vol. 1. I. 165. _Melius quidem adhuc==still\nbetter even_. For a verb, supply _sunt_ or _agunt_. Cf. note A. 19:\n_nihil_.\n\n_Eae civitates_. Such as the Heruli, among whom the wife was expected to\nhang herself at once at the grave of her husband, if she would not live\nin perpetual infamy. At Rome, on the contrary, divorces and marriages\nmight be multiplied to any extent, cf. Mart. 6, 7: _nubit decimo viro_;\nalso Beck, as above cited.\n\n_Semel_, like [Greek: apax], _once for all_.\n\n_Transigitur_. Properly a business phrase. The business is _done up,\nbrought to an end_. So A. 34: transigite cum expeditionibus.\n\n_Ultra_, sc. primum maritum. So the ellipsis might be supplied. _Ultra_\nhere is equivalent to _longior_ in the next clause, as T. often puts the\nadverb in place of the adjective, whether qualifying or predicate.\n\n_Ne tanquam--ament_, sc. maritum: _that they may not love_ a husband\n_merely as a husband but as_ they love _the married state_. See this and\nsimilar examples of _brachylogy_ well illustrated in D\u00c3\u00b6derlein's Essay on\nthe style of Tacitus, H. p. 14. Since but one marriage was allowed, all\ntheir love for the married state must be concentrated in one husband.\n\n_Numerum--finire_. In any way contrary to nature and by design. G\u00c3\u00bcn. _Quod\nfiebat etiam abortus procuratione_. K.\n\n_Ex agnatis. Agnati_ hoc loco dicuntur, qui _post familiam constitutam_,\nubi haeres jam est, _deinde nascuntur_. Hess. To put such to death was a\nbarbarous custom among the Romans. Cf. Ann. 3, 25; see Beck. Gall. Exc.\n2. scene 1.\n\n_Alibi_, e.g. at Rome.--_Boni mores_ vs. _bonae leges_. These words\ninvolve a sentiment of great importance, and of universal application.\nGood habits wherever they exist, and especially in a republic, are of far\ngreater value and efficacy than good laws.\n\n\nXX. _Nudi_. Cf. 6: nudi aut sagulo leves. Not literally naked, but\nslightly clad, cf. Sen. de benef. 5, 13: qui _male vestitum_ et pannosum\nvidit, _nudum_ se vidisse dicit.\n\n_Sordidi_. G\u00c3\u00bcn. understands this of personal filth. But this is\ninconsistent with the daily practice of bathing mentioned, \u00c2\u00a7 22. It\ndoubtless refers to the _dress_, as Gr. and K. understand it: _nudi ac\nsordidi==poorly and meanly clad_. So also Or.\n\n_Quae miramur_. Cf. 4: _magna corpora_. See also Caes. B.G. 1, 39, 4, 1.\nOn _haec_, see note, 3: _haec quoque_.\n\n_Ancillis ac nutricibus_. So in the Dial. de Clar. Orat., T. animadverts\nupon the custom here obliquely censured: nunc natus infans delegatur\nGraeculae alicui ancillae. In the early ages of Roman History it was not\nso, see Becker's Gall. Exc. 2. scene 1.--_Delegantur. Delegamus_, quum,\nquod _ipsi_ facere debebamus, id per _alterum_ fieri curamus. E.\n\n_Separet_. For the use of the subj. pres. after _donec_, see note, 1.\n_erumpat.--Agnoscat_==faciat ut agnoscatur. So D\u00c3\u00b6d., G\u00c3\u00bcn. and K. But it\nis better with Gr., to regard the expression as poetical, and _virtus_,\nas personified: _and valor acknowledge_ them, sc. as brave men and\ntherefore by implication free born.\n\n_Venus_==concubitus.--_Pubertas_==facultas generandi. Gr. Cf. Caes, B.G.\n6, 21: qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt maximam inter suos ferunt\nlaudem.\n\n_Virgines festinantur_==nuptiae virginum festinantur, poetice. The words\nproperare, festinare, accelerare are used in both a trans. and intrans.\nsense, cf. Hist. 2, 82: festinabantur; 3, 37: festinarentur. Among the\nRomans, boys of fourteen contracted marriage with girls of twelve. Cf.\nSmith's Dic. Ant.\n\n_Eadem, similis, pares_. The comparison is between the youth of the two\nsexes at the time of marriage; they marry at the same age, equal in\nstature and equal in strength. Marriages unequal in these respects, were\nfrequent at Rome.--_Pares--miscentur_. Plene: pares paribus, validae\nvalidis miscentur. On this kind of brachylogy, see further in D\u00c3\u00b6d. Essay\non style of T., H. p. 15. _Miscentur_ has a middle sense, as the passive\noften has, particularly in Tacitus. Cf. note 21: _obligantur_.\n\n_Referunt_. Cf. Virg. Aen. 4, 329: parvulus Aeneas, qui te tamen ore\n_referret_. See note, 39: auguriis.\n\n_Ad patrem_. _Ad_ is often equivalent to _apud_ in the best Latin\nauthors; e.g. Cic. ad Att. 10, 16: ad me fuit==apud me fuit. Rhenanus by\nconjecture wrote _apud_ patrem to correspond with apud avunculum. But\nPassow restored _ad_ with the best reason. For T. prefers _different_\nwords and constructions in antithetic clauses. Perhaps also a different\nsense is here intended from that which would have been expressed by\n_apud_. Wr. takes _ad_ in the sense, _in respect to: as in respect to a\nfather_, i.e. as they would have, if he were their father.\n\n_Exigunt_, sc. hunc nexum==sororum filios.\n\n_Tanquam_. Like Greek os to denote the views of others, not of the\nwriter. Hence followed by the subj. H. 531; Z. 571.\n\n_Et in animum_. _In_==quod attinet ad, _in respect to_. The commonly\nreceived text has _ii et animum_, which is a mere conjecture of Rhen.\nAccording to K., _teneant_ has for its subject not _sororum filii_, but\nthe same subject as _exigunt_. Render: _Since, as they suppose, both in\nrespect to the mind_ (the affections), _they hold it more strongly, and\nin respect to the family, more extensively_.\n\n_Heredes_ properly refers to property, _successores_ to rank, though the\ndistinction is not always observed.--_Liberi_ includes both sons and\ndaughters.\n\n_Patrui_, paternal uncles; _avunculi_, maternal.\n\n_Propinqui_, blood relations; _affines_, by marriage.\n\n_Orbitatis pretia_. _Pretia==proemia_. _Orbitatis==childlessness_. Those\nwho had no children, were courted at _Rome_ for the sake of their\nproperty. Vid. Sen. Consol. ad Marc. 19: in civitate nostra, plus gratiae\norbitas confert, quam eripit. So Plutarch de Amore Prolis says: the\nchildless are entertained by the rich, courted by the powerful, defended\ngratuitously by the eloquent: many, who had friends and honors in\nabundance, have been stripped of both by the birth of a single child.\n\n\nXXI. _Necesse est_. It is their duty and the law of custom. G\u00c3\u00bcn.--\n_Nec_==non tamen.--_Homicidium_. A post-Augustan word.\n\n_Armentorum ac pecorum_. For the distinction between these words, see\nnote, \u00c2\u00a7 5. The high value which they attached to their herds and flocks,\nas their _solae et gratissimae opes_, may help to explain the law or\nusage here specified. Moreover, where the individual was so much more\nprominent than the state, homicide even might be looked upon as a private\nwrong, and hence to be atoned for by a pecuniary satisfaction, cf. Tur.\nHist. Ang. Sax., App. No. 3, chap. 1.\n\n_Juxta libertatem_, i.e. _simul cum libertate_, or inter liberos homines.\nThe form of expression is characteristic of the later Latin. Cf. Hand's\nTursellinus, vol. III. p. 538. Tacitus is particularly partial to this\npreposition.\n\n_Convictibus_, refers to the entertainment of countrymen and friends,\n_hospitiis_ to that of strangers.\n\n_Pro fortuna. According to his means_. So Ann. 4, 23: fortunae inops.\n\n_Defecere_, sc. epulae. Quam exhausta sint, quae apparata erant, cf. 24:\nomnia defecerunt.\n\n_Hospes_. Properly _stranger_; and hence either _guest_ or _host_. Here\nthe latter.--_Comes. Guest_. So G\u00c3\u00bcn. and the common editions. But most\nrecent editors place a colon after _comes_, thus making it _predicate_,\nand referring it to the _host_ becoming the guide and _companion_ of his\nguest to another place of entertainment.\n\n_Non invitati_, i.e. etiam si non invitati essent. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Nec interest_, i.e. whether invited or not.\n\n_Jus hospitis. The right of the guest_ to a hospitable reception, So Cic.\nTus. Quaes., 1, 26: jus hominum.\n\n_Quantum ad_ belongs to the silver age. In the golden age they said:\n_quod attinet ad_, or simply _ad_. Gr. Cicero however has _quantum in_,\nN. D. 3, 7; and Ovid, _quantum ad_, A. A. 1, 744. Cf. Freund sub voce.\n\n_Imputant. Make charge or account of_. Nearly confined to the later\nLatin. Frequent in T. in the reckoning both of debt and credit, of praise\nand blame. Cic. said: _assignare_ alicui aliquid.\n\n_Obligantur_, i.e. obligatos esse putant. Forma passiva ad modum medii\nverbi Graeci. G\u00c3\u00bcn. Cf. note, 20: _miscentur_.\n\n_Victus--comis. The mode of life between host and guest is courteous_. For\n_victus_==manner of life, cf. Cic. Inv. 1, 25, 35.\n\n\nXXII. _E_ is not exactly equivalent here to _a_, nor does it mean simply\n_after_, but immediately on awaking _out of_ sleep.--_Lavantur_, wash\nthemselves, i.e. bathe; like Gr. louomai. So aggregantur, 13;\n_obligantur_, 21, et passim.\n\n_Calida_, sc. aqua, cf. in Greek, thermo louesthai, Aristoph. Nub. 1040.\nIn like manner Pliny uses _frigida_, Ep. 6, 16: semel iterumque\n_frigidam_ poposcit transitque. Other writers speak of the Germans as\nbathing in their rivers, doubtless in the summer; but in the winter they\nuse the warm bath, as more agreeable in that cold climate. So in Russia\nand other cold countries, cf. Mur. in loco.\n\n_Separatae--mensa_. Contra Romanorum luxuriam, ex more fere _Homerici_\naevi. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Sedes_, opposed to the triclinia, on which the Romans used to _recline_,\na practice as unknown to the rude Germans, as to the _early_ Greeks and\nHebrews. See Coler. Stud. of Gr. Poets, p. 71 (Boston, 1842).\n\n_Negotia_. Plural==_their_ various _pursuits_. So Cic. de Or. 2, 6:\n_forensia negotia. Negotium==nec-otium_, C. and G. being originally\nidentical, as they still are almost _in form.--Armati_. Cf. note, 11: _ut\nturbae placuit_.\n\n_Continuare_, etc. est diem noctemque jungere potando, sive die nocteque\nperpotationem continuare. K.\n\n_Ut_, sc. solet fieri, cf. ut in licentia, \u00c2\u00a7 2. The clause limits\n_crebrae_; it is the _frequent occurrence_ of brawls, that is customary\namong those given to wine.\n\n_Transiguntur_. See note on transigitur, \u00c2\u00a7 19.\n\n_Asciscendis_. i.e. assumendis.\n\n_Simplices_ manifestly refers to the _expression_ of thought; explained\nafterwards by _fingere_ nesciunt==_frank, ingenuous_. Cf. His. 1, 15:\n_simplicissime loquimur_; Ann. 1, 69: _simplices curas_.\n\n_Astuta--callida. Astutus_ est natura, _callidus_ multarum rerum peritia.\nRit. _Astutus_, cunning; _callidus_, worldly wise. D\u00c3\u00b6d.\n\n_Adhuc. To this day_, despite the degeneracy and dishonesty of the age.\nSo D\u00c3\u00b6d. and Or. Rit. says: quae adhuc pectore clausa erant. Others still\nmake it==_etiam, even_. Cf. note, 19.\n\n_Retractatur_. Reviewed, _reconsidered_.\n\n_Salva--ratio est. The proper relation of both times is preserved_, or the\nadvantage of both is secured, as more fully explained in the next member,\nviz. by _discussing when they are incapable of disguise, and deciding,\nwhen they are not liable to mistake_. Cf. Or. in loc., and B\u00c3\u00b6tticher,\nsub v.\n\nPassow well remarks, that almost every German usage, mentioned in this\nchapter, is in marked contrast with Roman manners and customs.\n\n\nXXIII. _Potui_==pro potu, or in potum, dat. of the end. So 46: Victui\nherba, vestitui pelles. T. and Sallust are particularly fond of this\nconstruction. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac., sub _Dativus_.\n\n_Hordeo aut frumento. Hordeo==barley; frumento_, properly fruit\n(frugimentum, fruit [Greek: kat exochaen], i.e. grain), grain of any\nkind, here _wheat_, cf. Veget. R.M. 1, 13: et milites pro frumento\nhordeum cogerentur accipere.\n\n_Similitudinem vini. Beer_, for which the Greeks and Romans had no name.\nHence Herod. (2, 77) speaks of [Greek: oinos ek kritheon pepoiaemenos],\namong the Egyptians.\n\n_Corruptus_. Cum Tacitea indignatione dictum, cf. 4: _infectos_, so G\u00c3\u00bcn.\nBut the word is often used to denote mere change, without the idea of\nbeing made worse, cf. Virg. Geor. 2, 466: Nec casia liquidi _corrumpitur_\nusus olivi. Here render _fermented_.\n\n_Ripae_, sc. of the Rhine and Danube, i.e. the Roman border, as in 22:\nproximi ripae.\n\n_Poma_. Fruits of any sort, cf. Pliny, N.H. 17, 26: arborem vidimus omni\ngenere _pomorum_ onustum, alio ramo _nucibus_, alio _baccis_, aliunde\n_vite, ficis, piris_, etc.\n\n_Recens fera. Venison_, or other game _fresh_, i.e. _recently taken_, in\ndistinction from the tainted, which better suited the luxurious taste of\nthe Romans.\n\n_Lac concretum_. Called _caseus_ by Caes. B.G. 6, 22. But the Germans,\nthough they lived so much on milk, did not understand the art of making\ncheese, see Pliny, N.H. 11, 96. \"De caseo non cogitandum, potius quod\nnostrates dicunt dickemilch\" (i.e. _curdled milk_). G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Apparatu. Luxurious preparation.--Blandimentis. Dainties_.\n\n_Haud minus facile_. Litotes for multo facilius.\n\n_Ebrietati_. Like the American Aborigines, see note, \u00c2\u00a7 15.\n\n\nXXIV. _Nudi_. See note, \u00c2\u00a7 20.\n\n_Quibus id ludicrum. For whom it is a sport_; not whose business it is to\nfurnish the amusement: that would be _quorum est_ K. and Gr.\n\n_Infestas_==porrectas contra saltantes. K.--_Decorem_. Poetic.\n\n_Quaestum_==quod quaeritur, _gain_.--_Mercedem_, stipulated pay, _wages_.\n\n_Quamvis_ limits _audacis_==_daring as it is_ (as you please).\n\n_Sobrii inter seria_. At Rome gaming was forbidden, except at the\nSaturnalia, cf. Hor. Od. 3, 24, 68: vetita legibus alea. The remarkable\ncircumstance (_quod mirere_) in Germany was, that they practised it not\nmerely as an amusement at their feasts, but when sober among (_inter_)\ntheir ordinary every-day pursuits.\n\n_Novissimo. The last_ in a series. Very frequently in this sense in T.,\nso also in Caes. Properly newest, then latest, _last_. Cf. note, His. 1,\n47. _Extremo_, involving the greatest hazard, like our _extreme: last and\nfinal_ (decisive) _throw_. This excessive love of play, extending even to\nthe sacrifice of personal liberty, is seen also among the American\nIndians, see Robertson, Hist. of America, vol. 2, pp. 202-3. It is\ncharacteristic of barbarous and savage life, cf. Mur. in loco.\n\n_De libertate ac de corpore_. Hendiadys==_personal liberty_.\n\n_Voluntariam_. An earlier Latin author would have used _ipse, ultro_, or\nthe like, limiting the subject of the verb, instead of the object. The\nLatin of the golden age prefers _concrete_ words. The later Latin\napproached nearer to the English, in using more _abstract_ terms. Cf.\nnote on _repercussu_, 3.\n\n_Juvenior. More youthful_, and therefore more vigorous; not merely\nyounger (_junior_). See D\u00c3\u00b6d. and Rit. in loc. Forcellini and Freund cite\nonly two other examples of this full form of the comparative (Plin. Ep.\n4, 8, and Apul. Met. 8, 21), in which it does not differ in meaning from\nthe common contracted form.\n\n_Ea_==talis or tanta. _Such_ or _so great_. Gr.\n\n_Pervicacia. Pervicaces_ sunt, qui in aliquo certamine _ad vincendum_\nperseverant, Schol. Hor. Epod. 17, 14.\n\n_Pudore_. Shame, _disgrace_. So also His. 3, 61; contrary to usage of\nearlier writers, who use it for sense of shame, _modesty_.\n\n\nXXV. _Ceteris_. All but those who have gambled away their own liberty, as\nin \u00c2\u00a7 24.--_In nostrum morem_, &c., with specific duties distributed\nthrough the household (the slave-household, cf. note, 15), as explained\nby the following clause. On the extreme subdivision of office among\nslaves at _Rome_, see Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. Sc. 2; and Smith's Dic. Antiq.\nunder Servus.\n\n_Descripta_==dimensa, distributa. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Familiam_. Here the entire _body of servants_, cf. note, \u00c2\u00a7 15.\n\n_Quisque_. Each _servant_ has his own house and home.\n\n_Ut colono_. Like the _tenant_ or _farmer_ among the Romans; also the\nvassal in the middle ages, and the serf in Modern Europe.\n\n_Hactenus. Thus far_, and _no farther_, i.e. if he pays his rent or tax,\nno more is required of him.\n\n_Cetera_. The _rest of the duties_ (usually performed by a _Roman\nservant_), viz. those of the _house, the wife and children_ (sc. of the\nmaster) _perform_. Gr. strangely refers _uxor et liberi_ to the wife and\nchildren of the servant. Passow also refers _domus_ to the house of the\nservant, thus making it identical with the _penates_ above, with which it\nseems rather to be contrasted. With the use of _cetera_ here, compare\nHis. 4, 56: _ceterum vulgus_==the rest, viz. the common soldiers, and see\nthe principle well illustrated in D\u00c3\u00b6derlein's Essay, His. p. 17.\n\n_Opere. Hard labor_, which would serve as a punishment. The Romans\npunished their indolent and refractory domestics, by sending them to\nlabor in the _country_, as well as by heavy chains (_vinculis_) and cruel\nflagellations (_verberare_). They had also the power of life and death\n(_occidere_). Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. Sc. 2; Smith's Dic. Ant. as above.\n\n_Non disciplina--ira_. Hendiadys==non disciplinae severitate, sed irae\nimpetu. Cf. His. 1, 51: _severitate disciplinae_.\n\n_Nisi--impune_, i.e. without the pecuniary penalty or satisfaction, which\nwas demanded when one put to death an enemy (_inimicum_). Cf. 21.\n\n_Liberti--libertini_. These words denote the same persons, but with this\ndifference in the idea: _libertus_==the freedman of some particular\nmaster, _libertinus_==one in the _condition_ of a freedman without\nreference to any master. At the time of the Decemvirate, and for some\ntime after, liberti==emancipated slaves, libertini==the descendants of\nsuch, cf. Suet. Claud. 24.\n\n_Quae regnantur. Governed by kings_. Ex poetarum more dictum, cf. Virg.\nAen. 6, 794: regnata per arva. So 43: Gothones regnantur, and 44:\nSuiones. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Ingenuos_==free born; _nobiles_==high born.\n\n_Ascendunt_, i.e. ascendere possunt.\n\n_Ceteros_. By synesis (see Gr.) for ceteras, sc. gentes.\n\n_Impares_, sc. ingenuis et nobilibus.\n\n_Libertatis argumentum_, inasmuch as they value liberty and citizenship\ntoo much to confer it on freedmen and slaves. This whole topic of\nfreedmen is an oblique censure of Roman custom in the age of the\nEmperors, whose freedmen were not unfrequently their favorites and prime\nministers.\n\n\nXXVI. _Fenus agitare. To loan money at interest_.\n\n_Et in usuras extendere. And to put out that interest again on interest_.\nThe other explanation, viz. that it means simply to put money at\ninterest, makes the last clause wholly superfluous.\n\n_Servatur. Is secured_, sc. abstinence from usury, or the non-existence\nof usury, which is the essential idea of the preceding clause.\n\n_Ideo--vetitum esset_, sc. ignoti nulla cupido! Cf. 19: boni mores, vs.\nbonae leges. G\u00c3\u00bcn. The reader cannot fail to recognize here, as usual, the\nreference to Rome, where usury was practised to an exorbitant extent. See\nFiske's Manual, \u00c2\u00a7 270, 4. and Arnold's His. of Rome, vol. 1, passim.\n\n_Universis. Whole clans_, in distinction from individual owners.\n\n_In vices. By turns_. Al vices, vice, vicis. D\u00c3\u00b6d. prefers in vicis; Rit.\nin vicos==for i.e. by villages. But whether we translate by turns or by\nvillages, it comes to the same thing. Cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 22.\n\n_Camporum, arva, ager, soli, terrae_, &c. These words differ from each\nother appropriately as follows: _Terra_ is opposed to mare et coelum,\nviz. _earth_. _Solum_ is the substratum of any thing, viz. _solid ground\nor soil_. _Campus_ is an extensive plain or level surface, whether of\nland or water, here _fields_. _Ager_ is distinctively the territory that\nsurrounds a city, viz. _the public lands_. _Arvum_ is ager _aratus_, viz.\n_plough lands_. Bredow.\n\n_Superest_. There is enough, and more, cf. \u00c2\u00a7 6, note.\n\n_Labore contendunt_. They do not strive emulously to equal the fertility\nof the soil by their own industry. Passow.\n\n_Imperatur_. Just as frumentum, commeatus, obsides, etc., _imperantur,\nare demanded or expected_. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Totidem_, sc. quot Romani, cf. idem, 4, note. Tacitus often omits one\nmember of a comparison, as he does also one of two comparative particles.\n\n_Species. Parts_. Sometimes the logical divisions of a genus; so used by\nCic. and Quin. (\u00c2\u00a7 6, 58): cum genus dividitur in species.\n\n_Intellectum_. A word of the silver age, cf. note on voluntariam, 24.\nIntellectum--habent==_are understood and named_. \"Quam distortum\ndicendi genus!\" G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Autumni--ignorantur_. Accordingly in English, spring, summer and winter\nare Saxon words, while autumn is of Latin origin (Auctumnus). See D\u00c3\u00bcbner\nin loc. Still such words as H\u00c3\u00a4rfest, Herpist, Harfst, Herbst, in other\nTeutonic dialects, apply to the autumnal season, and not, like our word\nharvest, merely to the fruits of it.\n\n\nXXVII. _Funera_, proprie de toto apparatu sepulturae. E. Funeral rites\nwere performed with great pomp and extravagance at Rome; cf. Fiske's\nMan., \u00c2\u00a7 340; see also Mur. in loco, and Beck. Gall. Exc. Sc. 12.\n\n_Ambitio_. Primarily the solicitation of office by the candidate; then\nthe parade and display that attended it; then _parade_ in general,\nespecially in a bad sense.\n\n_Certis_, i.e. rite statutis. G\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_Cumulant_. Structura est poetica, cf. Virg. Aen. 11, 50: _cumulatque_\naltaria donis. K.\n\n_Equus adjicitur_. Herodotus relates the same of the Scythians (4, 71);\nCaesar, of the Gauls (B.G. 6, 19). Indeed all rude nations bury with the\ndead those objects which are most dear to them when living, under the\nnotion that they will use and enjoy them in a future state. See\nRobertson's Amer. B. 4, &c., &c.\n\n_Sepulcrum--erigit_. Still poetical; literally: _a turf rears the comb_.\nCf. His. 5, 6: Libanum _erigit_.\n\n_Ponunt_==deponunt. So Cic. Tusc. Qu.: ad ponendum dolorem Cf. A. 20:\nposuere iram.\n\n_Feminis--meminisse_. Cf. Sen. Ep.: Vir prudens meminisse perseveret,\nlugere desinat.\n\n_Accepimus_. Ut ab aliis tradita audivimus, non ipsi cognovimus. K. See\nPreliminary Remarks, p. 79.\n\n_In commune_. Cic. would have said, universe, or de universa origine. Gr.\nCic. uses _in commune_, but in a different sense, viz. for the common\nweal. See Freund, sub voc.\n\n_Instituta_, political; _ritus_, religious.\n\n_Quae nationes. And what tribes_, etc.; _quae_ for _quaeque_ by\nasyndeton, or perhaps, as Rit. suggests, by mistake of the copyist.--\n_Commigraverint_. Subj. of the indirect question. Gr. 265, Z. 552.\n\nGerman critics have expended much labor and research, in defining the\nlocality of the several German tribes with which the remainder of the\nTreatise is occupied. In so doing, they rely not only on historical data,\nbut also on the traces of ancient names still attached to cities,\nforests, mountains, and other localities (cf. note, \u00c2\u00a7 16). These we shall\nsometimes advert to in the notes. But on the whole, these speculations of\nGerman antiquarians are not only less interesting to scholars in other\ncountries, but are so unsatisfactory and contradictory among themselves,\nthat, for the most part, we shall pass them over with very little\nattention. There is manifestly an intrinsic difficulty in defining the\never changing limits of uncivilized and unsettled tribes. Hence the\nirreconcilable contradictions between _ancient authorities_, as well as\nmodern critiques, on this subject. Tacitus, and the Roman writers\ngenerally, betray their want of definite knowledge of Germany by the\nfrequency with which they specify the names of mountains and rivers. The\nfollowing geographical outline is from Ukert, and must suffice for the\n_geography_ of the remainder of the Treatise: \"In the corner between the\nRhine and the Danube, are the Decumates Agri, perhaps as far as the\nMayne, 29. Northward on the Rhine dwell the Mattiaci, whose neighbors on\nthe east are the Chatti, 30. On the same river farther north are the\nUsipii and the Tencteri; then the Frisii, 32-34. Eastward of the Tencteri\ndwell the Chamavi and the Angrivarii (earlier the Bructeri), and east or\nsoutheast of them the Dulgibini and Chasuarii, 34. and other small\ntribes. Eastward of the Frisii Germany juts out far towards the north,\n35. On the coast of the bay thus formed, dwell the Chauci, east of the\nFrisii and the above mentioned tribes; on the south, they reach to the\nChatti. East of the Chauci and the Chatti are the Cherusci, 36. whose\nneighbors are the Fosi. The Cherusci perhaps, according to Tacitus, do\nnot reach to the ocean; and in the angle of the above bay, he places the\nCimbri, 37. Thus Tacitus represents the western half of Germany. The\neastern is of greater dimensions. There are the Suevi, 38. He calls the\ncountry Suevia, 41. and enumerates many tribes, which belong there.\nEastward of the Cherusci he places the Semnones and Langobardi; north of\nthem are the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suardones and\nNuithones; and all these he may have regarded as lying in the interior,\nand as the most unknown tribes, 41. He then mentions the tribes that\ndwell on the Danube, eastward from the Decumates Agri: the Hermunduri, in\nwhose country the Elbe has its source; the Narisci, Marcomanni and Quadi,\n41-42. The Marcomanni hold the country which the Boii formerly possessed;\nand northward of them and the Quadi, chiefly on the mountains which run\nthrough Suevia, are the Marsigni, Gothini, Osi and Burii, 43. Farther\nnorth are the Lygii, consisting of many tribes, among which the most\ndistinguished are the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii and Naharvali, 43.\nStill farther north dwell the Gothones, and, at the Ocean, the Rugii and\nLemovii. Upon islands in the ocean live the Suiones, 44. Upon the\nmainland, on the coast, are the tribes of the Aestyi, and near them,\nperhaps on islands, the Sitones, 45. Perhaps he assigned to them the\nimmense islands to which he refers in his first chapter. Here ends\nSuevia. Whether the Peucini, Venedi and Fenni are to be reckoned as\nGermans or Sarmatians, is uncertain, 46. The Hellusii and Oxonae are\nfabulous.\"\n\nThe following paragraph from Prichard's Researches embodies some of the\nmore general conclusions of _ethnographers_, especially of Zeuss, on whom\nPrichard, in common with Orelli and many other scholars, places great\nreliance. \"Along the coast of the German Ocean and across the isthmus of\nthe Cimbric peninsula to the shore of the Baltic, were spread the tribes\nof the Chauci and Frisii, the Anglii, Saxones and the Teutones or Jutes,\nwho spoke the _Low-German_ languages, and formed one of the four\ndivisions of the German race, corresponding as it seems with the\n_Ingaevones_ of Tacitus and Pliny. In the higher and more central parts,\nthe second great division of the race, that of the _Hermiones_, was\nspread, the tribes of which spoke _Upper_ or _High-German_ dialects.\nBeginning in the West with the country of the Sigambri on the Rhine,\nand from that of the Cherusci and Angrivarii near the Weser and the\nHartz, this division comprehended, besides those tribes, the Chatti, the\nLangobardi, the Hermunduri, the Marcomanni and Quadi, the Lugii, and\nbeyond the Vistula the Bastarnae, in the neighborhood of the Carpathian\nhills. To the eastward and northward of the last mentioned, near the\nlower course of the Vistula and thence at least as far as the Pregel,\nwere the primitive abodes of the Goths and their cognate tribes, who are\nperhaps the _Istaevones_.\" The fourth division of Prichard embraced the\nScandinavians, who spoke a language kindred to the Germans and were\nusually classed with them. Those who would examine this subject more\nthoroughly, will consult Adelung, Zeuss, Grimm, Ritter, Ukert, Prichard,\nLatham, &c., who have written expressly on the geography or the\nethnography of Germany.\n\n\nXXVIII. _Summus auctorum_, i.e. omnium scriptorum is, qui plurimum\n_auctoritatis fideique_ habet. K. Cf. Sueton. Caes. 56. Though T.\ncommends so highly the _authority_ of Caesar as a writer, yet he differs\nfrom him in not a few matters of fact, as well as opinion; owing chiefly,\ndoubtless, to the increased means of information which he possessed in\nthe age of Trajan.\n\n_Divus Julius. Divus_==deified, _divine_; an epithet applied to the Roman\nEmperors after their decease.--_Tradit_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 6, 24: fuit\nantea tempus, cum _Germanos Galli_ virtute _superarent_, ultro bella\ninferrent, propter hominum multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum\ncolonias mitterent. Livy probably refers to the same events, when he says\n(Lib. 5, 34), that in the reign of Priscus Tarquinius, two immense bodies\nof Gauls migrated and took possession, the one of the Hercynian Forest,\nthe other of Upper Italy.\n\n_Amnis. The Rhine.--Promiscuas. Unsettled, ill defined_.\n\n_Quo minus_ after a verb of hindering is followed by the subj. H. 499;\nZ. 543.\n\n_Nulla--divisas_, i.e. _not distributed among different and powerful\nkings_.\n\n_Hercyniam silvam_. A series of forests and mountains, stretching from\nHelvetia to Hungary in a line parallel to the Danube, and described by\nCaesar (B.G. 6, 25), as nine day's journey in breadth and more than\nsixty in length. The name seems to be preserved in the modern _Hartz_\nForest, which is however far less extensive.\n\n_Igitur--Helvetii_==igitur _regionem_, inter, etc. See note on _colunt_,\n16. _Igitur_ seldom stands as the first word in a sentence in Cicero. Cf.\nZ. 357; and K\u00c3\u00bchner's Cic. Tusc. Qu. 1, 6, 11. Here it introduces a more\nparticular explanation of the general subject mentioned at the close of\nthe previous chapter. So in A. 13. When so used, it sometimes stands\nfirst in Cic., always in T. Cf. Freund sub v. Touching the Helvetii, see\nCaes. B.G. 1, 1; T. His. 1, 67.\n\n_Boihemi nomen_. Compounded of Boii and heim (home of the Boii), now\nBohemia. _Heim==ham_ in the termination of so many names of towns, e.g.\nFraming_ham_, Notting_ham_. The Boii were driven from their country by\nthe Marcomanni, 42. The fugitives are supposed to have carried their name\ninto Boioaria, now Bavaria. Cf. Prichard's Physical Researches, Vol. III.\nChap. 1, Sec. 6; and Latham's Germany of Tacitus in loco.\n\n_Germanorum natione_, i.e. German in situation, not in origin, for this\nhe expressly denies or disproves in 43, from the fact that they spoke\nthe Pannonian language, and paid tribute. The doubt expressed here has\nreference only to their original _location_, not to their original stock,\nand is therefore in no way inconsistent with the affirmation in chapter\n43.\n\n_Cum==since_. Hence followed by subj. H. 518, I.; Z. 577.\n\n_Utriusque ripae_. Here of the _Danube_, the right or Pannonian bank of\nwhich was occupied by the Aravisci, and the left or German bank by the\nOsi. So elsewhere of the _Rhine_, 37, and of both, 17, and 23.\n\n_Treveri_. Hence modern _Treves_.\n\n_Circa_. _In respect to_. A use foreign to the golden age of Latin\ncomposition, but not unfrequent in the silver age. See Ann. 11, 2. 15.\nHis. 1, 43. Cf. Z. 298, and note, H. 1, 13.\n\n_Affectationem_. _Eager desire_ to pass for native Germans. Ad verbum,\ncf. note, II. 1, 80.\n\n_Ultro_. Radically the same with _ultra_==beyond. Properly beyond\nexpectation, beyond necessity, beyond measure, beyond any thing mentioned\nin the foregoing context. Hence unexpectedly, freely, cheerfully, very\nmuch, even more. Here _very_, _quite_. Gr.\n\n_Inertia Gallorum_. T., says G\u00c3\u00bcn., is an everlasting persecutor of the\nGauls, cf. A. 11.\n\n_Haud dubie_==haud dubii. It limits Germanorum populi. _Undoubtedly\nGerman tribes_.\n\n_Meruerint_. Not merely deserved, but _earned_, _attained_. For the subj.\nafter _quanquam_, cf. note, 35.\n\n_Agrippinenses_. From Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus and wife of\nClaudius. Ann. 12, 27. Now Cologne.\n\n_Conditoris_. _Conditor_ with the earlier Latins is an epicene, conditrix\nbeing of later date. Here used of Agrippina. Of course _sui_ cannot agree\nwith _conditoris_. It is a reflexive pronoun, the objective gen. after\n_conditoris_==the founder of _themselves_, i.e. of their state, cf.\n_odium sui_, 33.\n\n_Experimento_. Abl. _on_ trial, not _for_; i.e. in consequence of being\nfound faithful. In reference to the Ubii, cf. His. 4, 28.\n\n\nXXIX. _Virtute_ sc. bellica.\n\n_Non multum ex ripa_. _A small tract on the bank, but chiefly an island\nin the river_. Cf. His. 4, 12: extrema Gallicae orae, simulque insulam,\noccupavere.\n\n_Chattorum quondam_. The very name Batavi is thought by some to be a\ncorrupted or modified form of Chatti. See Rit. in loc.\n\n_Transgressus. When_ is not known, but Julius Caesar found them already\nin possession of their new territory. B.G. 4, 10.\n\n_Fierent_. Subj. after _eas--quibus==such that_. H. 500, 2; Z. 556.\n\n_Nec--contemnuntur. Are neither dishonored_. So in His. 4, 17. the\nBatavians are called _tributorum expertes_.\n\n_Oneribus. The burdens of regular taxation.--Collationibus. Extraordinary\ncontributions_.\n\n_Tela_, offensive; _arma_, defensive armor.\n\n_In sua ripa_. On the right or eastern bank of the Rhine. _Agunt_ is to\nbe taken with _in sua ripa_, as well as with _nobiscum_, which are\nantithetic to each other. Meaning: in situation Germans, in feeling\nRomans.\n\n_Mente animoque. In mind and spirit. Mens_ is properly the understanding,\n_animus_ the feeling part, and both together comprehend the whole soul.\n\n_Acrius animantur. Made more courageous by the influence of their very\nsoil and climate even_ (_adhuc_, cf. note, 19).\n\n_Numeraverim_. Subj. cf. note, 2: _crediderim_.\n\n_Decumates--exercent. Exercent_==colunt, So Virg. tellurem, terram, humum,\nsolum, &c., _exercere_.\n\n_Decumates_==decumanos. Occurs only here. Tithe-paying lands. For their\nlocation, see note, 27.\n\n_Dubiae possessionis_, i.e. _insecure_, till confirmed by _limite acto\npromotisque praesidiis_, i.e. _extending the boundary and advancing the\ngarrisons or outposts_.\n\n_Sinus. Extreme bend_ or _border_. Cf. note, 1. So Virg. (Geor. 2 123)\ncalls India extremi _sinus_ orbis.\n\n_Provinciae_. A province, not any particular one.\n\n\nXXX. _Initium inchoant_. Pleonastic. So initio orto, His. 1, 76; initium\ncoeptum, His. 2, 79; perferre toleraverit, Ann. 3, 3. _Ultra_ is farther\nback from the Rhine. Chattorum sedes ubi nunc magnus ducatus et\nprincipatus _Hassorum_, quorum nomen a Chattis deductum. Ritter.\nCha_tt_i==He_ss_ians, as Germ. wa_ss_er==Eng. wa_t_er, and [Greek:\nprasso==pratto].\n\n_Effusis. Loca effusa_ sunt, quae _latis campis_ patent. K. This use\nbelongs to the later Latin, though Horace applies the word with _late_ to\nthe sea: effusi late maria. Gr.\n\n_Durant siquidem_, etc. On the whole, I am constrained to yield to the\nauthority and the arguments of Wr., Or., D\u00c3\u00b6d., and Rit., and place the\npause before _durant_, instead of after it as in the first edition.\n_Durant_ precedes _siquidem_ for the sake of emphasis, just as _quin\nimmo_ (chap. 14) and _quin etiam_ (13) yield their usual place to the\nemphatic word. These are all departures from established usage. See notes\nin loc. cit. _Que_ must be understood, after _paulatim_: it is inserted\nin the text by Ritter.\n\n_Rarescunt_. _Become fewer_ and farther apart. So Virg. Aen. 3, 411:\n_Angusti rarescent claustra Pelori_.\n\n_Chattos suos_. As if the Chatti were the children of the Forest, and the\nForest emphatically their country. Passow.\n\n_Prosequitur, deponit_. Begins, continues, and ends with the Chatti.\nPoetical==is coextensive with.\n\n_Duriora_, sc. solito, or his, cf. Gr. 256, 9.--_Stricti, sinewy,\nstrong_, which has the same root as _stringo_.\n\n_Ut inter Germanos_, i.e. pro ingenio Germanorum, G\u00c3\u00bcn. So we say\nelliptically: _for Germans_.\n\n_Praeponere_, etc. A series of infinitives without connectives, denoting\na hasty enumeration of particulars; elsewhere, sometimes, a rapid\nsuccession of events. Cf. notes, A. 36, and H. 1, 36. The particulars\nhere enumerated, all refer to _military_ proceedings.\n\n_Disponere--noctem_. _They distribute the day_, sc. as the period of\nvarious labors; _they fortify the night_, sc. as the scene of danger.\nStill highly poetical.\n\n_Ratione_. _Way, manner_. Al. _Romanae_.\n\n_Ferramentis_. _Iron tools_, axes, mattocks, &c.--_Copiis_. _Provisions_.\n\n_Rari_. Predicate of _pugna_, as well as _excursus_.--_Velocitas_ applies\nto cavalry, _cunctatio_ to infantry; _juxta_==connected with, allied to,\ncf. juxta libertatem, 21.\n\n\nXXXI. _Aliis--populis_. Dat. after _usurpatum_, which with its adjuncts\nis the subject of _vertit_. See same construction, His. 1, 18: observatum\nid antiquitus comitiis dirimendis non terruit Galbam, etc., cf. also A.\n1.--_Audentia_ occurs only thrice in T. (G. 31. 34. Ann. 15, 53), and\nonce in Pliny (Ep. 8, 4). It differs from _audacia_ in being a _virtue_.\n\n_Vertit_. Intrans. Not so found in Cic., but in Liv., Caes., and Sall.,\nnot unfrequent. Gr. Cic. however uses _anno vertente_.\n\n_In consensum vertit_. _Has become the common custom_.\n\n_Ut primum_. _Just as soon as_. A causal relation is also implied; hence\nfollowed by the subj.\n\n_Crinem--submittere_. We find this custom (_of letting the hair and beard\ngrow long_) later among the Lombards and the Saxons, cf. Turn. His. Ang.\nSax., App. to B. 2.\n\n_Super--spolia_, i.e. _over the bloody spoils_ of a slain enemy.\n\n_Revelant_, i.e. they remove the hair and beard, which have so long\n_veiled_ the face.\n\n_Retulisse==repaid, discharged their obligations to those who gave them\nbirth_.\n\n_Squalor_. This word primarily denotes roughness; secondarily and usually\nfilth: here the deformity of unshorn hair and beard.\n\n_Insuper_, i.e. besides the long hair and beard. The proper position of\n_insuper_ is, as here, between the adj. and subs., cf. 34: immensos\n_insuper_ lacus; see also _insuper_, 12.\n\n_Absolvat_. Subj. after _donec_. So _faciat_ below. See note, 1.\n\n_Hic--habitus_, sc. _ferreum annulum_, cf. 17. _Plurimis_==permultis,\nRit.\n\n_Placet_. Antithetic to _ignominiosum genti_. Very many of the Chatti are\n_pleased_ with that which is esteemed a disgrace by most Germans, and so\npleased with it as to retain it to old age, and wear it as a badge of\ndistinction (_canent insignes_).\n\n_Nova_. Al. _torva. Strange, unusual_. Placed in the _van_ (_prima\nacies_), because as the author says, \u00c2\u00a7 43: primi in omnibus proeliis\n_oculi_ vincuntur.\n\n_Mansuescunt_. Primarily said of wild beasts, _accustomed to the hand of\nman_ or _tamed_. So _immanis_, _not_ handled, wild, savage. The clause\nintroduced by _nam_ illustrates or enforces _visu nova_, and may be\nrendered thus: _for not even in time of peace do they grow gentle_ and\nput on _a milder aspect_.\n\n_Exsanguis_. Usually lifeless or pale. Here _languid, feeble_.\n\n\nXXXII. _Alveo_==quoad alveum. Abl. of respect, H. 429; Z. 429.\n\n_Certum. Fixed, well defined_, i.e. not divided and diffused, (so as to\nform of itself no sufficient border or boundary to the Roman Empire) as\nit was nearer its source among the Chatti. So this disputed word seems to\nbe explained by the author himself in the following clause; _quique\nterminus esse sufficiat==and such that it suffices to be a boundary_.\n_Qui==talis ut_; hence followed by the subj. H. 500, I.; Z. 558. So Mela\n(3, 2) contrasts _solidus et certo alveo lapsus_ with _huc et illuc\ndispergitur_.\n\n_Tencteris_==apud Tencteros, by _enallage_, cf. note on _ad patrem_, 20,\nand other references there. The Tencteri and Usipii seem to have been at\nlength absorbed into the mass of people, who appear under the later name\nof Alemanni. Cf. Prichard.\n\n_Familiam. Servants_, cf. note on same word, 15. See also Beck Gall.,\nExc. 1. Sc. 1.--Penates==our _homestead_.\n\n_Jura succesionum==heir looms_, all that goes down by hereditary\ndescent.\n\n_Excipit_. Here in the unusual sense of _inherits.--Cetera_, sc. _jura\nsuccessionum_.\n\n_Bello_. Abl. and limits both _ferox_ and _melior_. Meaning: _The horses\nare inherited, not, like the rest of the estate, by the eldest son, but\nby the bravest_.\n\n\nXXXIII. _Occurrebant. Met the view, presented themselves_. Almost the\nsense of the corresponding English word. The structure of _narratur_\n(as impers.) is very rare in the earlier authors, who would say:\n_Chamavi narrantur_. Cf. His. 1, 50. 90. The _Chamavi_, &c., were\njoined afterwards to the Franks. Cf. Prichard. The present town of\n_Ham_ in Westphalia probably preserves the name and gives the\n_original_ locality of the _Chamavi_, the present _Engern_ that of the\n_Angrivarii_. The termination varii or uarii probably==inhabitants of.\nThus angrivarii==inhabitants of Engern. Chasuarii==Inhabitants of the\nriver Hase. The same element is perhaps contained in the termination of\nBruct_eri_ and Tenct_eri_. See Latham in loco.\n\n_Nos, se_. Romanos. _Erga_==inclined to (cf. vergo), _towards_.\n\n_Spectaculo_. Ablative. Invidere is constructed by the Latins in the\nfollowing ways: invidere alicui aliquid, alicui alicujus rei, alicui\naliqua re, alicui in aliqua re. Hess. The construction here (with the\nabl. of the thing, which was the object of envy) belongs to the silver\nage. Cf. Quint. (Inst. 9, 3, 1) who contrasts it with the usage of\nCicero, and considers it as illustrating the fondness of the age for\n_figurative_ language.\n\n_Oblectationi oculisque_. Hendiadys for ad oblectationem oculorum. The\nauthor here exults in the promiscuous slaughter of the German Tribes by\neach other's arms, as a brilliant spectacle to Roman eyes--a feeling\nlittle congenial to the spirit of Christianity, but necessarily nurtured\nby the gladiatorial shows and bloody amusements of the Romans, to say\nnothing of the habitual hostility which they waged against all other\nnations, that did not submit to their dominion.\n\n_Quaeso_, sc. _deos_. Though _fortune_ is spoken of below, as controlling\nthe destiny of nations. This passage shows clearly that Tacitus, with all\nhis partiality for German manners and morals, still retains the heart of\na Roman patriot. He loves his country with all her faults, and bears no\ngood-will to her enemies, however many and great their virtues. The\npassage is important, as illustrating the spirit and design of the whole\nTreatise. The work was not written as a blind panegyric on the Germans,\nor a spleeny satire on the Romans. Neither was it composed for the\npurpose of stirring up Trajan to war against Germany; to such a purpose,\nsuch a clause, as _urgentibus imperii fatis_, were quite adverse. Least\nof all was it written for the mere pastime and amusement of Roman\nreaders. It breathes the spirit at once of the earnest patriot, and the\nhigh-toned moralist.\n\n_Odium sui_. Cf. note, 28: _conditor. Hatred of themselves_; i.e. of one\nanother. So in Greek, the reflexive pronoun is often used for the\nreciprocal.\n\n_Quando==since_; a subjective reason. Cf. note, His. I, 31; and Z. 346.\n--_Urgentibus--fatis_, sc. to discord and dissolution, for such were the\nforebodings of patriotic and sagacious minds ever after the overthrow of\nthe Republic, even under the prosperous reign of Trajan.\n\n\nXXXIV. _A tergo_, i.e. further back from the Rhine, or towards the East--\n_A fronte_, nearer the Rhine or towards the West. Both are to be referred\nto the Angrivarii and Chamavi, who had the Dulgibini and the Chasuarii in\ntheir rear (on the east), and the Frisii on their front (towards the west\nor northwest).--_Frisii_, the Frieslanders.\n\n_Majoribus--virium. They have the name of Greater or Less Frisii,\naccording to the measure of their strength_. For this sense of _ex_\nsee note 7. For the case of _majoribus minoribusque_ see Z. 421, and\nH. 387, 1.\n\n_Praetexuntur. Are bordered by the Rhine_ (hemmed, as the toga\n_praetexta_ by the purple); or, as Freund explains, are covered by it,\ni.e. lie behind it--_Immensos lacus_. The bays, or arms of the sea, at\nthe mouth of the Rhine (Zuyder Zee, etc.), taken for lakes by T. and\nPliny (Ann. 1, 60. 2, 8. N.H. 4, 29). They have been greatly changed by\ninundations. See Mur. in loco.\n\n_Oceanum_, sc. Septentrionalem.--_Sua_, sc. parte.--_Tentavimus,\nexplored_.\n\n_Herculis columnas_. \"Wherever the land terminated, and it appeared\nimpossible to proceed further, ancient maritime nations feigned pillars\nof Hercules. Those mentioned in this passage some authors have placed at\nthe extremity of Friesland, and others at the entrance of the Baltic.\"\nKy. cf. note, 3.\n\n_Adiit_, i.e. vere adiit, _actually_ visited that part of the world.\n\n_Quicquid--consensimus_. This passage is a standard illustration of the\n_Romana interpretatione_ (\u00c2\u00a7 43), the Roman construction, which the Romans\nput upon the mythology and theology of other nations. It shows that they\nwere accustomed to apply the names of their gods to the gods of other\nnations on the ground of some resemblance in character, history, worship,\n&c. Sometimes perhaps a resemblance in the _names_ constituted the ground\nof identification.\n\n_Druso Germanico_. Some read Druso _et_ Germanico; others Druso,\nGermanico, as a case of asyndeton (Gr. 323, 1 (1.)); for both Drusus and\nGermanicus sailed into the Northern Ocean, and it is not known that\nGermanicus (the son of Drusus and stepson of Tiberius, who is by some\nsupposed to be meant here) is ever called _Drusus Germanicus_. But\nDrusus, the father of Germanicus, is called Drusus Germanicus in the\nHistories (5, 19), where he is spoken of as having thrown a mole or dam\nacross the Rhine; and it is not improbable that he is the person here\nintended. So K., Or. and Wr.\n\n_Se_, i.e. the Ocean. See H. 449, II.; Z. 604.\n\n_Inquiri_. Impersonal==_investigation to be made. E_. suggests\n_inquirenti_, agreeing with _Germanico_. But T., unlike the earlier Latin\nauthors, not unfrequently places an infin. after a verb of hindering.\n\n_Credere quam scire_. T. perhaps alluded to the precept of the\nPhilosopher, who said: Deum cole, atque crede, sed noli quaerere.\nMurphy.\n\n\nXXXV. _In Septentrionem_, etc. _On the North, it falls back_, sc. into\nthe Ocean, _with_ an immense _bend_ or peninsula. The _flexus_ here\nspoken of is called _sinus_ in chap. 37, and describes the Cimbric\nChersonesus, or Danish Peninsula. See D\u00c3\u00b6d., Or. and Rit. in loc.--_Ac\nprimo statim. And first immediately_, sc. as we begin to trace the\nnorthern coast.--_Lateribus_, sc. the eastern.\n\n_Quanquam_ followed by the subj., seldom in Cic., but usually in T.,\nZ. 574, Note. Cf. note, His. 5, 21.--_Sinuetur_, sc. southwards.\n_Donec--sinuetur_. Cf. note, 1: _erumpat_.\n\n_Inter Germanos_. Considered among the Germans, _in the estimation of the\nGermans_.\n\n_Quique--tueri_. A clause connected to an _adj_. (nobilissimus), cf.\ncertum, quique, 32. _Qui_ in both passages==talis, ut. Hence followed by\nsubj. H. 501, I.; Z. 558.\n\n_Impotentia, ungoverned passion, [Greek: akrateia]. Impotentia_ seldom\ndenotes want of power, but usually that unrestrained passion, which\nresults from the want of ability to control one's self.\n\n_Ut--agant_ depends on _assequuntur_. Subj. H. 490; Z. 531, _a_.\n\n_Si res poscat_. Some copies read: si res poscat _exercitus_. But posco\nand postulo seldom have the object expressed in such clauses, cf. 44: ut\nres poscit; 6: prout ratio poscit. So also Cic. and Sall., pass.\n_Exercitus_ is subject nom., _promptus_ being understood, as pred.; and\n_plurimum virorum equorumque_ explains or rather enforces _exercitus:\nand, if the case demand, an army, the greatest abundance of men and\nhorses_.\n\n_Quiescentibus_, i.e. bellum non gerentibus; _eadem_, i.e. the same, as\nif engaged in war.\n\n\nXXXVI. _Cherusci_. It was their chief, Arminius (Germ. Hermann), who,\nmaking head against the Romans, was honored as the Deliverer of Germany,\nand celebrated in ballad songs, which are preserved to this day. See his\nachievements in Ann. B. 1, and 2. This tribe became afterwards the head\nof the Saxon confederacy.\n\n_Marcentem. Enervating_. So _marcentia pocula_, Stat. Silv. 4, 6, 56. It\nis usually intransitive, and is taken here by some in the sense of\nlanguid, enervate (literally withered).--_Illacessiti_ is a post-Augustan\nword. Cf. Freund.\n\n_Impotentes_. Cf. impotentia, 35.\n\n_Falso quiescas_. Falleris, dum quiescis. Dilthey. Cf. note, 14:\n_possis_.\n\n_Ubi manu agitur_. Where matters are decided by might rather than right.\nCf. _manu agens_, A. 9.\n\n_Nomina superioris. Virtues_ (only) _of the stronger party_, the\nconqueror. They are deemed vices in the weaker.\n\n_Chattis--cessit: while to the Chatti_, who were _victorious, success\nwas imputed for wisdom_. The antithetic particle at the beginning of the\nclause is omitted. Cf. note, 4: _minime_.\n\n_Fuissent_. Subj. after _cum_ signifying _although_. H. 516, II.\n\n\nXXXVII. _Sinum. Peninsula_, sc. the Cimbric. Cf. note, 35: _flexu_; 81:\n_sinus_.\n\n_Cimbri_. The same with the Cimmerii, a once powerful race, who,\nmigrating from western Asia, that hive of nations, overran a large part\nof Europe, but their power being broken by the Romans, and themselves\nbeing overrun and conquered by the Gothic or German Tribes, they were\npushed to the extreme western points of the continent and the British\nIsles, where, and where alone, distinct traces of their language and\nliterature remain to this day. They have left their name indelibly\nimpressed on different localities in their route, e.g. the Cimmerian\nBosphorus, the Cimbric Chersonesus (now Jutland, occupied by the Cimbri\nin the days of T.), Cumberland (Cumbria, from Cimbri) &c. The ancient\nname of the Welsh was also Cymri, cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax. 1. 2.\n\n_Gloria_ is abl. limiting _ingens_.\n\n_Castra ac spatia_. In apposition with _lata vestigia_==spatiosa castra\nor castrorum spatia, H. 704, II. 2; Z. 741.\n\n_Utraque ripa_, sc. of the Rhine, _the_ river and river bank by eminence.\n\n_Molem manusque. The mass of their population, and the number of their\narmies_. Observe the alliteration, as if he had said: measure the mass\nand might.\n\n_Exitus_, i.e. _migrationis_. Often used in this sense, cf. Caes. B.C.\n3, 69: Salutem et _exitum_ sibi pariebant.--_Fidem, proof_.\n\n_Sexcentesimum--annum_. T. follows the Catonian Era. According to\nthe Varronian Era, received by the moderns, the date would be A.U.C.\n641 = A.C. 113.\n\n_Alterum--consulatum_. The second consulship of Trajan (when he was also\nEmperor) was, after the reckoning of Tacitus, A.U.C. 850, according to\nmodern computation, 851 = A.D. 98. This year doubtless marks the time when\nthis treatise was written, else why selected?\n\n_Vincitur_. So long is Germany in being conquered. (The work was never\ncompleted.) Cf. Liv. 9, 3: quem per annos jam prope _triginta vincimus_.\n\n_Medio--spatio. In the intervening period_, sc. of 210 years.\n\n_Samnis--Galliaeve_. The Romans had fought bloody, and some times\ndisastrous battles with the Samnites (at the Caudine Forks, Liv. 9, 2.),\nwith the Carthaginians (in the several Punic Wars), with the Spaniards\nunder Viriathus and Sertorius (Florus, Lib. 2.), with the Gauls (Caes.\nB.G. pass.). But none of these were so sanguinary as their wars with the\nGermans.\n\n_Admonuere_, sc. vulneribus, cladibus==castigavere.\n\n_Regno--libertas_. Liberty and monarchy in studied antithesis. T. means to\nimply that the former is the stronger principle of the two.\n\n_Arsacis_. The family name of the Parthian kings, as Pharaoh and Ptolemy\nof the Egyptian, Antiochus of the Syrian, &c.\n\n_Amisso et ipse_, sc. _oriens_; the East _itself also lost_ its prince\n(Pacorus), in the engagement, as well as the Romans their leader\n(Crassus).--_Objecerit, reproach us with_. Subj. Cf. n. G. 2: _peteret_.\n\n_Ventidium_. Commander under Anthony, and conqueror of the Parthians in\nthree battles, A.U.C. 715. He was raised from the lowest rank and the\nmeanest employment, hence perhaps the expression, _dejectus infra,\nhumbled beneath Ventidius_.\n\n_Carbone--Manlio_, Cneius Papirius Carbo defeated at Noreja, A.U. 641\n(Liv. Epit. 63.), L. Cassius Longinus defeated and slain, 647 (Caes. B.G.\n1, 7. 12.), M. Aurelius Scaurus defeated and taken captive, 648 (Liv.\nEpit. 67.), Servilius Caepio and M. Manlius defeated with great slaughter\nat Tolosa, 649 (Liv. Epit. 67.), Quintilius Varus defeated and slain, 762\n(Suet. Oct. 23.)--all these victories over the Romans in their highest\nstrength and glory--either in the time of the _Republic (Populo Romano)_,\nor of the _Empire_ under Augustus (_Caesari_)--all these attested the\ncourage and military prowess of the Germans; and they were still, for the\nmost part, as free and as powerful as ever.\n\n_Caius Marius_ almost annihilated the Cimbri at Aquae Sextiae, A.U.C.\n652.\n\n_Drusus_. Claudius Drusus invaded Germany four times, 742-3, and finally\nlost his life by falling from his horse on his return, cf. Dio. Libb. 54.\n55.\n\n_Nero_, commonly known as Tiberius (brother of Drusus and stepson of\nAugustus), had the command in Germany at three different times, 746-7,\n756-9, 764-5, cf. Suet. Tib. 9. seq.\n\n_Germanicus_, son of Drusus, made four campaigns in Germany, A.D. 14-16,\ncf. Ann. B. 1. and 2.\n\n_C. Caesaris_. Caligula, cf. Suet. Calig.; T. His. 4, 15.\n\n_Discordiae--armorum_. The civil wars after the death of Nero under\nGalba, Otho, and Vitellius.\n\n_Expugnatis--hibernis_. By the Batavians under Civilis. His. 4, 12 seq.;\nA. 41.\n\n_Affectavere. Aspired to the government of_, cf. note on affectationem,\n28. After _donec_, T. always expresses a single definite past action by\nthe perf. ind., cf. A. 36: _donec--cohortatus est_; a repeated, or\ncontinued past action by the imp. subj. cf. note, A. 19: _donec--fieret_;\nand a present action, which is in the nature of the case also a continued\naction, by the pres. subj. cf. note, 1: _separet_.\n\n_Triumphati_. Poetice, cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 837: Triumphata Corintho; Hor.\nOd. 3, 3, 43: Triumphati Medi. The reference here is to the ridiculous\ntriumph of Domitian, A. 39, in which slaves, purchased and dressed out\nfor the purpose, were borne as captives through the streets.\n\n\nXXXVIII. _Suevis_. In the time of T. a powerful confederacy, embracing\nall the tribes enumerated in 39-45, and covering all the eastern and\nlarger half of Germany. But the confederacy was soon dissolved and seldom\nappears in subsequent history. We still have a trace of their name in the\nModern _Suabia_. The name is supposed by some philologists (e.g. Zeuss)\nto denote _unsettled wanderers_ (Germ. Schweben, to wave, to hover, cf.\nCaes. B.G. 4, 1: Suevis non longius anno remanere uno in loco, etc.); as\nthat of the Saxons does settlers, or _fixed residents_ (Germ. Sassen),\nand that of the Franks, _freemen_. See Rup. in loc. An ingenious Article\nin the North American Review (July, 1847), makes the distinction of Suevi\nand non-Suevi radical and permanent in the religion and the language of\nthe Germans; the Suevi becoming Orthodox Catholics, and the non-Suevi\nArians in Ecclesiastical History, and the one High-Dutch and the other\nLow-Dutch in the development of their language.\n\n_Adhuc_. Cf. note on it, 19. As to position, cf. _insuper_ 31, and 34.\nThe Suevi are _still (adhuc)_ divided into distinct tribes bearing\ndistinct names, though united in a confederacy. Cf. Hand's Tursellinus,\n1, 163. D\u00c3\u00b6d. renders _besides_, sc. the general designation of Suevi.\n\n_In commune. In common_. Not used in this sense by Cic., Caes. and Liv.,\nthough frequent in T. Gr. Cf. note on the same, 27.\n\n_Obliquare. To turn the hair back, or comb it up_ contrary to its natural\ndirection--and then fasten it in a knot on the top of the head\n(_substringere nodo_); so it seems to be explained by the author himself\nbelow: _horrentem capillum retro sequuntur ac in ipso solo vertice\nreligant_. Others translate _obliquare_ by _twist_. Many ancient writers\nspeak of this manner of tying the hair among the Germans, cf. Sen. de\nIra. 3, 26.; Juv. 13, 164.\n\n_A servis separantur. Separantur_==distinguuntur. Servants among the\nSuevi seem to have had their hair shorn. So also it was among the Franks\nat a later date. Vid. Greg. Tur. 3, 8.\n\n_Rarum et intra_, etc. Enallage, cf. note _certum quique_, 32.\n\n_Retro sequuntur_, i.e. _follow it back_, as it were, in its growth, and\n_tie it up on the very crown of the head only_, instead of letting it\nhang down, as it grows (submittere crinem). So K., Or. and many others.\nPassow and D\u00c3\u00b6d. take sequuntur in the sense of _desire, delight in_ (our\nword _seek_). The word bears that sense, e.g. 5: argentum magis quam\naurum _sequuntur_. But then what is _retro_ sequuntur? for _retro_ must\nbe an adjunct of _sequuntur_ both from position, and because there is no\nother word which it can limit. _Saepe_ implies, that sometimes they made\na knot elsewhere, but _often they fasten_ it there, and there _only_. See\nOr. in loc. This whole passage illustrates our author's disposition to\navoid technical language. Cf. note, II. 2, 21.\n\n_Innoxiae. Harmless_, unlike the beauty cultivated among the _Romans_ to\ndazzle and seduce.\n\n_In altitudinem_, etc. _For the sake of_ (increased) _height and terror_,\ni.e. to appear tall and inspire terror. Cf. note, A, 5: _in\njactationem_; A. 7: _in suam famam_. The antithetic particle is omitted\nbefore this clause as it often is by our author.\n\n_Ut hostium oculis_, to strike with terror the eyes of the enemy, for\nprimi in omnibus proeliis _oculi_ vincuntur, 43.\n\n\nXXXIX. _Vetustissimos. Oldest_. _Vetus_ is _old_, of long _duration_\n([Greek; etos], aetas). _antiquus, ancient_, belonging to a _preceding_\nage (ante). _Recens_ (fresh, young) is opposed to the former: _novus_\n(new, modern), to the latter. See Ramshorn and Freund.\n\n_Fides antiquitatis. Antiquitatis_ is objective gen.==_the belief, or\npersuasion of their antiquity_.\n\n_Auguriis--sacram_. The commentators all note the hexameter structure of\nthese words, and many regard them as a quotation from some Latin poet.\nThe words themselves are also poetical, e.g. _patrum_ for _majorum_, and\n_formidine_ for _religione_. The coloring is Virgilian. Cf. Aen. 7, 172;\n8, 598. See Or. in loc. and Preliminary Remarks to the Histories, p. 234.\n\n_Legationibus coeunt_. Just as we say: _convene by their delegates_, or\n_representatives_.\n\n_Publice_==publica auctoritate, cf. same word, 10.\n\n_Primordia_. Initiatory rites.\n\n_Minor_, sc. numine. _Inferior to the god_.\n\n_Prae se ferens. Expressing in his external appearance, or bearing in his\nown person an acknowledgment of the power of the divinity_.\n\n_Evolvuntur_==se evolvunt, cf. Ann. 1, 13: cum Tiberii genua\nadvolveretur; also _lavantur_, 22.\n\n_Eo--tanquam. Has reference to this point, as if_, i.e. to this opinion,\nviz. that thence, etc. Cf. _illuc respicit tanquam_, 12.--_Inde_ From the\ngrove, or the god of the grove. Cf. 3: _Tuisconem ... originem gentis_.\n\n_Adjicit auctoritatem_, sc. isti superstitioni.\n\n_Magno corpore_==reipublicae magnitudine. _Corpore_, the body politic. So\nHis. 4, 64: redisse vos in corpus nomenque Germanorum.--_Habitantur_. Al.\nhabitant and habitantium, by conjecture. The subject is the Semnonian\n_country_ implied in _Semnonum: the Semnonians inhabit a hundred\nvillages_, is the idea.\n\n\nXL. _Langobardos_. The Lombards of Mediaeval history; so called probably\nfrom their long beards (Germ, lang and bart). First mentioned by\nVelleius, 2, 106: gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior. See also Ann. 2,\n45, 46, 62-64.--_Paucitas_ here stands opposed to the _magno corpore_ of\nthe Semnones in 39.\n\n_Per--periclitando_. Three different constructions, cf. notes 16, 18.\n\n_Reudigni_. Perhaps the Jutes, so intimately associated with the Angles\nin subsequent history. See Or. in loc. In like manner, Zeuss identifies\nthe _Suardones_ with the Heruli, and the _Nuithones_ with the Teutones.\n_Suardones_ perhaps==_sword_-men.\n\n_Anglii_. The English reader will here recognize the tribe of Germans\nthat subsequently invaded, peopled, and gave name to England\n(==_Angl-land_), commonly designated as the Anglo-Saxons. T. does not\nmention the _Saxons_. They are mentioned by Ptolemy and others, as\noriginally occupying a territory in this same part of Germany. They\nbecame at length so powerful, as to give their name to the entire\nconfederacy (including the Angles), which ruled northern Germany, as the\nFranks (the founders of the French monarchy) did southern. The Angles\nseem to have dwelt on the right bank of the Elbe, near its mouth, in the\ntime of T.\n\n_Nerthum_. This is the reading of the MSS. and the old editions. It\ncannot be doubted that T. speaks of Hertha (see Turn. His. Ang. Sax.,\nApp. to B. 2. chap. 3). \"But we must take care not to correct our author\nhimself.\" Passow. Grimm identifies this deity with Ni\u00c3\u00b6rdhr of the Edda,\nand derives the name from Nord (North).--_Terram matrem_. The Earth is\nworshipped by almost all heathen nations, as the mother of men and the\ninferior gods. See Mur. in loco. Cf. 2: Tuisconem Deum, _terra editum_;\nalso note, 9. Isidi.\n\n_Insula_. Scholars differ as to the Island. Probabilities perhaps are in\nfavor of Rugen, where the _secretus lacus_ mentioned below is still\nshown, still associated with superstitious legends.\n\n_Castum. Polluted by nothing profane_. So Hor: _castis lucis_.\n\n_Penetrali_, viz. _the sacred vehicle_.\n\n_Dignatur_. _Deems worthy_ of her visits.\n\n_Templo_, sc. the sacred grove. Templum, like [Greek: temenos], denotes\nany place _set apart_ (from [Greek: temno]) for sacred purposes, cf. 9.\n\n_Numen ipsum. The goddess herself_, not an image of her; for the Germans\nhave no images of their gods, 9. _Abluitur_, as if contaminated by\nintercourse with mortals.\n\n_Perituri_, etc. _Which can be seen only on penalty of death_.\n\n\nXLI. _Propior_, sc. to the Romans.--_Hermundurorum_. Ritter identifies\nthe name (_Hermun_ being omitted, and _dur_ being==_thur_) and the people\nwith the _Thur_ingians. Cf. note 2: _Ingaevones_.\n\n_Non in ripa. Not only_ (or _not so much_) _on the border_ (the\nriverbank), but also within the bounds of the Roman Empire.\n\n_Splendidissima--colonia_. This flourishing colony had no distinctive\nname in the age of T.; called afterwards Augusta Vindelicorum, now\nAugsburg.\n\n_Passim_. Wherever they chose--_Sine custode_. Not so others. Cf. His. 4,\n64: ut inermes ac prope nudi, _sub custode_ et pretio coiremus.\n\n_Cum--ostendamus. Cum==while, although_. Hence the subj.\n\n_Non concupiscentibus. Since they were not covetous_, G\u00c3\u00bcn. Gr renders:\n_though they were not equally desirous of it_.\n\n_Notum--auditur_. The Elbe had been _seen_ and _crossed_ by Drusus\nDomitius, and Tiberius. But now it was known only by _hearsay_. See a\nlike patriotic complaint at the close of 37.\n\n\nXLII. _Marcomanni_==men of the marches. See Latham in loc--_Sedes_, sc.\nBohemia.--_Pulsis olim Boiis_, cf. 28.\n\n_Degenerant_, sc. _a reliquorum virtute_, i.e. the Narisci and Quadi\n_are not unworthy, do not fall short_ of the bravery of their neighbors.\nthe Marcomanni.\n\n_Peragitur_. Al. _protegitur, porrigitur_, &c. Different words are\nsupplied as the subject of _peragitur_, e.g. Passow _iter_.; Rit.\n_cursus_; K. _frons_. The last is preferable. The meaning is: _This\ncountry_ (sc. of these tribes) _is the front_, so to speak (i.e. the\npart _facing the Romans_) _of Germany, so far as it is formed by the\nDanube_, i.e. so far as the Danube forms the boundary between Germany\nand the Roman Empire.\n\n_Marobodui_. Cf. Ann. 2, 62; Suet. Tib. 37.\n\n_Externos_, sc. reges, viz. the kings of the Hermunduri. Ann. 2, 62.--\n_Potentia. Power_ irrespective of right. _Potestas_ is lawful\n_authority_. See note, 7\n\n_Nec minus valent_, sc. being aided by our money, than they would be if\nthey were reinforced by our arms. This clause in some copies stands at\nthe beginning of 43.\n\n\nXLIII. _Retro. Back_ from the Danube and the Roman border.--_Referunt.\nResemble_. Poetical, cf. 20.\n\n_Et quod patiuntur_, sc. proves that they are not of German origin. They\npaid tribute as _foreigners_. The Gothini were probably a remnant of the\nexpelled Boii. Cf. note, 28, and Prichard, as there cited. Hence their\nGallic language.\n\n_Quo magis pudeat_. They have iron beyond even most of the Germans (cf.\n6), but (shame to tell) do not know how to use it in asserting their\nindependence. Subj. H. 497; Z. 536.\n\n_Pauca campestrium_. Poetical, but not uncommon in the later Latin. So\n41: secretiora Germaniae; His. 4, 28: extrema Galliarum. H. 396, III.\n2. 3; Z. 435.\n\n_Jugum. A mountain chain.--Vertices. Distinct summits_.\n\n_Insederunt_. This word usually takes a dat., or an abl., with _in_. But\nthe poets and later prose writers use it as a transitive verb with the\nacc.==_have settled, inhabited_. Cf. H. 371, 4; Z. 386; and Freund sub\nvoce. Observe the comparatively unusual form of the perf. 3d plur. in\n_-erunt_ instead of _-ere_. Cf. note, His. 2, 20.\n\n_Nomen_==gens. So nomen Latinum==Latins. Liv. pass.\n\n_Interpretatione Romana_. So we are every where to understand Roman\naccounts of the gods of other nations. They transferred to them the names\nof their own divinities according to some slight, perhaps fancied\nresemblance. Cf. note, 34: _quicquid consensimus_.\n\n_Ea vis numini_, i.e. these gods render the same service to the Germans,\nas Castor and Pollux to the Romans.\n\n_Alcis_, dat. pl. Perhaps from the Slavonic word holcy==kouros, Greek\nfor Castor and Pollux. Referable to no German root.\n\n_Peregrinae_, sc. Greek or Roman.--_Tamen_. Though these gods bear no\nvisible trace of Greek or Roman origin, _yet_ they are worshipped as\nbrothers, as youth, like the _Greek_ and _Roman Twins_.--\n_Superstitionis_==religionis. Cf. notes, His. 3, 58; 5, 13.\n\n_Lenocinantur. Cherish_, increase. Used rhetorically; properly, _to\npander_.--_Arte_, sc. nigra scuta, &c.--_Tempore_, sc. atras noctes, &c.\n--_Tincta==tattooed_.\n\n_Ipsaque formidine_, etc. _And by the very frightfulness and shadow of\nthe deathlike army. Umbra_ may be taken of the literal _shadows_ of the\nmen in the night, with Rit., or with D\u00c3\u00b6d. and Or., of the general _image_\nor _aspect_ of the army. _Feralis_, as an adj., is found only in poetry\nand post-Augustan prose. See Freund.\n\n_Gothones_. Probably the Getae of earlier, and the Goths of later\nhistory. See Or. in loc. and Grimm and other authorities as there cited.\nThe _Rugii_ have perpetuated their name in an island of the Baltic\n(Rugen).\n\n_Adductius_. Lit. with tighter rein, _with more absolute power_ cf. His.\n3, 7: adductius, quam civili bello, imperitabat. The adv. is used only in\nthe comp.; and the part. adductus is post-Augustan. _Jam_ and _nondum_\nboth have reference to the writer's progress in going over the tribes of\nGermany, those tribes growing less and less free as he advances eastward:\n_already_ under more subjection than the foregoing tribes, but _not yet_\nin such abject slavery, as some we shall soon reach, sc. in the next\nchapter, where see note on _jam_.\n\n_Supra_. So as to _trample down_ liberty and destroy it.\n\n_Protinus deinde ab_, etc. _Next in order, from the ocean_, i.e. with\nterritory beginning from or at the ocean.\n\n\nXLIV. _Suionum. Swedes_. Not mentioned under this name, however, by any\nother ancient author.\n\n_Ipso_. The Rugii, &c., mentioned at the close of the previous section,\ndwelt _by_ the ocean (_ab_ Oceano); but the _Suiones in_ the ocean (_in_\nOceano). _Ipso_ marks this antithesis.\n\n_In Oceano_. An island in the Baltic. Sweden was so regarded by the\nancients, cf. 1, note.\n\n_Utrimque prora. Naves biprorae_. Such also had the Veneti, Caes. B.G.\n3, 13. Such Germanicus constructed, His. 3, 47. So also the canoes of the\nN. Am. Indians.\n\n_Ministrantur_, sc. naves==_the ships are not furnished with sails_, cf.\nHis. 4, 12: _viros armaque ministrant_. Or it may be taken in the more\nliteral sense: are served, i.e. worked, mannged. Cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 302:\nvelisque ministrat.--_In ordinem. For a row_, i.e. so as to form a row,\ncf. Z. 314: also Rit. and D\u00c3\u00b6d. in loc. The northmen (Danes and Swedes)\nbecame afterwards still more famous for navigation and piratical\nexcursions, till at length they settled down in great numbers in France\nand England.\n\n_In quibusdam fluminum_. Rivers with steep banks require the oars to be\nremoved in order to approach the bank.\n\n_Est--honos_. Contrary to the usual fact in Germany, cf. 5.\n\n_Exceptionibus_. _Limitations_.--_Jam_. Now, i.e. _here_, opposed to the\n_foregoing_ accounts of _free states_ and _limited monarchies_.\n\n_Precario_. Properly: _obtained by entreaty_. Hence: _dependent on the\nwill of another_, cf. A. 16.--_Parendi_. A gerund with passive sense,\nlit. _with no precarious right of being obeyed_. So Pass., K., Wr. and\nG\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\n_In promiscuo_. The privilege of wearing arms is not conceded to the mass\nof the people.--_Et quidem_==et eo, _and that too_.\n\n_Otiosa--manus_. Al. _otiosae_ by conjecture. But _manus_, a collective\nnoun sing. takes a pl. verb, cf. H. 461, 1; Z. 366.\n\n_Regia utilitas est_==regibus utile est.\n\n\nXLV. _Pigrum_. Cf. A. 10: pigrum et grave. The Northern or Frozen Ocean,\nof which T. seems to have heard, though some refer it to the northern\npart of the Baltic. See Ky. in loc.\n\n_Hinc_. _For this reason_, viz. _quod extremus_, etc.\n\n_In ortus_. _Till the risings_ (pl.) _of the sun_, i.e. from day to day\nsuccessively. It was known in the age of T. that the longest day grew\nlonger towards the north, till at length it became six months (cf. Plin.\nN.H. 2, 77), though T. supposed it to be thus long at a lower latitude\nthan it really was, cf. A. 12.\n\n_Sonum--aspici_. The aurora borealis, some suppose.\n\n_Persuasio adjicit_. _The common belief adds_, i.e. _it is further\nbelieved_, cf. His. 5, 5. 13: persuasio inerat.\n\n_Illuc--natura_. _Tantum_ is to be connected with _illuc usque_. _Thus far\nonly nature extends_. So thought the ancients. Cf. A. 33: _in ipso\nterrarum ac naturae fine_. _Et vera fama_ is parenthetic.

So in Greek, _en_ and _eis_ often interchange.\n\n\n\nAGRICOLA.\n\n\nThe Biography of Agricola was written early in the reign of Trajan (which\ncommenced A.U.C. 851. A.D. 98), consequently about the same time with the\nGermania, though perhaps somewhat later (cf. notes on Germania). This\ndate is established by inference from the author's own language in the 3d\nand the 44th sections (see notes). In the former, he speaks of the dawn\nof a better day, which opened indeed with the reign of Nerva, but which\nis now brightening constantly under the auspices of Trajan. The use of\nthe past tense (_miscuerit_) here in respect to Nerva, and of the present\n(_augeat_) in respect to Trajan, is quite conclusive evidence, that at\nthe time of writing, the reign of Nerva was past, and that of Trajan had\nalready begun.\n\nThe other passage is, if possible, still more clearly demonstrative of\nthe same date. Here in drawing the same contrast between past tyranny and\npresent freedom, the author, without mentioning Nerva, records the desire\nand hope, which his father-in-law expressed in his hearing, that he might\nlive to see Trajan elevated to the imperial throne--language very proper\nand courtly, if Trajan were already Emperor, but a very awkward\ncompliment to Nerva, if, as many critics suppose, he were still the\nreigning prince.\n\nIt is objected to this date, that if Nerva were not still living, Tacitus\ncould not have failed to attach to his name (in \u00c2\u00a7 3.) the epithet\n_Divus_, with which deceased Emperors were usually honored. And from the\nomission of this epithet in connection with the name of _Nerva_, together\nwith the terms of honor in which _Trajan_ is mentioned, it is inferred\nthat the piece was written in that brief period of three months, which\nintervened between the adoption of Trajan by Nerva, and Nerva's death\n(see Brotier and many others). But the application of the epithet in\nquestion, was not a matter of necessity or of universal practice. Its\nomission in this case might have been accidental, or might have proceeded\nfrom unknown reasons. And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot\nbe entitled to much weight, in comparison with the obvious and almost\nnecessary import of the passages just cited.\n\nThe primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious. It was to honor\nthe memory of the writer's excellent father-in-law, Agricola (cf. \u00c2\u00a7 3:\nhonori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatus). So far from apologizing for\nwriting the life of so near a friend, he feels assured that his motives\nwill be appreciated and his design approved, however imperfect may be its\nexecution; and he deems an apology necessary for having so long delayed\nthe performance of that filial duty. After an introduction of singular\nbeauty and appropriateness (cf. notes), he sketches a brief outline of\nthe parentage, education, and early life of Agricola, but draws out more\nat length the history of his consulship and command in Britain, of which\nthe following summary, from Hume's History of England, may not be\nunprofitable to the student in anticipation: \"Agricola was the general,\nwho finally established the dominion of the Romans in this island. He\ngoverned it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. He carried\nhis victorious arms northward; defeated the Britons in every encounter,\npierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced every\nstate to subjection in the southern parts of the island, and chased\nbefore him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits, who\ndeemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude under the\nvictors. He defeated them in a decisive action which they fought under\nGalgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the friths of\nClyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island\nand secured the Roman province from the incursions of the more barbarous\ninhabitants. During these military enterprises, he neglected not the arts\nof peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britons; taught them\nto desire and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled them to the\nRoman language and manners; instructed them in letters and science; and\nemployed every expedient to render those chains which he had forged both\neasy and agreeable to them.\" (His. of Eng. vol. 1.)\n\nThe history of Agricola during this period is of course the history of\nBritain. Accordingly the author prefaces it with an outline of the\ngeographical features, the situation, soil, climate, productions and, so\nfar as known to the Romans, the past history of the island. Tacitus\npossessed peculiar advantages for being the historian of the early\nBritons. His father-in-law was the first to subject the whole island to\nthe sway of Rome. He traversed the country from south to north at the\nhead of his armies, explored it with his own eyes, and reported what he\nsaw to our author with his own lips. He saw the Britons too, in their\nnative nobleness, in their primitive love of liberty and virtue; before\nthey had become the slaves of Roman arms, the dupes of Roman arts, or the\nvictims of Roman vices. A few paragraphs in the concise and nervous style\nof Tacitus, have made us quite acquainted with the Britons, as Agricola\nfound them; and on the whole, we have no reason to be ashamed of the\nprimaeval inhabitants of the land of our ancestry. They knew their\nrights, they prized them, they fought for them bravely and died for them\nnobly. More harmony among themselves might have delayed, but could not\nhave prevented the final catastrophe. Rome in the age of Trajan was\nirresistible; and Britain became a Roman province. This portion of the\nAgricola of Tacitus, and the Germania of the same author, entitle him to\nthe peculiar affection and lasting gratitude of those, whose veins flow\nwith Briton and Anglo-Saxon blood, as the historian, and the contemporary\nhistorian too, of their early fathers. It is a notable providence for us,\nnay it is a kind providence for mankind, that has thus preserved from the\npen of the most sagacious and reflecting of all historians an account,\ntoo brief though it be, of the origin and antiquities of the people that\nof all others now exert the widest dominion whether in the political or\nthe moral world, and that have made those countries which were in his day\nshrouded in darkness, the radiant points for the moral and spiritual\nillumination of our race. \"The child is father to the man,\" and if we\nwould at this day investigate the elements of English law, we have it on\nthe authority of Sir William Blackstone, that we must trace them back to\ntheir founders in the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by\nCaesar and Tacitus.\n\nWith the retirement of Agricola from the command in Britain, the author\nfalls back more into the province of biography. The few occasional\nstrokes, however, in which the pencil of Tacitus has sketched the\ncharacter of Domitian in the background of the picture of Agricola are\nthe more to be prized, because his history of that reign is lost.\n\nIn narrating the closing scenes of Agricola's life, Tacitus breathes the\nvery spirit of an affectionate son, without sacrificing the impartiality\nand gravity of the historian, and combines all a mourner's simplicity and\nsincerity with all the orator's dignity and eloquence.\n\nHow tenderly he dwells on the wisdom and goodness of his departed father;\nhow artlessly he intersperses his own sympathies and regrets, even as if\nhe were breathing out his sorrows amid a circle of sympathizing friends!\nAt the same time, how instructive are his reflections, how noble his\nsentiments, and how weighty his words, as if he were pronouncing an\neulogium in the hearing of the world and of posterity! The sad experience\nof the writer in the very troubles through which he follows Agricola,\nconspires with the affectionate remembrance of his own loss in the death\nof such a father, to give a tinge of melancholy to the whole biography;\nand we should not know where to look for the composition, in which so\nperfect a work of art is animated by so warm a heart. In both these\nrespects, it is decidedly superior to the Germania. It is marked by the\nsame depth of thought and conciseness in diction, but it is a higher\neffort of the writer, while, at the same time, it gives us more insight\ninto the character of the man. It has less of satire and more of\nsentiment. Or if it is not richer in refined sentiments and beautiful\nreflections, they are interwoven with the narrative in a manner more easy\nand natural. The sentiments seem to be only the language of Agricola's\nvirtuous heart, and the reflections, we feel, could not fail to occur to\nsuch a mind in the contemplation of such a character. There is also more\nease and flow in the language; for concise as it still is and studied as\nit may appear, it seems to be the very style which is best suited to the\nsubject and most natural to the author. In another writer we might call\nit labored and ambitious. But we cannot feel that it cost Tacitus very\nmuch effort. Still less can we charge him with an attempt at display. In\nshort, an air of confidence in the dignity of the subject, and in the\npowers of the author, pervades the entire structure of this fine specimen\nof biography. And the reader will not deem that confidence ill-grounded.\nHe cannot fail to regard this, as among the noblest, if not the very\nnoblest monument ever reared to the memory of any individual.\n\n\"We find in it the flower of all the beauties, which T. has scattered\nthrough his other works. It is a chef-d'oeuvre, which satisfies at once\nthe judgment and the fancy, the imagination and the heart. It is justly\nproposed as a model of historical eulogy. The praises bestowed have in\nthem nothing vague or far-fetched, they rise from the simple facts of the\nnarrative. Every thing produces attachment, every thing conveys\ninstruction. The reader loves Agricola, admires him, conceives a passion\nfor him, accompanies him in his campaigns, shares in his disgrace and\nprofits by his example. The interest goes on growing to the last. And\nwhen it seems incapable of further increase, passages pathetic and\nsublime transport the soul out of itself, and leave it the power of\nfeeling only to detest the tyrant, and to melt into tenderness without\nweakness over the destiny of the hero.\" (La Bletterie.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI. _Usitatum_. A participle in the acc. agreeing with the preceding\nclause, and forming with that clause the object of the verb omisit.--\n_Nequidem_. Cf. G. 6, note.\n\n_Incuriosa suorum_. So Ann. 2, 88: dum vetera extollimus, recentium\nincuriosi. _Incuriosus_ is post-Augustan.\n\n_Virtus vicit--vitium_. Alliteration, which is not unfrequent in T. as\nalso homoeoteleuta, words ending with like sounds. Dr.\n\n_Ignorantiam--invidiam_. The gen. _recti_ limits both subs., which\nproperly denote different faults, but since they are usually associated,\nthey are here spoken of as one (_vitium_).\n\n_In aperto_. Literally, _in the open_ field or way; hence, _free from\nobstructions_. Sal. (Jug. 5) uses it for _in open_ day, or clear light.\nBut that sense would be inappropriate here. _Easy_. Not essentially\ndifferent from _pronum_, which properly means _inclined_, and hence\n_easy_. These two words are brought together in like manner in other\npassages of our author, cf. 33: vota virtusque _in aperto_, omniaque\n_prona_ victoribus. An inelegant imitation may be thus expressed in\nEnglish: down-hill and open-ground work.\n\n_Sine gratia aut ambitione. Without courting favor or seeking preferment.\nGratia_ properly refers more to the present, _ambitio_ to the future. Cf.\nAnn. 6, 46: Tiberio non perinde gratia praesentium, quam in posteros\nambitio. _Ambitio_ is here used in a bad sense (as it is sometimes in\nCic.) For still another bad sense of the word, cf. G. 27.\n\n_Celeberrimus quisque_. Such men as Pliny the elder, Claudius Pollio,\nand Julius Secundus, wrote biographies. Also Rusticus and Senecio. See\nchap. 2.\n\n_Plerique_. Not most persons, but _many_, or _very many_. Cf. His. 1, 86,\nand 4, 84, where it denotes a less number than _plures_ and _plurimi_, to\nwhich it is allied in its root (ple, ple-us, plus, plerus. See Freund ad\nv.)\n\n_Suam ipsi vitam. Autobiography_. Cic. in his Epist. to Lucceius says: If\nI cannot obtain this favor from you, I shall perhaps be compelled to\nwrite my own biography, _multorum exemplo et clarorum virorum_. When\n_ipse_ is joined to a possessive pronoun in a reflexive clause, it takes\nthe case of the subject of the clause. Cf. Z. 696, Note; H. 452, 1.\n\n_Fiduciam morum_. _A mark of conscious integrity_; literally confidence\nof, i.e. in their morals. _Morum_ is objective gen. For the two\naccusatives (one of which however is the clause _suam--narrare_) after\n_arbitrati sunt_, see Z. 394; H. 373. A gen. may take the place of the\nlatter acc., _esse_ being understood, Z. 448.\n\n_Rutilio_. Rutilius Rufus, consul A.U.C. 649, whom Cic. (Brut. 30, 114.)\nnames as a profound scholar in Greek literature and philosophy, and\nVelleius (2, 13, 2.) calls the best man, not merely of his own, but of\nany age. He wrote a Roman history in Greek. Plut. Mar. 28. His\nautobiography is mentioned only by Tacitus.\n\n_Scauro_. M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul A.U.C. 639, who wrote an\nautobiography, which Cic. (Brut. 29, 112.) compares favorably with the\nCyropaedia of Xenophon.\n\n_Citra fidem_. Cf. note G. 16.--_Aut obtrectationi_. Enallage, cf. note,\nG. 15. Render: _This in the case of Rutilius and Scaurus did not impair_\n(public) _confidence or incur_ (public) _censure_.\n\n_Adeo_. _To such a degree_, or _so true it is_. _Adeo_ conclusiva, et in\ninitio sententiae collocata, ad _mediam_ latinitatem pertinet. Dr. Livy\nuses _adeo_ in this way often; Cic. uses _tantum_.\n\n_At nunc_, etc. _But now_ (in our age so different from those better\ndays) _in undertaking to write_ (i.e. if I had undertaken to write) _the\nlife of a man at the time of his death, I should have needed permission;\nwhich I would not have asked_, since in that case _I should have fallen\non times so cruel and hostile to virtue_. The reference is particularly\nto the time of Domitian, whose jealousy perhaps occasioned the death of\nAgricola, and would have been offended by the very asking of permission\nto write his biography. Accordingly the historian proceeds in the next\nchapter to illustrate the treatment, which the biographers of eminent men\nmet with from that cruel tyrant. _Opus fuit_ stands instead of _opus\nfuisset_. Cf. His. 1, 16: _dignus eram_; 3, 22: _ratio fuit_; and Z. 518,\n519. The concise mode of using the future participles _narraturo_ and\n_incursaturus_ (in place of the verb in the proper mood and with the\nproper conjunctions, if, when, since) belongs to the silver age, and is\nforeign to the language of Cicero. Such is the interpretation, which\nafter a thorough reinvestigation, I am now inclined to apply to this much\ndisputed passage. It is that of Ritter. It will be seen that the text\nalso differs slightly from that of the first edition (_in-cursaturus_\ninstead of _ni cursaturus_). Besides the authority of Rit., D\u00c3\u00b6d., Freund\nand others, I have been influenced by a regard to the usage of Tacitus,\nwhich lends no sanction to a transitive sense of _cursare_. Cf. Ann. 15,\n50; His. 5, 20. In many editions, _mihi_ stands before _nunc narraturo_.\nBut _nunc_ is the emphatic word, and should stand first, as it does in\nthe best MSS.\n\n\nII. _Legimus_. Quis? Tacitus ejusdemque aetatis homines alii. Ubi? In\nactis diurnis. Wr. These _journals_ (Fiske's Man. p. 626., 4. ed.)\npublished such events (cf. Dio. 67, 11), and were read through the empire\n(Ann. 16, 22). T. was absent from Rome when the events here referred to\ntook place (cf. 45: longae absentiae). Hence the propriety of his saying\n_legimus_, rather than _vidimus_ or _meminimus_, which have been proposed\nas corrections.\n\n_Aruleno Rustico_. Put to death by Domitian for writing a memoir or\npenegyric on Paetus Thrasea, cf. Suet. Dom. 10.\n\n_Paetus Thrasea_. Cf. Ann. 16, 21: Trucidatis tot insignibus viris, ad\npostremum Nero _virtutem ipsam_ exscindere concupivit, interfecto Thrasea\nPaeto.\n\n_Herennio Senecioni_. Cf. Plin. (Epist. 7, 19), where Senecio is said to\nhave written the life of Helvidius at the request of Fannia, wife of\nHelvidius, who was also banished, as accessory to the crime, but who bore\ninto exile the very books which had been the cause of her exile. For the\ndat. cf. note, G. 3: _Ulixi_.\n\n_Priscus Helvidius_, son-in-law of Thrasea and friend of the younger\nPliny, was put to death by Vespasian. Suet. Vesp. 15; His. 4, 5; Juv.\nSat. 5, 36.\n\n_Laudati essent_. The imp. and plup. subj. are used in narration after\n_cum_, even when it denotes time merely. Here however a causal connection\nis also intended. H. 518, II.; Z. 577, 578.\n\n_Triumviris_. The Triumviri at Rome, like the Undecimviri (_oi endeka_)\nat Athens, had charge of the prisons and executions, for which purpose\nthey had eight lictors at their command.\n\n_Comitio ac foro_. The comitium was a _part_ of the forum. Yet the words\nare often used together (cf. Suet. Caes. 10). The _comitium_ was the\nproper place for the punishment of criminals, and the word _forum_\nsuggests the further idea of the publicity of the book-burning in the\npresence of the assembled people.\n\n_Conscientiam_, etc. _The consciousness_, i.e. _common knowledge of\nmankind_; for _conscientia_ denotes what one knows in common with others,\nas well as what he is conscious of in himself. Cf. His. 1, 25:\n_conscientiam facinoris_; Cic. Cat. 1. 1: _omnium horum conscientia_. In\nhis Annals (4, 35), T. ridicules the stupidity of those who expect by any\n_present_ power, to extinguish the memory also of the _next_ generation.\nThe sentiment of both passages is just and fine.\n\n_Sapientiae professoribus. Philosophers_, who were banished by Domitian,\nA.D. 94, on the occasion of Rusticus's panegyric on Thrasea. T. not\nunfrequently introduces an _additional circumstance_ by the abl. abs., as\nhere.\n\n_Ne occurreret. Ne_ with the subj. expresses a negative intention; _ut\nnon_ a negative result. H. 490; Z. 532.\n\n_Inquisitiones. A system of espionage_, sc. by the Emperor's tools and\ninformers.--_Et_==etiam, _even_. Cf. note, 11. Al. _etiam_.\n\n_Memoriam--perdidissemus_, i.e. we should not have _dared_ to remember, if\nwe could have helped it.\n\nIII. _Et quanquam. Et_ pro _sed_. So Dr. But _nunc demum animus redit_\nimplies, that confidence is hardly restored yet; and the reason for so\nslow a recovery is given in the following clause. Hence _et_ is used in\nits proper copulative or explicative sense. So Wr. _Demum_ is a\nlengthened form of the demonstrative _dem_. Cf. i-_dem_, tan-_dem_,\n_dae_. _Nunc demum_==_nun dae_. Freund.\n\n_Primo statim. Statim_ gives emphasis: _at the very commencement_, etc.;\ncf. note, 20.--_Dissociabiles, incompatible_.\n\n_Augeatque--Trajanus_. This marks the date of the composition early in\nthe reign of Trajan, cf. G. 37; also p. 139 supra.\n\n_Securitas publica. \"And public security has assumed not only hopes and\nwishes, but has seen those wishes arise to confidence and, stability.\nSecuritas publica_ was a current expression and wish, and was frequently\ninscribed on medals.\" Ky.\n\n_Assumpserit_. This word properly belongs only to _fiduciam ac robur.\nSpem ac votum_ would require rather _conceperit_. Zeugma.\n\n_Subit_. _Steals in_, lit. creeps under. Cf. note, H. 1, 13.\n\n_Invisa primo--amatur_. The original perhaps of Pope's lines Vice is a\nmonster, &c.\n\n_Quindecim annos_. The reign of Domitian from A.D. 81, to A.D. 96.\n\n_Fortuitis casibus_. Natural and ordinary death, as opposed to death by\nviolence, _saevitia principis_.--_Promptissimus quisque. The ablest, or\nall the ablest_. _Quisque_ with a superlative, whether singular or\nplural, is in general equivalent to _omnes_ with the positive, with the\nadditional idea however of a reciprocal comparison among the persons\ndenoted by _quisque_, Z. 710, 6.\n\n_Ut ita dixerim_. An apology for the strong expression _nostri\nsuperstites: survivors not of others only, but so to speak, of ourselves\nalso_; for we can hardly be said to have _lived_ under the tyranny of\nDom., and our present happy life is, as it were, a renewed existence,\nafter being buried for fifteen years. A beautiful conception! The use of\n_dixerim_ in preference to _dicam_ in this formula is characteristic of\nthe later Latin. Cf. Z. 528. The _et_ before this clause is omitted by\nsome editors. But it is susceptible of an explanation, which adds spirit\nto the passage: A few of us survive, _and that_ not merely ourselves, but\nso to speak, others also. In the Augustan age _superstes_ was, for the\nmost part, followed by the dative.\n\n_Tamen_. Notwithstanding the unfavorable circumstances in which I write,\nafter so long a period of deathlike silence, in winch we have almost lost\nthe gift of speech, _yet_ I shall not regret to have composed _even in\nrude and inelegant language_, etc. For the construction of _pigebit_, cf.\nZ. 441, and H. 410, 6.\n\n_Memoriam--composuisse_. Supposed to refer to his forthcoming history,\nwritten, or planned and announced, but not yet published. Some understand\nit of the present treatise. But then _interim_ would have no meaning; nor\nindeed is the language applicable to his _Agricola_.\n\n_Interim_, sc. _editus_ or vulgatus, _published meanwhile_, i.e. while\npreparing the history.\n\nThe reader cannot but be struck with the beauty of this introduction. It\nis modest, and at the same time replete with the dignity of conscious\nworth. It is drawn out to considerable length, yet it is all so pertinent\nand tasteful, that we would not spare a sentence or a word. With all the\nthoughtful and sententious brevity of the exordiums of Sallust, it has\nfar more of natural ease and the beauty of appropriateness.\n\n\nIV. _Cnaeus Julius Agricola_. Every Roman had at least three names: the\nnomen or name of the gens, which always ended in _ius_ (Julius); the\npraenomen or individual name ending in _us_ (Cnaeus); and the cognomen or\nfamily name (Agricola). See a brief account of A. in Dion Cassius 66, 20.\nMentioned only by Dion and T. Al. Gnaeus, C. and G. being originally\nidentical.\n\n_Forojuliensium colonia_. Now _Frejus_. A walled town of Gallia\nNarbonensis, built by Julius Caesar, and used as a _naval station_ by\nAugustus (cf. His. 3, 43: _claustra maris_). Augustus sent thither the\nbeaked ships captured in the battle of Actium, Ann. 4, 5. Hence perhaps\ncalled _illustris_.\n\n_Procuratorem Caesarum_. Collector of imperial revenues in the Roman\nProvinces.\n\n_Quae equestris--est_, i.e. the procurator was, as we say, ex officio, a\nRoman knight. The office was not conferred on senators.\n\n_Julius Graecinus_. Cf. Sen. de Benef. 2, 21: Si exemplo magni animi opus\nest, utemur _Graecini Julii_, viri egregii, quem C. Caesar occidit ob hoc\nunum, quod melior vir esset, quam esse quemquam tyranno expediret.\n\n_Senatorii ordinis_. Pred. after _fuit_ understood, with ellipsis of\n_vir_. H. 402, III.; Z. 426.\n\n_Sapientiae. Philosophy_, cf. 1.--_Caii Caesaris_. Known in English\nhistories by the name of Caligula.\n\n_Marcum Silanum_. Father-in-law of Caligula, cf. Suet. Calig. 23: Silanum\nitem _socerum_ ad necem, secandasque novacula fauces compulit.\n\n_Jussus_. Supply _est_. T. often omits _est_ in the first of two passive\nverbs, cf. 9: detentus ac statim ... revocatus est. In Hand's Tursellinus\n(2, 474) however, jussus is explained as a participle, and _quia\nabnuerat_ as equivalent to another participle==_having been commanded\nand having refused_.\n\n_Abnuerat_, lit. _had_ refused, because the refusal was prior to the\nslaying. We, with less accuracy, say _refused_. Z. 505.\n\n_Rarae castitatis_. Ellipsis of _mulier_. H. 402, III.; Z. 426.\n\n_In--indulgentiaque. Brought up in her bosom and tender love. Indulgentia_\nis more frequently used to denote excessive tenderness.\n\n_Arcebat_ has for its subject the clause, _quod statim_, etc. He was\nguarded against the allurements of vice by the wholesome influences\nthrown around him in the place of his early education.\n\n_Massiliam_. Now Marseilles. It was settled by a colony of Phocaeans.\nHence _Graeca comitate_. Cf also Cicero's account of the high culture and\nrefinement of Massilia (Cic. pro Flacco, 26).--_Provinciali parsimonia.\nParsimonia_ in a good sense; _economy_, as opposed to the luxury and\nextravagance of Italy and the City.\n\n_Locum--mixtum_. Enallage for _locus_, in quo mixta erant, etc. H. 704,\nIII., cf. 25: mixti copiis et laetitia.--_Bene compositum_ denotes _a\nhappy combination_ of the elements, of which _mixtum_ expresses only the\n_co-existence_.\n\n_Acrius_, sc. aequo==too eagerly. H. 444, 1, and Z. 104, 1. note.\n\n_Concessum--senatori_. Military and civil studies were deemed more\nappropriate to noble Roman youth, than literature and philosophy.\n_Senatori_ must of course refer, not to the office of A., but to his rank\nby birth, cf. _senatorii ordinis_ above.\n\n_Hausisse, ni--coercuisset_. An analysis of this sentence shows, that\nthere is an ellipsis of _hausurum_ fuisse: _he imbibed_, and would have\ncontinued to imbibe, _had not_, &c. In such sentences, which abound in T.\nbut are rarely found in Cic., _ni_ is more readily translated by _but_.\nCf. Z. 519. _b_; and note, His. 3, 28. For the application of _haurire_\nto the eager study of philosophy, cf. Hor. Sat. 2, 4, 95: _haurire vitae\npraecepta beatae_, and note, His. 1, 51: _hauserunt animo_.\n\n_Prudentia matris_. So Nero's mother deterred him from the study of\nphilosophy. Suet. Ner. 52.\n\n_Pulchritudinem ac speciem. The beautiful image_, or beau ideal, by\nhendiadys. Cf. Cic. Or. 2: _species pulchritudinis_. See Rit. in loc.\n\n_Vehementius quam caute_. For _vehementius quam cautius_, which is the\nregular Latin construction. T. uses both. Cf. Z. 690, and note, His. 1,\n83.\n\n_Mox_. In T. subsequently, not presently. R.\n\n_Retinuitque--modum. And, what is most difficult, he retained from\nphilosophy moderation_--moderation in all things, but especially in\ndevotion to philosophy itself, where moderation is difficult in\nproportion to the excellence of the pursuit, as was shown by the\nextravagance of the Stoics and some other Grecian sects. As to the sense\nof _modum_, cf. Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106: _est modus in rebus_; and for the\nsentiment, Hor. Ep. 1, 6, 15: _Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,\nultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam_.\n\n\nV. _Castrorum_. This word is used to express whatever pertains to\nmilitary life, education, &c., as the context may require. Every Roman\nyouth who aspired to civil office, must have a military education.\n\n_Diligenti ac moderato. Careful and prudent_, cf. our author's character\nof the same commander, His. 2, 25: _cunctator natura_, etc.\n\n_Approbavit_==fecit, ut ei probarentur. Dr. It is a constructio\npraegnans. He obtained the first rudiments of a military education under\nPaullinus, and he gained his approbation.\n\n_Electus--aestimaret. Having been chosen as one whom he would estimate_\n(i.e. test his merit) _by tenting together_, i.e. by making him his\ncompanion and aid. Young men of rank and promise were thus associated\nwith Roman commanders. Cf. Suet., Caes. 2. T., as usual, avoids the\ntechnical way of expressing the relation. Ad verbum, _contubernium_, cf.\nnote, His. 1, 43. Others make _aestimaret==dignum aestimaret_, and\n_contubernio_ abl. of price. Cf. D\u00c3\u00b6d. and Dr.\n\n_Licenter--segniter_, sc. agens. _Licenter_ refers to _voluptates,\nsegniter_ to _commeatus.--Commeatus==furloughs, absence from duty.--\nInscitiam_, sc. tribunatus==_ignorance of his official duty or\ninexperience in war.--Retulit. Referre ad_ is used very much like the\ncorresponding English, viz. to _refer to_ an object, or devote to an end.\nSense: _He did not take advantage of his official standing and his\nmilitary inexperience, to give up his time to ease and pleasure_. Wr.\ntakes _retulit_ in the more ordinary sense of brought back, thus: A. did\nnot bring back (to Rome) the empty name of Tribune and no military\nexperience, there to give himself up to leisure and pleasure. The former\nversion accords better with the language of the whole passage. Wr.\nquestions the authority for such a use of _referre_. But it may be found,\ne.g. Plin. Epist. 1, 22: nihil _ad_ ostentationem, omnia _ad_\nconscientiam _refert_.\n\n_Noscere--nosci_, etc. T. is fond of such a series of inf. depending on\nsome _one_ finite verb understood, and hence closely connected with each\nother, cf. G. 30: _praeponere_, etc. _note_. Here supply from _retulit_\nin the preceding number the idea: _he made it his business or aim to\nknow_, etc. The author's fondness for antithesis is very observable in\nthe several successive pairs here: _noscere--nosci; discere--sequi;\nappetere--recusare; anxius--intentus_.\n\n_In jactationem_. Al. jactatione. _In_ denoting the object or purpose, Z.\n314: _he coveted no appointment for the sake of display; he declined none\nthrough fear_.\n\n_Anxius_ and _intentus_ qualify _agere_ like adverbs cf. R. Exc. 23, 1.\n_He conducted himself both with prudence and with energy_.\n\n_Exercitatior_==agitatior. So Cic. Som. Scip. 4: agitatus et exercitatus\nanimus; and Hor. Epod. 9, 31: Syrtes Noto exercitatas.\n\n_Incensae coloniae_. Camalodunum, Londinium and Verulamium. Cf. Ann. 14,\n33, where however the historian does not expressly say, the last two were\n_burned_.\n\n_In ambiguo_==ambigua, in a critical state. R.\n\n_Alterius_, sc. ducis.--_Artem et usum_. Military _science and\nexperience_.\n\n_Summa ... cessit. The general management_ (cf. notes, H. 1, 87. 2, 16.\n33) _and the glory of recovering the province went to the general_ (to\nhis credit). The primary meaning of _cedere_ is _to go_. See Freund sub\nv.--_Juveni_, sc. A.\n\n_Tum_, sc. while veterani trucidarentur, etc.--_Mox_, sc. when Paullinus\nand A. came to the rescue.\n\n_Nec minus_, etc. A remark worthy of notice and too often true.\n\n\nVI. _Magistratus_. The regular _course_ of offices and honors at Rome.\n\n_Per--anteponendo_. Enallage, cf. G. 15, note. _Per_ here denotes manner,\nrather than means (cf. _per lamenta_, 28); and _anteponendo_\nlikewise==anteponentes. R. Render: _mutually loving and preferring one\nanother.--Nisi quod==but_. Cf. _ni_, 4. There is an ellipsis before _nisi\nquod_, which R. would supply thus: greatly to the credit of both parties\n--_but more praise belongs to the good wife_, etc. _Major_ sc. quam in\nbono viro. So, after _plus_ supply quam in malo viro: _But more praise\nbelongs to a good wife_, than to a good husband, _by as much as more\nblame attaches to a bad wife_, than to a bad husband.\n\n_Sors quaesturae_. The Quaestors drew _lots_ for their respective\nprovinces. Their number increased with the increase of the empire, till\nfrom two they became twenty or more. As at first a Quaestor accompanied\neach Consul at the head of an army, so afterwards each Proconsul, or\nGovernor of a province, had his Quaestor to collect and disburse the\nrevenues of the province. The Quaestorship was the first in the course of\nRoman honors. It might be entered upon at the age of twenty-four.\n\n_Salvium Titianum_. Brother of the Emperor Otho. See His. B. 1 and 2.\npass. For the office of Proconsul, &c., see note, His. 1, 49.\n\n_Parata peccantibus. Ready for wicked_ rulers, i.e. affording great\nfacilities for extortion in its corrupt and servile population. _Paratus_\nWith a dat. of the thing, for which there is a preparation, is peculiar\nto poetry and post-Augustan prose. Cf. Freund ad v. Ad rem. cf. Cic.\nEpist. ad Quint. 1, 1, 6: tam corruptrice provincia, sc. Asia; and pro\nMur. 9.\n\n_Quantalibet facilitate_. Any indulgence (license) however great.\n\n_Redempturus esset_. Subj. in the apodosis answering to a protasis\nunderstood, sc. if A. would have entered into the plot. Cf. H. 502.\nObserve the use of _esset_ rather than _fuisset_ to denote what the\nproconsul would have been ready to do _at any time_ during their\n_continuance_ in office. Cf. Wr. in loc.\n\n_Dissimulationem_. Concealment (of what is true); simulatio, on the\nother hand, is an allegation of what is false.\n\n_Auctus est filia_. So Cic. ad Att. 1, 2: filiolo me auctum scito.\n\n_Ante sublatum. Previously born_. For this use of _sublatum_, see\nLexicon.--Brevi amisit, he lost shortly after_; though R. takes _amisit_\nas perf. for plup. and renders lost a short time before.\n\n_Mox inter_, etc., sc. _annum_ inter, supplied from _etiam ipsum ...\nannum_ below.\n\n_Tenor et silentium_. Hendiadys for continuum silentium, or tenorem\nsilentem. R.\n\n_Jurisdictio. For the administration of justice in private cases had not\nfallen to his lot_. Only two of the twelve or fifteen Praetors, viz. the\nPraetor Urbanus (see note H. 1, 47) and the Praetor Peregrinus (who\njudged between foreigners and citizens) were said to exercise\n_jurisdictio_. The adjudication of criminal causes was called _quaestio_,\nwhich was now for the most part in the hands of the senate (Ann. 4, 6),\nfrom whom it might be transferred by appeal to the Praefect of the City\nor the Emperor himself. The Praetors received the _jurisdictio_ or the\n_quaestio_ by lot; and in case the former did not fall to them, the\noffice was almost a sinecure; except that they continued to preside over\nthe public games. See further, on the name and office of Praetor, His. 1,\n47, note. For the plup. in _obvenerat_, see note, 4: _abnuerat_.\n\n_Et_==et omnino. _The games and in general the pageantry of office\n(inania honoris)_ expected of the Praetor. Observe the use of the neuter\nplural of the adj. for the subst., of which, especially before a gen., T.\nis peculiarly fond.\n\n_Medio rationis_. The text is doubtful. The MSS. vacillate between _medio\nratinois_ and _modo rationis_; and the recent editions, for the most\npart, follow a third but wholly conjectural reading, viz. _moderationis_.\nThe sense is the same with either reading: _He conducted the games and\nthe empty pageantry of office in a happy mean_ (partaking at once) _of\nprudence and plenty_. See Freund ad _duco_.\n\n_Uti--propior. As far from luxury, so_ (in the same proportion) _nearer to\nglory_, i.e. the farther from luxury, the nearer to glory. Cf. Freund ad\n_uti_.\n\n_Longe--propior_. Enallage of the adv. and adj. ef. G. 18: _extra_.\n\n_Ne sensisset. Would not have felt_, etc., i.e. he recovered all the\nplundered offerings of the temple, but those which had been\nsacrilegiously taken away by _Nero_ for the supply of his vicious\npleasures. This explanation supposes a protasis understood, or rather\nimplied in _quam Neronis_. (Cf H. 503, 2. 2). The plup. subj. admits\nperhaps of another explanation, the subj. denoting the end with a view to\nwhich _Agricola labored_ (H. 531; Z. 549), and the plup. covering all the\npast down to the time of his labors: he labored that the republic might\nnot have experienced, and _he_ virtually _effected that it had not\nexperienced_, since he restored everything to its former state, the\nplunder of Nero alone excepted. See Wr. and Or. in loc. Perhaps this\nwould not be an unexampled _praegnantia_ for Tacitus. For _sentire_ in\nthe sense of _experiencing_ especially _evil_, see Hor. Od. 2, 7, 10, and\nother examples in Freund sub v.\n\n\nVII. _Classis Othoniana_. Ad rem. cf. His. 2, 12, seqq.--_Licenter vaga.\nRoaming in quest of plunder.--Intemelios_, Cf. note, 2, 13.--_In\npraediis suis. On her own estates. Praedia_ includes both lands and\nbuildings.\n\n_Ad solemnia pietatis. To perform the last offices of filial affection_.\n\n_Nuntio deprehensus_. Supply _est_, cf. 4: jussus. _Was overtaken\nunexpectedly by the news of Vespasian's claim (nomination) to the\nthrone.--Affectati_. Cf. note, G. 28.--_In partes_, to his (Vesp.)\n_party_.\n\n_Principatus_, sc. Vespasiani.--_Mucianus regebat_. Vesp. was detained in\nEgypt for some time after his troops had entered Rome under Mucianus;\nmeanwhile Mucianus exercised all the imperial power, cf. His. 4, 11. 39:\nvis penes Mucianum erat.\n\n_Juvene--usurpante_. Dom. was now eighteen years old, cf. His. 4, 2:\nnondum ad curas intentus, sed _stupris et adulteriis filium principis\nagebat_.\n\n_Is_, sc. Mucianus.--_Vicesimae legioni_. One of three legions, at that\ntime stationed in _Britain_, which submitted to the government of Vesp.\n_tarde_ and _non sine motu_ (His. 3, 44).\n\n_Decessor. Predecessor_. It was Roscius Coelius. His. 1, 60.\n\n_Legatis--consularibus. Governors_ or Proconsuls. The provinces were\ngoverned by men who had been consuls (_consulares_), and as _legatus_\nmeant any commissioned officer, these were distinguished as _legati\nconsulares_. With reference to this consular authority, the same were\ncalled _proconsules_. Cf. note, H. 1, 49. Trebellius Maximus and Vettius\nBolanus are here intended. Cf. 16. and His. 1, 60. 2, 65. _Nimia_==justo\npotentior. Dr.\n\n_Legatus praetorius==legatus legionis, commander of the legion_. Cf.\nnote, His. 1, 7. Here the same person as _decessor_.\n\n_Invenisse quam fecisse_, etc., involves a maxim of policy worth noting.\n\n\nVIII. _Placidius. With less energy_. See more of Bolanus at close of 16.\n\n_Dignum est_. A general remark, applicable to any such province. Hence\nthe present, for which some would substitute _erat_ or _esset_.\n\n_Ne incresceret_, sc. ipse: _lest he should become too great_, i.e. rise\nabove his superior and so excite his jealousy. Referred by W. to\n_ardorem_ for its subject. But then _ne incresceret_ would be\nsuperfluous.\n\n_Consularem_, sc. Legatum==Governor, cf. 7, note.\n\n_Petilius Cerialis_. Cf. 17. Ann. 14, 32. His. 4, 68.\n\n_Habuerunt--exemplorum. Had room for exertion_ and so for _setting a good\nexample_, cf. Ann. 13, 8: videbaturque locus virtutibus patefactus. The\nposition of _habuerunt_ is emphatic, as if he had said: _then had\nvirtues_, etc. See Rit. in loc.\n\n_Communicabat_, sc. cum A.--_Ex eventu_, from _the event_, i.e. _in\nconsequence of his success_.\n\n_In suam famam_. Cf. in jactationem, 5, note.\n\n_Extra gloriam_ is sometimes put for _sine gloria_, especially by the\nlate writers. His. 1, 49: _extra vitia_. Hand's Turs. 2, 679.\n\n\nIX. _Revertentem_, etc. Returning from his command in Britain.--_Divus_.\nCf. notes, G. 28; His. 2, 33.\n\n_Vesp.--ascivit_. By virtue of his office as Censor, the Emperor claimed\nthe right of elevating and degrading the rank of the citizens. Inasmuch\nas the families of the aristocracy always incline to run out and become\nextinct, there was a necessity for an occasional re-supply of the\npatrician from the plebeian ranks, e.g. by Julius Caesar, Augustus and\nClaudius (Ann. 11, 25), as well as by Vespasian (Aur. Vic. Caes. 9. Suet.\n9.)--_Provinciae--praeposuit_. Aquitania was one of seven provinces, into\nwhich Augustus distributed Gaul, and which with the exception of Narbonne\nGaul, were all subject to the immediate disposal and control of the\nEmperor himself. It was the south-western part of Gaul, being enclosed by\nthe Rhone, the Loire, the Pyrenees and the Atlantic.\n\n_Splendidae--destinarat. A province of the first importance both in its\ngovernment_ (in itself considered), _and the prospect of the consulship,\nto which he_ (Vesp.) _had destined him_ (A.), sc. as soon as his office\nshould have expired.\n\n_Subtilitatem_==calliditatem, nice discernment, _discrimination_.--\n_Exerceat_, Observe the subj. to express the views of others, not of the\nauthor. H. 531; Z. 511.\n\n_Secura--agens. _Requiring less anxious thought and mental acumen_, and\n_proceeding more by physical force. Secura_==minus anxia. Dr. Cf. note,\nHis. 1, 1. _Obtusior_==minus acuta.\n\n_Togatos. Civilians_ in distinction from military men, like A. The _toga_\nwas the dress of civil life to some extent in the _provinces_ (cf. 21,\nHis. 2, 20), though originally worn only in _Rome_. (Beck. Gall., Exc.\nSc. 8.)\n\n_Remissionumque_. The Greeks and Romans both used the pl. of many\nabstracts, of which we use only the sing. For examples see R. Exc. 4. For\nthe principle cf. Z. 92.\n\n_Curarum--divisi_. This clause means not merely, that his time was\ndivided between business and relaxation; but that there was a broad\nline of demarcation between them, as he proceeds to explain.\n_Divisa_==diversa inter se. Dr. So Virg. Georg. 2, 116: divisae\narboribus patriae==countries are _distinguished from_ each other by\ntheir trees. _Jam vero_. Cf. note, G. 14.\n\n_Conventus_, sc. juridici==_courts_. The word designates also the\ndistricts in which the courts were held, and into which each province was\ndivided. Cf. Smith's Dict. of Ant.: Conventus. So Pliny (N.H. 3; 3.)\nspeaks of juridici conventus. Tacitus, as usual, avoids the technical\ndesignation.\n\n_Ultra_. Adv. for adj., cf. _longe_, 6.--_Persona_. 1. A mask (_per_ and\n_sono_). 2. Outward show, as here.\n\n_Tristitiam--exuerat_. Some connect this clause by zeugma with the\nforegoing. But with a misapprehension of the meaning of exuerat,\nwhich==_was entirely free from_; lit. had divested himself of. Thus\nunderstood, the clause is a _general_ remark touching the character of\nA., in implied contrast with other men or magistrates with whom those\nvices were so common. So in Ann. 6, 25, Agrippina is said to have\ndivested herself of vices (_vitia exuerat_) which were common among\nwomen, but which never attached to her. _Facilitas_. Opposed to\n_severitas_==kindness, indulgence.\n\n_Abstinentiam_. This word, though sometimes denoting temperance in food\nand drink, more properly refers to the desire and use of money.\n_Abstinentia_ is opposed to _avarice; continentia_ to _sensual pleasure_.\nCf. Plin. Epis. 6, 8: alieni abstinentissimus. Here render honesty,\nintegrity.\n\n_Cui--indulgent_. See the same sentiment, His. 4, 6: quando etiam\nsapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur.\n\n_Ostentanda--artem_, cf. 6: _per--anteponendo_; also G. 15, note.\n\n_Collegas_. The governors of other provinces. The word means _chosen\ntogether_; hence either those chosen at the same election or those chosen\nto the same office. Cf. H. 1, 10.\n\n_Procuratores_. There was but one at a time in each province. There may\nhave been several however in succession, while A. was Proconsul. Or we\nmay understand both this clause and the preceding, not of his government\nin Aquitania in particular, but as a general fact in the life of A. So E.\nFor the office, see note, 4; and for an instance of a quarrel between the\nProconsul and the Procurator, Ann. 14, 38.\n\n_Atteri_==vinci as the antithesis shows, though with more of the\nimplication of dignity _impaired_ (worn off) by conflict with inferiors.\n\n_Minus triennium. Quam_ omitted. See H. 417, 3; Z. 485.\n\n_Comitante opinione. A general expectation attending him_, as it were, on\nhis return.\n\n_Nullis sermonibus_. Ablative of _cause_.\n\n_Elegit_. Perf. to denote what _has in fact_ taken place.\n\n\nX. _In comparationem_. Cf. in suam famam, 8, note.\n\n_Perdomita est. Completely subdued_.\n\n_Rerum fide==faithfully and truly_; lit. with fidelity to facts.\n\n_Britannia_. It has generally been supposed (though Gesenius denies it in\nhis Phenician Paloeography) that Britain was known to the Phenicians,\nthose bold navigators and enterprising merchants of antiquity, under the\nname of the _Cassiterides_, or Tin Islands. Greek authors make early\nmention of Albion (plural of Alp?) and Ierne (Erin) as British Islands.\nBochart derives the name (Britain) from the Phenician or Hebrew\nBaratanae, \"the Land of Tin;\" others from the Gallic _Britti_, Painted,\nin allusion to the custom among the inhabitants of painting their bodies.\nBut according to the Welsh Triads, Britain derived its name from Prydain,\na king, who early reigned in the island. Cf. Turner's His. Ang. Sax. 1,\n2, seqq. The geographical description, which follows, cannot be\nexonerated from the charge of verbiage and grandiloquence. T. wanted the\nart of saying a plain thing plainly.\n\n_Spatio ac coelo_. Brit. not only stretches out or lies over against\nthese several countries in _situation_, but it approaches them also in\n_climate_: a circumstance which illustrates the great size of the island\n(cf. _maxima_, above) and prepares the way for the description of both\nbelow.\n\n_Germaniae_ and _Hispaniae_ are dat. after _obtenditur_. The mistaken\nnotion of the relative position of Spain and Britain is shared with T. by\nCaesar (B.G. 13), Dion (39, 50), and indeed by the ancients in general.\nIt is so represented in maps as late as Richard of Cirencester. Cf.\nPrichard, III. 3, 9.\n\n_Etiam inspicitur_. It is even _seen_ by the Gauls, implying nearer\napproach to Gaul, than to Germany or Spain.\n\n_Nullis terris_. Abl. abs., _contra_ taking the place of the part., or\nrather limiting a part. understood.\n\n_Livius_. In his 105th Book; now lost, except in the Epitome.\n\n_Fabius Rusticus_. A friend of Seneca, and writer of history in the age\nof Claudius and Nero.\n\n_Oblongae scutulae_. Geometrically a trapezium.\n\n_Et est ea facies. And such is the form, exclusive of Caledonia, whence\nthe account has been extended also to the whole Island_.\n\n_Sed--tenuatur. But a vast and irregular extent of lands jutting out\nhere (jam_, cf. note, G. 44) _on this remotest shore_ (i.e. widening\nout again where they seemed already to have come to an end), _is\nnarrowed down as it were into a wedge_. The author likens Caledonia to\na wedge with its apex at the Friths of Clyde and Forth, and its base\nwidening out on either side into the ocean beyond. _Enormis_ is a\npost-Augustan word. _Novissimi_==extreme, remotest. G. 24, note.\n\n_Affirmavit. Established_ the fact, hitherto supposed, but not fully\nascertained. This was done in Agricola's last campaign in Britain,\ncf. 38.\n\n_Orcadas_. The Orkneys. Their name occurs earlier than this, but they\nwere little known.\n\n_Dispecta est. Was seen_ through the mist, as it were; discovered in the\ndistance and obscurity. Cf. note, H. 4, 55: dispecturas Gallias, etc.\n\n_Thule_. Al. Thyle. What island T. meant, is uncertain. It has been\nreferred by different critics, to the Shetland, the Hebrides, and even to\nIceland. The account of the island, like that of the surrounding ocean,\nis obviously drawn from the imagination.\n\n_Nam hactenus_, etc. _For their orders were_ to proceed _thus far_ only,\n_and_ (besides) _winter was approaching_. Cf. _hactenus_, G. 25, and\n_appetere_, Ann. 4, 51: _appetente jam luce_. The editions generally have\n_nix_ instead of _jussum_. But Rit. and Or. with reason follow the oldest\nand best MSS. in the reading _jussum_, which with the slight and obvious\namendment of _nam_ for _quam_ by Rit. renders this obscure and vexed\npassage at length easy and clear.\n\n_Pigrum et grave_. See a similar description of the Northern Ocean, G.\n25: pigrum ac prope immotum. The modern reader need not be informed, that\nthis is an entire mistake, as to the matter of fact; those seas about\nBritain are never frozen; though the navigators in this voyage might\neasily have magnified the perils and hardships of their enterprise, by\ntransferring to these waters what they had heard of those further north.\n\n_Perinde_. Al. _proinde_. These two forms are written indiscriminately in\nthe old MSS. The meaning of _ne perinde_ here is _not so much_, sc. as\nother seas. Cf. note, G. 5.\n\n_Ne ventis--attolli_. Directly the reverse of the truth. Those seas, are\nin fact, remarkably tempestuous.\n\n_Quod--impellitur_. False philosophy to explain a fictitious phenomenon,\nas is too often the case with the philosophy of the ancients, who little\nunderstood natural science, cf. the _astronomy_ of T. in 12.\n\n_Neque--ac_. Correlatives. The author assigns two reasons why he does not\ndiscuss the subject of the _tides_: 1. It does not suit the design of his\nwork; 2. The subject has been treated by many others, e.g. Strab. 3, 5,\n11; Plin. N.H. 2, 99, &c.\n\n_Multum fluminum. Multum_ is the object of _ferre_, of which _mare_ is\nthe subject, as it is also of all the infinitives in the sentence.\n_Fluminum_ is not rivers but currents among the islands along the shore.\n\n_Nec littore tenus_, etc. \"_The ebbings and flowings of the tide are not\nconfined to the shore, but the sea penetrates into the heart of the\ncountry, and works its way among the hills and mountains, as in its\nnative bed_.\" Ky. A description very appropriate to a coast so cut up by\naestuaries, and highly poetical, but wanting in simplicity.\n\n_Jugis etiam ac montibus. Jugis_, cf. G. 43. _Ac. Atque_ in the common\neditions. But _ac_, besides being more frequent before a consonant, is\nfound in the best MSS.\n\n\nXI. _Indigenae an advecti_. Cf. _note_, G. 2: _indigenas_.\n\n_Ut inter barbaros_, sc. fieri solet. Cf. ut in licentia, G. 2; and ut\ninter Germanos, G. 30.\n\n_Rutilae--asseverant_. Cf. the description of the Germans, G. 4. The\ninhabitants of Caledonia are of the same stock as the other Britons. The\nconclusion, to which our author inclines below, viz. that the Britons\nproceeded from Gaul, is sustained by the authority of modern\nethnologists. The original inhabitants of Britain are found, both by\nphilological and historical evidence, to have belonged to the Celtic or\nCimmerian stock, which once overspread nearly the whole of central\nEurope, but were overrun and pushed off the stage by the Gothic or German\nTribes, and now have their distinct representatives only in the Welsh,\nthe Irish, the Highland Scotch, and a few similar remnants of a once\npowerful race in the extreme west of the continent and the islands of the\nsea. Cf. note on the Cimbri, G. 37.\n\n_Silurum_. The people of Wales.\n\n_Colorati vultus. Dark complexion_. So with the poets, colorati Indi,\nSeres, Etrusci, &c.\n\n_Hispania_. Nom. subject of _faciunt_, with _crines_, &c.\n\n_Iberos_. Properly a people on the Iberus (Ebro), who gave their name to\nthe whole Spanish Peninsula. They belonged to a different race from the\nCeltic, or the Teutonic, which seems once to have inhabited Italy and\nSicily, as well as parts of Gaul and Spain. A dialect is still spoken in\nthe mountainous regions about the Bay of Biscay, and called the Basque or\nBiscayan, which differs from any other dialect in Europe. Cf. Prichard's\nPhysical Researches, vol. III. chap. 2.\n\n_Proximi Gallis_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 5, 14: Ex his omnibus longe sunt\nhumanissimi, qui Cantium (Kent) incolunt, quae regio est maritima omnis,\n_neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine. Et--also: those nearest\nthe Gauls are also like them_.\n\n_Durante vi. Either because the influence of a common origin still\ncontinues_, etc.\n\n_Procurrentibus--terris. Or because their territories running out towards\none another_, literally, _in opposite directions_, Britain towards the\nsouth and Gaul towards the north, so as to approach each other. See Rit.,\nD\u00c3\u00b6d. in loc., and Freund ad _diversus_.\n\n_Positio--dedit_. The idea of similarity being already expressed in\n_similes_, is understood here: their situation in the same climate\n(_coelo_) has given them the _same_ personal appearance.\n\n_Aestimanti_. Indef. dat. after _credibile est_, cf. note, G. 6.\n\n_Eorum_ refers to the Gauls. You (indef. subject, cf. quiescas, G. 36)\nmay discover the religion of the Gauls (among the Britons) in their full\nbelief of the same superstitions. So Caes. B.G. 6, 13: disciplina in\nBritannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur; and\nhe adds, that those who wished to gain a more perfect knowledge of the\nDruidical system still went from Gaul to Britain to learn. Sharon Turner\nthinks, the system must have been introduced into Britain from the East\n(perhaps India) by the Phenicians, and thence propagated in Gaul. His.\nAng. Sax., B. 1, chap. 5.\n\n_Persuasione_. See the same use of the word, His. 5, 5: eademque de\ninfernis persuasio.\n\n_In--periculis_. The same sentiment is expressed by Caesar (B.G. 3, 19).\n\n_Ferociae_. In a good sense, courage, cf. 31: virtus ac ferocia.\n\n_Praeferunt_==prae se ferunt, i.e. _exhibit_.\n\n_Ut quos. Ut qui_, like _qui_ alone, is followed by the subj. to express\na reason for what precedes. It may be rendered by _because_ or _since_\nwith the demonstrative. So _quippe cui placuisset_, 18. Cf. Z. 565 and H.\n519, 3.\n\n_Gallos floruisse_. Cf. G. 28.\n\n_Otio_. Opposed to _bellis, peace.--Amissa virtute_. Abl. abs. denoting\nan additional circumstance. Cf. 2: _expulsis--professoribus_, note.--\n_Olim_ limits _victis_.\n\n\nXII. _Honestior. The more honorable_ (i.e. the man of rank) _is the\ncharioteer, his dependents fight_ (on the chariot). The reverse was true\nin the Trojan War.\n\n_Factionibus trahuntur_==distrahuntur in factiones. Dr., and Or. T. is\nfond of using simple for compound verbs. See note 22; also numerous\nexamples in the Index to Notes on the Histories.\n\n_Civitatibus_. Dat. for Gen.--_Pro nobis_. Abl. with prep. for dat.\nEnallage. R.--_Conventus. Convention_, meeting.\n\n_Coelum--foedum_. The fog and rain of the British Isles are still\nproverbial.--_Dierum spatia_, etc. Cf. Caes. 513.\n\n_Quod si==and if_. From the tendency to connect sentences by relatives\narose the use of _quod_ before certain conjunctions, particularly _si_,\nmerely as a copulative. Cf. Z. 807. also Freund sub v. The fact alleged\nin this sentence is as false as the philosophy by which it is explained\nin the next, cf. G. 45: in ortus, note.\n\n_Scilicet--cadit_. This explanation proceeds on the assumption that night\nis caused by the shadow of mountains, behind which the sun sets; and\nsince these do not exist in that level extremity of the earth, the sun\nhas nothing to set behind, and so there is no night. The astronomy of T.\nis about of a piece with his natural philosophy, cf. 10.--_Extrema--\nterrarum_. Cf. note, 6: _inania honoris_.\n\n_Non erigunt_, lit. do not elevate the darkness, i.e. do not cast their\nshadow so high (_infraque--cadit_), as the sky and the stars; hence they\nare bright (_clara_) through the night!! Pliny also supposed the heavens\n(above the moon) to be of themselves perpetually luminous, but darkened\nat night by the shadow of the earth. N.H. 2, 7.\n\n_Praeter. Beyond_. Hence either _besides_ or _except_. Here the latter.--\n_Fecundum_. More than _patiens, fruitful even.--Proveniunt_. Ang. _come\nforward_.\n\n_Fert--aurum_, etc. This is also affirmed by Strabo, 4, 5, 2, but denied\nby Cic. ad Att., 4, 16, 7, and ad Div., 7, 7. The moderns decide in favor\nof T. and Strabo, though it is only in inconsiderable quantities that\ngold and silver have ever been found in Britain.\n\n_Margarita_. The neuter form of this word is seldom used, never by\nCicero. See Freund sub v.\n\n_Rubro mari_. The _Red Sea_ of the Greeks and Romans embraced both the\nArabian and the Persian Gulfs; and it was in the latter especially, that\npearls were found, as they are to this day. Cf. Plin. N.H. 9, 54:\npraecipue laudantur (margaritae) in _Persico sinu maris rubri_. For an\nexplanation of the name (Red Sea), see Anthon's Classical Dictionary.\n\n_Expulsa sint. Cast out_, i.e. _ashore, by the waves_. Subj. in a\nsubordinate clause of the oratio obliqua. H. 531; Z. 603.\n\n_Naturam--avaritiam_. A very characteristic sentence, both for its\nantithesis and its satire.\n\n\nXIII. _Ipsi Britanni. Ipsi_ marks the transition from the country to the\npeople, cf. ipsos Germanos, G. 2.\n\n_Obeunt_ properly applies only to _munera_, not to _tributa_ and\n_delectum_, which would require _tolerant_ or some kindred verb. Zeugma.\nH. 704, I. 2; Z. 775.\n\n_Igitur==now_. In the first sentence of the section the author has\nindicated his purpose to speak of the _people_ of Britain. And _now in\npursuance of that design_, he goes back to the commencement of their\nhistory, as related to and known by the Romans. Cf. note, G. 28.\n\n_Divus_. Cf. note, G. 28: D. Julius. For Julius Caesar's campaigns in\nBritain, see Caes. B.G. 4, 21. seq.; 5, 5. seq.; Strabo, Lib. 4, &c.\n\n_Consilium_. His _advice_ (to his successor). See Ann. 1, 11.--\n_Praeceptum_. A _command_ (of Augustus, which Tib. affected to hold\nsacred). Ann. 1, 77; 4, 37.\n\n_C. Caesarem_. Caligula, cf. 4, note.--_Agitasse_, etc. cf. 39. His. 4,\n15; Suet. Calig. 44.\n\n_Ni--fuissent_. Cf. _Ni_, 4, note. The ellipsis may be supplied thus: he\nmeditated an invasion of Brit. and _would have invaded it_, had he not\nbeen _velox ingenio_, etc. But in idiomatic Eng. _ni_==but. Of course\n_fuisset_ is to be supplied with _velox ingenio_ and _mobilis\npoenitentiae_. Al. poenitentia. But contrary to the MSS. _Mobilis_ agrees\nwith _poenitentiae_ (cf. Liv. 31, 32: celerem poenitentiam), which is a\nqualifying gen. Gr. 211. R. 6. Lit. _of repentance easy to be moved_.\nRender: _fickle of purpose_.\n\n_Auctor operis_. Auctor fuit rei adversus Britannos gerendae et feliciter\ngestae. Dr. See on the same subject Suet. Claud. 17.--_Assumpto\nVespasiano_, cf. Suet Vesp. 4. II. 3, 44.\n\n_Quod--fuit_. Vespasian's participation in the war against Brit. was the\ncommencement of his subsequent brilliant fortunes.\n\n_Monstratus fatis_, i.e. a fatis, _by the fates_. The expression is\nborrowed perhaps from Virg. Aen. 6, 870: _Ostendent_ terris hunc tantum\n_fata_.\n\n\nXIV. _Consularium_. Cf. note on it, 8.--_Aulus Plautius_. Ann. 13, 32;\nDio. 60, 19.--_Ostorius Scapula_. Ann. 12, 31-39.--_Proxima_, sc. Romae.\n\n_Veteranorum colonia_. Camolodunum. Ann. 12, 32. Now Colchester. Dr.--_Et\nreges. Kings also_, i.e. besides other means.--_Ut vetere_, etc. So in\nthe MSS. and earliest editions. Rhenanus transferred _ut_ to the place\nbefore _haberet_ which it occupies in the common editions. But no change\nis necessary. Render: _that in accordance with their established custom,\nthe Roman people might have kings also as the instruments of reducing_\n(the Britons) _to slavery_.\n\n_Didius Gallus_. Cf. Ann. 12, 40: arcere hostem satis habebat.--_Parta a\nprioribus. The acquisitions (conquests) of his predecessors_.\n\n_Aucti officii. Of enlarging the boundaries of his government. Officium_\nis used in a like sense, Caes. B.C. 3, 5: Toti officio maritimo\npraepositus, etc. So Wr.; Or. and D\u00c3\u00b6d. understand by it _going beyond_\nthe mere performance of his _duty_. It was his duty to protect his\nprovince: he enlarged it.--_Quaereretur_. Subj. in a relative clause\ndenoting a purpose. H. 500; Z. 567.\n\n_Veranius_. Ann. 14, 29.--_Paullinus_. Ann. 14, 29-30.\n\n_Monam insulam_. Now Anglesey. But the _Mona_ of _Caesar_ is the Isle of\nMan, called by Pliny _Monapia_. The Mona of T. was the chief seat of the\nDruids, hence _ministrantem vires rebellibus_, for the Druids animated\nand led on the Briton troops to battle. T. has given (Ann. 14, 30) a very\ngraphic sketch of the mixed multitude of armed men, women like furies,\nand priests with hands uplifted in prayer, that met Paullinus on his\nlanding, and, for a time, well nigh paralyzed his soldiers with dismay.\nIn the same connexion, he speaks also of the human sacrifices and other\nbarbarous rites, which were practised by our Briton Fathers in honor of\ntheir gods.\n\n\nXV. _Interpretando. By putting their own_, i.e. _the worst construction\nupon them_.\n\n_Ex facili_==facile. A frequent form of expression in T., ad Graecorum\nconsuetudinem. Dr. See R. Exc. 24.\n\n_Singulos--binos_. Distributives==_one for each tribe--two for each\ntribe_.\n\n_Aeque--aeque_. Like Greek correlatives; alike fatal to their subjects\nin _either case_. So [Greek: homoios men] and [Greek: homoios de], Xen.\nMem. 1, 6, 13; Plat. Symp. 181. C.\n\n_Alterius manus centuriones, alterius servos_. This is the reading of the\nlatest editions (Dr. Wr. Or. and R.), and the best MSS., though the MSS.\ndiffer somewhat: _Centurions, the hands_ (instruments) _of the one, and\nservants_, the hands _of the other, added insult to injury_. For the use\nof _manus_ in the above sense, reference is made to Cic. in Ver. 2, 10,\n27: Comites illi tui delecti _manus_ erant tuae. So the _centurions_ of\nthe _legate_ and the _servants_ of the _procurator_ are said by our\nauthor to have robbed the Briton King Prasutagus of his kingdom and his\npalace, Ann. 14, 31, which is the best commentary on the passage before\nus.\n\n_Ab ignavis. By_ the feeble and cowardly. Antithetic to _fortiorem. In\nbattle, it is the braver that plunders us; but now_ (it is a special\naggravation of our sufferings, that) _by the feeble and cowardly_, &c. So\nin contempt, they call the veterans, cf. 14: _veteranorum colonia_; 32:\n_senum colonia_.\n\n_Tantum_ limits _pro patria_; as if it was for their _country_ only they\nknew not how to die.\n\n_Si sese_, etc., i.e. in _comparison_ with their own numbers.\n\n_Patriam--parentes_, sc. _causas belli esse_.\n\n_Recessisset_. Observe the subj. in the subordinate clauses of the oratio\nobliqua throughout this chapter. H. 531; Z. 603.\n\n_Neve--pavescerant_. This verb would have been an imperative in the\noratio recta, Z. 603, c. _Neve_ is appropriate either to the imp. or the\nsubj.\n\n\nXVI. _Instincti_, i.e. furore quodam afflati. Dr. For a fuller account\nof this revolt, see Ann. 14, 31-38; Dio. 62, 1-13.\n\n_Boudicea_. Wife of Prasutagus, king of the Iceni. When conquered, she\nended her life by poison, Ann. 14, 37.\n\n_Expugnatis praesidiis. Having stormed the fortresses_. The force of _ex_\nin this word is seen in that it denotes the _actual carrying_ of a place\nby assault, whereas _oppugnatus_ only denotes the assault itself. So\n[Greek: ek-poliorkaetheis]==_taken_ in a siege, [Greek:\npoliorkaetheis]==besieged.\n\n_Ipsam coloniam_. Cf. note 14: veteranorum colonia.\n\n_In barbaris_==qualis inter barbaros esse solet. R. Exc. 25.\n\n_Ira et victoria_. Hendiadys. Render: _Nor did they in the excitement of\nvictory omit_, etc. So Dr. R. and Wr. _Ira_ may, however, refer to their\n_long cherished resentment. Ira_ causam, _victoria_ facultatem explendae\nsaevitiae denotat. Rit.--_Quod nisi. And had not_, etc. Cf. note, 12:\n_quod si_.\n\n_Patientiae_. Most Latin authors would have said: ad patientiam. R.\n_Patientia_ here==_submission_.\n\n_Tenentibus--plerisque. Though many still retained_, i.e. did not lay\ndown _their arms_.\n\n_Propius_. Al. _proprius_. But that is purely conjectural. Adv. for adj.,\ncf. ultra, 8; longe, 6==propior, like the _propior cura_ of Ovid.\nMetamor. 13, 578. Render: _a more urgent fear_. Some would connect\n_propius_ with _agitabat_ notwithstanding its remote position.\n\n_Suae quoque_. _His own also_, sc. as well as that of the Empire.\n\n_Durius_, sc. aequo. H. 444, 1. cf. 4: _acrius_, note.\n\n_Delictis--novus_. _A stranger to their faults_. Cf. Sil. Ital. 6, 254:\nnovusque dolori. Wr. Cf. B\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac. _Dativus_.\n\n_Poenitentiae mitior_, i.e. mitior erga poenitentiam, or facilior erga\npoenitentes. _Poenitentiae_ dat. of object.\n\n_Compositis prioribus_. _Having restored things to their former quiet\nstate_.\n\n_Nullis--experimentis_. _Undertaking no military expeditions_. Or.--\n_Castrorum_. Cf. 5, note.\n\n_Comitate--tenuit_. \"_Retained the province by a popular manner of\nadministering the government_.\" Ky.--_Curandi_. Note, H. 1, 52.\n\n_Ignoscere_. Properly _not to notice_, hence _to view with indulgence, to\nindulge in_.\n\n_Vitiis blandientibus_. The reference is to the _luxurious and vicious\npleasures_ of the Romans, which enervated the Britons, cf. 21, at close,\nwhere the idea is brought out more fully.\n\n_Cum--lasciviret_. _Cum==since_. Hence the subj.\n\n_Precario_. Cf. note, G. 44.--_Mox_, cf. note 4.\n\n_Velut pacti_ implies a _tacit_ compact. It was understood between them,\nthat the army were to enjoy their liberty; the general, his life. Supply\n_sunt_ with _pacti_. D\u00c3\u00b6d. and Wr. supply _essent_; but they read _haec_\nfor _et_ before _seditio_ contrary to the best MSS.\n\n_Et seditio_. _Et==and so_. Al. haec seditio.\n\n_Stetit_. Not stopped, but stood, as in our phrase: stood them in so\nmuch. So Ovid: Multo _sanguine_--victoria _stetit_. And T. His. 3, 53:\nMajore _damno_--veteres civium discordias reipublicae _stetisse_. Render:\n_cost no blood_. Dr.\n\n_Petulantia_. _Insubordination_.--_Nisi quod_, but, cf. 6.\n\n_Bolanus_. If the reader wishes to know more of the officers named in\nthis chapter, for Turpilianus, see Ann. 14, 39. His. 1, 6; Trebellius,\nHis. 1, 60; Bolanus, Ann. 15, 3. His. 2, 65. 79.\n\n_Caritatem--auctoritatis_. \"_Had conciliated affection as a substitute\nfor authority_.\" Ky.\n\n\nXVII. _Recuperavit_. Al. _reciperavit_. The two forms are written\nindiscriminately in the MSS. The word may express either the recovery of\nwhat was lost, or the restoration to health of what was diseased. Either\nwould make a good sense here. Cf. chap. 5; also Cic. Phil. 14, 13:\n_republica recuperata_. Or. renders _acquired again_, sc. what had\npreviously belonged, as it were, to him, rather than to the bad emperors\nwho had preceded him.\n\n_Petilius Cerialis_. Cf. note, 8.--_Brigantum_. Cf. H. 3, 45; Ann. 12,\n32. Their territory embraced Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Durham\nand Yorkshire.\n\n_Aut victoria aut bello_, i.e. _either received their submission after\nthe victory, or involved them in the calamities of war_. _Aut--aut_\ngenerally adversative==either--or on the contrary. _Vel--vel_ only\ndisjunctive==whether--or. Cf. note on vel--vel, G. 15.\n\n_Alterius_. Another, than Julius Frontinus, i.e. by implication, one\n_different_ from him, _less brave and great_. Cf. His. 2, 90: tanquam\napud alterius civitatis senatum; 3, 13, note. _Alius_ is the word usually\nappropriated to express this idea. _Alter_ generally implies a\n_resemblance_ between contrasted objects. See Freund, ad v.\n\n_Obruisset--sustinuit_. These words primarily refer to physical energies,\nand are exactly counterpart==_crushed--sustained_.\n\n_Quantum licebat_ limits _vir magnus: as great a man, as it was\npermitted_ him to be, restricted as he was in his resources, perhaps by\nthe parsimony of the Emperor. On Julius Frontinus, cf. H. 4, 39. He was\nthe friend of Pliny the Younger (Plin. Ep. 9, 19) and therefore probably\nof Tacitus. His books on Stratagems, and on the Aqueducts of Rome are\nstill extant.--_Super_, over and above, i.e. _besides_.\n\n\nXVIII. _Agentem_, sc. excubias or stationem==stationed in, cf. His. 1,\n47: copias, quae Lugduni agebant. _Ala_. Cf. note, H. 1, 54.\n\n_Ordovicum civitas_. Situated over against the Island Mona, north of the\nSilures, i.e. in the northern part of what is now Wales.\n\n_Ad--verterentur_. _Were turning themselves_ (middle sense) _towards_,\ni.e. _looking to or for. Occasionem. An opportunity_, sc. to attack the\nRomans in their security. Al. _uterentur_.\n\n_Quibus--erat. They who wished for war_. Greek idiom for qui bellum\nvolebant. See K\u00c3\u00bchner's Greek Gram. 284, 10, c., cf. His. 3, 43:\nvolentibus fuit, etc., and note, ibid. In Latin, the idiom occurs chiefly\nin Sallust and T. See Z. 420, and H. 387, 3.\n\n_Ac--opperiri_. Al. _aut_ by conjecture. But _ac==ac tamen, and yet_. Cf.\nAnn. 1, 36: _exauctorari--ac retineri sub vexillo_.\n\n_Transvecta_. Al. transacta. Cf. His. 2, 76: abiit et _transvectum est\ntempus_. Only T. uses the word in reference to time.\n\n_Numeri_==cohortes or manipuli, cf. His. 1, 6: multi numeri. This use of\nthe word is post-Augustan. Cf. note, His. 1, 6.\n\n_Tarda et contraria_. In appos. with the foregoing clauses==\n_circumstances calculated to retard and oppose him in commencing war_.\n\n_Plerisque_, sc. of the inferior officers. They thought it best that\nthose parts of the country, whose fidelity was questionable (_suspecta_)\nshould be secured by garrisons (_custodiri_). _Potius_ is an adj. and\ngoes with _videbatur_==_it seemed preferable_.\n\n_Legionum vexillis_. Some understand this of veteran soldiers who had\nserved out their time (twenty years), but were still _sub vexillis_ (not\ndismissed). So R. and W. Others of parts of the legions detached for a\nseason sub vexillis (under separate standards). So Gronovius. The word\nseems to be used in both senses. See note, H. 1, 31.\n\n_In aequum_. Into the plain. Aequus, prim. level, hence aequor, sea.\n\n_Erexit aciem. Led his troops up the steep_. So His. 3, 71: erigunt aciem\nper adversum collem.\n\n_Ac--ceteris. And that according as the first_ enterprises _went_ (cf.\nnote, 5: _cessit_), would be the terror in the rest_ of his engagements.\nCf. H. 2, 20: _gnarus, ut initia belli provenissent, famam in cetera\nfore_. Al. _fore universa_.\n\n_Possessione. Taking_ possession, cf. 14. A _possidere_, i.e. occupare,\nnon a _possidere_, quod est occupatum tenere. Rit. For the abl. without\n_a_, cf. H. 2, 79: _Syria remeans_.\n\n_Ut in dubiis consiliis_, sc. fieri solet. Generals are not apt to be\nprepared beforehand for enterprises, not contemplated at all in their\noriginal plans.\n\n_Qui--expectabant. Who were looking out for (ex_ and _specto) a fleet,\nfor ships_, in a word _for the sea_, i.e. naval preparations in general,\ninstead of an attack by land. The language is highly rhetorical.--\n_Crediderint_. Livy, Nepos and Tacitus use the _perf_. subj. after _ut_,\ndenoting a consequence, when a single, specific past act is expressed;\nwhen a repeated or continued action, the _imp_. subj. Most writers use\nthe imp. in both cases. See H. 482, 2, and 480; Z. 516; also Z. 504,\nNote, and note H. 1, 24: _dederit_.\n\n_Officiorum ambitum. \"Compliments of office.\"_ Ky.\n\n_Placuisset_. Subj. cf. note, 11: _ut quos_.\n\n_Expeditionem--continuisse. He did not call it a campaign or a victory to\nhave kept the conquered in subjection_.\n\n_Laureatis_ sc. litteris. It was customary to communicate the news of\nvictory to the Emperor and Senate, by letters bound with bay leaves, cf.\nLiv. 5, 28: _litterae_ a Postumio _laureatae_ sequuntur. Without\n_litterae_, it occurs only here. Or. So in H. 3, 77. T. avoids the\ntechnical expression and employs the word _laurea_, seldom used in this\nsense.\n\n_Dissimulatione_. Cf. note, 6.--_Aestimantibus_, cf. aestimanti, 11. The\naspiring, and especially the vain, may learn from this passage a lesson\nof great practical value. Compare also \u00c2\u00a7 8, at the close.\n\n\nXIX. _Aliena experimenta. The experience of others_.\n\n_Nihil_. Ellipsis of _agere_ (which is inserted without MS. authority in\nthe common editions). So Cic. Phil. 1, 2: Nihil per senatum, etc. Cf. G.\n19: _adhuc_, note.\n\n_Ascire_, al. accire. _To receive into regular service_. The reference is\nto the transfer of soldiers from the raw recruits to the legions. So W.\nfollowed by Dr. R. and W. The next clause implies, that he took care to\nreceive into the service none but the best men (_optimum quemque_), whom\nhe deemed _trustworthy_ (_fidissimum_) just in _proportion_ as they were\n_good_. This use of two superlatives mutually related to each other, the\nformer with _quisque_, is frequent in Latin and resembles the English use\nof two comparatives: the better, the more trustworthy. Cf. Z. 710, b.;\nalso note, 3: _promptissmus quisque_.\n\n_Exsequi_==punire. A sense peculiar to the later Latin. Cic. and Caes.\nuse _persequi_. For a similar use of the word in the expression of a\nsimilar sentiment, see Suet. Jul. 67: Delicta neque observabat omnia\nneque pro modo exsequebatur. Compare our word _execute_. And mark the\nsentiment, as a maxim in the science of government.\n\n_Severitatem commodare_. W. with Dr. and R. make this an example of\nzeugma. And in its ordinary acceptation (i.e. in the sense _to give_)\nthe word _commodare_ certainly applies only to _veniam_, and not to\n_severitatem_. But _commodare_ in its primary signification means to\n_adapt_; and in this sense, it suits both of its adjuncts: _He adapted_\n(awarded) _pardon to small offences, severe punishment to great ones_. So\nWr. For the series of infinitives, cf. notes, 5: _nosci_, etc.; G. 30:\n_praeponere_, etc.\n\n_Nec poena--contentus esse. Nor was he always content with punishment,\nbut oftener with repentance_. Mere punishment without reformation did not\nsatisfy him; reformation without punishment satisfied him better. See\nD\u00c3\u00b6d. in loc. Here too some have called in the aid of zeugma.\n\n_Auctionem_. Al. exactionem. The former is the reading of the greater\npart of the MSS. and the later German editions. _Auctionem tributorum_\nrefers to the increased tribute exacted by Vesp. cf. Sueton. Vesp. 16:\n_auxisse_ tributa provinciis, nonnullis et _duplicasse_.\n\n_Munerum_. _Duties, burdens.--Circumcisis_. Cf. note, 2: expulsis. etc.,\nand 11: amissa virtute.\n\n_Namque--cogebantur_. The best version we can give of this obscure\npassage is as follows: _For they were compelled in mockery to sit by the\nclosed granaries and to buy corn needlessly_ (beyond what was necessary,\ncf. note on _ultro_, G. 28, when they had enough of their own) _and to\nsell it at a fixed price_ (prescribed by the purchasers). It has been\nmade a question, whether the granaries of the Britons, or those of the\nRomans are here meant. D\u00c3\u00b6d., Dr. and R. advocate the former opinion;\nWalch, Wr., Or., and Rit. the latter. According to the former view, the\nBritons were often obliged to buy corn of the Romans, because they were\nforbidden to use their own, to supply themselves and their families;\naccording to the latter, because they were required (as explained below)\nto carry their contributions to a quarter so distant from their own\ngranaries, that they were fain to buy the corn rather at some nearer\nwarehouse of the Romans. The selling at a fixed price is equally\nintelligible on either supposition. Or. following the best MSS. reads\n_ludere pretio_, which Rit. has amended into _colludere pretio_. _Ultro_\nmay well enough be rendered _moreover_ or _even_, thus giving emphasis to\n_emere_.\n\n_Devortia itinerum_. _Bye roads_, explained by _avia_, as _longinquitas_\nis by _remota_. The object of requiring the people to convey their\ncontributions to such distant and inconvenient points, was to compel them\nto buy of the Romans, or to pay almost any sum of money to avoid\ncompliance. The reader of Cic. will remember in illustration of this\nwhole passage, the various arts to which Verres is said to have had\nrecourse to enrich himself, at the expense of the people of his province\n(Cic. in Ver. 3, 72, and 82), such as refusing to accept the\ncontributions they brought, obliging them to buy of him at his own price,\nrequiring them to carry supplies to points most distant and difficult of\naccess, _ut vecturae difficultate ad quam vellent aestimationem\npervenirent_.\n\n_Omnibus_, sc. et incolis et militibus; _paucis_, sc. praefectis aut\npublicanis. Dr.\n\n_Donec--fieret_. The subj. here denotes a purpose or object in view, and\ntheretore follows _donec_ according to the rule. H. 522, II.; Z. 575.\nTacitus however always expresses a repeated past action after _donec_ by\nthe imp. subj. Cf. note, 37: affectavere; H. 1, 13. 35.\n\n\nXX. _Statim_. Emphatic, like [Greek: euthus]. Cf. Thucyd. 2, 47: [Greek:\ntou therous euthus archomenou]: at the _very_ beginning of summer. So in\n\u00c2\u00a7 3.\n\n_Intolerantia_, al. tolerantia, but without MS. authority. _Incuria_ is\n_negligence_. Intolerantia_ is _insufferable arrogance, severity_, in a\nword _intolerance_. So Cic.: superbia atque intolerantia.\n\n_Quae--timebatur_. And no wonder, since _ubi solitudinem_ faciunt, _pacem_\nappellant, 30.\n\n_Multus_, al. militum. _Multus_ in the recent editions.\n_Multus_==frequens, cf. Sal. Jug. 84: multus ac ferox instare.--\n_Modestiam--disiectos_. These words are antithetic, though one is\nabstract and the other concrete. The whole clause may be literally\nrendered thus: _ever present in the line of march, he commended\ngood order (discipline), the disorderly he restrained_.\n\n_Popularetur_, sc. A. _Quominus_, that not==_but: but he ravaged their\ncountry by unexpected invasions_.\n\n_Irritamenta_. _Inducements.--Pacis_. Ang. _to_ or _for peace_.\n\n_Ex aequo egerant_, lit. had acted (lived) on an equality, i.e. _had\nmaintained their independence_, cf. His. 4, 64: aut ex aequo agetis aut\naliis imperitabitis.\n\n_Iram posuere_. Cf. Hor. Ars Poet.: et _iram_ colligit ac _ponit_ temere.\nSee also G. 27: ponunt dolorem, etc.\n\n_Ut--transierit_. The clause is obscure. The best that can be made of it\nis this: _they were encompassed by forts and garrisons with so much skill\nand care that no part of Britain hitherto now went over_ (to the enemy)\n_with impunity_ (literally unattacked). For the meaning of _nova_, cf.\n22. For _transierit_, cf. _transitio_, H. 2, 99; 3, 61; and Freund, sub\nv. This is Walther's interpretation. If, with Ernesti, Dr. and some\nothers, we might suppose a _sic_, _ita_ or _tam_ to be understood with\n_illacessita_, we might obtain perhaps a better sense, viz. _came over_\n(to the Romans) _with so little annoyance_ (from the enemy). In the last\nedition a meaning was attached to _transierit_ (_remained_, sc.\nunattacked), for which I now find no sufficient authority. Among the many\namendments, which have been suggested, the easiest and best is that of\nSusius, followed by Wexius, D\u00c3\u00bcbner, Or. and Rit, viz. placing\n_Illacessita transiit_ at the beginning of the next chapter. But this\ndoes violence not only to MS. authority, but to Latin usage in making the\nadverb _ut, so as, as_, follow _tanta_. In such a connection, _ut_ must\nbe a conjunction==_so that, that_. See Freund sub v. For the _perf_.\nsubj. cf. note, 18: _crediderint_.\n\n_Praesidiis castellisque_. Gordon, in his Itinerarium Septentrionale,\nfound more remains of Roman works in that part of Britain here referred\nto, than in any other portion of the Island.\n\n\nXXI. _Ut--assuescerent_. _In order that they might become habituated_,\netc.--_In bella faciles. Easily inclined to wars_. Cf. Ann. 14, 4:\n_facili ad gaudia_. Al. _in bello, bello_, and _in bellum_.--_Otio_. See\nnote, 11: otio.--_Privatim. As a private individual; publice, by public\nauthority, and of course from the public treasury_, cf. note G. 39:\npublice.--_Jam vero_. _Moreover_, cf. G. 14, note.\n\n_Anteferre_. Wr. takes this word in its primary sense==bear before, i.e.\ncarry beyond: _he carried (advanced) the native talents of the Britons\nbeyond the learning of the Gauls_. But there is no authority for such a\nuse of the word, when followed by the acc. and dat. It is doubtless used\nin its more ordinary sense; and the _preference_ which A. expressed for\nthe genius of the Britons over the learning of the Gauls, _stimulated_\nthem to greater exertions. It is somewhat curious to observe thus early\nthat mutual emulation and jealousy, which has marked the whole history of\nBritain and France. The national vanity of La Bletterie is sorely wounded\nby this remark of T. See his note in loco, also Murphy's.--_Toga_. Cf.\nnote on _togatos_, 9.\n\n_Ut--concupiscerent_. _Ut==so that_, denoting a consequence. The verb\nhere denotes a continued or habitual state of mind. Hence the _imp_.\nsubj. Cf. note, 18: _crediderit_.\n\n_Discessum_, sc. a patrum moribus ad vitia varia. Dr.\n\n_Delenimenta_==illa, quibus animi _leniuntur_. Dr. _Charms,\nblandishments_. Cf. H. 1, 77. The word is not found in Cic. or Caes.\n\n_Humanitas. Civilisation, refinement_. Compare the professorships of\n_humanity_ in European Universities.\n\n_Pars servitutis_. For the sentiment, cf. His. 4, 64: voluptatibus,\nquibus Romani plus adversus subjectos, quam armis valent. _Cum==while,\nalthough_. Hence the subj.\n\n\nXXII. _Tertius--annus_. _Third campaign_.\n\n_Taum_. The Frith of Tay.--_Nationibus_. Here synonymous with _gentes_;\nsometimes less comprehensive, cf. note, G. 2.\n\n_Pactione ac fuga_. Al. _aut_ fuga, but without authority. There are\nbut two distinct clauses marked by _aut--aut: either taken by assault or\nabandoned by capitulation and flight_.\n\n_Nam--firmabantur_. This clause assigns a reason, why the Romans were\n_able_ to make frequent sorties (_crebrae eruptiones_), viz. supplies of\nprovision so abundant, as to be proof against blockade.\n\n_Moras obsidionis. A protracted siege_, or _blockade_.\n\n_Annuis copiis. Supplies for a year_. This is the _primary_ signification\nof _annuus_; that of our word _annual_ is _secondary_.\n\n_Intrepida--praesidio_==hiberna quieta ac tuta ab hostibus. Fac. and For.\n--_Irritis, baffled_. Seldom applied to _persons_ by prose writers. Cf. H.\n4, 32.\n\n_Pensare_. R. remarks a peculiar fondness in T. for the use of the simple\nverb instead of the compound, e.g. missa for omissa, sistens for\nresistens, flammare for inflammare, etc. So here _pensare==compensare_.\nCf. 12: _trahuntur_, note.\n\n_Avidus_, sc. laudis==per aviditatem laudis et gloriae. E.: A. never in\nhis eagerness for glory arrogated to himself the honor of the\nachievements of others.--_Seu--seu. Every one, whether centurion or\npraefect_ (commander of a legion, cf. note, H. 1, 82.), _was sure to have\nin him an impartial witness to his deeds_.\n\n_Acerbior_, cf. note on _durius_, 16.--_Apud quosdam_==a quibusdam.\n\n_Secretum et silentium. Reserve and silence_. So W. and Ky. But R. and\nDr.: _private interviews_ (to be summoned to which by some commanders was\nalarming), _and neglect of the usual salutations in public_ (which was\nalso often a token of displeasure on the part of a superior officer). The\nformer is the more simple and obvious, though it must be confessed that\nthe latter is favored by the usus loquendi of T., in regard especially to\n_secretum_, cf. 39; Ann. 3, 8, where _secreto_ is opposed to _palam_; and\nHis. 4, 49: incertum, quoniam _secreto eorum_ nemo _adfuit_.\n\n\nXXIII. _Obtirendis. Securing possession of.--Pateretur_, sc. terminum\ninveniri.--_In ipsa Brit_. In the very _nature_ or structure of the\nisland, as described in the sequel. See Or. in loc.\n\n_Clota et Bodotria_. Frith of Clyde and Frith of Forth.\n\n_Revectae_, i.e. the natural current being driven back by the tide from\nthe sea on either side. _Angusto--spatio_. It is now cut across by a ship\ncanal.\n\n_Propior sinus_==peninsula on the south side of the Friths, cf, note on\nsinus G. 1, and 29. Sinus refers particularly to the _curved border_ on\n_this side_ the aestuaries. This border (wherever the friths were so\nnarrow as to require it), as well as the narrow isthmus, was occupied and\nsecured (_tenebatur_) by garrisons.\n\n\nXXIV. _Nave prima_. The first Roman ship that ever visited those shores.\nSo Br., Dr., etc. _The foremost ship_, sc., A. himself, followed by\nothers in a line. So Ritter. Wr., and some others understand it of a\nvoyage from _Rome_, where they suppose him to have passed the winter, and\nwhence he crossed over to Britain by the _earliest_ vessel in the spring.\nW. and R. make _prima_ equivalent to an adv. and render: crossing over\n_for the first time_ by ship. Or. also makes _prima==tum primum_.\n\n_Copiis_. Here troops with their equipments==_forces_, cf. 8: majoribus\ncopiis.--_Medio sita_ lying between, not midway between. E.--_In spem--\nformidinem_. More with the hope of invading Ireland, than through fear of\ninvasion by the Irish.--_Valentissimam partem_, viz. Gaul, Spain and\nBritain.\n\n_Miscuerit_. The subj. here denotes the aim or purpose of the projector:\nit would have done so _in his view_.\n\n_Invicem_==an adj. _mutual.--Nostri maris_. The Mediterranean.\n\n_Differunt: in melius_. The authorities differ greatly as to the reading,\nthe pointing and the interpretation of this passage. Some copies omit\n_in_. Others insert _nec_ before it. Some place the pause before _in\nmelius_, others after. Some read _differt_, others _differunt. Nec in\nmelius_ would perhaps give the better sense. But the reading is purely\nconjectural. I have given that, which, on the whole, seems to rest on the\nbest authority, and to make the best sense. The sense is: _the soil,\nclimate, &c., do not differ much from those of Britain. But that the\nharbors and entrances to the country are better_ (lit. _differ for the\nbetter, differre in melius), is ascertained through the medium of the\nmerchants, who resort thither for trade_ (for Ireland had not yet, like\nBritain, been explored by a Roman _army_). So Wr. and D\u00c3\u00b6d. On _in\nmelius_, see note H. 1, 18. Or. and Rit. make the comparison thus: the\nharbors and entrances are better known, than the soil, climate, &c. The\ncommon interpretation is: the harbors, &c., of Ireland are better known,\nthan those of Britain. But neither of these interpretations accounts for\nthe position of _melius_; and the last is in itself utterly incredible.\n\n_Ex eo_, sc. A. Pass. and Dr. understand it of the Irish chief, and infer\nthat T. had been in Brit. But A. is the subject of the next sentence\nwithout the repetition of his name, as it would have been repeated, if\nthis sentence referred to another.\n\n\nXXV. _Amplexus_. Some supply _bello_, as in 17: bello amplexus. But\nbetter: embracing _in his plan of operations_, i.e. _extending his\noperations to those tribes_.\n\n_Hostilis exercitus_. Al. hostili exercitu. But _hostilis exercitus_ in\nthe MSS. and earliest editions.--_Infesta_ is here active: _hostile\ninroads of the enemy's forces_.\n\n_In partem virium_. _For_, i.e. _as a part of his force_.\n\n_Impelleretur_, was borne on with rapid and resistless power.\n\n_Profunda--adversa_. Cf. note, 6: _inania honoris_.\n\n_Mixti copiis et laetitia. Uniting their stores and their pleasures_,\ni.e. their respective means of entertainment. For _mixti_, cf. 4:\nlocum--mixtum. For _copiis_ in this sense, 22: annuis copiis. For the\nother sense, viz. forces, 24: copiis, note.\n\n_Hinc--hinc==on this side--on that_. Cf. note G. 14: _illum--illam_.--\n_Victus_. Al. _auctus_.\n\n_Ad manus et arma_. Ang. _to arms_.\n\n_Oppugnasse_ depends on _fama_. Their preparations were great. Rumor as\nusual (_uti mos_, etc.) represented them still greater; for the rumor\nwent abroad, that the Caledonians had _commenced offensive operations\n(oppugnasse ultra).--Castella adorti_ is the means by which they _metum\naddiderant_, i.e. _had inspired additional fear_.\n\n_Pluribus agminibus. In several divisions_. Accordingly it is added:\n_diviso et ipse_, A. _himself also_, i.e. as well as the Britons,\n_having divided_, etc.\n\n_Agmen_ (from ago), properly a body of men on the march.--_Exercitus_,\nunder military drill (exerceo.)\n\n\nXXVI. _Quod ubi_, etc. _When this was known_, etc. Latin writers, as well\nas Greek, generally link their sentences, chapters, &c., more closely\ntogether, than English. Hence we are often obliged to render their\nrelative by our demonstrative. See Z. 803. _Ubi_, here adv. of _time_, as\nin 20, 38, et passim.\n\n_Certabant_. Not _fought_ with the enemy, but _vied_ with each other. So\nbelow: utroque--certante. Hence followed by _de_ gloria, not _pro_ gloria,\nwhich some would substitute for it; _secure for_ (in regard to) _safety,\nthey vied with each other in respect to_ (or _in_) _glory_. With _pro\nsalute_, cf. His. 4, 58: pro me securior.\n\n_Erupere. Sallied forth_, sc. from the camp.\n\n_Utroque exercitu_. Each of the two _Roman_ armies.\n\n_Quod_. Cf. 12, note.--_Debellatum_, lit. the war would have been fought\n_out_, i.e. _ended_.\n\n\nXXVII. _Cujus_ refers to _victoria_ in the previous section (cf. _quod_\n26, note): _inspirited by the consciousness and the glory of this\nvictory_.\n\n_Modo cauti_. Compare the sentiment with 25: specie prudentium, etc.\n\n_Arte--rati_, al. arte _usos_ rati by conjecture. But T. is fond of such\nellipses: _The Britons, thinking it was not by superior bravery, but by\nfavoring circumstances_ (on the part of the Romans) _and the skill of\ntheir commander_ (sc. that they had been defeated). Rit. reads\n_superati_.\n\n_Utrimque_. Both the Romans and the Britons; the Romans excited by their\nvictory, the Britons by their coetibus ac sacrificiis.\n\n_Discessum. They separated_, viz. after the battle and at the close of\nthe campaign.\n\n\nXXVIII. _Cohors Usipiorum_. See same story, Dio Cass. 66, 20.\n\n_Adactis. Forced on board.--Remiganto_==gubernante, to avoid sameness,\nwith _gubernatoribus_, Br. R. supposes that having but one pilot left,\nonly the vessel on which he sailed was _rowed_, while the others were\ntowed by it; and this rowing _under his direction_ is ascribed to _him_.\nSome MSS. and many editions read _remigrante_, which some translate:\n_making his escape_, and others connect with _interfectis_, and suppose\nthat he also was slain in trying to _bring back_ his boat to shore.\nWhether we read _remigante_ or _remigrante_, the signification of either\nis unusual.\n\n_Praevehebantur_. Sailed along the coast (in sight of land).\n\n_Inopiae_ is governed by _eo_, which is the old dat.==_to such a degree.\n--Ad extremum==at last_.\n\n_Vescerentur_ followed by the acc. H. 419, 4. 1; Z. 466. For the imp.\nsubj. cf. note 21: _ut--concupiscerent_.\n\n_Amissis--navibus_. This is regarded by some as proof that _all_ the\nsteersmen were slain or escaped. Dr. answers, that it may refer only to\nthe _two_ ships that were without steersmen.\n\n_Suevis_. A people of Northern Germany (G. 38, seq.) whither, after\nhaving circumnavigated Britain, the Usipii came.--_Mox, subsequently_,\nsome having escaped the Suevi.\n\n_Per commercia. In trade_, cf. same in 39.\n\n_Nostram ripam_. The Gallic bank of the Rhine, which was the border of\nthe Roman Empire, cf. G. passim.\n\n_Quos--indicium--illustravit_. Whom the account of so wonderful an\nadventure rendered illustrious. The rule would require the subj. H. 501,\nI. 2; Z. 561.\n\n\nXXIX. _Initio aestatis_, i.e. in the beginning of the _next_ summer (the\n7th campaign, cf. 25: _aestate, qua sextum_, etc.), as the whole history\nshows. See especially _proximo anno_, 34. Hence the propriety of\ncommencing a new section here. The common editions begin it below:\n_Igitur_, etc.\n\n_Plerique_. Cf. note on it, 1.--_Fortium virorum_. _Military men_.\n\n_Ambitiose, with affected fortitude, stoically_.--_Rursus_==contra, _on\nthe contrary_, showing the antith. between _ambitiose_ and _per lamenta_.\n--_Per lamenta_, cf. 6: per caritatem.--_Igitur_, cf. 13, note.\n\n_Quae--faceret_==ut ea faceret. H. 500; Z. 567. _Incertum_ is explained\nby _pluribus locis_. Render: _general alarm_.--_Expedito_==sine\nimpedimentis, armis solis instructo. Fac. and For.--_Montem Grampium_.\nNow _Grampian hills_.\n\n_Cruda--senectus_. Cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 304: sed cruda deo viridisque\nsenectus. _Crudus_ is rarely found in this sense except in the poets.\n_Crudus_ properly==bloody (_cruor, cruidus_); hence the successive\nsignifications, raw, unripe, fresh, vigorous.--_Sua decora_==praemia\nob virtutem bellicam accepta. E. Any and all _badges of distinction_,\nespecially in _arms_. Wr., Or. and D\u00c3\u00b5d.\n\n\nXXX. _Causas belli_. Explained by _universi servitutis expertes_ below,\nto be the defence of their liberties. In like manner, _nostram\nnecessitatem_ is explained by _nullae ultra terrae_: there is no retreat\nfor us, etc.--_Animus, Confidence_.\n\n_Proelium--arma_. T. has a passion for _pairs_ of words, especially\nnouns, of _kindred signification_. See examples in Index to Histories;\nand in this chapter, _spem ac subsidium_; _recessus ac sinus_; _obsequiam\nac modestiam_.\n\n_Priores pugnae_, sc. in which the Caledonians took no part.--_Pugnae_\nis here, by a figure put for the _combatants_ themselves, who are\nrepresented as looking to the Caledonians, as a kind of corps de reserve,\nor last resource.\n\n_Eo. For that reason_. The best things are always kept guarded and\nconcealed in the _penetralia_. There may also be a reference to a _fact_\nstated by Caesar (B.G. 5, 12), that the inhabitants of the interior were\naborigines, while those on the coast were immigrants.\n\n_Terrarum--extremos_. _The remotest of men and last of freemen_.\n--_Recessus--famae_. _Our very remoteness and obscurity_. This is the\nmost common and perhaps the most simple translation, making _sinus\nfamae_==seclusion in respect to fame. Perhaps, however, it accords as\nwell with the usual signification of the words, and better with the\nconnexion and spirit of the speech, to take _sinus famae_ in the sense,\n_retreat of glory_, or _glorious retreat_. So Wr. His interpretation of\nthe passage and its connexion is as follows: _our very remoteness and our\nglorious retreat have guarded us till this day. But now the furthest\nextremity of Brit. is laid open_ (i.e. our retreat is no longer a\nsafeguard); _and every thing unknown is esteemed great (i.e. this\nsafeguard also is removed--the Romans in our midst no longer magnify our\nstrength). Rit. encloses the clause in brackets, as a gloss. He renders\n_sinus famae, bosom of fame_, fame being personified as a goddess. R.,\nDr., Or. make _famae_ dative after _defendit_==has _kept back from fame_.\n\n_Sed nulla jam_, etc. But now all the above grounds of confidence--our\nremoteness, our glory, our greatness magnified by the imagination of our\nenemies, from the very fact that we were unknown to them--all these are\nremoved; we have none behind us to fall back upon, as our countrymen in\nformer battles have leaned upon us--and we are reduced to the necessity\nof self-defence and self-reliance. The _sed_ seems to be antithetic to\nthe whole as far back as _priores pugnae_; whereas _nunc_ is opposed only\nto the clause which immediately precedes it, and constitutes an\nantithesis within an antithesis.\n\n_Infestiores_, sc. quam fluctus et saxa.\n\n_Effugeris_. Cf. note G. 19: _non invenerit_; also _satiaverit_ just\nbelow.\n\n_Et mare_. _Et==also_. Cf. note, G. 11.\n\n_Opes atque inopiam_. Abs. for conc.==rich and poor nations.\n\n_Falsis nominibus_ is by some connected with _rapere_. But better with\n_appellant_. _They call things by false names_, viz. _plunder, empire;\nand desolation, peace_.\n\n\nXXXI. _Annos_==annonam, _yearly produce_, cf. G. 14: expectare annum. So\noften in the Poets.--_In frumentum. For supplies_. The reading of this\nclause is much disputed. The text follows that of W. and R. and is\napproved by Freund. For the meaning of _egerunt_, cf. _praedam\negesserunt_, H. 3, 33.\n\n_Silvis--emuniendis_==viis per silvas et paludes muniendis. E.\n\n_Semel_. _Once for all_, G. 19.--_Emit_, sc. tributis pendendis;\n_pascit_, sc. frumento praebendo. E.\n\n_Portus, quibus exercendis_. W. and Dr. explain this of collecting\nrevenue at the ports (i.e. farming them), a thing unknown to the early\nBritons; Wr. of rowing, servile labor. Why not refer it to the\n_construction_ or _improvement_ of harbors? By rendering _exercendis,\nworking, improving_, we make it applicable alike to harbors, mines and\nfields.--_Reservemur_. Subj. in a relative clause denoting a purpose. H.\n500; Z. 567.\n\n_Potuere_. Observe the ind., where we use the potential. It is especially\nfrequent with _possum, debeo_, &c. Z. 518 and 519.\n\n_Nonne_ implies an affirmative answer. Z. 352, and H. 346, II. 1. 2.\n\n_In poenitentiam_, al. in praesentiam. The general idea is essentially\nthe same with either reading. _Non in praesentiam==not to obtain our\nfreedom, for the present merely. Non in poenitentiam==not about to\nobtain our freedom merely to regret it_, i.e. in such a manner as the\nBrigantes, who forthwith lost it by their _socordia_.\n\n\nXXXII. _Nisi si_==nisi forte, cf. note, G. 2: nisi si patria.\n\n_Pudet dictu_. The supine after _pudet_ is found only here. Quintilian\nhowever has _pudendum dictu_. Cf. Or. in loc.; and Z. 441. 443.\n\n_Commendent_, etc. _Although they give up their blood to_ (i.e. _shed it\nin support of_) _a foreign tyrant_.--_Tamen_ is antithetic to _licet_:\n_although_ they give, _yet longer enemies, than slaves_ (of Rome).\n\n_Metus--est_. _It is fear and terror_ (sc. that keep them in subjection),\n_weak bonds of affection_.\n\n_Removeris--desierint_. Fut. perf. Cf. note, G. 23: _indulseris_.\n\n_Nulla--aut alia_. Some of the Roman soldiers had lost all attachment to\ncountry and could not be said to have any country; others had one, but it\nwas not Britain, it was far away.\n\n_Ne terreat_. The third person of the imperative is for the most part\navoided in ordinary language; and the pres. subj. is used in its stead.\nZ. 529, Note.\n\n_Nostras manus_, i.e. those ready to join us and aid our arms, viz. (as\nhe goes on to say), the Gauls and Germans, as well as the Britons now in\nthe Roman ranks.--_Tamquam_==_just as_ (_tam-quam_). D\u00c3\u00b6d. renders, _just\nas certainly as_.\n\n_Vacua.--Destitute of soldiers.--Senum_, sc. veterani et emeriti. Cf.\nnote, 15. _Aegra==disaffected_. Cf. H. 2, 86.\n\n_Hic dux_, etc. _Here a general, here an army_ (sc. the Roman, awaits\nyou); _there tributes, mines_, &c. (and you must conquer the former or\nendure the latter--these are your only alternatives).\n\n_In hoc campo est_. _Depends on this battle field_.--T. has laid out all\nhis strength on this speech. It can hardly be matched for martial force\nand sententious brevity. It breathes, as it should in the mouth of a\nBriton, an indomitable spirit of liberty, and reminds us, in many\nfeatures, of the concentrated and fiery eloquence, which has so often\nroused our American Indians to defend their altars and revenge their\nwrongs.\n\n\nXXXIII. _Ut barbaris moris_. Al. et barbari moris. But compare 39: ut\nDomitiano moris erat; His. 1, 15: ut moris est. Supply _est_ here: _as is\nthe custom of_ (lit. _to_) _barbarians_. Z. 448, & H. 402, I.\n\n_Agmina_, sc. conspiciebantur.--_Procursu_ is the means by which the\ngleam of armor was brought into view.\n\n_Acies_, sc. Britannorum. The _Roman_ army was still within the camp, cf.\n_munimentis coercitum_, below.\n\n_Coercitum_==qui coerceri potest. The part, used in the sense of a verbal.\nSo _monstratus_, G. 31, which, Freund says, is Tacitean. The perf. part.\npass. with negative prefix _in_ often takes this sense. Z. 328. Cf. note,\nHis. 5, 7: _inexhaustum_.\n\n_Octavus annus_. This was Agricola's _seventh summer_ in Britain. See\nnote 29: _initio aestatis_. But it being now later in the season, than\nwhen he entered Britain, he was now entering on his _eighth year_. Cf.\nRit. in loc.\n\n_Virtute--Romani_. _By the valor and favoring auspices of the Roman\nEmpire_. War was formerly carried on auspiciis _Populi_ Rom. But after\nAugustus, auspiciis _Imperatoris_ or _Imperii_ Rom.\n\n_Expeditionibus--proeliis_. These words denote the _time_ of _poenituit_\n(_in_ or _during_ so many, etc.)--_Patientia_ and _labore_ are abl. after\n_opus_.\n\n_Terminos_. Acc. after _egressi_ (H. 371, 4): _having transcended the\nlimits_. Cf. Z. 387.\n\n_Fama, rumore_. Synonyms. Also _castris, armis_. Cf. note, 30.\n\n_Vota--aperto_. _Your vows and your valor now have free scope_ (are in the\nopen field), cf. note 1: _in aperto_.\n\n_In frontem_. Antith. to _fugientibus_. Hence==progredientibus.\n\n_Hodie_. _To-day_, i.e. _in our present circumstances of prosperity_.\nWr.\n\n_Nec--fuerit_. _Nor will it have been inglorious_, sc. when the thing\nshall have been _done_ and men shall look _back_ upon our achievements.\nThe fut. perf. is appropriate to such a conception.\n\n_Naturae fine_. Cf. note, G. 45: _illuc usque natura_.\n\n\nXXXIV. _Hortarer_. Literally, _I would be exhorting you_. The use of the\nimperf. subj. in hypothetical sentences, where we should use a plup. (I\nwould have exhorted you), is frequent both in Greek and Latin, even when\nit denotes a _complete_ past action, cf. Z. 525. When the action is not\ncomplete, as here, the Latin form is at once more lively and more exact\nthan the English.--_Proximo anno_. This same expression may signify\neither the next year, or the last year. Here of course: _the last year_,\nreferring to the battle described in 26, cf. also note 29: _Initio\naestatis_.\n\n_Furto noctis_. Cf. Virg. Aen. 9, 397: fraude noctis.\n\n_Contra ruere_. _Rush forth to meet, penetrantibus_, etc. R. and Wr. take\n_ruere_ for perf. 3d pl. instead of _ruerunt_, since T. uses the form in\n_ere_ much more than that in _erunt_. Rit. makes it inf. after _solet_\nunderstood, or rather implied in _pelluntur_, which==_pelli solent_.\n\n_Quos--quod_. _Whom, as to the fact that you have at length found (it is\nnot because) they have taken a stand, but they have been overtaken_. Cf.\nWr. and Or. in loc. On _deprehensi_, cf. note, 7. On _quod==as to this,\nthat_, see examples in Freund, or in any Lexicon.\n\n_Novissimae--vestigiis_. _The extremity of their circumstances, and their\nbodies_ (motionless) _with terror have brought them to a stand for battle\non this spot_, etc. One MS. reads _novissime_ and omits _aciem_, which\nreading is followed in the common editions.\n\n_Extremo metu_ is to be closely connected with _corpora_. For the sense\nof _defixere_, cf. Ann. 13, 5: pavore defixis.\n\n_Ederetis_. Subj. cf. H. 500, 2; Z. 556, a.\n\n_Transigite cum expeditionibus_==finite expeditiones. Dr. Cf. G. 19:\ncum spe--transigitur, note.\n\n_Quinquaginta annis_. So many years, it might be said to be in round\nnumbers, though actually somewhat _less_ than fifty years, since the\ndominion of Rome was first established in Britain under the Emperor\nClaudius. Cf. 13, supra.--The speech of A. is not equal to that of\nGalgacus. He had not so good a cause. He could not appeal to the sacred\nprinciples of justice and liberty, to the love of home and household\ngods. But he makes the best of a bad cause. The speech is worthy of a\nRoman commander, and touches with masterly skill all those chords in a\nRoman soldier's breast, that were never touched in vain.\n\n\nXXXV. _Et==both_. Both while he was speaking and after he had ceased, the\nsoldiers manifested their ardor, etc.\n\n_Instinctos_. Cf. note 16: instincti.\n\n_Aciem firmarent_==aciem firmam facerent, of which use there are examples\nnot only in T., but in Liv. Dr. The auxiliary foot _formea_ or _made up_\n(not merely strengthened) _the centre_.--_Affunderentur. Were attached\nto_.--_Pro vallo. On the rampart_; properly on the fore part of it. Cf.\nnote, H. 1, 29.\n\n_Ingens--decus_. In app. with _legiones--stetere_.\n\n_Bellanti_, sc. Agricolae. Al. bellandi.\n\n_In speciem_. Cf. in suam famam, 8, and in jactationem, 5.\n\n_Aequo_. Supply consisteret to correspond with _insurgeret_. Zeugma. Cf.\nnote, 18: in aequum.\n\n_Media campi_. _The intervening parts of the plain_, sc. between the two\narmies.--_Covinarius_ is found only in T. _Covinarii_==the essedarii of\nCaesar. Covinus erat currus Belgarum, a quibus cum Britanni acceperant.\nDr.\n\n_Pedes_. Nom. sing, in app. with subject of _constitit_.\n\n\nXXXVI. _Indentibus gladiis_, etc. So below: _parva scuta_, etc. The small\nshield and broad sword of the Highlanders.\n\n_Donec--cohortatus est_. Cf. note, G. 37: _affectavere_.--_Batavorum\ncohortes_. Al. _tres--cohortes_. But the number is not specified in the\nbest MSS. In the Histories, eight cohorts of Batavians are often\nmentioned as constituting the auxiliaries of the 14th legion, which was\nnow in Britain. See Rit. in loc.\n\n_Ad mucrones_. The Britons were accustomed to fight with the edge of the\nsword, and cut and hew the enemy. The Romans, on the contrary, made use\nof the _point_. Of course in a close engagement, they would have greatly\nthe advantage. Br.--_Ad manus_. The opposite of _eminus_, i.e. _a close\nengagement_. The same thing is expressed below by _complexum armorum_.\n\n_In aperto pugnam_. Literally a fight in the open field, i.e. a\n_regular_ pitched _battle_, which with its compact masses would be less\nfavorable to the large swords of the Britons, than a battle on ground\nuncleared of thickets and forests. Al. _in arto_.\n\n_Miscere, ferire_, etc. A series of inf. denoting a rapid succession of\nevents, cf. note, 5: noscere--nosci; G. 30: praeponere.\n\n_Equitum turmae_, sc. Britannorum. The word _turmae_ is applicable to\nsuch a cavalry as theirs, cf. Ann. 14, 34: _Britannorum_ copiae passim\nper catervas et _turmas_ exsultabant. Br. Ky. and others here understand\nit of the Roman cavalry. But R. Dr. and Wr. apply it to the Britons, and\nwith reason, as we shall see below, and as we might infer indeed from its\nclose connexion with _covinarii_, for the _covinarii_ were certainly\nBritons.\n\n_Peditum proelio, hostium agminibus_. These also both refer to the\n_Britons_. The covinarii were interspersed among their own infantry, and,\nas the Romans advanced, became entangled with them. This is disputed. But\nthe small number of Romans slain in the whole battle is alone enough to\nshow, that _their_ cavalry was not routed, nor _their_ infantry broken in\nupon by the chariots of the enemy. Moreover, how could T. properly use\nthe word _hostium_ of his own countrymen?\n\n_Minimeque_, etc. This is one passage, among a few in T., which is so\nmanifestly corrupt that no sense can be made of it, as it stands in the\nMSS. The reading given in the text is the simplest of all the conjectural\nreadings that have been proposed. It is that of Br. and E., and is\nfollowed by the common editions. Cavalry took a large part in the battle.\nBut the battle wore little the aspect of an equestrian fight; for the\nBritons, after maintaining their position with difficulty for some time,\nwere at length swept away by the bodies (the _mere uncontrolled bodies_)\nof the horses--in short, the riders had no control over horses or\nchariots, which rushed on without drivers obliquely athwart, or directly\nthrough the lines, as their fears severally impelled them; all which was\nin marked contrast to a Roman's idea of a regular battle of cavalry.\n\n\nXXXVII. _Vacui. Free from apprehension_.\n\n_Ni_. Cf. note 4: ni.--_Subita belli. Unexpected emergencies_ arising in\nthe course of the battle. Cf. 6: _inania honoris_.\n\n_Grande et atrox spectaculum_, etc. See a similar description in Sal.\nJug. 101. The series of infinitives and the omission of the connectives\n(_asyndeton_) make the succession of events very rapid and animated.\nCompare the famous _veni, vidi, vici_, of Caesar.\n\n_Prout--erat_. According to their different natural disposition, i.e.\n_the timid, though armed, turned their backs before inferior numbers;\nwhile the brave, though unarmed, met death in the face_.\n\n_Praestare terga_ is an expression found only in T.\n\n_Et aliquando_, etc. _Et==ac tamen. And_ yet (notwithstanding the flight\nof crowds and the passive death of some as above) _sometimes to the\nconquered also_ there was _anger and bravery_. The language is Virgilian,\ncf. Aen. 2, 367.\n\n_Quod_. Cf. note 12.--_Ni frequens--fiduciam foret_. \"Had not A., who was\neverywhere present, caused some strong and lightly equipped cohorts to\nencompass the ground, while part of the cavalry having dismounted, made\ntheir way through the thickets, and part on horseback scoured the open\nwoods, some disaster would have prcoeeded from this excess of\nconfidence.\" Ky.\n\n\nXXXVIII. _Gaudio praedaque laeta_. Cf. note, G. 7: _cibos et hortamina_.\nObserve also the juxtaposition of _tempestate_ and _fama_ in this same\nchapter.\n\n_Separare_, sc. consilia, i.e. _they sometimes act in concert, sometimes\nprovide only for their individual safety_.\n\n_Pignorum_. Cf. note G. 7: pignora--_Saevisse. Laid violent hands_. \"This\npicture of rage and despair, of tenderness, fury, and the tumult of\ncontending passions, has all the fine touches of a master who has studied\nhuman nature.\" Mur.--_Secreti_==deserti.\n\n_Ubi. When_, cf. 26. Its direct influence extends to _nequibat_, and with\nits clause, it expresses the _reason_ why A. drew off his forces into the\ncountry of the Horesti.--_Spargi bellum_==diversis locis, vel diviso\nexercitu, vel vagando bellum geri. E.\n\n_Secunda--fama. Favored by the weather and the glory of their past\nachievements_ (lit. the weather and fame _following_ them, _secunda\n==sequunda_.)\n\n_Trutulensem portum_. Some port, now unknown, probably near the mouth of\nthe Tay or the Forth. _Unde_ qualifies _lecto_. E. With _redierat_ a\ncorresponding adv. denoting _whither_, is to be supplied: whence it had\nset sail, and whither, after having surveyed all the nearest coast of\nBritain, it had now returned. _Had_ returned, i.e. prior to _entering_\nthe port; the action of _redierat_, was prior to that of _tenuit_. Hence\nplup. _Proximo, nearest_, sc. to the scene of Agricola's operations,\ni.e. the whole northern coast from the Forth to the Clyde and back again.\nThis was all that was necessary to prove Britain to be an island (cf.\nchap. 10), the southern coast having been previously explored.\n\n\nXXXIX. _Actum_. Al. auctum, a conjecture of Lipsius. _Actum==treated of,\nreported.--Moris erat_. H. 402, I.; Z. 448, N. 1. N. 1.\n\n_Falsum--triumphum_. He had returned without so much as seeing the enemy\n(Dio Cass. 67, 4); and yet he bought slaves, dressed them in German\nstyle, had their hair stained red (G. 4: _rutilae comae_) and left long,\nso as to resemble Germans, and then marched in triumph into Rome with his\ntrain of pretended captives! Caligula had done the same before him. Suet.\nCalig. 47.\n\n_Formarentur_. Subj. in a relative clause denoting a purpose (_quorum==ut\neorum_). H. 500; Z. 567.\n\n_Studia--acta_. Lawyers and politicians, all public men, had been gagged\nand silenced by Domitian.\n\n_Alius_. Another than the Emperor.--_Occuparet==pre-occupy_, so as to rob\nhim of it.\n\n_Utcumque_. Somehow, possibly, perhaps. _Other things perhaps were more\neasily concealed; but the merit of a good commander was an imperial\nprerogative_.\n\n_Quodque--satiatus_. _And what was a proof of some cruel purpose, wholly\nabsorbed in his retirement_ (where he never plotted any thing but\nmischief, and where in early life he is said to have amused himself with\nkilling flies, Suet. Dom. 3). Cf. Plin. Panegyr. 48: nec unquam ex\nsolitudine sua prodeuntem, nisi ut solitudinem faceret. The whole passage\nin Pliny is a graphic picture of the same tyrant, the workings of whose\nheart are here so laid bare by the pen of Pliny's friend Tacitus.\n_Secreto--satiatus_ may also be translated: _satisfied with his own\nsecret_, i.e. keeping to himself his cherished hatred and jealousy.--\n_Languesceret_. Subj. after _donec_. Cf. note, G. 37: _affectavere_.\n\n_Reponere odium_. See lexicon under _repono_ for this phrase.\n\n_Impetus--exercitus_. _Until the freshness of his glory, and his\npopularity with the army should gradually decline_.\n\n_Etiam tum obtinebat_, i.e. he was still in _possession of the\ngovernment_, and of course in command of the army, in Britain.\n\n\nXL. _Triumphalia ornamenta_. Not a real triumph, which from the reign of\nAugustus was conceded only to the Emperor or the princes of the Imperial\nFamily; but triumphal insignia, such as the _corona, laurea, toga\npraetexta, tunica palmata, sella curulis_, &c. Dr.\n\n_Illustris statuae_. Called _laureata_, Ann. 4, 23; _triumphalis_, His.\n1, 79.\n\n_Quidquid datur_. Besides the _ornamenta_ above mentioned, sacrifices and\nthanksgivings were offered in the name of the victorious commander. Dr.\n\n_Addique_. Al. additque. _Addique_ is the reading of the MSS. and old\neditions. And it suits better the genius of Dom.; he did not express the\n_opinionem_ himself, for it was not his real intention, but he _ordered_\nsome one to put it in circulation as if from him, that he might have the\ncredit of it and yet not be bound by it.--_Destinari_, sc. by Domitian.\n\n_Majoribus reservatam_. _Majoribus_==illustrioribus. Syria was the\nrichest province in the Empire, and the praefectship of it the most\nhonorable office.\n\n_Ex secretioribus ministeriis_. _One of his private secretaries, or\nconfidential agents_.\n\n_Codicillos_. Under the Emperors this word is used to denote an imperial\nletter or diploma. Properly a billet, diminutive of _codex_, tablet\n(==_caudex_, trunk of a tree).\n\n_Syria dabatur_. Syria was one of the Provinces, that were at the\ndisposal of the Emperor.\n\n_Ex ingenio principis_. _In accordance with_ (cf. _ex_, G. 7) _the_\n(dissimulating) _genius or policy of Domitian_. The design, if not real,\nat least imputed to him, was to withdraw Agricola from his province and\nhis troops at all events, by the offer of the best province in the Empire\nif need be; but that object having been secured by Agricola's voluntary\nretirement, the offer, and even the ordinary civilities of life,\nespecially official life, were deemed unnecessary. Compare this with the\nconcluding sentence of the preceding chapter.\n\n_Celebritate et frequentia_. Hendiadys: _By the number of distinguished\nmen who might go out to meet him_ (and escort him into the city).\n\n_0fficio_==salutatione. Dr.--_Brevi osculo_, lit. a _hasty kiss_==_cold\nand formal salutation_. The kiss was a common mode of salutation among\nthe Romans, in the age of the Emperors. See Becker's Gallus, p. 54.\n\n_Turbae servientium_. The usual and characteristic associates, as well as\nattendants of Domitian. A severe cut, though quite incidental and very\nconcise.\n\n_Otiosos_. Antith. to _militare_. _Men in civil life_, cf. note on\n_otio_, II.\n\n_Otium auxit_. Augere otium==sequi altissimum otium. Dr.\n\n_Penitus_==inwardly, i.e. sincerely, _zealously_. So R. But Dr.==\nprorsus, omnino, valde.--_Cultu modicus. Simple in dress_, cf. note on\n_cultus_, G. 6.--_Comitatus_, passive, so used by Cic. also.--_Uno aut\naltero. One or two_.\n\n_Per ambitionem_==ex vitae splendore et numeroso comitatu. Br. cf. note\non _ambitio_, G. 27.\n\n_Quaererent--interpretarentur_. _Many inquired_ (with wonder) _into the\nreputation_ (of a man so unassuming), _and few explained_ or _understood_\n(the true reason of his humble manner of life). _Interpretarentur_, not\n_famam_ but the facts above mentioned, and the necessity A. was under of\nliving as he did.--_Viso aspectoque. On seeing him and directing their\nattention particularly to him_.\n\n\nXLI. _Crimen==public accusation_.--_Querela==private complaint_.--\n_Princeps, gloria, genus_. Supply, as a predicate, _causa periculi_;\nthese were the causes that put A's life in jeopardy.\n\n_Militares viri_==duces. So Corbulo is called, Ann. 15, 26.\n\n_Expugnati et capti_. _Defeated and taken captive_, For. and Fac.\nProperly _expugnare_ is said of a fortress or city. But _ektoliorkein_ in\nGreek is used in the same way, of persons. Compare _expugnatis\npraesidiis_, 16, note. The wars particularly referred to are those\nagainst Decebalus, leader of the Dacians, which lasted four years and in\nwhich Moesia also was invaded by the Dacians, and several Roman armies\nwith their commanders were lost (Suet. Dom. 6.); and that of the\nPannonian legions against the German tribes of the Marcomanni and the\nQuadi (Dion, 67, 7).\n\n_Hibernis--dubitatum_, i.e. the enemy not only met them on the river\nbanks, which formed the borders of the empire, but attacked the winter\nquarters of their troops, and threatened to take away the territory they\nhad already acquired.\n\n_Funeribus_, sc. militarium virorum.--_Cladibus_, sc. cohortium. Dr.\n\n_Amore et fide_. _Out of affection and fidelity_ (sc. to their imperial\nmaster).--_Malignitate et livore_. _Out of envy and hatred_ (sc. towards\nA.).\n\n_Pronum deterioribus_. _Inclined to the worse measures_, or it may be,\nto the _worse advisers_.\n\n_In ipsam--agebatur_==invito gloria aucta, simulque pernicies\naccelerata. W.\n\n\nXLII. _Asiae et Africae_. He drew lots, _which_ he should have, _both_\nbeing put into the lot.--_Proconsulatum_. See H. 1, 49. note, on\nproconsul. A. had already been consul, 9.\n\n_Sortiretur_. _In which he would, or such that he must, obtain by lot_,\netc. Cf. H. 501, I.; Z. 558.\n\n_Occiso Civica_. Cf. Suet. Dom. 10: complures senatores, et in his\naliquot consulares, interemit, ex quibus _Civicam Cerealem in ipso Asiae\nproconsulate_.\n\n_Nec Agricolae--exemplum_. _A warning was not wanting to A_. (to avoid\nthe dangerous post); _nor a precedent to Dom_. (for disposing of A. in\nthe same way if he accepted the office).\n\n_Iturusne esset_. Subj. cf. H. 525; Z. 552.--_Interrogarent_. H. 500;\nZ. 567.\n\n_In--excusatione_. _In urging his request_ (before Dom.) _to be excused_.\n\n_Paratus simulatione_. Al. simulationi. _Furnished with deceit, armed_,\nas it were, _with hypocrisy_.\n\n_In arrogantiam compositus_. _Assuming a proud demeanor_.\n\n_Beneficii invidia_, lit. _the odium of such a kindness==so odious a\nfavor_. The idea is, he did not blush to let A. return thanks for a\nsignal injury, as if it were a real kindness. \"A refinement of cruelty\nnot unfrequently practised by the worst Roman Emperors.\" Ky. The only\npeculiarity in the case of Dom. was, the unblushing impudence with which\nhe perpetrated the wrong, cf. 45. See a fine commentary on this passage\nin Sen. de Benef. 4, 17: Quis est, qui non beneficus _videri_ velit? qui\nnon inter scelera et injurias opinionem bonitatis affectet? velit quoque\n_iis videri beneficium dedisse, quos laesit? gratias itaque agi sibi ab\nhis, quos afflixere, patiuntur_.\n\n_Salarium_. Properly salt-money, i.e. a small allowance to the soldiers\nfor the purchase of salt. Cf. _clavarium_, H. 3, 50, note. But after\nAugustus, official pay, _salary_.\n\n_Ne--emisse_. _That he might not appear to have purchased a compliance\nwith his virtual prohibition_ (viz. of A.'s accepting the proconsulship).\n\n_Proprium humani_, etc. Mark the sentiment.\n\n_Irrevocabilior_. _More implacable_. Found in this sense only in T. Cf.\nB\u00c3\u00b6t. Lex. Tac.\n\n_Illicita_. Unlawful, i.e. forbidden by the powers that be. Explained by\n_contumacia_ and _inani jactatione libertatis_ above. T. is animadverting\nupon the conduct of certain stoics and republicans, who obtruded their\nopinions upon those in power, and coveted the glory of martyrdom.\n\n_Eo--excedere_. Reach the same height of distinction. _Eo_ Old dat. cf.\n_eo inopiae_ 28, note. _Excedere_, lit. come out to, _arrive at_. Cf.\nVal. Max. 5, 6, 4: _ad summum imperii fastigium excessit_.\n\n_Per abrupta_. \"Through abrupt and dangerous paths.\" Ky.\n\n_Ambitiosa morte_, i.e. morte ultro adita captandae gloriae causa apud\nposteros. For. and Fac.\n\n\nXLIII. _Luctuosus, afflictive_, is stronger than _tristis, sad_.\n\n_Vulgus_. The lower classes, _the ignorant and indolent rabble_.--\n_Populus_. _The common people, tradesmen, mechanics_, and the like.\nHence, _aliud agens_, which implies that they were too busy with\nsomething else of a private nature, to give much attention to public\naffairs or the concerns of their neighbors.--_Populus_ and _vulgus_ are\nbrought together in a similar way, Dial. de Clar. Orat. 7: Vulgus quoque\nimperitum et tunicatus hic populus, etc.\n\n_Nobis--ausim_. _I should not dare to affirm that we_ (the friends of A.)\n_found any conclusive proof_, that he was poisoned.--_Ceterum_. _But_.\nThis implies that the circumstantial evidence, which he goes on to\nspecify, convinced the writer and his friends, as well as the public,\nthat poison administered by direction of Dom., was really the means of\nhastening A. out of the world. Dion Cassius expressly affirms, that he\nwas poisoned, 66, 20.\n\n_Principatus_. The imperial government in general, i.e. former Emperors.\n\n_Momenta ipsa deficientis_. _Each successive stage of his decline_.\n_Ipsa_ is omitted in the common editions. But it rests on good authority\nand it adds to the significance of the clause: _the very moments_, as it\nwere, were reported to Dom.\n\n_Per dispositos cursores_. Dom. appears not to have been at Rome at this\ntime, but in the Alban Villa (cf. 45), or somewhere else.\n\n_Constabat_. That was an _admitted point_, about which there was entire\n_agreement_ (_con_ and _sto_).\n\n_Animo vultuque_. Hendiadys: _he wore in his countenance an expression of\nheartfelt grief_.\n\n_Securus odii_. Now, that A. was dead, Dom. had nothing to fear in regard\nto the _object of his hatred_, or the _gratification of his hate_.\n_Odii_. Gen. of the respect.--_Qui--dissimularet_. _Qui==talis, ut_,\nhence the subj. H. 501, I.; Z. 558.\n\n_Lecto testamento_. When A.'s _will was read_.\n\n_Honore judicioque_. As if a mark of honor and esteem. E. says==judicio\nhonorifico.--_Piissimae_, devoted, affectionate.\n\n_Malum principem_. It was customary for rich men at Rome, who were\nanxious to secure any of their property to their heirs, to bequeath a\npart of their estates to _bad emperors_ in order to secure the remainder\nfrom their rapacity.\n\nThis and several preceding sections present a most graphic _outline_ of\nthe _life and times_ of Dom., the more to be prized, because the full\n_picture_, which T. doubtless drew of him in the Histories, is lost. The\nHistories and the Annals are a vast portrait gallery full of such\npictures drawn to the life.\n\n\nXLIV. _Natus--excessit_. The dates assigned for A.'s birth and death, do\nnot agree with the age ascribed to him. They may be harmonized in either\nof two ways, each of which has its advocates: by reading _primum_ instead\nof _tertium_, or, which is perhaps a more probable amendment, since it\nonly alters the relative position of the two characters, by reading LIV\ninstead of LVI.\n\n_Quod si_. And if, _now if_.--_Habitum_. _Personal appearance_, cf. G. 5.\n\n_Decentior quam sublimior_. _Well proportioned, rather than tall_. R.\n\n_Nihil metus_. _Nothing to inspire fear in his countenance_. Antith. to\n_gratia--supererat_: _kindness of expression rather prevailed_. So Gr. and\nR. For this sense of _metus_, see note G. 2: ob metum. D\u00c3\u00b6d. distinguishes\nbetween _vultus_ and _oris_, making the former refer more to the _eyes_\n(as if from _volvo_, the rolling of the eye), to which it belongs to\nexpress anger and fierceness; the latter to the mouth, which is more\nexpressive of kindness.\n\n_Medio--aetatis_. We should hardly say so of a man dying at 56. But in\nDial. de Clar. Orat. T. speaks of 120 years, as _unius hominis aetas_.\n\n_Et vera bona_. T. has here in mind the distinction made by philosophers,\nparticularly the Stoics, between the virtues, which they called the only\nreal good, and the gifts of fortune, which they declared to be\nindifferent.--_Et--et, both--and_, marks the distinction more strongly.\n\n_Impleverat_. _Had enjoyed to the full_.\n\n_Consulari_. _Having attained to the rank of consul_ (the summit of a\nRoman's ambition) _and having been honored with triumphal insignia_. Al.\nconsularibus. But _consulari_ has the better authority and makes the\nbetter sense.\n\n_Opibus--contigerant_. _Great riches he did not desire; a respectable\nproperty it was his good fortune to possess_, cf. 5: medio rationis atque\nabundantiae. Al. non contigerant. But considerable property is implied in\nthe circumstances attending his will, 43, also in his not asking the\nvisual salary, 42. Dion Cass. says, however, (66, 20.), that A. spent his\nlast days in want, as well as in disgrace. For another explanation of\n_gaudebat_, cf. n. G. 6.\n\n_Quod--ominabatur_. _Quod_ is omitted in the common editions. But it is\nfound in the MSS. And it may be explained on the principle of Zeugma, by\nsupplying with _durare_ and _videre_ a verb implied in _grande solatium\ntulit_ thus: _though (sicuti) it would have been a great gratification to\nA. to behold the dawn of this auspicious age and see Trajan Emperor, of\nwhich he expressed in my hearing a sort of prophetic anticipation and\ndesire, yet (ita)_, etc. Cassius affirms (69, 12), that by auguries the\nelevation of Trajan to the throne was foretold, as early as A.U.C. 844,\ni.e. _two years before the death of A_. The reference to Trajan here, as\nin 3, marks clearly the date of the composition, cf. note, 3: augeatque\nTrajanus.\n\n_Spiramenta_. _Breathing-spells_, i.e. intervals to recover and take\nbreath in. The word is found only in poetry and post-Augustan prose, and,\nin the expressive sense in which it is here used, only in Ammian. Marc.\n29, 1. See Or. and Freund.\n\n_Velut uno ictu_. The commentators illustrate the force of this\nexpression by reference to Caligula's wish (Vid. Sen. de Va. 3, 19), that\nthe Roman people had but one neck, ut scelera sua in _unum ictum_ et unum\ndiem cogeret.\n\n\nXLV. _Non vidit_. Did not see, as he would have done, had he lived a few\nyears longer. This passage resembles Cic. de Orat. 3, 2, 8, too closely\nto be mere coincidence. Imitator tamen, id quod uni Tacito contigit,\nauctore suo praestantior. Rit.\n\n_Consularium_. Rhen. collects from Suet. the names of several victims of\nDom.'s displeasure, _who had been consuls_.\n\n_Feminarum_. Pliny has preserved the names of several of this list--\nGratilla, wife of Rusticus, Arria, wife of Thrasea, Fannia, daughter of\nThrasea and betrothed to Helvidius. Their husbands will be remembered as\nhaving been mentioned in 1 and 2.\n\n_Carus Metius_. An infamous informer, cf. Plin. Epist. 7, 19; Juv. 1, 35;\nMart. 12, 25, 5.\n\n_Censebatur_. _Was honored_, ironice. _Censeri_ est aestimari, sive\nexistimationem consequi. Dr.\n\n_Una--victoria_. He had occasioned the death of but one innocent victim.--\n_Adhuc_. Up to the death of A., cf. G. 38: adhuc, note.\n\n_Albanam arcem_. A favorite retreat of Dom. (situated at the foot of the\nAlban Mount, about seventeen miles from Rome), where he sometimes\nconvened the Senate, and held his court with its troop of informers, cf.\nnote, 43: cursores. Rit. in loc. suggests, that by the use of _arcem_\ninstead of _palatium_, T. means to represent Domitian as shutting himself\nup, like many tyrants, in a fortified castle, and thence sending forth\nthe emissaries of his jealousy and cruelty.\n\n_Sententia. His voice_, his sentiment expressed in council before Dom.--\n_Intra Albanam arcem_, i.e. _privately_, not _publicly_, as afterwards\nat Rome.\n\n_Messalini_. Fuit inter principea adulatores et delatores. Dr. cf. Plin.\nEpist. 4, 22; Juv. 4, 113, seq.\n\n_Massa Bebius_. Primus inter pares of Domitian's tools. He began his\ncareer under Vesp. cf. His. 4, 50. He was afterwards impeached and\ncondemned at the instance of the Province of Baetica, Pliny and Senecio\nadvocates for the impeachment, Plin. Epist 7, 33; 3, 4; 6, 29.--_Jam\ntum. At that very time_ on trial, not merely _already at that time_.\nCf. Hand's Tursel. 3, 113.\n\n_Nostra_, sc. of the Senate, of which T. was a member, though abroad\nat the time. Helvidius was arrested _in the senate house_, cf. Plin.\nEp. 9, 13. This was Helvidius the _son_, who was put to death by Dom.\n(Suet. 10), as his father was by Vesp. (Suet. 15).\n\n_Visus_. Al. divisus. _Visus_==species, adspectus, Wr.--_Perfudit_.\nZeugma. Understand in the first clause _horrore perfudit_ (Dr.) or probro\naffecit (R.): _the spectacle of Mauricus and Rusticus_ (hurried away, the\none to exile, the other to death), _filled us with horror; we were\nstained by the innocent blood of Senecio_. Of Rusticus and Senecio, see\n2, note. Of Mauricus, see Plin. Ep. 4, 22: quo viro nihil firmius, nihil\nverius. Also Plin. Ep. 3, 11.\n\n_Videre_, sc. Domitianum.--_Aspici_, sc. a Domitiano. For difference in\nthe signification in these words, cf. 40: viso aspectoque, note.\n\n_Suspiria--subscriberentur. When our sighs_ (of sympathy with the\ncondemned) _were registered against us_ (by spies and informers, as a\nground of accusation before the Emperor).\n\n_Rubor_. Redness, referring to the complexion of Dom., which was such as\nto conceal a blush, cf. Suet. Dom. 18: vultu ruboris pleno.\n\n_Opportunitate mortis_. An expression of Cic., in the similar passage\nabove cited (de Orat. 3, 2, 8), touching the death of Crassus.\n\n_Pro virili portione_, lit. for one man's share, referring primarily to\npecuniary assessments. Here: _for thy part--so far as thou wast\nconcerned_. A. died with a calmness which would scarcely admit of the\nsupposition, that he felt himself to be a victim of poison and imperial\njealousy.\n\n_Filiaque ejus_. The apostrophe is here dropped to be resumed at _optime\nparentum_. So the MSS. For they read _ejus_ here, and _amissus est_\nbelow. Rhenanus omitted _ejus_, and wrote _es_ for _est_; and he has been\nfollowed in the common editions since.\n\n_Conditione_. By the circumstance, or by virtue of our long absence. T.\nand his wife had parted with A. four years before his death, and had been\nabsent from Rome ever since, where or why does not appear.\n\n_Superfuere_. Cf. _superest_, G. 6, note.\n\n\nXLVI. _Sapientibus_. Cf. _sapientiae professoribus_, 2, note.--_Te\nimmortalibus laudibus_. I feel constrained to recur to the reading of\nLipsius and Ritter, it is so much more spirited than _quam temporalibus_.\n_Potius_ manifestly should refer back to _lugeri_ and _plangi_. The\ncomparison contained in the more common reading is uncalled for in the\nconnection, and of little significance in itself. The MSS. read\n_temporalibus laudibus_ without _quam_ and this may be more easily\nresolved into _te immortalibus_, than _quam_ can be supplied.--\n_Similitudine_. Al. aemulatione. For such a use of similitudo, cf. Cic.\nTusc. Quaest. 1, 46, 110: quorum (sc. Curii, Fabricii, Scipionum, etc.),\n_similitudinem_ aliquam qui arripuerit, etc.\n\n_Decoremus_. Ennius (cited by Cic. Tusc. Q. 1, 49, 117, and de Senect.\n20, 73), uses the same word in expressing the same sentiment: nemo me\nlacrumis _decoret_ nec funera fletu faxit. Cf. also G. 28.\n\n_Formam_. This makes the sense so much better (than _famam_), that E. Dr.\nWr. R. and most others have adopted it against the authority of the MSS.\ncf. _forma mentis_, below, and Cic. passim.\n\n_Intercedendum. To be prohibited_. Properly said of a _veto interposed_\nby the Tribunes; then of any prohibition.--_Non quia==not that_, is\ncharacteristic of late writers. It is followed by the subj. Z. 537, and\nnote H. 1, 15.\n\n_Manet, mansurumque est_. Cf. Vell. Paterc. 2, 66, 5: vivit, vivetque per\nomnem saeculorum memoriam. The periphrastic form (_mansurum est_) differs\nhowever from the future (_manebit_), as our _is to remain_ from _will\nremain_. See Z. 498.\n\n_Oblivio obruet_, sc. for want of a historian, carent quia _vate sacro_,\ncf. Hor. Od. 4, 9, 25, seq. By _multos veterum_, T. means many ancients\nof _real worth_. So _velut_ implies. A. is to be immortalized through his\nbiographer. This is implied in _narratus et traditus_. Ancient authors\nthought it not improper to express a calm consciousness of merit and a\nproud confidence of immortality. T. is very modest and delicate in the\nmanner of intimating his expectations. But the sentiment of these last\nwords is substantially the same with the line of Horace: Exegi monumentum\naere perennius. The whole peroration of this Biography is one of singular\nbeauty and moral elevation. Pathetic, yet calm, rich in noble sentiments\nand animated by the purest and loftiest spirit, it is a fit topstone to\nthat monument, in respect to which T. felt so well founded an assurance,\nwhich still _manet mansurumque est in animis hominum, in aeternitate\ntemporum, fama rerum_. There is scarcely an educated youth in Christendom\nwho is not as familiar with the name of Agricola, as with that of Aeneas\nand Ulysses. And the only reason why we know anything of these heroes, is\nthe genius of their respective biographers. There had been other\nAgricolas before the age of Trajan, as there had been other heroes like\nAeneas, and other wandering sages like Ulysses, before the war of Troy.\nBut they found no Tacitus, Virgil, and Homer to record their adventurous\nand virtuous deeds. It is the prerogative of eminent writers to confer\nimmortality; and though Alexander would prefer to be Achilles rather than\nHomer, we should have known little of his achievements, had he not\nencouraged scholars as well as warriors, and rewarded genius no less than\nvalor.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Germania and Agricola, by Caius Cornelius Tacitus\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GERMANIA AND AGRICOLA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9090-8.txt or 9090-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/9\/0\/9\/9090\/\n\nProduced by David Starner, Tapio Riikonen and Distributed Proofreaders\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1373,"split":"test"}
