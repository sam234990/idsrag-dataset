{"ori_id":"8b68fcbf0b9d48dcdbf55abfec3a09c3caa16a1b","title":"Clotel","context":"Clotel\n The narrative of Clotel plays with history by relating the \"perilous antebellum adventures\" of a young mixed-race slave Currer and her two light-skinned daughters fathered by Thomas Jefferson. Because the mother is a slave, according to partus sequitur ventrem, which Virginia adopted into law in 1662, her daughters are born into slavery. The book includes \"several sub-plots\" related to other slaves, religion and anti-slavery. Currer, described as \"a bright mulatto\" (meaning light-skinned) gives birth to two \"near white\" daughters: Clotel and Althesa.\nAfter the death of Jefferson, Currer and her daughters are sold as slaves. Horatio Green, a white man, purchases Clotel and takes her as a common-law wife. They cannot legally marry under state laws against miscegenation.\nHer mother Currer and sister Althesa remain \"in a slave gang.\" Currer is eventually purchased by Mr. Peck, a preacher. She is enslaved until she dies from yellow fever, shortly before Peck's daughter was preparing to emancipate her.\nAlthesa marries her white master, Henry Morton, a Northerner, by passing as a white woman. They have daughters Jane and Ellen, who are educated. Although supporting abolition, Morton fails to manumit Althesa and their daughters. After Althesa and Morton both die, their daughters are enslaved. Ellen commits suicide to escape sexual enslavement, and Jane dies in slavery from heartbreak.\nGreen and Clotel have a daughter Mary, also mixed race of course, and majority white. When Green becomes ambitious and involved in local politics, he abandons his relationship with Clotel and Mary. He marries \"a white woman who forces him to sell Clotel and enslave his child.\"\nClotel is sold to a planter in Vicksburg, Mississippi. There she meets William, another slave, and they plan a bold escape. Dressing as a white man, Clotel is accompanied by William acting as her slave; they travel and gain freedom by reaching the free state of Ohio. (This is based on the tactics of the 1849 escape by Ellen Craft and William Craft). William continues his flight to Canada (an estimated 30,000 fugitive slaves reached there by 1852). Clotel returns to Virginia to try to free her daughter Mary. After being captured in Richmond, Clotel is taken to Washington, DC for sale at its slave market. She escapes and is pursued through the city by slave catchers. Surrounded by them on the Long Bridge, she commits suicide by jumping to her death in the Potomac River.\nThus died Clotel, the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, a president of the United States.\n\u7ab6\u62ab\ufffd\u7ab6\u5e74arrator of Clotel, Page 182\nMary is forced to work as a domestic slave for her father Horatio Green and his white wife. She arranges to trade places in prison with her lover, the slave George. He escapes to Canada. Sold to a slave trader, Mary is purchased by a French man who takes her to Europe. Ten years later, after the Frenchman's death, George and Mary reunite by chance in Dunkirk, France. The novel ends with their marriage.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg Etext of Clotel; or, The President's Daughter\nby William Wells Brown\n(1853 edition)\n\nSee Apr 1995 Clotelle; or The Colored Heroine by Wm Wells Brown\n[clotlxxx.xxx] 241   Based on a separate source edition.\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

From the introduction\nof slaves in 1620, down to the period of the separation of the\nColonies from the British Crown, the number had increased to five\nhundred thousand; now there are nearly four million.  In fifteen\nof the thirty-one States, Slavery is made lawful by the\nConstitution, which binds the several States into one\nconfederacy.\n\nOn every foot of soil, over which Stars and Stripes wave, the\nNegro is considered common property, on which any white man may\nlay his hand with perfect impunity.  The entire white population\nof the United States, North and South, are bound by their oath to\nthe constitution, and their adhesion to the Fugitive Slaver Law,\nto hunt down the runaway slave and return him to his claimant,\nand to suppress any effort that may be made by the slaves to gain\ntheir freedom by physical force.  Twenty-five millions of whites\nhave banded themselves in solemn conclave to keep four millions of\nblacks in their chains.  In all grades of society are to be found\nmen who either hold, buy, or sell slaves, from the statesmen and\ndoctors of divinity, who can own their hundreds, down to the\nperson who can purchase but one.\n\nWere it not for persons in high places owning slaves, and thereby\ngiving the system a reputation, and especially professed\nChristians, Slavery would long since have been abolished.  The\ninfluence of the great \"honours the corruption, and chastisement\ndoth therefore hide his head.\"  The great aim of the true friends\nof the slave should be to lay bare the institution, so that the\ngaze of the world may be upon it, and cause the wise, the prudent,\nand the pious to withdraw their support from it, and leave it to\nits own fate.  It does the cause of emancipation but little good\nto cry out in tones of execration against the traders, the\nkidnappers, the hireling overseers, and brutal drivers, so long\nas nothing is said to fasten the guilt on those who move in a\nhigher circle.\n\nThe fact that slavery was introduced into the American colonies,\nwhile they were under the control of the British Crown, is a\nsufficient reason why Englishmen should feel a lively interest in\nits abolition; and now that the genius of mechanical invention has\nbrought the two countries so near together, and both having one\nlanguage and one literature, the influence of British public\nopinion is very great on the people of the New World.\n\nIf the incidents set forth in the following pages should add\nanything new to the information already given to the Public\nthrough similar publications, and should thereby aid in bringing\nBritish influence to bear upon American slavery, the main object\nfor which this work was written will have been accomplished.\n\n\nW.

Society\ndoes not frown upon the man who sits with his mulatto child upon\nhis knee, whilst its mother stands a slave behind his chair.  The\nlate Henry Clay, some years since, predicted that the abolition\nof Negro slavery would be brought about by the amalgamation of\nthe races.  John Randolph, a distinguished slaveholder of\nVirginia, and a prominent statesman, said in a speech in the\nlegislature of his native state, that \"the blood of the first\nAmerican statesmen coursed through the veins of the slave of the\nSouth.\"  In all the cities and towns of the slave states, the real\nNegro, or clear black, does not amount to more than one in every\nfour of the slave population.  This fact is, of itself, the best\nevidence of the degraded and immoral condition of the relation of\nmaster and slave in the United States of America.  In all the\nslave states, the law says:--\"Slaves shall be deemed, sold [held],\ntaken, reputed, and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in the\nhands of their owners and possessors, and their executors,\nadministrators and assigns, to all intents, constructions, and\npurposes whatsoever.  A slave is one who is in the power of a\nmaster to whom he belongs.  The master may sell him, dispose of\nhis person, his industry, and his labour.  He can do nothing,\npossess nothing, nor acquire anything, but what must belong to\nhis master.  The slave is entirely subject to the will of his\nmaster, who may correct and chastise him, though not with unusual\nrigour, or so as to maim and mutilate him, or expose him to the\ndanger of loss of life, or to cause his death.  The slave, to\nremain a slave, must be sensible that there is no appeal from his\nmaster.\"  Where the slave is placed by law entirely under the\ncontrol of the man who claims him, body and soul, as property,\nwhat else could be expected than the most depraved social\ncondition?  The marriage relation, the oldest and most sacred\ninstitution given to man by his Creator, is unknown and\nunrecognised in the slave laws of the United States.  Would that\nwe could say, that the moral and religious teaching in the slave\nstates were better than the laws; but, alas! we cannot.  A few\nyears since, some slaveholders became a little uneasy in their\nminds about the rightfulness of permitting slaves to take to\nthemselves husbands and wives, while they still had others\nliving, and applied to their religious teachers for advice; and\nthe following will show how this grave and important subject was\ntreated:--\n\n\"Is a servant, whose husband or wife has been sold by his or her\nmaster into a distant country, to be permitted to marry again?\"\n\nThe query was referred to a committee, who made the following\nreport; which, after discussion, was adopted:--\n\n\"That, in view of the circumstances in which servants in this\ncountry are placed, the committee are unanimous in the opinion,\nthat it is better to permit servants thus circumstanced to take\nanother husband or wife.\"\n\nSuch was the answer from a committee of the \"Shiloh Baptist\nAssociation;\" and instead of receiving light, those who asked the\nquestion were plunged into deeper darkness!  A similar question\nwas put to the \"Savannah River Association,\" and the answer, as\nthe following will show, did not materially differ from the one\nwe have already given:--\n\n\"Whether, in a case of involuntary separation, of such a character\nas to preclude all prospect of future intercourse, the parties\nought to be allowed to marry again.\"\n\nAnswer:--\n\n\"That such separation among persons situated as our slaves are, is\ncivilly a separation by death; and they believe that, in the\nsight of God, it would be so viewed.  To forbid second marriages\nin such cases would be to expose the parties, not only to stronger\nhardships and strong temptation, but to church-censure for acting\nin obedience to their masters, who cannot be expected to\nacquiesce in a regulation at variance with justice to the slaves,\nand to the spirit of that command which regulates marriage among\nChristians.  The slaves are not free agents; and a dissolution by\ndeath is not more entirely without their consent, and beyond their\ncontrol than by such separation.\"\n\nAlthough marriage, as the above indicates, is a matter which the\nslaveholders do not think is of any importance, or of any binding\nforce with their slaves; yet it would be doing that degraded\nclass an injustice, not to acknowledge that many of them do\nregard it as a sacred obligation, and show a willingness to obey\nthe commands of God on this subject.  Marriage is, indeed, the\nfirst and most important institution of human existence--the\nfoundation of all civilisation and culture--the root of church\nand state.  It is the most intimate covenant of heart formed\namong mankind; and for many persons the only relation in which\nthey feel the true sentiments of humanity.  It gives scope for\nevery human virtue, since each of these is developed from the\nlove and confidence which here predominate.  It unites all which\nennobles and beautifies life,--sympathy, kindness of will and\ndeed, gratitude, devotion, and every delicate, intimate feeling.\nAs the only asylum for true education, it is the first and last\nsanctuary of human culture.  As husband and wife, through each\nother become conscious of complete humanity, and every human\nfeeling, and every human virtue; so children, at their first\nawakening in the fond covenant of love between parents, both of\nwhom are tenderly concerned for the same object, find an image of\ncomplete humanity leagued in free love.  The spirit of love which\nprevails between them acts with creative power upon the young\nmind, and awakens every germ of goodness within it.  This\ninvisible and incalculable influence of parental life acts more\nupon the child than all the efforts of education, whether by\nmeans of instruction, precept, or exhortation.  If this be a true\npicture of the vast influence for good of the institution of\nmarriage, what must be the moral degradation of that people to\nwhom marriage is denied?  Not content with depriving them of all\nthe higher and holier enjoyments of this relation, by degrading\nand darkening their souls, the slaveholder denies to his victim\neven that slight alleviation of his misery, which would result\nfrom the marriage relation being protected by law and public\nopinion.  Such is the influence of slavery in the United States,\nthat the ministers of religion, even in the so-called free\nstates, are the mere echoes, instead of the correctors, of public\nsentiment.  We have thought it advisable to show that the present\nsystem of chattel slavery in America undermines the entire social\ncondition of man, so as to prepare the reader for the following\nnarrative of slave life, in that otherwise happy and prosperous\ncountry.\n\nIn all the large towns in the Southern States, there is a class\nof slaves who are permitted to hire their time of their owners,\nand for which they pay a high price.  These are mulatto women, or\nquadroons, as they are familiarly known, and are distinguished\nfor their fascinating beauty.  The handsomest usually pays the\nhighest price for her time.  Many of these women are the\nfavourites of persons who furnish them with the means of paying\ntheir owners, and not a few are dressed in the most extravagant\nmanner.  Reader, when you take into consideration the fact, that\namongst the slave population no safeguard is thrown around\nvirtue, and no inducement held out to slave women to be chaste,\nyou will not be surprised when we tell you that immorality and\nvice pervade the cities of the Southern States in a manner\nunknown in the cities and towns of the Northern States.  Indeed\nmost of the slave women have no higher aspiration than that of\nbecoming the finely-dressed mistress of some white man.  And at\nNegro balls and parties, this class of women usually cut the\ngreatest figure.\n\nAt the close of the year, the following advertisement appeared in a\nnewspaper published in Richmond, the capital of the state of\nVirginia:--\"Notice: Thirty-eight Negroes will be offered for sale\non Monday, November 10th, at twelve o'clock, being the entire\nstock of the late John Graves, Esq.  The Negroes are in good\ncondition, some of them very prime; among them are several\nmechanics, able-bodied field hands, ploughboys, and women with\nchildren at the breast, and some of them very prolific in their\ngenerating qualities, affording a rare opportunity to any one who\nwishes to raise a strong and healthy lot of servants for their\nown use.  Also several mulatto girls of rare personal qualities:\ntwo of them very superior.  Any gentleman or lady wishing to\npurchase, can take any of the above slaves on trial for a week,\nfor which no charge will be made.\"  Amongst the above slaves to be\nsold were Currer and her two daughters, Clotel and Althesa; the\nlatter were the girls spoken of in the advertisement as \"very\nsuperior.\"  Currer was a bright mulatto, and of prepossessing\nappearance, though then nearly forty years of age.  She had hired\nher time for more than twenty years, during which time she had\nlived in Richmond.  In her younger days Currer had been the\nhousekeeper of a young slaveholder; but of later years had been a\nlaundress or washerwoman, and was considered to be a woman of\ngreat taste in getting up linen.  The gentleman for whom she had\nkept house was Thomas Jefferson, by whom she had two daughters.\nJefferson being called to Washington to fill a government\nappointment, Currer was left behind, and thus she took herself to\nthe business of washing, by which means she paid her master, Mr.\nGraves, and supported herself and two children.  At the time of the\ndecease of her master, Currer's daughters, Clotel and Althesa,\nwere aged respectively sixteen and fourteen years, and both, like\nmost of their own sex in America, were well grown.  Currer early\nresolved to bring her daughters up as ladies, as she termed it,\nand therefore imposed little or no work upon them.  As her\ndaughters grew older, Currer had to pay a stipulated price for\nthem; yet her notoriety as a laundress of the first class enabled\nher to put an extra price upon her charges, and thus she and her\ndaughters lived in comparative luxury.  To bring up Clotel and\nAlthesa to attract attention, and especially at balls and\nparties, was the great aim of Currer.  Although the term \"Negro\nball\" is applied to most of these gatherings, yet a majority of\nthe attendants are often whites.  Nearly all the Negro parties in\nthe cities and towns of the Southern States are made up of\nquadroon and mulatto girls, and white men.  These are democratic\ngatherings, where gentlemen, shopkeepers, and their clerks, all\nappear upon terms of perfect equality.  And there is a degree of\ngentility and decorum in these companies that is not surpassed by\nsimilar gatherings of white people in the Slave States.  It was at\none of these parties that Horatio Green, the son of a wealthy\ngentleman of Richmond, was first introduced to Clotel.  The young\nman had just returned from college, and was in his twenty-second\nyear.  Clotel was sixteen, and was admitted by all to be the most\nbeautiful girl, coloured or white, in the city.  So attentive was\nthe young man to the quadroon during the evening that it was\nnoticed by all, and became a matter of general conversation;\nwhile Currer appeared delighted beyond measure at her daughter's\nconquest.  From that evening, young Green became the favourite\nvisitor at Currer's house.  He soon promised to purchase Clotel, as\nspeedily as it could be effected, and make her mistress of her\nown dwelling; and Currer looked forward with pride to the time\nwhen she should see her daughter emancipated and free.  It was a\nbeautiful moonlight night in August, when all who reside in\ntropical climes are eagerly gasping for a breath of fresh air,\nthat Horatio Green was seated in the small garden behind Currer's\ncottage, with the object of his affections by his side.  And it\nwas here that Horatio drew from his pocket the newspaper, wet from\nthe press, and read the advertisement for the sale of the slaves\nto which we have alluded; Currer and her two daughters being of\nthe number.  At the close of the evening's visit, and as the young\nman was leaving, he said to the girl, \"You shall soon be free and\nyour own mistress.\"\n\nAs might have been expected, the day of sale brought an unusual\nlarge number together to compete for the property to be sold.\nFarmers who make a business of raising slaves for the market were\nthere; slave-traders and speculators were also numerously\nrepresented; and in the midst of this throng was one who felt a\ndeeper interest in the result of the sale than any other of the\nbystanders; this was young Green.  True to his promise, he was\nthere with a blank bank check in his pocket, awaiting with\nimpatience to enter the list as a bidder for the beautiful slave.\nThe less valuable slaves were first placed upon the auction\nblock, one after another, and sold to the highest bidder.\nHusbands and wives were separated with a degree of indifference\nthat is unknown in any other relation of life, except that of\nslavery.  Brothers and sisters were torn from each other; and\nmothers saw their children leave them for the last time on this\nearth.\n\nIt was late in the day, when the greatest number of persons were\nthought to be present, that Currer and her daughters were brought\nforward to the place of sale.--Currer was first ordered to ascend\nthe auction stand, which she did with a trembling step.  The slave\nmother was sold to a trader.  Althesa, the youngest, and who was\nscarcely less beautiful than her sister, was sold to the same\ntrader for one thousand dollars.  Clotel was the last, and, as was\nexpected, commanded a higher price than any that had been offered\nfor sale that day.  The appearance of Clotel on the auction block\ncreated a deep sensation amongst the crowd.  There she stood, with\na complexion as white as most of those who were waiting with a\nwish to become her purchasers; her features as finely defined as\nany of her sex of pure Anglo-Saxon; her long black wavy hair done\nup in the neatest manner; her form tall and graceful, and her\nwhole appearance indicating one superior to her position.  The\nauctioneer commenced by saying, that \"Miss Clotel had been\nreserved for the last, because she was the most valuable.  How\nmuch, gentlemen?  Real Albino, fit for a fancy girl for any one.\nShe enjoys good health, and has a sweet temper.  How much do you\nsay?\"  \"Five hundred dollars.\"  \"Only five hundred for such a girl\nas this?  Gentlemen, she is worth a deal more than that sum; you\ncertainly don't know the value of the article you are bidding\nupon.  Here, gentlemen, I hold in my hand a paper certifying that\nshe has a good moral character.\"  \"Seven hundred.\"  \"Ah; gentlemen,\nthat is something like.  This paper also states that she is very\nintelligent.\"  \"Eight hundred.\"  \"She is a devoted Christian, and\nperfectly trustworthy.\"  \"Nine hundred.\"  \"Nine fifty.\"  \"Ten.\"\n\"Eleven.\"  \"Twelve hundred.\"  Here the sale came to a dead stand.\nThe auctioneer stopped, looked around, and began in a rough\nmanner to relate some anecdotes relative to the sale of slaves,\nwhich, he said, had come under his own observation.  At this\njuncture the scene was indeed strange.  Laughing, joking,\nswearing, smoking, spitting, and talking kept up a continual hum\nand noise amongst the crowd; while the slave-girl stood with\ntears in her eyes, at one time looking towards her mother and\nsister, and at another towards the young man whom she hoped would\nbecome her purchaser.  \"The chastity of this girl is pure; she has\nnever been from under her mother's care; she is a virtuous\ncreature.\"  \"Thirteen.\"  \"Fourteen.\"  \"Fifteen.\"  \"Fifteen hundred\ndollars,\" cried the auctioneer, and the maiden was struck for\nthat sum.  This was a Southern auction, at which the bones,\nmuscles, sinews, blood, and nerves of a young lady of sixteen\nwere sold for five hundred dollars; her moral character for two\nhundred; her improved intellect for one hundred; her\nChristianity for three hundred; and her chastity and virtue for\nfour hundred dollars more.  And this, too, in a city thronged with\nchurches, whose tall spires look like so many signals pointing to\nheaven, and whose ministers preach that slavery is a God-ordained\ninstitution!  What words can tell the inhumanity, the atrocity,\nand the immorality of that doctrine which, from exalted office,\ncommends such a crime to the favour of enlightened and Christian\npeople?  What indignation from all the world is not due to the\ngovernment and people who put forth all their strength and power\nto keep in existence such an institution?  Nature abhors it; the\nage repels it; and Christianity needs all her meekness to forgive\nit.  Clotel was sold for fifteen hundred dollars, but her purchaser\nwas Horatio Green.  Thus closed a Negro sale, at which two\ndaughters of Thomas Jefferson, the writer of the Declaration of\nAmerican Independence, and one of the presidents of the great\nrepublic, were disposed of to the highest bidder!\n\n     \"O God!  my every heart-string cries,\n     Dost thou these scenes behold\n     In this our boasted Christian land,\n     And must the truth be told?\n\n     \"Blush, Christian, blush! for e'en the dark,\n     Untutored heathen see\n     Thy inconsistency; and, lo!\n     They scorn thy God, and thee!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGOING TO THE SOUTH\n\n    \"My country, shall thy honoured name,\n     Be as a bye-word through the world?\n     Rouse! for, as if to blast thy fame,\n    This keen reproach is at thee hurled;\n       The banner that above the waves,\n   Is floating o'er three million slaves.\"\n\nDICK WALKER, the slave speculator, who had purchased Currer and\nAlthesa, put them in prison until his gang was made up, and then,\nwith his forty slaves, started for the New Orleans market.  As\nmany of the slaves had been brought up in Richmond, and had\nrelations residing there, the slave trader determined to leave\nthe city early in the morning, so as not to witness any of those\nscenes so common where slaves are separated from their relatives\nand friends, when about departing for the Southern market.  This\nplan was successful; for not even Clotel, who had been every day\nat the prison to see her mother and sister, knew of their\ndeparture.  A march of eight days through the interior of the\nstate, and they arrived on the banks of the Ohio river, where\nthey were all put on board a steamer, and then speedily sailed\nfor the place of their destination.\n\nWalker had already advertised in the New Orleans papers, that he\nwould be there at a stated time with \"a prime lot of able bodied\nslaves ready for field service; together with a few extra ones,\nbetween the ages of fifteen and twenty-five.\"  But, like most who\nmake a business of buying and selling slaves for gain, he often\nbought some who were far advanced in years, and would always try\nto sell them for five or ten years younger than they actually\nwere.  Few persons can arrive at anything like the age of a Negro,\nby mere observation, unless they are well acquainted with the\nrace.  Therefore the slave-trader very frequently carried out this\ndeception with perfect impunity.  After the steamer had left the\nwharf, and was fairly on the bosom of the Father of Waters,\nWalker called his servant Pompey to him, and instructed him as to\n\"getting the Negroes ready for market.\"  Amongst the forty Negroes\nwere several whose appearance indicated that they had seen some\nyears, and had gone through some services.  Their grey hair and\nwhiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in\nthe trader's advertisement.  Pompey had long been with the trader,\nand knew his business; and if he did not take delight in\ndischarging his duty, he did it with a degree of alacrity, so\nthat he might receive the approbation of his master.  \"Pomp,\" as\nWalker usually called him, was of real Negro blood, and would\noften say, when alluding to himself, \"Dis nigger is no countefit;\nhe is de genewine artekil.\"  Pompey was of low stature, round\nface, and, like most of his race, had a set of teeth, which for\nwhiteness and beauty could not be surpassed; his eyes large, lips\nthick, and hair short and woolly.  Pompey had been with Walker so\nlong, and had seen so much of the buying and selling of slaves,\nthat he appeared perfectly indifferent to the heartrending scenes\nwhich daily occurred in his presence.  It was on the second day of\nthe steamer's voyage that Pompey selected five of the old slaves,\ntook them in a room by themselves, and commenced preparing them\nfor the market.  \"Well,\" said Pompey, addressing himself to the\ncompany, \"I is de gentman dat is to get you ready, so dat you\nwill bring marser a good price in de Orleans market.  How old is\nyou?\" addressing himself to a man who, from appearance, was not\nless than forty.\n\n\"If I live to see next corn-planting time I will either be\nforty-five or fifty-five, I don't know which.\"\n\n\"Dat may be,\" replied Pompey; \"But now you is only thirty years\nold; dat is what marser says you is to be.\"\n\n\"I know I is more den dat,\" responded the man.\n\n\"I knows nothing about dat,\" said Pompey; \"but when you get in de\nmarket, an anybody axe you how old you is, an you tell 'em\nforty-five, marser will tie you up an gib you de whip like smoke.\nBut if you tell 'em dat you is only thirty, den he wont.\"\n\n\"Well den, I guess I will only be thirty when dey axe me,\"\nreplied the chattel.\n\n\"What your name?\" inquired Pompey.\n\n\"Geemes,\" answered the man.\n\n\"Oh, Uncle Jim, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Den you must have off dem dare whiskers of yours, an when you\nget to Orleans you must grease dat face an make it look shiney.\"\nThis was all said by Pompey in a manner which clearly showed that\nhe knew what he was about.\n\n\"How old is you?\" asked Pompey of a tall, strong-looking man.\n\n\"I was twenty-nine last potato-digging time,\" said the man.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Tobias, but dey call me 'Toby.'\"\n\n\"Well, Toby, or Mr. Tobias, if dat will suit you better, you is\nnow twenty-three years old, an no more.  Dus you hear dat?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded Toby.\n\nPompey gave each to understand how old he was to be when asked by\npersons who wished to purchase, and then reported to his master\nthat the \"old boys\" were all right.  At eight o'clock on the\nevening of the third day, the lights of another steamer were seen\nin the distance, and apparently coming up very fast.  This was a\nsignal for a general commotion on the Patriot, and everything\nindicated that a steamboat race was at hand.  Nothing can exceed\nthe excitement attendant upon a steamboat race on the Mississippi\nriver.  By the time the boats had reached Memphis, they were side\nby side, and each exerting itself to keep the ascendancy in point\nof speed.  The night was clear, the moon shining brightly, and the\nboats so near to each other that the passengers were calling out\nfrom one boat to the other.  On board the Patriot, the firemen\nwere using oil, lard, butter, and even bacon, with the wood, for\nthe purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch.  The blaze,\nmingled with the black smoke, showed plainly that the other boat\nwas burning more than wood.  The two boats soon locked, so that\nthe hands of the boats were passing from vessel to vessel, and\nthe wildest excitement prevailed throughout amongst both\npassengers and crew.  At this moment the engineer of the Patriot\nwas seen to fasten down the safety-valve, so that no steam should\nescape.  This was, indeed, a dangerous resort.  A few of the boat\nhands who saw what had taken place, left that end of the boat for\nmore secure quarters.\n\nThe Patriot stopped to take in passengers, and still no steam was\npermitted to escape.  At the starting of the boat cold water was\nforced into the boilers by the machinery, and, as might have been\nexpected, one of the boilers immediately exploded.  One dense fog\nof steam filled every part of the vessel, while shrieks, groans,\nand cries were heard on every hand.  The saloons and cabins soon\nhad the appearance of a hospital.  By this time the boat had\nlanded, and the Columbia, the other boat, had come alongside to\nrender assistance to the disabled steamer.  The killed and scalded\n(nineteen in number) were put on shore, and the Patriot, taken in\ntow by the Columbia, was soon again on its way.\n\nIt was now twelve o'clock at night, and instead of the passengers\nbeing asleep the majority were ambling in the saloons.  Thousands\nof dollars change hands during a passage from Louisville or St.\nLouis to New Orleans on a Mississippi steamer, and many men, and\neven ladies, are completely ruined.\n\n\"Go call my boy, steward,\" said Mr. Smith, as he took his cards\none by one from the table.  In a few moments a fine looking,\nbright-eyed mulatto boy, apparently about fifteen years of age,\nwas standing by his master's side at the table.  \"I will see you,\nand five hundred dollars better,\" said Smith, as his servant\nJerry approached the table.\n\n\"What price do you set on that boy?\" asked Johnson, as he took a\nroll of bills from his pocket.\n\n\"He will bring a thousand dollars, any day, in the New Orleans\nmarket,\" replied Smith.\n\n\"Then you bet the whole of the boy, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I call you, then,\" said Johnson, at the same time spreading his\ncards out upon the table.\n\n\"You have beat me,\" said Smith, as soon as he saw the cards.\nJerry, who was standing on top of the table, with the bank notes\nand silver dollars round his feet, was now ordered to descend\nfrom the table.\n\n\"You will not forget that you belong to me,\" said Johnson, as the\nyoung slave was stepping from the table to a chair.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied the chattel.\n\n\"Now go back to your bed, and be up in time to-morrow morning to\nbrush my clothes and clean my boots, do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded Jerry, as he wiped the tears from his eyes.\n\nSmith took from his pocket the bill of sale and handed it to\nJohnson; at the same time saying, \"I claim the right of redeeming\nthat boy, Mr. Johnson.  My father gave him to me when I came of\nage, and I promised not to part with him.\"\n\n\"Most certainly, sir, the boy shall be yours, whenever you hand me\nover a cool thousand,\" replied Johnson.  The next morning, as the\npassengers were assembling in the breakfast saloons and upon the\nguards of the vessel, and the servants were seen running about\nwaiting upon or looking for their masters, poor Jerry was\nentering his new master's stateroom with his boots.\n\n\"Who do you belong to?\" said a gentleman to an old black man, who\ncame along leading a fine dog that he had been feeding.\n\n\"When I went to sleep last night, I belonged to Governor Lucas;\nbut I understand dat he is bin gambling all night, so I don't\nknow who owns me dis morning.\"  Such is the uncertainty of a\nslave's position.  He goes to bed at night the property of the man\nwith whom he has lived for years, and gets up in the morning the\nslave of some one whom he has never seen before!  To behold five\nor six tables in a steamboat's cabin, with half-a-dozen men\nplaying at cards, and money, pistols, bowie-knives, all in\nconfusion on the tables, is what may be seen at almost any time\non the Mississippi river.\n\nOn the fourth day, while at Natchez, taking in freight and\npassengers, Walker, who had been on shore to see some of his old\ncustomers, returned, accompanied by a tall, thin-faced man,\ndressed in black, with a white neckcloth, which immediately\nproclaimed him to be a clergyman.  \"I want a good, trusty woman\nfor house service,\" said the stranger, as they entered the cabin\nwhere Walker's slaves were kept.\n\n\"Here she is, and no mistake,\" replied the trader.\n\n\"Stand up, Currer, my gal; here's a gentleman who wishes to see if\nyou will suit him.\"\n\nAlthesa clung to her mother's side, as the latter rose from her\nseat.\n\n\"She is a rare cook, a good washer, and will suit you to a T, I am\nsure.\"\n\n\"If you buy me, I hope you will buy my daughter too,\" said the\nwoman, in rather an excited manner.\n\n\"I only want one for my own use, and would not need another,\" said\nthe man in black, as he and the trader left the room.  Walker and\nthe parson went into the saloon, talked over the matter, the bill\nof sale was made out, the money paid over, and the clergyman left,\nwith the understanding that the woman should be delivered to him\nat his house.  It seemed as if poor Althesa would have wept\nherself to death, for the first two days after her mother had\nbeen torn from her side by the hand of the ruthless trafficker in\nhuman flesh.  On the arrival of the boat at Baton Rouge, an\nadditional number of passengers were taken on board; and, amongst\nthem, several persons who had been attending the races.  Gambling\nand drinking were now the order of the day.  Just as the ladies and\ngentlemen were assembling at the supper-table, the report of a\npistol was heard in the direction of the Social Hall, which caused\ngreat uneasiness to the ladies, and took the gentlemen to that\npart of the cabin.  However, nothing serious had occurred.  A man\nat one of the tables where they were gambling had been seen\nattempting to conceal a card in his sleeve, and one of the party\nseized his pistol and fired; but fortunately the barrel of the\npistol was knocked up, just as it was about to be discharged, and\nthe ball passed through the upper deck, instead of the man's\nhead, as intended.  Order was soon restored; all went on well the\nremainder of the night, and the next day, at ten o'clock, the\nboat arrived at New Orleans, and the passengers went to the\nhotels and the slaves to the market!\n\n\n   \"Our eyes are yet on Afric's shores,\n  Her thousand wrongs we still deplore;\n   We see the grim slave trader there;\n  We hear his fettered victim's prayer;\n    And hasten to the sufferer's aid,\n   Forgetful of our own 'slave trade.'\n\n   \"The Ocean 'Pirate's' fiend-like form\n Shall sink beneath the vengeance-storm;\n  His heart of steel shall quake before\n      The battle-din and havoc roar:\n The knave shall die, the Law hath said,\n While it protects our own 'slave trade.'\n\n    \"What earthly eye presumes to scan\n     The wily Proteus-heart of man?--\n    What potent hand will e'er unroll\n   The mantled treachery of his soul!--\n     O where is he who hath surveyed\n  The horrors of our own 'slave trade?'\n\n  \"There is an eye that wakes in light,\n    There is a hand of peerless might;\n  Which, soon or late, shall yet assail\n      And rend dissimulation's veil:\n     Which will unfold the masquerade\n Which justifies our own 'slave trade.'\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE NEGRO CHASE\n\nWE shall now return to Natchez, where we left Currer in the hands\nof the Methodist parson.  For many years, Natchez has enjoyed a\nnotoriety for the inhumanity and barbarity of its inhabitants,\nand the cruel deeds perpetrated there, which have not been\nequalled in any other city in the Southern States.  The following\nadvertisements, which we take from a newspaper published in the\nvicinity, will show how they catch their Negroes who believe in\nthe doctrine that \"all men are created free.\"\n\n\"NEGRO DOGS.--The undersigned, having bought the entire pack of\nNegro dogs (of the Hay and Allen stock), he now proposes to catch\nrunaway Negroes.  His charges will be three dollars a day for\nhunting, and fifteen dollars for catching a runaway.  He resides\nthree and one half miles north of Livingston, near the lower\nJones' Bluff Road.\n\n\"Nov. 6, 1845.\"\n\n\n\n\"NOTICE.--The subscriber, Lying on Carroway Lake, on Hoe's Bayou,\nin Carroll parish, sixteen miles on the road leading from Bayou\nMason to Lake Providence, is ready with a pack of dogs to hunt\nrunaway Negroes at any time.  These dogs are well trained, and are\nknown throughout the parish.  Letters addressed to me at\nProvidence will secure immediate attention.  My terms are five\ndollars per day for hunting the trails, whether the Negro is\ncaught or not.  Where a twelve hours' trail is shown, and the\nNegro not taken, no charge is made.  For taking a Negro,\ntwenty-five dollars, and no charge made for hunting.\n\n\"Nov. 26, 1847.\"\n\n\nThese dogs will attack a Negro at their master's bidding and\ncling to him as the bull-dog will cling to a beast.  Many are\nthe speculations, as to whether the Negro will be secured alive\nor dead, when these dogs once get on his track.  A slave hunt took\nplace near Natchez, a few days after Currer's arrival, which was\ncalculated to give her no favourable opinion of the people.  Two\nslaves had run off owing to severe punishment.  The dogs were put\nupon their trail.  The slaves went into the swamps, with the hope\nthat the dogs when put on their scent would be unable to follow\nthem through the water.  The dogs soon took to the swamp, which\nlies between the highlands, which was now covered with water,\nwaist deep: here these faithful animals, swimming nearly all the\ntime, followed the zigzag course, the tortuous twistings and\nwindings of these two fugitives, who, it was afterwards\ndiscovered, were lost; sometimes scenting the tree wherein they\nhad found a temporary refuge from the mud and water; at other\nplaces where the deep mud had pulled off a shoe, and they had not\ntaken time to put it on again.  For two hours and a half, for four\nor five miles, did men and dogs wade through this bushy, dismal\nswamp, surrounded with grim-visaged alligators, who seemed to look\non with jealous eye at this encroachment of their hereditary\ndomain; now losing the trail--then slowly and dubiously taking it\noff again, until they triumphantly threaded it out, bringing them\nback to the river, where it was found that the Negroes had\ncrossed their own trail, near the place of starting.  In the\nmeantime a heavy shower had taken place, putting out the trail.\nThe Negroes were now at least four miles ahead.\n\nIt is well known to hunters that it requires the keenest scent and\nbest blood to overcome such obstacles, and yet these persevering\nand sagacious animals conquered every difficulty.  The\nslaves now made a straight course for the Baton Rouge and Bayou\nSara road, about four miles distant.\n\nFeeling hungry now, after their morning walk, and perhaps\nthirsty, too, they went about half a mile off the road, and ate a\ngood, hearty, substantial breakfast.  Negroes must eat, as well as\nother people, but the dogs will tell on them.  Here, for a moment,\nthe dogs are at fault, but soon unravel the mystery, and bring\nthem back to the road again; and now what before was wonderful,\nbecomes almost a miracle.  Here, in this common highway--the\nthoroughfare for the whole country around through mud and through\nmire, meeting waggons and teams, and different solitary\nwayfarers, and, what above all is most astonishing, actually\nrunning through a gang of Negroes, their favourite game, who were\nworking on the road, they pursue the track of the two Negroes;\nthey even ran for eight miles to the very edge of the plain--the\nslaves near them for the last mile.  At first they would fain\nbelieve it some hunter chasing deer.  Nearer and nearer the\nwhimpering pack presses on; the delusion begins to dispel; all at\nonce the truth flashes upon them like a glare of light; their\nhair stands on end; 'tis Tabor with his dogs.  The scent becomes\nwarmer and warmer.  What was an irregular cry, now deepens into\none ceaseless roar, as the relentless pack rolls on after its\nhuman prey.  It puts one in mind of Actaeon and his dogs.  They\ngrow desperate and leave the road, in the vain hope of shaking\nthem off.  Vain hope, indeed!  The momentary cessation only adds\nnew zest to the chase.  The cry grows louder and louder; the yelp\ngrows short and quick, sure indication that the game is at hand.\nIt is a perfect rush upon the part of the hunters, while the\nNegroes call upon their weary and jaded limbs to do their best,\nbut they falter and stagger beneath them.  The breath of the\nhounds is almost upon their very heels, and yet they have a vain\nhope of escaping these sagacious animals.  They can run no longer;\nthe dogs are upon them; they hastily attempt to climb a tree, and\nas the last one is nearly out of reach, the catch-dog seizes him\nby the leg, and brings him to the ground; he sings out lustily\nand the dogs are called off.  After this man was secured, the one\nin the tree was ordered to come down; this, however, he refused\nto do, but a gun being pointed at him, soon caused him to change\nhis mind.  On reaching the ground, the fugitive made one more\nbound, and the chase again commenced.  But it was of no use to run\nand he soon yielded.  While being tied, he committed an\nunpardonable offence: he resisted, and for that he must be made\nan example on their arrival home.  A mob was collected together,\nand a Lynch court was held, to determine what was best to be done\nwith the Negro who had had the impudence to raise his hand\nagainst a white man.  The Lynch court decided that the Negro\nshould be burnt at the stake.  A Natchez newspaper, the Free\nTrader, giving an account of it says,\n\n\"The body was taken and chained to a tree immediately on the banks\nof the Mississippi, on what is called Union Point.  Faggots were\nthen collected and piled around him, to which he appeared quite\nindifferent.  When the work was completed, he was asked what he had\nto say.  He then warned all to take example by him, and asked the\nprayers of all around; he then called for a drink of water, which\nwas handed to him; he drank it, and said, 'Now set fire--I am\nready to go in peace!'  The torches were lighted, and placed in\nthe pile, which soon ignited.  He watched unmoved the curling flame\nthat grew, until it began to entwine itself around and feed upon\nhis body; then he sent forth cries of agony painful to the ear,\nbegging some one to blow his brains out; at the same time surging\nwith almost superhuman strength, until the staple with which the\nchain was fastened to the tree (not being well secured) drew out,\nand he leaped from the burning pile.  At that moment the sharp\nringing of several rifles was heard: the body of the Negro fell a\ncorpse on the ground.  He was picked up by some two or three, and\nagain thrown into the fire, and consumed, not a vestige remaining\nto show that such a being ever existed.\"\n\nNearly 4,000 slaves were collected from the plantations in the\nneighbourhood to witness this scene.  Numerous speeches were made\nby the magistrates and ministers of religion to the large\nconcourse of slaves, warning them, and telling them that the same\nfate awaited them, if they should prove rebellious to their\nowners.  There are hundreds of Negroes who run away and live in\nthe woods.  Some take refuge in the swamps, because they are less\nfrequented by human beings.  A Natchez newspaper gave the\nfollowing account of the hiding-place of a slave who had been\ncaptured:--\n\n\"A runaway's den was discovered on Sunday, near the Washington\nSpring, in a little patch of woods, where it had been for several\nmonths so artfully concealed under ground, that it was detected\nonly by accident, though in sight of two or three houses, and near\nthe road and fields where there has been constant daily passing.\nThe entrance was concealed by a pile of pine straw, representing\na hog-bed, which being removed, discovered a trap-door and steps\nthat led to a room about six feet square, comfortably ceiled with\nplank, containing a small fire-place, the flue of which was\ningeniously conducted above ground and concealed by the straw.\nThe inmates took the alarm, and made their escape; but Mr. Adams\nand his excellent dogs being put upon the trail, soon run down\nand secured one of them, which proved to be a Negro-fellow who\nhad been out about a year.  He stated that the other occupant was\na woman, who had been a runaway a still longer time.  In the den\nwas found a quantity of meal, bacon, corn, potatoes, &c. and\nvarious cooking utensils and wearing apparel.\"--Vicksburg\nSentinel, Dec. 6th, 1838.\n\nCurrer was one of those who witnessed the execution of the slave\nat the stake, and it gave her no very exalted opinion of the\npeople of the cotton growing district.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE QUADROON'S HOME\n\n   \"How sweetly on the hill-side sleeps\n  The sunlight with its quickening rays!\n The verdant trees that crown the steeps,\n  Grow greener in its quivering blaze.\"\n\nABOUT three miles from Richmond is a pleasant plain, with here and\nthere a beautiful cottage surrounded by trees so as scarcely to\nbe seen. Among them was one far retired from the public roads,\nand almost hidden among the trees.  It was a perfect model of rural\nbeauty.  The piazzas that surrounded it were covered with clematis\nand passion flower.  The pride of China mixed its oriental looking\nfoliage with the majestic magnolia, and the air was redolent with\nthe fragrance of flowers, peeping out of every nook and nodding\nupon you with a most unexpected welcome.  The tasteful hand of art\nhad not learned to imitate the lavish beauty and harmonious\ndisorder of nature, but they lived together in loving amity, and\nspoke in accordant tones.  The gateway rose in a gothic arch, with\ngraceful tracery in iron work, surmounted by a cross, round which\nfluttered and played the mountain fringe, that lightest and most\nfragile of vines.  This cottage was hired by Horatio Green for\nClotel, and the quadroon girl soon found herself in her new home.\n\nThe tenderness of Clotel's conscience, together with the care her\nmother had with her and the high value she placed upon virtue,\nrequired an outward marriage; though she well knew that a union\nwith her proscribed race was unrecognised by law, and\ntherefore the ceremony would give her no legal hold on Horatio's\nconstancy.  But her high poetic nature regarded reality rather\nthan the semblance of things; and when he playfully asked how she\ncould keep him if he wished to run away, she replied, \"If the\nmutual love we have for each other, and the dictates of your own\nconscience do not cause you to remain my husband, and your\naffections fall from me, I would not, if I could, hold you by a\nsingle fetter.\"  It was indeed a marriage sanctioned by heaven,\nalthough unrecognised on earth.  There the young couple lived\nsecluded from the world, and passed their time as happily as\ncircumstances would permit.  It was Clotel's wish that Horatio\nshould purchase her mother and sister, but the young man pleaded\nthat he was unable, owing to the fact that he had not come into\npossession of his share of property, yet he promised that when he\ndid, he would seek them out and purchase them.  Their first-born\nwas named Mary, and her complexion was still lighter than her\nmother.  Indeed she was not darker than other white children.\nAs the child grew older, it more and more resembled its mother.\nThe iris of her large dark eye had the melting mezzotints, which\nremains the last vestige of African ancestry, and gives that\nplaintive expression, so often observed, and so appropriate to\nthat docile and injured race.  Clotel was still happier after the\nbirth of her dear child; for Horatio, as might have been\nexpected, was often absent day and night with his friends in the\ncity, and the edicts of society had built up a wall of separation\nbetween the quadroon and them.  Happy as Clotel was in Horatio's\nlove, and surrounded by an outward environment of beauty, so well\nadapted to her poetic spirit, she felt these incidents with\ninexpressible pain.  For herself she cared but little; for\nshe had found a sheltered home in Horatio's heart, which the world\nmight ridicule, but had no power to profane.  But when she looked\nat her beloved Mary, and reflected upon the unavoidable and\ndangerous position which the tyranny of society had awarded her,\nher soul was filled with anguish.  The rare loveliness of the\nchild increased daily, and was evidently ripening into most\nmarvellous beauty.  The father seemed to rejoice in it with\nunmingled pride; but in the deep tenderness of the mother's eye,\nthere was an indwelling sadness that spoke of anxious thoughts and\nfearful foreboding.  Clotel now urged Horatio to remove to France\nor England, where both her [sic] and her child would be free, and\nwhere colour was not a crime.  This request excited but little\nopposition, and was so attractive to his imagination, that he\nmight have overcome all intervening obstacles, had not \"a change\ncome over the spirit of his dreams.\"  He still loved Clotel; but\nhe was now becoming engaged in political and other affairs which\nkept him oftener and longer from the young mother; and ambition\nto become a statesman was slowly gaining the ascendancy over him.\n\nAmong those on whom Horatio's political success most depended was\na very popular and wealthy man, who had an only daughter.  His\nvisits to the house were at first purely of a political nature;\nbut the young lady was pleasing, and he fancied he discovered in\nher a sort of timid preference for himself.  This excited his\nvanity, and awakened thoughts of the great worldly advantages\nconnected with a union.  Reminiscences of his first love kept\nthese vague ideas in check for several months; for with it was\nassociated the idea of restraint.  Moreover, Gertrude, though\ninferior in beauty, was yet a pretty contrast to her rival.  Her\nlight hair fell in silken ringlets down her shoulders, her blue\neyes were gentle though inexpressive, and her healthy cheeks were\nlike opening rosebuds.  He had already become accustomed to the\ndangerous experiment of resisting his own inward convictions; and\nthis new impulse to ambition, combined with the strong temptation\nof variety in love, met the ardent young man weakened in moral\nprinciple, and unfettered by laws of the land.  The change wrought\nupon him was soon noticed by Clotel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE SLAVE MARKET\n\n  \"What! mothers from their children riven!\n    What! God's own image bought and sold!\n         Americans to market driven,\nAnd barter'd as the brute for gold.\"--Whittier.\n\nNOT far from Canal-street, in the city of New Orleans, stands a\nlarge two story flat building surrounded by a stone wall twelve\nfeet high, the top of which is covered with bits of glass, and so\nconstructed as to prevent even the possibility of any one's\npassing over it without sustaining great injury.  Many of the\nrooms resemble cells in a prison.  In a small room near the\n\"office\" are to be seen any number of iron collars, hobbles,\nhandcuffs, thumbscrews, cowhides, whips, chains, gags, and yokes.\nA back yard inclosed by a high wall looks something like the\nplayground attached to one of our large New England schools, and\nin which are rows of benches and swings.  Attached to the back\npremises is a good-sized kitchen, where two old Negresses are at\nwork, stewing, boiling, and baking, and occasionally wiping the\nsweat from their furrowed and swarthy brows.\n\nThe slave-trader Walker, on his arrival in New Orleans, took up\nhis quarters at this slave pen with his gang of human cattle: and\nthe morning after, at ten o'clock, they were exhibited for sale.\nThere, first of all, was the beautiful Althesa, whose pale\ncountenance and dejected look told how many sad hours she had\npassed since parting with her mother at Natchez.  There was a poor\nwoman who had been separated from her husband and five children.\nAnother woman, whose looks and manner were expressive of deep\nanguish, sat by her side.  There, too, was \"Uncle Geemes,\" with his\nwhiskers off, his face shaved clean, and the grey hair plucked\nout, and ready to be sold for ten years younger than he was.  Toby\nwas also there, with his face shaved and greased, ready for\ninspection.  The examination commenced, and was carried on in a\nmanner calculated to shock the feelings of any one not devoid of\nthe milk of human kindness.  \"What are you wiping your eyes for?\"\ninquired a fat, red-faced man, with a white hat set on one side\nof his head, and a cigar in his mouth, of a woman who sat on one\nof the stools.  \"I s'pose I have been crying.\"  \"Why do you cry?\"\n\"Because I have left my man behind.\"  \"Oh, if I buy you I will\nfurnish you with a better man than you left.  I have lots of young\nbucks on my farm.\"  \"I don't want, and will never have, any other\nman,\" replied the woman.  \"What's your name?\" asked a man in a\nstraw hat of a tall Negro man, who stood with his arms folded\nacross his breast, and leaning against the wall.  \"My name is\nAaron, sir.\"  \"How old are you?\"  \"Twenty-five.\"  \"Where were you\nraised?\"  \"In old Virginny, sir.\"  \"How many men have owned you?\"\n\"Four.\"  \"Do you enjoy good health?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How long did you\nlive with your first owner?\"  \"Twenty years.\"  \"Did you ever run\naway?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Did you ever strike your master?\"  \"No, sir.\"\n\"Were you ever whipped much?\"  \"No, sir, I s'pose I did not\ndeserve it.\"  \"How long did you live with your second master?\"\n\"Ten years, sir.\"  \"Have you a good appetite?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Can\nyou eat your allowance?\"  \"Yes, sir, when I can get it.\"  \"What were\nyou employed at in Virginia?\"  \"I worked in de terbacar feel.\"  \"In\nthe tobacco field?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How old did you say you were?\"\n\"I will be twenty-five if I live to see next sweet potater digging\ntime.\"  \"I am a cotton planter, and if I buy you, you will have to\nwork in the cotton field.  My men pick one hundred and fifty\npounds a day, and the women one hundred and forty, and those who\nfail to pick their task receive five stripes from the cat for\neach pound that is wanting.  Now, do you think you could keep up\nwith the rest of the bands?\"  \"I don't know, sir, I 'spec I'd have\nto.\"  \"How long did you live with your third master?\"  \"Three\nyears, sir.\"  \"Why, this makes you thirty-three, I thought you told\nme you was only twenty five?\"  Aaron now looked first at the\nplanter, then at the trader, and seemed perfectly bewildered.  He\nhad forgotten the lesson given him by Pompey as to his age, and\nthe planter's circuitous talk (doubtless to find out the slave's\nreal age) had the Negro off his guard.  \"I must see your back, so\nas to know how much you have been whipped, before I think of\nbuying,\" said the planter.  Pompey, who had been standing by\nduring the examination, thought that his services were now\nrequired, and stepping forward with a degree of officiousness,\nsaid to Aaron, \"Don't you hear de gentman tell you he want to\nzamon your limbs.  Come, unharness yeself, old boy, an don't be\nstanding dar.\"  Aaron was soon examined and pronounced \"sound\";\nyet the conflicting statement about the age was not satisfactory.\n\nFortunate for Althesa she was spared the pain of undergoing such\nan examination.  Mr. Crawford, a teller in one of the banks, had\njust been married, and wanted a maid-servant for his wife; and\npassing through the market in the early part of the day, was\npleased with the young slave's appearance and purchased her, and\nin his dwelling the quadroon found a much better home than often\nfalls to the lot of a slave sold in the New Orleans market.  The\nheartrending and cruel traffic in slaves which has been so often\ndescribed, is not confined to any particular class of persons.  No\none forfeits his or her character or standing in society, by\nbuying or selling slaves; or even raising slaves for the market.\nThe precise number of slaves carried from the slave-raising to the\nslave-consuming states, we have no means of knowing.  But it must\nbe very great, as more than forty thousand were sold and taken\nout of the state of Virginia in one year.  Known to God only is\nthe amount of human agony and suffering which sends its cry from\nthe slave markets and Negro pens, unheard and unheeded by man, up\nto his ear; mothers weeping for their children, breaking the\nnight-silence with the shrieks of their breaking hearts.  From\nsome you will hear the burst of bitter lamentation, while from\nothers the loud hysteric laugh, denoting still deeper agony.\nMost of them leave the market for cotton or rice plantations,\n\n \"Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,\n     Where the noisome insect stings,\n       Where the fever demon-strews\n      Poison with the falling dews,\n     Where the sickly sunbeams glare\n     Through the hot and misty air.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE RELIGIOUS TEACHER\n\n        \"What! preach and enslave men?\n Give thanks--and rob thy own afflicted poor?\n    Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then\n  Bolt hard the captive's door.\"--Whittier.\n\nTHE Rev. John Peck was a native of the state of Connecticut, where\nhe was educated for the ministry, in the Methodist persuasion.\nHis father was a strict follower of John Wesley, and spared no\npains in his son's education, with the hope that he would one day\nbe as renowned as the great leader of his sect.  John had scarcely\nfinished his education at New Haven, when he was invited by an\nuncle, then on a visit to his father, to spend a few months at\nNatchez in the state of Mississippi.  Young Peck accepted his\nuncle's invitation, and accompanied him to the South.  Few young\nmen, and especially clergymen, going fresh from a college to the\nSouth, but are looked upon as geniuses in a small way, and who\nare not invited to all the parties in the neighbourhood.  Mr. Peck\nwas not an exception to this rule.  The society into which he was\nthrown on his arrival at Natchez was too brilliant for him not to\nbe captivated by it; and, as might have been expected, he\nsucceeded in captivating a plantation with seventy slaves, if not\nthe heart of the lady to whom it belonged.  Added to this, he\nbecame a popular preacher, had a large congregation with a snug\nsalary.  Like other planters, Mr. Peck confided the care of his\nfarm to Ned Huckelby, an overseer of high reputation in his\nway.  The Poplar Farm, as it was called, was situated in a\nbeautiful valley nine miles from Natchez, and near the river\nMississippi.  The once unshorn face of nature had given way, and\nnow the farm blossomed with a splendid harvest, the neat cottage\nstood in a grove where Lombardy poplars lift their tufted tops\nalmost to prop the skies; the willow, locust, and horse-chestnut\nspread their branches, and flowers never cease to blossom.  This\nwas the parson's country house, where the family spent only two\nmonths during the year.\n\nThe town residence was a fine villa, seated upon the brow of a\nhill at the edge of the city.  It was in the kitchen of this house\nthat Currer found her new home.  Mr. Peck was, every inch of him,\na democrat, and early resolved that his \"people,\" as he called his\nslaves, should be well fed and not overworked, and therefore laid\ndown the law and gospel to the overseer as well as the slaves.\n\n\"It is my wish,\" said he to Mr. Carlton, an old school-fellow, who\nwas spending a few days with him, \"it is my wish that a new\nsystem be adopted on the plantations in this estate.  I believe\nthat the sons of Ham should have the gospel, and I intend that my\nNegroes shall.  The gospel is calculated to make mankind better,\nand none should be without it.\"  \"What say you,\" replied Carlton,\n\"about the right of man to his liberty?\"  \"Now, Carlton, you have\nbegun again to harp about man's rights; I really wish you could\nsee this matter as I do.  I have searched in vain for any authority\nfor man's natural rights; if he had any, they existed before the\nfall.  That is, Adam and Eve may have had some rights which God\ngave them, and which modern philosophy, in its pretended reverence\nfor the name of God, prefers to call natural rights.  I can\nimagine they had the right to eat of the fruit of the trees of\nthe garden; they were restricted even in this by the\nprohibition of one.  As far as I know without positive assertion,\ntheir liberty of action was confined to the garden.  These were\nnot 'inalienable rights,' however, for they forfeited both them\nand life with the first act of disobedience.  Had they, after\nthis, any rights?  We cannot imagine them; they were condemned\nbeings; they could have no rights, but by Christ's gift as king.\nThese are the only rights man can have as an independent isolated\nbeing, if we choose to consider him in this impossible position,\nin which so many theorists have placed him.  If he had no rights,\nhe could suffer no wrongs.  Rights and wrongs are therefore\nnecessarily the creatures of society, such as man would establish\nhimself in his gregarious state.  They are, in this state, both\nartificial and voluntary.  Though man has no rights, as thus\nconsidered, undoubtedly he has the power, by such arbitrary rules\nof right and wrong as his necessity enforces.\"  \"I regret I cannot\nsee eye to eye with you,\" said Carlton.  \"I am a disciple of\nRousseau, and have for years made the rights of man my study; and\nI must confess to you that I can see no difference between white\nmen and black men as it regards liberty.\"  \"Now, my dear Carlton,\nwould you really have the Negroes enjoy the same rights with\nourselves?\"  \"I would, most certainly.  Look at our great\nDeclaration of Independence; look even at the constitution of our\nown Connecticut, and see what is said in these about liberty.\"  \"I\nregard all this talk about rights as mere humbug.  The Bible is\nolder than the Declaration of Independence, and there I take my\nstand.  The Bible furnishes to us the armour of proof, weapons of\nheavenly temper and mould, whereby we can maintain our ground\nagainst all attacks.  But this is true only when we obey its\ndirections, as well as employ its sanctions.  Our rights\nare there established, but it is always in connection with our\nduties.  If we neglect the one we cannot make good the other.  Our\ndomestic institutions can be maintained against the world, if we\nbut allow Christianity to throw its broad shield over them.  But\nif we so act as to array the Bible against our social economy,\nthey must fall.  Nothing ever yet stood long against Christianity.\nThose who say that religious instruction is inconsistent with our\npeculiar civil polity, are the worst enemies of that polity.  They\nwould drive religious men from its defence.  Sooner or later, if\nthese views prevail, they will separate the religious portion of\nour community from the rest, and thus divided we shall become an\neasy prey.  Why, is it not better that Christian men should hold\nslaves than unbelievers?  We know how to value the bread of life,\nand will not keep it from our slaves.\"\n\n\"Well, every one to his own way of thinking,\" said Carlton, as he\nchanged his position.  \"I confess,\" added he, \"that I am no great\nadmirer of either the Bible or slavery.  My heart is my guide: my\nconscience is my Bible.  I wish for nothing further to satisfy me\nof my duty to man.  If I act rightly to mankind, I shall fear\nnothing.\"  Carlton had drunk too deeply of the bitter waters of\ninfidelity, and had spent too many hours over the writings of\nRousseau, Voltaire, and Thomas Paine, to place that appreciation\nupon the Bible and its teachings that it demands.  During this\nconversation there was another person in the room, seated by the\nwindow, who, although at work upon a fine piece of lace, paid\nevery attention to what was said.  This was Georgiana, the only\ndaughter of the parson.  She had just returned from Connecticut,\nwhere she had finished her education.  She had had the opportunity\nof contrasting the spirit of Christianity and liberty in New\nEngland with that of slavery in her native state, and had\nlearned to feel deeply for the injured Negro.  Georgiana was in\nher nineteenth year, and had been much benefited by a residence\nof five years at the North.  Her form was tall and graceful; her\nfeatures regular and well defined; and her complexion was\nilluminated by the freshness of youth, beauty, and health.  The\ndaughter differed from both the father and his visitor upon the\nsubject which they had been discussing, and as soon as an\nopportunity offered, she gave it as her opinion, that the Bible\nwas both the bulwark of Christianity and of liberty.  With a smile\nshe said, \"Of course, papa will overlook my differing from him,\nfor although I am a native of the South, I am by education and\nsympathy, a Northerner.\"  Mr. Peck laughed and appeared pleased,\nrather than otherwise, at the manner in which his daughter had\nexpressed herself.\n\nFrom this Georgiana took courage and said, \"We must try the\ncharacter of slavery, and our duty in regard to it, as we should\ntry any other question of character and duty.  To judge justly of\nthe character of anything, we must know what it does.  That which\nis good does good, and that which is evil does evil.  And as to\nduty, God's designs indicate his claims.  That which accomplishes\nthe manifest design of God is right; that which counteracts it,\nwrong.  Whatever, in its proper tendency and general effect,\nproduces, secures, or extends human welfare, is according to the\nwill of God, and is good; and our duty is to favour and promote,\naccording to our power, that which God favours and promotes by\nthe general law of his providence.  On the other hand, whatever in\nits proper tendency and general effect destroys, abridges, or\nrenders insecure, human welfare, is opposed to God's will, and is\nevil.  And as whatever accords with the will of God, in any\nmanifestation of it should be done and persisted in, so\nwhatever opposes that will should not be done, and if done, should\nbe abandoned.  Can that then be right, be well doing--can that obey\nGod's behest, which makes a man a slave? which dooms him and all\nhis posterity, in limitless Generations, to bondage, to unrequited\ntoil through life?  'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'\nThis single passage of Scripture should cause us to have respect\nto the rights of the slave.  True Christian love is of an\nenlarged, disinterested nature.  It loves all who love the Lord\nJesus Christ in sincerity, without regard to colour or condition.\"\n\"Georgiana, my dear, you are an abolitionist; your talk is\nfanaticism,\" said Mr. Peck in rather a sharp tone; but the\nsubdued look of the girl, and the presence of Carlton, caused the\nfather to soften his language.  Mr. Peck having lost his wife by\nconsumption, and Georgiana being his only child, he loved her too\ndearly to say more, even if he felt displeased.  A silence followed\nthis exhortation from the young Christian.  But her remarks had\ndone a noble work.  The father's heart was touched; and the\nsceptic, for the first time, was viewing Christianity in its true\nlight.\n\n\"I think I must go out to your farm,\" said Carlton, as if to break\nthe silence.  \"I shall be pleased to have you go,\" returned Mr.\nPeck. \"I am sorry I can't go myself, but Huckelby will show you\nevery attention; and I feel confident that when you return to\nConnecticut, you will do me the justice to say, that I am one who\nlooks after my people, in a moral, social, and religious point of\nview.\"  \"Well, what do you say to my spending next Sunday there?\"\n\"Why, I think that a good move; you will then meet with Snyder,\nour missionary.\"  \"Oh, you have missionaries in these parts, have\nyou?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Peck; \"Snyder is from New York, and is\nour missionary to the poor, and preaches to our 'people' on\nSunday; you will no doubt like him; he is a capital\nfellow.\"  \"Then I shall go,\" said Carlton, \"but only wish I had\ncompany.\"  This last remark was intended for Miss Peck, for whom\nhe had the highest admiration.\n\nIt was on a warm Sunday morning, in the month of May, that Miles\nCarlton found himself seated beneath a fine old apple tree, whose\nthick leaves entirely shaded the ground for some distance round.\nUnder similar trees and near by, were gathered together all the\n\"people\" belonging to the plantation.  Hontz Snyder was a man of\nabout forty years of age, exceedingly low in stature, but of a\nlarge frame.  He had been brought up in the Mohawk Valley, in the\nstate of New York, and claimed relationship with the oldest Dutch\nfamilies in that vicinity.  He had once been a sailor, and had all\nthe roughness of character that a sea-faring man might expect to\npossess; together with the half-Yankee, half-German peculiarities\nof the people of the Mohawk Valley.  It was nearly eleven o'clock\nwhen a one-horse waggon drove up in haste, and the low squatty\npreacher got out and took his place at the foot of one of the\ntrees, where a sort of rough board table was placed, and took his\nbooks from his pocket and commenced.\n\n\"As it is rather late,\" said he, \"we will leave the singing and\npraying for the last, and take our text, and commence\nimmediately.  I shall base my remarks on the following passage of\nScripture, and hope to have that attention which is due to the\ncause of God:--'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do\nunto you, do ye even so unto them'; that is, do by all mankind\njust as you would desire they should do by you, if you were in\ntheir place and they in yours.\n\n\"Now, to suit this rule to your particular circumstances, suppose\nyou were masters and mistresses, and had servants under you, would\nyou not desire that your servants should do their business\nfaithfully and honestly, as well when your back was turned as while\nyou were looking over them?  Would you not expect that they should\ntake notice of what you said to them? that they should behave\nthemselves with respect towards you and yours, and be as careful of\neverything belonging to you as you would be yourselves?  You are\nservants: do, therefore, as you would wish to be done by, and you\nwill be both good servants to your masters and good servants to God,\nwho requires this of you, and will reward you well for it, if you do\nit for the sake of conscience, in obedience to his commands.\n\n\"You are not to be eye-servants.  Now, eye-servants are such as\nwill work hard, and seem mighty diligent, while they think\nanybody is taking notice of them; but, when their masters' and\nmistresses' backs are turned they are idle, and neglect their\nbusiness.  I am afraid there are a great many such eye-servants\namong you, and that you do not consider how great a sin it is to\nbe so, and how severely God will punish you for it.  You may easily\ndeceive your owners, and make them have an opinion of you that\nyou do not deserve, and get the praise of men by it; but remember\nthat you cannot deceive Almighty God, who sees your wickedness\nand deceit, and will punish you accordingly.  For the rule is,\nthat you must obey your masters in all things, and do the work\nthey set you about with fear and trembling, in singleness of\nheart as unto Christ; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but\nas the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;\nwith good-will doing service as to the Lord, and not as to men.\n\n\"Take care that you do not fret or murmur, grumble or repine at\nyour condition; for this will not only make your life\nuneasy, but will greatly offend Almighty God.  Consider that it\nis not yourselves, it is not the people that you belong to, it is\nnot the men who have brought you to it, but it is the will of God\nwho hath by his providence made you servants, because, no doubt,\nhe knew that condition would be best for you in this world, and\nhelp you the better towards heaven, if you would but do your duty\nin it.  So that any discontent at your not being free, or rich, or\ngreat, as you see some others, is quarrelling with your heavenly\nMaster, and finding fault with God himself, who hath made you\nwhat you are, and hath promised you as large a share in the\nkingdom of heaven as the greatest man alive, if you will but\nbehave yourself aright, and do the business he hath set you about\nin this world honestly and cheerfully.  Riches and power have\nproved the ruin of many an unhappy soul, by drawing away the\nheart and affections from God, and fixing them on mean and sinful\nenjoyments; so that, when God, who knows our hearts better than\nwe know them ourselves, sees that they would be hurtful to us,\nand therefore keeps them from us, it is the greatest mercy and\nkindness he could show us.\n\n\"You may perhaps fancy that, if you had riches and freedom, you\ncould do your duty to God and man with greater pleasure than you\ncan now.  But pray consider that, if you can but save your souls\nthrough the mercy of God, you will have spent your time to the\nbest of purposes in this world; and he that at last can get to\nheaven has performed a noble journey, let the road be ever so\nrugged and difficult.  Besides, you really have a great advantage\nover most white people, who have not only the care of their daily\nlabour upon their hands, but the care of looking forward and\nproviding necessaries for to-morrow and next day, and of clothing\nand bringing up their children, and of getting food and raiment\nfor as many of you as belong to their families, which\noften puts them to great difficulties, and distracts their minds\nso as to break their rest, and take off their thoughts from the\naffairs of another world.  Whereas you are quite eased from all\nthese cares, and have nothing but your daily labour to look\nafter, and, when that is done, take your needful rest. Neither is\nit necessary for you to think of laying up anything against old\nage, as white people are obliged to do; for the laws of the\ncountry have provided that you shall not be turned off when you\nare past labour, but shall be maintained, while you live, by\nthose you belong to, whether you are able to work or not.\n\n\"There is only one circumstance which may appear grievous, that I\nshall now take notice of, and that is correction.\n\n\"Now, when correction is given you, you either deserve it, or you\ndo not deserve it. But whether you really deserve it or not, it\nis your duty, and Almighty God requires that you bear it\npatiently.  You may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine; but,\nif you consider it right, you must needs think otherwise of it.\nSuppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say\nthat it is just and right you should meet with it.  Suppose you do\nnot, or at least you do not deserve so much, or so severe a\ncorrection, for the fault you have committed, you perhaps have\nescaped a great many more, and are at last paid for all.  Or\nsuppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to your charge,\nand suffer wrongfully in that particular thing, is it not possible\nyou may have done some other bad thing which was never\ndiscovered, and that Almighty God who saw you doing it would not\nlet you escape without punishment one time or another?  And ought\nyou not, in such a case, to give glory to him, and be thankful\nthat he would rather punish you in this life for your\nwickedness than destroy your souls for it in the next\nlife?  But suppose even this was not the case (a case hardly to be\nimagined), and that you have by no means, known or unknown,\ndeserved the correction you suffered, there is this great comfort\nin it, that, if you bear it patiently, and leave your cause in\nthe hands of God, he will reward you for it in heaven, and the\npunishment you suffer unjustly here shall turn to your exceeding\ngreat glory hereafter.\n\n\"Lastly, you should serve your masters faithfully, because of\ntheir goodness to you.  See to what trouble they have been on your\naccount.  Your fathers were poor ignorant and barbarous creatures\nin Africa, and the whites fitted out ships at great trouble and\nexpense and brought you from that benighted land to Christian\nAmerica, where you can sit under your own vine and fig tree and\nno one molest or make you afraid.  Oh, my dear black brothers and\nsisters, you are indeed a fortunate and a blessed people.  Your\nmasters have many troubles that you know nothing about.  If the\nbanks break, your masters are sure to lose something.  If the\ncrops turn out poor, they lose by it.  If one of you die, your\nmaster loses what he paid for you, while you lose nothing.  Now let\nme exhort you once more to be faithful.\"\n\nOften during the delivery of the sermon did Snyder cast an anxious\nlook in the direction where Carlton was seated; no doubt to see\nif he had found favour with the stranger.  Huckelby, the\noverseer, was also there, seated near Carlton.  With all Snyder's\ngesticulations, sonorous voice, and occasionally bringing his\nfist down upon the table with the force of a sledge hammer, he\ncould not succeed in keeping the Negroes all interested: four or\nfive were fast asleep, leaning against the trees; as many more\nwere nodding, while not a few were stealthily cracking, and\neating hazelnuts.  \"Uncle Simon, you may strike up a\nhymn,\" said the preacher as he closed his Bible.  A moment more,\nand the whole company (Carlton excepted) had joined in the well\nknown hymn, commencing with\n\n     \"When I can read my title clear\n         To mansions in the sky.\"\n\nAfter the singing, Sandy closed with prayer, and the following\nquestions and answers read, and the meeting was brought to a\nclose.\n\n\"Q. What command has God given to servants concerning obedience to\ntheir masters?--A. 'Servants, obey in all things your masters\naccording to the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers,\nbut in singleness of heart, fearing God.'\n\n\"Q. What does God mean by masters according to the flesh?--A.\n'Masters in this world.'\n\n\"Q. What are servants to count their masters worthy of?-- A. 'All\nhonour.'\n\n\"Q. How are they to do the service of their masters?--A. 'With good\nwill, doing service as unto the Lord, and not unto men.'\n\n\"Q. How are they to try to please their masters?--A. 'Please him\nwell in all things, not answering again.'\n\n\"Q. Is a servant who is an eye-servant to his earthly master an\neye-servant to his heavenly master?--A. 'Yes.'\n\n\"Q. Is it right in a servant, when commanded to do any thing, to\nbe sullen and slow, and answer his master again?--A. 'No.'\n\n\"Q. If the servant professes to be a Christian, ought he not to be\nas a Christian servant, an example to all other servants of love\nand obedience to his master?--A. 'Yes.'\n\n\"Q. And, should his master be a Christian also, ought he not on\nthat account specially to love and obey him?--A. 'Yes.'\n\n\"Q. But suppose the master is hard to please, and threatens and\npunishes more than he ought, what is the servant to do?--A. 'Do\nhis best to please him.'\n\n\"Q. When the servant suffers wrongfully at the hands of his\nmaster, and, to please God, takes it patiently, will God reward\nhim for it?--A. 'Yes.'\n\n\"Q. Is it right for the servant to run away, or is it right to\nharbour a runaway?--A. 'No.'\n\n\"Q. If a servant runs away, what should be done with him?--A. 'He\nshould be caught and brought back.'\n\n\"Q. When he is brought back, what should be done with him?--\nA. 'Whip him well.'\n\n\"Q. Why may not the whites be slaves as well as the blacks?--\nA. 'Because the Lord intended the Negroes for slaves.'\n\n\"Q. Are they better calculated for servants than the whites?--\nA. 'Yes, their hands are large, the skin thick and tough, and they\ncan stand the sun better than the whites.'\n\n\"Q. Why should servants not complain when they are whipped?--\nA. 'Because the Lord has commanded that they should be whipped.'\n\n\"Q. Where has He commanded it?--A. 'He says, He that knoweth his\nmaster's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many\nstripes.'\n\n\"Q. Then is the master to blame for whipping his servant?--A. 'Oh,\nno! he is only doing his duty as a Christian.'\"\n\nSnyder left the ground in company with Carlton and Huckelby, and\nthe three dined together in the overseer's dwelling.  \"Well,\" said\nJoe, after the three white men were out of hearing, \"Marser\nSnyder bin try hesef to-day.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Ned; \"he want to show\nde strange gentman how good he can preach.\"  \"Dat's a new sermon\nhe gib us to-day,\" said Sandy.  \"Dees white fokes is de very\ndibble,\" said Dick; \"and all dey whole study is to try to fool de\nblack people.\"  \"Didn't you like de sermon?\" asked Uncle Simon.\n\"No,\" answered four or five voices.  \"He rared and pitched enough,\"\ncontinued Uncle Simon.\n\nNow Uncle Simon was himself a preacher, or at least he thought so,\nand was rather pleased than otherwise, when he heard others\nspoken of in a disparaging manner.  \"Uncle Simon can beat dat\nsermon all to pieces,\" said Ned, as he was filling his\nmouth with hazelnuts.  \"I got no notion of dees white fokes, no\nhow,\" returned Aunt Dafney.  \"Dey all de time tellin' dat de Lord\nmade us for to work for dem, and I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\"Marser Peck give dat sermon to Snyder, I know,\" said Uncle\nSimon.  \"He jest de one for dat,\" replied Sandy.  \"I think de people\ndat made de Bible was great fools,\" said Ned.  \"Why?\" Uncle Simon.\n\"'Cause dey made such a great big book and put nuttin' in it, but\nservants obey yer masters.\"  \"Oh,\" replied Uncle Simon, \"thars more\nin de Bible den dat, only Snyder never reads any other part to\nus; I use to hear it read in Maryland, and thar was more den what\nSnyder lets us hear.\"  In the overseer's house there was another\nscene going on, and far different from what we have here described.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE POOR WHITES, SOUTH\n\n\"No seeming of logic can ever convince the American people, that\nthousands of our slave-holding brethren are not excellent,\nhumane, and even Christian men, fearing God, and keeping His\ncommandments.\"--Rev. Dr. Joel Parker.\n\n\"You like these parts better than New York,\" said Carlton to\nSnyder, as they were sitting down to dinner in the overseer's\ndwelling.  \"I can't say that I do,\" was the reply; \"I came here\nten years ago as missionary, and Mr. Peck wanted me to stay, and I\nhave remained.  I travel among the poor whites during the week and\npreach for the niggers on Sunday.\"  \"Are there many poor whites in\nthis district?\"  \"Not here, but about thirty miles from here, in\nthe Sand Hill district; they are as ignorant as horses.  Why it\nwas no longer than last week I was up there, and really you would\nnot believe it, that people were so poor off.  In New England,\nand, I may say, in all the free states, they have free schools,\nand everybody gets educated.  Not so here.  In Connecticut there is\nonly one out of every five hundred above twenty-one years that\ncan neither read nor write.  Here there is one out of every eight\nthat can neither read nor write.  There is not a single newspaper\ntaken in five of the counties in this state.  Last week I was at\nSand Hill for the first time, and I called at a farmhouse.  The\nman was out.  It was a low log-hut, and yet it was the best house\nin that locality.  The woman and nine children were there, and the\ngeese, ducks, chickens, pigs, and children were all\nrunning about the floor.  The woman seemed scared at me when I\nentered the house.  I inquired if I could get a little dinner, and\nmy horse fed.  She said, yes, if I would only be good enough to\nfeed him myself, as her 'gal,' as she called her daughter, would\nbe afraid of the horse.  When I returned into the house again from\nthe stable, she kept her eyes upon me all the time.  At last she\nsaid, 'I s'pose you ain't never bin in these parts afore?'  'No,'\nsaid I.  'Is you gwine to stay here long?'  'Not very long,' I\nreplied.  'On business, I s'pose.'  'Yes,' said I, 'I am hunting up\nthe lost sheep of the house of Israel.'  'Oh,' exclaimed she,\n'hunting for lost sheep is you?  Well, you have a hard time to find\n'em here.  My husband lost an old ram last week, and he ain't found\nhim yet, and he's hunted every day.'  'I am not looking for\nfour-legged sheep,' said I, 'I am hunting for sinners.'  'Ah'; she\nsaid, 'then you are a preacher.'  'Yes,' said I.  'You are the\nfirst of that sort that's bin in these diggins for many a day.'\nTurning to her eldest daughter, she said in an excited tone, 'Clar\nout the pigs and ducks, and sweep up the floor; this is a\npreacher.'  And it was some time before any of the children would\ncome near me; one remained under the bed (which, by the by, was\nin the same room), all the while I was there.  'Well,' continued\nthe woman, 'I was a tellin' my man only yesterday that I would\nlike once more to go to meetin' before I died, and he said as he\nshould like to do the same.  But as you have come, it will save us\nthe trouble of going out of the district.'\"  \"Then you found some\nof the lost sheep,\" said Carlton.  \"Yes,\" replied Snyder, \"I did\nnot find anything else up there.  The state makes no provision for\neducating the poor: they are unable to do it themselves, and they\ngrow up in a state of ignorance and degradation.  The men hunt and\nthe women have to go in the fields and labour.\"  \"What is\nthe cause of it?\" inquired Carlton.  \"Slavery,\" answered Snyder,\nslavery,--and nothing else.  Look at the city of Boston; it pays\nmore taxes for the support of the government than this entire\nstate.  The people of Boston do more business than the whole\npopulation of Mississippi put together.  I was told some very\namusing things while at Sand Hill.  A farmer there told me a story\nabout an old woman, who was very pious herself.  She had a husband\nand three sons, who were sad characters, and she had often prayed\nfor their conversion but to no effect.  At last, one day while\nworking in the corn-field, one of her sons was bitten by a\nrattlesnake.  He had scarce reached home before he felt the poison,\nand in his agony called loudly on his Maker.\n\n\"The pious old woman, when she heard this, forgetful of her son's\nmisery, and everything else but the glorious hope of his\nrepentance, fell on her knees, and prayed as follows--'Oh! Lord,\nI thank thee, that thou hast at last opened Jimmy's eyes to the\nerror of his ways; and I pray that, in thy Divine mercy, thou\nwilt send a rattlesnake to bite the old man, and another to bite\nTom, and another to bite Harry, for I am certain that nothing but\na rattlesnake, or something of the kind, will ever turn them from\ntheir sinful ways, they are so hard-headed.'  When returning home,\nand before I got out of the Sand Hill district, I saw a funeral,\nand thought I would fasten my horse to a post and attend.  The\ncoffin was carried in a common horse cart, and followed by fifteen\nor twenty persons very shabbily dressed, and attended by a man\nwhom I took to be the religious man of the place.  After the\ncoffin had been placed near the grave, he spoke as follows,--\n\n\"'Friends and neighbours! you have congregated to see this lump\nof mortality put into a hole in the ground.  You all\nknow the deceased--a worthless, drunken, good-for-nothing\nvagabond.  He lived in disgrace and infamy, and died in\nwretchedness.  You all despised him--you all know his brother Joe,\nwho lives on the hill?  He's not a bit better though he has\nscrap'd together a little property by cheating his neighbours.  His\nend will be like that of this loathsome creature, whom you will\nplease put into the hole as soon as possible.  I won't ask you to\ndrop a tear, but brother Bohow will please raise a hymn while we\nfill up the grave.'\"\n\n\"I am rather surprised to hear that any portion of the whites in\nthis state are in so low a condition.\"  \"Yet it is true,\" returned\nSnyder.\n\n\"These are very onpleasant facts to be related to ye, Mr.\nCarlton,\" said Huckelby; \"but I can bear witness to what Mr.\nSnyder has told ye.\"  Huckelby was from Maryland, where many of\nthe poor whites are in as sad a condition as the Sand Hillers of\nMississippi.  He was a tall man, of iron constitution, and could\nneither read nor write, but was considered one of the best\noverseers in the country.  When about to break a slave in, to do a\nheavy task, he would make him work by his side all day; and if\nthe new hand kept up with him, he was set down as an able bodied\nman.  Huckelby had neither moral, religious, or political\nprinciples, and often boasted that conscience was a matter that\nnever \"cost\" him a thought.  \"Mr. Snyder ain't told ye half about\nthe folks in these parts,\" continued he; \"we who comes from more\nenlightened parts don't know how to put up with 'em down here.\nI find the people here knows mighty little indeed; in fact, I may\nsay they are univarsaly onedicated.  I goes out among none on 'em,\n'cause they ain't such as I have been used to 'sociate with.  When\nI gits a little richer, so that I can stop work, I tend to go\nback to Maryland, and spend the rest of my days.\"  \"I wonder the\nNegroes don't attempt to get their freedom by physical force.\"  \"It\nain't no use for 'em to try that, for if they do, we puts 'em\nthrough by daylight,\" replied Huckelby.  \"There are some desperate\nfellows among the slaves,\" said Snyder.  \"Indeed,\" remarked\nCarlton.  \"Oh, yes,\" replied the preacher.  \"A case has just taken\nplace near here, where a neighbour of ours, Mr. J. Higgerson,\nattempted to correct a Negro man in his employ, who resisted, drew\na knife, and stabbed him (Mr. H.) in several places.  Mr. J. C.\nHobbs (a Tennessean) ran to his assistance.  Mr. Hobbs stooped to\npick up a stick to strike the Negro, and, while in that position,\nthe Negro rushed upon him, and caused his immediate death.  The\nNegro then fled to the woods, but was pursued with dogs, and soon\novertaken.  He had stopped in a swamp to fight the dogs, when the\nparty who were pursuing him came upon him, and commanded him to\ngive up, which he refused to do.  He then made several efforts to\nstab them.  Mr. Roberson, one of the party, gave him several blows\non the head with a rifle gun; but this, instead of subduing, only\nincreased his desperate revenge.  Mr. R. then discharged his gun\nat the Negro, and missing him, the ball struck Mr. Boon in the\nface, and felled him to the ground.  The Negro, seeing Mr. Boon\nprostrated, attempted to rush up and stab him, but was prevented\nby the timely interference of some one of the party.  He was then\nshot three times with a revolving pistol, and once with a rifle,\nand after having his throat cut, he still kept the knife firmly\ngrasped in his hand, and tried to cut their legs when they\napproached to put an end to his life.  This chastisement was given\nbecause the Negro grumbled, and found fault with his master for\nflogging his wife.\"  \"Well, this is a bad state of affairs indeed,\nand especially the condition of the poor whites,\" said Carlton.\n\"You see,\" replied Snyder, \"no white man is respectable in\nthese slave states who works for a living.  No community\ncan be prosperous, where honest labour is not honoured.  No\nsociety can be rightly constituted, where the intellect is not\nfed.  Whatever institution reflects discredit on industry,\nwhatever institution forbids the general culture of the\nunderstanding, is palpably hostile to individual rights, and to\nsocial well-being.  Slavery is the incubus that hangs over the\nSouthern States.\"  \"Yes,\" interrupted Huckelby; \"them's just my\nsentiments now, and no mistake.  I think that, for the honour of\nour country, this slavery business should stop.  I don't own any,\nno how, and I would not be an overseer if I wern't paid for it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE SEPARATION\n\n         \"In many ways does the full heart reveal\n        The presence of the love it would conceal;\n      But in far more the estranged heart lets know\n The absence of the love, which yet it fain would show.\"\n\nAT length the news of the approaching marriage of Horatio met the\near of Clotel.  Her head grew dizzy, and her heart fainted within\nher; but, with a strong effort at composure, she inquired all the\nparticulars, and her pure mind at once took its resolution.\nHoratio came that evening, and though she would fain have met him\nas usual, her heart was too full not to throw a deep sadness over\nher looks and tones.  She had never complained of his decreasing\ntenderness, or of her own lonely hours; but he felt that the mute\nappeal of her heart-broken looks was more terrible than words.  He\nkissed the hand she offered, and with a countenance almost as sad\nas her own, led her to a window in the recess shadowed by a\nluxuriant passion flower.  It was the same seat where they had\nspent the first evening in this beautiful cottage, consecrated to\ntheir first loves.  The same calm, clear moonlight looked in\nthrough the trellis.  The vine then planted had now a luxuriant\ngrowth; and many a time had Horatio fondly twined its sacred\nblossoms with the glossy ringlets of her raven hair.  The rush of\nmemory almost overpowered poor Clotel; and Horatio felt too much\noppressed and ashamed to break the long deep silence.  At length,\nin words scarcely audible, Clotel said: \"Tell me, dear\nHoratio, are you to be married next week?\"  He dropped her hand as\nif a rifle ball had struck him; and it was not until after long\nhesitation, that he began to make some reply about the necessity\nof circumstances.  Mildly but earnestly the poor girl begged him\nto spare apologies.  It was enough that he no longer loved her, and\nthat they must bid farewell.  Trusting to the yielding tenderness\nof her character, he ventured, in the most soothing accents, to\nsuggest that as he still loved her better than all the world, she\nwould ever be his real wife, and they might see each other\nfrequently.  He was not prepared for the storm of indignant\nemotion his words excited.  True, she was his slave; her bones,\nand sinews had been purchased by his gold, yet she had the heart\nof a true woman, and hers was a passion too deep and absorbing to\nadmit of partnership, and her spirit was too pure to form a\nselfish league with crime.\n\nAt length this painful interview came to an end.  They stood\ntogether by the Gothic gate, where they had so often met and\nparted in the moonlight.  Old remembrances melted their souls.\n\"Farewell, dearest Horatio,\" said Clotel.  \"Give me a parting\nkiss.\"  Her voice was choked for utterance, and the tears flowed\nfreely, as she bent her lips toward him.  He folded her\nconvulsively in his arms, and imprinted a long impassioned kiss on\nthat mouth, which had never spoken to him but in love and\nblessing.  With efforts like a death-pang she at length raised her\nhead from his heaving bosom, and turning from him with bitter\nsobs, \"It is our last.  To meet thus is henceforth crime.  God\nbless you.  I would not have you so miserable as I am.  Farewell.\nA last farewell.\"  \"The last?\" exclaimed he, with a wild shriek.\n\"Oh God, Clotel, do not say that\"; and covering his face with his\nhands, he wept like a child.  Recovering from his\nemotion, he found himself alone.  The moon looked down upon him\nmild, but very sorrowfully; as the Madonna seems to gaze upon her\nworshipping children, bowed down with consciousness of sin.  At\nthat moment he would have given worlds to have disengaged himself\nfrom Gertrude, but he had gone so far, that blame, disgrace, and\nduels with angry relatives would now attend any effort to obtain\nhis freedom.  Oh, how the moonlight oppressed him with its\nfriendly sadness!  It was like the plaintive eye of his forsaken\none, like the music of sorrow echoed from an unseen world.  Long\nand earnestly he gazed at that cottage, where he had so long\nknown earth's purest foretaste of heavenly bliss.  Slowly he\nwalked away; then turned again to look on that charmed spot, the\nnestling-place of his early affections.  He caught a glimpse of\nClotel, weeping beside a magnolia, which commanded a long view of\nthe path leading to the public road.  He would have sprung toward\nher but she darted from him, and entered the cottage.  That\ngraceful figure, weeping in the moonlight, haunted him for years.\nIt stood before his closing eyes, and greeted him with the\nmorning dawn.  Poor Gertrude, had she known all, what a dreary lot\nwould hers have been; but fortunately she could not miss the\nimpassioned tenderness she never experienced; and Horatio was the\nmore careful in his kindness, because he was deficient in love.\nAfter Clotel had been separated from her mother and sister, she\nturned her attention to the subject of Christianity, and received\nthat consolation from her Bible that is never denied to the\nchildren of God.  Although it was against the laws of Virginia,\nfor a slave to be taught to read, Currer had employed an old free\nNegro, who lived near her, to teach her two daughters to read and\nwrite.  She felt that the step she had taken in resolving\nnever to meet Horatio again would no doubt expose her to his\nwrath, and probably cause her to be sold, yet her heart was too\nguileless for her to commit a crime, and therefore she had ten\ntimes rather have been sold as a slave than do wrong.  Some months\nafter the marriage of Horatio and Gertrude their barouche rolled\nalong a winding road that skirted the forest near Clotel's\ncottage, when the attention of Gertrude was suddenly attracted by\ntwo figures among the trees by the wayside; and touching Horatio's\narm, she exclaimed, \"Do look at that beautiful child.\"  He turned\nand saw Clotel and Mary.  His lips quivered, and his face became\ndeadly pale.  His young wife looked at him intently, but said\nnothing.  In returning home, he took another road; but his wife\nseeing this, expressed a wish to go back the way they had come.\nHe objected, and suspicion was awakened in her heart, and she\nsoon after learned that the mother of that lovely child bore the\nname of Clotel, a name which she had often heard Horatio murmur in\nuneasy slumbers.  From gossiping tongues she soon learned more\nthan she wished to know.  She wept, but not as poor Clotel had\ndone; for she never had loved, and been beloved like her, and her\nnature was more proud: henceforth a change came over her feelings\nand her manners, and Horatio had no further occasion to assume a\ntenderness in return for hers.  Changed as he was by ambition, he\nfelt the wintry chill of her polite propriety, and sometimes, in\nagony of heart, compared it with the gushing love of her who was\nindeed his wife.  But these and all his emotions were a sealed\nbook to Clotel, of which she could only guess the contents.  With\nremittances for her and her child's support, there sometimes came\nearnest pleadings that she would consent to see him again; but\nthese she never answered, though her heart yearned to do so.\nShe pitied his young bride, and would not be tempted to\nbring sorrow into her household by any fault of hers.  Her earnest\nprayer was, that she might not know of her existence.  She had not\nlooked on Horatio since she watched him under the shadow of the\nmagnolia, until his barouche passed her in her rambles some months\nafter.  She saw the deadly paleness of his countenance, and had he\ndared to look back, he would have seen her tottering with\nfaintness.  Mary brought water from a rivulet, and sprinkled her\nface.  When she revived, she clasped the beloved child to her\nheart with a vehemence that made her scream.  Soothingly she\nkissed away her fears, and gazed into her beautiful eyes with a\ndeep, deep sadness of expression, which poor Mary never forgot.\nWild were the thoughts that passed round her aching heart, and\nalmost maddened her poor brain; thoughts which had almost driven\nher to suicide the night of that last farewell.  For her child's\nsake she had conquered the fierce temptation then; and for her\nsake, she struggled with it now.  But the gloomy atmosphere of\ntheir once happy home overclouded the morning of Mary's life.\nClotel perceived this, and it gave her unutterable pain.\n\n    \"Tis ever thus with woman's love,\n   True till life's storms have passed;\n   And, like the vine around the tree,\n       It braves them to the last.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MAN OF HONOUR\n\n\"My tongue could never learn sweet soothing words,\nBut now thy beauty is propos'd, my fee,\nMy proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\"\n\nShakespeare.\n\n\nJAMES CRAWFORD, the purchaser of Althesa, was from the green\nmountains of Vermont, and his feelings were opposed to the\nholding of slaves.  But his young wife persuaded him into the idea\nthat it was no worse to own a slave than to hire one and pay the\nmoney to another.  Hence it was that he had been induced to\npurchase Althesa.  Henry Morton, a young physician from the same\nstate, and who had just commenced the practice of his profession\nin New Orleans, was boarding with Crawford when Althesa was\nbrought home.  The young physician had been in New Orleans but a\nfew weeks, and had seen very little of slavery.  In his own\nmountain home he had been taught that the slaves of the Southern\nstates were Negroes, if not from the coast of Africa, the\ndescendants of those who had been imported.  He was unprepared to\nbehold with composure a beautiful young white girl of fifteen in\nthe degraded position of a chattel slave.  The blood chilled in\nhis young heart as he heard Crawford tell how, by bartering with\nthe trader, he had bought her for two hundred dollars less than\nhe first asked.  His very looks showed that the slave girl had the\ndeepest sympathy of his heart.  Althesa had been brought up by her\nmother to look after the domestic concerns of her cottage in\nVirginia, and knew well the duties imposed upon her.  Mrs.\nCrawford was much pleased with her new servant, and often made\nmention of her in the presence of Morton.  The young man's\nsympathy ripened into love, which was reciprocated by the\nfriendless and injured child of sorrow.  There was but one course\nleft; that was, to purchase the young girl and make her his wife,\nwhich he did six months after her arrival in Crawford's family.\nThe young physician and his wife immediately took lodgings in\nanother part of the city; a private teacher was called in, and\nthe young wife taught some of those accomplishments which are\nnecessary for one's taking a position in society.  Dr. Morton soon\nobtained a large practice in his profession, and with it\nincreased in wealth--but with all his wealth he never would own a\nslave.  Mrs. Morton was now in a position to seek out and redeem\nher mother, whom she had not heard of since they parted at\nNatchez.  An agent was immediately despatched to hunt out the\nmother and to see if she could be purchased.  The agent had no\ntrouble in finding out Mr. Peck: but all overtures were\nunavailable; he would not sell Currer.  His excuse was, that she\nwas such a good housekeeper that he could not spare her.  Poor\nAlthesa felt sad when she found that her mother could not be\nbought.  However, she felt a consciousness of having done her duty\nin the matter, yet waited with the hope that the day might come\nwhen she should have her mother by her side.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE YOUNG CHRISTIAN\n\n\"Here we see God dealing in slaves; giving them to his own\nfavourite child [Abraham], a man of superlative worth, and as a\nreward for his eminent goodness.\"--Rev. Theodore Clapp, of New\nOrleans.\n\nON Carlton's return the next day from the farm, he was overwhelmed\nwith questions from Mr. Peck, as to what he thought of the\nplantation, the condition of the Negroes, Huckelby and Snyder;\nand especially how he liked the sermon of the latter.  Mr. Peck was\na kind of a patriarch in his own way.  To begin with, he was a man\nof some talent.  He not only had a good education, but was a man\nof great eloquence, and had a wonderful command of language.  He\ntoo either had, or thought he had, poetical genius; and was often\nsending contributions to the Natchez Free Trader, and other\nperiodicals.  In the way of raising contributions for foreign\nmissions, he took the lead of all others in his neighbourhood.\nEverything he did, he did for the \"glory of God,\" as he said: he\nquoted Scripture for almost everything he did.  Being in good\ncircumstances, he was able to give to almost all benevolent\ncauses to which he took a fancy.  He was a most loving father, and\nhis daughter exercised considerable influence over him, and owing\nto her piety and judgment, that influence had a beneficial effect.\nCarlton, though a schoolfellow of the parson's, was nevertheless\nnearly ten years his junior; and though not an avowed infidel,\nwas, however, a freethinker, and one who took no note of\nto-morrow.  And for this reason Georgiana took peculiar interest\nin the young man, for Carlton was but little above thirty and\nunmarried.  The young Christian felt that she would not be living\nup to that faith that she professed and believed in, if she did\nnot exert herself to the utmost to save the thoughtless man from\nhis downward career; and in this she succeeded to her most\nsanguine expectations.  She not only converted him, but in placing\nthe Scriptures before him in their true light, she redeemed those\nsacred writings from the charge of supporting the system of\nslavery, which her father had cast upon them in the discussion\nsome days before.\n\nGeorgiana's first object, however, was to awaken in Carlton's\nbreast a love for the Lord Jesus Christ.  The young man had often\nsat under the sound of the gospel with perfect indifference.  He\nhad heard men talk who had grown grey bending over the Scriptures,\nand their conversation had passed by him unheeded; but when a\nyoung girl, much younger than himself, reasoned with him in that\ninnocent and persuasive manner that woman is wont to use when she\nhas entered with her whole soul upon an object, it was too much\nfor his stout heart, and he yielded.  Her next aim was to vindicate\nthe Bible from sustaining the monstrous institution of slavery.\nShe said, \"God has created of one blood all the nations of men,\nto dwell on all the face of the earth.  To claim, hold, and treat a\nhuman being as property is felony against God and man.  The\nChristian religion is opposed to slaveholding in its spirit and\nits principles; it classes menstealers among murderers; and it is\nthe duty of all who wish to meet God in peace, to discharge that\nduty in spreading these principles.  Let us not deceive ourselves\ninto the idea that slavery is right, because it is profitable to\nus.  Slaveholding is the highest possible violation of\nthe eighth commandment.  To take from a man his earnings, is theft;\nbut to take the earner is a compound, life-long theft; and we who\nprofess to follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer, should do our\nutmost to extirpate slavery from the land.  For my own part, I\nshall do all I can.  When the Redeemer was about to ascend to the\nbosom of the Father, and resume the glory which he had with him\nbefore the world was, he promised his disciples that the power of\nthe Holy Ghost should come upon them, and that they should be\nwitnesses for him to the uttermost parts of the earth.  What was\nthe effect upon their minds?  'They all continued with one accord\nin prayer and supplication with the women.'  Stimulated by the\nconfident expectation that Jesus would fulfil his gracious\npromise, they poured out their hearts in fervent supplications,\nprobably for strength to do the work which he had appointed them\nunto, for they felt that without him they could do nothing, and\nthey consecrated themselves on the altar of God, to the great and\nglorious enterprise of preaching the unsearchable riches of\nChrist to a lost and perishing world.  Have we less precious\npromises in the Scriptures of truth?  May we not claim of our God\nthe blessing promised unto those who consider the poor: the Lord\nwill preserve them and keep them alive, and they shall be blessed\nupon the earth?  Does not the language, 'Inasmuch as ye did it unto\none of the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me,'\nbelong to all who are rightly engaged in endeavouring to\nunloose the bondman's fetters?  Shall we not then do as the\napostles did?  Shall we not, in view of the two millions of\nheathen in our very midst, in view of the souls that are going\ndown in an almost unbroken phalanx to utter perdition, continue\nin prayer and supplication, that God will grant us the\nsupplies of his Spirit to prepare us for that work which he has\ngiven us to do?  Shall not the wail of the mother as she\nsurrenders her only child to the grasp of the ruthless kidnapper,\nor the trader in human blood, animate our devotions?  Shall not the\nmanifold crimes and horrors of slavery excite more ardent\noutpourings at the throne of grace to grant repentance to our\nguilty country, and permit us to aid in preparing the way for the\nglorious second advent of the Messiah, by preaching deliverance\nto the captives, and the opening of the prison doors to those who\nare bound?\"\n\nGeorgiana had succeeded in riveting the attention of Carlton\nduring her conversation, and as she was finishing her last\nsentence, she observed the silent tear stealing down the cheek of\nthe newly born child of God.  At this juncture her father entered,\nand Carlton left the room.  \"Dear papa,\" said Georgiana, \"will you\ngrant me one favour; or, rather, make me a promise?\"  \"I can't\ntell, my dear, till I know what it is,\" replied Mr. Peck.  \"If it\nis a reasonable request, I will comply with your wish,\" continued\nhe.  \"I hope, my dear,\" answered she, \"that papa would not think\nme capable of making an unreasonable request.\"  \"Well, well,\"\nreturned he; \"tell me what it is.\"  \"I hope,\" said she, \"that in\nyour future conversation with Mr. Carlton, on the subject of\nslavery, you will not speak of the Bible as sustaining it.\"  \"Why,\nGeorgiana, my dear, you are mad, ain't you?\" exclaimed he, in an\nexcited tone.  The poor girl remained silent; the father saw in a\nmoment that he had spoken too sharply; and taking her hand in his\nhe said, \"Now, my child, why do you make that request?\"\n\"Because,\" returned she, \"I think he is on the stool of\nrepentance, if he has not already been received among the elect.\nHe, you know, was bordering upon infidelity, and if the\nBible sanctions slavery, then he will naturally enough say that\nit is not from God; for the argument from internal evidence is\nnot only refuted, but actually turned against the Bible.  If the\nBible sanctions slavery, then it misrepresents the character of\nGod.  Nothing would be more dangerous to the soul of a young\nconvert than to satisfy him that the Scriptures favoured such a\nsystem of sin.\"  \"Don't you suppose that I understand the\nScriptures better than you?  I have been in the world longer.\"\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"you have been in the world longer, and amongst\nslaveholders so long that you do not regard it in the same light\nthat those do who have not become so familiar with its every-day\nscenes as you.  I once heard you say, that you were opposed to the\ninstitution, when you first came to the South.\"  \"Yes,\" answered\nhe, \"I did not know so much about it then.\"  \"With great deference\nto you, papa,\" replied Georgiana, \"I don't think that the Bible\nsanctions slavery.  The Old Testament contains this explicit\ncondemnation of it, 'He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or\nif he be found in his band, he shall surely be put to death'; and\n'Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his\nchambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without\nwages, and giveth him not for his work'; when also the New\nTestament exhibits such words of rebuke as these, 'Behold the hire\nof the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of\nyou kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them who have\nreaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.'  'The\nlaw is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and\ndisobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and\nprofane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for\nmanslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves\nwith mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured\npersons.'  A more scathing denunciation of the sin in question is\nsurely to be found on record in no other book.  I am afraid,\"\ncontinued the daughter, \"that the acts of the professed friends of\nChristianity in the South do more to spread infidelity than the\nwritings of all the atheists which have ever been published.  The\ninfidel watches the religious world.  He surveys the church, and,\nlo! thousands and tens of thousands of her accredited members\nactually hold slaves.  Members 'in good and regular standing,'\nfellowshipped throughout Christendom except by a few anti-slavery\nchurches generally despised as ultra and radical, reduce their\nfellow men to the condition of chattels, and by force keep them in\nthat state of degradation.  Bishops, ministers, elders, and\ndeacons are engaged in this awful business, and do not consider\ntheir conduct as at all inconsistent with the precepts of either\nthe Old or New Testaments.  Moreover, those ministers and churches\nwho do not themselves hold slaves, very generally defend the\nconduct of those who do, and accord to them a fair Christian\ncharacter, and in the way of business frequently take mortgages\nand levy executions on the bodies of their fellow men, and in\nsome cases of their fellow Christians.  \"Now is it a wonder that\ninfidels, beholding the practice and listening to the theory of\nprofessing Christians, should conclude that the Bible inculcates\na morality not inconsistent with chattelising human beings?  And\nmust not this conclusion be strengthened, when they hear ministers\nof talent and learning declare that the Bible does sanction\nslaveholding, and that it ought not to be made a disciplinable\noffence in churches?  And must not all doubt be dissipated, when\none of the most learned professors in our theological seminaries\nasserts that the Bible recognises that the relation may still\nexist, salva fide et salva ecclesia' (without injury to\nthe Christian faith or church) and that only 'the abuse of it is\nthe essential and fundamental wrong?'  Are not infidels bound to\nbelieve that these professors, ministers, and churches understand\ntheir own Bible, and that, consequently, notwithstanding solitary\npassages which appear to condemn slaveholding, the Bible\nsanctions it?  When nothing can be further from the truth.  And as\nfor Christ, his whole life was a living testimony against slavery\nand all that it inculcates.  When he designed to do us good, he\ntook upon himself the form of a servant.  He took his station at\nthe bottom of society.  He voluntarily identified himself with the\npoor and the despised.  The warning voices of Jeremiah and Ezekiel\nwere raised in olden time, against sin.  Let us not forget what\nfollowed.  'Therefore, thus saith the Lord--ye have not harkened\nunto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, and\nevery one to his neighbour--behold I proclaim a liberty for you,\nsaith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the\nfamine.'  Are we not virtually as a nation adopting the same\nimpious language, and are we not exposed to the same tremendous\njudgments?  Shall we not, in view of those things, use every\nlaudable means to awaken our beloved country from the slumbers of\ndeath, and baptize all our efforts with tears and with prayers,\nthat God may bless them?  Then, should our labour fail to\naccomplish the end for which we pray, we shall stand acquitted at\nthe bar of Jehovah, and although we may share in the national\ncalamities which await unrepented sins, yet that blessed approval\nwill be ours--'Well done, good and faithful servants, enter ye into\nthe joy of your Lord.'\"\n\n\"My dear Georgiana,\" said Mr. Peck, \"I must be permitted to\nentertain my own views on this subject, and to exercise my own\njudgment.\"\n\n\"Believe me, dear papa,\" she replied, \"I would not be understood\nas wishing to teach you, or to dictate to you in the least; but\nonly grant my request, not to allude to the Bible as sanctioning\nslavery, when speaking with Mr. Carlton.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned he, \"I will comply with your wish.\"\n\nThe young Christian had indeed accomplished a noble work; and\nwhether it was admitted by the father, or not, she was his\nsuperior and his teacher.  Georgiana had viewed the right to enjoy\nperfect liberty as one of those inherent and inalienable rights\nwhich pertain to the whole human race, and of which they can\nnever be divested, except by an act of gross injustice.  And no\none was more able than herself to impress those views upon the\nhearts of all with whom she came in contact.  Modest and\nself-possessed, with a voice of great sweetness, and a most\nwinning manner, she could, with the greatest ease to herself,\nengage their attention.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE PARSON POET\n\n\"Unbind, unbind my galling chain,\n    And set, oh! set me free:\n No longer say that I'll disdain\n      The gift of liberty.\"\n\nTHROUGH the persuasion of Mr. Peck, and fascinated with the\ncharms of Georgiana, Carlton had prolonged his stay two months\nwith his old school-fellow.  During the latter part of the time he\nhad been almost as one of the family.  If Miss Peck was invited\nout, Mr. Carlton was, as a matter of course.  She seldom rode\nout, unless with him.  If Mr. Peck was absent, he took the head of\nthe table; and, to the delight of the young lady, he had on\nseveral occasions taken part in the family worship.  \"I am glad,\"\nsaid Mr.  Peck, one evening while at the tea table, \"I am glad,\nMr. Carlton, that my neighbour Jones has invited you to visit him\nat his farm.  He is a good neighbour, but a very ungodly man; I\nwant that you should see his people, and then, when you return to\nthe North, you can tell how much better a Christian's slaves are\nsituated than one who does nothing for the cause of Christ.\"  \"I\nhope, Mr. Carlton,\" said Georgiana, \"that you will spend the\nSabbath with him, and have a religious interview with the\nNegroes.\"  \"Yes,\" replied the parson, \"that's well thought of,\nGeorgy.\"  \"Well, I think I will go up on Thursday next, and stay\ntill Monday,\" said Carlton; \"and I shall act upon your\nsuggestion, Miss Peck,\" continued he; \"and try to get a\nreligious interview with the blacks.  By-the-by,\" remarked\nCarlton, \"I saw an advertisement in the Free Trader to-day that\nrather puzzled me.  Ah, here it is now; and, drawing the paper\nfrom his pocket, \"I will read it, and then you can tell me what\nit means:\n\n'To PLANTERS AND OTHERS.--Wanted fifty Negroes.  Any person having\nsick Negroes, considered incurable by their respective\nphysicians, (their owners of course,) and wishing to dispose of\nthem, Dr. Stillman will pay cash for Negroes affected with\nscrofula or king's evil, confirmed hypochondriacism, apoplexy, or\ndiseases of the brain, kidneys, spleen, stomach and intestines,\nbladder and its appendages, diarrhoea, dysentery, &c.  The highest\ncash price will be paid as above.'\n\nWhen I read this to-day I thought that the advertiser must be a\nman of eminent skill as a physician, and that he intended to cure\nthe sick Negroes; but on second thought I find that some of the\ndiseases enumerated are certainly incurable.  What can he do with\nthese sick Negroes?\"  \"You see,\" replied Mr. Peck, laughing, \"that\nhe is a doctor, and has use for them in his lectures.  The doctor\nis connected with a small college.  Look at his prospectus, where\nhe invites students to attend, and that will explain the matter\nto you.\"  Carlton turned to another column, and read the\nfollowing:\n\n\"Some advantages of a peculiar character are connected with this\ninstitution, which it may be proper to point out.  No place in the\nUnited States offers as great opportunities for the acquisition\nof anatomical knowledge.  Subjects being obtained from among the\ncoloured population in sufficient numbers for every purpose, and\nproper dissections carried on without offending any individuals in\nthe community!\"\n\n\"These are for dissection, then?\" inquired Carlton with a\ntrembling voice.  \"Yes,\" answered the parson.  \"Of course they wait\ntill they die before they can use them.\"  \"They keep them on\nhand, and when they need one they bleed him to death,\" returned\nMr. Peck.  \"Yes, but that's murder.\"  \"Oh, the doctors are licensed\nto commit murder, you know; and what's the difference, whether\none dies owing to the loss of blood, or taking too many pills?\nFor my own part, if I had to choose, I would rather submit to the\nformer.\"  \"I have often heard what I considered hard stories in\nabolition meetings in New York about slavery; but now I shall\nbegin to think that many of them are true.\"  \"The longer you\nremain here the more you will be convinced of the iniquity of the\ninstitution,\" remarked Georgiana.  \"Now, Georgy, my dear, don't\ngive us another abolition lecture, if you please,\" said Mr. Peck.\n\"Here, Carlton,\" continued the parson, \"I have written a short\npoem for your sister's album, as you requested me; it is a\ndomestic piece, as you will see.\"  \"She will prize it the more for\nthat,\" remarked Carlton; and taking the sheet of paper, he\nlaughed as his eyes glanced over it.  \"Read it out, Mr. Carlton,\"\nsaid Georgiana, \"and let me hear what it is; I know papa gets off\nsome very droll things at times.\"  Carlton complied with the young\nlady's request, and read aloud the following rare specimen of\npoetical genius:\n\n                  \"MY LITTLE NIG.\n\n        \"I have a little nigger, the blackest thing alive,\n    He'll be just four years old if he lives till forty-five;\n His smooth cheek hath a glossy hue, like a new polished boot,\n And his hair curls o'er his little head as black as any soot.\n His lips bulge from his countenance--his little ivories shine--\n His nose is what we call a little pug, but fashioned very fine:\n       Although not quite a fairy, he is comely to behold,\nAnd I wouldn't sell him, 'pon my word, for a hundred all in gold.\n\n     \"He gets up early in the morn, like all the other nigs,\n And runs off to the hog-lot, where he squabbles with the pigs--\n   And when the sun gets out of bed, and mounts up in the sky,\n     The warmest corner of the yard is where my nig doth lie.\n      And there extended lazily, he contemplates and dreams,\n     (I cannot qualify to this, but plain enough it seems;)\n Until 'tis time to take in grub, when you can't find him there,\n      For, like a politician, he has gone to hunt his share.\n\n     \"I haven't said a single word concerning my plantation,\n Though a prettier, I guess, cannot be found within the nation;\n   When he gets a little bigger, I'll take and to him show it,\n And then I'll say, 'My little nig, now just prepare to go it!'\n   I'll put a hoe into his hand--he'll soon know what it means,\n And every day for dinner, he shall have bacon and greens.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA NIGHT IN THE PARSON'S KITCHEN\n\n      \"And see the servants met,\n      Their daily labour's o'er;\n And with the jest and song they set\n       The kitchen in a roar.\"\n\nMR. PECK kept around him four servants besides Currer, of whom we\nhave made mention: of these, Sam was considered the first.  If a\ndinner-party was in contemplation, or any company to be invited\nto the parson's, after all the arrangements had been talked over\nby the minister and his daughter, Sam was sure to be consulted\nupon the subject by \"Miss Georgy,\" as Miss Peck was called by the\nservants.  If furniture, crockery, or anything else was to be\npurchased, Sam felt that he had been slighted if his opinion had\nnot been asked.  As to the marketing, he did it all.  At the\nservants' table in the kitchen, he sat at the head, and was\nmaster of ceremonies.  A single look from him was enough to\nsilence any conversation or noise in the kitchen, or any other\npart of the premises.  There is, in the Southern States, a great\namount of prejudice against colour amongst the Negroes\nthemselves.  The nearer the Negro or mulatto approaches to the\nwhite, the more he seems to feel his superiority over those of a\ndarker hue.  This is, no doubt, the result of the prejudice that\nexists on the part of the whites towards both mulattoes and\nblacks.  Sam was originally from Kentucky, and through the\ninstrumentality of one of his young masters whom he had to take\nto school, he had learned to read so as to be well understood;\nand, owing to that fact, was considered a prodigy among the\nslaves, not only of his own master's, but those of the town who\nknew him.  Sam had a great wish to follow in the footsteps of his\nmaster, and be a poet; and was, therefore, often heard singing\ndoggerels of his own composition.  But there was one great drawback\nto Sam, and that was his colour.  He was one of the blackest of\nhis race.  This he evidently regarded as a great misfortune.\nHowever, he made up for this in his dress.  Mr. Peck kept his\nhouse servants well dressed; and as for Sam, he was seldom seen\nexcept in a ruffled shirt.  Indeed, the washerwoman feared him\nmore than all others about the house.\n\nCurrer, as we have already stated, was chief of the kitchen\ndepartment, and had a general supervision of the household\naffairs.  Alfred the coachman, Peter, and Hetty made up the\nremainder of the house servants.  Besides these, Mr. Peck owned\neight slaves who were masons.  These worked in the city.  Being\nmechanics, they were let out to greater advantage than to keep\nthem on the farm.  However, every Sunday night, Peck's servants,\nincluding the bricklayers, usually assembled in the kitchen, when\nthe events of the week were freely discussed and commented on.\nIt was on a Sunday evening, in the month of June, that there was\na party at Mr. Peck's, and, according to custom in the Southern\nStates, the ladies had their maid-servants with them.  Tea had\nbeen served in \"the house,\" and the servants, including the\nstrangers, had taken their seats at the tea table in the kitchen.\nSam, being a \"single gentleman,\" was usually attentive to the\n\"ladies\" on this occasion.  He seldom or ever let the day pass\nwithout spending at least an hour in combing and brushing up his\n\"hair.\"  Sam had an idea that fresh butter was better for his hair\nthan any other kind of grease; and therefore, on churning days,\nhalf a pound of butter had always to be taken out before it was\nsalted.  When he wished to appear to great advantage, he would\ngrease his face, to make it \"shiny.\"  On the evening of the party\ntherefore, when all the servants were at the table, Sam cut a\nbig figure.  There he sat with his wool well combed and buttered,\nface nicely greased, and his ruffles extending five or six inches\nfrom his breast.  The parson in his own drawing-room did not make\na more imposing appearance than did his servant on this occasion.\n\"I jist bin had my fortune told last Sunday night,\" said Sam, as\nhe helped one of the girls to some sweet hash.  \"Indeed,\" cried\nhalf-a-dozen voices.  \"Yes,\" continued he; \"Aunt Winny teld me I\nis to hab de prettiest yaller gal in town, and dat I is to be\nfree.\"  All eyes were immediately turned toward Sally Johnson, who\nwas seated near Sarn.  \"I speck I see somebody blush at dat\nremark,\" said Alfred.  \"Pass dem pancakes and molasses up dis way,\nMr. Alf, and none of your insinawaysion here,\" rejoined Sam.  \"Dat\nreminds me,\" said Currer, \"dat Doreas Simpson is gwine to git\nmarried.\"  \"Who to, I want to know?\" inquired Peter.  \"To one of\nMr. Darby's field-hands,\" answered Currer.  \"I should tink dat dat\ngal would not trow hersef away in dat manner,\" said Sally.  \"She\ngood enough looking to get a house servant, and not to put up wid\na fiel' nigger,\" continued she.  \"Yes,\" said Sam, \"dat's a wery\ninsensible remark of yours, Miss Sally.  I admire your judgment\nwery much, I assure you.  Dah's plenty of suspectible and\nwell-dressed house servants dat a gal of her looks can get, wid\nout taken up wid dem common darkies.\"  \"Is de man black or a\nmulatto?\" inquired one of the company.  \"He's nearly white,\"\nreplied Currer. \"Well den, dat's some exchuse for her,\"\nremarked Sam; \"for I don't like to see dis malgemation of blacks\nand mulattoes.\"  \"No mulatto?\" inquired one of the corn-how.\nContinued Sam, \"If I had my rights I would be a mulatto too, for\nmy mother was almost as light-coloured as Miss Sally,\" said he.\nAlthough Sam was one of the blackest men living, he nevertheless\ncontended that his mother was a mulatto, and no one was more\nprejudiced against the blacks than he.  A good deal of work, and\nthe free use of fresh butter, had no doubt done wonders for his\n\"hare\" in causing it to grow long, and to this he would always\nappeal when he wished to convince others that he was part of an\nAnglo-Saxon.  \"I always thought you was not clear black, Mr. Sam,\"\nsaid Agnes.  \"You are right dahr, Miss Agnes.  My hare tells what\ncompany I belong to,\" answered Sam.  Here the whole company joined\nin the conversation about colour, which lasted for some time,\ngiving unmistakeable evidence that caste is owing to ignorance.\nThe evening's entertainment concluded by Sam's relating a little\nof his own experience while with his first master in old\nKentucky.\n\nSam's former master was a doctor, and had a large practice among\nhis neighbours, doctoring both masters and slaves.  When Sam was\nabout fifteen years of age, his old master set him to grinding up\nthe ointment, then to making pills.  As the young student grew\nolder and became more practised in his profession, his services\nwere of more importance to the doctor.  The physician having a\ngood business, and a large number of his patients being slaves,\nthe most of whom had to call on the doctor when ill, he put Sam\nto bleeding, pulling teeth, and administering medicine to the\nslaves.  Sam soon acquired the name amongst the slaves of the\n\"Black Doctor.\"  With this appellation he was delighted, and no\nregular physician could possibly have put on more airs than did\nthe black doctor when his services were required.  In bleeding, he\nmust have more bandages, and rub and smack the arm more than the\ndoctor would have thought of.  We once saw Sam taking out a tooth\nfor one of his patients, and nothing appeared more amusing.  He\ngot the poor fellow down on his back, and he got astraddle of the\nman's chest, and getting the turnkeys on the wrong tooth, he shut\nboth eyes and pulled for his life.  The poor man screamed as loud\nas he could, but to no purpose.  Sam had him fast.  After a great\neffort, out came the sound grinder, and the young doctor saw his\nmistake; but consoled himself with the idea that as the wrong\ntooth was out of the way, there was more room to get at the right\none.  Bleeding and a dose of calomel was always considered\nindispensable by the \"Old Boss\"; and, as a matter of course, Sam\nfollowed in his footsteps.\n\nOn one occasion the old doctor was ill himself, so as to be unable\nto attend to his patients.  A slave, with pass in hand, called to\nreceive medical advice, and the master told Sam to examine him\nand see what he wanted.  This delighted him beyond measure, for\nalthough he had been acting his part in the way of giving out\nmedicine as the master ordered it, he had never been called upon\nby the latter to examine a patient, and this seemed to convince\nhim that, after all, he was no sham doctor.  As might have been\nexpected, he cut a rare figure in his first examination, placing\nhimself directly opposite his patient, and folding his arms\nacross his breast, and looking very knowingly, he began, \"What's\nde matter wid you?\"  \"I is sick.\"  \"Where is you sick?\"  \"Here,\"\nreplied the man, putting his hand upon his stomach.  \"Put out your\ntongue,\" continued the doctor.  The man ran out his tongue at full\nlength.  \"Let me feel your pulse,\" at the same time taking his\npatient's hand in his, placing his fingers on his pulse, he said,\n\"Ah, your case is a bad one; if I don't do something for you, and\ndat pretty quick, you'll be a gone coon, and dat's sartin.\"  At\nthis the man appeared frightened, and inquired what was the matter\nwith him: in answer, Sam said, \"I done told you dat your case is\na bad one, and dat's enough.\"  On Sam's returning to his master's\nbedside, the latter said, \"Well, Sam, what do you think is the\nmatter with him?\"  \"His stomach is out of order, sir,\" he replied.\n\"What do you think had best be done for him?\"  \"I think I better\nbleed him and give him a dose of calomel,\" returned Sam.  So to\nthe latter's gratification the master let him have his own way.\nWe need not further say, that the recital of Sam's experience as a\nphysician gave him a high position amongst the servants that\nevening, and made him a decided favourite with the ladies, one of\nwhom feigned illness, when the black doctor, to the delight of\nall, and certainly to himself, gave medical advice.  Thus ended\nthe evening amongst the servants in the parson's kitchen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA SLAVE HUNTING PARSON\n\n  \"'Tis too much prov'd--that with devotion's visage,\n And pious action, we do sugar o'er the devil himself.\"\n\n--Shakespeare.\n\n\n\"You will, no doubt, be well pleased with neighbour Jones,\" said\nMr. Peck, as Carlton stepped into the chaise to pay his promised\nvisit to the \"ungodly man.\"  \"Don't forget to have a religious\ninterview with the Negroes, remarked Georgiana, as she gave the\nlast nod to her young convert.  \"I will do my best,\" returned\nCarlton, as the vehicle left the door.  As might have been\nexpected, Carlton met with a cordial reception at the hands of\nthe proprietor of the Grove Farm.  The servants in the \"Great\nHouse\" were well dressed, and appeared as if they did not want\nfor food.  Jones knew that Carlton was from the North, and a\nnon-slaveholder, and therefore did everything in his power to\nmake a favourable impression on his mind.  \"My Negroes are well\nclothed, well fed, and not over worked,\" said the slaveholder to\nhis visitor, after the latter had been with him nearly a week.\n\"As far as I can see your slaves appear to good advantage,\"\nreplied Carlton.  \"But,\" continued he, \"if it is a fair question,\ndo you have preaching among your slaves on Sunday, Mr. Jones?\"\n\"No, no,\" returned he, \"I think that's all nonsense; my Negroes\ndo their own preaching.\"  \"So you do permit them to have\nmeetings.\"  \"Yes, when they wish.  There's some very intelligent\nand clever chaps among them.\"  \"As to-morrow is the Sabbath,\"\nsaid Carlton, \"if you have no objection, I will attend meeting\nwith them.\"  \"Most certainly you shall, if you will do the\npreaching,\" returned the planter.  Here the young man was about\nto decline, but he remembered the parting words of Georgiana, and\nhe took courage and said, \"Oh, I have no objection to give the\nNegroes a short talk.\"  It was then understood that Carlton was to\nhave a religious interview with the blacks the next day, and the\nyoung man waited with a degree of impatience for the time.\n\nIn no part of the South are slaves in a more ignorant and degraded\nstate than in the cotton, sugar, and rice districts.\n\nIf they are permitted to cease labour on the Sabbath, the time is\nspent in hunting, fishing, or lying beneath the shade of a tree,\nresting for the morrow.  Religious instruction is unknown in the\nfar South, except among such men as the Rev. C. C. Jones, John\nPeck, and some others who regard religious instruction, such as\nthey impart to their slaves, as calculated to make them more\ntrustworthy and valuable as property.  Jones, aware that his\nslaves would make rather a bad show of intelligence if questioned\nby Carlton, resolved to have them ready for him, and therefore\ngave his driver orders with regard to their preparation.\nConsequently, after the day's labour was over, Dogget, the\ndriver, assembled the Negroes together and said, \"Now, boys and\ngals, your master is coming down to the quarters to-morrow with\nhis visitor, who is going to give you a preach, and I want you\nshould understand what he says to you.  Now many of you who came\nof Old Virginia and Kentuck, know what preaching is, and others\nwho have been raised in these parts do not.  Preaching is to tell\nyou that you are mighty wicked and bad at heart.  This, I suppose,\nyou all know.  But if the gentleman should ask you who\nmade you, tell him the Lord; if he ask if you wish to go to\nheaven, tell him yes.  Remember that you are all Christians, all\nlove the Lord, all want to go to heaven, all love your masters,\nand all love me.  Now, boys and gals, I want you to show\nyourselves smart to-morrow: be on your p's and q's, and, Monday\nmorning, I will give you all a glass of whiskey bright and\nearly.\"  Agreeable to arrangement the slaves were assembled\ntogether on Sunday morning under the large trees near the great\nhouse, and after going through another drilling from the driver,\nJones and Carlton made their appearance.  \"You see,\" said Jones to\nthe Negroes, as he approached them, you see here's a gentleman\nthat's come to talk to you about your souls, and I hope you 'ill\nall pay that attention that you ought.\"  Jones then seated himself\nin one of the two chairs placed there for him and the stranger.\n\nCarlton had already selected a chapter in the Bible to read to\nthem, which he did, after first prefacing it with some remarks of\nhis own.  Not being accustomed to speak in public, he determined,\nafter reading the Bible, to make it more of a conversational\nmeeting than otherwise.  He therefore began asking them questions.\n\"Do you feel that you are a Christian?\" asked he of a\nfull-blooded Negro that sat near him.  \"Yes, sir,\" was the\nresponse.  \"You feel, then, that you shall go to heaven.\"  \"Yes,\nsir.\"  \"Of course you know who made you?\"  The man put his hand to\nhis head and began to scratch his wool; and, after a little\nhesitation, answered, \"De overseer told us last night who made\nus, but indeed I forgot the gentmun's name.\"  This reply was\nalmost too much for Carlton, and his gravity was not a little\nmoved.  However, he bit his tongue, and turned to another man,\nwho appeared, from his looks, to be more intelligent.  \"Do you\nserve the Lord?\" asked he.  \"No, sir, I don't serve anybody but\nMr. Jones.  I neber belong to anybody else.\"  To hide his feelings\nat this juncture, Carlton turned and walked to another part of\nthe grounds, to where the women were seated, and said to a\nmulatto woman who had rather an anxious countenance, \"Did you\never hear of John the Baptist?\"  \"Oh yes, marser, John de Baptist;\nI know dat nigger bery well indeed; he libs in Old Kentuck, where\nI come from.\"  Carlton's gravity here gave way, and he looked at\nthe planter and laughed right out.  The old woman knew a slave\nnear her old master's farm in Kentucky, and was ignorant enough\nto suppose that he was the John the Baptist inquired about.\nCarlton occupied the remainder of the time in reading Scripture\nand talking to them.  \"My niggers ain't shown off very well\nto-day,\" said Jones, as he and his visitor left the grounds.\n\"No,\" replied Carlton.  \"You did not get hold of the bright ones,\"\ncontinued the planter.  \"So it seems,\" remarked Carlton.  The\nplanter evidently felt that his neighbour, Parson Peck, would\nhave a nut to crack over the account that Carlton would give of\nthe ignorance of the slaves, and said and did all in his power to\nremove the bad impression already made; but to no purpose.  The\nreport made by Carlton, on his return, amused the parson very\nmuch.  It appeared to him the best reason why professed Christians\nlike himself should be slave-holders.  Not so with Georgiana.  She\ndid not even smile when Carlton was telling his story, but seemed\nsore at heart that such ignorance should prevail in their midst.\nThe question turned upon the heathen of other lands, and the\nparson began to expatiate upon his own efforts in foreign\nmissions, when his daughter, with a child-like simplicity, said,\n\n\n   \"Send Bibles to the heathen;\n     On every distant shore,\nFrom light that's beaming o'er us,\n   Let streams increasing pour\n  But keep it from the millions\n    Down-trodden at our door.\n\n   \"Send Bibles to the heathen,\n   Their famished spirits feed;\nOh! haste, and join your efforts,\n   The priceless gift to speed;\n  Then flog the trembling Negro\n   If he should learn to read.\"\n\n\"I saw a curiosity while at Mr. Jones's that I shall not forget\nsoon,\" said Carlton.  \"What was it?\" inquired the parson.  \"A\nkennel of bloodhounds; and such dogs I never saw before.  They\nwere of a species between the bloodhound and the foxhound, and\nwere ferocious, gaunt, and savage-looking animals.  They were part\nof a stock imported from Cuba, he informed me.  They were kept in\nan iron cage, and fed on Indian corn bread.  This kind of food, he\nsaid, made them eager for their business.  Sometimes they would\ngive the dogs meat, but it was always after they had been chasing\na Negro.\"  \"Were those the dogs you had, papa, to hunt Harry?\"\nasked Georgiana.  \"No, my dear,\" was the short reply: and the\nparson seemed anxious to change the conversation to something\nelse.  When Mr. Peck had left the room, Carlton spoke more freely\nof what he had seen, and spoke more pointedly against slavery;\nfor he well knew that Miss Peck sympathised with him in all he\nfelt and said.\n\n\"You mentioned about your father hunting a slave,\" said Carlton,\nin an undertone.  \"Yes,\" replied she: \"papa went with some\nslave-catchers and a parcel of those nasty Negro-dogs, to hunt\npoor Harry.  He belonged to papa and lived on the farm.  His wife\nlives in town, and Harry had been to see her, and did not return\nquite as early as he should; and Huckelby was flogging him, and\nhe got away and came here.  I wanted papa to keep him in town, so\nthat he could see his wife more frequently; but he said they\ncould not spare him from the farm, and flogged him again, and\nsent him back.  The poor fellow knew that the overseer would\npunish him over again, and instead of going back he went into the\nwoods.\"  \"Did they catch him?\" asked Carlton.  \"Yes,\" replied she.\n\"In chasing him through the woods, he attempted to escape by\nswimming across a river, and the dogs were sent in after him, and\nsoon caught him.  But Harry had great courage and fought the dogs\nwith a big club; and papa seeing the Negro would escape from the\ndogs, shot at him, as he says, only to wound him, that he might\nbe caught; but the poor fellow was killed.\"  Overcome by relating\nthis incident, Georgiana burst into tears.\n\nAlthough Mr. Peck fed and clothed his house servants well, and\ntreated them with a degree of kindness, he was, nevertheless, a\nmost cruel master.  He encouraged his driver to work the\nfield-hands from early dawn till late at night; and the good\nappearance of the house-servants, and the preaching of Snyder to\nthe field Negroes, was to cause himself to be regarded as a\nChristian master.  Being on a visit one day at the farm, and\nhaving with him several persons from the Free States, and wishing\nto make them believe that his slaves were happy, satisfied, and\ncontented, the parson got out the whiskey and gave each one a\ndram, who in return had to drink the master's health, or give a\ntoast of some kind.  The company were not a little amused at some\nof the sentiments given, and Peck was delighted at every\nindication of contentment on the part of the blacks.  At last it\ncame to Jack's turn to drink, and the master expected something\ngood from him, because he was considered the cleverest and most\nwitty slave on the farm.\n\n\"Now,\" said the master, as he handed Jack the cup of whiskey;\n\"now, Jack, give us something rich.  You know,\" continued he, \"we\nhave raised the finest crop of cotton that's been seen in these\nparts for many a day.  Now give us a toast on cotton; come, Jack,\ngive us something to laugh at.\"  The Negro felt not a little\nelated at being made the hero of the occasion, and taking the\nwhiskey in his right hand, put his left to his head and began to\nscratch his wool, and said,\n\n       \"The big bee flies high,\n    The little bee make the honey;\n  The black folks makes the cotton,\n And the white folks gets the money.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA FREE WOMAN REDUCED TO SLAVERY\n\nALTHESA found in Henry Morton a kind and affectionate husband;\nand his efforts to purchase her mother, although unsuccessful,\nhad doubly endeared him to her.  Having from the commencement\nresolved not to hold slaves, or rather not to own any, they were\ncompelled to hire servants for their own use.  Five years had\npassed away, and their happiness was increased by two lovely\ndaughters.  Mrs. Morton was seated, one bright afternoon, busily\nengaged with her needle, and near her sat Salome, a servant that\nshe had just taken into her employ.  The woman was perfectly\nwhite; so much so, that Mrs. Morton had expressed her\napprehensions to her husband, when the woman first came, that she\nwas not born a slave.  The mistress watched the servant, as the\nlatter sat sewing upon some coarse work, and saw the large silent\ntear in her eye.  This caused an uneasiness to the mistress, and\nshe said, \"Salome, don't you like your situation here?\"  \"Oh yes,\nmadam,\" answered the woman in a quick tone, and then tried to\nforce a smile.  \"Why is it that you often look sad, and with tears\nin your eyes?\"  The mistress saw that she had touched a tender\nchord, and continued, \"I am your friend; tell me your sorrow,\nand, if I can, I will help you.\"  As the last sentence was\nescaping the lips of the mistress, the slave woman put her check\napron to her face and wept.  Mrs. Morton saw plainly that there\nwas cause for this expression of grief, and pressed the woman\nmore closely.  \"Hear me, then,\" said the woman calming herself:\n\"I will tell you why I sometimes weep.  I was born in Germany, on\nthe banks of the Rhine.  Ten years ago my father came to this\ncountry, bringing with him my mother and myself.  He was poor, and\nI, wishing to assist all I could, obtained a situation as nurse\nto a lady in this city.  My father got employment as a labourer on\nthe wharf, among the steamboats; but he was soon taken ill with\nthe yellow fever, and died.  My mother then got a situation for\nherself, while I remained with my first employer.  When the hot\nseason came on, my master, with his wife, left New Orleans until\nthe hot season was over, and took me with them.  They stopped at a\ntown on the banks of the Mississippi river, and said they should\nremain there some weeks.  One day they went out for a ride, and\nthey had not been one more than half an hour, when two men came\ninto the room and told me that they had bought me, and that I was\ntheir slave.  I was bound and taken to prison, and that night put\non a steamboat and taken up the Yazoo river, and set to work on a\nfarm.  I was forced to take up with a Negro, and by him had three\nchildren.  A year since my master's daughter was married, and I\nwas given to her.  She came with her husband to this city, and I\nhave ever since been hired out.\"\n\n\"Unhappy woman,\" whispered Althesa, \"why did you not tell me this\nbefore?\"  \"I was afraid,\" replied Salome, \"for I was once severely\nflogged for telling a stranger that I was not born a slave.\"  On\nMr. Morton's return home, his wife communicated to him the story\nwhich the slave woman had told her an hour before, and begged\nthat something might be done to rescue her from the situation she\nwas then in.  In Louisiana as well as many others of the slave\nstates, great obstacles are thrown in the way of persons who have\nbeen wrongfully reduced to slavery regaining their freedom.  A\nperson claiming to be free must prove his right to his liberty.\nThis, it will be seen, throws the burden of proof upon the slave,\nwho, in all probability, finds it out of his power to procure\nsuch evidence.  And if any free person shall attempt to aid a\nfreeman in re-gaining his freedom, he is compelled to enter into\nsecurity in the sum of one thousand dollars, and if the person\nclaiming to be free shall fail to establish such fact, the\nthousand dollars are forfeited to the state.  This cruel and\noppressive law has kept many a freeman from espousing the cause\nof persons unjustly held as slaves.  Mr. Morton inquired and found\nthat the woman's story was true, as regarded the time she had\nlived with her present owner; but the latter not only denied that\nshe was free, but immediately removed her from Morton's.  Three\nmonths after Salome had been removed from Morton's and let out to\nanother family, she was one morning cleaning the door steps, when\na lady passing by, looked at the slave and thought she recognised\nsome one that she had seen before.  The lady stopped and asked the\nwoman if she was a slave.  \"I am,\" said she.  \"Were you born a\nslave?\"  \"No, I was born in Germany.\"  \"What's the name of the ship\nin which you came to this country?\"  inquired the lady.  \"I don't\nknow,\" was the answer.  \"Was it the Amazon?\"  At the sound of\nthis name, the slave woman was silent for a moment, and then the\ntears began to flow freely down her careworn cheeks.  \"Would you\nknow Mrs. Marshall, who was a passenger in the Amazon, if you\nshould see her?\" inquired the lady.  At this the woman gazed at\nthe lady with a degree of intensity that can be imagined better\nthan described, and then fell at the lady's feet.  The lady was\nMrs. Marshall.  She had crossed the Atlantic in the same ship with\nthis poor woman.  Salome, like many of her countrymen, was a\nbeautiful singer, and had often entertained Mrs. Marshall and the\nother lady passengers on board the Amazon.  The poor woman was\nraised from the ground by Mrs. Marshall, and placed upon the door\nstep that she had a moment before been cleaning.  \"I will do my\nutmost to rescue you from the horrid life of a slave,\" exclaimed\nthe lady, as she took from her pocket her pencil, and wrote down\nthe number of the house, and the street in which the German woman\nwas working as a slave.\n\nAfter a long and tedious trial of many days, it was decided that\nSalome Miller was by birth a free woman, and she was set at\nliberty.  The good and generous Althesa had contributed some of\nthe money toward bringing about the trial, and had done much to\ncheer on Mrs. Marshall in her benevolent object.  Salome Miller\nis free, but where are her three children?  They are still slaves,\nand in all human probability will die as such.\n\nThis, reader, is no fiction; if you think so, look over the files\nof the New Orleans newspapers of the years 1845-6, and you will\nthere see reports of the trial.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTO-DAY A MISTRESS, TO-MORROW A SLAVE\n\n    \"I promised thee a sister tale\n     Of man's perfidious cruelty;\nCome, then, and hear what cruel wrong\n  Befell the dark ladie.\"--Coleridge.\n\nLET us return for a moment to the home of Clotel.  While she was\npassing lonely and dreary hours with none but her darling child,\nHoratio Green was trying to find relief in that insidious enemy\nof man, the intoxicating cup.  Defeated in politics, forsaken in\nlove by his wife, he seemed to have lost all principle of honour,\nand was ready to nerve himself up to any deed, no matter how\nunprincipled.  Clotel's existence was now well known to Horatio's\nwife, and both her [sic] and her father demanded that the\nbeautiful quadroon and her child should be sold and sent out of\nthe state.  To this proposition he at first turned a deaf ear; but\nwhen he saw that his wife was about to return to her father's\nroof, he consented to leave the matter in the hands of his\nfather-in-law.  The result was, that Clotel was immediately sold\nto the slave-trader, Walker, who, a few years previous, had taken\nher mother and sister to the far South.  But, as if to make her\nhusband drink of the cup of humiliation to its very dregs, Mrs.\nGreen resolved to take his child under her own roof for a\nservant.  Mary was, therefore, put to the meanest work that could\nbe found, and although only ten years of age, she was often\ncompelled to perform labour, which, under ordinary circumstances,\nwould have been thought too hard for one much older.  One\ncondition of the sale of Clotel to Walker was, that she should be\ntaken out of the state, which was accordingly done.  Most\nquadroon women who are taken to the lower countries to be sold\nare either purchased by gentlemen for their own use, or sold for\nwaiting-maids; and Clotel, like her sister, was fortunate enough\nto be bought for the latter purpose.  The town of Vicksburgh\nstands on the left bank of the Mississippi, and is noted for the\nseverity with which slaves are treated.  It was here that Clotel\nwas sold to Mr. James French, a merchant.\n\nMrs. French was severe in the extreme to her servants.  Well\ndressed, but scantily fed, and overworked were all who found a\nhome with her.  The quadroon had been in her new home but a short\ntime ere she found that her situation was far different from what\nit was in Virginia.  What social virtues are possible in a\nsociety of which injustice is the primary characteristic? in a\nsociety which is divided into two classes, masters and slaves?\nEvery married woman in the far South looks upon her husband as\nunfaithful, and regards every quadroon servant as a rival.  Clotel\nhad been with her new mistress but a few days, when she was\nordered to cut off her long hair.  The Negro, constitutionally, is\nfond of dress and outward appearance.  He that has short, woolly\nhair, combs it and oils it to death.  He that has long hair, would\nsooner have his teeth drawn than lose it.  However painful it was\nto the quadroon, she was soon seen with her hair cut as short as\nany of the full-blooded Negroes in the dwelling.\n\nEven with her short hair, Clotel was handsome.  Her life had been\na secluded one, and though now nearly thirty years of age, she\nwas still beautiful.  At her short hair, the other servants\nlaughed, \"Miss Clo needn't strut round so big, she got short\nnappy har well as I,\" said Nell, with a broad grin that showed\nher teeth.  \"She tinks she white, when she come here wid dat long\nhar of hers,\" replied Mill.  \"Yes,\" continued Nell; \"missus make\nher take down her wool so she no put it up to-day.\"\n\nThe fairness of Clotel's complexion was regarded with envy as well\nby the other servants as by the mistress herself.  This is one of\nthe hard features of slavery.  To-day the woman is mistress of her\nown cottage; to-morrow she is sold to one who aims to make her\nlife as intolerable as possible.  And be it remembered, that the\nhouse servant has the best situation which a slave can occupy.\nSome American writers have tried to make the world believe that\nthe condition of the labouring classes of England is as bad as\nthe slaves of the United States.\n\nThe English labourer may be oppressed, he may be cheated,\ndefrauded, swindled, and even starved; but it is not slavery\nunder which he groans.  He cannot be sold; in point of law he is\nequal to the prime minister.  \"It is easy to captivate the\nunthinking and the prejudiced, by eloquent declamation about the\noppression of English operatives being worse than that of\nAmerican slaves, and by exaggerating the wrongs on one side and\nhiding them on the other.  But all informed and reflecting minds,\nknowing that bad as are the social evils of England, those of\nSlavery are immeasurably worse.\"  But the degradation and harsh\ntreatment that Clotel experienced in her new home was nothing\ncompared with the grief she underwent at being separated from her\ndear child.  Taken from her without scarcely a moment's warning,\nshe knew not what had become of her.  The deep and heartfelt\ngrief of Clotel was soon perceived by her owners, and fearing\nthat her refusal to take food would cause her death, they\nresolved to sell her.  Mr. French found no difficulty in getting a\npurchaser for the quadroon woman, for such are usually the most\nmarketable kind of property.  Clotel was sold at private sale to a\nyoung man for a housekeeper; but even he had missed his aim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nDEATH OF THE PARSON\n\nCARLTON was above thirty years of age, standing on the last legs\nof a young man, and entering on the first of a bachelor.  He had\nnever dabbled in matters of love, and looked upon all women\nalike.  Although he respected woman for her virtues, and often\nspoke of the goodness of heart of the sex, he had never dreamed\nof marriage.  At first he looked upon Miss Peck as a pretty young\nwoman, but after she became his religious teacher, he regarded\nher in that light, that every one will those whom they know to be\ntheir superiors.  It was soon seen, however, that the young man not\nonly respected and reverenced Georgiana for the incalculable\nservice she had done him, in awakening him to a sense of duty to\nhis soul, but he had learned to bow to the shrine of Cupid.  He\nfound, weeks after he had been in her company, that when he met\nher at table, or alone in the drawing room, or on the piazza, he\nfelt a shortness of breath, a palpitating of the heart, a kind of\ndizziness of the head; but he knew not its cause.\n\nThis was love in its first stage.  Mr. Peck saw, or thought he\nsaw, what would be the result of Carlton's visit, and held out\nevery inducement in his power to prolong his stay.  The hot season\nwas just commencing, and the young Northerner was talking of his\nreturn home, when the parson was very suddenly taken ill.  The\ndisease was the cholera, and the physicians pronounced the case\nincurable.  In less than five hours John Peck was a corpse.  His\nlove for Georgiana, and respect for her father, had induced\nCarlton to remain by the bedside of the dying man, although\nagainst the express orders of the physician.  This act of kindness\ncaused the young orphan henceforth to regard Carlton as her best\nfriend.  He now felt it his duty to remain with the young woman\nuntil some of her relations should be summoned from Connecticut.\nAfter the funeral, the family physician advised that Miss Peck\nshould go to the farm, and spend the time at the country seat;\nand also advised Carlton to remain with her, which he did.\n\nAt the parson's death his Negroes showed little or no signs of\ngrief.  This was noticed by both Carlton and Miss Peck, and caused\nno little pain to the latter.  \"They are ungrateful,\" said\nCarlton, as he and Georgiana were seated on the piazza.  \"What,\"\nasked she, \"have they to be grateful for?\"  \"Your father was kind,\nwas he not?\"  \"Yes, as kind as most men who own slaves; but the\nkindness meted out to blacks would be unkindness if given to\nwhites.  We would think so, should we not?\"  \"Yes,\" replied he.\n\"If we would not consider the best treatment which a slave receives\ngood enough for us, we should not think he ought to be grateful\nfor it.  Everybody knows that slavery in its best and mildest form\nis wrong.  Whoever denies this, his lips libel his heart.  Try him!\nClank the chains in his ears, and tell him they are for him; give\nhim an hour to prepare his wife and children for a life of\nslavery; bid him make haste, and get ready their necks for the\nyoke, and their wrists for the coffle chains; then look at his\npale lips and trembling knees, and you have nature's testimony\nagainst slavery.\"\n\n\"Let's take a walk,\" said Carlton, as if to turn the\nconversation.  The moon was just appearing through the tops of\nthe trees, and the animals and insects in an adjoining wood kept\nup a continued din of music.  The croaking of bull-frogs, buzzing\nof insects, cooing of turtle-doves, and the sound from a thousand\nmusical instruments, pitched on as many different keys, made the\nwelkin ring.  But even all this noise did not drown the singing of\na party of the slaves, who were seated near a spring that was\nsending up its cooling waters.  \"How prettily the Negroes sing,\"\nremarked Carlton, as they were wending their way towards the\nplace from whence the sound of the voices came.  \"Yes,\" replied\nGeorgiana; \"master Sam is there, I'll warrant you: he's always on\nhand when there's any singing or dancing.  We must not let them\nsee us, or they will stop singing.\"  \"Who makes their songs for\nthem?\" inquired the young man.  \"Oh, they make them up as they\nsing them; they are all impromptu songs.\"  By this time they were\nnear enough to hear distinctly every word; and, true enough,\nSam's voice was heard above all others.  At the conclusion of each\nsong they all joined in a hearty laugh, with an expression of\n\"Dats de song for me;\"  \"Dems dems.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said Carlton, as Georgiana was rising from the log upon\nwhich she was seated; \"stop, and let's hear this one.\"  The piece\nwas sung by Sam, the others joining in the chorus, and was as\nfollows:\n\n                       Sam.\n\n   \"Come, all my brethren, let us take a rest,\n   While the moon shines so brightly and clear;\n     Old master is dead, and left us at last,\n        And has gone at the Bar to appear.\n   Old master has died, and lying in his grave,\n     And our blood will awhile cease to flow;\nHe will no more trample on the neck of the slave;\n     For he's gone where the slaveholders go.\n\n                     Chorus.\n\n         \"Hang up the shovel and the hoe\n        Take down the fiddle and the bow--\n  Old master has gone to the slaveholder's rest;\n     He has gone where they all ought to go.\n\n                       Sam.\n\n   \"I heard the old doctor say the other night,\n       As he passed by the dining-room door\n 'Perhaps the old man may live through the night,\n       But I think he will die about four.'\n Young mistress sent me, at the peril of my life,\n      For the parson to come down and pray,\nFor says she, 'Your old master is now about to die,'\n     And says I, 'God speed him on his way.'\n\n             \"Hang up the shovel, &c.\n\n  \"At four o'clock at morn the family was called\n         Around the old man's dying bed;\n   And oh! but I laughed to myself when I heard\n       That the old man's spirit had fled.\n     Mr. Carlton cried, and so did I pretend;\n       Young mistress very nearly went mad;\nAnd the old parson's groans did the heavens fairly rend;\n        But I tell you I felt mighty glad.\n\n             \"Hang up the shovel, &c.\n\n \"We'll no more be roused by the blowing of his horn,\n        Our backs no longer he will score;\nHe no more will feed us on cotton-seeds and corn;\n     For his reign of oppression now is o'er.\n  He no more will hang our children on the tree,\n  To be ate by the carrion crow;\n   He no more will send our wives to Tennessee;\n     For he's gone where the slaveholders go.\n\n         \"Hang up the shovel and the hoe,\n\n        Take down the fiddle and the bow,\n              We'll dance and sing,\n            And make the forest ring,\n       With the fiddle and the old banjo.\"\n\nThe song was not half finished before Carlton regretted that he\nhad caused the young lady to remain and hear what to her must be\nanything but pleasant reflections upon her deceased parent.  \"I\nthink we will walk,\" said he, at the same time extending his arm\nto Georgiana.  \"No,\" said she; \"let's hear them out.  It is from\nthese unguarded expressions of the feelings of the Negroes, that\nwe should learn a lesson.\"  At its conclusion they walked towards\nthe house in silence: as they were ascending the steps, the young\nman said, \"They are happy, after all.  The Negro, situated as yours\nare, is not aware that he is deprived of any just rights.\"  \"Yes,\nyes,\" answered Georgiana: \"you may place the slave where you\nplease; you may dry up to your utmost the fountains of his\nfeelings, the springs of his thought; you may yoke him to your\nlabour, as an ox which liveth only to work, and worketh only to\nlive; you may put him under any process which, without destroying\nhis value as a slave, will debase and crush him as a rational\nbeing; you may do this, and the idea that he was born to be free\nwill survive it all.  It is allied to his hope of immortality; it\nis the ethereal part of his nature, which oppression cannot\nreach; it is a torch lit up in his soul by the hand of Deity, and\nnever meant to be extinguished by the hand of man.\"\n\nOn reaching the drawing-room, they found Sam snuffing the\ncandles, and looking as solemn and as dignified as if he had\nnever sung a song or laughed in his life.  \"Will Miss Georgy have\nde supper got up now?\" asked the Negro.  \"Yes,\" she replied.\n\"Well,\" remarked Carlton, \"that beats anything I ever met with.\nDo you think that was Sam we heard singing?\" \"I am sure of it,\"\nwas the answer. \"I could not have believed that that fellow was\ncapable of so much deception,\" continued he.  \"Our system of\nslavery is one of deception; and Sam, you see, has only been a\ngood scholar.  However, he is as honest a fellow as you will find\namong the slave population here.  If we would have them more\nhonest, we should give them their liberty, and then the\ninducement to be dishonest would be gone.  I have resolved that\nthese creatures shall all be free.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Carlton.\n\"Yes, I shall let them all go free, and set an example to those\nabout me.\"  \"I honour your judgment,\" said he.  \"But will the state\npermit them to remain?\"  \"If not, they can go where they can live\nin freedom.  I will not be unjust because the state is.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nRETALIATION\n\n    \"I had a dream, a happy dream;\n    I thought that I was free:\n That in my own bright land again\n    A home there was for me.\"\n\nWITH the deepest humiliation Horatio Green saw the daughter of\nClotel, his own child, brought into his dwelling as a servant.\nHis wife felt that she had been deceived, and determined to\npunish her deceiver.  At first Mary was put to work in the kitchen,\nwhere she met with little or no sympathy from the other slaves,\nowing to the fairness of her complexion.  The child was white,\nwhat should be done to make her look like other Negroes, was the\nquestion Mrs. Green asked herself.  At last she hit upon a plan:\nthere was a garden at the back of the house over which Mrs. Green\ncould look from her parlour window.  Here the white slave-girl was\nput to work, without either bonnet or handkerchief upon her head.\nA hot sun poured its broiling rays on the naked face and neck of\nthe girl, until she sank down in the corner of the garden, and\nwas actually broiled to sleep.  \"Dat little nigger ain't working a\nbit, missus,\" said Dinah to Mrs. Green, as she entered the\nkitchen.\n\n\"She's lying in the sun, seasoning; she will work better by and\nby,\" replied the mistress.  \"Dees white niggers always tink dey\nsef good as white folks,\" continued the cook.  \"Yes, but we will\nteach them better; won't we, Dinah?\"  \"Yes, missus, I don't like\ndees mularter niggers, no how: dey always want to set dey sef up\nfor something big.\"  The cook was black, and was not without that\nprejudice which is to be found among the Negroes, as well as\namong the whites of the Southern States.  The sun had the desired\neffect, for in less than a fortnight Mary's fair complexion had\ndisappeared, and she was but little whiter than any other mulatto\nchildren running about the yard.  But the close resemblance\nbetween the father and child annoyed the mistress more than the\nmere whiteness of the child's complexion.  Horatio made\nproposition after proposition to have the girl sent away, for\nevery time he beheld her countenance it reminded him of the happy\ndays he had spent with Clotel.  But his wife had commenced, and\ndetermined to carry out her unfeeling and fiendish designs.  This\nchild was not only white, but she was the granddaughter of Thomas\nJefferson, the man who, when speaking against slavery in the\nlegislature of Virginia, said,\n\n\"The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual\nexercise of the most boisterous passions; the most unremitting\ndespotism on the one part, and degrading submission on the other.\nWith what execration should the statesman be loaded who,\npermitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of\nthe other, transforms those into despots and these into enemies,\ndestroys the morals of the one part, and the amor patriae of the\nother!  For if the slave can have a country in this world, it must\nbe any other in preference to that in which he is born to live\nand labour for another; in which he must lock up the faculties of\nhis nature, contribute as far as depends on his individual\nendeavours to the evanishment of the human race, or entail his\nown miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding\nfrom him.  And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure\nwhen we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the\nminds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God?\nthat they are not to be violated but with his wrath?  Indeed, I\ntremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his\njustice cannot sleep for ever; that, considering numbers, nature,\nand natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an\nexchange of situation, is among possible events; that it may\nbecome probable by supernatural interference!  The Almighty has no\nattribute which can take side with us in such a contest.\n\n\"What an incomprehensible machine is man!  Who can endure toil,\nfamine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself, in vindication\nof his own liberty, and the next moment be deaf to all those\nmotives, whose power supported him through his trial, and inflict\non his fellow-men a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with\nmore misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to\noppose!  But we must wait with patience the workings of an\noverruling Providence, and hope that that is preparing the\ndeliverance of these our suffering brethren.  When the measure of\ntheir tears shall be full--when their tears shall have involved\nheaven itself in darkness--doubtless a God of justice will awaken\nto their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality among\ntheir oppressors, or at length by his exterminating thunder,\nmanifest his attention to things of this world, and that they are\nnot left to the guidance of blind fatality.\"\n\nThe same man, speaking of the probability that the slaves might\nsome day attempt to gain their liberties by a revolution, said,\n\n\"I tremble for my country, when I recollect that God is just, and\nthat His justice cannot sleep for ever.  The Almighty has no\nattribute that can take sides with us in such a struggle.\"\n\nBut, sad to say, Jefferson is not the only American statesman who\nhas spoken high-sounding words in favour of freedom, and then\nleft his own children to die slaves.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE LIBERATOR\n\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nfree and equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\ncertain inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty, and\nthe pursuit of happiness.\"--Declaration of American Independence.\n\nTHE death of the parson was the commencement of a new era in the\nhistory of his slaves.  Only a little more than eighteen years of\nage, Georgiana could not expect to carry out her own wishes in\nregard to the slaves, although she was sole heir to her father's\nestate.  There were distant relations whose opinions she had at\nleast to respect.  And both law and public opinion in the state\nwere against any measure of emancipation that she might think of\nadopting; unless, perhaps, she might be permitted to send them to\nLiberia.  Her uncle in Connecticut had already been written to, to\ncome down and aid in settling up the estate.  He was a Northern\nman, but she knew him to be a tight-fisted yankee, whose whole\ncounsel would go against liberating the Negroes.  Yet there was\none way in which the thing could be done.  She loved Carlton, and\nshe well knew that he loved her; she read it in his countenance\nevery time they met, yet the young man did not mention his wishes\nto her.  There were many reasons why he should not.  In the first\nplace, her father was just deceased, and it seemed only right\nthat he should wait a reasonable time.  Again, Carlton was poor,\nand Georgiana was possessed of a large fortune; and his high\nspirit would not, for a moment, allow him to place himself in a\nposition to be regarded as a fortune-hunter.  The young girl\nhinted, as best she could, at the probable future; but all to no\npurpose.  He took nothing to himself.  True, she had read much of\n\"woman's rights;\" and had even attended a meeting, while at the\nNorth, which had been called to discuss the wrongs of woman; but\nshe could not nerve herself up to the point of putting the\nquestion to Carlton, although she felt sure that she should not\nbe rejected.  She waited, but in vain.  At last, one evening, she\ncame out of her room rather late, and was walking on the piazza\nfor fresh air.  She passed near Carlton's room, and heard the\nvoice of Sam.  The negro had just come in to get the young man's\nboots, and had stopped, as he usually did, to have some talk.  \"I\nwish,\" said Sam, \"dat Marser Carlton an Miss Georgy would get\nmarried; den, speck, we'd have good times.\"  \"I don't think your\nmistress would have me,\" replied the young man.  \"What make tink\ndat, Marser Carlton?\"  \"Your mistress would marry no one, Sam,\nunless she loved them.\"  \"Den I wish she would lub you, cause I tink\nwe have good times den.  All our folks is de same 'pinion like\nme,\" returned the Negro, and then left the room with the boots in\nhis hands.  During the conversation between the Anglo-Saxon and\nthe African, one word had been dropped by the former that haunted\nthe young lady the remainder of the night--\"Your mistress would\nmarry no one unless she loved them.\"  That word awoke her in the\nmorning, and caused her to decide upon this import subject.  Love\nand duty triumphed over the woman's timid nature, and that day\nGeorgiana informed Carlton that she was ready to become his wife.\nThe young man, with grateful tears, accepted and\nkissed the hand that was offered to him.  The marriage of Carlton\nand Miss Peck was hailed with delight by both the servants in the\nhouse and the Negroes on the farm.  New rules were immediately\nannounced for the working and general treatment of the slaves on\nthe plantation.  With this, Huckelby, the overseer, saw his reign\ncoming to an end; and Snyder, the Dutch preacher, felt that his\nservices would soon be dispensed with, for nothing was more\nrepugnant to the feelings of Mrs. Carlton than the sermons\npreached by Snyder to the slaves.  She regarded them as something\nintended to make them better satisfied with their condition, and\nmore valuable as pieces of property, without preparing them for\nthe world to come.  Mrs. Carlton found in her husband a congenial\nspirit, who entered into all her wishes and plans for bettering\nthe condition of their slaves.  Mrs. Carlton's views and\nsympathies were all in favour of immediate emancipation; but then\nshe saw, or thought she saw, a difficulty in that.  If the slaves\nwere liberated, they must be sent out of the state.  This, of\ncourse, would incur additional expense; and if they left the\nstate, where had they better go?  \"Let's send them to Liberia,\"\nsaid Carlton.  \"Why should they go to Africa, any more than to the\nFree States or to Canada?\" asked the wife.  \"They would be in\ntheir native land,\" he answered.  \"Is not this their native land?\nWhat right have we, more than the Negro, to the soil here, or to\nstyle ourselves native Americans?  Indeed it is as much their home\nas ours, and I have sometimes thought it was more theirs.  The\nNegro has cleared up the lands, built towns, and enriched the\nsoil with his blood and tears; and in return, he is to be sent to\na country of which he knows nothing.  Who fought more bravely for\nAmerican independence than the blacks? A negro, by the\nname of Attucks, was the first that fell in Boston at the\ncommencement of the revolutionary war; and throughout the whole\nof the struggles for liberty in this country, the Negroes have\ncontributed their share.  In the last war with Great Britain, the\ncountry was mainly indebted to the blacks in New Orleans for the\nachievement of the victory at that place; and even General\nJackson, the commander in chief, called the Negroes together at\nthe close of the war, and addressed them in the following\nterms:--\n\n'Soldiers!--When on the banks of the Mobile I called you to take up\narms, inviting you to partake the perils and glory of your white\nfellow citizens, I expected much from you; for I was not ignorant\nthat you possess qualities most formidable to an invading enemy.  I\nknew with what fortitude you could endure hunger and thirst, and\nall the fatigues of a campaign.  I knew well how you loved your\nnative country, and that you, as well as ourselves, had to defend\nwhat man holds most dear--his parents, wife, children, and\nproperty.  You have done more than I expected.  In addition to the\nprevious qualities I before knew you to possess, I found among\nyou a noble enthusiasm, which leads to the performance of great\nthings.\n\n'Soldiers!  The President of the United States shall hear how\npraiseworthy was your conduct in the hour of danger, and the\nrepresentatives of the American people will give you the praise\nyour exploits entitle you to.  Your general anticipates them in\nappauding your noble ardour.'\n\n\"And what did these noble men receive in return for their\ncourage, their heroism?  Chains and slavery.  Their good deeds have\nbeen consecrated only in their own memories.  Who rallied with\nmore alacrity in response to the summons of danger?  If in that\nhazardous hour, when our homes were menaced with the horrors of\nwar, we did not disdain to call upon the Negro to assist in\nrepelling invasion, why should we, now that the danger is past,\ndeny him a home in his native land?\"  \"I see,\" said Carlton, \"you\nare right, but I fear you will have difficulty in persuading\nothers to adopt your views.\"  \"We will set the example,\" replied\nshe, \"and then hope for the best; for I feel that the people of\nthe Southern States will one day see their error.  Liberty has\nalways been our watchword, as far as profession is concerned.\nNothing has been held so cheap as our common humanity, on a\nnational average.  If every man had his aliquot proportion of the\ninjustice done in this land, by law and violence, the present\nfreemen of the northern section would many of them commit suicide\nin self-defence, and would court the liberties awarded by Ali\nPasha of Egypt to his subjects.  Long ere this we should have\ntested, in behalf of our bleeding and crushed American brothers\nof every hue and complexion, every new constitution, custom, or\npractice, by which inhumanity was supposed to be upheld, the\ninjustice and cruelty they contained, emblazoned before the great\ntribunal of mankind for condemnation; and the good and available\npower they possessed, for the relief, deliverance and elevation\nof oppressed men, permitted to shine forth from under the cloud,\nfor the refreshment of the human race.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. and Mrs. Carlton felt that immediate emancipation\nwas the right of the slave and the duty of the master, they\nresolved on a system of gradual emancipation, so as to give them\ntime to accomplish their wish, and to prepare the Negro for\nfreedom.  Huckelby was one morning told that his services would\nno longer be required.  The Negroes, ninety-eight in number, were\ncalled together and told that the whip would no longer be used,\nand that they would be allowed a certain sum for every bale of\ncotton produced.  Sam, whose long experience in the cotton-field\nbefore he had been taken into the house, and whose general\nintelligence justly gave him the first place amongst the Negroes\non the Poplar Farm, was placed at their head.  They were also\ngiven to understand that the money earned by them would be placed\nto their credit; and when it amounted to a certain sum, they\nshould all be free.\n\nThe joy with which this news was received by the slaves, showed\ntheir grateful appreciation of the boon their benefactors were\nbestowing upon them.  The house servants were called and told that\nwages would be allowed them, and what they earned set to their\ncredit, and they too should be free.  The next were the\nbricklayers.  There were eight of these, who had paid their master\ntwo dollars per day, and boarded and clothed themselves.  An\narrangement was entered into with them, by which the money they\nearned should be placed to their credit; and they too should be\nfree, when a certain amount should be accumulated; and great was\nthe change amongst all these people.  The bricklayers had been to\nwork but a short time, before their increased industry was\nnoticed by many.  They were no longer apparently the same people.\nA sedateness, a care, an economy, an industry, took possession of\nthem, to which there seemed to be no bounds but in their physical\nstrength.  They were never tired of labouring, and seemed as\nthough they could never effect enough.  They became temperate,\nmoral, religious, setting an example of innocent, unoffending\nlives to the world around them, which was seen and admired by\nall.  Mr. Parker, a man who worked nearly forty slaves at the same\nbusiness, was attracted by the manner in which these Negroes\nlaboured.  He called on Mr. Carlton, some weeks after they had\nbeen acting on the new system, and offered 2,000 dollars for the\nhead workman, Jim.  The offer was, of course, refused.  A few days\nafter the same gentleman called again, and made an offer of\ndouble the sum that he had on the former occasion.  Mr. Parker,\nfinding that no money would purchase either of the Negroes, said,\n\"Now, Mr. Carlton, pray tell me what it is that makes your\nNegroes work so?  What kind of people are they?\"  \"I suppose,\"\nobserved Carlton, \"that they are like other people, flesh and\nblood.\"  \"Why, sir,\" continued Parker, \"I have never seen such\npeople; building as they are next door to my residence, I see and\nhave my eye on them from morning till night.  You are never there,\nfor I have never met you, or seen you once at the building.  Why,\nsir, I am an early riser, getting up before day; and do you think\nthat I am not awoke every morning in my life by the noise of\ntheir trowels at work, and their singing and noise before day;\nand do you suppose, sir, that they stop or leave off work at\nsundown?  No, sir, but they work as long as they can see to lay a\nbrick, and then they carry tip brick and mortar for an hour or\ntwo afterward, to be ahead of their work the next morning.  And\nagain, sir, do you think that they walk at their work?  No, sir,\nthey run all day.  You see, sir, those immensely long, ladders,\nfive stories in height; do you suppose they walk up them?  No,\nsir, they run up and down them like so many monkeys all day long.\nI never saw such people as these in my life.  I don't know what to\nmake of them.  Were a white man with them and over them with a\nwhip, then I should see and understand the cause of the running\nand incessant labour; but I cannot comprehend it; there is\nsomething in it, sir.  Great man, sir, that Jim; great man; I\nshould like to own him.\"  Carlton here informed Parker that their\nliberties depended upon their work; when the latter replied, \"If\nniggers can work so for the promise of freedom, they ought to be\nmade to work without it.\"  This last remark was in the true spirit\nof the slaveholder, and reminds us of the fact that, some years\nsince, the overseer of General Wade Hampton offered the\nniggers under him a suit of clothes to the one that picked the\nmost cotton in one day; and after that time that day's work was\ngiven as a task to the slaves on that plantation; and, after a\nwhile, was adopted by other planters.\n\nThe Negroes on the farm, under \"Marser Sam,\" were also working in\na manner that attracted the attention of the planters round\nabout.  They no longer feared Huckelby's whip, and no longer slept\nunder the preaching of Snyder.  On the Sabbath, Mr. and Mrs.\nCarlton read and explained the Scriptures to them; and the very\ngreat attention paid by the slaves showed plainly that they\nappreciated the gospel when given to them in its purity.  The death\nof Currer, from yellow fever, was a great trial to Mrs. Carlton;\nfor she had not only become much attached to her, but had heard\nwith painful interest the story of her wrongs, and would, in all\nprobability, have restored her to her daughter in New Orleans.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nESCAPE OF CLOTEL\n\n  \"The fetters galled my weary soul--\n A soul that seemed but thrown away;\n I spurned the tyrant's base control,\n Resolved at least the man to play.\"\n\nNo country has produced so much heroism in so short a time,\nconnected with escapes from peril and oppression, as has occurred\nin the United States among fugitive slaves, many of whom show\ngreat shrewdness in their endeavours to escape from this land of\nbondage.  A slave was one day seen passing on the high road from a\nborder town in the interior of the state of Virginia to the Ohio\nriver.  The man had neither hat upon his head or coat upon his\nback.  He was driving before him a very nice fat pig, and appeared\nto all who saw him to be a labourer employed on an adjoining\nfarm.  \"No Negro is permitted to go at large in the Slave States\nwithout a written pass from his or her master, except on business\nin the neighbourhood.\"  \"Where do you live, my boy?\" asked a white\nman of the slave, as he passed a white house with green blinds.\n\"Jist up de road, sir,\" was the answer.  \"That's a fine pig.\"\n\"Yes, sir, marser like dis choat berry much.\"  And the Negro drove\non as if he was in great haste.  In this way he and the pig\ntravelled more than fifty miles before they reached the Ohio\nriver.  Once at the river they crossed over; the pig was sold; and\nnine days after the runaway slave passed over the Niagara river,\nand, for the first time in his life, breathed the air of freedom.\nA few weeks later, and, on the same road, two slaves were seen\npassing; one was on horseback, the other was walking before him\nwith his arms tightly bound, and a long rope leading from the man\non foot to the one on horseback.  \"Oh, ho, that's a runaway\nrascal, I suppose,\" said a farmer, who met them on the road.\n\"Yes, sir, he bin runaway, and I got him fast.  Marser will tan\nhis jacket for him nicely when he gets him.\"  \"You are a\ntrustworthy fellow, I imagine,\" continued the farmer.  \"Oh yes,\nsir; marser puts a heap of confidence in dis nigger.\"  And the\nslaves travelled on.  When the one on foot was fatigued they would\nchange positions, the other being tied and driven on foot.  This\nthey called \"ride and tie.\"  After a journey of more than two\nhundred miles they reached the Ohio river, turned the horse\nloose, told him to go home, and proceeded on their way to Canada.\nHowever they were not to have it all their own way.  There are men\nin the Free States, and especially in the states adjacent to the\nSlave States, who make their living by catching the runaway\nslave, and returning him for the reward that may be offered.  As\nthe two slaves above mentioned were travelling on towards the\nland of freedom, led by the North Star, they were set upon by\nfour of these slave-catchers, and one of them unfortunately\ncaptured.  The other escaped.  The captured fugitive was put under\nthe torture, and compelled to reveal the name of his owner and\nhis place of residence.  Filled with delight, the kidnappers\nstarted back with their victim.  Overjoyed with the prospect of\nreceiving a large reward, they gave themselves up on the third\nnight to pleasure.  They put up at an inn.  The Negro was chained\nto the bed-post, in the same room with his captors.  At dead of\nnight, when all was still, the slave arose from the floor upon\nwhich he had been lying, looked around, and saw that\nthe white men were fast asleep.  The brandy punch had done its\nwork.  With palpitating heart and trembling limbs he viewed his\nposition.  The door was fast, but the warm weather had compelled\nthem to leave the window open.  If he could but get his chains\noff, he might escape through the window to the piazza, and reach\nthe ground by one of the posts that supported the piazza.  The\nsleeper's clothes hung upon chairs by the bedside; the slave\nthought of the padlock key, examined the pockets and found it.\nThe chains were soon off, and the Negro stealthily making his way\nto the window: he stopped and said to himself, \"These men are\nvillains, they are enemies to all who like me are trying to be\nfree.  Then why not I teach them a lesson?\"  He then undressed\nhimself, took the clothes of one of the men, dressed himself in\nthem, and escaped through the window, and, a moment more, he was\non the high road to Canada.  Fifteen days later, and the writer of\nthis gave him a passage across Lake Erie, and saw him safe in her\nBritannic Majesty's dominions.\n\nWe have seen Clotel sold to Mr. French in Vicksburgh, her hair\ncut short, and everything done to make her realise her position\nas a servant.  Then we have seen her re-sold, because her owners\nfeared she would die through grief.  As yet her new purchaser\ntreated her with respectful gentleness, and sought to win her\nfavour by flattery and presents, knowing that whatever he gave\nher he could take back again.  But she dreaded every moment lest\nthe scene should change, and trembled at the sound of every\nfootfall.  At every interview with her new master Clotel stoutly\nmaintained that she had left a husband in Virginia, and would\nnever think of taking another.  The gold watch and chain, and\nother glittering presents which he purchased for her, were all\nlaid aside by the quadroon, as if they were of no value to her.\nIn the same house with her was another servant, a man, who had\nfrom time to time hired himself from his master.  William was his\nname.  He could feel for Clotel, for he, like her, had been\nseparated from near and dear relatives, and often tried to\nconsole the poor woman. One day the quadroon observed to him that\nher hair was growing out again.  \"Yes,\" replied William, \"you look\na good deal like a man with your short hair.\"  \"Oh,\" rejoined she,\n\"I have often been told that I would make a better looking man\nthan a woman.  If I had the money,\" continued she, \"I would bid\nfarewell to this place.\"  In a moment more she feared that she had\nsaid too much, and smilingly remarked, \"I am always talking\nnonsense.\"  William was a tall, full-bodied Negro, whose very\ncountenance beamed with intelligence.  Being a mechanic, he had,\nby his own industry, made more than what he paid his owner; this\nhe laid aside, with the hope that some day he might get enough to\npurchase his freedom.  He had in his chest one hundred and fifty\ndollars.  His was a heart that felt for others, and he had again\nand again wiped the tears from his eyes as he heard the story of\nClotel as related by herself.  \"If she can get free with a little\nmoney, why not give her what I have?\" thought he, and then he\nresolved to do it.  An hour after, he came into the quadroon's\nroom, and laid the money in her lap, and said, \"There, Miss\nClotel, you said if you had the means you would leave this place;\nthere is money enough to take you to England, where you will be\nfree.  You are much fairer than many of the white women of the\nSouth, and can easily pass for a free white lady.\"  At first\nClotel feared that it was a plan by which the Negro wished to try\nher fidelity to her owner; but she was soon convinced by his\nearnest manner, and the deep feeling with which he spoke, that he\nwas honest.  \"I will take the money only on one condition,\" said\nshe; \"and that is, that I effect your escape as well as my own.\"\n\"How can that be done?\" he inquired.  \"I will assume the disguise\nof a gentleman and you that of a servant, and we will take\npassage on a steamboat and go to Cincinnati, and thence to\nCanada.\"  Here William put in several objections to the plan.  He\nfeared detection, and he well knew that, when a slave is once\ncaught when attempting to escape, if returned is sure to be worse\ntreated than before.  However, Clotel satisfied him that the plan\ncould be carried out if he would only play his part.\n\nThe resolution was taken, the clothes for her disguise procured,\nand before night everything was in readiness for their departure.\nThat night Mr. Cooper, their master, was to attend a party, and\nthis was their opportunity.  William went to the wharf to look out\nfor a boat, and had scarcely reached the landing ere he heard the\npuffing of a steamer.  He returned and reported the fact.  Clotel\nhad already packed her trunk, and had only to dress and all was\nready.  In less than an hour they were on board the boat.  Under\nthe assumed name of \"Mr. Johnson,\" Clotel went to the clerk's\noffice and took a private state room for herself, and paid her\nown and servant's fare.  Besides being attired in a neat suit of\nblack, she had a white silk handkerchief tied round her chin, as\nif she was an invalid.  A pair of green glasses covered her eyes;\nand fearing that she would be talked to too much and thus render\nher liable to be detected, she assumed to be very ill.  On the\nother hand, William was playing his part well in the servants'\nhall; he was talking loudly of his master's wealth.  Nothing\nappeared as good on the boat as in his master's fine mansion.\n\"I don't like dees steam-boats no how,\" said William; \"I hope when\nmarser goes on a journey agin he will take de carriage and de\nhosses.\"  Mr. Johnson (for such was the name by which Clotel now\nwent) remained in his room, to avoid, as far as possible,\nconversation with others.  After a passage of seven days they\narrived at Louisville, and put up at Gough's Hotel.  Here they had\nto await the departure of another boat for the North.  They were\nnow in their most critical position.  They were still in a slave\nstate, and John C. Calhoun, a distinguished slave-owner, was a\nguest at this hotel.  They feared, also, that trouble would attend\ntheir attempt to leave this place for the North, as all persons\ntaking Negroes with them have to give bail that such Negroes are\nnot runaway slaves.  The law upon this point is very stringent:\nall steamboats and other public conveyances are liable to a fine\nfor every slave that escapes by them, besides paying the full\nvalue for the slave.  After a delay of four hours, Mr. Johnson\nand servant took passage on the steamer Rodolph, for Pittsburgh.\nIt is usual, before the departure of the boats, for an officer to\nexamine every part of the vessel to see that no slave secretes\nhimself on board.  \"Where are you going?\" asked the officer of\nWilliam, as he was doing his duty on this occasion.  \"I am going\nwith marser,\" was the quick reply.  \"Who is your master?\"  \"Mr.\nJohnson, sir, a gentleman in the cabin.\"  \"You must take him to\nthe office and satisfy the captain that all is right, or you\ncan't go on this boat.\"  William informed his master what the\nofficer had said.  The boat was on the eve of going, and no time\ncould be lost, yet they knew not what to do.  At last they went to\nthe office, and Mr. Johnson, addressing the captain, said, \"I am\ninformed that my boy can't go with me unless I give security that\nhe belongs to me.  \"Yes,\" replied the captain, \"that is the law.\"\n\"A very strange law indeed,\" rejoined Mr. Johnson, \"that one\ncan't take his property with him.\"  After a conversation of some\nminutes, and a plea on the part of Johnson that he did not wish\nto be delayed owing to his illness, they were permitted to take\ntheir passage without farther trouble, and the boat was soon on\nits way up the river.  The fugitives had now passed the Rubicon,\nand the next place at which they would land would be in a Free\nState.  Clotel called William to her room, and said to him, \"We\nare now free, you can go on your way to Canada, and I shall go to\nVirginia in search of my daughter.\"  The announcement that she was\ngoing to risk her liberty in a Slave State was unwelcome news to\nWilliam.  With all the eloquence he could command, he tried to\npersuade Clotel that she could not escape detection, and was only\nthrowing her freedom away.  But she had counted the cost, and made\nup her mind for the worst.  In return for the money he had\nfurnished, she had secured for him his liberty, and their\nengagement was at an end.\n\nAfter a quick passage the fugitives arrived at Cincinnati, and\nthere separated.  William proceeded on his way to Canada, and\nClotel again resumed her own apparel, and prepared to start in\nsearch of her child.  As might have been expected, the escape of\nthose two valuable slaves created no little sensation in\nVicksburgh.  Advertisements and messages were sent in every\ndirection in which the fugitives were thought to have gone.  It was\nsoon, however, known that they had left the town as master and\nservant; and many were the communications which\nappeared in the newspapers, in which the writers thought, or\npretended, that they had seen the slaves in their disguise.  One\nwas to the effect that they had gone off in a chaise; one as\nmaster, and the other as servant.  But the most probable was an\naccount given by a correspondent of one of the Southern\nnewspapers, who happened to be a passenger in the same steamer in\nwhich the slaves escaped, and which we here give:--\n\n\"One bright starlight night, in the month of December last, I\nfound myself in the cabin of the steamer Rodolph, then lying in\nthe port of Vicksburgh, and bound to Louisville.  I had gone early\non board, in order to select a good berth, and having got tired of\nreading the papers, amused myself with watching the appearance of\nthe passengers as they dropped in, one after another, and I being\na believer in physiognomy, formed my own opinion of their\ncharacters.\n\n\"The second bell rang, and as I yawningly returned my watch to my\npocket, my attention was attracted by the appearance of a young\nman who entered the cabin supported by his servant, a strapping\nNegro.\n\n\"The man was bundled up in a capacious overcoat; his face was\nbandaged with a white handkerchief, and its expression entirely\nhid by a pair of enormous spectacles.\n\n\"There was something so mysterious and unusual about the young man\nas he sat restless in the corner, that curiosity led me to\nobserve him more closely.\n\n\"He appeared anxious to avoid notice, and before the steamer had\nfairly left the wharf, requested, in a low, womanly voice, to be\nshown his berth, as he was an invalid, and must retire early: his\nname he gave as Mr. Johnson.  His servant was called, and he was\nput quietly to bed.  I paced the deck until Tyhee light grew dim\nin the distance, and then went to my berth.\n\n\"I awoke in the morning with the sun shining in my face; we were\nthen just passing St. Helena.  It was a mild beautiful morning,\nand most of the passengers were on deck, enjoying the freshness\nof the air, and stimulating their appetites for breakfast.  Mr.\nJohnson soon made his appearance, arrayed as on the night before,\nand took his seat quietly upon the guard of the boat.\n\n\"From the better opportunity afforded by daylight, I found that\nhe was a slight build, apparently handsome young man, with black\nhair and eyes, and of a darkness of complexion that betokened\nSpanish extraction.  Any notice from others seemed painful to him;\nso to satisfy my curiosity, I questioned his servant, who was\nstanding near, and gained the following information.\n\n\"His master was an invalid--he had suffered for a long time under a\ncomplication of diseases, that had baffled the skill of the best\nphysicians in Mississippi; he was now suffering principally with\nthe 'rheumatism,' and he was scarcely able to walk or help himself\nin any way.  He came from Vicksburgh, and was now on his way to\nPhiladelphia, at which place resided his uncle, a celebrated\nphysician, and through whose means he hoped to be restored to\nperfect health.\n\n\"This information, communicated in a bold, off-hand manner,\nenlisted my sympathies for the sufferer, although it occurred to\nme that he walked rather too gingerly for a person afflicted with\nso many ailments.\"\n\nAfter thanking Clotel for the great service she had done him in\nbringing him out of slavery, William bade her farewell. The\nprejudice that exists in the Free States against coloured\npersons, on account of their colour, is attributable solely to\nthe influence of slavery, and is but another form of slavery\nitself.  And even the slave who escapes from the Southern\nplantations, is surprised when he reaches the North, at the\namount and withering influence of this prejudice.  William applied\nat the railway station for a ticket for the train going to\nSandusky, and was told that if he went by that train he would\nhave to ride in the luggage-van.  \"Why?\" asked the astonished\nNegro.  \"We don't send a Jim Crow carriage but once a day, and\nthat went this morning.\"  The \"Jim Crow\" carriage is the one in\nwhich the blacks have to ride.  Slavery is a school in which its\nvictims learn much shrewdness, and William had been an apt\nscholar.  Without asking any more questions, the Negro took his\nseat in one of the first-class carriages.  He was soon seen and\nordered out.  Afraid to remain in the town longer, he resolved to\ngo by that train; and consequently seated himself on a goods' box\nin the luggage van.  The train started at its proper time, and all\nwent on well.  Just before arriving at the end of the journey, the\nconductor called on William for his ticket.  \"I have none,\" was\nthe reply.  \"Well, then, you can pay your fare to me,\" said the\nofficer.  \"How much is it?\" asked the black man.  \"Two dollars.\"\n\"What do you charge those in the passenger-carriage?\"  \"Two\ndollars.\"  \"And do you charge me the same as you do those who ride\nin the best carriages?\" asked the Negro.  \"Yes,\" was the answer.\n\"I shan't pay it,\" returned the man.  \"You black scamp, do you\nthink you can ride on this road without paying your fare?\"  \"No, I\ndon't want to ride for nothing; I only want to pay what's right.\"\n\"Well, launch out two dollars, and that's right.\"  \"No, I shan't;\nI will pay what I ought, and won't pay any more.\"  \"Come, come,\nnigger, your fare and be done with it,\" said the conductor, in a\nmanner that is never used except by Americans to blacks.  \"I won't\npay you two dollars, and that enough,\" said William.  \"Well, as\nyou have come all the way in the luggage-van, pay me a dollar and\na half and you may go.\"  \"I shan't do any such thing.\"  \"Don't you\nmean to pay for riding?\"  \"Yes, but I won't pay a dollar and a\nhalf for riding up here in the freight-van.  If you had let me\ncome in the carriage where others ride, I would have paid you two\ndollars.\"  \"Where were you raised?  You seem to think yourself as\ngood as white folks.\"  \"I want nothing more than my rights.\"\n\"Well, give me a dollar, and I will let you off.\"  \"No, sir, I\nshan't do it.\"  \"What do you mean to do then, don't you wish to pay\nanything?\"  \"Yes, sir, I want to pay you the full price.\"  \"What do\nyou mean by full price?\"  \"What do you charge per hundred-weight\nfor goods?\" inquired the Negro with a degree of gravity that\nwould have astonished Diogenes himself.  \"A quarter of a dollar\nper hundred,\" answered the conductor.  \"I weigh just one hundred\nand fifty pounds,\" returned William, \"and will pay you three\neighths of a dollar.\"  \"Do you expect that you will pay only\nthirty-seven cents for your ride?\"  \"This, sir, is your own price.\nI came in a luggage-van, and I'll pay for luggage.\"  After a vain\neffort to get the Negro to pay more, the conductor took the\nthirty-seven cents, and noted in his cash-book, \"Received for one\nhundred and fifty pounds of luggage, thirty seven cents.\"  This,\nreader, is no fiction; it actually occurred in the railway above\ndescribed.\n\nThomas Corwin, a member of the American Congress, is one of the\nblackest white men in the United States.  He was once on his way\nto Congress, and took passage in one of the Ohio river steamers.\nAs he came just at the dinner hour, he immediately went into the\ndining saloon, and took his seat at the table.  A gentleman with\nhis whole party of five ladies at once left the table.  \"Where is\nthe captain?\" cried the man in an angry tone.  The captain soon\nappeared, and it was sometime before he could satisfy the old\ngent, that Governor Corwin was not a nigger.  The newspapers often\nhave notices of mistakes made by innkeepers and others who\nundertake to accommodate the public, one of which we give below.\n\nOn the 6th inst., the Hon. Daniel Webster and family entered\nEdgartown, on a visit for health and recreation.  Arriving at the\nhotel, without alighting from the coach, the landlord was sent\nfor to see if suitable accommodation could be had.  That dignitary\nappearing, and surveying Mr. Webster, while the hon. senator\naddressed him, seemed woefully to mistake the dark features of\nthe traveller as he sat back in the corner of the carriage, and\nto suppose him a coloured man, particularly as there were two\ncoloured servants of Mr. W. outside.  So he promptly declared that\nthere was no room for him and his family, and he could not be\naccommodated there at the same time suggesting that he might\nperhaps find accommodation at some of the huts up back, to which\nhe pointed.  So deeply did the prejudice of looks possess him,\nthat he appeared not to notice that the stranger introduced\nhimself to him as Daniel Webster, or to be so ignorant as not to\nhave heard of such a personage; and turning away, he expressed to\nthe driver his astonishment that he should bring black people\nthere for him to take in.  It was not till he had been repeatedly\nassured and made to understand that the said Daniel Webster was a\nreal live senator of the United States, that he perceived his\nawkward mistake and the distinguished honour which he and his\nhouse were so near missing.\n\nIn most of the Free States, the coloured people are disfranchised\non account of their colour.  The following scene, which we take\nfrom a newspaper in the state of Ohio, will give some idea of the\nextent to which this prejudice is carried.\n\n\"The whole of Thursday last was occupied by the Court of Common\nPleas for this county in trying to find out whether one Thomas\nWest was of the VOTING COLOUR, as some had very constitutional\ndoubts as to whether his colour was orthodox, and whether his\nhair was of the official crisp!  Was it not a dignified business?\nFour profound judges, four acute lawyers, twelve grave jurors,\nand I don't know how many venerable witnesses, making in all\nabout thirty men, perhaps, all engaged in the profound,\nlaborious, and illustrious business, of finding out whether a man\nwho pays tax, works on the road, and is an industrious farmer,\nhas been born according to the republican, Christian constitution\nof Ohio--so that he can vote!  And they wisely, gravely, and\n'JUDGMATICALLY' decided that he should not vote!  What wisdom--what\nresearch it must have required to evolve this truth!  It was left\nfor the Court of Common Pleas for Columbian county, Ohio, in the\nUnited States of North America, to find out what Solomon never\ndreamed of--the courts of all civilised, heathen, or Jewish\ncountries, never contemplated.  Lest the wisdom of our courts\nshould be circumvented by some such men as might be named, who\nare so near being born constitutionally that they might be taken\nfor white by sight, I would suggest that our court be invested\nwith SMELLING powers, and that if a man don't exhale the\nconstitutional smell, he shall not vote!  This would be an\nadditional security to our liberties.\"\n\nWilliam found, after all, that liberty in the so-called Free\nStates was more a name than a reality; that prejudice followed\nthe coloured man into every place that he might enter.  The\ntemples erected for the worship of the living God are no\nexception.  The finest Baptist church in the city of Boston has\nthe following paragraph in the deed that conveys its seats to\npewholders:\n\n\"And it is a further condition of these presents, that if the\nowner or owners of said pew shall determine hereafter to sell the\nsame, it shall first be offered, in writing, to the standing\ncommittee of said society for the time being, at such price as\nmight otherwise be obtained for it; and the said committee shall\nhave the right, for ten days after such offer, to purchase said\npew for said society, at that price, first deducting therefrom\nall taxes and assessments on said pew then remaining unpaid.  And\nif the said committee shall not so complete such purchase within\nsaid ten days, then the pew may be sold by the owner or owners\nthereof (after payment of all such arrears) to any one\nrespectable white person, but upon the same conditions as are\ncontained in this instrument; and immediate notice of such sale\nshall be given in writing, by the vendor, to the treasurer of\nsaid society.\"\n\nSuch are the conditions upon which the Rowe Street Baptist\nChurch, Boston, disposes of its seats.  The writer of this is able\nto put that whole congregation, minister and all, to flight, by\nmerely putting his coloured face in that church.  We once visited\na church in New York that had a place set apart for the sons of\nHam.  It was a dark, dismal looking place in one corner of the\ngallery, grated in front like a hen-coop, with a black border\naround it.  It had two doors; over one was B. M.--black men; over\nthe other B. W.--black women.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA TRUE DEMOCRAT\n\n      \"Who can, with patience, for a moment see\n         The medley mass of pride and misery,\n     Of whips and charters, manacles and rights,\n       Of slaving blacks and democratic whites,\n        And all the piebald policy that reigns\n      In free confusion o'er Columbia's plains?\n     To think that man, thou just and gentle God!\n    Should stand before thee with a tyrant's rod,\n  O'er creatures like himself, with souls from thee,\n Yet dare to boast of perfect liberty!\"--Thomas Moore.\n\nEDUCATED in a free state, and marrying a wife who had been a\nvictim to the institution of slavery, Henry Morton became\nstrongly opposed to the system.  His two daughters, at the age of\ntwelve years, were sent to the North to finish their education,\nand to receive that refinement that young ladies cannot obtain in\nthe Slave States.  Although he did not publicly advocate the\nabolition of slavery, he often made himself obnoxious to private\ncircles, owing to the denunciatory manner in which he condemned\nthe \"peculiar institution.\"  Being one evening at a party, and\nhearing one of the company talking loudly of the glory and\nfreedom of American institutions, he gave it as his opinion that,\nunless slavery was speedily abolished, it would be the ruin of\nthe Union.  \"It is not our boast of freedom,\" said he, \"that will\ncause us to be respected abroad.  It is not our loud talk in\nfavour of liberty that will cause us to be regarded as friends of\nhuman freedom; but our acts will be scrutinised by the people of\nother countries.  We say much against European despotism; let us\nlook to ourselves.  That government is despotic where the rulers\ngovern subjects by their own mere will--by decrees and laws\nemanating from their uncontrolled will, in the enactment and\nexecution of which the ruled have no voice, and under which they\nhave no right except at the will of the rulers.  Despotism does\nnot depend upon the number of the rulers, or the number of the\nsubjects.  It may have one ruler or many.  Rome was a despotism\nunder Nero; so she was under the triumvirate.  Athens was a\ndespotism under Thirty Tyrants; under her Four Hundred Tyrants;\nunder her Three Thousand Tyrants.  It has been generally observed\nthat despotism increases in severity with the number of despots;\nthe responsibility is more divided, and the claims more numerous.\nThe triumvirs each demanded his victims.  The smaller the number\nof subjects in proportion to the tyrants, the more cruel the\noppression, because the less danger from rebellion.  In this\ngovernment, the free white citizens are the rulers--the\nsovereigns, as we delight to be called.  All others are subjects.\nThere are, perhaps, some sixteen or seventeen millions of\nsovereigns, and four millions of subjects.\n\n\"The rulers and the ruled are of all colours, from the clear\nwhite of the Caucasian tribes to the swarthy Ethiopian.  The\nformer, by courtesy, are all called white, the latter black.  In\nthis government the subject has no rights, social, political, or\npersonal.  He has no voice in the laws which govern him.  He can\nhold no property.  His very wife and children are not his.  His\nlabour is another's.  He, and all that appertain to him, are the\nabsolute property of his rulers.  He is governed, bought, sold,\npunished, executed, by laws to which he never gave his assent,\nand by rulers whom he never chose.  He is not a serf merely, with\nhalf the rights of men like the subjects of despotic Russia; but\na native slave, stripped of every right which God and nature gave\nhim, and which the high spirit of our revolution declared\ninalienable which he himself could not surrender, and which man\ncould not take from him.  Is he not then the subject of despotic\nsway?\n\n\"The slaves of Athens and Rome were free in comparison.  They had\nsome rights--could acquire some property; could choose their own\nmasters, and purchase their own freedom; and, when free, could\nrise in social and political life.  The slaves of America, then,\nlie under the most absolute and grinding despotism that the world\never saw.  But who are the despots?  The rulers of the country--the\nsovereign people!  Not merely the slaveholder who cracks the lash.\nHe is but the instrument in the hands of despotism.  That\ndespotism is the government of the Slave States, and the United\nStates, consisting of all its rulers all the free citizens.  Do\nnot look upon this as a paradox, because you and I and the\nsixteen millions of rulers are free.  The rulers of every despotism\nare free.  Nicholas of Russia is free.  The grand Sultan of Turkey\nis free.  The butcher of Austria is free.  Augustus, Anthony, and\nLepidus were free, while they drenched Rome in blood.  The Thirty\nTyrants--the Four Hundred--the Three Thousand, were free while they\nbound their countrymen in chains.  You, and I, and the sixteen\nmillions are free, while we fasten iron chains, and rivet\nmanacles on four millions of our fellowmen--take their wives and\nchildren from them--separate them--sell them, and doom them to\nperpetual, eternal bondage.  Are we not then despots--despots such\nas history will brand and God abhor?\n\n\"We, as individuals, are fast losing our reputation for honest\ndealing.  Our nation is losing its character.  The loss of a firm\nnational character, or the degradation of a nation's honour, is\nthe inevitable prelude to her destruction.  Behold the once proud\nfabric of a Roman empire--an empire carrying its arts and arms\ninto every part of the Eastern continent; the monarchs of mighty\nkingdoms dragged at the wheels of her triumphal chariots; her\neagle waving over the ruins of desolated countries; where is her\nsplendour, her wealth, her power, her glory?  Extinguished for\never.  Her mouldering temples, the mournful vestiges of her former\ngrandeur, afford a shelter to her muttering monks.  Where are her\nstatesmen, her sages, her philosophers, her orators, generals?\nGo to their solitary tombs and inquire.  She lost her national\ncharacter, and her destruction followed.  The ramparts of her\nnational pride were broken down, and Vandalism desolated her\nclassic fields.  Then let the people of our country take warning\nere it is too late.  But most of us say to ourselves,\n\n    \"'Who questions the right of mankind to be free?\n     Yet, what are the rights of the Negro to me?\n   I'm well fed and clothed, I have plenty of pelf--\n I'll care for the blacks when I turn black myself.'\n\n\"New Orleans is doubtless the most immoral place in the United\nStates.  The theatres are open on the Sabbath.  Bull-fights,\nhorse-racing, and other cruel amusements are carried on in this\ncity to an extent unknown in any other part of the Union.  The most\nstringent laws have been passed in that city against Negroes, yet\na few years since the State Legislature passed a special act to\nenable a white man to marry a coloured woman, on account of her\nbeing possessed of a large fortune.  And, very recently, the\nfollowing paragraph appeared in the city papers:--\n\n\"'There has been quite a stir recently in this city, in\nconsequence of a marriage of a white man, named Buddington, a\nteller in the Canal Bank, to the Negro daughter of one of the\nwealthiest merchants.  Buddington, before he could be married\nwas obliged to swear that he had Negro blood in his veins, and\nto do this he made an incision in his arm, and put some of her\nblood in the cut.  The ceremony was performed by a Catholic\nclergyman, and the bridegroom has received with his wife a fortune\nof fifty or sixty thousand dollars.'\n\n\"It seems that the fifty or sixty thousand dollars entirely\ncovered the Negro woman's black skin, and the law prohibiting\nmarriage between blacks and whites was laid aside for the\noccasion.\"\n\nAlthesa felt proud, as well she might, at her husband's taking\nsuch high ground in a slaveholding city like New Orleans.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE CHRISTIAN'S DEATH\n\n   \"O weep, ye friends of freedom weep!\n Your harps to mournful measures sweep.\"\n\nON the last day of November, 1620, on the confines of the Grand\nBank of Newfoundland, lo! we behold one little solitary\ntempest-tost and weather-beaten ship; it is all that can be seen\non the length and breadth of the vast intervening solitudes, from\nthe melancholy wilds of Labrador and New England's ironbound\nshores, to the western coasts of Ireland and the rock defended\nHebrides, but one lonely ship greets the eye of angels or of men,\non this great throughfare of nations in our age.  Next in moral\ngrandeur, was this ship, to the great discoverer's: Columbus\nfound a continent; the May-flower brought the seedwheat of states\nand empire.  That is the May-flower, with its servants of the\nliving God, their wives and little ones, hastening to lay the\nfoundations of nations in the accidental lands of the\nsetting-sun.  Hear the voice of prayer to God for his protection,\nand the glorious music of praise, as it breaks into the wild\ntempest of the mighty deep, upon the ear of God.  Here in this\nship are great and good men.  Justice, mercy, humanity, respect\nfor the rights of all; each man honoured, as he was useful to\nhimself and others; labour respected, law-abiding men,\nconstitution-making and respecting men; men, whom no tyrant could\nconquer, or hardship overcome, with the high commission sealed by\na Spirit divine, to establish religious and political liberty for\nall.  This ship had the embryo elements of all that is useful,\ngreat, and grand in Northern institutions; it was the great type\nof goodness and wisdom, illustrated in two and a quarter\ncenturies gone by; it was the good genius of America.\n\nBut look far in the South-east, and you behold on the same day, in\n1620, a low rakish ship hastening from the tropics, solitary and\nalone, to the New World.  What is she?  She is freighted with the\nelements of unmixed evil.  Hark! hear those rattling chains, hear\nthat cry of despair and wail of anguish, as they die away in the\nunpitying distance.  Listen to those shocking oaths, the crack of\nthat flesh-cutting whip.  Ah! it is the first cargo of slaves on\ntheir way to Jamestown, Virginia.  Behold the May-flower anchored\nat Plymouth Rock, the slave-ship in James River.  Each a parent,\none of the prosperous, labour-honouring, law-sustaining\ninstitutions of the North; the other the mother of slavery,\nidleness, lynch-law, ignorance, unpaid labour, poverty, and\nduelling, despotism, the ceaseless swing of the whip, and the\npeculiar institutions of the South.  These ships are the\nrepresentation of good and evil in the New World, even to our day.\nWhen shall one of those parallel lines come to an end?\n\nThe origin of American slavery is not lost in the obscurity of\nby-gone ages.  It is a plain historical fact, that it owes its\nbirth to the African slave trade, now pronounced by every\ncivilised community the greatest crime ever perpetrated against\nhumanity.  Of all causes intended to benefit mankind, the\nabolition of chattel slavery must necessarily be placed amongst\nthe first, and the Negro hails with joy every new advocate that\nappears in his cause.  Commiseration for human suffering and human\nsacrifices awakened the capacious mind, and brought into action\nthe enlarged benevolence, of Georgiana Carlton.  With respect to\nher philosophy--it was of a noble cast.  It was, that all men are\nby nature equal; that they are wisely and justly endowed by the\nCreator with certain rights, which are irrefragable; and that,\nhowever human pride and human avarice may depress and debase,\nstill God is the author of good to man--and of evil, man is the\nartificer to himself and to his species.  Unlike Plato and\nSocrates, her mind was free from the gloom that surrounded\ntheirs; her philosophy was founded in the school of Christianity;\nthough a devoted member of her father's church, she was not a\nsectarian.\n\nWe learn from Scripture, and it is a little remarkable that it is\nthe only exact definition of religion found in the sacred volume,\nthat \"pure religion and undefiled before God, even the Father, is\nthis, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and\nto keep oneself unspotted from the world.\"  \"Look not every man on\nhis own things, but every man also on the things of others.\"\n\"Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them.\"  \"Whatsoever\nye would that others should do to you, do ye even so to them.\"\n\nThis was her view of Christianity, and to this end she laboured\nwith all her energies to convince her slaveholding neighbours\nthat the Negro could not only take care of himself, but that he\nalso appreciated liberty, and was willing to work and redeem\nhimself.  Her most sanguine wishes were being realized when she\nsuddenly fell into a decline.  Her mother had died of consumption,\nand her physician pronounced this to be her disease.  She was\nprepared for this sad intelligence, and received it with the\nutmost composure.  Although she had confidence in her husband that\nhe would carry out her wishes in freeing the Negroes after her\ndeath, Mrs. Carlton resolved upon their immediate liberation.\nConsequently the slaves were all summoned before the noble woman,\nand informed that they were no longer bondsmen.  \"From this\nhour,\" said she, \"you are free, and all eyes will be fixed upon\nyou.  I dare not predict how far your example may affect the\nwelfare of your brethren yet in bondage.  If you are temperate,\nindustrious, peaceable, and pious, you will show to the world\nthat slaves can be emancipated without danger.  Remember what a\nsingular relation you sustain to society.  The necessities of the\ncase require not only that you should behave as well as the\nwhites, but better than the whites; and for this reason: if you\nbehave no better than they, your example will lose a great\nportion of its influence.  Make the Lord Jesus Christ your refuge\nand exemplar.  His is the only standard around which you can\nsuccessfully rally.  If ever there was a people who needed the\nconsolations of religion to sustain them in their grievous\nafflictions, you are that people.  You had better trust in the\nLord than to put confidence in man.  Happy is that people whose\nGod is the Lord.  Get as much education as possible for\nyourselves and your children.  An ignorant people can never occupy\nany other than a degraded station in society; they can never be\ntruly free until they are intelligent.  In a few days you will\nstart for the state of Ohio, where land will be purchased for\nsome of you who have families, and where I hope you will all\nprosper.  We have been urged to send you to Liberia, but we think\nit wrong to send you from your native land.  We did not wish to\nencourage the Colonization Society, for it originated in hatred\nof the free coloured people.  Its pretences are false, its\ndoctrines odious, its means contemptible.  Now, whatever may be\nyour situation in life, 'Remember those in bonds as bound with\nthem.'  You must get ready as soon as you can for your journey to\nthe North.\"\n\nSeldom was there ever witnessed a more touching scene than this.\nThere sat the liberator, pale, feeble, emaciated, with death\nstamped upon her countenance, surrounded by the sons and\ndaughters of Africa; some of whom had in former years been\nseparated from all that they had held near and dear, and the most\nof whose backs had been torn and gashed by the Negro whip.  Some\nwere upon their knees at the feet of their benefactress; others\nwere standing round her weeping.  Many begged that they might be\npermitted to remain on the farm and work for wages, for some had\nwives and some husbands on other plantations in the neighbourhood,\nand would rather remain with them.\n\nBut the laws of the state forbade any emancipated Negroes\nremaining, under penalty of again being sold into slavery.  Hence\nthe necessity of sending them out of the state.  Mrs. Carlton was\nurged by her friends to send the emancipated Negroes to Africa.\nExtracts from the speeches of Henry Clay, and other distinguished\nColonization Society men, were read to her to induce her to adopt\nthis course.  Some thought they should he sent away because the\nblacks are vicious; others because they would be missionaries to\ntheir brethren in Africa.  \"But,\" said she, \"if we send away the\nNegroes because they are profligate and vicious, what sort of\nmissionaries will they make?  Why not send away the vicious among\nthe whites for the same reason, and the same purpose?\"\n\nDeath is a leveller, and neither age, sex, wealth, nor usefulness\ncan avert when he is permitted to strike.  The most beautiful\nflowers soon fade, and droop, and die; this is also the case with\nman; his days are uncertain as the passing breeze.  This hour he\nglows in the blush of health and vigour, but the next he may be\ncounted with the number no more known on earth.\n\nAlthough in a low state of health, Mrs. Carlton had the pleasure\nof seeing all her slaves, except Sam and three others, start for\na land of freedom.  The morning they were to go on board the\nsteamer, bound for Louisville, they all assembled on the large\ngrass plot, in front of the drawing-room window, and wept while\nthey bid their mistress farewell.  When they were on the boat,\nabout leaving the wharf, they were heard giving the charge to\nthose on shore--\"Sam, take care of Misus, take care of Marser, as\nyou love us, and hope to meet us in de Hio (Ohio), and in heben;\nbe sure and take good care of Misus and Marser.\"\n\nIn less than a week after her emancipated people had started for\nOhio, Mrs. Carlton was cold in death.  Mr. Carlton felt deeply, as\nall husbands must who love their wives, the loss of her who had\nbeen a lamp to his feet, and a light to his path.  She had\nconverted him from infidelity to Christianity; from the mere\ntheory of liberty to practical freedom.  He had looked upon the\nNegro as an ill-treated distant link of the human family; he now\nregarded them as a part of God's children.  Oh, what a silence\npervaded the house when the Christian had been removed.  His\nindeed was a lonesome position.\n\n  \"'Twas midnight, and he sat alone\n       The husband of the dead,\nThat day the dark dust had been thrown\n        Upon the buried head.\"\n\nIn the midst of the buoyancy of youth, this cherished one had\ndrooped and died.  Deep were the sounds of grief and mourning\nheard in that stately dwelling, when the stricken friends, whose\noffice it had been to nurse and soothe the weary sufferer, beheld\nher pale and motionless in the sleep of death.\n\nOh what a chill creeps through the breaking heart when we look\nupon the insensible form, and feel that it no longer contains the\nspirit we so dearly loved!  How difficult to realise that the eye\nwhich always glowed with affection and intelligence; that the ear\nwhich had so often listened to the sounds of sorrow and gladness;\nthat the voice whose accents had been to us like sweet music, and\nthe heart, the habitation of benevolence and truth, are now\npowerless and insensate as the bier upon which the form rests.\nThough faith be strong enough to penetrate the cloud of gloom\nwhich hovers near, and to behold the freed spirit safe, for ever,\nsafe in its home in heaven, yet the thoughts will linger sadly\nand cheerlessly upon the grave.\n\nPeace to her ashes! she fought the fight, obtained the Christian's\nvictory, and wears the crown.  But if it were that departed\nspirits are permitted to note the occurrences of this world, with\nwhat a frown of disapprobation would hers view the effort being\nmade in the United States to retard the work of emancipation for\nwhich she laboured and so wished to see brought about.\n\nIn what light would she consider that hypocritical priesthood who\ngave their aid and sanction to the infamous \"Fugitive Slave Law.\"\nIf true greatness consists in doing good to mankind, then was\nGeorgiana Carlton an ornament to human nature.  Who can think of\nthe broken hearts made whole, of sad and dejected countenances\nnow beaming with contentment and joy, of the mother offering her\nfree-born babe to heaven, and of the father whose cup of joy\nseems overflowing in the presence of his family, where none can\nmolest or make him afraid.  Oh, that God may give more such persons\nto take the whip-scarred Negro by the hand, and raise\nhim to a level with our common humanity!  May the professed lovers\nof freedom in the new world see that true liberty is freedom for\nall! and may every American continually hear it sounding in his\near:--\n\n\n\n \"Shall every flap of England's flag\n  Proclaim that all around are free,\nFrom 'farthest Ind' to each blue crag\n  That beetles o'er the Western Sea?\nAnd shall we scoff at Europe's kings,\n When Freedom's fire is dim with us,\n And round our country's altar clings\nThe damning shade of Slavery's curse?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA RIDE IN A STAGE-COACH\n\nWE shall now return to Cincinnati, where we left Clotel preparing\nto go to Richmond in search of her daughter.  Tired of the\ndisguise in which she had escaped, she threw it off on her\narrival at Cincinnati.  But being assured that not a shadow of\nsafety would attend her visit to a city in which she was well\nknown, unless in some disguise, she again resumed men's apparel\non leaving Cincinnati.  This time she had more the appearance of an\nItalian or Spanish gentleman.  In addition to the fine suit of\nblack cloth, a splendid pair of dark false whiskers covered the\nsides of her face, while the curling moustache found its place\nupon the upper lip.  From practice she had become accustomed to\nhigh-heeled boots, and could walk without creating any suspicion\nas regarded her sex.  It was a cold evening that Clotel arrived at\nWheeling, and took a seat in the coach going to Richmond.  She was\nalready in the state of Virginia, yet a long distance from the\nplace of her destination.\n\nA ride in a stage-coach, over an American road, is unpleasant\nunder the most favourable circumstances.  But now that it was\nwinter, and the roads unusually bad, the journey was still more\ndreary.  However, there were eight passengers in the coach, and I\nneed scarcely say that such a number of genuine Americans could\nnot be together without whiling away the time somewhat\npleasantly.  Besides Clotel, there was an elderly gentleman with\nhis two daughters--one apparently under twenty years, the other a\nshade above.  The pale, spectacled face of another slim, tall man,\nwith a white neckerchief, pointed him out as a minister.  The\nrough featured, dark countenance of a stout looking man, with a\nwhite hat on one side of his head, told that he was from the\nsunny South.  There was nothing remarkable about the other two,\nwho might pass for ordinary American gentlemen.  It was on the eve\nof a presidential election, when every man is thought to be a\npolitician.  Clay, Van Buren, and Harrison were the men who\nexpected the indorsement of the Baltimore Convention.  \"Who does\nthis town go for?\" asked the old gent with the ladies, as the\ncoach drove up to an inn, where groups of persons were waiting\nfor the latest papers.  \"We are divided,\" cried the rough voice of\none of the outsiders.  \"Well, who do you think will get the\nmajority here?\" continued the old gent.  \"Can't tell very well; I\ngo for 'Old Tip,'\" was the answer from without.  This brought up\nthe subject fairly before the passengers, and when the coach\nagain started a general discussion commenced, in which all took a\npart except Clotel and the young ladies.  Some were for Clay, some\nfor Van Buren, and others for \"Old Tip.\"  The coach stopped to\ntake in a real farmer-looking man, who no sooner entered than he\nwas saluted with \"Do you go for Clay?\"  \"No,\" was the answer.  \"Do\nyou go for Van Buren?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, then, of course you will go\nfor Harrison.\"  \"No.\"  \"Why, don't you mean to work for any of them\nat the election?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, who will you work for?\" asked\none of the company.  \"I work for Betsy and the children, and I\nhave a hard job of it at that,\" replied the farmer, without a\nsmile.  This answer, as a matter of course, set the new\ncorner down as one upon whom the rest of the passengers could\ncrack their jokes with the utmost impunity.  \"Are you an Odd\nFellow?\" asked one.  \"No, sir, I've been married more than a\nmonth.\"  \"I mean, do you belong to the order of Odd Fellows?\"\n\"No, no; I belong to the order of married men.\"  \"Are you a mason?\"\n\"No, I am a carpenter by trade.\"  \"Are you a Son of Temperance?\"\n\"Bother you, no; I am a son of Mr. John Gosling.\"  After a hearty\nlaugh in which all joined, the subject of Temperance became the\ntheme for discussion.  In this the spectacled gent was at home.\nHe soon showed that he was a New Englander, and went the whole\nlength of the \"Maine Law.\"  The minister was about having it all\nhis own way, when the Southerner, in the white hat, took the\nopposite side of the question.  \"I don't bet a red cent on these\nteetotlars,\" said he, and at the same time looking round to see\nif he had the approbation of the rest of the company.  \"Why?\"\nasked the minister.  \"Because they are a set who are afraid to\nspend a cent.  They are a bad lot, the whole on 'em.\"  It was\nevident that the white hat gent was an uneducated man.  The\nminister commenced in full earnest, and gave an interesting\naccount of the progress of temperance in Connecticut, the state\nfrom which he came, proving, that a great portion of the\nprosperity of the state was attributable to the disuse of\nintoxicating drinks.  Every one thought the white hat had got the\nworst of the argument, and that he was settled for the remainder\nof the night.  But not he; he took fresh courage and began again.\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I have just been on a visit to my uncle's in\nVermont, and I guess I knows a little about these here\nteetotlars.  You see, I went up there to make a little stay of a\nfortnight.  I got there at night, and they seemed glad to see\nme, but they didn't give me a bit of anything to drink.\nWell, thinks I to myself, the jig's up: I sha'n't get any more\nliquor till I get out of the state.\"  We all sat up till twelve\no'clock that night, and I heard nothing but talk about the\n'Juvinal Temperence Army,' the 'Band of Hope,' the 'Rising\nGeneration,' the 'Female Dorcas Temperance Society,' 'The None\nSuch,' and I don't know how many other names they didn't have.\nAs I had taken several pretty large 'Cock Tails' before I entered\nthe state, I thought upon the whole that I would not spite for\nthe want of liquor.  The next morning, I commenced writing back to\nmy friends, and telling them what's what.  Aunt Polly said, 'Well,\nJohnny, I s'pose you are given 'em a pretty account of us all\nhere.'  'Yes,' said I; I am tellin' 'em if they want anything to\ndrink when they come up here, they had better bring it with 'em.'\n'Oh,' said aunty, 'they would search their boxes; can't bring any\nspirits in the state.'  Well, as I was saying, jist as I got my\nletters finished, and was going to the post office (for uncle's\nhouse was two miles from the town), aunty says, 'Johnny, I s'pose\nyou'll try to get a little somethin' to drink in town won't you?'\nSays I, 'I s'pose it's no use.  'No,' said she, 'you can't; it\nain't to be had no how, for love nor money.'  So jist as I was\nputtin' on my hat, 'Johnny,' cries out aunty, 'What,' says I.\n'Now I'll tell you, I don't want you to say nothin' about it, but\nI keeps a little rum to rub my head with, for I am troubled with\nthe headache; now I don't want you to mention it for the world,\nbut I'll give you a little taste, the old man is such a\nteetotaller, that I should never hear the last of it, and I would\nnot like for the boys to know it, they are members of the \"Cold\nWater Army.\"'\n\n\"Aunty now brought out a black bottle and gave me a cup, and told\nme to help myself, which I assure you I did.  I now felt ready to\nface the cold.  As I was passing the barn I heard uncle thrashing\noats, so I went to the door and spoke to him. 'Come in, John,'\nsays he.  'No,' said I; 'I am goin' to post some letters,' for I\nwas afraid that he would smell my breath if I went too near to\nhim.  'Yes, yes, come in.'  So I went in, and says he, 'It's now\neleven o'clock; that's about the time you take your grog, I\ns'pose, when you are at home.'  'Yes,' said I.  'I am sorry for\nyou, my lad; you can't get anything up here; you can't even get\nit at the chemist's, except as medicine, and then you must let\nthem mix it and you take it in their presence.'  'This is indeed\nhard,' replied I; 'Well, it can't be helped,' continued he: 'and\nit ought not to be if it could.  It's best for society; people's\nbetter off without drink.  I recollect when your father and I,\nthirty years ago, used to go out on a spree and spend more than\nhalf a dollar in a night.  Then here's the rising generation;\nthere's nothing like settin' a good example.  Look how healthy\nyour cousins are there's Benjamin, he never tasted spirits in his\nlife.  Oh, John, I would you were a teetotaller.'  'I suppose,'\nsaid I, 'I'll have to be one till I leave the state.'  'Now,' said\nhe, 'John, I don't want you to mention it, for your aunt would go\ninto hysterics if she thought there was a drop of intoxicating\nliquor about the place, and I would not have the boys to know it\nfor anything, but I keep a little brandy to rub my joints for the\nrheumatics, and being it's you, I'll give you a little dust.'  So\nthe old man went to one corner of the barn, took out a brown jug\nand handed it to me, and I must say it was a little the best\ncognac that I had tasted for many a day.  Says I, 'Uncle, you are\na good judge of brandy.'  'Yes,' said he, 'I learned when I was\nyoung.'  So off I started for the post office. In returnin' I\nthought I'd jist go through the woods where the boys were chopping\nwood, and wait and go to the house with them when they went to\ndinner.  I found them hard at work, but as merry as crickets.\n'Well, cousin John, are you done writing?'  'Yes,' answered I.\n'Have you posted them?'  'Yes.'  'Hope you didn't go to any place\ninquiring for grog.'  'No, I knowed it was no good to do that.'\n'I suppose a cock-tail would taste good now.'  'Well, I\nguess it would,' says I.  The three boys then joined in a hearty\nlaugh.  'I suppose you have told 'em that we are a dry set up\nhere?'  'Well, I ain't told em anything else.'  'Now, cousin John,'\nsaid Edward, 'if you wont say anything, we will give you a small\ntaste.  For mercy's sake don't let father or mother know it; they\nare such rabid teetotallers, that they would not sleep a wink\nto-night if they thought there was any spirits about the place.'\n'I am mum,' says I.  And the boys took a jug out of a hollow\nstump, and gave me some first-rate peach brandy.  And during the\nfortnight that I was in Vermont, with my teetotal relations, I\nwas kept about as well corned as if I had been among my hot water\nfriends in Tennessee.\"\n\nThis narrative, given by the white hat man, was received with\nunbounded applause by all except the pale gent in spectacles,\nwho showed, by the way in which he was running his fingers\nbetween his cravat and throat, that he did not intend to \"give it\nup so.\"  The white hat gent was now the lion of the company.\n\n\"Oh, you did not get hold of the right kind of teetotallers,\"\nsaid the minister.  \"I can give you a tale worth a dozen of yours,\ncontinued he.  \"Look at society in the states where temperance\nviews prevail, and you will there see real happiness.  The people\nare taxed less, the poor houses are shut up for want of\noccupants, and extreme destitution is unknown.  Every one who\ndrinks at all is liable to become an habitual drunkard.  Yes, I\nsay boldly, that no man living who uses intoxicating drinks, is\nfree from the danger of at least occasional, and if of\noccasional, ultimately of habitual excess.  There seems to be no\ncharacter, position, or circumstances that free men from the\ndanger.  I have known many young men of the finest promise, led by\nthe drinking habit into vice, ruin, and early death.  I have known\nmany tradesmen whom it has made bankrupt.  I have known Sunday\nscholars whom it has led to prison-teachers, and even\nsuperintendents, whom it has dragged down to profligacy.  I have\nknown ministers of high academic honours, of splendid eloquence,\nnay, of vast usefulness, whom it has fascinated, and hurried over\nthe precipice of public infamy with their eyes open, and gazing\nwith horror on their fate.  I have known men of the strongest and\nclearest intellect and of vigorous resolution, whom it has made\nweaker than children and fools--gentlemen of refinement and taste\nwhom it has debased into brutes--poets of high genius whom it has\nbound in a bondage worse than the galleys, and ultimately cut\nshort their days.  I have known statesmen, lawyers, and judges\nwhom it has killed--kind husbands and fathers whom it has turned\ninto monsters.  I have known honest men whom it has made villains;\nelegant and Christian ladies whom it has converted into bloated\nsots.\"\n\n\"But you talk too fast,\" replied the white hat man.  \"You don't\ngive a feller a chance to say nothin'.\"\n\n\"I heard you,\" continued the minister, \"and now you hear me out.\nIt is indeed wonderful how people become lovers of strong drink.\nSome years since, before I became a teetotaller I kept spirits\nabout the house, and I had a servant who was much addicted to\nstrong drink.  He used to say that he could not make my boots\nshine, without mixing the blacking with whiskey.  So to satisfy\nmyself that the whiskey was put in the blacking, one morning I\nmade him bring the dish in which he kept the blacking, and poured\nin the whiskey myself.  And now, sir, what do you think?\"  \"Why, I\ns'pose your boots shined better than before,\" replied the white\nhat.  \"No,\" continued the minister. \"He took the blacking out, and\nI watched him, and he drank down the whiskey, blacking, and all.\"\n\nThis turned the joke upon the advocate of strong drink, and he\nbegan to put his wits to work for arguments.  \"You are from\nConnecticut, are you?\" asked the Southerner.  \"Yes, and we are an\norderly, pious, peaceable people.  Our holy religion is respected,\nand we do more for the cause of Christ than the whole Southern\nStates put together.\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" said the white hat\ngent.  \"You sell wooden nutmegs and other spurious articles enough\nto do some good.  You talk of your 'holy religion'; but your\nrobes' righteousness are woven at Lowell and Manchester; your\nparadise is high per centum on factory stocks; your palms of\nvictory and crowns of rejoicing are triumphs over a rival party\nin politics, on the questions of banks and tariffs.  If you could,\nyou would turn heaven into Birmingham, make every angel a weaver,\nand with the eternal din of looms and spindles drown all the\nanthems of the morning stars.  Ah! I know you Connecticut people\nlike a book.  No, no, all hoss; you can't come it on me.\"  This\nlast speech of the rough featured man again put him in the\nascendant, and the spectacled gent once more ran his fingers\nbetween his cravat and throat.  \"You live in Tennessee, I think,\"\nsaid the minister.  \"Yes,\" replied the Southerner, \"I used\nto live in Orleans, but now I claim to be a Tennessean.\"\n\"Your people of New Orleans are the most ungodly set in the\nUnited States,\" said the minister.  Taking a New Orleans newspaper\nfrom his pocket he continued, \"Just look here, there are not less\nthan three advertisements of bull fights to take place on the\nSabbath.  You people of the Slave States have no regard for the\nSabbath, religion, morality or anything else intended to, make\nmankind better.\"  Here Clotel could have borne ample testimony, had\nshe dared to have taken sides with the Connecticut man.  Her\nresidence in Vicksburgh had given her an opportunity of knowing\nsomething of the character of the inhabitants of the far South.\n\"Here is an account of a grand bull fight that took place in New\nOrleans a week ago last Sunday. I will read it to you.\"  And the\nminister read aloud the following:\n\n\"Yesterday, pursuant to public notice, came off at Gretna,\nopposite the Fourth District, the long heralded fight between the\nfamous grizzly bear, General Jackson (victor in fifty battles),\nand the Attakapas bull, Santa Anna.\n\n\"The fame of the coming conflict had gone forth to the four winds,\nand women and children, old men and boys, from all parts of the\ncity, and from the breezy banks of Lake Pontchartrain and Borgne,\nbrushed up their Sunday suit, and prepared to ace the fun.  Long\nbefore the published hour, the quiet streets of the rural Gretna\nwere filled with crowds of anxious denizens, flocking to the\narena, and before the fight commenced, such a crowd had collected\nas Gretna had not seen, nor will be likely to see again.\n\n\"The arena for the sports was a cage, twenty feet square, built\nupon the ground, and constructed of heavy timbers and iron bars.\nAround it were seats, circularly placed, and intended to\naccommodate many thousands.  About four or five-thousand persons\nassembled, covering the seats as with a Cloud, and crowding down\naround the cage, were within reach of the bars.\n\n\"The bull selected to sustain the honour and verify the pluck of\nAttakapas on this trying occasion was a black animal from the\nOpelousas, lithe and sinewy as a four year old courser, and with\neyes like burning coals.  His horns bore the appearance of\nhaving been filed at the tips, and wanted that keen and slashing\nappearance so common with others of his kith and kin; otherwise\nit would have been 'all day' with Bruin--at the first pass, and\nno mistake.\n\n\"The bear was an animal of note, and called General Jackson, from\nthe fact of his licking up everything that came in his way, and\ntaking 'the responsibility' on all occasions.  He was a wicked\nlooking beast, very lean and unamiable in aspect, with hair all\nstanding the wrong way.  He had fought some fifty bulls (so they\nsaid), always coming out victorious, but that neither one of the\nfifty had been an Attakapas bull, the bills of the performances\ndid not say.  Had he tackled Attakapas first it is likely his\nfifty battles would have remained unfought.\n\n\"About half past four o'clock the performances commenced.\n\n\"The bull was first seen, standing in the cage alone, with head\nerect, and looking a very monarch in his capacity.  At an\nappointed signal, a cage containing the bear was placed\nalongside the arena, and an opening being made, bruin stalked into\nthe battle ground--not, however, without sundry stirrings up with\na ten foot pole, he being experienced in such matters, and\nbackwards in raising a row.\n\n\"Once on the battle-field, both animals stood, like wary\nchampions, eyeing each other, the bear cowering low, with head\nupturned and fangs exposed, while Attakapas stood wondering, with\nhis eye dilated, lashing his sides with his long and bushy tail,\nand pawing up the earth in very wrath.\n\n\"The bear seemed little inclined to begin the attack, and the\nbull, standing a moment, made steps first backward and then\nforward, as if measuring his antagonist, and meditating where to\nplant a blow.  Bruin wouldn't come to the scratch no way, till one\nof the keepers, with an iron rod, tickled his ribs and made him\nmove.  Seeing this, Attakapas took it as a hostile demonstration,\nand, gathering his strength, dashed savagely at the enemy,\ncatching him on the points of his horns, and doubling him up like\na sack of bran against the bars.  Bruin 'sung out' at this, 'and\nmade a dash for his opponent's nose.'\n\n\"Missing this, the bull turned to the 'about face,' and the bear\ncaught him by the ham, inflicting a ghastly wound.  But Attakapas\nwith a kick shook him off, and renewing the attack, went at him\nagain, head on and with a rush.  This time he was not so fortunate,\nfor the bear caught him above the eye, burying his fangs in the\ntough hide, and holding him as in a vice.  It was now\nthe bull's turn to 'sing out,' and he did it, bellowing forth with\na voice more hideous than that of all the bulls of Bashan.  Some\nminutes stood matters thus, and the cries of the bull, mingled\nwith the hoarse growls of the bear, made hideous music, fit only\nfor a dance of devils.  Then came a pause (the bear having\nrelinquished his hold), and for a few minutes it was doubtful\nwhether the fun was not up.  But the magic wand of the keeper (the\nten foot pole) again stirred up bruin, and at it they went, and\nwith a rush.\n\n\"Bruin now tried to fasten on the bull's back, and drove his tusks\nin him in several places, making the red blood flow like wine\nfrom the vats of Luna.  But Attakapas was pluck to the back bone,\nand, catching bruin on the tips of his horns, shuffled him up\nright merrily, making the fur fly like feathers in a gale of\nwind.  Bruin cried 'Nuff' (in bear language), but the bull\nfollowed up his advantage, and, making one furious plunge full at\nthe figure head of the enemy, struck a horn into his eye, burying\nit there, and dashing the tender organ into darkness and atoms.\nBlood followed the blow, and poor bruin, blinded, bleeding, and\nin mortal agony, turned with a howl to leave, but Attakapas\ncaught him in the retreat, and rolled him over like a ball.  Over\nand over again this rolling over was enacted, and finally, after\nmore than an hour, bruin curled himself up on his back, bruised,\nbloody, and dead beat.  The thing was up with California, and\nAttakapas was declared the victor amidst the applause of the\nmultitude that made the heavens ring.\"\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"can you find anything against Connecticut equal\nto that?\"  The Southerner had to admit that he was beat by the\nYankee.  During all this time, it must not be supposed that the\nold gent with the two daughters, and even the young ladies\nthemselves, had been silent.  Clotel and they had not only given\ntheir opinions as regarded the merits of the discussion, but that\nsly glance of the eye, which is ever given where the young of\nboth sexes meet, had been freely at work.  The American ladies are\nrather partial to foreigners, and Clotel had the appearance of a\nfine Italian.  The old gentleman was now near his home,\nand a whisper from the eldest daughter, who was unmarried but\nmarriageable, induced him to extend to \"Mr. Johnson\" an invitation\nto stop and spend a week with the young ladies at their family\nresidence.  Clotel excused herself upon various grounds, and at\nlast, to cut short the matter, promised that she would pay them a\nvisit on her return.  The arrival of the coach at Lynchburgh\nseparated the young ladies from the Italian gent, and the coach\nagain resumed its journey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION\n\n      \"Is the poor privilege to turn the key\n      Upon the captive, freedom?  He's as far\n     From the enjoyment of the earth and air\n Who watches o'er the chains, as they who wear.\"\n\nDURING certain seasons of the year, all tropical climates are\nsubject to epidemics of a most destructive nature.  The\ninhabitants of New Orleans look with as much certainty for the\nappearance of the yellow-fever, small-pox, or cholera, in the hot\nseason, as the Londoner does for fog in the month of November.  In\nthe summer of 1831, the people of New Orleans were visited with\none of these epidemics.  It appeared in a form unusually repulsive\nand deadly.  It seized persons who were in health, without any\npremonition.  Sometimes death was the immediate consequence.  The\ndisorder began in the brain, by an oppressive pain accompanied or\nfollowed by fever.  The patient was devoured with burning thirst.\nThe stomach, distracted by pains, in vain sought relief in efforts\nto disburden itself.  Fiery veins streaked the eye; the face was\ninflamed, and dyed of a dark dull red colour; the ears from time\nto time rang painfully.  Now mucous secretions surcharged the\ntongue, and took away the power of speech; now the sick one\nspoke, but in speaking had a foresight of death.  When the violence\nof the disease approached the heart, the gums were blackened.  The\nsleep, broken, troubled by convulsions, or by frightful visions,\nwas worse than the waking hours; and when the reason\nsank under a delirium which had its seat in the brain, repose\nutterly forsook the patient's couch.  The progress of the heat\nwithin was marked by yellowish spots, which spread over the\nsurface of the body.  If, then, a happy crisis came not, all hope\nwas gone.  Soon the breath infected the air with a fetid odour, the\nlips were glazed, despair painted itself in the eyes, and sobs,\nwith long intervals of silence, formed the only language.  From\neach side of the mouth spread foam, tinged with black and burnt\nblood.  Blue streaks mingled with the yellow all over the frame.\nAll remedies were useless.  This was the Yellow Fever.  The\ndisorder spread alarm and confusion throughout the city.  On an\naverage, more than 400 died daily.  In the midst of disorder and\nconfusion, death heaped victims on victims.  Friend followed\nfriend in quick succession.  The sick were avoided from the fear\nof contagion, and for the same reason the dead were left\nunburied.  Nearly 2000 dead bodies lay uncovered in the\nburial-ground, with only here and there a little lime thrown\nover them, to prevent the air becoming infected.\n\nThe Negro, whose home is in a hot climate, was not proof against\nthe disease.  Many plantations had to suspend their work for want\nof slaves to take the places of those carried off by the fever.\nHenry Morton and wife were among the thirteen thousand swept away\nby the raging disorder that year.  Like too many, Morton had been\ndealing extensively in lands and stocks; and though apparently in\ngood circumstances was, in reality, deeply involved in debt.\nAlthesa, although as white as most white women in a southern\nclime, was, as we already know, born a slave.  By the laws of all\nthe Southern States the children follow the condition of the\nmother.  If the mother is free the children are free; if a slave,\nthey are slaves.  Morton was unacquainted with the laws\nof the land; and although he had married Althesa, it was a\nmarriage which the law did not recognise; and therefore she whom\nhe thought to be his wife was, in fact, nothing more than his\nslave.  What would have been his feelings had he known this, and\nalso known that his two daughters, Ellen and Jane, were his\nslaves?  Yet such was the fact.  After the disappearance of the\ndisease with which Henry Morton had so suddenly been removed, his\nbrother went to New Orleans to give what aid he could in settling\nup the affairs.  James Morton, on his arrival in New Orleans, felt\nproud of his nieces, and promised them a home with his own family\nin Vermont; little dreaming that his brother had married a slave\nwoman, and that his nieces were slaves.  The girls themselves had\nnever heard that their mother had been a slave, and therefore knew\nnothing of the danger hanging over their heads.  An inventory of\nthe property was made out by James Morton, and placed in the\nhands of the creditors; and the young ladies, with their uncle,\nwere about leaving the city to reside for a few days on the banks\nof Lake Pontchartrain, where they could enjoy a fresh air that\nthe city could not afford.  But just as they were about taking the\ntrain, an officer arrested the whole party; the young ladies as\nslaves, and the uncle upon the charge of attempting to conceal the\nproperty of his deceased brother.  Morton was overwhelmed with\nhorror at the idea of his nieces being claimed as slaves, and\nasked for time, that he might save them from such a fate.  He even\noffered to mortgage his little farm in Vermont for the amount\nwhich young slave women of their ages would fetch.  But the\ncreditors pleaded that they were \"an extra article,\" and would\nsell for more than common slaves; and must, therefore, be sold at\nauction.  They were given up, but neither ate nor slept,\nnor separated from each other, till they were taken into the New\nOrleans slave market, where they were offered to the highest\nbidder.  There they stood, trembling, blushing, and weeping;\ncompelled to listen to the grossest language, and shrinking from\nthe rude hands that examined the graceful proportions of their\nbeautiful frames.\n\nAfter a fierce contest between the bidders, the young ladies were\nsold, one for 2,300 dollars, and the other for 3,000 dollars.  We\nneed not add that had those young girls been sold for mere house\nservants or field hands, they would not have brought one half the\nsums they did.  The fact that they were the grand-daughters of\nThomas Jefferson, no doubt, increased their value in the market.\nHere were two of the softer sex, accustomed to the fondest\nindulgence, surrounded by all the refinements of life, and with\nall the timidity that such a life could produce, bartered away\nlike cattle in Smithfield market.  Ellen, the eldest, was sold to\nan old gentleman, who purchased her, as he said, for a\nhousekeeper.  The girl was taken to his residence, nine miles from\nthe city.  She soon, however, knew for what purpose she had been\nbought; and an educated and cultivated mind and taste, which made\nher see and understand how great was her degradation, now armed\nher hand with the ready means of death.  The morning after her\narrival, she was found in her chamber, a corpse.  She had taken\npoison.  Jane was purchased by a dashing young man, who had just\ncome into the possession of a large fortune.  The very appearance\nof the young Southerner pointed him out as an unprincipled\nprofligate; and the young girl needed no one to tell her of her\nimpending doom.  The young maid of fifteen was immediately removed\nto his country seat, near the junction of the\nMississippi river with the sea.  This was a most singular spot,\nremote, in a dense forest spreading over the summit of a cliff\nthat rose abruptly to a great height above the sea; but so grand\nin its situation, in the desolate sublimity which reigned around,\nin the reverential murmur of the waves that washed its base, that,\nthough picturesque, it was a forest prison.  Here the young lady\nsaw no one, except an old Negress who acted as her servant.  The\nsmiles with which the young man met her were indignantly spurned.\nBut she was the property of another, and could hope for justice\nand mercy only through him.\n\nJane, though only in her fifteenth year, had become strongly\nattached to Volney Lapuc, a young Frenchman, a student in her\nfather's office.  The poverty of the young man, and the youthful\nage of the girl, had caused their feelings to be kept from the\nyoung lady's parents.  At the death of his master, Volney had\nreturned to his widowed mother at Mobile, and knew nothing of the\nmisfortune that had befallen his mistress, until he received a\nletter from her.  But how could he ever obtain a sight of her,\neven if he wished, locked up as she was in her master's mansion?\nAfter several days of what her master termed \"obstinacy\" on her\npart, the young girl was placed in an upper chamber, and told\nthat that would be her home, until she should yield to her\nmaster's wishes.  There she remained more than a fortnight, and\nwith the exception of a daily visit from her master, she saw no\none but the old Negress who waited upon her.  One bright moonlight\nevening as she was seated at the window, she perceived the figure\nof a man beneath her window.  At first, she thought it was her\nmaster; but the tall figure of the stranger soon convinced her\nthat it was another.  Yes, it was Volney!  He had no sooner\nreceived her letter, than he set out for New Orleans;\nand finding on his arrival there, that his mistress had been\ntaken away, resolved to follow her.  There he was; but how could\nshe communicate with him?  She dared not trust the old Negress with\nher secret, for fear that it might reach her master.  Jane wrote a\nhasty note and threw it out of the window, which was eagerly\npicked up by the young man, and he soon disappeared in the woods.\nNight passed away in dreariness to her, and the next morning she\nviewed the spot beneath her window with the hope of seeing the\nfootsteps of him who had stood there the previous night.  Evening\nreturned, and with it the hope of again seeing the man she loved.\nIn this she was not disappointed; for daylight had scarcely\ndisappeared, and the moon once more rising through the tops of\nthe tall trees, when the young man was seen in the same place as\non the previous night.  He had in his hand a rope ladder.  As soon\nas Jane saw this, she took the sheets from her bed, tore them\ninto strings, tied them together, and let one end down the side of\nthe house.  A moment more, and one end of the rope ladder was in\nher hand, and she fastened it inside the room.  Soon the young\nmaiden was seen descending, and the enthusiastic lover, with his\narms extended, waiting to receive his mistress.  The planter had\nbeen out on an hunting excursion, and returning home, saw his\nvictim as her lover was receiving her in his arms.  At this moment\nthe sharp sound of a rifle was heard, and the young man fell\nweltering in his blood, at the feet of his mistress.  Jane fell\nsenseless by his side.  For many days she had a confused\nconsciousness of some great agony, but knew not where she was, or\nby whom surrounded.  The slow recovery of her reason settled into\nthe most intense melancholy, which gained at length the\ncompassion even of her cruel master.  The beautiful\nbright eyes, always pleading in expression, were now so\nheart-piercing in their sadness, that he could not endure their\ngaze.  In a few days the poor girl died of a broken heart, and was\nburied at night at the back of the garden by the Negroes; and no\none wept at the grave of her who had been so carefully cherished,\nand so tenderly beloved.\n\nThis, reader, is an unvarnished narrative of one doomed by the\nlaws of the Southern States to be a slave.  It tells not only its\nown story of grief, but speaks of a thousand wrongs and woes\nbeside, which never see the light; all the more bitter and\ndreadful, because no help can relieve, no sympathy can mitigate,\nand no hope can cheer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE ARREST\n\n\"The fearful storm--it threatens lowering,\n     Which God in mercy long delays;\nSlaves yet may see their masters cowering,\nWhile whole plantations smoke and blaze!\"\n\n--Carter.\n\n\nIT was late in the evening when the coach arrived at Richmond, and\nClotel once more alighted in her native city.  She had intended to\nseek lodging somewhere in the outskirts of the town, but the\nlateness of the hour compelled her to stop at one of the principal\nhotels for the night.  She had scarcely entered the inn, when she\nrecognised among the numerous black servants one to whom she was\nwell known; and her only hope was, that her disguise would keep\nher from being discovered.  The imperturbable calm and entire\nforgetfulness of self which induced Clotel to visit a place from\nwhich she could scarcely hope to escape, to attempt the rescue of\na beloved child, demonstrate that overwillingness of woman to\ncarry out the promptings of the finer feelings of her heart.  True\nto woman's nature, she had risked her own liberty for another.\n\nShe remained in the hotel during the night, and the next morning,\nunder the plea of illness, she took her breakfast alone.  That day\nthe fugitive slave paid a visit to the suburbs of the town, and\nonce more beheld the cottage in which she had spent so many happy\nhours.  It was winter, and the clematis and passion flower were\nnot there; but there were the same walks she had so\noften pressed with her feet, and the same trees which had so\noften shaded her as she passed through the garden at the back of\nthe house.  Old remembrances rushed upon her memory, and caused her\nto shed tears freely.  Clotel was now in her native town, and near\nher daughter; but how could she communicate with her?  How could\nshe see her?  To have made herself known, would have been a\nsuicidal act; betrayal would have followed, and she arrested.\nThree days had passed away, and Clotel still remained in the hotel\nat which she had first put up; and yet she had got no tidings of\nher child.  Unfortunately for Clotel, a disturbance had just\nbroken out amongst the slave population in the state of Virginia,\nand all strangers were eyed with suspicion.\n\nThe evils consequent on slavery are not lessened by the incoming\nof one or two rays of light.  If the slave only becomes aware of\nhis condition, and conscious of the injustice under which he\nsuffers, if he obtains but a faint idea of these things, he will\nseize the first opportunity to possess himself of what he\nconceives to belong to him.  The infusion of Anglo-Saxon with\nAfrican blood has created an insurrectionary feeling among the\nslaves of America hitherto unknown.  Aware of their blood\nconnection with their owners, these mulattoes labour under the\nsense of their personal and social injuries; and tolerate, if\nthey do not encourage in themselves, low and vindictive passions.\nOn the other hand, the slave owners are aware of their critical\nposition, and are ever watchful, always fearing an outbreak among\nthe slaves.\n\nTrue, the Free States are equally bound with the Slave States to\nsuppress any insurrectionary movement that may take place among\nthe slaves.  The Northern freemen are bound by their\nconstitutional obligations to aid the slaveholder in keeping his\nslaves in their chains.  Yet there are, at the time we\nwrite, four millions of bond slaves in the United States.  The\ninsurrection to which we now refer was headed by a full-blooded\nNegro, who had been born and brought up a slave.  He had heard the\ntwang of the driver's whip, and saw the warm blood streaming from\nthe Negro's body; he had witnessed the separation of parents and\nchildren, and was made aware, by too many proofs, that the slave\ncould expect no justice at the hand of the slave owner.  He went by\nthe name of \"Nat Turner.\"  He was a preacher amongst the Negroes,\nand distinguished for his eloquence, respected by the whites, and\nloved and venerated by the Negroes.  On the discovery of the plan\nfor the outbreak, Turner fled to the swamps, followed by those\nwho had joined in the insurrection.  Here the revolted Negroes\nnumbered some hundreds, and for a time bade defiance to their\noppressors.  The Dismal Swamps cover many thousands of acres of\nwild land, and a dense forest, with wild animals and insects, such\nas are unknown in any other part of Virginia.  Here runaway\nNegroes usually seek a hiding place, and some have been known to\nreside here for years.  The revolters were joined by one of these.\nHe was a large, tall, full-blooded Negro, with a stern and savage\ncountenance; the marks on his face showed that he was from one of\nthe barbarous tribes in Africa, and claimed that country as his\nnative land; his only covering was a girdle around his loins,\nmade of skins of wild beasts which he had killed; his only token\nof authority among those that he led, was a pair of epaulettes\nmade from the tail of a fox, and tied to his shoulder by a cord.\nBrought from the coast of Africa when only fifteen years of age\nto the island of Cuba, he was smuggled from thence into Virginia.\nHe had been two years in the swamps, and considered it\nhis future home.  He had met a Negro woman who was also a runaway;\nand, after the fashion of his native land, had gone through the\nprocess of oiling her as the marriage ceremony.  They had built a\ncave on a rising mound in the swamp; this was their home.  His\nname was Picquilo.  His only weapon was a sword, made from the\nblade of a scythe, which he had stolen from a neighbouring\nplantation.  His dress, his character, his manners, his mode of\nfighting, were all in keeping with the early training he had\nreceived in the land of his birth.  He moved about with the\nactivity of a cat, and neither the thickness of the trees, nor the\ndepth of the water could stop him.  He was a bold, turbulent\nspirit; and from revenge imbrued his hands in the blood of all\nthe whites he could meet.  Hunger, thirst, fatigue, and loss of\nsleep he seemed made to endure as if by peculiarity of\nconstitution.  His air was fierce, his step oblique, his look\nsanguinary.  Such was the character of one of the leaders in the\nSouthampton insurrection.  All Negroes were arrested who were\nfound beyond their master's threshhold, and all strange whites\nwatched with a great degree of alacrity.\n\nSuch was the position in which Clotel found affairs when she\nreturned to Virginia in search of her Mary.  Had not the\nslaveowners been watchful of strangers, owing to the outbreak,\nthe fugitive could not have escaped the vigilance of the police;\nfor advertisements, announcing her escape and offering a large\nreward for her arrest, had been received in the city previous to\nher arrival, and the officers were therefore on the look-out for\nthe runaway slave.  It was on the third day, as the quadroon was\nseated in her room at the inn, still in the disguise of a\ngentleman, that two of the city officers entered the room, and\ninformed her that they were authorised to examine all\nstrangers, to assure the authorities that they were not in league\nwith the revolted Negroes.  With trembling heart the fugitive\nhanded the key of her trunk to the officers.  To their surprise,\nthey found nothing but woman's apparel in the box, which raised\ntheir curiosity, and caused a further investigation that resulted\nin the arrest of Clotel as a fugitive slave.  She was immediately\nconveyed to prison, there to await the orders of her master.  For\nmany days, uncheered by the voice of kindness, alone, hopeless,\ndesolate, she waited for the time to arrive when the chains were\nto be placed on her limbs, and she returned to her inhuman and\nunfeeling owner.\n\nThe arrest of the fugitive was announced in all the newspapers,\nbut created little or no sensation.  The inhabitants were too much\nengaged in putting down the revolt among the slaves; and although\nall the odds were against the insurgents, the whites found it no\neasy matter, with all their caution.  Every day brought news of\nfresh outbreaks.  Without scruple and without pity, the whites\nmassacred all blacks found beyond their owners' plantations: the\nNegroes, in return, set fire to houses, and put those to death\nwho attempted to escape from the flames.  Thus carnage was added to\ncarnage, and the blood of the whites flowed to avenge the blood\nof the blacks.  These were the ravages of slavery.  No graves were\ndug for the Negroes; their dead bodies became food for dogs and\nvultures, and their bones, partly calcined by the sun, remained\nscattered about, as if to mark the mournful fury of servitude and\nlust of power.  When the slaves were subdued, except a few in the\nswamps, bloodhounds were put in this dismal place to hunt out the\nremaining revolters.  Among the captured Negroes was one of whom we\nshall hereafter make mention.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nDEATH IS FREEDOM\n\n        \"I asked but freedom, and ye gave\n Chains, and the freedom of the grave.\"--Snelling.\n\nTHERE are, in the district of Columbia, several slave prisons, or\n\"Negro pens,\" as they are termed.  These prisons are mostly\noccupied by persons to keep their slaves in, when collecting\ntheir gangs together for the New Orleans market.  Some of them\nbelong to the government, and one, in particular, is noted for\nhaving been the place where a number of free coloured persons\nhave been incarcerated from time to time.  In this district is\nsituated the capital of the United States.  Any free coloured\npersons visiting Washington, if not provided with papers\nasserting and proving their right to be free, may be arrested and\nplaced in one of these dens.  If they succeed in showing that they\nare free, they are set at liberty, provided they are able to pay\nthe expenses of their arrest and imprisonment; if they cannot pay\nthese expenses, they are sold out.  Through this unjust and\noppressive law, many persons born in the Free States have been\nconsigned to a life of slavery on the cotton, sugar, or rice\nplantations of the Southern States.  By order of her master,\nClotel was removed from Richmond and placed in one of these\nprisons, to await the sailing of a vessel for New Orleans.  The\nprison in which she was put stands midway between the capitol at\nWashington and the President's house.  Here the fugitive saw\nnothing but slaves brought in and taken out, to be placed in\nships and sent away to the same part of the country to\nwhich she herself would soon be compelled to go.  She had seen or\nheard nothing of her daughter while in Richmond, and all hope of\nseeing her now had fled.  If she was carried back to New Orleans,\nshe could expect no mercy from her master.\n\nAt the dusk of the evening previous to the day when she was to be\nsent off, as the old prison was being closed for the night, she\nsuddenly darted past her keeper, and ran for her life.  It is not\na great distance from the prison to the Long Bridge, which passes\nfrom the lower part of the city across the Potomac, to the\nextensive forests and woodlands of the celebrated Arlington\nPlace, occupied by that distinguished relative and descendant of\nthe immortal Washington, Mr. George W. Custis.  Thither the poor\nfugitive directed her flight.  So unexpected was her escape, that\nshe had quite a number of rods the start before the keeper had\nsecured the other prisoners, and rallied his assistants in\npursuit.  It was at an hour when, and in a part of the city where,\nhorses could not be readily obtained for the chase; no\nbloodhounds were at hand to run down the flying woman; and for\nonce it seemed as though there was to be a fair trial of speed and\nendurance between the slave and the slave-catchers.  The keeper\nand his forces raised the hue and cry on her pathway close\nbehind; but so rapid was the flight along the wide avenue, that\nthe astonished citizens, as they poured forth from their\ndwellings to learn the cause of alarm, were only able to\ncomprehend the nature of the case in time to fall in with the\nmotley mass in pursuit (as many a one did that night), to raise\nan anxious prayer to heaven, as they refused to join in the\npursuit, that the panting fugitive might escape, and the\nmerciless soul dealer for once be disappointed of his prey.  And\nnow with the speed of an arrow--having passed the\navenue--with the distance between her and her pursuers constantly\nincreasing, this poor hunted female gained the \"Long Bridge,\" as\nit is called, where interruption seemed improbable, and already\ndid her heart begin to beat high with the hope of success.  She\nhad only to pass three-fourths of a mile across the bridge, and\nshe could bury herself in a vast forest, just at the time when\nthe curtain of night would close around her, and protect her from\nthe pursuit of her enemies.\n\nBut God by his Providence had otherwise determined.  He had\ndetermined that an appalling tragedy should be enacted that\nnight, within plain sight of the President's house and the\ncapitol of the Union, which should be an evidence wherever it\nshould be known, of the unconquerable love of liberty the heart\nmay inherit; as well as a fresh admonition to the slave dealer,\nof the cruelty and enormity of his crimes.  Just as the pursuers\ncrossed the high draw for the passage of sloops, soon after\nentering upon the bridge, they beheld three men slowly\napproaching from the Virginia side.  They immediately called to\nthem to arrest the fugitive, whom they proclaimed a runaway\nslave.  True to their Virginian instincts as she came near, they\nformed in line across the narrow bridge, and prepared to seize\nher.  Seeing escape impossible in that quarter, she stopped\nsuddenly, and turned upon her pursuers.  On came the profane and\nribald crew, faster than ever, already exulting in her capture,\nand threatening punishment for her flight.  For a moment she\nlooked wildly and anxiously around to see if there was no hope of\nescape.  On either hand, far down below, rolled the deep foamy\nwaters of the Potomac, and before and behind the rapidly\napproaching step and noisy voices of pursuers, showing\nhow vain would be any further effort for freedom.  Her resolution\nwas taken.  She clasped her hands convulsively, and raised them, as\nshe at the same time raised her eyes towards heaven, and begged\nfor that mercy and compassion there, which had been denied her on\nearth; and then, with a single bound, she vaulted over the\nrailings of the bridge, and sunk for ever beneath the waves of\nthe river!\n\nThus died Clotel, the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, a president of\nthe United States; a man distinguished as the author of the\nDeclaration of American Independence, and one of the first\nstatesmen of that country.\n\nHad Clotel escaped from oppression in any other land, in the\ndisguise in which she fled from the Mississippi to Richmond, and\nreached the United States, no honour within the gift of the\nAmerican people would have been too good to have been heaped upon\nthe heroic woman.  But she was a slave, and therefore out of the\npale of their sympathy.  They have tears to shed over Greece and\nPoland; they have an abundance of sympathy for \"poor Ireland\";\nthey can furnish a ship of war to convey the Hungarian refugees\nfrom a Turkish prison to the \"land of the free and home of the\nbrave.\"  They boast that America is the \"cradle of liberty\"; if it\nis, I fear they have rocked the child to death.  The body of\nClotel was picked up from the bank of the river, where it had been\nwashed by the strong current, a hole dug in the sand, and there\ndeposited, without either inquest being held over it, or\nreligious service being performed.  Such was the life and such the\ndeath of a woman whose virtues and goodness of heart would have\ndone honour to one in a higher station of life, and who, if she\nhad been born in any other land but that of slavery, would have\nbeen honoured and loved.  A few days after the death of Clotel,\nthe following poem appeared in one of the newspapers:\n\n\"Now, rest for the wretched! the long day is past,\n   And night on yon prison descendeth at last.\n  Now lock up and bolt!  Ha, jailor, look there!\nWho flies like a wild bird escaped from the snare?\n       A woman, a slave-up, out in pursuit.\n         While linger some gleams of day!\n     Let thy call ring out!--now a rabble rout\n           Is at thy heels--speed away!\n\n\n   \"A bold race for freedom!--On, fugitive, on!\nHeaven help but the right, and thy freedom is won.\n How eager she drinks the free air of the plains;\nEvery limb, every nerve, every fibre she strains;\n        From Columbia's glorious capitol,\n            Columbia's daughter flees\n         To the sanctuary God has given--\n           The sheltering forest trees.\n\n\n\"Now she treads the Long Bridge--joy lighteth her eye--\n     Beyond her the dense wood and darkening sky--\nWild hopes thrill her heart as she neareth the shore:\n   O, despair! there are men fast advancing before!\n Shame, shame on their manhood! they hear, they heed\n             The cry, her flight to stay,\n  And like demon forms with their outstretched arms,\n            They wait to seize their prey!\n\n\n \"She pauses, she turns!

At first the young girl was treated\nwith great severity; but after finding that Horatio Green had\nlost all feeling for his child, Mrs. Green's own heart became\ntouched for the offspring of her husband, and she became its\nfriend.  Mary had grown still more beautiful, and, like most of\nher sex in that country, was fast coming to maturity.\n\nThe arrest of Clotel, while trying to rescue her daughter, did not\nreach the ears of the latter till her mother had been removed\nfrom Richmond to Washington.  The mother had passed from time to\neternity before the daughter knew that she had been in the\nneighbourhood.  Horatio Green was not in Richmond at the time of\nClotel's arrest; had he been there, it is not probable but he\nwould have made an effort to save her.  She was not his slave, and\ntherefore was beyond his power, even had he been there and\ninclined to aid her.  The revolt amongst the slaves had been\nbrought to an end, and most of the insurgents either put to death\nor sent out of the state.  One, however, remained in\nprison.  He was the slave of Horatio Green, and had been a servant\nin his master's dwelling.  He, too, could boast that his father\nwas an American statesman.  His name was George.  His mother had\nbeen employed as a servant in one of the principal hotels in\nWashington, where members of Congress usually put up.  After\nGeorge's birth his mother was sold to a slave trader, and he to an\nagent of Mr. Green, the father of Horatio.  George was as white as\nmost white persons.  No one would suppose that any African blood\ncoursed through his veins.  His hair was straight, soft, fine, and\nlight; his eyes blue, nose prominent, lips thin, his head well\nformed, forehead high and prominent; and he was often taken for a\nfree white person by those who did know him.  This made his\ncondition still more intolerable; for one so white seldom ever\nreceives fair treatment at the hands of his fellow slaves; and the\nwhites usually regard such slaves as persons who, if not often\nflogged, and otherwise ill treated, to remind them of their\ncondition, would soon \"forget\" that they were slaves, and \"think\nthemselves as good as white folks.\"  George's opportunities were\nfar greater than most slaves.  Being in his master's house, and\nwaiting on educated white people, he had become very familiar\nwith the English language.  He had heard his master and visitors\nspeak of the down-trodden and oppressed Poles; he heard them talk\nof going to Greece to fight for Grecian liberty, and against the\noppressors of that ill-fated people.  George, fired with the love\nof freedom, and zeal for the cause of his enslaved countrymen,\njoined the insurgents, and with them had been defeated and\ncaptured.  He was the only one remaining of these unfortunate\npeople, and he would have been put to death with them but for a\ncircumstance that occurred some weeks before the\noutbreak.  The court house had, by accident, taken fire, and was\nfast consuming.  The engines could not be made to work, and all\nhope of saving the building seemed at an end.  In one of the upper\nchambers there was a small box containing some valuable deeds\nbelonging to the city; a ladder was placed against the house,\nleading from the street to the window of the room in which the\nbox stood.  The wind blew strong, and swept the flames in that\ndirection.  Broad sheets of fire were blown again and again over\nthat part of the building, and then the wind would lift the pall\nof smoke, which showed that the work of destruction was not yet\naccomplished.  While the doomed building was thus exposed, and\nbefore the destroying element had made its final visit, as it did\nsoon after, George was standing by, and hearing that much\ndepended on the contents of the box, and seeing no one disposed\nto venture through the fiery element to save the treasure,\nmounted the ladder and made his way to the window, entered the\nroom, and was soon seen descending with the much valued box.  Three\ncheers rent the air as the young slave fell from the ladder when\nnear the ground; the white men took him up in their arms, to see\nif he had sustained any injury.  His hair was burnt, eyebrows\nclosely singed, and his clothes smelt strongly of smoke; but the\nheroic young slave was unhurt.  The city authorities, at their\nnext meeting, passed a vote of thanks to George's master for the\nlasting benefit that the slave had rendered the public, and\ncommanded the poor boy to the special favour of his owner.  When\nGeorge was on trial for participating in the revolt, this\n\"meritorious act,\" as they were pleased to term it, was brought\nup in his favour.  His trial was put off from session to session,\ntill he had been in prison more than a year.  At last, however, he\nwas convicted of high treason, and sentenced to be\nhanged within ten days of that time.  The judge asked the slave if\nhe had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed\non him.  George stood for a moment in silence, and then said, \"As\nI cannot speak as I should wish, I will say nothing.\"  \"You may\nsay what you please,\" said the judge.  \"You had a good master,\"\ncontinued he, \"and still you were dissatisfied; you left your\nmaster and joined the Negroes who were burning our houses and\nkilling our wives.\"  \"As you have given me permission to speak,\"\nremarked George, \"I will tell you why I joined the revolted\nNegroes.  I have heard my master read in the Declaration of\nIndependence 'that all men are created free and equal,' and this\ncaused me to inquire of myself why I was a slave.  I also heard him\ntalking with some of his visitors about the war with England, and\nhe said, all wars and fightings for freedom were just and right.\nIf so, in what am I wrong?  The grievances of which your fathers\ncomplained, and which caused the Revolutionary War, were trifling\nin comparison with the wrongs and sufferings of those who were\nengaged in the late revolt.  Your fathers were never slaves, ours\nare; your fathers were never bought and sold like cattle, never\nshut out from the light of knowledge and religion, never\nsubjected to the lash of brutal task-masters.  For the crime of\nhaving a dark skin, my people suffer the pangs of hunger, the\ninfliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude.  We\nare kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make\nour instruction a criminal offence.  What right has one man to the\nbones, sinews, blood, and nerves of another?  Did not one God make\nus all?  You say your fathers fought for freedom; so did we.  You\ntell me that I am to be put to death for violating the\nlaws of the land.  Did not the American revolutionists violate the\nlaws when they struck for liberty?  They were revolters, but their\nsuccess made them patriots--We were revolters, and our failure\nmakes us rebels.  Had we succeeded, we would have been patriots\ntoo.  Success makes all the difference.  You make merry on the 4th\nof July; the thunder of cannon and ringing of bells announce it\nas the birthday of American independence.  Yet while these cannons\nare roaring and bells ringing, one-sixth of the people of this\nland are in chains and slavery.  You boast that this is the 'Land\nof the Free'; but a traditionary freedom will not save you.  It\nwill not do to praise your fathers and build their sepulchres.\nWorse for you that you have such an inheritance, if you spend it\nfoolishly and are unable to appreciate its worth.  Sad if the\ngenius of a true humanity, beholding you with tearful eyes from\nthe mount of vision, shall fold his wings in sorrowing pity, and\nrepeat the strain, 'O land of Washington, how often would I have\ngathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood\nunder her wings, and ye would not; behold your house is left unto\nyou desolate.'  This is all I have to say; I have done.\"  Nearly\nevery one present was melted to tears; even the judge seemed\ntaken by surprise at the intelligence of the young slave.  But\nGeorge was a slave, and an example must be made of him, and\ntherefore he was sentenced.  Being employed in the same house with\nMary, the daughter of Clotel, George had become attached to her,\nand the young lovers fondly looked forward to the time when they\nshould be husband and wife.\n\nAfter George had been sentenced to death, Mary was still more\nattentive to him, and begged and obtained leave of her mistress\nto visit him in his cell.  The poor girl paid a daily\nvisit to him to whom she had pledged her heart and hand.  At one of\nthese meetings, and only four days from the time fixed for the\nexecution, while Mary was seated in George's cell, it occurred to\nher that she might yet save him from a felon's doom.  She revealed\nto him the secret that was then occupying her thoughts, viz.\nthat George should exchange clothes with her, and thus attempt his\nescape in disguise.  But he would not for a single moment listen\nto the proposition.  Not that he feared detection; but he would\nnot consent to place an innocent and affectionate girl in a\nposition where she might have to suffer for him.  Mary pleaded,\nbut in vain.  George was inflexible.  The poor girl left her lover\nwith a heavy heart, regretting that her scheme had proved\nunsuccessful.\n\nTowards the close of the next day, Mary again appeared at the\nprison door for admission, and was soon by the side of him whom\nshe so ardently loved.  While there the clouds which had overhung\nthe city for some hours broke, and the rain fell in torrents amid\nthe most terrific thunder and lightning.  In the most persuasive\nmanner possible, Mary again importuned George to avail himself of\nher assistance to escape from an ignominious death.  After assuring\nhim that she, not being the person condemned, would not receive\nany injury, he at last consented, and they began to exchange\napparel.  As George was of small stature, and both were white,\nthere was no difficulty in his passing out without detection; and\nas she usually left the cell weeping, with handkerchief in hand,\nand sometimes at her face, he had only to adopt this mode and his\nescape was safe.  They had kissed each other, and Mary had told\nGeorge where he would find a small parcel of provisions which she\nhad placed in a secluded spot, when the prison-keeper\nopened the door and said, \"Come, girl, it is time for you to go.\"\nGeorge again embraced Mary, and passed out of the jail.  It was\nalready dark, and the street lamps were lighted, so that our hero\nin his new dress had no dread of detection.  The provisions were\nsought out and found, and poor George was soon on the road\ntowards Canada.  But neither of them had once thought of a change\nof dress for George when he should have escaped, and he had\nwalked but a short distance before he felt that a change of his\napparel would facilitate his progress.  But he dared not go amongst\neven his coloured associates for fear of being betrayed.  However,\nhe made the best of his way on towards Canada, hiding in the\nwoods during the day, and travelling by the guidance of the North\nStar at night.\n\nWith the poet he could truly say,\n\n  \"Star of the North! while blazing day\n  Pours round me its full tide of light,\n   And hides thy pale but faithful ray,\n  I, too, lie hid, and long for night.\"\n\nOne morning, George arrived on the banks of the Ohio river, and\nfound his journey had terminated, unless he could get some one to\ntake him across the river in a secret manner, for he would not be\npermitted to cross in any of the ferry boats, it being a penalty\nfor crossing a slave, besides the value of the slave.  He\nconcealed himself in the tall grass and weeds near the river, to\nsee if he could embrace an opportunity to cross.  He had been in\nhis hiding place but a short time, when he observed a man in a\nsmall boat, floating near the shore, evidently fishing.  His first\nimpulse was to call out to the man and ask him to take him over\nto the Ohio side, but the fear that the man was a slaveholder, or\none who might possibly arrest him, deterred him from it.  The\nman after rowing and floating about for some time\nfastened the boat to the root of a tree, and started to a\nneighbouring farmhouse.\n\nThis was George's moment, and he seized it.  Running down the bank,\nhe unfastened the boat, jumped in, and with all the expertness of\none accustomed to a boat, rowed across the river and landed on\nthe Ohio side.\n\nBeing now in a Free State, he thought he might with perfect safety\ntravel on towards Canada.  He had, however, gone but a very few\nmiles when he discovered two men on horseback coming behind him.\nHe felt sure that they could not be in pursuit of him, yet he did\nnot wish to be seen by them, so he turned into another road\nleading to a house near by.  The men followed, and were but a\nshort distance from George, when he ran up to a farmhouse, before\nwhich was standing a farmer-looking man, in a broad-brimmed hat\nand straight-collared coat, whom he implored to save him from the\n\"slave-catchers.\"  The farmer told him to go into the barn near\nby; he entered by the front door, the farmer following, and\nclosing the door behind George, but remaining outside, and gave\ndirections to his hired man as to what should be done with\nGeorge.  The slaveholders by this time had dismounted, and were\nin front of the barn demanding admittance, and charging the\nfarmer with secreting their slave woman, for George was still in\nthe dress of a woman.  The Friend, for the farmer proved to be a\nmember of the Society of Friends, told the slave-owners that if\nthey wished to search his barn, they must first get an officer\nand a search warrant.  While the parties were disputing, the farmer\nbegan nailing up the front door, and the hired man served the\nback door in the same way.  The slaveholders, finding that they\ncould not prevail on the Friend to allow them to get the slave,\ndetermined to go in search of an officer.  One was left\nto see that the slave did not escape from the barn, while the\nother went off at full speed to Mount Pleasant, the nearest town.\nGeorge was not the slave of either of these men, nor were they in\npursuit of him, but they had lost a woman who had been seen in\nthat vicinity, and when they saw poor George in the disguise of a\nfemale, and attempting to elude pursuit, they felt sure they were\nclose upon their victim.  However, if they had caught him,\nalthough he was not their slave, they would have taken him back\nand placed him in jail, and there he would have remained until his\nowner arrived.\n\nAfter an absence of nearly two hours, the slave-owner returned\nwith an officer and found the Friend still driving large nails\ninto the door.  In a triumphant tone and with a corresponding\ngesture, he handed the search-warrant to the Friend, and said,\n\"There, sir, now I will see if I can't get my nigger.\"  \"Well,\"\nsaid the Friend, \"thou hast gone to work according to law, and\nthou canst now go into my barn.\"  \"Lend me your hammer that I may\nget the door open,\" said the slaveholder.  \"Let me see the warrant\nagain.\"  And after reading it over once more, he said, \"I see\nnothing in this paper which says I must supply thee with tools to\nopen my door; if thou wishest to go in, thou must get a hammer\nelsewhere.\"  The sheriff said, \"I will go to a neighbouring farm\nand borrow something which will introduce us to Miss Dinah;\" and\nhe immediately went in search of tools.  In a short time the\nofficer returned, and they commenced an assault and battery upon\nthe barn door, which soon yielded; and in went the slaveholder\nand officer, and began turning up the hay and using all other\nmeans to find the lost property; but, to their astonishment, the\nslave was not there.  After all hope of getting Dinah was gone,\nthe slave-owner in a rage said to the Friend, \"My nigger\nis not here.\"  \"I did not tell thee there was any one here.\"  \"Yes,\nbut I saw her go in, and you shut the door behind her, and if she\nwas not in the barn, what did you nail the door for?\"  \"Can't I do\nwhat I please with my own barn door?  Now I will tell thee; thou\nneed trouble thyself no more, for the person thou art after\nentered the front door and went out at the back door, and is a\nlong way from here by this time.  Thou and thy friend must be\nsomewhat fatigued by this time; won't thou go in and take a little\ndinner with me?\"  We need not say that this cool invitation of the\ngood Quaker was not accepted by the slaveholders.  George in the\nmeantime had been taken to a friend's dwelling some miles away,\nwhere, after laying aside his female attire, and being snugly\ndressed up in a straight collared coat, and pantaloons to match,\nwas again put on the right road towards Canada.\n\nThe fugitive now travelled by day, and laid by during night.  After\na fatiguing and dreary journey of two weeks, the fugitive arrived\nin Canada, and took up his abode in the little town of St.\nCatherine's, and obtained work on the farm of Colonel Street.  Here\nhe attended a night-school, and laboured for his employer during\nthe day.  The climate was cold, and wages small, yet he was in a\nland where he was free, and this the young slave prized more than\nall the gold that could be given to him.  Besides doing his best\nto obtain education for himself, he imparted what he could to\nthose of his fellow-fugitives about him, of whom there were many.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE MYSTERY\n\nGEORGE, however, did not forget his promise to use all the means\nin his power to get Mary out of slavery.  He, therefore, laboured\nwith all his might to obtain money with which to employ some one\nto go back to Virginia for Mary.  After nearly six months' labour\nat St. Catherine's, he employed an English missionary to go and\nsee if the girl could be purchased, and at what price.  The\nmissionary went accordingly, but returned with the sad\nintelligence that, on account of Mary's aiding George to escape,\nthe court had compelled Mr. Green to sell her out of the state,\nand she had been sold to a Negro trader, and taken to the New\nOrleans market.  As all hope of getting the girl was now gone,\nGeorge resolved to quit the American continent for ever.  He\nimmediately took passage in a vessel laden with timber, bound for\nLiverpool, and in five weeks from that time he was standing on\nthe quay of the great English seaport.  With little or no\neducation, he found many difficulties in the way of getting a\nrespectable living.  However he obtained a situation as porter in\na large house in Manchester, where he worked during the day, and\ntook private lessons at night.  In this way he laboured for three\nyears, and was then raised to the situation of clerk.  George was\nso white as easily to pass for a white man, and being somewhat\nashamed of his African descent, he never once mentioned the fact\nof his having been a slave.  He soon became a partner in\nthe firm that employed him, and was now on the road to wealth.\n\nIn the year 1842, just ten years after George Green (for he\nadopted his master's name) arrived in England, he visited France,\nand spent some days at Dunkirk.  It was towards sunset, on a warm\nday in the month of October, that Mr. Green, after strolling some\ndistance from the Hotel de Leon, entered a burial ground, and\nwandered along, alone among the silent dead, gazing upon the many\ngreen graves and marble tombstones of those who once moved on the\ntheatre of busy life, and whose sounds of gaiety once fell upon\nthe ear of man.  All nature around was hushed in silence, and\nseemed to partake of the general melancholy which hung over the\nquiet resting-place of departed mortals.  After tracing the varied\ninscriptions which told the characters or conditions of the\ndeparted, and viewing the mounds beneath which the dust of\nmortality slumbered, he had now reached a secluded spot, near to\nwhere an aged weeping willow bowed its thick foliage to the\nground, as though anxious to hide from the scrutinising gaze of\ncuriosity the grave beneath it.  Mr. Green seated himself upon a\nmarble tomb, and began to read Roscoe's Leo X., a copy of which\nhe had under his arm.  It was then about twilight, and he had\nscarcely gone through half a page, when he observed a lady in\nblack, leading a boy, some five years old, up one of the paths;\nand as the lady's black veil was over her face, he felt somewhat\nat liberty to eye her more closely.  While looking at her, the\nlady gave a scream, and appeared to be in a fainting position,\nwhen Mr. Green sprang from his seat in time to save her from\nfalling to the ground.  At this moment, an elderly gentleman was\nseen approaching with a rapid step, who, from his appearance, was\nevidently the lady's father, or one intimately connected with\nher.  He came up, and, in a confused manner, asked what\nwas the matter.  Mr. Green explained as well as he could.  After\ntaking up the smelling bottle which had fallen from her hand, and\nholding it a short time to her face, she soon began to revive.\nDuring all this time the lady's veil had so covered her face, that\nMr. Green had not seen it.  When she had so far recovered as to be\nable to raise her head, she again screamed, and fell back into\nthe arms of the old man.  It now appeared quite certain, that\neither the countenance of George Green, or some other object, was\nthe cause of these fits of fainting; and the old gentleman,\nthinking it was the former, in rather a petulant tone said, \"I\nwill thank you, sir, if you will leave us alone.\"  The child whom\nthe lady was leading, had now set up a squall; and amid the\ndeath-like appearance of the lady, the harsh look of the old man,\nand the cries of the boy, Mr. Green left the grounds, and\nreturned to his hotel.\n\nWhilst seated by the window, and looking out upon the crowded\nstreet, with every now and then the strange scene in the\ngrave-yard vividly before him, Mr. Green thought of the book he\nhad been reading, and, remembering that he had left it on the\ntomb, where he had suddenly dropped it when called to the\nassistance of the lady, he immediately determined to return in\nsearch of it.  After a walk of some twenty minutes, he was again\nover the spot where he had been an hour before, and from which he\nhad been so unceremoniously expelled by the old man.  He looked in\nvain for the book; it was nowhere to be found: nothing save the\nbouquet which the lady had dropped, and which lay half-buried in\nthe grass from having been trodden upon, indicated that any one\nhad been there that evening.  Mr. Green took up the\nbunch of flowers, and again returned to the hotel.\n\nAfter passing a sleepless night, and hearing the clock strike six,\nhe dropped into a sweet sleep, from which he did not awaken until\nroused by the rap of a servant, who, entering his room, handed\nhim a note which ran as follows:--\"Sir,--I owe you an apology for\nthe inconvenience to which you were subjected last evening, and\nif you will honour us with your presence to dinner to-day at four\no'clock, I shall be most happy to give you due satisfaction.  My\nservant will be in waiting for you at half-past three.  I am,\nsir, your obedient servant, J. Devenant.  October 23.  To George\nGreen, Esq.\"\n\nThe servant who handed this note to Mr. Green, informed him that\nthe bearer was waiting for a reply.  He immediately resolved to\naccept the invitation, and replied accordingly.  Who this person\nwas, and how his name and the hotel where he was stopping had been\nfound out, was indeed a mystery.  However, he waited impatiently\nfor the hour when he was to see this new acquaintance, and get\nthe mysterious meeting in the grave-yard solved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE HAPPY MEETING\n\n  \"Man's love is of man's life, a thing apart;\n      'Tis woman's whole existence.\"--Byron.\n\nTHE clock on a neighbouring church had scarcely ceased striking\nthree, when the servant announced that a carriage had called for\nMr. Green.  In less than half an hour he was seated in a most\nsumptuous barouche, drawn by two beautiful iron greys, and\nrolling along over a splendid gravel road completely shaded by\nlarge trees, which appeared to have been the accumulating growth\nof many centuries.  The carriage soon stopped in front of a low\nvilla, and this too was embedded in magnificent trees covered\nwith moss.  Mr. Green alighted and was shown into a superb drawing\nroom, the walls of which were hung with fine specimens from the\nhands of the great Italian painters, and one by a German artist\nrepresenting a beautiful monkish legend connected with \"The Holy\nCatherine,\" an illustrious lady of Alexandria.  The furniture had\nan antique and dignified appearance.  High backed chairs stood\naround the room; a venerable mirror stood on the mantle shelf;\nrich curtains of crimson damask hung in folds at either side of\nthe large windows; and a rich Turkey carpet covered the floor.\nIn the centre stood a table covered with books, in the midst of\nwhich was an old-fashioned vase filled with fresh flowers, whose\nfragrance was exceedingly pleasant.  A faint light, together with\nthe quietness of the hour, gave beauty beyond description to the\nwhole scene.\n\nMr. Green had scarcely seated himself upon the sofa, when the\nelderly gentleman whom he had met the previous evening made his\nappearance, followed by the little boy, and introduced himself as\nMr. Devenant.  A moment more, and a lady--a beautiful\nbrunette--dressed in black, with long curls of a chestnut colour\nhanging down her cheeks, entered the room.  Her eyes were of a\ndark hazel, and her whole appearance indicated that she was a\nnative of a southern clime.  The door at which she entered was\nopposite to where the two gentlemen were seated.  They immediately\nrose; and Mr. Devenant was in the act of introducing her to Mr.\nGreen, when he observed that the latter had sunk back upon the\nsofa, and the last word that he remembered to have heard was, \"It\nis her.\"  After this, all was dark and dreamy: how long he\nremained in this condition it was for another to tell.  When he\nawoke, he found himself stretched upon the sofa, with his boots\noff, his neckerchief removed, shirt collar unbuttoned, and his\nhead resting upon a pillow.  By his side sat the old man, with the\nsmelling bottle in the one hand, and a glass of water in the\nother, and the little boy standing at the foot of the sofa.  As\nsoon as Mr. Green had so far recovered as to be able to speak, he\nsaid, \"Where am I, and what does this mean?\"  \"Wait a while,\"\nreplied the old man, \"and I will tell you all.\"  After a lapse of\nsome ten minutes he rose from the sofa, adjusted his apparel, and\nsaid, \"I am now ready to hear anything you have to say.\"  \"You\nwere born in America?\" said the old man.  \"Yes,\" he replied.  \"And\nyou were acquainted with a girl named Mary?\" continued the old\nman.  \"Yes, and I loved her as I can love none other.\"  \"The lady\nwhom you met so mysteriously last evening is Mary,\"\nreplied Mr. Devenant.  George Green was silent, but the fountains\nof mingled grief and joy stole out from beneath his eyelashes,\nand glistened like pearls upon his pale and marble-like cheeks.  At\nthis juncture the lady again entered the room.  Mr. Green sprang\nfrom the sofa, and they fell into each other's arms, to the\nsurprise of the old man and little George, and to the amusement\nof the servants who had crept up one by one, and were hid behind\nthe doors, or loitering in the hall.  When they had given vent to\ntheir feelings, they resumed their seats, and each in turn\nrelated the adventures through which they had passed.  \"How did\nyou find out my name and address?\" asked Mr. Green.  \"After you had\nleft us in the grave-yard, our little George said, 'O, mamma, if\nthere aint a book!' and picked it up and brought it to us.  Papa\nopened it, and said, 'The gentleman's name is written in it, and\nhere is a card of the Hotel de Leon, where I suppose he is\nstopping.'  Papa wished to leave the book, and said it was all a\nfancy of mine that I had ever seen you before, but I was\nperfectly convinced that you were my own George Green.  Are you\nmarried?\"  \"No, I am not.\"  \"Then, thank God!\" exclaimed Mrs.\nDevenant.  \"And are you single now?\" inquired Mr. Green.  \"Yes,\"\nshe replied.  \"This is indeed the Lord's doings,\" said Mr. Green,\nat the same time bursting into a flood of tears.  Mr. Devenant was\npast the age when men should think upon matrimonial subjects, yet\nthe scene brought vividly before his eyes the days when he was a\nyoung man, and had a wife living.  After a short interview, the\nold man called their attention to the dinner, which was then\nwaiting.  We need scarcely add, that Mr. Green and Mrs. Devenant\ndid very little towards diminishing the dinner that day.\n\nAfter dinner the lovers (for such we have to call them) gave their\nexperience from the time that George left the jail dressed in\nMary's clothes.  Up to that time Mr. Green's was substantially as\nwe have related it.  Mrs. Devenant's was as follows:--\"The night\nafter you left the prison,\" said she, \"I did not shut my eyes in\nsleep.  The next morning, about eight o'clock, Peter the gardener\ncame to the jail to see if I had been there the night before, and\nwas informed that I had, and that I had left a little after dark.\nAbout an hour after, Mr. Green came himself, and I need not say\nthat he was much surprised on finding me there, dressed in your\nclothes.  This was the first tidings they had of your escape.\"\n\"What did Mr. Green say when he found that I had fled?\"  \"Oh!\"\ncontinued Mrs. Devenant, \"he said to me when no one was near, I\nhope George will get off, but I fear you will have to suffer in\nhis stead.  I told him that if it must be so I was willing to die\nif you could live.\"  At this moment George Green burst into tears,\nthrew his arms around her neck, and exclaimed, \"I am glad I have\nwaited so long, with the hope of meeting you again.\"  Mrs.\nDevenant again resumed her story:--\"I was kept in jail three days,\nduring which time I was visited by the magistrates, and two of the\njudges.  On the third day I was taken out, and master told me that\nI was liberated, upon condition that I should be immediately sent\nout of the state.  There happened to be just at the time in the\nneighbourhood a Negro-trader, and he purchased me, and I was taken\nto New Orleans.  On the steamboat we were kept in a close room,\nwhere slaves are usually confined, so that I saw nothing of the\npassengers on board, or the towns we passed.  We arrived at New\nOrleans, and were all put into the slave-market for sale.  I was\nexamined by many persons, but none seemed willing to\npurchase me, as all thought me too white, and said I would run\naway and pass as a free white woman.  On the second day, while in\nthe slave-market, and while planters and others were examining\nslaves and making their purchases, I observed a tall young man,\nwith long black hair, eyeing me very closely, and then talking to\nthe trader.  I felt sure that my time had now come, but the day\nclosed without my being sold.  I did not regret this, for I had\nheard that foreigners made the worst of masters, and I felt\nconfident that the man who eyed me so closely was not an\nAmerican.\n\n\"The next day was the Sabbath.  The bells called the people to the\ndifferent places of worship.  Methodists sang, and Baptists\nimmersed, and Presbyterians sprinkled, and Episcopalians read\ntheir prayers, while the ministers of the various sects preached\nthat Christ died for all; yet there were some twenty-five or\nthirty of us poor creatures confined in the 'Negro Pen,'\nawaiting the close of the holy Sabbath, and the dawn of another\nday, to be again taken into the market, there to be examined like\nso many beasts of burden.  I need not tell you with what anxiety\nwe waited for the advent of another day.  On Monday we were again\nbrought out and placed in rows to be inspected; and, fortunately\nfor me, I was sold before we had been on the stand an hour.  I was\npurchased by a gentleman residing in the city, for a waiting-maid\nfor his wife, who was just on the eve of starting for Mobile, to\npay a visit to a near relation.  I was then dressed to suit the\nsituation of a maid-servant; and upon the whole, I thought that,\nin my new dress, I looked as much the lady as my mistress.\n\n\"On the passage to Mobile, who should I see among the passengers\nbut the tall, long-haired man that had eyed me so closely in the\nslave-market a few days before.  His eyes were again on\nme, and he appeared anxious to speak to me, and I as reluctant to\nbe spoken to.  The first evening after leaving New Orleans, soon\nafter twilight had let her curtain down, and pinned it with a\nstar, and while I was seated on the deck of the boat near the\nladies' cabin, looking upon the rippled waves, and the reflection\nof the moon upon the sea, all at once I saw the tall young man\nstanding by my side.  I immediately rose from my seat, and was in\nthe act of returning to the cabin, when he in a broken accent\nsaid, 'Stop a moment; I wish to have a word with you.  I am your\nfriend.'  I stopped and looked him full in the face, and he said,\n'I saw you some days since in the slavemarket, and I intended to\nhave purchased you to save you from the condition of a slave.  I\ncalled on Monday, but you had been sold and had left the market.\nI inquired and learned who the purchaser was, and that you had to\ngo to Mobile, so I resolved to follow you.  If you are willing I\nwill try and buy you from your present owner, and you shall be\nfree.'  Although this was said in an honest and off-hand manner, I\ncould not believe the man to be sincere in what he said.  'Why\nshould you wish to set me free?' I asked.  'I had an only sister,'\nhe replied, 'who died three years ago in France, and you are so\nmuch like her that had I not known of her death, I would most\ncertainly have taken you for her.'  'However much I may resemble\nyour sister, you are aware that I am not her, and why take so\nmuch interest in one whom you never saw before?'  'The love,' said\nhe, 'which I had for my sister is transferred to you.'  I had all\nalong suspected that the man was a knave, and this profession of\nlove confirmed me in my former belief, and I turned away and left\nhim.\n\n\"The next day, while standing in the cabin and looking\nthrough the window, the French gentleman (for such he was) came\nto the window while walking on the guards, and again commenced as\non the previous evening.  He took from his pocket a bit of paper\nand put it into my hand, at the same time saying, 'Take this, it\nmay some day be of service to you; remember it is from a friend,'\nand left me instantly.  I unfolded the paper, and found it to be a\n100 dollars bank note, on the United States Branch Bank, at\nPhiladelphia.  My first impulse was to give it to my mistress, but,\nupon a second thought, I resolved to seek an opportunity, and to\nreturn the hundred dollars to the stranger.\n\n\"Therefore I looked for him, but in vain; and had almost given up\nthe idea of seeing him again, when he passed me on the guards of\nthe boat and walked towards the stem of the vessel.  It being now\ndark, I approached him and offered the money to him.  He declined,\nsaying at the same time, 'I gave it to you keep it.'  'I do not\nwant it,' I said.  'Now,' said he, 'you had better give your\nconsent for me to purchase you, and you shall go with me to\nFrance.'  'But you cannot buy me now,' I replied, 'for my master is\nin New Orleans, and he purchased me not to sell, but to retain in\nhis own family.'  'Would you rather remain with your present\nmistress than be free?'  'No,' said I.  'Then fly with me tonight;\nwe shall be in Mobile in two hours from this, and when the\npassengers are going on shore, you can take my arm, and you can\nescape unobserved.  The trader who brought you to New Orleans\nexhibited to me a certificate of your good character, and one from\nthe minister of the church to which you were attached in\nVirginia; and upon the faith of these assurances, and the love I\nbear you, I promise before high heaven that I will marry you as\nsoon as it can be done.'  This solemn promise, coupled\nwith what had already transpired, gave me confidence in the man;\nand rash as the act may seem, I determined in an instant to go\nwith him.  My mistress had been put under the charge of the\ncaptain; and as it would be past ten o'clock when the steamer\nwould land, she accepted an invitation of the captain to remain\non board with several other ladies till morning.  I dressed myself\nin my best clothes, and put a veil over my face, and was ready on\nthe landing of the boat.  Surrounded by a number of passengers, we\ndescended the stage leading to the wharf, and were soon lost in\nthe crowd that thronged the quay.  As we went on shore we\nencountered several persons announcing the names of hotels, the\nstarting of boats for the interior, and vessels bound for Europe.\nAmong these was the ship Utica, Captain Pell, bound for Havre.\n'Now,' said Mr. Devenant, 'this is our chance.'  The ship was to\nsail at twelve o'clock that night, at high tide; and following\nthe men who were seeking passengers, we went immediately on\nboard.  Devenant told the captain of the ship that I was his\nsister, and for such we passed during the voyage.  At the hour of\ntwelve the Utica set sail, and we were soon out at sea.\n\n\"The morning after we left Mobile, Devenant met me as I came from\nmy state-room, and embraced me for the first time.  I loved him,\nbut it was only that affection which we have for one who has done\nus a lasting favour: it was the love of gratitude rather than that\nof the heart.  We were five weeks on the sea, and yet the passage\ndid not seem long, for Devenant was so kind.  On our arrival at\nHavre we were married and came to Dunkirk, and I have resided\nhere ever since.\"\n\nAt the close of this narrative, the clock struck ten, when the old\nman, who was accustomed to retire at an early hour,\nrose to take leave, saying at the same time, \"I hope you will\nremain with us to-night.\"  Mr. Green would fain have excused\nhimself, on the ground that they would expect him and wait at the\nhotel, but a look from the lady told him to accept the\ninvitation.  The old man was the father of Mrs. Devenant's deceased\nhusband, as you will no doubt long since have supposed.  A\nfortnight from the day on which they met in the grave-yard, Mr.\nGreen and Mrs. Devenant were joined in holy wedlock; so that\nGeorge and Mary, who had loved each other so ardently in their\nyounger days, were now husband and wife.\n\nA celebrated writer has justly said of woman, \"A woman's whole\nlife is a history of the affections.  The heart is her world; it\nis there her ambition strives for empire; it is there her avarice\nseeks for hidden treasures.  She sends forth her sympathies on\nadventure; she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of\naffection; and, if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless, for it is a\nbankruptcy of the heart.\"\n\nMary had every reason to believe that she would never see George\nagain; and although she confesses that the love she bore him was\nnever transferred to her first husband, we can scarcely find\nfault with her for marrying Mr. Devenant.  But the adherence of\nGeorge Green to the resolution never to marry, unless to his\nMary, is, indeed, a rare instance of the fidelity of man in the\nmatter of love.  We can but blush for our country's shame when we\nrecall to mind the fact, that while George and Mary Green, and\nnumbers of other fugitives from American slavery, can receive\nprotection from any of the governments of Europe, they cannot\nreturn to their native land without becoming slaves.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMY narrative has now come to a close.  I may be asked, and no doubt\nshall, Are the various incidents and scenes related founded in\ntruth?  I answer, Yes.  I have personally participated in many of\nthose scenes.  Some of the narratives I have derived from other\nsources; many from the lips of those who, like myself, have run\naway from the land of bondage.  Having been for nearly nine years\nemployed on Lake Erie, I had many opportunities for helping the\nescape of fugitives, who, in return for the assistance they\nreceived, made me the depositary of their sufferings and wrongs.\nOf their relations I have made free use.  To Mrs. Child, of New\nYork, I am indebted for part of a short story.  American\nAbolitionist journals are another source from whence some of the\ncharacters appearing in my narrative are taken.  All these\ncombined have made up my story.  Having thus acknowledged my\nresources, I invite the attention of my readers to the following\nstatement, from which I leave them to draw their own\nconclusions:--\"It is estimated that in the United States, members\nof the Methodist church own 219,363 slaves; members of the\nBaptist church own 226,000 slaves; members of the Episcopalian\nchurch own 88,000 slaves; members of the Presbyterian church own\n77,000 slaves; members of all other churches own 50,000 slaves;\nin all, 660,563 slaves owned by members of the Christian church\nin this pious democratic republic!\"\n\nMay these facts be pondered over by British Christians, and at the\nnext anniversaries of the various religious denominations in\nLondon may their influence be seen and felt!  The religious\nbodies of American Christians will send their delegates to these\nmeetings.  Let British feeling be publicly manifested.  Let British\nsympathy express itself in tender sorrow for the condition of my\nunhappy race.  Let it be understood, unequivocally understood, that\nno fellowship can be held with slaveholders professing the same\ncommon Christianity as yourselves.  And until this stain from\nAmerica's otherwise fair escutcheon be wiped away, let no\nChristian association be maintained with those who traffic in the\nblood and bones of those whom God has made of one flesh as\nyourselves.  Finally, let the voice of the whole British nation be\nheard across the Atlantic, and throughout the length and breadth\nof the land of the Pilgrim Fathers, beseeching their descendants,\nas they value the common salvation, which knows no distinction\nbetween the bond and the free, to proclaim the Year of Jubilee.\nThen shall the \"earth indeed yield her increase, and God, even\nour own God, shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall\nfear Him.\"\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Etext of Clotel; or, The President's\nDaughter\n","id":586,"split":"train"}
