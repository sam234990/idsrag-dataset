The marquis is impressed with the English system of schooling and believes that his two sons, Ernest and Jules, will benefit from the influence and friendship of an independent and manly English boy. Harry, who is an undistinguished student at Westminster School, is eager for the opportunity to live in France, which he believes will create greater opportunities for him when he joins the British army. Harry sets off for Paris in 1790 with the intention of living with the St. Caux family for the next two to three years.\nHarry is escorted to the marquis\u2019s chateau near Dijon. He meets the marquis and his wife, along with their sons and three daughters, Marie, Jeanne, and Virginie. The marquis is impressed by Harry\u2019s confidence and self-possession in such an unfamiliar environment, but the rest of the family remains unconvinced and mocks his strange mannerisms and rough appearance. Their attitude changes, however, after Harry succeeds in killing a rabid dog that attacks Jeanne and Virginie. They begin to accept Harry as a member of the family, and Harry and Ernest become close friends, hunting and adventuring together and even managing to kill the Demon Wolf that long terrorized the communities surrounding the chateau.\nDuring the years of Harry\u2019s life at the chateau, the French Revolution continues to progress throughout the country. As a member of the French nobility, the marquis and his family are loyal to King Louis XVI and are deeply troubled by the growing violence and unrest in Paris and the countryside. After the royal family unsuccessfully attempts to flee Paris, the marquis decides to move the St. Caux family to Paris to support the king and to avoid the growing unrest of the peasants living in the countryside.\nThe situation in Paris continues to deteriorate and soon an arrest order is made for all the members of noble families. The marquis and marquise submit to the arrest but tell their children to escape, sending Ernest and Jules out of Paris to make for England and hiding the girls with the marquise\u2019s former nurse, Louise Moulin. Harry is free to return to England, but chooses to stay in Paris to look after the girls and help them flee to England should the need arise.\nHarry attempts to find a way to free the marquis and marquise, but he is too late. On the day of the September Massacres the prisoners throughout Paris are brought out for mock trials and systematically executed, including the Marquis and Marquise de St. Caux. Victor de Gisons, Marie\u2019s fianc\u00e9 who stayed in Paris to watch out for her, sees his father brought out for trial and flies into a rage. Harry succeeds in knocking him out and carrying him away, aided by a sympathetic Parisian who brings Victor back to his home.\nLeaving a grief-stricken and insensate Victor with his rescuers, Jacques and Elise Medart, Harry informs the girls of their parents\u2019 deaths. He soon discovers that Ernest and Jules were both killed on their way to England, but decides to tell the girls only when, or if, they reach England safely. Soon after, Marie is caught in the marketplace by Lebat, the son of the mayor of Dijon, who arrests her as a noble in hiding.\nHarry despairs of finding a way to rescue Marie. He manages to get a letter to her, but thinks it unlikely that he will be able to free her from the prison. She writes back and tells him that Lebat has offered to free her on the condition that she marries him, which she refuses.\nOne evening, Harry rescues a man being beaten in the street. The man turns out to be Maximilien de Robespierre, a radical leader of the Revolution, who vows to repay Harry\u2019s brave service. Seeing this as an opportunity to use Robespierre to free Marie, Harry agrees to be his secretary. After several months he discovers that Marie is soon to be tried and executed, and that Louise and the girls are under suspicion. He asks Robespierre to free Marie as repayment of his debt, but Robespierre refuses. Soon after, Lebat asks Robespierre to free Marie, as she has agreed to marry him and he knows that she is a friend of the Revolution. Robespierre consents, and that night Harry seizes the opportunity to kill Lebat and rescue Marie with the letter of release from Robespierre.\nHarry travels to Nantes with Louise and the girls while Marie stays in Paris with Victor, who is slowly recovering. Upon their arrival in Nantes, Harry struggles to find a ship that will carry them to England. Louise, weakened by the long and trying journey, soon falls ill and dies. Jeanne finds passage to England with a fisherman named Adolphe, the husband of a woman whose child Jeanne helped nurse back to health. Before they can make the arrangements, however, Jeanne and Virginie are arrested. Harry narrowly rescues them from being drowned in the river with the other prisoners, and they find a trustworthy captain to take them to England.\nThey arrive safely in England and Harry is reunited with his family, who thought him long dead in the violence of the Revolution. Several years later, Harry marries Jeanne after he passes his medical exams and joins his father\u2019s practice. Virginie marries one of Harry\u2019s brothers, Tom, and the girls and their husbands later travel back to France for a short time to stay with Marie and Victor, who, after fighting in the French army under Napoleon, purchases the chateau that once belonged to the Marquis de St. Caux.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of In the Reign of Terror, by G.

My object has been rather to tell you a tale of interest\nthan to impart historical knowledge, for the facts of the dreadful\ntime when \"the terror\" reigned supreme in France are well known to\nall educated lads. I need only say that such historical allusions as\nare necessary for the sequence of the story will be found correct,\nexcept that the Noyades at Nantes did not take place until a somewhat\nlater period than is here assigned to them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.A.

Yes, I am certainly thinking of it, though I\nhaven't at all made up my mind. There are advantages and disadvantages.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is such a long way, and to live among those French people,\nwho have been doing such dreadful things, attacking the Bastille,\nand, as I have heard you say, passing all sorts of revolutionary\nlaws, and holding their king and queen almost as prisoners in\nParis!\"\n\n\"Well, they won't eat him, my dear. The French Assembly, or the\nNational Assembly, or whatever it ought to be called, has certainly\nbeen passing laws limiting the power of the king and abolishing\nmany of the rights and privileges of the nobility and clergy; but\nyou must remember that the condition of the vast body of the French\nnation has been terrible. We have long conquered our liberties,\nand, indeed, never even in the height of the feudal system were the\nmass of the English people more enslaved as have been the peasants\nof France.\n\n\"We must not be surprised, therefore, if in their newly-recovered\nfreedom they push matters to an excess at first; but all this will\nright itself, and no doubt a constitutional form of government,\nsomewhat similar to our own, will be established. But all this is\nno reason against Harry's going out there. You don't suppose that\nthe French people are going to fly at the throats of the nobility.\nWhy, even in the heat of the civil war here there was no instance\nof any personal wrong being done to the families of  those engaged\nin the struggle, and in only two or three cases, after repeated\nrisings, were any even of the leaders executed.\n\n\"No; Harry will be just as safe there as he would be here. As to\nthe distance, it's nothing like so far as if he went to India, for\nexample.  I don't see any great chance of his setting the Thames\non fire at home.  His school report is always the same--'Conduct\nfair; progress in study moderate'--which means, as I take it, that\nhe just scrapes along. That's it, isn't it, Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I think so. You see every one cannot be at the top\nof the form.\"\n\n\"That's a very true observation, my boy. It is clear that if there\nare twenty boys in a class, nineteen fathers have to be disappointed.\nStill, of course, one would like to be the father who is not\ndisappointed.\"\n\n\"I stick to my work,\" the boy said; \"but there are always fellows\nwho seem to know just the right words without taking any trouble\nabout it. It comes to them, I suppose.\"\n\n\"What do you say to this idea yourself, Harry?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" the boy said doubtfully.\n\n\"And I don't know,\" his father agreed. \"At anyrate we will sleep\nupon it. I am clear that the offer is not to be lightly rejected.\"\n\nDr. Sandwith was a doctor in Chelsea. Chelsea in the year 1790\nwas a very different place to Chelsea of the present day. It was a\npretty suburban hamlet, and was indeed a very fashionable quarter.\nHere many of the nobility and personages connected with the court\nhad their houses, and broad country fields and lanes separated it\nfrom the stir and din of London. Dr. Sandwith had a good practice,\nbut he had also a large family. Harry was at Westminster, going\nbackwards and forwards across the fields to school. So far he had\nevinced no predilection for any special career. He was a sturdy,\nwell-built lad of some sixteen years old. He was, as his father\nsaid, not likely to set the Thames on fire in any way. He was as\nundistinguished in the various sports popular among boys in those\ndays as he was in his lessons. He was as good as the average, but\nno better; had fought some tough fights with boys of his own age,\nand had shown endurance rather than brilliancy.\n\nIn the ordinary course of things he would probably in three or four\nyears' time have chosen some profession; and, indeed, his father\nhad already settled in his mind that as Harry was not likely to\nmake any great figure in life in the way of intellectual capacity,\nthe best thing would be to obtain for him a commission in his\nMajesty's service, as to which, with the doctor's connection among\npeople of influence, there would not be any difficulty. He had,\nhowever, said nothing as yet to the boy on the subject.\n\nThe fact that Harry had three younger brothers and four sisters,\nand that Dr. Sandwith, who was obliged to keep up a good position,\nsometimes found it difficult to meet his various expenses, made\nhim perhaps more inclined to view favourably the offer he had\nthat morning received than would otherwise have been the case. Two\nyears before he had attended professionally a young French nobleman\nattached to the embassy. It was from him that the letter which\nhad been the subject of conversation had been received. It ran as\nfollows:\n\n\n\"Dear Doctor Sandwith,--Since my return from Paris\nI have frequently spoken to my brother, the Marquis of St. Caux,\nrespecting the difference of education between your English boys\nand our own.  Nothing struck me more when I was in London than your\ngreat schools. With us the children of good families are almost\nalways brought up at home. They learn to dance and to fence, but\nhave no other exercise for their limbs, and they lack the air of\nmanly independence which struck me in English boys. They are more\ngentil--I do not know the word in your language which expresses\nit--they carry themselves better; they are not so rough; they are\nmore polite. There are advantages in both systems, but for myself I\nlike yours much the best. My brother is, to some extent, a convert\nto my view. There are no such schools to which he could send his sons\nin France, for what large schools we have are under the management\nof the fathers, and the boys have none of that freedom which is\nthe distinguishing point of the English system of education. Even\nif there were such schools, I am sure that madame my sister-in-law\nwould never hear of her sons being sent there.\n\n\"Since this is so, the marquis has concluded that the best thing\nwould be to have an English boy of good family as their companion.\nHe would, of course, study with them under their masters. He would\nplay and ride with them, and would be treated as one of themselves.\nThey would learn something of English from him, which would\nbe useful if they adopt the diplomatic profession. He would learn\nFrench, which might also be useful to him; but of course the great\npoint which my brother desires is that his sons should acquire\nsomething of the manly independence of thought and action which\ndistinguishes English boys.\n\n\"Having arranged this much, I thought of you. I know that you have\nseveral sons. If you have one of from fourteen to sixteen years,\nand you would like him to take such a position for two or three\nyears, I should be glad indeed to secure such a companion for my\nnephews. If not, would you do me the favour of looking round among\nyour acquaintances and find us a lad such as we need. He must be\na gentleman and a fair type of the boy we are speaking of. I may\nsay that my brother authorizes me to offer in his name, in addition\nto all expenses, two thousand francs a year to the young gentleman\nwho will thus benefit his sons. I do not think that the political\nexcitement which is agitating Paris need be taken into consideration.\nNow that great concessions have been made to the representatives\nof the nation, it is not at all probable that there will be any\nrecurrence of such popular tumults as that which brought about the\ncapture of the Bastille. But in any case this need not weigh in\nthe decision, as my brother resides for the greater part of the\nyear in his chateau near Dijon in Burgundy, far removed from the\ntroubles in the capital.\"\n\n\nThe more Dr. Sandwith thought over the matter the more he liked it.\nThere were comparatively few Englishmen in those days who spoke the\nFrench language. It was, indeed, considered part of the education\nof a young man of good family to make what was called the grand\ntour of Europe under the charge of a tutor, after leaving the\nuniversity. But these formed a very small proportion of society,\nand, indeed, the frequent wars which had, since the Stuarts lost the\nthrone of England, occurred between the two countries had greatly\ninterfered with continental travel.\n\nEven now the subjects of France and England were engaged in a\ndesperate struggle in India, although there was peace between the\ncourts of Versailles and St. James's. A knowledge of the French\nlanguage then would be likely to be of great utility to Harry if\nhe entered the army; his expenses at Westminster would be saved,\nand the two hundred and forty pounds which he would acquire during\nhis three years' stay in France would be  very useful to him on\nhis first start in life. After breakfast next morning Dr. Sandwith\nasked Harry to take a turn in the garden with him, for the holidays\nhad just begun.\n\n\"What do you think of this, Harry?\"\n\n\"I have not thought much about it one way or the other, sir,\"\nHarry said, looking up with a smile. \"It seemed to me better that\nyou should do the thinking for both of us.\"\n\n\"I might perhaps be better able to judge whether it would\nbe advantageous or otherwise for you to accept the offer, but you\nmust be the best judge as to whether you would like to accept it\nor not.\"\n\n\"I can't quite make up my mind as to that, sir. I like school very\nmuch and I like being at home. I don't want to learn Frenchified\nways, nor to eat frogs and snails and all sorts of nastiness;\nstill, it would be fun going to a place so different to England,\nand hearing no English spoken, and learning all their rum ways,\nand getting to jabber French.\"\n\n\"It might be very useful to you in the army, Harry;\" and then the\ndoctor stopped suddenly.\n\n\"The army!\" Harry exclaimed in a tone of astonished delight.  \"Oh,\nsir, do you really think of my going into the army? You never said\na word about that before. I should like that immensely.\"\n\n\"That slipped out, Harry, for I did not mean to say anything about\nit until you had left school; still, if you go to France I do not\nknow why you should not keep that before you. I don't think the army\nis a very good profession, but you do not seem to have any marked\ntalent for anything else. You don't like the idea of medicine or\nthe church, and you were almost heart-broken when I wanted you to\naccept the offer of your uncle John of a seat in his counting-house.\nIt seems to me that the army would suit you better than anything\nelse, and I have no doubt that I could get you a commission. Now,\nwhenever we fight France is sure to be on the other side, and I\nthink that it would be of great advantage to you to have a thorough\nknowledge of French--a thing which very few officers in our army\npossess. If you accept this offer you will have the opportunity of\nattaining this, and at the same time of earning a nice little sum\nwhich would pay for your outfit and supply you with pocket-money\nfor some time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it would be first rate!\" Harry exclaimed excitedly. \"Oh,\nplease, accept the offer; I should like it of all things; and even\nif I do get ever so skinny on frogs and thin soup, I can get fat\non roast beef again when I get back.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense, Harry, about frogs and starving. The French\nstyle of cookery differs from ours, but they eat just as much, and\nalthough they may not, as a rule, be as broad and heavy as Englishmen,\nthat is simply a characteristic of race; the Latin peoples are of\nslighter build than the Teutonic. As to their food, you know that\nthe Romans, who were certainly judges of good living, considered\nthe snail a great luxury, and I dare say ate frogs too. A gentleman\nwho had made the grand tour told me that he had tasted them in Paris\nand found them very delicate eating. You may not like the living\nquite at first, but you will soon get over that, and once accustomed\nto it you will like it quite as well as our solid joints. My\nprincipal objection to your going lies quite in another direction.\nPublic opinion in France is much disturbed. In the National Assembly,\nwhich is the same as our Parliament, there is a great spirit\nof resistance to the royal authority, something like a revolution\nhas already been accomplished, and the king is little more than a\nprisoner.\"\n\n\"But that would surely make no difference to me, sir!\"\n\n\"No, I don't see that it should, Harry. Still, it would cause your\nmother a good deal of anxiety.\"\n\n\"I don't see it could make any difference,\" Harry repeated; \"and\nyou see, sir, when I go into the army and there is war, mother\nwould be a great deal more anxious.\"\n\n\"You mean, Harry,\" the doctor said with a smile, \"that whether her\nanxiety begins a little sooner or later does not make much difference.\"\n\n\"I don't think I quite meant that, sir,\" Harry said; \"but yes,\"\nhe added frankly, after a moment's thought, \"I suppose I did; but\nI really don't see that supposing there were any troubles in France\nit could possibly make any difference to me; even if there were a\ncivil war, such as we had in England, they would not interfere with\nboys.\"\n\n\"No, I don't see that it would make any difference, and the chance\nis so remote that it need not influence our decision. Of course if\nwar broke out between the two countries the marquis would see that\nyou were sent back safely. Well, then, Harry, I am to consider that\nyour decision is in favour of your accepting this appointment.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir. I am sure it will be a capital thing for me,\nand I have no doubt it will be great fun. Of course at first it\nwill be strange to hear them all jabbering in French, but I suppose\nI shall soon pick it up.\"\n\nAnd so Mrs. Sandwith was informed by her husband that after talking\nit over with Harry he had concluded that the proposed arrangement\nwould really be an excellent one, and that it would be a great pity\nto let such an opportunity slip.\n\nThe good lady was for a time tearful in her forebodings that Harry\nwould be starved, for in those days it was a matter of national\nopinion that our neighbours across the Channel fed on the most meagre\nof diet; but she was not in the habit of disputing her husband's\nwill, and when the letter of acceptance had been sent off, she\nbusied herself in preparing Harry's clothes for his long absence.\n\n\"He ought to be measured for several suits, my dear,\" she said to\nher husband, \"made bigger and bigger to allow for his growing.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear! You do not suppose that clothes cannot be\npurchased in France! Give him plenty of under-linen, but the fewer\njackets and trousers he takes over the better; it will be much\nbetter for him to get clothes out there of the same fashion as\nother people; the boy will not want to be stared at wherever he\ngoes. The best rule is always to dress like people around you. I\nshall give him money, and directly he gets there he can get a suit\nor two made by the tailor who makes for the lads he is going to be\nwith. The English are no more loved in France than the French are\nhere, and though Harry has no reason to be ashamed of his nationality\nthere is no occasion for him to draw the attention of everyone\nhe meets to it by going about in a dress which would seem to them\npeculiar.\"\n\nIn due time a letter was received from Count Auguste de St.  Caux,\nstating that the marquis had requested him to write and say that\nhe was much gratified to hear that one of the doctor's own sons\nwas coming over to be a companion and friend to his boys, and that\nhe was sending off in the course of two days a gentleman of his\nhousehold to Calais to meet him and  conduct him to Paris. On young\nMr. Sandwith's arrival at Calais he was to go at once to the Hotel\nLion door and ask for M. du Tillet.\n\nDuring the intervening time Harry had been very busy, he had to\nsay good-bye to all his friends, who looked, some with envy, some\nwith pity, upon him, for the idea of a three years' residence in\nFrance was a novel one to all. He was petted and made much of at\nhome, especially by his sisters, who regarded him in the light of\na hero about to undertake a strange and hazardous adventure.\n\nThree days after the arrival of the letter of the marquis, Dr.\nSandwith and Harry started by stage for Dover, and the doctor put\nhis son on board the packet sailing for Calais. The evening before,\nhe gave him much good advice as to his behaviour.\n\n\"You will see much that is new, and perhaps a good deal that you\ndon't like, Harry, but it is better for you never to criticize or\ngive a hostile opinion about things; you would not like it if a\nFrench boy came over here and made unpleasant remarks about English\nways and manners. Take things as they come and do as others do;\navoid all comparisons between French and English customs; fall in\nwith the ways of those around you; and adopt as far as you can the\npolite and courteous manner which is general among the French, and\nin which, I must say, they are far ahead of us. If questioned, you\nwill, of course, give your opinion frankly and modestly; it is the\nindependence of thought among English boys which has attracted the\nattention and approval of Auguste de St. Caux.\n\n\"Be natural and simple, giving yourself no airs, and permitting\nnone on the part of the lads you are with; their father says you\nare to be treated as their equal. But, upon the other hand, do not\nbe ever on the lookout for small slights, and bear with perfect\ngood temper any little ridicule your, to them foreign, ways and\nmanners may excite.  I need not tell you to be always straightforward,\nhonest, and true, for of those qualities I think you possess a fair\nshare. Above all things restrain any tendency to use your fists;\nfighting comes naturally to English boys, but in France it is\nconsidered as brutal and degrading--a blow is a deadly insult,\nand would  never be forgiven.\n\n\"So, whatever the provocation, abstain from striking anyone.  Should\nyou find that in any way your position is made intolerable, you\nwill of course appeal to the marquis, and unless you obtain redress\nyou will come home--you will find  no difficulty in travelling\nwhen you once understand the language--but avoid anything like\npetty complaints. I trust there will be no reason for complaints at\nall, and that you will find your position an exceedingly pleasant\none as soon as you become accustomed to it; but should occasion\narise bear my words in mind.\"\n\nHarry promised to follow his father's advice implicitly, but in\nhis own mind he wondered what fellows did when they quarrelled if\nthey were not allowed to fight; however, he supposed that he should,\nunder the circumstances, do the same as French boys, whatever that\nmight be.\n\nAs soon as the packet was once fairly beyond the harbour Harry's\nthoughts were effectually diverted from all other matters by the\nmotion of the sailing boat, and he was soon in a state of prostration,\nin which he remained until, seven hours later, the packet entered\nCalais harbour.\n\nDr. Sandwith had requested the captain to allow one of his men\nto show Harry the way to the Lion door. Harry had pulled himself\ntogether a little as the vessel entered the still water in the\nharbour, and was staring at the men in their blue blouses and wooden\nshoes, at the women in their quaint and picturesque attire, when\na sailor touched him on the shoulder:\n\n\"Now, young sir, the captain tells me I am to show you the way to\nyour hotel. Which is your box?\"\n\nHarry pointed out his trunk; the sailor threw it on his shoulder,\nand Harry, with a feeling of bewilderment, followed him along the\ngangway to the shore. Here he was accosted by an officer.\n\n\"What does he say?\" he asked the sailor.\n\n\"He asks for your passport.\"\n\nHarry fumbled in his breast pocket for the document which his father\nhad obtained for him from the foreign office, duly viseed by the\nFrench ambassador, notifying  that Henry Sandwith, age sixteen,\nheight five feet eight, hair brown, eyes gray, nose short, mouth\nlarge, was about to reside in France in the family of the Marquis\nde St.  Caux. The officer glanced it over, and then returned it to\nHarry with a polite bow, which Harry in some confusion endeavoured\nto imitate.\n\n\"What does the fellow want to bow and scrape like that for?\" he\nmuttered to himself as he followed his guide. \"An Englishman would\njust have nodded and said 'All right!' What can a fellow want more,\nI should like to know? Well I suppose I shall get accustomed to\nit, and shall take to bowing and scraping as a matter of course.\"\n\nThe Lion door was close at hand. In reply to the sailor's question\nthe landlord said that M. du Tillet was within. The sailor put\ndown the trunk, pocketed the coin Harry gave him, and with a \"Good\nluck, young master!\" went out, taking with him, as Harry felt,\nthe last link to England. He turned and followed the landlord. The\nlatter mounted a flight of stairs, knocked at a door, and opened\nit.\n\n\"A young gentleman desires to see M. du Tillet,\" he said, and Harry\nentered.\n\nA tall, big man, whose proportions at once disappointed Harry's\npreconceived notions as to the smallness and leanness of Frenchmen,\nrose from the table at which he was writing.\n\n\"Monsieur--Sandwith?\" he said interrogatively. \"I am glad to see\nyou.\"\n\nHarry did not understand the latter portion of the remark, but he\ncaught the sound of his name.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said nodding. \"How do you do, M. du Tillet?\"\n\nThe French gentleman bowed; Harry bowed; and then they looked\nat each other. There was nothing more to say. A smile stole over\nHarry's face, and broke into a frank laugh. The Frenchman smiled,\nput his hand on Harry's shoulder, and said:\n\n\"Brave garcon!\" and Harry felt they were friends.\n\nM. du Tillet's face bore an expression of easy good temper. He wore\na wig with long curls; he had a soldier's bearing, and a scar on\nhis left cheek; his complexion was dark and red, his eyebrows black\nand bushy. After a pause he said:\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" and then put imaginary food to his mouth.\n\n\"You mean will I eat anything?\" Harry translated. \"Yes, that I\nwill if there's anything fit to eat. I begin to feel as hungry as\na hunter, and no wonder, for I am as hollow as a drum!\"\n\nHis nod was a sufficient answer. M. du Tillet took his hat, opened\nthe door, and bowed for Harry to precede him.\n\nHarry hesitated, but believing it would be the polite way to do as\nhe was told, returned the bow and went out. The Frenchman put his\nhand on his shoulder, and they went down stairs together and took\ntheir seats in the salon, where his companion gave an order, and\nin two or three minutes a bowl of broth was placed before each of\nthem.\n\nIt fully answered Harry's ideas as to the thinness of French soup,\nfor it looked like dirty water with a few pieces of bread and some\nscraps of vegetables floating in it. He was astonished at the piece\nof bread, nearly a yard long, placed on the table. M. du Tillet\ncut a piece off and handed it to him. He broke a portion of it into\nhis broth, and found, when he tasted it, that it was much nicer\nthan it looked.\n\n\"It's not so bad after all,\" he thought to himself.  \"Anyhow bread\nseems plentiful, so there's no fear of my starving.\"  He followed\nhis companion's example and made his way steadily through a number\nof dishes all new and strange to him; neither his sight nor his taste\ngave him the slightest indication as to what meat he was eating.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" he concluded; \"but what people can want\nto make such messes of their food for I can't make out. A slice of\ngood roast beef is worth the lot of it; but really it isn't nasty;\nsome of the dishes are not bad at all if one only knew what they\nwere made of.\" M. du Tillet offered him some wine, which he tasted\nbut shook his head, for it seemed rough and sour; but he poured\nhimself out some water. Presently a happy idea seized him; he\ntouched the bread and said interrogatively, \"Bread?\" M. du Tillet\nat once replied \"Pain,\" which Harry repeated after him.\n\nThe ice thus broken, conversation began, and Harry soon learned the\nFrench for knife, fork, spoon, plate, and various other articles,\nand felt that he was fairly on the way towards talking French.\nAfter the meal was over M. du Tillet rose and put on his hat, and\nsigned to Harry to accompany him. They strolled through the town,\nwent down to the quays and looked at the fishing-boats; Harry was\nfeeling more at home now, and asked the French name for everything\nhe saw, repeating the word over and over again to himself until he\nfelt sure that he should remember it, and then asking the name of\nsome fresh object.\n\nThe next morning they started in the post-waggon for Paris, and\narrived there after thirty-six hours' travel. Harry was struck\nwith the roads, which were far better tended and kept than those in\nEngland. The extreme flatness of the country surprised him, and,\nexcept in the quaintness of the villages and the variety of the\nchurch towers, he saw little to admire during the journey.\n\n\"If it is all like this,\" he thought to himself, \"I don't see that\nthey have any reason for calling it La belle France.\"\n\nOf Paris he saw little. A blue-bloused porter carried his trunk what\nseemed to Harry a long distance from the place where the conveyance\nstopped. The streets here were quiet and almost deserted after the\nbusy thoroughfares of the central city. The houses stood, for the\nmost part, back from the street, with high walls and heavy gates.\n\n\"Here we are at last,\" his guide said, as he halted before a large\nand massive gateway, surmounted by a coat of arms with supporters\ncarved in stone work. He rang at the bell, which was opened by a\nporter in livery, who bowed profoundly upon seeing M. du Tillet.\nPassing through the doorway, Harry found himself in a spacious\nhall, decorated with armour and arms. As he crossed the threshold\nM. du Tillet took his hand and shook it heartily, saying, \"Welcome!\"\nHarry understood the action, though not the words, and nodded,\nsaying:\n\n\"I think I shall get on capitally if they are all as jolly as you\nare.\"\n\nThen they both laughed, and Harry looked round wondering what was\ncoming next.\n\n\"The marquis and his family are all away at their chateau near\nDijon,\" his companion said, waving his hand. \"We shall stay a day\nor two to rest ourselves after our journey, and then start to join\nthem.\"\n\nHe led Harry into a great salon magnificently furnished, pointed\nto the chairs and looking-glasses and other articles of furniture,\nall swathed up in coverings; and the lad understood at once that\nthe family were away. This was a relief to him; he was getting on\ncapitally with M. du Tillet, but shrank from the prospect of meeting\nso many strange faces.\n\nA meal was speedily served in a small and comfortably-furnished\napartment; and Harry concluded that although he might not be able\nto decide on the nature of his food, it was really nice, and that\nthere was no fear whatever of his falling  away in flesh. M. du\nTillet pressed him to try the wine again, and this he found to be\na vast improvement upon the vintage he had tasted at Calais.\n\nAfter breakfast next morning they started for a walk, and Harry\nwas delighted with the Louvre, the Tuileries, the Palais Royal, and\nother public buildings, which he could not but acknowledge were\nvastly superior to anything he had seen in London. Then he was\ntaken to a tailor's, the marquis having commissioned his guide to\ncarry out Dr. Sandwith's request in this matter. M. du Tillet looked\ninterrogatively at Harry as he entered the shop, as if to ask if\nhe understood why he was taken there.\n\nHarry nodded, for indeed he was glad to see that no time was\nto be lost, for he was already conscious that his dress differed\nconsiderably from that of French boys. Several street gamins had\npointed at him and made jeering remarks, which, without understanding\nthe words, Harry felt to be insulting, and would, had he heard them\nin the purlieus of Westminster, have considered as a challenge to\nbattle. He had not, however, suffered altogether unavenged, for\nupon one occasion M. du Tillet turned sharply round and caught one\noffender so smartly with his cane that he ran howling away.\n\n\"They are awful guys!\" Harry thought as he looked at the French boys\nhe met. \"But it's better to be a guy than to be chaffed by every\nboy one meets, especially if one is not to be allowed to fight.\"\nIt was, therefore, with a feeling of satisfaction that he turned\ninto the tailor's shop. The proprietor came up bowing, as Harry\nthought, in a most cringing sort of way to his companion. M. du\nTillet gave some orders, and the tailor unrolled a variety of pieces\nof cloth and other materials for Harry's inspection.\n\nThe lad shook his head and turned to his guide, and, pointing to\nthe goods, asked him to choose the things which were most suitable\nfor him; M. du Tillet understood the appeal and ordered four suits.\nTwo of these were for ordinary wear; another was, Harry concluded,\nfor the evening; and the fourth for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe coats were cut long, but very open in front, and were far too\nscanty to button; the waistcoats were long and embroidered; a white\nand ample handkerchief went round the throat and was tied loosely,\nwith long ends edged with lace falling in front; knee-breeches,\nwith white stockings, and shoes with buckles, completed the costume.\n\nHarry looked on with a smile of amusement, and burst into a hearty\nlaugh when the garments were fixed upon, for the idea of himself\ndressed out in these seemed to him ludicrous in the extreme.\n\n\"How they would laugh at home,\" he thought to himself, \"if they\ncould see me in these things! The girls would give me no peace.\nAnd wouldn't there be an uproar if I were to turn up in them in\nDean's Yard and march up school!\"\n\nHarry was then measured. When this was done he took out his purse,\nwhich contained fifty guineas; for his father had thought it probable\nthat the clothes he would require would cost more than they would\nin London, and he wished him to have a good store of pocket-money\nuntil he received the first instalment of his pay. M.  du Tillet,\nhowever, shook his head and motioned to him to put up his purse;\nand Harry supposed that it was not customary to pay for things in\nFrance until they were delivered. Then his companion took him into\nanother shop, and pointing to his own ruffles intimated that Harry\nwould require some linen of this kind to be worn when in full dress.\nHarry signified that his friend should order what was necessary;\nand half a dozen shirts, with deep ruffles at the wrist and breast,\nwere ordered. This brought their shopping to an end.\n\nThey remained three days in Paris, at the end of which time Harry's\nclothes were delivered. The following morning a carriage with the\narms of the marquis emblazoned upon it came up to the door, and\nthey started. The horses were fat and lazy; and Harry, who had no\nidea how far they were going, thought that the journey was likely\nto be a long one if this was the pace at which they were to travel.\n\nTwelve miles out they changed horses at a post-station, their own\nreturning to Paris, and after this had relays at each station, and\ntravelled at a pace which seemed to Harry to be extraordinarily\nrapid.  They slept twice upon the road.\n\nThe third day the appearance of the country altogether changed, and,\ninstead of the flat plains which Harry had begun to think extended\nall over France, they were now among hills higher than anything he\nhad ever seen before. Towards the afternoon they crossed the range\nand began to descend, and as evening approached M. du Tillet pointed\nto a building standing on rising ground some miles away and said:\n\n\"That is the chateau.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA Mad Dog\n\n\nIt was dark before the carriage drove up to the chateau. Their\napproach had been seen, for two lackeys appeared with torches at\nthe head of the broad steps. M. du Tillet put his hand encouragingly\non Harry's shoulder and led him up the steps. A servant preceded\nthem across a great hall, when a door opened and a gentleman came\nforward.\n\n\"Monsieur le Marquis,\" M. du Tillet said, bowing, \"this is the\nyoung gentleman you charged me to bring to you.\n\n\"I am glad to see you,\" the marquis said; \"and I hope you will make\nyourself happy and comfortable here.\"\n\nHarry did not understand the words, but he felt the tone of kindness\nand courtesy with which they were spoken. He could, however, only\nbow; for although in the eight days he had spent with M. du Tillet\nhe had picked up a great many nouns and a few phrases, his stock\nof words was of no use to him at present.\n\n\"And you, M. du Tillet,\" the marquis said. \"You have made a good\njourney, I hope? I thank you much for the trouble you have taken.\nI like the boy's looks; what do you think of him?\"\n\n\"I like him very much,\" M. du Tillet said; \"he is a new type to\nme, and a pleasant one. I think he will make a good companion for\nthe young count.\"\n\nThe marquis now turned and led the way into a great drawing-room,\nand taking Harry's hand led him up to  a lady seated on a couch.\n\n\"This is our young English friend, Julie. Of course he is strange\nat present, but M. du Tillet reports well of him, and I already\nlike his face.\"\n\nThe lady held out her hand, which Harry, instead of bending over\nand kissing, as she had expected, shook heartily. For an instant\nonly a look of intense surprise passed across her face; then she\nsaid courteously:\n\n\"We are glad to see you. It is very good of you to come so far to\nus. I trust that you will be happy here.\"\n\n\"These are my sons Ernest and Jules, who will, I am sure, do all\nin their power to make you comfortable,\" the marquis said.\n\nThe last words were spoken sharply and significantly, and their\ntone was not lost upon the two boys; they had a moment before been\nstruggling to prevent themselves bursting into a laugh at Harry's\nreception of their mother's greeting, but they now instantly composed\ntheir faces and advanced.\n\n\"Shake hands with him,\" the marquis said sharply; \"it is the custom\nof his country.\"\n\nEach in turn held out his hand to Harry, who, as he shook hands\nwith them, took a mental stock of his future companions.\n\n\"Good looking,\" he said to himself, \"but more like girls than boys.\nA year in the fifth form would do them a world of good. I could\npolish the two off together with one hand.\"\n\n\"My daughters,\" the marquis said, \"Mesdemoiselles Marie, Jeanne,\nand Virginie.\"\n\nThree young ladies had risen from their seats as their father\nentered, each made a deep curtsy as her name was mentioned, and\nHarry bowed deeply in return. Mademoiselle Marie was two years at\nleast older than himself, and was already a young lady of fashion.\nJeanne struck him as being about the same age as his sister Fanny,\nwho was between fourteen and fifteen. Virginie was a child of ten.\nErnest was about his own age, while Jules came between the two\nyounger girls.\n\n\"Take M. Sandwith to the abbe,\" the marquis said to Ernest, \"and do\nall in your power to set him at his ease. Remember what you would\nfeel if you were placed, as he is, among strange people in a strange\ncountry.\"\n\nThe lad motioned to Harry to accompany him, and the three boys left\nthe room together.\n\n\"You can go to your gouvernante,\" the marquise said to the two\nyounger girls; and with a profound curtsy to her and another to the\nmarquis, they left the room. Unrestrained now by their presence,\nthe marquise turned to her husband with a merry laugh.\n\n\"But it is a bear you have brought home, Edouard, a veritable\nbear--my fingers ache still--and he is to teach manners to my sons!\nI always protested against the plan, but I did not think it would\nbe as bad as this. These islanders are savages.\"\n\nThe marquis smiled.\n\n\"He is a little gauche, but that will soon rub off. I like him,\nJulie. Remember it was a difficult position for a boy. We did not\nhave him here to give polish to our sons. It may be that they have\neven a little too much of this at present. The English are not\npolished, everyone knows that, but they are manly and independent.\nThat boy bore himself well. He probably had never been in a room\nlike this in his life, he was ignorant of our language, alone among\nstrangers, but he was calm and self-possessed. I like the honest\nstraightforward look in his face. And look at the width of the\nshoulders and the strength of his arms; why, he would break Ernest\nacross his knee, and the two boys must be about the same age.\"\n\n\"Oh, he has brute strength, I grant,\" the marquise said; \"so have\nthe sons of our peasants; however, I do not want to find fault with\nhim, it is your hobby, or rather that of Auguste, who is, I think,\nmad about these English; I will say nothing to prevent its having\na fair trial, only I hope it will not be necessary for me to give\nhim my hand again.\"\n\n\"I do not suppose it will until he leaves, Julie, and by that time,\nno doubt, he will know what to do with it; but here is M. du Tillet\nwaiting all this time for you to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my good M. du Tillet,\" the marquise said. \"In truth\nthat squeeze of my hand has driven all other matters from my mind.\nHow have you fared? This long journey with this English bear must\nhave been very tedious for you.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Madame la Marquise,\" M. du Tillet replied, \"it has been no\nhardship, the boy has amused me greatly; nay, more, he has pleased\nme. We have been able to say little to each other, though, indeed,\nhe is quick and eager to learn, and will soon speak our language;\nbut his face has been a study. When he is pleased you can see that\nhe is pleased, and that is a  pleasure, for few people are pleased\nin our days. Again, when he does not like a thing you can also\nsee it.  I can see that he says to himself, I can expect nothing\nbetter, these poor people are only French. When the gamins in Paris\njeered him as to his dress, he closed his hands and would have flown\nat them with his fists after the manner of his countrymen had he\nnot put strong restraint on himself. From the look of his honest\neyes I shall, when he can speak our language, believe implicitly\nwhat he says.  That boy would not tell a lie whatever were the\nconsequences.  Altogether I like him much. I think that in a very\nlittle while he will adapt himself to what goes on around him, and\nthat you will have no reason ere long to complain of his gaucheries.\"\n\n\"And you really think, M. du Tillet, that he will be a useful\ncompanion for my boys?\"\n\n\"If you will pardon me for saying so, madam, I think that he will--at\nany rate I am sure he can be trusted to teach them no wrong.\"\n\n\"You are all against me,\" the marquise laughed. \"And you, Marie?\"\n\n\"I did not think of him one way or the other,\" the girl said coldly.\n\"He is very awkward; but as he is not to be my companion that does\nnot concern me. It is like one of papa's dogs, one more or less\nmakes no difference in the house so long as they do not tread upon\none's skirt.\"\n\n\"That is the true spirit of the French nobility, Marie,\" her father\nsaid sarcastically. \"Outside our own circle the whole human race is\nnothing to us; they are animals who supply our wants, voila tour.\nI tell you, my dear, that the time is coming when this will not\nsuffice.  The nation is stirring; that France which we have so long\nignored is lifting its head and muttering; the news from Paris is\nmore and more grave. The Assembly has assumed the supreme authority,\nand the king is a puppet in its power. The air is dark as with a\nthunder-cloud, and there may be such a storm sweep over France as\nthere has not been since the days of the Jacquerie.\"\n\n\"But the people should be contented,\" M. du Tillet said; \"they have\nhad all the privileges they ever possessed given back to them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the marquis assented, \"and there lies the danger. It is one\nthing or the other. If as soon as the temper of the third estate\nhad been seen the king's guards had entered and cleared the place\nand closed the door, as Cromwell did  when the parliament was\ntroublesome to him in England, that would have been one way. Paris\nwould have been troublesome, we might have had again the days of\nthe Fronde, but in the end the king's party would have won.\n\n\"However, that was not the way tried. They began by concessions,\nthey go on with concessions, and each concession is made the ground\nfor more. It is like sliding down a hill; when you have once begun\nyou cannot stop yourself, and you go on until there is a crash;\nthen it may be you pick yourself up sorely wounded and bruised,\nand begin to reclimb the hill slowly and painfully; it may be that\nyou are dashed to pieces. I am not a politician. I do not care much\nfor the life of Paris, and am well content to live quietly here on\nour estates; but even I can see that a storm is gathering; and as\nfor my brother Auguste, he goes about shaking his head and wringing\nhis hands, his anticipations are of the darkest. What can one\nexpect when fellows like Voltaire and Rousseau were permitted by\ntheir poisonous preaching to corrupt and inflame the imagination\nof the people? Both those men's heads should have been cut off the\ninstant they began to write.\n\n\"The scribblers are at the root of all the trouble with their\npestilent doctrines; but it is too late now, the mischief is done.\nIf we had a king strong and determined all might yet be well; but\nLouis is weak in decision, he listens one moment to Mirabeau and the\nnext to the queen, who is more firm and courageous. And so things\ndrift on from bad to worse, and the Assembly, backed by the turbulent\nscum of Paris, are masters of the situation.\"\n\nFor some time Harry lived a quiet life at the chateau. He found\nhis position a very pleasant one. The orders of the marquis that\nhe should be treated as one of the family were obeyed, and there\nwas no distinction made between himself and Ernest. In the morning\nthe two boys and himself worked with the abbe, a quiet and gentle\nold man; in the afternoon they rode and fenced, under the instructions\nof M. du Tillet or one or other of the gentlemen of the marquis\nestablishment; and on holidays shot or fished as they chose on\nthe preserves or streams of the estate. For an hour each morning\nthe two younger girls shared in their studies, learning Latin and\nhistory with their brothers. Harry got on very well with Ernest,\nbut there was no real cordiality between them. The  hauteur and\ninsolence with which the young count treated his inferiors were a\nconstant source of exasperation to Harry.\n\n\"He thinks himself a little god,\" he would often mutter to himself.\n\"I would give a good deal to have him for three months at Westminster.\nWouldn't he get his conceit and nonsense knocked out of him!\"\n\nAt the same time he was always scrupulously polite and courteous to\nhis English companion--much too polite, indeed, to please Harry.\nHe had good qualities too: he was generous with his money, and\nif during their rides a woman came up with a tale of distress he\nwas always ready to assist her. He was clever, and Harry, to his\nsurprise, found that his knowledge of Latin was far beyond his own,\nand that Ernest could construct passages with the greatest ease\nwhich altogether puzzled him. He was a splendid rider, and could\nkeep his seat with ease and grace on the most fiery animals in his\nfather's stables.\n\nWhen they went out with their guns Harry felt his inferiority\nkeenly.  Not only was Ernest an excellent shot, but at the end of\na long day's sport he would come in apparently fresh and untired,\nwhile Harry, although bodily far the most powerful, would be\ncompletely done up; and at gymnastic exercises he could do with\nease feats which Harry could at first not even attempt. In this\nrespect, however, the English lad in three months' time was able\nto rival him. His disgust at finding himself so easily beaten by a\nFrench boy nerved him to the greatest exertions, and his muscles,\npractised in all sorts of games, soon adapted themselves to the\nnew exercises.\n\nHarry picked up French very rapidly. The absolute necessity there was\nto express himself in that language caused him to make a progress\nwhich surprised himself, and at the end of three months he was able\nto converse with little difficulty, and having learned it entirely\nby ear he spoke with a fair accent and pronunciation. M. du Tillet,\nwho was the principal instructor of the boys in their outdoor\nexercises, took much pains to assist him in his French, and helped\nhim on in every way in his power.\n\nIn the evening there were dancing lessons, and although very far\nfrom exhibiting the stately grace with which Ernest could perform\nthe minuet or other courtly dances  then in fashion, Harry came\nin time to perform his part fairly. Two hours were spent in the\nevening in the salon. This part of the day Harry at first found the\nmost tedious; but as soon as he began to speak fluently the marquis\naddressed most of his conversation to him, asking him questions\nabout the life of English boys at school and about English manners\nand customs, and Harry soon found himself chatting at his ease.\n\n\"The distinction of classes is clearly very much less with you in\nEngland than it is here,\" the marquis said one day when Harry had\nbeen describing a great fight which had taken place between a party\nof Westminster boys and those of the neighbourhood. \"It seems\nextraordinary to me that sons of gentlemen should engage in a\npersonal fight with boys of the lowest class. Such a thing could\nnot happen here. If you were insulted by such a boy, what would\nyou do, Ernest?\"\n\n\"I should run him through the body,\" Ernest said quietly.\n\n\"Just so,\" his father replied, \"and I don't say you would be wrong\naccording to our notions; but I do not say that the English plan is\nnot the best. The English gentleman--for  Monsieur Sandwith says\nthat even among grown-up people the same habits prevail--does not\ndisdain to show the canaille that even with their own rough weapons\nhe is their superior, and he thus holds their respect. It is a\ncoarse way and altogether at variance with our notions, but there\nis much to be said for it.\"\n\n\"But it altogether does away with the reverence that the lower\nclass should feel for the upper,\" Ernest objected.\n\n\"That is true, Ernest. So long as that feeling generally exists, so\nlong as there is, as it were, a wide chasm between the two classes,\nas there has always existed in France, it would be unwise perhaps\nfor one of the upper to admit that in any respect there could be\nany equality between them; but this is not so in England, where a\ncertain equality has always been allowed to exist. The Englishman\nof all ranks has a certain feeling of self-respect and independence,\nand the result is shown in the history of the wars which have been\nfought between the two nations.\n\n\"France in early days always relied upon her chivalry. The horde of\nfootmen she placed in the field counted for little. England, upon\nthe other hand, relied principally upon her archers and her pikemen,\nand it must be admitted that they beat us handsomely. Then again in\nthe wars in Flanders, under the English general Marlborough their\ninfantry always proved themselves  superior to ours. It is galling\nto admit it, but there is no blinking the facts of history. It seems\nto me that the feeling of independence and self-respect which this\nEnglish system gives rise to, even among the lowest class, must\nrender them man for man better soldiers than those drawn from a\npeasantry whose very lives are at the mercy of their lords.\"\n\n\"I think, du Tillet,\" the marquis said later on on the same evening,\nwhen the young people had retired, \"I have done very well in taking\nmy brother Auguste's advice as to having an English companion\nfor Ernest. If things were as they were under the Grand Monarque,\nI do not say that it would have been wise to allow a young French\nnobleman to get these English ideas into his head, but it is\ndifferent now.\n\n\"We are on the eve of great changes. What will come of it no one\ncan say; but there will certainly be changes, and it is a good thing\nthat my children should get broader ideas than those in which we\nwere brought up. This lad is quiet and modest, but he ventures to\nthink for himself. It scarce entered the head of a French nobleman\na generation back that the mass of the people had any feelings or\nwishes, much less rights. They were useful in their way, just as\nthe animals are, but needed no more consideration. They have never\ncounted for anything.\n\n\"In England the people have rights and liberties; they won them\nyears ago. It would be well for us in the present day had they\ndone so in France. I fancy the next generation will have to adapt\nthemselves to changed circumstances, and the ideas that Ernest and\nJules will learn from this English lad will be a great advantage\nto them, and will fit them for the new state of things.\"\n\nIt was only during lessons, when their gouvernante was always\npresent, at meal times, and in the salon in the evening, that\nHarry had any communication with the young ladies of the family. If\nthey met in the grounds they were saluted by the boys with as much\nformal courtesy as if they had been the most distant acquaintances,\nreturning the bows with deep curtsies.\n\nThese meetings were a source of great amusement to Harry, who could\nscarcely preserve his gravity at these formal and distant greetings.\nOn one occasion, however, the even course of these meetings was\nbroken. The boys had just left  the tennis-court where they had\nbeen playing, and had laid aside the swords which they carried when\nwalking or riding.\n\nThe tennis-court was at some little distance from the house, and\nthey were walking across the garden when they heard a scream.  At\na short distance was the governess with her two young charges.  She\nhad thrown her arms round them, and stood the picture of terror,\nuttering loud screams.\n\nLooking round in astonishment to discover the cause of her terror,\nHarry saw a large wolf-hound running towards them at a trot.  Its\ntongue was hanging out, and there was a white foam on its jaws.  He\nhad heard M. du Tillet tell the marquis on the previous day that\nthis dog, which was a great favourite, seemed strange and unquiet,\nand he had ordered it to be chained up. It had evidently broken\nits fastening, for it was dragging a piece of chain some six feet\nlong behind it.\n\n\nIt flashed across him at once that the animal was mad, but without\nan instant's hesitation he dashed off at full speed and threw himself\nin front of the ladies before the dog reached them. Snatching off\nhis coat, and then kneeling on one knee, he awaited the animal's\nattack. Without deviating from its course the hound sprang at him\nwith a short snarling howl. Harry threw his coat over its head and\nthen grasped it round the neck.\n\nThe impetus of the spring knocked him over, and they rolled together\non the ground. The animal struggled furiously, but Harry retained\nhis grasp round its neck. In vain the hound tried to free itself\nfrom its blinding encumbrance, or to bite his assailant through\nit, and struggled to shake off his hold with its legs and claws.\nHarry maintained his grasp tightly round its neck, with his head\npressed closely against one of its ears. Several times they rolled\nover and over.  At last Harry made a great effort when he was\nuppermost, and managed to get his knees upon the animal's belly, and\nthen, digging his toes in the ground, pressed with all his weight\nupon it.\n\nThere was a sound as of cracking of bones, then the dog's struggles\nsuddenly ceased, and his head fell over, and Harry rose to his\nfeet by the side of the dead hound just as a number of men, with\npitch-forks and other weapons, ran up to the spot from the stables,\nwhile the marquis, sword in hand, arrived from the house.\n\nThe gouvernante, too, paralysed by fear, had stood close by with\nher charges while the struggle was going on. Ernest had come up, and\nwas standing in front of his sisters, ready to be the next victim\nif the dog had overpowered Harry. Less accustomed to running than\nthe English boy, and for a moment rooted to the ground with horror\nat his sisters' danger, he had not arrived at the spot until the\nstruggle between Harry and the dog was half over, and had then seen\nno way of rendering assistance; but believing that the dog was sure\nto be the conqueror, he had placed himself before his sisters to\nbear the brunt of the next assault.\n\nSeeing at a glance that his daughters were untouched, the marquis\nran on to Harry, who was standing panting and breathless, and threw\nhis arms round him.\n\n\"My brave boy,\" he exclaimed, \"you have saved my daughters from a\ndreadful death by your courage and devotion. How can I and their\nmother ever thank you? I saw it all from the terrace--the speed\nwith which you sprang to their assistance--the quickness of thought\nwith which you stripped off your coat and threw it over its head.\nAfter that I could see nothing except your rolling over and over\nin a confused mass. You are not hurt, I trust?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, sir,\" Harry said.\n\n\"And you have killed it--wonderful!\"\n\n\"There was nothing in that, sir. I have heard my father, who is a\ndoctor, say that a man could kill the biggest dog if he could get\nit down on its back and kneel on it. So when I once managed to get\nmy knees on it I felt it was all right.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is all very well for you to speak as if it were nothing!\"\nthe marquis said. \"There are few men, indeed, who would throw\nthemselves in the way of a mad dog, especially of such a formidable\nbrute as that. You too have behaved with courage, my son, and I\nsaw you were ready to give your life for your sisters; but you had\nnot the quickness and readiness of your friend, and would have been\ntoo late.\"\n\n\"It is true, father,\" Ernest said in a tone of humility. \"I should\nhave been too late, and, moreover, I should have been useless, for\nhe would have torn me down in a moment, and then fallen upon my\nsisters.  M. Sandwith,\" he said frankly, \"I own I have been wrong.\nI have thought the games of which you spoke, and your fighting, rough\nand barbarous; but I see their use now. You have put me to shame.\nWhen I saw that dog I felt powerless, for I had not my sword with\nme; but you--you rushed to the fight without a moment's hesitation,\ntrusting in your strength and your head. Yes, your customs have\nmade a man of you, while I am a boy still.\"\n\n\"You are very good to say so,\" Harry said; \"but I am quite sure that\nyou would be just as quick and ready as me in most circumstances,\nand if it had been a matter of swords, very much more useful; but I\nam glad you see there is some advantage in our rough English ways.\"\n\nThe marquis had put his hand approvingly upon Ernest's shoulder\nwhen he addressed Harry, and then turned to his daughters.  The\ngoverness had sunk fainting to the ground when she saw that the\ndanger was over. Virginie had thrown herself down and was crying\nloudly; while Jeanne stood pale, but quiet, beside them.\n\nThe marquis directed one of the men to run up to the chateau and\nbid a female servant bring down water and smelling-salts for the\ngoverness, and then lifted Virginie up and tried to soothe her,\nwhile he stretched out his other hand to Jeanne.\n\n\"You are shaken, my Jeanne,\" he said tenderly, \"but you have borne\nthe trial well. I did not hear you cry out, though madame, and the\nlittle one screamed loudly enough.\"\n\n\"I was frightened enough, father,\" she said simply, \"but of course\nI wasn't going to cry out; but it was very terrible; and oh, how\nnoble and brave he was! And you know, papa, I feel ashamed to think\nhow often I have been nearly laughing because he was awkward in\nthe minuet. I feel so little now beside him.\"\n\n\"You see, my dear, one must not judge too much by externals,\" her\nfather said soothingly as she hid her face against his coat, and he\ncould feel that she was trembling from head to foot. \"Older people\nthan you often do so, and are sorry for it afterwards; but as I am\nsure that you would never allow him to see that you were amused no\nharm has been done.\"\n\n\"Shall I thank him, papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, presently, my dear; he has just gone off with Ernest to see\nthem bury the dog.\"\n\nThis incident caused a considerable change in Harry's position in\nthe family. Previously he had been accepted in consequence of the\norders of the marquis. Although compelled to treat him as an equal\nthe two boys had in their hearts looked upon him as an inferior,\nwhile the girls had regarded him as a sort of tutor of their\nbrothers, and thus as a creature altogether indifferent to them.\nBut henceforth he appeared in a different light. Ernest acted up to\nthe spirit of the words he had spoken at the time, and henceforth\ntreated him as a comrade to be respected as well as liked. He tried\nto learn some of the English games, but as most of these required\nmore than two players he was forced to abandon them. He even asked\nhim to teach him to box, but Harry had the good sense to make\nexcuses for not doing so.  He felt that Ernest was by no means his\nmatch in strength, and that, with all his good-will, he would find\nit difficult to put up good-naturedly with being knocked about. He\ntherefore said that it could not be done without boxing-gloves, and\nthese it would be impossible to obtain in France; and that in the\nnext place he should hardly advise him to learn even if he procured\nthe gloves, for that in such contests severe bruises often were\ngiven.\n\n\"We think nothing of a black eye,\" he said laughing, \"but I am\nsure madame your mother would not be pleased to see you so marked;\nbesides, your people would not understand your motive in undertaking\nso rough an exercise, and you might lose somewhat of their respect.\nBe content, Count Ernest; you are an excellent swordsman, and\nalthough I am improving under M. du Tillet's tuition I shall never\nbe your match. If you like; sometime when we are out and away\nfrom observation we can take off our coats, and I can give you a\nlesson in wrestling; it is a splendid exercise, and it has not the\ndisadvantages of boxing.\"\n\nLittle Jules looked up to Harry as a hero, and henceforth, when\nthey were together, gave him the same sort of implicit obedience\nhe paid to his elder brother. The ceremonious habits of the age\nprevented anything like familiarity on the part of the younger\ngirls; but Jeanne and Virginie now always greeted him with a smile\nwhen they met, and joined in conversation with him as with their\nbrothers in the evening.\n\nThe marquise, who had formerly protested, if playfully, against\nher husband's whim in introducing an English boy into their family\ncircle, now regarded him with real affection, only refraining from\nconstant allusions to the debt she considered she owed him because\nshe saw that he really shrank from the subject.\n\nThe marquis shortly after this incident went to Paris for a fortnight\nto ascertain from his friends there the exact position of things.\nHe returned depressed and angry.\n\nThe violence of the Assembly had increased from day to day.  The\nproperty of all the convents had been confiscated, and this measure\nhad been followed by the seizure of the vast estates of the church.\nAll the privileges of the nobility had been declared at an end,\nand in August a decree had been passed abolishing all titles of\nnobility. This decree had taken effect in Paris and in the great\ntowns, and also in some parts of the country where the passions of\nthe people were most aroused against the nobility; but in Burgundy\nit had remained a dead letter. The Marquis de St. Caux was popular\nupon his estates, and no one had ever neglected to concede to\nhim and to the marquise their titles. He himself had regarded the\ndecree with disdain. \"They may take away my estates by force,\" he\nsaid, \"but no law can deprive me of my title, any more than of the\nname which I inherited from my fathers. Such laws as these are mere\noutbursts of folly.\"\n\nBut the Assembly continued to pass laws of the most sweeping\ndescription, assuming the sovereign power, and using it as no\nmonarch of France had ever ventured to do. Moderate men were shocked\nat the headlong course of events, and numbers of those who at the\ncommencement of the movement had thrown themselves heart and soul\ninto it now shrank back in dismay at the strange tyranny which was\ncalled liberty.\n\n\"It seems to me that a general madness has seized all Paris,\" the\nmarquis said to his wife on his return, \"but at present nothing can\nbe done to arrest it. I have seen the king and queen. His majesty is\nresolved to do nothing; that is, to let events take their course,\nand what that will be Heaven only knows. The Assembly has taken\nall power into its hands, the king is already a mere cipher, the\nviolence of the leaders of these men is beyond all bounds; the\nqueen is by turns hot and cold, at one moment she agrees with her\nhusband that the only hope lies in conceding  everything; at another\nshe would go to the army, place herself in its hands, and call on\nit to march upon Paris.\n\n\"At anyrate there is nothing to be done at present but to wait.\nAlready numbers of the deputies, terrified at the aspect of affairs,\nhave left France, and I am sorry to say many of the nobles have\nalso gone. This is cowardice and treachery to the king. We cannot\nhelp him if he will not be helped, but it is our duty to remain\nhere ready to rally round him when he calls us to his side. I am\nglad that the Assembly has passed a law confiscating the estates\nof all who have emigrated.\"\n\nAlthough the marquise was much alarmed at the news brought by her\nhusband she did not think of questioning his decision. It did not\nseem to her possible that there could be danger for her and hers\nin their quiet country chateau. There might be disturbance and\nbloodshed, and even revolution, in Paris; but surely a mere echo\nof this would reach them so far away.\n\n\"Whenever you think it is right to go up and take your place by\nthe king I will go and take mine by the queen,\" she said quietly.\n\"The children will be safe here; but of course we must do our duty.\"\n\nThe winter passed quietly at the chateau; there was none of the\nusual gaiety, for a deep gloom hung over all the noble families\nof the province; still at times great hunting parties were got up\nfor the chase of the wolves among the forests, for, when the snow\nwas on the ground, these often came down into the villages and\ncommitted great depredations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Demon Wolf\n\n\nUpon the first of these occasions Harry and Ernest were in high\nspirits, for they were to take part in the chase. It was the first\ntime that Ernest had done so, for during the previous winter the\nmarquis had been in attendance on the court. At an early hour the\nguests invited to take part in the chase began to assemble at the\nchateau.  Many who lived at a distance had come overnight, and\nthe great court-yard presented a lively aspect with the horses\nand attendants of the guests. A collation was spread in the great\nhall, and the marquise and her eldest daughter moved about among\nthe guests saying a few words of welcome to each.\n\n\"Who is that young man who is talking to mademoiselle your sister,\nErnest?\" Harry asked, for since the adventure with the mad dog the\nceremonious title had been dropped, and the boys addressed each\nother by their Christian names.\n\n\"That is Monsieur Lebat; he is the son of the Mayor of Dijon.  I\nhave not see him here before, but I suppose my father thinks it is\nwell in these times to do the civil thing to the people of Dijon.\nHe is a good-looking fellow too, but it is easy to see he is not\na man of good family.\"\n\n\"I don't like his looks at all,\" Harry said shortly. \"Look what a\ncringing air he puts on as he speaks to madame la marquise. And yet\nI fancy he could be insolent when he likes. He may be good-looking,\nbut it is not a style I admire, with his thick lips and his\nhalf-closed eyes. If I met him at home I should say the fellow was\nsomething between a butcher and a Jew pedlar.\"\n\n\"Well done, monsieur the aristocrat!\" Ernest said laughing.  \"This\nis your English equality! Here is a poor fellow who is allowed to\ntake a place our of his station, thanks to the circumstances of\nthe time, and you run him down mercilessly!\"\n\n\"I don't run him down because he is not a gentleman,\" Harry said.\n\"I run him down because I don't like his face; and if he were the\nson of a duke instead of the son of a mayor I should dislike it\njust as much. You take my word for it, Ernest, that's a bad fellow.\"\n\n\"Poor Monsieur Lebat!\" Ernest laughed. \"I daresay he is a very\ndecent fellow in his way.\n\n\"I am sure he is not, Ernest; he has a cruel bad look. I would not\nhave been that fellow's fag at school for any money.\n\n\"Well, it's fortunate, Harry, that you are not likely to see much\nof him, else I should expect to see you flying at his neck and\nstrangling him as you did the hound.\"\n\nHarry joined in the laugh.\n\n\"I will restrain myself, Ernest; and besides, he would be an awkward\ncustomer; there's plenty of strength in those shoulders of his, and\nhe looks active and sinewy in spite of that indolent air he puts\non; but there is the horn, it is time for us to mount.\"\n\nIn a few minutes some thirty gentlemen were in the saddle, the\nmarquis, who was grand louvetier of the province, blew his horn,\nand the whole cavalcade got into motion, raising their hunting\ncaps, as they rode off, to the marquise and her daughters, who were\nstanding on the step of the chateau to see them depart. The dogs\nhad already been sent forward to the forest, which was some miles\ndistant.\n\nOn arriving there the marquis found several woodmen, who had been\nfor the last two days marking the places most frequented by the\nwolves. They had given their reports and the party were just starting\nwhen a young forester rode up.\n\n\"Monsieur le marquis,\" he said, \"I have good news for you; the demon\nwolf is in the forest. I saw him making his way along a glade an\nhour since as I was on my way thither. I turned back to follow him,\nand tracked him to a ravine in the hills choked with undergrowth.\"\n\nThe news created great excitement.\n\n\"The demon wolf!\" the marquis repeated. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, monsieur. How could I mistake it! I saw him once four\nyears ago, and no one who had once done so could mistake any other\nwolf for him.\"\n\n\"We are in luck indeed, gentlemen,\" the marquis said. \"We will see\nif we can't bring this fellow's career to an end at last. I have\nhunted him a score of times myself since my first chase of him,\nwell-nigh fifteen years ago, but he has  always given us the slip.\"\n\n\"And will again,\" an old forester, who was standing close to Harry,\nmuttered. \"I do not believe the bullet is cast which will bring\nthat wolf to earth.\"\n\n\"What is this demon wolf?\" Harry asked Ernest.\n\n\"It is a wolf of extraordinary size and fierceness. For many years\nhe has been the terror of the mothers of this part of France. He\nhas been known to go into a village and boldly carry off an infant\nin mid-day. Every child who has been killed by wolves for years is\nalways supposed to have been slain by this wolf. Sometimes he is\nseen in one part of the province, and sometimes in another.\n\n\"For months he is not heard of. Then there is slaughter among the\nyoung lambs. A child going to school, or an old woman carrying\nhome a faggot from the forest is found torn and partly devoured,\nand the news spreads that the demon wolf has returned to the\nneighbourhood. Great hunts have over and over again been got up\nspecially to slay him, but he seems to lead a charmed life. He has\nbeen shot at over and over again, but he seems to be bullet-proof.\n\n\"The peasants regard him not as an ordinary wolf but as a demon,\nand mothers quiet their children when they cry by saying that if\nthey are not good the demon wolf will carry them off.  Ah, if we\ncould kill him to-day it would be a grand occasion!\"\n\n\"Is there anything particular about his appearance?\"\n\n\"Nothing except his size. Some of those who have seen him declare\nthat he is as big as three ordinary wolves; but my father, who has\ncaught sight of him several times, says that this is an exaggeration,\nthough he is by far the largest wolf he ever saw. He is lighter in\ncolour than other wolves, but those who saw him years ago say that\nthis was not the case then, and that his light colour must be due\nto his great age.\"\n\nThe party now started, under the guidance of the forester, to the\nspot where he had seen the wolf enter the underwood.\n\nIt was the head of a narrow valley. The sides which inclosed it\nsloped steeply, but not too much so for the wolf to climb. During\nthe last halt the marquis had arranged the plan of action. He\nhimself, with three of the most experienced huntsmen, took their\nstations across the valley, which was but seventy or eighty yards\nwide. Eight of the others were to dismount and take post on either\nside of the ravine.\n\n\"I am sorry, gentlemen, that I cannot find posts for the rest of\nyou, but you may have your share of the work. Over and over again\nthis wolf has slipped away when we thought we had him surrounded,\nand what he has done before he may do again. Therefore, let each of\nyou take up such a position as he thinks best outside our circle,\nbut keeping well behind trees or other shelter, so as to cover\nhimself from any random shot that may be fired after the wolf. Do\nyou, on your part, fire only when the wolf has passed your line,\nor you may hit some of us.\"\n\nThe two lads were naturally among those left out from the inner\ncircle.\n\n\"What do you think, Ernest; shall we remain on our horses here in\nthe valley or climb the hills?\"\n\n\"I should say wait here, Harry; in the first place, because it\nis the least trouble, and in the second, because I think he is as\nlikely to come this way as any other. At any rate we may as well\ndismount here, and let horses crop that piece of fresh grass until\nwe hear the horn that will tell us when the dogs have been turned\ninto the thicket to drive him out.\"\n\nIt was half an hour before they heard the distant note of the horn.\n\n\"They have begun,\" Ernest exclaimed; \"we had better mount at once.\nIf the brute is still there he is just as likely, being such an\nold hand at the sport, to make a bolt at once, instead of waiting\nuntil the dogs are close to him.\"\n\n\"What are we to do if we see him?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"We are to shoot him if we can. If we miss him, or he glides past\nbefore we can get a shot, we must follow shouting, so as to guide\nthe rest as to the direction he is taking.\"\n\n\"My chance of hitting him is not great,\" Harry said. \"I am not a\nvery good shot even on my feet; but sitting in my saddle I do not\nthink it likely I should get anywhere near him.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour passed. The occasional note of a dog and the\nshouts of the men encouraging them to work their way through the\ndense thicket could be heard, but no sound of a shot met their\nears.\n\n\"Either he is not there at all, or he is lying very close,\" Ernest\nsaid.\n\n\"Look, look!\" Harry said suddenly, pointing through the trees to\nthe right.\n\n\"That is the wolf, sure enough,\" Ernest exclaimed. \"Come along.\"\n\nThe two lads spurred their horses and rode recklessly through the\ntrees towards the great gray beast, who seemed to flit like a shadow\npast them.\n\n\"Mind the boughs, Ernest, or you will be swept from your saddle.\nHurrah! The trees are more open in front.\"\n\nBut although the horses were going at the top of their speed they\nscarcely seemed to gain on the wolf, who, as it seemed to them,\nkept his distance ahead without any great exertion.\n\n\"We shall never catch him,\" Harry exclaimed after they had ridden\nfor nearly half an hour, and the laboured panting of the horses\nshowed that they could not long maintain the pace.\n\nSuddenly, ten yards ahead of the wolf, a man, armed with\na hatchet, stepped out from behind a tree directly in its way. He\nwas a wood-cutter whose attention being called by the sound of the\ngalloping feet of the horses, had left his half-hewn tree and stepped\nout to see who was coming. He gave an exclamation of surprise and\nalarm as he saw the wolf, and raised his hatchet to defend himself.\nWithout a moment's hesitation the animal sprang upon him and\ncarried him to the ground, fixing its fangs into his throat. There\nwas a struggle for a few moments, and then the wolf left its lifeless\nfoe and was about to continue its flight.\n\n\"Get ready to fire, Harry,\" Ernest exclaimed as the wolf sprang\nupon the man, \"it is our last chance. If he gets away now we shall\nnever catch him.\"\n\nThey reined in their horses just as the wolf rose to fly. Harry\nfired first, but the movement of his panting horse deranged his aim\nand the bullet flew wide. More accustomed to firing on horseback,\nErnest's aim was truer, he struck the wolf on the shoulder, and\nit rolled over and over. With a shout of triumph the boys dashed\nforward, but when they were within a few paces the wolf leapt\nto its feet and endeavoured to spring towards them. Harry's horse\nwheeled aside so sharply that he was hurled from the saddle.\n\nThe shock was a severe one, and before he could rise to his\nfeet the wolf was close upon him. He tried as he rose to draw his\nhunting-sword, but before he could do so,  Ernest, who had, when he\nsaw him fall, at once leaped from his horse, threw himself before\nhim, and dealt the wolf a severe blow on the head with his weapon.\n\nFurious with rage and pain the wolf sprang upon him and seized\nhim by the shoulder. Ernest dropped his sword, and drawing his\nhunting-knife struck at it, while at the same moment Harry ran it\nthrough the body.\n\nSo strong and tenacious of life was the animal that the blows\nwere repeated several times before it loosed its hold of Ernest's\nshoulder and fell dead.\n\n\"Are you hurt, my dear Ernest?\" was Harry's first exclamation.\n\n\"Oh, never mind that, that's nothing,\" Ernest replied. \"Only think,\nHarry, you and I have killed the demon wolf, and no else had a hand\nin it. There is a triumph for us.\"\n\n\"The triumph is yours, Ernest,\" Harry said. \"He would have got away\nhad you not stopped him with your bullet, and he would have made\nshort work of me had you not come to my rescue, for I was half\nstunned with the fall, and he would have done for me as quickly as\nhe did for that poor fellow there.\"\n\n\"That is true, Harry, but it was you who gave him his mortal wound.\nHe would have mastered me otherwise. He was too strong for me, and\nwould have borne me to the ground. No, it's a joint business, and\nwe have both a right to be proud of it. Now let us fasten him on my\nhorse; but before we do that, you must bind up my shoulder somehow.\nIn spite of my thick doublet he has bit me very sharply. But first\nlet us see to this poor fellow. I fear he is dead.\"\n\nIt was soon seen that nothing could be done for the woodman, who\nhad been killed almost instantly. Harry, therefore, proceeded to\ncut off Ernest's coat-sleeve and bathed the wound. The flesh was\nbadly torn, and the arm was so useless that he thought that some\nbones were broken. Having done his best to bandage the wound,\nhe strapped the arm firmly across the body, so as to prevent its\nbeing shaken by the motion of the riding. It was with the greatest\ndifficulty that they were able to lift the body of the wolf, but\ncould not lay it across the horse, as the animal plunged and kicked\nand refused to allow it to be brought near. Ernest was able to\nassist but little, for now that the excitement was over he felt\nfaint and sick with the pain of his wound.\n\n\"I think you had better ride off, Harry, and bring some one to our\nassistance. I will wait here till you come back.\"\n\n\"I don't like to do that,\" Harry said. \"They must be seven or eight\nmiles away, and I may not be able to find them. They may have moved\naway to some other part of the forest. Ah! I have an idea!  Suppose\nI cut a pole, tie the wolf's legs together and put the pole through\nthem; then we can hoist the pole up and lash its ends behind the\ntwo saddles. The horses may not mind so much if it's not put upon\ntheir backs.\"\n\n\n\"That might do,\" Ernest agreed; \"but you mustn't make the pole more\nthan six or seven feet long, or we shall have difficulty in riding\nbetween the trees.\"\n\nThe pole was soon cut and the wolf in readiness to be lifted, but\nthe horses still refused to stand steady.\n\n\"Blindfold them, Harry,\" Ernest said suddenly, \"and tie them up to\ntwo trees a few feet apart.\"\n\nThis was soon done, and the boys then patted and soothed them until\nthey became quiet. The pole was now lifted, and this time they\nmanaged to lay it across the saddles and to lash it securely to\nthe cantles. Then they mounted, and taking the bandages off the\nhorses' eyes set out on their way. The horses were fidgety at first,\nbut presently fell into a quiet walk.\n\nFor upwards of an hour they heard nothing of the huntsmen.  Not a\nsound broke the stillness of the forest; the sun was shining through\nthe leafless trees, and they were therefore enabled to shape their\ncourse in the direction in which  they had come. Presently they\nheard the sound of a shot, followed by several others, and then\nthe bay of hounds. The sound came from their left.\n\n\"They have been trying a fresh place,\" Ernest said, \"and I expect\nthey have come upon two wolves; one they have shot, the hounds are\nafter the other.\"\n\nThey turned their horses' heads in the direction of the sounds,\nand presently Harry said:\n\n\"They are coming this way.\"\n\nLouder and louder grew the sounds of the chase; then the deep tones\nof the hounds were exchanged for a fierce angry barking.\n\n\"The wolf is at bay!\" Ernest exclaimed.\n\nA minute later some notes were sounded on the horn.\n\n\"That is the mort, Harry. We shall arrive before they move on\nagain.\"\n\nFive minutes later they rode into a glade where a number of horsemen\nwere assembled. There was a shout as they were seen.\n\n\"Why, Ernest,\" the marquis called as they approached, \"we thought\nyou had lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the\nmatter with your arm, and what have you got there?\"\n\n\"We have got the demon wolf,\" Ernest replied; \"so you haven't had\nall the sport to yourselves.\"\n\nThere was a general exclamation of surprise and almost incredulity,\nand then every one rode over to meet them, and when it was seen\nthat the object slung between the two horses was really the demon\nwolf there was a shout of satisfaction and pleasure. Again the\nnotes of the mort rang out through the woods, and every one crowded\nround the lads to congratulate them and to examine the dead monster.\nErnest was lifted from his horse, for he was now reeling in\nthe saddle, and could not have kept his seat many minutes longer.\nHis wound was carefully examined, and the marquis pronounced\nthe shoulder-bone to be broken. A litter was made  and four of\nthe foresters hoisted him upon their shoulders, while four others\ncarried the wolf, still slung on its pole, behind the litter. While\nthe preparations were being made Harry had given the history of the\nslaying of the wolf, saying that he owed his life to the quickness\nand courage of Ernest.\n\n\"And I owe mine to him,\" Ernest protested from the bank where he\nwas lying. \"The wolf would have killed me had he not slain it. I\nwas lucky in stopping it with a ball, but the rest was entirely a\njoint affair.\"\n\nThe slaying of the demon wolf was so important an event that no\none thought of pursuing the hunt further that day. The other two\nwolves were added to the procession, but they looked small and\ninsignificant beside the body of that killed by the boys. Harry\nlearned that no one had suspected that they had gone in pursuit of\nthe wolf.  A vigilant look-out had been kept all round the thicket,\nwhile the dogs hunted it from end to end, but no signs had been seen\nof it, and none were able to understand how it could have slipped\nbetween the watchers unseen.\n\nAfter the ravine had been thoroughly beaten the party had moved\noff to another cover. On their way there the marquis had missed\nthe two boys. No one had seen them, and it was supposed that they\nhad loitered behind in the forest. Two or three notes of recall had\nbeen blown, and then no one had thought more of the matter until\nthey rode into the glade when the second wolf had just been pulled\ndown by the pack.\n\nIt was afternoon when the hunting party arrived at the chateau.\nBefore they started homewards the marquis had sent off two horsemen;\none to Dijon to bring a surgeon with all speed to the chateau,\nthe other to tell the marquise that Ernest had been hurt, and that\neverything was to be got in readiness for him; but that she was not\nto make herself uneasy, as the injury was not a serious one.  The\nmessengers were charged strictly to say nothing about the death of\nthe demon wolf.\n\nThe marquise and her daughters were at the entrance as the party\narrived. The sight of the litter added to the anxiety which Ernest's\nmother was feeling; but the marquis rode on a short distance ahead\nto her.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, Julie,\" he said; \"the lad is not very seriously\nhurt. He has been torn a bit by a wolf, and has behaved splendidly.\"\n\n\"The messenger said he had been hurt by a wolf, Edouard; but how\ncame he to put himself in such peril?\"\n\n\"He will tell you all about it, my dear. Here he is to speak for\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Do not look so alarmed, mother,\" Ernest said as she ran down to\nthe side of the litter. \"It is no great harm, and I should not have\nminded if it had been ten times as bad.\"\n\n\"Bring up the wolf,\" the marquis said, \"and Harry, do you come\nhere and stand by Ernest's side. Madam la marquise,\" he went on,\n\"do you see that great gray wolf? That is the demon wolf which has\nfor years been the terror of the district, and these are its slayers.\nYour son and M. Sandwith, they, and they alone, have reaped the\nglory which every sportsman in Burgundy has been so long striving\nto attain; they alone in the forest, miles away from the hunt,\npursued and slew this scourge of the province.\"\n\nHe put his horn to his lips. The others who carried similar\ninstruments followed his example. A triumphant traralira was blown.\nAll present took off their hunting-caps and cheered, and the hounds\nadded their barking to the chorus.\n\n\"Is it possible, Edward,\" the marquise said, terrified at the\nthought of the danger her son must have run in an encounter with\nthe dreaded beast, \"is it possible that these two alone have slain\nthis dreadful wolf?\"\n\n\"It is quite possible, my dear, since it has been done, though,\nhad you asked me yesterday, I should almost have said that it could\nnot be; however, there it is. Ernest and his brave young friend\nhave covered themselves with glory; they will be the heroes of the\ndepartment. But we must not stay talking here. We must get Ernest\ninto bed as soon as possible. A surgeon will be here very shortly.\nI sent a messenger on to Dijon for one at the same time I sent to\nyou.\"\n\nThe marquis stayed outside for a few minutes while the domestics\nhanded round great silver cups full of spiced wine, and then bidding\ngood-bye to his guests entered the chateau just as the surgeon rode\nup to the entrance.\n\n\"Please tell us all about it,\" his daughters asked him when,\nhaving seen the surgeon set the broken bone and bandage the wound,\noperations which Ernest bore with stoical firmness, he went down\nto the salon where his daughters were anxiously expecting him. \"All\nabout it, please. We have heard nothing, for Harry went upstairs\nwith Ernest, and has not come down again.\"\n\nThe marquis told the whole story, how the wolf had made his escape\nunseen through the cordon round his lair, and had passed within the\nsight of the two boys some distance away, and how they had hunted\nit down and slain it. The girls shuddered at the story of the death\nof the wood-cutter and the short but desperate conflict with the\nwolf.\n\n\"Then Ernest has the principal honour this time,\" the eldest girl\nsaid.\n\n\"It is pretty evenly divided,\" the marquis said. \"You see Ernest\nbrought the wolf to bay by breaking its shoulder, and struck the\nfirst blow as it was flying upon Harry, who had been thrown from\nhis horse. Then, again, Ernest would almost certainly have been\nkilled had not Harry in his turn come to his assistance and dealt\nit its mortal blows. There is not much difference, but perhaps the\nchief honours rest with Ernest.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, papa,\" Mademoiselle de St. Caux said; \"it is\nonly right the chief honour should be with your son and not with\nthis English boy. He has had more than his share already, I think.\"\n\n\"You would not think so if he had saved your life, sister,\" Jeanne\nbroke in impetuously. \"It was very brave of them both to kill the\nwolf; but I think it was ever, ever so much braver to attack a\ngreat mad dog without weapons. Don't you think so, papa?\"\n\n\"I don't think you should speak so warmly to your elder sister,\nJeanne,\" the marquis said; \"she is a grown-up young lady, and you\nare in the school-room. Still, in answer to your question, I admit\nthat the first was very much the braver deed. I myself should have\nliked nothing better than to stand before that great wolf with my\nhunting sword in my hand; but although if I had been near you when\nthe hound attacked you, I should doubtless have thrown myself before\nyou, I should have been horribly frightened and should certainly\nhave been killed; for I should never have thought of or carried so\npromptly out the plan which Harry adopted of muzzling the animal.\nBut there is no need to make comparisons. On the present occasion\nboth the lads have behaved with great bravery, and I am proud that\nErnest is one of the conquerors of the demon wolf. It will start\nhim in life with a reputation already established for courage.\nNow, come with me and have a look at the wolf. I don't think such\na beast was ever before seen in France. I am going to have him\nstuffed and set up as a trophy. He shall stand over the  fireplace\nin the hall, and long after we have all mouldered to dust our\ndescendants will point to it proudly, telling how a lad of their\nrace, with another his own age, slew the demon wolf of Burgundy.\"\n\nErnest was confined to his bed for nearly a month, and during\nthis time Harry often went long rides and walks by himself. In the\nevening the marquis frequently talked with him over the situation\nof the country and compared the events which had taken place with\nthe struggle of the English parliament with the king.\n\n\"There was one point of difference between the two cases,\" he said\none evening. \"In England the people had already great power in\nthe state. The parliament had always been a check upon the royal\nauthority; and it was because the king tried to overrule parliament\nthat the trouble came about. Here our kings, or at least the ministers\nthey appointed, have always governed; often unwisely I admit, but\nis it likely that the mob would govern better? That is the question.\nAt present they seem bent on showing their incapacity to govern\neven themselves.\"\n\nThe Marquis de St. Caux had, in some respects, the thoughts and\nopinions of the old school. He was a royalist pure and simple.  As\nto politics, he troubled his head little about them. These were a\nmatter for ministers. It was their business to find a remedy for\nthe general ills. As to the National Assembly which represented\nonly the middle class and people, he regarded it with contempt.\n\n\"Why, it was from the middle class,\" he said, \"that the oppressors\nof the people were drawn. It is they who were farmers-general,\ncollectors, and officials of all kinds. It is  they who ground\ndown the nation and enriched themselves with the spoil. It is not\nthe nobles who dirtied their hands with money wrung from the poor.\nBy all means let the middle class have a share in the government;\nbut it is not a share they desire. The clergy are to have no voice;\nthe nobility are to have no voice; the king himself is to be a\ncipher. All power is to be placed in the hands of these men, the\nchosen of the scum of the great towns, the mere mouthpieces of the\nignorant mob. It is not order that these gentry are organizing, it\nis disorder.\"\n\nSuch were the opinions of the marquis, but he was tolerant of other\nviews, and at the gatherings at the chateau Harry heard opinions\nof all kinds expressed.\n\nDuring his rambles alone he entered as much as he could into\nconversation with the peasants, with woodcutters, foresters, and\nvillagers. He found that the distress which prevailed everywhere\nwas terrible. The people scarcely kept life together, and many\nhad died of absolute starvation. He found a feeling of despair\neverywhere, and a dull hatred of all who were above them in the\nworld. Harry had difficulty in making them talk, and at first could\nobtain only sullen monosyllables. His dress and appearance showed\nhim to belong to the hated classes, and set them against him at\nonce; but when he said that he was English, and that in England\npeople were watching with great interest what was passing in France,\nthey had no hesitation in speaking.\n\nHarry's motives in endeavouring to find out what were the feelings\nof the people at large, were not those of mere curiosity. He was\nnow much attached to the marquis and his family; and the reports\nwhich came from all parts of France, as well as from Paris, together\nwith the talk among the visitors at the chateau, convinced him that\nthe state of affairs was more serious than the marquis was inclined\nto admit. The capture of the Bastille and the slaughter of its\ndefenders--the massacres of persons obnoxious to the mob, not only\nin the streets of Paris but in those of other great towns, proved\nthat the lower class, if they once obtained the upper hand, were\nready to go all lengths; while the number of the nobility who were\nflocking across the frontier showed that among this body there\nexisted grievous apprehensions as to the future.\n\nHarry had read in a book in the library of the chateau an account\nof the frightful excesses perpetrated by the Jacquerie. That dreadful\ninsurrection had been crushed out by the armour-clad knights of\nFrance; but who was to undertake the task should such a flame again\nburst out? The nobles no longer wore armour, they had no armed\nretainers; they would be a mere handful among a multitude. The\narmy had already shown its sympathy with the popular movement, and\ncould not be relied upon. That the marquis himself should face out\nany danger which might come seemed to Harry right and natural; but\nhe thought that he was wrong not to send his wife and daughters, and\nat any rate Jules, across the Rhine until the dangers were passed.\n\nBut the marquis had no fears. Some one had mentioned the Jacquerie\nin one of their conversations, but the marquis had put it aside as\nbeing altogether apart from the question.\n\n\"The Jacquerie took place,\" he said, \"hundreds of years ago.  The\npeople then were serfs and little more than savages. Can we imagine\nit possible that at this day the people would be capable of such\nexcesses?\"\n\nThe answer of the gentleman he addressed had weighed little with\nthe marquis, but Harry thought over it seriously.\n\n\"Civilization has increased, marquis, since the days of the Jacquerie,\nbut the condition of the people has improved but little.  Even now\nthe feudal usages are scarce extinct. The lower class have been\nregarded as animals rather than men; and the increase of civilization\nwhich you speak of, and from which they have received no benefit,\nmakes them hate even more bitterly than of old those in position\nabove them.\n\n\"I am a reformer; I desire to see sweeping changes; I want a good,\nwise, and honest government; and I desire these things because\nI fear that, if they do not come peacefully they will come in a\ntempest of lawlessness and vengeance.\"\n\n\"Well, they are getting all they want,\" the marquis said peevishly.\n\"They are passing every law, however absurd, that comes into their\nhands. No one is opposing them. They have got the reins in their\nown hands. What on earth can they want more? There might have been\nan excuse for rebellion and riot two years since--there can be\nnone now. What say you, abbe?\"\n\nThe abbe seldom took part in conversations on politics, but, being\nnow appealed to, he said mildly:\n\n\"We must allow for human nature, monsieur. The slave who finds\nhimself free, with arms in his hands, is not likely to settle down\nat once into a peaceful citizen. Men's heads are turned with the\nchanges the last two years have brought about. They are drunk with\ntheir own success, and who can say where they will stop? So far\nthey find no benefit from the changes. Bread is as dear as ever,\nmen's pockets are as empty. They thought to gain everything--they\nfind they have got nothing; and so they will cry for more and more\nchange, their fury will run higher and higher with each  disappointment,\nand who can say to what lengths they will go? They have already\nconfiscated the property of the church, next will come that of the\nlaity.\"\n\n\"I had no idea you were such a prophet of evil, abbe,\" the marquis\nsaid with an uneasy laugh, while feelings of gloom and anxiety fell\nover the others who heard the abbe's words.\n\n\"God forbid that I should be a prophet!\" the old man said gravely.\n\"I hope and trust that I am mistaken, and that He has not reserved\nthis terrible punishment for France. But you asked me for my opinion,\nmarquis, and I have given it to you.\"\n\nDespite these forebodings the winter of 1790 passed without\ndisturbance at the chateau.\n\nIn the spring came news of disorder, pillage, and acts of ruffianism\nin various parts. Chateaux and convents were burned and destroyed,\nand people refused to pay either their taxes or rents to their\nlandlords. In the south the popular excitement was greater than in\nother parts. In Burgundy there was for the most part tranquility;\nand the marquis, who had always been regarded as an indulgent\nseigneur by the people of his estate, still maintained that these\ntroubles only occurred where the proprietors had abused their\nprivileges and ground down the people.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Clouds Gather\n\n\nOccasionally and at considerable intervals Harry received letters\nfrom his father. The latter said that there was great excitement\nin England over the events which had taken place in France, and\nthat his mother was rendered extremely anxious by the news of the\nattacks upon chateaux, and the state of tumult and lawlessness\nwhich prevailed. They thought he had better resign his situation\nand return home.\n\nHarry in his replies made light of the danger, and said that after\nhaving been treated so kindly it would be most ungrateful of him\nto break the engagement he had made for three years, and leave his\nfriends at the present moment. Indeed, he, like all around him,\nwas filled with the excitement of the time. In spite of the almost\nuniversal confusion and disorder, life went on quietly and calmly\nat the chateau.  The establishment was greatly reduced, for few of\nthe tenants paid their rents; but the absence of ceremonial brought\nthe family closer together, and the marquis and his wife agreed that\nthey had never spent a happier time than the spring and summer of\n1791.\n\nThe news of the failure of the king's attempt at flight on the\n20th of June was a great shock to the marquis. \"A king should never\nfly,\" he said; \"above all, he should never make an abortive attempt\nat flight. It is lamentable that he should be so ill-advised.\"\n\nAt the end of September the elections to the Legislative Assembly as\nit was now to be called, resulted in the return of men even more\nextreme and violent than those whom they succeeded.\n\n\"We must go to Paris,\" the marquis said one day towards the end of\nOctober. \"The place for a French nobleman now is beside the king.\"\n\n\"And that of his wife beside the queen,\" the marquise said quietly.\n\n\"I cannot say no,\" the marquis replied. \"I wish you could have stayed\nwith the children, but they need fear no trouble here.  Ernest is\nnearly seventeen, and may well begin, in my absence, to represent\nme. I think we can leave the chateau without anxiety, but even were\nit not so it would still be our duty to go.\"\n\n\"There is another thing I want to speak to you about before we\nstart,\" the marquise said. \"Jeanne is no longer a child, although\nwe still regard her as one; she is fifteen, and she is graver\nand more earnest than most girls of her age. It seems ridiculous\nto think of such a thing, but it is clear that she has made this\nEnglish lad her hero. Do you not think it better that he should\ngo? It would be unfortunate in the extreme that she should get to\nhave any serious feelings for him.\"\n\n\"I have noticed it too, Julie,\" the marquis said, \"and have smiled\nto myself to see how the girl listens gravely to all he says, but\nI am not disposed to send him away. In the first place, he has done\na great deal of good to the boys, more even than I had hoped for.\nErnest now thinks and speaks for himself, his ideas are broader, his\nviews wider. He was fitted before for the regime that has passed;\nhe is rapidly becoming fit to take his part in that which is to\ncome.\n\n\"In the next place, my dear, you must remember the times have\nchanged. Mademoiselle Jeanne de St. Caux, daughter of a peer and\nnoble of France, was infinitely removed from the son of an English\ndoctor; but we seem to be approaching the end of all things;\nand although so far the law for the abolition of titles has been\ndisregarded here, you must prepare yourself to find that in Paris\nyou will be no longer addressed by your title, and I shall be\nMonsieur de St. Caux; or may be they will object both to the de\nand the St., and I shall find myself plain Monsieur Caux.\"\n\n\"Oh, Edouard!\" the marquise exclaimed aghast.\n\n\"I am quite in earnest, my dear, I can assure you. You will say\nshe is still the heiress of a portion of our estates, but who can\nsay how long the estates will remain after the title is gone? Just\nas the gentlemen of the pave object to titles because they have\nnone themselves, so being penniless they will object to property,\nand for aught I know may decree a general division of lands and\ngoods.\"\n\n\"Impossible, Edouard!\"\n\n\"Not at all impossible, Julie. The beggars are on horseback, and\nthey intend to ride. Last week I called in from my bankers, all\nthe cash at my disposal, about five thousand louis, and to-morrow\ndu Tillet is going to start for Holland. He will hand it over to\na banker there to forward to Dr. Sandwith, to whom I have written\nasking him to undertake the charge. If you will take my advice you\nwill forward at the same time all your jewelry. If things go wrong\nit will keep us in our old age and furnish a dot for our daughters.\n\n\"The jewels of the St. Caux have always been considered as equal\nto those of any family in France, and are certainly worth half a\nmillion francs even to sell. Keep a few small trinkets, and send\nall the others away.  But I have wandered from my subject. Under\nthese circumstances I think it as well that we should not interfere\nin the matter you speak of. Personally one could not wish for a\nbetter husband for one of our daughters than this young Englishman\nwould make.\n\n\"His father is a gentleman, and so is he, and in such times as\nare coming I should be glad to know that one of my girls had such\na protector as he would make her; but this is, as you said at first,\nalmost ridiculous. He is two years older than she is, but in some\nrespects she is the elder; he regards her as a pretty child, and\nall his thoughts are given to his studies and his sports.\n\n\"He has something of the English barbarian left in him, and is\nabsolutely indifferent to Jeanne's preference. A French lad at his\nage would be flattered. This English boy does not notice it, or if\nhe notices it regards it as an exhibition of gratitude, which he\ncould well dispense with, for having saved her life.\n\n\"You can leave them with a tranquil heart, my dear. I will answer\nfor it that never in his inmost heart has the idea of his ever\nmaking love to Jeanne occurred to this English lad. Lastly I should\nbe sorry for him to leave, because his good spirits and cheerfulness\nare invaluable at present. Ernest is apt to be gloomy and depressed,\nand cheerfulness is at a premium in France at present. Moreover,\nshould there be any difficulty or danger while we are absent I trust\nvery much to that lad's good sense and courage. That incident of\nthe dog showed how quick he is to plan and how prompt to carry his\nplans into effect. It may seem absurd when there are several of\nour staunch and tried friends here to rely in  any way on a lad,\nbut I do so.  Not, of course, as before our faithful friends, but\nas one whose aid is not to be despised.\"\n\nThus it happened that on the same day that the marquis started for\nParis, M. du Tillet set out from the chateau taking with him some\ntrunks and packages which appeared but of little value and were\nnot likely to attract attention, but which contained a considerable\nsum of money and the famous St. Caux jewels.\n\nLife at the chateau was dull after the departure of its heads.  They\nhad few visitors now; the most frequent among them being Victor\nde Gisons. The estates of the duke, his father, adjoined those of\nthe marquis, and between him and Marie a marriage had long before\nbeen arranged by their parents. For once the inclination of the\nyoung people agreed with the wishes of the elders, and they were\nwarmly attached to each other. No formal betrothal, however, had\nas yet taken place, the troubles of the times having caused its\npostponement, although formerly it had been understood that in the\npresent autumn the marriage should be celebrated.\n\nThe young count had at the assembly of the States General been\na prominent liberal, and had been one of those who had taken his\nseat with the third estate and had voted for the abolition of the\nspecial privileges of the nobility, but the violence of the Assembly\nhad alarmed and disgusted him, and in the winter he had left Paris\nand returned to his father's estates.\n\nErnest and Harry studied with the abbe, and fenced and rode as usual\nwith M. du Tillet after his return from Holland. The ever-darkening\ncloud weighed upon their  spirits, and yet life at the chateau was\npleasant. The absence of their parents and the general feeling of\nanxiety knit the rest of the family closer together. Much of the\nceremonial observance which had, on his first arrival, surprised\nand amused Harry was now laid aside. Marie, happy in the visits\nof her lover and at the prospect of her approaching marriage, did\nher best to make the house cheerful. Harry, who had not much liked\nher at first, now found her most pleasant and agreeable, and the\nyounger girls walked in the grounds with their brothers and chatted\nwhen they were gathered in the evening just as Harry's sisters had\ndone at home. Jeanne was, if the group broke up, generally Harry's\ncompanion. Ever since the affair of the mad dog she had treated\nhim as her special friend, adopting all his  opinions and falling\nin with any suggestion he might make with a readiness which caused\nErnest one day to say laughingly to Harry:\n\n\"One would think, Harry that you were Jeanne's elder brother, not\nI. She listens to you with a good deal more deference than she does\nto me.\"\n\nThe winter came and went. From time to time letters arrived from\nParis, but the news was always in the same strain. Things were going\nworse and worse, the king was little more than a prisoner in the\nhands of the people of Paris. The violence of the Assembly was\never on the increase, the mob of Paris were the real masters of\nthe situation, the greater part of the nobility had fled, and any\nwho appeared in the streets were liable to insult.\n\nThe feeling in the provinces kept pace with that in Paris.  Committees\nwere formed in every town and village and virtually superseded the\nconstituted authorities. Numbers of chateaux were burned, and the\npeasants almost universally refused any longer to pay the dues to\ntheir seigneurs. But at present none dreamt of personal danger.\nThe nobles who emigrated did so because they found the situation\nintolerable, and hoped that an army would be shortly raised and\nset in motion by foreign powers to put down the movement which\nconstituted a danger to kings, nobles, and property all over Europe.\nBut as yet there was nothing to foreshadow the terrible events\nwhich were to take place, or to indicate that a movement, which\nbegan in the just demand of an oppressed people for justice and\nfair treatment, would end in that people becoming a bloodthirsty\nrabble, eager to destroy all who were above them in birth, education,\nor intellect.\n\nTherefore, although the Marquis de St. Caux foresaw the possibility\nof confiscation of the property and abolition of all the privileges\nof the nobility, he was under no uneasiness whatever as to the\nsafety of his children.  His instructions were precise: that if a\nsmall party of peasants attacked the chateau, and it was evident\nthat a successful resistance could be made, M. du Tillet should\nsend word down to the mayor of Dijon and ask for help, and should,\nwith the servants of the chateau, defend it; if it was attacked by\na large mob, no resistance was to be offered, but he was to abandon\nit at once and journey to Paris with the children. But the time\nwent on without disturbance. In Dijon as elsewhere a  committee\nhad been formed and had taken into its hands the entire control of\nthe management of the town. At its head was the son of the mayor,\nMonsieur Lebat.\n\n\"I do not understand that young fellow,\" M. du Tillet said one day\non his return from Dijon. \"I do not like him; he is ambitious and\npushing, he is the leader of the advanced party in Dijon, and is\nin communication with the most violent spirits in Paris, but I am\nbound to say that he appears most anxious to be of service to the\nfamily. Whenever I see him he assures me of his devotion to the\nmarquis. To-day, Mademoiselle Marie, he prayed me to assure you\nthat you need feel no uneasiness, for that he held the mob in his\nhand, and would answer for it that no hostile movement should be\nmade against the chateau, and in fact I know, for I have taken the\nprecaution of buying the services of a man who is upon the committee,\nthat Lebat has actually exerted himself to benefit us.\n\n\"It has several times been urged by the most violent section that\nthe mob should be incited to attack the chateau, but he has each\ntime successfully opposed the proposition. He has declared that while\nno one is more hostile than himself to the privileges of seigneury,\nand while he would not only abolish the nobles as a class but\nconfiscate their possessions, he considers that in the case of the\nmarquis nothing should be done until a decree to that effect is\npassed by the Assembly.\n\n\"Until that time, he argues, the people should discriminate.  The\nchateaux of tyrants should be everywhere levelled to the ground,\nbut it would be unworthy of the people to take measures of vengeance\nagainst those who have not notably ground down those dependent upon\nthem, and that, as the marquis has not pushed the privilege of his\nclass to the utmost, his chateau and property should be respected\nuntil the Assembly pass a decree upon the subject.\"\n\n\"I am sure we are much indebted to this Monsieur Lebat,\" Marie\nsaid. \"He was here at the hunting party and seemed a worthy young\nman of his class. Of course he was out of place among us, but for\na man in his position he seemed tolerable.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Monsieur du Tillet agreed, but in a somewhat doubtful tone\nof voice. \"So far as assurances go there is nothing to be desired,\nand he has, as I said, so far acted loyally up to them, and\nyet somehow I do not like him. It strikes me that he is playing a\ngame, although what that game is I cannot say.  At  anyrate I do\nnot trust him; he speaks smoothly but I think he has a double face,\nand that he is cruel and treacherous.\"\n\n\"That is not like you, Monsieur du Tillet,\" Marie laughed, \"you\nwho generally have a good word for everyone. It seems to me that\nyou are hard upon the young man, who appears to be animated by\nexcellent sentiments towards us.\"\n\nSpring came again. M. du Tillet learned that the mob of Dijon were\nbecoming more and more violent, and that spies and watchmen had\nbeen told off to see that none of the family attempted to fly for\nthe frontier. He therefore wrote to the marquis urging that it\nwould be better that the family should move to Paris, where they\nwould be in no danger. In reply he received a letter begging him\nto start as soon as the roads were fit for travel.\n\nAbout the same time Victor de Gisons received a summons from his\nfather to join him in Paris.\n\nThe messenger who brought the letter to M. du Tillet brought one\nalso for Marie from the marquise, saying that the heads of both\nfamilies were of opinion that the marriage must be still further\npostponed, as in the present state of affairs all private plans and\ninterests must be put aside in view of the dangers that surrounded\nthe king. Marie acquiesced in the decision, and bade her lover\nadieu calmly and bravely.\n\n\"They are quite right, Victor; I have felt for some time that when\nFrance was on the verge of a precipice it was not the time for her\nnobles to be marrying. Noblesse oblige. If we were two peasants\nwe might marry and be happy. As it is we must wait, even though we\nknow that waiting may never come to an end. I have a conviction,\nVictor, that our days of happiness are over, and that terrible\nthings are about to happen.\"\n\n\"But nothing that can happen can separate us, Marie.\"\n\n\"Nothing but death, Victor,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"But surely, Marie, you take too gloomy a view. Death, of course,\nmay separate all lovers; but there seems no reason that we should\nfear him now more than at other times. A few farmers-general and\nothers who have made themselves obnoxious to the mob have been\nkilled, but what is that! There should at least be no hostility\nto our order. Many of the nobles have  been foremost in demanding\nreforms. All have cheerfully resigned their privileges. There is\nno longer the slightest reason for hostility against us.\"\n\n\"My dear Victor,\" Marie said quietly, \"you do not ask a wild beast\nabout to rend his prey, what is the reason for his actions. I hope\nI may be wrong; but at least, dear, we shall see each other again\nbefore long, and, whatever troubles may come, will share them. My\nmother in her letter yesterday said that she and the marquis had\ndetermined that we should join them in Paris; for that although the\ndisorders have abated somewhat they are anxious at the thought of\nour being alone here, and in the present position of things they\nhave no hope of being able to leave the king. She says my father\nis very indignant at the great emigration of the nobility that\nis going on. In the first place, he holds that they are deserting\ntheir post in the face of the enemy; and in the second place, by\ntheir assemblage across the frontier and their intrigues at foreign\ncourts against France they are causing the people to look with\nsuspicion upon the whole class.\"\n\n\"You have kept your good news till the last, Marie,\" Victor said.\n\"Here have we been saying good-bye, and it seems that we are going\nto meet again very shortly.\"\n\n\"I have been bidding farewell,\" Marie said, \"not to you, but to\nour dream of happiness. We shall meet soon, but I fear that will\nnever return.\"\n\n\"You are a veritable prophet of ill to-day, Marie,\" Victor said\nwith an attempt at gaiety. \"Some day, I hope, dear, that we shall\nsmile together over your gloomy prognostication.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Victor--I pray God it may be so!\"\n\nA week later three carriages arrived from Paris to convey the\nfamily there; and upon the following day the whole party started;\nthe girls, the gouvernante, the abbe, and some of the female servants\noccupying the carriages, Monsieur du Tillet, the boys, and several\nof the men riding beside them as an escort.\n\nThey met with no interruption on the road, and arrived in Paris\non the last day of April, 1792. Harry was glad at the change. The\ndoings at Paris had been the subject of conversation and thought for\nnearly two years, and he had caught the excitement which pervaded\nFrance. He was tired of the somewhat monotonous life in the country,\nand had for some time been secretly  longing to be at the centre\nof interest, and to see for himself the stirring events, of which\nlittle more than a feeble echo had reached them at the chateau.\n\nThe change of life was great indeed; the marquis had thrown himself\ninto the thick of all that was going on, and his salon was crowded\nevery evening with those of the nobility who still remained In\nParis. But he was regarded as by no means a man of extreme views,\nand many of the leaders of the party of the Gironde with whose names\nHarry was familiar were also frequent visitors--Roland, Vergniaud,\nLanjuinais, Brissot, Guader, Lebrun, and Condorcer.\n\nHarry was struck with the variety of conversation that went on at\nthese meetings. Many of the young nobles laughed and chatted with\nthe ladies with as much gaiety as if the former state of things\nwere continuing undisturbed; and an equal indifference to the public\nstate of things was shown by many of the elders, who sat down and\ndevoted themselves to cards. Others gathered apart in little groups\nand discussed gloomily and in low tones the events of the day;\nwhile others who were more liberal in their views gathered round the\ndeputies of the Gironde and joined in their talk upon the meetings\nof the Assembly and the measures which were necessary to consolidate\nthe work of reform, and to restore peace and happiness to France.\n\nThe marquis moved from group to group, equally at home with all,\nchatting lightly with the courtiers, whispering gravely with the\nelders, or discussing with the tone of the man of the world the\nviews and opinions of the deputies. Victor de Gisons was constantly\nat the house, and strove by his cheerfulness and gaiety to dissipate\nthe shade of melancholy which still hung over Marie.\n\nTowards the end of July the Marquis de St. Caux and the little\nbody of royalists who still remained faithful to the king became\nmore and more anxious; the position of the royal family was now\nmost precarious; most of the troops in Paris had been sent to the\nfrontier, and those left behind were disorganized and ready to join\nthe mob.  Two out of the three Swiss battalions had been sent away\nand but one remained at the Tuileries. Of the National Guard only\nthe battalion of Filles St. Thomas and part of the battalion of\nthe Saints Pares could be trusted to defend the king. The rest were\nopposed to him, and would certainly join the populace.\n\nOn the 14th of July a large number of National Guards from the\nprovinces had arrived in Paris; and the battalion from Marseilles,\nthe most violent of all, had, immediately that it arrived in the\ncity, come into collision with one of the loyal battalions.\n\nThe royalists were wholly without organization, their sole aim\nbeing to defend the king should he be in danger, and if necessary\nto die by his side.\n\nOn the evening before the 10th of August the tocsin was heard to\nsound and the drums to beat to arms. All day there had been sinister\nrumours circulating, but the king had sent privately to his friends\nthat the danger was not imminent and that he had no need of them;\nhowever, as soon as the alarm sounded the marquis snatched up a\nsword and prepared to start for the palace. He embraced his wife,\nwho was calm but very pale, and his children. Ernest asked to be\nallowed to go with him, but the marquis said:\n\n\"No, my son, my life is the king's; but yours at present is due\nto your mother and sisters.\"\n\nIt was twenty-four hours before he returned. His clothes were torn,\nhis head was bound up, and one of his arms disabled. The marquise\ngave a cry of delight as he entered. No one had slept since he\nleft, for every hour fresh rumours of fighting had arrived, and\nthe sound of cannon and musketry had been heard in the early part\nof the day.\n\n\"It is all over, wife!\" he said. \"We have done our best, but the\nking will do nothing. We cannot say we have lost the battle, for\nwe have never tried to win it; but it would be the same thing in\nthe long run.\"\n\nBefore hearing what had passed the marquise insisted upon her husband\ntaking refreshment and having his wounds bound up and attended to.\nWhen he had finished his meal the marquis began:\n\n\"We had a good deal of difficulty in getting into the Tuileries,\nfor the National Guard tried to prevent our passing. However, we\nmost of us got through; and we found that there were about a hundred\nassembled, almost all men of family. The Marshal de Mailly led us\ninto the king's apartment.\n\n\"'Sire,' he said, 'here are your faithful nobles, eager to replace\nyour majesty on the throne of your ancestors.' The National Guard\nin the palace withdrew at once, leaving us alone with the Swiss.\n\n\"We formed in the courtyard; and the king, with his hat in his hand,\nwalked down our ranks and those of the Swiss. He seemed without\nfear, but he did not speak a word, and did nothing to encourage us.\nSeveral of our party, in trying to make their way to the palace,\nhad been murdered, and the mob cut off their heads and put them on\npikes; and these were paraded in the streets within sight of the\nwindows. Roederer, the procureur-general of the department of Paris,\ncame to the king and pressed him to leave the Tuileries.\n\n\"'There are not five minutes to lose, sire,' he said. 'There is no\nsafety for your majesty but in the National Assembly.'\n\n\"The queen resisted; but upon Roederer saying that an enormous\ncrowd with cannon were coming, and that delay would endanger the\nlives of the whole of the royal family, he went. But he thought of\nus, and asked what was to become of us. Roederer said that, as we\nwere not in uniform, by leaving our swords behind us we could pass\nthrough the crowd without being recognized. The king moved on,\nfollowed by the queen, Madam Elizabeth, and the children.  The crowd,\nclose and menacing, lined the passage, and the little procession\nmade their way with difficulty to the Assembly.\n\n\"We remained in the palace, and every moment the throng around\nbecame more and more numerous. The cannon they brought were turned\nagainst us. The first door was burst open, the Swiss did not fire,\nthe populace poured in and mixed with us and the soldiers.  Some\none fired a gun. Whether it was one of the Swiss or one of the mob\nI know not, but the fight began. The Swiss in good order marched\ndown the staircase, drove out the mob, seized the cannon the\nMarseillais had brought, and turning them upon their assailants\nopened fire. The mob fled in terror, and I believe that one battalion\nwould have conquered all the scum of Paris, had not the king, at\nthe sound of the first shot, sent word to the Swiss to cease firing.\nThey obeyed, and although the mob kept firing upon them from the\nwindows, the great part of them marched calm, and without returning\na shot, to the Assembly, where, at the order of the king, they laid\ndown their arms and were shut up in the church of the Feuillants.\n\n\"A portion of the Swiss had remained on guard in the Tuileries when\nthe main body marched away. The instant the palace was undefended\nthe mob burst in. Every Swiss was murdered, as well as many of\nthe servants of the queen. The mob sacked the palace and set it on\nfire. When the Swiss left we  had one by one made our way out by a\nback entrance, but most of us were recognized by the mob and were\nliterally cut to pieces. I rushed into a house when assaulted,\nand, slamming the door behind me, made my way out by the back and\nso escaped them, getting off with only these two wounds; then I\nhurried to a house of a friend, whom I had seen murdered before my\neyes, but his servants did not know of it, and they allowed me to\nremain there till dark, and you see here I am.\"\n\n\"But what has happened at the Assembly and where is the king?\" the\nmarquise asked, after the first exclamation of horror at the tale\nthey had heard.\n\n\"The king and his family are prisoners in the Temple,\" the marquis\nsaid. \"The Commune has triumphed over the Assembly and a National\nConvention is to be the supreme power. The king's functions are\nsuspended, but as he has not ruled for the last three years that\nwill make little difference.  A new ministry has been formed with\nDanton, Lebrun, and some of the Girondists. He and his family are\nhanded over to the care of the Commune, and their correspondence is\nto be intercepted. A revolutionary tribunal has been constituted,\nwhen, I suppose, the farce of trying men whose only crime is loyalty\nto the king is to be carried out.\n\n\"We must be prepared, my love, to face the worst. Escape is now\nimpossible, and, indeed, so long as the king and queen are alive I\nwould not quit Paris; but we must prepare for sending the children\naway if possible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Outburst\n\n\n\"Monsieur le Marquis,\" M. du Tillet exclaimed, hurrying into the\nsalon, in which the marquis with his family were sitting, on the\nevening of the 21st of August, \"I hear that it is rumoured in the\nstreet that all the members of noble families are to be arrested.\"\n\nThe room was lit up as if to receive company, but the crowd which\nhad thronged it a fortnight before were gone. The Girondists had\nfirst withdrawn, then the nobles had begun to fall off, for it had\nbecome dangerous for them to show themselves in the streets, where\nthey were liable to be insulted and attacked by the mob. Moreover,\nany meeting of known Royalists was regarded with suspicion by the\nauthorities, and so gradually the gatherings had become smaller\nand smaller.\n\nThe only constant visitor now was the Count de Gisons, but he\nto-night was absent. The news was not unexpected. The violence of\nthe extremists of the Mountain had been increasing daily. At the\nCordeliers and Jacobin Clubs, Danton, Robespierre, and Marat had\nthundered nightly their denunciations against the aristocrats, and\nit was certain that at any moment the order for their arrest might\nbe given. Such bad news had been received of the state of feeling\nin the provinces, that it was felt that it would be more dangerous\nto send the young ones away than to retain them in Paris, and the\nmarquise had been a prey to the liveliest anxiety respecting her\nchildren. It seemed impossible that there could be any animosity\nagainst them, but the blind rage of the mob had risen to such a\nheight that it was impossible to say what might happen. Now that\nshe heard the blow was about to fall she drew her younger girls\ninstinctively to her, as if to protect them, but no word passed\nher lips.\n\n\"It might still be possible to fly,\" M. du Tillet went on. \"We have\nall the disguises in readiness.\"\n\n\"A Marquis de St. Caux does not fly from the canaille of Paris,\"\nthe marquis said quietly. \"No, Du Tillet; the king and queen are\nin prison, and it is not for their friends to leave their post here\nin Paris because danger threatens them; come when they may, these\nwretches will find us here ready for them.\"\n\n\"But the children, Edouard!\" the marquise murmured.\n\n\"I shall stand by my father's side,\" Ernest said firmly.\n\n\"I do not doubt your courage, my son. I wish now that I had long\nago sent you all across the frontier; but who could have foreseen\nthat the people of France were about to become a horde of wild\nbeasts, animated by hate against all, old and young, in whose veins\nran noble blood. However, although it is the duty of your mother\nand I to stay at our posts, it is our duty also to try and save\nour house from destruction; therefore, Du Tillet, I commit my two\nsons to your charge. Save them if you can, disguise them as you will,\nand make for the frontier. Once there you know all the arrangements\nwe have already made.\"\n\n\"But, father,\" Ernest remonstrated.\n\n\"I can listen to no argument, Ernest,\" the marquis said firmly.\n\"In this respect my will is law. I know what your feelings are,\nbut you must set them aside, they must give way to the necessity\nof saving one of the oldest families of France from perishing.\"\n\n\"And the girls?\" the marquise asked, as Ernest bent his head in\nsign of obedience to his father's orders.\n\n\"I cannot think,\" the marquis said, \"that they will be included in\nthe order for our arrest. They must go, as arranged, in the morning\nto the house of our old servant and remain quietly there awaiting\nthe course of events. They will pass very well as three of her\nnieces who have arrived from the country. You had better send a\ntrusty servant to prepare her for their coming. You, Harry, will,\nof course, accompany my sons.\n\n\"Pardon, marquis,\" Harry said quietly, \"I am firmly resolved to\nstay in Paris. I may be of assistance to your daughters, and there\nwill be no danger to me in remaining, for I have no noble blood in\nmy veins. Besides, my travelling with M. du  Tillet would add to\nhis danger. He will have difficulty enough in traversing the country\nwith two boys; a third would add to that difficulty.\"\n\n\"I cannot help that,\" the marquis said. \"I ought long ago to have\nsent you home, and feel that I have acted wrongly in allowing you\nto remain so long. I must insist upon your accompanying my sons.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to disobey you, monsieur le marquis,\" Harry said quietly\nbut firmly; \"but from the moment of your arrest I shall be my own\nmaster and can dispose of my actions. I am deeply sensible of all\nyour goodness to me, but I cannot yield, for I feel that I may be\nof some slight use here. There are so many strangers in Paris that\nthere is little fear of my attracting any notice. A mouse may help\na lion, monsieur, and it may be that though but a boy I may be able\nto be of service to mesdemoiselles.\"\n\n\"Do not urge him further, Edouard,\" the marquise said, laying a\nhand on her husband's arm as he was again about to speak. \"Harry\nis brave and thoughtful beyond his years, and it will be somewhat\nof a comfort to me to think that there is some one watching over\nour girls. I thank you, Harry, for your offer, and feel sure that\nyou will do all that can possibly be done to protect my girls. You\nwill be freer to do so than any of our friends, for they are likely\nto become involved in our fate, whatever that may be. Marie, you\nwill view our English friend as joint guardian with yourself over\nyour sisters. Consult him should difficulty or danger arise as if\nhe were your brother, and be guided by his advice. And now, girls,\ncome with me to my room, I have much to say to you.\n\n\"I am glad my wife decided as she did, Harry,\" the marquis said,\nputting his hand on his shoulder when his wife and daughters left\nthe room, \"for I too shall feel comfort in knowing that you are\nwatching over the girls. Now leave us, for I have much to arrange\nwith Monsieur du Tillet.\"\n\nAfter a prolonged talk with M. du Tillet the marquis sent for\nErnest. As soon as he entered the lad said:\n\n\"Of course, sir, I shall obey your commands; but it seems to me an\nunworthy part for your son to play, to be flying the country and\nleaving a stranger here to look after your daughters.\"\n\n\n\"He is hardly a stranger, Ernest,\" the marquis replied. \"He has been\nwith us as one of the family for two years, and he risked his life\nfor your sisters. You could not stay here without extreme risk, for\nif your name is not already included in the warrant for arrest it\nspeedily will be so, and when they once taste blood these wolves\nwill hunt down every one of us. He, on the other hand, might proceed\nopenly through the streets without danger; nevertheless, I would\nnot have kept him if he would have gone; but I have no power\nof controlling him, and as he chooses to devote himself to us I\nthankfully accept his devotion.\n\n\"And now, my son, it may be that after our parting to-morrow we\nshall not meet again, for God alone knows what fate is in store for\nus. I have, therefore, some serious advice to give you. If anything\nhappens to me, you will, I know, never forget that you are the\nhead of the family, and that the honour of a great name is in your\nkeeping; but do not try to strive against the inevitable. Adapt\nyourself to the new circumstances under which you will be placed,\nand lay aside that pride which has had much to do with the misfortunes\nwhich are now befalling us.\n\n\"As to your sisters, Marie is already provided for, that is if\nDe Gisons is not included in the order for arrest. I have already\nsent off a message to him to warn him; and as it has already been\narranged between us that while his father will stay and face whatever\nwill come, it is his duty, like yours, to escape the danger which\nthreatens our class, I trust that he will at once endeavour to\nleave the country; but I imagine that he will stop in Paris until\nsome means are devised for getting your sisters away.\n\n\"As to the others, if you all reach England and settle down there\ndo not keep up the class distinctions which have prevailed here.\nMarry your sisters to men who will protect and make them happy.\nThat these must be gentlemen goes without saying; but that is\nsufficient.  For example, if in future time a gentleman of the rank\nof our English friend here, of whose character you can entirely\napprove, asks for the hand of either of your younger sisters, do\nnot refuse it. Remember that such a suit would have the cordial\napproval of your mother and myself.\"\n\nA look of great surprise passed over Ernest's face. It had seemed\nto him so much a matter of course that the ladies of his house should\nmarry into noble families that the idea of one of them being given\nto a gentleman belonging to the professional class was surprising\nindeed.\n\n\"Do you really mean, sir, that if my friend Harry were some day to\nask for Jeanne's hand you would approve of the match?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I do mean, Ernest. In the stormy times in\nwhich we are living I could wish no better protector for her. Were\nhe a Frenchman, in the same position of life, I own that I might\nview the matter in a different light; but, as I have said, in\nEngland the distinction of classes is much less marked than here;\nand, moreover, in England there is little fear of such an outbreak\nof democracy as that which is destroying France.\"\n\nA few minutes later Monsieur du Tillet entered with the clothes which\nhad been prepared for the boys. They were such as would be worn by\nthe sons of workmen; he himself was attired in a blue blouse and\ntrousers. Jules was aroused from the couch on which he had for the\nlast hour been asleep, and he and Ernest retired to dress themselves\nin their new costume, M. du Tillet accompanying them to assist in\ntheir toilet. Both boys had the greatest repugnance to the change,\nand objected still further when M. du Tillet insisted it was\nabsolutely necessary that they should cut their hair and smear\ntheir faces and hands with dirt.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Ernest,\" he said, \"it would be worse than useless\nfor you to assume that attire unless at the same time you assumed\nthe bearing and manners appropriate to it. In your own dress we\nmight for a short time walk the street without observation; but if\nyou sallied out in that blouse with your white hands and your head\nthrown back, and a look of disdain and disgust on your face, the\nfirst gamin who met you would cry out, 'There is an aristocrat in\ndisguise!'\n\n\"You must behave as if you were acting in a comedy. You are\nrepresenting a lad of the lower orders. You must try to imitate\nhis walk and manner. Shove your hands deep in your pockets, shuffle\nyour feet along carelessly; let your head roll about as if it were\nuneasy on your neck, round your shoulders, and slouch your head\nforward.  As to you Jules, your role should be impertinence. Put\nyour cap on the wrong way; hold your nose in the air; pull your\nshort hair down over your forehead, and let some of it  spurt\nout through that hole in your cap. To be quite correct, you ought\nto address jeering remarks to every respectable man and woman you\nmeet in the streets; but as you know nothing of Parisian slang,\nyou must hold your tongue. See how thoroughly I have got myself\nup. You would take me for an idle out-of-elbows workman wherever\nyou met me. I do not like it; but, as I have to disguise myself,\nI try to do it thoroughly.\"\n\nIt was, however, with a feeling of humiliation that the boys presented\nthemselves before the marquis. He looked at them scrutinizingly.\n\n\"You will do, my boys,\" he said gravely. \"I should have passed\nyou in the street without knowing you. Now come in with me and say\ngood-bye to your mother and sisters. The sooner you are out of this\nhouse the better, for there is no saying at what hour the agents\nof the canaille may present themselves.\"\n\nThe parting was a sad one indeed, but it was over at last, and\nMonsieur du Tillet hurried the two boys away as soon as their father\nreturned with them.\n\n\"God bless you, du Tillet!\" the marquis said as he embraced his\nfriend. \"Should aught happen to us, you will, I know, be a father\nto them.\"\n\n\"Now, Harry,\" the marquis said when he had mastered the emotion\ncaused by the parting, which he felt might be a final one, \"since\nyou have chosen to throw in your lot with ours, I will give you a\nfew instructions. In the first place, I have hidden under a plank\nbeneath my bed a bag containing a thousand crowns. It is the middle\nplank. Count an even number from each leg and the centre one covers\nthe bag.\n\n\"You will find the plank is loose and that you can raise it easily\nwith a knife; but wax has been run in, and dust swept over it, so\nthat there is no fear of its being noticed by any who may pillage\nthe house, which they will doubtless do after we are arrested. I\nhave already sent an equal sum to Louise Moulin. Here is her address;\nbut it is possible that you may need money, and may be unable to\ncommunicate with my daughters at her house; at any rate do you keep\nthe bag of money in your charge.\n\n\"You had best attire yourself at once in the oldest suit of clothes\nyou have got. My daughters will be ready in a few minutes. They are\nalready dressed, so that they can slip out at the back entrance.\nShould we be disturbed before morning I shall place them under your\nescort; for although I hope that all the servants are faithful, one\ncan answer for no one in these times. I would send them off now,\nbut that the sight of females moving through the streets at this\ntime of night would be likely to attract attention on the part of\ndrunken men, or of fellows returning from these rascally clubs,\nwhich are the centre and focus of all the mischief that is going\non.\n\n\"I can give you no further advice. You must be guided by\ncircumstances. If, as I trust, the girls can live undisturbed and\nunsuspected with their mother's old nurse, it were best that they\nshould remain there until the troubles are finally over, and France\ncomes to her senses again. If not, I must leave it to you to act for\nthe best. It is a great trust to place in the hands of a youth of\nyour age; but it is your own choosing, and we have every confidence\nin you.\n\n\"I will do my best to deserve it, sir,\" Harry said quietly; \"but I\ntrust that you and madame la marquise will soon be able to resume\nyour guardianship. I cannot believe that although just at present\nthe populace are excited to fury by agitators, they can in cold\nblood intend to wreak their vengeance upon all the classes above\nthem.\"\n\n\"I hope you may be right,\" the marquis said; \"but I fear that it\nis not so. The people are mad so far. All that has been done has\nin no way mitigated their sufferings, and they gladly follow the\npreachings of the arch scoundrels of the Jacobin Club. I fear that\nbefore all this is over France will be deluged with blood. And\nnow, when you have changed your clothes, lie down, ready to rise\nat a moment's notice.  Should you hear a tumult, run at once to\nthe long gallery. There my daughters will join you prepared for\nflight. Lead them instantly to the back entrance, avoiding, if\npossible, any observation from the domestics. As these sleep on\nthe floor above, and know nothing of the dangers which threaten us,\nthey will not awake so quickly, and I trust that you will be able\nto get out without being seen by any of them. In that case, however\nclosely questioned no one will be able to afford a clue by which\nyou can be traced.\"\n\nWhen he had changed his clothes Harry extinguished all the lights in\nthe salon, for the marquis had long before ordered all the servants\nto retire to rest. Then he opened the window looking into the street\nand took his place close to it. Sleep under the circumstances was\nimpossible.\n\nAs the hours passed he thought over the events of the last few\ndays. He was fully aware that the task he had undertaken might be\nfull of danger; but to a healthy and active English lad a spice of\ndanger is by no means a deterrent. He could, of course, have left\nhis employment before the family left their chateau; but after\nhis arrival in Paris it would have been difficult for him to have\ntraversed the country and crossed the frontier, and he thought that\nthe danger which he now ran was not much greater than would have\nbeen entailed by such a step.\n\nIn the next place he was greatly attached to the family of the\nmarquis; and the orgies of the mob had filled him with such horror\nand disgust that he would have risked much to save any unfortunate, even\na stranger, from their hands; and lastly, he felt the fascination\nof the wild excitement of the times, and congratulated himself\nthat he should see and perhaps be an actor in the astonishing drama\nwhich was occupying the attention of the whole civilized world.\n\nAs he sat there he arranged his own plans. After seeing his charge\nin safety he would take a room in some quiet locality, alleging\nthat he was the clerk of a notary, and would, in the dress of one\nof that class, or the attire of one of the lower orders, pass his\ndays in the streets, gathering every rumour and watching the course\nof events.\n\nMorning was just breaking when he heard the sound of many feet\ncoming along the street, and looking out saw a crowd of men with\ntorches, headed by two whose red scarfs showed them to be officials.\nAs they reached the entrance gate the men at the head of the\nprocession stopped. Harry at once darted away to the long gallery,\nand as he did so, heard a loud knocking at the door.\n\nScarcely had he reached the gallery when a door at the further end\nopened, and three figures, the tallest carrying a lamp, appeared.\nThe girls, too, had been keeping watch with their father and\nmother.  They were dressed in the attire of respectable peasant\ngirls. Virginie was weeping loudly, but the elder girls, although\ntheir cheeks bore traces of many tears they had shed during the\nnight, restrained them now. When they reached Harry, the  lad,\nwithout a word, took the lamp from Marie's hand, and led the way\nalong the corridor and down the stairs towards the back of the\nhouse.\n\nEverything was quiet. The knocking, loud as it was, had not yet\naroused the servants, and, drawing the bolt quietly, and blowing\nout the lamp, Harry led the way into the garden behind the house.\nThen for a moment he paused. There was a sound of axes hewing down\nthe gate which led from the garden into the street behind.\n\n\"Quick, mesdemoiselles!\" he said. \"There is no time to lose.\"\n\nHe took they key out of the door, and closed and locked it after\nhim. Then throwing the key among the shrubs he took Virginie's hand,\nand led the way rapidly towards the gate, which was fortunately a\nstrong one.\n\n\"In here, mesdemoiselles,\" he said to Marie, pointing to some shrubs\nclose to the gate. \"They will rush straight to the house when the\ngate gives way, and we will slip out quietly.\"\n\nFor nearly five minutes the gate, which was strongly bound with iron,\nresisted the attack upon it. Then there was a crash, and a number\nof men with torches, and armed with muskets and pikes, poured in.\nVirginie was clinging to Marie, who, whispering to her to be calm\nand brave, pressed the child closely to her, while Jeanne stood\nquiet and still by the side of Harry, looking through the bushes.\n\nSome twenty men entered, and a minute later there was the sound of\nbattering at the door through which the fugitives had sallied out.\n\n\"Now,\" Harry said, \"let us be going.\" Emerging from the shelter, a\nfew steps took them to the gate, and stepping over the door, which\nlay prostrate on the ground, they turned into the lane.\n\n\"Let us run,\" Harry said; \"we must get out of this lane as soon as\npossible. We are sure to have the mob here before long, and should\ncertainly be questioned.\"\n\nThey hurried down the lane, took the first turning away from the\nhouse, and then slackened their pace. Presently they heard a number\nof footsteps clattering on the pavement; but fortunately they\nreached another turning before the party came up. They turned down\nand stood up in a doorway till the footsteps had passed, and then\nresumed their way.\n\n\"It is still too early for us to walk through the streets without\nexciting attention,\" Harry said. \"We had better make down to the\nriver and wait there till the town is quite astir.\"\n\nIn ten minutes they reached the river, and Harry found a seat for\nthem at the foot of a pile of timber, where they were partially\nscreened from observation. Hitherto the girls had not spoken a\nword since they had issued from the house. Virginie was dazed and\nfrightened by the events of the night, and had hurried along almost\nmechanically holding Marie's hand. Marie's brain was too full to\ntalk; her thoughts were with her father and mother and with her\nabsent lover. She wondered that he had not come to her in spite of\neverything. Perhaps he was already a captive; perhaps, in obedience\nto his father's orders, he was in hiding, waiting events. That\nhe could, even had his father commanded him, have left Paris as a\nfugitive without coming to see her, did not even occur to her as\npossible.\n\nWith these thoughts there was mingled a vague wonder at her own\nposition. A few weeks since petted and cared for as the eldest\ndaughter of one of the noblest families of France, now a fugitive\nin the streets under the sole care of this English boy. She had,\nthe evening before, silently sided with Ernest. It had seemed to\nher wrong that he should be sent away, and the assertion of Harry\nthat he intended to stay and watch over her and her sisters seemed\nat once absurd and presumptuous; but she already felt that she had\nbeen wrong in that opinion.\n\nThe decision and coolness with which he had at once taken the\ncommand from the moment he met them in the gallery, and the quickness\nwith which he had seized the only mode of escape, had surprised\nand dominated her. Her own impulse, when on opening the door she\nheard the attack that was being made on the gate, was to draw back\ninstantly and return to the side of her parents, and it was due to\nHarry only that she and her sisters had got safely away.\n\nHitherto, although after the incident of the mad dog she had exchanged\nher former attitude of absolute indifference to one of cordiality\nand friendliness, she had regarded him as a boy. Indeed she had\ntreated and considered him as being very much younger than Ernest,\nand in some respects she had been justified in doing so, for in\nhis light-hearted fun, his love of active exercise, and his entire\nabsence of any assumption of age, he was far more boyish than\nErnest. But although her thoughts were too busy  now to permit her\nto analyse her feelings, she knew that she had been mistaken, and\nfelt a strange confidence in this lad who had so promptly and coolly\nassumed the entire command of the party, and had piloted them with\nsuch steady nerve through the danger.\n\nAs for Jeanne, she felt no surprise and but little alarm. Her\nconfidence in her protector was unbounded. Prompt and cool as he\nwas himself, she was ready on the instant to obey his orders, and\nfelt a certain sensation of pride at the manner in which her previous\nconfidence in him was being justified.\n\nAfter placing the girls in their shelter Harry had left them and\nstood leaning against the parapet of the quay as if carelessly\nwatching the water, but maintaining a vigilant look-out against\nthe approach of danger. The number of passers-by increased rapidly.\nThe washerwomen came down to the boats moored in the stream and\nbegan their operation of banging the linen with wooden beaters.\nMarket-women came along with baskets, the hum and stir of life\neverywhere commenced, and Paris was fairly awake.\n\nSeeing that it was safe now to proceed, Harry returned to his\ncompanions. He had scarcely glanced at them before, and now looked\napprovingly at their disguises, to which the marquise had, during\nthe long hours of the night, devoted the most zealous attention.\nMarie had been made to look much older than she was. A few dark\nlines carefully traced on her forehead, at the corners of her eyes\nand mouth, had added many years to her appearance, and she could\nhave passed, except to the closest observer, as the mother of\nVirginie, whose dress was calculated to make her look even younger\nthan she was. The hands and faces of all three had been slightly\ntinged with brown to give them a sun-burnt aspect in accordance\nwith their peasant dresses, and so complete was the transformation\nthat Harry could scarcely suppress a start of surprise as he looked\nat the group.\n\n\"It would be safe now, mademoiselle,\" he said to Marie, \"for us to\nproceed. There are plenty of people about in the streets; but as\nthe news has, no doubt, already been spread that the daughters of\nthe Marquis de St. Caux had left the house before those charged\nwith their father's arrest arrived, it will be better for you not\nto keep together. I would suggest that you should walk on with\nVirginie.  I will follow with Jeanne a hundred yards behind, so\nthat I can keep you in sight, and will come up if anyone should\naccost you.\"\n\nMarie at once rose, and taking the child's hand set out. They had\nto traverse the greater part of Paris to reach their destination.\nIt was a trial for Marie, who had never before been in the streets\nof Paris except with her mother and closely followed by two domestics,\nand even then only through the quiet streets of a fashionable\nquarter.  However, she went steadily forward, tightly holding\nVirginie's hand and trying to walk as if accustomed to them in the\nthick heavy shoes which felt so strangely different to those which\nshe was in the habit of wearing.\n\nFrom time to time she addressed an encouraging word to Virginie\nas she felt her shrink as they approached groups of men lounging\noutside the wine-shops, for there was but little work done in Paris,\nand the men of the lower class spent their time in idleness, in\ndiscussions of the events of the day, or in joining the mobs which,\nunder one pretext or another, kept the streets in an uproar.\n\nFortunately Marie knew the way perfectly and there was no occasion\nfor her to ask for directions, for she had frequently driven with\nher mother to visit Louise Moulin. The latter occupied the upper\nfloor of a house in a quiet quarter near the fortifications in the\nnorth-western part of the town. A message had been sent to her the\nnight before, and she was on the look-out for her visitors, but\nshe did not recognize them, and she uttered a cry of surprise as\nMarie and Virginie entered the room.\n\n\"Is it you, mademoiselle?\" she exclaimed in great surprise. \"And\nyou, my little angel? My eyes must be getting old, indeed, that I\ndid not recognize you; but you are finely disguised. But where is\nMademoiselle Jeanne?\"\n\n\"She will be here in a moment, Louise; she is just behind. But you\nmust not call me mademoiselle; you must remember that we are your\nnieces Marie and Jeanne, and that you are our aunt Louise Moulin,\nwhom we have come to stay with.\"\n\n\"I shall remember in time,\" the old woman said. \"I have been\ntalking about you to my neighbours for the last week, of how your\ngood father and mother have died, and how you were going to journey\nto Paris under the charge of a neighbour, who was bringing a waggon\nload of wine from Burgundy, and  how you were going to look after\nme and help me in the house since I am getting old and infirm, and\nthe young ones were to stop with me till they were old enough to\ngo out to service. Ah, here is Mademoiselle Jeanne!\"\n\n\"Here is Jeanne,\" Marie corrected; \"thank God we have all got here\nsafely. This, Louise, is a young English gentleman who is going to\nremain in Paris at present, and to whom we are indebted for having\ngot us safely here.\"\n\n\"And your mother,\" Louise Moulin exclaimed, \"the darling lamb\nI nursed, what of her and your father? I fear, from the message I\ngot last night, that some danger threatens them.\"\n\n\"They have, I fear, been arrested by the sans culottes,\" Marie said\nmournfully as she burst into tears, feeling, now that the strain\nwas over, the natural reaction after her efforts to be calm. For\nher mother's sake she had held up to the last, and had tried to\nmake the parting as easy as possible.\n\n\"The wretches!\" the old woman said, stamping her foot. \"Old as I am\nI feel that I could tear them to pieces. But there I am chattering\naway, and you must be faint with hunger. I have a nice soup ready\non the fire, a plate of that will do good to you all. And you too,\nmonsieur, you will join us, I hope?\"\n\nHarry was nothing loth, for his appetite was always a healthy one.\nWhen he had finished he said:\n\n\"Madame Moulin, I have been thinking that it would be an advantage\nif you would take a lodging for me. If you would say that a youth\nwhose friends are known to you has arrived from Dijon, to make his\nway in Paris, and they have asked you to seek a lodging for him;\nit will seem less strange than if I went by myself. I should like\nit to be near, so that you can come to me quickly should anything\nout of the way occur. I should like to look in sometimes to see that\nall is well. You could mention to your neighbours that I travelled\nup with the same waggon with your nieces.\n\n\"I will do that willingly,\" the old woman said; \"but first, my dears,\nyou must have some rest; come in here.\" And she led the way to the\nnext room. \"There is a bed for you, Mademoiselle Marie, and one for\nthe two young ones. The room is not like what you are accustomed\nto, but I dared not buy finer things, though I had plenty of money\nfrom your mother to have  furnished the rooms like a palace; but you\nsee it would have seemed strange to my neighbours; but, at least,\neverything is clean and sweet.\"\n\nLeaving the girls, who were worn out with weariness and anxiety,\nto sleep, she rejoined Harry.\n\n\"Now, monsieur, I will do your business. It is a comfort to me to\nfeel that some one will be near of whom I can ask advice, for it is\na terrible responsibility for an old woman in such dreadful times\nas these, when it seems to me that everyone has gone mad at once.\nWhat sort of a chamber do you want?\"\n\n\"Quite a small one,\" Harry answered, \"just such a chamber as a\nyoung clerk on the look-out for employment and with his pocket very\nslenderly lined, would desire.\"\n\n\"I know just such a one,\" the old woman said. \"It is a house a\nfew doors away and has been tenanted by a friend of mine, a young\nworkwoman, who was married four days ago--it is a quiet place,\nand the people keep to themselves, and do not trouble about their\nneighbours' affairs.\"\n\n\"That will just suit me,\" Harry said. \"I suppose there is no porter\nbelow, so that I can go in or out without being noticed.\"\n\n\"Oh, we have no porters in this quarter, and you can go in and out\nas you like.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the matter was settled, and Harry was installed\nin his apartment, which was a little room scantily furnished, at\nthe top of the house, the window looking into the street in front.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAn Anxious Time\n\n\nHarry and the girls had brought bundles of clothes with them\nin their flight, as it would have looked strange had they arrived\nwithout any clothes save those they wore. Harry had brought with him\nonly underlinen, as he had nothing else which would be of service\nto him now.  No sooner had Louise Moulin left him than he went out\nand purchased, at a second-hand shop, a workman's suit. This he\ncarried home, and dressing himself in it descended the stairs again\nand set out to retrace his steps across Paris.\n\nWhen he reached the mansion of the marquis he found a crowd of\npeople going in and out. Those leaving the house were laden with\narticles of furniture, clocks, pictures, bedding, and other things.\nA complete sack of the mansion was indeed taking place. The servants\nhad all fled after the arrest of the marquis and his wife, and\nthe mob had taken possession of the house. The lofty mirrors were\nsmashed into fragments, the costly hangings torn down, and after\nthey had destroyed much of the elaborate furniture, every man and\nwoman began to lay hands upon whatever they fancied and the mansion\nwas already stripped of the greater part of its belongings.\n\nWith his hands in his pockets, whistling carelessly, Harry wandered\nfrom room to room watching the proceedings. Several barrels of wine\nhad been brought up into the salon, and round these were gathered\na number of already drunken men, singing, shouting, and dancing.\n\n\"Drink, drink, my garcon,\" a woman said, holding a silver goblet\nfull of wine towards him, \"drink confusion to the tyrants and\nliberty and freedom to the people.\"\n\nHarry drank the toast without hesitation, and then, heartsick\nat the destruction and ruin, wandered out again into the streets.\nKnowing the anxiety which Marie would be suffering as to the safety\nof her lover he next took his way to the mansion of the Duke de\nGisons. The house was shut up, but groups of men were standing in\nthe road opposite talking.\n\nSauntering along Harry stopped near enough to one of these to hear\nwhat they were saying. He learned that the duke had been arrested\nonly that morning. It had been effected quietly, the doors had\nagain been locked before those in the neighbourhood knew what was\ngoing on, and a guard had been left inside, partly, it was said, in\norder that the mansion might be preserved from pillage and be used\nfor public purposes, partly that the young count, who was absent,\nmight be arrested when he returned.\n\nAs Harry knew that the duke had estates in the neighbourhood of\nFontainebleau he thought it probable that Victor might have gone\nthither, and he at once proceeded towards the gate by which he would\nenter on his return thence. He sat down a short distance outside\nthe gate and watched patiently for some hours until he perceived a\nhorseman approaching at a gallop and at once recognized Victor de\nGisons. Harry went forward on to the road and held out his arms.\nThe young count, not recognizing him, did not check his horse and\nwould have ridden him down had he not jumped aside, at the same\ntime shouting to him by name to stop.\n\n\"What do you want, fellow?\" Victor exclaimed, reining in his horse.\n\n\"You do not recognize me!\" Harry said. \"I am Harry Sandwith, count,\nand I am here to warn you of the danger of proceeding.\"\n\n\"Why, what has happened?\" Victor exclaimed anxiously; \"and why are\nyou in disguise, Monsieur Sandwith?\"\n\n\"A great number of arrests have taken place in the night, among them\nthat of the Marquis de St. Caux and your father. Men are waiting\ninside your house to arrest you as you enter.\"\n\nVictor uttered an exclamation of anger.\n\n\"That is why I have been sent away,\" he said. \"My father had no\ndoubt received a warning of what was about to happen, and yesterday\nat noon he requested me to ride to his estate and have an interview\nwith the steward as to the rents. I wondered at his sending me\nso suddenly, and, feeling uneasy,  rode there post-haste, saw the\nsteward last night, and started again on a fresh horse this morning.\nThis accounts for it. He knew that if I were there nothing would\nhave induced me to separate myself from him, while by sending me\naway he left it to me to do as I thought fit afterwards, trusting\nthat when I found that he was already imprisoned I might follow the\ncounsel he had urged upon me, to make my escape from the country.\nAnd how about the ladies, how about Marie?\"\n\n\"The marquise was conveyed to prison with the marquis. The three\nyoung ladies are all safe with their mother's old servant, Louise\nMoulin; this is her address. They are in disguise as peasants, and\nno suspicion will, I hope, arise as to their real position. Not\nthat the marquis thought it probable they would be included in\nthe order of arrest, but he said there was no knowing now to what\nlengths the mob might go and he thought it better that they should\ndisappear altogether for the present. Ernest and Jules went away\nin disguise with Monsieur du Tillet. After seeing the young ladies\nin safety this morning I went down to see what had happened at your\nfather's mansion, in order to assuage Mademoiselle de St. Caux's\nanxiety respecting your safety, and found, as I expected, that\nthe duke had been arrested, and learned that a party were inside\nwaiting to arrest you on your return.\n\n\"I thank you indeed,\" Victor said, \"and most warmly. I do not\nknow what to do. My father is most anxious that I should cross the\nfrontier, but I cannot go so long as he and Marie are in danger.\"\n\n\"If you enter Paris as you are,\" Harry said, \"you are certain to\nbe arrested. Your only chance would be to do as I have done, namely\nto disguise yourself and take a small lodging, where you might live\nunsuspected.\"\n\n\"And in that way I can see Marie sometimes,\" Victor said.\n\n\"You could do so,\" Harry agreed, in a somewhat hesitating way, \"but\nit would greatly add to her danger, and, were you detected, might\nlead to the discovery of her disguise. Besides, the thought that\nyou were liable to arrest at any time would naturally heighten the\nanxiety from which she is suffering as to the fate of her father\nand mother.\"\n\n\"But I cannot and will not run away and leave them all here in\ndanger,\" Victor said passionately.\n\n\"I would not advise you to do so,\" Harry replied. \"I would only\nsuggest, that after seeing Mademoiselle de St. Caux once, you\nshould lead her to believe that you have decided upon making for\nthe frontier, and she will therefore have the happiness of believing\nthat you are safe, while you are still near and watching over her.\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" Victor said; \"but what opinion would she\nhave of me if she thought me capable of deserting her in that way?\"\n\n\"You would represent that you were obeying the duke's orders; and\nbesides, if you did suffer in her opinion it would be but temporarily,\nfor when she learned the truth, that you had only pretended to\nleave in order that her position might be the safer and that her\nmind might be relieved, she could only think more highly of you.\nBesides, if necessary, you could at any time again present yourself\nbefore her.\"\n\n\"Your counsel is good, Monsieur Sandwith, and I will, at anyrate\nfor a time, follow it. As you say, I can at anytime reappear.\nWhere are you lodging? I will take a room near, and we can meet\nand compare notes and act together.\"\n\nHarry gave him his address.\n\n\"You have only to walk upstairs to the top story. My room is the\none directly opposite the top of the stairs.\"\n\n\"I will call on you to-morrow morning,\" Victor said. \"I will ride\nmy horse a few miles back and turn him loose in some quiet place,\nand buy at the first village a blouse and workman's pantaloons.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Harry said, \"that would be unwise, count; it would look\nstrange in the extreme for a gentleman dressed as you are to make\nsuch a purchase. You might be at once arrested, or a report of the\ncircumstance might be sent into Paris and lead to your discovery.\nIf you will wait here for half an hour I will go back and buy you\nthe things you want at the first shop I come to and bring them out\nto you. Then you can ride back and loose the horse as you propose;\nbut I should advise you to hide the saddle and bridle, as well as\nthe clothes you are now wearing, most carefully. Whoever finds your\nhorse will probably appropriate it and will say nothing about it,\nso that all clue to your movements will be lost, and it will be\nsupposed that you have ridden to the frontier.\"\n\n\"Peste, Monsieur Sandwith! You seem to have a head ready for all\nemergencies. I know what a high opinion the marquis had of you,\nand I perceive that it is fully justified, and consider myself as\nfortunate indeed in having you for a friend in such a time as the\npresent.\"\n\n\"We have need of all our wits,\" Harry said quietly. \"The marquis\nwas good enough to accept my offer to do all that I could to look\nafter the safety of mesdemoiselles, and if I fail in my trust it\nwill not, I hope, be from any lack of care or courage.\"\n\nThe meeting had taken place at a point where it could not be observed\nfrom the gate, and the count withdrew a few hundred yards farther\naway while Harry went back into Paris. The latter had no difficulty\nin purchasing the clothes required by the count and returned with\nthem in little over a quarter of an hour, and then, having seen\nDe Gisons ride off, he sauntered back into Paris and made his way\ntowards the heart of the city.\n\nCrossing the river he found a vast crowd gathered in front of the\nHotel de Ville. The news of the wholesale arrests which had been\nmade during the night had filled the populace with joy, and the air\nwas full of shouts of \"Down with the Aristocrats!\" \"Vive Danton!\nVive Marat! Vive Robespierre!\" Hawkers were selling, in the crowd,\nnewspapers and broadsheets filled with the foulest attacks, couched\nin the most horrible language, upon the king, the queen, and the\naristocracy.\n\nAt various points men, mounted upon steps or the pedestals of\nstatues, harangued the mob while from time to time the crowd opened\nand made way for members of the city council, who were cheered or\nhooted according to their supposed sentiments for or against the\ncause of the people. After remaining there for some time Harry\nmade his way to the entrance to the Assembly. A crowd was gathered\nhere, and a tremendous rush was made when the doors were opened.\nHarry managed to force his way in and sat for some hours listening to\nthe debate, which was constantly interrupted by the people in the\ngalleries, who applauded with frenzy the speeches of their favourite\norators, the deputies of the Mountain, as the bank of seats occupied\nby the Jacobin members was named, and howled and yelled when the\nGirondists ventured to advocate moderation or conciliation.\n\nIt was late in the evening before the sitting was over, and Harry\nwas unable to leave his place earlier. Then he went and had supper\nat a wineshop, and after sauntering on the Boulevards until the\nstreets began to be deserted he again crossed the river and made\nhis way to the mansion. Not a light was to be seen in the windows\nand all was still and quiet. The great door stood open. The work\nof destruction was complete; the house was stripped of everything\nthat could be carried away.\n\nHarry made his way up to the bedroom of the marquis. The massive\nbedstead still stood in its place, having defied the efforts\nof destruction which had proved successful with the cabinets and\nother furniture. Sitting down on the floor Harry counted the boards\nbeneath the bed, and then taking out a strong knife which he had\npurchased during the day he inserted it by the side of the middle\nboard and tried to raise it. It yielded without difficulty to his\neffort.\n\nAs soon as it was lifted he groped in the cavity below it, and his\nhand soon came in contact with the heavy bag. Taking this out and\nputting it beneath his blouse he replaced the board and made his\nway downstairs. He felt too fatigued to walk across Paris again,\nand therefore made his way down to the river and curled himself\nup for the night at the foot of the wood pile where the girls had\nfound shelter in the morning, and, in spite of the novelty of his\nsituation, fell instantly asleep.\n\nIt was broad daylight when he woke, and an hour later he regained\nhis lodgings, stopping by the way to breakfast at a quiet estaminet\nfrequented by the better class of workmen. As when he had sallied\nout the day before, he was fortunate in meeting no one as he made\nhis way up the stairs to his room. His first step was to get up\na board and to deposit beneath it the bag of money. Then, having\nchanged his clothes, he went out and made a variety of purchases\nfor housekeeping, as he did not wish to be obliged to take his\nmeals at places where anyone sitting at the table with him might\nenter into conversation.\n\nHis French was quite good enough to pass in the salon of the\nmarquis, but his ignorance of the Parisian slang spoken among the\nworking-classes would have rendered it difficult for him to keep\nup his assumed character among them, and would have needed the\nfabrication of all sorts of stories as to his birthplace and past\nhistory.\n\nAlthough in the position in which he was placed Harry felt that it\nwould be impossible always to adhere to the truth, he shrank from\nany falsehoods that could possibly be avoided.\n\nHis first duty in order to carry out the task he had undertaken was\nto keep up his disguise, and this must be done even at the cost of\ntelling lies as to his antecedents; but he was determined that he\nwould avoid this unpleasant necessity as far as lay in his power.\n\nAt nine o'clock he made his way to the apartments of Louise Moulin.\nHis entry was received with a cry of satisfaction from the girls.\n\n\"What is the news, Harry?\" Jeanne exclaimed. \"We expected you here\nyesterday evening, and sat up till ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"I was over the other side of the river discharging a mission your\nfather had confided to me, and did not get back till this morning.\"\n\n\"I knew he was prevented by something,\" Jeanne said triumphantly.\n\"I told you so, Marie--didn't I?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, I was wrong to be impatient; but you will forgive me,\nHarry? You can guess how I suffered yesterday.\"\n\n\"It was natural you should expect me, mademoiselle. I was sorry\nafterwards that I did not tell you when I left you that I should\nnot be able to come in the evening, but indeed I did not think of\nit at the time.\"\n\n\"And now for your news, Harry,\" Jeanne asked impatiently; \"have\nyou learned anything about our father and mother?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I have not, except that they, with many others,\nwere taken to the prison of Bicetre. But I have good news for you,\nMademoiselle Marie. After going first to the house and finding it in\nthe possession of a hideous mob, who were plundering and drinking,\nI went to see what had taken place at the hotel of the Duc de\nGisons.  I found that he had, like your father, been arrested in\nthe night. I learned that the count was absent, and that a party\nwere inside in readiness to arrest him on his return. Thinking\nit probable that he might have gone down to their estate near\nFontainebleau, I went out beyond the gate on that road and waited\nfor him. I had the good fortune to meet him, to warn him of his\ndanger, and to prevent his returning to town. He rode away with a\nsuit of workman's clothes I had procured for him, and was to enter\nParis in that disguise in the evening. He is to call on me at ten\no'clock, and I will then conduct him hither. I thought it best to\ncome in before to let you know that he was coming.\"\n\nMarie burst into tears of happiness at hearing that her lover had\nescaped from the danger which threatened. Worn out by the fatigue\nand anxiety of the previous night, she had slept for some hours\nafter reaching the shelter of the old nurse's roof, but she had\nlain awake all night thinking over the danger of all those dear to\nher.  She was now completely overcome with the revulsion of feeling.\n\n\"You are a dear boy, Harry!\" Jeanne said with frank admiration,\nwhile Marie sobbed out exclamations of gratitude. \"You do seem to\nthink about everything; and now Marie knows that Victor is safe, I\ndo hope she is going to be more like herself. As I tell her, they\ncannot hurt father or mother. They have done no wrong, and they\nmust let them out of prison after a time. Mamma said we were to\nbe brave; and at anyrate I try to be, and so does Virginie, though\nshe does cry sometimes. And now I hope Marie will be cheerful too,\nand not go about the rooms looking so downcast and wretched. It\nseems to me a miserable thing being in love. I should have thought\nMarie would have been the last person to be downcast, for no one\nis prouder of being a St. Caux than she is.\"\n\n\"I shall be better now, Jeanne,\" Marie said smiling, as she wiped\naway her tears. \"You shall not have any reason to complain of me\nin future.\n\n\"But do you not think, Harry,\" she went on with a return of her\nanxiety, \"that it is very dangerous for Victor to come back into\nParis? I know that his father has long been praying him to make\nfor the frontier.\"\n\n\"I do not think it is very dangerous at present, mademoiselle,\nalthough it may be later, if this rage against the aristocrats\nincreases; but I hope that when he has once seen you, which is\nhis principal object in returning to Paris, he will carry our his\nfather's wishes and make for the frontier, for his presence here\ncan be of no possible utility.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope so,\" Marie said, \"for I am sure Victor would soon\nbe found out, he could never make himself look like one of these\ncanaille.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he?\" Jeanne said indignantly. \"Harry does, and he\nis just as good-looking as Victor.\"\n\nMarie burst into a fit of laughter.\n\n\"What a champion you are, child, to be sure! But you are quite\nright. Clothes, after all, do go a long way towards making a man.\nStill, although I think that it is dangerous for Harry, I think it\nwill be more dangerous for Victor; because, you see, he is a man\nand he has the manner of his race, and would find it more difficult\nto pass himself off as a workman than Harry, who has got something\nof English\"--and she hesitated.\n\n\"Roughness,\" Harry put in laughing. \"You are quite right, mademoiselle.\nI can assure you that with these thick shoes on I find it quite\nnatural for me to slouch along as the workmen do; and it will be\nmuch more difficult for the count, who always walks with his head\nthrown back, and a sort of air of looking down upon mankind in\ngeneral.\"\n\nMarie laughed this time.\n\n\"That is a fair retort. Victor certainly has the grand manner.\nHowever, I shall order him to go; and if he won't obey his father's\nwishes, he will have to give way to mine.\"\n\n\"I think, mademoiselle, that it would be wiser for Monsieur de Gisons\nto meet you elsewhere than here. The arrival of three relations to\nstop with Madame Moulin is sure to attract some little attention\namong her neighbours just at first. You will be the subject of talk\nand gossip. My visit will no doubt be noticed, and it will be as\nwell that there should not be more material for talk. The less we\nattract attention the better. No doubt many have escaped arrest,\nand there will be a sharp look-out, for, as they will call us,\nsuspicious persons. I should propose, if you have no objection to\nsuch a course, that you should stroll out with your sisters and\nLouise through the fields to St.  Denis. The count will be in my\nroom in a few minutes. We can keep a look-out from my window and\nfollow you at a distance until we get clear from observation beyond\nthe gates.\"\n\nMarie looked at Madame Moulin, who nodded.\n\n\"That would be the best plan, my dear.  What Monsieur Sandwith\nsays is very true. The less we give the neighbours to gossip about\nthe better; for though your disguises are good, if sharp eyes are\nwatching you they may note something in your walk or air that may\nexcite suspicion.\"\n\n\"That being arranged then you must excuse me, for it is just the\ntime when the count was to arrive, and I fancy that he will be\nbefore rather than behind time.\"\n\nIndeed, upon reaching the door of his room Harry found the young\ncount standing there.\n\n\"Oh, it is you, friend Harry! I have been here ten minutes, and I\nbegan to be afraid that something might have happened to you and\nto imagine all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"It is still three or four minutes before the time we agreed upon,\nVictor,\" Harry said in a loud voice, for at this moment one of the\nother doors opened, and a woman came out with a basket in her arms.\n\n\"I have been looking about as usual, but without luck so far. I\nsuppose you have had no better fortune in your search for work?\"\nHe had by this time unlocked his door, and the two entered together.\n\n\"I must call you by your Christian name, count, and will do so, if\nyou don't mind, when alone as at other times, otherwise the title\nmight slip out accidentally. Will you, on your part, call me Henri?\nAs you know the marquis and his family called me Harry, which is\nthe ordinary way in England of calling anyone whose name is Henry,\nthat is unless he is a soft sort of fellow; but I must ask them to\ncall me Henri now, Harry would never do here.\"\n\n\"Have you seen them?\" was the count's first question.\n\n\"I have just left them, Victor, and if you look out from that window\ninto the street you will in a few minutes see them also; they are\njust going for a ramble towards St. Denis, and we will follow them.\nI thought it safer not to attract attention by going to the house,\nand I also thought that it would be more pleasant for you to talk\nto Mademoiselle de St. Caux out there in the fields, than in a\nlittle room with us present.\n\n\"Much more pleasant; indeed, I was wondering whether I should get\nan opportunity for a few minutes' talk alone with her.\"\n\nThey both took their places at the open window and leaned out\napparently chatting and carelessly watching what was passing in\nthe street.\n\nA quarter of an hour later they saw Louise Moulin and the girls\ncome out of their house.\n\n\"We had better come away from the window now,\" Harry said; \"Virginie\nmight look up and nod, we can't be too careful.\"\n\nThey waited three or four minutes to allow the others to get well\nahead and then started out after them; they walked fast until they\ncaught sight of the others, and then kept some distance behind\nuntil the party had left the town and were out among the fields\nwhich lay between Paris and St. Denis. They then quickened their\npace and were soon up with them.\n\nThe greeting between the lovers was a silent one, few words were\nspoken, but their faces expressed their joy at meeting again after\nthe perils through which they had passed; there was a little pause,\nand then Harry, as usual, took the lead.\n\n\"I will stroll on to St. Denis and back with Jeanne and Virginie;\nMadame Moulin can sit down on that log over there, and go on with\nher knitting; you, Victor, can ramble on with mademoiselle by that\npath through the field; we will agree to meet here again in an\nhour.\"\n\nThis arrangement was carried out; Jeanne and Virginie really enjoyed\ntheir walk; the latter thought their disguise was great fun, and,\nbeing naturally a little mimic, imitated so well the walk and\nmanner of the country children she had seen in her walks near the\nchateau that her sister and Harry were greatly amused.\n\n\"I like this too, Harry,\" Jeanne said. \"It would not be nice to be\na peasant girl for many things; but it must be joyful to be able\nto walk, and run, and do just as you please, without having a\ngouvernante always with you to say, Hold up your head, Mademoiselle\nJeanne; Do not swing your arms, Mademoiselle Jeanne; Please walk\nmore sedately, Mademoiselle Jeanne. Oh, it was hateful! Now we\nmight run, mightn't we, Harry?\"\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Jeanne, please call me Henri now; Harry is English,\nand people would notice directly if you happened to say it while\nanyone is near.\"\n\n\"I like Harry best,\" Jeanne said; \"but, of course, I should not\nsay it before the people; but may we run just for once?\"\n\n\"Certainly you may,\" Harry laughed; \"you and Virginie can have a\nrace to the corner of that wall.\"\n\n\"Come on, Virginie,\" Jeanne cried as she started, and the two\ngirls ran at full speed to the wall; Jeanne, however, completely\ndistancing her younger sister. They were both laughing when Harry\ncame up.\n\n\"That is the first time I have run a race,\" Jeanne said. \"I have\noften wanted to try how fast I could run, but I have never ventured\nto ask mademoiselle; she would have been horrified; but I don't\nknow how it is Virginie does not run faster.\"\n\n\"Virginie has more flesh,\" Harry said smiling. \"She carries weight,\nas we should say in England, while you have nothing to spare.\n\n\"And she is three years older,\" Virginie put in. \"Jeanne is just\nsixteen, and I am not thirteen yet; it makes a difference.\"\n\n\"A great deal of difference,\" Harry agreed; \"but I don't think you\nwill ever run as fast as she does. That will not matter, you know,\"\nhe went on, as Virginie looked a little disappointed, \"because it\nis not likely that you will ever race again; but Jeanne looks cut\nout for a runner--just the build, you see--tall, and slim, and\nactive.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Virginie agreed frankly, \"Jeanne has walked ever so far and\nnever gets tired, while I get dreadfully tired; mamma says sometimes\nI am quite a baby for my age.\"\n\n\"Here are some people coming,\" Harry said; \"as we pass them please\ntalk with a little patois. Your good French would be suspicious.\"\n\nAll the children of the marquis, from their visits among the peasants'\ncottages, had picked up a good deal of the Burgundian patois, and\nwhen talking among themselves often used the expressions current\namong the peasantry, and they now dropped into this talk, which\nHarry had also acquired, as they passed a group of people coming\nin from St. Denis.\n\nThey walked nearly as far as that town, and then turned and reached\nthe point where the party had separated, a few minutes before the\nexpiration of the appointed hour.\n\nThe two girls ran away to Louise Moulin, and chatted to her gaily,\nwhile Harry walked up and down until, a quarter of an hour later,\nthe count and Marie made their appearance. The party stood talking\ntogether for a few minutes; then adieus were said with a very pale\nface, but with firmness on  Marie's part, and then the girls, with\nLouise, turned their faces to Paris, while Harry and Victor remained\nbehind until they had got well on their way.\n\n\"It was hard to deceive her,\" Victor said; \"but you were right.\nShe insisted that I should go. I seemed to resist, and urged that\nit was cowardly for me to run away and to leave her here alone,\nbut she would not listen to it. She said it was a duty I owed to my\nfather and family to save myself, and that she should be wretched\nif she thought I was in Paris in constant danger of arrest. Finally,\nI had to give way to her, but it went against the grain, for even\nwhile she was urging me she must have felt in her heart it would be\ncowardly of me to go.  However, she will know some day that Victor\nde Gisons is no coward.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is better so,\" Harry said. \"She will have anxiety\nenough to bear as to her father and mother; it is well that her\nmind should be at ease concerning you.\"\n\n\"In reality,\" Victor said, \"I shall be safer here than I should be\njourneying towards the frontier. The papers this morning say that\nin consequence of the escape of suspected persons, and of the\nemigration of the nobles to join the enemies of France, orders\nhave been sent that the strictest scrutiny is to be exercised on\nthe roads leading to the frontier, over all strangers who may pass\nthrough. All who cannot give a perfectly satisfactory account of\nthemselves and produce their papers en regle, are to be arrested\nand sent to Paris. Therefore, my chance of getting through would be\nsmall indeed, whereas while remaining in Paris there can be little\nfear of detection.\"\n\n\"Not much risk, I hope,\" Harry agreed; \"but there is no saying what\nstringent steps they may take as time goes on.\"\n\nVictor had taken a lodging a few houses from that of Harry.  Every\nday the excitement in Paris increased, every day there were fresh\narrests until all the prisons became crowded to overflowing. It\nwas late in August; the Prussians were advancing and had laid siege\nto Verdun, and terror was added to the emotions which excited to\nmadness the population of Paris. Black flags were hung from the\nsteeples, and Danton and his allies skilfully used the fear inspired\nby the foreign enemy to add to the general hatred of the Royalists.\n\n\"We Republicans,\" he said in the rostrum of the Assembly, \"are\nexposed to two parties, that of the enemy without, that of the\nRoyalists within. There is a Royalist directory which sits secretly\nat Paris and corresponds with the Prussian army. To frustrate it\nwe must terrify the Royalists.\"\n\nThe Assembly decreed death against all who directly or indirectly\nrefused to execute or hindered the orders given by the executive\npower.  Rumours of conspiracy agitated Paris and struck alarm into\npeople's minds, while those who had friends within the prison walls\nbecame more and more alarmed for their safety.\n\nOn the 28th of August orders were issued that all the inhabitants\nof Paris were to stay in their houses in order that a visit might\nbe made by the delegates of the Commune to search for arms, of which\nDanton had declared there were eighty thousand hidden in Paris, and\nto search for suspected persons. As soon as the order was issued,\nHarry and Victor went to their lodgings, and telling their landlords\nthat they had obtained work at the other end of town, paid their\nrent and left the city, and for the next two days slept in the\nwoods.\n\nThey passed most of their time discussing projects for enabling\ntheir friends to escape, for from the stringency of the steps taken,\nand the violence of the Commune, they could no longer indulge in\nthe hopes that in a short time the prisoners against whom no serious\ncharge could be brought, would be released. At the same time they\ncould hardly persuade themselves that even such men as those who\nnow held the supreme power in their hands, could intend to take\nextreme measures against so vast a number of prisoners as were now\nin custody.\n\nVictor and Harry knew that their friends had at first been taken to\nthe prison of Bicetre, but whether they were still confined there\nthey were of course ignorant. Still there was no reason to suppose\nthat they had been transferred to any of the other jails.\n\nThe Bicetre was, they had discovered, so strongly guarded that\nneither force nor stratagem seemed available. The jailers were the\ncreatures of Danton and Robespierre, and any attempt to bribe them\nwould have been dangerous in the extreme. Victor proposed that,\nas he as well as Harry was well provided with funds, for he had\nbrought to Paris all the money which the steward of the estates\nhad collected, they should recruit a band among the ruffians of the\ncity, and make a sudden attack upon the prison. But  Harry pointed\nout that a numerous band would be required for such an enterprise,\nand that among so many men one would be sure to turn traitor before\nthe time came.\n\n\"I am ready to run all risks, Victor, but I see no chance of success\nin it. The very first man we spoke to might denounce us, and if\nwe were seized there would be no one to look after the safety of\nMademoiselle de St. Caux and her sisters. My first duty is towards\nthem. I gave my promise to their father, and although it is not\nprobable that I can be of any use to them, I will at any rate, if\npossible, be at hand should occasion arise.\"\n\nOn the evening of the 30th they returned to Paris, and took two\nfresh apartments at a distance from their former quarters.\n\nThey were greatly anxious as to the safety of the girls, and Harry\nat once hastened there, but found that all was well. The deputies,\nlearning from the landlord that only an old woman and her nieces\ninhabited the upper story, and having a heavy task before them,\nhad only paid a short visit to the room, and had left after asking\nLouise one or two questions.\n\nThe girls, however, were in a state of terrible anxiety as to\ntheir parents, although Louise had avoided repeating to them the\nsinister rumours which came to her ears when she was abroad doing\nher marketing, for she now went out alone, thinking it better that\nthe girls should appear as little as possible in the streets.\n\n\"It is terrible,\" Marie said. \"I think night and day of our father\nand mother. Can nothing be done? Surely we might devise some means\nfor their escape.\"\n\n\"I can think of nothing,\" Harry said. \"The prison is too strong to\nbe taken without a considerable force, and it would be impossible\nto get that together.\"\n\n\"Could we not bribe these wretches?\"\n\n\"I have thought over that too,\" Harry replied; \"but, you see, it\nwould be necessary to get several men to work together. One might,\nperhaps, bribe the man who has charge of the cell, but there would\nbe other warders, and the guard at the gate, and the latter are\nchanged every day. I do not see how that could possibly be done.\"\n\n\"Would it be any use, do you think, were I to go to Danton or\nRobespierre and plead with them for their lives? I would do that\nwillingly if you think there would be the slightest chance of\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"It would be like a lamb going to plead with a wolf. You would only\nattract attention to them.\"\n\n\"Could you not get hold of one of these wretches and force him to\nsign an order for their release?\" Jeanne suggested.\n\n\"Eh!\" Harry exclaimed in surprise. \"Jeanne, you have the best\nhead of us all. That idea never occurred to me. Yes, that might be\npossible. How stupid of me not to think of it!\"\n\n\"Do not run into any danger, Harry,\" Marie said earnestly.  \"Such\na scheme could hardly succeed.\"\n\n\"I don't know, mademoiselle. I think it might. I will think it over.\nOf course there are difficulties, but I do not see why it should\nnot succeed.\"\n\n\"Certainly it will succeed if Harry undertakes it,\" Jeanne said,\nwith implicit trust in his powers.\n\nHarry laughed, and even Marie, anxious as she was, could not help\nsmiling.\n\n\"I will try and deserve your confidence, Jeanne; but I am not a\nmagician. But I will talk it over with\"--and he hesitated--\"with\na young fellow who is, like myself, a Royalist, and in disguise.\nLuckily, we ran against each other the other day, and after a\nlittle conversation discovered each other. He, too, has relatives\nin prison, and will, I am sure, join me in any scheme I may undertake.\nTwo heads are better than one, and four are much better than two\nwhen it comes to acting.  And now I must say good-night. I hope\nwhen I see you again I shall be able to tell you that I have formed\nsome sort of plan for their release.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe 2d of September\n\n\nVictor de Gisons was, as usual, waiting near the door when Harry\nleft Louise Moulin's.\n\n\"What is the news, Henri? Nothing suspicious, I hope? You are out\nsooner than usual.\"\n\n\"Yes, for I have something to think of. Here have we been planning\nin vain for the last fortnight to hit upon some scheme for getting\nour friends out of prison, and Jeanne has pointed out a way which\nyou and I never thought of.\"\n\n\"What is that, Henri?\"\n\n\"The simplest thing in the world, namely, that we should seize one\nof the leaders of these villains and compel him to sign an order\nfor their release.\"\n\n\"That certainly seems possible,\" Victor said. \"I wonder it never\noccurred to either of us. But how is it to be done?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is for us to think out! Jeanne has given us the idea, and\nwe should be stupid if we cannot invent the details. In the first\nplace we have got to settle which of them it had better be, and\nin the next how it is to be managed. It must be some one whose\nsignature the people at the prison would be sure to obey.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Victor said, \"it must be either Danton or Robespierre.\"\n\n\"Or Marat,\" Harry added; \"I think he is as powerful as either of\nthe others.\"\n\n\"He is the worst of them, anyhow,\" Victor said. \"There is something\nstraightforward about Danton. No doubt he is ambitious, but I think\nhis hatred of us all is real. He is a terrible enemy, and will\ncertainly stick at nothing. He is ruthless and pitiless, but I do\nnot think he is double-faced. Robespierre is  ambitious too, but\nI think he is really acting according to his principles, such as\nthey are. He would be pitiless too, but he would murder on principle.\n\n\"He would sign unmoved the order for a hundred heads to fall if he\nthought their falling necessary or even useful for the course of\nthe Revolution, but I do not think he would shed a drop of blood\nto satisfy private enmity. They call him the 'incorruptible.' He is\nmore dangerous than Danton, for he has no vices. He lives simply,\nand they say is fond of birds and pets. I do not think we should\nmake much of either Danton or him, even if we got them in our power.\n\n\"Danton would be like a wild beast in a snare. He would rage with\nfury, but I do not think that he would be intimidated into signing\nwhat we require, not do I think would Robespierre. Marat is a\ndifferent creature altogether. He is simply venomous. He hates the\nworld, and would absolutely rejoice in slaughter. So loathsome is\nhe in appearance that even his colleagues shrink from him. He is a\nvenomous reptile whom it would be a pleasure to slay, as it would\nbe to put one's heel upon a rattlesnake. Whether he is a coward\nor not I do not know, but I should think so. Men of his type are\nseldom brave. I think if we had him in our hands we might frighten\nhim into doing what we want.\"\n\n\"Then Marat it shall be,\" Harry said; \"that much is settled. Tomorrow\nwe will find out something about his  habits. Till we know about\nthat we cannot form any plan whatever. Let us meet at dinner-time\nat our usual place. Then we will  go outside the Assembly and wait\ntill he comes out. Fortunately we both know him well by sight.  He\nwill be sure to go, surrounded, as usual, by a mob of his admirers,\nto the Jacobin Club. From there we can trace him to his home. No\ndoubt anyone could tell us where he lives, but it would be dangerous\nto ask. When we have found that out we can decide upon our next\nstep.\"\n\nThey were, however, saved the trouble they contemplated, for they\nlearned from the conversation of two men among the mob, who cheered\nMarat as he entered the Assembly, what they wanted to know.\n\n\"Marat is the man for me,\" one of them said. \"He hates the aristocracy;\nhe would bathe in their blood. I never miss reading his articles\nin the Friend of the People. His cry is always 'Blood! Blood!' He\ndoes not ape the manner of the bourgeois. He does not wash his face\nand put on clean linen. He is a  great man, but he is as dirty as\nthe best of us. He still lives in his old lodgings, though he could\nmove if he liked into any of the fine houses whose owners are in\nthe prisons. He wants no servants, but lives just as we do. Vive\nMarat!\"\n\n\"Where does the great citizen live?\" Victor asked the men in a\ntone of earnest entreaty. On learning the address they took their\nway to the dirty and disreputable street where Marat lodged.\n\n\"The citizen Marat lives in this street, does he not?\" Victor asked\na man lounging at the door of a cabaret.\n\n\"Yes, in that house opposite. Do you want him?\"\n\n\"No; only I was curious to see the house where the friend of the\npeople lives, and as I was passing the end of the street turned\ndown.  Will you drink a glass?\"\n\n\"I am always ready for that,\" the man said, \"but in these hard\ntimes one cannot do it as often as one would like.\"\n\n\"That is true enough,\" Victor said as they took their seats at\na table. \"And so Marat lives over there; it's not much of a place\nfor a great man.\"\n\n\"It is all he wants,\" the other said carelessly; \"and he is safer\nhere than he would be in the richer quarters. There would be a plot\nagainst him, and those cursed Royalists would kill him if they had\nthe chance; but he is always escorted home from the club by a band\nof patriots.\"\n\nIn the evening Harry and Victor returned to the street and watched\nuntil Marat returned from the Jacobin Club. His escort of men with\ntorches and bludgeons left him at the door, but two or three went\nupstairs with him, and until far in the night visitors came and\nwent. Then the light in the upper room was extinguished.\n\n\"It is not such an easy affair,\" Victor said as they moved away;\n\"and you see, as that man in the wine-shop told us, there is an\nold woman who cooks for him, and it is much more difficult to seize\ntwo people without an alarm being given than one.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" Harry agreed; \"but it must be done somehow.  Every\nday matters grow more threatening, and those bands of scoundrels\nfrom Marseilles have not been brought all this way for nothing.\nThe worst of it is, we have such a short time to act. Marat does\nnot seem to be ever alone from early morning until late at night.\nSupposing we did somehow get the order of release from him at night\nwe could not present it till the  morning, and before we could\npresent it some one might arrive and discover him fastened up, and\nmight take the news to the prison before we could get them out.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is very serious,\" Victor agreed. \"I begin to despair,\nHenri.\"\n\n\"We must not do that,\" Harry rejoined. \"You see we thought it\nimpossible before till Jeanne gave us the idea. There must be some\nway out of it if we could only hit upon it. Perhaps by to-morrow\nmorning an idea will occur to one of us. And there is another thing\nto be thought of; we must procure disguises for them. It would be\nof no use whatever getting them out unless we could conceal them\nafter they are freed. It would not do for them to go to Louise\nMoulin's.  She has three visitors already, and the arrival of more\nto stay with her would be sure to excite talk among the neighbours.\nThe last orders are so strict about the punishment of anyone giving\nshelter to enemies of the republic, that people who let rooms will\nall be suspicious. The only plan will be to get them out of the city\nat once. It will be difficult for them to make their way through\nFrance on foot, for in every town and village there is the strictest\nlook-out kept for suspected persons. Still, that must be risked;\nthere is no other way.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must see about that to-morrow, Henri; but I do not think\nthe marquise could support a journey, for they would have to sleep\nin the fields. Moreover, she will probably elect to stay near her\nchildren until all can go together. Therefore I think that it will\nbe best for her to come either to you or me. We can take an additional\nroom, saying that our mother is coming up from the country to keep\nhouse for us.\"\n\n\"Yes, that would be much the best plan, Victor. And now here we\nare close home. I hope by the time we meet in the morning one of\nus may have hit upon some plan or other for getting hold of this\nscoundrel.\"\n\n\"I have hit upon an idea, Victor,\" Harry said when they met the\nnext morning.\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, for though I have lain awake all night I\ncould think of nothing. Well, what is your idea?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Marat often goes out in the morning alone. He is\nso well known and he is so much regarded by the lower class that\nhe has no fear of any assault being made upon him during the day.\n\n\"My plan is that we should follow him till he gets into some street\nwith few people about. Then I would rush upon him, seize him, and\ndraw a knife to strike, shouting, 'Die, villain!' You should be\na few paces behind, and should run up and strike the knife out of\nmy hand, managing at the same moment to tumble over Marat and fall\nwith him to the ground. That would give me time to bolt. I would\nhave a beard on, and would have my other clothes under the blouse.\nI would rush into the first doorway and run up stairs, pull off\nmy beard, blouse, and blue pantaloons, and then walk quietly down.\nYou would, of course, rush up stairs and meet me on the way. I\nshould say I had just met a fellow running up stairs, and should\nslip quietly off.\"\n\n\"It would be a frightful risk, Henri, frightful!\"\n\n\"No, I think it could be managed easily enough. Then, of course,\nMarat would be very grateful to you, and you could either get him\nto visit your lodgings or could go up to his, and once you had\nbeen there you could manage to outsit his last visitor at night,\nand then we could do as we agreed.\"\n\n\"But, you know, we thought we should hardly have time in the morning,\nHenri!\"\n\n\"No, I have been thinking of that, and I have come to the conclusion\nthat our best plan would be to seize him and hold a dagger to his\nheart, and threaten to kill him instantly if he did not accompany\nus. Then we would go down with him into the street and walk arm in\narm with him to your lodging. We could thrust a ball of wood into\nhis mouth so that he could not call out even if he had the courage\nto do so, which I don't think he would have if he were assured that\nif he made the slightest sound we would kill him. Then we could\nmake him sign the order and leave him fastened up there. It would\nbe better to take him to your lodgings than mine, in case my visits\nto Louise Moulin should have been noticed, and when he is released\nthere will be a hue and cry after his captors.\"\n\n\"The best plan will be to put a knife into his heart at once the\nminute you have got the order signed,\" Victor said savagely; \"I\nshould have no more hesitation in killing him than stamping on a\nsnake.\"\n\n\"No, Victor; the man is a monster, but we cannot kill him in cold\nblood; besides, we should do more harm than good to the cause, for\nthe people would consider he had died a martyr to his championship\nof their rights, and would be more furious than ever against the\naristocracy.\"\n\n\"But his account of what he has gone through will have just the\nsame effect, Henri.\"\n\n\"I should think it probable he would keep the story to himself.\nWhat has happened once may happen again; and besides, his cowardice\nin signing the release of three enemies of the people in order to\nsave his life would tell against him. No, I think he would keep\nsilence. After we have got them safe away we can return and so\nfar loosen his bonds that he would be able, after a time, to free\nhimself.  Five minutes' start would be all that we should want.\"\n\nBut the plan was not destined to be carried out. It was the morning of\nthe 2d of September, 1792, and as they went down into the quarter\nwhere the magazines of old clothes were situated, in order to\npurchase the necessary disguises, they soon became sensible that\nsomething unusual was in the air. Separating, they joined the groups\nof men at the corners of the streets and tried to learn what was\ngoing on, but none seemed to know for certain. All sorts of sinister\nrumours were about. Word had been passed that the Jacobin bands\nwere to be in readiness that evening. Money had been distributed.\nThe Marseillais had dropped hints that a blow was to be struck at\nthe tyrants. Everywhere there was a suppressed excitement among\nthe working-classes; an air of gloom and terror among the bourgeois.\n\nAfter some time Harry and Victor came together again and compared\ntheir observations. Neither had learned anything definite, but both\nwere sure that something unusual was about to take place.\n\n\"It may be that a large number of fresh arrests are about to be\nmade,\" Harry said. \"There are still many deputies who withstand\nthe violence of the Mountain. It may be that a blow is going to be\nstruck against them.\"\n\n\"We must hope that that is it,\" Victor said, \"but I am terribly\nuneasy.\"\n\nHarry had the same feeling, but he did his best to reassure his\nfriend, and proposed that they should at once set about buying\nthe disguises, and that on the following morning they should carry\ninto effect their plan with reference to  Marat. The dresses were\nbought.  Two suits, such as a respectable mechanic would wear on\nSundays or holidays, were first purchased. There was then a debate\nas to the disguise for the marquise; it struck them at once that it\nwas strange for two young workmen to be purchasing female attire,\nbut, after some consultation, they decided upon a bonnet and long\ncloak, and these Victor went in and bought, gaily telling the\nshopkeeper that he was buying a birthday present for his old mother.\n\nThey took the clothes up to Harry's room, agreeing that Louise could\neasily buy the rest of the garments required for the marquise as\nsoon as she was free, but they decided to say nothing about the\nattempt that was about to be made until it was over, as it would\ncause an anxiety which the old woman would probably be unable to\nconceal from the girls.\n\nVictor did not accompany Harry to his room; they had never, indeed,\nvisited each other in their apartments, meeting always some little\ndistance away in order that their connection should be unobserved,\nand that, should one be arrested, no suspicion would follow the\nother. As soon as he had deposited the clothes Harry sallied out\nagain, and on rejoining Victor they made their way down to the\nHotel de Ville, being too anxious to remain quiet. They could learn\nnothing from the crowd which was, as usual, assembled before the\nHotel.\n\nThere was a general impression that something was about to happen,\nbut none could give any definite reason for their belief. All day\nthey wandered about restless and anxious. They fought their way\ninto the galleries of the Assembly when the doors opened, but for\na time nothing new took place.\n\nThe Assembly, in which the moderates had still a powerful voice,\nhad protested against the assumption of authority by the council of\nthe Commune sitting at the Hotel de Ville. But the Assembly lacked\nfirmness, the Commune every day gained in power. Already warrants\nof arrest were prepared against the Girondists, the early leaders\nof the movement.\n\nToo restless to remain in the Assembly, Victor and Harry again\ntook their steps to the Hotel de Ville. Just as they arrived there\ntwenty-four persons, of whom twenty-two  were priests, were brought\nout from the prison of the Maine by a party of Marseillais, who\nshouted, \"To the Abbaye!\" These ruffians pushed the prisoners into coaches\nstanding at the door, shouting: \"You will not arrive at the prison;\nthe people are waiting to tear you in pieces.\" But the people looked\non silently in sullen apathy.\n\n\"You see them,\" the Marseillais shouted. \"There they are. You are\nabout to march to Verdun. They only wait for your departure to\nbutcher your wives and children.\"\n\nStill the crowd did not move. The great mass of the people had no\nshare in the bloody deeds of the Revolution; these were the work of\na few score of violent men, backed by the refuse of the population.\nA few shouts were raised here and there of, \"Down with the priests!\"\nBut more of the crowd joined in the shouts which Victor and Harry\nlustily raised of, \"Shame, down with the Marseillais!\" Victor would\nhave pressed forward to attack the Marseillais had not Harry held\nhis arm tightly, exclaiming in his ear:\n\n\"Restrain yourself, Victor. Think of the lives that depend upon\nours. The mob will not follow you. You can do nothing yourself.\nCome, get out of the crowd.\"\n\nSo saying he dragged Victor away. It was well that they could not\nsee what was taking place in the coaches, or Victor's fury would\nhave been ungovernable, for several of the ruffians had drawn their\nswords and were hacking furiously at their prisoners.\n\n\"We will follow them,\" Harry said, when he and Victor had made\ntheir way out of the crowd; \"but you must remember, Victor, that,\ncome what may, you must keep cool. You would only throw away your\nlife uselessly; for Marie's sake you must keep calm. Your life\nbelongs to her, and you have no right to throw it away.\"\n\n\"You are right, Henri,\" Victor said gloomily; \"but how can one look\non and see men inciting others to massacre? What is going to take\nplace? We must follow them.\"\n\n\"I am ready to follow them,\" Harry said; \"but you must not go\nunless you are firmly resolved to restrain your feelings whatever\nmay happen. You can do no possible good, and will only involve\nyourself in the destruction of others.\"\n\n\"You may trust me,\" the young count said; \"I will be calm for\nMarie's sake.\"\n\nHarry had his doubts as to his friend's power of self-control, but\nhe was anxious to see what was taking place, and they joined the\nthrong that followed the coaches. But they were now in the rear,\nand could see nothing that was taking place before them. When the\ncarriages reached the Abbaye the prisoners alighted. Some of them\nwere at once cut down by the Marseillais, the rest fled into the\nhall, where one of the committees was sitting. Its members, however,\ndid nothing to protect them, and looked on while all save two were\nmassacred unresistingly. Then the Marseillais came out brandishing\ntheir bloody weapons and shouting, \"The good work has begun; down\nwith the priests! Down with the enemies of the people!\"\n\nThe better class of people in the crowd assembled at the Hotel de\nVille had not followed the procession to the Abbaye. They had been\nhorror-struck at the words and actions of the Marseillais, and\nfelt that this was the beginning of the fulfilment of the rumours\nof the last few days.\n\nThe murder of the first prisoner was indeed the signal for every\nman of thought or feeling and of heart to draw back from the\nRevolution. Thousands of earnest men who had at first thought that\nthe hour of life and liberty commenced with the meeting of the\nStates-General, and who had gone heart and  soul with that body in\nits early struggles for power, had long since shrunk back appalled\nat the new tyranny which had sprung into existence.\n\nEach act of usurpation of power by the Jacobins had alienated a\nsection. The nobles and the clergy, many of whom had at first gone\nheartily with the early reformers, had shrunk back appalled when\nthey saw that religion and monarchy were menaced. The bourgeoisie,\nwho had made the Revolution, were already to a man against it; the\nGirondists, the leaders of the third estate, had fallen away, and\nover their heads the axe was already hanging. The Revolution had\nno longer a friend in France, save among the lowest, the basest,\nand the most ignorant. And now, by the massacres of the 2d of\nSeptember, the republic of France was to stand forth in the eyes\nof Europe as a blood-stained monster, the enemy, not of kings\nonly, but of humanity in general.  Thus the crowd following the\nMarseillais was composed almost entirely of the scum of Paris,\nwretches who had long been at war with society, who hated the rich,\nhated the priests, hated all above them--men who had suffered\nso much that  they had become wild beasts, who were the products\nof that evil system of society which had now been overthrown. The\ngreater proportion of them were in the pay of the Commune, for,\ntwo days before, all the unemployed had been enrolled as the army\nof the Commune. Thus there was no repetition before the Abbaye of\nthe cries of shame which had been heard in front of the Maine. The\nshouts of the Marseillais were taken up and re-echoed by the mob.\nSavage cries, curses, and shouts for vengeance filled the air;\nmany were armed, and knives and bludgeons, swords and pikes, were\nbrandished or shaken. Blood had been tasted, and all the savage\ninstincts were on fire.\n\n\"This is horrible, Henri!\" Victor de Gisons exclaimed. \"I feel as\nif I were in a nightmare, not that any nightmare could compare in\nterror to this. Look at those hideous faces--faces of men debased\nby crime, sodden with drink, degraded below the level of brutes,\nexulting in the thought of blood, lusting for murder; and to think\nthat these creatures are the masters of France. Great Heavens! What\ncan come of it in the future? What is going to take place now?\"\n\n\"Organized massacre, I fear, Victor. What seemed incredible,\nimpossible, is going to take place; there is to be a massacre of\nthe prisoners.\"\n\nThey had by this time reached the monastery of the Carmelites, now\nconverted into a prison. Here a large number of priests had been\ncollected. The Marseillais entered, and the prisoners were called\nby name to assemble in the garden.\n\nFirst the Archbishop of Arles was murdered; then they fell upon the\nothers and hewed them down. The Bishops of Saintes and Beauvais\nwere among the slain, and the assassins did not desist until the\nlast prisoner in the Carmelites had been hacked to pieces. Graves\nhad already been dug near the Barrier Saint Jacques and carts were\nwaiting to convey the corpses there, showing how carefully the\npreparations for the massacre had been made.\n\nThen the Marseillais returned to the Abbaye, and, with a crowd\nof followers, entered the great hall. Here the bailiff Maillard\norganized a sort of tribunal of men taken at random from the\ncrowd. Some of these were paid hirelings of the Commune, some were\nterrified workmen or small tradesmen who had, merely from curiosity,\njoined the mob. The Swiss officers and soldiers, who were, with the\npriests, special objects of hatred to the mob,  were first brought\nout. They were spared the farce of a trial, they were ordered to\nmarch out through the doors, outside which the Marseillais were\nawaiting them. Some hesitated to go out, and cried for mercy.\n\nA young man with head erect was the first to pass through the fatal\ndoors. He fell in a moment, pierced with pikes. The rest followed\nhim, and all save two, who were, by some caprice of the mob,\nspared, shared his fate. The mob had crowded into the galleries\nwhich surrounded the hall and applauded with ferocious yells the\nmurder of the soldiers. In the body of the hall a space was kept\nclear by the armed followers of the Commune round the judges' table,\nand a pathway to the door from the interior of the prison to that\nopening into the street.\n\nWhen the Swiss had been massacred the trial of the other prisoners\ncommenced. One after another the prisoners were brought out. They\nwere asked their names and occupations, a few questions followed,\nand then the verdict of \"Guilty.\" One after another they were\nconducted to the door and there slain. Two or three by the wittiness\nof their answers amused the mob and were thereupon acquitted,\nthe acquittals being greeted by the spectators as heartily as the\nsentences of death.\n\nVictor and Harry were in the lowest gallery. They stood back from\nthe front, but between the heads of those before them they could see\nwhat was going on below. Victor stood immovable, his face as pale\nas death. His cap had fallen off, his hair was dank with perspiration,\nhis eyes had a look of concentrated horror, his body shook with\na spasmodic shuddering. In vain Harry, when he once saw what was\ngoing to take place, urged him in a low whisper to leave. He did\nnot appear to hear, and even when Harry pulled him by the sleeve\nof his blouse he seemed equally unconscious. Harry was greatly\nalarmed, and feared that every moment his companion would betray\nhimself by some terrible out-burst.\n\nAfter the three or four first prisoners had been disposed of,\na tall and stately man was brought into the hall. A terrible cry,\nwhich sounded loud even above the tumult which reigned, burst from\nVictor's lips. He threw himself with the fury of a madman upon those\nin front of him, and in a moment would have bounded into the hall\nhad not Harry brought the heavy stick he carried with all his force\ndown upon his head. Victor fell like a log under the blow.\n\n\"What is it?  What is it?\" shouted those around.\n\n\"My comrade has gone out of his mind,\" Harry said quietly; \"he\nhas been drinking for some days, and his hatred for the enemies\nof France has turned his head. I have been watching him, and had\nI not knocked him down he would have thrown himself head-foremost\noff the gallery and broken his neck.\"\n\nThe explanation seemed natural, and all were too interested in\nwhat was passing in the hall below to pay further attention to so\ntrivial an incident. It was well that Harry had caught sight of the\nprisoner before Victor did so and was prepared for the out-break,\nfor it was the Duc de Gisons who had thus been led in to murder.\nHarry dragged Victor back against the wall behind and then tried\nto lift him.\n\n\"I will lend you a hand,\" a tall man in the dress of a mechanic,\nwho had been standing next to him, said, and, lifting Victor's body\non to his shoulder, made his way to the top of the stairs, Harry\npreceding him and opening a way through the crowd. In another minute\nthey were in the open air.\n\n\"Thank you greatly,\" Harry said. \"I do not know how I should have\nmanaged without your aid. If you put him down here I will try and\nbring him round.\"\n\n\"I live not far from here,\" the man said. \"I will take him to my\nroom. You need not be afraid,\" he added as Harry hesitated, \"I have\ngot my eyes open, you can trust me.\"\n\nSo saying he made his way through the crowd gathered outside.  He\nwas frequently asked who he was carrying, for the crowd feared lest\nany of their prey should escape; but the man's reply, given with\na rough laugh--\"It is a lad whose stomach is not strong enough to\nbear the sight of blood, and I tell you it is pretty hot in\nthere,\"--satisfied them.\n\nPassing through several streets the man entered a small house and\ncarried Victor to the attic and laid him on a bed, then he carefully\nclosed the door and struck a light.\n\n\"You struck hard, my friend,\" he said as he examined Victor's head.\n\"Ma foi, I should not have liked such a blow myself, but I don't\nblame you. You were but just in time to prevent his betraying\nhimself, and better a hundred times a knock on the head than those\npikes outside the door. I had my eye on him, and felt sure he would\ndo something rash, and I had intended to choke him, but he was too\nquick for me. How came you to be so foolish as to be there?\"\n\n\"We had friends in the prison, and we thought we might do something\nto save them,\" Harry answered, for he saw that it would be his best\npolicy to be frank. \"It was his father whom they brought out.\"\n\n\"It was rash of you, young sir. A kid might as well try to save his\nmother from the tiger who has laid its paw upon her as for you to\ntry to rescue any one from the clutches of the mob. Mon Dieu! To\nthink that in the early days I was fool enough to go down to the\nAssembly and cheer the deputies; but I have seen my mistake. What\nhas it brought us? A ruined trade, an empty cupboard, and to be\nruled by the ruffians of the slums instead of the king, the clergy,\nand the upper classes. I was a brass-worker, and a good one, though\nI say it myself, and earned good wages. Now for the last month\nI haven't done a stroke of work. Who wants to buy brass-work when\nthere are mansions and shops to pillage? And now, what are you\ngoing to do?  My wife is out, but she will probably be back soon.\nWe will attend to this young fellow. She is a good nurse, and I\ntell you I think he will need all we can do for him.\"\n\n\"You don't think I have seriously injured him?\" Harry said in a\ntone of dismay.\n\n\"No, no; don't make yourself uneasy. You have stunned him, and\nthat's all; he will soon get over that. I have seen men get worse\nknocks in a drunken row and be at work again in the morning; but\nit is different here. I saw his face, and he was pretty nearly mad\nwhen you struck him. I doubt whether he will be in his right senses\nwhen he comes round; but never fear, we will look after him well.\nYou can stay if you like; but if you want to go you can trust him\nto us. I see you can keep your head, and will not run into danger\nas he did.\"\n\n\"I do want to go terribly,\" Harry said, \"terribly; and I feel\nthat I can trust you completely. You have saved his life and mine\nalready.  Now you will not be hurt at what I am going to say. He\nis the son of the Duc de Gisons, the last man we  saw brought out\nto be murdered.  We have plenty of money. In a belt round his waist\nyou will find a hundred louis. Please do not spare them. If you\nthink he wants a surgeon call him in, and get everything necessary\nfor your household.  While you are nursing him you cannot go out\nto work. I do not talk of reward; one cannot reward kindness like\nyours; but while you are looking after him you and your wife must\nlive.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" the man said, shaking Harry by the hand. \"You speak\nlike a man of heart. I will look after him. You need be under no\nuneasiness. Should any of my comrades come in I shall say: 'this\nis a young workman who got knocked down and hurt in the crowd, and\nwhom, having nothing better to do, I have brought in here.\"'\n\n\"If he should recover his senses before I come back,\" Harry said,\n\"please do not let him know it was I who struck him. He will\nbe well-nigh heart-broken that he could not share the fate of his\nfather.  Let him think that he was knocked down by some one in the\ncrowd.\"\n\n\"All right! That is easily managed,\" the man said. \"Jacques Medart\nis no fool. Now you had best be off, for I see you are on thorns,\nand leave me to bathe his head. If you shouldn't come back you can\ndepend upon it I will look after him till he is able to go about\nagain.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMarie Arrested\n\n\nOn leaving Victor in the care of the man who had so providentially\ncame to his aid, Harry hurried down the street towards the Abbaye,\nthen he stopped to think--should he return there or make his way\nto the Bicetre.  He could not tell whether his friends had, like\nthe Duc de Gisons, been removed to the Abbaye. If they had been\nso, it was clearly impossible for him to aid them in any way.  They\nmight already have fallen. The crowd was too great for him to regain\nthe gallery, and even there could only witness, without power to\navert, their murder. Were they still at the Bicetre he might do\nsomething. Perhaps the assassins had not yet arrived there.\n\nIt was now nine o'clock in the evening. The streets were almost\ndeserted. The respectable inhabitants all remained within their\nhouses, trembling at the horrors, of which reports had circulated\nduring the afternoon. At first there had been hopes that the Assembly\nwould take steps to put a stop to the massacre, but the Assembly\ndid nothing.  Danton and the ministers were absent. The cannon's\nroar and the tocsin sounded perpetually. There was no secret as to\nwhat was going on. The Commune had the insolence to send commissioners\nto the bar of the Assembly to state that the people wished to break\nopen the doors of the prisons, and this when two hundred priests\nhad already been butchered at the Carmelites.\n\nA deputation indeed went to the Abbaye to try to persuade the murderers\nto desist; but their voices were drowned in the tumultuous cries.\nThe Commune of Paris openly directed the massacre. Billaud-Varennes\nwent backwards and  forwards to superintend the execution of his\norders, and promised the executioners twenty-four francs a day.\nThe receipt for the payment of this blood-money still exists.\n\nOn arriving in front of the Bicetre Harry found all was silent\nthere, and with a faint feeling of hope that the massacre would not\nextend beyond the Abbaye, he again turned his steps in that direction.\n\nThe bloody work was still going on, and Harry wandered away into\nthe quiet streets to avoid hearing the shrieks of the victims and\nthe yells of the crowd. A sudden thought struck him, and he went\nalong until he saw a woman come out of a house. He ran up to her.\n\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"I have the most urgent need of a bonnet and\nshawl. Will you sell me those you have on? The shops are all shut,\nor I would not trouble you. You have only to name your price, and\nI will pay you.\"\n\nThe woman was surprised at this proposition, but seeing that a good\nbargain was to be made she asked twice the cost of the articles\nwhen new, and this Harry paid her without question.\n\nWrapping the shawl and bonnet into a bundle, he retraced his steps,\nand sat down on some doorsteps within a distance of the Abbaye\nwhich would enable him to observe any general movement of the crowd\nin front of the prison. At one o'clock in the morning there was a\nstir, and the body of men with pikes moved down the street.\n\n\"They are going to La Force,\" he said, after following them for some\ndistance. \"Oh, if I had but two or three hundred English soldiers\nhere we would make mincemeat of these murderers!\"\n\nHarry did not enter La Force, where the scenes that were taking\nplace at the Abbaye--for, in spite of the speed with which the mock\ntrials were hurried through, these massacres were not yet finished\nthere, so great was the number of prisoners--were repeated.\n\nAt La Force many ladies were imprisoned, among them the Princess de\nLamballe. They shared the fate of the male prisoners, being hewn\nto pieces by sabres. The head of the princess was cut off and stuck\nupon a pike, and was carried in triumph under the windows of the\nTemple, where the king and queen were confined, and was held up to\nthe bars of the room they occupied for them to see. Marie Antoinette,\nfearless for herself, fainted at the terrible sight of the pale\nhead of her friend.\n\nHarry remained at a little distance from La Force, tramping\nrestlessly up and down, half-mad with rage and horror, and at his\npowerlessness to interfere in any way with the proceedings of the\nwretches who were carrying on the work of murder. At last, about\neight o'clock in the morning, a boy ran by.\n\n\"They have finished with them at the Abbaye,\" he said with fiendish\nglee. \"They are going from there to the Bicetre.\"\n\nHarry with difficulty repressed his desire to slay the urchin, and\nhurried away to reach the prison of Bicetre before the band from the\nAbbaye arrived there. Unfortunately he came down by a side street\nupon them when they were within a few hundred yards of the prison.\nHis great hope was that he might succeed in penetrating with the\nMarseillais and find the marquise, and aid her in making her way\nthrough the mob in the disguise he had purchased.\n\nBut here, as at the other prisons, there was a method in the work\nof murder. The agents of the Commune took possession of the hall\nat the entrance and permitted none to pass farther into the prison,\nthe warders and officials bringing down the prisoners in batches,\nand so handing them over for slaughter. In vain Harry tried to\npenetrate into the inner part of the prison. He was roughly repulsed\nby the men guarding the door; and at last, finding that nothing\ncould be done, he forced his way out again into the open air, and\nhurrying away for some distance, threw himself on the ground and\nburst into a passion of tears.\n\nAfter a time he rose and made his way back to the house where he\nhad left Victor de Gisons. He found him in a state of delirium,\nacting over and over again the scene in the Abbaye, cursing the\njudge and executioners, and crying out he would die with his father.\n\n\"What does the doctor think of him?\" he asked the woman who was\nsitting by Victor's bed.\n\n\"He did not say much,\" the woman replied. \"He shook his head, and\nsaid there had been a terrible mental shock, and that he could not\nanswer either for his life or reason. There was nothing to do but\nto be patient, to keep his head bandaged with wet cloths, and to\ngive him water from time to time. Do not be afraid, sir; we will\nwatch over him carefully.\"\n\n\"I would stay here if I could,\" Harry said; \"but I have others\nI must see about. I have the terrible news to break to some young\nladies of the murder of their father and mother.\"\n\n\"Poor things! Poor things!\" the woman said, shaking her head.  \"It\nis terrible! My husband was telling me what he saw; and a neighbour\ncame in just now and said it was the same thing at all the other\nprisons. The priest, too--our priest at the little church at the\ncorner of the street, where I used to go in every morning to pray\non my way to market--he was dragged away ten days ago to the\nCarmelites, and now he is a saint in heaven. How is it, sir, that\nGod allows such things to be?\"\n\n\"We cannot tell,\" Harry said sadly. \"As for myself, I can hardly\nbelieve it, though I saw it. They say there are over four thousand\npeople in the prisons, and they will all be murdered. Such a thing\nwas never heard of. I can hardly believe that I am not in a dream\nnow.\"\n\n\"You look almost like one dead yourself,\" the woman said pityingly.\n\"I have made a bouillon for Jacques' breakfast and mine.  It is\njust ready. Do take a mouthful before you go out. That and a piece\nof bread and a cup of red wine will do you good.\"\n\nHarry was on the point of refusing; but he felt that he was utterly\nworn and exhausted, and that he must keep up his strength.  Her\nhusband, therefore, took her place by Victor's bedside in readiness\nto hold him down should he try to get up in his ravings, while\nthe good woman ladled out a basin of the broth and placed it with\na piece of bread and some wine on the table. Harry forced himself\nto drink it, and when he rose from the table he already felt the\nbenefit of the meal.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" he said. \"I feel stronger now; but how I\nam to tell the story I do not know. But I must make quite certain\nbefore I go to these poor girls that their parents were killed.\nThree or four were spared at the Abbaye. Possibly it may have been\nthe same thing at the Bicetre.\"\n\nSo Harry went back and waited outside the prison until the bloody\nwork was over; but found on questioning those who came out when\nall was done that the thirst for blood had increased with killing,\nand that all the prisoners found in the Bicetre had been put to\ndeath.\n\n\"Ma foi!\" the man whom he was speaking to said; \"but these accursed\naristocrats have courage. Men and women were alike; there was not\none of them but faced the judges bravely and went to their death\nas calmly as if to dinner. There was a marquis and his wife--the\nMarquis de St. Caux they called him.  They brought them out together.\nThey were asked whether they had anything to say why they should\nnot be punished for their crimes against France. The marquis laughed\naloud.\n\n\"'Crimes!' he said. 'Do you think a Marquis de St. Caux is going\nto plead for his life to a band of murderers and assassins? Come,\nmy love.'\n\n\"He just gave her one kiss, and then took her hand as if they were\ngoing to walk a minuet together, and then led her down between the\nlines of guards with his head erect and a smile of scorn on his\nface. She did not smile, but her step never faltered. I watched\nher closely. She was very pale, and she did not look proud, but\nshe walked as calmly and steadily as her husband till they reached\nthe door where the pikemen were awaiting them, and then it was\nover in a minute, and they died without a cry or a groan. They are\nwretches, the aristocrats. They have fattened on the life-blood of\nthe people; but they know how to die, these people.\"\n\nWithout a word Harry turned away. He had told himself there was no\nhope; but he knew by the bitter pang he felt now that he had hoped\nto the last. Then he walked slowly away to tell the news.\n\nThere were comparatively few people about the streets, and these\nall of the lower order. Every shop was closed. Men with scared faces\nstood at some of the doors to gather the news from passers-by, and\npale women looked timidly from the upper windows. When he reached\nthe house he could not summon courage to enter it, but stood for a\nlong time outside, until at last he saw Louise Moulin put her head\nfrom the window. He succeeded in catching her eye, and placing his\nfinger on his lips signed to her to come down. A minute later she\nappeared at the door.\n\n\"Is it all true, Monsieur Sandwith? They say they are murdering\nthe prisoners. Surely it must be false! They could never do such\na thing!\"\n\n\"It is true, Louise. I have seen it myself. I went with a disguise\nto try and rescue our dear lady, even if I could not save the\nmarquis; but I could not get to her--the wretches have murdered\nthem both.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear lady!\" the old woman cried, bursting into tears.  \"The\npretty babe I nursed. To think of her murdered; and the poor young\nthings upstairs--what shall I do!--what shall I do, Monsieur\nSandwith!\"\n\n\"You must break it to them, Louise. Do they know how great the\ndanger is?\"\n\n\"No. I have kept it from them. They can see from the window that\nsomething unusual is going on; everyone can see that. But I told\nthem it was only that the Prussians were advancing. They are\nanxious--very anxious--but they are quite unprepared for this.\"\n\n\"Break it gradually, Louise. Tell them first that there are rumours\nthat the prisons have been attacked. Come down again presently as\nif to get more news, and then tell them that there are reports that\nthe prisoners have been massacred, and then at last tell them all\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"But will you not come up, Monsieur Sandwith--they trust you so\nmuch? Your presence will be a support to them.\"\n\n\"I could do nothing now,\" Harry said sadly. \"God only can console\nthem. They had best be by themselves for awhile. I will come in this\nevening. The first burst of grief will be over then, and my talk\nmay aid them to rouse themselves. Oh, if we had but tried to get\nthem out of prison sooner. And yet who could have foreseen that here\nin Paris thousands of innocent prisoners, men and women, would be\nmurdered in cold blood!\"\n\nFinding that she could not persuade Harry to enter, Louise turned\nto perform her painful duty; while Harry, thoroughly exhausted with\nthe night of horrors, made his way home, and throwing himself on\nthe bed, fell asleep, and did not wake until evening. His first step\nwas to plunge his head into water, and then, after a good wash, to\nprepare a meal. His sleep had restored his energy, and with brisk\nsteps he made his way through the streets to Louise Moulin. He\nknocked with his knuckles at the outer door of her apartments. The\nold nurse opened it quietly.\n\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"and sit down. They are in their room, and\nI think they have cried themselves to sleep. My heart has been\nbreaking all day to see them. It has been dreadful. Poor little\nVirginie cried terribly, and sobbed for hours;  but it was a long\ntime before the others cried. Marie fainted, and when I got her\nround lay still and quiet without speaking. Jeanne was worst of\nall. She sat on that chair with her eyes staring open and her face\nas white as if she were dead. She did not seem to hear anything I\nsaid; but at last, when Virginie's sobs were stopping, I began to\ntalk to her about her mother and her pretty ways when she was a\nchild, and then at last Jeanne broke down, and she cried so wildly\nthat I was frightened, and then Marie cried too; and after a while\nI persuaded them all to lie down; and as I have not heard a sound\nfor the last hour I hope the good God has sent them all to sleep.\"\n\n\"I trust so indeed, Louise. I will stay here quietly for an hour,\nand then if we hear nothing I will go home, and be back again in\nthe morning. Sleep will do more for them than anything I can say.\"\n\nAt the end of an hour all was still quiet, and Harry with a somewhat\nlightened heart took his departure.\n\nAt nine o'clock next morning he was again at the house. When he\nentered Virginie ran to him, and throwing her arms round his neck\nagain burst into a passion of tears. Harry felt that this was the\nbest thing that could have happened, for the others were occupied\nfor some time in trying to soothe her, crying quietly to themselves\nwhile they did so. At last her sobs became less violent.\n\n\"And now, Harry,\" Marie said, turning to him, \"will you tell us\nall about it?\"\n\n\"I will tell you only that your dear father and mother died, as\nyou might be sure they would, calmly and fearlessly, and that they\nsuffered but little. More than that I cannot tell you now. Some day\nfarther on, when you can bear it, I will tell you of the events of\nthe last forty-eight hours. At present I myself dare not think of\nit, and it would harm you to know it.\n\n\"Do not, I pray you, ask me any questions now. We must think of\nthe future. Fortunately you passed unsuspected the last time they\nsearched the house; but it may not be so another time. You may be\nsure that these human tigers will not be satisfied with the blood\nthey have shed, but that they will long for fresh victims. The\nprisons are empty now, but they will soon be filled again. We must\ntherefore turn our thoughts to your making your escape from the\ncity. I fear that there is peril everywhere; but it must be faced.\nI think it will be useless for us to try and reach the  frontier\nby land. At every town and village they will be on the look-out\nfor fugitives, and whatever disguise you might adopt you could not\nescape observation. I think, then, that we must make for the sea\nand hire a fishing-boat to take us across to England.\n\n\"But we must not hurry. In the first place, we must settle all\nour plans carefully and prepare our disguises; in the next place,\nthere will be such tremendous excitement when the news of what has\nhappened here is known that it would be unsafe to travel. I think\nmyself it will be best to wait a little until there is a lull. That\nis what I want you to think over and decide.\n\n\"I do not think there is any very great danger here for the next\nfew days. For a little time they will be tired of slaying; and,\nfrom what I hear, the Girondists are marked out as the next victims.\nThey say Danton has denounced them at the Jacobin Club. At any\nrate it will be better to get everything in readiness for flight,\nso that we can leave at once if we hear of any fresh measures for\na search after suspects.\"\n\nHarry was pleased to find that his suggestion answered the purpose\nfor which he made it. The girls began to discuss the disguises\nwhich would be required and the best route to be taken, and their\nthoughts were for a time turned from the loss they had sustained.\nAfter an hour's talk he left them greatly benefited by his visit.\n\nFor the next few days Harry spent his time for the most part by\nthe bedside of Victor de Gisons. The fever was still at its height,\nand the doctor gave but small hopes of his recovery. Harry determined\nthat he would not leave Paris until the issue was decided one way\nor the other, and when with the girls he discouraged any idea of\nan immediate flight. This was the more easy, for the news from the\nprovinces showed that the situation was everywhere as bad as it\nwas at the capital.\n\nThe Commune had sent to all the committees acting in connection with\nthem in the towns throughout the country the news of the execution\nof the enemies of France confined in the prisons, and had urged\nthat a similar step should at once be taken with reference to all\nthe prisoners in their hands. The order was promptly obeyed, and\nthroughout France massacres similar to those in Paris were at once\ncarried out. A carnival of murder and horror had commenced, and the\nmadness for blood  raged throughout the whole country. Such being\nthe case, Harry found it by no means difficult to dissuade the\ngirls from taking instant steps towards making their escape.\n\nHe was, however, in a state of great uneasiness. Many of the moderate\ndeputies had been seized, others had sought safety in flight, and\nthe search for suspected persons was carried on vigorously.  Difficult\nand dangerous as it would be to endeavour to travel through France\nwith three girls, he would have attempted it without hesitation\nrather than remain in Paris had it not been for Victor de Gisons.\n\nOne day a week after the massacres at the prisons he received\nanother terrible shock. He had bought a paper from one of the men\nshouting them for sale in the street, and sat down in the garden of\nthe Tuileries to read it. A great portion of the space was filled\nwith lists of the enemies of the people who had been, as it was\ncalled, executed. As these lists had formed the staple of news for\nseveral days Harry scarce glanced at the names, his eye travelling\nrapidly down the list until he gave a start and a low cry. Under\nthe heading of persons executed at Lille were the names of Ernest\nde St. Caux, Jules de St. Caux, Pierre du Tillet--\"aristocrats\narrested, August 15th, in the act of endeavouring to leave\nFrance in disguise.\"\n\nFor some time Harry sat as if stunned. He had scarce given a thought\nto his friends since that night they had left, the affairs of the\nmarquis and his wife, of their daughters, and of Victor de Gisons,\nalmost excluding everything else. When he thought of the boys it\nhad been as already in England, under the charge of du Tillet.\n\nHe had thought, that if they had been arrested on the way he\nshould have been sure to hear of it; and he had such confidence in\nthe sagacity of Monsieur du Tillet that he had looked upon it as\nalmost certain he would be able to lead his two charges through\nany difficulty and danger which might beset them. And now he knew\nthat his hopes had been ill founded--that his friends had been\narrested when almost within sight of the frontier, and had been\nmurdered as soon as the news of the massacres in Paris had reached\nLille.\n\nHe felt crushed with the blow. A warm affection had sprung up between\nhim and Ernest, while from the first the younger boy had attached\nhimself to him; and now they were dead, and the girls were alone\nin the world, save for himself and the poor young fellow tossing\nwith fever! It was true that if  his friends had reached England\nin safety they could not have aided him in the task he had before\nhim of getting the girls away; still their deaths somehow seemed\nto add to his responsibilities.\n\nUpon one thing he determined at once, and that was, that until his\ncharges were safely in England they should not hear a whisper of\nthis new and terrible misfortune which had befallen them.\n\nIn order to afford the girls some slight change, and anxious at their\npale faces, the result of grief and of their unwonted confinement,\nLouise Moulin had persuaded them to go out with her in the early\nmornings when she went to the markets. The fear of detection was\nsmall, for the girls had now become accustomed to their thick shoes\nand rough dress; and indeed she thought that it would be safer to\ngo out, for the suspicions of her neighbours might be excited if\nthe girls remained secluded in the house. Harry generally met them\nsoon after they started, and accompanied them in their walk.\n\nOne morning he was walking with the two younger girls, while Marie\nand the old nurse were together a short distance in front of them.\nThey had just reached the flower-market, which was generally the\nmain object of their walks--for the girls, having passed most\nof their time in the country, were passionately fond of flowers--when\na man on horseback wearing a red sash, which showed him to be\nan official of the republic, came along at a foot-pace. His eyes\nfell upon Marie's face and rested there, at first with the look of\nrecognition, followed by a start of surprise and satisfaction. He\nreined in his horse instantly, with the exclamation:\n\n\"Mademoiselle de St. Caux!\"\n\nFor a moment she shrank back, her cheek paler even than before;\nthen recovering herself she said calmly:\n\n\"It is myself, Monsieur Lebat.\"\n\n\"Citizen Lebat,\" he corrected. \"You forget, there are no titles\nnow--we have changed all that. It goes to my heart,\" he went on with\na sneer, \"to be obliged to do my duty; but however unpleasant it\nis, it must be done. Citizens,\" he said, raising his voice, \"I want\ntwo men well disposed to the state.\"\n\nAs to be ill disposed meant danger if not death, several men within\nhearing at once came forward.\n\n\"This female citizen is an aristocrat in disguise,\" he went on,\npointing to Marie; \"in virtue of my office as deputy of Dijon and\nmember of the Committee of Public Safety, I arrest her and give\nher into your charge. Where is the person who was with her? Seize\nher also on a charge of harbouring an enemy of the state!\"\n\nBut Louise was gone. The moment Lebat had looked round in search\nof assistance Marie had whispered in Louise's ear: \"Fly, Louise,\nfor the sake of the children; if you are arrested they are lost!\"\n\nHad she herself been alone concerned, the old woman would have stood\nby Marie and shared her fate; but the words \"for the sake of the\nchildren\" decided her, and she had instantly slipped away among\nthe crowd, whose attention had been called by Lebat's first words,\nand dived into a small shop, where she at once began to bargain\nfor some eggs.\n\n\"Where is the woman?\" Lebat repeated angrily.\n\n\"What is she like?\" one of the bystanders asked.\n\nBut Lebat could give no description whatever of her. He had noticed\nthat Marie was speaking to some one when he first caught sight of\nher face; but he had noticed nothing more, and did not know whether\nthe woman was young or old.\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" he said in a tone of vexation. \"Never mind; we\nshall find her later on. This capture is the most important.\"\n\nSo saying he set out, with Marie walking beside him, with a guard\non either hand. In the next street he came on a party of four of\nthe armed soldiers of the Commune, and ordered them to take the\nplace of those he had first charged with the duty, and directed\nthem to proceed with him to the Maine.\n\nMarie was taken at once before the committee sitting en permanence\nfor the discovery and arrest of suspects.\n\n\"I charge this young woman with being an aristocrat in disguise.\nShe is the daughter of the ci-devant Marquis de St. Caux, who was\nexecuted on the 2d of September at Bicetre.\"\n\n\"Murdered, you mean, sir,\" Marie said in a clear haughty voice.\n\"Why not call things by their proper name?\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Lebat went on, not heeding the interruption, \"that\nit should fall to my lot to denounce her, for I acknowledge that\nin the days before our glorious Revolution commenced I have visited\nat her father's chateau. But I feel that my duty to the republic\nstands before any private considerations.\"\n\n\"You have done perfectly right,\" the president of the committee\nsaid. \"As I understand that the accused does not deny that she\nis the daughter of the ci-devant marquis, I will at once sign the\norder for her committal to La Force. There is room there still,\nthough the prisons are filling up again fast.\"\n\n\"We must have another jail delivery,\" one of the committee laughed\nbrutally; and a murmur of assent passed through the chamber.\n\nThe order was made out, and Marie was handed over to the armed\nguard, to be taken with the next batch of prisoners to La Force.\n\nHarry was some twenty yards behind Marie and her companion when\nLebat checked his horse before her. He recognized the man instantly,\nand saw that Marie's disguise was discovered. His first impulse\nwas to rush forward to her assistance, but the hopelessness of any\nattempt at interference instantly struck him, and to the surprise\nof the two girls, who were looking into a shop, and had not noticed\nwhat was occurring, he turned suddenly with them down a side street.\n\n\"What are you doing, Harry? We shall lose the others in the crowd\nif we do not keep them in sight,\" Jeanne said.\n\n\"I know what I am doing, Jeanne; I will tell you presently.\" He walked\nalong several streets until he came to an unfrequented thoroughfare.\n\n\"There is something wrong, Harry. I see it in your face!\" Jeanne\nexclaimed. \"Tell us at once.\n\n\"It is bad news,\" Harry said quietly. \"Try and nerve yourselves,\nmy dear girls, for you will need all your courage. Marie is captured.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry!\" Virginie exclaimed, bursting into tears, while Jeanne\nstood still and motionless.\n\n\"Why are you taking us away?\" she said in a hard sharp voice which\nHarry would not have recognized as hers. \"Our place is with her,\nand where she goes we will go. You have no right to lead us away.\nWe will go back to her at once.\"\n\n\"You can do her no good, Jeanne, dear,\" Harry said gently. \"You\ncould not help her, and it would only add to her misery if Virginie\nand you were also in their hands. Besides, we can be of more use\noutside. Trust to me, Jeanne; I will do all in my power to save\nher, whatever the risk.\"\n\n\"You could not save our father and mother,\" Jeanne said with a\nquivering lip.\n\n\"No, dear; but I would have saved them had there been but a little\ntime to do so. This time I hope to be more successful. Courage,\nJeanne! Do not give way; I depend on your clear head to help me.\nBesides, till we can get her back, you have to fill Marie's place\nand look after Virginie.\"\n\nThe appeal was successful, and Jeanne burst into a passion of\ntears. Harry did not try to check them, and in a short time the\nsobs ceased and Jeanne raised her head again.\n\n\"I feel better now,\" she said. \"Come, Virginie, and dry your eyes,\ndarling; we shall have plenty of time to cry afterwards. Are we to\ngo home, Harry? Have they taken Louise?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Jeanne; that is the first thing to find out, for\nif they have, it will not be safe for you to return. Let us push on\nnow, so that if she has not been taken we shall reach home before\nher. We will place ourselves at the corner of your street and wait\nfor an hour; she may spend some time in looking for us, but if she\ndoes not come by the end of that time I shall feel sure that it\nis because she cannot come, and in that case I must look out for\nanother place for you.\"\n\nThey hurried on until they were nearly home, the brisk walk having,\nas Harry had calculated it would do, had the effect of preventing\ntheir thoughts from dwelling upon Marie's capture. They had not\nbeen more than a quarter of an hour at their post when Harry gave\nan exclamation of satisfaction as he saw Louise Moulin approaching.\nThe two girls hurried to meet her.\n\n\"Thank God you are both safe, dears!\" she exclaimed with tears\nstreaming down her cheeks. \"I thought of you in the middle of it\nall; but I was sure that Monsieur Sandwith would see what was being\ndone and would get you away.\"\n\n\"And you, Louise,\" said Harry, who had now come up, \"how did you\nget away? I have been terribly anxious, thinking that they might\nseize you too, and that would have been dreadful.\"\n\n\"So they would have done,\" the old woman said; \"but when that evil\nman looked away for a moment, mademoiselle whispered, 'Fly, Louise,\nfor the children's sake!' and I slipped away into the crowd without\neven stopping to think, and ran into a shop; and it was well I did,\nfor he shouted to them to seize me too, but I was gone, and as I\ndon't think he noticed me before, they could not find me; and as\nsoon as they had all moved away I came out. I looked for you for\nsome time, and then made up my mind that Monsieur Sandwith had come\non home with you.\"\n\n\"So I did, you see,\" Harry said; \"but I did not dare to go in until\nwe knew whether you had been taken too. If you had not come after\na time we should have looked for another lodging, though I knew\nwell enough that you would not tell them where you lived.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" the old woman said. \"They might have cut me in pieces\nwithout getting a single word from me as to where I lived.  Still\nthey might have found out somehow, for they would have been sure to\nhave published the fact that I had been taken, with a description\nof me. Then the neighbours would have said, 'This description is\nlike Louise Moulin, and she is missing;' and then they would have\ntalked, and the end of it would have been you would have been\ndiscovered. Will you come home with us, Monsieur Sandwith?\"\n\n\"I will come after it's dark, Louise. The less my visits are noticed\nthe better.\"\n\n\"This is awful!\" Harry said to himself as he turned away. \"The\nmarquis and his wife massacred, Ernest and Jules murdered, Marie\nin prison, Victor mad with fever, Jeanne and Virginie with no one\nto trust to but me, my people at home in a frightful state of mind\nabout me. It is awful to think of. It's enough to drive a fellow\nout of his senses. Well, I will go and see how Victor is going on.\nThe doctor thought there was a change yesterday. Poor fellow! If\nhe comes to his senses I shall have hard work to keep the truth\nabout Marie from him. It would send him off again worse than ever\nif he had an idea of it.\"\n\n\"And how is your patient to-day, madame?\" he asked, as Victor's\nnurse opened the door to him.\n\n\"He is quieter, much quieter,\" she replied. \"I think he is too weak\nto rave any longer; but otherwise he's just the same. He lies with\nhis eyes open, talking sometimes to himself, but I cannot make out\nany sense in what he says. The  doctor has been here this morning,\nand he says that he thinks another two days will decide. If he does\nnot take a turn then he will die. If he does, he may live, but even\nthen he may not get his reason again. Poor young fellow! I feel\nfor him almost as if he were my son, and so does Jacques.\"\n\n\"You are both very good, madame,\" Harry said, \"and my friend is\nfortunate indeed to have fallen into such good hands. I will sit\nwith him for three or four hours now, and you had better go and\nget a little fresh air.\"\n\n\"That I will, monsieur. Jacques is asleep. He was up with him all\nlast night, and I had a good night. He would have it so.\"\n\n\"Quite right!\" Harry said. \"You must not knock yourself up, madame.\nYou are too useful to others for us to let you do that. Tomorrow\nnight I will take my turn.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nRobespierre\n\n\nAfter dark Harry presented himself at Louise Moulin's.\n\n\"Have you thought of anything, Harry?\" was Jeanne's first question.\nShe was alone, for Louise was cooking, and Virginie had lain down\nand cried herself to sleep.\n\n\"I have thought of a number of things,\" he replied, for while he\nhad been sitting by Victor's bedside he had turned over in his mind\nevery scheme by which he could get Marie out of prison, \"but at\npresent I have fixed upon nothing. I cannot carry out our original\nplan of seizing Marat. It would require more than one to carry\nout such a scheme, and the friend whom I relied upon before can no\nlonger aid me.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Jeanne asked quietly. \"Is it Victor de Gisons?\"\n\n\"What! Bless me, Jeanne!\" Harry exclaimed in surprise. \"How did\nyou guess that?\"\n\n\"I felt sure it was Victor all along,\" the girl said. \"In the first\nplace, I never believed that he had gone away. Marie told me she\nhad begged and prayed him to go, and that he had only gone to please\nher. She seemed to think it was right he should go, but I didn't\nthink so. A gentleman would not run away and leave anyone he liked\nbehind, even if she told him. It was not likely. Why, here are\nyou staying here and risking your life for us, though we are not\nrelated to you and have no claim upon you. And how could Victor\nrun away?  But as Marie seemed pleased to think he was safe, I said\nnothing; but I know, if he had gone, and some day they had been\nmarried, I should never have looked upon him as a brother. But I\nfelt sure he wouldn't do it, and that he was in Paris still. Then,\nagain, you did not tell us the name of the friend who was working\nwith you, and I felt sure you must have some reason for your\nsilence. So, putting the two things together, I was sure that it\nwas Victor. What has happened to him?  Is he in prison too?\"\n\n\"No, he is not in prison, Jeanne,\" Harry said, \"but he is very\nill.\" And he related the whole circumstances of Victor's fever.\n\"I blamed myself awfully at first for having hit him so hard, as\nyou may suppose, Jeanne; but the doctor says he thinks it made no\ndifference, and that Victor's delirium is due to the mental shock\nand not in any way to the blow on the head. Still I should not like\nyour sister to know it. I am very glad you have guessed the truth,\nfor it is a comfort to talk things over with you.\"\n\n\"Poor Marie!\" Jeanne said softly. \"It is well she never knew about\nit. The thought he had got safely away kept her up. And now, tell\nme about your plans. Could I not take Victor's place and help you to\nseize Marat? I am not strong, you know; but I could hold a knife,\nand tell him I would kill him if he cried out. I don't think I\ncould, you know, but he wouldn't know that.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that wouldn't do, Jeanne,\" Harry said with a slight\nsmile, shaking his head. \"It was a desperate enterprise for two of\nus.  Besides, it would never do for you to run the risk of being\nseparated from Virginie. Remember you are father and mother and\nelder sister to her now. The next plan I thought of was to try and\nget appointed as a warder in the prison, but that seems full of\ndifficulties, for I know no one who could get me such a berth, and\ncertainly they would not appoint a fellow at my age unless by some\nextraordinary influence. Then I thought if I let out I was English\nI might get arrested and lodged in the same prison, and might\nhelp her to get out then. From what I hear, the prisoners are not\nseparated, but all live together.\"\n\n\"No, no, Harry,\" Jeanne exclaimed in a tone of sharp pain, \"you\nmust not do that of all things. We have only you, and if you are\nonce in prison you might never get out again; besides, there are\nlots of other prisons, and there is no reason why they should send\nyou to La Force rather than anywhere else. No, I will never consent\nto that plan.\"\n\n\"I thought it seemed too doubtful myself,\" Harry said. \"Of course,\nif I knew that they would send me to La Force, I might risk it.  I\ncould hide a file and a steel saw about me, and might cut through\nthe bars; but, as you say, there is no  reason why they should send\nme there rather than anywhere else. I would kill that villain who\narrested her--the scoundrel, after being a guest at the chateau!--but\nI don't see that would do your sister any good, and would\nprobably end in my being shut up. The most hopeful plan seems to\nme to try and bribe some of the warders. Some of them, no doubt,\nwould be glad enough to take money if they could see their way to\nletting her out without fear of detection.\"\n\n\"But you know we thought of that before, Harry, and agreed it would\nbe a terrible risk to try it, for the very first man you spoke to\nmight turn round on you.\"\n\n\"Of course there is a certain risk, Jeanne, anyway. There is no\ngetting a prisoner out of La Force without running some sort of\nrisk; the thing is to fix on as safe a plan as we can. However, we\nmust think it out well before we do try. A failure would be fatal,\nand I do not think there is any pressing danger just at present.\nIt is hardly likely there will be any repetition of the wholesale\nwork of the 2nd of September; and if they have anything like a trial\nof the prisoners, there are such numbers of them, so many arrested\nevery day, that it may be a long time before they come to your\nsister. I do not mean that we should trust to that, only that\nthere is time for us to make our plans properly. Have you thought\nof anything?\"\n\n\"I have thought of all sort of things since you left us this morning,\nHarry, but they are like yours, just vague sort of schemes that\ndo not seem possible when you try to work them out. I do not know\nwhether they let you inside the prisons to sell everything to the\nprisoners, because if they did I might go in with something and\nsee Marie, and find out how she could be got out.\"\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\"I do not think anyone would be allowed in like that, but if they\ndid it would only be a few to whom the privilege would be granted.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought of that, Harry; but one of them might be bribed\nperhaps to let me take her place.\"\n\n\"It might be possible,\" Harry said, \"but there would be a terrible\nrisk, and I don't think any advantage to compensate for it. Even if\nyou did get to her and spoke to her, we should still be no nearer\nto getting her out. Still we mustn't be disheartened. We can hardly\nexpect to hit upon a scheme at once, and I  don't think either of\nour heads is very clear to-day; let us think it over quietly, and\nperhaps some other idea may occur to one of us, I expect it will be\nto you.  Now, good-night; keep your courage up. I rely very much\nupon you, Jeanne, and you don't know what a comfort it is to me that\nyou are calm and brave, and that I can talk things over to you. I\ndon't know what I should do if I had it all on my own shoulders.\"\n\nJeanne made no answer, but her eyes were full of tears as she put\nher hands into Harry's, and no sound came from her lips in answer\nto his good-night.\n\n\"That girl's a trump, and no mistake,\" Harry said to himself as\nhe descended the stairs. \"She has got more pluck than most women,\nand is as cool and calm as if she were twice her age. Most girls\nwould be quite knocked over if they were in her place. Her father\nand mother murdered, her sister in the hands of these wretches,\nand danger hanging over herself and Virginie! It isn't that she\ndoesn't feel it. I can see she does, quite as much, if not more,\nthan people who would sit down and howl and wring their hands. She\nis a trump, Jeanne is, and no mistake. And now about Marie. She\nmust be got out somehow, but how? That is the question. I really\ndon't see any possible way except by bribing her guards, and\nI haven't the least idea how to set about that. I think to-morrow\nI will tell Jacques and his wife all about it; they may know some\nof these men, though it isn't likely that they do; anyhow, three\nheads are better than one.\"\n\nAccordingly, next morning he took the kind-hearted couple into his\ncounsel. When they heard that the young lady who had been arrested\nwas the fiance of their sick lodger they were greatly interested,\nbut they shook their heads when he told them that he was determined\nat all hazards to get her out of prison.\n\n\"It isn't the risk so much,\" Jacques said, \"that I look at. Life\ndoesn't seem of much account in these days; but how could it be\ndone? Even if you made up your mind to be killed, I don't see that\nwould put her a bit nearer to getting out of prison; the place is\ntoo strong to break into or to break out of.\"\n\n\"No, I don't think it is possible to succeed in that sort of way;\nbut if the men who have the keys of the corridors could be bribed,\nand the guard at the gate put soundly to sleep by drugging their\ndrink, it might be managed.\"\n\nJacques looked sharply at Harry to see if he was in earnest, and\nseeing that he was so, said drily:\n\n\"Yes, if we could do those things we should, no doubt, see our way;\nbut how could it be managed?\"\n\n\"That is just the point, Jacques. In the first place it will be\nnecessary to find out in which corridor Mademoiselle de St. Caux\nis confined; in the second, to let her know that we are working\nfor her, and to learn, if possible, from her whether, among those\nin charge of her, there is one man who shows some sort of feeling\nof pity and kindness; when that is done we should, of course, try\nto get hold of him. Of course he doesn't remain in the prison all\nday. However, we can see about that after we have found out the\nfirst points.\"\n\n\"I know a woman who is sister to one of the warders,\" Elise Medart\nsaid. \"I don't know whether he is there now or whether he has been\nturned out. Martha is a good soul, and I know that sometimes she\nhas been inside the prison, I suppose to see her brother, for before\nthe troubles the warders used to get out only once a month.  What\nher brother is like I don't know, but if he is like her he would,\nI think, be just the man to help you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jacques assented, \"I didn't think of Martha. She is a good\nsoul and would do her best, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Thank you both,\" Harry said; \"but I do not wish you to run any\nrisks. You have already incurred the greatest danger by sheltering\nmy friend; I cannot let you hazard your lives farther. This woman\nmay, as you say, be ready to help us, but her brother might betray\nthe whole of us, and screen his sister by saying she had only\npretended to enter into the plot in order to betray it.\"\n\n\"We all risk our lives every day,\" Jacques said quietly. \"I am\nsure we can trust Martha, and she will know whether she can rely\ncompletely upon her brother. If she can, we will set her to sound\nhim. Elise will go and see her to-day, and you shall know what she\nthinks of it when you come this evening for your night's watching.\"\n\nGreatly pleased with this unexpected stroke of luck, Harry went off\nat once to tell Jeanne that the outline of a plan to rescue Marie\nhad been fixed upon.\n\nThe girl's pale face brightened up at the news.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said, \"we may be able to send a letter to her. I\nshould like to send her just a line to say that Virginie and I are\nwell.  Do you think it can be done?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Jeanne. At any rate you can rely that, if it is\npossible and all goes well, she shall have it; but be sure and give\nno clue by which they might find you out, if the letter falls into\nwrong hands. Tell her we are working to get her free, and ask if\nshe can suggest any way of escape; knowing the place she may see\nopportunities of which we know nothing. Write it very small, only\non a tiny piece of paper, so that a man can hide it anywhere, slip\nit into her hand, or put it in her ration of bread.\"\n\nJeanne wrote the little note--a few loving words, and the message\nHarry had given her.\n\n\"Do not sign your name to it,\" Harry said; \"she will know well\nenough who it comes from, and it is better in case it should fall\ninto anyone else's hands.\"\n\nThat evening Harry learned that the woman had consented to sound\nher brother, who was still employed in the prison. She had said she\nwas sure that he would not betray her even if he refused to aid in\nthe plan.\n\n\"I am to see her to-morrow morning,\" Elise said. \"She will go\nstraight from me to the prison. She says discipline is not nearly\nso strict as it used to be. There is a very close watch kept over\nthe prisoners, but friends of the guards can go in and out without\ntrouble, except that on leaving they have to be accompanied by\nthe guard at the door, so as to be sure that no one is passing out\nin disguise. She says her brother is good-natured but very fond\nof money. He is always talking of retiring and settling down in a\nfarm in Brittany, where he comes from, and she thinks that if he\nthought he could gain enough to do this he would be ready to run\nsome risk, for he hates the terrible things that are being done\nnow.\"\n\n\"He seems just the man for us,\" Harry said. \"Will you tell your\nfriend, when you see her in the morning, that I will give her twenty\nlouis and her brother a hundred if he can succeed in getting Marie\nout?\"\n\n\"I will tell them, sir. That offer will set his wits to work, I\nhave no doubt.\"\n\nHarry then gave her the note Jeanne had written, for the woman\nto hand to her brother for delivery if he proved willing to enter\ninto their plan. Harry had a quiet night of watching, for Victor\nlay so still that his friend several times leant over him to see\nif he breathed. The doctor had looked in late and said that the\ncrisis was at hand.\n\n\"To-morrow your friend will either sink or he will turn the corner.\nHe is asleep now and will probably sleep for many hours. He may\nnever wake again; he may wake, recognize you for a few minutes,\nand then go off in a last stupor; he may wake stronger and with a\nchance of life. Here is a draught that you will give him as soon\nas he opens his eyes; pour besides three or four spoonfuls of soup\ndown his throat, and if he keeps awake do the same every half hour.\"\n\nIt was not until ten o'clock in the morning that Victor opened his\neyes. He looked vaguely round the room and there was no recognition\nin his eyes as they fell upon Harry's face, but they had lost the\nwild expression they had worn while he had lain there, and Harry\nfelt renewed hope as he lifted his head and poured the draught\nbetween his lips. Then he gave him a few spoonfuls of soup and had\nthe satisfaction of seeing his eyes close again and his breathing\nbecome more and more regular.\n\nThe doctor, when he came in and felt Victor's pulse, nodded approval.\n\n\"The fever has quite left him,\" he said; \"I think he will do now.\nIt will be slow, very slow, but I think he will regain his strength;\nas to his mind, of that I can say nothing at present.\"\n\nAbout mid-day Elise returned.\n\n\"I have good news, monsieur,\" she said at once. \"I waited outside\nthe prison till Martha came out. Her brother has agreed to help if\nhe can, but he said that he did not think that it would be at all\npossible to get mademoiselle out. There are many of the men of the\nfaubourgs mixed up with the old warders, and there is the greatest\nvigilance to ensure that none escape. There would be many doors to\nbe opened, and the keys are all held by different persons. He says\nhe will think it over, and if it is any way possible he will risk\nit. But he wishes first of all to declare that he does not think\nthat any way of getting her out can be discovered. He will give\nher the note on the first opportunity, and get an answer from her,\nwhich he will send to his sister as soon as he gets a chance.\"\n\n\"That is all we can expect,\" Harry said joyfully. \"I did not expect\nthat it would be an easy business, or that the man would be able\nto hit upon a scheme at once; but now that he has gone so far as\nto agree to carry notes, the thought that he may, if he succeeds,\nsoon have his little farm in Brittany, will sharpen his wits up\nwonderfully.\"\n\nIt was three days before an answer came from Marie. Jacques handed\nit to Harry when he came to take his turn by Victor's bedside.\nVictor was better; he was no longer unconscious, but followed with\nhis eyes the movements of those in the room. Once he had said, \"Where\nam I?\" but the answer \"You are with friends; you have been ill;\nyou shall hear all about it when you get stronger,\" had apparently\nsatisfied him. At Harry he looked with doubtful recognition. He\nseemed to remember the face, but to have no further idea about it,\nand even when Harry said cheerfully:\n\n\"Don't you remember your friend Harry, Victor?\" he had shaken his\nhead in feeble negative.\n\n\"I expect it will all come back to him,\" Jacques said, \"as he gets\nstronger; and after all it is much better that he should remember\nnothing at present. It will be quite time enough for that when he\nis better able to stand it.\"\n\n\"I agree with you there,\" Harry said, \"and I am really glad that he\ndid not remember me, for had he done so the past might have come\nback at once and, feeble as he is, that would have completely\nknocked him over.\"\n\nUpon the receipt of Marie's note Harry at once started off at full\nspeed and soon had the satisfaction of handing it to Jeanne.\n\nShe tore it open.\n\n\"Do you not know what it is, Harry?\"\n\n\"How could I?\" Harry replied. \"As you see the letter is addressed\nto you. Of course I should not think of looking at it.\"\n\n\"Why not? You are as much interested in it as I am. Sit down between\nme and Virginie and let us read it together. Why, it is quite a\nlong epistle.\"\n\nIt was written in pencil upon what was evidently a fly-leaf of a\nbook, and ran as follows:\n\n\"My darling Jeanne and Virginie, you can imagine what joy I felt\nwhen I received your little note to-day and heard that you were\nstill safe. I could hardly believe my senses when, on opening the\nlittle ball of paper which one of our guards  thrust into my hand, I\nfound that it was from you, and that you were both safe and well.\nI am writing this crouched down on the ground behind Madame de\nVigny, and so hidden from the sight of our guards, but I can only\nwrite a few lines at a time, lest I should be detected. Tell our\ngood friend that I fear there is little chance of escape. We are\nwatched night and day. We are locked up at night, three or four\ntogether, in little cells, but in the day we are in a common hall.\n\n\"It is a strange mixture. Here are many of the best blood in France,\ntogether with deputies, advocates, and writers. We may talk together\nas much as we like, and sometimes even a joke and a laugh are heard.\nEvery day some names are called out, and these go and we never see\nthem again. Do not fret about me, my dear sisters, we are all in\nGod's hands. If it is his will, we shall be saved; if not, we must\nface bravely whatever comes.\n\n\"It is a day since I wrote last. A strange thing has happened which\nwill make your blood boil, Jeanne, as it has made mine. I was called\nout this morning to a little room where questions are sometimes\nasked us, and who do you think was there? M. Lebat, the son of the\nMaire of Dijon--the man who denounced and arrested me. What do\nyou think the wretch had the insolence to say? That he loved me,\nand that if I would consent to marry him he could save me. He said\nthat his influence would suffice, not only to get me free, but to\nobtain for me some of our estates, and he told me he would give me\ntime to consider his offer, but that I must remember that nothing\ncould save me if I refused. What do you think I did, Jeanne?\nSomething very unladylike, I am afraid. I made a step closer to\nhim, and then I gave him a slap on the face which made my fingers\ntingle, then I made him a deep curtsy and said, 'That is my answer,\nMonsieur Lebat,' and walked into the great hall again.\n\n\"But do not let me waste a line of this last precious letter that\nI may be able to write to you by saying more about this wretch. I\ncan see no possible way of escape, dears, so do not buoy yourselves\nup with hope. I have none. Strange as it may seem to you we are\nnot very unhappy here. There are many of our old friends and some\nof the deputies of the Gironde, who used to attend our salon. We\nkeep up each other's courage. We talk of  other things just as if\nwe were in a drawing-room, and when the list is called out of a\nmorning, those who are named say good-bye bravely; there is seldom\na tear shed.\n\n\"So do not think of me as wretched or unhappy in these last days.\nAnd now, my sisters, I must say adieu. You must trust yourselves\nentirely to our brave English friend, as you would trust a brother.\nHe will do all that is possible to take you out of this unhappy land\nand conduct you to England, where you will find Victor, Monsieur\ndu Tillet, and your brothers, who have, I trust, weeks ago arrived\nthere in safety. Thank our friend from me and from our dead parents\nfor his goodness and devotion. That your lives may be happy, my\ndear sisters, will be the last prayer of your loving Marie.\"\n\nInside the letter was another tiny note addressed for Jeanne,\n\"Private.\" Having read the other Jeanne took the little note and\nwalking to the window opened it. As she did so a burning flush\nof colour swept across her face to her very brow. She folded it\ncarefully again and stood looking through the window silently for\nanother quarter of an hour before she came back to the table.\n\n\"What is it, Jeanne?\" Virginie asked; \"have you been crying, Jeanne\ndear? You look so flushed. You must not fret. Harry says we must\nnot give up hope, for that he believes he may hit upon some plan\nfor saving Marie yet. He says it's only natural that she should\nthink there was no means of getting away, but it was only what he\nexpected. It is we who must invent something.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, we will try,\" Jeanne said with a quiver in her lip,\nand then she suddenly burst into tears.\n\n\"You mustn't give way, Jeanne,\" Harry said, when she recovered\nherself a little. \"You know how much I trust to your advice; if\nyou were to break down I should lose heart. Do not think of Marie's\nletter as a good-bye. I have not lost hope yet, by a long way. Why,\nwe have done wonders already in managing to get a letter in to her\nand to have her reply. I consider half the difficulty is over now\nwe have a friend in there.\"\n\n\"I will try not to break down again,\" Jeanne said; \"it is not often\nI give way, but to-day I do not feel quite myself, and this letter\nfinished me. You will see I shall be all right to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Harry said as he rose to leave; \"but I think you had\nbetter ask Louise to give you something--your hands are hot and\nyour cheeks are quite flushed, and you look to me as if you were\nfeverish. Good night, dears!\"\n\n\"I do hope Jeanne is not going to break down,\" Harry said as he\nwalked towards his lodging. \"If she were to get laid up now that\nwould be the finishing touch to the whole affair; but perhaps, as\nshe says, she will be all right in the morning. No doubt in that\nnote Marie wrote as if she were sure of dying, and such a letter\nas that would be enough to upset any girl, even such a plucky one\nas Jeanne.\n\n\"However, it is of Marie I must think now. It was a brave letter of\nhers; it is clear she has given up all hope. This is a bad business\nabout the scoundrel Lebat. I used to wonder why he came so often\nto the chateau on business that could have been done just as well\nby a messenger. He saw how things were going, and thought that when\nthe division of the estates came he might get a big slice. However,\nit's most unfortunate that he should have had this interview with\nMarie in the prison. If it had not been for that it might have been\nmonths before her turn came for trial. As it is, no doubt Lebat will\nhave her name put down at once in the list of those for trial, if\nsuch a farce can be called a trial, and will see that no time is\nlost before it appears on that fatal list for execution.\n\n\"He will flatter himself, of course, that when the last moment\ncomes, and she sees that there is no hope whatever, she will change\nher mind. There is one thing, if she is murdered I will kill him\nas I would a dog, for he will be her murderer just as much as if\nhe had himself cut her throat. I would do it at once if it were not\nfor the girls. I must not run any unnecessary risks, at any rate\nI need not think of him now; the one thing at present is to get\nMarie out.\"\n\nTurning this over in his mind, he walked about for some hours,\nscarce noticing where he was going. It seemed to him that there\nmust be some way of getting Marie out if he could only hit upon\nit.  He turned over in his mind every escape he had ever read of,\nbut in most of these the prisoner had been a man, capable of using\ntools passed in to him to saw through iron bars, pierce walls, or\novercome jailers; some had been saved by female relatives, wives\nor daughters, who went in and exchanged clothes and places with\nthem, but this was not feasible here. This was not a prison where\nrelatives could call upon friends, for to be a relative or  friend\nof a prisoner was quite sufficient in the eyes of the terrorists\nto mark anyone as being an enemy of the republic.\n\nHe was suddenly roused from his reverie by a cry, and beneath the\ndim light of a lantern, suspended over the narrow street, he saw a\nman feebly defending himself against two others. He sprang forward\njust as the man fell, and with his stick struck a sharp blow on\nthe uplifted wrist of one of the assailants, sending the knife he\nwas holding flying through the air. The other turned upon him, but\nhe drew the pistol which he always carried beneath his clothes, and\nthe two men at once took to their heels. Harry replaced his pistol\nand stooped over the fallen man.\n\n\"Are you badly hurt?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I think not, but I do not know. I think I slipped down; but\nthey would have killed me had you not arrived.\"\n\n\"Well, let me get you to your feet,\" Harry said, holding out\nhis hands, but with a feeling of some disgust at the abject fear\nexpressed in the tones of the man's voice. He was indeed trembling\nso that even when Harry hauled him to his feet he could scarcely\nstand.\n\n\"You had better lean against the wall for a minute or two to\nrecover yourself,\" Harry said. \"I see you have your coat cut on the\nshoulder, and are bleeding pretty freely, but it is nothing to be\nfrightened about. If you will give me your handkerchief I will bind\nit up for you.\"\n\nHarry unbuttoned the man's coat, for his hands shook so much that\nhe was unable to do so, pulled the arm out of the sleeve, and tied\nthe bandage tightly round the shoulder. The man seemed to belong\nto the bourgeois class, and evidently was careful as to his attire,\nwhich was neat and precise. His linen and the ruffles of his shirt\nwere spotlessly white and of fine material. The short-waisted coat\nwas of olive-green cloth, with bright metal buttons; the waistcoat,\nextending far below the coat, was a light-buff colour, brocaded\nwith a small pattern of flowers. When he had bound the wound Harry\nhelped him on with his coat again. He was by this time recovering\nhimself.\n\n\"Oh these aristocrats,\" he murmured, \"how they hate me!\"\n\nThe words startled Harry. What was this? He had not interfered, as\nhe had supposed, to prevent the robbery of some quiet citizen by\nthe ruffians of the streets. It was a political assassination that\nhad been attempted--a vengeance  by Royalists upon one of the men\nof the Revolution. He looked more closely at the person whose life\nhe had saved. He had a thin and insignificant figure--his face was\npale and looked like that of a student. It seemed to Harry that he\nhad seen it before, but where he could not say. His first thought\nwas one of regret that he had interfered to save one of the men\nof the 2d of September; then the thought flashed through his mind\nthat there might be some benefit to be derived from it.\n\n\"Young man,\" the stranger said, \"will you give me your arm and\nescort me home?  You have saved my life; it is a humble one, but\nperhaps it is of some value to France. I live but two streets away.\nIt is not often I am out alone, for I have many enemies, but I was\ncalled suddenly out on business, though I have no doubt now the\nmessage was a fraudulent one, designed simply to put me into the\nhands of my foes.\"\n\nThe man spoke in a thin hard voice, which inspired Harry, he knew\nnot why, with a feeling of repulsion; he had certainly heard it\nbefore. He offered him his arm and walked with him to his door.\n\n\"Come up, I beg you,\" the stranger said.\n\nHe ascended to the second floor and rang at the bell. A woman with\na light opened it.\n\n\"Why, my brother,\" she exclaimed on seeing his face, \"you are ill!\nHas anything happened?\"\n\n\"I have been attacked in the street,\" he said, \"but I am not hurt,\nthough, had it not been for this citizen it would have gone hardly\nwith me. You have to thank him for saving your brother's life.\"\n\nThey had entered a sitting-room now. It was plainly but very neatly\nfurnished. There were some birds in cages, which, late though the\nhour was, hopped on their perches and twittered when they heard\nthe master's voice, and he responded with two or three words of\ngreeting to them.\n\n\"Set the supper,\" he said to his sister; \"the citizen will take a\nmeal with us. You know who I am, I suppose?\" he said to Harry.\n\n\"No,\" Harry replied. \"I have a recollection of your face and voice,\nbut I cannot recall where I have met you.\"\n\n\"I am Robespierre,\" he said.\n\nHarry gave a start of surprise. This man whom he had saved was he\nwhom he had so often execrated--one of the leaders of those who\nhad deluged France with blood--the man who, next only to Marat\nwas hated and feared by the Royalists of France. His first feeling\nwas one of loathing and hatred, but at the same moment there flashed\nthrough his mind the thought that chance had favoured him beyond\nhis hopes, and that the comedy which he had planned with Victor\nto carry out upon the person  of Marat had come to pass without\npremeditation, but with Robespierre as the chief actor.\n\nBut so surprised and so delighted was he that for a minute he sat\nunable to say a word. Robespierre was gratified at the effect which\nhis name had produced. His was a strangely-mixed character--at\nonce timid and bold, shrinking from personal danger, yet ready to\nurge the extremest measures. Simple in his tastes, and yet very vain\nand greedy of applause. Domestic and affectionate in his private\ncharacter, but ready to shed a river of blood in his public capacity.\nPure in morals; passionless in his resolves; incorruptible and\ninflexible; the more dangerous because he had neither passion nor\nhate; because he had not, like Danton and Marat, a lust for blood,\nbut because human life to him was as nothing, because had he\nconsidered it necessary that half France should die for the benefit\nof the other half he would have signed their death-warrant without\nemotion or hesitation.\n\n\"You are surprised, young man,\" he said, \"but the ways of fate are\ninscrutable. The interposition of a youth has thwarted the schemes\nof the enemies of France. Had you been but ten seconds later I should\nhave ceased to be, and one of the humble instruments by which fate\nis working for the regeneration of the people would have perished.\"\n\nWhile Robespierre was speaking Harry had rapidly thought over the\nrole which it would be best for him to adopt. Should he avow his\nreal character and ask for an order for the liberation of Marie as\na recompense for the service he had rendered Robespierre, or should\nhe retain his present character and obtain Robespierre's confidence?\nThere was danger in an open appeal, for, above all things, Robespierre\nprided himself upon his incorruptibility, and he might consider\nthat to free a prisoner for service rendered  to himself would be\na breach of his duty to France. He resolved, therefore, to keep\nsilence at present, reserving an appeal to Robespierre's gratitude\nfor the last extremity.\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" he said, after he had rapidly arrived at\nthis conclusion; \"my emotion was naturally great at finding that\nI had unwittingly been the means of saving the life of one on whom\nthe eyes of France are fixed. I rejoice indeed that I should have\nbeen the means of preserving such a life.\"\n\nThis statement was strictly true, although not perhaps in the sense\nin which Robespierre regarded it.\n\n\"We will talk more after supper,\" he said. \"My sister is, I see,\nready with it. Indeed it is long past our usual hour, and we were\njust sitting down when I was called out by what purported to be an\nimportant message from the Club.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nFree\n\n\nRobespierre chatted continuously as the meal went on, and Harry\nasked himself in astonishment whether he was in a dream, and if\nthis man before him, talking about his birds, his flowers, and his\nlife before he came to Paris, could really be the dreaded Robespierre.\nAfter the meal was over his host said:\n\n\"As yet I am ignorant of the name of my preserver.\"\n\n\"My name is Henry Sandwith,\" Harry replied.\n\n\"It is not a French name,\" Robespierre said in surprise.\n\n\"I am of English parentage,\" Harry said quietly, \"but have been\nresident for some years in France. I was for some time in the service\nof the ci-devant Marquis de St. Caux; but since the break-up of his\nhousehold I have been shifting for myself as best I could, living\nchiefly on the moneys I had earned in his service, and on the\nlook-out for any employment that may offer.\"\n\n\"England is our enemy,\" Robespierre said, raising his voice angrily;\n\"the enemy of free institutions and liberty.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about English politics,\" Harry replied with a smile;\n\"nor indeed about any politics. I am but little past eighteen, and\nso that I can earn my living I do not ask whether my employer is a\npatriot or an aristocrat. It is quite trouble enough to earn one's\nliving without bothering one's head about politics. If you can put\nme in the way of doing so I shall consider that I am well repaid\nfor the little service I rendered you.\"\n\n\"Assuredly I will do so,\" Robespierre said. \"I am a poor man, you\nknow. I do not put my hand into the public purse, and I and my\nsister live as frugally as we did when we first came to Paris from\nArras.  My only gains have been the hatred of the aristocrats and\nthe love of the people. But though I have not money, I have influence,\nand I promise to use it on your behalf. Until I  hear of something\nsuitable you can, if you will, work here with me, and share what\nI possess.  My correspondence is very heavy. I am overwhelmed with\nletters from the provinces begging me to inquire into grievances\nand redress wrongs. Can you read and write well?\" For from Harry's\nwords he supposed that he had held some menial post in the household\nof the Marquis de St. Caux.\n\n\"Yes, I can read and write fairly,\" Harry said.\n\n\"And are you acquainted with the English tongue?\"\n\n\"I know enough of it to read it,\" Harry said. \"I spoke it when I\nwas a child.\"\n\n\"If you can read it that will do,\" Robespierre said. \"There are\nEnglish papers sent over, and I should like to hear for myself\nwhat this perfidious people say of us, and there are few here who\ncan translate the language. Do you accept my proposal?\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" Harry said.\n\n\"Very well, then, come here at nine o'clock in the morning.  But\nmind you are only filling the post of my secretary until I can find\nsomething better for you to do.\"\n\n\"The post will be a better one some day, Monsieur Robespierre.\nEre long you will be the greatest man in France, and the post of\nsecretary will be one which may well be envied.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see you know how to flatter,\" Robespierre said with a smile,\nmuch gratified nevertheless with Harry's words. \"You must remember\nthat I crave no dignities, that I care only for the welfare of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"I know, monsieur, that you are called 'Robespierre the Incorruptible,\"'\nHarry said; \"but, nevertheless, you belong to France, and France\nwill assuredly see that some day you have such a reward as you\nrichly merit.\"\n\n\"There was no untruth in that,\" Harry said to himself as he made\nhis way down stairs. \"These human tigers will meet their doom when\nFrance comes to her senses. He is a strange contrast, this man;\nbut I suppose that even the tiger is a domestic animal in his own\nfamily. His food almost choked me, and had I not known that Marie's\nfate depends upon my calmness, I should assuredly have broken out\nand told this dapper little demagogue my opinion of him. But this\nis glorious! What news I shall have to give the girls in the morning!\nIf I cannot ensure Marie's freedom now I  should be a bungler\nindeed.  Had I had the planning of the events of this evening they\ncould not have turned out better for us.\"\n\nIt was the first time that Harry had called at Louise Moulin's as\nearly as eight o'clock in the morning, and Jeanne leaped up as he\nentered.\n\n\n\"What is it, Harry? You bring us some news, don't you?\"\n\n\"I do indeed, Jeanne; capital news. Whom do you think I had supper\nwith last night?\"\n\n\"Had supper with, Harry!\" Jeanne repeated. \"What do you mean? How\ncan I guess whom you had supper with?\"\n\n\"I am sure you cannot guess, Jeanne, so I will not puzzle your\nbrain. I had supper with Robespierre.\"\n\n\"With Robespierre!\" the two girls repeated in astonishment.  \"You\nare not joking, Harry?\" Jeanne went on. \"But no, you cannot be\ndoing that; tell us how you came to have supper with Robespierre.\"\n\n\"My dear Jeanne, I regard it as a special providence, as an answer\nfrom God to your prayers for Marie. I had the good fortune to save\nhis life.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry,\" Jeanne exclaimed, \"what happiness! Then Marie's life\nwill be saved.\"\n\n\"I think I can almost promise you that, Jeanne, though I do not know\nyet exactly how it's to be done. But such a piece of good fortune\nwould never have been sent to me had it not been intended that we\nshould save Marie. Now, sit down quietly, both of you, and you too,\nLouise, and let me tell you all about it, for I have to be with\nRobespierre again at nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is fortunate indeed!\" Jeanne exclaimed when he had\nfinished. \"Surely he cannot refuse any request you may make now.\"\n\n\"If he does, I must get it out of him somehow,\" Harry said cheerfully.\n\"By fair means or foul I will get the order for her release.\"\n\n\"But you don't think he can refuse, Harry?\" Jeanne asked anxiously.\n\n\"I think he may refuse, Jeanne. He is proud of his integrity and\nincorruptibility, and I think it quite possible that he may refuse\nto grant Marie's release in return for a benefit done him personally.\nHowever, do not let that discourage you in the least. As I said,\nI will have the order by fair means or foul.\"\n\nAt nine o'clock Harry presented himself in readiness for work, and\nfound that his post would be no sinecure. The correspondence which\nhe had to go through was enormous. Requests for favours, letters\nof congratulation on Robespierre's speeches and motions in the\nAssembly, reports of scores of provincial committees, denunciations\nof aristocrats, letters of blame because the work of rooting out\nthe suspects did not proceed faster, entreaties from friends of\nprisoners. All these had to be sorted, read, and answered.\n\nRobespierre was, Harry soon found, methodical in the extreme.  He\nread every letter himself, and not only gave directions how they\nwere to be answered, but read through the answers when written,\nand was most careful before he affixed his signature to any paper\nwhatever. When it was time for him to leave for the Assembly he\nmade a note in pencil on each letter how it should be answered,\nand directed Harry when he had finished them to leave them on the\ntable for him on his return.\n\n\"I foresee that you will be of great value to me, Monsieur Sandwith,\"\nhe said, \"and I shall be able to recommend you for any office that\nmay be vacant with a feeling of confidence that you will do justice\nto my recommendation; or if you would rather, as time goes on,\nattach your fortunes to mine, be assured that if I should rise to\npower your fortune will be made. When you have done these letters\nyour time will be your own for the rest of the day. You know our\nmeal hours, and I can only say that we are punctual to a second.\"\n\nWhen Harry had finished he strolled out. He saw that the task of\ngetting an order for Marie's release would be more difficult than\nhe had anticipated. He had hoped that by placing it with a batch of\npapers before Robespierre he would get him to sign it among others\nwithout reading it, but he now saw that this would be next to\nimpossible. One thing afforded him grounds for satisfaction. Among\nthe papers was a list of the prisoners to be brought up on the\nfollowing day for trial. To this Robespierre added two names, and\nthen signed it and sent it back to the prison. There was another\nlist with the names of the prisoners to be executed on the following\nday, and this, Harry learned, was not sent in to the prison authorities\nuntil late in the evening, so that even they were ignorant until\nthe last moment which of the prisoners were to be called for by\nthe tumbrils next morning. Thus he would know when Marie was to go\nthrough the mockery of a trial, and would also know  when her name\nwas put on the fatal list for the guillotine. The first fact he\nmight have been able to learn from his ally in the prison, but the\nsecond and most important he could not have obtained in any other\nway.\n\nThe work had been frequently interrupted by callers. Members of the\nCommittee of Public Safety, leaders of the Jacobin and Cordeliers\nClubs, and others, dropped in and asked Robespierre's advice,\nor discussed measures to be taken; and after a day or two Harry\nfound that it was very seldom, except when taking his meals, that\nRobespierre was alone while in the house; and as his sister was in\nand out of the room all day, the idea of compelling him by force to\nsign the order, as they had originally intended to do with Marat,\nwas clearly impracticable.\n\nEach day after his work was over, and this was generally completed\nby about one o'clock, Harry called to see how Victor was getting\non. He was gaining strength, but his brain appeared to make far\nless progress than his bodily health. He did not recognize Harry in\nthe least, and although he would answer questions that were asked\nhim, his mind appeared a blank as to the past, and he often lay for\nhours without speaking a word. After leaving him Harry met Louise\nand the two girls at a spot agreed upon the day before, a fresh\nmeeting-place being arranged each day. He  found it difficult to\nsatisfy them, for indeed each day he became more and more doubtful\nas to his ability to get the order of release from Robespierre.\nTowards the man himself his feelings were of a mixed kind. He\nshuddered at the calmness with which, in his letters to the provincial\ncommittees, he advocated wholesale executions of prisoners. He\nwondered at the violence with which, in his shrill, high-pitched\nvoice, he declaimed in favour of the most revolutionary measures.\nHe admired the simplicity of his life, his affection for his sister\nand his birds, his kindness of heart in all matters in which politics\nwere not concerned.\n\nAmong Robespierre's visitors during the next three weeks was Lebat,\nwho was, Harry found, an important personage, being the representative\non the Committee of Public Safety of the province of Burgundy, and\none of the most extreme of the frequenters of the Jacobin Club. He\ndid not recognize Harry, whom he had never noticed particularly on\nthe occasion of his visits to the chateau, and who, in the somewhat\nthreadbare black  suit which he had assumed instead of the workman's\nblouse, wrote steadily at a table apart, taking apparently no notice\nof what was going on in the apartment.\n\nBut Harry's time was not altogether thrown away. It was his duty\nthe first thing of a morning to open and sort the letters and lay\nthem in piles upon the table used by Robespierre himself, and he\nmanaged every day to slip quietly into his pockets several of the\nletters of denunciation against persons as aristocrats in disguise\nor as being suspected of hostility to the Commune. When Robespierre\nleft him to go to the Club or the Assembly Harry would write short\nnotes of warning in a disguised hand to the persons named, and\nwould, when he went out, leave these at their doors. Thus he had\nthe satisfaction of saving a considerable number of persons from\nthe clutches of the revolutionists. He would then, two or three\ndays later, slip the letters of denunciation, very few of which\nwere dated, among the rest of the correspondence, satisfied that\nwhen search was made the persons named would already have shifted\ntheir quarters and assumed some other disguise.\n\nFebruary had come and Harry was still working and waiting, busy\nfor several hours each day writing and examining reports with\nRobespierre, striving of an evening to keep up the courage and\nspirits of the girls, calling in for a few minutes each day to see\nVictor, who, after passing through a long and terrible fever, now\nlay weak and apparently unconscious alike of the past and present,\nhis mind completely gone; but the doctor told Harry that in this\nrespect he did not think the case was hopeless.\n\n\"His strength seems to have absolutely deserted him,\" he said,\n\"and his mind is a blank like that of a little child, but I by no\nmeans despair of his gradually recovering; and if he could hear the\nvoice of the lady you tell me he is engaged to, it might strike a\nchord now lying dormant and set the brain at work again.\"\n\nBut as to Marie, Harry could do nothing. Do what he would, he\ncould hit upon no plan whatever for getting her out of prison; and\nhe could only wait until some change in the situation or the appearance\nof her name in the fatal list might afford some opportunity for\naction.  It was evident to him that Lebat was not pushing matters\nforward, but that he preferred to wait and leave  the horror of\nmonths in prison to work upon Marie's mind, and so break her down\nthat she would be willing enough to purchase her life by a marriage\nwith him.\n\nThere had been some little lull in the work of blood, for in\nDecember all eyes had been turned to the spectacle of the trial of\nthe king.  From the 10th of August he had remained a close prisoner\nin the Temple, watched and insulted by his ruffian guards, and\npassing the time in the midst of his family with a serenity of mind,\na calmness, and tranquility which went far to redeem the blunders\nhe had made during the preceding three years. The following is the\naccount written by the princess royal in her journal of the manner\nin which the family passed their days:  \"My father rose at seven\nand said prayers till eight; then dressing himself he was with my\nbrother till nine, when he came to breakfast with my mother. After\nbreakfast my father gave us lessons till eleven o'clock; and then\nmy brother played till midday, when we went to walk together,\nwhatever the weather was, because at that hour they relieved guard\nand wished to see us to be sure of our presence. Our walk was\ncontinued till two o'clock, when we dined. After dinner my father\nand mother played at backgammon, or rather pretended to play, in\norder to have an opportunity of talking together for a short time.\n\n\"At four o'clock my mother went up stairs with us, because the king\nthen usually took a nap. At six o'clock my brother went down, and\nmy father gave us lessons till supper at nine. After supper my\nmother soon went to bed. We then went up stairs, and the king went\nto bed at eleven. My mother worked much at tapestry and made me\nstudy, and frequently read alone. My aunt said prayers and read\nthe service; she also read many religious books, usually aloud.\"\n\nBut harmless as was the life of the royal family, Danton and the\nJacobins were determined upon having their lives. The mockery of\nthe trial commenced on the 10th of December. Malesherbes, Tronchet,\nand Deseze defended him fearlessly and eloquently, but it was\nuseless--the king was condemned beforehand. Robespierre and Marat\nled the assault. The Girondists, themselves menaced and alarmed,\nstood neutral; but on the 15th of January  the question was put to\nthe Assembly, \"Is Louis Capet, formerly King of the French, guilty\nof conspiracy and attempt against the general safety of the state?\"\n\nWith scarcely a single exception, the Assembly returned an affirmative\nanswer, and on the 17th the final vote was taken. Three hundred\nand sixty-one voted for death, two for imprisonment, two hundred\nand eighty-six for detention, banishment, or conditional death,\nforty-six for death but after a delay, twenty-six for death but\nwith a wish that the Assembly should revise the sentence.\n\nSentence of death was pronounced. After a sitting which lasted for\nthirty-seven hours there was another struggle between the advocates\nof delay and those of instant execution, but the latter won; and\nafter parting with noble resignation from his wife and family, the\nking, on the 21st, was executed. His bearing excited the admiration\neven of his bitterest foes.\n\nFrance looked on amazed and appalled at the act, for Louis had\nundoubtedly striven his best to lessen abuses and to go with the\npeople in the path of reform. It was his objection to shed blood,\nhis readiness to give way, his affection for the people, which had\nallowed the Revolution to march on its bloody way without a check.\nIt was the victims--the nobles, the priests, the delicate women and\ncultured men--who had reason to complain; for it was the king's\nhatred to resistance which left them at the mercy of their foes.\nLouis had been the best friend of the Revolution that slew him.\n\nThe trial and execution of the king had at least the good effect of\ndiverting the minds of Jeanne and Virginie from their own anxieties.\nJeanne was passionate and Virginie tearful in their sorrow and\nindignation. Over and over again Jeanne implored Harry to try to\nsave the king. There were still many Royalists, and indeed the bulk\nof the people were shocked and alienated by the violence of the\nConvention; and Jeanne urged that Harry might, from his connection\nwith Robespierre, obtain some pass or document which would enable\nthe king to escape. But Harry refused to make any attempt whatever\non his behalf.\n\n\"In the first place, Jeanne, it would be absolutely impossible for\nthe king, watched as he is, to escape; and no pass or permit that\nRobespierre could give would be of the smallest utility. You must\nremember, that although all apparently unite against the king, there\nis a never-ending struggle going on in  the Convention between the\nvarious parties and the various leaders. Robespierre is but one\nof them, although, perhaps, the most prominent; but could I wring\na pass from him even if only to see the king, that pass would not\nbe respected.\n\n\"In the next place, Jeanne, I have nothing to do with these struggles\nin France. I am staying here to do what little I can to watch over\nyou and Virginie, for the sake of your dear parents and because I\nlove you both; and I have also, if possible, to rescue Marie from\nthe hands of these murderers. The responsibility is heavy enough;\nand could I, by merely using Robespierre's name, rescue the king\nand queen and their children and pass them across the frontier, I\nwould not do it if the act in the slightest degree interfered with\nmy freedom of action towards you and Marie.\"\n\n\"But Virginie and I would die for the king!\" Jeanne said passionately.\n\n\"Happily, Jeanne,\" Harry replied coolly, \"your dying would in no\nrespect benefit him; and as your life is in my eyes of a thousand\ntimes more consequence than that of the king, and as your chances\nof safety to some extent depend upon mine, I do not mean to risk\none of those chances for the sake of his majesty. Besides, to tell\nyou the truth, I have a good deal of liking for my own life, and\nhave a marked objection to losing my head. You see I have people\nat home who are fond of me, and who want to see me back again with\nthat head on my shoulders.\"\n\n\"I know, Harry; I know,\" Jeanne said with her eyes full of tears.\n\"Do not think that I am ungrateful because I talk so. I am always\nthinking how wrong it is that you should be staying here risking\nyour life for us instead of going home to those who love you. I\nthink sometimes Virginie and I ought to give ourselves up, and then\nyou could go home.\" And Jeanne burst into tears.\n\n\"My dear Jeanne,\" Harry said soothingly, \"do not worry yourself\nabout me. It would have been just as dangerous at the time your\nfather was taken prisoner for me to have tried to escape from\nthe country as it was to stay here--in fact I should say that it\nwas a good deal more dangerous; and at present, as Robespierre's\nsecretary, I am in no danger at all. It is a little disagreeable\ncertainly serving a man whom one regards in some respects as  being\na sort of wild beast; but at the same time, in his own house, I\nam bound to say, he is a very decent kind of man and not at all a\nbad fellow to get on with.\n\n\"As to what I have done for you, so far as I see I have done nothing\nbeyond bringing you here in the first place, and coming to have a\npleasant chat with you every evening. Nor, with the best will in\nthe world, have I been able to be of the slightest assistance to\nMarie. As we say at home, my intentions are good; but so far the\nintentions have borne no useful fruit whatever. Come, Jeanne, dry\nyour eyes, for it is not often that I have seen you cry. We have\nthrown in our lot together, and we shall swim or sink in company.\n\n\"You keep up my spirits and I keep up yours. Don't let there be any\ntalk about gratitude. There will be time enough for that if I ever\nget you safely to England. Then, perhaps, I may send in my bill\nand ask for payment.\"\n\nHarry spoke lightly, and Jeanne with a great effort recovered her\ncomposure; and after that, although the trial and danger of the\nking were nightly discussed and lamented, she never said a word as\nto any possibility of the catastrophe being averted.\n\nOne day towards the end of February Harry felt a thrill run through\nhim as, on glancing over the list of persons to be tried on the\nfollowing day, he saw the name of Marie, daughter of the ci-devant\nMarquis de St. Caux. Although his knowledge of Robespierre's character\ngave him little ground for hope, he determined upon making a direct\nappeal.\n\n\"I see, citizen,\" he said--for such was the mode of address universal\nat that time--\"that among the list of persons to be tried is the\nname of Marie de St. Caux.\"\n\n\"Say Marie Caux,\" Robespierre said reprovingly. \"You know de and St.\nare both forbidden prefixes. Yes; what would you say about her?\"\n\n\"I told you, citizen, upon the first night when I came here, that\nI had been in the service of the father of this female citizen.\nAlthough I know now that he was one of those who lived upon the\nblood of the people, I am bound to say that he always treated his\ndependants kindly.  His daughter also showed me many marks of kindness,\nand this I would now fain return. Citizen, I did you some service\non the night when we first met; and I ask you now, as a full\nquittance for that aid, that you will grant me the freedom of  this\nyoung woman. Whatever were the crimes of her father, she cannot have\nshared in them. She is young, and cannot do harm to any;  therefore\nI implore you to give me her life.\"\n\n\"I am surprised at your request,\" Robespierre said calmly. \"This\nwoman belongs to a race who have for centuries oppressed France,\nand it is better that they should perish altogether. If she can\nconvince the tribunal that she is innocent of all crime, undoubtedly\nshe will be spared; but I cannot, only on account of the obligation\nI am under to you, interfere on her behalf; such an act would be\ntreason to the people, and I hope you know me well enough by this\ntime to be aware that nothing whatever would induce me to allow my\nprivate inclinations to interfere with the course of justice. Ask\nof me all I have, it is little enough, but it is yours; but this\nthing I cannot grant you.\"\n\nFor a moment Harry was on the point of bursting out indignantly,\nbut he checked himself and without a word went on with his writing,\nalthough tears of disappointment for a time almost blinded him; but\nhe felt it would be hopeless to urge the point further, and that\ndid he do so he might forfeit the opportunity he now had of learning\nwhat was going on.\n\nAnother month passed before the name appeared on the fatal list. In\nthe meantime Harry had corresponded regularly with Marie by means\nof the warder, and had even once seen her and exchanged a few\nwords with her, having been sent by Robespierre with a letter to\nthe governor of the prison.\n\nMarie was greatly changed: her colour had faded away, the former\nsomewhat haughty air and carriage had disappeared, and there was\nan expression of patient resignation on her face. Harry had only\nthe opportunity to whisper to her \"Hope always, all is not lost\nyet.\" He had spent hours each day in his lodging imitating the\nsignature of Robespierre, and he had made up his mind that, should\nall other efforts fail, he would boldly present himself at the prison\nwith an order for Marie's release, with Robespierre's signature\nforged at the bottom.\n\nHe thought he could write it now plainly enough for it to pass; his\nfear was that the prison authorities would not act upon it, unless\npresented by a well-known official personage, without sending to\nRobespierre to have it verified.\n\nStill but little change had taken place in Victor de Gisons' condition.\nHe remained in a state almost of lethargy, with an expression of\ndull hopelessness on his face; sometimes he passed his hand wearily\nacross his forehead as if he were trying to recollect something he\nhad lost; he was still too weak to stand, but Jacques and his wife\nwould dress him and place him on a couch which Harry purchased for\nhis use. The worthy couple ran no risk now, for the sharpest spy\nwould fail to recognize in the bowed-down invalid with vacant face,\nthe once brilliant Victor de Gisons.\n\nHarry had many talks with Jeanne concerning him. \"What should we\ndo, Harry,\" the girl said over and over again, \"if we could get\nMarie away and all get safe together to England, which I begin to\ndespair now of our ever doing, but if we should do it what should\nwe say to Marie? She thinks Victor is safe there. Only the other\nday, as you know, she sent us out a letter to him. What would she\nsay when she learned on her arrival in England that Victor has all\nthis time been lying broken down and in suffering in Paris?\"\n\nTo this question Harry, for a long time, could give no answer.  At\nlast he said, \"I have been thinking it over, Jeanne, and I feel\nthat we have no right to take Marie away without her knowing the\ntruth about Victor. His misfortunes have come upon him because he\nwould stop in Paris to watch over her. I feel now that she has the\nright, if she chooses, of stopping in Paris to look after him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry, you would never think of our going away and leaving\nher!\"\n\n\"I don't know, Jeanne, if it would not be best. She could stay\nin the disguise of a peasant girl with Jacques and his wife; they\nwould give out that she was Victor's sister who had come to nurse\nhim. I have great hopes that her voice and presence would do what\nwe have to do, namely, awaken him from his  sad state of lethargy.\nThey could stay there for months until these evil days are over.\nJacques' workmen friends are accustomed now to Victor being with\nhim, and there is no chance of any suspicion arising that he is\nnot what he seems to be, a workman whom Jacques picked up injured\nand insensible on that terrible night. It would seem natural that\nhis sister or his fiance--Marie could pass for whichever she\nchose--should come and help take care of him.\"\n\n\"Then if she can stop in Paris with Victor, of course we can stop\nwith Louise?\"\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" Harry said. \"Every day the search for suspects\nbecomes stricter; every day people are being seized and called upon\nto produce the papers proving their identity; and I fear, Jeanne,\nthere is no hope of permanent safety for you save in flight.\"\n\nIt was just a month from the mock trial, at which Marie had been\nfound guilty and sentenced to death, that Harry received a double\nshock. Among the letters of denunciation was the following: \"Citizen,\nI know that you watch over the state. I would have you know that\nfor more than seven months two girls have been dwelling with one\nLouise Moulin of 15 Rue Michel; there were three of them, but the\neldest has disappeared. This, in itself, is mysterious; the old\nwoman herself was a servant in the family of the ci-devant Marquis\nde St.  Caux. She gives out that the girls are relatives of hers,\nbut it is believed in the neighbourhood that they are aristocrats\nin disguise. They receive many visits from a young man of whom no\none knows anything.\"\n\nHarry felt the colour leave his cheeks, and his hand shook as\nhe hastily abstracted the note, and he could scarcely master the\nmeaning of the next few letters he opened.\n\nThis was a sudden blow for which he was unprepared. He could not\neven think what was best to be done. However, saying to himself\nthat he had at any rate a few days before him, he resolutely put the\nmatter aside, to be thought over when he was alone, and proceeded\nwith his work. After a time he came to the list of those marked\nout for execution on the following day, and saw with a fresh pang\nthe name of Marie de St. Caux.\n\nSo the crisis had arrived. That night or never Marie must be rescued,\nand his plan of forging Robespierre's signature must be put into\neffect that day. He opened the next few papers mechanically, but\nsteadied himself upon Robespierre asking him a question. For a time\nhe worked on; but his brain was swimming, and he was on the point\nof saying that he felt strangely unwell, and must ask to be excused\nhis work for that day, when he heard a ring at the bell, and a\nmoment later Lebat entered the room.\n\n\"I have just come from the tribunal, citizen,\" he said, \"and have\nseen the list for to-morrow. I have come to you, as I know you are\njust, and abhor the shedding of innocent blood. There is among the\nnumber a young girl, who is wholly innocent. I know her well, for\nshe comes from my province, and her father's chateau was within a\nfew miles of Dijon. Although her father was a furious aristocrat,\nher heart was always with the people. She was good to the poor, and\nwas beloved by all the tenants on the estate. It is not just that\nshe should die for the sins of her parents. Moreover, henceforth,\nif pardoned, she will be no longer an aristocrat. I respond for\nher; for she has promised to marry me, the delegate of Burgundy\nto the Commune.  The young woman is the daughter of the man called\nthe Marquis de St. Caux, who met his deserved fate on the 2d of\nSeptember.\"\n\n\"You are willing to respond for her, citizen?\" Robespierre said.\n\n\"I am. The fact that she will be my wife is surely a guarantee?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Robespierre said. \"What you tell me convinces me that I\ncan without damage to the cause of the people grant your request.\nI am the more glad to do so since my secretary has also prayed\nfor her life. But though he rendered me the greatest service, and\nI owe to him a debt of gratitude, I was obliged to refuse; for\nto grant his request would have been to allow private feeling to\ninterfere with the justice of the people; but now it is different.\nYou tell me that, except by birth, she is no aristocrat; that she\nhas long been a friend of the people, and that she is going to be\nyour wife; on these grounds I can with a good conscience grant her\nrelease.\"\n\nLebat had looked with astonishment at Harry as Robespierre spoke.\n\n\"Thank you, citizen,\" he said to Robespierre. \"It is an act of justice\nwhich I relied upon from your well-known character. I promise you\nthat your clemency will not be misplaced, and that she will become a\nworthy citizen. May I ask,\" he said, \"how it is that your secretary,\nwhose face seems familiar to me, is interested in this young woman\nalso?\"\n\n\"It is simple enough,\" Robespierre replied. \"He was in the service\nof her father.\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember now,\" Lebat said. \"He is English. I wonder, citizen,\nthat you should give your confidence to one of that treacherous\nnation.\"\n\n\"He saved my life,\" Robespierre replied coldly; \"a somewhat good\nground, you will admit, for placing confidence in him.\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" Lebat said hastily, seeing that Robespierre was offended.\n\"And now, citizen, there is another matter of importance on which\nI wish to confer with you.\"\n\nHarry rose.\n\n\"Citizen, I will ask you to excuse me from further work to-day.\nMy head aches badly, and I can scarce see what I am writing.\"\n\n\"I thought you were making some confusion of my papers,\" Robespierre\nsaid kindly. \"By all means put aside your work.\"\n\nOn leaving the room Harry ran up to the attic above, which he had\noccupied since he had entered Robespierre's service, rapidly put on\nthe blue blouse and pantaloons which he had formerly worn, pulled\nhis cap well down over his eyes, and hurried down stairs. He\nstationed himself some distance along the street and waited for\nLebat to come out. Rapidly thinking the matter over, he concluded\nthat the man would not present himself with the order of release until\nafter dark, in order that if Marie struggled or tried to make her\nescape it would be unnoticed in the street. Lebat had calculated,\nof course, that on the presentation of the order the prison officials\nwould at once lead Marie to the gates whether she wished it or not,\nand would, at his order, force her into a vehicle, when she would\nbe completely in his power, and he could confine her in his own\nhouse or elsewhere until she consented to be his wife.\n\nA quarter of an hour later Lebat came out of the house and walked\ndown the street. Harry followed him. After walking for some distance\nLebat came to a stand of hackney-coaches and spoke to one of the\ndrivers. When he had gone on again Harry went up to the man.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said, \"do you wish to do a good action and earn a\ncouple of gold pieces at the same time?\"\n\n\"That will suit me admirably,\" the coachman replied.\n\n\"Let one of your comrades look after your horse, then, and let us\nhave a glass of wine together in that cabaret.\"\n\nAs soon as they were seated at a small table with a measure of wine\nbefore them Harry said:\n\n\"That deputy with the red sash who spoke to you just now has engaged\nyou for a job this evening?\"\n\n\"He has,\" the coachman said. \"I am to be at the left corner of the\nPlace de Carrousel at eight this evening.\"\n\n\"He is a bad lot,\" Harry said; \"he is going to carry off a poor\ngirl to whom he has been promising marriage; but of course we know\nbetter than that. She is a friend of mine, and so were her parents,\nand I want to save her. Now what I want to do is to take your place\non the box this evening. I will drive him to the place where he\nis to meet her, and when he gets her to the door of his lodging I\nshall jump off and give my citizen such a thrashing as will put a\nstop to his gallivanting for some time. I will give you ten crowns\nfor the use of your coach for an hour.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" the coachman said. \"Between ourselves, some of these\nfellows who pretend to be friends of the people are just as great\nscoundrels, ay, and worse, than the aristocrats were. We drivers\nknow a good many things that people in general don't; but you must\nmind, citizen, he carries a sword, you know, and the beating may\nturn out the other way.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can get a comrade or two to help,\" Harry said laughing.\n\"There are others besides myself who will not see our pretty Isabel\nwronged.\"\n\n\"And where shall I get my coach again?\"\n\n\"At the end of the Rue St. Augustin. I expect I shall be there by\nnine o'clock with it; but I am sure not to be many minutes later.\nHere is a louis now. I will give you the other when I change places\nwith you. Be at the Place de Carrousel at half-past seven. I shall\nbe on the look-out for you.\n\n\"I won't fail,\" the coachman said; \"you may rely upon that.\"\n\nHarry now hurried away to his friend Jacques, and rapidly gave an\naccount of what had taken place.\n\n\"In the first place, Jacques, I want your wife to see her friend\nand to get her to take a note instantly to the warder, for him\nto give to Mademoiselle de St. Caux. It is to tell her to make\nno resistance when Lebat presents the order for her release, but\nto go with him quietly; because if she appeals to the warders and\ndeclares that she would rather die than go with him, it is just\npossible that they might refuse to let him take her away, saying\nthat the order was for her release, but not for her delivery to him.\nI don't suppose they would do so, because as one of the members of\nthe Committee of Public Safety he is all-powerful; still it would\nbe  as well to avoid any risk whatever of our scheme failing. I\nwill drive to the Rue Montagnard, which, as you know, is close to\nLa Force. It is a quiet street, and it is not likely there will be\nanybody about at half-past eight. Will you be there and give me a\nhand to secure the fellow?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" Jacques said heartily. \"What do you propose to\ndo with him?\"\n\n\"I propose to tie his hands and feet and gag him, and then drive\nto the Rue Bluert, which is close by, and where there are some\nunfinished houses. We can toss him in there, and he will be safe\ntill morning.\n\n\"It will be the safest plan to run him through at once and have\ndone with him,\" Jacques said. \"He will be a dangerous enemy if he\nis left alive; and as he would kill you without mercy if he had a\nchance, I don't see why you need be overnice with him.\"\n\n\"The man is a scoundrel, and one of a band of men whom I regard as\nmurderers,\" Harry said; \"but I could not kill him in cold blood.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" Jacques said earnestly, \"and you are risking\neverything by letting him live. Such a fellow should be killed like\na rat when you get him in a trap.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" Harry agreed; \"but I could not bring myself to do\nit.\"\n\nJacques was silent, but not convinced. It seemed to him an act of\nthe extremest folly to leave so dangerous an enemy alive.\n\n\"He would hunt us all down,\" he said to himself, \"Elise and I,\nthis poor lad and the girl, to say nothing of the Englishman and\nthe girl's sisters. Well, we shall see. I am risking my head in\nthis business, and I mean to have my say.\"\n\nHaving made all his arrangements, Harry returned to his attic and\nlay down there until evening, having before he went in purchased a\nsword. At seven o'clock he placed his pistols in his bosom, girded\non his sword, which would attract no attention, for half the\nrabble of Paris carried weapons, and then set out for the Place de\nCarrousel.  At half-past seven his friend the coachman drew up.\n\n\"Ah, here you are!\" he said. \"You had better take this big cape of\nmine; you will find it precious cold on the box; besides he would\nnotice at once that you are not the coachman he hired if you are\ndressed in that blouse.\"\n\nHarry took off his sword and placed it on the seat, wrapped himself\nin the great cape, wound a muffler round the lower part of his\nface, and waited. A few minutes after the clock had struck eight\nLebat came along.\n\n\"Here we are, citizen,\" Harry said in a rough voice, \"I am glad you\nhave come, for it's no joke waiting about on such nights as this.\nWhere am I to drive you to?\"\n\n\"The prison of La Force,\" Lebat said, taking his seat in the coach.\n\nHarry's heart beat fast as he drove towards the prison. He felt\nsure that success would attend his plans; but the moment was an\nexciting one. It did not seem that anything could interpose to prevent\nsuccess, and yet something might happen which he had not foreseen\nor guarded against. He drove at a little more than a footpace,\nfor the streets a short distance from the centre of town were only\nlighted here and there by a dim oil lamp, and further away they\nwere in absolute darkness, save for the lights which gleamed through\nthe casements. At last he reached the entrance to the prison. Lebat\njumped out and rang at the bell.\n\n\"What is it, citizen?\" the guard said looking through a grille in\nthe gate.\n\n\"I am Citizen Lebat of the Committee of Public Safety, and I have\nan order here, signed by Citizen Robespierre, for the release of\nthe female prisoner known as Marie Caux.\"\n\n\"All right, citizen!\" the man said, opening the gate. \"It is late\nfor a discharge; but I don't suppose the prisoner will grumble at\nthat.\"\n\nTen minutes later the gate opened again and Lebat came out with\na cloaked female figure. She hesitated on the top step, and then\nrefusing to touch the hand Lebat held out to assist her, stepped\ndown and entered the coach.\n\n\"Rue Fosseuse No. 18,\" Lebat said as he followed her.\n\nHarry drove on, and was soon in the Rue Montagnard. It was a dark\nnarrow street; no one seemed stirring, and Harry peered anxiously\nthrough the darkness for the figure of Jacques. Presently he heard\na low whistle, and a figure appeared from a doorway. Harry at once\nchecked the horse.\n\n\"What is it?\" Lebat asked, putting his head out of the window.\n\nHarry got off the box, and going to the window said in a drunken\nvoice:\n\n\"I want my fare. There is a cabaret only just ahead, and I want a\nglass before I go further. My feet are pretty well frozen.\"\n\n\"Drive on, you drunken rascal,\" Lebat said furiously, \"or it will\nbe worse for you.\"\n\n\"Don't you speak in that way to me, citizen,\" Harry said hoarsely.\n\"One man's as good as another in these days, and if you talk like\nthat to me I will break your head in spite of your red sash.\"\n\nWith an exclamation of rage Lebat sprang from the coach, and as his\nfoot touched the ground Harry threw his arms round him; but as he\ndid so he trod upon some of the filth which so thickly littered\nthe thoroughfare, and slipped. Lebat wrenched himself free and drew\nhis sword, and before Harry could have regained his feet he would\nhave cut him down, when he fell himself in a heap from a tremendous\nblow which Jacques struck him with his sword.\n\n\"Jump inside,\" Jacques said to Harry. \"We may have some one out to\nsee what the noise is about. He will be no more trouble.\"\n\nHe seized the prostrate body, threw it up on the box, and taking\nhis seat drove on.\n\n\"Marie,\" Harry said as he jumped in, \"thank God you are safe!\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry, is it you? Can it be true?\" And the spirit which had\nso long sustained the girl gave way, and leaning her head upon his\nshoulder she burst into tears. Harry soothed and pacified her till\nthe vehicle again came to a stop.\n\n\"What is it, Jacques?\" Harry asked, putting his head out of the\nwindow.\n\n\"Just what we agreed upon,\" the man said. \"Here are the empty\nhouses. You stop where you are. I will get rid of this trash.\"\n\nHarry, however, got out.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" he asked in a low voice.\n\n\"Well, considering his head's cut pretty nigh in two, I should think\nhe was,\" Jacques said. \"It could not be helped, you know; for if\nI hadn't struck sharp it would have been all over with you. Anyhow\nit's better as it is a hundred times. If you don't value your neck,\nI do mine. Now get in again. I sha'n't be two minutes.\"\n\nHe slipped off the red sash and coat and waistcoat of the dead\nman, emptied his trouser pockets and turned them inside out, then\nlifting the body on his shoulder he carried it to one of the empty\nhouses and threw it down.\n\n\"They will never know who he is,\" he said to himself \"In this\nneighbourhood the first comer will take his shirt and trousers. They\nwill suppose he has been killed and robbed, no uncommon matter in\nthese days, and his body will be thrown into the public pit, and\nno one be any the wiser. I will burn the coat and waistcoat as soon\nas I get back.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMarie and Victor\n\n\n\"Are you taking me to the girls, Harry?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harry said. \"It would not be safe to do so. There are already\nsuspicions, and they have been denounced.\"\n\nMarie gave a cry of alarm.\n\n\"I have managed to suppress the document, Marie, and we start with\nthem in a day or two. Still it will be better for you not to go\nnear them.  I will arrange for you to meet them to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Where am I going, then?\"\n\n\"You are going to the house of a worthy couple, who have shown\nthemselves faithful and trustworthy by nursing a friend of mine,\nwho has for nearly six months been lying ill there. You will be\nperfectly safe there till we can arrange matters.\"\n\n\"But if Robespierre has signed my release, as they said, I am safe\nenough, surely, and can go where I like.\"\n\n\"I think you will be safe from re-arrest here in Paris, Marie, because\nyou could appeal to him; but outside Paris it might be different.\nHowever, we can talk about that to-morrow, when you have had a good\nnight's rest.\"\n\nHarry did not think it necessary to say, that when Lebat was missed\nit would probably be ascertained that he was last seen leaving La\nForce with her, and that if inquiries were set on foot about him\nshe might be sought for. However, Marie said no more on the subject,\nquite content that Harry should make whatever arrangements he\nthought best, and she now began to ask all sorts of questions about\nher sisters, and so passed the time until they were close to the\nPlace de Carrousel; then Harry called Jacques to stop.\n\n\"Will you please get out, Marie, and wait with our good friend here\ntill I return. I shall be back in five minutes. I have to hand the\ncoach over to its owner.\"\n\nJacques threw Lebat's clothes over his arm and got down from the\nbox. Harry took his seat and drove into the Place, where he found\nthe coachman awaiting him.\n\n\"Have you managed the job?\"\n\n\"That we have,\" Harry said. \"He has a lesson, and Isabel has gone\noff to her friends again. Poor little girl, I hope it will cure her\nof her flightiness. Here is your cape and your money, my friend,\nand thank you.\"\n\n\"You are heartily welcome,\" the driver said, mounting his box.  \"I\nwish I could do as well every day; but these are bad times for us,\nand money is precious scarce, I can tell you.\"\n\nHarry soon rejoined Jacques and Marie. There were but few words said\nas they made their way through the streets, for Marie was weakened\nby her long imprisonment, and shaken by what she had gone through.\nShe had not asked a single question as to what had become of Lebat;\nbut she had no doubt that he was killed. She had grown, however,\nalmost indifferent to death. Day after day she had seen batches\nof her friends taken out to execution, and the retribution which\nhad fallen upon this wretch gave her scarcely a thought, except a\nfeeling of thankfulness that she was freed from his persecutions.\nCompletely as she trusted Harry, it was with the greatest difficulty\nthat she had brought herself to obey his instructions and to place\nherself for a moment in the power of her persecutor, and appear to\ngo with him willingly.\n\nWhen Lebat told her triumphantly that he had saved her from death,\nand that she was to have formed one of the party in the tumbril\non the following morning had he not obtained her release, she had\ndifficulty in keeping back the indignant words, that she would have\npreferred death a thousand times. When he said that he had come to\ntake her away, she had looked round with a terrified face, as if\nto claim the protection of the guards; but he had said roughly:\n\n\"It is no use your objecting, you have got to go with me; and\nif you are a wise woman you had better make the best of it. After\nall I am not very terrible, and you had better marry me than the\nguillotine.\"\n\nSo, trembling with loathing and disgust, she had followed him,\nresolved that if Harry's plan to rescue her failed she would kill\nherself rather than be the wife of this man.\n\nWhen they reached the house Elise opened the door.\n\n\"So you have come, poor lamb!\" she said. \"Thanks to the good God\nthat all has turned out well. You will be safe here, my child. We\nare rough people, but we will take care of you as if you were our\nown.\"\n\nSo saying she led the girl to the little sitting-room which they\nhad prepared for her, for they had that afternoon taken the other\ntwo rooms on the floor they occupied, which were fortunately to\nlet, and had fitted them up as a bed-room and sitting-room for her.\nThere was already a communication existing between the two sets\nof apartments, and they had only to remove some brickwork between\nthe double doors to throw them into one suite. Telling Marie to\nsit down, Elise hurried off and returned with a basin of bouillon.\n\n\"Drink this, my dear, and then go straight to bed; your friend will\nbe here in good time in the morning, and then you can talk over\nmatters with him.\" She waited to see Marie drink the broth, and\nthen helped her to undress.\n\n\"She will be asleep in five minutes,\" she said when she rejoined\nher husband and Harry. \"She is worn out with excitement, but a\nnight's rest will do wonders for her. Don't come too early in the\nmorning, Monsieur Sandwith; she is sure to sleep late, and I would\nnot disturb her till she wakes of herself.\"\n\n\"I will be here at nine,\" Harry said, \"and will go round before\nthat and tell her sisters. They will be wondering they have seen\nnothing of me to-day, but I was afraid to tell them until it was\nall over. The anxiety would have been too great for them.\"\n\nIt was fortunate that Robespierre went out early on the following\nmorning to attend a meeting at the Jacobins, and Harry was therefore\nsaved the necessity for asking leave to absent himself again. At\neight o'clock he was at Louise Moulin's.\n\n\"What is it, Harry?\" Jeanne exclaimed as he entered. \"I can see\nyou have news. What is it?\"\n\n\"I have news,\" Harry said, \"and good news, but you must not excite\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"Have you found a way for getting Marie out?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have found a way.\"\n\n\"A sure, certain way, Harry?\" Virginie asked. \"Not only a chance?\"\n\n\"A sure, certain way,\" Harry replied. \"You need have no more fear;\nMarie will certainly be freed.\"\n\nThe two girls stood speechless with delight. It never occurred to\nthem to doubt Harry's words when he spoke so confidently.\n\n\"Have you told us all, Harry?\" Jeanne asked a minute later, looking\nearnestly in his face. \"Can it be? Is she really out already?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"thank God, dears, your sister is free.\"\n\nWith a cry of delight Virginie sprang to him, and throwing her\narms round his neck, kissed him in the exuberance of her happiness.\nLouise threw her apron over her head and burst into tears of\nthankfulness, while Jeanne put her hand on his shoulder and said:\n\n\"Oh, Harry, how can we ever thank you enough for all you have done\nfor us?\"\n\nSix months back Jeanne would probably have acted as Virginie did,\nbut those six months had changed her greatly; indeed, ever since\nshe received that note from Marie, which she had never shown even\nto Virginie, there had been a shade of difference in her manner to\nHarry, which he had more than once noticed and wondered at.\n\nIt was some little time before the girls were sufficiently composed\nto listen to Harry's story.\n\n\"But why did you not bring her here, Harry?\" Virginie asked.  \"Why\ndid you take her somewhere else?\"\n\n\"For several reasons, Virginie. I have not told you before, but there\nis no reason why you should not know now, that Victor is still in\nParis.\"\n\nVirginie uttered an exclamation of wonder.\n\n\"He stopped here to look after you all, but he has had a very bad\nillness, and is still terribly weak, and does not even know me.\nMarie will nurse him. I have great hopes that he will know her,\nand that she may be able in time to effect a complete cure. In the\nnext place I think it would be dangerous to bring her here, for we\nmust leave in a very few days.\"\n\n\"What, go without her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid so, Virginie. I have learned, Louise, that\nsome of your neighbours have their suspicions, and that a letter\nof denunciation has already been sent, so it will be absolutely\nnecessary to make a move. I have suppressed the first letter, but\nthe writer will probably not let the matter drop, and may write to\nDanton or Marat next time, so we must go without delay. You cannot\nchange your lodging, for they would certainly trace you; besides,\nat the present time the regulations about lodgers are so strict that\nno one would dare receive you until the committee of the district\nhave examined you and are perfectly satisfied. Therefore, I think\nwe must go alone.  Marie is wanted here, and I think she will be\nfar safer nursing Victor than she would be with us; besides, now\nshe has been freed by Robespierre's orders, I do not think there\nis any fear of her arrest even if her identity were discovered.\nLastly, it would be safer to travel three than four. Three girls\ntravelling with a young fellow like me would be sure to attract\nattention. It will be difficult enough in any case, but it would\ncertainly be worse with her with us.\"\n\n\"But we are to see her, Harry?\" Jeanne said. \"Surely we are not to\ngo away without seeing Marie!\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Jeanne; I am not so cruel as that. This evening,\nafter dark, we will meet in the gardens of the Tuileries. Louise,\nwill you bring them down and be with them near the main entrance?\nI will bring Marie there at six o'clock. And now I must be off; I\nhave to break the news to Marie that Victor is in the same house\nwith her and ill. I did not tell her last night. She will be better\nable to bear it after a good night's sleep.\"\n\nMarie was up and dressed when Harry arrived, and was sitting by\nthe fire in the little kitchen.\n\n\"I have just left your sisters, Marie,\" Harry said, \"and you may\nimagine their delight at the news I gave them. You are to see them\nthis evening in the gardens of the Tuileries.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry, how good you are! How much you have done for us!\"\n\nHarry laughed lightly.\n\n\"Not very much yet; besides, it has been a pleasure as well as a\nduty. The girls have both been so brave, and Jeanne has the head\nof a woman.\"\n\n\"She is nearly a woman now, Harry,\" Marie said gently. \"She is some\nmonths past sixteen, and though you tell me girls of that age in\nEngland are quite children, it is not so here. Why, it is nothing\nuncommon for a girl to marry at sixteen.\"\n\n\"Well, at anyrate,\" Harry said, \"Jeanne has no time for any thought\nof marrying just at present. But there is another thing I want to\ntell you about.  I have first a confession to make. I have deceived\nyou.\"\n\n\"Deceived me!\" Marie said with a smile. \"It can be nothing very\ndreadful, Harry. Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"It is more serious than you think, Marie. Now you know that when\nthe trouble began I felt it quite out of the question for me to\nrun away, and leave you all here in Paris unprotected. Such a thing\nwould have been preposterous.\"\n\n\"You think so, Harry, because you have a good heart; but most people\nwould have thought of themselves, and would not have run all sorts\nof risks for the sake of three girls with no claim upon them.\"\n\n\"Well, Marie, you allow then that a person with a good heart would\nnaturally do as I did.\"\n\n\"Well, supposing I do, Harry, what then?\"\n\n\"You must still further allow that a person with a good heart, and\nupon whom you had a great claim, would all the more have remained\nto protect you.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at, Harry, with your supposition?\" she said,\nher cheek growing a little paler as a suspicion of the truth flashed\nupon her.\n\n\"Well, Marie, you mustn't be agitated, and I hope you will not\nbe angry; but I ask you how, as he has a good heart, and you have\nclaims upon him, could you expect Victor de Gisons to run away like\na coward and leave you here?\"\n\nMarie had risen to her feet and gazed at him with frightened eyes.\n\n\"What, is it about him that you deceived me! Is it true that he\ndid not go away? Has anything happened to him? Oh, Harry, do not\nsay he is dead!\"\n\n\"He is not dead, Marie, but he has been very, very ill. He was with\nme at La Force on that terrible night, and saw his father brought\nout to be murdered. The shock nearly killed him. He has had brain\nfever, and has been at death's door. At  present he is mending, but\nvery, very slowly. He knows no one, not even me, but I trust that\nyour voice and your presence will do wonders for him.\"\n\n\"Where is he, Harry?\" Marie said as she stood with clasped hands,\nand a face from which every vestige of colour had flown. \"Take me\nto him at once.\"\n\n\"He is in the house, Marie; that is why I have brought you here.\nThese good people have nursed and concealed him for five months.\"\n\nMarie made a movement towards the door.\n\n\"Wait, Marie, you cannot go to him till you compose yourself.  It\nis all-important that you should speak to him, when you see him,\nin your natural voice, and you must prepare yourself for a shock.\nHe is at present a mere wreck, so changed that you will hardly know\nhim.\"\n\n\"You are telling me the truth, Harry? You are not hiding from me\nthat he is dying?\"\n\n\"No, dear; I believe, on my honour, that he is out of danger now,\nand that he is progressing. It is his mind more than his body that\nneeds curing. It may be a long and difficult task, Marie, before he\nis himself again; but I believe that with your care and companionship\nhe will get round in time, but it may be months before that.\"\n\n\"Time is nothing,\" Marie said. \"But what about the girls?\"\n\n\"They must still be under my charge, Marie. I shall start with\nthem in a day or two and try to make for the sea-shore, and then\nacross to England. Suspicions have been aroused; they have already\nbeen denounced, and may be arrested at any time. Therefore it is\nabsolutely necessary that they should fly at once; but I thought\nthat you would consider it your first duty to stay with Victor,\nseeing that to him your presence is everything, while you could do\nnothing to assist your sisters, and indeed the fewer of us there\nare the better.\"\n\n\"Certainly it is my duty,\" Marie said firmly.\n\n\"You will be perfectly safe here under the care of Jacques and his\nwife. They have already given out to their neighbours that Victor's\nfiance is coming to help nurse him, and even if by any possibility\na suspicion of your real position arises, you have Robespierre's\npardon as a protection. This state of things  cannot last for\never; a reaction must come; and then if Victor is cured, you will\nbe able to escape together to England.\"\n\n\"Leave me a few minutes by myself, Harry. All this has come so\nsuddenly upon me that I feel bewildered.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Harry said. \"It is best that you should think things\nover a little. No wonder you feel bewildered and shaken with all\nthe trials you have gone through.\"\n\nMarie went to her room and returned in a quarter of an hour.\n\n\"I am ready now,\" she said, and by the calm and tranquil expression\nof her face Harry felt that she could be trusted to see Victor.\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" she went on, \"that everything will come right\nin the end. I have been saved almost by a miracle, and I cannot\nbut feel that my life has been spared in order that I might take\nmy place here. As to the girls, it was a shock at first when you\ntold me that fresh danger threatened them, and that I should not\nbe able to share their perils upon their journey; but I could not\nhave aided them, and God has marked out my place here. No, Harry,\nGod has protected me so far, and will aid me still. Now I am ready\nfor whatever may betide.\"\n\n\"One moment before you enter, Marie. You are prepared, I know,\nto see a great change in Victor, but nevertheless you cannot but\nbe shocked at first. Do not go up to him or attract his attention\ntill you have overcome this and are able to speak to him in your\nnatural voice. I think a great deal depends upon the first impression\nyou make on his brain. Your voice has a good deal changed in the\nlast six months; it would be strange if it had not; but I want you\nto try and speak to him in the bright cheerful tone he was accustomed\nto hear.\"\n\nMarie nodded. \"One moment,\" she said, as she brushed aside the tears\nwhich filled her eyes, drew herself up with a little gesture that\nreminded Harry of old times, and then with a swift step passed\nthrough the door into Victor's room. Whatever she felt at the sight\nof the wasted figure lying listlessly with half-closed eyes on the\ncouch, it only showed itself by a swift expression of pain which\npassed for a moment across her face and then was gone.\n\n\"Victor,\" she said in her clear ringing voice, \"Victor, my well\nbeloved, I am come to you.\" The effect upon Victor was instantaneous.\nHe opened his eyes with a start, half rose from his couch and held\nout his arms towards her.\n\n\"Marie,\" he said in a faint voice, \"you have come at last. I have\nwanted you so much.\"\n\nThen, as Marie advanced to him, and kneeling by his side, clasped\nhim in her arms, Elise and Harry stole quietly from the room.  It\nwas nearly an hour before Marie came out. There was a soft glow of\nhappiness on her face, though her cheeks were pale.\n\n\"Not yet!\" she said, as she swept past them into her own room.\n\nIn a few minutes she reappeared.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" she said, holding out her hands to Harry and Elise,\n\"but I had to thank the good God first. Victor is quite sensible\nnow, but oh, so weak! He remembers nothing of the past, but seems\nto think he is still in Burgundy, and has somehow had an illness.\nThen he spoke of the duke and my dear father and mother as being\nstill alive, and that he hoped they would let me come to him\nnow. I told him that all should be as he wished as soon as he got\nstronger, but that he must not think of anything now, and that\nI would nurse him, and all would be well. He seemed puzzled about\nmy dress\"--for Marie had already put on the simple attire which\nhad been prepared for her--\"but I told him that it was fit for a\nsick-room, and he seemed satisfied. He has just dozed off to sleep,\nand I will go in and sit with him now till he wakes.\"\n\n\"When he does, mademoiselle, I will have some broth and a glass of\ngood burgundy ready for him,\" Elise said.\n\n\"Thank you; but please call me Marie in future. There are no\nmesdemoiselles in France now, and I shall call you Elise instead\nof Madame. And Harry, would you mind telling the girls that I will\nmeet them to-morrow instead of this evening. I long to see them, oh\nso, so much; but I should not like to leave him for a moment now.\nI fear so that his memory might go again if he were to wake and\nmiss me.\"\n\n\"I was going to propose it myself, Marie,\" Harry said. \"It is\nall-important to avoid any agitation now. To-morrow, I hope, it\nwill be safer, and the doctor will give him a sleeping-draught, so\nthat he shall not wake while you are away. But, Marie, remember it\nwill be a farewell visit, for I dare not let them stay  more than\nanother day.  They may be denounced again at any hour, for the man\nwho wrote to Robespierre, if he finds that nothing comes of it,\nmay go to the local committee, and they will not lose an hour, you\nmay be sure.\"\n\n\"I must see them this evening, then,\" Marie said hurriedly. \"The doctor\nwill be here, you say, soon. Victor must have his sleeping-draught\nthis afternoon instead of to-morrow. They must go at once.  I\nshould never forgive myself if, by putting off our parting for\ntwenty-four hours, I caused them to fall into  the hands of these\nwretches; so please hurry on all the arrangements so that they may\nleave the first thing to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"It will be best,\" Harry said, \"if you will do it, Marie. I own\nthat I am in a fever of apprehension. I will go there at once to\ntell them that all must be in readiness by to-night. They will be\nglad indeed to hear that your presence has done such wonders for\nVictor.  They will be able to leave you with a better heart if\nthey feel that your stay here is likely to bring health to him and\nhappiness to both of you.\"\n\n\"A week since,\" Marie said, \"it did not seem to me that I could\never be happy again; but though everything is still very dark, the\nclouds seem lifting.\"\n\nThe girls were greatly rejoiced when they heard the good news that\nVictor had recognized Marie, and that Harry had now hopes that he\nwould do well.\n\n\"And now we must talk about ourselves,\" Harry said. \"We must not\nlose another hour. Now, Louise, you must take part in our council.\nWe have everything to settle, and only a few hours to do it in. I\nshould like, if possible, that we should not come back here this\nevening after you have once left the house. The man who denounced\nyou will expect that something would be done to-day, and when he\nsees that nothing has come of his letter he may go this evening\nto the local committee, and they would send men at once to arrest\nyou. No doubt he only wrote to Robespierre first, thinking he would\nget credit and perhaps a post of some sort for his vigilance in the\ncause. But if Louise thinks that it cannot possibly be managed, I\nwill write a letter at once to him in Robespierre's name, saying\nthat his letter has been noted and your movements will be closely\nwatched, and thanking him for his zeal in the public service.\"\n\n\"No, I think we are ready,\" Jeanne said. \"Of course we have\nbeen talking it over for weeks, and agreed it was better to be in\nreadiness whenever you told us it was time to go. Louise will tell\nyou all about it.\"\n\n\"The disguises are all ready, Monsieur Sandwith; and yesterday\nwhen you said that my dear mademoiselle could not go with them,\nI settled, if you do not see any objection, to go with the dear\nchildren.\"\n\n\"I should be very glad,\" Harry said eagerly, for although he had\nseen no other way out of it, the difficulties and inconveniences\nof a journey alone with Jeanne and Virginie had been continually\non his mind. The idea of taking the old woman with them had never\noccurred to him, but now he hailed it as a most welcome solution\nof the difficulty.\n\n\"That will be a thousand times better in every way, for with you\nwith us it would excite far less remark than three young people\ntravelling alone. But I fear, Louise, that the hardships we may\nhave to undergo will be great.\"\n\n\"It matters little,\" the old woman said. \"I nursed their mother,\nand have for years lived on her bounty; and gladly now will I\ngive what little remains to me of life in the service of her dear\nchildren. I know that everything is turned topsy-turvy in our poor\ncountry at present, but as long as I have life in my body I will\nnot let my dear mistress's children be, for weeks perhaps, wandering\nabout with only a young gentleman to protect them, and Mademoiselle\nJeanne almost a woman too.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is better in every way,\" Harry said. \"I felt that it would\nbe a strange position, but it seemed that it could not be helped;\nhowever, your offer gets us out of the embarrassment. So your\ndisguises are ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" Louise said; \"I have a boy's suit for Mademoiselle\nVirginie. She did not like it at first, but I thought that if\nmademoiselle went with you it would be strange to have three girls\njourneying under the charge of one young man.\"\n\n\"I think it a very good plan, Louise, but you must get out of the\nway of calling me monsieur or else it will slip out before people.\nNow what I propose is, that when we get fairly away we shall buy a\nhorse and cart, for with you with us we can go forward more boldly\nthan if we were alone.\n\n\"You will be grandmother, and we shall be travelling from a farm\nnear Etampes to visit your daughter, who is married to a farmer near\nNantes. That will be a likely story now, and we can always make a\ndetour to avoid towns. It will be dark when you go out this evening,\nso you can take three bundles of clothes with you. The only thing\nis about to-night. The weather is bitterly cold, and it is out of\nthe question that you should stop out all night, and yet we could\nnot ask for a lodging close to Paris.\n\n\"Oh, I see now! The best plan will be for you all to sleep to-night\nat Jacques'. The good people will manage  somehow; then we can\nstart early in the morning. Yes, and in that way it will not be\nnecessary for Marie to go out and leave Victor.\"\n\n\"That will certainly be the best way,\" Louise said. \"I have been\nwondering ever since you said we must start this evening, what\nwould become of us to-night. When we once get fairly away from\nParis it will be easier, for the country people are kind-hearted,\nand I think we shall always be able to get shelter for the night;\nbut just outside Paris it would be different. Then where shall we\nmeet this evening?\"\n\n\"I will be at the end of the street,\" Harry said. \"It is quite\ndark by five, so do you start a quarter of an hour later; hide your\nbundles under your cloaks, for if that fellow is on the look-out he\nmight follow you if he thought you were leaving. Draw your blinds\nup when you leave, Louise, so that the room will look as usual,\nand then it may be some time before anyone suspects that you have\nleft; and if I were you I would mention to some of your neighbours\nthis afternoon that you have had a letter from your friends in\nBurgundy, and are going away soon with your nieces to stay with\nthem for a while. You had better pay your rent for three months\nin advance, and tell your landlord the same thing; saying that you\nmay go suddenly anytime, as a compere who is in Paris, and is also\ngoing back, is going to take charge of you on the journey, and that\nhe may call for you at any time. Thus when he finds that you have\nleft, your absence will be accounted for; not that it makes much\ndifference, for I hope that when you have seen the girls safely to\nEngland you will make your home with them there.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall never come back here,\" the old woman said, \"never,\neven if I could. Paris is hateful to me now, and I have no reason\nfor ever wanting to come back.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Harry said smiling, \"we may as well save the three\nmonths' rent.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I long to be in England,\" Virginie exclaimed, \"and to see\ndear Ernest and Jules again! How anxious they must be about us, not\nhaving heard of us all this long time! How shall we know where to\nfind them?\"\n\n\"You forget, Virginie,\" Jeanne said, \"it was arranged they should\ngo to Harry's father when they got to England, and he will know\nwhere they are living; there is sure to be no mistake about that,\nis there, Harry?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" Harry said. \"You may rely upon it that directly you\nget to my father you will hear where your brothers are. And now I\nwill go and tell Marie that there is no occasion for Victor to take\na sleeping draught.\"\n\nMarie was delighted when she heard that she was going to have her\nsisters with her for the whole evening and night, and Elise busied\nherself with preparations for the accommodation of her guests.\nHarry then went back to his attic, made his clothes into a bundle,\nand took up the bag of money from its hiding-place under a board\nand placed it in his pocket.\n\nHe had, since he had been with Robespierre, gradually changed the\nsilver for gold in order to make it more convenient to carry, and\nit was now of comparatively little weight, although he had drawn\nbut slightly upon it, except for the payment of the bribe promised\nto the warder. His pistols were also hidden under his blouse.\n\nHe went down stairs and waited the return of Robespierre.\n\n\"Citizen,\" he said when he entered, \"circumstances have occurred\nwhich render it necessary for me to travel down to Nantes to escort\na young girl, a boy, and an old woman to that town; they cannot\ntravel alone in such times as these, and they have a claim upon me\nwhich I cannot ignore.\"\n\n\"Surely, friend Sandwith,\" Robespierre said, \"the affairs of France\nare of more importance than private matters like these.\"\n\n\"Assuredly they are, citizen; but I cannot flatter myself that\nthe affairs of France will be in any way injured by my temporary\nabsence.  My duty in this matter is clear to me, and I can only\nregret that my temporary absence may put you to some inconvenience.\nBut I have a double favour to ask you: the one is to spare me for\na time; the second, that you will give me papers  recommending\nme, and those travelling with me, to the authorities of the towns\nthrough which we shall pass. In these times, when the enemies of\nthe state are travelling throughout France seeking to corrupt the\nminds of the people, it is necessary to have papers showing that\none is a good citizen.\"\n\n\"But I have no authority,\" Robespierre said. \"I am neither a minister\nnor a ruler.\"\n\n\"You are not a minister, citizen, but you are assuredly a ruler. It\nis to you men look more than to any other. Danton is too headstrong\nand violent. You alone combine fearlessness in the cause of France\nwith that wisdom and moderation which are, above all things,\nnecessary in guiding the state through its dangers.\"\n\nRobespierre's vanity was so inordinate that he accepted the compliment\nas his due, though he waved his hand with an air of deprecation.\n\n\"Therefore, citizen,\" Harry went on, \"a letter from you would be\nmore powerful than an order from another.\"\n\n\"But these persons who travel with you, citizen--how am I to be\nsure they are not enemies of France?\"\n\n\"France is not to be shaken,\" Harry said, smiling, \"by the efforts\nof an old woman of seventy and a young boy and girl; but I can\nassure you that they are no enemies of France, but simple inoffensive\npeople who have been frightened by the commotion in Paris, and long\nto return to the country life to which they are accustomed. Come,\ncitizen, you refused the first boon which I asked you, and, methinks,\ncannot hesitate at granting one who has deserved well of you this\nslight favour.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" Robespierre said. \"I cannot refuse you, even if\nthe persons who accompany you belong to the class of suspects, of\nwhich, mind, I know nothing, though I may have my suspicions. I\nhave not forgotten, you know, that you asked for the life of the\ndaughter of the ci-devant Marquis de St. Caux; and for aught I know\nthese children may be of the same breed. But I will not ask you.\nDid I know it, not even the obligation I am under to you would you\ninduce me to do what you ask; for although as children they can\ndo no harm, they might do so were they allowed to grow up hating\nFrance. All children of suspects are, as you know, ordered to be\nplaced in the state schools, in order that  they may there learn\nto love the people of France and to grow up worthy citizens. Now,\nhow shall I word it?\" he said, taking up a pen; and Harry dictated:\n\n\"I hereby recommend Citizen Henri Sandwith, age 19, who has been\nacting as my confidential secretary, to all public authorities,\ntogether with Citoyenne Moulin and her two grandchildren, with whom\nhe is travelling.\"\n\nTo this Robespierre signed his name and handed the paper to Harry.\n\n\"How long will you be before you return?\" he asked.\n\n\"I cannot say exactly,\" Harry replied; \"as after I have seen them\nto their destination I may stop with them for a few weeks.\"\n\nRobespierre nodded and held out his hand.\n\n\"I shall be glad to have you with me again, for I have conceived\na strong friendship for you, and think none the worse of you for\nyour showing your gratitude to the family in whom you are interested.\"\n\nHarry then went into the kitchen, where Robespierre's sister was\npreparing the next meal, and said good-bye to her.\n\nShe had taken a fancy to her brother's young secretary, and expressed\na hope that his absence would be but a short one, telling him that\nRobespierre had said only the day before how much work he had saved\nhim, and that he was determined to push his fortunes to the utmost.\n\nHaving thus paved the way for an appeal to Robespierre should he\nfind himself in difficulties on the road, Harry proceeded to Jacques'\nhouse and waited there until it was time to go up to meet Louise\nand the girls.\n\nVictor did not wake until the afternoon. The doctor had called\nas usual, but had not roused him. He had been told what had taken\nplace, and had held out hope to Marie that Victor's improvement\nwould be permanent, and that he would now make steady progress\ntowards recovery.\n\nAt the appointed hour Harry was at his post to meet the party.  They\ncame along within a few minutes of the time named, but instead of\nstopping to greet him they walked straight on, Jeanne saying as\nshe passed him:\n\n\"I think we are followed.\"\n\nHarry at once drew back and allowed them to go fifty yards on before\nhe moved after them. As there were many people about, it was some\nlittle time before he could verify Jeanne's suspicions; then he\nnoticed that a man, walking a short distance ahead of him, followed\neach turning that the others took.\n\nHarry waited until they were in a quiet street, and then quickened\nhis pace until he was close behind the man. Then he drew one of\nhis pistols, and, springing forward, struck him a heavy blow on\nthe head with its butt. He fell forward on his face without a cry;\nand Harry, satisfied that he had stunned him, ran on and overtook\nthe others, and, turning down the first street they came to, was\nassured that they were safe from pursuit.\n\n\"We had noticed a man lounging against the house opposite all the\nafternoon,\" Jeanne said, \"and came to the conclusion that he must\nbe watching us; so we looked out for him when we came out, and\nnoticed that as soon as we went on he began to walk that way too.\nSo I told Louise to walk straight on without stopping when we came\nup to you. I was sure you would manage somehow to get rid of him.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"I fancy he will spend to-morrow in bed instead of lounging about.\nPerhaps it will teach him to mind his own business in future and to\nleave other people alone. I am very glad that he did follow you;\nfor I felt that I owed him one, and was sorry to leave Paris without\npaying my debt. Now I think we are pretty well square.\"\n\nThe meeting between the sisters was indeed a happy one. They fell\non each other's necks, and for some time scarce a word was spoken;\nthen they stood a little apart and had a long look at each other.\n\n\"You are changed, Marie dear,\" Jeanne said; \"you look pale, but\nyou look, too, softer and prettier than you used to.\"\n\n\"All my airs and graces have been rubbed off,\" Marie said with a\nslight smile. \"I have learned so much, Jeanne, and have been where\nnoble blood has been the reverse of a recommendation. You are changed\ntoo--the six months have altered you. Your gouvernante would not\ncall you a wild girl now. You are quite a woman.\n\n\"We have suffered too, Marie,\" Jeanne said as tears came to her eyes\nat the thought of the changes and losses of the last few months.\n\"We have thought of you night and day; but Louise has been very good\nto us, and as for Harry, we owe  everything to him. He has always\nbeen so hopeful and strong, and has cheered us up with promises\nthat he would bring you to us some day.\"\n\nMarie smiled.\n\n\"You are right, Jeanne. I used to laugh a little, you know, at your\nbelief in your hero, and little thought that the time would come\nwhen I should trust him as implicitly as you do. You have a right\nto be proud of him, Jeanne. What thought and devotion and courage\nhe has shown for us! And do you know, he saved Victor too. Jacques\nhas told me all about it--how Victor saw his father brought out\nto be murdered; and how, half-mad, he was springing out to stand\nbeside him, when Harry as quick as thought knocked him down before\nhe could betray himself; and then Jacques, who was standing by saw\nit, helped him carry him here. Oh, my dear, how much we owe him!\n\n\"And now, Virginie,\" she said, turning to the youngest, \"I must\nhave a good look at you, little one--but no, I mustn't call you\nlittle one any longer, for you are already almost as tall as I am.\nMy child, how you have been growing, and you look so well! Louise\nmust have been feeding you up. Ah, Louise, how much we all owe to\nyou too!  And I hear you are going to leave your comfortable home\nand take care of the girls on their journey. It was such a comfort\nto me when Harry told me!\"\n\n\"I could not let them go alone, mademoiselle,\" the old woman said\nsimply; \"it was only my duty. Besides, what should I do in Paris\nwith all my children in England?\"\n\n\"Now, my dears, take your things off,\" Marie said. \"I will just\nrun in and see how Victor is getting on. Harry went straight in to\nhim, and I want to know whether Victor recognized him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nNantes\n\n\nHarry was very pleased to see a look of recognition on Victor's\nface as he came up to the side of his couch.\n\n\"Well, Victor,\" he said cheerfully, \"I am glad to see you looking\nmore yourself again.\"\n\nVictor nodded assent, and his hand feebly returned the pressure of\nHarry's.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" he said after a pause. \"I seem to be in\na dream; but it is true Marie is here, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! She is chatting now with her sisters, Jeanne and Virginie,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"And why am I here?\" Victor asked, looking round the room.  \"Marie\ntells me not to ask questions.\"\n\n\"No. There will be plenty of time for that afterwards, Victor.  It\nis all simple enough. You were out with me, and there was an accident,\nand you got hurt. So I and a workman who was passing carried you\ninto his house, and he and his wife have been taking care of you.\nYou have been very ill, but you are getting on better now.  Marie\nhas come to nurse you, and she won't leave you until you are quite\nwell. Now, I think that's enough for you, and the doctor would be\nvery angry if he knew I had told you so much; because he said you\nwere not to bother yourself about things at all, but just to sleep\nas much as you can, and eat as much as you can, and listen to Marie\ntalking and reading to you, and not trouble your brain in any way,\nbecause it's your brain that has gone wrong, and any thinking will\nbe very bad for it.\"\n\nThis explanation seemed satisfactory to Victor, who soon after\ndozed off to sleep, and Harry joined the party in Marie's sitting-room.\n\n\"Oh, if I could but keep them here with me, Harry, what a comfort\nit would be!\"\n\n\"I know that it would, Marie; but it is too dangerous. You know they\nwere denounced at Louise Moulin's. Already there is risk enough in\nyou and Victor being here. The search for Royalists does not relax,\nindeed it seems to become more and more keen every day.  Victor's\nextreme illness is your best safeguard. The neighbours have heard\nthat Jacques has had a fellow-workman dangerously ill for some long\ntime, and Victor can no longer be looked upon as a stranger to be\nsuspected, while your coming here to help nurse him will seem so\nnatural a step that it will excite no comment. But any fresh addition\nof numbers would be sure to give rise to talk, and you would have\na commissary of the Commune here in no time to make inquiries, and\nto ask for your papers of domicile.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that it would be too dangerous to risk,\" Marie agreed;\n\"but I tremble at the thought of their journey.\"\n\n\"I have every hope that we shall get through safely,\" Harry said.\n\"I have some good news I have not yet told you. I have received a\npaper from Robespierre stating that I have been his secretary, and\nrecommending us all to the authorities, so that we can dispense\nwith the ordinary papers which they would otherwise ask for.\"\n\n\"That is good news, indeed, Harry,\" Marie said. \"That relieves me\nof half my anxiety. Once on the sea-coast it will be comparatively\neasy to get a passage to England. My dear Harry, you surprise me\nmore every day, and I am ashamed to think that when our dear father\nand mother first told me that they had accepted your noble offer\nto look after us, I was inclined in my heart to think that such\nprotection would be of little use. You see I confess, Harry; and\nyou know that is half-way to forgiveness.\"\n\n\"There is nothing either to confess or forgive,\" Harry said with\na smile. \"It was perfectly natural for you to think that a lad\nof eighteen was a slender reed to lean on in the time of trouble\nand danger, and that it was only by a lucky accident--for saving\nRobespierre's life was but an accident--that I have been enabled\nto be of use to you; and that I have now a pass which will enable\nme to take your sisters with comparative safety as far as Nantes.\nHad it not been for that I could have done little indeed to aid\nyou.\"\n\n\"You must not say so, Harry. You are too modest. Besides, was it\nnot your quickness that saved Victor? No, we owe you everything, and\ndisclaimers are only thrown away. As for me, I feel quite jealous\nof Jeanne's superior perspicacity, for she trusted you absolutely\nfrom the first.\"\n\n\"It has nothing to do with perspicacity,\" Jeanne said. \"Harry saved\nmy life from that dreadful dog, and after that I knew if there was\ndanger he would be able to get us out of it. That is, if it were\npossible for anyone to do so.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall be able to justify your trust, Jeanne, and arrive\nsafely with you at my father's house. I can promise you the warmest\nof welcomes from my mother and sisters. I fear they must long since\nhave given me up for dead. I shall be like a shipwrecked mariner\nwho has been cast upon an island and given up as lost. But my father\nalways used to say, that if I was a first-rate hand at getting\ninto scrapes, I was equally good at getting out of them again; and\nI don't think they will have quite despaired of seeing me again,\nespecially as they know, by the last letters I sent them, that\nyou all said I could speak French well enough to pass anywhere as\na native.\"\n\n\"How surprised they will be at your arriving with two girls and\nLouise!\" Virginie said.\n\n\"They will be pleased more than surprised,\" Harry replied. \"I have\nwritten so much about you in my letters that the girls and my mother\nwill be delighted to see you.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" Jeanne added, \"the boys will have told them you are\nwaiting behind with us, so they will not be so surprised as they\nwould otherwise have been. But it will be funny, arriving among\npeople who don't speak a word of our language.\"\n\n\"You will soon be at home with them,\" said Harry reassuringly.\n\"Jenny and Kate are just about your ages, and I expect they will\nhave grown so I shall hardly know them. It is nearly three years\nnow since I left them, and I have to look at you to assure myself\nthat Jenny will have grown almost into a young woman. Now I shall\ngo out for a bit, and leave you to chat together.\n\n\"You need not fidget about Victor, Marie. Elise is with him, and\nwill come and let you know if he wakes; but I hope that he has gone\noff fairly to sleep for the night. He knew me, and I think I have\nput his mind at rest a little as to how he came here. I have told\nhim it was an accident in the street, and that  we brought him in\nhere, and he has been too ill since to be moved. I don't think he\nwill ask any more questions. If I were you I would, while nursing,\nresume the dress you came here in. It will be less puzzling to him\nthan the one you are wearing now.\"\n\nThe little party started the next morning at day-light, and at the\nvery first village they came to, found how strict was the watch upon\npersons leaving Paris, and had reason to congratulate themselves\nupon the possession of Robespierre's safe-conduct. No sooner had\nthey sat down in the village cabaret to breakfast than an official\nwith a red scarf presented himself, and asked them who they were\nand where they were going. The production of the document at once\nsatisfied him; and, indeed, he immediately addressed the young man\nin somewhat shabby garments, who had the honour of being secretary\nto the great man, in tones of the greatest respect.\n\nVirginie at present was shy and awkward in her attire as a boy, and\nindeed had there been time the night before to procure a disguise\nfor her as a girl it would have been done, although Harry's opinion\nthat it would attract less attention for her to travel as a boy\nwas unchanged; but he would have given way had it been possible to\nmake the change. As any delay, however, would certainly be dangerous,\nthe original plan was adhered to.\n\nMarie had cut her sister's hair short, and no one would have\nsuspected from her appearance that Virginie was not what she seemed,\na good-looking boy of some thirteen years old. With their bundles\nin their hands they trudged along the road, and stopped for the\nnight at a village about twelve miles out of Paris. After having\nagain satisfied the authorities by the production of the pass,\nHarry made inquiries, and the next morning went two miles away to\na farm-house, where there was, he heard, a cart and horse to be\ndisposed of.\n\nAfter much haggling over terms--since to give the sum that was\nfirst asked would have excited surprise, and perhaps suspicion--Harry\nbecame the possessor of the horse and cart, drove triumphantly\nback to the village, and having stowed Louise and the two girls on\nsome straw in the bottom of the cart, proceeded on the journey.\n\nThey met with no adventure whatever on the journey to Nantes, which\nwas performed in ten days. The weather was bitterly cold.  Although\nit was now well on in March the snow lay deep on the ground; but\nthe girls were well wrapped  up, and the cart was filled with straw,\nwhich helped to keep them warm. Harry walked for the most part by\nthe side of the horse's head, for they could only proceed at foot-pace;\nbut he sometimes climbed up and took the reins, the better to chat\nwith the girls and keep up their spirits. There was no occasion for\nthis in the case of Jeanne, but Virginie often gave way and cried\nbitterly, and the old nurse suffered greatly from the cold in spite\nof her warm wraps.\n\nOn arriving at Nantes Harry proceeded first to the Maine, and on\nproducing Robespierre's document received a permit to lodge in the\ntown. He then looked for apartments in the neighbourhood of the\nriver, and when he had obtained them disposed of the horse and cart.\nThe statement that he was Robespierre's secretary at once secured\nfor him much attention from the authorities, and he was invited to\nbecome a member of the Revolutionary Committee during his stay in\nthe town, in order that he might see for himself with what zeal\nthe instructions received from Paris for the extermination of the\nRoyalists were being carried out.\n\nThis offer he accepted, as it would enable him to obtain information\nof all that was going on. Had it not been for this he would gladly\nhave declined the honour, for his feelings were daily harrowed by\narrests and massacres which he was powerless to prevent, for he\ndid not venture to raise his voice on the side of mercy, for had he\ndone so, it would have been certain to excite suspicion. He found\nthat, horrible as were the atrocities committed in Paris, they\nwere even surpassed by those which were enacted in the provinces,\nand that in Nantes in particular a terrible persecution was raging\nunder the direction of Carrier, who had been sent down from Paris\nas commissioner from the Commune there.\n\nHarry's next object was to make the acquaintance of some of the\nfishermen, and to find out what vessels were engaged in smuggling\ngoods across to England; for it was in one of these alone that he\ncould hope to cross the Channel. This, however, he found much more\ndifficult than he had expected.\n\nThe terror was universal. The news of the execution of the king\nhad heightened the dismay. Massacres were going on all over France.\nThe lowest ruffians in all the great towns were now their masters,\nand under pretended accusations were wreaking their hate upon the\nrespectable inhabitants. Private  enmities were wiped out in blood.\nNone were too high or too low to be denounced as Royalists, and\ndenunciation was followed as a matter of course by a mock trial\nand execution. Every man distrusted his neighbour, and fear caused\nthose who most loathed and hated the existing regime to be loudest\nin their advocacy of it. There were spies everywhere--men who\nreceived blood-money for every victim they denounced.\n\nThus, then, Harry's efforts to make acquaintances among the\nsailors met with very slight success. He was a stranger, and that\nwas sufficient to cause distrust, and ere long it became whispered\nthat he had come from Paris with special authority to hasten on the\nwork of extirpation of the enemies of the state. Soon, therefore,\nHarry perceived that as he moved along the quay little groups of\nsailors and fishermen talking together broke up at his approach, the\nmen sauntering off to the wine-shops, and any he accosted replied\ncivilly indeed, but with embarrassment and restraint; and although\nany questions of a general character were answered, a profound\nignorance was manifested upon the subject upon which he wished to\ngain information. The sailors all seemed to know that occasionally\ncargoes of spirits were run from the river to England, but none\ncould name any vessel engaged in the trade. Harry soon perceived\nthat he was regarded with absolute hostility, and one day one of\nthe sailors said to him quietly:\n\n\"Citizen, I am a good sans-culotte, and I warn you, you had best\nnot come down the river after dark, for there is a strong feeling\nagainst you; and unless you would like your body to be fished out\nof the river with half a dozen knife-holes in it, you will take my\nadvice.\"\n\nHarry began to feel almost crushed under his responsibilities.  His\nattendance at the Revolutionary Committee tried him greatly.  He\nmade no progress whatever in his efforts to obtain a passage; and\nto add to his trouble the old nurse, who had been much exhausted\nby the change from her usual habits, and the inclemency of the\nweather on her journey, instead of gaining strength appeared to be\nrapidly losing it, and was forced to take to her bed. The terrible\nevents in Paris, and the long strain of anxiety as to the safety\nof the girls and the fate of Marie, had completely exhausted her\nstrength, and the last six months had aged her as many  years. Harry\ntried hard to keep up his appearance of hopefulness, and to cheer\nthe girls; but Jeanne's quick eye speedily perceived the change in\nhim.\n\n\"You are wearing yourself out, Harry,\" she said one evening as they\nwere sitting by the fire, while Virginie was tending Louise in the\nnext room. \"I can see it in your face. It is of no use your trying\nto deceive me. You tell us every day that you hope soon to get\nhold of the captain of a boat sailing for England; but I know that\nin reality you are making no progress. All those months when we\nwere hoping to get Marie out of prison--though it seemed next to\nimpossible--you told us not to despair, and I knew you did not\ndespair yourself; but now it is different. I am sure that you do\nin your heart almost give up hope. Why don't you trust me, Harry?\nI may not be able to do much, but I might try to cheer you. You\nhave been comforting us all this time. Surely it is time I took my\nturn. I am not a child now.\"\n\n\"I feel like one just at present,\" Harry said unsteadily with\nquivering lips. \"I feel sometimes as if--as we used to say at\nschool--I could cry for twopence. I know,  Jeanne, I can trust you, and\nit isn't because I doubted your courage that I have not told you\nexactly how things are going on, but because it is entirely upon\nyou now that Louise and Virginie have to depend, and I do not wish\nto put any more weight on your shoulders; but it will be a relief\nto me to tell you exactly how we stand.\"\n\nHarry then told her how completely he had failed with the sailors,\nand how an actual feeling of hostility against him had arisen.\n\n\"I think I could have stood that, Jeanne; but it is that terrible\ncommittee that tries me. It is so awful hearing these fiends marking\nout their victims and exulting over their murder, that at times I\nfeel tempted to throw myself upon some of them and strangle them.\"\n\n\"It must be dreadful, Harry,\" Jeanne said soothingly. \"Will it not\nbe possible for you to give out that you are ill, and so absent\nyourself for a time from their meetings? I am sure you look ill--ill\nenough for anything. As to the sailors,  do not let that worry\nyou.  Even if you could hear of a ship at present it would be of no\nuse. I couldn't leave Louise; she seems to me to be getting worse\nand worse, and the doctor you called in three days ago thinks\nso too. I can see it by his face. I think he is a good man.  The\nwoman whose sick child I sat up with last night tells me the poor\nall love him. I am sure he guesses that we are not what we seem.\nHe said this morning to me:\n\n\"' I cannot do much for your grandmother. It is a general break-up.\nI have many cases like it of old people  and women upon whom the\nanxiety of the times has told. Do not worry yourself with watching,\nchild. She will sleep quietly, and will not need attendance.  If\nyou don't mind I shall have you on my hands. Anxiety affects the\nyoung as well as the old.'\n\n\"At anyrate, you see, we cannot think of leaving here at present.\nLouise has risked everything for us. It is quite impossible for\nus to leave her now, so do not let that worry you. We are all in\nGod's hands, Harry, and we must wait patiently what He may send\nus.\"\n\n\"We will wait patiently,\" Harry said. \"I feel better now, Jeanne,\nand you shall not see me give way again. What has been worrying me\nmost is the thought that it would have been wiser to have carried\nout some other plan--to have put you and Virginie, for instance,\nin some farmhouse not far from Paris, and for you to have waited\nthere till the storm blew over.\"\n\n\"You must never think that, Harry,\" Jeanne said earnestly. \"You\nknow we all talked it over dozens of times, Louise and all of us,\nand we agreed that this was our best chance, and Marie when she\ncame out quite thought so too. So, whatever comes, you must not\nblame yourself in the slightest. Wherever we were we were in danger,\nand might have been denounced.\"\n\n\"I arranged it all, Jeanne. I have the responsibility of your being\nhere.\"\n\n\"And to an equal extent you would have had the responsibility of\nour being anywhere else. So it is of no use letting that trouble\nyou.  Now, as to the sailors, you know I have made the acquaintance\nof some of the women in our street. Some of them are sailors' wives,\nand possibly through them I may be able to hear about ships. At\nanyrate I could try.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you could, Jeanne; but be very, very careful what questions\nyou put, or you might be betrayed.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is much fear of that, Harry. The women are\nmore outspoken than the men. Some of them are with what they call\nthe people; but it is clear that others are quite the other way.\nYou see trade has been almost stopped,  and there is great suffering\namong the sailors and their families. Of course I have been very\ncareful not to seem to have more money than other people; but\nI have been able to make soups and things--I have learned to be\nquite a cook from seeing Louise at work--and I take them to those\nthat are very poor, especially if they have children ill, and I\nthink I have won some of their hearts.\"\n\n\"You win everyone's heart who comes near you, Jeanne, I think,\"\nHarry said earnestly.\n\nJeanne flushed a rosy red, but said with a laugh:\n\n\"Now, Harry, you are turning flatterer. We are not at the chateau\nnow, sir, so your pretty speeches are quite thrown away; and now\nI shall go and take Virginie's place and send her in to you.\"\n\nAnd so another month went by, and then the old nurse quietly\npassed away. She was buried, to the girls' great grief, without\nany religious ceremony, for the priests were all in hiding or had\nbeen murdered, and France had solemnly renounced God and placed\nReason on His throne.\n\nIn the meantime Jeanne had been steadily carrying on her work among\nher poorer neighbours, sitting up at night with sick children, and\nsupplying food to starving little ones, saying quietly in reply to\nthe words of gratitude of the women:\n\n\"My grandmother has laid by savings during her long years of\nservice. She will not want it long, and we are old enough to work\nfor ourselves; besides, our brother Henri will take care of us. So\nwe are glad to be able to help those who need it.\"\n\nWhile she worked she kept her ears open, and from the talk of the\nwomen learned that the husbands of one or two of them were employed in\nvessels engaged in carrying on smuggling operations with England.\nA few days after the death of Louise one of these women, whose\nchild Jeanne had helped to nurse through a fever and had brought\nround by keeping it well supplied with good food, exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, how much we owe you, mademoiselle, for your goodness!\"\n\n\"You must not call me mademoiselle,\" Jeanne said, shaking her head.\n\"It would do you harm and me too if it were heard.\"\n\n\"It comes so natural,\" the woman said with a sigh. \"I was in service\nonce in a good family before I married Adolphe. But I know that\nyou are not one of those people who say there is no God, because I\nsaw you kneel down and pray by Julie's bed when you thought I was\nasleep. I expect Adolphe home in a day or two. The poor fellow\nwill be wild with delight when he sees the little one on its feet\nagain.  When he went away a fortnight ago he did not expect ever\nto see her alive again, and it almost broke his heart. But what\nwas he to do?  There are so many men out of work that if he had\nnot sailed in the lugger there would have been scores to take his\nplace, and he might not perhaps have been taken on again.\"\n\n\"He has been to England, has he not?\" Jeanne asked.\n\n\"Yes; the lugger carries silks and brandy. It is a dangerous trade,\nfor the Channel is swarming with English cruisers. But what is he\nto do? One must live.\"\n\n\"Is your husband in favour of the new state of things?\" Jeanne\nasked.\n\n\"Not in his heart, mademoiselle, any more than I am, but he holds\nhis tongue. Most of the sailors in the port hate these murdering\ntyrants of ours; but what can we do?\"\n\n\"Well, Marthe, I am sure I can trust you, and your husband can help\nme if he will.\"\n\n\"Surely you can trust me,\" the woman said. \"I would lay down my\nlife for you, and I know Adolphe would do so too when he knows what\nyou have done for us.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Marthe, I and my sister and my brother Henri are anxious\nto be taken to England. We are ready to pay well for a passage,\nbut we have not known how to set about it.\"\n\n\"I thought it might be that,\" Marthe said quietly; \"for anyone who\nknows the ways of gentlefolk, as I do, could see with half an eye\nthat you are not one of us. But they say, mademoiselle, that your\nbrother is a friend of Robespierre, and that he is one of the\ncommittee here.\"\n\n\"He is only pretending, Marthe, in order that no suspicion should\nfall upon us. But he finds that the sailors distrust him, and he\ncannot get to speak to them about taking a passage, so I thought\nI would speak to you, and you can tell me when a boat is sailing\nand who is her captain.\"\n\n\"Adolphe will manage all that for you, never fear,\" the woman\nsaid. \"I know that many a poor soul has been hidden away on board\nthe smuggler's craft and got safely out of the country; but of\ncourse it's a risk, for it is death to assist any of the suspects.\nStill the sailors are ready to run the risk, and indeed they haven't\nmuch fear of the consequences if they are caught, for the sailor\npopulation here are very strong, and they would not stand quietly\nby and see some of their own class treated as if they had done\nsome great crime merely because they were earning a few pounds by\nrunning passengers across to England. Why they have done it from\nfather to son as far as they can recollect, for there has never\nbeen a time yet when there were not people who wanted to pass from\nFrance to England and from England to France without asking the\nleave of the authorities. I think it can be managed, mademoiselle,\nespecially, as you say, you can afford to pay, for if one won't take\nyou, another will. Trade is so bad that there are scores of men\nwould start in their fishing-boats for a voyage across the Channel\nin the hope of getting food for their wives and families.\"\n\n\"I was sure it was so, Marthe, but it was so difficult to set about\nit. Everyone is afraid of spies, and it needs some one to warrant\nthat we are not trying to draw them into a snare, before anyone\nwill listen.  If your husband will but take the matter up, I have\nno doubt it can be managed.\"\n\n\"Set your mind at ease; the thing is as good as done. I tell you\nthere are scores of men ready to undertake the job when they know\nit is a straightforward one.\"\n\n\"That is good news indeed, Jeanne,\" Harry said, when the girl\ntold him of the conversation. \"That does seem a way out of our\ndifficulties. I felt sure you would be able to manage it, sooner\nor later, among the poor people you have been so good to. Hurry it\non as much as you can, Jeanne. I feel that our position is getting\nmore and more dangerous. I am afraid I do not play my part sufficiently\nwell. I am not forward enough in their violent councils. I cannot\nbring myself to vote for proposals for massacre when there is any\ndivision among them. I fear that some have suspicions. I have been\nasked questions lately as to why I am staying here, and why I have\ncome. I have been thinking for the last few days whether it would\nnot be better for us to make our way down to the mouth of the river\nand try and bribe some fishermen in the villages there who would\nnot have that feeling against me that the  men here have, to take\nus to sea, or if that could not be managed, to get on board some\nlittle fishing-boat at night and sail off by ourselves in the hopes\nof being picked up by an English cruiser.\"\n\nHarry indeed had for some days been feeling that danger was\nthickening round him. He had noticed angry glances cast at him by\nthe more violent of the committee, and had caught sentences expressing\ndoubt whether he had really been Robespierre's secretary.  That\nevening as he came out from the meeting he heard one man say to\nanother:\n\n\"I tell you he may have stolen it, and perhaps killed the citizen\nwho bore it. I believe he is a cursed aristocrat. I tell you I shall\nwatch him. He has got some women with him; the maire, who saw the\npaper, told me so. I shall make it my business to get to the bottom\nof the affair, and we will make short work with him if we find\nthings are as I believe.\"\n\nHarry felt, therefore, that the danger was even more urgent than\nhe had expressed it to Jeanne, and he had returned intending to\npropose immediate flight had not Jeanne been beforehand with her\nnews. Even now he hesitated whether even a day's delay might not\nruin them.\n\n\"Have you told me all, Harry?\" Jeanne asked.\n\n\"Not quite all, Jeanne. I was just thinking it over. I fear the\ndanger is even more pressing than I have said;\" and he repeated\nthe sentence he had overheard. \"Even now,\" he said, \"that fellow\nmay be watching outside or making inquiries about you. He will hear\nnothing but praise; but that very praise may cause him to doubt\nstill more that you are not what you seem.\"\n\n\"But why can we not run away at once?\" Virginie said. \"Why should\nwe wait here till they come and take us and carry us away and kill\nus?\"\n\n\"That is what I was thinking when I came home, Virginie; but the\nrisk of trying to escape in a fishing-boat by ourselves would be\ntremendous. You see, although I have gone out sailing sometimes on\nthe river in England, I know very little about it, and although we\nmight be picked up by an English ship, it would be much more likely\nthat we should fall into the hands of one of the French gunboats.\nSo I look upon that as a desperate step, to be taken only at the\nlast moment. And now that Jeanne seems to  have arranged a safe plan,\nI do not like trying such a wild scheme. A week now, and perhaps\nall might be arranged; but the question is--Have we a week? Have\nwe more than twenty-four hours? What do you think, Jeanne?\"\n\n\"I do not see what is best to do yet,\" Jeanne said, looking steadily\nin the fire. \"It is a terrible thing to have to decide; but I see\nwe must decide.\" She sat for five minutes without speaking, and\nthen taking down her cloak from the peg on which it hung she said;\n\"I will go round to Marthe Pichon again and tell her we are all\nso anxious for each other, that I don't think we can judge what is\nreally the best.  Marthe will see things more clearly and will be\nable to advise us.\"\n\n\"Yes, that will be the best plan.\"\n\nIt was three-quarters of an hour before she returned.\n\n\"I can see you have a plan,\" Harry said as he saw that there was\na look of brightness and hope on Jeanne's face.\n\n\"Yes, I have a plan, and a good one; that is to say, Marthe has. I\ntold her all about it, and she said directly that we must be hidden\nsomewhere till her husband can arrange for us to sail. I said, of\ncourse, that was what was wanted, but how could it be managed? So\nshe thought it over, and we have quite arranged it. She has a sister\nwho lives in a fishing-village four miles down the river. She will\ngo over there to-morrow and arrange with them to take us, and will\nget some fisher-girls' dresses for us. She says she is sure her\nsister will take us, for she was over here yesterday and heard\nabout the child getting better, and Marthe told her all sorts of\nnonsense about what I had done for it. She thinks we shall be quite\nsafe there, for there are only six or seven houses, and no one but\nfishermen live there. She proposes that you shall be dressed up in\nsome of her husband's clothes, and shall go out fishing with her\nsister's husband. What do you think of that, Harry?\"\n\n\"Splendid, Jeanne! Can the husband be trusted too?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, she says so. He is an honest man, she says; and besides,\nthey are very poor, and a little money will be a great help to them.\nShe says she would not propose it unless she was quite, quite sure\nof them, for if anything happened to us she would be a wretched\nwoman all her life.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" Harry said fervently, \"that one sees daylight at last!\nI have felt so helpless lately! Dangers seemed to be thickening\nround you, and I could do nothing; and now, Jeanne, you have found\na way out for us where I never should have found one for myself.\"\n\n\"It is God who has done it, not me,\" Jeanne said reverently. \"I did\nnot begin to go about among the poor people here with any thought\nof making friends, but because they were so poor and miserable; but\nHe must have put it into my heart to do it, in order that a way of\nescape might be made for us.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn the Hands of the Reds\n\n\nThe next morning Harry went out, as usual, immediately after\nbreakfast, for a walk for two or three hours. This he did partly\nto allow the girls to tidy the rooms, an office which had naturally\nfallen to them since the commencement of their old nurse's illness;\npartly because in active exercise he found some relief from the\nburden of his anxieties. To-day he felt more anxious than ever. The\nconversation with Marthe Pichon had afforded good grounds of hope\nthat in a day or two a fair prospect of escape would be open to them;\nbut this only seemed to make the present anxiety all the sharper.\nThe woman had promised to get disguises, and make the arrangements\nwith her friends at the village below during the course of the day,\nand by night, if all went well, they might start. He told himself\nthat he had no reason for supposing that the vague suspicions which\nwere, he knew, afloat would suddenly be converted into action. He\ndetermined to take his place that afternoon with the committee as\nusual, and endeavour to allay their doubts by assuming a violent\nattitude. He felt, however, that the day would be more trying than\nany he had passed, and that he would give a great deal if the next\ntwenty-four hours were over. Scarcely heeding where he walked he\nwas out longer than usual, and it was nearly three hours after he\nstarted before he approached the town again by the road along the\nriver bank. Just when he came to the first houses a woman, who was\nstanding there knitting, came up to him.\n\n\"You are the citizen who lives with his two sisters next door to\nLa Mere Pichon, are you not?\"\n\nHarry assented hurriedly, with a strange presentiment of evil.\n\n\"La Mere Pichon bids me tell you,\" the woman said, \"that half an\nhour after you started this morning six men, with an official with\nthe red scarf, came to the house and arrested your sisters and\ncarried them off. They are watching there for your return.\"\n\nHarry staggered as if struck with a blow.\n\n\"Poor young man,\" the woman said compassionately, seeing the ghastly\npallor of his face, \"but I pity you. The street is furious that\nthese wretches should have carried off that sweet young creature,\nwho was so good to everyone; but what could we do? We hissed the men,\nand we would have pelted them had we not been afraid of striking\nyour sisters. When they had gone La Mere Pichon said to some of\nus, 'The best thing we can do for that angel is to save her brother\nfrom being caught also. So do one of you post yourself on each\nroad leading to the house, and warn him in time. He generally walks\nbeyond the town. I heard one of his sisters say so.' So some of\nus came out on all the roads, and two remained, one at each end of\nthe street, in case we should miss you. La Mere said, whoever met\nyou was to tell you to be on this road, by the river, just outside\nthe town, after dark, and she would bring you some clothes, and\ntake you where you would be safe; but till then you were to go away\nagain, and keep far from the town. Do you understand?\" she asked,\nlaying her hand on his arm, for he seemed dazed and stupid with\nthe shock he had received.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said in a low voice. \"Thank you all for your\nwarning. Yes, I will be here this evening.\"\n\nSo saying he turned and moved away, walking unsteadily as if he\nwere drunk. The woman looked after him pityingly, and then, shaking\nher head and muttering execrations against the \"Reds,\" she made\nher way home to tell Mere Pichon that she had fulfilled her mission.\n\nHarry walked on slowly until some distance from the town, and then\nthrew himself down on a bank by the road and lay for a time silent\nand despairing. At last tears came to his relief, and his broad\nshoulders shook with a passion of sobbing to think that just at\nthe moment when a chance of escape was opened--just when all the\ndangers seemed nearly past--the girls should have fallen into\nthe hands of the enemy, and he not there to strike a blow in their\ndefence.  To think of Jeanne--his bright, fearless Jeanne--and\nclinging little Virginie, in the hands of these human  tigers. It\nwas maddening! But after a time the passion of weeping calmed down,\nand Harry sat up suddenly.\n\n\"I am a fool,\" he said as he rose to his feet; \"a nice sort of fellow\nfor a protector, lying here crying like a girl when I had begun to\nfancy I was a man; wasting my time here when I know the only hope\nfor the girls is for me to keep myself free to help them. I need\nnot lose all hope yet. After Marie has been saved, why shouldn't\nI save my Jeanne? I am better off than I was then, for we have\nfriends who will help. These women whose hearts Jeanne has won will\naid if they can, and may get some of their husbands and brothers\nto aid. The battle is not lost yet, and Jeanne will know I shall\nmove heaven and earth to save her.\"\n\nHarry's fit of crying, unmanly as he felt it, had afforded him an\nimmense relief, for he hardly knew himself how great the strain\nhad been upon him of late, and with a more elastic step he strode\naway into the country, and for hours walked on, revolving plan\nafter plan in his mind for rescuing the girls. Although nothing\nvery plausible had occurred to him he felt brighter in mind, though\nweary in body, when, just after nightfall, he again approached the\nspot where he had that morning received so heavy a blow. He was\nnot disheartened at the difficulty before him, for he knew that he\nshould have some time yet to hit upon a a plan, and the jails were\nso crowded with prisoners that he might fairly reckon upon weeks\nbefore there was any actual necessity for action. Marthe Pichon\nwas waiting for him.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur,\" she began, \"but this is a terrible day! Oh, if I\nhad but known a day or two earlier they could have moved in time,\nand now they are in the power of those wolves; but we will try\nto save them. We have been talking it over. We will all go to the\ntribunal, and we will take our husbands and our children with us,\nand we will demand their release. We will not let them be murdered.\nAnd now here are the clothes, but you need not put them on now.\nThere will be a boat here in a few minutes. We have told some of\nthe sailors how they misjudged you, and they are sorry, now it is\ntoo late, that they would not listen when you spoke to them. However,\nthey will do all they can for you. I have sent a message by a boy\nto my sister to say that I shall be down this evening, so they will\nbe expecting us.  Ah, here is the boat!\"\n\nThe splash of oars was heard, and a boat rowed along close to the\nbank.\n\n\"Is that you, Pierre?\"\n\n\"It is us, sure enough, Mere Pichon. Is all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are both here.\"\n\nIn another minute the boat was rowed alongside, and Harry and the\nwoman got on board. There were few words spoken as the two men rowed\nvigorously down stream. In three quarters of an hour some lights\nwere seen on the opposite bank, and the boat was headed towards\nthem and soon reached a little causeway.\n\n\"I shall not be more than twenty minutes,\" Mere Pichon said as she\ngot out.\n\n\"All right, we will wait!\" was the reply, and mounting the causeway\nLa Mere Pichon led the way to the farthest cottage in the little\nfishing-village. A light was burning within, and lifting the latch\nshe entered, followed by Harry. A fisherman and his wife were\nsitting by the fire.\n\n\"Here, sister Henriette and brother Pierre,\" Marthe said; \"you\nhave heard from me how a dear angel, who lived next door to me, has\nnursed and tended my little Julie, and by blessing of the Virgin\nbrought her round from her illness; and those wretches, the Reds,\nhave carried her off to-day with her sister, and you know what it\nis to fall into their hands. This is her brother, and I am going\nto ask you to give him shelter and let him stay here with you. I\nhave brought him a suit of clothes with me, and no one will guess\nthat he is not the son of some comrade of yours. He will pay you\nwell for sheltering him till we can put him on board Adolphe's\nlugger and send him across the water. If it had not been that the\nReds had come to-day I should have brought his sisters with him. I\nwas just starting to arrange it with you when those wretches came\nand took them away, and it may be that they would pay a hundred\ncrowns to you, and that is not a sum to be earned every day.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" her sister said briskly; \"that will buy Pierre a new\nboat, and a good one, such as he can go out to sea in; besides, as\nyou say, after what his sister did for Julie we are bound to help\nthem.  What do you say, Pierre?\"\n\nPierre's face had expressed anything but satisfaction until the\nmoney was mentioned, but it then changed entirely. The times were\nbad--his boat was old and unseaworthy--a hundred crowns was a\nfortune to him.\n\n\"I have risked my life often,\" he said, \"to earn five crowns,\ntherefore I do not say no to the offer. Monsieur, I accept; for a\nhundred crowns I will run the risk of keeping you here, and your\nsisters too if they should come, until you can cross the water.\"\n\n\"Very well then,\" Marthe Pichon said. \"That's settled, now I shall\nbe off at once. They will be watching the street for monsieur, and\nto-morrow, when they find he has not come back, they will be asking\nquestions, so the sooner I am back the better.\"\n\n\"We cannot give you much accommodation, monsieur,\" the fisherman\nsaid. \"There is only the loft upstairs, and, for to-night, the sails\nto sleep on; but we will try and make you more comfortable to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for comfort,\" Harry answered, \"so make no change\nfor me. Just treat me as if I were what I shall seem to be--a young\nfisherman who has come to work with you for a bit. I will row with\nyou and help you with your nets. Your sister has promised to send\na boy every day with all the news she can gather. Now, if you have\na piece of bread I will gladly eat it, for I have touched nothing\nsince breakfast.\"\n\n\"We can do better than that for you,\" the woman replied, and in a\nfew minutes some fish were frying over the fire. Fortunately the\nlong hours he had been on his feet had thoroughly tired Harry out,\nand after eating his supper he at once ascended to the loft, threw\nhimself on the heap of sails, and in a few minutes was sound asleep.\nThe next morning he dressed himself in the fisherman's clothes with\nwhich he had been provided, and went down stairs.\n\n\"You will do,\" Pierre said, looking at him; \"but your hands and face\nare too white. But I was tanning my sails yesterday, and there is\nsome of the stuff left in the boiler; if you rub your hands and\nface with that you will do well.\"\n\nHarry took the advice, and the effect was to give him the appearance\nof a lad whose face was bronzed by long exposure to the sea and\nair.\n\n\"You will pass anywhere now,\" Pierre said approvingly. \"I shall give\nout that you belong to St. Nazaire, and are the son of a friend of\nmine whose fishing-boat was lost in the last gale, and so you have\ncome to work for a time with me; no one would ask you any more.\nBesides, we are all comrades, and hate the Reds, who have spoilt\nour trade by killing all our best customers, so if they come asking\nquestions here they won't get a word out of anyone.\"\n\nFor ten days Harry lived with the fisherman. Adolphe had returned\nin his lugger the day after his arrival there, and came over the\nnext evening to see him. He said that it would be some little time\nbefore the lugger sailed again, but that if he was ready to start\nbefore she sailed he would manage to procure him a passage in some\nother craft. He said that he had already been talking to some of\nthe sailors on the wharves, and that they had promised to go to\nthe Tribunal when the girls were brought up before it, and that he\nwould manage to get news from a friend employed in the prison when\nthat would be.\n\nHarry frequently went up in a boat to Nantes with Pierre with the\nfish they had caught. He had no fear of being recognized, and did\nnot hesitate to land, though he seldom went far from the boat.\nAdolphe was generally there, and he and two or three of his comrades,\nwho were in the secret, always hailed him as an old acquaintance,\nso that had any of the spies of the Revolutionists been standing\nthere, no suspicion that Harry was other than he seemed would have\nentered their minds.\n\nOne evening, three weeks after Harry's arrival at the hut, Adolphe\ncame in with his head bound up by a bandage.\n\n\"What is the matter, Adolphe?\" Harry exclaimed.\n\n\"I have bad news for you, monsieur. I learned this morning that\nmesdemoiselles were to-day to be brought before the Tribunal, and\nwe filled the hall with women and two or three score of sailors.\nMesdemoiselles were brought out. The young one seemed frightened,\nbut the elder was as calm and brave as if she feared nothing. They\nwere asked their names, and she said:\n\n\"'I am Jeanne de St. Caux, and this is my sister Virginie. We have\ncommitted no crime.'\n\n\"Carrier himself was there, and he said:\n\n\"'You are charged with being enemies of France, with being here\nin disguise, and with trying to leave France contrary to the laws\nagainst emigration, and with being in company with one who, under\nfalse pretenses, obtained admission to the Committee of Safety\nhere, but who is an enemy and traitor to France. What do you say?'\n\n\"'I do not deny that we were in disguise,' she said in her clear\nvoice. 'Nor do I deny that we should have escaped if we could. And\nas you treat us as enemies, and our lives are in danger, I cannot\nsee that we were to blame in doing so. I deny that we are enemies\nof France, or that the gentleman who was with us was so either. He\ndid not obtain a place on the committee by fraud, for he was really\nthe secretary of Monsieur Robespierre, and he could not refuse the\npost when it was offered to him.'\n\n\"Then we thought it was time to speak, and the women cried out\nfor mercy, and said how good she had been to the poor; and we men\ncried out too. And then Carrier got into a passion, and said they\nwere traitors and worthy of death, and that they should die.  And\nwe shouted we would not have it, and broke into the Tribunal and\nsurrounded mesdemoiselles, and then the guards rushed in and there\nwas a fight. We beat them off and got outside, and then a regiment\ncame up, and they were too strong for us, though we fought stoutly,\nI can tell you, for our blood was up; but it was no use. The dear\nladies were captured again, and many of us got severe wounds.  But\nthe feeling was strong, I can tell you, among the sailors when the\nnews spread through the town, for some of the women got hurt, too,\nin the melee, and I think we could get five hundred men together\nto storm the jail.\"\n\nHarry was bitterly disappointed, for he had hoped that the\nintercession of the women might have availed with the judges, and\ndoubtless would have done so had not Carrier himself been present.\nHowever, he thanked the sailor warmly for the efforts he had made\nand gave him some money to distribute among the wounded, for he\nalways carried half his money concealed in a belt under his clothes.\nThe other half was hidden away under a board in his lodgings,\nso that in case of his being captured the girls would still have\nfunds available for their escape. As to the prospects of storming\nthe jail he did not feel sanguine. It was strongly guarded, and\nthere were three regiments of troops in the town, and  these could\nbe brought up before the fishermen could force the strong defences\nof the jail. However, as a last resource, this might be attempted.\n\nTwo days later Adolphe again returned, and was obliged to confess\nin answer to Harry's inquiries that he feared the sailors as a body\nwould not join in the attempt.\n\n\"I can hardly blame them, monsieur. For though I myself would risk\neverything, and some of the others would do so too, it is a terrible\nthing for men with wives and families to brave the anger of these\nmonsters. They would think nothing of putting us all to death.\nIt isn't the fighting we are afraid of, though the odds are heavy\nagainst us, but it's the vengeance they would take afterwards,\nwhether we happened to win or whether we didn't.\"\n\n\"I cannot blame them,\" Harry said. \"As you say, even if they succeeded\nthere would be a terrible vengeance for it afterwards. No; if the\ngirls are to be rescued it must be by some other way. I have been\nquiet so long because I hoped that the intercession of the women\nwould have saved them. As that has failed I must set to work. I\nhave thought of every method, but bribery seems the only chance.\nWill you speak to the man you know in the prison, and sound him\nwhether it will be possible to carry out any plan in that way?\"\n\n\"I will speak again to him,\" Adolphe said. \"But I have already\nsounded him, and he said that there were so many guards and jailers\nthat he feared that it would be impossible. But I will try again.\"\n\nThe next day, soon after dinner, Adolphe came again, and there was\na white scared look upon his face which filled Harry with alarm.\n\n\"What is it, Adolphe? What is your news?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I can hardly tell it,\" Adolphe said in a low awe-stricken\nvoice. \"It is too awful even for these  fiends.\"\n\n\"What is it, Adolphe? Tell me. If they have been murdered I will\ngo straight to Nantes and kill Carrier the first time he leaves\nhis house, though they may tear me to pieces afterwards.\"\n\n\"They are not murdered yet,\" Adolphe said; \"but they are to be, and\neveryone else.\" And this time the sailor sat down and cried like\na child.\n\nAt last, in answer to Harry's entreaties, he raised his head and\ntold the story. The Revolutionary Committee had that day been down\nat the wharf, and had taken for the public service four old luggers\npast service which were lying on  the mud, and they had openly\nboasted that an end was going to put to the aristocrats; that the\nguillotine was too slow, that the prison must be cleared, and that\nthey were going to pack the aristocrats on board the luggers and\nsink them.\n\nHarry gave a cry of horror, in which the fisherman and his wife\njoined, the latter pouring out voluble curses against Carrier and\nthe Reds.\n\nAfter his first cry Harry was silent; he sank down on to a low chair,\nand sat there with his face hidden in his hands for some minutes,\nwhile the fisherman and his wife poured question after question upon\nAdolphe. Presently Harry rose to his feet, and saying to Adolphe,\n\"Do not go away, I shall be back presently, I must think by myself,\"\nwent out bareheaded into the night.\n\nIt was half an hour before he returned.\n\n\"Now, Adolphe,\" he said, \"I can think again. Now, how are they to\nbe saved?\"\n\n\"I cannot say, monsieur,\" Adolphe said hesitatingly. \"It does not\nseem to me--\"\n\n\"They have to be saved,\" Harry interrupted him in a grave, steady\nvoice. \"The question is how?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" Adolphe agreed hesitatingly, \"that is the question.\nYou can rely upon me, monsieur,\" he went on, \"to do my best whatever\nyou may decide; but I have no head to invent things.  You tell me\nand I will do it.\"\n\n\"I know I can rely upon you, Adolphe. As far as I can see there\nare but two ways. One is for me to go to Carrier's house, find the\nmonster, place a pistol at his head, compel him to order them to\nbe released, stand with him at the prison door till they come out,\nembark with him and them in a boat, row down the river, and put to\nsea.\"\n\n\"And then, monsieur?\" Adolphe asked after a pause, seeing that\nHarry was speaking to himself rather than to him.\n\n\"Yes, that is the question that I cannot answer,\" Harry replied.\n\"I can see all the rest as if it were passing. I can feel Carrier\ntrembling in my grasp, and shrinking as the pistol touches his\nforehead. I can hear him giving his orders, I can see the crowd\nfalling back as I walk with him through the street, I can hear  him\ncrying to the people to stand aside and let us pass, I can see us\ngoing down the river together; but what am I to do in a boat with\ntwo ladies at sea?\"\n\n\"Could you not embark in a lugger?\" Adolphe exclaimed, carried\naway by the picture which Harry seemed to be describing as if he\nsaw it. \"Why not start in a lugger at once? I might have the Trois\nFreres ready, and the men will all stand by you; and when we are\nonce outside the river we will throw Carrier over to the fishes\nand make for England.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Adolphe. If the other plans seem impossible we will\ntry that, but only as a last resource; for I know the chances are\na hundred to one against its success. I should have no fear as to\nCarrier himself, but as I went through the streets some one else\nmight place a musket at the back of my head and shoot me. If I\ncould get him alone it would be different. You could go with me;\nI would force him to sign the order of release; you could take it;\nand I would stand over him till you had time to embark with them;\nthen I would blow out his brains and make my way down to the river.\nBut there would be no chance of finding him alone. Monsters like\nthis are always fearful of assassination.\"\n\n\"And what is monsieur's other plan?\"\n\n\"The other plan is to get on board the boat in which they are to be\nplaced--you might find out which it is from your friend in prison--hide\ndown in the hold until the guards leave her; then join them;\nand when she sinks fasten them to a spar and drift down the river\nwith them till out of sight of the town, when Pierre could row off\nand pick them up.\"\n\n\"They say there are to be soldiers on each side of the river,\"\nAdolphe said despondently, \"to shoot down any who may try to swim\nto shore. But there would not be many who would try. Most of them,\nthey say, will be women and children; but the heads would be seen\nas you drifted down.\"\n\n\"Yes; but we must think of something, Adolphe--think, man,\nthink--and you, Pierre, think; if you were in a sinking ship, and you\nwanted something which would hide you from the eyes of people a\nhundred yards away, what would you take?\"\n\n\"But you would be seen on anything you climbed on to or clung to,\nmonsieur.\n\n\"But we need not climb on to it,\" Harry said. \"I can take pieces\nof cork with me and wrap round them so as to keep their faces just\nafloat. I should only want something that would hide their faces.\"\n\n\"A hatch might do,\" Pierre said.\n\n\"The very thing!\" Harry exclaimed with a fresh ring of animation\nand hopefulness in his voice. \"The very thing! Of course there\nwould be a hatchway to the forecastle of the lugger. We might get\nthat loosened beforehand, so that it would float off. What is the\nsize of such a hatch?\"\n\n\"Some four feet square, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That will be enough,\" Harry said; \"but how high would a hatch\nfloat out of water, because there must be room between the top of\nthe water for us to breathe as we lie on our backs. Four inches\nwould be enough. Are the sides buoyant enough to keep the top that\nmuch out of water?\"\n\n\"I do not think so, monsieur,\" Pierre said with a shake of the\nhead. \"It would float nearly level with the water.\"\n\n\"But see here, monsieur,\" Adolphe said eagerly; \"I have an idea!\nThe hatches are covered with tarpaulin. If you could hide in the\nforecastle during the night you might cut away all the top underneath\nthe tarpaulin and prop it up, so that if anyone trod on it in the\nmorning they would not notice what had been done. Then when they\nhave pushed off you could knock away the props, the board would\ntumble down, and there would be only the tarpaulin cover on the\nsides. It would float then quite four inches out of the water, and\nthat in the middle of the stream would look almost level with it.\"\n\n\"I will try it,\" Harry said; \"there is a chance of success.\"\n\n\"It is a terrible risk, monsieur,\" Pierre said.\n\n\"I know it,\" Harry replied; \"but it is just possible. The chances\nare a hundred to one against it, but it may succeed. Well, Pierre,\ndo you be with your boat on the river just below the point where\nthe town can be seen. If you see a hatch floating down row to it.\nIf we are beneath it, well and good; if not--\"\n\n\"If not, monsieur,\" the fisherman's wife said solemnly, \"we will\npray for your souls.\"\n\n\"Adolphe will send down to you in the morning the two fisher-girls'\ndresses his wife had prepared for the ladies. Have some brandy in\nthe boat and your little charcoal stove, and keep water boiling.\nThey will want it. And now good-bye, my good friends! Pray for us\nto-night. Now, Adolphe, let us hasten back to the town, for there\nis much to be done. And first of all you must see your friend in\nthe prison; find out if mesdemoiselles are on the list of those\nto be murdered. I have no doubt they will be, for after the emeute\nthere has been about them they are almost sure to be among the\nfirst victims.  But above all, find out, if you can, which vessel\nthey are to be placed in.\n\n\"But if I cannot find that out, monsieur; if there is no arrangement\nmade at all--though I should think there would be, for the butchers\nwill like to have everything done in order--\"\n\n\"Then I will get you to find a dozen men you can trust to volunteer\nto row the boats to put them on board. And you must be sure to take\nthe boat in which they are to the lugger we have prepared.\"\n\n\"I will try,\" Adolphe said, \"though I would rather cut off my hand\nthan pull an oar to take these poor creatures out to be murdered.\nBut I will do it, monsieur. But except for that I warrant me they\nwill not get a sailor in Nantes to put his hand to an oar to aid\ntheir accursed work.\"\n\nIt was four o'clock when they arrived at Nantes. Adolphe went\nstraight to the prison, while Harry walked along the quay. When\nhe came abreast the centre of the town a number of sailors and\nfishermen were standing talking in low tones, and looking with\nhorror at four luggers moored in a line in the centre of the river.\nA number of men drawn from the scum of the town were painting them\nwhite, while a strong body of troops were drawn up on the quay in\nreadiness to put a summary stop to any demonstration of hostility\non the part of the sailors. These did not indeed venture to express\nopenly their detestation of the proceedings, but the muttered\nexecrations and curses that rose from the little group showed how\ndeep were their feelings.\n\nHarry joined a little knot of three or four men who had been, with\nAdolphe, in the habit of greeting him when he landed.\n\n\"All is lost, you see!\" one of them said in a tone of deep\ncommiseration. \"There is nothing left but vengeance--we will take\nthat one of these days--but that is a poor consolation for you\nnow.\"\n\n\"All is not quite lost,\" Harry said. \"I have yet one hope.\"\n\n\"We dare not try force,\" one of the other men said. \"They have marched\nthree more regiments of Reds in to-day. What can we do against them\nwithout arms? I could cry to think that we are so helpless in the\nface of these things.\"\n\n\"No; I know force is useless,\" Harry said. \"Still I have just one\nhope left. It is a desperate one, and I cannot tell you what it is\nnow; but to-night, maybe, Adolphe may ask you to help us. I expect\nhim here soon.\"\n\nIn half an hour Adolphe returned, and Harry at once joined him.\n\n\"I have got the news I wanted,\" he said. \"Mesdemoiselles are to be\nin the first batch brought out. Boats have already been bought by\nthe Reds to row them out, and men hired. They were forced to buy\nthe boats, for not a man would let his craft for such a purpose.\nIt would be accursed ever afterwards, no sailor would ever put a\nfoot on board. The first boats will go to the ship lying lowest in\nthe stream; then they will come back and take the next batch out\nto the vessel next above; and so until all are on board. There will\nbe fifty placed on board each lugger; and I hear, monsieur, that\nis only the first of it, and that the drownings will go on until\nthe prisons are cleared.\"\n\n\"Thank God we know that much, Adolphe! Now, in the first place,\nI want you to get me some tools--a sharp saw, a chisel, a large\nscrew-driver, and half a dozen large screws; also, two beams of\nwood to fasten across the hatchway and keep the boards up after I\nhave sawn through them; also, I want three bundles of cork--flat\npieces will be the best if you can get them, but that doesn't matter\nmuch. I may as well have an auger too. When you go back to your\nhouse will you go in next door and ask our landlady, Mere Leflo--\"\n\n\"She died three days ago,\" the man said.\n\n\"Then go into the house without asking, and in the farthest corner\nto the right-hand side of the kitchen scratch away the earth, and\nyou will find a little bag of money. If I fail to-morrow, keep it\nfor yourself; if I succeed, bring it to me at Pierre's. When does\nyour lugger sail for England?\"\n\n\"In three days, monsieur. I have already sounded the captain, and\nI think he will take you. And what shall I do next?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock this evening have a boat with the things on board\nhalf a mile below the town. Give a low whistle, and I will answer\nit. Wrap some flannel round the rowlocks to muffle the sound.  It\nwill be a dark night, and there's a mist rising already from the\nriver.  I do not think there's much chance of our meeting any boats\nnear those vessels.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" Adolphe agreed. \"It makes me shiver to look at them.\nThere will be no boat out on the river to-night except ours.  Will\nyou not come home with me, monsieur, until it is time to start?\nYou will need supper, for you must keep up your strength.\"\n\nHarry accepted the sailor's invitation; and after partaking of\na meal with Adolphe and his wife, who was informed of the attempt\nwhich was about to be made, he sat looking quietly into the fire,\narranging in his mind all the details of the enterprise, uttering\nmany a silent but fervent prayer that he might be permitted to save\nthe lives of the two girls.\n\nAdolphe went in and out making his preparations. At half-past eight\nhe said, touching Harry on the shoulder: \"It is time to start,\nmonsieur. I have got the bag of money. Everything is in the boat,\nand I saw the men start with it. It is time for us to go and meet\nthem.\"\n\nMarthe burst into tears as she said good-bye to Harry.\n\n\"I shall spend all night on my knees,\" she said, \"praying God and\nthe Holy Virgin to aid you and save those dear angels. Here is\na packet, monsieur, with some food for you to eat in the morning,\nand a bottle of good wine. You will want strength for your adventure.\"\n\nThree or four minutes after Harry and Adolphe had gained\nthe appointed spot they heard a low whistle on the water. Adolphe\nwhistled in return, and in another minute a dark object appeared\nthrough the mist. They took their places in the stern, and the boat\nrowed quietly off again. So well were the oars muffled that Harry\ncould hear no sound save an almost imperceptible splash each time\nthey dipped into the water.\n\nThe town was very still and scarce a sound was heard. The awe\nof the horrible event which was about to take place hung over the\ntown, and although there was drinking and exultations among the\nruffians in the back lanes, even these instinctively avoided the\nneighbourhood of the river.\n\nSo thick was the fog that they were some little time before they\nfound the white luggers. When they did so they rowed to that moored\nlowest down the stream and made fast alongside. Noiselessly the\ntools and beams were handed on board. Then Harry said:\n\n\"That is all, Adolphe.\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur. We are not going to leave you till the work\nis done. We have settled that four sets of hands can work better\nthan one, and besides, we may hit on some idea. No one can say.\"\n\nFinding it useless to remonstrate, Harry let the good fellows have\ntheir way. The men had already removed their boots, and noiselessly\nmade their way to the hatch of the forecastle.\n\n\"Ah, it is just as well I brought a file with me,\" Adolphe said in\na low voice, as he knelt down and felt the hatch. \"It is fastened\ndown with a staple and padlock. They are old, but you might have\nsome trouble in breaking them. But let us see first. No, it moves.\nNow, a wrench all together.\"\n\nAs he spoke the staple came up through the rotten wood of the deck.\nThe hatch was then lifted.\n\n\"Lower it down corner-ways into the fo'castle,\" Adolphe said.  \"We\ncan work all the better at it there. Jacques, do you get that sail\nup out of the boat and throw it over the hatch. It isn't likely\nanyone will come out here through the fog; but it's just as well\nnot to run any risk.\"\n\nAs soon as all were below, and the sail spread over the opening\nabove, Adolphe produced a dark lantern from the great pocket of his\nfisherman's cloak, together with two or three candles. These were\nlit at the lantern, and the party then set to work.\n\nTwo saws had been brought on board, and a piece three feet square\nwas cut out of the top of the hatch, leaving six inches of wood\nall round. Great pains were taken not to saw through the tarpaulin\ncover.\n\n\"Now, the next thing to do,\" Harry said, \"is to fix the beams so\nas to hold the wood in its place again.\" Four pieces of wood, each\nthree inches long, were screwed against the combing of the hatchway\nin such a position that when the beams were placed upon them they\nwere exactly level with the top, and supported the piece cut out\nfrom the hatchway in its original position.\n\n\"That will do rarely,\" Adolphe said, when it was finished and the\nhatchway experimentally placed in its position. \"Now, all you have\nto do is just to knock the ends of the beams off their ledges.  The\nbit we have cut out will fall down, and you will be able easily\nenough to lift the hatchway from its place. It is no great weight\nnow.\n\n\"It will do capitally,\" Harry agreed, \"and when it floats the\ntarpaulin will certainly be three inches above the water. Yes, I\nhave no fear of that part of the adventure going wrong. You don't\nthink that it will be noticed from the shore, Adolphe?\"\n\n\"Not it,\" Adolphe answered confidently. \"Why, from the shore it\nwill look awash with the water. No one will ever dream that there\ncould be a soul alive underneath it. I begin to think you will do\nit, monsieur. At first it seemed hopeless. Now I really do think\nthere is a chance. I should feel pretty confident if it was you\nand two of us who had to do it; but the difficulty will be to get\nthe young ladies under it, and then to get them to lie quiet there.\"\n\n\"That is the difficulty,\" Harry admitted. \"I am sure of the eldest.\nHer nerves are as good as mine; what I fear is about the younger.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, monsieur,\" one of the other men said; \"if you\ntake my advice you will have a piece of rope in readiness and tie\nit round her arms so as to prevent her struggling.\"\n\n\"That would be the best way,\" Harry agreed. \"Yes, if I see she\nwon't be calm and do as I tell her, that is what I will do.\"\n\n\"Now, monsieur, I will bore a couple of auger-holes through the\nbulkhead here so that you can see what is going on in the hold.\nThey have got the hatch off there. I suppose it wasn't padlocked,\nand they will no doubt go down to bore the holes the last thing.\nLike enough they have bored them already, and will only have to\nknock out the plugs. I will just go and see anyhow. If that is so\nyou may set your mind at rest that none of them will come down here\nin the morning.\"\n\nSo saying, taking the dark lantern he climbed up on deck, and\ndescended the hold.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said when he returned; \"there are six holes bored\nwith plugs in them, so they won't be coming down here. When we\ngo up we will put the staple into its hole again, so that it will\nlook all right. Now, monsieur, we will just  have one nip of brandy\napiece out of this bottle, and then we will be off. It's just\ngone midnight, and it were best we should leave you to sleep for a\nfew hours. You will want your strength in the morning, unless, of\ncourse, you would rather we stopped with you for a bit.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Adolphe, I don't think I shall sleep; I shall sit\nand think out every detail.\"\n\n\"Then good night, monsieur. May the good God bless you and aid you\nto-morrow, and I think he will! I do think you are the bravest man\nI ever met.\"\n\n\"I am not brave for myself, Adolphe, but for them.\"\n\nThe three men shook hands with Harry, and one after another in\nhusky voices gave him their good wishes. Then they ascended to the\ndeck, put on the hatch, pressed the staple down through its holes\nin the deck, got into the boat, cast off the head-rope, and got\nout the oars.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, what courage!\" one of them exclaimed. \"His hand is as\nsteady, and his voice as firm as if he were going fishing to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I think he will succeed;\" Adolphe said, \"anyhow, we will have our\nboat out below the bend of the river, and lend a hand to Pierre to\nget them out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe Noyades\n\n\nWhen left alone Harry blew out the other candles, but left that\nin the lantern burning, and threw himself down on the locker and\nthought over every detail of the work for the next day. As he had\nsaid, the great danger was of Virginie struggling and being too\nfrightened to follow his instructions. Certainly he could fasten a\nrope round her, but even then it might be difficult to manage her.\nThe next danger was, that other persons might cling to the hatchway.\nHarry felt the long knife which was concealed in his breast.\n\n\"God grant I may not have to use it!\" he said. \"But, if it must be,\nI shall not hesitate. They would simply destroy us without saving\nthemselves, that is certain; therefore, I am justified in defending\nthe girls, as I would against any other enemy.\"\n\nHe knelt down and prayed for some time. Then he replaced the piece\nthey had cut out from the hatch, and fixed the beams beneath it,\nand then lay down again. He was worn out by the excitement of the\nday, and in spite of his anxiety about the morrow he presently fell\noff to sleep.\n\nIt was long before he woke. When he did so, he looked through one\nof the auger-holes into the hold and saw the light streaming down\nthe open hatchway, and could tell that the sun was already up.\n\nHe ate the food which Marthe had put into his pocket just as he\nwas starting; saw that the bundles of corks were ready at hand, and\nthe ropes attached to them so placed that they could be fastened on\nin an instant. Then there was nothing to do but to wait. The time\npassed slowly. Presently he heard the sound of drums and bugles, and\nknew that the troops were taking up their positions on the quays.\nAt last--it seemed many hours to him--he heard the splash of oars,\nand presently a slight shock as a boat ran alongside the lugger.\nThen there were voices, and the sound of  feet above as persons\nmounted on to the deck. There was a scraping noise by the lugger's\nside, and immediately afterwards another bump as the second boat\ntook the place of the first.\n\nThis, as far as Harry could hear, did not leave the lugger. There\nwas a great hum of talking on deck, principally in women's voices,\nand frequently persons stepped on the hatch, and Harry congratulated\nhimself that the beams gave a solid support to it.\n\nHalf an hour passed, as well as Harry could judge, then the boom\nof a cannon was heard, and immediately two men leapt down into the\nhold, knocked the six plugs out of their place, and climbed up on\ndeck again. There was again the scraping noise, and Harry knew the\nboat had pushed off this time for good. He watched as if fascinated\nthe six jets of water for a minute or two. Then, saying to himself,\n\"It is time,\" he knocked the beams from their ledges, allowed\nthe square of wood to fall, lifted the hatch, and pushed it off\nits combing, and then clambered on to the deck with the corks and\nropes. There were some fifty persons on board, for the most part\nwomen and children, but with two or three men among them. They were\ngathered near the stern, and were apparently watching the scene\nashore with astonishment. He hurried aft, having no fear that at\nthis distance from the shore his figure would be recognized from\nthe rest, and, if it were, it mattered not. Two or three turned\nround as the supposed sailor came aft, exclaiming:\n\n\"What does this mean? Why are we put here on board these white\nships? What are they going to do with us?\"\n\n\"Alas, ladies,\" he said, \"they have put you here to die; they have\nbored holes in the ships' bottoms, and in a few minutes they will\nsink. It is a wholesale execution.\"\n\nAs he began to speak one of the ladies in the stern pushed her way\nthrough the rest.\n\n\"Oh, Harry, is it you!\" she exclaimed as he finished. \"Is it true,\nare we to die together?\"\n\n\"We are in God's hands, Jeanne, but there is hope yet. Bring Virginie\nforward with me.\"\n\nAt Harry's first words a panic had seized all around; one or two\nran to the hatchway and looked down into the hold, and screamed\nout that the water was rushing in; then some cried to the distant\ncrowd to send to save them; others ran up  and down as if demented;\nwhile some threw themselves on their knees. But the panic soon\npassed away; all had for weeks looked death in the face, and though\nthe unexpected form in which it appeared had for the moment shaken\nthem, they soon recovered. Mothers clasped their daughters to their\nbreasts for a last farewell, and then all with bowed heads kneeled\nand listened in silence to an old man who began to pray aloud.\n\nJeanne, without another word, had taken Virginie's hands and\naccompanied Harry forward to the fore part of the deck.\n\n\"Jeanne, I am going to try to save you and Virginie, but everything\ndepends upon your being cool and brave. I need not urge you, because\nI am sure of you. Virginie, will you try to be so for Jeanne's sake\nand your own? If you do not we must all die together.\"\n\n\"What are we to do, Harry?\" Jeanne said steadily, while Virginie\nclung to her sister sobbing bitterly.\n\n\"Fasten this bundle of corks between Virginie's shoulders high\nup-yes, there.\"\n\nWhile Jeanne was doing this, Harry fastened a rope to a ring in the\nside of the hatch, then he tied the corks on to Jeanne's shoulders,\nand adjusted the third bundle to his own. \"Now, Jeanne,\" he said,\n\"I will tell you what we are going to do. You see this hatch; when\nthe vessel sinks it will float, and we must float on our backs with\nour faces underneath it so that it will hide us from the sight of\nthe wretches on shore; and even if they put out in boats to kill\nany who may be swimming or clinging to spars, they will not suspect\nthat there is anyone under this. We may not succeed; an accident\nmay betray us, but there is a possibility. At anyrate, dear, we\nshall live or die together.\"\n\n\"I am content,\" Jeanne said quietly.\n\n\"You know, Jeanne,\" Harry said, putting his hands on the girl's\nshoulders, \"that I love you; I should never have told you so until\nI got you home if it hadn't been for this; but though I have never\nsaid it, you know I love you.\"\n\n\"I know, Harry, and I love you too with all my heart; so much that\nI can feel almost happy that we are going to die together. We are\naffianced now, dear, come what will.\" And she lifted her face to\nhis.\n\nHe gave her one long kiss, then there was a crash. Impatient at\nthe length of time the vessels were in sinking, those ashore had\nopened fire with cannons upon them, and the shot had struck the\nlugger just above the water.\n\nWith a little cry Virginie fell senseless on the deck.\n\n\"That's the best thing that could have happened,\" Harry said as\nJeanne stooped over her sister. \"Lie down on the deck, dear, or\nyou may be struck; they are firing with muskets now. I am going to\nlie down too,\" he said in answer to her look, \"but I shall first\ntwist this cord round Virginie so as to keep her arms by her side,\notherwise when the water touches her she may come to her senses\nand struggle.  That's all right.\"\n\nThen he lay down on the deck between the girls with his head against\nthe hatch, and holding the rope.\n\n\"Put your head on my shoulder, Jeanne, and I will put my arm round\nyou; I will hold Virginie the same way the other side. Hold tight\nby me for a moment as we sink, I may have to use my arms to get\nthe hatch over our faces. Do not breathe while you are under the\nwater, for we shall, no doubt, go down with the lugger, although\nI shall try to keep you afloat; when you are under the hatch you\nwill find you will float with your mouth well out of the water,\nand will be able to breathe, the corks will keep you up.\"\n\n\"I understand, Harry; now let us pray until the time comes.\"\n\nShot after shot struck the lugger, then Harry felt her give a sudden\nlurch. There was a wild cry and the next moment she went down stern\nfirst. She was so nearly even with the water when she sank, that\nthere was less downward suck than Harry had expected, and striking\nout with his feet his head was soon above the surface.  The cord\nhad kept the hatch within a couple of feet of him, and with some\ndifficulty, owing to the buoyancy of the corks, he thrust himself\nand the girls under it. The tarpaulin was old and rotten, and the\nlight penetrated in several places, and Harry could see that, in\nthe position in which they were lying, the faces of both girls were\nabove the water.\n\nIt was useless to speak for their ears were submerged; but a slight\nmotion from Jeanne responded to a pressure of his arm, and he knew\nthat she was sensible although she had not made the slightest motion\nfrom the moment the vessel sank. Virginie had not, as he feared\nwould be the case, recovered her  senses with the shock of the\nimmersion, but lay insensible on his shoulder. He could see by the\nmovement of Jeanne's lips that she was praying, and he too thanked\nGod that He had given success to the plan so far, and prayed for\nprotection to the end.\n\nWith every minute that passed, his hopes rose; everything had\nanswered beyond his expectation. The other victims had apparently\nnot even noticed what he was doing, and therefore had not, as he\nfeared might be the case, interfered with his preparations, nor\nhad any of them striven to gain a hold on the hatchway. The sinking\nof the vessels, and the tearing up of the water by the shot, would\nrender the surface disturbed and broken, and decrease the chances\nof the floating hatch attracting attention. After ten minutes had\npassed he felt certain that they must be below the point where the\ntroops were assembled.\n\nThe tide was running out strong, for the time for the massacre had\nbeen fixed at an hour which would ensure the bodies being swept down\nto sea. Half an hour would, he thought, take them past the bend,\nwhere their friends would be waiting for them. The time seemed\nendless, for although Harry felt the coldness of the water but little\nfor himself, he knew that it must be trying indeed for Jeanne. As\nfar as he could see her face it was as white as her sister's; but\nhe had hold of one of her hands now, and knew that she was still\nconscious.\n\nAt last he heard the sound of oars. It might not be one of the\nfriendly boats; but the probability was that it was one or other\nof them. Had they seen any other fisherman's boat near the point\nthey would have rowed high up so as to intercept the hatch before\nit reached the stranger. Harry could not hear voices; for although\nthe water had conveyed the sound of the oars a considerable distance,\nhe could hear no sound in the air.\n\nThe oars came nearer and nearer, and by the quickness with which\nthe strokes followed each other he knew that two boats were at\nhand. Then the hatch was suddenly lifted, and as Harry raised his\nhead above water there was a loud cheer, and he saw Adolphe and\nPierre, one on each side, stretch out their arms to him. The girls\nwere first lifted into Pierre's boat, for Jeanne was as incapable\nof movement as her sister, then Harry was  dragged in, the rough\nsailors shaking his hand and patting him on the shoulder, while\nthe tears ran down their cheeks.\n\n\"Give them some hot brandy and water,\" were his first words.  Pierre\nhad a kettle boiling. A glass of hot liquor was placed to Jeanne's\nlips.\n\nAt first she could not swallow, but after a few drops had passed\nher lips she was able to take a sip, and would then have stopped,\nbut Harry insisted upon her drinking the whole contents of the\nglass.\n\n\"You must do as you are told, Jeanne,\" he said in her ear. \"You\nbelong to me now, you know. It can do you no harm chilled as you\nare, and may save you from illness.\"\n\nIn the meantime Pierre had poured several spoonfuls of nearly neat\nbrandy between Virginie's lips. Adolphe, and one of the men with\nhim, had changed over into Pierre's boat, and were rowing lustily\ndown the river.\n\nAs soon as Jeanne was able to sit up she began to chafe one of\nVirginie's hands, while Harry took the other.\n\n\"Take off her shoes, Pierre, and soak a swab with the hot water\nand put it to her feet.\"\n\nBut with all these efforts it was not until they were close to\nPierre's village that Virginie opened her eyes. When they arrived\nat the little causeway the two girls were wrapped up in the peasants\ncloaks which Pierre had brought with him. Jeanne took Harry's arm,\nwhile Adolphe lifted Virginie and carried her up. Henriette was\nstanding at the door as Jeanne staggered in with Harry.\n\n\"That is right, mademoiselle. Thank God who has brought you straight\nthrough the danger. Now, do not stop a moment, but come in here\nand get into bed, it is all ready for you. The blankets have been\nbefore the fire until the moment you landed; they will soon give\nyou warmth. Hurry in, mademoiselle; I will undress your sister.\nAnd do you, Monsieur Sandwith, hurry up to the loft and get on dry\nclothes.\"\n\nHarry soon rejoined the party in the kitchen. The strong glass of\nhot spirits he had drunk had sent the blood quickly through his\nveins, and he felt in a glow of warmth.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"my friends, I can thank you all for the aid you\nhave given us. It is to you we owe our lives, for without your aid\nI never should have succeeded.\"\n\n\"Say nothing about it, monsieur. We are happy to have saved such a\nbrave young man, and to have rescued two victims from those monsters.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is any danger of anyone here taking the news\nof our landing to the town?\" Harry asked. \"They must have seen us\ncome up to the cottage.\"\n\n\"There is no fear,\" Pierre said confidently. \"There is not a man\nor woman here who would not tear the _scelerats_ to pieces if they\nhad the chance. Have they not spoiled our market by killing all\nour best customers? And now how are we to earn our living, I should\nlike to know? Why, not even the poorest beggar in Nantes would buy\nfish out of the river for months after this. No, you need have no\nfear of them. They may guess who you are, but it is no business of\ntheirs, and they will hold their tongues.\"\n\n\"At anyrate, Pierre, you had better distribute a few crowns among\nthem, to help them live till the fishing is good again.\"\n\n\"That I will do, monsieur. It is quite safe; but it is as well to\nmake it even safer.\"\n\nIn half an hour Pierre's wife came in from the inner room, and said\nthat both girls were sound asleep.\n\n\"Now, Adolphe, it only remains for you to arrange with your captain\nfor our passage.\"\n\n\"That I will do this afternoon,\" Adolphe said confidently.  \"Consider\nit as good as done.\"\n\nAfter Adolphe had started for the town, Harry was persuaded by\nPierre to lie down for a bit; but he soon gave up the idea of going\nto sleep. His brain was in a whirl from the events of the last\ntwenty-four hours, and above all he felt so  brimming over with\nhappiness that the girls had been saved that he soon found it\nimpossible to lie still. He therefore went down again and joined\nPierre, who was doing some repairs to his boat.\n\n\"It is no use my trying to sleep, Pierre. I am too delighted that\neverything has turned out right. I want to break out into shouting\nand singing.\"\n\n\"I can understand, monsieur. Yes, yes. After great trouble great\njoy. I know it myself. I was once adrift in a boat for three weeks.\nI was on a voyage to Guadaloupe when we were blown in a hurricane\non a 'key,' as they call the low sandy islands out there. It was\nin fact no more than a sand-bank. More than half of those on board\nwere drowned; but eight of us got ashore, and we managed to haul\nup a woman with her child of two years old in her arms.\n\n\"We thought at first the mother was dead, but she came round.\nThe ship went to pieces and we saved nothing. The currents swept\neverything away but a boat, which had been thrown up beyond the reach\nof the waves. For two days we had no food or water, and suffered\nterribly, for the sun had shone down straight on our heads, and we\nenvied those who had died at once. The woman set us a good example.\nShe spent her time tending her child and praying to God; and we\nsailors, who are rough, you know--but who know that God protects\nus, and never go for a long voyage without going to the chapel and\npaying for a mass for our safety--we prayed too, and the third\nmorning there were three turtles asleep on the shore. We turned them\nover on their backs, and there was meat for us for a long time.\n\n\"We killed one and drank the blood, and ate our first meal raw.\nThen we cut up the rest of the flesh and hung it up in the sun to\ndry.  That very night we saw the clouds banking up, and knew it\nwas going to rain.\n\n\"'Now,' our mate said, 'if we had but a barrel we could catch water\nand start in our boat, but without that the water will last only a\nday or two; for if we kill all the turtles and fill their shells,\nit will evaporate in a day under this hot sun, and it may be weeks\nbefore there is rain again, and we might as well have died at once.\n\n\"'For shame,' the woman said. 'You are doubting the good God again,\nafter he has saved your life and has sent you food and is now going\nto send you water. Do you think he has done all this for nothing?\nThere must be some way out of the difficulty if we could but think\nof it.'\n\n\"She sat looking at the turtle for two or three minutes, and then\nsaid:\n\n\"'It is easy. Why have you not thought of it? See there. Cut off\none of their heads, and then you can get your arm in, if you take\nthe biggest. Then cut out all the meat and bones piece by piece,\nand there is a great bottle which will hold gallons.'\n\n\"We shouted for joy, for it was as she had said, though I am sure\nnone of us would ever have thought of it if God had not given her\nthe idea. We soon set to work and got the shell ready. The rain\nstorm came quickly. We had turned the boat over, the oars had been\nwashed away, but the mast and sail were lashed to the thwarts. We\nmade a little hollow in the sand and stretched out the sail, and by\nthe time this was done and the men were ready with the turtle-shell\nthe rain came. When it rains in those parts it comes down in\nbucketfuls, and we soon had enough in the sail to drink our fill\nand to fill up the turtle-shell to the top.\n\n\"The next morning we got the boat afloat, put the other turtle\nin, with our stock of dried flesh and our shell of water, and set\nsail.  But our luck seemed gone. We lay for days scarce moving\nthrough the water, with the sail hanging idle and the sun blazing\ndown upon us. We had not been careful enough of the water at first,\nmaking sure that in three or four days we should sight land, and\nwhen after three days we put ourselves on short rations, there was\nscarce a gallon of water left.\n\n\"It was a week after that before we saw a sail. Two of the men had\njumped overboard raving mad, the rest were lying well-nigh senseless\nin the bottom of the boat. Only the woman was sitting up, holding\nher child in her arms. She was very weak, too; but she had never\ncomplained, never doubted for a moment. Her eyes went from the\nchild's face over the sea to look for the help she felt would come,\nand back again, and at last she said quite quiet and natural:\n\n\"'There is the ship. I knew it must come to-day, for my child could\nnot live through another night.'\n\n\"We thought she was dreaming or off her head. But one of us made\na shift to stand up and look, and when he screamed out 'A sail!  A\nsail!' two of us who were strong enough looked out also. There she\nwas and sailing, as we could soon see, on a line as directly for\nus as if they had our bearings, and had been sent to fetch us.\n\n\"It was not until evening that she came up, though she was bringing\na light breeze along with her. And when we were lifted on to her\ndeck, and had water held to our lips, and knew that we were safe,\nwe felt, I expect, much the same as you do now, monsieur, that it\nwas the good God himself who had assuredly saved us from death.\nThat was my last voyage, for Henriette was waiting for me at home,\nand I had promised her that after we had gone to church together I\nwould go no more to distant countries, but would settle down here\nas a fisherman.\"\n\n\"That was a narrow escape indeed, Pierre,\" Harry said as he worked\naway with the tar brush. \"That idea of the turtle was a splendid\none, and you may well say that God put it into the woman's head,\nfor without it you could never have lived till the ship found you.\"\n\nIn the meantime Henriette had made her rounds to the cottage to see\nwhat remarks had been made as to the coming of her visitors.  She\nsaw that everyone had guessed that the girls who had been picked\nup by Pierre were victims of the massacre, but no one supposed that\nit was the result of intention.\n\n\"Ah, Mere Gounard, but your good man was fortunate to-day,\" one\nof the women said. \"My man did not go out. We heard what was doing\nat Nantes, and he had not the heart to go; besides, who would buy\nfish caught to-day? If he had thought of it he would have gone too,\nand perhaps he would have picked up somebody, as you have done.\nPoor things, what an escape for them!\"\n\n\"It is wonderful that they have come round,\" Henriette said.  \"It\nwas lucky my husband had some brandy in the boat. He thought for a\ntime he would never bring the youngest round. They are only young\ngirls. What harm could they have done that those monsters at Nantes\nshould try to murder them? There is no fear, I hope, that any in\nthe village will say a word about it.\"\n\n\"What!\" the woman said indignantly. \"Do you think that anyone\nhere would betray a comrade to the Reds? Why, we would tear him to\npieces.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Henriette said; \"I never thought for a moment that anyone\nwould do it intentionally; but the boys might let slip a word\ncarelessly which might bring them down upon us.\"\n\n\"We will take care of that,\" the woman said. \"Make your mind easy.\nNot a soul outside the village will ever know of it.\"\n\n\"And,\" Henriette added, \"one of them has some money hidden upon her,\nand she told me just before I came out, when I was saying that the\nvillage would have a bad time now the fishing was spoiled--that\nas she hoped to cross to England in a few days, and would have\nno need of the money, for it seems that she can get plenty over\nthere, she will give five crowns to each house in the village as\na thank-offering.\"\n\n\"Well, that is not to be despised,\" the woman said. \"We shall have\na hard time of it for a bit, and that will carry us on through it.\nYou are sure she can spare it; because we would rather starve than\ntake it if she cannot.\"\n\nHenriette assured her that her visitor said she could afford it\nwell.\n\n\"Well, then, it's a lucky day for the village, Mere Gounard, that\nyour husband picked them up.\"\n\n\"Well, I will go back now,\" Henriette said. \"Will you go round the\nvillage and tell the others about silencing the children? I must\nget some broth ready by the time these poor creatures wake.\"\n\nThe next morning Jeanne appeared at breakfast in her dress as\na fish-girl, but few words were spoken between her and Harry, for\nthe fisherman and his wife were present.\n\n\"How is Virginie?\" he asked.\n\n\"She's better, but she is weak and languid, so I told her she must\nstop in bed for to-day. Do not look anxious. I have no doubt that\nshe will be well enough to be up to-morrow. She has been sleeping\never since she went to bed yesterday, and when she woke she had\na basin of broth. I think by to-morrow she will be well enough to\nget up. But it will be some time before she is herself again. It\nis a terrible strain for her to have gone through, but she was very\nbrave all the time we were in prison. She had such confidence in\nyou, she felt sure that you would manage somehow to rescue us.\"\n\nAfter breakfast Jeanne strolled down with Harry to the river-side.\n\n\"I feel strange with you, Harry,\" she said. \"Before you seemed\nalmost like a brother, and now it is so different.\"\n\n\"Yes; but happier?\" Harry asked gently.\n\n\"Oh, so much happier, Harry! But there is one thing I want to tell\nyou. It might seem strange to you that I should tell you I loved you\non my own account without your speaking to the head of the family.\"\n\n\"But there was no time for that, Jeanne,\" Harry said smiling.\n\n\"No,\" Jeanne said simply. \"I suppose it would have been the same\nanyhow; but I want to tell you, Harry, that in the first letter\nwhich she sent me when she was in prison, Marie told me, that as\nshe might not see me again, she thought it right I should know that\nour father and mother had told her that night we left home that\nthey thought I cared for you. You didn't think so, did you, Harry?\"\nshe broke off with a vivid blush. \"You did not think I cared for\nyou before you cared for me?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Jeanne,\" he said earnestly. \"It never entered my mind.\nYou see, dear, up to the beginning of that time I only felt as a\nboy, and in England lads of eighteen or nineteen seldom think about\nsuch things at all. It was only afterwards, when somehow the danger\nand the anxiety seemed to make a man of me, when I saw how brave\nand thoughtful and unselfish you were, that I knew I loved you, and\nfelt that if you could some day love me, I should be the happiest\nfellow alive. Before that I thought of you as a dear little girl\nwho inclined to make rather too much of me because of that dog\nbusiness.  And did you really care for me then?\"\n\n\"I never thought of it in that way, Harry, any more than you did,\nbut I know now that my mother was right, and that I loved you all\nalong without knowing it. My dear father and mother told Marie\nthat they thought I was fond of you, and that, if at any time you\nshould get fond of me too and ask for my hand, they gave their\napproval beforehand, for they were sure that you would make me\nhappy.\n\n\"So they told Marie and Ernest, who, if ill came to them, would be\nthe heads of the family, that I had their consent to marry you. It\nmakes me happy to know this, Harry.\"\n\n\"I am very glad, too, dear,\" Harry said earnestly.\n\n\"It is very satisfactory for you, and it is very pleasant to me to\nknow that they were ready to trust you to me. Ah!\" he said suddenly,\n\"that was what was in the letter. I wondered a little at the time,\nfor somehow after that, Jeanne, you were a little different with\nme. I thought at first I might somehow have offended you. But I did\nnot think that long,\" he went on, as Jeanne  uttered an indignant\nexclamation, \"because if anything offended you, you always spoke\nout frankly. Still I wondered over it for some time, and certainly\nI was never near guessing the truth.\"\n\n\"I could not help being a little different,\" Jeanne said shyly. \"I\nhad never thought of it before, and though I am sure it made me\nhappy, I could not feel quite the same with you, especially as I\nknew that you never thought of me like that.\"\n\n\"But you thought of me so afterwards, Jeanne?\"\n\n\"Sometimes just for a moment, but I tried not to think of it,\nHarry. We were so strangely placed, and it made it easier for you\nto be a brother, and I felt sure you would not speak till we were\nsafely in England, and I was in Ernest's care. But,\" she said\nwith a little laugh, \"you were nearly speaking that evening in the\ncottage when you felt so despairing.\"\n\n\"Very nearly, Jeanne; I did so want comfort.\"\n\nAnd so they talked happily together for an hour.\n\n\"I wonder Pierre does not come down to his boat,\" Harry said at\nlast. \"There were several more things wanting doing to it. Why,\nthere he is calling. Surely it can never be dinner-time; but that's\nwhat he says. It doesn't seem an hour since breakfast.\"\n\nJeanne hurried on into the hut.\n\n\"Why, Pierre,\" Harry said to the fisherman, who was waiting outside\nfor him, \"I thought you were going on with your boat.\"\n\n\"So I was, monsieur, but Henriette told me I should be in the way.\"\n\n\"In the way, Pierre!\" Harry repeated in surprise.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" Pierre said with a twinkle in his eye, \"you have\nbeen deceiving us. My wife saw it in a moment when the young lady\ncame to breakfast.\n\n\"'Brother!' she said to me when you went out; 'don't tell me!\nMonsieur is the young lady's lover. Brother and sister don't look\nat each other like that. Why, one could see it with half an eye.'\n\n\"Your wife is right, Pierre; mademoiselle is my fiance. I am really\nan Englishman. She and her sister had their old nurse with them,\ntill the latter died some three weeks since; but I have always been\ncalled their brother, because it made it easier for her.\"\n\n\"Quite right, monsieur; but my wife and I are glad to see that it\nis otherwise, and that, after all you have risked for that pretty\ncreature, you are going to be happy together. My wife was not\nsurprised.  Women are sharper than men in these matters, and she\nsaid to me, when she heard what you were going to do to save them,\n'I would wager, Pierre, that one of these mesdemoiselles is not\nmonsieur's sister.  Men will do a great deal for their sister, but\nI never heard of a man throwing away his life as he is going to do\non the mere chance of saving one.'\"\n\n\"I should have done just the same had it been one of my sisters,\"\nHarry said a little indignantly.\n\n\"Perhaps you would, monsieur, I do not say no,\" the fisherman said,\nshaking his head; \"but brothers do not often do so.\"\n\nA stop was put to the conversation by Henriette putting her head\noutside the door and demanding angrily what they were stopping\ntalking there for when the fish was getting cold.\n\nIn the evening Adolphe and his wife came in.\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle,\" the woman said as she embraced Jeanne with tears\nin her eyes, \"how thankful I am to see you again! I never thought\nI should do so. My heart almost stopped beating yesterday when\nI heard the guns. I and my little one were on our knees praying\nto the good God for the dear lady who had saved her life. Adolphe\nhad spoken hopefully, but it hardly seemed to me that it could be,\nand when he brought back the news that he had left you all safely\nhere, I could hardly believe it was true.\"\n\n\"And I must thank you also, mademoiselle,\" Adolphe said, \"for saving\nthe life of my little one. I never expected to see her alive again,\nand when the lugger made fast to the wharf I was afraid to go home,\nand I hung about till Marthe had heard we were in and came down\nto me with Julie in her arms, looking almost herself again. Ah,\nmademoiselle, you cannot tell how glad I was when she told me that\nthere was a way of paying some part of my debt to you.\"\n\n\"You have been able to pay more than your debt,\" Jeanne said gently;\n\"if I saved one life you have helped to save three.\"\n\n\"No, we shall be only quits, mademoiselle, for what would Marthe's\nlife and mine be worth if the child had died?\n\n\"There are fresh notices stuck up,\" he went on, \"warning all\nmasters of ships, fishermen, and others, against taking passengers\non board, and saying that the penalty of assisting the enemies of\nFrance to escape from justice is death.\"\n\n\"That is rather serious,\" Harry said.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" Adolphe replied confidently. \"After yesterday's\nwork there is not a sailor or fisherman in the port but would do all\nhe could to help people to escape from the hands of the butchers,\nand once on board, it will help you. You may be sure the sailors\nwill do their best to run away if they can, or to hide any on\nboard, should they be overhauled, now they know that they will be\nguillotined if anyone is found. However, our captain has made the\nagreement, and he is a man of his word; besides, he hates the Reds.\nI have been helping ship the casks to-day, and we have stowed them\nso as to leave space into which your sisters can crawl and the\nentrance be stopped up with casks, if we should be overhauled. As\nfor you, monsieur, you will pass anywhere as one of the crew, and\nwe have arranged that one of the men shall at the last moment stay\nbehind, so that the number will be right, and you will answer to\nhis name. We have thought matters over, you see, and I can tell\nyou that the captain does it more because he hates the Reds than\nfor the money. The day before, he would give me no answer. He said\nhe thought the risk was too great; but when I saw him last night he\nwas a different man altogether. His face was as white as a sheet,\nand his eyes seemed on fire, and he said, 'I will take your friends,\nAdolphe. I would take them without a penny. I should never sleep\nagain if, owing to me, they fell into the hands of these monsters.'\nSo you see he is in it heart and soul.\"\n\nAfter half an hour's talk Adolphe and Marthe took their leave.  Both\nrefused the reward which Harry had promised, but Harry insisted,\nand at last Jeanne said:\n\n\"You can refuse for yourselves, but you will make me unhappy if\nyou do not take it. Put it by for Julie; it will help swell her dot\nwhen she marries, and will set her husband up in a good fishing-boat\nif she takes to a sailor.\"\n\nSo it was arranged, and Adolphe and his wife went off invoking\nblessings on the heads of the fugitives. At daybreak the party took\ntheir places in the boat with the fishermen. Virginie was still\nweak, but was able to walk with Harry's help.  Half an hour later\na lugger was seen coming down with the wind and tide. She carried\na small white flag flying on the mizzen.\n\n\"That is her,\" the fisherman said; \"that is the signal.\"\n\nHe rowed out into the middle of the river. In a few minutes the\nlugger came dashing along, her course took her within a few feet\nof the boat, a rope was thrown, and in an instant the boat was\ntearing through the water alongside her. Half a dozen hands were\nstretched out, the girls and Harry sprang on board, the rope was\ncast off, and the fisherman, with a cheery \"God speed you,\" put\nout his oars again and rowed to shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nEngland\n\n\n\"Go below, mesdemoiselles,\" the captain of the lugger said as soon\nas they had put foot on the deck. \"If anyone on the shore were to\nsee us as we ran down, and notice women on deck, he would think it\nstrange. At anyrate it's best to be on the safe side.\"\n\nSo saying he led the way to his cabin below.\n\n\"It is a rough place, mesdemoiselles,\" he said, removing his cap,\n\"but it is better than the prisons at Nantes. I am sorry to say\nthat when we get down near the forts I shall have to ask you to\nhide down below the casks. I heard last night that in future every\nboat going out of the river, even if it is only a fishing-boat,\nis to be searched. But you needn't be afraid; we have constructed\na hiding-place, where they will never find you unless they unloaded\nthe whole lugger, and that there is no chance of their doing.\"\n\n\"We do not mind where we hide, captain,\" Jeanne said. \"We have been\nhiding for the last six months, and we are indeed grateful to you\nfor having consented to take us with you.\"\n\n\"I hope that you will not be the last that the Trois Freres will\ncarry across,\" the captain said. \"Whatever be the risk, in future\nI will take any fugitives who wish to escape to England. At first\nI was against the government, for I thought the people were taxed\ntoo heavily, and that if we did away with the nobles things would\nbe better for those who work for their living, but I never bargained\nfor bloodshed and murder, and that affair I saw yesterday has\nsickened me altogether; and fond as I am of the Trois Freres, I\nwould myself bore holes in her and sink her if I had Carrier and\nthe whole of his murderous gang securely fastened below hatches.\nThis cabin is at your disposal, mesdemoiselles, during the voyage,\nand I trust you will make yourselves as comfortable as  you can.\nAh, here is the boy with coffee. Now, if you will permit me, I will\ngo on deck and look after her course.\"\n\nIn the meantime Harry was chatting with Adolphe, who introduced\nhim to the crew, whom he had already told of the services Jeanne\nhad rendered, and as several of them lived in the same street they\ntoo had heard from their wives of the young woman who lodged with\nMere Leflo, and had done so much for those who were suffering.  He\nwas therefore cordially received by the sailors, to each of whom\nthe captain had already promised double pay for the voyage if they\ngot through safely.\n\n\"You will remember,\" Adolphe said, \"that you are Andre Leboeuf.\nAndre had to make a cold swim of it this morning, for there was the\ncommissary on the wharf when we started, and he had the captain's\nlist of the crew, and saw that each man was on board and searched\nhigh and low to see that there was no one else. So Andre, instead\nof slipping off home again, had to go with us. When we were out of\nsight of the town the captain steered as near the bank as he could\nand Andre jumped over and swam ashore. It is all the better as it\nhas turned out, because the commissary signed the list of the crew\nand put a seal to it.\"\n\nIn four hours the Trois Freres was approaching the forts at the\nmouth of the river, and the captain came down to the cabin, in\nwhich Harry was chatting with the two girls.\n\n\"Now, mesdemoiselles,\" he said, \"it is time for you to go to your\nhiding-place, for it will take us nearly half an hour to close it\nup again. As soon as the Reds have left us we will let you out.\"\n\nThe hatch was lifted and they descended into the hold of the\nvessel, which was full of kegs to within three feet of the deck.\nThe captain carried a lantern.\n\n\"Please follow me, mesdemoiselles, you must crawl along here.\"\n\nThe girls followed him until they were close to the bulkhead dividing\nthe hold from the forecastle. Two feet from this there was a vacant\nspace.\n\n\"Now, mesdemoiselles, if you will give me your hands I will lower\nyou down here. Do not be afraid--your feet will touch the bottom;\nand I have had some hay put there for you to sit upon.  Adolphe,\nyou had better go down first with that lantern of yours to receive\nthem.\"\n\nThe girls were lowered down and found themselves in a space of five\nfeet long and two feet wide. One side was formed by the bulkhead,\non the other there were kegs. Four feet from the bottom a beam of\nwood had been nailed against the bulkhead. The captain now handed\ndown to Adolphe some short beams; these he fixed with one end\nresting on the beam, the other in a space between the kegs.\n\n\"This is to form the roof, mesdemoiselles,\" he said. \"I am going\nup now, and then we shall place three tiers of kegs on these beams,\nwhich will fill it up level with the rest above. I think you will\nhave plenty of air, for it can get down between the casks, and the\ncaptain will leave the hatchway open. Are you comfortable?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Jeanne said firmly, but Virginie did not answer; the\nthought of being shut up down there in the dark was terrible to\nher.  However, the warm, steady pressure of Jeanne's hand reassured\nher, and she kept her fears to herself. The kegs were lowered into\ntheir places, and all was made smooth just as one of the men called\ndown the hatchway to the captain:\n\n\"There is a gunboat coming out from the port, captain.\"\n\nAfter a last look round the captain sprang on to the deck and\nordered the sails to be lowered, and in a few minutes the gunboat\nran alongside.\n\n\"Show me your papers,\" an officer said as he leaped on board followed\nby half a dozen sailors. The captain went down into his cabin and\nbrought up the papers.\n\n\"That is all right,\" the officer said glancing at them; \"now, where\nis the list of your crew?\"\n\n\"This is it,\" the captain said taking it from his pocket; \"a\ncommissary at Nantes went through them on starting and placed his\nseal to it, as you see.\"\n\n\"Form the men up, and let them answer to their names,\" the officer\nsaid. The men formed in line and the officer read out the names;\nHarry answering for Andre Leboeuf. \"That is all right, so far,\"\nthe officer said. \"Now, sir, I must, according to my orders, search\nyour vessel to see that no one is concealed there.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" the captain said, \"you will find the Trois Freres\ncarries nothing contraband except her cargo. I have already taken\noff the hatch, as you see, in order to save time.\"\n\nThe forecastles and cabin were first searched closely. Several of\nthe sailors then descended into the hold. Two lanterns were handed\ndown to them.\n\n\"It looks all clear, sir,\" one of the sailors said to their officer.\nThe latter leaped down on to the kegs and looked round.\n\n\"Yes, it looks all right, but you had better shift some of the kegs\nand see that all is solid.\"\n\nSome of the kegs were moved from their position, and in a few places\nsome of the second tier were also lifted.  The officer himself\nsuperintended the search.\n\n\"I think I can let you go on now, Captain Grignaud,\" he said.\n\"Your men can stow the cargo again. A good voyage to you, and may\nyou meet with no English cruisers by the way.\"\n\nThe captain at once gave orders for the sails to be run up again,\nand by the time the officer and his men had climbed over the bulwarks\ninto the gunboat the Trois Freres had already way upon her. The\ncaptain then gave the order for the men to go below and stow the\ncasks again. Adolphe and Harry were the first to leap down, and\nbefore the vessels were two hundred yards apart they had removed\nthe two uppermost tiers of kegs next to the bulkhead, and were able\nto speak to the girls.\n\n\"Are you all right down there, Jeanne?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Yes, quite right, Harry, though the air is rather close. Virginie\nhas fainted; she was frightened when she heard them moving the\nkegs just over our heads; but she will come round as soon as you\nget her on deck.\"\n\nThe last tier was removed, and Harry lowered himself into the hold;\nhe and Jeanne raised Virginie until Adolphe and one of the other\nsailors could reach her. Jeanne was lifted on to the cross beams,\nand was soon beside her sister, and Harry quickly clambered up.\n\n\"They must not come on deck yet,\" the captain said, speaking down\nthe hatchway. \"We are too close to the gunboat, and from the forts\nwith their glasses they can see what is passing on our deck. Don't\nreplace the kegs over the hole again, Adolphe; we may be overhauled\nagain, and had better leave it open in case of emergencies.\"\n\nVirginie was carried under the open hatchway; some water was handed\ndown to Jeanne, who sprinkled it on her face, and this with the\nfresh air speedily brought her round. When the lugger was a mile\nbelow the forts, the captain said that they could now safely come\nup, and they were soon in possession of the cabin again. Before\nevening the lugger was out of sight of land. The wind was blowing\nfreshly, and she raced along leaving a broad track of foam behind\nher. The captain and crew were in high spirits at having succeeded\nin carrying off the fugitives from under the noses of their enemies,\nand at the progress the lugger was making.\n\n\"We shall not be far from the coast of England by to-morrow night,\"\nthe captain said to Harry, \"that is if we have the luck to avoid\nmeeting any of the English cruisers. We don't care much for the\nrevenue cutters, for there is not one of them that can overhaul\nthe Trois Freres in a wind like this. They have all had more than\none try, but we can laugh at them; but it would be a different\nthing if we fell in with one of the Channel cruisers; in a light\nwind we could keep away from them too, but with a brisk wind like\nthis we should have no chance with them; they carry too much sail\nfor us. There is the boy carrying in the supper to your sisters;\nwith their permission, you and I will sup with them.\"\n\nThe captain sent in a polite message to the girls, and on the\nreceipt of the answer that they would be very pleased to have the\ncaptain's company, he and Harry went down. The meal was an excellent\none, but the girls ate but little, for they were both beginning to\nfeel the effects of the motion of the vessel, for they had, when\nonce fairly at sea, kept on deck. The captain perceiving that they\nate but little proposed to Harry that coffee should be served on\ndeck, so that the ladies might at once lie down for the night.\n\n\"Now, captain,\" Harry said as the skipper lit his pipe, \"I daresay\nyou would like to hear how we came to be fugitives on board your\nship.\"\n\n\"If you have no obligation to tell me, I should indeed,\" the captain\nreplied; \"I have been wondering all day how you young people escaped\nthe search for suspects so long, and how you came to be at Nantes,\nwhere, as Adolphe tells me, your sister was an angel among the poor,\nand that you yourself were a member of the Revolutionary Committee;\nthat seemed to me the most extraordinary of all, but I wouldn't\nask any questions until you yourself volunteered to enlighten me.\"\n\nHarry thereupon related the whole story of their adventures,\nconcealing only the fact that the girls were not his sisters; as\nit was less awkward for Jeanne that this relationship should be\nsupposed to exist.\n\n\"Sapriste, your adventures have been marvellous, monsieur, and I\ncongratulate you heartily. You have a rare head and courage, and\nyet you cannot be above twenty.\"\n\n\"I am just nineteen,\" Harry replied.\n\n\"Just nineteen, and you succeeded in getting your friend safely\nout of that mob of scoundrels in the Abbaye, got your elder sister\nout of La Force, you fooled Robespierre and the Revolutionists\nin Nantes, and you carried those two girls safely through France,\nrescued them from the white lugger, and got them on board the Trois\nFreres! It sounds like a miracle.\"\n\n\"The getting them on board the Trois Freres was, you must remember,\nmy sister's work. I had failed and was in despair. Suspicions were\nalready aroused, and we should assuredly have been arrested if it\nhad not been that she had won the heart of Adolphe's wife by nursing\nher child in its illness.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" the captain agreed; \"and they must have good courage\ntoo that they didn't betray themselves all that time. And now I\ntell you what I will do, monsieur. If you will write a letter to\nyour sister in Paris, saying that you and the other two have reached\nEngland in safety, I will when I return send it by sure hand to\nParis.  To make all safe you had better send it to the people she\nis staying with, and word it so that no one will understand it if\nthey were to read it. Say, for example:\n\n\"'My dear Sister,  You will be glad to hear that the consignment of\nlace has been safely landed in England,' Then you can go on saying\nthat 'your mother is better, and that you expect to be married\nsoon, as you have made a good profit out of the lace,' and so on;\nand just sign your name--'Your brother Henri.'\n\n\"I can trust the man who will deliver it in Paris, but it is just\nas well always to be on the safe side. If your letter is opened and\nread, anyone will suppose that it is written by a sailor belonging\nto one of the Nantes luggers.\"\n\nHarry thanked the captain warmly for the offer, and said that the\nletter would indeed be an immense comfort to his sister and friend.\n\n\"I will tell the man that he is to ask if there is any answer,\" the\ncaptain said. \"And if your sister is as sharp as you are she will\nwrite the same sort of letter, and I will bring it across with me\nto England the first voyage I make after I get it.\"\n\nHarry slept down in the forecastle with the crew, the captain\nkeeping on deck all night. He was awoke by an order shouted down\nthe forecastle for all hands to come on deck; and hurrying up with\nthe rest found that the sun had just risen. The day was beautifully\nfine, and to Harry's surprise he found that those on deck had\nalready lowered the great lugsails.\n\n\"What is it, captain?\" he asked.\n\n\"There is a sail there I don't like,\" the captain said. \"If I am\nnot mistaken that is an English frigate.\"\n\nThere were several sails in sight, but the one to which the captain\npointed was crossing ahead of the lugger. Her hull could not be\nseen, and indeed from the deck only her topsails and royals were\nvisible above the water.\n\n\"I hope she will not see us,\" the captain said. \"We are low in the\nwater, and these stump masts could not be seen at that distance\neven by a look-out at the mast-head.\n\n\"We are already somewhat astern of her, and every minute will take\nher further away. If she does not see us in a quarter of an hour,\nwe shall be safe. If she does, there is nothing for it but to run\nback towards the French coast. We should have such a long start\nthat with this wind she would never catch us. But she may fire her\nguns and bring another cruiser down upon us and cut us off. There\nare a dozen of them watching on different parts of the coast.\"\n\nHarry kept his eye anxiously upon the ship, but she sailed steadily\non; and in half an hour the sails were again hoisted and the Trois\nFreres proceeded on her way. She passed comparatively near several\nmerchantmen, but these paid no attention to her. She was too small\nfor a privateer, and her object and destination were easily guessed\nat. The girls soon came on deck, and the captain had some cushions\nplaced for them under shelter of the bulwark; for although the sun\nwas shining brightly the wind was keen and piercing.\n\n\"Are we beyond danger?\" was Virginie's first question as Harry took\nhis seat by her.\n\n\"Beyond all danger of being overtaken--that is to say, beyond all\ndanger of meeting a French vessel-of-war. They very seldom venture\nto show themselves many miles from port, except, of course, as a\nfleet; for single vessels would soon get picked up by our cruisers.\nYes, I think we are quite out of danger. There is only one chance\nagainst us.\"\n\n\"And what is that, Harry?\" Jeanne asked.\n\n\"It is not a serious one,\" Harry replied; \"it is only that we may\nbe chased by English revenue cutters and forced to run off from the\nEnglish coast again. But even then we should soon return. Besides,\nI have no doubt the captain would let us have a boat, so that we\ncould be picked up by the cutter in pursuit of us.\"\n\n\"I don't think that would be a good plan,\" Jeanne said; \"because\nthey might not stop to pick us up, and then we might have a long\nway to reach the shore. No, I think it will be better to stay on\nboard, Harry; for, as you say, if she does have to run away for a\ntime, she is sure to come back again to unload her cargo. But of\ncourse do whatever you think best.\"\n\n\"I think your view is the best, Jeanne. However, I hope the\nopportunity will not occur, and that the Trois Freres will run her\ncargo without interference. The captain tells me he is making for\na point on the Dorsetshire coast, and that he is expected. Of course\nhe could not say the exact day he would be here. But he told them\nthe day on which, if he could get his cargo on board, he should\nsail, and they will be looking out for him.\"\n\nBefore sunset the English coast was visible.\n\n\"We could not have timed it better,\" the captain said. \"It will be\ngetting dark before they can make us out even from the cliffs.\"\n\nEvery sail was now scrutinized by the captain through his glass,\nbut he saw nothing that looked suspicious. At nine o'clock in the\nevening the lugger was within three miles of the coast.\n\n\"Get ready the signal lanterns,\" the captain ordered. And a few\nminutes later three lanterns were hoisted, one above the other.\nAlmost immediately two lights were shown in a line on top of the\ncliff.\n\n\"There is our answer,\" the captain said. \"There is nothing to be\ndone to-night. That means 'The revenue men are on the look-out;\ncome back to-morrow night.\"'\n\n\"But they are always on the look-out, are they not?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" the captain said; \"but when our friends on shore know we are\ncoming they try to throw them off the scent. It will be whispered\nabout to-morrow that a run is likely to be made ten miles along\nthe coast, and they will take care that this comes to the ears of\nthe revenue officer. Then to-morrow evening after dusk a fishing-boat\nwill go out and show some lights  two miles off shore at the point\nnamed, and a rocket will be sent up from the cliff. That will\nconvince them that the news is true, and the revenue officers will\nhurry away in that direction with every man they can get together.\nThen we shall run here and land our cargo. There will be plenty of\ncarts waiting for us, and before the revenue men are back the kegs\nwill be stowed safely away miles inland. Of course things go wrong\nsometimes and the revenue officers are not to be fooled, but in\nnine cases out of ten we manage to run our cargoes without a shot\nbeing fired. Now I must get off shore again.\"\n\nThe orders were given, and the Trois Freres was soon running out\nto sea. They stood far out and then lowered the sails and drifted\nuntil late in the afternoon, when they again made sail for the\nland.  At ten o'clock the signal lights were again exhibited, and\nthis time the answer was made by one light low down by the water's\nedge.\n\n\"The coast is clear,\" the captain said, rubbing his hands. \"We'll\ntake her in as close as she will go, the less distance there is to\nrow the better.\"\n\nThe Trois Freres was run on until within a hundred yards of the\nshore, then a light anchor was dropped. The two boats had already\nbeen lowered and were towed alongside, and the work of transferring\nthe cargo at once began.\n\n\"Do you go in the first boat, monsieur, with the ladies,\" the\ncaptain said. \"The sooner you are ashore the better. There is no\nsaying whether we may not be disturbed and obliged to run out to\nsea again at a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" he exclaimed, as after wading through the shallow\nwater he stood on the shore, while two of the sailors carried the\ngirls and put them beside him. \"Thank God, I have got you safe on\nEnglish soil at last. I began to despair at one time.\"\n\n\"Thank God indeed,\" Jeanne said reverently; \"but I never quite\ndespaired, Harry. It seemed to me He had protected us through so\nmany dangers, that He must mean that we should go safely through\nthem all, and yet it did seem hopeless at one time.\"\n\n\"We had better stand on one side, girls, or rather we had better\npush on up the cliff. These people are all too busy to notice us,\nand you might get knocked down; besides, the coastguard might arrive\nat any moment, and then there would be a fight. So let us get well\naway from them.\"\n\nBut they had difficulty in making their way up the cliff, for the\npath was filled with men carrying up tubs or coming down for more\nafter placing them in the carts, which were waiting to convey them\ninland. At last they got to the top. One of the carts was already\nladen, and was on the point of driving off when Harry asked the man\nif he could tell him of any farmhouse near, where the two ladies\nwho had landed with him could pass the night.\n\n\"Master's place is two miles away,\" the man said; \"but if you like\nto walk as far, he will take you in, I doubt not.\"\n\nThe girls at once agreed to the proposal, and in three quarters of\nan hour the cart drew up at a farmhouse.\n\n\"Is it all right, Bill?\" a man asked, opening the door as the cart\nstopped.\n\n\"Yes, it be all right. Not one of them revenue chaps nigh the place.\nHere be the load of tubs; they was the first that came ashore.\"\n\n\"Who have you got here?\" the farmer asked as Harry came forward\nwith the girls.\n\n\"These are two young ladies who have crossed in the lugger,\" Harry\nreplied. \"They have narrowly escaped being murdered in France by\nthe Revolutionists, and have gone through a terrible time. As they\nhave nowhere to go to-night, I thought perhaps you would kindly\nlet them sit by your fire till morning.\"\n\n\"Surely I will,\" the farmer said. \"Get ye in, get ye in. Mistress,\nhere are two young French ladies who have escaped from those\nbloody-minded scoundrels in Paris. I  needn't tell you to do what\nyou can for them.\"\n\nThe farmer's wife at once came forward and received the girls most\nkindly. They had both picked up a little English during Harry's\nresidence at the chateau, and feeling they were in good hands, Harry\nagain went out and lent his assistance to the farmer in carrying\nthe tubs down to a place of concealment made under the flooring of\none of the barns.\n\nThe next day the farmer drove them in his gig to a town some miles\ninland. Here they procured dresses in which they could travel without\nexciting attention, and took their places in the coach which passed\nthrough the town for London next day.\n\nThat evening Harry gently broke to the girls the news of their\nbrothers' death, for he thought that it would otherwise come as a\nterrible shock to them on their arrival at his home. Virginie was\nterribly upset, and Jeanne cried for some time, then she said:\n\n\"Your news does not surprise me, Harry. I have had a feeling all\nalong that you knew something, but were keeping it from me.  You\nspoke so very seldom of them, and when you did it seemed to me that\nwhat you said was not spoken in your natural voice. I felt sure\nthat had you known nothing you would have often talked to us of\nmeeting them in London, and of the happiness it would be. I would\nnot ask, because I was sure you had a good reason for not telling\nus; but I was quite sure that there was something.\"\n\n\"I thought it better to keep it from you, Jeanne, until the danger\nwas all over. In the first place you had need of all your courage\nand strength; in the next place it was possible that you might never\nreach England, and in that case you would never have suffered the\npain of knowing anything about it.\"\n\n\"How thoughtful you are, Harry!\" Jeanne murmured. \"Oh how much\nwe owe you! But oh how strange and lonely we seem--everyone gone\nexcept Marie, and we may never see her again!\"\n\n\"You will see her again, never fear,\" Harry said confidently. \"And\nyou will not feel lonely long, for I can promise you that before\nyou have been long at my mother's place you will feel like one of\nthe family.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I shall not be one of the family,\" Jeanne said.\n\n\"Not yet, Jeanne. But mother will look upon you as her daughter\ndirectly I tell her that you have promised to become so in reality\nsome day.\"\n\nHarry's reception, when with the two girls he drove up in a hackney\ncoach to the house at Cheyne Walk, was overwhelming, and the two\nFrench girls were at first almost bewildered by the rush of boys\nand girls who tore down the steps and threw themselves upon Harry's\nneck.\n\n\"You will stifle me between you all,\" Harry said, after he had\nresponded to the embraces. \"Where are father and mother?\"\n\n\"Father is out, and mother is in the garden. No, there she is\"--as\nMrs. Sandwith, pale and agitated, appeared at the door, having\nhurried in when one of the young ones had shouted out from a back\nwindow: \"Harry has come!\"\n\n\"Oh, my boy, we had given you up,\" she sobbed as Harry rushed into\nher arms.\n\n\"I am worth a great many dead men yet, mother. But now let me\nintroduce to you Mesdemoiselles Jeanne and Virginie de St. Caux,\nof whom I have written to you so often. They are orphans, mother,\nand I have promised them that you and father will fill the place\nof their parents.\"\n\n\"That will we willingly,\" Mrs. Sandwith said, turning to the girls\nand kissing them with motherly kindness. \"Come in, my dears, and\nwelcome home for the sake of my dear boy, and for that of your\nparents who were so kind to him. Never mind all these wild young\npeople,\" she added, as the boys and girls pressed round to shake\nhands with the new-comers. \"You will get accustomed to their way\npresently.  Do you speak in English?\"\n\n\"Enough to understand,\" Jeanne said; \"but not enough to speak much.\nThank you, madame, for receiving us so kindly, for we are all alone\nin the world.\"\n\nMrs. Sandwith saw the girl's lip quiver, and putting aside her\nlonging to talk to her son, said:\n\n\"Harry, do take them all out in the garden for a short time.  They\nare all talking at once, and this is a perfect babel.\"\n\nAnd thus having cleared the room she sat down to talk to the two\ngirls, and soon made them feel at home with her by her unaffected\nkindness. Dr. Sandwith soon afterwards ran out to the excited\nchattering group in the garden, and after a few minutes' happy talk\nwith him, Harry spoke to him of the visitors who were closeted with\nhis mother.\n\n\"I want you to make them feel it is their home, father. They will\nbe no burden pecuniarily, for there are money and jewels worth a\nlarge sum over here.\"\n\n\"Of course I know that,\" Dr. Sandwith said, \"seeing that, as you\nknow, they were consigned to me, and the marquis wrote to ask me\nto act as his agent. The money is invested in stock, and the jewels\nare in the hands of my bankers. I had begun to wonder what would\nbecome of it all, for I was by no means sure that the whole family\nhad not perished, as well as yourself.\"\n\n\"There are only the three girls left,\" Harry said.\n\n\"In that case they will be well off, for the marquis inclosed me a\nwill, saying that if anything should happen to him, and the estates\nshould be altogether lost, the money and proceeds of the jewels\nwere to be divided equally among his children. You must have gone\nthrough a great deal, old boy. You are scarcely nineteen, and you\nlook two or three and twenty.\"\n\n\"I shall soon look young again, father, now I have got my mind\nclear of anxiety. But I have had a trying time of it, I can tell\nyou; but it's too long a story to go into now, I will tell you all\nthe whole yarn this evening. I want you to go in with me now to\nthe girls and make them at home. All this must be just as trying\nfor them at present as the dangers they have gone through.\"\n\nThe young ones were all forbidden to follow, and after an hour\nspent with his parents and the girls in the dining-room, Harry\nwas pleased to see that the latter were beginning to feel at their\nease, and that the strangeness was wearing off.\n\nThat evening, before the whole circle of his family, Harry related\nthe adventures that they had gone through, subject, however, to a\ngreat many interruptions from Jeanne.\n\n\"But I am telling the story, not you, Jeanne,\" he said at last.\n\"Some day when you begin to talk English quite well you shall give\nyour version of it.\"\n\n\"But he is not telling it right, madame,\" Jeanne protested, \"he\nkeeps all the best part back. He says about the dangers, but he says\nnoting about what he do himself.\" Then she broke into French, \"No,\nmadame, it is not just, it is not right; I will not suffer the tale\nto be told so. How can it be the true story when he says no word\nof his courage, of his devotion, of the way he watched over us and\ncheered us, no word of his grand heart, of the noble way he risked\nhis life for us, for our sister, for our parents, for all? Oh,\nmadame, I cannot tell you what we all owe to him;\" and Jeanne, who\nhad risen to her feet in her earnestness, burst into passionate\ntears. This put an end to the story for the evening, for Mrs.\nSandwith saw that Jeanne required rest and quiet, and took the two\ngirls up at once to the bed-room prepared for them. From this\nJeanne did not descend for some days. As long as the strain was\nupon her she had borne herself bravely, but now that it was over\nshe collapsed completely.\n\nAfter the young ones had all gone off to bed, Harry said to his\nfather and mother:\n\n\"I have another piece of news to tell you now. I am afraid you will\nthink it rather absurd at my age, without a profession or anything\nelse, but I am engaged to Jeanne. You see,\" he went on, as his\nparents both uttered an exclamation of surprise, \"we have gone\nthrough a tremendous lot together, and when people have to look\ndeath in the face every day it makes them older than they are; and\nwhen, as in this case, they have to depend entirely on themselves,\nit brings them very closely together. I think it might have been\nso had these troubles never come on, for somehow we had taken very\nmuch to each other, though it might have been years before anything\ncame of it. Her poor father and mother saw it before I  knew\nit myself, and upon the night before they were separated told her\nelder sister and brother that, should I ever ask for Jeanne's hand,\nthey approved of her marrying me. But although afterwards I came\nto love her with all my heart, I should never have spoken had it\nnot been that I did so when it seemed that in five minutes we should\nneither of us be alive. If it hadn't been for that I should have\nbrought her home and waited till I was making my own way in life.\"\n\n\"I do not blame you, Harry, my boy,\" his father said heartily.  \"Of\ncourse you are very young, and under ordinary circumstances would\nnot have been thinking about a wife for years to come yet; but I\ncan see that your Jeanne is a girl of no ordinary character, and it\nis certainly for her happiness that, being here with her sister alone\namong strangers, she should feel that she is at home. Personally she\nis charming, and even in point of fortune you would be considered\na lucky fellow. What do you say, mother?\"\n\n\"I say God bless them both!\" Mrs. Sandwith said earnestly.  \"After\nthe way in which Providence has brought them together, there can\nbe no doubt that they were meant for each other.\"\n\n\"Do you know I half guessed there was something more than mere\ngratitude in Jeanne's heart when she flamed out just now; did not\nyou, mother?\"\n\nMrs. Sandwith nodded and smiled. \"I was sure there was,\" she said.\n\n\"I did not say anything about it when we came in,\" Harry said,\n\"because I thought it better for Jeanne to have one quiet day, and\nyou know the young ones will laugh awfully at the idea of my being\nengaged.\"\n\n\"Never you mind, Harry,\" his father said; \"let those laugh that\nwin. But you are not thinking of getting married yet, I hope.\"\n\n\"No, no, father; you cannot think I would live on Jeanne's money.\"\n\n\"And you still intend to go into the army, Harry?\"\n\n\"No, father; I have had enough of bloodshed for the rest of my life.\nI have been thinking it over a good deal, and I have determined to\nfollow your example and become a doctor.\"\n\n\"That's right, my boy,\" Dr. Sandwith said heartily. \"I have always\nregretted you had a fancy for the army, for I used to look forward\nto your becoming my right hand. Your brothers, too, do not take to\nthe profession, so I began to think I was going to be alone in my\nold age.  You have made me very happy, Harry, and your mother too,\nI am sure. It will be delightful for us having you and your pretty\nFrench wife settled by us; will it not, mother?\"\n\n\"It will indeed,\" Mrs. Sandwith said in a tone of deep happiness.\n\"You are certainly overworked and need a partner terribly, and who\ncould be like Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been thinking of taking a partner for some time, but\nnow I will hold on alone for another three years. By that time\nHarry will have passed.\"\n\nThe next morning the young ones were told the news. The elder girls\nwere delighted at the thought of Jeanne becoming their sister, but\nthe boys went into fits of laughter and chaffed Harry so unmercifully\nfor the next day or two that it was just as well that Jeanne was\nup in her room. By the time she came down they had recovered their\ngravity. Mrs. Sandwith and the girls had already given her the\nwarmest welcome as Harry's future wife, and the boys received her\nso warmly when she appeared that Jeanne soon felt that she was\nindeed one of the family.\n\nThree years later, on the day after Harry passed his final examination,\nJeanne and he were married, and set up a pretty establishment\nclose to Cheyne Walk, with Virginie to live with them; and Harry,\nat first as his father's assistant, and very soon as his partner,\nhad the satisfaction of feeling that he was not wholly dependent\non Jeanne's fortune.\n\nThey had received occasional news from Marie. Victor had steadily\nrecovered his strength and memory, and as soon as the reign of terror\nhad come to an end, and the priests were able to show themselves\nfrom their hiding-places in many an out-of-the-way village in the\ncountry, Marie and Victor were quietly married. But France was at\nwar with all Europe now, and Victor, though he hated the revolution,\nwas a thorough Frenchman, and through some of his old friends who\nhad escaped the wave of destruction, he had obtained a commission,\nand joined Bonaparte when he went to take the command of the army\nof Italy. He had attracted his general's attention early in the\ncampaign by a deed of  desperate valour, and was already in command\nof a regiment, when, soon after Jeanne's marriage, Marie came over\nto England by way of Holland to stay for a time with her sisters.\nShe was delighted at finding Jeanne so happy, and saw enough before she\nreturned to France to feel assured that before very long Virginie\nwould follow Jeanne's example, and would also become an Englishwoman,\nfor she and Harry's next brother Tom had evidently some sort of\nunderstanding between them. It was not until many years later that\nthe three sisters met again, when, after the fall of Napoleon,\nJeanne and Virginie went over with their husbands and stayed for\nsome weeks with General De Gisons and his wife at the old chateau\nnear Dijon. This the general had purchased back from the persons\ninto whose hands it had fallen at the Revolution with the money\nwhich he had received as his wife's dowry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of In the Reign of Terror, by G.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":149,"split":"train"}
