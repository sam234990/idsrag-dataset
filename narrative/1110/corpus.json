Parliamentary soldiers have been sent to search the forest and decide to burn Arnwood, the house of Colonel Beverley, a Cavalier officer killed at the Battle of Naseby. The four orphan children of the house, Edward, Humphrey, Alice and Edith, are believed to have died in the flames. However, they are saved by Jacob Armitage, a local verderer, who hides them in his isolated cottage and disguises them as his grandchildren.\nUnder Armitage's guidance, the children adapt from an aristocratic lifestyle to that of simple foresters. After Armitage's death, Edward takes charge and the children develop and expand the farmstead, aided by the entrepreneurial spirit of the younger brother Humphrey. They are assisted by a gypsy boy, Pablo, who they rescue from a pitfall trap. A sub-plot involves a hostile Puritan gamekeeper named Corbould who seeks to harm Edward and his family. Edward also encounters the sympathetic Puritan, Heatherstone, placed in charge of the Royal land in the New Forest, and rescues his daughter, Patience, in a house-fire. Edward leaves the cottage and works as a secretary for Heatherstone, but Edward maintains the pretence that he is the grandson of Jacob Armitage.\nEdward eventually joins the army of the future King Charles II, but after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, he returns to the New Forest where he learns that Heatherstone has been awarded the old Arnwood estate. Disillusioned by this, and by Patience's apparent rejection of his declarations of love, Edward flees to France. His sisters are sent away to be brought up as aristocratic ladies and his brother continues to live in the New Forest. Edward learns that Patience does, in fact, love him, and that Heatherstone had acquired the Arnwood estate for Edward, but he works as a mercenary soldier in exile until the Restoration when they are reunited.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Children of the New Forest, by Captain Marryat\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

By referring to the history of England of that\ndate they will find that King Charles the First, against whom the\nCommons of England had rebelled, after a civil war of nearly five years,\nhad been defeated, and was confined as a prisoner at Hampton Court.  The\nCavaliers, or the party who fought for King Charles, had all been\ndispersed, and the Parliamentary army under the command of Cromwell were\nbeginning to control the Commons.\n\nIt was in the month of November in this year that King Charles,\naccompanied by Sir John Berkely Ashburnham and Legg, made his escape\nfrom Hampton Court, and rode as fast as the horses could carry them\ntowards that part of Hampshire which led to the New Forest.  The king\nexpected that his friends had provided a vessel in which he might escape\nto France; but in this he was disappointed.  There was no vessel ready,\nand after riding for some time along the shore he resolved to go to\nTitchfield, a seat belonging to the Earl of Southampton.  After a long\nconsultation with those who attended him, he yielded to their advice,\nwhich was, to trust to Colonel Hammond, who was governor of the Isle of\nWight for the Parliament, but who was supposed to be friendly to the\nking.  Whatever might be the feelings of commiseration of Colonel\nHammond towards a king so unfortunately situated, he was firm in his\nduties towards his employers, and the consequence was that King Charles\nfound himself again a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle.\n\nBut we must now leave the king, and retrace history to the commencement\nof the civil war.  A short distance from the town of Lymington, which is\nnot far from Titchfield, where the king took shelter, but on the other\nside of the Southampton Water, and south of the New Forest, to which it\nadjoins, was a property called Arnwood, which belonged to a Cavalier of\nthe name of Beverley.  It was at that time a property of considerable\nvalue, being very extensive, and the park ornamented with valuable\ntimber; for it abutted on the New Forest, and might have been supposed\nto have been a continuation of it.  This Colonel Beverley, as we must\ncall him, for he rose to that rank in the king's army, was a valued\nfriend and companion of Prince Rupert's, and commanded several troops of\ncavalry.  He was ever at his side in the brilliant charges made by this\ngallant prince, and at last fell in his arms at the battle of Naseby.\nColonel Beverley had married into the family of the Villiers, and the\nissue of his marriage was two sons and two daughters; but his zeal and\nsense of duty had induced him, at the commencement of the war, to leave\nhis wife and family at Arnwood, and he was fated never to meet them\nagain.  The news of his death had such an effect upon Mrs Beverley,\nalready worn with anxiety on her husband's account, that a few months\nafterwards she followed him to an early tomb, leaving the four children\nunder the charge of an elderly relative till such time as the family of\nthe Villiers could protect them; but, as will appear by our history,\nthis was not at that period possible.  The life of a king and many other\nlives were in jeopardy, and the orphans remained at Arnwood, still under\nthe care of their elderly relation, at the time that our history\ncommences.\n\nThe New Forest, my readers are perhaps aware, was first enclosed by\nWilliam the Conqueror as a royal forest for his own amusement, for in\nthose days most crowned heads were passionately fond of the chase; and\nthey may also recollect that his successor, William Rufus, met his death\nin this forest by the glancing of an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell.\nSince that time to the present day it has continued a royal domain.  At\nthe period of which we are writing it had an establishment of verderers\nand keepers, paid by the Crown, amounting to some forty or fifty men.\nAt the commencement of the civil war they remained at their posts, but\nsoon found, in the disorganised state of the country, that their wages\nwere no longer to be obtained; and then, when the king had decided upon\nraising an army, Beverley, who held a superior office in the forest,\nenrolled all the young and athletic men who were employed in the forest,\nand marched them away with him to join the king's army.  Some few\nremained, their age not rendering their services of value, and among\nthem was an old and attached servant of Beverley's, a man above sixty\nyears of age, whose name was Jacob Armitage, and who had obtained the\nsituation through Colonel Beverley's interest.  Those who remained in\nthe forest lived in cottages many miles asunder, and indemnified\nthemselves for the non-payment of their salaries by killing the deer for\nsale and for their own subsistence.\n\nThe cottage of Jacob Armitage was situated on the skirts of the New\nForest, about a mile and a half from the mansion of Arnwood; and when\nColonel Beverley went to join the king's troops, feeling how little\nsecurity there would be for his wife and children in those troubled\ntimes, he requested the old man, by his attachment to the family, not to\nlose sight of Arnwood, but to call there as often as possible to see if\nhe could be of service to Mrs Beverley.  The colonel would have\npersuaded Jacob to have altogether taken up his residence at the\nmansion; but to this the old man objected.  He had been all his life\nunder the greenwood tree, and could not bear to leave the forest.  He\npromised the colonel that he would watch over his family, and ever be at\nhand when required; and he kept his word.  The death of Colonel Beverley\nwas a heavy blow to the old forester, and he watched over Mrs Beverley\nand the orphans with the greatest solicitude; but when Mrs Beverley\nfollowed her husband to the tomb he then redoubled his attentions, and\nwas seldom more than a few hours at a time away from the mansion.  The\ntwo boys were his inseparable companions, and he instructed them, young\nas they were, in all the secrets of his own calling.  Such was the state\nof affairs at the time that King Charles made his escape from Hampton\nCourt; and I now shall resume my narrative from where it was broken off.\n\nAs soon as the escape of Charles the First was made known to Cromwell\nand the Parliament, troops of horse were despatched in every direction\nto the southward, towards which the prints of the horses' hoofs proved\nthat he had gone.  As they found that he had proceeded in the direction\nof the New Forest, the troops were subdivided and ordered to scour the\nforest, in parties of twelve to twenty, while others hastened down to\nSouthampton, Lymington, and every other seaport or part of the coast\nfrom which the king might be likely to embark.  Old Jacob had been at\nArnwood on the day before, but on this day he had made up his mind to\nprocure some venison, that he might not go there again empty-handed; for\nMiss Judith Villiers was very partial to venison, and was not slow to\nremind Jacob if the larder was for many days deficient in that meat.\nJacob had gone out accordingly; he had gained his leeward position of a\nfine buck, and was gradually nearing him by stealth, now behind a huge\noak-tree, and then crawling through the high fern, so as to get within\nshot unperceived, when on a sudden the animal, which had been quietly\nfeeding, bounded away and disappeared in the thicket.  At the same time\nJacob perceived a small body of horse galloping through the glen in\nwhich the buck had been feeding.  Jacob had never yet seen the\nParliamentary troops, for they had not during the war been sent into\nthat part of the country, but their iron skull-caps, their buff\naccoutrements, and dark habiliments, assured him that such these must\nbe; so very different were they from the gaily-equipped Cavalier cavalry\ncommanded by Prince Rupert.  At the time that they advanced, Jacob had\nbeen lying down in the fern near to some low black-thorn-bushes; not\nwishing to be perceived by them, he drew back between the bushes,\nintending to remain concealed until they should gallop out of sight; for\nJacob thought, \"I am a king's forester, and they may consider me as an\nenemy; and who knows how I may be treated by them?\"  But Jacob was\ndisappointed in his expectations of the troops riding past him; on the\ncontrary, as soon as they arrived at an oak-tree within twenty yards of\nwhere he was concealed, the order was given to halt and dismount; the\nsabres of the horsemen clattered in their iron sheaths as the order was\nobeyed, and the old man expected to be immediately discovered; but one\nof the thorn-bushes was directly between him and the troopers, and\neffectually concealed him.  At last Jacob ventured to raise his head and\npeep through the bush; and he perceived that the men were loosening the\ngirths of their black horses, or wiping away the perspiration from their\nsides with handfuls of fern.\n\nA powerfully-framed man, who appeared to command the others, was\nstanding with his hand upon the arched neck of his steed, which appeared\nas fresh and vigorous as ever, although covered with foam and\nperspiration.  \"Spare not to rub down, my men,\" said he, \"for we have\ntried the mettle of our horses, and have now but one half-hour's\nbreathing-time.  We must be on, for the work of the Lord must be done.\"\n\n\"They say that this forest is many miles in length and breadth,\"\nobserved another of the men, \"and we may ride many a mile to no purpose;\nbut here is James Southwold, who once was living in it as a verderer;\nnay, I think that he said that he was born and bred in these woods.  Was\nit not so, James Southwold?\"\n\n\"It is even as you say,\" replied an active-looking young man; \"I was\nborn and bred in this forest, and my father was a verderer before me.\"\n\nJacob Armitage, who listened to the conversation, immediately recognised\nthe young man in question.  He was one of those who had joined the\nking's army with the other verderers and keepers.  It pained him much to\nperceive that one who had always been considered a frank, true-hearted\nyoung man, and who left the forest to fight in defence of his king, was\nnow turned a traitor, and had joined the ranks of the enemy; and Jacob\nthought how much better it had been for James Southwold if he had never\nquitted the New Forest, and had not been corrupted by evil company: \"He\nwas a good lad,\" thought Jacob, \"and now he is a traitor and a\nhypocrite.\"\n\n\"If born and bred in this forest, James Southwold,\" said the leader of\nthe troop, \"you must fain know all its mazes and paths.  Now call to\nmind, are there no secret hiding-places in which people may remain\nconcealed; no thickets which may cover both man and horse?  Peradventure\nthou mayst point out the very spot where this man Charles may be\nhidden.\"\n\n\"I do know one dell, within a mile of Arnwood,\" replied James Southwold,\n\"which might cover double our troop from the eyes of the most wary.\"\n\n\"We will ride there, then,\" replied the leader.  \"Arnwood, sayest thou?\nIs not that the property of the Malignant, Cavalier Beverley, who was\nshot down at Naseby?\"\n\n\"Even so,\" replied Southwold; \"and many is the time--that is, in the\nolden time, before I was regenerated--many is the day of revelry that I\nhave passed there; many the cup of good ale that I have quaffed.\"\n\n\"And thou shalt quaff it again,\" replied the leader.  \"Good ale was not\nintended only for Malignants, but for those who serve diligently.  After\nwe have examined the dell which thou speakest of, we will direct our\nhorses' heads towards Arnwood.\"\n\n\"Who knows but what the man Charles may be concealed in the Malignant's\nhouse?\" observed another.\n\n\"In the day, I should say no,\" replied the leader; \"but in the night the\nCavaliers like to have a roof over their heads; and therefore at night,\nand not before, will we proceed thither.\"\n\n\"I have searched many of their abodes,\" observed another; \"but search is\nalmost in vain.  What with their spring panels and secret doors, their\nfalse ceilings and double walls, one may ferret for ever and find\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the leader, \"their abodes are full of these Popish\nabominations; but there is one way which is sure; and if the man Charles\nbe concealed in any house, I venture to say that I will find him.  Fire\nand smoke will bring him forth; and to every Malignant's house within\ntwenty miles will I apply the torch; but it must be at night, for we are\nnot sure of his being housed during the day.  James Southwold, thou\nknowest well the mansion of Arnwood?\"\n\n\"I know well my way to all the offices below--the buttery, the cellar,\nand the kitchen; but I cannot say that I have ever been into the\napartments of the upper house.\"\n\n\"That it needeth not; if thou canst direct us to the lower entrance, it\nwill be sufficient.\"\n\n\"That can I, Master Ingram,\" replied Southwold, \"and to where the best\nale used to be found.\"\n\n\"Enough, Southwold, enough; our work must be done, and diligently.  Now,\nmy men, tighten your girths; we will just ride to the dell: if it\nconceals not whom we seek, it shall conceal us till night, and then the\ncountry shall be lighted up with the flames of Arnwood, while we\nsurround the house and prevent escape.  Levellers, to horse!\"\n\nThe troopers sprang upon their saddles, and went off at a hard trot,\nSouthwold leading the way.  Jacob remained among the fern until they\nwere out of sight, and then rose up.  He looked for a short time in the\ndirection in which the troopers had gone, stooped down again to take up\nhis gun, and then said, \"There's providence in this; yes, and there's\nprovidence in my not having my dog with me, for he would not have\nremained quiet for so long a time.  Who would ever have thought that\nJames Southwold would have turned a traitor!  More than traitor, for he\nis now ready to bite the hand that has fed him, to burn the house that\nhas ever welcomed him.  This is a bad world, and I thank heaven that I\nhave lived in the woods.  But there is no time to lose;\" and the old\nforester threw his gun over his shoulder and hastened away in the\ndirection of his own cottage.\n\n\"And so the king has escaped,\" thought Jacob, as he went along, \"and he\nmay be in the forest!  Who knows but he may be at Arnwood, for he must\nhardly know where to go for shelter?  I must haste and see Miss Judith\nimmediately.  `Levellers, to horse!' the fellow said.  What's a\nLeveller?\" thought Jacob.\n\nAs perhaps my readers may ask the same question, they must know that a\nlarge proportion of the Parliamentary army had at this time assumed the\nname of Levellers, in consequence of having taken up the opinion that\nevery man should be on an equality, and property should be equally\ndivided.  The hatred of these people to any one above them in rank or\nproperty, especially towards those of the king's party, which mostly\nconsisted of men of rank and property, was unbounded, and they were\nmerciless and cruel to the highest degree; throwing off much of hat\nfanatical bearing and language which had before distinguished the\nPuritans.  Cromwell had great difficulty in eventually putting them\ndown, which he did at last accomplish by hanging and slaughtering many.\nOf this Jacob knew nothing; all he knew was, that Arnwood was to be\nburnt down that night, and that it would be necessary to remove the\nfamily.  As for obtaining assistance to oppose the troopers, that he\nknew to be impossible.  As he thought of what must take place, he\nthanked God for having allowed him to gain the knowledge of what was to\nhappen, and hastened on his way.  He had been about eight miles from\nArnwood when he had concealed himself in the fern.  Jacob first went to\nhis cottage to deposit his gun, saddled his forest pony, and set off for\nArnwood.  In less than two hours the old man was at the door of the\nmansion; it was then about three o'clock in the afternoon, and being in\nthe month of November, there was not so much as two hours of daylight\nremaining.  \"I shall have a difficult job with the stiff old lady,\"\nthought Jacob, as he rang the bell; \"I don't believe that she would rise\nout of her high chair for old Noll and his whole army at his back.  But\nwe shall see.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nBefore Jacob is admitted to the presence of Miss Judith Villiers, we\nmust give some account of the establishment at Arnwood.  With the\nexception of one male servant, who officiated in the house and stable as\nhis services might be required, every man of the household of Colonel\nBeverley had followed the fortunes of their master, and as none had\nreturned, they, in all probability, had shared his fate.  Three female\nservants, with the man above mentioned, composed the whole household.\nIndeed, there was every reason for not increasing the establishment; for\nthe rents were either paid in part or not paid at all.  It was generally\nsupposed that the property, now that the Parliament had gained the day,\nwould be sequestrated, although such was not yet the case; and the\ntenants were unwilling to pay, to those who were not authorised to\nreceive, the rents which they might be again called upon to make good.\nMiss Judith Villiers, therefore, found it difficult to maintain the\npresent household; and although she did not tell Jacob Armitage that\nsuch was the case, the fact was, that very often the venison which he\nbrought to the mansion was all the meat that was in the larder.  The\nthree female servants held the offices of cook, attendant upon Miss\nVilliers, and housemaid; the children being under the care of no\nparticular servant, and left much to themselves.  There had been a\nchaplain in the house, but he had quitted before the death of Mrs\nBeverley, and the vacancy had not been filled up; indeed, it could not\nwell be, for the one who left had not received his salary for many\nmonths, and Miss Judith Villiers, expecting every day to be summoned by\nher relations to bring the children and join them, sat in her high chair\nwaiting for the arrival of this summons, which, from the distracted\nstate of the times, had never come.\n\nAs we have before said, the orphans were four in number; the two eldest\nwere boys, and the youngest were girls.  Edward, the eldest boy, was\nbetween thirteen and fourteen years old; Humphrey, the second, was\ntwelve; Alice, eleven; and Edith, eight.  As it is the history of these\nyoung persons which we are about to narrate, we shall say little about\nthem at present, except that for many months they had been under little\nor no restraint, and less attended to.  Their companions were Benjamin,\nthe man who remained in the house, and old Jacob Armitage, who passed\nall the time he could spare with them.  Benjamin was rather weak in\nintellect, and was a source of amusement rather than otherwise.  As for\nthe female servants, one was wholly occupied with her attendance on Miss\nJudith, who was very exacting, and had a high notion of her own\nconsequence.  The other two had more than sufficient employment; as,\nwhen there is no money to pay with, everything must be done at home.\nThat, under such circumstances, the boys became boisterous and the\nlittle girls became romps, is not to be wondered at; but their having\nbecome so was the cause of Miss Judith seldom admitting them into her\nroom.  It is true that they were sent for once a day, to ascertain if\nthey were in the house or in existence, but soon dismissed and left to\ntheir own resources.  Such was the neglect to which these young orphans\nwere exposed.  It must, however, be admitted, that this very neglect\nmade them independent and bold, full of health from constant activity,\nand more fitted for the change which was so soon to take place.\n\n\"Benjamin,\" said Jacob, as the other came to the door, \"I must speak\nwith the old lady.\"\n\n\"Have you brought any venison, Jacob?\" said Benjamin, grinning; \"else, I\nreckon, you'll not be over welcome.\"\n\n\"No, I have not; but it is an important business, so send Agatha to her\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"I will; and I'll not say anything about the venison.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Jacob was ushered up by Agatha into Miss Judith\nVilliers's apartment.  The old lady was about fifty years of age, very\nprim and starched, sitting in a high-backed chair, with her feet upon a\nstool, and her hands crossed before her, her black mittens reposing upon\nher snow-white apron.\n\nThe old forester made his obeisance.\n\n\"You have important business with us, I am told,\" observed Miss Judith.\n\n\"Most important, madam,\" replied Jacob.  \"In the first place, it is\nright that you should be informed that his Majesty King Charles has\nescaped from Hampton Court.\"\n\n\"His majesty escaped!\" replied the lady.\n\n\"Yes; and is supposed to be secreted somewhere in this neighbourhood.\nHis majesty is not in this house, madam, I presume?\"\n\n\"Jacob, his majesty is not in this house; if he were, I would suffer my\ntongue to be torn out sooner than I would confess it, even to you.\"\n\n\"But I have more for your private ear, madam.\"\n\n\"Agatha, retire; and Agatha, be mindful that you go downstairs, and do\nnot remain outside the door.\"\n\nAgatha, with this injunction, bounced out of the room, slamming-to the\ndoor so as to make Miss Judith start from her seat.\n\n\"Ill-mannered girl!\" exclaimed Miss Judith.  \"Now, Jacob Armitage, you\nmay proceed.\"\n\nJacob then entered into the detail of what he had overheard that\nmorning, when he fell in with the troopers, concluding with the\ninformation that the mansion would be burnt down that very night.  He\nthen pointed out the necessity of immediately abandoning the house, as\nit would be impossible to oppose the troopers.\n\n\"And where am I to go to, Jacob?\" said Miss Judith calmly.\n\n\"I hardly know, madam; there is my cottage, it is but a poor place, and\nnot fit for one like you.\"\n\n\"So I should presume, Jacob Armitage; neither shall I accept your offer.\nIt would ill befit the dignity of a Villiers to be frightened out of\nher abode by a party of rude soldiers.  Happen what will, I shall not\nstir from this--no, not even from this chair.  Neither do I consider the\ndanger so great as you suppose.  Let Benjamin saddle, and be prepared to\nride over to Lymington immediately.  I will give him a letter to the\nmagistrate there, who will send us protection.\"\n\n\"But, madam, the children cannot remain here.  I will not leave them\nhere.  I promised the colonel--\"\n\n\"Will the children be in more danger than I shall be, Jacob Armitage?\"\nreplied the old lady stiffly.  \"They dare not ill-treat me--they may\nforce the buttery and drink the ale--they may make merry with that and\nthe venison which you have brought with you, I presume; but they will\nhardly venture to insult a lady of the house of Villiers.\"\n\n\"I fear they will venture anything, madam.  At all events, they will\nfrighten the children, and for one night they will be better in my\ncottage.\"\n\n\"Well, then, be it so; take them to your cottage, and take Martha to\nattend upon the Miss Beverleys.  Go down now, and desire Agatha to come\nto me, and Benjamin to saddle as fast as he can.\"\n\nJacob left the room, satisfied with the permission to remove the\nchildren.  He knew that it was useless to argue with Miss Judith, who\nwas immovable when once she had declared her intentions.  He was\ndebating in his own mind whether he should acquaint the servants with\nthe threatened danger; but he had no occasion to do so, for Agatha had\nremained at the door while Jacob was communicating the intelligence, and\nas soon as he had arrived at that portion of it by which she learnt that\nthe mansion was to be burnt down that night, had run off to the kitchen\nto communicate the intelligence to the other servants.\n\n\"I'll not stay to be burnt to death,\" exclaimed the cook, as Jacob came\nin.  \"Well, Mr Armitage, this is pretty news you have brought.  What\ndoes my lady say?\"\n\n\"She desires that Benjamin saddles immediately, to carry a letter to\nLymington; and you, Agatha, are to go upstairs to her.\"\n\n\"But what does she mean to do?  Where are we to go?\" exclaimed Agatha.\n\n\"Miss Judith intends to remain where she is.\"\n\n\"Then she will remain alone for me,\" exclaimed the housemaid, who was\nadmired by Benjamin.  \"It's bad enough to have little victuals and no\nwages; but as for being burnt to death--Benjamin, put a pillion behind\nyour saddle, and I'll go to Lymington with you.  I won't be long in\ngetting my bundle.\"\n\nBenjamin, who was in the kitchen with the maids at the time that Jacob\nentered, made a sign significant of consent, and went away to the\nstable.  Agatha went up to her mistress in a state of great\nperturbation, and the cook also hurried away to her bedroom.\n\n\"They'll all leave her,\" thought Jacob; \"well, my duty is plain; I'll\nnot leave the children in the house.\"  Jacob then went in search of\nthem, and found them playing in the garden.  He called the two boys to\nhim, and told them to follow him.  \"Now, Mr Edward,\" said he, \"you must\nprove yourself your father's own son.  We must leave this house\nimmediately; come up with me to your rooms, and help me to pack up yours\nand your sisters' clothes, for we must go to my cottage this night.\nThere is no time to be lost.\"\n\n\"But why, Jacob; I must know why?\"\n\n\"Because the Parliamentary troopers will burn it down this night.\"\n\n\"Burn it down!  Why, the house is mine, is it not?  Who dares to burn\ndown this house?\"\n\n\"They will dare it, and will do it.\"\n\n\"But we will fight them, Jacob; we can bolt and bar; I can fire a gun,\nand hit too, as you know; then there's Benjamin and you.\"\n\n\"And what can you and two men do against a troop of horse, my dear boy?\nIf we could defend the place against them, Jacob Armitage would be the\nfirst; but it is impossible, my dear boy.  Recollect your sisters.\nWould you have them burnt to death, or shot by these wretches?  No, no,\nMr Edward; you must do as I say, and lose no time.  Let us pack up what\nwill be most useful, and load White Billy with the bundles; then you\nmust all come to the cottage with me, and we will make it out how we\ncan.\"\n\n\"That will be jolly!\" said Humphrey; \"come, Edward.\"\n\nBut Edward Beverley required more persuasion to abandon the house; at\nlast old Jacob prevailed, and the clothes were put up in bundles as fast\nas they could collect them.\n\n\"Your aunt said Martha was to go with your sisters, but I doubt if she\nwill,\" observed Jacob, \"and I think we shall have no room for her, for\nthe cottage is small enough.\"\n\n\"Oh no, we don't want her,\" said Humphrey; \"Alice always dresses Edith\nand herself too, ever since mamma died.\"\n\n\"Now we will carry down the bundles, and you make them fast on the pony\nwhile I go for your sisters.\"\n\n\"But where does Aunt Judith go?\" inquired Edward.\n\n\"She will not leave the house, Master Edward; she intends to stay and\nspeak to the troopers.\"\n\n\"And so an old woman like her remains to face the enemy, while I run\naway from them!\" replied Edward.  \"I will not go.\"\n\n\"Well, Master Edward,\" replied Jacob, \"you must do as you please; but it\nwill be cruel to leave your sisters here; they and Humphrey must come\nwith me, and I cannot manage to get them to the cottage without you go\nwith us; it is not far, and you can return in a very short time.\"\n\nTo this Edward consented.  The pony was soon loaded, and the little\ngirls, who were still playing in the garden, were called in by Humphrey.\nThey were told that they were going to pass the night in the cottage,\nand were delighted at the idea.\n\n\"Now, Master Edward,\" said Jacob, \"will you take your sisters by the\nhand and lead them to the cottage?  Here is the key of the door; Master\nHumphrey can lead the pony; and Master Edward,\" continued Jacob, taking\nhim aside, \"I'll tell you one thing which I will not mention before your\nbrother and sisters: the troopers are all about the New Forest, for King\nCharles has escaped, and they are seeking for him.  You must not,\ntherefore, leave your brother and sisters till I return.  Lock the\ncottage-door as soon as it is dark.  You know where to get a light, over\nthe cupboard; and my gun is loaded, and hangs above the mantelpiece.\nYou must do your best, if they attempt to force an entrance; but above\nall, promise me not to leave them till I return.  I will remain here to\nsee what I can do with your aunt; and when I come back, we can then\ndecide how to act.\"\n\nThis latter ruse of Jacob's succeeded.  Edward promised that he would\nnot leave his sisters, and it wanted but a few minutes of twilight when\nthe little party quitted the mansion of Arnwood.  As they went out of\nthe gates, they were passed by Benjamin, who was trotting away with\nMartha behind him on a pillion, holding a bundle as large as herself.\nNot a word was exchanged, and Benjamin and Martha were soon out of\nsight.\n\n\"Why, where can Martha be going?\" said Alice.  \"Will she be back when we\ncome home to-morrow?\"\n\nEdward made no reply, but Humphrey said, \"Well, she has taken plenty of\nclothes in that huge bundle, for one night, at least.\"\n\nJacob, as soon as he had seen the children on their way, returned to the\nkitchen, where he found Agatha and the cook collecting their property,\nevidently bent upon a hasty retreat.\n\n\"Have you seen Miss Judith, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Yes; and she told me that she should remain, and that I should stand\nbehind her chair, that she might receive the troopers with dignity; but\nI don't admire the plan.  They might leave her alone, but I am sure that\nthey will be rude to me.\"\n\n\"When did Benjamin say he would be back?\"\n\n\"He don't intend coming back.  He said he would not, at all events, till\nto-morrow morning, and then he would ride out this way, to ascertain if\nthe report was false or true.  But Martha has gone with him.\"\n\n\"I wish I could persuade the old lady to leave the house,\" said Jacob\nthoughtfully.  \"I fear they will not pay her the respect that she\ncalculates upon.  Go up, Agatha, and say I wish to speak with her.\"\n\n\"No, not I; I must be off, for it is dark already.\"\n\n\"And where are you going, then?\"\n\n\"To Gossip Allwood's.  It's a good mile, and I have to carry my things.\"\n\n\"Well, Agatha, if you'll take me up to the old lady, I'll carry your\nthings for you.\"\n\nAgatha consented, and as soon as she had taken up the lamp, for it was\nnow quite dark, Jacob was once more introduced.\n\n\"I wish, madam,\" said Jacob, \"you would be persuaded to leave the house\nfor this night.\"\n\n\"Jacob Armitage, leave this house I will not, if it were filled with\ntroopers; I have said so.\"\n\n\"But, madam--\"\n\n\"No more, sir; you are too forward,\" replied the old lady haughtily.\n\n\"But, madam--\"\n\n\"Leave my presence, Jacob Armitage, and never appear again.  Quit the\nroom, and send Agatha here.\"\n\n\"She has left, madam, and so has the cook, and Martha went away behind\nBenjamin; when I leave, you will be alone.\"\n\n\"They have dared to leave?\"\n\n\"They dared not stay, madam.\"\n\n\"Leave me, Jacob Armitage, and shut the door when you go out.\"  Jacob\nstill hesitated.  \"Obey me instantly,\" said the old lady; and the\nforester, finding all remonstrance useless, went out, and obeyed her\nlast commands by shutting the door after him.\n\nJacob found Agatha and the other maid in the courtyard; he took up their\npackages, and, as he promised, accompanied them to Gossip Allwood, who\nkept a small ale-house about a mile distant.\n\n\"But, mercy on us!  What will become of the children?\" said Agatha, as\nthey walked along, her fears for herself having, up to this time, made\nher utterly forgetful of them.  \"Poor things!  And Martha has left\nthem.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; what will become of the dear babes?\" said the cook,\nhalf-crying.\n\nNow Jacob, knowing that the children of such a Malignant as Colonel\nBeverley would have sorry treatment if discovered, and knowing also that\nwomen were not always to be trusted, determined not to tell them how\nthey were disposed of.  He therefore replied:\n\n\"Who would hurt such young children as those?  No, no, they are safe\nenough; even the troopers would protect them.\"\n\n\"I should hope so,\" replied Agatha.\n\n\"You may be sure of that; no man would hurt babies,\" replied Jacob.\n\"The troopers will take them with them to Lymington, I suppose.  I've no\nfear for them; it's the proud old lady whom they will be uncivil to.\"\n\nThe conversation here ended, and in due time they arrived at the inn.\nJacob had just put the bundles down on the table when the clattering of\nhorses' hoofs was heard.  Shortly afterwards the troopers pulled their\nhorses up at the door, and dismounted.  Jacob recognised the party he\nhad met in the forest, and among them Southwold.  The troopers called\nfor ale, and remained some time in the house, talking and laughing with\nthe women, especially Agatha, who was a very good-looking girl.  Jacob\nwould have retreated quietly, but he found a sentinel posted at the door\nto prevent the egress of any person.  He reseated himself, and while he\nwas listening to the conversation of the troopers, he was recognised by\nSouthwold, who accosted him.  Jacob did not pretend not to know him, as\nit would have been useless; and Southwold put many questions to him as\nto who were resident at Arnwood.  Jacob replied that the children were\nthere, and a few servants, and he was about to mention Miss Judith\nVilliers, when a thought struck him,--he might save the old lady.\n\n\"You are going to Arnwood, I know,\" said Jacob, \"and I have heard who\nyou are in search of.  Well, Southwold, I'll give you a hint.  I may be\nwrong; but if you should fall in with an old lady, or something like\none, when you go to Arnwood, mount her on your crupper, and away with\nher to Lymington as fast as you can ride.  You understand me.\"\nSouthwold nodded significantly, and squeezed Jacob's hand.\n\n\"One word, Jacob Armitage; if I succeed in the capture by your means, it\nis but fair that you should have something for your hint.  Where can I\nfind you the day after to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I am leaving the country this night, and go I must.  I am in trouble,\nthat's the fact; when all is blown over, I will find you out.  Don't\nspeak to me any more just now.\"  Southwold again squeezed Jacob's hand,\nand left him.  Shortly afterwards the order was given to mount, and the\ntroopers set off.\n\nArmitage followed slowly and unobserved.  They arrived at the mansion\nand surrounded it.  Shortly afterwards he perceived the glare of\ntorches, and in a quarter of an hour more thick smoke rose up in the\ndark but clear sky; at last the flames burst forth from the lower\nwindows of the mansion, and soon afterwards they lighted up the country\nround to some distance.\n\n\"It is done,\" thought Jacob, and he turned to bend his hasty steps\ntowards his own cottage, when he heard the galloping of a horse and\nviolent screams; a minute afterwards James Southwold passed him with the\nold lady tied behind him, kicking and struggling as hard as she could.\nJacob smiled, as he thought that he had by his little stratagem saved\nthe old woman's life, for that Southwold imagined that she was King\nCharles dressed up as an old woman was evident; and he then returned as\nfast as he could to the cottage.\n\nIn half an hour Jacob had passed through the thick woods which were\nbetween the mansion and his own cottage, occasionally looking back, as\nthe flames of the mansion rose higher and higher, throwing their light\nfar and wide.  He knocked at the cottage-door; Smoker, a large dog,\ncross-bred between the fox and bloodhound, growled till Jacob spoke to\nhim, and then Edward opened the door.\n\n\"My sisters are in bed and fast asleep, Jacob,\" said Edward, \"and\nHumphrey has been nodding this half-hour; had he not better go to bed\nbefore we go back?\"\n\n\"Come out, Master Edward,\"--replied Jacob, \"and look.\"  Edward beheld\nthe flames and fierce light between the trees, and was silent.\n\n\"I told you that it would be so, and you would all have been burnt in\nyour beds, for they did not enter the house to see who was in it, but\nfired it as soon as they had surrounded it.\"\n\n\"And my aunt!\" exclaimed Edward, clasping his hands.\n\n\"Is safe, Master Edward, and by this time at Lymington.\"\n\n\"We will go to her to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I fear not; you must not risk so much, Master Edward.  These Levellers\nspare nobody, and you had better let it be supposed that you are all\nburnt in the house.\"\n\n\"But my aunt knows the contrary, Jacob.\"\n\n\"Very true; I quite forgot that.\"  And so Jacob had.  He expected that\nthe old woman would have been burnt, and then nobody would have known of\nthe existence of the children; he forgot when he planned to save her,\nthat she knew where the children were.\n\n\"Well, Master Edward, I will go to Lymington to-morrow and see the old\nlady; but you must remain here, and take charge of your sisters till I\ncome back, and then we will consider what is to be done.  The flames are\nnot so bright as they were.\"\n\n\"No.  It is my house that these Roundheads have burned down,\" said\nEdward, shaking his fist.\n\n\"It was your house, Master Edward, and it was your property; but how\nlong it will be so remains to be seen.  I fear it will be forfeited.\"\n\n\"Woe to the people who dare take possession of it,\" cried Edward; \"I\nshall, if I live, be a man one of these days.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Edward, and then you will reflect more than you do now, and\nnot be rash.  Let us go into the cottage, for it's no use remaining out\nin the cold; the frost is sharp to-night.\"\n\nEdward slowly followed Jacob into the cottage.  His little heart was\nfull.  He was a proud boy and a good boy, but the destruction of the\nmansion had raised up evil thoughts in his heart--hatred to the\nCovenanters, who had killed his father and now burnt the property--\nrevenge upon them (how, he knew not); but his hand was ready to strike,\nyoung as he was.  He lay down on the bed, but he could not sleep.  He\nturned and turned again, and his brain was teeming with thoughts and\nplans of vengeance.  Had he said his prayers that night, he would have\nbeen obliged to repeat, \"Forgive us, as we forgive them who trespass\nagainst us.\"  At last he fell fast asleep, but his dreams were wild, and\nhe often called out during the night, and woke his brother and sisters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as Jacob had given the children their\nbreakfast, he set off towards Arnwood.  He knew that Benjamin had stated\nhis intention to return with the horse and see what had taken place, and\nhe knew him well enough to feel sure that he would do so.  He thought it\nbetter to see him, if possible, and ascertain the fate of Miss Judith.\nJacob arrived at the still smoking ruins of the mansion, and found\nseveral people there, mostly residents within a few miles, some\nattracted by curiosity, others busy in collecting the heavy masses of\nlead which had been melted from the roof, and appropriating them to\ntheir own benefit; but much of it was still too hot to be touched, and\nthey were throwing snow on it to cool it, for it had snowed during the\nnight.  At last Jacob perceived Benjamin on horseback riding leisurely\ntowards him, and immediately went up to him.\n\n\"Well, Benjamin, this is a woeful sight.  What is the news from\nLymington?\"\n\n\"Lymington is full of troopers, and they are not over civil,\" replied\nBenjamin.\n\n\"And the old lady--where is she?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's a sad business,\" replied Benjamin, \"and the poor children,\ntoo.  Poor Master Edward!  He would have made a brave gentleman.\"\n\n\"But the old lady is safe,\" rejoined Jacob.  \"Did you see her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw her; they thought she _was_ King Charles--poor old soul.\"\n\n\"But they have found out their mistake by this time?\"\n\n\"Yes, and James Southwold has found it out too,\" replied Benjamin; \"to\nthink of the old lady breaking his neck!\"\n\n\"Breaking his neck?  You don't say so!  How was it?\"\n\n\"Why, it seems that Southwold thought that she was King Charles dressed\nup as an old woman, so he seized her and strapped her fast behind him,\nand galloped away with her to Lymington; but she struggled and kicked so\nmanfully, that he could not hold on, and off they went together, and he\nbroke his neck.\"\n\n\"Indeed!--a judgment--a judgment upon a traitor,\" said Jacob.\n\n\"They were picked up, strapped together as they were, by the other\ntroopers, and carried to Lymington.\"\n\n\"Well, and where is the old lady, then?  Did you see and speak to her?\"\n\n\"I saw her, Jacob, but I did not speak to her.  I forgot to say, that\nwhen she broke Southwold's neck, she broke her own too.\"\n\n\"Then the old lady is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, that she is,\" replied Benjamin; \"but who cares about her?  It's\nthe poor children that I pity.  Martha has been crying ever since.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder.\"\n\n\"I was at the `Cavalier,' and the troopers were there, and they were\nboasting of what they had done, and called it a righteous work.  I could\nnot stand that, and I asked one of them if it were a righteous work to\nburn poor children in their beds?  So he turned round, and struck his\nsword upon the floor, and asked me whether I was one of them--`Who are\nyou then?' and I--all my courage went away, and I answered, I was a poor\nrat-catcher.  `A rat-catcher, are you?  Well then, Mr Rat-catcher, when\nyou are killing rats, if you find a nest of young ones, don't you kill\nthem too?  Or do you leave them to grow, and become mischievous,\neh?'--`I kill the young ones, of course,' replied I.  `Well, so do we\nMalignants whenever we find them.'  I didn't say a word more, so I went\nout of the house as fast as I could.\"\n\n\"Have you heard anything about the king?\" inquired Jacob.\n\n\"No, nothing; but the troopers are all out again, and, I hear, are gone\nto the forest.\"\n\n\"Well, Benjamin, good-bye; I shall be off from this part of the\ncountry--it's no use my staying here.  Where's Agatha and cook?\"\n\n\"They came to Lymington early this morning.\"\n\n\"Wish them good-bye for me, Benjamin.\"\n\n\"Where are you going then?\"\n\n\"I can't exactly say, but I think London way.  I only stayed here to\nwatch over the children; and now that they are gone, I shall leave\nArnwood for ever.\"\n\nJacob, who was anxious, on account of the intelligence he had received\nof the troopers being in the forest, to return to the cottage, shook\nhands with Benjamin, and hastened away.  \"Well,\" thought Jacob, as he\nwended his way, \"I'm sorry for the poor old lady; but still, perhaps,\nit's all for the best.  Who knows what they might do with these\nchildren?--Destroy the nest as well as the rats, indeed:--they must find\nthe nest first.\"  And the old forester continued his journey in deep\nthought.\n\nWe may here observe that, bloodthirsty as many of the Levellers were, we\ndo not think that Jacob Armitage had grounds for the fears which he\nexpressed and felt that is to say, we believe that he might have made\nknown the existence of the children to the Villiers family, and that\nthey would never have been harmed by anybody.  That by the burning of\nthe mansion they might have perished in the flames, had they been in\nbed, as they would have been at that hour, had he not obtained\nintelligence of what was about to be done, is true; but that there was\nany danger to them on account of their father having been such a staunch\nsupporter of the king's cause, is very unlikely, and not borne out by\nthe history of the times; but the old forester thought otherwise; he had\na hatred of the Puritans, and their deeds had been so exaggerated by\nrumour that he fully believed that the lives of the children were not\nsafe.  Under this conviction, and feeling himself bound by his promise\nto Colonel Beverley to protect them, Jacob resolved that they should\nlive with him in the forest, and be brought up as his own grandchildren.\nHe knew that there could be no better place for concealment; for,\nexcept the keepers, few people knew where his cottage was; and it was so\nout of the usual paths, and so embosomed in lofty trees, that there was\nlittle chance of its being seen, or being known to exist.  He resolved,\ntherefore, that they should remain with him till better times; and then\nhe would make known their existence to the other branches of the family,\nbut not before.  \"I can hunt for them, and provide for them,\" thought\nhe, \"and I have a little money, when it is required; and I will teach\nthem to be useful; they must learn to provide for themselves.  There's\nthe garden, and the patch of land: in two or three years the boys will\nbe able to do something.  I can't teach them much; but I can teach them\nto fear God.  We must get on how we can, and put our trust in Him who is\na Father to the fatherless.\"\n\nWith such thoughts running in his head, Jacob arrived at the cottage,\nand found the children outside the door, watching for him.  They all\nhastened to him, and the dog rushed before them, to welcome his master.\n\"Down, Smoker, good dog.  Well, Mr Edward, I have been as quick as I\ncan.  How have Mr Humphrey and your sisters behaved?  But we must not\nremain outside to-day, for the troopers are scouring the forest, and may\nsee you.  Let us come in directly; for it would not do that they should\ncome here.\"\n\n\"Will they burn the cottage down?\" inquired Alice, as she took Jacob's\nhand.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I think they would, if they found that you and your\nbrothers were in it: but we must not let them see you.\"\n\nThey all entered the cottage, which consisted of one large room in\nfront, and two back rooms for bedrooms.  There was also a third bedroom,\nwhich was behind the other two, but which had not any furniture in it.\n\n\"Now let's see what we can have for dinner--there's venison left, I\nknow,\" said Jacob: \"come, we must all be useful.  Who will be cook?\"\n\n\"I will be cook,\" said Alice, \"if you will show me how.\"\n\n\"So you shall, my dear,\" said Jacob, \"and I will show you how.  There's\nsome potatoes in the basket in the corner--and some onions hanging on\nthe string--we must have some water--who will fetch it?\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Edward; who took up a pail and went out to the spring.\n\nThe potatoes were peeled and washed by the children--Jacob and Edward\ncut the venison into pieces--the iron pot was cleaned--and then the meat\nand potatoes put with water into the pot, and placed on the fire.\n\n\"Now I'll cut, up the onions, for they will make your eyes water.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Humphrey; \"I'll cut and cry at the same time.\"\n\nAnd Humphrey took up a knife, and cut away most manfully, although he\nwas obliged to wipe his eyes with his sleeve very often.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow, Humphrey,\" said Jacob.  \"Now we'll put the\nonions in, and let it all boil up together.  Now, you see you have\ncooked your own dinner; ain't that pleasant?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried they all; \"and we will eat our own dinners as soon as it is\nready.\"\n\n\"Then, Humphrey, you must get some of the platters down which are on the\ndresser; and Alice, you will find some knives in the drawer.  And let me\nsee, what can little Edith do?  Oh, she can go to the cupboard and find\nthe salt-cellar.  Edward, just look-out, and if you see anybody coming\nor passing, let me know.  We must put you on guard till the troopers\nleave the forest.\"\n\nThe children set about their tasks, and Humphrey cried out, as he very\noften did, \"Now, this is jolly!\"\n\nWhile the dinner was cooking Jacob amused the children by showing them\nhow to put things in order; the floor was swept, the hearth was made\ntidy.  He showed Alice how to wash out a cloth, and Humphrey how to dust\nthe chairs.  They all worked merrily, while little Edith stood and\nclapped her hands.\n\nBut just before dinner was ready Edward came in and said, \"Here are\ntroopers galloping in the forest!\"  Jacob went out, and observed that\nthey were coming in a direction that would lead near to the cottage.\n\nHe walked in, and after a moment's thought, he said, \"My dear children,\nthose men may come and search the cottage; you must do as I tell you,\nand mind that you are very quiet.  Humphrey, you and your sisters must\ngo to bed, and pretend to be very ill.  Edward, take off your coat and\nput on this old hunting-frock of mine.  You must be in the bedroom\nattending your sick brother and sisters.  Come, Edith dear, you must\nplay at going to bed, and have your dinner afterwards.\"\n\nJacob took the children into the bedroom, and removing the upper dress,\nwhich would have betrayed that they were not the children of poor\npeople, put them in bed, and covered them up to the chins with the\nclothes Edward had put on the old hunting-shirt, which came below his\nknees, and stood with a mug of water in his hand by the bedside of the\ntwo girls.  Jacob went to the outer room, to remove the platters laid\nout for dinner; and he had hardly done so, when he heard the noise of\nthe troopers, and soon afterwards a knock at the cottage-door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Jacob.\n\n\"Who are you, my friend?\" said the leader of the troop, entering the\ndoor.\n\n\"A poor forester, sir,\" replied Jacob, \"under great trouble.\"\n\n\"What trouble, my man?\"\n\n\"I have the children all in bed with the smallpox.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, we must search your cottage.\"\n\n\"You are welcome,\" replied Jacob; \"only don't frighten the children if\nyou can help it.\"\n\nThe man, who was now joined by others, commenced his search.  Jacob\nopened all the doors of the rooms, and they passed through.  Little\nEdith shrieked when she saw them; but Edward patted her, and told her\nnot to be frightened.  The troopers, however, took no notice of the\nchildren; they searched thoroughly, and then came back to the front\nroom.\n\n\"It's no use remaining here,\" said one of the troopers.  \"Shall we be\noff?  I'm tired and hungry with the ride.\"\n\n\"So am I; and there's something that smells well,\" said another.\n\"What's this, my good man,\" continued he, taking off the lid of the pot.\n\n\"My dinner for a week,\" replied Jacob.  \"I have no one to cook for me\nnow, and can't light a fire every day.\"\n\n\"Well, you appear to live well, if you have such a mess as that every\nday in the week.  I should like to try a spoonful or two.\"\n\n\"And welcome, sir,\" replied Jacob; \"I will cook some more for myself.\"\n\nThe troopers took him at his word; they sat down to the table, and very\nsoon the whole contents of the kettle had disappeared.  Having satisfied\nthemselves, they got up, told him that his rations were so good that\nthey hoped to call again; and, laughing heartily, they mounted their\nhorses, and rode away.\n\n\"Well,\" said Jacob, \"they are very welcome to the dinner; I little\nthought to get off so cheap.\"  As soon as they were out of sight Jacob\ncalled to Edward and the children to get up again, which they soon did.\nAlice put on Edith's frock, Humphrey put on his jacket, and Edward\npulled off the hunting-shirt.\n\n\"They're gone now,\" said Jacob, coming in from the door.\n\n\"And our dinners are gone,\" said Humphrey, looking at the empty pot and\ndirty platters.\n\n\"Yes; but we can cook another: and that will be more play, you know,\"\nsaid Jacob.  \"Edward, go for the water; Humphrey, cut the onions; Alice,\nwash the potatoes; and Edith, help everybody, while I cut up some more\nmeat.\"\n\n\"I hope it will be as good,\" observed Humphrey; \"that other did smell so\nnice!\"\n\n\"Quite as good, if not better; for we shall improve by practice, and we\nshall have a better appetite to eat it with,\" said Jacob.\n\n\"Nasty men eat our dinner,\" said Edith.  \"Shan't have any more.  Eat\nthis ourselves.\"\n\nAnd so they did as soon as it was cooked; but they were very hungry\nbefore they sat down.\n\n\"This is jolly!\" said Humphrey, with his mouth full.\n\n\"Yes, Master Humphrey.  I doubt if King Charles gets so good a dinner\nthis day.  Mr Edward, you are very grave and silent.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, Jacob.  Have I not cause?  Oh!  If I could but have mauled\nthose troopers!\"\n\n\"But you could not; so you must make the best of it.  They say that\nevery dog has his day, and who knows but King Charles may be on the\nthrone again!\"\n\nThere were no more visits to the cottage that day, and they all went to\nbed and slept soundly.\n\nThe next morning Jacob, who was most anxious to learn the news, saddled\nthe pony, having first given his injunctions to Edward how to behave in\ncase any troopers should come to the cottage.  He told him to pretend\nthat the children were in bed with the smallpox, as they had done the\nday before.  Jacob then travelled to Gossip Allwood's, and he there\nlearnt that King Charles had been taken prisoner, and was at the Isle of\nWight, and that the troopers were all going back to London as fast as\nthey came.  Feeling that there was now no more danger to be apprehended\nfrom them, Jacob set off as fast as he could for Lymington.  He went to\none shop and purchased two peasant dresses which he thought would fit\nthe two boys, and at another he bought similar apparel for the two\ngirls.  Then with several other ready-made articles, and some other\nthings which were required for the household, he made a large package,\nwhich he put upon the pony, and taking the bridle, set off home, and\narrived in time to superintend the cooking of the dinner, which was this\nday venison-steaks fried in a pan, and boiled potatoes.\n\nWhen dinner was over he opened his bundle, and told the little ones that\nnow they were to live in a cottage they ought to wear cottage clothes,\nand that he had brought them some to put on, which they might rove about\nthe woods in, and not mind tearing them.  Alice and Edith went into the\nbedroom, and Alice dressed Edith and herself, and came out quite pleased\nwith their change of dress.  Humphrey and Edward put theirs on in the\nsitting-room, and they all fitted pretty well, and certainly were very\nbecoming to the children.\n\n\"Now, recollect, you are all my grandchildren,\" said Jacob; \"for I shall\nno longer call you Miss and Master--that we never do in a cottage.  You\nunderstand me, Edward, of course?\" added Jacob.\n\nEdward nodded his head, and Jacob telling the children that they might\nnow go out of the cottage and play, they all set off quite delighted\nwith clothes which procured them their liberty.\n\nWe must now describe the cottage of Jacob Armitage, in which the\nchildren have in future to dwell.  As we said before, it contained a\nlarge sitting-room, or kitchen, in which were a spacious hearth and\nchimney, table, stools, cupboards, and dressers; the two bedrooms which\nadjoined it were now appropriated, one for Jacob and the other for the\ntwo boys; the third, or inner bedroom, was arranged for the two girls,\nas being more retired and secure.  But there were outhouses belonging to\nit: a stall, in which White Billy, the pony, lived during the winter; a\nshed and pigsty rudely constructed, with an enclosed yard attached to\nthem; and it had, moreover, a piece of ground of more than an acre, well\nfenced in to keep out the deer and game, the largest portion of which\nwas cultivated as a garden and potato-ground, and the other, which\nremained in grass, contained some fine old apple and pear trees.  Such\nwas the domicile; the pony, a few fowls, a sow and two young pigs, and\nthe dog Smoker, were the animals on the establishment.  Here Jacob\nArmitage had been born--for the cottage had been built by his\ngrandfather--but he had not always remained at the cottage.  When young,\nhe felt an inclination to see more of the world, and had for several\nyears served in the army.  His father and brother had lived in the\nestablishment at Arnwood, and he was constantly there as a boy.  The\nchaplain of Arnwood had taken a fancy to him, and taught him to read--\nwriting he had not acquired.  As soon as he grew up he served, as we\nhave said, in the troop commanded by Colonel Beverley's father; and\nafter his death, Colonel Beverley had procured him the situation of\nforest ranger, which had been held by his father, who was then alive,\nbut too aged to do the duty.  Jacob Armitage married a good and devout\nyoung woman, with whom he lived several years, when she died, without\nbringing him any family; after which, his father being also dead, Jacob\nArmitage had lived alone until the period at which we have commenced\nthis history.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nThe old forester lay awake the whole of this night, reflecting how he\nshould act relative to the children; he felt the great responsibility\nthat he had incurred, and was alarmed when he considered what might be\nthe consequences if his days were shortened.  What would become of\nthem--living in so sequestered a spot that few knew even of its\nexistence--totally shut out from the world, and left to their own\nresources?  He had no fear, if his life was spared, that they would do\nwell; but if he should be called away before they had grown up and were\nable to help themselves, they might perish.  Edward was not fourteen\nyears old; it was true that he was an active, brave boy, and thoughtful\nfor his years; but he had not yet strength or skill sufficient for what\nwould be required.  Humphrey, the second, also promised well; but still\nthey were all children.  \"I must bring them up to be useful--to depend\nupon themselves; there is not a moment to be lost, and not a moment\nshall be lost; I will do my best, and trust to God; I ask but two or\nthree years, and by that time I trust that they will be able to do\nwithout me.  They must commence to-morrow the life of foresters'\nchildren.\"\n\nActing upon this resolution, Jacob, as soon as the children were dressed\nand in the sitting-room, opened his Bible, which he had put on the\ntable, and said:\n\n\"My dear children, you know that you must remain in this cottage, that\nthe wicked troopers may not find you out; they killed your father, and\nif I had not taken you away, they would have burnt you in your beds.\nYou must therefore live here as my children, and you must call\nyourselves by the name of Armitage, and not that of Beverley; and you\nmust dress like children of the forest, as you do now, and you must do\nas children of the forest do; that is, you must do everything for\nyourselves, for you can have no servants to wait upon you.  We must all\nwork; but you will like to work if you all work together, for then the\nwork will be nothing but play.  Now, Edward is the oldest, and he must\ngo out with me in the forest, and I must teach him to kill deer and\nother game for our support; and when he knows how, then Humphrey shall\ncome out and learn how to shoot.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Humphrey, \"I'll soon learn.\"\n\n\"But not yet, Humphrey, for you must do some work in the meantime; you\nmust look after the pony and the pigs, and you must learn to dig in the\ngarden with Edward and me when we do not go out to hunt; and sometimes I\nshall go by myself, and leave Edward to work with you when there is work\nto be done.  Alice, dear, you must, with Humphrey, light the fire and\nclean the house in the morning.  Humphrey will go to the spring for\nwater, and do all the hard work; and you must learn to wash, my dear\nAlice--I will show you how; and you must learn to get dinner ready with\nHumphrey, who will assist you; and to make the beds.  And little Edith\nshall take care of the fowls, and feed them every morning, and look for\nthe eggs--will you, Edith?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Edith, \"and feed all the little chickens when they are\nhatched, as I did at Arnwood.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, and you'll be very useful.  Now you know that you cannot do\nall this at once.  You will have to try and try again; but very soon you\nwill, and then it will be all play.  I must teach you all, and every day\nyou will do it better, till you want no teaching at all.  And now, my\ndear children, as there is no chaplain here, we must read the Bible\nevery morning.  Edward can read, I know; can you, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"Yes, all except the big words.\"\n\n\"Well, you will learn them by and by.  And Edward and I will teach Alice\nand Edith to read in the evenings, when we have nothing to do.  It will\nbe an amusement.  Now tell me, do you all like what I have told you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they all replied; and then Jacob Armitage read a chapter in the\nBible, after which they all knelt down and said the Lord's Prayer.  As\nthis was done every morning and every evening, I need not repeat it\nagain.  Jacob then showed them again how to clean the house, and\nHumphrey and Alice soon finished their work under his directions; and\nthen they all sat down to breakfast, which was a very plain one, being\ngenerally cold meat, and cakes baked on the embers, at which Alice was\nsoon very expert; and little Edith was very useful in watching them for\nher, while she busied herself about her other work.  But the venison was\nnearly all gone; and after breakfast Jacob and Edward, with the dog\nSmoker, went out into the woods.  Edward had no gun, as he only went out\nto be taught how to approach the game, which required great caution;\nindeed Jacob had no second gun to give him, if he had wished so to do.\n\n\"Now, Edward, we are going after a fine stag, if we can find him--which\nI doubt not--but the difficulty is to get within shot of him.  Recollect\nthat you must always be hid, for his sight is very quick; never be\nheard, for his ear is sharp; and never come down to him with the wind,\nfor his scent is very fine.  Then you must hunt according to the hour of\nthe day.  At this time he is feeding; two hours hence he will be lying\ndown in the high fern.  The dog is of no use unless the stag is badly\nwounded, when the dog will take him.  Smoker knows his duty well, and\nwill hide himself as close as we do.  We are now going into the thick\nwood ahead of us, as there are many little spots of cleared ground in it\nwhere we may find the deer; but we must keep more to the left, for the\nwind is to the eastward, and we must walk up against it.  And now that\nwe are coming into the wood, recollect, not a word must be said, and you\nmust walk as quietly as possible, keeping behind me.  Smoker, to heel!\"\nThey proceeded through the wood for more than a mile, when Jacob made a\nsign to Edward, and dropped down into the fern, crawling along to an\nopen spot, where, at some distance, were a stag and three deer grazing.\nThe deer grazed quietly, but the stag was ever and anon raising up his\nhead and snuffing the air as he looked round, evidently acting as a\nsentinel for the females.\n\nThe stag was perhaps a long quarter of a mile from where they had\ncrouched down in the fern.  Jacob remained immovable till the animal\nbegan to feed again, and then he advanced crawling through the fern,\nfollowed by Edward and the dog, who dragged himself on his stomach after\nEdward.  This tedious approach was continued for some time, and they had\nneared the stag to within half the original distance, when the animal\nagain lifted up his head and appeared uneasy.  Jacob stopped and\nremained without motion.  After a time the stag walked away, followed by\nthe does, to the opposite side of the clear spot on which they had been\nfeeding, and, to Edward's annoyance, the animal was now half a mile from\nthem.  Jacob turned round and crawled into the wood, and when he knew\nthat they were concealed he rose on his feet and said:\n\n\"You see, Edward, that it requires patience to stalk a deer.  What a\nprincely fellow!  But he has probably been alarmed this morning, and is\nvery uneasy.  Now we must go through the woods till we come to the lee\nof him on the other side of the dell.  You see he has led the does close\nto the thicket, and we shall have a better chance when we get there, if\nwe are only quiet and cautious.\"\n\n\"What startled him, do you think?\" said Edward.\n\n\"I think, when you were crawling through the fern after me, you broke a\npiece of rotten stick that was under you, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that made but little noise.\"\n\n\"Quite enough to startle a red deer, Edward, as you will find out before\nyou have been long a forester.  These checks will happen, and have\nhappened to me a hundred times, and then all the work is to be done over\nagain.  Now then to make the circuit--we had better not say a word.  If\nwe get safe now to the other side we are sure of him.\"\n\nThey proceeded at a quick walk through the forest, and in half an hour\nhad gained the side where the deer were feeding.  When about three\nhundred yards from the game, Jacob again sank down on his hands and\nknees, crawling from bush to bush, stopping whenever the stag raised his\nhead, and advancing again when it resumed feeding; at last they came to\nthe fern at the side of the wood, and crawled through it as before, but\nstill more cautiously as they approached the stag.  In this manner they\narrived at last to within eighty yards of the animal, and then Jacob\nadvanced his gun ready to put it to his shoulder, and as he cocked the\nlock, raised himself to fire.  The click occasioned by the cocking of\nthe lock roused up the stag instantly, and he turned his head in the\ndirection from whence the noise proceeded; as he did so Jacob fired,\naiming behind the animal's shoulder: the stag made a bound, came down\nagain, dropped on his knees, attempted to run, and fell dead, while the\ndoes fled away with the rapidity of the wind.\n\nEdward started up on his legs with a shout of exultation.  Jacob\ncommenced reloading his gun, and stopped Edward as he was about to run\nup to where the animal lay.\n\n\"Edward, you must learn your craft,\" said Jacob; \"never do that again;\nnever shout in that way--on the contrary, you should have remained still\nin the fern.\"\n\n\"Why so?  The stag is dead.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear boy, that stag is dead; but how do you know but what there\nmay be another lying down in the fern close to us, or at some distance\nfrom us, which you have alarmed by your shout?  Suppose that we both had\nhad guns, and that the report of mine had started another stag lying in\nthe fern within shot, you would have been able to shoot it; or if a stag\nwas lying at a distance, the report of the gun might have startled him\nso as to induce him to move his head without rising.  I should have seen\nhis antlers move and have marked his lair, and we should then have gone\nafter him and stalked him too.\"\n\n\"I see,\" replied Edward, \"I was wrong; but I shall know better another\ntime.\"\n\n\"That's why I tell you, my boy,\" replied Jacob; \"now let us go to our\nquarry.  Ay, Edward, this is a noble beast.  I thought that he was a\nhart royal, and so he is.\"\n\n\"What is a hart royal, Jacob?\"\n\n\"Why, a stag is called a brocket until he is three years old; at four\nyears he is a staggart; at five years a warrantable stag; and after five\nyears he becomes a hart royal.\"\n\n\"And how do you know his age?\"\n\n\"By his antlers: you see that this stag has nine antlers; now, a brocket\nhas but two antlers, a staggart three, and a warrantable stag but four;\nat six years old, the antlers increase in number until they sometimes\nhave twenty or thirty.  This is a fine beast, and the venison is now\ngetting very good.  Now you must see me do the work of my craft.\"\n\nJacob then cut the throat of the animal, and afterwards cut off its\nhead, and took out its bowels.\n\n\"Are you tired, Edward?\" said Jacob, as he wiped his hunting-knife on\nthe coat of the stag.\n\n\"No, not the least.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we are now, I should think, about four or five miles from\nthe cottage.  Could you find your way home?  But that is of no\nconsequence, Smoker will lead you home by the shortest path.  I will\nstay here, and you can saddle White Billy and come back with him, for he\nmust carry the venison back.  It's more than we can manage--indeed, as\nmuch as we can manage with White Billy to help us.  There's more than\ntwenty stone of venison lying there, I can tell you.\"\n\nEdward immediately assented, and Jacob desiring Smoker to go home, set\nabout flaying and cutting up the animal for its more convenient\ntransportation.  In an hour and a half Edward, attended by Smoker,\nreturned with the pony, on whose back the chief portion of the venison\nwas packed.  Jacob took a large piece on his own shoulders, and Edward\ncarried another, and Smoker, after regaling himself with a portion of\nthe inside of the animal, came after them.  During the walk home Jacob\ninitiated Edward into the terms of venery and many other points\nconnected with deer-stalking, with which we shall not trouble our\nreaders.  As soon as they arrived at the cottage the venison was hung\nup, the pony put in the stable, and then they sat down to dinner with an\nexcellent appetite after their long morning's walk.  Alice and Humphrey\nhad cooked the dinner themselves, and it was in the pot, smoking hot,\nwhen they returned; and Jacob declared he never ate a better mess in his\nlife.  Alice was not a little proud of this, and of the praises she\nreceived from Edward and the old forester.  The next day Jacob stated\nhis intention of going to Lymington to dispose of a large portion of the\nvenison, and bring back a sack of oatmeal for their cakes.  Edward asked\nto accompany him, but Jacob replied:\n\n\"Edward, you must not think of showing yourself at Lymington, or\nanywhere else, for a long while, until you are grown out of memory.  It\nwould be folly, and you would risk your sisters' and brother's lives,\nperhaps, as well as your own.  Never mention it again: the time will\ncome when it will be necessary, perhaps; if so, it cannot be helped.  At\npresent you would be known immediately.  No, Edward, I tell you what I\ndo mean to do: I have a little money left, and I intend to buy you a\ngun, that you may learn to stalk deer yourself without me: for\nrecollect, if any accident should happen to me, who is there but you to\nprovide for your brother and sisters?  At Lymington I am known to many;\nbut out of all who know me, there is not one who knows where my cottage\nis; they know that I live in the New Forest, and that I supply them\nvenison, and purchase other articles in return.  That is all that they\nknow; and I may therefore go without fear.  I shall sell the venison\nto-morrow, and bring you back a good gun; and Humphrey shall have the\ncarpenters' tools which he wishes for--for I think, by what he does with\nhis knife, that he has a turn that way, and it may be useful.  I must\nalso get some other tools for Humphrey and you, as we shall then be able\nto work all together; and some threads and needles for Alice, for she\ncan sew a little, and practice will make her more perfect.\"\n\nJacob went off to Lymington as he had proposed, and returned late at\nnight with White Billy well loaded; he had a sack of oatmeal, some\nspades and hoes, a saw and chisels, and other tools; two scythes and two\nthree-pronged forks; and when Edward came to meet him he put into his\nhand a gun with a very long barrel.\n\n\"I believe, Edward, that you will find that a good one, for I know where\nit came from.  It belonged to one of the rangers, who was reckoned the\nbest shot in the forest.  I know the gun, for I have seen it on his arm,\nand have taken it in my hand to examine it more than once.  He was\nkilled at Naseby, with your father, poor fellow!  And his widow sold the\ngun to meet her wants.\"\n\n\"Well!\" replied Edward, \"I thank you much, Jacob, and I will try if I\ncannot kill as much venison as will pay back the purchase-money--I will,\nI assure you.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad if you do, Edward; not because I want the money back,\nbut because then I shall be more easy in my mind about you all, if\nanything happens to me.  As soon as you are perfect in your woodcraft, I\nshall take Humphrey in hand, for there is nothing like having two\nstrings to your bow.  To-morrow we will not go out: we have meat enough\nfor three weeks or more; and now the frost has set in, it will keep\nwell.  You shall practise at a mark with your gun, that you may be\naccustomed to it: for all guns, even the best, require a little\nhumouring.\"\n\nEdward, who had often fired a gun before, proved the next morning that\nhe had a very good eye; and after two or three hours' practice, hit the\nmark at a hundred yards almost every time.\n\n\"I wish you would let me go out by myself,\" said Edward, overjoyed at\nhis success.\n\n\"You would bring home nothing, boy,\" replied Jacob.  \"No, no, you have a\ngreat deal to learn yet; but I tell you what you shall do: any time that\nwe are not in great want of venison, you shall have the first fire.\"\n\n\"Well, that will do,\" replied Edward.\n\nThe winter now set in with great severity, and they remained almost\naltogether within doors.  Jacob and the boys went out to get firewood,\nand dragged it home through the snow.\n\n\"I wish, Jacob,\" said Humphrey, \"that I was able to build a cart, for it\nwould be very useful, and White Bill would then have something to do;\nbut I can't make the wheels, and there is no harness.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea of yours, Humphrey,\" replied Jacob; \"we will\nthink about it.  If you can't build a cart, perhaps I can buy one.  It\nwould be useful if it were only to take the dung out of the yard on the\npotato-ground; for I have hitherto carried it out in baskets, and it's\nhard work.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we might saw the wood into billets, and carry it home in the\ncart instead of dragging it this way: my shoulder is quite sore with the\nrope, it cuts me so.\"\n\n\"Well, when the weather breaks up, I will see what I can do, Humphrey;\nbut just now the roads are so blocked up, that I do not think we could\nget a cart from Lymington to the cottage, although we can a horse,\nperhaps.\"\n\nBut if they remained indoors during the inclement weather, they were not\nidle.  Jacob took this opportunity to instruct the children in\neverything.  Alice learnt how to wash and how to cook.  It is true that\nsometimes she scalded herself a little, sometimes burnt her fingers; and\nother accidents did occur, from the articles employed being too heavy\nfor them to lift by themselves; but practice and dexterity compensated\nfor want of strength, and fewer accidents happened every day.  Humphrey\nhad his carpenters' tools; and although at first he had many failures,\nand wasted nails and wood, by degrees he learnt to use his tools with\nmore dexterity, and made several little useful articles.  Little Edith\ncould now do something, for she made and baked all the oatmeal cakes,\nwhich saved Alice a good deal of time and trouble in watching them.  It\nwas astonishing how much the children could do, now that there was no\none to do it for them; and they had daily instruction from Jacob.  In\nthe evening Alice sat down with her needle and thread to mend the\nclothes; at first they were not very well done; but she improved every\nday.  Edith and Humphrey learnt to read while Alice worked, and then\nAlice learnt; and thus passed the winter away so rapidly, that although\nthey had been five months at the cottage, it did not appear as if they\nhad been there as many weeks.  All were happy and contented, with the\nexception, perhaps, of Edward, who had fits of gloominess, and\noccasionally showed signs of impatience as to what was passing in the\nworld, of which he remained in ignorance.\n\nThat Edward Beverley had fits of gloominess and impatience is not\nsurprising.  Edward had been brought up as the heir of Arnwood; and a\nboy at a very early age imbibes notions of his position, if it promises\nto be a high one.  He was not two miles from that property which by\nright was his own.  His own mansion had been reduced to ashes--he\nhimself was hidden in the forest, and he could not but feel his\nposition.  He sighed for the time when the king's cause should be again\ntriumphant, and his arrival at that age when he could in person support\nand uphold the cause.  He longed to be in command as his father had\nbeen--to lead his men on to victory--to recover his property, and to\nrevenge himself on those who had acted so cruelly towards him.  This was\nhuman nature; and much as Jacob Armitage would expostulate with him, and\ntry to divert his feelings into other channels; long as he would preach\nto him about forgiveness of injuries, and patience until better times\nshould come, Edward could not help brooding over these thoughts, and if\never there was a breast animated with intense hatred against the\nPuritans it was that of Edward Beverley.  Although this was to be\nlamented, it could not create surprise or wonder in the old forester.\nAll he could do was, as much as possible to reason with him, to soothe\nhis irritated feelings, and by constant employment try to make him\nforget for a time the feelings of ill-will which he had conceived.\n\nOne thing was, however, sufficiently plain to Edward, which was, that\nwhatever might be his wrongs, he had not the power at present to redress\nthem; and this feeling, perhaps, more than any other, held him in some\nsort of check; and as the time when he might have an opportunity\nappeared far distant, even to his own sanguine imagination, so by\ndegrees did he contrive to dismiss from his thoughts what it was no use\nto think about at present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nAs we have before said, time passed rapidly; with the exception of one\nor two excursions after venison, they remained in the cottage, and Jacob\nnever went to Lymington.  The frost had broken up, the snow had long\ndisappeared, and the trees began to bud.  The sun became powerful, and\nin the month of May the forest began again to look green.\n\n\"And now, Edward,\" said Jacob Armitage, one day at breakfast, \"we will\ntry for venison again to sell at Lymington, for I must purchase\nHumphrey's cart and harness; so let us get our guns, and go out this\nfine morning.  The stags are mostly by themselves at this season, for\nthe does are with their young calves.  We must find the slot of a deer,\nand track him to his lair, and you shall have the first shot if you\nlike; but that, however, depends more upon the deer than upon me.\"\n\nThey had walked four or five miles when they came upon the slot or track\nof a deer, but Jacob's practised eye pointed out to Edward that it was\nthe slot of a young one, and not worth following.  He explained to\nEdward the difference in the hoof-marks and other signs by which this\nknowledge was gained, and they proceeded onwards until they found\nanother slot, which Jacob declared to be that of a warrantable stag--\nthat is, one old enough to kill and to be good venison.\n\n\"We must now track him to his lair, Edward.\"\n\nThis took them about a mile farther, when they arrived at a small\nthicket of thorns about an acre in extent.\n\n\"Here he is, you see, Edward; let me now see if he is harboured.\"\n\nThey walked round the thicket, and could not find any slot or track by\nwhich the stag had left the covert, and Jacob pronounced that the animal\nmust be hid in it.\n\n\"Now, Edward, do you stay here while I go back to the lee side of the\ncovert: I will enter it with Smoker, and the stag will, in all\nprobability, when he is roused, come out to breast the wind.  You will\nthen have a good shot at him; recollect to fire so as to hit him behind\nthe shoulder: if he is moving quick, fire a little before the shoulders;\nif slow, take aim accurately; but recollect, if I come upon him in the\ncovert, I shall kill him if I can, for we want the venison, and then we\nwill go after another to give you a chance.\"\n\nJacob then left Edward, and went down to the lee side of the covert,\nwhere he entered it with Smoker.  Edward was stationed behind a\nthorn-bush, which grew a few yards clear of the covert, and he soon\nheard the creaking of the branches.\n\nA short time elapsed, and a fine stag came out at a trot; he turned his\nhead, and was just bounding away, when Edward fired, and the animal\nfell.  Remembering the advice of Jacob, Edward remained where he was, in\nsilence reloading his piece, and was soon afterwards joined by Jacob and\nthe dog.\n\n\"Well done, Edward!\" said the forester in a low voice, and covering his\nforehead to keep off the glare of the sun, he looked earnestly at a high\nbrake between some thorn-trees, about half a mile to windward.  \"I think\nI see something there--look, Edward, your eyes are younger than mine.\nIs that the branch of a tree in the fern, or is it not?\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" replied Edward.  \"It is not, it moves.\"\n\n\"I thought so, but my eyes are not so good as they once were.  It's\nanother stag, depend upon it; but how to get near him?  We never can get\nacross this patch of clear grass without being seen.\"\n\n\"No, we cannot get at him from this spot,\" replied Edward; \"but if we\nwere to fall back to leeward, and gain the forest again, I think that\nthere are thorns sufficient from the forest to where he lies, to creep\nfrom behind one to the other, so as to get a shot at him; don't you?\"\n\n\"It will require care and patience to manage that; but I think it might\nbe done.  I will try; it is my turn now, you know.  You had better stay\nhere with the dog, for only one can hide from thorn to thorn.\"\n\nJacob, ordering Smoker to remain, then set off.  He had to make a\ncircuit of three miles to get to the spot where the thorns extended from\nthe forest, and Edward saw no more of him, although he strained his\neyes, until the stag sprung out, and the gun was discharged.  Edward\nperceived that the stag was not killed, but severely wounded, running\ntowards the covert near which he was hid.  \"Down, Smoker,\" said he, as\nhe cocked his gun.  The stag came within shot, and was coming nearer\nwhen, seeing Edward, it turned.  Edward fired, and then cheered on the\ndog, who sprang after the wounded animal, giving tongue, as he followed\nhim.  Edward, perceiving Jacob hastening towards him, waited for him.\n\n\"He's hard hit, Edward,\" cried Jacob, \"and Smoker will have him; but we\nmust follow as fast as we can.\"\n\nThey both caught up their guns and ran as fast as they could, when, as\nthey entered the wood, they heard the dog at bay.\n\n\"We shan't have far to go, Edward; the animal is done up, Smoker has him\nat bay.\"\n\nThey hastened on another quarter of a mile, when they found that the\nstag had fallen on his knees, and had been seized by the throat by\nSmoker.\n\n\"Mind, Edward, now, how I go up to him, for the wound from the horn of\nthe deer is very dangerous.\"\n\nJacob advanced from behind the stag, and cut his throat with his\nhunting-knife.  \"He is a fine beast, and we have done well to-day; but\nwe shall have two journeys to make to get all this venison home.  I\ncould not get a fair shot at him--and see, I have hit him here in the\nflank.\"\n\n\"And here is my ball in his throat,\" said Edward.\n\n\"So it is.  Then it was a good shot that you made, and you are master of\nthe hunt this day, Edward.  Now, I'll remain, and you go home for White\nBilly; Humphrey is right about the cart.  If we had one, we could have\ncarried all home at once; but I must go now and cut the throat of the\nother stag which you killed so cleverly.  You will be a good hunter one\nof these days, Edward.  A little more knowledge, and a little more\npractice, and I will leave it all to you, and hang my gun up over the\nchimney.\"\n\nIt was late in the evening before they had made their two trips and\ntaken all the venison home, and very tired were they before it was all\nsafely housed.  Edward was delighted with his success, but not more so\nthan was old Jacob.  The next morning Jacob set off for Lymington, with\nthe pony loaded with venison, which he sold, as well as two more loads\nwhich he promised to bring the next day, and the day after.  He then\nlooked out for a cart, and was fortunate in finding a small one just\nfitted to the size of the pony, who was not tall, but very strong, as\nall New Forest ponies are.  He also procured harness, and then put Billy\nin the cart to draw him home; but Billy did not admire being put in a\ncart, and for some time was very restive, and backed and reared, and\nwent every way but the right; but by dint of coaxing and leading, he at\nlast submitted, and went straight on: but then the noise of the cart\nbehind him frightened him, and he ran away.  At last, having tired\nhimself out, he thought that he might as well go quietly in harness, as\nhe could not get out of it; and he did so, and arrived safe at the\ncottage.  Humphrey was delighted at the sight of the cart, and said that\nnow they should get on well.  The next day Jacob contrived to put all\nthe remainder of the venison in the cart, and White Billy made no more\ndifficulty; he dragged it all to Lymington, and returned with the cart\nas quietly and cleverly as if he had been in harness all his life.\n\n\"Well, Edward, the venison paid for the cart, at all events,\" said\nJacob, \"and now, I will tell you all the news I collected while I was at\nLymington.  Captain Burly, who attempted to incite the people to rescue\nthe king, has been hung, drawn, and quartered, as a traitor.\"\n\n\"They are traitors who condemned him,\" replied Edward in wrath.\n\n\"Yes, so they are; but there is better news, which is, that the Duke of\nYork has escaped to Holland.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is good news; and the king?\"\n\n\"He is still a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle.  There are many rumours\nand talks, but no one knows what is true and what is false; but depend\nupon it, this cannot last long, and the king will have his rights yet.\"\n\nEdward remained very grave for some time.\n\n\"I trust in heaven we all shall have our rights yet, Jacob,\" said he at\nlast.  \"I wish I was a man!\"\n\nHere the conversation ended, and they went to bed.\n\nThis was now a busy time at the cottage.  The manure had to be got out\nof the stable and pigsties, and carried out to the potato-ground and\ngarden; the crops had to be put in; and the cart was now found valuable.\nAfter the manure had been carried out and spread, Edward and Humphrey\nhelped Jacob to dig the ground, and then to put in the seed.  The\ncabbage-plants of last year were then put out, and the turnips and\ncarrots sown.  Before the month was over the garden and potato-field\nwere cropped, and Humphrey took upon himself to weed and keep it clean.\nLittle Edith had also employment now; for the hens began to lay eggs,\nand as soon as she heard them cackling, she ran for the eggs and brought\nthem in; and before the month was over Jacob had set four hens upon\neggs.  Billy, the pony, was now turned out to graze in the forest; he\ncame home every night of his own accord.\n\n\"I'll tell you what we want,\" said Humphrey, who took the command\naltogether over the farm; \"we want a cow.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, a cow,\" cried Alice; \"I have plenty of time to milk her.\"\n\n\"Whose cows are those which I see in the forest sometimes?\" said\nHumphrey to Jacob.\n\n\"If they belong to anybody, they belong to the king,\" replied Jacob;\n\"but they are cattle which have strayed and found their way to the\nforest, and have remained here ever since.  They are rather wild and\nsavage, and you must be careful how you go too near them, as the bulls\nwill run at you.  They increase very fast: there were but six a few\nyears ago, and now there are at least fifty in the herd.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll try and get one, if I can,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"You will be puzzled to do that, boy,\" replied Jacob, \"and as I said\nbefore, beware of the bulls.\"\n\n\"I don't want a bull,\" replied Humphrey; \"but a cow would give us milk,\nand then we should have more manure for the garden.  My garden will then\ngrow more potatoes.\"\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, if you can catch a cow, no one will interfere; but I\nthink you will not find it very easy, and you may find it very\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"I'll look-out for one,\" replied Humphrey, \"anyhow.  Alice, if we only\nhad a cow, wouldn't that be jolly?\"\n\nThe crops were now all up, and as the days began to be long, the work\nbecame comparatively light and easy.  Humphrey was busy making a little\nwheelbarrow for Edith, that she might barrow away the weeds as he hoed\nthem up; and at last this great performance was completed, much to the\nadmiration of all, and much to his own satisfaction.  Indeed, when it is\nrecollected that Humphrey had only the hand-saw and axe, and that he had\nto cut down the tree, and then to saw it into plank, it must be\nacknowledged that it required great patience and perseverance even to\nmake a wheelbarrow; but Humphrey was not only persevering, but was full\nof invention.  He had built up a hen-house with fir poles, and made the\nnests for the hens to lay and hatch in, and they now had between forty\nand fifty chickens running about.  He had also divided the pigsty, so\nthat the sow might be kept apart from the other pigs; and they expected\nvery soon to have a litter of young pigs.  He had transplanted the wild\nstrawberries from the forest, and had by manure made them large and\ngood; and he had also a fine crop of onions in the garden, from seed\nwhich Jacob had bought at Lymington; now Humphrey was very busy cutting\ndown some poles in the forest to make a cow-house, for he declared that\nhe would have a cow somehow or another.  June arrived, and it was time\nto mow down grass to make into hay for the winter, and Jacob had two\nscythes.  He showed the boys how to use them, and they soon became\nexpert; and as there was plenty of long grass at this time of the year,\nand they could mow when they pleased, they soon had White Billy in full\nemployment carrying the hay home.  The little girls helped to make it,\nfor Humphrey had made them two rakes.  Jacob thought that there was hay\nenough made, but Humphrey said that there was enough for the pony, but\nnot enough for the cow.\n\n\"But where is the cow to come from, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"Where the venison comes from,\" replied he,--\"out of the forest.\"\n\nSo Humphrey continued to mow and make hay, while Edward and Jacob went\nout for venison.  After all the hay was made and stacked, Humphrey found\nout a method of thatching with fern, which Jacob had never thought of;\nand when that was done, they commenced cutting down fern for fodder.\nHere again Humphrey would have twice as much as Jacob had ever cut\nbefore, because he wanted litter for the cow.  At last it became quite a\njoke between him and Edward, who, when he brought home more venison than\nwould keep in the hot weather, told Humphrey that the remainder was for\nthe cow.  Still Humphrey would not give up the point, and every morning\nand evening he would be certain to be absent an hour or two, and it was\nfound out he was watching the herd of wild cattle who were feeding:\nsometimes they were very near, at others a long way off.  He used to get\nup into the trees, and examine them as they passed under him, without\nperceiving him.  One night Humphrey returned very late, and the next\nmorning he was off before daylight.  Breakfast was over, and Humphrey\ndid not make his appearance, and they could not tell what was the\nmatter.  Jacob felt uneasy, but Edward laughed, and said:\n\n\"Oh, depend upon it, he'll come back and bring the cow with him.\"\n\nHardly had Edward said these words when in came Humphrey red with\nperspiration.\n\n\"Now then, Jacob and Edward, come with me; we must put Billy in the\ncart, and take Smoker and a rope with us.  Take your guns too, for fear\nof accident.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you as we go along, but I must put Billy in the cart, for\nthere is no time to be lost.\"\n\nHumphrey disappeared, and Jacob said to Edward, \"What can it be?\"\n\n\"It can be nothing but the cow he is so mad about,\" replied Edward.\n\"However, when he comes with the pony, we shall know; let us take our\nguns and the dog Smoker as he wishes.\"\n\nHumphrey now drove up the pony and cart, and they set off.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you'll tell us now what we are going for?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes, I will.  You know I've been watching the cattle for a long while,\nbecause I wanted a cow.  I have been in a tree when they have passed\nunder me several times, and I observed that one or two of the heifers\nwere very near calving.  Yesterday evening I thought one could not help\ncalving very soon indeed, and as I was watching I saw that she was\nuneasy, and that she at last left the herd and went into a little copse\nof wood.  I remained three hours to see if she came out again, and she\ndid not.  It was dark when I came home, as you know.  This morning I\nwent before daylight and found the herd.  She is very remarkable, being\nblack and white spotted; and, after close examination, I found that she\nwas not with the herd, so I am sure that she went into the copse to\ncalve, and that she has calved before this.\"\n\n\"Well, that may be,\" replied Jacob; \"but now I do not understand what we\nare to do.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Well then, I'll tell you what I hope to do.  I have got the pony and\ncart to take the calf home with us, if we can get it--which I think we\ncan.  I have got Smoker to worry the heifer and keep her employed while\nwe put the calf in the cart; a rope that we may tie the cow, if we can;\nand you with your guns must keep off the herd, if they come to her\nassistance.  Now do you understand my plan?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I think it very likely to succeed, Humphrey,\" replied Jacob,\n\"and I give you credit for the scheme.  We will help you all we can.\nWhere is the copse?\"\n\n\"Not half a mile farther,\" replied Humphrey.  \"We shall soon be there.\"\n\nOn their arrival they found that the herd were feeding at a considerable\ndistance from the copse, which was perhaps as well.\n\n\"Now,\" said Jacob, \"I and Edward will enter into the copse with Smoker,\nand you follow us, Humphrey.  I will make Smoker seize the heifer if\nnecessary; at all events, he will keep her at bay--that is, if she is\nhere.  First let us walk round the copse and find her _slot_ as we call\nthe track of a deer.  See, here is her footing.  Now let us go in.\"\n\nThey advanced cautiously into the thicket, following the track of the\nheifer, and at last came upon her.  Apparently she had not calved more\nthan an hour, and was licking the calf which was not yet on its legs.\nAs soon as the animal perceived Jacob and Edward, she shook her head,\nand was about to run at them; but Jacob told Smoker to seize her, and\nthe dog flew at her immediately.  The attack of the dog drove back the\nheifer quite into the thicket, and as the dog bounded round her,\nspringing this way and that way to escape her horns, the heifer was soon\nseparated from the calf.\n\n\"Now then, Edward and Humphrey,\" said Jacob, advancing between the\nheifer and the calf, \"lift up the calf between you and put it in the\ncart.  Leave Smoker and me to manage the mother.\"\n\nThe boys put their arms under the stomach of the calf, and carried it\naway.  The heifer was at first too busy defending herself against the\ndog to perceive that the calf was gone; when she did Jacob called Smoker\nto him, so as to bring him between the heifer and where the boys were\ngoing out of the thicket.  At last the heifer gave a loud bellow, and\nrushed out of the thicket in pursuit of her calf checked by Smoker, who\nheld on to her ear, and sometimes stopped her from advancing.\n\n\"Hold her, Smoker,\" said Jacob, who now went back to help the boys.\n\"Hold her, boy.  Is the calf in the cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, and tied fast,\" replied Edward, \"and we are in the cart too.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied Jacob.  \"Now I'll get in too, and let us drive\noff.  She'll follow us, depend upon it.  Here, Smoker!  Smoker!  Let her\nalone.\"\n\nSmoker, at this command, came bounding out of the copse, followed by the\nheifer, lowing most anxiously.  Her lowing was responded to by the calf\nin the cart, and she ran wildly up to it.\n\n\"Drive off, Humphrey,\" said Jacob; \"I think I heard the lowing of the\nheifer answered by some of the herd, and the sooner we are off the\nbetter.\"\n\nHumphrey, who had the reins, drove off; the heifer followed, at one time\nrunning at the dog, at another putting her head almost into the hind\npart of the cart; but the lowing of the heifer was now answered by\ndeeper tones, and Jacob said:\n\n\"Edward, get your gun ready, for I think the herd is following.  Do not\nfire, however, till I tell you.  We must be governed by circumstances.\nIt won't do to lose the pony, or to run any serious risk, for the sake\nof the heifer and calf.  Drive fast, Humphrey.\"\n\nA few minutes afterwards they perceived at about a quarter of a mile\nbehind them, not the whole herd, but a single bull, who was coming up at\na fast trot, with his tail in the air, and tossing his head, lowing\ndeeply in answer to the heifer.\n\n\"There's only one, after all,\" said Jacob; \"I suppose the heifer is his\nfavourite.  Well, we can manage him.  Smoker, come in.  Come in, sir,\ndirectly,\" cried Jacob, perceiving that the dog was about to attack the\nbull.\n\nSmoker obeyed, and the bull advanced till he was within a hundred yards.\n\n\"Now, Edward, do you fire first--aim for his shoulder.  Humphrey, pull\nup.\"\n\nHumphrey stopped the pony, and the bull continued to advance, but seemed\npuzzled who to attack, unless it was the dog.  As soon as the bull was\nwithin sixty yards, Edward fired, and the animal fell down on its knees,\ntearing the ground with its horns.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Jacob; \"drive on again, Humphrey; we will have a\nlook at that fellow by and by.  At present we had better get home, as\nothers may come.  He's up again, but he is at a standstill.  I have an\nidea that he is hit hard.\"\n\nThe cart drove on, followed by the heifer; but no more of the wild herd\nmade their appearance, and they very soon gained the cottage.\n\n\"Now, then, what shall we do?\" said Jacob.  \"Come, Humphrey, you have\nhad all the ordering of this, and have done it well.\"\n\n\"Well, Jacob, we must now drive the cart into the yard, and shut the\ngate upon the cow, till I am ready.\"\n\n\"That's easy done, by setting Smoker at her,\" replied Jacob; \"but, mercy\non us, there's Alice and Edith running out!--the heifer may kill them.\nGo back, Alice, run quite into the cottage, and shut the door till we\ncome.\"\n\nAlice and Edith hearing this, and Edward also crying out to them, made a\nhasty retreat to the cottage.  Humphrey then backed the cart against the\npaling of the yard, so as to enable Edward to get on the other side of\nit, ready to open the gate.  Smoker was set at the heifer, and, as\nbefore, soon engaged her attention; so that the gate was opened and the\ncart drove in, and the gate closed again, before the heifer could\nfollow.\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, what next?\"\n\n\"Why, now lift the calf out and put it into the cow-house.  I will go\ninto the cow-house with a rope and a slip-knot at the end of it, get\nupon the beam above, and drop it over her horns as she's busy with the\ncalf, which she will be as soon as you let her in.  I shall pass the end\nof the rope outside, for you to haul up when I am ready, and then we\nshall have her fast, till we can secure her properly.  When I call out\n`ready,' do you open the gate and let her in.  You can do that and jump\ninto the cart afterwards, for fear she may run at you; but I don't think\nthat she will, for it's the calf she wants, and not either of you.\"\n\nAs soon as Humphrey was ready with the rope he gave the word, and the\ngate was opened; the cow ran in immediately, and hearing her calf bleat,\nwent into the cow-house, the door of which was shut upon her.  A minute\nafterwards Humphrey cried out to them to haul upon the rope, which they\ndid.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Humphrey from the inside; \"now make the rope fast,\nand then you may come in.\"\n\nThey went in, and found the heifer drawn close to the side of the\ncow-house by the rope which was round her horns, and unable to move her\nhead.\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, that's very clever; but now what's to be done?\"\n\n\"First I'll saw off the tips of her horns, and then if she does run at\nus, she won't hurt us much.  Wait till I go for the saw.\"\n\nAs soon as the ends of her horns were sawed off, Humphrey took another\npiece of rope, which he fastened securely round her horns, and then made\nthe other end fast to the side of the building, so that the animal could\nmove about a little and eat out of the crib.\n\n\"There,\" said Humphrey, \"now time and patience must do the rest.  We\nmust coax her and handle her, and we soon shall tame her.  At present\nlet us leave her with the calf.  She has a yard of rope, and that is\nenough for her to lick her calf, which is all that she requires at\npresent.  To-morrow we will cut some grass for her.\"\n\nThey then went out, shutting the cow-house door.\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, you've beat us after all, and have the laugh on your\nside now,\" said Jacob.  \"`Where there's a will, there's a way,' that's\ncertain; and I assure you, that when you were making so much hay, and\ngathering so much litter, and building a cow-house, I had no more idea\nthat we should have a cow than that we should have an elephant; and I\nwill say that you deserve great credit for your way of obtaining it.\"\n\n\"That he certainly does,\" replied Edward.  \"You have more genius than I\nhave, brother.  But dinner must be ready, if Alice has done her duty.\nWhat think you, Jacob, shall we after dinner go and look after that\nbull?\"\n\n\"Yes, by all means.  He will not be had eating, and I can sell all I can\ncarry in the cart at Lymington.  Besides, the skin is worth money.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nAlice and Edith were very anxious to see the cow, and especially to see\nthe calf; but Humphrey told them that they must not go near till he went\nwith them, and then they should see it.  After dinner was over, Jacob\nand Edward took their guns, and Humphrey put Billy in the cart, and\nfollowed them.  They found the bull where they left him, standing quite\nstill; he tossed his head when they approached him, which they did\ncarefully, but he did not attempt to run at them.\n\n\"It's my idea that he has nearly bled to death,\" said Jacob; \"but\nthere's nothing like making sure.  Edward, put a bullet just three\ninches behind his shoulder, and that will make all safe.\"\n\nEdward did so, and the animal fell dead.  They went up to the carcass,\nwhich they estimated to weigh at least fifty stone.\n\n\"It is a noble beast,\" said Edward; \"I wonder we never thought of\nkilling one before.\"\n\n\"They ain't game, Edward,\" replied Jacob.\n\n\"No, they are not now, Jacob,\" said Humphrey; \"as you and Edward claim\nall the game, I shall claim the cattle as my portion of the forest.\nRecollect, there are more, and I mean to have more of them yet.\"\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, I give you up all my rights, if I have any.\"\n\n\"And I all mine,\" added Edward.\n\n\"Be it so.  Some day you'll see what I shall do,\" replied Humphrey.\n\"Recollect, I am to sell the cattle for my own self-advantage until I\nbuy a gun, and one or two things which I want.\"\n\n\"I agree to that too, Humphrey,\" replied Jacob; \"and now to skin the\nbeast.\"\n\nThe skinning and quartering took up the whole afternoon, and Billy was\nheavily laden when he drew his cart home.  The next day Jacob went to\nLymington to sell the bull and the skin, and returned home well\nsatisfied with the profit he had made.  He had procured, as Humphrey\nrequested, some milk-pans, a small churn, and milk-pail, out of the\nproceeds, and had still money left.  Humphrey told them that he had not\nbeen to see the heifer yet, as he thought it better not.\n\n\"She will be tame to-morrow morning, depend upon it,\" said he.\n\n\"But if you give her nothing to eat, will not the calf die?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I should think not.  I shall not starve her, but I will make her\nthankful for her food before she gets it.  I shall cut her some grass\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nWe may as well here say that the next morning Humphrey went in to the\nheifer.  At first she tossed about and was very unruly.  He gave her\nsome grass, and patted her and coaxed her for a long while, till at last\nshe allowed him to touch her gently.  Every day for a fortnight he\nbrought her her food, and she became quieter every day, till at last, if\nhe went up to her, she never pushed with her horns.  The calf became\nquite tame, and as the heifer perceived that the calf was quiet, she\nbecame more quiet herself.  After the fortnight, Humphrey would not\nallow the heifer to receive anything except from the hand of Alice, that\nthe animal might know her well; and when the calf was a month old,\nHumphrey made the first attempt to milk her.  This was resisted at first\nby kicking, but in the course of ten days she gave down her milk.\nHumphrey then let her loose for a few days to run about the yard, still\nkeeping the calf in the cow-house, and putting the heifer in to her at\nnight, milking her before the calf was allowed to suck.  After this, he\nadventured upon the last experiment, which was to turn her out of the\nyard to graze into the forest.  She went away to some distance, and he\nwas fearful that she would join the herd, but in the evening she came\nback again to her calf.  After this he was satisfied, and turned her out\nevery day, and they had no further trouble with her.  He would not,\nhowever, wean the calf till the winter time, when she was shut up in the\nyard and fed on hay.  He then weaned the calf, which was a cow-calf, and\nthey had no more trouble with the mother.  Alice soon learnt to milk\nher, and she became very tractable and good-tempered.  Such was the\ncommencement of the dairy at the cottage.\n\n\"Jacob,\" said Humphrey, \"when do you go to Lymington again?\"\n\n\"Why, I do not know.  The end of August, as it is now, and the month of\nSeptember, is not good for venison; and, therefore, I do not see what I\nshall have to go for.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish, when you do go, you would get something for Alice and\nsomething for me.\"\n\n\"And what is it that Alice wants?\"\n\n\"She wants a kitten.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I may find that.  And what do you want, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"I want a dog.  Smoker is yours altogether; I want a dog for myself, to\nbring up after my own fashion.\"\n\n\"Well, I ought to look-out for another dog: although Smoker is not old,\nyet one ought to have two dogs to one's gun, in case of accident.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" replied Edward; \"see if you can get two puppies, one\nfor Humphrey, and one for myself.\"\n\n\"Well, I must not go to Lymington for them.  I must cross the forest, to\nsee some friends of mine whom I have not seen for a long while, and I\nmay get some of the right sort of puppies there, just like Smoker.  I'll\ndo that at once, as I may have to wait for them, even if I do have the\npromise.\"\n\n\"May I go with you, Jacob?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Why, I would rather not; they may ask questions.\"\n\n\"And so would I rather he would not, for he will shirk his work here.\"\n\n\"Why, what is there to do, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"Plenty to do, and hard work, Edward; the acorns are fit for beating\ndown, and we want a great many bushels for the pigs.  We have to fatten\nthree, and to feed the rest during the winter.  I cannot get on well\nwith only Alice and Edith; so if you are not very lazy, you will stay\nwith us and help us.\"\n\n\"Humphrey, you think of nothing but your pigs and farm-yard.\"\n\n\"And you are too great a hunter to think of anything but a stag; but a\nbird in the hand's worth two in the bush, in my opinion; and I'll make\nmore by my farm-yard than you ever will by the forest.\"\n\n\"Humphrey has nothing to do with the poultry and eggs, has he, Edward?\nThey belong to Edith and me and Jacob shall take them to Lymington and\nsell them for us, and get us some new clothes for Sunday, for these\nbegin to look rather worn--and no wonder.\"\n\n\"No, dearest, the poultry are yours, and I will sell them for you as\nsoon as you please, and buy what you wish with the money,\" replied\nJacob.  \"Let Humphrey make all the money he can with his pigs.\"\n\n\"Yes; and the butter belongs to me, if I make it,\" said Alice.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Humphrey, \"that's not fair; I find cows, and get\nnothing for them.  We must go halves, Alice.\"\n\n\"Well, I have no objection to that,\" said Alice, \"because you find the\ncows and feed them.  I made a pound of butter yesterday, just to try\nwhat I could do; but it's not firm, Jacob.  How is that?\"\n\n\"I have seen the women make butter, and know how, Alice; so next time I\nwill be with you.  I suppose you did not wash your butter-milk well out,\nnor put any salt in it?\"\n\n\"I did not put any salt in it.\"\n\n\"But you must, or the butter will not keep.\"\n\nIt was arranged that Edward should stay at home to assist in collecting\nthe acorns for the pigs, and that Jacob should cross the forest alone to\nsee after the puppies; and he set off the next morning.  He was away two\ndays, and then returned; said that he had a promise of two puppies, and\nthat he had chosen them; they were of the same breed as Smoker, but they\nwere only a fortnight old, and could not be taken from the mother yet\nawhile, so that he had arranged to call again when they were three or\nfour months old, and able to follow him across the forest.  Jacob also\nsaid that he was very near being hurt by a stag that had made at him--\nfor at that season of the year the stags were very dangerous and\nfierce--but that he had fired, and struck off one of the animal's horns,\nwhich made it turn.\n\n\"You must be careful, Edward, how you go about the forest now.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to go,\" replied Edward; \"as we cannot hunt, it is no\nuse; but in November we shall begin again.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jacob, \"that will be soon enough.  To-morrow I will help\nyou with the acorns, and the day afterwards, if I am spared, I will take\nAlice's poultry to Lymington for her.\"\n\n\"Yes, and when you come back you will help me to churn, for then I shall\nhave a good deal of cream.\"\n\n\"And don't forget to buy the kitten, Jacob,\" said Edith.\n\n\"What's the good of a kitten?\" said Humphrey, who was very busy making a\nbird-cage for Edith, having just finished one for Alice; \"she will only\nsteal your cream and eat up your birds.\"\n\n\"No, she won't; for we'll shut the door fast where the milk and cream\nis, and we'll hang the cages so high that Miss Puss won't be able to get\nat them.\"\n\n\"Well, then, a kitten will be useful,\" said Edward, \"for she will teach\nyou to be careful.\"\n\n\"My coat is a little the worse for wear, and so is yours, Edward.  We\nmust try if we cannot, like Alice, find means to pay for another.\"\n\n\"Humphrey,\" said Jacob, \"I'll buy all you want, and trust to you for\npaying me again as soon as you can.\"\n\n\"That's just what I want,\" replied Humphrey.  \"Then you must buy me a\ngun and a new suit of clothes first; when I've paid for them I shall\nwant some more tools, and some nails and screws, and two or three other\nthings; but I will say nothing about them just now.  Get me my gun, and\nI'll try what the forest will do for me--especially after I have my\ndog.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see; perhaps you'll like to come out with me sometimes\nand learn woodcraft, for Edward knows as much as I do now, and can go\nout by himself.\"\n\n\"Of course I will, Jacob; I want to learn everything.\"\n\n\"Well, there's a little money left in the bag yet, and I will go to\nLymington to-morrow.  Now I think it is time that we went to bed; and if\nyou are all as tired as I am, you will sleep soundly.\"\n\nJacob put into the cart the next day about forty of the chickens which\nAlice had reared; the others were kept to increase the number in the\npoultry-yard.  They had cost little or nothing bringing up; for when\nquite young they only had a little oatmeal cake, and afterwards, with\nthe potatoes which were left, they found themselves, as fowls can always\ndo when they have a great range of ground to go over.\n\nJacob came back at sunset, with all the articles.  He brought a new suit\nfor Alice and Edith, with some needles and thread and worsted, and gave\nher some money which was left from the sale of the chickens, after he\nhad made the purchases.  He also bought a new suit for Edward and\nHumphrey, and a gun, which was much approved of by Humphrey, as it had a\nlarger bore and carried a heavier bullet than either Jacob's or Edward's\nand there was a white kitten for Alice and Edith.  There was no news,\nonly that the Levellers had opposed Cromwell, and he had put them down\nwith the other troops, and Jacob said that it appeared that they were\nall squabbling and fighting with each other.\n\nTime passed; the month of November came on without anything to disturb\nthe daily employments of the family in the forest: when one evening\nJacob, who had returned from hunting with Edward (the first time they\nhad been out since the season commenced), told Alice that she must do\nall she could to give them a good dinner the next day, as it was to be a\nfeast.\n\n\"Why so, Jacob?\"\n\n\"If you cannot guess, I won't tell you till the time comes,\" replied\nJacob.\n\n\"Well then, Humphrey must help us,\" replied Alice, \"and we will do what\nwe can.  I will try, now that we have some meat, to make a grand\ndinner.\"\n\nAlice made all the preparations, and had for dinner the next day a piece\nof baked venison, a venison stew, a pair of roast chickens, and an\napple-pie--which, for them, was a very grand dinner indeed.  And it was\nvery well-dressed; for Jacob had taught her to cook, and by degrees she\nimproved upon Jacob's instruction.  Humphrey was quite as clever at it\nas she was; and little Edith was very useful, as she plucked the fowls,\nand watched the things while they were cooking.\n\n\"And now I'll tell you,\" said Jacob, after saying grace, \"why I asked\nyou for a feast this day.  It is because exactly on this day twelvemonth\nI brought you all to the cottage.  Now you know.\"\n\n\"I did not know it certainly, but I daresay you are right,\" replied\nEdward.\n\n\"And now, children, tell me,\" said Jacob, \"has not this year passed very\nquickly and very happily--quite as quickly and quite as happily as if\nyou had been staying at Arnwood?\"\n\n\"Yes, more so,\" replied Humphrey; \"for then very often I did not know\nwhat to do to amuse myself, and since I have been here the days have\nalways been too short.\"\n\n\"I agree with Humphrey,\" said Edward.\n\n\"And I am sure I do,\" replied Alice; \"I'm always busy, and always happy,\nand I'm never scolded about dirtying my clothes or tearing them, as I\nused to be.\"\n\n\"And what does little Edith say?\"\n\n\"I like to help Alice, and I like to play with the kitten,\" replied\nEdith.\n\n\"Well, my children,\" said Jacob, \"depend upon it, you are most happy\nwhen your days pass quickest, and that is only the case when you have\nplenty to do.  Here you are in peace and safety; and may it please God\nthat you may continue so!  We want very few things in this world--that\nis, we really want very few things, although we wish and sigh for many.\nYou have health and spirits, which are the greatest blessings in life.\nWho would believe, to look at you all, that you were the same children\nthat I brought away from Arnwood?  You were then very different from\nwhat you are now.  You are strong and healthy, rosy and brown, instead\nof being fair and delicate.  Look at your sisters, Edward, do you think\nthat any of your former friends--do you think that Martha, who had the\ncare of them, would know them?\"\n\nEdward smiled and said, \"Certainly not; especially in their present\ndresses.\"\n\n\"Nor would, I think, Humphrey be known again.  You, Edward, were always\na stout boy; and, except that you have grown very much, and are more\nbrown, there is no great difference.  You would be known again, even in\nyour present forester's dress; but what I say is, that we ought to be\nthankful to the Almighty that you, instead of being burnt in your beds,\nhave found health and happiness and security in a forester's hut; and I\nought to be, and am, most thankful to heaven that it has pleased it to\nspare my life, and enable me to teach you all to the present how to gain\nyour own livelihoods after I am called away.  I have been able so far to\nfulfil my promise to your noble father; and you know not what a heavy\nload on my mind is every day lessened, as I see each day that you are\nmore and more able to provide for yourselves.  God bless you, dear\nchildren, and may you live to see many returns, and happy returns, of\nthe day;\" and Jacob was so much moved as he said this, that a tear was\nseen rolling down his furrowed cheek.\n\nThe second winter now came on.  Jacob and Edward went out hunting\nusually about twice a week; for the old forester complained of stiffness\nand rheumatism, and not feeling so active as he used to be.  Humphrey\nnow accompanied Edward perhaps one day in the week, but not more, and\nthey seldom returned without having procured venison, for Edward knew\nhis business well, and no longer needed the advice of Jacob.  As the\nwinter advanced Jacob gave up going out altogether.  He went to\nLymington to sell the venison and procure what was necessary for the\nhousehold; such as oatmeal and flour, which were the principal wants;\nbut even these journeys fatigued him, and it was evident that the old\nman's constitution was breaking fast.  Humphrey was always busy.  One\nevening he was making something which puzzled them all.  They asked him\nwhat it was for, but he would not tell them.\n\n\"It's an experiment that I am trying,\" said he, as he was bending a\nhazel stick.  \"If it answers, you shall know: if it does not, I've only\nhad a little trouble for nothing.  Jacob, I hope you will not forget the\nsalt to-morrow when you go to Lymington, for my pigs are ready for\nkilling, and we must salt the greatest part of the pork.  After the legs\nand shoulders have lain long enough in salt, I mean to try if I cannot\nsmoke them, and if I do, I'll then smoke some bacon.  Won't that be\njolly, Alice?  Won't you like to have a great piece of bacon hanging up\nthere, and only to have to get on a stool to cut off what you want, when\nEdward and I come home hungry and you've nothing to give us to eat?\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to have it, and I think so will you too, by the\nway you talk.\"\n\n\"I shall, I assure you.  Jacob, didn't you say the ash-sticks were the\nbest to smoke bacon with?\"\n\n\"Yes, boy: when you are ready, I'll tell you how to manage.  My poor\nmother used to smoke very well up this very chimney.\"\n\n\"I think that will do,\" said Humphrey, letting his hazel stick spring\nup, after he had bent it down, \"but to-morrow I shall find out.\"\n\n\"But what is it for, Humphrey?\" said Edith.\n\n\"Go away, puss, and play with your kitten,\" replied Humphrey, putting\naway his tools and his materials in a corner; \"I've a great deal on my\nhands now, but I must kill my pigs before I think of anything else.\"\n\nThe next day Jacob took the venison into Lymington, and brought back the\nsalt and other articles required.  The pigs were then killed, and salted\ndown under Jacob's directions; his rheumatism did not allow him to\nassist, but Humphrey and Edward rubbed in the salt, and Alice took the\npieces of pork away to the tub when they were finished.  Humphrey had\nbeen out the day before with the unknown article he had been so long\nabout.  The next morning he went out early before breakfast, and when he\nreturned he brought a hare in his hand, which he laid on the table.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"my springe has answered, and this is the fruits of\nit.  Now I'll make some more, and we will have something by way of a\nchange for dinner.\"\n\nThey were very much pleased with Humphrey's success, and he was not a\nlittle proud of it.\n\n\"How did you find out how to make it?\"\n\n\"Why, I read in the old book of travels which Jacob brought home with\nhim last summer, of people catching rabbits and hares in some way like\nthis; I could not make it out exactly, but it gave me the idea.\"\n\nWe ought to have told the reader that Jacob had more than once brought\nhome an old book or two which he had picked up, or had given him, and\nthat these had been occasionally looked into by Humphrey and Edward, but\nonly now and then, as they had too much to do to find much time for\nreading, although sometimes in the evening they did take them up.  When\nit is considered how young they were, and what a practical and busy life\nthey led, this cannot be surprising.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nHumphrey was now after something else.  He had made several traps, and\nbrought in rabbits and hares almost every day.  He had also made some\nbird traps, and had caught two gold-finches for Alice and Edith, which\nthey put in the cages he had made for them.  But, as we said, Humphrey\nwas about something else; he was out early in the morning, and in the\nevening, when the moon was up, he came home late, long after they had\nall gone to bed; but they never knew why, nor would he tell them.  A\nheavy fall of snow took place, and Humphrey was more out than ever.  At\nlast, about a week after the snow had lain on the ground, one morning he\ncame in with a hare and rabbit in his hand, and said:\n\n\"Edward, I have caught something larger than a hare or a rabbit, and you\nmust come and help me, and we must take our guns.  Jacob, I suppose your\nrheumatism is too bad to let you come too?\"\n\n\"No; I think I can manage.  It's the damp that hurts me so much.  This\nfrosty air will do me good, perhaps.  I have been much better since the\nsnow fell.  Now, then, let us see what you have caught.\"\n\n\"You will have to walk two miles,\" said Humphrey, as they went out.\n\n\"I can manage it, Humphrey; so lead the way.\"\n\nHumphrey went on till they came close to a clump of large trees, and\nthen brought them to a pit-fall which he had dug, about six feet wide\nand eight feet long, and nine feet deep.\n\n\"There's my large trap,\" said Humphrey, \"and see what I have caught in\nit.\"\n\nThey looked down into the pit and perceived a young bull in it.  Smoker,\nwho was with them, began to bark furiously at it.\n\n\"Now, what are we to do?  I don't think it is hurt.  Can we get it out?\"\nsaid Humphrey.\n\n\"No, not very well.  If it was a calf we might; but it is too heavy; and\nif we were to get it out alive, we must kill it afterwards, so we had\nbetter shoot it at once.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" replied Humphrey.\n\n\"But how did you catch him?\" said Edward.\n\n\"I read of it in the same book I did about the traps for hares,\" replied\nHumphrey.  \"I dug out the pit and covered it with brambles, and then put\nsnow at the top.  This is the thicket that the herd comes to chiefly in\nwinter time; it is large and dry, and the large trees shelter it; so\nthat is why I chose this spot.  I took a large bundle of hay, put some\non the snow about the pit, and then strewed some more about in small\nhandfuls, so that the cattle must find it and pick it up, which I knew\nthey would be glad to do, now that the snow is on the ground.  And now,\nyou see, I have succeeded.\"\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, you beat us, I will say,\" said Edward.  \"Shall I shoot\nhim?\"\n\n\"Yes, now that he is looking up.\"\n\nEdward shot his ball through the forehead of the animal, which fell\ndead; but they were then obliged to go home for the pony and cart, and\nropes to get the animal out of the pit, and a hard job they had of it\ntoo; but the pony helped them, and they did get it out at last.\n\n\"I will do it easier next time,\" said Humphrey.  \"I will make a windlass\nas soon as I can, and we will soon hoist out another, like they turn a\nbucket of water up from a well.\"\n\n\"It's nice young meat,\" said Jacob, who was skinning the bull, \"not\nabove eighteen months old, I should think.  Had it been a full-grown\none, like that we shot, it must have remained where it was, for we never\ncould have got it out.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jacob, we should; for I should have gone down and cut it up in the\npit, so that we would have handed it out by bits, if we could not have\nmanaged him whole.\"\n\nThey loaded the cart with the skin and quarters of the animal, and then\ndrove home.\n\n\"This will go far to pay for the gun, Humphrey,\" said Jacob, \"if it\ndon't pay for more.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" said Humphrey; \"but I hope it will not be the last\nwhich I take.\"\n\n\"That reminds me, Humphrey, of one thing; I think you must come back\nwith the cart and carry away all the entrails of the beast, and remove\nall the blood which is on the snow, for I've observed that cattle are\nvery scared with the smell and sight of blood.  I found that out by once\nor twice seeing them come to where I have cut the throat of a stag, and\nas soon as they have put their noses down to where the blood was on the\nground they have put their tails up and galloped away, bellowing at a\nterrible rate.  Indeed I've heard say that if a murder has been\ncommitted in a wood, and you want to find the body, that a herd of\ncattle drove into it will serve you better than even a bloodhound.\"\n\n\"Thank you for telling me that, Jacob, for I should never have supposed\nit; and I'll tell you what I'll also do.  I'll load the cart with fern\nlitter, and put it at the bottom of the pit; so that if I could get a\nheifer or calf worth taking, it may not be hurt by the fall.\"\n\n\"It must have taken you a long while to dig that pit, Humphrey.\"\n\n\"Yes, it did, and as I got deeper the work was harder, and then I had to\ncarry away all the earth and scatter it about.  I was more than a month\nabout it from the time that I began till it was finished, and I had a\nladder to go up and down by at last, and carried the baskets of earth\nup, for it was too deep to throw it out.\"\n\n\"Nothing like patience and perseverance, Humphrey.  You've more than I\nhave.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he has more than I have, or shall ever have, I'm afraid,\"\nreplied Edward.\n\nDuring this winter, which passed rapidly away, very few circumstances of\nany consequence occurred.  Old Jacob was more or less confined to the\ncottage by the rheumatism, and Edward hunted either by himself or\noccasionally with Humphrey.  Humphrey was fortunate enough to take a\nbull and cow-calf in his pit-fall, both of them about a year or fifteen\nmonths old, and by a rude invention of his, by way of windlass,\ncontrived, with the assistance of Edward, to hoist them uninjured out of\nthe pit.  They were put into the yard, and after having been starved\ntill they were tamed, they followed the example of the heifer and calf,\nand became quite tame.  These were an important addition to their stock,\nas may well be imagined.  The only mishap under which they laboured was,\nold Jacob's confinement to the cottage, which, as the winter advanced,\nprevented him from going to Lymington; they could not therefore sell any\nvenison, and Humphrey, by way of experiment, smoked some venison hams,\nwhich he hung up with the others.  There was another point on which they\nfelt anxiety, which was, that Jacob could not cross the forest to get\nthe puppies which had been promised them, and the time was past, for it\nwas now January, when he was to have called for them.  Edward and\nHumphrey pressed the old man very hard to let one of them go; but the\nonly answer they could obtain was, \"that he'd be better soon.\"  At last,\nfinding that he got worse instead of better, he consented that Edward\nshould go.  He gave directions how to proceed, the way he was to take,\nand a description of the keeper's lodge; cautioned him to call himself\nby the name of Armitage, and describe himself as his grandson.  Edward\npromised to obey Jacob's directions, and the next morning he set off,\nmounted upon White Billy, with a little money in his pocket, in case he\nshould want it.\n\n\"I wish I was going with you,\" said Humphrey, as he walked by the side\nof the pony.\n\n\"I wish you were, Humphrey: for my part, I feel as if I were a slave set\nat liberty.  I do justice to old Jacob's kindness and good-will, and\nacknowledge how much we are indebted to him; but still, to be housed up\nhere in the forest, never seeing or speaking to any one, shut out from\nthe world, does not suit Edward Beverley.  Our father was a soldier, and\na right good one; and if I were old enough I think even now I should\nescape and join the royal party, broken as it may be, and by all\naccounts is, at this moment.  Deer-stalking is all very well, but I fly\nat higher game.\"\n\n\"I feel the same as you do,\" replied Humphrey; \"but recollect, Edward,\nthat the old man's very infirm, and what would become of our sisters if\nwe were to leave them?\"\n\n\"I know that well, Humphrey; I have no idea of leaving them, you may be\nsure; but I wish they were with our relations in safety, and then we\nshould be free to act.\"\n\n\"Yes, we should, Edward; but recollect that we are not yet men, and boys\nof fifteen and thirteen cannot do much, although they may wish to do\nmuch.\"\n\n\"It's true that I am only fifteen,\" replied Edward, \"but I am strong\nenough, and so are you.  I think if I had a fair cut at a man's head, I\nwould make him stagger under it, were he as big as a buffalo.  As young\nas I have been to the wars, that I know well; and I recollect my father\npromising me that I should go with him as soon as I was fifteen.\"\n\n\"What puzzles me,\" replied Humphrey, \"is the fear that old Jacob has of\nour being seen at Lymington.\"\n\n\"Why, what fear is there?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell more than you; in my opinion, the rear is only in his own\nimagination.  They surely would not hurt us (if we walked about without\narms like other people), because our father had fought for the king?\nThat they have beheaded some people is true; but then they were plotting\nin the king's favour, or in other ways opposed to Parliament.  This I\nhave gathered from Jacob: but I cannot see what we have to fear, if we\nremain quiet.  But now comes the question, Edward; for Jacob has, I\nbelieve, said more to me on this one subject than he has to you.\nSuppose you were to leave the forest, what would be the first step which\nyou would take?\"\n\n\"I should of course state who I was, and take possession of my father's\nproperty at Arnwood, which is mine by descent.\"\n\n\"Exactly; so Jacob thinks, and he says that would be your ruin, for the\nproperty is sequestered, as they call it, or forfeited to the\nParliament, in consequence of your father having fought against it on\nthe king's side.  It no longer belongs to you, and you would not be\nallowed to take it: on the contrary, you would in all probability be\nimprisoned, and who knows what might then take place?  You see there is\ndanger?\"\n\n\"Did Jacob say this to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did: he told me he dare not speak to you on the subject, you\nwere so fiery; and if you heard that the property was confiscated you\nwould certainly do some rash act, and that anything of the kind would be\na pretence for laying hold of you; and then he said that he did not\nthink that he would live long, for he was weaker every day; and that he\nonly hoped his life would be spared another year or two, that he might\nkeep you quiet till better times came.  He said that if they supposed\nthat we were all burnt in the house when it was fired, it would give\nthem a fair opportunity of calling you an impostor, and treating you\naccordingly; and that there were so many anxious to have a gift of the\nproperty that you would have thousands of people compassing your death.\nHe said that your making known yourself and claiming your property would\nbe the very conduct that your enemies would wish you to follow, and\nwould be attended with most fatal consequences; for he said, to prove\nthat you were Edward Beverley, you must declare that I and your sisters\nwere in the forest with him, and this disclosure would put the whole\nfamily in the power of their bitterest enemies; and what would become of\nyour sisters, it would be impossible to say; but most likely they would\nbe put under the charge of some Puritan family, who would have a\npleasure in ill-treating and humiliating the daughters of such a man as\nColonel Beverley.\"\n\n\"And why did he not tell me all this?\"\n\n\"He was afraid to say anything to you; he thought that you would be so\nmad at the idea of this injustice that you would do something rash: and\nhe said, `I pray every night that my otherwise useless life may be\nspared; for, were I to die, I know that Edward would quit the forest.'\"\n\n\"Never, while my sisters are under my protection,\" replied Edward; \"were\nthey safe, I would be out of it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I think, Edward, that there is great truth in what Jacob says; you\ncould do no good (for they would not restore your property), by making\nyour seclusion known at present, and you might do a great deal of\nharm--`bide your time'--is good advice in such troubled times.  I\ntherefore think that I should be very wary if I were you; but I still\nthink that there is no fear of either you or I going out of the forest\nin our present dresses and under the name of Armitage.  No one would\nrecognise us; you are grown tall, and so am I, and we are so tanned and\nsunburnt with air and exercise that we do look more like children of the\nforest than the sons of Colonel Beverley.\"\n\n\"Humphrey, you speak very sensibly, and I agree with you.  I am not\nquite so fiery as the old man thinks; and if my bosom burns with\nindignation, at all events I have sufficient power to conceal my\nfeelings when it is necessary.  I can oppose art to art, if it becomes\nrequisite, and which, from what you have said, I believe now is really\nso.  One thing is certain, that while King Charles is a prisoner, as he\nnow is, and his party dispersed or gone abroad, I can do nothing, and to\nmake myself known would only be to injure myself and all of us.  Keep\nquiet, therefore, I certainly shall, and also remain as I am now under a\nfalse name; but still I must and will mix up with other people, and know\nwhat is going on.  I am willing to live in this forest and protect my\nsisters as long as it is necessary so to do; but although I will reside\nhere, I will not be confined to the forest altogether.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I think too, Edward, what I wish myself: but let us\nnot be too hasty even in this.  And now, I will wish you a pleasant\nride; and, Edward, if you can, procure of the keepers some small shot\nfor me; I much wish to have some.\"\n\n\"I will not forget; good-bye, brother.\"\n\nHumphrey returned home to attend his farm-yard, while Edward continued\nhis journey through the forest.  Some estimate of the character of the\ntwo boys may be formed from the above conversation.  Edward was\ncourageous and impetuous--hasty in his resolves, but still open to\nconviction.  Brought up as the heir to the property, he felt, more than\nHumphrey could be expected to do, the mortification of being left a\npauper, after such high prospects in his early days: his vindictive\nfeelings against the opposite party were therefore more keen, and his\nspirit mounted more under the conviction which he laboured.  His\ndisposition was naturally warlike, and this disposition had been\nfostered by his father when he was a child--still a kinder heart or a\nmore generous lad never existed.\n\nHumphrey was of a much more subdued and philosophical temperament, not\nperhaps so well calculated to lead as to advise; there was great\nprudence in him united with courage; but his was a passive courage\nrather than an active one--a courage which if assailed would defend\nitself valiantly, but would be wary and reflective before it would\nattack.  Humphrey had not that spirit of chivalry possessed by Edward.\nHe was a younger son, and had to earn, in a way, his own fortune, and he\nfelt that his inclinations were more for peace than strife.  Moreover,\nHumphrey had talents which Edward had not--a natural talent for\nmechanics, and an inquisitive research into science, as far as his\nlimited education would permit him.  He was more fitted for an engineer\nor an agriculturist than for a soldier, although there is no doubt that\nhe would have made a very brave soldier, if such was to have become his\navocation.\n\nFor kindness and generosity of nature he was equal to his brother, and\nthis was the reason why an angry word never passed between them; for the\nquestion between them was, not which should have his way, but which\nshould give up most to the wishes of the other.  We hardly need say,\nthat there never were two brothers who were more attached, and who so\nmutually respected each other.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nEdward put the pony to a trot, and in two hours was on the other side of\nthe New Forest.  The directions given to him by Jacob were not\nforgotten, and before it was noon he found himself at the gate of the\nkeeper's house.  Dismounting, and hanging the bridle of the pony over\nthe rail he walked through a small garden, neatly kept but, so early in\nthe year, not over gay, except that the crocus and snow drops were\npeeping.  He rapped at the door with his knuckles, and a girl of about\nfourteen, very neatly dressed, answered the summons.\n\n\"Is Oswald Partridge at home, maiden?\" said Edward.\n\n\"No, young man, he is not.  He is in the forest.\"\n\n\"When will he return?\"\n\n\"Towards the evening is his time, unless he is more than usually\nsuccessful.\"\n\n\"I have come some distance to find him,\" replied Edward; \"and it would\nvex me to return without seeing him.  Has he a wife, or any one that I\ncould speak to?\"\n\n\"He has no wife; but I am willing to deliver a message.\"\n\n\"I am come about some dogs which he promised to Jacob Armitage, my\nrelation; but the old man is too unwell, and has been for some time, to\ncome himself for them, and he has sent me.\"\n\n\"There are dogs, young and old, large and small, in the kennels; so far\ndo I know, and no more.\"\n\n\"I fear then I must wait till his return,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"I will speak to my father,\" replied the young girl, \"if you will wait\none moment.\"\n\nIn a minute or two the girl returned, saying that her father begged that\nhe would walk in, and he would speak with him.  Edward bowed, and\nfollowed the young girl, who led the way to a room, in which was seated\na man dressed after the fashion of the Roundheads of the day.  His\nsteeple-crowned hat lay on the chair, with his sword beneath it.  He was\nsitting at a table covered with papers.\n\n\"Here is the youth, father,\" said the girl; and having said this, she\ncrossed the room and took a seat by the side of the fire.  The man, or\nwe should rather say gentleman--for he had the appearance of one,\nnotwithstanding the sombre and peculiar dress he wore, continued to read\na letter which he had just opened; and Edward, who feared himself the\nprisoner of a Roundhead when he only expected to meet a keeper, was\nfurther irritated by the neglect shown towards him by the party.\nForgetting that he was, by his own assertion, not Edward Beverley, but\nthe relative of one Jacob Armitage, he coloured up with anger as he\nstood at the door.  Fortunately the time that it took the other party to\nread through the letter gave Edward also time for recollecting the\ndisguise under which he appeared; the colour subsided from his cheeks,\nand he remained in silence, occasionally meeting the look of the little\ngirl, who, when their eyes met, immediately withdrew her glance.\n\n\"What is your business, young man?\" at last said the gentleman at the\ntable.\n\n\"I came, sir, on private business with the keeper, Oswald Partridge, to\nobtain two young hounds, which he promised to my grandfather, Jacob\nArmitage.\"\n\n\"Armitage!\" said the other party, referring to a list on the table;\n\"Armitage--Jacob--yes--I see he is one of the verderers.  Why has he not\nbeen here to call upon me?\"\n\n\"For what reason should he call upon you, sir?\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Simply, young man, because the New Forest is, by the Parliament,\ncommitted to my charge.  Notice has been given for all those who were\nemployed to come here, that they might be permitted to remain, or he\ndischarged, as I may deem most advisable.\"\n\n\"Jacob Armitage has heard nothing of this, sir,\" replied Edward.  \"He\nwas a keeper, appointed under the king; for two or three years his\nallowances have never been paid, and he has lived in his own cottage,\nwhich was left to him by his father, being his own property.\"\n\n\"And pray, may I ask, young man, do you live with Jacob Armitage?\"\n\n\"I have done so for more than a year.\"\n\n\"And as your relation has received no pay and allowances, as you state,\npray, by what means has he maintained himself?\"\n\n\"How have the other keepers maintained themselves?\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Do not put questions to me, sir,\" replied the gentleman; \"but be\npleased to reply to mine.  What has been the means of subsistence of\nJacob Armitage?\"\n\n\"If you think he has no means of subsistence, sir, you are mistaken,\"\nreplied Edward.  \"We have land of our own, which we cultivate; we have\nour pony and our cart; we have our pigs and our cows.\"\n\n\"And they have been sufficient?\"\n\n\"Had the patriarchs more?\" replied Edward.\n\n\"You are pithy at reply, young man; but I know something of Jacob\nArmitage, and we know,\" continued he, putting his finger close to some\nwriting opposite the name on the list, \"with whom he has been\nassociated, and with whom he has served.  Now allow me to put one\nquestion.  You have come, you say, for two young hounds.  Are their\nservices required for your pigs and cows, and to what use are they to be\nput?\"\n\n\"We have as good a dog as there is in the forest,\" replied Edward, \"but\nwe wish to have others, in case we should lose him.\"\n\n\"As good a dog as in the forest--good for what?\"\n\n\"For hunting.\"\n\n\"Then you acknowledge that you do hunt?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge nothing for Jacob Armitage, he may answer for himself,\"\nreplied Edward; \"but allow me to assure you that if he has killed\nvenison no one can blame him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will explain why?\"\n\n\"Nothing is more easy.  Jacob Armitage served King Charles, who employed\nhim as a verderer in the forest, and paid him his wages.  Those who\nshould not have done so rebelled against the king, took his authority\nfrom him, and the means of paying those he employed.  They were still\nservants of the king, for they were not dismissed; and, having no other\nmeans of support, they considered that their good master would be but\ntoo happy that they should support themselves by killing, for their\nsubsistence, that venison which they could no longer preserve for him\nwithout eating some themselves.\"\n\n\"Then you admit that Jacob Armitage has killed the deer in the forest?\"\n\n\"I admit nothing for Jacob Armitage.\"\n\n\"You admit that you have killed it yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall not answer that question, sir; in the first place, I am not\nhere to criminate myself; and, in the next, I must know by what\nauthority you have the right to inquire.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" replied the other in a severe tone, \"if you wish to know my\nauthority, malapert as you are (at this remark Edward started, yet,\nrecollecting himself he compressed his lips and stood still), this is my\ncommission, appointing me the agent of Parliament to take charge and\nsuperintend the New Forest, with power to appoint and dismiss those whom\nI please.  I presume you must take my word for it, as you cannot read\nand write.\"\n\nEdward stepped up to the table, and very quietly took up the paper and\nread it.  \"You have stated what is correct, sir,\" said he, laying it\ndown; \"and the date of it is, I perceive, on the 20th of the last month\nof December.  It is, therefore, but eighteen days old.\"\n\n\"And what inference would you draw from that, young man?\" replied the\ngentleman, looking up to him with some astonishment.\n\n\"Simply this, sir--that Jacob Armitage has been laid up with the\nrheumatism for three months, during which time he certainly has not\nkilled any venison.  Now, sir, until the Parliament took the forest into\ntheir hands, it undoubtedly belonged to his majesty, if it does not now;\ntherefore Jacob Armitage, for whatever slaughter he may have committed,\nis, up to the present, only answerable to his sovereign, King Charles.\"\n\n\"It is easy to perceive the school in which you have been brought up,\nyoung man, even if there was not evidence on this paper that your\nforefather served under the Cavalier Colonel Beverley, and has brought\nyou up to his way of thinking.\"\n\n\"Sir, it is a base dog that bites the hand that feeds him,\" replied\nEdward with warmth.  \"Jacob Armitage, and his father before him, were\nretainers in the family of Colonel Beverley; they were indebted to him\nfor the situation they now hold in the forest; indebted to him for\neverything; they revere his name, they uphold the cause for which he\nfell, as I _do_.\"\n\n\"Young man, if you do not speak advisedly, at all events you speak\ngratefully; neither have I a word of disrespect to offer to the memory\nof Colonel Beverley, who was a gallant man, and true to the cause which\nhe espoused, although it was not a holy one; but in my position, I\ncannot, in justice to those whom I serve, give places and emolument to\nthose who have been, and still are, as I may judge by your expressions,\nadverse to the present government.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Edward, \"your language, with respect to Colonel Beverley,\nhas made me feel respect for you, which I confess I did not at first;\nwhat you say is very just; not that I think you harm Jacob Armitage; as,\nin the first place, I know that he would not serve under you; and, in\nthe next, that he is too old and infirm to hold the situation; neither\nhas he occasion for it, as his cottage and land are his own, and you\ncannot remove him.\"\n\n\"He has the title, I presume?\" replied the gentleman.\n\n\"He has the title given to his grandfather, long before King Charles was\nborn, and I presume the Parliament do not intend to invalidate the acts\nof former kings.\"\n\n\"May I inquire what relation you are to Jacob Armitage?\"\n\n\"I believe, I have before said, his grandson.\"\n\n\"You live with him?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And if the old man dies, will inherit his property?\"  Edward smiled,\nand looking at the young girl, said, \"Now, I ask you, maiden, if your\nfather does not presume upon his office?\"\n\nThe young girl laughed, and said, \"He is in authority.\"\n\n\"Not over me, certainly, and not over my grandfather, for he has\ndismissed him.\"\n\n\"Were you brought up at the cottage, young man?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I was brought up at Arnwood.  I was a playmate of the children\nof Colonel Beverley.\"\n\n\"Educated with them?\"\n\n\"Yes, for, as far as my wilfulness would permit, the chaplain was always\nready to give me instruction.\"\n\n\"Where were you when Arnwood was burnt down?\"\n\n\"I was at the cottage at that time,\" replied Edward, grinding his teeth\nand looking wildly.\n\n\"Nay, nay, I can forgive any expression of feeling on your part, my\nyoung man, when that dreadful and disgraceful deed is brought to your\nmemory.  It was a stain that can never be effaced--a deed most\ndiabolical, and what we thought would call down the vengeance of heaven.\nIf prayers could avert, or did avert it, they were not wanting on our\nside.\"\n\nEdward remained silent: this admission on the part of the Roundhead\nprevented an explosion on his part.  He felt that all were not so bad as\nhe had imagined.  After a long pause, he said, \"When I came here, sir,\nit was to seek Oswald Partridge, and obtain the hounds which he had\npromised us; but I presume that my journey is now useless.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because you have the control of the forest, and will not permit dogs\nfor the chase to be given away to those who are not employed by the\npowers that now govern.\"\n\n\"You have judged correctly, in so far that my duty is to prevent it; but\nas the promise was made previous to the date of my commission, I\npresume,\" said he, smiling, \"you think I have no right to interfere, as\nit will be an _ex post facto_ case, if I do: I shall not therefore\ninterfere, only I must point out to you that the laws are still the same\nrelative to those who take the deer in the forest by stealth--you\nunderstand me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do; and if you will not be offended, I will give you a\ncandid reply.\"\n\n\"Speak then.\"\n\n\"I consider that the deer in this forest belong to King Charles, who is\nmy lawful sovereign, and I own no authority but from him.  I hold myself\nanswerable to him alone for any deer I may kill, and I feel sure of his\npermission and full forgiveness for what I may do.\"\n\n\"That may be your opinion, my good sir, but it will not be the opinion\nof the ruling powers; but if caught, you will be punished, and that by\nme, in pursuance of the authority vested in me.\"\n\n\"Well, sir; if so, so be it.  You have dismissed the Armitages on\naccount of their upholding the king, and you cannot, therefore, be\nsurprised that they uphold him more than ever.  Nor can you be surprised\nif a dismissed verderer becomes a poacher.\"\n\n\"Nor can you be surprised if a poacher is caught, that he incurs the\npenalty,\" replied the Roundhead.  \"So now there's an end of our\nargument.  If you go into the kitchen, you will find wherewithal to\nrefresh the outward man, and if you wish to remain till Oswald Partridge\ncomes home, you are welcome.\"\n\nEdward, who felt indignant at being dismissed to the kitchen, nodded his\nhead and smiled upon the little girl, and left the room.  \"Well,\"\nthought he, as he went along the passage, \"I came here for two puppies,\nand I have found a Roundhead.  I don't know how it is, but I am not so\nangry with him as I thought I should be.  That little girl had a nice\nsmile--she was quite handsome when she smiled.  Oh, this is the kitchen,\nto which,\" thought he, \"the Lord of Arnwood is dismissed by a Covenanter\nand Roundhead, probably a tradesman or outlaw, who has served the cause.\nWell, be it so; as Humphrey says, `I'll bide my time.'  But there is no\none here, so I'll try if there is a stable for White Billy, who is\ntired, I presume, of being at the gate.\"\n\nEdward returned by the way he came, went out of the front door, and\nthrough the garden to where the pony was made fast, and led him away in\nsearch of a stable.  He found one behind the house, and filling the rack\nwith hay, returned to the house, and seated himself at a porch which was\nat the door which led to the back premises, for the keeper's house was\nlarge and commodious.  Edward was in deep thought, when he was roused by\nthe little girl, the daughter of the newly-appointed Intendant of the\nforest, who said:\n\n\"I am afraid, young sir, you have had but sorry welcome in the kitchen,\nas there was no one to receive you.  I was not aware that Phoebe had\ngone out.  If you will come with me, I may, perhaps, find you\nrefreshment.\"\n\n\"Thanks, maiden, you are kind and considerate to an avowed poacher,\"\nreplied Edward.\n\n\"Oh, but you will not poach, I'm sure; and if you do, I'll beg you off\nif I can,\" replied the girl, laughing.\n\nEdward followed her into the kitchen, and she soon produced a cold fowl\nand a venison pasty, which she placed on the table; she then went out\nand returned with a jug of ale.\n\n\"There,\" said she, putting it on the table, \"that is all that I can\nfind.\"\n\n\"Your father's name is Heatherstone, I believe.  It was so on the\nwarrant.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\"And yours?\"\n\n\"The same as my father's, I should presume.\"\n\n\"Yes, but your baptismal name?\"\n\n\"You ask strange questions, young sir; but still I will answer you that:\nmy baptismal name is Patience.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your condescension,\" replied Edward.  \"You live here?\"\n\n\"For the present, good sir; and now I leave you.\"\n\n\"That's a nice little girl,\" thought Edward, \"although she is the\ndaughter of a Roundhead; and she calls me `sir.'  I cannot, therefore,\nlook like Jacob's grandson, and must be careful.\"  Edward then set to\nwith a good appetite at the viands which had been placed before him, and\nhad just finished a hearty meal when Patience Heatherstone again came in\nand said:\n\n\"Oswald Partridge is now coming home.\"\n\n\"I thank you, maiden,\" replied Edward.  \"May I ask a question of you?\nWhere is the king now?\"\n\n\"I have heard that he resides at Hurst Castle,\" replied the girl; \"but,\"\nadded she in a low tone, \"all attempts to see him would be useless, and\nonly hurt him and those who made the attempt.\"  Having said this she\nleft the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nEdward, having finished his meal, and had a good pull at the jug of ale,\nwhich was a liquor he had not tasted for a long while, rose from the\ntable and went out of the back door and found there Oswald Partridge.\nHe accosted him, stating the reason for his coming over to him.  \"I did\nnot know that Jacob had a grandson; indeed, I never knew that he had a\nson.  Have you been living with him long?\"\n\n\"More than a year,\" replied Edward; \"before that I was in the household\nat Arnwood.\"\n\n\"Then you are of the king's side, I presume?\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"To death,\" replied Edward, \"when the time comes.\"\n\n\"And I am also; that you may suppose, for never would I give a hound to\nany one that was not.  But we had better go to the kennels; dogs may\nhear, but they can't repeat.\"\n\n\"I little thought to have met any one but you here when I came,\" said\nEdward; \"and I will now tell you all that passed between me and the new\nIntendant.\"  Edward then related the conversation.\n\n\"You have been bold,\" said Oswald--\"but perhaps it is all the better--I\nam to retain my situation, and so are two others: but there are many new\nhands coming in as rangers.  I know nothing of them but that they are\nlittle fitted for their places; and rail against the king all day long,\nwhich I suppose is their chief merit in the eyes of those who appoint\nthem.  However, one thing is certain, that if those fellows cannot stalk\na deer themselves, they will do all they can to prevent others; so you\nmust be on the alert, for the punishment is severe.\"\n\n\"I fear them not; the only difficulty is, that we shall not be able to\nfind a sale for the venison now,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Oh, never fear that; I will give you the names of those who will take\nall your venison off your hands without any risk on your part, except in\nthe killing of it.  They will meet you in the park, lay down ready\nmoney, and take it away.  I don't know, but I have an idea that this new\nIntendant, or what you may call him, is not so severe as he pretends to\nbe.  Indeed, his permitting you to say what he did, and his own words\nrelative to the colonel, convince me that I am right in the opinion that\nI formed.\"\n\n\"Do you know who he is?\"\n\n\"Not much about him, but he is a great friend of General Cromwell's, and\nthey say has done good service to the Parliamentary cause; but we shall\nmeet again, for the forest is free, at all events.\"\n\n\"If you come here,\" continued Oswald, \"do not carry your gun, and see\nthat you are not watched home.  There are the dogs for your grandfather.\nWhy, how old must you be, for Jacob is not more than sixty, or\nthereabout?\"\n\n\"I am fifteen past, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"I should have put you down for eighteen or nineteen at least.  You are\nwell grown indeed for that age.  Well, nothing like a forest life to\nturn a boy into a man!  Can you stalk a deer?\"\n\n\"I seldom go out without bringing one down.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  That Jacob is a master of his craft is certain.  But you are\nyoung to have learnt it so soon.  Can you tell the slot of a brocket\nfrom a stag?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the slot of a brocket from a doe.\"\n\n\"Better still.  We must go out together; and besides, I must know where\nthe old man's cottage is (for I do not exactly); in the first place,\nbecause I may want to come to you, and in the next, that I may put\nothers on a false scent.--Do you know the clump of large oaks, which\nthey call the Clump Royal?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Will you meet me there the day after to-morrow, at early dawn?\"\n\n\"If I live and do well.\"\n\n\"That's enough.  Take the dogs in the leashes, and go away now.\"\n\n\"Many thanks; but I must not leave the pony; he is in the stable.\"\n\nThe keeper nodded adieu to Edward, who left him to go to the stable for\nthe pony.  Edward saddled White Billy, and rode away across the forest\nwith the dogs trotting at the pony's heels.\n\nEdward had much to reflect upon as he rode back to the cottage.  He felt\nthat his position was one of more difficulty than before.  That old\nJacob Armitage would not last much longer he was convinced; even now the\npoor old man was shrunk away to a skeleton with pain and disease.  That\nthe livelihood to be procured from the forest would be attended with\nperil, now that order had been restored and the forest was no longer\nneglected, was certain; and he rejoiced that Humphrey had, by his\nassiduity and intelligence, made the farm so profitable as it promised\nto be.  Indeed he felt that, if necessary, they could live upon the\nproceeds of the farm, and not run the risk of imprisonment by stalking\nthe deer.  But he had told the intendant that he considered the game as\nthe king's property, and he was resolved that he would at all events run\nthe risk, although he would no longer permit Humphrey so to do.  \"If\nanything happens to me,\" thought Edward, \"Humphrey will still be at the\ncottage to take care of my sisters; and if I am obliged to fly the\ncountry, it will suit well my feelings, as I can then offer my services\nto those who still support the king.\"  With these thoughts, and many\nothers, he amused himself until, late in the evening, he arrived at the\ncottage.  He found all in bed except Humphrey, who had waited for him,\nand to whom he narrated all that had passed.  Humphrey said little in\nreply; he wished to think it over before he gave any opinion.  He told\nEdward that Jacob had been very ill the whole of the day, and had\nrequested Alice to read the Bible to him during the evening.\n\nThe next morning Edward went to Jacob, who for the last ten days had\naltogether kept his bed, and gave him the detail of what had happened at\nthe keeper's lodge.\n\n\"You have been more bold than prudent, Edward,\" replied Jacob; \"but I\ncould not expect you to have spoken otherwise.  You are too proud and\ntoo manly to tell a lie, and I am glad that it is so.  As for your\nupholding the king, although he is now a prisoner in their hands, they\ncannot blame you or punish you for that, as long as you have not weapons\nin your hands; but now that they have taken the forest under their\njurisdiction, you must be careful, for they are the ruling powers at\npresent, and must be obeyed, or the forfeit must be paid.  Still I do\nnot ask you to promise me this or that; I only point out to you that\nyour sisters will suffer by any imprudence on your part; and for their\nsakes be careful.  I say this, Edward, because I feel that my days are\nnumbered, and that in a short time I shall be called away.  You will\nthen have all the load on your shoulders which has been latterly on\nmine.  I have no fear for the result, if you are prudent; these few\nmonths past, during which I have only been a burden to you, have proved\nthat you and Humphrey can find a living here for yourselves and your\nsisters; and it is fortunate, now that the forest laws are about to be\nput in force, that you have made the farm so profitable.  If I might\nadvise, let your hunting in the forest be confined to the wild cattle;\nthey are not game, and the forest laws do not extend to them, and the\nmeat is as valuable as venison; that is to say, it does not sell so\ndear, but there is more of it; but stick to the farm as much as you can;\nfor you see, Edward, you do not look like a low-born forester, nor ought\nyou to do so; and the more quiet you keep, the better.  As for Oswald\nPartridge, you may trust him; I know him well, and he will prove your\nfriend for my sake, as soon as he hears that I am dead.  Leave me now, I\nwill talk to you again in the evening.  Send Alice to me, my dear boy.\"\n\nEdward was much distressed to perceive the change which had taken place\nin old Jacob.  He was evidently much worse; but Edward had no idea how\nmuch worse he was.  Edward assisted Humphrey in the farm, and in the\nevening again went to Jacob, and then told him of the arrangement he had\nmade to meet Oswald Partridge on the following morning.\n\n\"Go, my boy,\" said Jacob; \"be as intimate with him as you can, and make\na friend of him--nay, if it should be necessary, you may tell him who\nyou are; I did think of telling him myself, as it might be important to\nyou one day as evidence.  I think you had better bring him here\nto-morrow night, Edward; tell him I am dying, and wish to speak to him\nbefore I go.  Alice will read the Bible to me now, and I will talk with\nyou another time.\"\n\nEarly the next morning Edward set off to the appointed rendezvous with\nOswald Partridge.  The Clump Royal, as it was called, from the peculiar\nsize and beauty of the oaks, was about seven miles from the cottage; and\nat the hour and time indicated Edward, with his gun in his hand, and\nSmoker lying beside him, was leaning against one of those monarchs of\nthe forest.  He did not wait long.  Oswald Partridge, similarly\nprovided, made his appearance, and Edward advanced to meet him.\n\n\"Welcome, Oswald,\" said Edward.\n\n\"And welcome to you also, my fine lad,\" replied Oswald.  \"I have been\nhard questioned about you since we parted--first, by the Roundhead\nHeatherstone, who plied me in all manner of ways to find out whether you\nare what you assert, the grandson of Jacob,--or some other person.  I\nreally believe that he fancies you are the Duke of York--but he could\nnot get any more from me than what I knew.  I told him that your\ngrandfather's cottage was his own property, and a grant to his\nforefathers: that you were brought up at Arnwood, and had joined your\ngrandfather after the death of the colonel, and the murderous burning of\nthe house and all within it by his party.  But the pretty little\ndaughter was more curious still.  She cross-questioned me in every way\nwhen her father was not present, and at last begged me as a favour to\ntell you not to take the deer, as her father was very strict in his\nduty, and, if caught, you would be imprisoned.\"\n\n\"Many thanks to her for her caution, but I hope to take one to-day,\nnevertheless,\" replied Edward; \"a hart royal is not meat for Roundheads,\nalthough the king's servants may feast on them.\"\n\n\"That's truly said.  Well, now I must see your woodcraft.  You shall be\nthe leader of the chase.\"\n\n\"Think you we can harbour a stag about here?\"\n\n\"Yes, in this month, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Let us walk on,\" said Edward.  \"The wind is fresh from the eastern\nquarter: we will face it, if you please--or rather, keep it blowing on\nour right cheek for the present.\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" replied Oswald; and they walked for about half an hour.\n\n\"This is the slot of a doe,\" said Edward, in a low voice, pointing to\nthe marks; \"yonder thicket is a likely harbour for the stag.\"  They\nproceeded, and Edward pointed out to Oswald the slot of the stag into\nthe thicket.  They then walked round, and found no marks of the animal\nhaving left his lair.\n\n\"He is here,\" whispered Edward; and Oswald made a sign for Edward to\nenter the thicket, while he walked to the other side.  Edward entered\nthe thicket cautiously.  In the centre he perceived, through the trees,\na small cleared spot, covered with high fern, and felt certain that the\nstag was lying there.  He forced his way on his knees till he had a\nbetter view of the place, and then cocked his gun.  The noise induced\nthe stag to move his antlers, and discover his lair.  Edward could just\nperceive the eye of the animal through the heath; he waited till the\nbeast settled again, took steady aim, and fired.  At the report of the\ngun another stag sprung up and burst away.  Oswald fired and wounded it,\nbut the animal made off, followed by the dogs.  Edward, who hardly knew\nwhether he had missed or not, but felt almost certain that he had not,\nhastened out of the thicket to join in the chase; and, as he passed\nthrough the fern patch, perceived that his quarry lay dead.  He then\nfollowed the chase, and, being very fleet of foot, soon came up with\nOswald, and passed him without speaking.  The stag made for a swampy\nground, and finally took to the water beyond it, and stood at bay.\nEdward then waited for Oswald, who came up with him.\n\n\"He has soiled,\" said Edward, \"and now you may go in and kill him.\"\n\nOswald, eager in the chase, hastened up to where the dogs and stag were\nin the water, and put a bullet through the animal's head.\n\nEdward went to him, assisted him to drag the stag out of the water, and\nthen Oswald cut its throat, and proceeded to perform the usual offices.\n\n\"How did you happen to miss him?\" said Oswald, \"for these are my shots?\"\n\n\"Because I never fired at him,\" said Edward; \"my quarry lies dead in the\nfern--and a fine fellow he is.\"\n\n\"This is a warrantable stag,\" said Oswald.\n\n\"Yes, but mine is a hart royal, as you will see when we go back.\"\n\nAs soon as Oswald had done his work, he hung the quarters of the animal\non an oak-tree, and went back with Edward.\n\n\"Where did you hit him, Edward?\" said Oswald, as they walked along.\n\n\"I could only see his eye through the fern, and I must have hit him\nthereabouts.\"\n\nOn their arrival at the spot Oswald found that Edward had put the ball\nright into the eye of the stag.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"you made me suppose that you knew something of our\ncraft, but I did not believe that you were so apt as you thought\nyourself to be.  I now confess that you are a master, as far as I can\nsee, in all branches of the craft.  This is, indeed, a hart royal.\nTwenty-five antlers, as I live!  Come, out with your knife, and let us\nfinish; for if we are to go to the cottage we have no time to lose.  It\nwill be dark in half an hour.\"  They hung all the quarters of the stag\nas before, and then set off for Jacob's cottage; Edward proposing that\nOswald should take the cart and pony to carry the meat home the next\nmorning, and that he would accompany him to bring it back.\n\n\"That will do capitally,\" said Oswald; \"and here we are, if I recollect\nright, and I hope there is something to eat.\"\n\n\"No fear of that--Alice will be prepared for us,\" replied Edward.\n\nTheir dinner was ready for them; and Oswald praised the cooking.  He was\nmuch surprised to find that Jacob had four grandchildren.  After dinner\nhe went into Jacob's room, and remained with him more than an hour.\nDuring this conference Jacob confided to Oswald that the four children\nwere the sons and daughters of Colonel Beverley, supposed to have been\nburnt in the firing of Arnwood.  Oswald came out, much surprised as well\nas pleased with the information, and with the confidence reposed in him.\nHe saluted Edward and Humphrey respectfully, and said, \"I was not aware\nwith whom I was in company, sir, as you may well imagine; but the\nknowledge of it has made my heart glad.\"\n\n\"Nay, Oswald,\" replied Edward, \"remember that I am still Edward\nArmitage, and that we are the grandchildren of old Jacob.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir, I will, for your own sake, not forget that such is to\nbe supposed to be the case.  I assure you I think it very fortunate that\nJacob has confided the secret to me, as it may be in my power to be\nuseful.  I little thought that I should ever have had my dinner cooked\nby a daughter of Colonel Beverley.\"\n\nThey then entered into a long conversation, during which Oswald\nexpressed his opinion that the old man was sinking fast, and would not\nlast more than three or four days.  Oswald had a bed made up for him on\nthe floor of the room where Edward and Humphrey slept, and the next\nmorning they set off, at an early hour, with the pony and cart, loaded\nit with the venison, and took it across the forest to the keeper's\nlodge.  It was so late when they arrived that Edward consented to pass\nthe night there, and return home on the following morning.  Oswald went\ninto the sitting-room to speak with the Intendant of the forest, leaving\nEdward in the kitchen with Phoebe, the maidservant.  He told the\nIntendant that he had brought home some fine venison, and wished his\norders about it.  He also stated that he had been assisted by Edward\nArmitage, who had brought the venison home for him in his cart, and who\nwas now in the kitchen, as he would be obliged to pass the night there;\nand, on being questioned, he was lavish in his praises of Edward's skill\nand knowledge of woodcraft, which he declared to be superior to his own.\n\n\"It proves that the young man has had much practice, at all events,\"\nreplied Mr Heatherstone, smiling.  \"He has been living at the king's\nexpense, but he must not follow it up at the cost of the Parliament.  It\nwould be well to take this young man as a ranger if we could; for\nalthough he is opposed to us, yet, if he once took our service, he would\nbe faithful, I am sure.  You can propose it to him, Oswald.  The\nhaunches of that hart royal must be sent up to General Cromwell\nto-morrow: the remainder we will give directions for as soon as I have\nmade up my mind how to dispose of it.\"\n\nOswald left the room, and came back to Edward.  \"General Cromwell is to\nhave the haunches of your stag,\" said he to Edward, smiling; \"and the\nIntendant proposes that you should take service as one of the rangers.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" replied Edward, \"but I've no fancy to find venison for\nGeneral Cromwell and his Roundheads; and so you may tell the Intendant,\nwith many thanks for his good-will towards me, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"I thought as much; but the man meant kindly, that I really think.  Now,\nPhoebe, what can you give us to eat, for we are hungry?\"\n\n\"You shall be served directly,\" replied Phoebe.  \"I have some steaks on\nthe fire.\"\n\n\"And you must find a bed for my young friend here.\"\n\n\"I have none in the house, but there is plenty of good straw over the\nstables.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" replied Edward; \"I'm not particular.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.  Why should you be?\" replied Phoebe, who was rather old\nand rather cross.  \"If you mount the ladder that you will see against\nthe wall, you will find a good bed when you are at the top of it.\"\n\nOswald was about to remonstrate, but Edward held up his finger, and no\nmore was said.\n\nAs soon as they had finished their supper Phoebe proposed that they\nshould go to bed.  It was late, and she would sit up no longer.  Edward\nrose and went out, followed by Oswald, who had given up the keeper's\nhouse to the intendant and his daughter, and slept in the cottage of one\nof the rangers, about a quarter of a mile off.  After some conversation\nthey shook hands and parted, as Edward intended returning very early the\nnext morning, being anxious about old Jacob.\n\nEdward went up the ladder into the loft.  There was no door to shut out\nthe wind, which blew piercingly cold, and after a time he found himself\nso chilled that he could not sleep.  He rose to see if he could not find\nsome protection from the wind by getting more into a corner; for\nalthough Phoebe had told him that there was plenty of straw, it proved\nthat there was very little indeed in the loft, barely enough to lie down\nupon.  Edward, after a time, descended the ladder to walk in the yard,\nthat by exercise he might recover the use of his limbs.  At last,\nturning to and fro, he cast his eyes up to the window of the bedroom\nabove the kitchen, where he perceived a light was still burning.  He\nthought it was Phoebe, the maid, going to bed; and with no very gracious\nfeelings towards her for having deprived him of his own night's rest, he\nwas wishing that she might have the toothache or something else to keep\nher awake, when suddenly through the white window curtain he perceived a\nbroad light in the room--it increased every moment--and he saw the\nfigure of a female rush past it, and attempt to open the window--the\ndrawing of the curtains showed him that the room was on fire.  A\nmoment's thought, and he ran for the ladder by which he had ascended to\nthe loft, and placed it against the window.  The flames were less\nbright, and he could not see the female who had been at the window when\nhe went for the ladder.  He ascended quickly, and burst open the\ncasement--the smoke poured out in such volumes that it nearly suffocated\nhim, but he went in; and as soon as he was inside, he stumbled against\nthe body of the person who had attempted to open the window, but who had\nfallen down senseless.  As he raised the body, the fire, which had been\nsmothered from want of air when all the windows and doors were closed,\nnow burst out, and he was scorched before he could get on the ladder\nagain, with the body in his arms; but he succeeded in getting it down\nsafe.  Perceiving that the clothes were on fire, he held them till they\nwere extinguished, and then, for the first time, discovered that he had\nbrought down the daughter of the intendant of the forest.  There was no\ntime to be lost, so Edward carried her into the stable and left her\nthere, still insensible, upon the straw, in a spare stall; while he\nhastened to alarm the house.  The watering-butt for the horses was\noutside the stable; Edward caught up the pail, filled it, and hastening\nup the ladder, threw it into the room, and then descended for more.\n\nBy this time Edward's continual calls of \"Fire!  Fire!\" had aroused the\npeople of the house, and also of the cottages adjacent.  Mr\nHeatherstone came out half dressed, and with horror on his countenance.\nPhoebe followed screaming, and the other people now hastened from the\ncottages.\n\n\"Save her!  My daughter is in the room!\" exclaimed Mr Heatherstone.\n\"Oh, save her, or let me do so!\" cried the poor man in agony; but the\nfire burst out of the window in such force, that any attempt would have\nbeen in vain.\n\n\"Oswald,\" cried Edward to him, \"let the people pass the water up to me\nas fast as possible.  They can do no good by looking on.\"\n\nOswald set the men to the work, and Edward was now supplied with water\nso fast that the fire began to diminish.  The window was now\napproachable, and a few more buckets enabled him to put one foot into\nthe room, and then every moment the flames and smoke decreased.\n\nMeanwhile it would be impossible to describe the agony of the intendant,\nwho would have rushed up the ladder into the flames had he not been held\nby some of the men.  \"My daughter!  My child!--burnt--burnt to death!\"\nexclaimed he, clasping his hands.\n\nAt that moment a voice in the crowd called out, \"There were four burnt\nat Arnwood!\"\n\n\"God of heaven!\" exclaimed Mr Heatherstone, falling down into a swoon,\nin which state he was carried to a neighbouring cottage.\n\nMeanwhile the supply of water enabled Edward to put out the fire\naltogether; the furniture of the room was burnt, but the fire had\nextended no farther; and when Edward was satisfied that there was no\nmore danger, he descended the ladder, and left it to others to see that\nall was safe.  He then called Oswald to him, and desired that he would\naccompany him to the stable.\n\n\"Oh sir,\" replied Oswald, \"this is dreadful!  And such a sweet young\nlady too.\"\n\n\"She is safe and well,\" replied Edward; \"I think so, at least.  I\nbrought her down the ladder and put her in the stable before I attempted\nto put out the fire.  See, there she is; she has not recovered yet from\nher swoon.  Bring some water.  She breathes!  Thank God!  There, that\nwill do, Oswald, she is recovering.  Now let us cover her up in your\ncloak, and carry her to your cottage.  We will recover her there.\"\n\nOswald folded up the still unconscious girl in his cloak, and carried\nher away in his arms, followed by Edward.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the cottage, the inmates of which were all\nbusy at the keeper's lodge, they put her on a bed, and very soon\nrestored her to consciousness.\n\n\"Where is my father?\" cried Patience, as soon as she was sufficiently\nrecovered.\n\n\"He is safe and well, miss,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Is the house burnt down?\"\n\n\"No.  The fire is all out again.\"\n\n\"Who saved me?  Tell me.\"\n\n\"Young Armitage, miss.\"\n\n\"Who is he?  Oh, I recollect now; but I must go to my father.  Where is\nhe?\"\n\n\"In the other cottage, miss.\"\n\nPatience attempted to stand, but found that she was too much exhausted,\nand she fell back again on the bed.  \"I can't stand,\" said she.  \"Bring\nmy father to me.\"\n\n\"I will, miss,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Will you stay here, Edward?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Edward.  He went out of the cottage-door, and remained\nthere while Oswald went to Mr Heatherstone.\n\nOswald found him sensible, but in deep distress, as may be imagined.\n\"The fire is all out, sir,\" said Oswald.\n\n\"I care not for that.  My poor, poor child!\"\n\n\"Your child is safe, sir,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Safe, did you say?\" cried Mr Heatherstone, starting up.  \"Safe;\nwhere?\"\n\n\"In my cottage.  She has sent me for you.\"\n\nMr Heatherstone rushed out, passed by Edward, who was standing at the\ndoor of the other cottage, and was in his daughter's arms.  Oswald came\nout to Edward, who then detailed to him the way in which he had saved\nthe girl.\n\n\"Had it not been for the ill-nature of that girl Phoebe, in sending me\nto sleep where there was no straw, they would all have been burnt,\"\nobserved Edward.\n\n\"She gave you an opportunity of rewarding good for evil,\" observed\nOswald.\n\n\"Yes, but I am burnt very much in my arm,\" said Edward.  \"Have you\nanything that will be good for it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I have: wait a moment.\"\n\nOswald went into the cottage and returned with some salve, with which he\ndressed Edward's arm, which proved to be very severely burnt.\n\n\"How grateful the Intendant ought to be--and will be, I have no doubt!\"\nobserved Oswald.\n\n\"And for that very reason I shall saddle my pony and ride home as fast\nas I can; and, do you hear, Oswald, do not show him where I live.\"\n\n\"I hardly know how I can refuse him, if he requires it.\"\n\n\"But you must not.  He will be offering me a situation in the forest, by\nway of showing his gratitude; and I will accept of none.  I have no\nobjection to save his daughter, as I would save the daughter of my worst\nenemy, or my worst enemy himself, from such a dreadful death; but I do\nnot want their thanks or offers of service.  I will accept nothing from\na Roundhead; and as for the venison in the forest, it belongs to the\nking, and I shall help myself whenever I think proper.  Good-bye,\nOswald, you will call and see us when you have time?\"\n\n\"I will be with you before the week is out, depend upon it,\" replied\nOswald.\n\nEdward then asked Oswald to saddle his pony for him, as his arm\nprevented him from doing it himself, and as soon as it was done he rode\naway for the cottage.\n\nEdward rode fast, for he was anxious to get home and ascertain the state\nof poor old Jacob; and, moreover, his burnt arm was very painful.  He\nwas met by Humphrey about a mile from the cottage, who told him that he\ndid not think that the old man could last many hours, and that he was\nvery anxious to see him.  As the pony was quite tired with the fast pace\nthat Edward had ridden, Edward pulled up to a walk, and as they went\nalong acquainted Humphrey with what had passed.\n\n\"Is your arm very painful?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is indeed,\" replied Edward; \"but it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"No, of course not, but it may be made more easy.  I know what will do\nit some good; for I recollect when Benjamin burnt his hand at Arnwood,\nwhat they applied to it, and it gave him great relief.\"\n\n\"Yes, very likely; but I am not aware that we have any drugs or medicine\nin the cottage.  But here we are: will you take Billy to the stable,\nwhile I go on to old Jacob?\"\n\n\"Thank God that you are come, Edward,\" said the old forester, \"for I was\nanxious to see you before I die; and something tells me that I have but\na short time to remain here.\"\n\n\"Why should you say so!--do you feel very ill?\"\n\n\"No, not ill; but I feel that I am sinking fast.  Recollect that I am an\nold man, Edward.\"\n\n\"Not so very old, Jacob; Oswald said that you were not more than sixty\nyears old.\"\n\n\"Oswald knows nothing about it.  I am past seventy six, Edward; and you\nknow, Edward, the Bible says that the days of men are threescore years\nand ten; so that I am beyond the mark.  And now, Edward, I have but few\nwords to say.  Be careful--if not for your own sake, at least for your\nlittle sisters'.  You are young, but you are strong and powerful above\nyour years, and can better protect them than I could.  I see darker days\nyet coming--but it is His will, and who shall doubt that that is right?\nI pray you not to make your birth and lineage known as yet--it can do no\ngood, and it may do harm--and if you can be persuaded to live in the\ncottage, and to live on the farm, which will now support you all, it\nwill be better.  Do not get into trouble about the venison, which they\nnow claim as their own.  You will find some money in the bag in my\nchest, sufficient to buy all you want for a long while--but take care of\nit; for there is no saying but you may require it.  And now, Edward,\ncall your brother and sisters to me, that I may bid them farewell.  I\nam, as we all are, sinful, but I trust in the mercy of God through Jesus\nChrist.  Edward, I have done my duty towards you, as well as I have been\nable; but promise me one thing--that you will read the Bible and prayers\nevery morning and evening, as I have always done, after I am gone;\npromise me that, Edward.\"\n\n\"I promise you that it shall be done, Jacob,\" replied Edward, \"and I\nwill not forget your other advice.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Edward.  Now call the children.\"\n\nEdward summoned his sisters and Humphrey.\n\n\"Humphrey, my good boy,\" said Jacob, \"recollect that in the midst of\nlife we are in death; and that there is no security for young or old.\nYou or your brother may be cut off in your youth; one may be taken, and\nthe other left.  Recollect, your sisters depend upon you, and do not\ntherefore be rash: I fear that you will run too much risk after the wild\ncattle, for you are always scheming after taking them.  Be careful,\nHumphrey, for you can ill be spared.  Hold to the farm as it now is; it\nwill support you all.  My dear Alice and Edith, I am dying; very soon I\nshall be laid by your brothers in my grave.  Be good children, and look\nup to your brothers for everything.  And now, kiss me, Alice: you have\nbeen a great comfort to me, for you have read the Bible to me when I\ncould no longer read myself.  May your deathbed be as well attended as\nmine has been, and may you live happily, and die the death of a\nChristian!  Good-bye, and may God bless you.  Bless you, Edith; may you\ngrow up as good and as innocent as you are now.  Farewell, Humphrey--\nfarewell, Edward--my eyes are dim--pray for me, children.  O God of\nmercy--pardon my many sins, and receive my soul, through Jesus Christ.\nAmen, amen.\"\n\nThese were the last words spoken by the old forester.  The children, who\nwere kneeling by the side of the bed, praying as he had requested, when\nthey rose up, found that he was dead.  They all wept bitterly, for they\ndearly loved the good old man.  Alice remained sobbing in Edward's arms,\nand Edith in Humphrey's, and it was long before the brothers could\nconsole them.  Humphrey at last said to Alice, \"You hurt poor Edward's\narm--you don't know how painful it is!  Come, dears, let us go into the\nother room, and get something to take the pain away.\"\n\nThese requests diverted the attention at the same time that it roused\nfresh sympathy in the little girls--they all went into the sitting-room.\nHumphrey gave his sisters some potatoes to scrape upon a piece of\nlinen, while he took off Edward's coat, and turned up his shirt sleeves.\nThe scraped potatoes were then laid on the burn, and Edward said they\ngave him great relief.  Some more were then scraped by the little girls,\nwho could not, however, repress their occasional sobs.  Humphrey then\ntold them that Edward had had nothing to eat, and that they must get him\nsome supper.  This again occupied them for some time; and when the\nsupper was ready, they all sat down to it.  They went to bed early, but\nnot before Edward had read a chapter out of the Bible, and the prayers,\nas old Jacob had always done; and this again caused their tears to flow\nafresh.\n\n\"Come, Alice dear, you and Edith must go to bed,\" said Humphrey.\n\nThe little girls threw themselves into their brothers' arms; and having\nwept for some time, Alice raised herself, and taking Edith by the hand,\nled her away to the bedroom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\n\"Humphrey,\" said Edward, \"the sooner all this is over the better.  As\nlong as poor Jacob's body remains in the cottage there will be nothing\nbut distress with the poor girls.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied Humphrey; \"where shall we bury him?\"\n\n\"Under the great oak-tree, at the back of the cottage,\" replied Edward.\n\"One day the old man said to me that he should like to be buried under\none of the oaks of the forest.\"\n\n\"Well then, I will go and dig his grave to-night,\" replied Humphrey;\n\"the moon is bright, and I shall have it finished before morning.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I cannot help you, Humphrey.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you are hurt; but I want no help, Edward.  If you will\nlie down a little, perhaps you will be able to sleep.  Let us change the\npotato poultice before you go on.\"\n\nHumphrey put the fresh dressing on Edward's arm; and Edward, who was\nvery much exhausted, lay down in his clothes on the bed.  Humphrey went\nout, and having found his tools, set to his task; he worked hard, and\nbefore morning had finished.  He then went in, and took his place on the\nbed by the side of Edward, who was in a sound sleep.  At daylight\nHumphrey rose, and waked Edward.  \"All is ready, Edward; but I fear you\nmust help me to put poor Jacob in the cart; do you think you can?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; my arm is much easier, and I feel very different from what I\ndid last night.  If you will go and get the cart I will see what I can\ndo in the meantime.\"\n\nWhen Humphrey returned he found Edward had selected a sheet to wind the\nbody in, but could not do more till Humphrey came to help him.  They\nthen wrapped it round the body, and carried it out of the cottage, and\nput it into the cart.\n\n\"Now, Edward, shall we call our sisters?\"\n\n\"No, not yet; let us have the body laid in the grave first, and then we\nwill call them.\"\n\nThey dragged the body on the cart to the grave, and laid it in it, and\nthen returned back and put the pony in the stable again.\n\n\"Are there not prayers proper for reading over the dead?\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"I believe that there are, but they are not in the Bible; so we must\nread some portion of the Bible,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes, I think there is one of the Psalms which it would be right to\nread, Edward,\" said Humphrey, turning over the leaves; \"here it is, the\nninetieth, in which you recollect it says `that the days of man are\nthreescore years and ten.'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Edward, \"and we will read this one also,--the 146th.\"\n\n\"Are our sisters risen, do you think?\"\n\n\"I am sure that they are,\" replied Humphrey, \"and I will go to them.\"\n\nHumphrey went to the door, and said, \"Alice--Alice and Edith--come out\nimmediately.\"  They were both ready dressed.\n\nEdward took the Bible under his arm, and Alice by the hand.  Humphrey\nled Edith until they arrived at the grave, when the two little girls saw\nthe covered body of Jacob lying in it.\n\n\"Kneel down,\" said Edward, opening the Bible.  And they all knelt down\nby the grave.  Edward read the two Psalms, and then closed the book.\nThe little girls took one last look at the body, and then turned away\nweeping to the cottage.  Edward and Humphrey filled up the grave, and\nthen followed their sisters home.\n\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" said Humphrey, wiping his eyes.  \"Poor old Jacob!\nI'll put a paling round his grave.\"\n\n\"Come in, Humphrey,\" said Edward.\n\nEdward sat down upon old Jacob's chair, and took Alice and Edith to him.\nPutting his arm round each, he said:\n\n\"Alice and Edith, my dear little sisters, we have lost a good friend,\nand one to whose memory we cannot be too grateful.  He saved us from\nperishing in the flames which burnt down our father's house, and has\nprotected us here ever since.  He is gone; for it has pleased God to\nsummon him to Him, and we must bow to the will of Heaven; and here we\nare, brothers and sisters, orphans, and with no one to look to for\nprotection but Heaven.  Here we are, away from the rest of the world,\nliving for one another.  What then must we do?  We must love one another\ndearly, and help one another.  I will do my part, if my life is spared,\nand so will Humphrey, and so will you, my dear sisters.  I can answer\nfor all.  Now it is no use to lament--we must all work, and work\ncheerfully; and we will pray every morning and every night that God will\nbless our endeavours, and enable us to provide for ourselves, and live\nhere in peace and safety.  Kiss me, dear Alice and Edith, and kiss\nHumphrey, and kiss one another.  Let these kisses be the seals to our\nbond; and let us put our trust in Him who only is a father to the widow\nand the orphan.  And now let us pray.\"\n\nEdward and the children repeated the Lord's Prayer, and then rose up.\nThey went to their respective employments, and the labour of the day\nsoon made them composed, although then, for many days afterwards, it was\nbut occasionally that a smile was seen upon their lips.\n\nThus passed a week, by which time Edward's arm was so far well that it\ngave him no pain, and he was able to assist Humphrey in the work on the\nfarm.  The snow had disappeared, and the spring, although it had been\nchecked for a time, now made rapid advances.  Constant occupation and\nthe return of fine weather both had the effect of restoring the serenity\nof their minds; and while Humphrey was preparing the paling to fix round\nthe grave of old Jacob, Alice and Edith collected the wild violets which\nnow peeped forth on sheltered spots, and planted the roots over the\ngrave.  Edward also procured all the early flowers he could collect, and\nassisted his sisters in their task; and thus, in planting it, and\nputting up the paling, the grave of the old man became their constant\nwork-ground; and when their labour was done, they would still remain\nthere and talk over his worth.  The Sunday following the burial, the\nweather being fine and warm, Edward proposed that they should read the\nusual service, which had been selected by old Jacob, at the grave, and\nnot in the cottage, as formerly; and this they continued afterwards to\ndo, whenever the weather would permit; thus did old Jacob's\nresting-placing become their church, and overpower them with those\nfeelings of love and devotion which give efficacy to prayer.  As soon as\nthe paling was finished Humphrey put up a board against the oak-tree,\nwith the simple words carved on it, \"Jacob Armitage.\"\n\nEdward had every day expected that Oswald Partridge would have called\nupon him, as he had promised to do before the week was out; but Oswald\nhad not made his appearance, much to Edward's surprise.  A month passed\naway; Edward's arm was now quite well, and still Oswald came not.  One\nmorning Humphrey and Edward were conversing upon many points--the\nprincipal of which was upon Edward going to Lymington, for they were now\nin want of flour and meal--when Edward thought of what old Jacob had\ntold him relative to the money that he would find in his chest.  He went\ninto Jacob's room and opened the chest, at the bottom of which, under\nthe clothes, he found a leather bag, which he brought out to Humphrey;\non opening it, they were much surprised to find in it more than sixty\ngold pieces, besides a great deal of silver coin.\n\n\"Surely this is a great sum of money,\" observed Humphrey.  \"I don't know\nwhat is the price of things but it appears to me that it ought to last\nus a long while.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" replied Edward.  \"I wish Oswald Partridge would come,\nfor I want to ask him many questions.  I don't know the price of flour\nor anything else we have to purchase, nor do I know what ought to be\npaid for venison.  I don't like to go to Lymington till I see him, for\nthat reason.  If he does not come soon I shall ride over and see what is\nthe matter.\"\n\nEdward then replaced the money in the chest, and he and Humphrey then\nwent out to the farm-yard to go on with their work.\n\nIt was not until six weeks after the death of old Jacob that Oswald\nPartridge made his appearance.\n\n\"How is the old man, sir?\" was his first question.\n\n\"He was buried a few days after you left,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"I expected as much,\" said the forester.  \"Peace be with him--he was a\ngood man.  And how is your arm?\"\n\n\"Nearly well,\" replied Edward.  \"Now, sit down, Oswald, for I have a\ngreat deal to say to you; and first let me ask you what has detained you\nfrom coming here according to your promise?\"\n\n\"Simply, and in few words--murder.\"\n\n\"Murder!\" exclaimed Edward.\n\n\"Yes, deliberate murder, sir; in short, they have beheaded the king--\nbeheaded King Charles, our sovereign.\"\n\n\"Have they dared to do it?\"\n\n\"They have,\" replied Oswald.  \"We know little that is going on in the\nforest; but when I saw you last I heard that he was then in London, and\nwas to be tried.\"\n\n\"Tried!\" exclaimed Edward.  \"How could they try a king?  By the laws of\nour country a man must be tried by his equals; and where were his\nequals?\"\n\n\"Majesty becomes nought, I suppose,\" replied Oswald; \"but still it is as\nI say.  Two days after you left the Intendant hastened up to London; and\nfrom what I have understood, he was strongly opposed to the deed, and\ndid all he could to prevent it, but it was of no use.  When he left he\ngave me strict injunctions not to go away from the cottage for an hour,\nas his daughter was left alone, and as I promised, I could not come to\nyou; but, nevertheless, Patience received letters from him, and told me\nwhat I tell you.\"\n\n\"You have not dined, Oswald?\" said Edward.\n\n\"No, that I have not.\"\n\n\"Alice, dear, get some dinner, will you?  And Oswald, while you dine,\nexcuse me if I leave you for a while.  Your intelligence has so\nastounded me that I can listen to nothing else till I have had a little\nwhile to commune with myself and subdue my feelings.\"\n\nEdward was indeed in a state of mind which required calming down.  He\nquitted the cottage and walked out for some distance into the forest in\ndeep thought.\n\n\"Murdered at last!\" exclaimed he.  \"Yes, well may it be called murder,\nand no one to save him--not a blow struck in his defence--not an arm\nraised.  How much gallant blood has been shed in vain!  Spirit of my\nfathers--didst thou leave none of thy mettle and thy honour behind thee?\nOr has all England become craven?  Well, the time will come; and if I\ncan no longer hope to fight for my king, at all events I can fight\nagainst those who have murdered him.\"\n\nSuch were Edward's thoughts as he wandered through the forest, and more\nthan an hour elapsed before his impetuous blood could return to its\nusual flow; at last, more calm, he returned to the cottage, and listened\nto the details which Oswald now gave to him of what he had heard.\n\nWhen Oswald had finished, Edward asked him whether the Intendant had\nreturned.\n\n\"Yes, or I should not have been here,\" replied Oswald.  \"He came back\nyesterday, looking most disconsolate and grave, and I hear that he\nreturns to London in a few days.  Indeed, he told me so himself, for I\nrequested permission to come over to see your grandfather.  He said that\nI might go, but must return soon, as he must go back to London.  I\nbelieve, from what Miss Patience told me, and what I have seen myself,\nthat he is sincerely amazed and vexed at what has taken place; and so\nindeed are many more, who, although opposed to the king's method of\ngovernment, never had an idea that things should have turned out as they\nhave done.  I have a message from him to you, which is, that he begs you\nwill come to see him, that he may thank you for the preservation of his\nchild.\"\n\n\"I will take his thanks from you, Oswald: that will do as well as if he\ngave them me in person.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps so; but I have another message from another party, which\nis, the young lady herself.  She desires me to tell you that she will\nnever be happy till she has seen you, and thanked you for your courage\nand kindness; and that you have no right to put her under such an\nobligation, and not give her an opportunity of expressing what she\nfeels.  Now, Mr Edward, I am certain that she is earnest in what she\nsays, and she made me promise that I would persuade you to come.  I\ncould not refuse her, for she is a dear little creature; as her father\nwill go to London in a few days, you may ride over and see her without\nany fear of being affronted by any offers which he may make to you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Edward, \"I have no great objection to see her again, for\nshe was very kind to me; and as you say that the Intendant will not be\nthere I perhaps may come.  But now I must talk to you about other\nmatters.\"\n\nEdward then put many questions to Oswald relative to the value of\nvarious articles, and to the best method of disposing of his venison.\n\nOswald answered all his questions, and Edward took down notes and\ndirections on paper.\n\nOswald remained with them for two days, and then bade them farewell,\nexacting a promise from Edward that he would come to the ranger's\ncottage as soon as he could.  \"Should the Intendant come back before he\nis expected, I will come over and let you know; but I think, from what I\nheard him say, he expected to be at least a month in London.\"\n\nEdward promised that Oswald should see him in less than ten days, and\nOswald set out on his journey.\n\n\"Humphrey,\" said Edward, as soon as Oswald was gone, \"I have made up my\nmind to go to Lymington to-morrow.  We must have some flour, and many\nother articles, which Alice says she can no longer do without.\"\n\n\"Why should we not both go, Edward?\" replied Humphrey.\n\n\"No, not this time,\" replied Edward.  \"I have to find out many things\nand many people, and I had rather go by myself; besides, I cannot allow\nmy sisters to be left alone.  I do not consider there is any danger, I\nadmit; but something might happen to them.  I should never forgive\nmyself.  Still, it is necessary that you should go to Lymington with me\nsome time or another, that you may know where to purchase and sell, if\nrequired.  What I propose is, that I will ask Oswald to come and stay\nhere a couple of days.  We will then leave him in charge of our sisters,\nand go to Lymington together.\"\n\n\"You are right, Edward; that will be the best plan.\"\n\nAs Humphrey made this remark, Oswald re-entered the cottage.\n\n\"I will tell you why I have returned, Mr Edward,\" said Oswald.  \"It is\nof no consequence whether I return now or to-morrow.  It is now early,\nand as you intend going to Lymington, it occurred to me that I had\nbetter go with you.  I can then show you all you want, which will be\nmuch better than going by yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Oswald, I am much obliged to you,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Humphrey, we will get the cart out immediately, or we shall be late.\nWill you get it, Humphrey?  For I must go for some money, and speak to\nAlice.\"\n\nHumphrey went immediately to put the pony in the cart, when Edward said:\n\n\"Oswald, you must not call me Mr Edward, even when we are alone; if you\ndo, you will be calling me so before other people, and, therefore,\nrecollect in future, it must be plain Edward.\"\n\n\"Since you wish it, certainly,\" replied Oswald; \"indeed it would be\nbetter; for a slip of the tongue before other people might create\nsuspicion.\"\n\nThe pony and cart were soon at the door, and Edward, having received\nfurther instructions from Alice, set off for Lymington, accompanied by\nOswald.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\n\"Could you have found your way to Lymington?\" said Oswald, as the pony\ntrotted along.\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" replied Edward; \"but I must have first gone to\nArnwood.  Indeed, had I been alone, I should have done so; but we have\nmade a much shorter cut.\"\n\n\"I did not think that you would have liked to have seen the ruins of\nArnwood,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Not a day passes without my thinking of them,\" replied Edward.  \"I\nshould like to see them.  I should like to see if any one has taken\npossession of the property; for they say it is confiscated.\"\n\n\"I heard that it was to be; but not that it was yet,\" said Oswald: \"but\nwe shall know more when we get to Lymington.  I have not seen it for\nmore than a year.  I hardly think that any one will recognise you.\"\n\n\"I should think not; but I care little if they do.  Indeed, who is there\nto know me?\"\n\n\"Well, my introduction of you will save some surmises, probably; and I\nshall not take you among those who may be inclined to ask questions.\nSee, there is the steeple; we have not more than a quarter of an hour's\ndrive.\"\n\nAs soon as they arrived at Lymington, Oswald directed the way to a small\nhostelrie, to which the keepers and verderers usually resorted.  In\nfact, the landlord was the party who took all the venison off their\nhands, and disposed of it.  They drove into the yard, and, giving the\npony and cart in charge of the hostler, went into the inn, where they\nfound the landlord, and one or two other people, who were drinking.\n\n\"Well, Master Andrew, how fare you?\" said Oswald.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said the corpulent landlord, throwing back his head, and\nputting out his stomach, as he peered at Oswald; \"why, Oswald Partridge,\nas I am a born man.  Where have you been this many a day?\"\n\n\"In the forest, Master Andrew, where there are no few chops and\nchanges.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard you have a sort of Parliamentary keeper, I'm told; and who\nis this with you?\"\n\n\"The grandson of an old friend of yours, now dead, poor old Jacob\nArmitage.\"\n\n\"Jacob dead, poor fellow!  As true as flint was Jacob Armitage, as I'm a\nborn man!  And so he is dead!  Well, we all owe heaven a death.\nForesters and landlords, as well as kings, all must die!\"\n\n\"I have brought Edward Armitage over here to introduce him to you,\nMaster Andrew.  Now that the old man is dead, you must look to him for\nforest meat.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, well, it is scarce now.  I have not had any for some time.\nOld Jacob brought me the last.  You are not one of the Parliamentary\nforesters, then, I presume?\" continued the landlord, turning to Edward.\n\n\"No,\" replied Edward, \"I kill no venison for Roundheads.\"\n\n\"Right, my sapling; right and well said.  The Armitages were all good\nmen and true, and followed the fortunes of the Beverleys; but there are\nno Beverleys to follow now.  Cut off root and branch--more's the pity.\nThat was a sad business.  But come in; we must not talk here, for walls\nhave ears, they say, and one never knows who one dares to speak before\nnow.\"\n\nOswald and Edward then entered with the landlord, and arrangements were\nmade between Master Andrew and the latter for a regular supply of\nvenison during the season at a certain price; but as it would now be\ndangerous to bring it into the town, it was agreed that when there was\nany ready, Edward should come to Lymington and give notice, and the\nlandlord would send out people to bring it in during the night.  This\nbargain concluded, they took a glass with the landlord, and then went\ninto the town to make the necessary purchases.  Oswald took Edward to\nall the shops where the articles he required were to be purchased; some\nthey carried away with them; others, which were too heavy, they left, to\nbe called for with the cart as they went away.  Among other articles,\nEdward required powder and lead, and they went to a gunsmith's where it\nwas to be procured.  While making his purchases, Edward perceived a\nsword, which he thought he had seen before, hanging up against the wall\namong other weapons.\n\n\"What sword is that?\" said he to the man who was measuring out the\npowder.\n\n\"It's not my sword, exactly,\" replied the man; \"and yet I cannot return\nit to its owner or to the family.  It was brought me to be cleaned by\none of Colonel Beverley's people, and before it was called for the house\nwas burnt, and every soul perished.  It was one of the colonel's swords,\nI am sure, as there is E.B. on a silver plate engraved on it.  I have a\nbill owing me for work done at Arnwood, and I have no chance of its\nbeing paid now; so, whether I am to sell the sword, or what to do, I\nhardly know.\"\n\nEdward remained silent for some little while, for he could not trust\nhimself to speak; at last he replied: \"To be candid with you, I am, and\nall my family have been, followers of the Beverley family, and I should\nbe sorry if the colonel's sword was to fall into any other hands.  I\nthink, therefore, if I pay the bill which is due, you may safely let me\nhold the sword as a security for the money, with the express\nunderstanding that if it is ever claimed by the Beverley family, I am to\ngive it up.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Oswald; \"nothing can be fairer or more clearly put.\"\n\n\"I think so, too, young man,\" replied the shopkeeper.  \"Of course, you\nwill leave your name and address?\"\n\n\"Yes; and my friend here will vouch for its being correct,\" replied\nEdward.\n\nThe shopkeeper then produced the account, which Edward paid; and giving\non the paper the name of Edward Armitage, he took possession of the\nsword.  He then paid for the powder and lead, which Oswald took charge\nof, and, hardly able to conceal his joy, hastened out of the shop.\n\n\"Oswald,\" cried Edward, \"I would not part with it for thousands of\npounds.  I never will part with it but with my life.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" replied Oswald; \"and I believe more, that it will never\nbe disgraced in your hands; but do not talk so loud, for there are\nlisteners and spies everywhere.  Is there anything else that you\nrequire?\"\n\n\"No, I think not; the fact is that this sword has put everything out of\nmy head.  If there was anything else I have forgotten it.  Let us go\nback to the inn, and we will harness the pony, and call for the flour\nand oatmeal.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the inn, Oswald went out to the yard to get the\ncart ready, while Edward went into the landlord's room to make inquiries\nas to the quantity of venison he would be able to take off his hands at\na time.  Oswald had taken the sword from Edward, and had put it in the\ncart while he was fastening the harness, when a man came up to the cart,\nand looked earnestly at the sword.  He then examined it, and said to\nOswald:\n\n\"Why, that was Colonel Beverley's, my old master's, sword.  I knowed it\nagain directly.  I took it to Phillips, the gunmaker, to be cleaned.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Oswald; \"I pray what may be your name?\"\n\n\"Benjamin White,\" replied the man; \"I served at Arnwood till the night\nit was burned down; and I have been here ever since.\"\n\n\"And what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"I'm tapster at the `Commonwealth,' in Fish Street--not much of a\nplace.\"\n\n\"Well, well, you stand by the pony, and look that nobody takes anything\nout of the cart, while I go in for some parcels.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure I will; but, I say, forester, how came you by that\nsword?\"\n\n\"I will tell you when I come out again,\" replied Oswald.\n\nOswald then went in to Edward, and told him what had occurred.\n\n\"He will certainly know you, sir, and you must not come out till I can\nget him away,\" said he.\n\n\"You are right, Oswald; but before he goes, ask him what became of my\naunt, and where she was buried, and also ask him where the other\nservants are--perhaps they are at Lymington as well as he.\"\n\n\"I will find it all out,\" replied Oswald, who then left Edward, and\nreturned to the landlord and recommenced conversation.\n\nOswald, on his return, told Benjamin in what manner the sword had been\nprocured from the shopman, by the grandson of old Armitage.\n\n\"I never knew that he had one,\" replied Benjamin; \"nor did I know that\nold Jacob was dead.\"\n\n\"What became of all the women who were at Arnwood?\" inquired Oswald.\n\n\"Why, Agatha married one of the troopers, and went away to London.\"\n\n\"And the others?\"\n\n\"Why, cook went home to her friends, who live about ten miles from here,\nand I have never heard of her since.\"\n\n\"But there were three of them,\" said Oswald.  \"Oh yes; there was\nPhoebe,\" replied Benjamin, looking rather confused.  \"She married a\ntrooper--the jilt!--and went off to London when Agatha did.  If I'd have\nthought that she would have done so I would not have carried her away\nfrom Arnwood behind me on a pillion, as I did; she might have been burnt\nwith the poor children, for all as I cared.\"\n\n\"Was not the old lady killed?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is to say, she killed herself, rather than not kill\nSouthwold.\"\n\n\"Where was she buried?\"\n\n\"In the churchyard, at Saint Faith's, by the mayor and corporation; for\nthere was not money enough found upon her person to pay the expenses of\nher burial.\"\n\n\"And so you are tapster at the `Commonwealth.'  Is it a good inn?\"\n\n\"Can't say much for it.  I shan't stay longer than I can help, I can\ntell you.\"\n\n\"Well, but you must have an easy place, if you can stay away so long as\nyou do now.\"\n\n\"Won't I be mobbed when I go back!  But that's always the case, make\nhaste or not, so it's all one.  However, I do think I must be a-going\nnow, so good-bye, Mr Forester; and tell Jacob Armitage's grandson that\nI shall be glad to see him, for old Jacob's sake; and it's hard but I'll\nfind him something to drink when he calls.\"\n\n\"I will: I shall see him to-morrow,\" replied Oswald, getting into the\ncart; \"so good-bye, Benjamin,\" much to the satisfaction of Oswald, who\nthought that he would never go.\n\nThey went away at a rapid pace, to make up for lost time, and soon\ndisappeared round the corner of the street.  Oswald then got out again,\nsummoned Edward, and having called for the flour and other heavy\narticles, they set off on their return.\n\nDuring the drive Oswald made known to Edward the information which he\nhad gained from Benjamin, and at a late hour they arrived safely at the\ncottage.\n\nThey staid up but a short time, as they were tired; and Oswald had\nresolved upon setting off before daylight on the following morning,\nwhich he did without disturbing any one; for Humphrey was up and dressed\nas soon as Oswald was, and gave him something to eat as he went along.\nAll the others remained fast asleep.  Humphrey walked about a mile with\nOswald, and was returning to the farm, when he thought, as he had not\nexamined his pit-fall for many days, that he might as well look at it,\nbefore he went back.  He therefore struck in the direction in which it\nlay, and arrived there just as the day began to dawn.\n\nIt was the end of March, and the weather was mild for the season.\nHumphrey arrived at the pit, and it was sufficiently light for him to\nperceive that the covering had been broken in, and therefore, in all\nprobability, something must have been trapped.  He sat down and waited\nfor daylight, but at times he thought he heard a heavy breathing, and\nonce a low groan.  This made him more anxious, and he again and again\npeered into the pit, but could not for a long while discover anything,\nuntil at last he thought that he could make out a human figure lying at\nthe bottom.  Humphrey called out, asking if there was any one there.  A\ngroan was the reply, and now Humphrey was horrified at the idea that\nsomebody had fallen into the pit, and had perished, or was perishing for\nwant of succour.  Recollecting that the rough ladder which he had made\nto take the soil up out of the pit was against an oak-tree, close at\nhand, he ran for it, and put it down the pit, and then cautiously\ndescended.  On his arrival at the bottom, his fears were found to be\nverified, for he found the body of a lad half-clothed lying there.  He\nturned it up, as it was lying with its face to the ground, and attempted\nto remove it and to ascertain if there was life in it, which he was\ndelighted to find was the case.  The lad groaned several times, and\nopened his eyes.  Humphrey was afraid that he was not strong enough to\nlift it on his shoulders and carry it up the ladder; but on making the\nattempt, he found out, from exhaustion, the poor lad was light enough\nfor him to carry him, which he did, and safely landed him by the side of\nthe pit.\n\nRecollecting that the watering-place of the herd of cattle was not far\noff, Humphrey then hastened to it, and filled his hat half full of\nwater.  The lad, although he could not speak, drank eagerly, and in a\nfew minutes appeared much recovered.  Humphrey gave him some more, and\nbathed his face and temples.  The sun had now risen, and it was broad\ndaylight.  The lad attempted to speak, but what he did say was in so low\na tone, and evidently in a foreign language, that Humphrey could not\nmake him out.  He therefore made signs to the lad that he was going\naway, and would be back soon; and having, as he thought, made the lad\ncomprehend this, Humphrey ran away to the cottage as fast as he could;\nand as soon as he arrived he called for Edward, who came out, and when\nHumphrey told him in few words what had happened, Edward went into the\ncottage again for some milk and some cake, while Humphrey put the pony\ninto the cart.\n\nIn a few moments they were off again, and soon arrived at the pit-fall,\nwhere they found the lad still lying where Humphrey had left him.  They\nsoaked the cake in the milk, and, as soon as it was soft, gave him some;\nafter a time he swallowed pretty freely, and was so much recovered as to\nbe able to sit up.  They then lifted him into the cart, and drove gently\nhome to their cottage.\n\n\"What do you think he is, Edward?\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"Some poor beggar lad, who has been crossing the forest.\"\n\n\"No, not exactly; he appears to me to be one of the Zingaros or gipsies,\nas they call them: he is very dark, and has black eyes and white teeth,\njust like those I saw once near Arnwood, when I was out with Jacob.\nJacob said that no one knew where they came from, but that they were all\nover the country, and that they were great thieves, and told fortunes,\nand played all manner of tricks.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may be so; I do not think that he can speak English.\"\n\n\"I am most thankful to Heaven that I chanced this morning to visit the\npit-fall.  Only suppose that I had found the poor boy starved and dead!\nI should have been very unhappy, and never should have had any pleasure\nin looking at the cows, as they would always have reminded me of such a\nmelancholy accident.\"\n\n\"Very true, Humphrey; but you have been saved that misfortune, and ought\nto be grateful to Heaven that such is the case.  What shall we do with\nhim now we have him?\"\n\n\"Why, if he chooses to remain with us, he will be very useful in the\ncow-yard,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Edward, laughing, \"as he was taken in the pit-fall,\nhe must go into the yard with all he others who were captured in the\nsame way.\"\n\n\"Well, Edward, let us get him all right again first, and then we will\nsee what is to be done with him; perhaps he will refuse to remain with\nus.\"\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the cottage they lifted the lad out of the\ncart, and carried him into Jacob's room, and laid him on the bed, for he\nwas too weak to stand.\n\nAlice and Edith, who were much surprised at the new visitor, and the way\nin which he had been caught, hastened to get some gruel ready for him.\nAs soon as it was ready they gave it to the boy, who then fell back on\nthe bed with exhaustion, and was soon in a sound sleep.  He slept\nsoundly all that night; and the next morning, when he awoke, he appeared\nmuch better, although very hungry.  This last complaint was easy to\nremedy, and then the lad got up and walked into the sitting-room.\n\n\"What's your name?\" said Humphrey to the lad.\n\n\"Pablo,\" replied the lad.\n\n\"Can you speak English?\"\n\n\"Yes, little,\" replied he.\n\n\"How did you happen to fall into the pit?\"\n\n\"Not see hole.\"\n\n\"Are you a gipsy?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gitano--same thing.\"\n\nHumphrey put a great many more questions to the lad, and elicited from\nhim, in his imperfect English, the following particulars.\n\nThat he was in company with several others of his race, going down to\nthe sea-coast on one of their usual migrations, and that they had\npitched their tents not far from the pit-fall.  That during the night he\nhad gone out to set some snares for rabbits, and going back to the\ntents, it being quite dark, he had fallen into the hole.  That he had\nremained there three days and nights, having in vain attempted to get\nout.  His mother was with the party of gipsies to which he belonged; but\nhe had no father.  He did not know where to follow the gang, as they had\nnot said where they were going, farther than to the sea-coast.  That it\nwas no use looking for them; and that he did not care much about leaving\nthem, as he was very unkindly treated.  In reply to the question as to\nwhether he would like to remain with them, and work with them on the\nfarm, he replied that he should like it very much if they would be kind\nto him, and not make him work too hard; that he would cook the dinner,\nand catch them rabbits and birds, and make a great many things.\n\n\"Will you be honest, if we keep you, and not tell lies?\" said Edward.\n\nThe lad thought a little while, and then nodded his head in the\naffirmative.\n\n\"Well, Pablo, we will try you, and if you are a good lad, we will do all\nwe can to make you happy,\" said Edward; \"but if you behave ill, we shall\nbe obliged to turn you out of doors; do you understand?\"\n\n\"Be as good as I can,\" replied Pablo; and here the conversation ended\nfor the present.\n\nPablo was a very short-built lad, of apparently fifteen or sixteen years\nof age, very dark in complexion, but very handsome in features, with\nbeautiful white teeth and large dark eyes; and there was certainly\nsomething in his intelligent countenance which recommended him,\nindependent of his claim to their kindness from his having been left\nthus friendless in consequence of his misadventure.  Humphrey was\nparticularly pleased with and interested about him, as the lad had so\nnearly lost his life through his means.\n\n\"I really think, Edward,\" said Humphrey, as they were standing outside\nof the door of the cottage, \"that the lad may be very useful to us, and\nI sincerely hope that he may prove honest and true.  We must first get\nhim into health and spirits, and then I will see what he can do.\"\n\n\"The fact is, my dear Humphrey, we can do no otherwise: he is separated\nfrom his friends, and does not know where to go.  It would be inhuman,\nas we have been the cause of his misfortune, to turn him away; but\nalthough I feel this, I do not feel much security as to his good\nbehaviour and being very useful.  I have always been told that these\ngipsies were vagrants, who lived by stealing all they could lay their\nhands upon; and, if he has been brought up in that way, I fear that he\nwill not easily be reformed.  However, we can but try, and hope for the\nbest.\"\n\n\"What you say is very just, Edward; at the same time, there is an honest\nlook about this lad, although he is a gipsy, that makes me put a sort of\nconfidence in him.  Admitting that he has been taught to do wrong, do\nyou not think that when told the contrary he may be persuaded to do\nright?\"\n\n\"It is not impossible, certainly,\" replied Edward; \"but, Humphrey, be on\nthe safe side, and do not trust him too far, until you know more of\nhim.\"\n\n\"That I most certainly will not,\" replied Humphrey.  \"When do you\npurpose going over to the keeper's cottage, Edward?\"\n\n\"In a day or two; but I am not exactly in a humour now to be very civil\nto the Roundheads, although the one I have promised to visit is a lady,\nand a very amiable, pretty little girl into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Why, Edward, what has made you feel more opposed to them than usual?\"\n\n\"In the first place, Humphrey, the murder of the king--for it was\nmurder, and nothing better--I cannot get that out of my head; and\nyesterday I obtained what I consider as almost a gift from Heaven; and\nif it is so, it was not given but with the intention that I should make\nuse of it.\"\n\n\"And what was that, Edward?\"\n\n\"Our gallant father's sword, which he drew so nobly and so well in\ndefence of his sovereign, Humphrey, and which I trust his son may one\nday wield with equal distinction, and, it may be, better fortune.  Come\nin with me, and I will show it to you.\"\n\nEdward and Humphrey went into the bedroom, and Edward brought out the\nsword, which he had placed by his side on the bed.\n\n\"See, Humphrey, this was our father's sword; and,\" continued Edward,\nkissing the weapon, \"I trust I may be permitted to draw it to revenge\nhis death, and the death of one whose life ever should have been\nsacred.\"\n\n\"I trust that you will, my dear brother,\" replied Humphrey; \"you will\nhave a strong arm and a good cause.  Heaven grant that both may prosper!\nBut tell me how you came by it.\"\n\nEdward then related all that had passed during his visit with Oswald to\nLymington, not forgetting to tell him of Benjamin's appearance, and the\narrangements he had made relative to the sale of the venison.\n\nAs soon as dinner was over, Edward and Humphrey took down their guns,\nhaving agreed that they would go and hunt the wild cattle.\n\n\"Humphrey, have you any idea where the herd of cattle are feeding at\nthis time?\"\n\n\"I know where they were feeding yesterday and the day before, and I do\nnot think that they will have changed their ground; for the grass is yet\nvery young, and only grown on the southern aspects.  Depend upon it we\nshall fall in with them not four miles from where we now are, if not\nnearer.\"\n\n\"We must stalk them as we do the deer, must we not?  They won't allow us\nto approach within shot, Humphrey, will they?\" said Edward.\n\n\"We have to take our chance, Edward; they will allow us to advance\nwithin shot, but the bulls will then advance upon us, while the herd\nincrease their distance.  On the other hand, if we stalk them, we may\nkill one, and then the report of the gun will frighten the others away.\nIn the first instance there is a risk; in the second there is none, but\nthere is more fatigue and trouble.  Choose as you please, I will act as\nyou decide.\"\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, since you give me the choice, I think that this time I\nshall take the bull by the horns, as the saying is; that is, if there\nare any trees near us, for if the herd are in an open place I would not\nrun such a risk; but if we can fire upon them and fall back upon a tree\nin case of a bull charging, I will take them openly.\"\n\n\"With all my heart, Edward: I think it will be very hard, if, with our\ntwo guns and Smoker to back us, we do not manage to be masters of the\nfield.  However, we must survey well before we make our approach; and if\nwe can get within shot without alarming or irritating them, we of course\nwill do so.\"\n\n\"The bulls are very savage at this spring-time,\" observed Edward.\n\n\"They are so at all times, as far as I can see of them,\" replied\nHumphrey; \"but we are near to them now, I should think--yes, there is\nthe herd.\"\n\n\"There they are, sure enough,\" replied Edward: \"now we have not to do\nwith deer, and need not be so very cautious; but still the animals are\nwary, and keep a sharp look-out.  We must approach them quietly, by\nslipping from tree to tree.  Smoker, to heel!--down--quiet, Smoker--good\ndog!\"\n\nEdward and Humphrey stopped to load their guns, and then approached the\nherd in the manner which had been proposed, and were very soon within\ntwo hundred yards of the cattle, behind a large oak, when they stopped\nto reconnoitre.  The herd contained about seventy head of cattle, of\nvarious sizes and ages.  They were feeding in all directions, scattered,\nas the young grass was very short; but although the herd was spread over\nmany acres of land, Edward pointed out to Humphrey that all the\nfull-grown large bulls were on the outside, as if ready to defend the\nothers in case of attack.\n\n\"Humphrey,\" said Edward, \"one thing is clear--as the herd is placed at\npresent, we must have a bull or nothing.  It is impossible to get within\nshot of the others without passing a bull, and depend upon it our\npassage will be disputed; and moreover, the herd will take to flight,\nand we shall get nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Humphrey, \"beef is beef; and, as they say, beggars must\nnot be choosers, so let it be a bull, if it must be so.\"\n\n\"Let us get nearer to them, and then we will decide what we shall do.\nSteady, Smoker!\"\n\nThey advanced gradually, hiding from tree to tree, until they were\nwithin eighty yards of one of the bulls.  The animal did not perceive\nthem, and as they were now within range, they again stepped behind the\ntree to consult.\n\n\"Now, Edward, I think that it would be best to separate.  You can fire\nfrom where we are, and I will crawl through the fern, and get behind\nanother tree.\"\n\n\"Very well, do so,\" replied Edward: \"if you can manage, get to that tree\nwith the low branches, and then perhaps you will be within shot of the\nwhite bull, which is coming down in this direction.  Smoker, lie down!\nHe cannot go with you, Humphrey; it will not be safe.\"\n\nThe distance of the tree which Humphrey ventured to get to was about one\nhundred and fifty yards from where Edward was standing.  Humphrey\ncrawled along for some time in the fern, but at last he came to a bare\nspot of about ten yards wide, which they were not aware of, and where he\ncould not be concealed.  Humphrey hesitated, and at last decided upon\nattempting to cross it.  Edward, who was one moment watching the motions\nof Humphrey, and at another that of the two animals nearest to them,\nperceived that the white bull farthest from him, but nearest to\nHumphrey, threw its head in the air, pawed with his foot, and then\nadvanced with a roar to where Humphrey was on the ground, still crawling\ntowards the tree, having passed the open spot, and being now not many\nyards from the tree.  Perceiving the danger that his brother was in, and\nthat, moreover, Humphrey himself was not aware of it, he hardly knew how\nto act.  The bull was too far from him to fire at it with any chance of\nsuccess; and how to let Humphrey know that the animal had discovered him\nand was making towards him, without calling out, he did not know.  All\nthis was the thought of a moment, and then Edward determined to fire at\nthe bull nearest to him, which he had promised not to do till Humphrey\nwas also ready to fire; and after firing to call Humphrey.  He,\ntherefore, for one moment, turned away from his brother, and, taking aim\nat the bull, fired his gun; but probably from his nerves being a little\nshaken at the idea of Humphrey being in danger, the wound was not\nmortal, and the bull galloped back to the herd, which formed a closed\nphalanx about a quarter of a mile distant.  Edward then turned to where\nhis brother was, and perceived that the bull had not made off with the\nrest of the cattle, but was within thirty yards of Humphrey, and\nadvancing upon him, and that Humphrey was standing up beside the tree\nwith his gun ready to fire.  Humphrey fired, and, as it appeared, he\nalso missed his aim; the animal made at him; but Humphrey, with great\nquickness, dropped his gun, and, swinging by the lower boughs, was into\nthe tree, and out of the bull's reach, in a moment.  Edward smiled when\nhe perceived that Humphrey was safe; but still he was a prisoner, for\nthe bull went round and round the tree roaring and looking up at\nHumphrey.  Edward thought a minute, then loaded his gun and ordered\nSmoker to run in to the bull.  The dog, who had only been restrained by\nEdward's keeping him down at his feet, sprang forward to the attack.\nEdward had intended, by calling to the dog, to induce the bull to follow\nit till within gunshot; but before the bull had been attacked, Edward\nobserved that one or two more of the bulls had left the herd, and were\ncoming at a rapid pace towards him.  Under these circumstances, Edward\nperceived that his only chance was to climb into a tree himself, which\nhe did, taking good care to take his gun and ammunition with him.\nHaving safely fixed himself in a forked bough, Edward then surveyed the\nposition of the parties.  There was Humphrey in the tree, without his\ngun.  The bull who had pursued Humphrey was now running at Smoker, who\nappeared to be aware that he was to decoy the bull towards Edward, for\nhe kept retreating towards him.  In the meantime the two other bulls\nwere quite close at hand, mingling their bellowing and roaring with the\nfirst; and one of them as near to Edward as the first bull, which was\nengaged with Smoker.  At last one of the advancing bulls stood still,\npawing the ground as if disappointed at not finding an enemy, not forty\nyards from where Edward was perched.  Edward took good aim, and when he\nfired the bull fell dead.  Edward was reloading his piece when he heard\na howl, and looking round saw Smoker flying up in the air, having been\ntossed by the first bull; and at the same time he observed that Humphrey\nhad descended from the tree, recovered his gun, and was now safe again\nupon the lower bough.  The first bull was advancing again to attack\nSmoker, who appeared incapable of getting away, so much was he injured\nby the fall, when the other bull, who apparently must have been an old\nantagonist of the first, roared and attacked him; and now the two boys\nwere up in the tree, the two bulls fighting between them, and Smoker\nlying on the ground, panting and exhausted.  As the bulls, with locked\nhorns, were furiously pressing each other, both guns were discharged,\nand both animals fell.  After waiting a little while to see if they rose\nagain, or if any more of the herd came up, Edward and Humphrey descended\nfrom the trees and heartily shook hands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\n\"A narrow escape,\" said Edward, as he held his brother's hand.\n\n\"Yes, indeed we may thank Heaven for our preservation,\" replied\nHumphrey; \"and poor Smoker!  Let us see if he is much hurt.\"\n\n\"I trust not,\" said Edward, going up to the dog, who remained quite\nstill on the ground, with his tongue out, and panting violently.\n\nThey examined poor Smoker all over very carefully, and found that there\nwas no external wound; but on Edward pressing his side the animal gave a\nlow howl.\n\n\"It is there where the horn of the bull took him,\" observed Humphrey.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edward, pressing and feeling softly; \"and he has two of his\nribs broken.  Humphrey, see if you can get him a little water, that will\nrecover him more than anything else; the bull has knocked the breath out\nof his body.  I think he will soon be well again, poor fellow.\"\n\nHumphrey soon returned with some water from a neighbouring pool.  He\nbrought it in his hat and gave it to the dog, who lapped it slowly at\nfirst, but afterwards much faster, and wagging his tail.\n\n\"He will do now,\" said Edward; \"we must give him time to recover\nhimself.  Now then, let us examine our quarry.  Why, Humphrey, what a\nquantity of meat we have here!  It will take three journeys to Lymington\nat least.\"\n\n\"Yes, and no time to lose, for the weather is getting warm already,\nEdward.  Now what to do?  Will you remain while I go home for the cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's no use both going; I will stay here and watch poor Smoker,\nand take off the skins ready by the time you are back again.  Leave me\nyour knife as well as my own, for one will soon be blunt.\"\n\nHumphrey gave his knife to Edward, and taking up his gun, set off for\nthe cottage.  Edward had skinned two of the bulls before Humphrey's\nreturn; and Smoker, although he evidently was in great pain, was on his\nlegs again.  As soon as they had finished and quartered the beasts, the\ncart was loaded, and they returned home; they had to return a second\ntime, and both the pony and they were very tired before they sat down to\nsupper.  They found the gipsy boy very much recovered, and in good\nspirits.  Alice said that he had been amusing Edith and her by tossing\nup three potatoes at a time, and playing them like balls; and that he\nhad spun a platter upon an iron skewer and balanced it on his chin.\nThey gave him some supper, which he ate in the chimney-corner, looking\nup and staring every now and then at Edith, to whom he appeared very\nmuch attached already.\n\n\"Is it good?\" said Humphrey to the boy, giving him another\nvenison-steak.\n\n\"Yes; not have so good supper in pit-hole,\" replied Pablo, laughing.\n\nEarly on the following morning Edward and Humphrey set off to Lymington\nwith the cart laden with meat.  Edward showed Humphrey all the shops and\nthe streets they were in where the purchases were to be made--introduced\nhim to the landlord of the hostelrie--and having sold their meat, they\nreturned home.  The rest of the meat was taken to Lymington and disposed\nof by Humphrey on the following day; and the day after that, the three\nskins were carried to the town and disposed of.\n\n\"We made a good day's work, Edward,\" said Humphrey, as he reckoned up\nthe money they had made.\n\n\"We earned it with some risk, at all events,\" replied Edward; \"and now,\nHumphrey, I think it is time that I keep my promise to Oswald, and go\nover to the Intendant's house and pay my visit to the young lady, as I\npresume she is--and certainly she has every appearance of being one.  I\nwant the visit to be over, as I want to be doing.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Edward?\"\n\n\"I mean that I want to go out and kill some deer; but I will not do it\ntill after I have seen her: when my visit is over, I intend to defy the\nIntendant and all his verderers.\"\n\n\"But why should this visit prevent you going out this very day, if so\ninclined?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but she may ask me if I have done so, and I do not want\nto tell her that I have; neither do I want to say that I have not if I\nhave; and therefore I shall not commence till after I have seen her.\"\n\n\"When will you set off?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning; and I shall take my gun, although Oswald desired me\nnot; but after the fight we had with the wild cattle the other day I\ndon't think it prudent to be unarmed; indeed, I do not feel comfortable\nwithout I have my gun, at any time.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall have plenty to do when you are away--the potatoes must be\nhoed up, and I shall see what I can make of Master Pablo.  He appears\nwell enough, and he has played quite long enough; so I shall take him\nwith me to the garden to-morrow, and set him to work.  What a quantity\nof fruit there is a promise of in the orchard this year!  And Edward, if\nthis boy turns out of any use, and is a help to me, I think that I shall\ntake all the orchard into garden, and then enclose another piece of\nground, and see if we cannot grow some corn for ourselves.  It is the\ngreatest expense that we have at present, and I should like to take my\nown corn to the mill to be ground.\"\n\n\"But will not growing corn require plough and horses?\" said Edward.\n\n\"No; we will till it by hand: two of us can dig a great deal at odd\ntimes, and we shall have a better crop with the spade than with the\nplough.  We have now so much manure that we can afford it.\"\n\n\"Well, if it is to be done, it should be done at once, Humphrey, before\nthe people from the other side of the forest come and find us out, or\nthey will dispute our right to the enclosure.\"\n\n\"The forest belongs to the king, brother, and not to the Parliament: and\nwe are the king's liegemen, and only look to him for permission,\"\nreplied Humphrey; \"but what you say is true, the sooner it is done the\nbetter, and I will about it at once.\"\n\n\"How much do you propose fencing in?\"\n\n\"About two or three acres.\"\n\n\"But that is more than you can dig this year or the next.\"\n\n\"I know that; but I will manure it without digging, and the grass will\ngrow so rich to what it will outside of the enclosure, that they will\nsuppose it has been enclosed a long while.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea, Humphrey: but I advise you to look well after\nthat boy, for he is of a bad race, and has not been brought up, I am\nafraid, with too strict notions of honesty.  Be careful, and tell your\nsisters also to be cautious not to let him suppose that we have any\nmoney in the old chest, till we find out whether he is to be trusted or\nnot.\"\n\n\"Better not let him know it under any circumstances,\" replied Humphrey;\n\"he may continue honest, if not tempted by the knowledge that there is\nanything worth stealing.\"\n\n\"You are right, Humphrey; well, I will be off to-morrow morning and get\nthis visit over.  I hope to be able to get all the news from her, now\nthat her father is away.\"\n\n\"I hope to get some work out of this Master Pablo,\" replied Humphrey;\n\"how many things I could do if he would only work!  Now, I'll tell you\none thing--I will dig a saw-pit and get a saw, and then I can cut out\nboards, and build anything we want.  The first time I go to Lymington I\nwill buy a saw--I can afford it now; and I'll make a carpenter's bench\nfor the first thing, and then, with some more tools, I shall get on; and\nthen, Edward, I'll tell you what else I will do.\"\n\n\"Then, Humphrey,\" replied Edward, laughing, \"you must tell me some other\ntime, for it is now very late, and I must go to bed, as I have to rise\nearly.  I know you have so many projects in your mind that it would take\nhalf the night to listen to them.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe what you say is true,\" replied Humphrey, \"and it will\nbe better to do one thing at a time than to talk about doing a hundred;\nso we will, as you say, to bed.\"\n\nAt sunrise Edward and Humphrey were both up; Alice came out when they\ntapped at her door, as she would not let Edward go without his\nbreakfast.  Edith joined them, and they went to prayers.  While they\nwere so employed, Pablo came out and listened to what was said.  When\nprayers were over, Humphrey asked Pablo if he knew what they had been\ndoing.\n\n\"No, not much; suppose you pray sun to shine.\"\n\n\"No, Pablo,\" said Edith, \"pray to God to make us good.\"\n\n\"You bad then?\" said Pablo; \"me not bad.\"\n\n\"Yes, Pablo, everybody very bad,\" said Alice; \"but if we try to be good,\nGod forgives us.\"\n\nThe conversation was then dropped, and as soon as Edward had had his\nbreakfast, he kissed his sisters, bidding them and Humphrey farewell: he\nthen threw his gun over his arm, and calling his puppy, which he had\nnamed Holdfast, set off on his journey across the forest.\n\nHoldfast, as well as Humphrey's puppy, which had been named Watch, had\ngrown very fine young animals.  The first had been named Holdfast,\nbecause it would seize the pigs by the ears and lead them into the sty,\nand the other because it was so alert at the least noise: but, as\nHumphrey said, Watch ought to have learnt to lead the pigs, it being\nmore in his line of business than Holdfast's, which was to be brought up\nfor hunting in the forest, while Watch was being educated as a house and\nfarm-yard dog.\n\nEdward had refused to take the pony, as Humphrey required it for the\nfarm-work, and the weather was so fine that he preferred walking; the\nmore so, as it would enable him on his return across the forest to try\nfor some venison, which he could not have done if he had been mounted on\nBilly's back.  Edward walked quick, followed by his dog, which he had\ntaught to keep to heel.  He felt happy, as people do who have no cares,\nfrom the fine weather--the deep green of the verdure chequered by the\nflowers in bloom, and the majestic scenery which met his eye on every\nside.  His heart was as buoyant as his steps, as he walked along, the\nlight summer breeze fanning his face.  His thoughts, however, which had\nbeen more of the chase than anything else, suddenly changed, and he\nbecame serious.  For some time he had heard no political news of\nconsequence, or what the Commons were doing with the king.  This reverie\nnaturally brought to his mind his father's death, the burning of his\nproperty, and its sequestration.  His cheeks coloured with indignation,\nand his brow was moody.  Then he built castles for the future.  He\nimagined the king released from his prison, and leading an army against\nhis oppressors; he fancied himself at the head of a troop of cavalry,\ncharging the parliamentary horse.  Victory was on his side.  The king\nwas again on his throne, and he was again in possession of the family\nestate.  He was rebuilding the hall, and somehow or another it appeared\nto him that Patience was standing by his side, as he gave directions to\nthe artificers--when his reverie was suddenly disturbed by Holdfast\nbarking and springing forward in advance.\n\nEdward, who had by this time got over more than half his journey, looked\nup, and perceived himself confronted by a powerful man, apparently about\nforty years of age, and dressed as a verderer of the forest.  He thought\nat the time that he had seldom seen a person with a more sinister and\nforbidding countenance.\n\n\"How now, young fellow, what are you doing here?\" said the man, walking\nup to him, and cocking the gun which he held in his hand as he advanced.\n\nEdward quietly cocked his own gun, which was loaded, when he perceived\nthat hostile preparation on the part of the other person, and then\nreplied, \"I am walking across the forest, as you may perceive.\"\n\n\"Yes, I perceive you are walking, and you are walking with a dog and a\ngun: you will now be pleased to walk with me.  Deer-stealers are not any\nlonger permitted to range this forest.\"\n\n\"I am no deer-stealer,\" replied Edward.  \"It will be quite sufficient to\ngive me that title when you find me with venison in my possession; and\nas for going with you, that I certainly shall not.  Sheer off or you may\nmeet with harm.\"\n\n\"Why, you young good-for-nothing, if you have not venison, it is not\nfrom any will not to take it; you are out in pursuit of it, that is\nclear.  Come, come, you've the wrong person to deal with: my orders are\nto take up all poachers, and take you I will.\"\n\n\"If you can,\" replied Edward; \"but you must first prove that you are\nable so to do; my gun is as good and my aim is as sure as yours, whoever\nyou may be.  I tell you again, I am no poacher, nor have I come out to\ntake the deer, but to cross over to the Intendant's cottage, whither I\nam now going.  I tell you thus much, that you may not do anything\nfoolish; and having said this, I advise you to think twice before you\nact once.  Let me proceed in peace, or you may lose your place, if you\ndo not by your own rashness lose your life.\"\n\nThere was something so cool and so determined in Edward's quiet manner,\nthat the verderer hesitated.  He perceived that any attempt to take\nEdward would be at the risk of his own life; and he knew that his orders\nwere to apprehend all poachers, but not to shoot people.  It was true\nthat resistance with firearms would warrant his acting in self-defence;\nbut admitting that he should succeed, which was doubtful, still Edward\nhad not been caught in the act of killing venison, and he had no\nwitnesses to prove what had occurred.  He also knew that the Intendant\nhad given very strict orders as to the shedding of blood, which he was\nmost averse to under any circumstances; and there was something in\nEdward's appearance and manner so different from a common person, that\nhe was puzzled.  Moreover, Edward had stated that he was going to the\nIntendant's house.  All things considered, as he found that bullying\nwould not succeed, he thought it advisable to change his tone, and\ntherefore said, \"You tell me that you are going to the Intendant's\nhouse; you have business there, I presume?  If I took you prisoner, it\nis there I should have conducted you; so, young man, you may now walk on\nbefore me.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" replied Edward, \"but walk on before you I will not: but\nif you choose to half-cock your gun again, and walk by my side, I will\ndo the same.  Those are my terms, and I will listen to no other; so be\npleased to make up your mind, as I am in haste.\"\n\nThe verderer appeared very indignant at this reply, but after a time\nsaid, \"Be it so.\"\n\nEdward then uncocked his gun, with his eyes fixed upon the man, and the\nverderer did the same; and then they walked side by side, Edward keeping\nat the distance of three yards from him, in case of treachery.\n\nAfter a few moments' silence, the verderer said, \"You tell me you are\ngoing to the Intendant's house; he is not at home.\"\n\n\"But young Mistress Patience is, I presume,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man, who, finding that Edward appeared to know so\nmuch about the Intendant's family, began to be more civil.  \"Yes, she is\nat home, for I saw her in the garden this morning.\"\n\n\"And Oswald, is he at home?\" rejoined Edward.\n\n\"Yes, he is.  You appear to know our people, young man; who may you be,\nif it is a fair question?\"\n\n\"It would have been a fair question had you treated me fairly,\" replied\nEdward; \"but as it is no concern of yours, I shall leave you to find it\nout.\"\n\nThis reply puzzled the man still more; and he now, from the tone of\nauthority assumed by Edward, began to imagine that he had made some\nmistake, and that he was speaking to a superior, although clad in a\nforester's dress.  He therefore answered humbly, observing that he had\nonly been doing his duty.\n\nEdward walked on without making any reply.\n\nAs they arrived within a hundred yards of the Intendant's house, Edward\nsaid:\n\n\"I have now arrived at my destination, and am going into that house, as\nI told you.  Do you choose to enter it with me, or will you go to Oswald\nPartridge and tell him that you have met with Edward Armitage in me\nforest, and that I should be glad to see him?  I believe you are under\nhis orders, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" replied the verderer, \"and as I suppose that all's right, I\nshall go and deliver your message.\"\n\nEdward then turned away from the man, and went into the wicket-gate of\nthe garden, and knocked at the door of the house.  The door was opened\nby Patience Heatherstone herself, who said, \"Oh, how glad I am to see\nyou!  Come in.\"  Edward took off his hat and bowed; Patience led the way\ninto her father's study, where Edward had been first received.\n\n\"And now,\" said Patience, extending her hand to Edward, \"thanks, many\nthanks, for your preserving me from so dreadful a death.  You don't know\nhow unhappy I have been at not being able to give you my poor thanks for\nyour courageous behaviour.\"\n\nHer hand still remained in Edward's while she said this.\n\n\"You rate what I did too highly,\" replied Edward; \"I would have done the\nsame for any one in such distress: it was my duty as a--man,\" cavalier\nhe was about to say, but he checked himself.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Patience, taking a chair,--\"nay, no ceremony; I cannot\ntreat as an inferior one to whom I owe such a debt of gratitude.\"\n\nEdward smiled as he took his seat.\n\n\"My father is as grateful to you as I am--I'm sure that he is; for I\nheard him when at prayer call down blessings on your head.  What can he\ndo for you?  I begged Oswald Partridge to bring you here, that I might\nfind out.  Oh, sir, do pray let me know how we can show our gratitude by\nsomething more than words.\"\n\n\"You have shown it already, Mistress Patience,\" replied Edward; \"have\nyou not honoured a poor forester with your hand in friendship, and even\nadmitted him to sit down before you?\"\n\n\"He who has preserved my life at the risk of his own becomes to me as a\nbrother--at least I feel as a sister towards him: a debt is still a\ndebt, whether indebted to a king or to a--\"\n\n\"Forester, Mistress Patience, that is the real word that you should not\nhave hesitated to have used: do you imagine that I am ashamed of my\ncalling?\"\n\n\"To tell you candidly the truth, then,\" replied Patience, \"I cannot\nbelieve that you are what you profess to be.  I mean to say, that\nalthough a forester now, you were never brought up as such.  My father\nhas an opinion allied to mine.\"\n\n\"I thank you both for your good opinion of me, but I fear that I cannot\nraise myself above the condition of a forester; nay, from your father's\ncoming down here, and the new regulations, I have every chance of\nsinking down to the lower grade of a deer-stealer and poacher; indeed,\nhad it not been that I had my gun with me, I should have been seized as\nsuch this very day as I came over.\"\n\n\"But you were not shooting the deer, were you, sir?\" inquired Patience.\n\n\"No, I was not; nor have I killed any since last I saw you.\"\n\n\"I am glad that I can say that to my father,\" replied Patience; \"it will\nmuch please him.  He said to me that he thought you capable of much\nhigher employment than any that could be offered here, and only wished\nto know what you would accept.  He has interest--great interest--\nalthough just now at variance with the rulers of this country, on\naccount of the--\"\n\n\"Murder of the king, you would or you should have said, Mistress\nPatience: I have heard how much he was opposed to that foul deed, and I\nhonour him for it.\"\n\n\"How kind, how truly kind you are to say so!\" said Patience, the tears\nstarting in her eyes; \"what pleasure to hear my father's conduct praised\nby you!\"\n\n\"Why, of course, Mistress Patience, all of my way of thinking must\npraise him.  Your father is in London, I hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is; and that reminds me that you must want some refreshment\nafter your walk.  I will call Phoebe.\"  So saying, Patience left the\nroom.\n\nThe fact was, Mistress Patience was reminded that she had been sitting\nwith a young man some time, and alone with him--which was not quite\nproper in those times, and when Phoebe appeared with the cold viands,\nshe retreated out of hearing, but remained in the room.\n\nEdward partook of the meal offered him in silence, Patience occupying\nherself with her work, and keeping her eyes fixed on it, unless when she\ngave a slight glance at the table to see if anything was required.  When\nthe meal was over, Phoebe removed the tray, and then Edward rose to take\nhis leave.\n\n\"Nay, do not go yet--I have much to say first; let me again ask you how\nwe can serve you.\"\n\n\"I never can take any office under the present rulers of the nation; so\nthat question is at rest.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you would answer so,\" replied Patience gravely: \"do not\nthink I blame you; for many are there already who would gladly retrace\ntheir steps if it were possible.  They little thought, when they opposed\nthe king, that affairs would have ended as they have done.  Where do you\nlive, sir?\"\n\n\"At the opposite side of the forest, in a house belonging to me now, but\nwhich was inherited by my grandfather.\"\n\n\"Do you live alone--surely not?\"\n\n\"No, I do not.\"\n\n\"Nay, you may tell me anything, for I would never repeat what might hurt\nyou, or you might not wish to have known.\"\n\n\"I live with my brother and two sisters, for my grandfather is lately\ndead.\"\n\n\"Is your brother younger than you are?\"\n\n\"He is.\"\n\n\"And your sisters, what are their ages?\"\n\n\"They are younger still.\"\n\n\"You told my father that you lived upon your farm?\"\n\n\"We do.\"\n\n\"Is it a large farm?\"\n\n\"No; very small.\"\n\n\"And does that support you?\"\n\n\"That and killing wild cattle has lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, and killing deer also until lately?\"\n\n\"You have guessed right.\"\n\n\"You were brought up at Arnwood, you told my father; did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was brought up there, and remained there until the death of\nColonel Beverley.\"\n\n\"And you were educated, were you not?\"\n\n\"Yes; the chaplain taught me what little I do know.\"\n\n\"Then, if you were brought up in the house and educated by the chaplain,\nsurely Colonel Beverley never intended you for a forester?\"\n\n\"He did not; I was to have been a soldier as soon as I was old enough to\nbear arms.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are distantly related to the late Colonel Beverley?\"\n\n\"No; I am not _distantly_ related,\" replied Edward, who began to feel\nuneasy at this close cross-examination; \"but still, had Colonel Beverley\nbeen alive, and the king still required his services, I have no doubt\nthat I should have been serving under him at this time.  And now,\nMistress Patience, that I have answered so many questions of yours, may\nI be permitted to ask a little about yourself in return?  Have you any\nbrothers?\"\n\n\"None; I am an only child.\"\n\n\"Have you only one parent alive?\"\n\n\"Only one.\"\n\n\"What families are you connected with?\"\n\nPatience looked up with surprise at this last question--\n\n\"My mother's name was Cooper; she was sister to Sir Anthony Ashley\nCooper, who is a person well-known.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  Then you are of gentle blood?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" replied Patience, with surprise.\n\n\"Thank you for your condescension, Mistress Patience; and now, if you\nwill permit me, I will take my leave.\"\n\n\"Before you go, let me once more thank you for saving a worthless life,\"\nsaid Patience: \"well, you must come again when my father is here; he\nwill be but too glad to have an opportunity of thanking one who has\npreserved his only child.  Indeed, if you knew my father, you would feel\nas much regard for him as I do.  He is very good, although he looks so\nstern and melancholy; but he has seldom smiled since my poor mother's\ndeath.\"\n\n\"As to your father, Mistress Patience, I will think as well as I can of\none who is joined to a party which I hold in detestation: I can say no\nmore.\"\n\n\"I must not say all that I know, or you would perhaps find out that he\nis not quite so wedded to that party as you suppose.  Neither his\nbrother-in-law nor he are great friends of Cromwell's, I can assure you;\nbut this in confidence.\"\n\n\"That raises him in my estimation; but why then does he hold office?\"\n\n\"He did not ask it; it was given to him, I really believe, because they\nwished him out of the way; and he accepted it because he was opposed to\nwhat was going on, and wished himself to be away.  At least I infer so\nmuch from what I have learnt.  It is not an office of power or trust\nwhich leagues him with the present Government.\"\n\n\"No; only one which opposes him to me and my mal-practices,\" replied\nEdward, laughing.  \"Well, Mistress Patience, you have shown great\ncondescension to a poor forester, and I return you many thanks for your\nkindness towards me: I will now take my leave.\"\n\n\"And when will you come and see my father?\"\n\n\"I cannot say; I fear that I shall not be able very soon to look in his\ninjured face, and it will not be well for a poacher to come near him,\"\nreplied Edward: \"however, some day I may be taken and brought before you\nas a prisoner, you know, and then he is certain to see me.\"\n\n\"I will not tell you to kill deer,\" replied Patience; \"but if you do\nkill them, no one shall harm you--or I know little of my power or my\nfather's.  Farewell then, sir; and once more, gratitude and thanks.\"\n\nPatience held out her hand again to Edward, who this time, like a true\ncavalier, raised it respectfully to his lips.  Patience coloured a\nlittle, but did not attempt to withdraw it, and Edward, with a low\nobeisance, quitted the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nAs soon as he was out of the Intendant's house, Edward hastened to the\ncottage of Oswald Partridge, whom he found waiting for him; for the\nverderer had not failed to deliver his message.\n\n\"You have had a long talk with Mistress Patience,\" said Oswald, after\nthe first greeting; \"and I am glad of it, as it gives you consequence\nhere.  The Roundhead rascal whom you met was inclined to be very precise\nabout doing his duty, and insisted that he was certain that you were on\nthe look-out for deer; but I stopped his mouth by telling him that I\noften took you out with me, as you were the best shot in the whole\nforest, and that the Intendant knew that I did so.  I think that if you\nwere caught in the act of killing a deer you had better tell them that\nyou killed it by my request, and I will bear you out, if they bring you\nto the Intendant, who will, I'm sure, thank me for saying so.  You might\nkill all the deer in the forest after what you have done for him.\"\n\n\"Many thanks; but I do not think I can take advantage of your offer.\nLet them catch me if they can, and if they do catch me, let them take me\nif they can.\"\n\n\"I see, sir, that you will accept no favour from the Roundheads,\"\nreplied Oswald; \"however, as I am now head keeper, I shall take care\nthat my men do not interfere with you, if I can help it; all I wish is\nto prevent any insult or indignity being offered to you: they not being\naware who you are, as I am.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, Oswald; I must take my chance.\"\n\nEdward then told Oswald of their having taken the gipsy boy in the pit,\nat which he appeared much amused.\n\n\"What is the name of the verderer whom I met in the forest?\" inquired\nEdward.\n\n\"James Corbould; he was discharged from the army,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"I do not like his appearance,\" said Edward.\n\n\"No; his face tells against him,\" replied Oswald; \"but I know nothing of\nhim; he has been here little more than a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Can you give me a corner to put my head in to-night, Oswald?  For I\nshall not start till to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"You may command all I have, sir,\" replied Oswald; \"but I fear there is\nlittle more than a hearty welcome; I have no doubt that you could be\nlodged at the Intendant's house if you choose.\"\n\n\"No, Oswald, the young lady is alone, and I will not trust to Phoebe's\naccommodation again; I will stay here, if you will permit me.\"\n\n\"And welcome, sir: I will put your puppy in the kennel at once.\"\n\nEdward remained that night at Oswald's, and at daylight he rose, and\nhaving taken a slight breakfast, throwing his gun over his shoulder,\nwent to the kennel for Holdfast, and set off on his return home.\n\n\"That's a very nice little girl,\" were the words which Edward found\nhimself constantly saying to himself as he walked along; \"and she is of\na grateful disposition, or she would not have behaved as she has done\ntowards me--supposing me to be of mean birth;\" and then he thought of\nwhat she had told him relative to her father, and Edward felt his\nanimosity against a Roundhead wasting fast away.  \"I am not likely to\nsee her again very soon,\" thought Edward, \"unless, indeed, I am brought\nto the Intendant as a prisoner.\"  Thus thinking upon one subject or\nanother, Edward had gained above eight miles of his journey across the\nforest, when he thought that he was sufficiently far away to venture to\nlook-out for some venison.  Remembering there was a thicket not far from\nhim, in which there was a clear pool of water, Edward thought it very\nlikely that he might find a stag there cooling himself, for the weather\nwas now very warm at noon-day.  He therefore called Holdfast to him, and\nproceeded cautiously towards the thicket.  As soon as he arrived at the\nspot, he crouched and crept silently through the underwood.  At last he\narrived close to the cleared spot by the pool.  There was no stag there,\nbut fast asleep upon the turf lay James Corbould, the sinister-looking\nverderer who had accosted him in the forest on the previous day.\nHoldfast was about to bark, when Edward silenced him, and then advanced\nto where the verderer was lying; and who having no dog with him to give\nnotice of Edward's approach, still remained snoring with the sun shining\non his face.  Edward perceived that his gun was under him on the grass;\nhe took it up, gently opened the pan and scattered the powder, and then\nlaid it down again; for Edward said to himself, \"That man has come out\nafter me, that I am certain; and as there are no witnesses, he may be\ninclined to be mischievous, for a more wretched-looking person I never\nsaw.  Had he been deer-hunting, he would have brought his dog; but he is\nman-hunting, that is evident.  Now I will leave him, and should he fall\nin with anything, he will not kill at first shot, that's certain; and if\nhe follows me, I shall have the same chance of escape as anything else\nhe may fire at.\"  Edward then walked out of the covert, thinking that if\never there was a face which proclaimed a man to be a murderer it was\nthat of James Corbould.  As he was threading his way, he heard the howl\nof a dog, and on looking round, perceived that Holdfast was not with\nhim.  He turned back, and Holdfast came running to him.  The fact was,\nthat Holdfast had smelt some meat in the pocket of the verderer, and had\nbeen putting his nose in to ascertain what it was: in so doing he had\nwakened up Corbould, who had saluted him with a heavy blow on the head:\nthis occasioned the puppy to give the howl, and also occasioned Corbould\nto seize his gun, and follow stealthily in the track of the dog, which\nhe well knew to be the one he had seen the day before with Edward.\n\nEdward waited for a short time, and not perceiving that Corbould made\nhis appearance, continued on his way home, having now given up all\nthoughts of killing any venison.  He walked fast, and was within six\nmiles of the cottage, when he stopped to drink at a small rill of water,\nand then sat down to rest himself for a short time.  While so doing, he\nfell into one of his usual reveries, and forgot how time passed away.\nHe was, however, aroused by a low growl on the part of Holdfast, and it\nimmediately occurred to him that Corbould must have followed him.\nThinking it as well to be prepared, he quietly loaded his gun, and then\nrose up to reconnoitre.  Holdfast sprang forward, and Edward looking in\nthe direction, perceived Corbould partly hidden behind a tree, with his\ngun levelled at him.  He heard the trigger pulled, and snap of the lock,\nbut the gun did not go off; and then Corbould made his appearance,\nstriking at Holdfast with the butt-end of his gun.  Edward advanced to\nhim and desired him to desist, or it would be the worse for him.\n\n\"Indeed, younker!  It may be the worse for you,\" cried Corbould.\n\n\"It might have been if your gun had gone off,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"I did not aim at you.  I aimed at the dog, and I will kill the brute,\nif I can.\"\n\n\"Not without danger to yourself; but it was not him that you aimed at--\nyour gun was not pointed low enough to hit the dog--it was levelled at\nme, you sneaking wretch; and I have only to thank my own prudence and\nyour sleepy head for having escaped with my life.  I tell you candidly\nthat I threw the powder out of your pan while you were asleep.  If I\nserved you as you deserve, I should now put my bullet into you, but I\ncannot kill a man who is defenceless--and that saves your life; but set\noff as fast as you can away from me, for if you follow me, I will show\nno more forbearance.  Away with you directly,\" continued Edward, raising\nhis gun to his shoulder and pointing it to Corbould; \"if you do not be\noff, I'll fire.\"\n\nCorbould saw that Edward was resolute, and thought proper to comply with\nhis request: he walked away till he considered himself out of gunshot,\nand then commenced a torrent of oaths and abusive language, with which\nwe shall not offend our readers.  Before he went farther, he swore that\nhe would have Edward's life before many days had passed, and then\nshaking his fist he went away.  Edward remained where he was standing\ntill the man was fairly out of sight, and then proceeded on his journey.\nIt was now about four o'clock in the afternoon, and Edward, as he\nwalked on, said to himself, \"That man must be of a very wicked\ndisposition, for I have offended him in nothing except in not submitting\nto be made his prisoner; and is that an offence to take a man's life\nfor?  He is a dangerous man, and will be more dangerous after being\nagain foiled by me as he has been to-day.  I doubt if he will go home; I\nam almost sure that he will turn and follow me when he thinks that he\ncan without my seeing him; and if he does, he will find out where our\ncottage is--and who knows what mischief he may not do, and how he may\nalarm my little sisters?  I'll not go home till dark; and I'll now walk\nin another direction, that I may mislead him.\"  Edward then walked away\nmore to the north, and every half-hour shifted his course, so as to be\nwalking in a very different direction from where the cottage stood.  In\nthe meantime it grew gradually dark; and as it became so, every now and\nthen when Edward passed a large tree he turned round behind it and\nlooked to see if Corbould was following him.  At last, just as it was\ndark, he perceived the figure of a man at no great distance from him,\nwho was following him, running from tree to tree, so as to make his\napproach.  \"Oh, you are there!\" thought Edward, \"now will I give you a\nnice dance, and we will see whose legs are tired soonest.  Let me see,\nwhere am I?\"  Edward looked round, and then perceived that he was close\nto the clump of trees where Humphrey had made his pit-fall for the\ncattle, and there was a clear spot of about a quarter of a mile between\nit and where he now stood.  Edward made up his mind, and immediately\nwalked out to cross the clearing, calling Holdfast to heel.  It was now\nnearly dark, for there was only the light of the stars; but still there\nwas sufficient light to see his way.  As Edward crossed the cleared\nspot, he once looked round and perceived that Corbould was following\nhim, and nearer than he was before, trusting probably to the increased\ndarkness to hide his approach.  \"That will do,\" thought Edward, \"come\nalong, my fine fellow.\"  And Edward walked on till he came to the\npit-fall; there he stopped and looked round, and soon discovered the\nverderer at a hundred yards' distance.  Edward held his dog by the\nmouth, that he should not growl or bark, and then went on in a direction\nso as to bring the pit-fall exactly between Corbould and himself.\nHaving done so, he proceeded at a more rapid pace; and Corbould\nfollowing him, also increased his, till he arrived at the pit-fall,\nwhich he could not perceive, and fell into it headlong; and as he fell\ninto the pit, at the same time Edward heard the discharge of his gun,\nthe crash of the small branches laid over it, and a cry on the part of\nCorbould.  \"That will do,\" thought Edward, \"now you may lie there as\nlong as the gipsy did, and that will cool your courage.  Humphrey's\npit-fall is full of adventure.  In this case it has done me a service.\nNow I may turn and go home as fast as I can.  Come, Holdfast, old boy,\nwe both want our suppers.  I can answer for one, for I could eat the\nwhole of that pasty which Oswald set before me this morning.\"  Edward\nwalked at a rapid pace, quite delighted at the issue of the adventure.\nAs he arrived near to the cottage he found Humphrey outside, with Pablo,\non the look-out for him.  He soon joined them, and soon after embraced\nAlice and Edith, who had been anxiously waiting for his return, and who\nhad wondered at his being out so late.  \"Give me my supper, my dear\ngirls,\" said Edward; \"and then you shall know all about it.\"\n\nAs soon as Edward had satisfied his craving appetite--for he had not, as\nmy readers must recollect, eaten anything since his departure early in\nthe morning from the house of Oswald Partridge--he entered into a\nnarrative of the events of the day.  They all listened with great\ninterest; and when Edward had finished, Pablo, the gipsy boy, jumped up,\nand said:\n\n\"Now he is in the pit, to-morrow morning I take gun and shoot him.\"\n\n\"No, no, Pablo, you must not do that,\" replied Edward, laughing.\n\n\"Pablo,\" said little Edith, \"go and sit down; you must not shoot\npeople.\"\n\n\"He shoot master then,\" said Pablo; \"he very bad man.\"\n\n\"But if you shoot him, you will be a bad boy, Pablo,\" replied Edith, who\nappeared to have assumed an authority over him.  Pablo did not appear to\nunderstand this, but he obeyed the order of his little mistress, and\nresumed his seat at the chimney-corner.\n\n\"But, Edward,\" said Humphrey, \"what do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"I hardly know; my idea was to let him remain there for a day or two,\nand then send to Oswald to let him know where the fellow was.\"\n\n\"The only objection to that is,\" replied Humphrey, \"that you say his gun\nwent off as he fell into the pit; it may be probable that he is wounded,\nand if so, he might die if he is left there.\"\n\n\"You are right, Humphrey, that is possible; and I would not have the\nlife of a fellow-creature on my conscience.\"\n\n\"I think it would be advisable, Edward, that I should set off early\nto-morrow on the pony, and see Oswald, tell him all that has occurred,\nand show him where the pit-fall is.\"\n\n\"I believe that would be the best plan, Humphrey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"it would be dreadful that a man should die in so\nwicked a state; let him be taken out, and perhaps he will repent.\"\n\n\"Won't God punish him, brother?\" said Edith.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, sooner or later, the vengeance of Heaven overtakes the\nwicked.  But I am very tired after so long a walk; let us go to prayers,\nand then to bed.\"\n\nThe danger that Edward had incurred that day was felt strongly by the\nwhole party; and, with the exception of Pablo, there was earnest\ndevotion and gratitude to Heaven when their orisons were offered up.\n\nHumphrey was off before daybreak, and, at nine o'clock, had arrived at\nthe cottage of Oswald, by whom he was warmly greeted before the cause of\nhis unexpected arrival was made known.  Oswald was greatly annoyed at\nHumphrey's narration, and appeared to be very much of the opinion of\nPablo, which was, to leave the scoundrel where he was; but on the\nremonstrance of Humphrey, he set off, with two of the other verderers,\nand before nightfall Humphrey arrived at the pit-fall, where they heard\nCorbould groaning below.\n\n\"Who's there?\" said Oswald, looking into the pit.\n\n\"It's me--it's Corbould,\" replied the man.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, badly,\" replied Corbould; \"when I fell, my gun went off, and the\nball has gone through my thigh.  I have almost bled to death.\"\n\nHumphrey went for the ladder, which was at hand, and, with much exertion\non the part of the whole four of them, they contrived to drag out\nCorbould, who groaned heavily with pain.  A handkerchief was tied\ntightly round his leg, to prevent any further bleeding, and they gave\nhim some water, which revived him.\n\n\"Now, what's to be done?\" said Oswald; \"we can never get him home.\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Humphrey, walking with him aside.  \"It will not\ndo for any of these men to know our cottage, and we cannot take them\nthere.  Desire them to remain with the man, while you go for a cart to\ncarry him home.  We will go to the cottage, give Billy his supper, and\nthen return with him in the cart, and bring your men something to eat.\nThen I will go with you, and bring the cart back again before daylight.\nIt will be a night's walk, but it will be the safest plan.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" replied Oswald, who desired the men to wait till his\nreturn, as he was going to borrow a cart; and then set off with\nHumphrey.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the cottage, Humphrey gave the pony to Pablo\nto put into the stable and feed, and then communicated to Edward the\nstate of Corbould.\n\n\"It's almost a pity that he had not killed himself out-right,\" observed\nOswald; \"it would have been justice to him for attempting your life\nwithout any cause; he is a bloodthirsty scoundrel, and I wish he was\nanywhere but where he is.  However, the Intendant shall know of it, and\nI have no doubt that he will be discharged.\"\n\n\"Do nothing in a hurry, Oswald,\" replied Edward; \"at present let him\ngive his own version of the affair; for he may prove more dangerous when\ndischarged than when under your control.  Now sit down and take your\nsupper.  Billy must have an hour to get his, and therefore there is no\nhurry for you.\"\n\n\"That is your gipsy lad, Edward, is he not?\" said Oswald.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I like the boy's looks; but they are a queer race.  You must not trust\nhim too much,\" continued Oswald, in an under tone, \"until you have tried\nhim, and are satisfied of his fidelity.  They are very excitable, and\ncapable of strong attachment if well treated, that I know; for I did a\ngipsy a good turn once, and it proved to be the saving of my life\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell us how, Oswald,\" said Alice.\n\n\"It is too long a story now, my dear little lady,\" replied Oswald; \"but\nI will another time.  Whatever he may do, do not strike him; for they\nnever forgive a blow, I am told by those who know them, and it never\ndoes them any good; as I said before, they are a queer race.\"\n\n\"He will not be beaten by us,\" replied Humphrey, \"depend upon it, unless\nEdith slaps him; for she is the one who takes most pains with him, and I\npresume he would not care much about her little hand.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Oswald, laughing, \"Edith may do as she pleases.  What\ndoes he do for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing as yet, for he is hardly recovered, poor fellow,\" replied\nHumphrey.  \"He follows Edith, and helps her to look for the eggs; and\nlast night he set some springes after his own fashion, and certainly\nbeat me, for he took three rabbits and a hare, while I, with all my\ntraps, only took one rabbit.\"\n\n\"I think you had better leave that part of your livelihood entirely to\nhim; he has been bred up to it, Humphrey, and it will be his amusement.\nYou must not expect him to work very hard; they are not accustomed to\nit.  They live a roving life, and never work if they can help it; still,\nif you make him fond of you, he may be very useful, for they are very\nclever and handy.\"\n\n\"I hope to make him useful,\" replied Humphrey, \"but still I will not\nforce him to do what he does not like.  He is very fond of the pony\nalready, and likes to take care of him.\"\n\n\"Bring him over to me, one of these days, so that he may know where to\nfind me.  It may prove of consequence if you have a message to send, and\ncannot come yourselves.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" replied Edward; \"I will not forget it.  Humphrey,\nshall you or I go with the cart?\"\n\n\"Humphrey, by all means; it will not do for them to suppose I had the\ncart from you, Edward; they do not know Humphrey, and he will be off\nagain in the morning before they are up.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"And it is time for us to set off,\" replied Oswald.  \"Will Mistress\nAlice oblige me with something for my men to eat?  For they have fasted\nthe whole day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Alice, \"I will have it ready before the pony is in the\ncart.  Edith, dear, come with me.\"\n\nHumphrey then went out to harness the pony, and when all was ready, he\nand Oswald set off again.\n\nWhen they arrived at the pit-fall they found Corbould lying between the\ntwo other verderers, who were sitting by his side.  Corbould was much\nrecovered since his wound had been bound up, and he was raised up and\nput on the fodder which Humphrey had put into the cart, and they\nproceeded on their journey to the other side of the forest, the\nverderers eating what Humphrey had brought for them as they walked\nalong.  It was a tedious and painful journey for the wounded man, who\nshrieked out when the cart was jolted by the wheel getting into a rut or\nhole; but there was no help for it, and he was very much exhausted when\nthey arrived, which was not till past midnight.  Corbould was then taken\nto his cottage and put on the bed, and another verderer sent for a\nsurgeon: those who had been with Oswald were glad to go to bed, for it\nhad been a fatiguing day.  Humphrey remained with Oswald for three\nhours, and then again returned with Billy, who, although he had crossed\nthe forest three times in the twenty-four hours, appeared quite fresh\nand ready to go back again.\n\n\"I will let you know how he gets on, Humphrey, and what account he gives\nof his falling into the pit; but you must not expect me for a fortnight\nat least.\"\n\nHumphrey wished Oswald good-bye; and Billy was so anxious to get back to\nhis stable that Humphrey could not keep him at a quiet pace.  \"Horses,\nand all animals indeed, know that there is no place like home; it is a\npity that men, who consider themselves much wiser, have not the same\nconsideration,\" thought Humphrey as the pony trotted along.  Humphrey\nthought a good deal about the danger that Edward had been subjected to,\nand said to himself, \"I really think that I should be more comfortable\nif Edward was away.  I am always in a fidget about him.  I wish the new\nking, who is now in France, would raise an army and come over.  It is\nbetter that Edward should be fighting in the field than remain here and\nrisk being shot as a deer-stealer, or put in prison.  The farm is\nsufficient for us all; and when I have taken in more ground it will be\nmore than sufficient, even if I do not kill the wild cattle.  I am fit\nfor the farm, but Edward is not.  He is thrown away, living in this\nobscurity, and he feels it.  He will always be in hot water some way or\nanother, that is certain.  What a narrow escape he has had with that\nscoundrel, and yet how little he cares for it!  He was intended for a\nsoldier, that is evident; and if ever he is one, he will be in his\nelement, and distinguish himself, if it pleases God to spare his life.\nI'll persuade him to stay at home a little while to help me to enclose\nthe other piece of ground; and after that is done, I'll dig a saw-pit,\nand see if I can coax Pablo to saw with me.  I must go to Lymington and\nbuy a saw.  If I once could get the trees sawed up into planks, what a\nquantity of things I could make, and how I could improve the place.\"\n\nThus thought Humphrey as he went along; he was all for the farm and\nimprovements, and was always calculating when he should have another\ncalf or a fresh litter of pigs.  His first idea was, that he would make\nPablo work hard; but the advice he had received from Oswald was not\nforgotten; and he now was thinking how he should coax Pablo into\nstanding below in the saw-pit, which was not only hard work, but\ndisagreeable, from the sawdust falling into the eyes.  Humphrey's\ncogitations were interrupted by a halloo, and turning round in the\ndirection of the voice, he perceived Edward, and turned the cart to join\nhim.\n\n\"You're just come in time, Humphrey; I have some provision for Alice's\nlarder.  I took my gun and came out on the path which I knew you would\nreturn on, and I have killed a young buck.  He is good meat, and we are\nscarce of provisions.\"\n\nHumphrey helped Edward to put the venison in the cart, and they returned\nto the cottage, which was not more than three miles off.  Humphrey told\nEdward the result of his journey, and then proposed that Edward should\nstop at home for a few days and help him with the new enclosure.  To\nthis Edward cheerfully consented; and as soon as they arrived at the\ncottage, and Humphrey had had his breakfast, they took their axes and\nwent out to fell at a cluster of small spruce-firs about a mile off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\n\"Now, Humphrey, what do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"This,\" replied Humphrey: \"I have marked out three acres or thereabouts\nof the land running in a straight line behind the garden.  There is not\na tree on it, and it is all good feeding-ground.  What I intend to do is\nto enclose it with the spruce-fir posts and rails that we are about to\ncut down, and then set a hedge upon a low bank which I shall raise all\nround inside the rails.  I know where there are thousands of seedling\nthorns, which I shall take up in the winter, or early in the spring, to\nput in, as the bank will be ready for them by that time.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all very good; but I fear it will be a long while before\nyou have such a quantity of land dug up.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course it will; but, Edward, I have plenty of manure to spare,\nand I shall put it all over this land, and then it will become a rich\npasture, and also an earlier pasture than what we can get from the\nforest, and will be very handy to turn the cows and the calves upon; or\neven Billy, if we want him in a hurry.\"\n\n\"All that is very true,\" replied Edward, \"so that it will be useful, at\nall events, if you do not dig it up.\"\n\n\"Indeed it will,\" replied Humphrey; \"I only wish it were six acres\ninstead of three.\"\n\n\"I can't say I do,\" replied Edward, laughing; \"you are too grand in your\nideas; only think what a quantity of spruces we shall have to cut down\non it, to post and rail what you just propose.  Let it be three acres\nfirst, Humphrey; and when they are enclosed, you may begin to talk of\nthree more.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you are right, Edward,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"Why, here's Pablo coming after us: he's not coming to work, I presume,\nbut to amuse himself by looking on.\"\n\n\"I don't think he is strong enough to do much hard work, Humphrey,\nalthough he appears very ingenious.\"\n\n\"No, I agree with you; and if he is to work, depend upon it it must not\nbe by having work set out for him; he would take a disgust to it\ndirectly.  I have another plan for him.\"\n\n\"And what is that, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"I shall not set him anything to do, and shall make him believe that I\ndo not think he is able to do anything.  That will pique him, and I\nthink by that means I shall get more work out of him than you would\nthink, especially when, after he has done it, I express my wonder and\ngive him praise.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea, that; you will work upon his pride, which is probably\nstronger than his laziness.\"\n\n\"I do not think him lazy, but I think him unused to hard work, and,\nhaving lived a life of wandering and idleness, not very easy to be\nbrought to constant and daily work, except by degrees, and by the means\nwhich I propose.--Here we are,\" continued Humphrey, throwing his axe and\nbillhook down, and proceeding to take off his doublet: \"now for an hour\nor two's fulfilment of the sentence of our first parents--to wit, `the\nsweat of the brow.'\"\n\nEdward followed Humphrey's example in taking off his doublet; they\nselected the long thin trees most fitted for rails, and were hard at\nwork when Pablo came up to them.  More than a dozen trees had fallen,\nand lay one upon the other, before they stopped a while to recover\nthemselves a little.\n\n\"Well, Pablo,\" said Humphrey, wiping his forehead, \"I suppose you think\nlooking on better than cutting down trees; and so it is.\"\n\n\"What cut down trees for?\"\n\n\"To make posts and rails to fence in more ground.  I shall not leave the\nboughs on.\"\n\n\"No, cut them off by and by, and then put poles on the cart and carry\nthem home.\"\n\nEdward and Humphrey then recommenced their labour, and worked for\nanother half-hour, when they paused to recover their wind.\n\n\"Hard work, Pablo,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"Yes, very hard work; Pablo not strong enough.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you are not able to do anything of this kind, I know.  No work\nthis for gipsies; they take birds' nests and catch rabbits.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pablo, nodding; \"and you eat them.\"\n\n\"So he does, Pablo,\" said Edward; \"so you are useful in your way; for if\nhe had nothing to eat he would not be able to work.  Strong man cut down\ntrees, weak man catch rabbits.\"\n\n\"Both good,\" said Pablo.\n\n\"Yes, but strong man like work; not strong man not like work, Pablo.  So\nnow look on again, for we must have another spell.\"\n\n\"Strong man cut down trees, not strong man cut off branches,\" said\nPablo, taking up the billhook and setting to work to cut off the boughs,\nwhich he did with great dexterity and rapidity.\n\nEdward and Humphrey exchanged glances and smiles, and then worked away\nin silence till it was, as they supposed, dinner-time.  They were not\nwrong in their supposition, although they had no other clock than their\nappetites, which, however, tell the time pretty correctly to those who\nwork hard.  Alice had the platters on the table, and was looking out to\nsee if they were coming.\n\n\"Why, Pablo, have you been at work?\" said Edith.\n\n\"Yes, little missy--work all the morning.\"\n\n\"Indeed he has, and has worked very well, and been very useful,\" said\nEdward.\n\n\"It has given you an appetite for your dinner, Pablo, has it not?\" said\nHumphrey.\n\n\"Have that without work,\" replied the boy.\n\n\"Pablo, you are a very good gipsy boy,\" said Edith, patting his head\nwith a patronising air; \"I shall let you walk out with me and carry the\nbasket to put the eggs in when you come home in the evening.\"\n\n\"That is a reward,\" said Humphrey, laughing.\n\nAfter dinner they continued their labour, and by supper-time had so many\ntrees cut down, that they determined to carry home the next day, and lay\nthem along, to see how many more they would want.  While they put the\ntrees in the cart and took them home, Pablo contrived to lop off the\nboughs and prepare the poles for them to take away.  As soon as they had\ncut down sufficient and carted them home, they then selected shorter\ntrees for posts; and when Pablo had cleared them of the boughs, they\nsawed them out the proper lengths, and then carted them home.  This\noccupied nearly the whole week, and then they proceeded to dig holes and\nset the posts in.  The railing was then to be nailed to the posts, and\nthat occupied them three days more; so that it was altogether a\nfortnight of hard work before the three acres were enclosed.\n\n\"There,\" said Humphrey, \"that's a good job over; many thanks, Edward,\nfor your assistance; and thank you too, Pablo, for you really have\nhelped us very much indeed, and are a very useful, good boy.  Now for\nraising the bank--that I must do when I can spare time; but my garden is\noverrun with weeds, and I must get Edith and Alice to help me there.\"\n\n\"If you don't want me any longer, Humphrey,\" said Edward, \"I think I\nshall go over to see Oswald, and take Pablo with me.  I want to know how\nthat fellow Corbould is, and what he says; and whether the Intendant has\ncome back; not that I shall go near him or his good little daughter, but\nI think I may as well go, and it will be a good opportunity of showing\nPablo the way to Oswald's cottage.\"\n\n\"I think so too; and when you come back, Edward, one of us must go to\nLymington; for I require some tools, and Pablo is very ragged.  He must\nhave some better clothes than these old ones of ours if he is to be sent\nmessages.  Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"And I want a thousand things,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Indeed, mistress, won't less than a thousand content you?\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps not quite a thousand, but I really do want a great many,\nand I will make you a list of them.  I have not pans enough for my milk;\nI want salt; I want tubs; but I will make out a list, and you will find\nit a very long one.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope you have something to sell to pay for them?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have plenty of butter salted down.\"\n\n\"What have you, Edith?\"\n\n\"Oh, my chickens are not large enough yet: as soon as they are, Humphrey\nmust get me some ducks and geese, for I mean to keep some; and by and by\nI will have some turkeys; but not yet.  I must wait till Humphrey builds\nme the new house for them he has promised me.\"\n\n\"I think you are right, Edith, about the ducks and geese; they will do\nwell on the water behind the yard, and I will dig you out a bigger pool\nfor them.\"\n\n\"Edith, my dear, your little fingers are just made to weed my onions\nwell, and I wish you would do it to-morrow morning, if you have time.\"\n\n\"_Yes_, Humphrey, but my little fingers won't smell very nice\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Not till you have washed them, I guess; but there is soap and water,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know there is; but if I weed the onions I cannot help Alice to\nmake the butter; however, if Alice can do without me I will do it.\"\n\n\"I want some more seeds sadly,\" said Humphrey, \"and I must make out my\nlist.  I must go to Lymington myself this time, Edward; for you will be\npuzzled with all our wants.\"\n\n\"Not if I know exactly what you do want; but as I really do not, and\nprobably should make mistakes, I think it will be better if you do go.\nBut it is bedtime, and as I shall start early, good-night, sisters; I\nbeg you will let me have something to eat before I start.  I shall try\nfor some venison, as I come back, and shall take Smoker with me: he is\nquite well again, and his ribs are as stout as ever.\"\n\n\"And, Edward,\" said Alice, \"I wish, when you kill any venison, that you\nwould bring home some of those parts which you usually throw away, for I\nassure you, now that we have three dogs, I hardly know how to find\nenough for them to eat.\"\n\n\"I'll not fail, Alice,\" replied Edward, \"and now once more good-night.\"\n\nEarly the next morning Edward took his gun, and, with Pablo and Smoker,\nset off for Oswald's cottage.\n\nEdward talked a great deal with Pablo relative to his former life; and,\nby the answers which the boy gave him, was satisfied that,\nnotwithstanding his doubtful way of bringing up, the lad was not\ncorrupted, but was a well-minded boy.  As they walked through a grove of\ntrees, Edward still talking, Pablo stopped and put his hand before\nEdward's mouth, and then stooping down, at the same time seizing Smoker\nby the neck, he pointed with his finger.  Edward at first could see\nnothing, but eventually he made out the horns of an animal just rising\nabove a hillock.  It was evidently one of the wild cattle.  Edward\ncocked his gun and advanced cautiously, while Pablo remained where he\nwas, holding Smoker.  As soon as he was near enough to hit the head of\nthe animal, Edward levelled and fired, and Pablo let Smoker loose, who\nbounded forward over the hillock.  They followed the dog, and found him\nabout to seize a calf which stood by a heifer that Edward had shot.\nEdward called him over and went up to the animal; it was a fine young\nheifer, and the calf was not more than a fortnight old.\n\n\"We cannot stop now, Pablo,\" said Edward.  \"Humphrey would like to have\nthe calf, and we must take our chance of its remaining by its mother\ntill we come back.  I think it will for a day or two, so let us push\non.\"\n\nNo further adventure happened, and they arrived a little after noon at\nOswald's cottage.  He was not at home; his wife saying that she believed\nthat he was with the Intendant, who had come back from London the day\nbefore.\n\n\"But I will put on my hood and see,\" said the young woman.\n\nIn a few minutes she returned with Oswald.\n\n\"I am glad that you have come, sir,\" said Oswald, as Edward extended his\nhand, \"as I have just seen the Intendant, and he has been asking many\nquestions about you.  I am certain he thinks that you are not the\ngrandson of Jacob Armitage, and that he supposes I know who you are.  He\nasked me where your cottage was, and whether I could not take him to it,\nas he wished to speak to you, and said that he felt great interest about\nyou.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I said that your cottage was a good day's journey from here, and I was\nnot certain that I knew the exact way, as I had been there but seldom;\nbut that I knew where to find it, after I saw the forests of Arnwood.  I\ntold him about Corbould and his attempt upon you, and he was very wroth.\nI never saw him moved before; and young Mistress Patience, she was\nindeed angry and perplexed, and begged her father to send the assailant\naway as soon as he could be moved.\"\n\n\"Master Heatherstone replied, `Leave it to me, my dear;' and then asked\nme what account Corbould gave of himself, and his falling into the pit.\nI told him that Corbould stated that he was following a deer, which he\nhad severely wounded about noon-day, and having no dog with him, he\ncould not overtake it, although he knew by its bleeding track that it\ncould not hold out much longer.  That he followed it until nightfall,\nand had it in view and close to him when he fell into the pit.\"\n\n\"Well, the story was not badly made up,\" said Edward, \"only for a _stag_\nread _man_; and what did the Intendant say to that?\"\n\n\"He said that he believed you, and that Corbould's story was false--as,\nif it had been a stag that he was following, no one would have known\nthat he had fallen into the pit, and he would have remained there till\nnow.  I quite forgot to say, that when the Intendant said that he wished\nto call at your cottage, the young mistress said that she would go with\nhim, as you had told her that you had two sisters living with you, and\nshe wished very much to see them and make their acquaintance.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that we shall not be able to prevent this visit, Oswald,\"\nreplied Edward.  \"He is in command here, and the forest is in his\ncharge.  We must see to it.  I only should like, if possible, to have\nnotice of his coming, that we may be prepared.\"\n\n\"You need no preparation, sir, if he should come,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Very true,\" said Edward; \"we have nothing to conceal, and if he finds\nus in a pickle it is of no consequence.\"\n\n\"Rather the better, sir,\" replied Oswald.  \"Let your sisters be at the\nwash-tub, and you and your brother carting manure; he will then be more\nlikely to have no suspicion of your being otherwise than what you assume\nto be.\"\n\n\"Have you heard any news from London, Oswald?\"\n\n\"Not as yet.  I was away yesterday evening, when Master Heatherstone\ncame back, and I have not seen his man this morning.  While you eat your\ndinner I will go into the kitchen; and if he is not there, Phoebe will\nbe sure to tell me all that she has heard.\"\n\n\"Do not say that I am here, Oswald, as I do not wish to see the\nIntendant.\"\n\n\"Mum's the word, sir; but you must stay in the cottage, or others will\nsee you, and it may come to his ears.\"\n\nOswald's wife then put before him a large pie, and some wheaten bread,\nwith a biggin of good beer.  Edward helped Pablo to a large allowance,\nand then filled his own platter; while thus occupied Oswald Partridge\nhad left the cottage, as agreed.\n\n\"What do you say, Pablo?  Do you think you can walk back to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Like walking at night.  My people always do; sleep in a daytime.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it will be better to go home: Oswald has only one bed,\nand I do not wish them to know that I am here; so Pablo, eat heartily,\nand then we shall not be so tired.  I want to get home, that I may send\nHumphrey after the calf.\"\n\n\"One bed here; you stay,\" replied Pablo.  \"I go home and tell Master\nHumphrey.\"\n\n\"Do you think you would be able to find your way, Pablo?\"\n\n\"Once go one way, always know same way again.\"\n\n\"You are a clever fellow, Pablo, and I have a mind to try you.  Now\ndrink some beer.  I think, Pablo, you shall go home, and tell Humphrey\nthat I and Smoker will be where the heifer lies dead, and have it\nskinned by nine o'clock to-morrow morning; so if he comes, he will find\nme there.\"\n\n\"Yes, I go now.\"\n\n\"No, not now, you must rest yourself a little more.\"\n\n\"Pablo not tired,\" replied the gipsy, getting up; \"be back before\nsupper.  As I go along, look at calf and dead cow--see if calf stay with\nmother.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, if you wish it, you may go now,\" said Edward.\n\nPablo nodded his head, and disappeared.\n\nA few minutes afterwards Oswald made his appearance.\n\n\"Is the boy gone?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is gone back to the cottage;\" and Edward then stated how he had\nkilled the heifer, and wanted to obtain the calf.\n\n\"I've an idea that you will find that boy very useful, if he is properly\nmanaged.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" replied Edward; \"and I am glad to perceive that he is\nalready attached to all of us.  We treat him as ourselves.\"\n\n\"You are right; and now for the news that I have to tell you.  The Duke\nHamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Lord Capel have been tried,\ncondemned, and executed.\"\n\nEdward sighed.  \"More murder!  But we must expect it from those who have\nmurdered their king.  Is that all?\"\n\n\"No.  King Charles the Second has been proclaimed in Scotland, and\ninvited to come over.\"\n\n\"That is indeed news,\" replied Edward.  \"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"At the Hague; but it was said that he was going to Paris.\"\n\n\"That is all that you have heard?\"\n\n\"Yes; that was what was current when Master Heatherstone was in town.\nHis man Sampson gave me the news; and he further said, `That his\nmaster's journey to London was to oppose the execution of the three\nlords; but it was all in vain.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Edward, after a pause, \"if the king does come over,\nthere will be some work cut out for some of us, I expect.  Your news has\nput me in a fever,\" continued Edward, taking up the biggin and drinking\na large draught of beer.\n\n\"I thought it would,\" replied Oswald; \"but until the time comes, the\nmore quiet you keep the better.\"\n\n\"Yes, Oswald; but I can't talk any more; I must be left alone to think.\nI will go to bed, as I shall be off early in the morning.  Is that\nfellow Corbould getting well?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he is out of bed, and walks a little with a stick; but he is\nstill very lame, and will be for some time.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Oswald; if I have anything to say I will write and send the\nboy.  I do not want to be seen here any more.\"\n\n\"It will be best, sir.  Good-night; I will put Smoker in the kennel to\nthe right, as he will not be friendly with the other dogs.\"\n\nEdward retired to bed, but not to sleep.  The Scots had proclaimed the\nking, and invited him over.  \"He will surely come,\" thought Edward, \"and\nhe will have an army round him as soon as he lands.\"  Edward made up his\nresolution to join the army as soon as he had heard that the king had\nlanded; and what with considering how he should be able so to do, and\nafterwards building castles as to what he would do, it was long before\nhe fell asleep; and when he did, he dreamt of battles and victory--he\nwas charging at the head of his troops--he was surrounded by the dying\nand the dead.  He was wounded, and he was somehow or another well again,\nas if by magic; and then the scene was changed, and he was rescuing\nPatience Heatherstone from his own lawless men, and preserving the life\nof her father, which was about to be sacrificed; and at last he awoke,\nand found that the daylight peeped through the windows, and that he had\nslept longer than he had intended to do.  He arose and dressed himself\nquickly, and, not waiting for breakfast, went to the kennel, released\nSmoker from his durance, and set off on his return.\n\nBefore nine o'clock he had arrived at the spot where the heifer lay\ndead.  He found the calf still by its side, bleating and walking round\nuneasily.  As he approached with the dog, it went to a farther distance,\nand there remained.  Edward took out his knife, and commenced skinning\nthe heifer, and then took out the inside.  The animal was quite fresh\nand good, but not very fat, as may be supposed.  While thus occupied\nSmoker growled and then sprang forward, bounding away in the direction\nof the cottage, and Edward thought Humphrey was at hand.  In a few\nminutes the pony and cart appeared between the trees, with Humphrey and\nPablo in it, and Smoker leaping up at his friend Billy.\n\n\"Good-morning, Humphrey,\" said Edward, \"I am almost ready for you; but\nthe question is, how are we to take the calf?  It is as wild as a deer.\"\n\n\"It will be a puzzler, without Smoker can run it down,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"I take him, with Smoker,\" said Pablo.\n\n\"How will you take it, Pablo?\"\n\nPablo went to the cart and took out a long small cord which Humphrey had\nbrought with them, and made a noose at one end; he coiled the rope in\nhis hand, and then threw it out to its full length, by way of trial.\n\"This way I take him, suppose I get near enough.  This way take bulls in\nSpain: call him lasso.  Now come with me.\"  Pablo had his rope again\ncoiled in his hand, and then went round to the other side of the calf,\nwhich still remained lowing at about 200 yards' distance.\n\n\"Now tell Smoker,\" cried Pablo.\n\nHumphrey set Smoker upon the calf, which retreated from the dog,\npresenting his head to run at it; and Pablo kept behind the animal,\nwhile Smoker attacked it, and drove it near to him.\n\nAs soon as the calf, which was so busy with the dog that it did not\nperceive Pablo, came sufficiently near to him, Pablo threw his rope, and\ncaught the loop round the animal's neck.  The calf set off galloping\ntowards Humphrey, and dragging Pablo after him, for the latter was not\nstrong enough to hold it.\n\nHumphrey went to his assistance, and then Edward, and the calf was\nthrown down by Smoker, who seized it by the neck, and it was tied and\nput on the cart in a few minutes.\n\n\"Well done, Pablo!  You are a clever fellow,\" said Edward, \"and this\ncalf shall be yours.\"\n\n\"It is a cow-calf,\" said Humphrey, \"which I am glad of.  Pablo, you did\nthat well, and, as Edward says, the calf belongs to you.\"\n\nPablo looked pleased, but said nothing.\n\nThe meat and hide were put into the cart with some of the offal which\nAlice had asked for the dogs, and they set off on their return home.\n\nHumphrey was very anxious to go to Lymington, and was not sorry that he\nhad some meat to take with him: he determined to get off the next\nmorning; and Edward proposed that he should take Pablo with him, that he\nmight know the way there in case of any emergency, for they both felt\nthat Pablo could be trusted.  Edward said he would remain at home with\nhis sisters, and see if he could be of any use to Alice; if not, there\nwould be work in the garden.  Humphrey and Pablo went away after\nbreakfast, with Billy, and the meat and skin of the heifer in the cart.\nHumphrey had also a large basket of eggs and three dozen of chickens\nfrom Alice to be disposed of, and a list as long as the tail of a kite\nof articles which she and Edith required; fortunately there was nothing\nvery expensive on the list, long as it was; but women in those day's\nrequired needles, pins, buttons, tapes, thread, worsted, and a hundred\nother little necessaries, as they do now.  As soon as they were gone\nEdward, who was still castle-building instead of offering his services\nto Alice, brought out his father's sword and commenced cleaning it.\nWhen he had polished it up to his satisfaction, he felt less inclined\nthan ever to do anything; so after dinner he took his gun and walked out\ninto the forest, that he might indulge in his reveries.  He walked on,\nquite unconscious of the direction in which he was going, and more than\nonce finding his hat knocked off his head by the branch of a tree which\nhe had not perceived--for the best of all possible reasons, because his\neyes were cast on the ground--when his ears were saluted with the\nneighing of a horse.  He looked up and perceived that he was near to a\nherd of forest ponies, the first that he had seen since he had lived in\nthe forest.\n\nThis roused him, and he looked about him.  \"Where can I have been\nwandering to?\" thought Edward: \"I never fell in with any of the forest\nponies before; I must therefore have walked in a direction quite\ncontrary to what I usually do.  I do not know where I am; the scenery is\nnew to me.  What a fool I am.  It's lucky that nobody except Humphrey\ndigs pitfalls, or I should probably have been in one by this time; and\nI've brought out my gun and left the dog at home.  Well, I suppose I can\nfind my way back.\"  Edward then surveyed the whole herd of ponies, which\nwere at no great distance from him.  There was a fine horse or two among\nthem, which appeared to be the leaders of the herd.  They allowed Edward\nto approach to within two hundred yards, and then, with manes and tails\nstreaming in the air, they darted off with the rapidity of the wind.\n\n\"Now I'll puzzle Humphrey when I go back,\" thought Edward.  \"He says\nthat Billy is getting old, and that he wishes he could get another pony.\nI will tell him what a plenty there are, and propose that he should\ninvent some way of catching one.  That will be a poser for him; yet I'm\nsure that he'll try, for he is very ingenious.  And now which way am I\nto turn to find my way home?  I think it ought to be to the north; but\nwhich is north?  For there is no sun out, and now I perceive it looks\nvery like rain.  I wonder how long I have been walking!  I'm sure I\ndon't know.\"\n\nEdward then hurried in a direction which he considered might lead him\nhomeward, and walked fast; but he once more fell into his habit of\ncastle-building, and was talking to himself: \"The king proclaimed in\nScotland!  He will come over of course: I will join his army--and\nthen--\"\n\nThus he went on, again absorbed in the news which he had gained from\nOswald, till on a sudden he again recollected himself, and perceived\nthat he had lost sight of the copse of trees on a high hill, to which he\nhad been directing his steps.  Where was it?  He turned round and round,\nand at last found out that he had been walking away from it.\n\n\"I must dream no more,\" thought he; \"or if I do indulge in any more\nday-dreams, I certainly shall neither sleep nor dream to-night.  It is\ngetting dark already, and here am I lost in the forest, and all through\nmy own foolishness.  If the stars do not shine, I shall not know how to\ndirect my steps; indeed, if they do, I don't know whether I have walked\nsouth or north, and I am in a pretty pickle;--not that I care for being\nout in the forest on a night like this; but my sisters and Humphrey will\nbe alarmed at my absence.  The best thing I can do, is to decide upon\ntaking some straight line, and continue in it: I must then get out of\nthe forest at last, even if I walk right across it.  That will be better\nthan going backwards and forwards, or round and round, as I otherwise\nshall do, just like a puppy running after its own tail.  So now shine\nout, stars.\"\n\nEdward waited until he could make out Charles's Wain, which he well\nknew, and then the Polar Star.  As soon as he was certain of that, he\nresolved to travel by it due north, and he did so, sometimes walking\nfast, and at others keeping up a steady trot for half a mile without\nstopping.  As he was proceeding on his travels, he observed, under some\ntrees ahead of him, a spark of fire emitted; he thought it was a\nglow-worm at first; but it was more like the striking of a flint against\nsteel; and as he saw it a second time, he stopped, that he might\nascertain what it might be before he advanced farther.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\n\nIt was now very dark, as there was no moon, and the stars were often\nobscured by the clouds, which were heavy, and borne along by the wind,\nwhich was very high.  The light again appeared, and this time Edward\nheard the clash of the flint against the steel, and he was certain that\nit was somebody striking a light.  He advanced very cautiously, and\narrived at a large tree, behind which he remained to reconnoitre.  The\npeople, whoever they might be, were not more than thirty yards from him;\na light spread its rays for a moment or two, and he could make out a\nfigure kneeling and holding his hat to protect it from the wind; then it\nburnt brighter, and he saw that a lantern had been lighted, and then\nagain, of a sudden, all was dark again: so Edward immediately satisfied\nhimself that a dark lantern had been lighted and then closed.  Who the\nparties might be he of course had no idea; but he was resolved that he\nwould ascertain, if he could, before he accosted them and asked his way.\n\n\"They have no dog,\" thought Edward, \"or it would have growled before\nthis; and it's lucky that I have none either.\"  Edward then crept softly\nnearer to them: the wind, which was strong, blew from where they were to\nwhere Edward stood, so that there was less chance of their hearing his\napproach.\n\nEdward went on his hands and knees, and crawled through the fern until\nhe gained another tree, and within ten yards of them, and from where he\ncould hear what they might say.  He was thus cautious, as he had been\ntold by Oswald that there were many disbanded soldiers who had taken up\ntheir quarters in the forest, and had committed several depredations\nupon the houses adjacent to it, always returning to the forest as a\nrendezvous.  Edward listened, and heard one say:\n\n\"It is not time yet!  No, no: too soon by half an hour or more.  The\npeople from Lymington who buy him what he wants always bring it to him\nat night, that his retreat may not be discovered.  They sometimes do not\nleave the cottage till two hours after dark, for they do not leave\nLymington to go there till it is dark!\"\n\n\"Do you know who it is who supplies him with food?\"\n\n\"Yes, the people at the inn in Parliament Street--I forget the sign.\"\n\n\"Oh!  I know.  Yes, the landlord is a downright Malignant in his heart!\nWe might squeeze him well, if we dared show ourselves in Lymington.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they would squeeze our necks tighter than would be agreeable,\nI expect,\" replied the other.\n\n\"Are you sure that he has money?\"\n\n\"Quite sure; for I peeped through the chinks of the window-shutters, and\nI saw him pay for the things brought to him; it was from a canvas bag,\nand it was gold that he took out.\"\n\n\"And where did he put the bag after he had paid them?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell, for as I knew that they would come out as soon as\nthey were paid, I was obliged to beat a retreat, lest I should be seen.\"\n\n\"Well, then, how is it to be managed?\"\n\n\"We must first tap at the door, and try if we can get in as benighted\ntravellers: if that won't do, and I fear it will not, while you remain\nbegging for admittance at the door, and keep him occupied, I will try\nthe door behind, that leads into the garden; and if not the door, I will\ntry the window.  I have examined them both well, and have been outside\nwhen he has shut up his shutters, and I know the fastenings.  With a\npane out, I could open them immediately.\"\n\n\"Is there anybody else besides him in the cottage?\"\n\n\"Yes, a lad who attends him, and goes to Lymington for him.\"\n\n\"No women?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\n\"But do you think we two are sufficient?  Had we not better get more\nhelp?  There is Broom, and Black, the gipsy, at the rendezvous.  I can\ngo for them, and be back in time: they are stout and true.\"\n\n\"Stout enough, but not true.  No, no, I want no sharers in this\nbusiness, and you know how ill they behaved in the last affair.  I'll\nswear that they only produced half the swag.  I like honour between\ngentlemen and soldiers; and that's why I have chosen you.  I know I can\ntrust you, Benjamin.  It's time now--what do you say?  We are two to\none, for I count the boy as nothing.  Shall we start?\"\n\n\"I am with you.  You say there's a bag of gold, and that's worth\nfighting for.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ben, and I'll tell you: with what I've got buried, and my share of\nthat bag, I shall have enough, I think; and I'll start for the Low\nCountries, for England's getting rather too warm for me.\"\n\n\"Well, I shan't go yet,\" replied Benjamin; \"I don't like your foreign\nparts; they have no good ale, and I can't understand their talk.  I'd\nsooner remain in jolly old England with a halter twisted ready for me,\nthan pass my life with such a set of chaps who drink nothing but\nScheidam, and wear twenty pair of breeches.  Come, let's be off: if we\nget the money, you shall go to the Low Countries, Will, and I'll start\nfor the north, where they don't know me--for if you go, I won't stay\nhere.\"\n\nThe two men then rose up; and the one whose name appeared to be Will,\nfirst examined if the candle in his dark lantern burnt well; and then\nthey both set off, followed by Edward, who had heard quite enough to\nsatisfy him that they were bent upon a burglary--if not murder.  Edward\nfollowed them, so as to keep their forms indistinctly in sight, which\nwas as much as he could do at twenty yards' distance: fortunately the\nwind was so high that they did not hear his footsteps, although he often\ntrod upon a rotten stick, which snapped as it broke in twain.  As near\nas Edward could guess, he had tracked them for about three miles, when\nthey stopped, and he perceived that they were examining their pistols,\nwhich they took from their belts.  They then went on again, and entered\na small plantation of oak-trees, of about forty years' growth--very\nthick and very dark, with close underwood below.  They followed each\nother through a narrow path, until they came to a cleared place in the\nmiddle of the plantation, in which there stood a low cottage, surrounded\nwith covert on every side, with the exception of some thirty yards of\nland around it.  All was still, and as dark as pitch; Edward remained\nbehind the trees, and when the two men again stopped, he was not six\nfeet from them.  They consulted in a low tone, but the wind was so high\nthat he could not distinguish what they said.  At last they advanced to\nthe cottage, and Edward, still keeping within the trees, shifted his\nposition so that he should be opposite the gable end of the cottage.  He\nobserved one man to go up to the front door, while the other went round\nto the door behind, as had been agreed.  Edward threw open the pan of\nthe lock of the gun, and reprimed it, that he might be sure, and then\nwaited for what was to follow.  He heard the man Will at the front door,\ntalking and asking for shelter in a plaintive but loud voice; and\nshortly afterwards he perceived a light through the chinks of the\nshutters--for Edward was continually altering his position to see what\nwas going on in the front and in the back.  At one time he thought of\nlevelling his gun and killing one of the men at once; but he could not\nmake up his mind to do that, as a burglary, although intended, had not\nyet been committed; so he remained passive until the attack was really\nmade, when he resolved that he would come to the rescue.  After some\nminutes of entreaty that they would open the door, the man in front\ncommenced thumping and beating against it, as if he would make them open\nthe door by force; but this was to attract the attention of those\nwithin, and divert it from the attempts that the other was making to get\nin behind.  Edward was aware of this: he now kept his eye upon what was\ngoing on at the back.  Advancing nearer, which he ventured to do now\nthat both the men were so occupied, he perceived that the fellow had\ncontrived to open the window close to the back door, and was remaining\nquite close to it with a pistol in his hand, apparently not wishing to\nrun the risk of climbing in.  Edward slipped under the eaves of the\ncottage, not six feet from the man, who remained with his back partly\nturned towards him.  Edward then finding he had obtained this position\nunperceived, crouched down with his gun ready pointed.\n\nAs Edward remained in this position, he heard a shrill voice cry out,\n\"They are getting in behind!\" and a movement in the cottage.  The man\nnear him, who had his pistol in his hand, put his arm through the window\nand fired inside.  A shriek was given, and Edward fired his gun into the\nbody of the man, who immediately fell.  Edward lost no time in reloading\nhis gun, during which he heard the bursting open of the front door and\nthe report of firearms; then all was silent for a moment, excepting the\nwailing of somebody within.  As soon as his gun was reloaded Edward\nwalked round to the front of the cottage, where he found the man who was\ncalled Ben lying across the threshold of the open door.  He stepped\nacross the body, and, looking into the room within, perceived a body\nstretched on the floor, and a young lad weeping over it.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, I am a friend,\" said Edward, going in to where the\nbody lay; and taking the light which was at the farther end of the\nchamber, he placed it on the floor, that he might examine the state of\nthe person who was breathing heavily, and apparently badly wounded.\n\"Rise up, my lad,\" said Edward, \"and let me see if I can be of any use.\"\n\n\"Ah!  No,\" cried the boy, throwing back his long hair from his temples,\n\"he bleeds to death!\"\n\n\"Bring me some water quick,\" said Edward, \"there's a good lad, while I\nsee where he is hurt.\"\n\nThe boy ran up to fetch the water, and Edward discovered that the ball\nhad entered the neck, above the collar-bone, and that the blood poured\nout of the man's mouth, who was choking with the effusion.  Although\nignorant of surgery, Edward thought that such a wound must be mortal;\nbut the man was not only alive but sensible, and although he could not\nutter a word, he spoke with his eyes and with signs.  He raised his hand\nand pointed to himself first, and shook his head, as if to say that it\nwas all over with him; and then he turned round his head, as if looking\nfor the lad, who was now returning with the water.  When the lad again\nknelt by his side, weeping bitterly, the man pointed to him, and gave\nsuch an imploring look that Edward immediately comprehended what he\nwished; it was to ask protection for the boy.  It could not be\nmisunderstood, and could Edward do otherwise than promise it to the\ndying man?  His generous nature could not refuse it, and he said, \"I\nunderstand you; you wish me to take care of your boy when you are gone.\nIs it not so?\"\n\nThe man signified assent.\n\n\"I promise you I will do so.  I will take him into my own family, and he\nshall share with us.\"\n\nThe man raised his hand again, and a gleam of joy passed over his\nfeatures as he took the hand of the lad and put it into that of Edward.\nHis eyes were then fixed upon Edward, as if to scrutinise into his\ncharacter by his features, while the former bathed his temples and\nwashed the blood from his mouth with the water brought by the boy, who\nappeared in a state of grief so violent as to paralyse his senses.\nAfter a minute or two another effusion of blood choked the wounded man,\nwho, after a short struggle, fell back dead.\n\n\"He is gone!\" thought Edward, \"and now what is to be done?  I must first\nascertain whether the two villains are dead or not.\"  Edward took a\nlight and examined the body of Ben, lying over the threshold of the\ndoor; the man was quite dead, the ball having entered his brain.  He was\nproceeding round the outside of the cottage to examine the state of the\nother man, whom he had shot himself; but the wind nearly blew out the\nlight, and he therefore returned to the chamber and placed it on the\nfloor, near to where the boy lay insensible over the corpse of the man\nwho had died in the arms of Edward; and then went out without a light,\nand with his gun, to the other side of the cottage, where the other\nrobber had fallen.  As he approached the man, a faint voice was heard to\nsay:\n\n\"Ben, Ben!  Some water, for the love of God!  Ben, I'm done for!\"\n\nEdward, without giving an answer, went back to the room for the water,\nwhich he took round to the man, and put it to his lips; he felt that he\nwas bound by humanity so to do to a dying man, scoundrel though he might\nbe.  It was still dark, but not so dark as it had previously been, for\nthe late moon was just rising.\n\nThe man drank the water eagerly, and said, \"Ben, I can speak now, but I\nshan't long.\"  He then pulled the basin towards him again, and after he\nhad drunk, he said in broken sentences, \"I feel--that I am bleeding to\ndeath--inside.\"  Then he paused.  \"You know the oak--struck by\nlightning--a mile north--of this.  Oh!  I'm going fast.  Three yards\nfrom it south--I buried all my--money; it's yours.  Oh, another drink!\"\nThe man again attempted to drink out of the basin proffered by Edward;\nbut as he made the attempt he fell back with a groan.\n\nEdward, perceiving that he was dead, returned to the cottage to look\nafter the lad, who still remained prostrate and embracing the corpse in\nthe chamber.  Edward then reflected upon what had best be done.  After a\ntime he decided upon dragging away the body of the robber named Ben\noutside of the threshold, and then securing the door.  This, with some\ntrouble, he effected, and he then made fast the window that had been\nforced open behind.  Before he removed the boy, who lay with his face\nburied on the corpse, and appeared to be in a state of insensibility,\nEdward examined the corpse as it lay.  Although plainly dressed, yet it\nwas evident that it was not the body of a rustic; the features were\nfair, and the beard was carefully cut; the hands were white, and the\nfingers long, and evidently had never been employed in labour.  That the\nbody was that of some superior person disguised as a rustic, was\nevident, and this was corroborated by the conversation which took place\nbetween the two robbers.  \"Alas!\" thought Edward, \"the family of Arnwood\nappear not to be the only people who are in disguise in this forest.\nThat poor boy!  He must not remain there.\"  Edward looked round, and\nperceived that there was a bed in the adjoining room, the door of which\nwas open; he lifted up the boy, and carried him, still insensible, into\nthe room, and laid him on the bed.  He then went for some more water,\nwhich he found and threw into his face, and poured a little into his\nmouth.  Gradually the boy stirred, and recovered from his stupor, and\nthen Edward held the water to his mouth, and made him drink some, which\nhe did, and then, suddenly aroused to a recollection of what had passed,\nthe boy gave a shriek of woe, and burst into a paroxysm of tears.  This\nended in convulsive sobbings and low moanings.  Edward felt that he\ncould do no more at present, and that it would be better if he was left\nfor a time to give vent to his grief.  Edward sat down on a stool by the\nside of the orphan, and remained for some time in deep and melancholy\nthought.  \"How strange,\" thought he at last, \"it is, that I should feel\nso little as I do now, surrounded by death, compared to what I did when\ngood old Jacob Armitage died!  Then I felt it deeply, and there was an\nawe in death.  Now I no longer dread it.  Is it because I loved the good\nold man, and felt that I had lost a friend?  No, that cannot be the\ncause; I may have felt more grief but not awe or dread.  Or is it\nbecause that was the first time that I had seen death, and it is the\nfirst sight of death which occasions awe?  Or is it because that every\nday I have fancied myself on the battle-field, with hundreds lying dead\nand wounded around me, in my dreamings?  I know not.  Poor old Jacob\ndied peaceably in his bed, like a good Christian, and trusting, after a\nblameless life, to find mercy through his Saviour.  Two of these who are\nnow dead, out of the three, have been summoned away in the height of\ntheir wickedness, and in the very commission of crime; the third has\nbeen foully murdered; and out of three lying dead, one has fallen by my\nown hand, and yet I feel not so much as when I attended the couch, and\nlistened to the parting words of a dying Christian!  I cannot account\nfor it, or reason why; I only know that it is so, and I now look upon\ndeath unconcerned.  Well, this is a kind of preparation for the\nwholesale murder and horrors of the battle-field, which I have so long\nsighed for--God forgive me if I am wrong!  And this poor boy!  I have\npromised to protect him, and I will.  Could I fail my promise, I should\nimagine the spirit of his father (as I presume he was) looking down and\nupbraiding me.  No, no, I will protect him.  I and my brother and\nsisters have been preserved and protected, and I were indeed vile if I\ndid not do to others as I have been done by.  And now let me reflect\nwhat is to be done.  I must not take the boy away, and bury the bodies;\nthis person has friends at Lymington, and they will come here.  The\nmurder has taken place in the forest: then I must let the Intendant know\nwhat has occurred.  I will send over to Oswald; Humphrey shall go.  Poor\nfellow!  What a state of anxiety must he and my little sisters be in at\nmy not returning home!  I had quite forgotten that; but it cannot be\nhelped.  I will wait till sunrise, and then see if the boy will be more\nhimself, and probably from him I shall be able to find out what part of\nthe forest I am in.\"\n\nEdward took up the candle and went into the room in which he had laid\nthe boy on the bed.  He found him in a sound sleep.  \"Poor fellow,\" said\nEdward, \"he has for a time forgotten his misery.  What a beautiful boy\nhe is!  I long to know his history.  Sleep on, my poor fellow!  It will\ndo you service.\"\n\nEdward then returned to the other room, and recollected, or rather was\nreminded, that he had had no supper, and it was now nearly dawn of day.\nHe looked into a cupboard and found plenty of provisions and some flasks\nof wine.  \"I have earned my supper,\" thought he, \"and I will not,\ntherefore, deny myself.\"  So he brought out the viands and a flask of\nwine, and made a hearty meal.  \"It is long since I have tasted wine,\"\nthought he, \"and it may be long ere I drink it again.  I have little\nrelish for it now; it is too fiery to the palate.  I recollect, when a\nchild, how my father used to have me at the table, and give me a stoup\nof claret, which I could hardly lift to my lips, to drink to the health\nof the king.\"  The memory of the king raised other thoughts in Edward's\nmind, and he again sank into one of his reveries, which lasted till he\nfell into a slumber.  When he woke up, it was at the voice of the boy,\nwho in his sleep had cried out \"Father!\"  Edward started up, and found\nthat the sun was an hour high, and that he must have slept some time.\nHe gently opened the cottage-door, looked at the bodies of the two men,\nand then walked out to survey the locality of the cottage, which he had\nbut faintly made out during the night.  He found that it was surrounded\nby a thicket of trees and underwood, so close and thick that there\nappeared to him no outlet in any direction.  \"What a place for\nconcealment!\" thought Edward, \"but still these prowling thieves\ndiscovered it.  Why, troops of horse might scour the forest for months,\nand never discover such a hiding-place.\"  Edward walked round by the\nside of the thicket, to find out the track by which the robbers had\nentered when he followed them, and at last succeeded in doing so.  He\nfollowed the path through the thicket until he was clear of it and again\nin the forest, but the scenery outside was unknown to him, and he had\nnot an idea as to what part of the forest it was in.  \"I must question\nthe boy,\" thought Edward.  \"I will go back and wake him up, for it is\ntime that I was moving.\"  As he was again turning into the thicket he\nheard a dog giving tongue, as if on a scent.  It came nearer and nearer\nto him, and Edward remained to see what it might be.  In a moment more\nhe perceived his own dog, Smoker, come bounding out of a neighbouring\ncopse, followed by Humphrey and Pablo.  Edward hallooed.  Smoker sprang\ntowards him, leaping up, and loading him with caresses, and in another\nmoment he was in Humphrey's arms.\n\n\"Oh, Edward, let me first thank God!\" said Humphrey, as the tears\nstarted and rolled down his cheeks.  \"What a night we have passed!  What\nhas happened?  That dear fellow Pablo thought of putting Smoker on the\nscent; he brought out your jacket and showed it to Smoker, and gave it\nhim to smell, and then led him along till he was on your footsteps; and\nthe dog followed him, it seems, although it has been round and round in\nevery direction, till at last he has brought us to you.\"\n\nEdward shook hands with Pablo, and thanked him.  \"How far are we from\nthe cottage, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"About eight miles, I should say, Edward; not more.\"\n\n\"Well, I have much to tell you, and I must tell it to you in few words\nbefore I go farther, and afterwards I will tell you all in detail.\"\n\nEdward then gave a succinct narration of what had occurred, and, having\nthus prepared Humphrey and Pablo for what they were to see, led the way\nback through the thicket to the cottage inside of it.  Humphrey and\nPablo were much shocked at the scene of slaughter which presented itself\nto their eyes; and, after having viewed the bodies, they began to\nconsult what had best be done.\n\nThe proposal of Edward, that Humphrey should go over and make known the\ncircumstances to Oswald, that they might be communicated to the\nIntendant, was readily acceded to; and Pablo, it was agreed, should go\nhome and tell Alice and Edith that Edward was safe.\n\n\"But now, Humphrey, about this boy; we cannot leave him here.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He still sleeps, I believe.  The question is, whether you should ride\nover with the pony or walk, and leave Pablo to return with the pony and\ncart; for I will not take the boy away or leave the house myself without\nremoving the property which belongs to the boy, and of which I will make\ninquiry when he wakes.  Besides, there is money, by what the robbers\nstated, which of course must be taken care of for him.\"\n\n\"I think it will be best for me to walk over, Edward.  If I ride, I\nshould arrive too late in the afternoon for anything to be done till\nnext morning, and if I walk, I shall be in time enough, so that is\nsettled.  Besides, it will give you more time to remove the boy's\nproperty, which, as his father was in all probability a Malignant, and a\ndenounced man, they might think right to secure for the government.\"\n\n\"Very true; then be it so.  Do you start for the Intendant's; and Pablo,\ngo home and fetch the pony and cart, while I remain here with the boy,\nand get everything ready.\"\n\nHumphrey and Pablo both set off, and then Edward went to waken the boy,\nstill lying on the bed.\n\n\"Come, you must get up now.  You know that what's done cannot be undone;\nand if you are a good boy, and have read the Bible, you must know that\nwe must submit to the will of God, who is our kind Father in heaven.\"\n\n\"Ah me!\" said the boy, who was awake when Edward went to him, \"I know\nwell it is my duty, but it is a hard duty, and I am heart-broken.  I\nhave lost my father, the only friend I had in the world: who is there to\nlove and to cherish me now?  What will become of me?\"\n\n\"I promised your father, before he died, that I would take care of you,\nmy poor fellow; and a promise is sacred with me, even if it were not\nmade to a dying man.  I will do my best, depend upon it, for I have\nknown myself what it is to want and to find a protector.  You shall live\nwith me and my brother and sisters, and you shall have all we have.\"\n\n\"Have you sisters, then?\" replied the boy.\n\n\"Yes; I have sent for the cart to take you away from this, and to-night\nyou shall be in our cottage; but now tell me--I do not ask who your\nfather was, or why he was living here in secret, as I found it out by\nwhat I overheard the robbers say to one another--but how long have you\nlived here?\"\n\n\"More than a year.\"\n\n\"Whose cottage is it?\"\n\n\"My father bought it when he came, as he thought it safer so, that he\nmight not be discovered or betrayed; for he had escaped from prison\nafter having been condemned to death by the Parliament.\"\n\n\"Then he was a loyal man to his king?\"\n\n\"Yes he was, and that was his only crime.\"\n\n\"Then fear not, my good boy; we are all loyal as well as he was, and\nwill never be otherwise.  I tell you this that you may safely trust to\nus.  Now, if the cottage was his, the furniture and property were his\nalso.\"\n\n\"Yes; all was his.\"\n\n\"And it is now yours, is it not?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said the boy, bursting into tears.\n\n\"Then listen to me;--your father is safe from all persecution now; he\nis, I trust, in heaven; and you they cannot touch, as you have done\nnothing to offend them; but still they will take possession of your\nfather's property as soon as they know of his death, and find out who he\nwas.  This, for your sake, I wish to prevent them from doing, and have\ntherefore sent for the cart, that I may remove to my cottage everything\nthat is of value, that it may be held for your benefit; some day or\nanother you may require it.  The murder having been committed in the\nforest, and I having been a witness, and, moreover, having shot one of\nthe robbers, I have considered it right to send over to the Intendant of\nthe forest to give him notice of what has taken place within his\njurisdiction.  I do not think he is so bad a man as the rest; but still,\nwhen he comes here, he may consider it his duty to take possession of\neverything for the Parliament, as I have no doubt such are his orders,\nor will be when he communicates with the Parliament.  Now this is a\nrobbery which I wish to prevent, by carrying away your property before\nthey come over, which they will to-morrow, and I propose that you shall\naccompany me, with all that you can take away, or that may be useful,\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" replied the boy.  \"I will do all you wish; but I\nfeel very weak, and very unwell.\"\n\n\"You must exert yourself for your own sake, my poor fellow.  Come, now,\nsit up and put all your own clothes together.  Collect everything in\nthis room, while I look about the house.  And tell me, had not your\nfather some money?  For the robbers said that they saw him counting it\nout of a sack, through the chinks of the shutters, and that was why they\nmade the attack.\"\n\n\"Hateful money!\" cried the boy.  \"Yes, he had, I believe, a great deal\nof money; but I cannot say how much.\"\n\n\"Now get up, and do as I request, my dear boy,\" said Edward, raising him\nup in his arms; \"when your grief is lessened, you may have many happy\ndays yet in store for you; you have a Father in heaven that you must put\nyour trust in, and with Him you will find peace.\"\n\nThe boy rose up, and Edward closed the door of the chamber, that he\nmight not see his father's corpse.\n\n\"I do put my trust in Heaven, good sir,\" replied the boy, \"for it has\nalready sent me a kind friend in my distress.  You are good, I am sure;\nI see that in your face.  Alas!  How much more wretched would have been\nmy condition if you had not fortunately come to our assistance!  Too\nlate, indeed, to save my poor father, but not too late to succour and\nconsole his child.  I will go away with you, for I cannot stay here.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\n\nEdward then took the counterpane off the bed, and went with it into the\nnext room.  He gently drew the body to the corner of the room, and\ncovered it up with the counterpane, and then proceeded to examine the\ncupboards, etcetera.  In one he found a good store of books, in another\nthere was linen of all sorts, a great many curious arms, two suits of\nbright armour such as worn in those times, pistols and guns, and\nammunition.  On the floor of one of the cupboards was an iron chest\nabout two feet by eighteen inches.  It was locked.  Edward immediately\nconcluded that this chest held the money of the unfortunate man; but\nwhere was the key?  Most likely about his person.  He did not like to\nafflict the poor boy by putting the question to him, but he went to the\nbody and examined the pockets of the clothes; he found a bunch of\nseveral keys, which he took, and then replaced the coverlid.  He tried\none of the keys, which appeared to be of the right size, to the lock of\nthe iron chest, and found that it fitted it.  Satisfied with this, he\ndid not raise the lid of the chest, but dragged it out into the centre\nof the room.  There were many things of value about the room; the\ncandlesticks were silver, and there were goblets of the same metal.\nEdward collected all these articles, and a timepiece, and put them into\na basket, of which there were two large ones at the end of the room,\napparently used for holding firewood.  Everything that he thought could\nbe useful, or of value, he gathered together for the benefit of the poor\norphan boy.  He afterwards went into another small room, where he found\nsundry small trunks and cases locked-up.  These he brought out without\nexamining, as he presumed that they contained what was of value, or they\nwould not be locked.  When he had collected everything, he found that he\nhad already more than the cart could carry in one trip; and he wanted to\ntake some bedding with him, as he had not a spare bed in the cottage to\ngive to the boy.  Edward decided in his own mind that he would take the\nmost valuable articles away that night, and return with the cart for the\nremainder early on the following morning.  It was now past noon, and\nEdward took out of the cupboard what victuals were left, and then went\ninto the chamber where the boy was, and begged that he would eat\nsomething.  The poor boy said that he had no appetite; but Edward\ninsisted, and at last prevailed upon him to eat some bread and drink a\nglass of wine, which proved of great service to him.  The poor fellow\nshuddered as he saw the body covered up in the corner of the room, but\nsaid nothing.  Edward was trying to make him eat a little more, when\nPablo made his appearance at the door.\n\n\"Have you put up all that you want in the bed-chamber?\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes, I have put up everything.\"\n\n\"Then we will bring them out.  Come, Pablo, you must help us.\"\n\nPablo made signs, and pointed to the door.  Edward went out.\n\n\"First pull body away from this.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Edward; \"we must do so.\"\n\nEdward and Pablo pulled the body of the robber on one side of the\ndoorway, and threw over it some dried fern which lay by; they then\nbacked the cart down to the door; the iron chest was first got in, then\nall the heavy articles, such as armour, guns, and books, etcetera, and\nby that time the cart was more than half-loaded.  Edward then went into\nthe chamber, and brought out the packages the boy had made up, and put\nthem all in the cart until it was loaded high up; they brought out some\nblankets, and laid over all, to keep things steady; and then Edward told\nthe boy that all was ready, and that they had better go.\n\n\"Yes, I am willing,\" replied he, with streaming eyes; \"but let me see\nhim once more.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Edward, leading him to the corpse, and uncovering the\nface.\n\nThe boy knelt down, kissed the forehead and cold lips, covered up the\nface again, and then rose and wept bitterly on Edward's shoulder.\nEdward did not attempt to check his sorrow; he thought it better it\nshould have vent; but, after a time, he led the boy by degrees till they\nwere out of the cottage.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Edward, \"we must go, or we shall be late.  My poor\nlittle sisters have been dreadfully alarmed at my not having come home\nlast night, and I long to clasp them in my arms.\"\n\n\"Indeed you must,\" replied the boy, wiping away his tears, \"and I am\nvery selfish; let us go on.\"\n\n\"No room for cart to get through wood,\" said Pablo; \"hard work, cart\nempty--more hard work, cart full.\"\n\nAnd so it proved to be; and it required all the united efforts of Billy,\nEdward, and Pablo, to force a passage for the cart through the narrow\npathway; but at last it was effected, and then they went on at a quick\npace, and in less than two hours the cottage was in sight.  When within\ntwo hundred yards of it, Edith, who had been on the watch, came bounding\nout, flew into Edward's arms, and covered him with kisses.\n\n\"You naughty Edward, to frighten us so!\"\n\n\"Look, Edith, I have brought you a nice little play-fellow.  Welcome\nhim, dearest.\"\n\nEdith extended her hand as she looked into the boy's face.\n\n\"He is a pretty boy, Edward, much prettier than Pablo.\"\n\n\"No, Missy Edith,\" said Pablo; \"Pablo more man than he.\"\n\n\"Yes, you may be more man, Pablo; but you are not pretty.\"\n\n\"And where is Alice?\"\n\n\"She was getting supper ready, and I did not tell her that I saw you\ncoming, because I wanted first kiss.\"\n\n\"You little jealous thing!  But here comes Alice.  Dear Alice, you have\nbeen very uneasy, but it was not my fault,\" said Edward, kissing her.\n\"If I had not been where I was this poor boy would have been killed as\nwell as his father.  Make him welcome, Alice, for he is an orphan now,\nand must live with us.  I have brought many things in the cart, and\nto-morrow we will bring more, for we have no bed for him, and to-night\nhe must sleep with me.\"\n\n\"We will make him as happy as we can, Edward; and we will be sisters to\nhim,\" said Alice, looking at the boy, who was blushing deeply.  \"How old\nare you?  And what is your name?\"\n\n\"I am thirteen years old next January,\" replied the boy.\n\n\"And your Christian name?\"\n\n\"I will tell you by and by,\" replied he, confused.\n\nThey arrived at the cottage, and Edward and Pablo were busy unpacking\nthe cart, and putting all the contents into the inner chamber, where\nPablo now slept, when Alice, who, with Edith, had been talking to the\nboy, came to Edward and said--\"Edward, she's a girl!\"\n\n\"A girl!\" replied Edward, astonished.\n\n\"Yes, she has told me so, and wished me to tell you.\"\n\n\"But why does she wear boys' clothes?\"\n\n\"It was her father's wish, as he was very often obliged to send her to\nLymington to a friend's house, and he was afraid of her getting into\ntrouble; but she has not told me her story as yet--she says that she\nwill to-night.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied Edward, \"you must make up a bed for her in your\nroom to-night.  Take Pablo's bed, and he shall sleep with me.  To-morrow\nmorning I will bring some more bedding from her cottage.\"\n\n\"How Humphrey will be surprised when he comes back!\" said Alice,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Yes; she will make a nice little wife for him some years hence; and she\nmay prove an heiress perhaps, for there is an iron chest with money in\nit.\"\n\nAlice returned to her new companion, and Edward and Pablo continued to\nunload the cart.\n\n\"Well, Pablo, I suppose you will allow that, now that you know she is a\ngirl, she is handsomer than you?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Pablo, \"very handsome girl; but too much girl for\nhandsome boy.\"\n\nAt last everything was out of the cart, the iron chest dragged into\nPablo's room, and Billy put into his stable and given his supper, which\nhe had well earned, for the cart had been very heavily loaded.  They\nthen all sat down to supper, Edward saying to their new acquaintance--\n\n\"So I find that I am to have another sister instead of another brother.\nNow you will tell me your name?\"\n\n\"Yes; Clara is my name.\"\n\n\"And why did you not tell me that you are a girl?\"\n\n\"I did not like, because I was in boys' clothes, and felt ashamed;\nindeed I was too unhappy to think about what I was.  My poor dear\nfather!\" and she burst into tears.\n\nAlice and Edith kissed her and consoled her, and she became calm again.\nAfter supper was over they busied themselves making arrangements for her\nsleeping in their room, and then they went to prayers.\n\n\"We have much to be thankful for, my dears,\" said Edward.  \"I am sure I\nfeel that I have been in great danger, and I only wish that I had been\nmore useful than I have been; but it has been the will of God, and we\nmust not arraign His decrees.  Let us return thanks for His great\nmercies, and bow in submission to His dispensations, and pray that He\nwill give peace to poor little Clara, and soften her affliction.\"\n\nAnd as Edward prayed, little Clara knelt and sobbed, while Alice\ncaressed her with her arm round her waist, and at times stopped her\nprayer to kiss and console her.  When they had finished, Alice led her\naway to her bedroom, followed by Edith, and they put her to bed.  Edward\nand Pablo also retired, both worn out by the fatigue and excitement of\nthe day.\n\nThey were up on the following morning at day-dawn, and, putting Billy in\nthe cart, set off for the cottage of Clara.  They found everything as\nthey had left it, and, having loaded the cart with what had been left\nbehind the day before, the bedding for two beds, with several articles\nof furniture which Edward thought might be useful, there being still a\nlittle room left, Edward packed up in a wooden case with dried fern all\nthe wine that was in the cupboard; and, having assisted Pablo in forcing\nthe cart once more through the path in the wood, he left him to return\nhome with the cart, while he remained to wait the arrival of Humphrey,\nand whoever might come with him from the Intendant's.  About ten\no'clock, as he was watching outside of the wood, he perceived several\npeople approaching him, and soon made out that Humphrey, the Intendant,\nand Oswald were among the number.  When they came up to him Edward\nsaluted the Intendant in a respectful manner, shook hands with Oswald,\nand then led the way by the narrow path through the wood to the cottage.\nThe Intendant was on horseback, but all the rest were on foot.\n\nThe Intendant left his horse to the care of one of the verderers, and\nwent through the wood on foot with the of the party, preceded by Edward.\nHe appeared to be very grave and thoughtful, and Edward thought that\nthere was a coolness in his manner towards himself,--for it must be\nrecollected that Mr Heatherstone had not seen Edward since he had\nrendered him such service in saving the life of his daughter.  The\nconsequence was, that Edward felt somewhat indignant, but he did not\nexpress his feelings, by his looks even, but conveyed the party in\nsilence to the cottage.  On their arrival, Edward pointed to the body of\nthe robber, which had been covered with fern, and the verderers exposed\nit.\n\n\"By whose hand did that man fall?\" said the Intendant.\n\n\"By the hand of the party who lived in the cottage.\"\n\nEdward then led the way round to the back of the cottage where the other\nrobber lay--\n\n\"And this man was slain by my hand,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"We have one more body to see,\" continued Edward, leading the way into\nthe cottage and uncovering the corpse of Clara's father.\n\nMr Heatherstone looked at the face and appeared much moved--\"Cover it\nup,\" said he, turning away; and then sitting down on a chair close to\nthe table--\n\n\"And how was this found?\" he said.\n\n\"I neither saw this person killed nor the robber you first saw, but I\nheard the report of the firearms at almost the same moment, and I\npresume that they fell by each other's hands.\"\n\nThe Intendant called his clerk, who had accompanied him, and desired him\nto get ready his writing materials, and then said--\n\n\"Edward Armitage, we will now take down your deposition as to what has\noccurred.\"\n\nEdward then commenced by stating \"that he was out in the forest and had\nlost his way, and was seeking his way home--\"\n\n\"You were out in the forest during the night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was.\"\n\n\"With your gun?\"\n\n\"I always carry my gun,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"In pursuit of game?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I was not.  I have never been out in pursuit of game during\nnight-time in my life.\"\n\n\"What were you then about?  You did not go out for nothing?\"\n\n\"I went out to commune with my own thoughts: I was restless, and I\nwandered about without knowing where I went, and that is the reason why\nI lost my way.\"\n\n\"And pray what may have excited you?\"\n\n\"I will tell you: I was over with Oswald Partridge the day before; you\nhad just arrived from London, and he gave me the news that King Charles\nhad been proclaimed in Scotland, and that news unsettled me.\"\n\n\"Well, proceed.\"\n\nEdward met with no more interruption in his narrative.  He stated\nbriefly all that had taken place, from the time he fell in with the\nrobbers till the winding up of the catastrophe.\n\nThe clerk took down all that Edward had stated, and then read it over to\nhim, to ascertain if he had written it down correctly, and then inquired\nof Edward if he could read and write.\n\n\"I should hope so,\" replied Edward, taking the pen and signing his name.\n\nThe clerk stared, and then said, \"People in your condition do not often\nknow how to read and write, Mr Forester, and therefore you need not be\noffended at the question.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Edward.  \"May I ask if my presence is considered\nany longer to be necessary?\"\n\n\"You stated that there was a boy in the house, young man,\" said the\nIntendant: \"what has become of him?\"\n\n\"He is removed to my cottage.\"\n\n\"Why did you do so?\"\n\n\"Because when his father died I promised to him that I would take care\nof his child; and I intend to keep my word.\"\n\n\"You had spoken with him, then, before he died?\" said the Intendant.\n\n\"Not so; it was all carried on by signs on his part, but it was as\nintelligible as if he spoke, and what I replied he well understood; and\nI really think I removed a great anxiety off his mind by giving him the\npromise.\"\n\nThe Intendant paused, and then said, \"I perceive that some articles have\nbeen removed--the bedding, for instance--have you taken anything away?\"\n\n\"I have removed bedding, for I had no bed to offer to the lad, and he\ntold me that the cottage and furniture belonged to his father; of course\nby his father's death it became his, and I felt that I was warranted in\nso doing.\"\n\n\"May I ask, did you remove any papers?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell; the lad packed up his own things; there were some boxes\nremoved, which were locked-up, and the contents are to me wholly\nunknown.  I could not leave the boy here in this scene of death, and I\ncould not well leave the property belonging to him to be at the mercy of\nany other plunderers of the forest.  I did as I considered right for the\nbenefit of the boy, and in accordance with the solemn promise which I\nmade to his father.\"\n\n\"Still the property should not have been removed.  The party who now\nlies dead there is a well-known Malignant.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, sir?\" interrupted Edward; \"did you recognise him\nwhen you saw the body?\"\n\n\"I did not say that I did,\" replied the Intendant.\n\n\"You either must have so done, sir,\" replied Edward, \"or you must have\nbeen aware that he was residing in this cottage: you have to choose\nbetween.\"\n\n\"You are bold, young man,\" replied the Intendant, \"and I will reply to\nyour observation.  I did recognise the party when I saw his face, and I\nknew him to be one who was condemned to death, and who escaped from\nprison a few days before the one appointed for his execution.  I heard\nsearch had been made for him, but in vain, and it was supposed that he\nhad escaped beyond the seas.  Now his papers may be the means of giving\nthe Parliament information against others as well as himself.\"\n\n\"And enable them to commit a few more murders,\" added Edward.\n\n\"Silence, young man; the authorities must not be spoken of in so\nirreverent a manner.  Are you aware that your language is treasonable?\"\n\n\"According to Act of Parliament, as at present constituted, it may be,\"\nreplied Edward; \"but as a loyal subject of King Charles the Second, I\ndeny it.\"\n\n\"I have no concern with your loyalty, young man, but I will not admit\nany language to be uttered in my presence against the ruling powers.\nThe inquest is over.  Let every one leave the house except Edward\nArmitage, to whom I would speak alone.\"\n\n\"Excuse me one moment, sir,\" said Edward, \"and I will return.\"\n\nEdward went out with the rest, and calling Humphrey aside, said to him,\n\"Contrive to slip away unperceived; here are the keys; haste to the\ncottage as fast as you can; look for all the papers you can find in the\npackages taken there; bury them and the iron chest in the garden, or\nanywhere where they cannot be discovered.\"\n\nHumphrey nodded, and turned away, and Edward re-entered the cottage.\n\nHe found the Intendant was standing over the corpse; he had removed the\ncoverlid, and was looking mournfully down on the face disfigured with\nblood.  Perceiving the entrance of Edward, he again took his seat at the\ntable, and after a pause said--\n\n\"Edward Armitage, that you have been brought up very superior to your\nstation in life is certain; and that you are loyal, bold, and resolute,\nis equally so; you have put me under an obligation which I never can\nrepay, even if you allowed me to exert myself in your behalf.  I take\nthis opportunity of acknowledging it; and now allow me to say that for\nthese times you are much too frank and impetuous.  This is no time for\npeople to give vent to their feelings and opinions.  Even I am as much\nsurrounded with spies as others, and am obliged to behave myself\naccordingly.  Your avowed attachment to the king's cause has prevented\nme from showing that more than cordiality that I really feel for you,\nand to which you are in every way entitled.\"\n\n\"I cannot conceal my opinions, sir; I was brought up in the house of a\nloyal cavalier, and never will be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Granted--why should you be?  But do you not yourself see that you do\nthe cause more harm than good by thus avowing your opinions when such\navowal is useless?  If any other man in the county, who is of your\nopinion, was to express himself, now that your cause is hopeless, as you\nhave done, the prisons would be crowded, the executions would be daily,\nand the cause would be in proportion weakened by the loss of the most\ndaring.  `Bide your time' is a good motto, and I recommend it to you.\nYou must feel that, however we may be at variance in our opinions,\nEdward Armitage, my hand and my authority never can be used against one\nto whom I am so indebted; and feeling this, you compel me in the\npresence of others to use a harshness and coldness towards you,\ncontrary--wholly contrary--to what, you may believe me when I say it, I\nreally feel for one who so nobly rescued my only child.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir, for your advice, which I feel to be good, and for\nyour good opinion, which I value.\"\n\n\"And which I feel that you deserve; and you shall have, young as you\nare, my confidence, which I know you will not abuse.  I did know this\nman who now lies dead before us, and I did also know that he was\nconcealed in this cottage: Major Ratcliffe was one of my earliest and\ndearest friends, and until this unhappy civil war, there never was any\ndifference between us, and even afterwards only in politics, and the\ncause we each espoused.  I knew, before I came down here as Intendant,\nwhere his place of concealment was, and have been most anxious for his\nsafety.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr Heatherstone, but each day I find more to make me like\nyou than I did the day before: at first I felt most inimical; now I only\nwonder how you can be leagued with the party you now are.\"\n\n\"Edward Armitage, I will now answer for myself and thousands more.  You\nare too young a man to have known the cause of the insurrection, or\nrather opposition to the unfortunate King Charles.  He attempted to make\nhimself absolute, and to wrest the liberties from the people of England;\nthat his warmest adherents will admit.  When I joined the party which\nopposed him, I little thought that matters would have been carried so\nfar as they have been; I always considered it lawful to take up arms in\ndefence of our liberties, but at the same time I equally felt that the\nperson of the king was sacred.\"\n\n\"I have heard so, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, and in truth; for never did any people strive more zealously to\nprevent the murder of the king--for murder it was--than my relative\nAshley Cooper and myself.  So much so, indeed, as to have incurred not\nonly the suspicion but the ill-will of Cromwell, who, I fear, is now\nmaking rapid advances towards that absolute authority for which the king\nhas suffered, and which he would now vest in his own person.  I\nconsidered that our cause was just; and, had the power been left in the\nhands of those who would have exercised it with discretion and\nmoderation, the king would even now have been on the throne, and the\nliberties of his subjects sacred; but it is easier to put a vast and\npowerful engine into motion than to stop it; and such has been the case\nin this unfortunate civil war.  Thousands who took an active part\nagainst the king will, when the opportunity is ripe, retrace their\nsteps; but I expect that we have much to suffer before that time will\ncome.  And now, Edward Armitage, I have said more to you than I have to\nany person breathing, except my own kinsman.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your confidence, sir, which not only will not be\nbetrayed, but will act as a warning to guide my future conduct.\"\n\n\"I meant it should.  Be no longer rash and careless in avowing your\nopinions.  You can do no good to the cause, and may do yourself much\nharm.  And now I must ask you another question, which I could not before\nthe other people.  You have surprised me by stating that Major Ratcliffe\nhad a son here: there must be some mistake, or the boy must be an\nimpostor.  He had a daughter, an only daughter, as I have; but he never\nhad a son.\"\n\n\"It is a mistake that I fell into, sir, by finding a boy here, as I\nstated to you at the inquest; and I considered it to be a boy until I\nbrought her home, and she then discovered to my sisters that she was a\ngirl dressed in boys' clothes.  I did not give that as explanation at\nthe inquest, as it was not necessary.\"\n\n\"I am right, then.  I must relieve you of that charge, Edward Armitage;\nshe shall be to me as a daughter, and I trust that you will agree with\nme, without any disparagement to your feelings, that my house will be a\nmore fit residence for her than your cottage.\"\n\n\"I will not prevent her going, if she wishes it, after your explanation\nand confidence, Mr Heatherstone.\"\n\n\"One thing more.  As I said to you before, Edward Armitage, I believe\nmany of these verderers, all of whom have been selected from the army,\nare spies upon me: I must therefore be careful.  You said that you were\nnot aware that there were any papers?\"\n\n\"I saw none, sir; but I suspect, from the many locked-up trunks and\nsmall boxes, that there may be; but when I went out with the others from\nthe inquest, I despatched my brother Humphrey to the cottage, advising\nhim to open all the locks and to remove any papers which he might find.\"\n\nThe Intendant smiled.\n\n\"Well, if such is the case, we have only to go to your cottage and make\nan examination.  We shall find nothing, and I shall have performed my\nduty.  I was not aware that your brother was here.  I presume it was the\nyoung man who walked with Oswald Partridge.\"\n\n\"It was, sir.\"\n\n\"By his appearance, I presume that he also was brought up at Arnwood?\"\n\n\"He was, sir, as well as I,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Well, then, I have but one word more to say,--recollect, if I appear\nharsh and severe in the presence of others, it is only assumed towards\nyou, and not real.  You understand that?\"\n\n\"I do, sir, and beg you will exercise your discretion.\"\n\nThe Intendant then went out and said to the party, \"It appears from what\nI can extract from this lad Armitage, that there are boxes which he\nremoved to his cottage; we will go there to see what they may contain.\nIt is now noon.  Have you any refreshment to offer us in your cottage,\nyoung man, when we arrive?\"\n\n\"I keep no hostelrie, sir,\" replied Edward, somewhat gloomily; \"my own\nlabour, and my brother's, is sufficient for the support of my own\nfamily, but no more.\"\n\n\"Let us move on; and two of you keep your eye upon that young man,\" said\nthe Intendant aside.\n\nThey then proceeded through the wood; the Intendant mounted his horse,\nand they set off for the cottage, where they arrived at about two\no'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\n\nHumphrey came out as soon as he perceived the Intendant and his party\napproaching, and whispered to Edward that all was safe.  The Intendant\ndismounted, and ordering everybody but his clerk to wait outside, was\nushered into the cottage by Edward.  Alice, Edith, and Pablo were in the\nroom; the two girls were not a little flushed and frightened by the\nunusual appearance of so large a body of strangers.\n\n\"These are my sisters, sir,\" said Edward.  \"Where is Clara, Alice?\"\n\n\"She is alarmed, and has gone into our bedroom.\"\n\n\"I hope you are not alarmed at my presence,\" said the Intendant, looking\nearnestly at the two girls.  \"It is my duty which obliges me to pay this\nvisit; but you have nothing to fear.  Now, Edward Armitage, you must\nproduce all the boxes and packages which you took from the cottage.\"\n\n\"I will, sir,\" replied Edward, \"and here are the keys.  Humphrey, do you\nand Pablo bring them out.\"\n\nThe boxes were brought out, opened, and examined by the Intendant and\nhis clerk, but of course no papers were found in them.\n\n\"I must now send in two of my people to search the house,\" said the\nIntendant.  \"Had you not better go to the little girl, that she may not\nbe frightened?\"\n\n\"I will go to her,\" said Alice.\n\nTwo of the people, assisted by the clerk, then searched the house; they\nfound nothing worthy of notice, except the weapons and armour which\nEdward had removed, and which he stated to the Intendant that he took\naway as valuable property belonging to the little girl.\n\n\"It is sufficient,\" said the Intendant to his clerk--\"undoubtedly there\nare no papers; but I must, before I go, interrogate this child, who has\nbeen removed thus; but she will be frightened, and I shall obtain no\nanswer from her if we are so many, so let everybody leave the cottage\nwhile I speak to her.\"\n\nThe clerk and the others left the cottage, and the Intendant desired\nEdward to bring Clara from the bedroom.  She came out, accompanied by\nand indeed clinging to Alice, for she was much alarmed.\n\n\"Come here, Clara,\" said the Intendant gently; \"you do not know perhaps\nthat I am your sincere friend; and now that your father is dead, I want\nyou to come and live with my daughter, who will be delighted to have you\nas a companion.  Will you go with me?  And I will take care of you and\nbe a father to you.\"\n\n\"I do not like to leave Alice and Edith; they treat me so kindly, and\ncall me sister,\" replied Clara, sobbing.\n\n\"I am sure they do, and you must be fond of them already; but still it\nis your duty to come with me; and if your father could speak to you now\nhe would tell you so.  I will not force you away, but remember, you are\nborn a lady, and must be brought up and educated as a lady, which cannot\nbe the case in this cottage, although they are very kind to you, and\nvery nice young people.  You do not recollect me, Clara, but you have\noften sat on my knee when you were a little girl, and when your father\nlived in Dorsetshire.  You recollect the great walnut-tree by the\nsitting-room window, which looked out in the garden, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Clara, with surprise.\n\n\"Yes, so do I too, and how you used to sit on my knee; and do you\nremember Jason, the big mastiff, and how you used to ride upon his\nback?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Clara, \"I do; but he died a long while ago.\"\n\n\"He did, when you were not more than six years old.  And now tell me,\nwhere did the old gardener bury him?\"\n\n\"Under the mulberry-tree,\" replied Clara.\n\n\"Yes, so he did, and I was there when poor Jason was buried.  You don't\nrecollect me.  But I will take off my hat, for I did not wear the same\ndress that I do now.  Now look, Clara, and see if you remember me.\"\n\nClara, who was no longer alarmed, looked on the Intendant's face, and\nthen said, \"You called my father Philip, and he used to call you\nCharles.\"\n\n\"You are right, my sweet one,\" replied the Intendant pressing Clara to\nhis bosom; \"I did so, and we were great friends.  Now, will you come\nwith me?  And I have a little girl, older than you by three or four\nyears, who will be your companion and love you dearly.\"\n\n\"May I come and see Alice and Edith sometimes?\"\n\n\"Yes, you shall; and she will come with you and make their acquaintance,\nif their brother will permit it.  I will not take you away now, dearest;\nyou shall remain here for a few days, and then we will come over and\nfetch you.  I will send Oswald Partridge over to let you know the day,\nEdward Armitage, when we will come for her.  Good-bye, dear Clara, and\ngood-bye, my little girls.  Humphrey Armitage, good-bye.  Who is this\nlad you have there?\"\n\n\"He is a gipsy whom Humphrey trapped in his pit-fall, sir, and we have\nsoon tamed him,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Well, then, Edward Armitage, good-bye,\" said the Intendant, extending\nhis hand to him; \"we must meet soon again.\"\n\nThe Intendant then went out of the cottage, and joined his people\noutside.  Edward went out after him; and as the Intendant mounted his\nhorse, he said very coldly to Edward, \"I shall keep a sharp look-out on\nyour proceedings, sir, depend upon it; I tell you so decidedly, so fare\nyou well.\"\n\nWith these words the Intendant put the spurs to his horse, and rode\naway.\n\n\"What made him speak so sharply to you, Edward?\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"Because he means kindly, but does not want other people to know it,\"\nreplied Edward.  \"Come in, Humphrey; I have much to tell you and much to\nsurprise you with.\"\n\n\"I have been surprised already,\" replied Humphrey.  \"How did this\nRoundhead know Clara's father so well?\"\n\n\"I will explain all before we go to bed,\" replied Edward; \"let us go in\nnow.\"\n\nThe two brothers had a long conversation that evening, in which Edward\nmade Humphrey acquainted with all that had passed between him and the\nIntendant.\n\n\"It's my opinion, Edward,\" said Humphrey, \"that he thinks matters have\nbeen carried too far, and that he is sorry that he belongs to the\nParliamentary party.  He finds out, now that it is too late, that he has\nallied himself with those who have very different feelings and motives\nthan his own, and has assisted to put power into the hands of those who\nhave not the scruples which he has.\"\n\n\"Yes; and in ridding themselves of one tyranny, as they considered it,\nthey have every prospect of falling into the hands of a greater tyrant\nthan before; for, depend upon it, Cromwell will assume the sovereign\npower, and rule this kingdom with a rod of iron.\"\n\n\"Well, many more are, I have no doubt, or soon will be, of his opinion;\nand the time will come, be it sooner or later, when the king will have\nhis own again.  They have proclaimed him in Scotland already.  Why does\nhe not come over and show himself?  His presence would, I think, induce\nthousands to flock to him,--I'm sure that it would me.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of this good intelligence with the Intendant, Edward, as\nit will not now be necessary for us to be so careful; we may go and come\nwhen we please.  I almost wish you could be persuaded to accept any\neligible offer he may make you.  Many no doubt are in office, and\nserving the present government, who have the same feelings as the\nIntendant, or even feelings as strong as your own.\"\n\n\"I cannot bear the idea of accepting anything from them or their\ninstruments, Humphrey; nor, indeed, could I leave my sisters.\"\n\n\"On that score you may make your mind easy;--Pablo and I are quite\nsufficient for the farm, or anything else we may want to do.  If you can\nbe more useful elsewhere, have no scruple in leaving us.  If the king\nwas to come over and raise an army, you would leave us, of course; and I\nsee no reason why, if an eligible offer is made you, you should not do\nit now.  You and your talents are thrown away in this forest, and you\nmight serve the king and the king's cause better by going into the world\nand watching the times than you ever can by killing his venison.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Edward, laughing, \"I do not much help his cause by\nkilling his deer, that must be admitted; all I shall say is this,--if\nanything is offered to me which I can accept without injury to my\nfeelings and my honour, I shall not decline it, provided that I may, by\naccepting it, prove of service to the king's cause.\"\n\n\"That is all I wish, Edward.  And now I think we had better go to bed.\"\n\nThe next day they dug up the iron chest and the box into which Humphrey\nhad put all the papers he had collected together.  Edward opened the\niron chest, and found in it a considerable quantity of gold in bags, and\nmany trinkets and jewels which he did not know the value of.  The papers\nhe did not open, but resolved that they should be given to the\nIntendant, for Edward felt that he could trust in him.  The other boxes\nand trunks were also opened and examined, and many other articles of\napparent value discovered.\n\n\"I should think all these jewels worth a great deal of money, Humphrey,\"\nsaid Edward; \"if so, all the better for poor little Clara.  I am sorry\nto part with her, although we have known her so short a time; she\nappears to be such an amiable and affectionate child.\"\n\n\"That she is; and certainly the handsomest little girl I ever saw.  What\nbeautiful eyes!  Do you know that on one of her journeys to Lymington\nshe was very nearly taken by a party of gipsies?  And by what Pablo can\nmake out, it would appear that it was by the party which he belonged\nto.\"\n\n\"I wonder at her father's permitting her to go alone such a distance.\"\n\n\"Her father could not do otherwise.  Necessity has no law.  He could\ntrust no other person, so he put her in boy's clothes that there might\nbe less risk.  Still, she must have been very intelligent to have done\nthe office.\"\n\n\"She is thirteen years old, although she is small,\" replied Edward.\n\"And intelligent she certainly is, as you may see by her countenance.\nWho would ever have imagined that our sisters would have been able to do\nwhat they are doing now?  It's an old saying, `We never know what we can\ndo till we try.'  By the bye, Humphrey, I met a famous herd of forest\nponies the other day, and I said to myself, `I wonder whether Humphrey\nwill be clever enough to take one of them, as he has the wild cattle?\nFor Billy is getting old, and we want a successor.'\"\n\n\"We want more than a successor to Billy, Edward, we want two more to\nhelp him--and I have the means of maintaining two more ponies if I could\ncatch them.\"\n\n\"I fear that you will never manage that, Humphrey,\" said Edward,\nlaughing.\n\n\"I know well what you mean,\" replied Humphrey: \"you wish to dare me to\nit--well, I won't be dared to anything, and I most certainly will try to\ncatch a pony or two; but I must think about it first, and when I have\narranged my plan in my mind I will then make the attempt.\"\n\n\"When I see the ponies in the yard I will believe it, Humphrey.  They\nare as wild as deer and as fleet as the wind, and you cannot catch them\nin a pit-fall.\"\n\n\"I know that, good brother; but all I can say is, that I will try what I\ncan do, and I can do no more--but not at present, for I am too busy.\"\n\nThree days after this conversation Oswald Partridge made his appearance,\nhaving been sent by the Intendant to tell Edward that he should come\nover on the following day to take away little Clara.\n\n\"And how is she to go?\" said Edward.\n\n\"He will bring a little nag for her, if she can ride--if she cannot, she\nmust ride in the cart which will come for the baggage.\"\n\n\"Clara, can you ride a horse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Clara, \"if it does not jump about too much.  I always\nrode one when I lived in Dorsetshire.\"\n\n\"This won't jump about, my little lady,\" said Oswald, \"for he is thirty\nyears old, I believe, and as steady as an old gentleman ought to be.\"\n\n\"I have had some conversation with Master Heatherstone,\" continued\nOswald to Edward.  \"He is much pleased with you, I can tell you.  He\nsaid, that in times like these he required young men like you about him;\nand that as you would not take the berth of verderer, he must find one\nbetter suited for you, for he said you were too good for such an\noffice.\"\n\n\"Many thanks to him for his good opinion,\" replied Edward; \"but I do not\nthink that he has any office in his gift which I can accept.\"\n\n\"So I thought, but I said nothing.  He again asked many questions\nrelative to old Jacob Armitage, and he pressed me very hard.  He said\nthat Humphrey was as much above his position in appearance as you were;\nbut as he was brought up at Arnwood he presumed that he had had the same\nadvantages.  And then he said--`But were his two sisters brought up at\nArnwood also?'  I replied that I believed not, although they were often\nthere, and were allowed to play with the children of the house.  He\nlooked at me steadfastly, as if he would read my thoughts, and then went\non writing.  I cannot help thinking that he has a suspicion that you are\nnot the grandchildren of old Jacob; but at the same time I do not think\nthat he has an idea who you really are.\"\n\n\"You must keep our secret, Oswald,\" replied Edward.  \"I have a very good\nopinion of the Intendant, I acknowledge; but I will trust nobody.\"\n\n\"As I hope for future mercy, sir, I never will divulge it until you bid\nme,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"I trust to you, Oswald, and so there's an end of the matter.  But, tell\nme, Oswald, what do they say about his taking charge of this little\ngirl?\"\n\n\"Why, they did begin to talk about it; but when he gave out that it was\nthe order of Parliament that the child should remain with him until\nfurther directions, of course they said nothing, for they dared not.  It\nseems that the Ratcliffe property is sequestrated, but not yet granted\nto any one; and the Parliament will most likely, as soon as she is old\nenough, give her as a wife, with the property, to one of their party,--\nthey have done it before now, as it secures the property under all\nchanges.\"\n\n\"I perceive,\" replied Edward.  \"When did you hear that the little girl\nwas to live with him?\"\n\n\"Not till yesterday morning; and it was not till the evening that we\nknew it was the order of Parliament.\"\n\nEdward did not think it right to tell Oswald what he knew, as it was a\nsecret confided to him by the Intendant, and therefore merely observed,\n\"I presumed that the child would not be left on our hands;\" and then the\nconversation dropped.\n\nAs Oswald had informed them, the Intendant made his appearance in the\nforenoon of the following day, and was accompanied by his daughter, who\nrode by his side.  A groom, on another horse, led a pony for Clara to\nride; and a cart for the luggage followed at some distance.  Edward went\nout to assist Miss Heatherstone to dismount, and she frankly extended\nher hand to him as she reached the ground.  Edward was a little\nsurprised as well as pleased at this condescension on her part towards a\nforester.\n\n\"You do me much honour, Mistress Patience,\" said he, bowing.\n\n\"I cannot forget that I owe my life to you, Master Armitage,\" replied\nPatience, \"and I cannot be too grateful.  May I request another favour\nof you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if it is in my power to do as you wish.\"\n\n\"It is this,\" said she, in a low voice: \"that you will not hastily\nreject any overtures which may be made to you by my father; that is all.\nAnd now let me go in and see your sisters, for my father has praised\nthem very much, and I wish to know them.\"\n\nEdward led the way into the cottage, and Patience followed him, while\nthe intendant was in conversation with Humphrey.  Edward, having\nintroduced his sisters and Clara, then went out to pay his respects to\nthe Intendant, who, now they were alone, was very candid towards both\nhim and Humphrey.\n\nEdward then told the Intendant that there was an iron chest with a good\ndeal of money in it, and jewels also, and many other articles of value\nin the other boxes.\n\n\"I fear, sir, that the cart will hardly hold all the goods.\"\n\n\"I do not intend to take away the heavy or more bulky articles, such as\nthe bedding, armour, etc.  I will only take Clara's own packages, and\nthe valuables and papers.  The remainder may stay here, as they can be\nof no use, till they are demanded from you.  Where is Oswald Partridge?\"\n\n\"In the stable with the horses, sir,\" replied Humphrey.\n\n\"Then, when the cart is loaded--and it had better be done by you while\nthe men are in the stable--Oswald shall take charge of it, and take the\nthings to my house.\"\n\n\"Here are the keys, sir,\" said Edward, presenting them.\n\n\"Good.  And now, Edward Armitage, that we are alone, I want to have a\nlittle conversation with you.  You are aware how much I feel indebted to\nyou for the service you have rendered me, and how anxious I am to show\nmy gratitude.  You are born for better things than to remain an obscure\nforester, and perhaps a deer-stalker.  I have now an offer to make to\nyou, which I trust, upon reflection, you will not refuse--and I say\nreflection, because I do not wish you to give an answer till you have\nwell reflected.  I know that you will not accept anything under the\npresent government, but a private situation you can raise no objection\nto; the more so as, so far from leaving your family, you will be more in\na position to protect them.  I am in want of a secretary, and I wish you\nto accept that office, to live entirely in my house, and to receive a\nhandsome salary for your services, which will not, I trust, be too\nheavy.  You will be near to your family here in the cottage, and be able\nto protect them and assist them; and what is more, you will mix with the\nworld and know what is going on, as I am in the confidence of the\ngovernment.  Of course I put implicit confidence in you, or I would not\noffer the situation.  But you will not be always down here: I have my\ncorrespondents and friends, to whom I shall have to send you\noccasionally on most trusty commissions.  You, I am sure, will suit me\nin every respect, and I hope you will undertake the post which I now\noffer you.  Give me no answer just now; consult with your brother, and\ngive the offer due consideration, and when you have made up your mind\nyou can let me know.\"\n\nEdward bowed; and the Intendant went into the cottage.\n\nEdward then assisted Humphrey and Pablo to get the iron chest on the\ncart, and covered it with the other packages and boxes, till the cart\nwas well loaded.  Leaving Pablo in charge till Oswald came from the\nstables, Edward and Humphrey then went into the cottage, where they\nfound a very social party; Patience Heatherstone having succeeded in\nmaking great friends with the other three girls, and the Intendant, to\nEdward's surprise, laughing and joking with them.  Alice and Edith had\nbrought out some milk, biscuits, and all the fruit that was ripe, with\nsome bread, a piece of cold salt beef, and a ham: and they were eating\nas well as talking.\n\n\"I have been praising your sisters' housekeeping, Armitage,\" said the\nIntendant.  \"Your farm appears to be very productive.\"\n\n\"Alice expected Miss Heatherstone, sir,\" replied Edward, \"and made an\nunusual provision.  You must not think that we live on such fare every\nday.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Intendant drily; \"on other days I daresay you have\nother fare.  I would almost make a bet that there is a pasty in the\ncupboard which you dare not show to the Intendant of the New Forest.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, sir, for once,\" replied Humphrey.  \"Alice knows well\nhow to make one, but she has not one just now.\"\n\n\"Well, I must believe you, Master Humphrey,\" replied the Intendant.\n\"And now, my dear child, we must think of going, for it is a long ride,\nand the little girl is not used to a horse.\"\n\n\"Mistress Alice, many thanks for your hospitality; and now, farewell.\nEdith, good-bye, dear.  Now, Clara, are you quite ready?\"\n\nThey all went out of the cottage.  The Intendant put Clara on the pony,\nafter she had kissed Alice and Edith.  Edward assisted Patience; and\nwhen she was mounted she said--\n\n\"I hope you will accept my father's offer--you will oblige me so much if\nyou do.\"\n\n\"I will give it every consideration it deserves,\" replied Edward.\n\"Indeed, it will depend more upon my brother than myself whether I\naccept it or not.\"\n\n\"Your brother is a very sensible young man, sir, therefore I have\nhopes,\" replied Patience.\n\n\"A quality which it appears you do not give me credit for, Miss\nHeatherstone.\"\n\n\"Not when pride or vindictive feelings obtain the mastery,\" replied she.\n\n\"Perhaps you will find that I am not quite so proud, or bear such\nill-will, as I did when I first saw your father, Miss Heatherstone; and\nsome allowance should be made, even if I did show such feelings, when\nyou consider that I was brought up at Arnwood.\"\n\n\"True--most true, Master Armitage.  I had no right to speak so boldly,\nespecially to you, who risked your own life to save the daughter of one\nof those Roundheads who treated the family of your protector so cruelly.\nYou must forgive me; and now, farewell!\"\n\nEdward bowed, and then turned to the Intendant, who had apparently been\nwaiting while the conversation was going on.  The Intendant bade him a\ncordial farewell; Edward shook Clara by the hand, and the cavalcade set\noff.  They all remained outside of the cottage till the party were at\nsome distance, and then Edward walked apart with Humphrey, to\ncommunicate to him the offer made by the Intendant, and ask his opinion.\n\n\"My opinion is made up, Edward; which is, that you should accept it\nimmediately.  You are under no obligation to the government, and you\nhave already conferred such an obligation upon the Intendant that you\nhave a right to expect a return.  Why stay here, when you can safely mix\nwith the world and know how things are going on?  I do not require your\nassistance, now that I have Pablo, who is more useful every day.  Do not\nlose such an opportunity of making a friend for yourself and all of us--\na protector, I may say; and who is, by what he has confided to you,\nanything but approving of the conduct of the present government.  He has\npaid you a deserved compliment by saying that he can and will trust you.\nYou must not refuse the offer, Edward--it would really be folly if you\ndid.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right, Humphrey; but I have been so accustomed to\nrange the forest--I am so fond of the chase--I am so impatient of\ncontrol or confinement, that I hardly know how to decide.  A secretary's\nlife is anything but pleasing to me, sitting at a table writing and\nreading all day long.  The pen is but a poor exchange for the\nlong-barrelled gun.\"\n\n\"It does more execution, nevertheless,\" replied Humphrey, \"if what I\nhave read is true.  But you are not to suppose that your life will be\nsuch a sedentary one.  Did he not say that he would have to trust you\nwith missions of importance?  Will you not, by going to London and other\nplaces, and mixing with people of importance, be preparing yourself for\nyour proper station in life, which I trust that one day you will resume?\nAnd does it follow that because you are appointed a secretary you are\nnot to go out in the forest and shoot a deer with Oswald, if you feel\ninclined--with this difference, that you may do it then without fear of\nbeing insulted or persecuted by such a wretch as that Corbould?  Do not\nhesitate any longer, my dear brother; recollect that our sisters ought\nnot to live this forest life as they advance in years--they were not\nborn for it, although they have so well conformed to it.  It depends\nupon you to release them eventually from their false position; and you\ncan never have such an opening as is now offered you, by one whose\ngratitude alone will make him anxious to serve you.\"\n\n\"You are right, Humphrey, and I will accept the offer; I can but return\nto you if things do not go on well.\"\n\n\"I thank you sincerely for your decision, Edward,\" replied Humphrey.\n\"What a sweet girl that Patience Heatherstone is!--I think I never saw\nsuch an enchanting smile!\"\n\nEdward thought of the smile she gave him when they parted but an hour\nago, and agreed with Humphrey, but he replied--\n\n\"Why, brother, you are really in love with the Intendant's daughter.\"\n\n\"Not so, my dear fellow; but I am in love with her goodness and\nsweetness of disposition, and so are Alice and Edith, I can tell you.\nShe has promised to come over and see them, and bring them flowers for\ntheir garden, and I hardly know what; and I am very glad of it, as my\nsisters have been buried here so long that they cannot but gain by her\ncompany now and then.  No!  I will leave Mistress Heatherstone for you;\nI am in love with little Clara.\"\n\n\"Not a bad choice, Humphrey: we both aspire high, for two young\nforesters, do we not?  However, they say `Every dog has his day,' and\nCromwell and his parliament may have theirs.  King Charles may be on his\nthrone again now, long before--you catch a forest pony, Humphrey.\"\n\n\"I hope he will, Edward: but recollect how you laughed at the idea of my\ncatching a cow--you may be surprised a second time.  `Where there is a\nwill there is a way,' the saying is.  But I must go and help Alice with\nthe heifer; she is not very quiet yet, and I see her going out with her\npail.\"\n\nThe brothers then parted, and Edward walked about, turning over in his\nmind the events of the day, and very often finding his thoughts broken\nin upon by sudden visions of Patience Heatherstone--and certainly the\nremembrance of her was to him the most satisfactory and pleasing portion\nof the prospect in his offered situation.\n\n\"I shall live with her, and be continually in her company,\" thought he.\n\"Well, I would take a less pleasing office if only for that.  She\nrequested me to accept it to oblige her, and I will do so.  How hasty we\nare in our conclusions!  When I first saw her father, what an aversion I\nfelt for him!  Now, the more I know him, the more I like him, nay,\nmore--respect him.  He said that the king wished to be absolute, and\nwrest the liberties from his subjects, and that they were justified in\nopposing him; I never heard that when at Arnwood.\"\n\n\"If so, was it lawful so to do?\"\n\n\"I think it was, but not to murder him; that I can never admit, nor does\nthe Intendant: on the contrary, he holds his murderers in as great\ndetestation as I do.  Why, then, we do not think far apart from one\nanother.  At the commencement, the two parties were--those who supported\nhim, not admitting that he was right, but too loyal to refuse to fight\nfor their king--and those who opposed, hoping to force him to do right;\nthe king for his supposed prerogatives, the people for their liberties.\nThe king was obstinate, the people resolute, until virulent warfare\ninflamed both parties, and neither would listen to reason; and the\npeople gained the upper hand, they wreaked their vengeance, instead of\nlooking to the dictates of humanity and justice.  How easy it had been\nto have deposed him, and have sent him beyond the seas!  Instead of\nwhich they detained him a prisoner and then murdered him.  The\npunishment was greater than the offence, and dictated by malice and\nrevenge; it was a diabolical act, and will soil the page of our nation's\nhistory.\"  So thought Edward, as he paced before the cottage, until he\nwas summoned in by Pablo to their evening meal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\n\n\"Edward,\" said Edith, \"scold Pablo; he has been ill-treating my poor\ncat; he is a cruel boy.\"  Pablo laughed.  \"See, Edward, he's laughing:\nput him in the pit-fall again, and let him stay there till he says he is\nsorry.\"\n\n\"I very sorry now Missy Edith, but cat bite me,\" said Pablo.\n\n\"Well, if pussy did, it didn't hurt you much; and what did I tell you\nthis morning out of the Bible?--that you must forgive them who behave\nill to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Missy Edith, you tell me all that, and so I do; I forgive pussy\n'cause she bite me, but I kick her for it.\"\n\n\"That's not forgiveness, is it, Edward?  You should have forgiven it at\nonce, and not kicked it at all.\"\n\n\"Miss Edith, when pussy bite me, pussy hurt me, make me angry, and I\ngive her a kick; then I think what you tell me, and I do as you tell me.\nI forgive pussy with all my heart.\"\n\n\"I think you must forgive Pablo, Edith,\" said Edward, \"if it is only to\nset him a good example.\"\n\n\"Well, I will this time; but if he kicks pussy again, he must be put in\nthe pit-fall--mind that, Pablo.\"\n\n\"Yes, Missy Edith, I go into pit-fall, and then you cry, and ask Master\nEdward to take me out.  When you have me put in pit-fall then you not\ngood Christian, 'cause you not forgive; when you cry and take me out,\nthen you good Christian once more.\"\n\nBy this conversation it will appear to the reader that they had been\ntrying to impress Pablo with the principles of the Christian religion--\nand such was the case; Edith having been one of the most active in the\nendeavour, although very young for a missionary.  However, Alice and\nHumphrey had been more successful, and Pablo was now beginning to\ncomprehend what they had attempted to instil, and was really progressing\nevery day.\n\nEdward remained at the cottage, expecting to hear some message from the\nIntendant.  He was right in his conjecture, for, on the third day,\nOswald Partridge came ever to say that the Intendant would be happy to\nsee him, if he could make it convenient to go over; which Edward\nassented to do on the following day.  Oswald had ridden over on a pony:\nEdward arranged to take Billy and return with him.  They started early\nthe next morning, and Edward asked Oswald if he knew why the Intendant\nhad sent for him.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Oswald; \"but I think, from what I heard Miss\nPatience say, it is to offer you some situation, if you could be\nprevailed upon to accept it.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Edward; \"he offers me the post of secretary.  What\ndo you think?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I think I would accept it; at all events, I would take it on\ntrial--there can be no harm done: if you do not like it you can only go\nback to the cottage again.  One thing I am sure of, which is, that\nMaster Heatherstone will make it as pleasant to you as he can, for he is\nmost anxious to serve you.\"\n\n\"That I really believe,\" replied Edward; \"and I have, pretty well, made\nup my mind to accept the office.  It is a post of confidence, and I\nshall know all that is going on, which I cannot do while I am secluded\nin the forest; and depend upon it, we shall have stirring news.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think that the king will come over?\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"I feel certain of it, Oswald; and that is the reason why I want to be\nwhere I can know all that is going on.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it is my opinion that the king will come over, as well as\nyours; yet I think at present he stands but a poor chance; Master\nHeatherstone knows more on that score than any one, I should think; but\nhe is very close.\"\n\nThe conversation then changed, and after a ride of eight hours they\narrived at the Intendant's house.  Edward gave Billy into Oswald's\ncharge, and knocked at the door.  Phoebe let him in, and asked him into\nthe sitting-room, where he found the Intendant alone.\n\n\"Edward Armitage, I am glad to see you; and shall be still more so if I\nfind that you have made up your mind to accept my proposition.  What is\nyour reply?\"\n\n\"I am very thankful to you for the offer, sir,\" replied Edward; \"and\nwill accept it if you think that I am fitted for it, and if I find that\nI am equal to it: I can but give it a trial, and leave if I find it too\narduous or too irksome.\"\n\n\"Too arduous it shall not be--that shall be my concern; and too irksome\nI hope you will not find it.  My letters are not so many but that I\ncould answer them myself, were it not that my eyes are getting weak, and\nI wish to save them as much as possible.  You will therefore have to\nwrite chiefly what I shall dictate; but it is not only for that I\nrequire a person that I can confide in.  I very often shall send you to\nLondon instead of going myself, and to that I presume you will have no\nobjection?\"\n\n\"Certainly none, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is no use saying any more just now; you will have a\nchamber in this house, and you will live with me, and at my table\naltogether.  Neither shall I say anything just now about remuneration,\nas I am convinced that you will be satisfied.  All that I require now,\nis to know the day that you will come, that everything may be ready.\"\n\n\"I suppose, sir, I must change my attire?\" replied Edward, looking at\nhis forester's dress; \"that will hardly accord with the office of\nsecretary.\"\n\n\"I agree with you that it will be better to keep that dress for your\nforest excursions, as I presume you will not altogether abandon them,\"\nreplied the Intendant.  \"You can provide yourself with a suit at\nLymington.  I will furnish you the means.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir, I have means, much more than sufficient,\" replied\nEdward, \"although not quite so wealthy as little Clara appeared to be.\"\n\n\"Wealthy, indeed!\" replied the Intendant.  \"I had no idea that poor\nRatcliffe possessed so much ready money and jewels.  Well, then, this is\nWednesday; can you come over next Monday?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Edward, \"I see no reason to the contrary.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that is settled, and I suppose you would like to see your\naccommodation.  Patience and Clara are in the next room.  You can join\nthem, and you will make my daughter very happy by telling her that you\nare to become a resident with us.  You will of course dine with us\nto-day, and sleep here to-night.\"\n\nMr Heatherstone then opened the door, and saying to his daughter,\n\"Patience, my dear, I leave you to entertain Edward Armitage till\ndinner-time,\" he ushered Edward in, and closed the door again.  Clara\nran up to Edward as soon as he went in; and having kissed him, Edward\nthen took Patience's offered hand.\n\n\"Then you have consented?\" said Patience inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes, I could not refuse such kindness,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"And when do you come?\"\n\n\"On Monday night, if I can be ready by that time.\"\n\n\"Why, what have you to get ready?\" said Clara.\n\n\"I must not appear in a forester's dress, my little Clara.  I can wear\nthat with a gun in my hand, but not with a pen: so I must go to\nLymington and see what a tailor can do for me.\"\n\n\"You will feel as strange in a secretary's dress as I did in boys'\nclothes,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Perhaps I may,\" said Edward; although he felt that such would not be\nthe case, having been accustomed to much better clothes when at Arnwood\nthan what were usually worn by secretaries; and this remembrance brought\nback Arnwood in its train, and Edward became silent and pensive.\n\nPatience observed it, and after a time said--\"You will be able to watch\nover your sisters, Mr Armitage, as well here, almost, as if you were at\nthe cottage.  You do not return till to-morrow?  How did you come over?\"\n\n\"I rode the pony Billy, Mistress Patience.\"\n\n\"Why do you call her Mistress Patience, Edward?\" said Clara.  \"You call\nme Clara: why not call her Patience?\"\n\n\"You forget that I am only a forester, Clara,\" replied Edward, with a\ngrave smile.\n\n\"No, you are a secretary _now_,\" replied Clara.\n\n\"Mistress Patience is older than you by several years.  I call you\nClara, because you are but a little girl; but I must not take that\nliberty with Mistress Heatherstone.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Patience?\" said Clara.\n\n\"I certainly do not think that it would be a liberty in a person, after\nbeing well acquainted with me, to call me Patience,\" replied she;\n\"especially when that person lives in the house with us, eats and\nassociates with us as one of the family, and is received on an equality;\nbut I daresay, Clara, that Master Armitage will be guided by his own\nfeelings, and act as he considers to be proper.\"\n\n\"But you give him leave, and then it is proper,\" replied Clara.\n\n\"Yes, if he gave himself leave, Clara,\" said Patience.  \"But we will now\nshow him his own room, Clara,\" continued Patience, wishing to change the\nsubject of conversation.\n\n\"Will you follow us, sir?\" said Patience, with a little mock ceremony.\n\nEdward did so without replying, and was ushered into a large airy room,\nvery neatly furnished.\n\n\"This is your future lodging,\" said Patience; \"I hope you will like it.\"\n\n\"Why, he never saw anything like it before,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Yes I have, Clara,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"Where did you?\"\n\n\"At Arnwood; the apartments were on a much larger scale.\"\n\n\"Arnwood!  Oh yes, I have heard my father speak of it,\" said Clara, with\nthe tears starting in her eyes at his memory.  \"Yes, it was burnt down,\nand all the children burnt to death!\"\n\n\"So they say, Clara; but I was not there when it was burnt.\"\n\n\"Where were you then?\"\n\n\"I was at the cottage where I now live.\"  Edward turned round to\nPatience, and perceived that her eyes were fixed upon him, as if she\nwould have read his thoughts.  Edward smiled, and said--\n\n\"Do you doubt what I say?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\" said she, \"I have no doubt that you were at the cottage at\nthe time; but I was thinking that if the apartments at Arnwood were more\nsplendid, those at your cottage are less comfortable.  You have been\nused to better and to worse, and therefore will, I trust, be content\nwith these.\"\n\n\"I trust I have shown no signs of discontent.  I should indeed be\ndifficult to please, if an apartment like this did not suit me.\nBesides, allow me to observe, that although I stated that the apartments\nat Arnwood were on a grander scale, I never said that I had ever been a\npossessor of one of them.\"\n\nPatience smiled and made no reply.\n\n\"Now that you know your way to your apartment, Master Armitage, we will,\nif you please, go back to the sitting-room,\" said she.  As they were\ngoing back into the sitting-room she said--\"When you come over on\nMonday, you will, I presume, bring your clothes in a cart?  I ask it,\nbecause I promised some flowers and other things to your sisters, which\nI can send back by the cart.\"\n\n\"You are very kind to think of them, Mistress Patience,\" replied Edward;\n\"they are fond of flowers, and will be much pleased with possessing\nany.\"\n\n\"You sleep here to-night, I think my father said?\" inquired Patience.\n\n\"He did make the proposal, and I shall gladly avail myself of it, as I\nam not to trust to Phoebe's ideas of comfort this time,\" said Edward,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Yes, that was a cross action of Phoebe's; and I can tell you, Master\nArmitage, that she is ashamed to look you in the face ever since; but\nhow fortunate for me that she was cross, and turned you out as she did!\nYou must forgive her, as she was the means of your performing a noble\naction; and I must forgive her, as she was the means of my life being\nsaved.\"\n\n\"I have no feeling except kindness towards Phoebe,\" replied Edward;\n\"indeed I ought to feel grateful to her!  For if she had not given me so\nbad a bed that night, I never should have been so comfortably lodged as\nit is proposed that I shall be now.\"\n\n\"I hope you are hungry, Edward,\" said Clara; \"dinner is almost ready.\"\n\n\"I daresay I shall eat more than you do, Clara.\"\n\n\"So you ought, a great big man like you.  How old are you, Edward?\" said\nClara; \"I am thirteen; Patience is past sixteen: now how old are you?\"\n\n\"I am not yet eighteen, Clara; so that I can hardly be called a man.\"\n\n\"Why, you are as tall as Mr Heatherstone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe I am.\"\n\n\"And can't you do everything that a man can do?\"\n\n\"I really don't know; but I certainly shall always try so to do.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you must be a man.\"\n\n\"Clara, if it pleases you, I will be a man.\"\n\n\"Here comes Mr Heatherstone, so I know dinner is ready; is it not,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child, it is,\" replied Mr Heatherstone, kissing Clara; \"so let\nus all go in.\"\n\nMr Heatherstone, as was usual at that time with the people to whose\nparty he ostensibly belonged, said a grace before meat, of considerable\nlength, and then they sat down to table.  As soon as the repast was over\nMr Heatherstone returned to his study, and Edward went out to find\nOswald Partridge, with whom he remained the larger portion of the\nafternoon, going to the kennel and examining the dogs, and talking of\nmatters connected with the chase.\n\n\"I have not two men that can stalk a deer,\" observed Oswald; \"the men\nappointed here as verderers and keepers have not one of them been\nbrought up to the business.  Most of them are men who have been in the\narmy, and I believe have been appointed to these situations to get rid\nof them, because they were troublesome; and they are anything but good\ncharacters; the consequence is, that we kill but few deer, for I have so\nmuch to attend to here, as none of them know their duties, that I can\nseldom take my own gun out.  I stated so to the Intendant, and he said,\nthat if you accepted an offer he had made you, and came over here, we\nshould not want venison; so it is clear that he does not expect you to\nhave your pen always in your hand.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" replied Edward; \"depend upon it his own table,\nat all events, shall be well supplied.  Is not that the fellow Corbould,\nwho is leaning against the wall?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is to be discharged, as he cannot walk well, and the surgeon\nsays he will always limp.  He owes you a grudge, and I am glad that he\nis going away, for he is a dangerous man.  But the sun is setting, Mr\nEdward, and supper will soon be on the table; you had better go back to\nthe house.\"\n\nEdward bade Oswald farewell, and returned to the Intendant's, and found\nthat Oswald was correct, as supper was being placed on the table.\n\nSoon after supper, Phoebe and the men-servants were summoned, and\nprayers offered up by the Intendant; after which Patience and Clara\nretired.  Edward remained in conversation with the Intendant for about\nan hour, and then was conducted by him to his room, which had already\nbeen shown to him by Patience.\n\nEdward did not sleep much that night.  The novelty of his situation--the\nnovelty of his prospects, and his speculations thereon, kept him awake\ntill near morning; he was, however, up in good time, and having assisted\nat the morning prayers, and afterwards eaten a most substantial\nbreakfast, he took his leave of the Intendant and the two girls, and set\noff on his return to the cottage, having renewed his promise of coming\non the following Monday to take up his abode with them.  Billy was\nfresh, and cantered gaily along, so that Edward was back early in the\nafternoon, and once more welcomed by his household.  He stated to\nHumphrey all that had occurred, and Humphrey was much pleased at Edward\nhaving accepted the offer of the Intendant.  Alice and Edith did not\nquite so much approve of it, and a few tears were shed at the idea of\nEdward leaving the cottage.  The next day, Edward and Humphrey set off\nfor Lymington, with Billy in the cart.\n\n\"Do you know, Edward,\" said Humphrey, \"what I am going to try and\npurchase?  I will tell you--as many kids as I can, or goats and kids, I\ndon't care which.\"\n\n\"Why, have you not stock enough, already?  You will this year have four\ncows in milk, and you have two cow calves bringing up.\"\n\n\"That is very true, but I do not intend to have goats for their milk,\nbut simply for eating in lieu of mutton.  Sheep I cannot manage, but\ngoats, with a little hay in winter, will do well, and will find\nthemselves in the forest all the year round.  I won't kill any of the\nfemales for the first year or two, and after that I expect we shall have\na flock sufficient to meet any demand upon it.\"\n\n\"It is not a bad idea, Humphrey; they will always come home, if you have\nhay for them during the winter.\"\n\n\"Yes, and a large shed for them to lie in when the snow is on the\nground.\"\n\n\"Now I recollect, when we used to go to Lymington, I saw a great many\ngoats, and I have no doubt that they are to be purchased.  I will soon\nascertain that for you, from the landlord of the hostelrie,\" replied\nEdward.\n\n\"We will drive there first, as I must ask him to recommend me a tailor.\"\n\nOn their arrival at Lymington, they went straight to the hostelrie, and\nfound the landlord at home.  He recommended a tailor to Edward, who sent\nfor him to the inn, and was measured by him for a plain suit of dark\ncloth.  Edward and Humphrey then went out, as Edward had to procure\nboots, and many other articles of dress to correspond with the one which\nhe was about to assume.\n\n\"I am most puzzled about a hat, Humphrey,\" said Edward: \"I hate those\nsteeple-crowned hats, worn by the Roundheads; yet the hat and feather is\nnot proper for a secretary.\"\n\n\"I would advise you to submit to wear the steeple-crowned hats,\nnevertheless,\" said Humphrey.  \"Your dress, as I consider, is a sort of\ndisgrace to a cavalier born, and the heir of Arnwood; why not,\ntherefore, take its hat as well?  As secretary to the Intendant, you\nshould dress like him; if not, you may occasion remarks, especially when\nyou travel on his concerns.\"\n\n\"You are right, Humphrey, I must not do things by halves; and unless I\nwear the hat I might be suspected.\"\n\n\"I doubt if the Intendant wears it for any other reason,\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"At all events, I will not go to the height of the fashion,\" replied\nEdward, laughing.  \"Some of the hats are not quite so tall as the\nothers.\"\n\n\"Here is the shop for the hat and for the sword-belt.\"\n\nEdward chose a hat and a plain sword-belt, paid for them, and desired\nthe man to carry them to the hostelrie.\n\nWhile all these purchases on the part of Edward, and many others by\nHumphrey, such as nails, saws, tools, and various articles which Alice\nrequired for the household, were being gathered together, the landlord\nhad sent out to inquire for the goats, and found out at what price they\nwere to be procured.  Humphrey left Edward to put away their goods into\nthe cart, while he went out a second time, to see the goats; with the\nman who had them for sale he made an agreement for a male and three\nfemales with two kids each at their sides, and ten more female kids\nwhich had just been weaned.  The man engaged to drive them from\nLymington, as far as the road went into the forest, on the following\nday; when Humphrey would meet him, pay him his money, and drive them to\nthe cottage, which would only be three miles from the place agreed upon.\nHaving settled that satisfactorily, he returned to Edward, who was all\nready, and they returned home.\n\n\"We have dipped somewhat into the bag to-day, Edward,\" said Humphrey;\n\"but the money is well spent.\"\n\n\"I think so, Humphrey, but I have no doubt that I shall be able to\nreplace the money very soon, as the Intendant will pay me for my\nservices.  The tailor has promised the clothes on Saturday without fail;\nso that you or I must go for them.\"\n\n\"I will go, Edward; my sisters will wish you to stay with them now, as\nyou are so soon to leave them; and I will take Pablo with me, that he\nmay know his way to the town; and I will show him where to buy things,\nin case he goes there by himself.\"\n\n\"It appears to me to have been a most fortunate thing your having caught\nPablo as you did, Humphrey, for I do not well know how I could have left\nyou if you had not.\"\n\n\"At all events I can do much better without you than I should have\ndone,\" replied Humphrey; \"although I think now that I could get on by\nmyself; but still, Edward, you know we cannot tell what a day may bring\nforth, and I might fall sick, or something happen which might prevent my\nattending to anything; and then, without you or Pablo, everything might\nhave gone to wrack and ruin.  Certainly, when we think how we were left,\nby the death of old Jacob, to our own resources, we have much to thank\nGod for in having got on so well.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, and also that it has pleased Heaven to grant us all\nsuch good health.  However, I shall be close at hand if you want me, and\nOswald will always call and see how you get on.\"\n\n\"I hope you will manage that he calls once a week.\"\n\n\"I will if I can, Humphrey, for I shall be just as anxious as you are to\nknow if all goes on well.  Indeed, I shall insist upon coming over to\nyou once a fortnight; and I hardly think the Intendant will refuse me--\nindeed I am sure that he will not.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" replied Humphrey.  \"I am certain that he wishes us all well,\nand has, in a measure, taken us under his protection; but, Edward,\nrecollect, I shall never kill any venison after this, and so you may\ntell the Intendant.\"\n\n\"I will, and that will be an excuse for him to send some over, if he\npleases.  Indeed, as I know I shall be permitted to go out with Oswald,\nit will be hard if a stray buck does not find its way to the cottage.\"\n\nThus did they continue talking over matters till they arrived at the\ncottage.  Alice came out to them, saying to Humphrey--\"Well, Humphrey,\nhave you brought my geese and ducks?\"\n\nHumphrey had forgotten them, but he replied, \"You must wait till I go to\nLymington again on Saturday, Alice, and then I hope to bring them with\nme.  As it is, look how poor Billy is loaded.  Where's Pablo?\"\n\n\"In the garden.  He has been working there all day, and Edith is with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well then we will unload the cart, while you get us something to eat,\nAlice, for we are not a little hungry, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I have some rabbit stew on the fire, Humphrey, all ready for you, and\nyou will find it very good.\"\n\n\"Nothing I like better, my dear girl.  Pablo won't thank me for bringing\nthis home,\" continued Humphrey, taking the long saw out of the cart; \"he\nwill have to go to the bottom of the pit again, as soon as the pit is\nmade.\"\n\nThe cart was soon unloaded, Billy taken out and turned out to feed, and\nthen they went in to supper.\n\nHumphrey was off the next morning, with Pablo, at an early hour, to meet\nthe farmer of whom he had purchased the goats and kids.  He found them\npunctual to the time, at the place agreed upon; and being satisfied with\nthe lot, paid the farmer his money and drove them home through the\nforest.\n\n\"Goat very good, kid better; always eat kid in Spain,\" said Pablo.\n\n\"Were you born in Spain, Pablo?\"\n\n\"Not sure, but I think so.  First recollect myself in that country.\"\n\n\"Do you recollect your father?\"\n\n\"No; never see him.\"\n\n\"Did your mother never talk about him?\"\n\n\"Call her mother, but think no mother at all.  Custom with Gitanas.\"\n\n\"Why did you call her mother?\"\n\n\"'Cause she feed me when little, beat me when I get big.\"\n\n\"All mothers do that.  What made you come to England?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I hear people say, Plenty of money in England--plenty\nto eat--plenty to drink; bring plenty money back to Spain.\"\n\n\"How long have you been in England?\"\n\n\"One, two, three year; yes, three year and a bit.\"\n\n\"Which did you like best, England or Spain?\"\n\n\"When with my people, like Spain best; warm sun--warm night.  England,\nlittle sun, cold night, much rain, snow, and air always cold; but now I\nlive with you, have warm bed, plenty victuals, like England best.\"\n\n\"But when you were with the gipsies, they stole everything, did they\nnot?\"\n\n\"Not steal everything,\" replied Pablo, laughing, \"sometimes take and no\npay when nobody there; farmer look very sharp--have big dog.\"\n\n\"Did you ever go out to steal?\"\n\n\"Make me go out.  Not bring back something, beat me very hard; suppose\nfarmer catch me, beat hard too nothing but beat, beat, beat.\"\n\n\"Then they obliged you to steal?\"\n\n\"Suppose bring nothing home, first beat, and then not have to eat for\none, two, three days.  How you like that, Master Humphrey?  I think you\nsteal after no victuals for three days?\"\n\n\"I should hope not,\" replied Humphrey, \"although I have never been so\nseverely punished; and I hope, Pablo, you will never steal any more.\"\n\n\"Why steal any more?\" replied Pablo.  \"I not like to steal; but because\nhungry I steal.  Now I never hungry, always have plenty to eat; no one\nbeat me now; sleep warm all night.  Why I steal, then?  No, Master\nHumphrey, I never steal more, 'cause I have no reason why, and 'cause\nMissy Alice and Missy Edith tell me how the good God up there say must\nnot steal.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you give that as a reason, Pablo,\" replied Humphrey,\n\"as it proves that my sisters have not been teaching you in vain.\"\n\n\"Like to hear Missy Alice talk; she talk grave.  Missy Edith talk too,\nbut she laugh very much; very fond Missy Edith, very happy little girl;\njump about just like one of these kids we drive home; always merry.\nHah!  See cottage now; soon get home, Massa Humphrey.  Missy Edith like\nsee kids very much.  Where we put them?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\n\n\"We will put them into the yard for the present; I mean that Holdfast\nshall take charge of them by and by.  I will soon teach him.\"\n\n\"Yes, he take charge of coat, or anything I tell him, why not take\ncharge of goats?  Clever dog, Holdfast.  Massa Humphrey, you think Massa\nEdward take away both his dogs, Smoker and Watch?  I say better not take\npuppy.  Take Smoker, and leave puppy.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Pablo.  We ought to have two dogs here.  I will speak\nto my brother.  Now run forward and open the gate of the yard, and throw\nthem some hay, Pablo, while I go and call my sisters.\"\n\nThe flock of goats was much admired, and the next morning was driven out\ninto the forest to feed, attended by Pablo and Holdfast.  When it was\ndinner-time, Pablo drove the flock near to the cottage, telling the dog\nto mind the goats.  The sensible animal remained at once with them until\nPablo's return from dinner; and it may be as well to observe here that\nin a few days the dog took charge of them altogether, driving them home\nto the yard every evening; and as soon as they were put into the yard\nthe dog had his supper, and he took good care, therefore, not to be too\nlate.  To return to our narrative.\n\nOn Saturday Humphrey and Pablo went to Lymington to bring home Edward's\nclothes, and Humphrey made Pablo acquainted with all that he wanted him\nto know, in case it might be necessary to send him there alone.\n\nEdward remained with his sisters, as he was to leave them on the Monday.\n\nSunday was passed as usual; they read the service at old Armitage's\ngrave, and afterwards they walked in the forest; for Sunday was the only\nday on which Alice could find time to leave her duties in the cottage.\nThey were not more grave than usual at the idea of Edward's leaving\nthem, but they kept up their spirits, as they were aware that it was for\nthe advantage of all.\n\nOn Monday morning, Edward, to please his sisters, put on his new\nclothes, and put his forester's dress in the bundle with his linen.\nAlice and Edith thought he looked very well in them, and said that it\nreminded them of the days of Arnwood.  The fact was that Edward appeared\nas he was--a gentleman born; that could not well be concealed under a\nforester's dress, and in his present attire it was undeniable.  After\nbreakfast Billy was harnessed and brought to the cottage-door.  Edward's\nlinen was put in the cart, and, as he had agreed with Humphrey, he took\nonly Smoker with him, leaving the puppy at the cottage.  Pablo went with\nhim to bring back the cart.  Edward kissed his sisters, who wept at the\nidea of his leaving them, and shaking hands with Humphrey set off to\ncross the forest.\n\n\"Who would ever have believed this?\" thought Edward, as he drove across\nthe forest; \"that I should put myself under the roof and under the\nprotection of a Roundhead--one in outward appearance, and in the opinion\nof the world at least, if he is not so altogether in opinion.  There is\nsurely some spell upon me, and I almost feel as if I were a traitor to\nmy principles.  Why I know not, I feel a regard for that man, and a\nconfidence in him.  And why should I not?  He knows my principles, my\nfeelings against his party, and he respects them.  Surely he cannot wish\nto gain me over to his party; that were indeed ridiculous--a young\nforester--a youth unknown.  No, he would gain nothing by that, for I am\nnobody.  It must be from good-will, and no other feeling.  I have\nobliged him in the service I rendered his daughter, and he is grateful.\"\nPerhaps, had Edward put the question to himself, \"Should I have been on\nsuch friendly terms with the Intendant--should I have accepted his\noffer, if there had been no Patience Heatherstone?\" he might then have\ndiscovered what was the \"spell upon him\" which had rendered him so\ntractable; but of that he had no idea.  He only felt that his situation\nwould be rendered more comfortable by the society of an amiable and\nhandsome girl, and he inquired no further.\n\nHis reverie was broken by Pablo, who appeared tired of holding his\ntongue, and said, \"Massa Edward, you not like leave home--you think very\nmuch.  Why you go there?\"\n\n\"I certainly do not like to leave home, Pablo, for I am very fond of my\nbrother and sisters; but we cannot always do as we wish in this world,\nand it is for their sakes, more than from my own inclinations, that I\nhave done so.\"\n\n\"Can't see what good you do Missy Alice and Missy Edith 'cause you go\naway.  How it possible do good, and not with them?  Suppose bad\naccident, and you away, how you do good.  Suppose bad accident, and you\nat cottage, then you do good.  I think, Massa Edward, you very foolish.\"\n\nEdward laughed at this blunt observation of Pablo's, and replied, \"It is\nvery true, Pablo, that I cannot watch over my sisters, and protect them\nin person when I am away; but there are reasons why I should go,\nnevertheless, and I may be more useful to them by going than by\nremaining with them.  If I did not think so I would not leave them.\nThey know nobody, and have no friends in the world.  Suppose anything\nwas to happen to me.  Suppose both Humphrey and I were to die--for you\nknow that we never know how soon that event may take place--who would\nthere be to protect my poor sisters, and what would become of them?  Is\nit not, therefore, wise that I should procure friends for them, in case\nof accident, who would look after them and protect them?  And it is my\nhope, that by leaving them now, I shall make powerful and kind friends\nfor them.  Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see now; you think more than me, Massa Edward.  I say just now,\nyou foolish; I say now, Pablo great fool.\"\n\n\"Besides, Pablo, recollect that I never would have left them as long as\nthere was only Humphrey and me to look after them, because an accident\nmight have happened to one of us; but when you came to live with us, and\nI found what a good clever boy you were, and that you were fond of us\nall, I then said, `Now I can leave my sisters, for Pablo shall take my\nplace, and assist Humphrey to do what is required, and to take care of\nthem.'  Am I not right, Pablo?\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Edward,\" replied Pablo, taking hold of Edward's wrist, \"you\nquite right.  Pablo does love Missy Alice, Missy Edith, Massa Humphrey,\nand you, Massa Edward; he love you all very much indeed; he love you so\nmuch that he die for you!  Can do no more.\"\n\n\"That is what I really thought of you, Pablo, and yet I am glad to hear\nit from your own mouth.  If you had not come to live with us, and had\nnot proved so faithful, I could not have left to benefit my sisters; but\nyou have induced me to leave, and they have to thank you if I am able to\nbe of any service to them.\"\n\n\"Well, Massa Edward, you go; never mind us, we make plenty of work; do\neverything all the same as you.\"\n\n\"I think you will, Pablo, and that is the reason why I have agreed to go\naway.  But, Pablo, Billy is growing old, and you will want some more\nponies.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Edward, Massa Humphrey talk to me about ponies last night,\nand say, plenty in the forest.  Ask me if I think us able catch them.  I\nsay yes, catch one, two, twenty, suppose want them.\"\n\n\"Ah!  How will you do that, Pablo?\"\n\n\"Massa Edward, you tell Massa Humphrey no possible, so I no tell you\nhow,\" replied Pablo, laughing.  \"Some day you come see us, see five\nponies in the stable.  Massa Humphrey and I, we talk about, find out\nhow; you see.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I shall ask no more questions, Pablo; and when I see the\nponies in the stable then I'll believe it, and not before.\"\n\n\"Suppose you want big horse for ride, catch big horse, Massa Edward, you\nsee.  Massa Humphrey very clever, he catch cow.\"\n\n\"Catch gipsy,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pablo, laughing, \"catch cow, catch gipsy, and by and by\ncatch horse.\"\n\nWhen Edward arrived at the Intendant's house, he was very kindly\nreceived by the Intendant and the two girls.  Having deposited his\nwardrobe in his bedroom, he went out to Oswald and put Smoker in the\nkennel, and on his return found Pablo sitting on the carpet in the\nsitting-room, talking to Patience and Clara, and they all three appeared\nmuch amused.  When Pablo and Billy had both had something to eat, the\ncart was filled with pots of flowers, and several other little things as\npresents from Patience Heatherstone, and Pablo set off on his return.\n\n\"Edward, you do look like a--,\" said Clara, stopping.\n\n\"Like a secretary, I hope,\" added Edward.\n\n\"Well, you don't look like a forester; does he, Patience?\" continued\nClara.\n\n\"You must not judge of people by their clothes, Clara.\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" replied Clara.  \"Those clothes would not look well upon\nOswald, or the other men, for they would not suit them; but they do suit\nyou: don't they, Patience?\"\n\nPatience Heatherstone, however, did not make any answer to this second\nappeal made by Clara.\n\n\"Why don't you answer me, Patience?\" said Clara.\n\n\"My dear Clara, it's not the custom for young maidens to make remarks\nupon people's attire.  Little girls like you may do so.\"\n\n\"Why, did you not tell Pablo that he looked well in his new clothes?\"\n\n\"Yes, but Pablo is not Mr Armitage, Clara.  That is very different.\"\n\n\"Well, it may be, but still you might answer a question, if put to you,\nPatience; and I ask again, does not Edward look much better in the dress\nhe has on than in that he generally has worn?\"\n\n\"I think it a becoming dress, Clara, since you will have an answer.\"\n\n\"Fine feathers make fine birds, Clara,\" said Edward, laughing: \"and so\nthat is all we can say about it.\"\n\nEdward then changed the conversation.  Soon afterwards dinner was\nannounced, and Clara again observed to Edward--\"Why do you always call\nPatience, Mistress Heatherstone?  Ought he not to call her Patience,\nsir?\" said Clara, appealing to the Intendant.\n\n\"That must depend upon his own feelings, my dear Clara,\" replied Mr\nHeatherstone.  \"It is my intention to waive ceremony as much as\npossible.  Edward Armitage has come to live with us as one of the\nfamily, and he will find himself treated by me as one of us.  I shall,\ntherefore, in future address him as Edward, and he has my full\npermission, and I may say it is my wish, that he should be on the same\nfamiliar terms with us all.  When Edward feels inclined to address my\ndaughter as he does you, by her name of baptism, he will, I daresay, now\nthat he has heard my opinion, do so; and reserve `Mistress Heatherstone'\nfor the time when they have a quarrel.\"\n\n\"Then I hope he will never again address me that way,\" observed\nPatience; \"for I am under too great obligations to him to bear even the\nidea of being on had terms with him.\"\n\n\"Do you hear that, Edward?\" said Clara.\n\n\"Yes, I do, Clara; and after such a remark, you may be sure that I shall\nnever address her in that way again.\"\n\nIn a few days Edward became quite at home.  In the forenoon Mr\nHeatherstone dictated one or two letters to him, which he wrote; and\nafter that his time was at his own disposal, and was chiefly passed in\nthe company of Patience and Clara.  With the first he had now become on\nthe most intimate and brotherly footing; and when they addressed each\nother, Patience and Edward were the only appellations made use of.  Once\nMr Heatherstone asked Edward whether he would not like to go out with\nOswald to kill a deer, which he did; but the venison was hardly yet in\nseason.  There was a fine horse in the stable at Edward's order, and he\noften rode out with Patience and Clara; indeed his time passed so\nagreeably that he could hardly think it possible that a fortnight had\npassed away, when he asked permission to go over to the cottage and see\nhis sisters.\n\nWith the Intendant's permission, Patience and Clara accompanied him; and\nthe joy of Alice and Edith was great, when they made their appearance.\nOswald had, by Edward's request, gone over a day or two before, to tell\nthem that they were coming, that they might be prepared; and the\nconsequence was that it was a holiday at the cottage.  Alice had cooked\nher best dinner, and Humphrey and Pablo were at home to receive them.\n\n\"How pleasant it will be, if we are to see you and Clara whenever we see\nEdward!\" said Alice to Patience.  \"So far from being sorry that Edward\nis with you I shall be quite glad of it.\"\n\n\"I water the flowers every day,\" said Edith, \"and they make the garden\nlook so gay.\"\n\n\"I will bring you plenty more in the autumn, Edith; but this is not the\nright time for transplanting flowers yet,\" replied Patience.  \"And now,\nAlice, you must take me to see your farm, for when I was here last I had\nno time; let us come now, and show me everything.\"\n\n\"But my dinner, Patience; I cannot leave it, or it will be spoiled, and\nthat will never do.  You must either go with Edith now, or wait till\nafter dinner, when I can get away.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we will stay till after dinner, Alice, and we will help you\nto serve it up.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pablo generally does that, for Edith cannot reach down the\nthings.  I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"He went away with Edward and Humphrey, I think,\" said Edith.  \"I'll\nscold him when he comes back for being out of the way.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Edith, I can reach the dishes,\" said Patience, \"and you and\nClara can then take them, and the platters, and put them on the table\nfor Alice.\"\n\nAnd Patience did as she proposed, and the dinner was soon afterwards on\nthe table.  There was a ham, and two boiled fowls, and a piece of salted\nbeef, and some roasted kid, besides potatoes and green peas; and when it\nis considered that such a dinner was set on the table by such young\npeople, left entirely to their own exertions and industry, it must be\nadmitted that it did them and their farm great credit.\n\nIn the meantime Edward and Humphrey, after the first greetings were\nover, had walked out to converse, while Pablo had taken the horses into\nthe stable.\n\n\"Well, Humphrey, how do you get on?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Humphrey.  \"I have just finished a very tough job.\nI have dug out the saw-pit, and have sawed the slabs for the sides of\nthe pit, and made it quite secure.  The large fir-tree that was blown\ndown is now at the pit, ready for sawing up into planks, and Pablo and I\nare to commence to-morrow.  At first we made but a bad hand of sawing\noff the slabs, but before we had cut them all we got on pretty well.\nPablo don't much like it, and indeed no more do I much, it is such\nmechanical work, and so tiring; but he does not complain.  I do not\nintend that he shall saw more than two days in a week; that will be\nsufficient; we shall get on fast enough.\"\n\n\"You are right, Humphrey; it is an old saying, that you must not work a\nwilling horse to death.  Pablo is very willing, but hard work he is not\naccustomed to.\"\n\n\"Well, now you must come and look at my flock of goats, Edward, they are\nnot far off.  I have taught Holdfast to take care of them, and he never\nleaves them now, and brings them home at night.  Watch always remains\nwith me, and is an excellent dog, and very intelligent.\"\n\n\"You have indeed a fine flock, Humphrey!\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes, and they are improved in appearance already since they have been\nhere.  Alice has got her geese and ducks, and I have made a place large\nenough for them to wash in, until I have time to dig them out a pond.\"\n\n\"I thought we had gathered more hay than you required; but with this\naddition, I think you will find none to spare before the spring.\"\n\n\"So far from it, that I have been mowing down a great deal more, Edward,\nand it is almost ready to carry away.  Poor Billy has had hard work of\nit, I assure you, since he came back, with one thing and another.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow, but it won't last long, Humphrey,\" said Edward, smiling;\n\"the other horses will soon take his place.\"\n\n\"I trust they will,\" said Humphrey, \"at all events by next spring;\nbefore that I do not expect that they will.\"\n\n\"By the bye, Humphrey, you recollect what I said to you that the robber\nI shot told me, just before he died?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do recollect it now,\" replied Humphrey; \"but I had quite forgot\nall about it till you mentioned it now, although I wrote it down, that\nwe might not forget it.\"\n\n\"Well, I have been thinking all about it, Humphrey.  The robber told me\nthat the money was mine, taking me for another person; therefore I do\nnot consider it was given to me, nor do I consider that it was his to\ngive.  I hardly know what to do about it, nor to whom the money can be\nsaid to belong.\"\n\n\"Well I think I can answer that question.  The property of all\nmalefactors belongs to the king; and therefore this money belongs to the\nking; and we may retain it for the king, or use it for his service.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would have belonged to the king had the man been condemned, and\nhung on the gallows as he deserved; but he was not, and therefore I\nthink that it does not belong to the king.\"\n\n\"Then it belongs to whoever finds it, and who keeps it till it is\nclaimed--which will never be.\"\n\n\"I think I must speak to the Intendant about it,\" replied Edward; \"I\nshould feel more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Then do so,\" replied Humphrey; \"I think you are right to have no\nconcealments from him.\"\n\n\"But, Humphrey,\" replied Edward, laughing, \"what silly fellows we are!\nWe do not yet know whether we shall find anything; we must first see if\nthere is anything buried there; and when we have done so, then we will\ndecide how to act.  I shall, if it please God, be over again in a\nfortnight, and in the meantime, do you find out the place, and ascertain\nif what the fellow said is true.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Humphrey.  \"I will go to-morrow, with Billy and the\ncart, and take a spade and pick-axe with me.  It may be a fool's errand,\nbut still they say, and one would credit, for the honour of human\nnature, that the words of a dying man are those of truth.  We had better\ngo back now, for I think dinner must be ready.\"\n\nNow that they had become so intimate with Patience Heatherstone--and I\nmay add, so fond of her--there was no longer any restraint, and they had\na very merry dinner-party; and after dinner, Patience went out with\nAlice and Edith, and looked over the garden and farm.  She wished very\nmuch to ascertain if there was anything that they required, but she\ncould discover but few things, and those only trifles; but she\nrecollected them all, and sent them to the cottage a few days\nafterwards.  But the hour of parting arrived, for it was a long ride\nback, and they could not stay any longer, if they wished to get home\nbefore dark, as Mr Heatherstone had requested Edward that they should\ndo; so the horses were brought out, and wishing good-bye, they set off\nagain, little Edith crying after them, \"Come again soon!  Patience, must\ncome again soon!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\n\nThe summer had now advanced, when Oswald one day said to Edward--\n\n\"Have you heard the news, sir?\"\n\n\"Nothing very particular,\" replied Edward; \"I know that General Cromwell\nis over in Ireland, and they say very successful; but I have cared\nlittle for particulars.\"\n\n\"They say a great deal more, sir,\" replied Oswald; \"they say that the\nking is in Scotland, and that the Scotch have raised an army for him.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Edward, \"that is news indeed!  The Intendant has never\nmentioned it to me.\"\n\n\"I daresay not, sir; for he knows your feelings, and would be sorry to\npart with you.\"\n\n\"I will certainly speak to him on the subject,\" said Edward, \"at the\nrisk of his displeasure; and join the army I will, if I find what you\nsay is true.  I should hold myself a craven to remain here while the\nking is fighting for his own, and not to be at his side.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I think it is true, for I heard that the Parliament had sent\nover for General Cromwell to leave Ireland, and lead the troops against\nthe Scotch army.\"\n\n\"You drive me mad, Oswald!  I will go to the Intendant immediately!\"\n\nEdward, much excited by the intelligence, went into the room where he\nusually sat with the Intendant.  The latter, who was at his desk, looked\nup, and saw how flushed Edward was, and said very quietly--\n\n\"Edward, you are excited, I presume, from hearing the news which has\narrived?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am very much so; and I regret very much that I should be\nthe last to whom such important news is made known.\"\n\n\"It is, as you say, important news,\" replied the Intendant; \"but if you\nwill sit down, we will talk a little upon the subject.\"\n\nEdward took a chair, and the Intendant said--\n\n\"I have no doubt that your present feeling is to go to Scotland, and\njoin the army without delay?\"\n\n\"Such is my intention, I candidly confess, sir.  It is my duty.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may be persuaded to the contrary before we part,\" replied\nthe Intendant.  \"The first duty you owe is to your family in their\npresent position; they depend upon you; and a false step on your part\nwould be their ruin.  How can you leave them, and leave my employ,\nwithout it being known for what purpose you are gone?  It is impossible!\nI must myself make it known, and even then it would be very injurious\nto me, the very circumstance of my having one of your party in my\nservice.  I am suspected by many already, in consequence of the part I\nhave taken against the murder of the late king, and also of the lords\nwho have since suffered.  But, Edward, I did not communicate this\nintelligence to you, for many reasons.  I knew that it would soon come\nto your ears, and I thought it better that I should be more prepared to\nshow you that you may do yourself and me harm, and can do no good to the\nking.  I will now show you that I do put confidence in you; and if you\nwill read these letters, they will prove to you that I am correct in\nwhat I assert.\"\n\nThe Intendant handed three letters to Edward, by which it was evident\nthat all the king's friends in England were of opinion that the time was\nnot ripe for the attempt, and that it would be only a sacrifice to stir\nin the matter; that the Scotch army raised was composed of those who\nwere the greatest enemies to the king, and that the best thing that\ncould happen for the king's interest would be that they were destroyed\nby Cromwell; that it was impossible for the English adherents of Charles\nto join them, and that the Scotch did not wish them so to do.\n\n\"You are no politician, Edward,\" said the Intendant smiling, as Edward\nlaid the letters down on the table.  \"You must admit, that in showing\nyou these letters I have put the utmost confidence in you?\"\n\n\"You have indeed, sir; and thanking you for having so done, I hardly\nneed add that your confidence will never be betrayed.\"\n\n\"That I am sure of; and I trust you will now agree with me and my\nfriends that the best thing is to remain quiet?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir, and for the future I will be guided by you.\"\n\n\"That is all I require of you; and after that promise you shall hear all\nthe news as soon as it arrives.  There are thousands who are just as\nanxious to see the king on the throne again as you are, Edward--and you\nnow know that I am one of them; but the time is not yet come, and we\nmust bide our time.  Depend upon it, that General Cromwell will scatter\nthat army like chaff.  He is on his march now.  After what has passed\nbetween us this day, Edward, I shall talk unreservedly to you on what is\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir, and I promise you faithfully, as I said before, not\nonly to be guided by your advice but to be most secret in all that you\nmay trust me with.\"\n\n\"I have confidence in you, Edward Armitage; and now we will drop the\nsubject for the present: Patience and Clara want you to walk with them,\nso good-bye for a while.\"\n\nEdward left the Intendant, much pleased with the interview.  The\nIntendant kept his word, and concealed nothing from Edward.  All turned\nout as the Intendant had foretold.  The Scotch army was cut to pieces by\nCromwell, and the king retreated to the Highlands; and Edward now felt\nsatisfied that he could do no better than be guided by the Intendant in\nall his future undertakings.\n\nWe must now pass over some time in a few words.  Edward continued at the\nIntendant's, and gave great satisfaction to Mr Heatherstone.  He passed\nhis time very agreeably, sometimes going out to shoot deer with Oswald,\nand often supplying venison to his brother and sisters.  During the\nautumn, Patience very often went to the cottage, and occasionally Mr\nHeatherstone paid them a visit; but after the winter set in Edward came\nover by himself, shooting as he went; and when he and Smoker came, Billy\nalways had a journey to go for the venison left in the forest.  Patience\nsent Alice many little things for her own and Edith's use, and some very\ngood books for them to read; and Humphrey, during the evenings, read\nwith his sisters, that they might learn what he could teach them.  Pablo\nalso learnt to read and write.  Humphrey and Pablo had worked at the\nsaw-pit, and had sawed out a large quantity of boards and timber for\nbuilding, but the work was put off till the spring.\n\nThe reader may recollect that Edward had proposed to Humphrey that he\nshould ascertain whether what the robber had stated before his death,\nrelative to his having concealed his ill-gotten wealth under the tree\nwhich was struck by lightning, was true.  About ten days afterwards\nHumphrey set off on this expedition.  He did not take Pablo with him,\nas, although he had a very good opinion of him, he agreed with Oswald\nthat temptation should not be put in his way.  Humphrey considered that\nit would be the best plan to go at once to Clara's cottage, and from\nthat proceed to find the oak-tree mentioned by the robber.  When he\narrived at the thicket which surrounded the cottage, it occurred to him\nthat he would just go through it and see if it was in the state which\nthey had left it in; for after the Intendant had been there he had given\ndirections to his men to remain and bury the bodies, and then to lock up\nthe doors and bring the keys to him, which had been done.  Humphrey tied\nBilly and the cart to a tree, and walked through the thicket.  As he\napproached he heard voices; so he took care to advance very cautiously,\nfor he had not brought his gun with him.  He crouched down as he came to\nthe opening before the cottage.  The doors and windows were open, and\nthere were two men sitting outside, cleaning their guns; and in one of\nthem Humphrey recognised the man Corbould, who had been discharged by\nthe Intendant as soon as his wound had been cured, and who was supposed\nto have gone to London.  Humphrey was too far off to hear what they\nsaid: he remained there some time, and three more men came out of the\ncottage.  Satisfied with what he had seen, Humphrey cautiously\nretreated, and gaining the outside of the thicket, led away Billy and\nthe cart over the turf, that the noise of the wheels might not be heard.\n\n\"This bodes no good,\" thought Humphrey, as he went along, every now and\nthen looking back to ascertain if the men had come out and seen him.\n\"That Corbould, we know, has vowed vengeance against Edward and all of\nus, and has no doubt joined those robbers--for robbers they must be--\nthat he may fulfil his vow.  It is fortunate that I have made the\ndiscovery, and I will send over immediately to the Intendant.\"  As soon\nas a clump of trees had shut out the thicket, and he had no longer any\nfear of being seen by these people, Humphrey went in the direction which\nthe robber had mentioned, and soon afterwards he perceived the oak\nscathed with lightning, which stood by itself on a green spot of about\ntwenty acres.  It had been a noble tree before it had been destroyed;\nnow it spread its long naked arms, covering a large space of ground, but\nwithout the least sign of vegetation or life remaining.  The trunk was\nmany feet in diameter, and was apparently quite sound, although the tree\nwas dead.  Humphrey left Billy to feed on the herbage close by, and\nthen, from the position of the sun in the heavens, ascertained the point\nat which he was to dig.  First looking around him to see that he was not\noverlooked, he took his spade and pick-axe out of the cart and began his\ntask.  There was a spot not quite so green as the rest, which Humphrey\nthought likely to be the very place that he should dig at, as probably\nit was not green from the soil having been removed.  He commenced at\nthis spot, and after a few moment's labour his pick-axe struck upon\nsomething hard, which, on clearing away the earth, he discovered to be\nthe lid of a wooden box.  Satisfied that he was right, Humphrey now\nworked hard, and in a few minutes he had cleared sufficient space to be\nable to lift out the box and place it on the turf.  He was about to\nexamine it, when he perceived, at about five hundred yards' distance,\nthree men coming towards him.  \"They have discovered me,\" thought\nHumphrey; \"and I must be off as soon as I can.\"  He ran to Billy, who\nwas close to him, and bringing the cart to where the box lay, he lifted\nit in.  As he was getting in himself, with the reins in his hands, he\nperceived that the three men were running towards him as fast as they\ncould, and that they all had guns in their hands.  They were not more\nthan a hundred and fifty yards from him when Humphrey set off, putting\nBilly to a full trot.\n\nThe three men observing this, called out to Humphrey to stop, or they\nwould fire; but Humphrey's only reply was giving a lash to Billy, which\nset him off at a gallop.  The men immediately fired, and the bullets\nwhistled past Humphrey without doing any harm.  Humphrey looked round,\nand finding that he had increased his distance, pulled up the pony, and\nwent a more moderate pace.  \"You'll not catch me,\" thought Humphrey;\n\"and your guns are not loaded, so I'll tantalise you a little.\"  He made\nBilly walk, and turned round to see what the men were about; they had\narrived at where he had dug out the box, and were standing round the\nhole, evidently aware that it was no use following him.  \"Now,\" thought\nHumphrey, as he went along at a faster pace, \"those fellows will wonder\nwhat I have been digging up.  The villains little think that I know\nwhere to find them, and they have proved what they are by firing at me.\nNow, what must I do?  They may follow me to the cottage, for I have no\ndoubt that they know where we live, and that Edward is at the\nIntendant's.  They may come and attack us, and I dare not leave the\ncottage to-night, or send Pablo away, in case they should; but I will\nto-morrow morning.\"  Humphrey considered as he went along all the\ncircumstances and probabilities, and decided that he would act as he at\nfirst proposed to himself.  In an hour he was at the cottage; and as\nsoon as Alice had given him his dinner--for he was later than the usual\ndinner-hour--he told her what had taken place.\n\n\"Where is Pablo?\"\n\n\"He has been working in the garden with Edith all the day,\" replied\nAlice.\n\n\"Well, dear, I hope they will not come to-night: to-morrow I will have\nthem all in custody; but if they do come, we must do our best to beat\nthem off.  It is fortunate that Edward left the guns and pistols which\nhe found in Clara's cottage, so we shall have no want of firearms; and\nwe can barricade the doors and windows, so that they cannot get in in a\nhurry; but I must have Pablo to help me, for there is no time to be\nlost.\"\n\n\"But cannot I help you, Humphrey?\" said Alice.  \"Surely I can do\nsomething?\"\n\n\"We will see, Alice; but I think I can do without you.  We have still\nplenty of daylight.  I will take the box into your room.\"\n\nHumphrey, who had only taken the box out of the cart and carried it\nwithin the threshold of the door, now took it into his sisters' bedroom,\nand then went out and called Pablo, who came running to him.\n\n\"Pablo,\" said Humphrey, \"we must bring to the cottage some of the large\npieces we sawed out for rafters; for I should not be surprised if the\ncottage were attacked this night.\"  He then told Pablo what had taken\nplace.  \"You see, Pablo, I dare not send to the Intendant to-night in\ncase the robbers should come here.\"\n\n\"No, not send to-night,\" said Pablo; \"stay here and fight them; first\nmake door fast, then cut hole to fire through.\"\n\n\"Yes, that was my idea.  You don't mind fighting them, Pablo?\"\n\n\"No; fight hard for Missy Alice and Missy Edith,\" said Pablo; \"fight for\nyou too, Massa Humphrey, and fight for myself,\" added Pablo, laughing.\n\nThey then went for the pieces of squared timber, brought them from the\nsaw-pit to the cottage, and very soon fitted them to the doors and\nwindows, so as to prevent several men, with using all their strength,\nfrom forcing them open.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Humphrey; \"and now get me the small saw, Pablo, and\nI will cut a hole or two to fire through.\"\n\nIt was dark before they had finished, and then they made all fast, and\nwent to Pablo's room for the arms, which they got ready for service, and\nloaded.\n\n\"Now, we are all ready, Alice, so let us have our supper,\" said\nHumphrey.  \"We will make a fight for it, and they shall not get in so\neasily as they think.\"\n\nAfter they had had their supper, Humphrey said the prayers, and told his\nsisters to go to bed.\n\n\"Yes, Humphrey, we will go to bed, but we will not undress; for if they\ncome, I must be up to help you.  I can load a gun, you know, and Edith\ncan take them to you as fast as I load them.  Won't you, Edith?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will bring you the guns, Humphrey, and you shall shoot them,\"\nreplied Edith.\n\nHumphrey kissed his sisters, and they went to their room.  He then put a\nlight in the chimney, that he might not have to get one in case the\nrobbers came, and then desired Pablo to go and lie down on his bed, as\nhe intended to do the same.  Humphrey remained awake till past three\no'clock in the morning; but no robbers came.  Pablo was snoring loud,\nand at last Humphrey fell asleep himself and did not awake till broad\ndaylight.  He got up, and found Alice and Edith were already in the\nsitting-room, lighting the fire.\n\n\"I would not wake you, Humphrey, as you had been sitting up so long.\nThe robbers have not made their appearance, that is clear; shall you\nunbar the door and window-shutters now?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think we may.  Here, Pablo!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pablo, coming out half asleep; \"what the matter?  Thief\ncome?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Edith, \"thief not come, but sun shine; and lazy Pablo not\nget up.\"\n\n\"Up now, Missy Edith.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not awake yet.\"\n\n\"Yes, Missy Edith, quite awake.\"\n\n\"Well then, help me to undo the door, Pablo.\"\n\nThey took down the barricades, and Humphrey opened the door cautiously,\nand looked out.\n\n\"They won't come now, at all events, I should think,\" observed Humphrey;\n\"but there is no saying--they may be prowling about, and may think it\neasier to get in during daytime than at night.  Go out, Pablo, and look\nabout everywhere; take a pistol with you, and fire it off if there is\nany danger, and then come back as fast as you can.\"\n\nPablo took the pistol, and then Humphrey went out of the door and looked\nwell round in front of the cottage, but he would not leave the door till\nhe was assured that no one was there.  Pablo returned soon after, saying\nthat he had looked round everywhere, and into the cow-house and yard,\nand there was nobody to be seen.  This satisfied Humphrey, and they\nreturned to the cottage.\n\n\"Now, Pablo, get your breakfast, while I write the letter to the\nIntendant,\" said Humphrey; \"and then you must saddle Billy and go over\nas fast as you can with the letter.  You can tell him all I have not\nsaid in it.  I shall expect you back at night, and some people with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Pablo, who immediately busied himself with some cold meat\nwhich Alice put before him.  Pablo had finished his breakfast and\nbrought Billy to the door before Humphrey had finished his letter.  As\nsoon as it was written and folded Pablo set off as fast as Billy could\ngo to the other side of the forest.\n\nHumphrey continued on the look-out during the whole day, with his gun on\nhis arm, and his two dogs by his side; for he knew the dogs would give\nnotice of the approach of any one, long before he might see them; but\nnothing occurred during the whole day; and when the evening closed in he\nbarricaded the doors and windows, and remained on the watch with the\ndogs, waiting for the coming of the robbers, or for the coming of the\nparty which he expected would be sent by the Intendant to take them.\nJust as it was dark Pablo returned with a note from Edward saying that\nhe would be over by ten o'clock, with a large party.\n\nHumphrey had said in his letter that it would be better that any force\nsent by the Intendant should not arrive till after dark, as the robbers\nmight be near and perceive them, and then they might escape; he did not\ntherefore expect them to come till some time after dark.  Humphrey was\nreading a book--Pablo was dozing in the chimney-corner--the two girls\nhad retired into their room and had lain down on the bed in their\nclothes--when the dogs both gave a low growl.\n\n\"Somebody come,\" said Pablo, starting up.\n\nAgain the dogs growled, and Humphrey made a sign to Pablo to hold his\ntongue.  A short time of anxious silence succeeded, for it was\nimpossible to ascertain whether the parties were friends or enemies.\nThe dogs now sprang up and barked furiously at the door, and as soon as\nHumphrey had silenced them, a voice was heard outside, begging for\nadmission to a poor benighted traveller.  This was sufficient: it could\nnot be the party from the Intendant's, but the robbers who wished to\ninduce them to open the door.  Pablo put a gun into Humphrey's hand, and\ntook another for himself; he then removed the light into the chimney,\nand on the application from outside being repeated, Humphrey answered--\n\n\"That he never opened the door at that hour of the night, and that it\nwas useless their remaining.\"\n\nNo answer or repetition of the request was made, but, as Humphrey\nretreated with Pablo into the fireplace, a gun was fired into the lock\nof the door, which was blown off into the room, and had it not been for\nthe barricades the door must have flown open.  The robbers appeared\nsurprised at such not being the case, and one of them inserted his arm\ninto the hole made in the door to ascertain what might be the further\nobstacle to open it, when Pablo slipped past Humphrey, and gaining the\ndoor, discharged his gun under the arm which had been thrust into the\nhole in the door.  The person, whoever it might have been, gave a loud\ncry, and fell at the threshold outside.\n\n\"I think that will do,\" said Humphrey; \"we must not take more life than\nis necessary.  I had rather that you had fired through his arm--it would\nhave disabled him, and that would have sufficed.\"\n\n\"Kill much better,\" said Pablo.  \"Corbould shot through leg, come again\nto rob; suppose shot dead, never rob more.\"\n\nThe dogs now flew to the back of the cottage, evidently pointing out\nthat the robbers were attempting that side.  Humphrey put his gun\nthrough the hole in the door, and discharged it.\n\n\"Why you do that, Massa Humphrey, nobody there!\"\n\n\"I know that, Pablo; but if the people are coming from the Intendant's\nthey will see the flash and perhaps hear the report, and it will let\nthem know what is going on.\"\n\n\"There is another gun loaded, Humphrey,\" said Alice, who with Edith had\njoined them without Humphrey observing it.\n\n\"Thanks, love; but you and Edith must not remain here: sit down on the\nhearth, and then you will be sheltered from any bullet which they may\nfire into the house.  I have no fear of their getting in, and we shall\nhave help directly, I have no doubt.  Pablo, I shall fire through the\nback door; they must be there, for the dogs have their noses under it,\nand are so violent.  Do you fire another gun, as a signal, through the\nhole in the front door.\"\n\nHumphrey stood within four feet of the back door, and fired just above\nwhere the dogs held their noses and barked.  Pablo discharged his gun as\ndirected, and then returned to reload the guns.  The dogs were now more\nquiet, and it appeared as if the robbers had retreated from the back\ndoor.  Pablo blew out the light, which had been put more in the centre\nof the room, when Alice and Edith took possession of the fireplace.\n\n\"No fear, Missy Edith, I know where find everything,\" said Pablo, who\nnow went and peered through the hole in the front door, to see if the\nrobbers were coming to it again; but he could see and hear nothing for\nsome time.\n\nAt last the attack was renewed; the dogs flew backwards and forwards,\nsometimes to one door and then to another, as if both were to be\nassailed: and at the same time a crash in Alice's bed-chamber told them\nthat the robbers had burst in the small window in that room, which\nHumphrey had not paid any attention to, as it was so small that a man\ncould hardly introduce his body through it.  Humphrey immediately called\nHoldfast and opened the door of the room; for he thought that a man\nforcing his way in would be driven back or held by the dog, and he and\nPablo dared not leave the two doors.  Watch, the other dog, followed\nHoldfast into the bedroom; and oaths and curses, mingled with the savage\nyells of the dogs, told them that a conflict was going on.  Both doors\nwere now battered with heavy pieces of timber at the same time, and\nPablo said--\n\n\"Great many robbers here.\"\n\nA moment or more had passed, during which Pablo and Humphrey had both\nagain fired their guns through the door, when, of a sudden, other sounds\nwere heard--shots were fired outside, loud cries, and angry oaths and\nexclamations.\n\n\"The Intendant's people are come,\" said Humphrey, \"I am sure of it.\"\n\nShortly afterwards Humphrey heard his name called by Edward, and he\nreplied, and went to the door and undid the barricades.\n\n\"Get a light, Alice, dear,\" said Humphrey, \"we are all safe now.  I will\nopen the door directly, Edward, but in the dark I cannot see the\nfastenings.\"\n\n\"Are you all safe, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"Yes, all safe, Edward.  Wait till Alice brings a light.\"\n\nAlice soon brought one, and then the door was unfastened.  Edward\nstepped over the body of a man which lay at the threshold, saying--\n\n\"You have settled somebody there, at all events,\" and then caught Edith\nand Alice in his arms.\n\nHe was followed by Oswald and some other men, leading in the prisoners.\n\n\"Bind that fellow fast, Oswald,\" said Edward.  \"Get another light,\nPablo; let us see who it is that lies outside the door.\"\n\n\"First see who is in my bedroom, Edward,\" said Alice, \"for the dogs are\nstill there.\"\n\n\"In your bedroom, dearest?  Well, then, let us go there first.\"\n\nEdward went in with Humphrey, and found a man half in the window and\nhalf out, held by the throat and apparently suffocated by the two dogs.\nHe took the dogs off; and desiring the men to secure the robber, and\nascertain whether he was alive or not, he returned to the sitting-room,\nand then went to examine the body outside the door.\n\n\"Corbould, as I live!\" cried Oswald.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Edward; \"he has gone to his account.  God forgive him!\"\n\nOn inquiry they found that of all the robbers, to the number of ten, not\none had escaped--eight they had made prisoners, Corbould, and the man\nwhom the dogs had seized, and who was found to be quite dead, made up\nthe number.  The robbers were all bound and guarded; and then, leaving\nthem under the charge of Oswald and five of his men, Edward and Humphrey\nset off with seven more to Clara's cottage, to ascertain if there were\nany more to be found there.  They arrived by two o'clock in the morning,\nand on knocking several times the door was opened and they seized\nanother man, the only one who was found in it.  They then went back to\nthe cottage with their prisoner, and by the time that they had arrived\nit was daylight.  As soon as the party sent by the Intendant had been\nsupplied with breakfast, Edward bade farewell to Humphrey and his\nsisters, that he might return and deliver up his prisoners.  Pablo went\nwith him to bring back the cart which carried the two dead bodies.  This\ncapture cleared the forest of the robbers who had so long infested it,\nfor they never had any more attempts made from that time.\n\nBefore Edward left, Humphrey and he examined the box which had been dug\nup from under the oak, and which had occasioned such danger to the\ninmates of the cottage; for one of the men stated to Edward that they\nsuspected that the box which they had seen Humphrey dig out contained\ntreasure, and that without they had seen him in possession of it, they\nnever should have attacked the cottage, although Corbould had often\npersuaded them so to do; but as they knew that he was only seeking\nrevenge--and they required money to stimulate them--they had refused, as\nthey considered that there was nothing to be obtained in the cottage\nworth the risk, as they knew that the inmates had firearms and would\ndefend themselves.  On examination of its contents, they found in it a\nsum of forty pounds in gold, a bag of silver, and some other valuables\nin silver spoons, candlesticks, and ornaments for women.  Edward took a\nlist of the contents, and when he returned he stated to the Intendant\nall that had occurred, and requested to know what should be done with\nthe money and other articles which Humphrey had found.\n\n\"I wish you had said nothing to me about it,\" said the Intendant,\n\"although I am pleased with your open and fair dealing.  I cannot say\nanything, except that you had better let Humphrey keep it till it is\nclaimed--which, of course, it never will be.  But, Edward, Humphrey must\ncome over here and make his deposition, as I must report the capture of\nthese robbers and send them to trial.  You had better go with the clerk\nand take the depositions of Pablo and your sisters, while Humphrey comes\nhere.  You can stay till his return.  Their depositions are not of so\nmuch consequence as Humphrey's, as they can only speak as to the attack,\nbut Humphrey's I must take down myself.\"\n\nWhen Patience and Clara heard that Edward was going over, they obtained\nleave to go with him to see Alice and Edith, and were to be escorted\nback by Humphrey.  This the Intendant consented to, and they had a very\nmerry party.  Humphrey remained two days at the Intendant's house, and\nthen returned to the cottage, where Edward had taken his place during\nhis absence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\n\nThe winter set in very severe, and the falls of snow were very heavy and\nfrequent.  It was fortunate Humphrey had been so provident in making so\nlarge a quantity of hay, or the stock would have been starved.  The\nflock of goats, in great part, subsisted themselves on the bark of trees\nand moss; at night they had some hay given to them, and they did very\nwell.  It was hardly possible for Edward to come over to see his brother\nand sisters, for the snow was so deep as to render such a long journey\ntoo fatiguing for a horse.  Twice or thrice after the snow fell he\ncontrived to get over, but after that they knew that it was impossible,\nand they did not expect him.  Humphrey and Pablo had little to do except\nattending to the stock, and cutting firewood to keep up their supply,\nfor they now burnt it very fast.  The snow lay several feet high round\nthe cottage, being driven against it by the wind.  They had kept a\npassage clear to the yard, and had kept the yard as clear as possible:\nthey could do no more.  A sharp frost and clear weather succeeded to the\nsnow-storms, and there appeared no chance of the snow melting away.  The\nnights were dark and long, and their oil for their lamp was getting low.\nHumphrey was anxious to go to Lymington, as they required many things;\nbut it was impossible to go anywhere except on foot, and walking was,\nfrom the depth of the snow, a most fatiguing exercise.  There was one\nthing, however, that Humphrey had not forgotten, which was, that he had\ntold Edward that he would try and capture some of the forest ponies; and\nduring the whole of the time since the heavy fall of snow had taken\nplace he had been making his arrangements.  The depth of the snow\nprevented the animals from obtaining any grass, and they were almost\nstarved, as they could find nothing to subsist upon except the twigs and\nbranches of trees which they could reach.  Humphrey went out with Pablo\nand found the herd, which was about five miles from the cottage, and\nnear to Clara's old home.  He and Pablo brought with them as much hay as\nthey could carry, and strewed it about, so as to draw the ponies nearer\nto them, and then Humphrey looked for a place which would answer his\npurpose.  About three miles from the cottage he found what he thought\nwould suit him; there was a sort of avenue between two thickets, about a\nhundred yards wide; and the wind blowing through this avenue, during the\nsnow-storm, had drifted the snow at one end of it, and raised right\nacross it a large mound several feet high.  By strewing small bundles of\nhay he drew the herd of ponies into this avenue, and in it he left them\na good quantity to feed upon every night for several nights, till at\nlast the herd went there every morning.\n\n\"Now, Pablo, we must make a trial,\" said Humphrey.  \"You must get your\nlassos ready, in case they should be required.  We must go to the avenue\nbefore daylight with the two dogs, tie one upon one side of the avenue\nand the other on the other, that they may bark and prevent the ponies\nfrom attempting to escape through the thicket.  Then we must get the\nponies between us and the drift of snow which lies across the avenue,\nand try if we cannot draw them into the drift.  If so, they will plunge\nin so deep that some of them will not be able to get out before we have\nthrown the ropes round their necks.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Pablo; \"very good--soon catch them.\"\n\nBefore daylight they went with the dogs and a large bundle of hay, which\nthey strewed nearer to the mound of drifted snow.  They then tied the\ndogs up on each side, ordering them to lie down and be quiet.  Then they\nwalked through the thicket so as not to be perceived, until they\nconsidered that they were far enough from the snow-drift.  About\ndaylight the herd came to pick up the hay as usual, and after they had\npassed them Humphrey and Pablo followed in the thicket, not wishing to\nshow themselves till the last moment.  While the ponies were busy with\nthe hay, they suddenly ran out into the avenue and separated, so as to\nprevent the ponies from attempting to gallop past them.  Shouting as\nloud as they could, as they ran up to the ponies, and calling to the\ndogs, who immediately set up a barking on each side; the ponies, alarmed\nat the noise and the appearance of humphrey and Pablo, naturally set off\nin the only direction which appeared to them to be clear, and galloped\naway towards the mound of drifted snow, with their tails streaming, and\nsnorting and plunging in the snow as they hurried along; but as soon as\nthey arrived at the mound they plunged first up to their bellies, and\nafterwards, as they attempted to force their way where the snow was\ndeeper, many of them stuck fast altogether, and struggled to clear\nthemselves in vain.  Humphrey and Pablo, who had followed them as fast\nas they could run, now came up with them and threw the lasso over the\nneck of one, and ropes with slip nooses over two more, which were\nfloundering in the snow there together.  The remainder of the herd,\nafter great exertions, got clear off by turning round and galloping\nback--through the avenue.  The three captured ponies made a furious\nstruggle; but by drawing the ropes tight round their necks they were\nwell-nigh choked, and soon unable to move.  The lads then tied their\nfore-legs, and loosened the ropes round their necks that they might\nrecover their breath.\n\n\"Got them now, Massa Humphrey,\" said Pablo.\n\n\"Yes, but our work is not yet over, Pablo; we must get them home; how\nshall we manage that?\"\n\n\"Suppose they no eat to-day and to-morrow, get very tame.\"\n\n\"I believe that will be the best way; they cannot get loose again, do\nall they can.\"\n\n\"No, sir; but get one home to-day.  This very fine pony; suppose we try\nhim.\"\n\nPablo then put the halter on, and tied the end short to the fore-leg of\nthe pony, so that it could not walk without keeping its head close to\nthe ground--if it raised its head it was obliged to lift up its leg.\nThen he put the lasso round its neck to choke it if it was too unruly,\nand, having done that, he cast loose the ropes which had tied its\nfore-legs together.\n\n\"Now, Massa Humphrey, we get him home somehow.  First I go loose the\ndogs; he 'fraid of the dogs, and run t'other way.\"\n\nThe pony, which was an iron-grey and very handsome, plunged furiously\nand kicked behind; but it could not do so without falling down, which it\ndid several times before Pablo returned with the dogs.  Humphrey held\none part of the lasso on one side, and Pablo on the other, keeping the\npony between them; and with the dogs barking at it behind, they\ncontrived, with a great deal of exertion and trouble, to get the pony to\nthe cottage.  The poor animal, driven in this way on three legs, and\nevery now and then choked with the lasso, was covered with foam before\nthey arrived.  Billy was turned out of his stable to make room for the\nnewcomer, who was fastened securely to the manger and then left without\nfood, that he might become tame.  It was too late then, and they were\ntoo tired themselves to go for the other two ponies, so they were left\nlying on the snow all night, and the next morning they found them much\ntamer than they were at first, and during the day, following the same\nplan, they were both brought to the stable and secured alongside of the\nother.  One was a bay pony with black legs, and the other a brown one.\nThe bay pony was a mare, and the other two horses.  Alice and Edith were\ndelighted with the new ponies, and Humphrey was not a little pleased\nthat he had succeeded in capturing them, after what had passed between\nEdward and himself.  After two days' fasting, the poor animals were so\ntame that they ate out of Pablo's hand and submitted to be stroked and\ncaressed; and before they were a fortnight in the stable.  Alice and\nEdith could go up to them without danger.  They were soon broken in; for\nthe yard being full of muck, Pablo took them into it and mounted them.\nThey plunged and kicked at first, and tried all they could to get rid of\nhim, but they sank so deep into the muck that they were soon tired out;\nand after a month they were all three tolerably quiet to ride.\n\nThe snow was so deep all over the country that there was little\ncommunication with the metropolis.  The Intendant's letter spoke of King\nCharles raising another army in Holland, and that his adherents in\nEngland were preparing to join him as soon as he marched southward.\n\n\"I think, Edward,\" said the Intendant, \"that the king's affairs do now\nwear a more promising aspect, but there is plenty of time yet.  I know\nyour anxiety to serve your king, and I cannot blame it.  I shall not\nprevent your going, although of course I must not be cognisant of your\nhaving so done.  When the winter breaks up I shall send you to London.\nYou will then be able better to judge of what is going on, and your\nabsence will not create any suspicion; but you must be guided by me.\"\n\n\"I certainly will, sir,\" replied Edward.  \"I should indeed like to\nstrike one blow for the king, come what will.\"\n\n\"All depends upon whether they manage affairs well in Scotland; but\nthere is so much jealousy and pride, and I fear treachery also, that it\nis hard to say how matters may end.\"\n\nIt was soon after this conversation that a messenger arrived from London\nwith letters, announcing that King Charles had been crowned in Scotland\nwith great solemnity and magnificence.\n\n\"The plot thickens,\" said the Intendant; \"and by this letter from my\ncorrespondent Ashley Cooper, I find that the king's army is well\nappointed, and that David Lesley is Lieutenant-General: Middleton\ncommands the horse, and Wemyss the artillery.  That Wemyss is certainly\na good officer, but was not true to the late king:--may he behave better\nto the present!  Now, Edward, I shall send you to London, and I will\ngive you letters to those who will advise you how to proceed.  You may\ntake the black horse; he will bear you well.  You will of course write\nto me, for Sampson will go with you, and you can send him back when you\nconsider that you do not require or wish for his presence: there is no\ntime to be lost, for, depend upon it, Cromwell, who is still at\nEdinburgh, will take the field as soon as he can.  Are you ready to\nstart to-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, quite ready.\"\n\n\"I fear that you cannot go over to the cottage to bid farewell to your\nsisters, but perhaps it is better that you should not.\"\n\n\"I think so too, sir,\" replied Edward; \"now that the snow has nearly\ndisappeared I did think of going over, having been so long absent, but I\nmust send Oswald over instead.\"\n\n\"Well, then, leave me to write my letters, and do you prepare your\nsaddle-bags.  Patience and Clara will assist you.  Tell Sampson to come\nto me.\"\n\nEdward went to Patience and Clara, and told them that he was to set off\nfor London on the following morning, and was about to make his\npreparations.\n\n\"How long do you remain, Edward?\" inquired Patience.\n\n\"I cannot tell; Sampson goes with me, and I must of course be guided by\nyour father.  Do you know where the saddle-bags are, Patience?\"\n\n\"Yes, Phoebe shall bring them to your room.\"\n\n\"And you and Clara must come and give me your assistance.\"\n\n\"Certainly we will, if you require it; but I did not know that your\nwardrobe was so extensive.\"\n\n\"You know that it is anything but extensive, Patience; but that is the\nreason why your assistance is more required.  A small wardrobe ought at\nleast to be in good order; and what I would require is, that you would\nlook over the linen, and where it requires a little repair you will\nbestow upon it your charity.\"\n\n\"That we will do, Clara,\" replied Patience; \"so get your needles and\nthread, and let us send him to London with whole linen.  We will come\nwhen we are ready, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't like his going to London at all,\" said Clara; \"we shall be so\nlonely when he has gone.\"\n\nEdward had left the room, and having obtained the saddle-bags from\nPhoebe, had gone up to his chamber.  The first thing that he laid hold\nof was his father's sword; he took it down, and having wiped it\ncarefully, he kissed it, saying, \"God grant that I may do credit to it,\nand prove as worthy to wield it as was my brave father!\"  He had uttered\nthese words aloud; and again taking the sword, and laying it down on the\nbed, turned round, and perceived that Patience had, unknown to him,\nentered the room, and was standing close to him.  Edward was not\nconscious that he had spoken aloud, and therefore merely said, \"I was\nnot aware of your presence, Patience.  Your foot is so light.\"\n\n\"Whose sword is that, Edward?\"\n\n\"It is mine; I bought it at Lymington.\"\n\n\"But what makes you have such an affection for that sword?\"\n\n\"Affection for it?\"\n\n\"Yes; as I came into the room you kissed it as fervently as--\"\n\n\"As a lover would his mistress, I presume you would say,\" replied\nEdward.\n\n\"Nay, I meant not to use such vain words.  I was about to say as a\nCatholic would a relic.  I ask you again, why so?  A sword is but a\nsword.  You are about to leave this on a mission of my father's.  You\nare not a soldier, about to engage in strife and war; if you were, why\nkiss your sword?\"\n\n\"I will tell you.  I do love this sword.  I purchased it, as I told you,\nat Lymington, and they told me that it belonged to Colonel Beverley.  It\nis for his sake that I love it.  You know what obligations our family\nwere under to him.\"\n\n\"This sword was then wielded by Colonel Beverley, the celebrated\nCavalier, was it?\" said Patience, taking it from off the bed and\nexamining it.\n\n\"Yes, it was; and here, you see, are his initials upon the hilt.\"\n\n\"And why do you take it to London with you?  Surely it is not the weapon\nwhich should be worn by a secretary, Edward: it is too large, and\ncumbrous, and out of character.\"\n\n\"Recollect, that till these last few months I have been a forester,\nPatience, and not a secretary.  Indeed I feel that I am more fit for\nactive life than the situation which your father's kindness has bestowed\nupon me.  I was brought up, as you have heard, to follow to the wars,\nhad my patron lived.\"\n\nPatience made no reply.  Clara now joined them, and they commenced the\ntask of examining the linen; and Edward left the room, as he wished to\nspeak with Oswald.  They did not meet again till dinner-time.  Edward's\nsudden departure had spread a gloom over them all,--even the Intendant\nwas silent and thoughtful.  In the evening he gave Edward the letters\nwhich he had written, and a considerable sum of money, telling him where\nhe was to apply if he required more for his expenses.  The Intendant\ncautioned him on his behaviour in many points, and also relative to his\ndress and carriage during his stay in the metropolis.\n\n\"If you should leave London there will be no occasion, nay, it would be\ndangerous to write to me.  I shall take it for granted that you will\nretain Sampson till your departure, and when he returns here I shall\npresume that you have gone north.  I will not detain you longer, Edward:\nmay Heaven bless and protect you!\"\n\nSo saying, the Intendant went away to his own room.\n\n\"Kind and generous man!\" thought Edward; \"how much did I mistake you\nwhen we first met!\"\n\nTaking up the letters and bag of money, which still remained on the\ntable, Edward went to his room, and having placed the letters and money\nin the saddle-bag, he commended himself to the Divine Protector, and\nretired to rest.\n\nBefore daylight the sound of Sampson's heavy travelling boots below\nroused up Edward, and he was soon dressed.  Taking his saddle-bags on\nhis arm, he walked softly downstairs, that he might not disturb any of\nthe family; but when he was passing the sitting-room he perceived that\nthere was a light in it, and on looking in, that Patience was up and\ndressed.  Edward looked surprised, and was about to speak, when Patience\nsaid--\n\n\"I rose early, Edward, because, when I took leave of you last night, I\nforgot a little parcel that I wanted to give you before you went.  It\nwill not take much room, and may beguile a weary hour.  It is a little\nbook of meditations.  Will you accept it, and promise me to read it when\nyou have time?\"\n\n\"I certainly will, my dear Patience--if I may venture on the\nexpression--read it, and think of you.\"\n\n\"Nay you must read it and think of what it contains,\" replied Patience.\n\n\"I will, then.  I shall not need the book to remind me of Patience\nHeatherstone, I assure you.\"\n\n\"And now, Edward, I do not pretend to surmise the reason of your\ndeparture, nor would it be becoming in me to attempt to discover what my\nfather thinks proper to be silent upon, but I must beg you to promise\none thing.\"\n\n\"Name it, dear Patience,\" replied Edward; \"my heart is so full at the\nthought of leaving you that I feel I can refuse you nothing.\"\n\n\"It is this,--I have a presentiment, I know not why, that you are about\nto encounter danger.  If so, be prudent,--be prudent for the sake of\nyour dear sisters--be prudent for the sake of all your friends, who\nwould regret you--promise me that.\"\n\n\"I do promise you, most faithfully, Patience, that I will ever have my\nsisters and you in my thoughts, and will not be rash under any\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Edward; may God bless you and preserve you!\"\n\nEdward first kissed Patience's hand, that was held in his own; but\nperceiving the tears starting in her eyes, he kissed them off, without\nany remonstrance on her part, and then left the room.  In a few moments\nmore he was mounted on a fine powerful black horse, and followed by\nSampson, on his road to London.\n\nWe will pass over the journey, which was accomplished without any event\nworthy of remark.  Edward had, from the commencement, called Sampson to\nhis side, that he might answer the questions he had to make upon all\nthat he saw, and which the reader must be aware was quite new to one\nwhose peregrinations had been confined to the New Forest and the town\nadjacent.  Sampson was a very powerful man, of a cool and silent\ncharacter, by no means deficient in intelligence, and trustworthy\nwithal.  He had long been a follower of the Intendant, and had served in\nthe army.  He was very devout; and generally, when not addressed, was\nsinging hymns in a low voice.\n\nOn the evening of the second day they were close to the metropolis, and\nSampson pointed out to Edward Saint Paul's Cathedral and Westminster\nAbbey, and other objects worthy of note.\n\n\"And where are we to lodge, Sampson?\" inquired Edward.\n\n\"The best hotel that I know of for man and beast is the `Swan with Three\nNecks,' in Holborn.  It is not over frequented by roysterers, and you\nwill there be quiet, and if your affairs demand it, unobserved.\"\n\n\"That will suit me, Sampson: I wish to observe, and not be observed,\nduring my stay in London.\"\n\nBefore dark they had arrived at the hotel, and the horses were in the\nstable.  Edward had procured an apartment to his satisfaction, and,\nfeeling fatigued with his two days' travelling, had gone to bed.\n\nThe following morning he examined the letters which had been given to\nhim by the Intendant, and inquired of Sampson if he could direct him on\nhis way.  Sampson knew London well: and Edward set out to Spring Gardens\nto deliver a letter, which the intendant informed him was confidential,\nto a person of the name of Langton.  Edward knocked and was ushered in,\nSampson taking a seat in the hall while Edward was shown into a\nhandsomely-furnished library, where he found himself in the presence of\na tall spare man, dressed after the fashion of the Roundheads of the\ntime.  He presented the letter.  Mr Langton bowed and requested Edward\nto sit down; and after Edward had taken a chair, he then seated himself\nand opened the letter.\n\n\"You are right welcome, Master Armitage,\" said Mr Langton; \"I find\nthat, young as you appear to be, you are in the whole confidence of our\nmutual friend Mr Heatherstone.  He hints at your being probably obliged\nto take a journey to the north, and that you will be glad to take charge\nof any letters which I may have to send in that direction.  I will have\nthem ready for you; and in case of need they will be such as will give a\ncolouring to your proceeding, provided you may not choose to reveal your\ntrue object.  How wears our good friend Heatherstone, and his daughter?\"\n\n\"Quite well, sir.\"\n\n\"And he told me in one of his former letters that he had the daughter of\nour poor friend Ratcliffe with him.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is, Mr Langton; and as gentle and pretty a child as you could wish\nto see.\"\n\n\"When did you arrive in London?\"\n\n\"Yesterday evening, sir.\"\n\n\"And do you propose any stay?\"\n\n\"That I cannot answer, sir; I must be guided by your advice.  I have\nnought to do here, unless it be to deliver some three or four letters,\ngiven me by Mr Heatherstone.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion, Master Armitage, that the less you are seen in this\ncity the better; there are hundreds employed to find out newcomers, and\nto discover from their people, or by other means, for what purpose they\nmay have come; for you must be aware, Master Armitage, that the times\nare dangerous and people's minds are various.  In attempting to free\nourselves from what we considered despotism, we have created for\nourselves a worse despotism, and one that is less endurable.  It is to\nbe hoped that what has passed will make not only kings, but subjects,\nwiser than they have been.  Now what do you propose--to leave this\ninstantly?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you think it advisable.\"\n\n\"My advice, then, is to leave London immediately.  I will give you\nletters to some friends of mine in Lancashire and Yorkshire; in either\ncounty you can remain unnoticed, and make what preparations you think\nnecessary.  But do nothing in haste--consult well, and be guided by\nthem, who will, if it is considered advisable and prudent, join with you\nin your project.  I need say no more.  Call upon me to-morrow morning an\nhour before noon, and I will have letters ready for you.\"\n\nEdward rose to depart, and thanked Mr Langton for his kindness.\n\n\"Farewell, Master Armitage,\" said Langton; \"to-morrow at the hour of\neleven!\"\n\nEdward then quitted the house, and delivered the other letters of\ncredence, the only one of importance at the moment was the one of\ncredit; the others were to various members of the Parliament, desiring\nthem to know Master Armitage as a confidential friend of the Intendant,\nand in case of need to exert their good offices in his behalf.  The\nletter of credit was upon a Hamburgh merchant, who asked Edward if he\nrequired money.  Edward replied that he did not at present, but that he\nhad business to do for his employer in the north, and might require some\nwhen there, if it was possible to obtain it so far from London.\n\n\"When do you set out?  And to what town do you go?\"\n\n\"That I cannot well tell till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Call before you leave this, and I will find some means of providing for\nyou as you wish.\"\n\nEdward then returned to the hotel.  Before he went to bed he told\nSampson that he found that he had to leave London on Mr Heatherstone's\naffairs, and might be absent some time; he concluded by observing that\nhe did not consider it necessary to take him with him, as he could\ndispense with his services, and Mr Heatherstone would be glad to have\nhim back.\n\n\"As you wish, sir,\" replied Sampson.  \"When am I to go back?\"\n\n\"You may leave to-morrow as soon as you please.  I have no letter to\nsend.  You may tell them that I am well, and will write as soon as I\nhave anything positive to communicate.\"\n\nEdward then made Sampson a present, and wished him a pleasant journey.\n\nAt the hour appointed on the following day Edward repaired to Mr\nLangton, who received him very cordially.\n\n\"I am all ready for you, Master Armitage: there is a letter to two\nCatholic ladies in Lancashire, who will take great care of you; and here\nis one to a friend of mine in Yorkshire.  The ladies live about four\nmiles from the town of Bolton, and my Yorkshire friend in the city of\nYork.  You may trust to either of them.  And now, farewell; and, if\npossible, leave London before nightfall--the sooner the better.  Where\nis your servant?\"\n\n\"He has returned to Mr Heatherstone this morning.\"\n\n\"You have done right.  Lose no time in leaving London; and don't be in a\nhurry in your future plans.  You understand me.  If any one accosts you\non the road put no trust in any professions.  You of course are going\ndown to your relations in the north.  Have you pistols?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I have a pair which belonged to the unfortunate Mr\nRatcliffe.\"\n\n\"Then they are good ones, I'll answer for it: no man was more particular\nabout his weapons, or knew how to use them better.  Farewell, Master\nArmitage, and may success attend you.\"\n\nMr Langton held out his hand to Edward, who respectfully took his\nleave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\n\nEdward was certain that Mr Langton would not have advised him to leave\nLondon if he had not considered that it was dangerous to remain.  He\ntherefore first called upon the Hamburgh merchant, who, upon his\nexplanation, gave him a letter of credit to a friend who resided in the\ncity of York; and then returned to the hotel, packed up his saddle-bags,\npaid his reckoning, and, mounting his horse, set off on the northern\nroad.  As it was late in the afternoon before he was clear of the\nmetropolis, he did not proceed farther than Barnet, where he pulled up\nat the inn.  As soon as he had seen his horse attended to, Edward, with\nhis saddle-bags on his arm, went into the room in the inn where all the\ntravellers congregated.  Having procured a bed and given his saddle-bags\ninto the charge of the hostess, he sat down by the fire, which, although\nit was warm weather, was nevertheless kept alight.\n\nEdward had made no alteration in the dress which he had worn since he\nhad been received in the house of Mr Heatherstone.  It was plain,\nalthough of good materials.  He wore a high-crowned hat, and altogether\nwould, from his attire, have been taken for one of the Roundhead party.\nHis sword and shoulder-belt were indeed of more gay appearance than\nthose usually worn by the Roundheads; but this was the only difference.\n\nWhen Edward first entered the room there were three persons in it, whose\nappearance was not very prepossessing.  They were dressed in what had\nonce been very gay attire, but which now exhibited tarnished lace,\nstains of wine, and dust from travelling.  They eyed him as he entered\nwith his saddle-bags, and one of them said--\"That's a fine horse you\nwere riding, sir.  Has he much speed?\"\n\n\"He has,\" replied Edward, as he turned away, and went into the bar to\nspeak with the hostess, and give his property into her care.\n\n\"Going north, sir?\" inquired the same person when Edward returned.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Edward, walking to the window to avoid further\nconversation.\n\n\"The Roundhead is on the stilts,\" observed another of the party.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the first; \"it is easy to see that he has not been\naccustomed to be addressed by gentlemen; for half a pin I would slit his\nears.\"\n\nEdward did not choose to reply; he folded his arms and looked at the man\nwith contempt.\n\nThe hostess, who had overheard the conversation, now called for her\nhusband, and desired him to go into the room and prevent any further\ninsults to the young gentleman who had just come in.  The host, who knew\nthe parties, entered the room, and said--\n\n\"Now you'll clear out of this as fast as you can; be off with you, and\ngo to the stables, or I'll send for somebody whom you will not like.\"\n\nThe three men rose and swaggered, but obeyed the host's orders, and left\nthe room.\n\n\"I am sorry, young Master, that these roysterers should have affronted\nyou, as my wife tells me that they have.  I did not know that they were\nin the house.  We cannot well refuse to take in their horses; but we\nknow well who they are, and, if you are travelling far, you had better\nride in company.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your caution, my good host,\" replied Edward; \"I thought\nthat they were highwaymen, or something of that sort.\"\n\n\"You have made a good guess, sir; but nothing has yet been proved\nagainst them, or they would not be here.  In these times we have strange\ncustomers, and hardly know who we take in.  You have a good sword there,\nsir, I have no doubt; but I trust that you have other arms.\"\n\n\"I have,\" replied Edward, opening his doublet and showing his pistols.\n\n\"That's right, sir.  Will you take anything before you go to bed?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will, for I am hungry; anything will do, with a pint of wine.\"\n\nAs soon as he had supped Edward asked the hostess for his saddle-bags,\nand went up to his bed.\n\nEarly the next morning he rose and went to the stable to see his horse\nfed.  The three men were in the stables, but they did not say anything\nto him.  Edward returned to the inn, called for breakfast, and, as soon\nas he had finished, took out his pistols to renew the priming.  While so\noccupied he happened to look up, and perceived one of the men with his\nface against the window, watching him.  \"Well, now you see what you have\nto expect, if you try your trade with me,\" thought Edward, \"I am very\nglad that you have been spying.\"  Having replaced his pistols, Edward\npaid his reckoning, and went to the stable desiring the ostler to saddle\nhis horse and fix on his saddle-bags.  As soon as this was done he\nmounted and rode off.  Before he was well clear of the town the\nhighwaymen cantered past him on three well-bred active horses.  \"I\npresume we shall meet again,\" thought Edward, who for some time cantered\nat a gentle rate, and then, as his horse was very fresh, he put him to a\nfaster pace, intending to do a long day's work.  He had ridden about\nfifteen miles, when he came to a heath, and, as he continued at a fast\ntrot, he perceived the three highwaymen about a quarter of a mile in\nadvance of him; they were descending a hill which was between them, and\nhe soon lost sight of them again.  Edward now pulled up his horse to let\nhim recover his wind, and walked him gently up the hill.  He had nearly\ngained the summit when he heard the report of firearms, and soon\nafterwards a man on horse back, in full speed, galloped over the hill\ntowards him.  He had a pistol in his hand, and his head turned back.\nThe reason for this was soon evident, as immediately after him appeared\nthe three highwaymen in pursuit.  One fired his pistol at the man who\nfled, and missed him.  The man then fired in return, and with true aim,\nas one of the highwaymen fell.  All this was so sudden that Edward had\nhardly time to draw his pistol and put spurs to his horse before the\nparties were upon him, and were passing him.  Edward levelled at the\nsecond highwayman as he passed him, and the man fell.  The third\nhighwayman, perceiving this, turned his horse to the side of the road,\ncleared a ditch, and galloped away across the heath.  The man who had\nbeen attacked had pulled up his horse when Edward came to his\nassistance, and now rode up to him, saying--\"I have to thank you, sir,\nfor your timely aid; for these rascals were too many for me.\"\n\n\"You are not hurt, I trust, sir?\" replied Edward.\n\n\"No, not the least; the fellow singed my curls though, as you may\nperceive.  They attacked me but half a mile from here.  I was proceeding\nnorth when I heard the clatter of hoofs behind me; I looked round, and\nsaw at once what they were, and I sprung my horse out of the road to a\nthicket close to it, that they might not surround me.  One of the three\nrode forward to stop my passage, and the other two rode round to the\nback of the thicket to get behind me.  I then saw that I had separated\nthem, and could gain a start upon them by riding back again, which I did\nas fast as I could, and they immediately gave chase.  The result you\nsaw.  Between us we have broken up the gang; for both these fellows seem\ndead, or nearly so.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\"Leave them where they are,\" replied the stranger.  \"I am in a hurry to\nget on.  I have important business at the city of York, and cannot waste\nmy time in depositions, and such nonsense.  It is only two scoundrels\nless in the world, and there's an end of the matter.\"\n\nAs Edward was equally anxious to proceed, he agreed with the stranger\nthat it was best to do as he proposed.\n\n\"I am also going north,\" replied Edward, \"and am anxious to get there as\nsoon as I can.\"\n\n\"With your permission we will ride together,\" said the stranger.  \"I\nshall be the gainer, as I shall feel that I have one with me who is to\nbe trusted to in case of any further attacks during our journey.\"\n\nThere was such a gentlemanlike, frank, and courteous air about the\nstranger, that Edward immediately assented to his proposal of their\nriding in company for mutual protection.  He was a powerful, well-made\nman, of apparently about one or two and twenty, remarkably handsome in\nperson, dressed richly, but not gaudily, in the cavalier fashion, and\nwore a hat with a feather.  As they proceeded, they entered into\nconversation on indifferent matters for some time, neither party\nattempting by any question to discover who his companion might be.\nEdward had more than once, when the conversation flagged for a minute,\nconsidered what reply he should give in case his companion should ask\nhim the cause of his journey, and at last had made up his mind what to\nsay.\n\nA little before noon they pulled up to bait their horses at a small\nvillage,--the stranger observing that he avoided Saint Alban's, and all\nother large towns, as he did not wish to satisfy the curiosity of\npeople, or to have his motions watched; and therefore, if Edward had no\nobjection, he knew the country so well that he could save time by\nallowing him to direct their path.  Edward was, as may be supposed, very\nagreeable to this, and during their whole journey they never entered a\ntown, except they rode through it after dark; and put up at humble inns\non the roadside, where, if not quite so well attended to, at all events\nthey were free from observation.\n\nIt was, however, impossible that this reserve could continue long, as\nthey became more and more intimate every day.  At last the stranger\nsaid--\"Master Armitage, we have travelled together for some time,\ninterchanging thoughts and feelings, but with due reserve as respects\nourselves and our own plans.  Is this to continue?  If so, of course you\nhave but to say so; but if you feel inclined to trust me, I have the\nsame feeling towards you.  By your dress I should imagine that you\nbelonged to a party to which I am opposed; but your language and manners\ndo not agree with your attire; and I think a hat and feathers would\ngrace that head better than the steeple-crowned affair which now covers\nit.  It may be that the dress is only assumed as a disguise: you know\nbest.  However, as I say, I feel confidence in you, to whatever party\nyou may belong, and I give you credit for your prudence and reserve in\nthese troubled times.  I am a little older than you, and may advise you;\nand I am indebted to you, and cannot therefore betray you--at least I\ntrust you believe so.\"\n\n\"I do believe it,\" replied Edward; \"and I will so far answer you, Master\nChaloner, that this attire of mine is not the one which I would wear if\nI had my choice.\"\n\n\"I believe that,\" replied Chaloner; \"and I cannot help thinking you are\nbound north on the same business as myself, which is, I confess to you\nhonestly, to strike a blow for the king.  If you are on the same errand,\nI have two old relations in Lancashire who are stanch to the cause; and\nI am going to their house to remain until I can join the army.  If you\nwish it, you shall come with me, and I will promise you kind treatment\nand safety while under their roof.\"\n\n\"And the names of these relatives of yours, Master Chaloner?\" said\nEdward.\n\n\"Nay, you shall have them; for when I trust, I trust wholly.  Their name\nis Conynghame.\"\n\nEdward took his letters from out of his side-pocket, and handed one of\nthem to his fellow-traveller.  The address was, \"To the worthy Mistress\nConynghame, of Portlake, near Bolton, county of Lancaster.\"\n\n\"It is to that address that I am going myself,\" said Edward, smiling.\n\"Whether it is the party you refer to you best know.\"\n\nChaloner burst out with a loud laugh.\n\n\"This is excellent!  Two people meet, both bound on the same business,\nboth going to the same rendezvous, and for three days do not venture to\ntrust each other.\"\n\n\"The times require caution,\" replied Edward, as he replaced his letter.\n\n\"You are right,\" answered Chaloner, \"and you are of my opinion.  I know\nnow that you have both prudence and courage.  The first quality has been\nscarcer with us Cavaliers than the last; however, now all reserve is\nover, at least on my part.\"\n\n\"And on mine also,\" replied Edward.\n\nChaloner then talked about the chances of the war.  He stated that King\nCharles's army was in a good state of discipline, and well found in\neverything; that there were hundreds in England who would join it, as\nsoon as it had advanced far enough into England; and that everything\nwore a promising appearance.\n\n\"My father fell at the battle of Naseby, at the head of his retainers,\"\nsaid Chaloner, after a pause; \"and they have contrived to fine the\nproperty, so that it has dwindled from thousands down to hundreds.\nIndeed, were it not for my good old aunts, who will leave me their\nestates, and who now supply me liberally, I should be but a poor\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"Your father fell at Naseby?\" said Edward.  \"Were you there?\"\n\n\"I was,\" replied Chaloner.\n\n\"My father also fell at Naseby,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Your father did?\" replied Chaloner, \"I do not recollect the name--\nArmitage--he was not in command there, was he?\" continued Chaloner.\n\n\"Yes, he was,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"There was none of that name among the officers that I can recollect,\nyoung sir,\" replied Chaloner, with an air of distrust.  \"Surely you have\nbeen misinformed.\"\n\n\"I have spoken the truth,\" replied Edward; \"and have now said so much\nthat I must, to remove your suspicion, say more than perhaps I should\nhave done.  My name is not Armitage, although I have been so called for\nsome time.  You have set me the example of confidence, and I will follow\nit.  My father was Colonel Beverley, of Prince Rupert's troop.\"\n\nChaloner started with astonishment.\n\n\"I'm sure that what you say is true,\" at last said he; \"for I was\nthinking who it was that you reminded me of.  You are the very picture\nof your father.  Although a boy at the time, I knew him well, Master\nBeverley; a more gallant Cavalier never drew sword.  Come, we must be\nsworn friends in life and death, Beverley,\" continued Chaloner,\nextending his hand, which was eagerly grasped by Edward, who then\nconfided to Chaloner the history of his life.  When he had concluded,\nChaloner said--\"We all heard of the firing of Arnwood, and it is at this\nmoment believed that all the children perished.  It is one of the tales\nof woe that our nurses repeat to the children, and many a child has wept\nat your supposed deaths.  But tell me, now, had you not fallen in with\nme, was it your intention to have joined the army under your assumed\nname of Armitage?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what I intended to do.  I wanted a friend to advise me.\"\n\n\"And you have found one, Beverley.  I owe my life to you, and I will\nrepay the debt as far as is in my power.  You must not conceal your name\nto your sovereign; the very name of Beverley is a passport; but the son\nof Colonel Beverley will be indeed welcomed.  Why, the very name will be\nconsidered as a harbinger of good fortune.  Your father was the best and\ntruest soldier that ever drew sword; and his memory stands unrivalled\nfor loyalty and devotion.  We are near to the end of our journey; yonder\nis the steeple of Bolton church.  The old ladies will be out of their\nwits when they find that they have a Beverley under their roof.\"\n\nEdward was much delighted at this tribute paid to his father's memory,\nand the tears more than once started into his eyes as Chaloner renewed\nhis praise.\n\nLate in the evening they arrived at Portlake, a grand old mansion,\nsituated in a park crowded with fine old timber.  Chaloner was\nrecognised as they rode up the avenue by one of the keepers, who\nhastened forward to announce his arrival; and the domestics had opened\nthe door for them before they arrived at it.  In the hall they were met\nby the old ladies, who expressed their delight at seeing their nephew,\nas they had had great fear that something had happened to him.\n\n\"And something did very nearly happen to me,\" replied Chaloner, \"had it\nnot been for the timely assistance of my friend here, who,\nnotwithstanding his Puritan attire, I hardly need tell you is a Cavalier\ndevoted to the good cause, when I state that he is the son of Colonel\nBeverley, who fell at Naseby with my good father.\"\n\n\"No one can be more welcome, then,\" replied the old ladies, who extended\ntheir hands to Edward.  They then went into a sitting-room, and supper\nwas ordered to be sent up immediately.\n\n\"Our horses will be well attended to, Edward,\" said Chaloner; \"we need\nnot any longer look after them ourselves.  And now, good aunts, have you\nno letters for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, there are several; but you had better eat first.\"\n\n\"Not so; let me have the letters; we can read them before supper, and\ntalk them over when at table.\"\n\nOne of the ladies produced the letters, which Chaloner, as he read them,\nhanded over to Edward for his perusal.  They were from General\nMiddleton, and some other friends of Chaloner's who were with the army,\ngiving him information as to what was going on, and what their prospects\nwere supposed to be.\n\n\"You see that they have marched already,\" said Chaloner, \"and I think\nthe plan is a good one, and it has put General Cromwell in an awkward\nposition.  Our army is now between his and London, with three days march\nin advance.  And we shall now be able to pick up our English adherents,\nwho can join us without risk, as we go along.  It has been a bold step,\nbut a good one; and if they only continue as well as they have begun we\nshall succeed.  The Parliamentary army is not equal to ours in numbers,\nas it is; and we shall add to ours daily.  The king has sent to the Isle\nof Man for the Earl of Derby, who is expected to join to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And where is the army at this moment?\" inquired Edward.\n\n\"They will be but a few miles from us to-night, their march is so rapid;\nto-morrow we will join if it pleases.\"\n\n\"Most willingly,\" replied Edward.\n\nAfter an hour's more conversation, they were shown into their rooms, and\nretired for the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\n\nThe next morning, before they had quitted their beds, a messenger\narrived with letters from General Middleton, and from him they found\nthat the king's army had encamped on the evening before not six miles\nfrom Portlake.  As they hastily dressed themselves, Chaloner proposed to\nEdward that a little alteration in his dress would be necessary; and\ntaking him to a wardrobe in which had been put aside some suits of his\nown, worn when he was a younger and slighter-made man than he now was,\nhe requested Edward to make use of them.  Edward, who was aware that\nChaloner was right in his proposal, selected two suits of colours which\npleased him most; and dressing in one, and changing his hat for one more\nbefitting his new attire, was transformed into a handsome Cavalier.  As\nsoon as they had broken their fast they took leave of the old ladies,\nand, mounting their horses, set off for the camp.  An hour's ride\nbrought them to the outposts; and communicating with the officer on\nduty, they were conducted by an orderly to the tent of General\nMiddleton, who received Chaloner with great warmth as an old friend, and\nwas very courteous to Edward as soon as he heard that he was the son of\nColonel Beverley.\n\n\"I have wanted you, Chaloner,\" said Middleton; \"we are raising a troop\nof horse; the Duke of Buckingham commands it, but Massey will be the\nreal leader of it; you have influence in this county, and will, I have\nno doubt, bring us many good hands.\"\n\n\"Where is the Earl of Derby?\"\n\n\"Joined us this morning; we have marched so quick that we have not had\ntime to pick our adherents up.\"\n\n\"And General Lesley?\"\n\n\"Is by no means in good spirits: why I know not.  We have too many\nministers with his army, that is certain, and they do harm; but we\ncannot help ourselves.  His majesty must be visible by this time; if you\nare ready I will introduce you; and when that is done we will talk\nmatters over.\"\n\nGeneral Middleton then walked with them to the house in which the king\nhad taken up his quarters for the night; and after a few minutes'\nwaiting in the anteroom they were admitted into his presence.\n\n\"Allow me, your majesty,\" said General Middleton, after the first\nsalutations, \"to present to you Major Chaloner, whose father's name is\nnot unknown to you.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, well-known to us,\" replied the king, \"as a loyal and\nfaithful subject, whose loss we must deplore.  I have no doubt that his\nson inherits his courage and his fidelity.\"\n\nThe king held out his hand, and Chaloner bent his knee and kissed it.\n\n\"And now, your majesty will be surprised that I should present to you\none of a house supposed to be extinct--the eldest son of Colonel\nBeverley.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied his majesty; \"I heard that all his family perished at\nthe ruthless burning of Arnwood.  I hold myself fortunate, as a king,\nthat even one son of so loyal and brave a gentleman as Colonel Beverley\nhas escaped.  You are welcome, young sir--most welcome to us; you must\nbe near us; the very name of Beverley will be pleasing to our ears by\nnight or day.\"\n\nEdward knelt down and kissed his majesty's hand, and the king said--\n\n\"What can we do for a Beverley?  Let us know, that we may show our\nfeelings towards his father's memory?\"\n\n\"All I request is, that your majesty will allow me to be near you in the\nhour of danger,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"A right Beverley reply,\" said the king, \"and so we shall see to it,\nMiddleton.\"\n\nAfter a few more courteous words from his majesty they withdrew; but\nGeneral Middleton was recalled by the king for a minute or two to\nreceive his commands.  When he rejoined Edward and Chaloner, he said to\nEdward--\n\n\"I have orders to send in for his majesty's signature your commission as\ncaptain of horse, and attached to the king's personal staff; it is a\nhigh compliment to the memory of your father, sir, and, I may add, your\nown personal appearance.  Chaloner will see to your uniforms and\naccoutrements; you are well mounted, I believe you have no time to lose,\nas we march to-morrow for Warrington, in Cheshire.\"\n\n\"Has anything been heard of the Parliamentary army?\"\n\n\"Yes; they are on the march towards London by the Yorkshire road,\nintending to cut us off if they can.  And now, gentlemen, farewell; for\nI have no idle time, I assure you.\"\n\nEdward was soon equipped, and now attended upon the king.  When they\narrived at Warrington they found a body of horse drawn up to oppose\ntheir passage onwards.  These were charged, and fled with a trifling\nloss; and as they were known to be commanded by Lambert, one of\nCromwell's best generals, there was great exultation in the king's army;\nbut the fact was that Lambert had acted upon Cromwell's orders, which\nwere, to harass and delay the march of the king as much as possible, but\nnot to risk with his small force anything like an engagement.  After\nthis skirmish it was considered advisable to send back the Earl of Derby\nand many other officers of importance into Lancashire, that they might\ncollect the king's adherents in that quarter and in Cheshire.\nAccordingly the earl, with about two hundred officers and gentlemen,\nleft the army with that intention.  It was then considered that it would\nbe advisable to march the army direct to London; but the men were so\nfatigued with the rapidity of the march up to the present time, and the\nweather was so warm, that it was decided in the negative; and as\nWorcester was a town well affected to the king, and the country abounded\nwith provisions, it was resolved that the army should march there, and\nwait for English reinforcements.  This was done; the city opened the\ngates with every mark of satisfaction, and supplied the army with all\nthat it required.  The first bad news which reached them was the\ndispersion and defeat of the whole of the Earl of Derby's party by a\nregiment of militia, which had surprised them at Wigan during the night,\nwhen they were all asleep, and had no idea that any enemy was near to\nthem.  Although attacked at such a disadvantage, they defended\nthemselves till a large portion of them were killed, and the remainder\nwere taken prisoners, and most of them brutally put to death.  The Earl\nof Derby was made a prisoner, but not put to death with the others.\n\n\"This is bad news, Chaloner,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Yes; it is more than bad,\" replied the latter; \"we have lost our best\nofficers, who never should have left the army; and now, the consequences\nof the defeat will be that we shall not have any people coming forward\nto join us.  The winning side is the right side in this world; and there\nis more evil than that: the Duke of Buckingham has claimed the command\nof the army, which the king has refused; so that we are beginning to\nfight among ourselves.  General Lesley is evidently dispirited, and\nthinks bad of the cause.  Middleton is the only man who does his duty.\nDepend upon it we shall have Cromwell upon us before we are aware of it;\nand we are in a state of sad confusion--officers quarrelling, men\ndisobedient, much talking, and little doing.  Here we have been five\ndays, and the works, which have been proposed to be thrown up as\ndefences, not yet begun.\"\n\n\"I cannot but admire the patience of the king, with so much to harass\nand annoy him.\"\n\n\"He must be patient, perforce,\" replied Chaloner; \"he plays for a crown,\nand it is a high stake; but he cannot command the minds of men, although\nhe may the persons.  I am no croaker, Beverley; but this I do say, that\nif we succeed with this army, as it is at present disorganised, we shall\nperform a miracle.\"\n\n\"We must hope for the best,\" replied Edward; \"common danger may cement\nthose who would otherwise be asunder; and when they have the army of\nCromwell before them, they may be induced to forget their private\nquarrels and jealousies and unite in the good cause.\"\n\n\"I wish I could be of your opinion, Beverley,\" replied Chaloner; \"but I\nhave mixed with the world longer than you have, and I think otherwise.\"\n\nSeveral more days passed, during which no defences were thrown up, and\nthe confusion and quarrelling in the army continued to increase, until\nat last news arrived that Cromwell was within half a day's march of\nthem, and that he had collected all the militia on his route, and was\nnow in numbers nearly double to those in the king's army.  All was\namazement and confusion--nothing had been done--no arrangements had been\nmade--and Chaloner told Edward that all was lost if immediate steps were\nnot taken.\n\nOn the 3rd of October the army of Cromwell appeared in sight.  Edward\nhad been on horseback, attending the king, for the best part of the\nnight; the disposition of the troops had been made as well as it could;\nand it was concluded, as Cromwell's army remained quiet, that no attempt\nwould be made on that day.  About noon the king returned to his lodging,\nto take some refreshment after his fatigue.  Edward was with him; but\nbefore an hour had passed the alarm came that the armies were engaged.\nThe king mounted his horse, which was ready saddled at the door; but\nbefore he could ride out of the city he was met and nearly beaten back\nby the whole body almost of his own cavalry, who came running on with\nsuch force that he could not stop them.  His majesty called to several\nof the officers by name, but they paid no attention; and so great was\nthe panic, that both the king, and his staff who attended him, were\nnearly overthrown and trampled under foot.\n\nCromwell had passed a large portion of his troops over the river without\nthe knowledge of his opponents, and when the attack was made in so\nunexpected a quarter a panic ensued.  Where General Middleton and the\nDuke of Hamilton commanded, a very brave resistance was made; but\nMiddleton being wounded, and the Duke of Hamilton having had his leg\ntaken off by a round shot, and many gentlemen having fallen, the troops,\ndeserted by the remainder of the army, at last gave way, and the rout\nwas general, the foot throwing away their muskets before they were\ndischarged.\n\nHis majesty rode back into the town and found a body of horse, who had\nbeen persuaded by Chaloner to make a stand.  \"Follow me,\" said his\nmajesty, \"we will see what the enemy are about.  I do not think they\npursue, and if so, we may yet rally from this foolish panic.\"\n\nHis majesty, followed by Edward, Chaloner, and several of his personal\nstaff, then galloped out to reconnoitre; but to his mortification he\nfound that the troops had not followed him, but gone out of the town by\nthe other gate, and that the enemy's cavalry in pursuit were actually in\nthe town.  Under such circumstances, by the advice of Chaloner and\nEdward, his majesty withdrew, and turning his horse's head he made all\nhaste to leave Worcester.  After several hours' riding, the king found\nhimself in company of about 4000 of the cavalry who had so disgracefully\nfled; but they were still so panic-struck that he could put no\nconfidence in them, and having advised with those about him he resolved\nto quit them.  This he did without mentioning his intentions to any of\nhis staff, not even Chaloner or Edward, leaving at night with two of his\nservants, whom he dismissed as soon as it was daylight, considering that\nhis chance of escape would be greater if he was quite alone.\n\nIt was not till next morning that the troops discovered that the king\nhad left them, and then they determined to separate, and as the major\nportion were from Scotland to make what haste they could back to that\ncountry.  And now Chaloner and Edward consulted as to their plans.\n\n\"It appears to me,\" said Edward, laughing, \"that the danger of this\ncampaign of ours will consist in getting back again to our own homes;\nfor I can most safely assert that I have not as yet struck a blow for\nthe king.\"\n\n\"That is true enough, Beverley.  When do you purpose going back to the\nNew Forest?  I think, if you will permit me, I will accompany you,\" said\nChaloner.  \"All the pursuit will be to the northward to intercept and\novertake the retreat into Scotland.  I cannot therefore go to\nLancashire; and indeed, as they know that I am out, they will be looking\nfor me everywhere.\"\n\n\"Then come with me,\" said Edward; \"I will find you protection till you\ncan decide what to do.  Let us ride on away from this, and we will talk\nover the matter as we go; but depend upon it, the farther south we get\nthe safer we shall be; but still not safe, unless we can change our\ncostume.  There will be a strict search for the king to the south, as\nthey will presume that he will try to get safe to France.  Hark!  What\nis that?  I heard the report of arms.  Let us ride up this hill and see\nwhat is going on.\"\n\nThey did so, and perceived that there was a skirmish between a party of\nCavaliers and some of the Parliamentary cavalry at about a quarter of a\nmile distant.\n\n\"Come, Chaloner, let us at all events have one blow,\" said Edward.\n\n\"Agreed,\" replied Chaloner, spurring his horse; and down they went at\nfull speed, and in a minute were in the _melee_, coming on the rear of\nthe Parliamentary troops.\n\nThis sudden attack from behind decided the affair.  The Parliamentary\ntroopers, thinking that there were wore than two coming upon them, made\noff after another minute's combat, leaving five or six of their men on\nthe ground.\n\n\"Thanks, Chaloner thanks, Beverley!\" said a voice, which they\nimmediately recognised.  It was that of one of the king's pages.  \"These\nfellows with me were just about to run if you had not come to our aid.\nI will remain with them no longer, but join you if you will permit me.\"\n\n\"At all events remain here till they go away--I will send them off.\"\n\n\"My lads, you must all separate, or there will be no chance of escape.\nNo more than two should ride together.  Depend upon it we shall have\nmore of the troops here directly.\"\n\nThe men, about fifteen in number, who had been in company with\nGrenville, considered that Chaloner's advice was good, and without\nceremony set off with their horses' heads to the northward, leaving\nChaloner, Edward, and Grenville together on the field of the affray.  A\ndozen men were lying on the ground, either dead or severely wounded;\nseven of them were of the king's party, and the other five of the\nParliamentary troops.\n\n\"Now what I propose,\" said Edward, \"is this,--let us do what we can for\nthose who are wounded, and then strip off the dresses and accoutrements\nof those Parliamentary dragoons who are dead, and dress ourselves in\nthem, accoutrements and all.  We can then pass through the country in\nsafety, as we shall be supposed to be one of the parties looking for the\nking.\"\n\n\"That is a good idea,\" replied Chaloner, \"and the sooner it is done the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Edward, wiping his sword, which he still held drawn, and\nthen sheathing it, \"I will take the spoils of this fellow nearest to me:\nhe fell by my hand, and I am entitled to them by all the laws of war and\nchivalry; but first let us dismount and look to the wounded.\"\n\nThey tied their horses to a tree, and having given what assistance they\ncould to the wounded men, they proceeded to strip three of the\nParliamentary troopers; and then, laying aside their own habiliments,\nthey dressed themselves in the uniform of the enemy, and mounting their\nhorses made all haste from the place.  Having gained about twelve miles,\nthey pulled up and rode at a more leisurely pace.  It was now eight\no'clock in the evening, but still not very dark; they therefore rode on\nanother five miles, till they came to a small village, where they\ndismounted at an ale-house, and put their horses into the stable.\n\n\"We must be insolent and brutal in our manners, or we shall be\nsuspected.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Grenville, giving the ostler a kick and telling him to\nbestir himself if he did not want his ears cropped.\n\nThey entered the ale-house, and soon found out they were held in great\nterror.  They ordered everything of the best to be produced, and\nthreatened to set fire to the house if it was not; they turned the man\nand his wife out of their bed, and all three went to sleep in it; and,\nin short, they behaved in such an arbitrary manner that nobody doubted\nthat they were Cromwell's men.  In the morning they set off again, by\nChaloner's advice paying for nothing that they had ordered, although\nthey had all of them plenty of money.  They now rode fast, inquiring at\nthe places which they passed through whether any fugitives had been\nseen, and if they came to a town, inquiring, before they entered,\nwhether there were any Parliamentary troops.  So well did they manage,\nthat after four days they had gained the skirts of the New Forest, and\nconcealed themselves in a thicket till night-time, when Edward proposed\nthat he should conduct his fellow-travellers to the cottage, where he\nwould leave them till his plans were arranged.\n\nEdward had already arranged his plans.  His great object was to ward off\nany suspicion of where he had been, and of course any idea that the\nIntendant had been a party to his acts; and the fortunate change of his\ndress enabled him now to do so with success.  He had decided to conduct\nhis two friends to the cottage that night, and the next morning to ride\nover in his Parliamentary costume to the Intendant's house, and bring\nthe first news of the success of Cromwell and the defeat at Worcester;\nby which stratagem it would appear as if he had been with the\nParliamentary, and not with the Royalist army.\n\nAs they had travelled along, they found that the news of Cromwell's\nsuccess had not yet arrived: in those times there was not the rapidity\nof communication that we now have, and Edward thought it very probable\nthat he would be the first to communicate the intelligence to the\nIntendant and those who resided near him.\n\nAs soon as it was dusk the three travellers left their retreat, and,\nguided by Edward, soon arrived at the cottage.  Their appearance at\nfirst created no little consternation, for Humphrey and Pablo happened\nto be in the yard when they heard the clattering of the swords and\naccoutrements, and through the gloom observed, as they advanced, that\nthe party were troopers.  At first Humphrey was for running on and\nbarring the door, but, on a second reflection, he felt that he could not\ndo a more imprudent thing, if there was danger; and he therefore\ncontented himself with hastily imparting the intelligence to his\nsisters, and then remaining at the threshold to meet the coming of the\nparties.  The voice of Edward calling him by name dissipated all alarm,\nand in another minute he was in the arms of his brother and sisters.\n\n\"First let us take our horses to the stable, Humphrey,\" said Edward,\nafter the first greeting was over, \"and then we will come and partake of\nanything that Alice can prepare for us, for we have not fared over well\nfor the last three days.\"\n\nAccompanied by Humphrey and Pablo, they all went to the stables, and\nturned out the ponies to make room for the horses; and as soon as they\nwere all fed and littered down they returned to the cottage, and\nChaloner and Grenville were introduced.  Supper was soon on the table,\nand they were too hungry to talk while they were eating, so but little\ninformation was gleaned from them that night.  However, previous to\nAlice and Edith leaving the room to prepare beds for the newcomers,\nHumphrey ascertained that all was lost, and that they had escaped from\nthe field.  When the beds were ready, Chaloner and Grenville retired,\nand then Edward remained half an hour with Humphrey, to communicate to\nhim what had passed.  Of course he could not enter into detail; but told\nhim that he would get information from their new guests after he had\nleft, which he must do early in the morning.\n\n\"And now, Humphrey, my advice is this: My two friends cannot remain in\nthis cottage, for many reasons; but we have the key of Clara's cottage,\nand they can take up their lodging there, and we can supply them with\nall they want until they find means of going abroad, which is their\nintention.  I must be off to the Intendant's to-morrow, and the day\nafter I will come over to you.  In the meantime our guests can remain\nhere, while you and Pablo prepare the cottage for them; and when I\nreturn everything shall be settled, and we will conduct them to it.  I\ndo not think there is much danger of their being discovered while they\nremain there, certainly not so much as if they were here; for we must\nexpect parties of troops in every direction now, as they were when the\nking's father made his escape from Hampton Court.  And now to bed, my\ngood brother; and call me early, for I much fear that I shall not wake\nup, if you do not.\"\n\nThe brothers then parted for the night.\n\nThe next morning, long before their guests were awake, Edward had been\ncalled by Humphrey, and found Pablo at the door with his horse.  Edward,\nwho had put on his Parliamentary accoutrements, bade a hasty farewell to\nthem, and set off across the forest to the house of the Intendant, where\nhe arrived before they had left their bedrooms.  The first person he\nencountered was, very fortunately, Oswald, who was at his cottage-door.\nEdward beckoned to him, being then about one hundred yards off; but\nOswald did not recognise him at first, and advanced towards him in a\nvery leisurely manner, to ascertain what the trooper might wish to\ninquire.  But Edward called him Oswald, and that was sufficient.  In few\nwords Edward told him how all was lost, and how he had escaped by\nchanging clothes with one of the enemy.\n\n\"I am now come to bring the news to the Intendant, Oswald.  You\nunderstand me, of course?\"\n\n\"Of course I do, Master Edward, and will take care that it is well-known\nthat you have been fighting by the side of Cromwell all this time.  I\nshould recommend you to show yourself in this dress for the remainder of\nthe day, and then every one will be satisfied.  Shall I go to the\nIntendant's before you?\"\n\n\"No, no, Oswald; the Intendant does not require me to be introduced to\nhim, of course.  I must now gallop up to his house and announce myself.\nFarewell for the present--I shall see you during the day.\"\n\nEdward put spurs to his horse, and arrived at the Intendant's at full\nspeed, making no small clattering in the yard below as he went in, much\nto the surprise of Sampson, who came out to ascertain what was the\ncause, and who was not a little surprised at perceiving Edward, who\nthrew himself off the horse, and desiring Sampson to take it to the\nstable, entered the kitchen, and disturbed Phoebe, who was preparing\nbreakfast.  Without speaking to her, Edward passed on to the Intendant's\nroom, and knocked.\n\n\"_Who_ is there?\" said the Intendant.\n\n\"Edward Armitage,\" was the reply, and the door was opened.  The\nIntendant started back at the sight of Edward in the trooper's costume.\n\n\"My dear Edward, I am glad to see you in any dress; but this requires\nexplanation.  Sit down and tell me all.\"\n\n\"All is soon told, sir,\" replied Edward, taking off his iron skull-cap,\nand allowing his hair to fall down on his shoulders.\n\nHe then, in few words, stated what had happened, and by what means he\nhad escaped, and the reason why he had kept on the trooper's\naccoutrements and made his appearance in them.\n\n\"You have done very prudently,\" replied the Intendant, \"and you have\nprobably saved me; at all events you have warded off all suspicion, and\nthose who are spies upon me will now have nothing to report except to my\nfavour.  Your absence has been commented upon, and made known at high\nquarters, and suspicion has arisen in consequence.  Your return as one\nof the Parliamentary forces will now put an end to all ill-natured\nremarks.  My dear Edward, you have done me a service.  As my secretary,\nand having been known to have been a follower of the Beverleys, your\nabsence was considered strange, and it was intimated at high quarters\nthat you had gone to join the king's forces, and that with my knowledge\nand consent.  This I have from Langton; and it has in consequence\ninjured me not a little: but now your appearance will make all right\nagain.  Now we will first to prayers, and then to breakfast; and after\nthat we will have a more detailed account of what has taken place since\nyour departure.  Patience and Clara will not be sorry to recover their\ncompanion; but how they will like you in that dress I cannot pretend to\nsay.  However, I thank God that you have returned safe to us; and I\nshall be most happy to see you once more attend in the more peaceful\ngarb of a secretary.\"\n\n\"I will, with your permission, sir, not quit this costume for one day,\nas it may be as well that I should be seen in it.\"\n\n\"You are right, Edward: for this day retain it; to-morrow you will\nresume your usual costume.  Go down to the parlour; you will find\nPatience and Clara anxiously waiting for you, I have no doubt.  I will\njoin you there in ten minutes.\"\n\nEdward left the room, and went downstairs.  It hardly need be said how\njoyfully he was received by Patience and Clara.  The former, however,\nexpressed her joy in tears--the latter in wild mirth.\n\nWe will pass over the explanations and the narrative of what had\noccurred, which was given by Edward to Mr Heatherstone in his own room.\nThe Intendant said, as he concluded--\n\n\"Edward, you must now perceive that, for the present, nothing more can\nbe done; if it pleases the Lord, the time will come when the monarch\nwill be reseated on his throne; at present, we must bow to the powers\nthat be; and I tell you frankly it is my opinion that Cromwell aims at\nsovereignty, and will obtain it.  Perhaps it may be better that we\nshould suffer the infliction for a time, as for a time only can it be\nupheld, and it may be the cause of the king being more schooled and more\nfitted to reign than, by what you have told me in the course of your\nnarrative, he at present appears to be.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, sir,\" replied Edward.  \"I must say that the short campaign\nI have gone through has very much opened my eyes.  I have seen but\nlittle true chivalric feeling, and much of interested motives, in those\nwho have joined the king's forces.  The army collected was composed of\nmost discordant elements, and were so discontented, so full of jealousy\nand ill-will, that I am not surprised at the result.  One thing is\ncertain, that there must be a much better feeling existing between all\nparties, before such a man as Cromwell can ever be moved from his\nposition; and, for the present, the cause may be considered as lost.\"\n\n\"You are right, Edward,\" replied the Intendant; \"I would they were\nbetter; but, as they are, let us make the best of them.  You have now\nseen enough to have subdued that fiery zeal for the cause which\npreviously occupied your whole thoughts; now let us be prudent, and try\nif we cannot be happy.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\n\nIt was only to Oswald that Edward made known what had occurred; he knew\nthat he was to be trusted.  The next day Edward resumed his forester's\ndress, while another one was preparing for him, and went over to the\ncottage; where, with the consent of the Intendant, he proposed remaining\nfor a few days.  Of course Edward had not failed to acquaint the\nIntendant with his proposed plans relative to Chaloner and Grenville,\nand received his consent; at the same time advising that they should\ngain the other side of the Channel as soon as they possibly could.\nEdward found them all very anxious for his arrival.  Humphrey and Pablo\nhad been to the cottage, which they had found undisturbed since the\ncapture of the robbers, and made everything ready for the reception of\nthe two Cavaliers, as on their first journey they took with them a\ncart-load of what they knew would be necessary.  Chaloner and Grenville\nappeared to be quite at home already, and not very willing to shift\ntheir quarters.  They, of course, still retained their troopers'\nclothes, as they had no other to wear until they could be procured from\nLymington; but, as we have before mentioned, they were in no want of\nmoney.  They, had been amusing the girls and Humphrey with a description\nof what had occurred during the campaign, and Edward found that he had\nbut little to tell them, as Chaloner had commenced his narrative with an\naccount of his first meeting with Edward when he had been attacked by\nthe highwaymen.  As soon as he could get away, Edward went out with\nHumphrey to have some conversation with him.\n\n\"Now, Humphrey, as you have pretty well heard all my adventures since\nour separation, let me hear what you have been doing.\"\n\n\"I have no such tales of stirring interest to narrate as Chaloner has\nbeen doing as your deputy, Edward,\" replied Humphrey.  \"All I can say\nis, that we have had no visitors--that we have longed for your return--\nand that we have not been idle since you quitted us.\"\n\n\"What horses were those in the stable,\" said Edward, \"that you turned\nout to make room for ours when we arrived?\"\n\nHumphrey laughed, and then informed Edward of the manner in which they\nhad succeeded in capturing them.\n\n\"Well, you really deserve credit, Humphrey, and certainly were not born\nto be secluded in this forest.\"\n\n\"I rather think that I have found that I was born for it,\" replied\nHumphrey, \"although, I must confess, that since you have quitted us I\nhave not felt so contented here as I did before.  You have returned, and\nyou have no idea what an alteration I see in you since you have mixed\nwith the world, and have been a party in such stirring scenes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, Humphrey,\" replied Edward; \"and yet do you know that,\nalthough I so ardently wished to mix with the world, and to follow the\nwars, I am anything but satisfied with what I have seen of it; and so\nfar from feeling any inclination to return to it I rather feel more\ninclined to remain here, and remain in quiet and in peace.  I have been\ndisappointed, that is the truth.  There is a great difference between\nthe world such as we fancy it when we are pining for it, and the world\nwhen we actually are placed within the vortex, and perceive the secret\nsprings of men's actions.  I have gained a lesson, but not a\nsatisfactory one, Humphrey; it may be told in a very few words.  It is a\nmost deceitful and hollow world!  And that is all there is to be said.\"\n\n\"What very agreeable, pleasant young men are Masters Chaloner and\nGrenville,\" observed Humphrey.\n\n\"Chaloner I know well,\" replied Edward; \"he is to be trusted, and he is\nthe only one in whom I have been able to place confidence, and therefore\nI was most fortunate in falling in with him as I did on my first\nstarting.  Grenville I know little about; we met often, it is true, but\nit was in the presence of the king, being both of us on his staff; at\nthe same time, I must acknowledge that I know nothing against him; and\nthis I do know, which is, that he is brave.\"\n\nEdward then narrated what had passed between the Intendant and himself\nsince his return; and how well satisfied the Intendant had been with his\n_ruse_ in returning to him in the dress of a trooper.\n\n\"Talking about that, Edward, do you not think it likely that we shall\nhave the troopers down here in search of the king?\"\n\n\"I wonder you have not had them already,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"And what shall we do if they arrive?\"\n\n\"That is all prepared for,\" replied Edward; \"although, till you\nmentioned it, I had quite forgotten it.  The Intendant was talking with\nme on the subject last night, and here is an appointment for you as\nverderer, signed by him, which you are to use as you may find necessary;\nand here is another missive, ordering you to receive into your house two\nof the troopers who may be sent down here, and find them quarters and\nvictuals, but not to be compelled to receive more.  Until the search is\nover, Chaloner and Grenville must retain their accoutrements and remain\nwith us: And, Humphrey, if you have not made any use of the clothes\nwhich I left here--I mean the first dress I had made when I was\nappointed secretary, and which I thought rather too faded to wear any\nlonger--I will put it on now, as, should any military come here as\nscouters to the Intendant, I shall have some authority over them.\"\n\n\"It is in your chest, where you left it, Edward.  The girls did propose\nto make two josephs out of it for winter wear; but they never have\nthought of it since, or have not had time.  By the bye, you have not\ntold me what you think of Alice and Edith after your long absence.\"\n\n\"I think they are both very much grown and very much improved,\" replied\nEdward, \"but I must confess to you that I think it is high time that\nthey were, if possible, removed from their present homely occupations,\nand instructed as young ladies should be.\"\n\n\"But how, Edward, is that to be?\"\n\n\"That I cannot yet tell, and it grieves me that I cannot; but still I\nsee the necessity of it, if ever we are to return to our position in\nsociety.\"\n\n\"And are we ever to return?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I thought little of it before I went away and mixed in\nsociety; but since I have been in the world I have been compelled to\nfeel that my dear sisters are not in their sphere, and I have resolved\nupon trying if I cannot find a more suitable position for them.  Had we\nbeen successful I should have had no difficulty: but now I hardly know\nwhat to do.\"\n\n\"I have not inquired about Mrs Patience, brother; how is she?\"\n\n\"She is as good and as handsome as ever, and very much grown; indeed,\nshe is becoming quite womanly.\"\n\n\"And Clara?\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not perceive any difference in her: I think she is grown, but\nI hardly observed her.  Here comes Chaloner; we will tell him of our\narrangements in case we are disturbed by the military parties.\"\n\n\"It is a most excellent arrangement,\" said Chaloner, when Edward had\nmade the communication; \"and it was a lucky day when I first fell in\nwith you, Beverley.\"\n\n\"Not Beverley, I pray you; that name is to be forgotten; it was only\nrevived for the occasion.\"\n\n\"Very true; then, Master Secretary Armitage, I think the arrangement\nexcellent: the only point will be to find out what troops are sent down\nin this direction, as we must of course belong to some other regiment,\nand have been pursued from the field of battle.  I should think that\nLambert's squadrons will not be this way.\"\n\n\"We will soon ascertain that; let your horses be saddled and accoutred,\nso that should any of them make their appearance the horses may be at\nthe door.  It is my opinion that they will be here some time to-day.\"\n\n\"I fear that it will be almost impossible for the king to escape,\"\nobserved Chaloner.\n\n\"I hardly know what to think of his leaving us in that way.\"\n\n\"I have reflected upon it,\" replied Edward, \"and I think it was perhaps\nprudent: some were to be trusted, and some not; it was impossible to\nknow who were and who were not--he therefore trusted nobody.  Besides,\nhis chance of escape, if quite alone, is greater than if in company.\"\n\n\"And yet I feel a little mortified that he did not trust me,\" continued\nEdward; \"my life was at his service.\"\n\n\"He could no more read your heart than he could mine or others,\"\nobserved Chaloner; \"and any selection would have been invidious: on the\nwhole, I think he acted wisely, and I trust that it will prove so.  One\nthing is certain, which is, that all is over now, and that for a long\nwhile--we may let our swords rest in their scabbards.  Indeed, I am\nsickened with it, after what I have seen, and would gladly live here\nwith you, and help to till the land--away from the world and all its\nvexations.  What say you, Edward; will you and your brother take me as a\nlabourer after all is quiet again?\"\n\n\"You would soon tire of it, Chaloner; you were made for active exertion\nand bustling in the world.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I think, under two such amiable and pretty mistresses, I\ncould stay well contented here: it is almost Arcadian.  But still it is\nselfish for me to talk in this way; indeed, my feelings are contrary to\nmy words.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Chaloner?\"\n\n\"To be candid with you, Edward, I was thinking what a pity it is that\ntwo such sweet girls as your sisters should be employed here in domestic\ndrudgery, and remain in such an uncultivated state--if I may be pardoned\nfor speaking so freely--but I do so because I am convinced that, if in\nproper hands, they would grace a court; and you must feel that I am\nright.\"\n\n\"Do you not think that the same feelings have passed in my mind,\nChaloner?  Indeed, Humphrey will tell you that we were speaking on the\nsame subject but an hour ago.  You must, however, be aware of the\ndifficulty I am in: were I in possession of Arnwood and its domain, then\nindeed--but that is all over now, and I presume I shall shortly see my\nown property, whose woods are now in sight of me, made over to some\nRoundhead, for good services against the Cavaliers at Worcester.\"\n\n\"Edward,\" replied Chaloner, \"I have this to say to you, and I can say it\nbecause you know that I am indebted to you for my life, and that is a\ndebt that nothing can cancel: If at any time you determine upon removing\nyour sisters from this, recollect my maiden aunts at Portlake.  They\ncannot be in better hands, and they cannot be in the hands of any person\nwho will more religiously do their duty towards them, and be pleased\nwith the trust confided to them.  They are rich, in spite of exactions;\nbut in these times women are not fined and plundered as men are, and\nthey have been well able to afford all that has been taken from them,\nand all that they have voluntarily given to the assistance of our party.\nThey are alone, and I really believe that nothing would make them more\nhappy than to have the care of the two sisters of Edward Beverley--be\nsure of that.  But I will be more sure of it, if you will find means of\nsending to them a letter, which I shall write to them.  I tell you that\nyou will do them a favour, and that if you do not accept the offer, you\nwill sacrifice your sisters' welfare to your own pride,--which I do not\nthink you would do.\"\n\n\"Most certainly I will not do that,\" replied Edward; \"and I am fully\nsensible of your kind offer; but I can say no more until I hear what\nyour good aunts may reply to your letter.  You mistake me much,\nChaloner, if you think that any sense of obligation would prevent me\nfrom seeing my sisters removed from a position so unworthy of them, but\nwhich circumstances have driven them to.  That we are paupers is\nundeniable; but I never shall forget that my sisters are the daughters\nof Colonel Beverley.\"\n\n\"I am delighted with your reply, Edward, and I fear not that of my good\naunts.  It will be a great happiness to me when I am wandering abroad to\nknow that your sisters are under their roof, and are being educated as\nthey ought to be.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Pablo?\" said Humphrey to the former, who came\nrunning, out of breath.\n\n\"Soldiers,\" said Pablo; \"plenty of them, gallop this way--gallop every\nway.\"\n\n\"Now, Chaloner, we must get ourselves out of this scrape; and I trust\nthat afterwards all will be well,\" said Edward.  \"Bring the horses out\nto the door; and, Chaloner, you and Grenville must wait within: bring my\nhorse out also, as it will appear as if I had just ridden over.  I must\nin to change my dress.  Humphrey, keep a look-out and let us know when\nthey come.\"\n\nChaloner and Edward went in, and Edward put on his dress of secretary.\nShortly afterwards a party of cavalry were seen galloping towards the\ncottage.  They soon arrived there, and pulled up their horses.  An\nofficer who headed them addressed Humphrey in a haughty tone, and asked\nhim who he was.\n\n\"I am one of the verderers of the forest, sir,\" replied Humphrey\nrespectfully.\n\n\"And whose cottage is that?  And who have you there?\"\n\n\"The cottage is mine, sir; two of the horses at the door belong to two\ntroopers who have come in quest of those who fled from Worcester; the\nother horse belongs to the secretary of the Intendant of the forest, Mr\nHeatherstone, who has come over with directions from the Intendant as to\nthe capture of the rebels.\"\n\nAt this moment Edward came out and saluted the officer.\n\n\"This is the secretary, sir, Master Armitage,\" said Humphrey, falling\nback.\n\nEdward saluted the officer, and said--\n\n\"Mr Heatherstone, the Intendant, has sent me over here to make\narrangements for the capture of the rebels.  This man is ordered to\nlodge two troopers as long as they are considered necessary to remain;\nand I have directions to tell any officer whom I may meet that Mr\nHeatherstone and his verderers will take good care that none of the\nrebels are harboured in this direction; and that it will be better that\nthe troops scour the southern edge of the forest, as it is certain that\nthe fugitives will try all that they can to embark for France.\"\n\n\"What regiment do the troopers belong to that you have here?\"\n\n\"I believe to Lambert's troop, sir; but they shall come out and answer\nfor themselves.  Tell those men to come out,\" said Edward to Humphrey.\n\n\"Yes, sir; but they are hard to wake, for they have ridden from\nWorcester; but I will rouse them.\"\n\n\"Nay, I cannot wait,\" replied the officer.  \"I know none of Lambert's\ntroops, and they have no information to give.\"\n\n\"Could you not take them with you, sir, and leave two of your men\ninstead of them; for they are troublesome people to a poor man, and\ndevour everything?\" said Humphrey submissively.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the officer, laughing, \"we all know Lambert's people--\na friend or enemy is much the same to them.  I have no power over them,\nand you must make the best of it.--Forward!  Men,\" continued the\nofficer, saluting Edward as he passed on: and in a minute or two they\nwere far in the distance.\n\n\"That's well over,\" observed Edward.  \"Chaloner and Grenville are too\nyoung-looking and too good-looking for Lambert's villains; and a sight\nof them might have occasioned suspicion.  We must, however, expect more\nvisits.  Keep a good look-out, Pablo.\"\n\nEdward and Humphrey then went in and joined the party inside the\ncottage, who were in a state of no little suspense during the colloquy\noutside.\n\n\"Why, Alice, dearest, you look quite pale,\" said Edward, as he came in.\n\n\"I feared for our guests, Edward.  I'm sure that if they had come into\nthe cottage, Master Chaloner and Master Grenville would never have been\nbelieved to be troopers.\"\n\n\"We thank you for the compliment, Mistress Alice,\" said Chaloner; \"but I\nthink, if necessary, I could ruffle and swear with the best, or rather\nthe worst of them.  We passed for troopers very well on the road here.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you did not meet any other troopers.\"\n\n\"That's very true, and shows your penetration.  I acknowledge that with\ntroopers there would have been more difficulty; but still, among so many\nthousands there must be many varieties, and it would be an awkward thing\nfor an officer of one troop to arrest upon suspicion the men belonging\nto another.  I think, when we are visited again, I shall sham\nintoxication--that will not be very suspicious.\"\n\n\"No, not on either side,\" replied Edward.  \"Come, Alice, we will eat\nwhat dinner you may have ready for us.\"\n\nFor three or four days the Parliamentary forces continued to scour the\nforest, and another visit or two was paid to the cottage, but without\nsuspicion being created, in consequence of the presence of Edward, and\nhis explanations.  The parties were invariably sent in another\ndirection.  Edward wrote to the Intendant, informing him what had\noccurred, and requesting permission to remain a few days longer at the\ncottage; and Pablo, who took the letter, returned with one from the\nIntendant, acquainting him that the king had not yet been taken; and\nrequesting the utmost vigilance on his part to ensure his capture, with\ndirections to search various places, in company with the troopers who\nhad been stationed at the cottage; or if he did not like to leave the\ncottage, to show the letter to any officer commanding parties in search,\nthat they might act upon the suggestions contained in it.  This letter\nEdward had an opportunity of showing to one or two officers commanding\nparties, who approached the cottage, and to whom Edward went out to\ncommunicate with, thereby preventing their stopping there.\n\nAt last, in about a fortnight, there was not a party in the forest, all\nof them having gone down to the sea-side, to look-out for the fugitives,\nseveral of whom were taken.\n\nHumphrey took the cart to Lymington, to procure clothes for Chaloner and\nGrenville, and it was decided that they should assume those of verderers\nof the forest, which would enable them to carry a gun.  As soon as\nHumphrey had obtained what was requisite, Chaloner and Grenville were\nconducted to Clara's cottage, and took possession,--of course never\nshowing themselves outside the wood which surrounded it.  Humphrey lent\nthem Holdfast as a watch dog, and they took leave of Alice and Edith\nwith much regret.  Humphrey and Edward accompanied them to their new\nabode.  It was arranged that the horses should remain under the care of\nHumphrey, as they had no stable at Clara's cottage.\n\nOn parting, Chaloner gave Edward the letter for his aunts; and then\nEdward once more bent his steps towards the Intendant's house, and found\nhimself in the company of Patience and Clara.\n\nEdward narrated to the Intendant all that had occurred, and the\nIntendant approved of what he had done; strongly advising that Chaloner\nand Grenville should not attempt to go to the continent till all pursuit\nwas over.\n\n\"Here's a letter I have received from the Government, Edward, highly\ncommending my vigilance and activity in pursuit of the fugitives.  It\nappears that the officers you fell in with have written up to state what\nadmirable dispositions we had made.  It is a pity, is it not, Edward,\nthat we are compelled to be thus deceitful in this world?  Nothing but\nthe times, and the wish to do good, could warrant it.  We meet the\nwicked, and fight them with their own weapons; but although it is\ntreating them as they deserve, our conscience must tell us that it is\nnot right.\"\n\n\"Surely, sir, to save the lives of people who have committed no other\nfault except loyalty to their king, will warrant our so doing--at least,\nI hope so.\"\n\n\"According to the Scriptures, I fear it will not; but it is a difficult\nquestion for us to decide.  Let us be guided by our own consciences; if\nthey do not reproach us we cannot be far from right.\"\n\nEdward then produced the letter he had received from Chaloner,\nrequesting that the Intendant would have the kindness to forward it.\n\n\"I see,\" replied the Intendant; \"I can forward these through Langton.  I\npresume it is to obtain credit for money.  It shall go on Thursday.\"\n\nThe conference was then broken up, and Edward went to see Oswald.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\n\nFor several days Edward remained at home, anxiously awaiting every news\nwhich arrived; expecting every time that the capture of the king would\nbe announced, and, with great joy, finding that hitherto all efforts had\nbeen unsuccessful.  But there was a question which now arose in Edward's\nmind, and which was the cause of deep reflection.  Since the proposal of\nsending his sisters away had been started, he felt the great\ninconvenience of his still representing himself to the Intendant as the\ngrandson of Armitage.  His sisters, if sent to the ladies at Portlake,\nmust be sent without the knowledge of the Intendant; and if so, the\ndiscovery of their absence would soon take place, as Patience\nHeatherstone would be constantly going over to the cottage; and he now\nasked himself the question whether, after all the kindness and\nconfidence which the Intendant had shown him, he was right in any longer\nconcealing from him his birth and parentage.  He felt that he was doing\nthe Intendant an injustice in not showing to him that confidence which\nhe deserved.\n\nThat he was justified in so doing at first, he felt; but since the\njoining the king's army, and the events which had followed, he\nconsidered that he was treating the Intendant ill, and he now resolved\nto take the first opportunity of making the confession.  But to do it\nformally, and without some opportunity which might offer, he felt\nawkward.  At last he thought that he would at once make the confession\nto Patience, under the promise of secrecy.  That he might do at once;\nand, after he had done so, the Intendant could not tax him with want of\nconfidence altogether.  He had now analysed his feelings towards\nPatience; and he felt how dear she had become to him.  During the time\nhe was with the army she had seldom been out of his thoughts; and\nalthough he was often in the society of well-bred women, he saw not one\nthat, in his opinion, could compare with Patience Heatherstone; but\nstill, what chance had he of supporting a wife?  At present, at the age\nof nineteen, it was preposterous.  Thoughts like these ran in his mind,\nchasing each other, and followed by others as vague and unsatisfactory;\nand, in the end, Edward came to the conclusion that he was without a\npenny, and that being known as the heir of Beverley would be to his\ndisadvantage; that he was in love with Patience Heatherstone, and had no\nchance at present of obtaining her; and that he had done well up to the\npresent time in concealing who he was from the Intendant, who could\nsafely attest that he knew not that he was protecting the son of so\nnoted a Cavalier; and that he would confess to Patience who he was, and\ngive as a reason for not telling her father, that he did not wish to\ncommit him by letting him know who it was that was under his protection.\nHow far the reader may be satisfied with the arguments which Edward was\nsatisfied with, we cannot pretend to say; but Edward was young, and\nhardly knew how to extricate himself from the cloak which necessity had\nfirst compelled him to put on.  Edward was already satisfied that he was\nnot quite looked upon with indifference by Patience Heatherstone; and he\nwas not yet certain whether it was not a grateful feeling that she had\ntowards him more than any other; that she believed him to be beneath her\nin birth, he felt convinced, and therefore she could have no idea that\nhe was Edward Beverley.  It was not till several days after he had made\nup his mind that he had an opportunity of being with her alone, as Clara\nRatcliffe was their constant companion.  However, one evening Clara went\nout, and stayed out so long, carelessly wrapped up, that she caught\ncold; and the following evening she remained at home, leaving Edward and\nPatience to take their usual walk unaccompanied by her.  They had walked\nfor some minutes in silence, when Patience observed--\n\n\"You are very grave, Edward, and have been very grave ever since your\nreturn; have you anything to vex you beyond the failure of the attempt?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, Patience.  I have much on my conscience, and do not know\nhow to act.  I want an adviser and a friend, and know not where to find\none.\"\n\n\"Surely, Edward, my father is your sincere friend, and not a bad\nadviser.\"\n\n\"I grant it; but the question is between your father and me, and I\ncannot advise with him for that reason.\"\n\n\"Then advise with me, Edward, if it is not a secret of such moment that\nit is not to be trusted to a woman: at all events it will be the advice\nof a sincere friend; you will give me credit for that.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for much more; for I think I shall have good advice, and will\ntherefore accept your offer.  I feel, Patience, that although I was\njustified, on my first acquaintance with your father, in not making\nknown to him a secret of some importance, yet now that he has put such\nimplicit confidence in me, I am doing him and myself an injustice in not\nmaking the communication--that is, as far as confidence in him is\nconcerned, I consider that he has a right to know all, and yet I feel\nthat it would be prudent on my part that he should not know all, as the\nknowledge might implicate him with those with whom he is at present\nallied.  A secret sometimes is dangerous; and if your father could not\nsay that on his honour he knew not of the secret, it might harm him if\nthe secret became afterwards known.  Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I exactly do; you have a secret that you wish to make\nknown to my father, and you think the knowledge of it may harm him.  I\ncannot imagine what kind of secret that may be.\"\n\n\"Well, I can give you a case in point.  Suppose now that I knew that\nKing Charles was hidden in your stable-loft: such might be the case, and\nyour father be ignorant of it, and his assertion of his ignorance would\nbe believed; but if I were to tell your father that the king was there,\nand it was afterwards discovered, do you not see that by confiding such\na secret to him I should do harm, and perhaps bring him into trouble?\"\n\n\"I perceive now, Edward; do you mean to say that you know where the king\nis concealed?  For if you do, I must beg of you not to let my father\nknow anything about it.  As you say, it would put him in a difficult\nposition, and must eventually harm him much.  There is a great\ndifference between wishing well to a cause and supporting it in person.\nMy father wishes the king well, I believe, but, at the same time, he\nwill not take an active part, as you have already seen; at the same\ntime, I am convinced that he would never betray the king if he knew\nwhere he was.  I say, therefore, if that is your secret, keep it from\nhim, for his sake and for mine, Edward, if you regard me.\"\n\n\"You know not how much I regard you, Patience.  I saw many high-born\nwomen when I was away, but none could I see equal to Patience\nHeatherstone, in my opinion; and Patience was ever in my thoughts during\nmy long absence.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your kind feelings towards me,\" replied Patience; \"but,\nMaster Armitage, we were talking about your secret.\"\n\n\"Master Armitage!\" rejoined Edward; \"how well you know how to remind me,\nby that expression, of my obscure birth and parentage, whenever I am apt\nto forget the distance which I ought to observe!\"\n\n\"You are wrong!\" replied Patience; \"but you flattered me so grossly that\nI called you Master Armitage to show that I disliked flattery; that was\nall.  I dislike flattery from those who are above me in rank, as well as\nthose who are below me; and I should have done the same to any other\nperson, whatever his condition might be.  But forget what I said; I did\nnot mean to vex you, only to punish you for thinking me so silly as to\nbelieve such nonsense.\"\n\n\"Your humility may construe that into flattery which was said by me in\nperfect sincerity and truth--that I cannot help,\" replied Edward.  \"I\nmight have added much more, and yet have been sincere; if you had not\nreminded me of my not being of gentle birth I might have had the\npresumption to have told you much more; but I have been rebuked.\"\n\nEdward finished speaking, and Patience made no reply: they walked on for\nseveral moments without exchanging another syllable.  At last Patience\nsaid--\n\n\"I will not say who is wrong, Edward; but this I do know, that the one\nwho first offers the olive-branch after a misunderstanding cannot but be\nright.  I offer it now, and ask you whether we are to quarrel about one\nlittle word.  Let me ask you, and give me a candid answer: Have I ever\nbeen so base as to treat as an inferior one to whom I have been so much\nobliged?\"\n\n\"It is I who am in fault, Patience,\" replied Edward.  \"I have been\ndreaming for a long while, pleased with my dreams; and forgetting that\nthey were dreams, and not likely to be realised.  I must now speak\nplainly.  I love you, Patience; love you so much that to part from you\nwould be misery--to know that my love was rejected, as bitter as death.\nThat is the truth, and I can conceal it no longer.  Now I admit you have\na right to be angry.\"\n\n\"I see no cause for anger, Edward,\" replied Patience.  \"I have not\nthought of you but as a friend and benefactor; it would have been wrong\nto have done otherwise.  I am but a young person, and must be guided by\nmy father.  I would not offend him by disobedience.  I thank you for\nyour good opinion of me, and yet I wish you had not said what you have.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand from your reply, that if your father raised no\nobjection, my lowly birth would be none in your opinion?\"\n\n\"Your birth has never come into my head, except when reminded of it by\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Then, Patience, let me return for the present to what I had to confide\nto you.  I was--\"\n\n\"Here comes my father, Edward,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Surely I have done wrong, for I feel afraid to meet him.\"\n\nMr Heatherstone now joined them, and said to Edward--\n\n\"I have been looking for you; I have news from London which has rejoiced\nme much.  I have at last obtained what I have some time been trying for;\nand, indeed, I may say that your prudence and boldness in returning home\nas a trooper, added to your conduct in the forest, has greatly advanced,\nand ultimately obtained for me my suit.  There was some suspense before\nthat; but your conduct has removed it; and now we shall have plenty to\ndo.\"\n\nThey walked to the house, and the Intendant, as soon as he had gained\nhis own room, said to Edward--\n\n\"There is a grant to me of a property which I have long solicited for my\nservices--read it.\"  Edward took up the letter, in which the Parliament\ninformed Mr Heatherstone that his application for the property of\nArnwood had been acceded to, and signed by the Commissioners; and that\nhe might take immediate possession.  Edward turned pale as he laid the\ndocument down on the table.\n\n\"We will ride to-morrow, Edward, and look it over.  I intend to rebuild\nthe house.\"\n\nEdward made no reply.\n\n\"Are you not well?\" said the Intendant, with surprise.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Edward, \"I am well, I believe, but I will confess to\nyou that I am disappointed.  I did not think that you would have\naccepted a property from such a source, and so unjustly sequestrated.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Edward,\" replied the Intendant, \"that I should have fallen\nin your good opinion; but allow me to observe that you are so far right,\nthat I never would have accepted a property to which there were living\nclaimants; but this is a different case.  For instance, the Ratcliffe\nproperty belongs to little Clara and is sequestrated.  Do you think I\nwould accept it?  Never!  But here is a property without an heir; the\nwhole family perished in the flames of Arnwood!  There is no living\nclaimant!  It must be given to somebody, or remain with the Government.\nThis property, therefore, and this property only, out of all\nsequestrated, I selected; as I felt that, in obtaining it, I did harm to\nno one.  I have been offered others, but have refused them.  I would\naccept of this, and this only; and that is the reason why my\napplications have hitherto been attended with no success.  I trust you\nbelieve me, Edward, in what I assert?\"\n\n\"First answer me one question, Mr Heatherstone.  Suppose it were proved\nthat the whole of the family did not, as it is supposed, perish at the\nconflagration of Arnwood?  Suppose a rightful heir to it should at any\ntime appear, would you then resign the property to him?\"\n\n\"As I hope for heaven, Edward, I would!\" replied the Intendant, solemnly\nraising his eyes upwards as he spoke.  \"I then should think that I had\nbeen an instrument to keep the property out of other hands less\nscrupulous, and should surrender it as a trust which had been confided\nto me for the time only.\"\n\n\"With such feelings, Mr Heatherstone, I can now congratulate you upon\nyour having obtained possession of the property,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"And yet I do not deserve so much credit, as there is little chance of\nmy sincerity being put to the test, Edward.  There is no doubt that the\nfamily all perished; and Arnwood will become the dower of Patience\nHeatherstone.\"\n\nEdward's heart beat quick.  A moment's thought told him his situation.\nHe had been prevented, by the interruption of Mr Heatherstone, from\nmaking his confession to Patience; and now he could not make it to\nanybody without a rupture with the Intendant, or a compromise, by asking\nwhat he so earnestly desired--the hand of Patience.  Mr Heatherstone\nobserving to Edward that he did not look so well, said supper was ready;\nand that they had better go into the next room.  Edward mechanically\nfollowed.  At supper he was tormented by the incessant inquiries of\nClara, as to what was the matter with him.  He did not venture to look\nat Patience, and made a hasty retreat to bed; complaining, as he well\nmight do, of a severe headache.\n\nEdward threw himself on his bed, but to sleep was impossible.  He\nthought of the events of the day over and over again.  Had he any reason\nto believe that Patience returned his affection?  No: her reply was too\ncalm, too composed, to make him suppose that; and now that she would be\nan heiress, there would be no want of pretenders to her hand; and he\nwould lose her and his property at the same time.  It was true that the\nIntendant had declared that he would renounce the property if the true\nheir appeared, but that was easy to say upon the conviction that no heir\nwould appear; and even if he did renounce it, the Parliament would\nreceive it again, rather than it should fall into the hands of a\nBeverley.  \"Oh that I had never left the cottage,\" thought Edward.  \"I\nmight then at least have become resigned and contented with my lot.  Now\nI am miserable, and, whichever way I turn, I see no prospect of being\notherwise.  One thing only I can decide upon, which is, that I will not\nremain any longer than I can help under this roof.  I will go over and\nconsult with Humphrey; and if I can only place my sisters as I want,\nHumphrey and I will seek our fortunes.\"\n\nEdward rose at daylight, and, dressing himself, went down and saddled\nhis horse.  Desiring Sampson to tell the Intendant that he had gone over\nto the cottage, and would return by the evening, he rode across the\nforest, and arrived just as they were sitting down to breakfast.  His\nattempts to be cheerful before his sisters did not succeed, and they\nwere all grieved to see him look so pale and haggard.  As soon as\nbreakfast was over Edward made a sign, and he and Humphrey went out.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear brother?\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"I will tell you all.  Listen to me,\" replied Edward, who then gave him\nthe detail of all that had passed, from the time he had walked out with\nPatience Heatherstone till he went to bed.  \"Now, Humphrey, you know\nall; and what shall I do?  Remain there I cannot!\"\n\n\"If Patience Heatherstone had professed regard for you,\" replied\nHumphrey, \"the affair would have been simple enough.  Her father could\nhave no objections to the match; and he would at the same time have\nacquitted his conscience as to the retaining of the property: but you\nsay she showed none.\"\n\n\"She told me very calmly that she was sorry that I had said what I did.\"\n\n\"But do women always mean what they say, brother?\" said Humphrey.\n\n\"She does, at all events,\" replied Edward; \"she is truth itself.  No, I\ncannot deceive myself.  She feels a deep debt of gratitude for the\nservice I rendered her; and that prevented her from being more harsh in\nher reply than what she was.\"\n\n\"But if she knew that you were Edward Beverley, do you not think it\nwould make a difference in her?\"\n\n\"And if it did, it would be too humiliating to think that I was only\nmarried for my rank and station.\"\n\n\"But, considering you of mean birth, may she not have checked those\nfeelings which she considered under the circumstances improper to\nindulge?\"\n\n\"Where there is such a sense of propriety there can be little\naffection.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about these things, Edward,\" replied Humphrey; \"but I\nhave been told that a woman's heart is not easily read; or if I have not\nbeen told it, I have read it or dreamt it.\"\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"What I fear you will not approve of, Humphrey; it is to break up our\nestablishment altogether.  If the answer is favourable from the Misses\nConynghame, my sisters shall go to them; but that we had agreed upon\nalready.  Then for myself--I intend to go abroad, resume my name, and\nobtain employment in some foreign service.  I will trust to the king for\nassisting me to that.\"\n\n\"That is the worst part of it, Edward; but if your peace of mind depends\nupon it, I will not oppose it.\"\n\n\"You, Humphrey, may come with me and share my fortunes, or do what you\nthink more preferable.\"\n\n\"I think then, Edward, that I shall not decide rashly.  I must have\nremained here with Pablo, if my sisters had gone to the Ladies\nConynghame and you had remained with the Intendant; I shall, therefore,\ntill I hear from you, remain where I am, and I shall be able to observe\nwhat is going on here, and let you know.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" replied Edward; \"let me only see my sisters well placed, and\nI shall be off the next day.  It is misery to remain there now.\"\n\nAfter some more conversation Edward mounted his horse and returned to\nthe Intendant's.  He did not arrive till late, for supper was on the\ntable.  The Intendant gave him a letter for Master Chaloner, which was\nenclosed in one from Mr Langton;--and further informed Edward that news\nhad arrived of the king having made his escape to France.\n\n\"Thank God for that!\" exclaimed Edward.  \"With your leave, sir, I will\nto-morrow deliver this letter to the party to whom it is addressed, as I\nknow it to be of consequence.\"\n\nThe Intendant having given his consent, Edward retired without having\nexchanged a word with Patience or Clara beyond the usual civilities of\nthe table.\n\nThe following morning Edward, who had not slept an hour during the\nnight, set off for Clara's cottage, and found Chaloner and Grenville\nstill in bed.  At the sound of his voice the door was opened, and he\ngave Chaloner the letter; the latter read it and then handed it to\nEdward.  The Misses Conynghame were delighted at the idea of receiving\nthe two daughters of Colonel Beverley, and would treat them as their\nown; they requested that they might be sent to London immediately, where\nthe coach would meet them to convey them down to Lancashire.  They\nbegged to be kindly remembered to Captain Beverley, and to assure him\nthat his sisters should be well cared for.\n\n\"I am much indebted to you, Chaloner,\" said Edward; \"I will send my\nbrother off with my sisters as soon as possible.  You will soon think of\nreturning to France; and if you will permit me, I will accompany you.\"\n\n\"You, Edward!  That will be delightful; but you had no idea of the kind\nwhen last we met.  What has induced you to alter your mind?\"\n\n\"I will tell you by and by; I do not think I shall be here again for\nsome days.  I must be a great deal at the cottage when Humphrey is away;\nfor Pablo will have a great charge upon him--what with the dairy, and\nhorses, and breed of goats, and other things--more than he can attend\nto; but as soon as Humphrey returns, I will come to you and make\npreparations for our departure.  Till then farewell, both of you.  We\nmust see to provision you for three weeks or a month before Humphrey\nstarts.\"\n\nEdward bade them a hearty farewell, and then rode to the cottage.\n\nAlthough Alice and Edith had been somewhat prepared for leaving the\ncottage, yet the time was so very uncertain, that the blow fell heavy\nupon them.  They were to leave their brothers, whom they loved so\ndearly, to go to strangers; and when they understood that they were to\nleave in two days, and that they should not see Edward again, their\ngrief was very great; but Edward reasoned with Alice and consoled her,\nalthough with Edith it was a more difficult task.  She not only lamented\nher brothers, but her cow, her pony, and her kids; all the dumb animals\nwere friends and favourites of Edith; and even the idea of parting with\nPablo was the cause of a fresh burst of tears.  Having made every\narrangement with Humphrey, Edward once more took his leave, promising to\ncome over and assist Pablo as soon as he could.\n\nThe next day Humphrey was busied in his preparations.  They supplied the\nprovisions to Clara's cottage; and when Pablo took them over in the\ncart, Humphrey rode to Lymington and provided a conveyance to London for\nthe following day.  We may as well observe that they set off at the hour\nappointed, and arrived safely at London in three days.  There, at an\naddress given in the letter, they found the coach waiting; and having\ngiven his sisters into the charge of an elderly waiting-woman, who had\ncome up in the coach to take charge of them, they quitted him with many\ntears, and Humphrey hastened back to the New Forest.\n\nOn his return he found, to his surprise, that Edward had not called at\nthe cottage as he had promised; and, with a mind foreboding evil, he\nmounted a horse and set off across the forest to ascertain the cause.\nAs he was close to the Intendant's house he was met by Oswald, who\ninformed him that Edward had been seized with a violent fever, and was\nin a very dangerous state, having been delirious for three or four days.\n\nHumphrey hastened to dismount, and knocked at the door of the house; it\nwas opened by Sampson, and Humphrey requested to be shown up to his\nbrother's room.  He found Edward in the state described by Oswald, and\nwholly unconscious of his presence; the maid, Phoebe, was by his\nbedside.\n\n\"You may leave,\" said Humphrey, rather abruptly; \"I am his brother.\"\n\nPhoebe retired, and Humphrey was alone with his brother.\n\n\"It was, indeed, an unhappy day when you came to this house,\" exclaimed\nHumphrey, as the tears rolled down his cheeks; \"my poor, poor Edward.\"\n\nEdward now began to talk incoherently, and attempted to rise from the\nbed, but his efforts were unavailing--he was too weak; but he raved of\nPatience Heatherstone, and he called himself Edward Beverley more than\nonce, and he talked of his father and of Arnwood.\n\n\"If he has raved in this manner,\" thought Humphrey, \"he has not many\nsecrets left to disclose.  I will not leave him, and will keep others\naway if I can.\"\n\nHumphrey had been sitting an hour with his brother, when the surgeon\ncame to see his patient.  He felt his pulse, and asked Humphrey if he\nwas nursing him.\n\n\"I am his brother, sir,\" replied Humphrey.\n\n\"Then, my good sir, if you perceive any signs of perspiration--and I\nthink now that there is a little--keep the clothes on him and let him\nperspire freely.  If so, his life will be saved.\"\n\nThe surgeon withdrew, saying that he would return again late in the\nevening.\n\nHumphrey remained for another two hours at the bedside, and then feeling\nthat there was a sign of perspiration, he obeyed the injunctions of the\nsurgeon, and held on the clothes, against all Edward's endeavours to\nthrow them off.  For a short time the perspiration was profuse, and the\nrestlessness of Edward subsided into a deep slumber.\n\n\"Thank Heaven!  There are then hopes.\"\n\n\"Did you say there were hopes?\" repeated a voice behind him.\n\nHumphrey turned, and perceived Patience and Clara behind him, who had\ncome in without his observing it.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Humphrey, looking reproachfully at Patience, \"there are\nhopes, by what the surgeon said to me--hopes that he may yet be able to\nquit this house, which he was so unfortunate as to enter.\"\n\nThis was a harsh and rude speech of Humphrey's; but he considered that\nPatience Heatherstone had been the cause of his brother's dangerous\nstate, and that she had not behaved well to him.\n\nPatience made no reply, but falling down on her knees by the bedside,\nprayed silently; and Humphrey's heart smote him for what he had said to\nher.  \"She cannot be so bad,\" thought Humphrey, as Patience and Clara\nquitted the room without the least noise.\n\nShortly afterwards the Intendant came up into the room, and offered his\nhand to Humphrey, who pretended not to see it, and did not take it.\n\n\"He has got Arnwood; that is enough for him,\" thought Humphrey; \"but my\nhand in friendship he shall not receive.\"\n\nThe Intendant put his hand within the clothes, and feeling the high\nperspiration in which Edward was in, said--\n\n\"I thank thee, O God!  For all Thy mercies, and that Thou hast been\npleased to spare this valuable life.\"\n\n\"How are your sisters, Master Humphrey?\" said the Intendant; \"my\ndaughter bade me inquire.  I will send over to them and let them know\nthat your brother is better, if you do not leave this for the cottage\nyourself after the surgeon has called again.\"\n\n\"My sisters are no longer at the cottage, Mr Heatherstone,\" replied\nHumphrey; \"they have gone to some friends who have taken charge of them.\nI saw them safe to London myself, or I should have known of my\nbrother's illness and have been here before this.\"\n\n\"You indeed tell me news, Master Humphrey,\" replied the Intendant.\n\"With whom, may I ask, are your sisters placed, and in what capacity are\nthey gone?\"\n\nThis reply of the Intendant's reminded Humphrey that he had somewhat\ncommitted himself, as being supposed to be the daughters of a forester,\nit was not to be thought that they had gone up to be educated; and he\ntherefore replied--\n\n\"They found it lonely in the forest, Mr Heatherstone, and wished to see\nLondon; so we have taken them there, and put them into the care of those\nwho have promised that they shall be well placed.\"\n\nThe Intendant appeared to be much disturbed and surprised, but he said\nnothing, and soon afterwards quitted the room.  He almost immediately\nreturned with the surgeon, who, as soon as he felt Edward's pulse,\ndeclared that the crisis was over, and that when he awoke he would be\nquite sensible.  Having given directions as to the drink of his patient,\nand some medicine which he was to take, the surgeon then left, stating\nthat he should not call until the next evening, unless he was sent for,\nas he considered all danger over.\n\nEdward continued in a quiet slumber for the major portion of the night.\nIt was just break of day when he opened his eyes.  Humphrey offered him\nsome drink, which Edward took greedily; and seeing Humphrey, said--\n\n\"Oh, Humphrey, I had quite forgotten where I was--I'm so sleepy!\" and\nwith these words his head fell on the pillow, and he was again asleep.\n\nWhen it was broad daylight Oswald came into the room--\n\n\"Master Humphrey, they say that all danger is over now, but that you\nhave remained here all night.  I will relieve you now, if you let me.\nGo and take a walk in the fresh air--it will revive you.\"\n\n\"I will, Oswald, and many thanks.  My brother has woke up once, and, I\nthank God, quite sensible.  He will know you when he wakes again, and\nthen do you send for me.\"\n\nHumphrey left the room, and was glad, after a night of close confinement\nin a sick-room, to feel the cool morning air fanning his cheeks.  He had\nnot been long out of the house before he perceived Clara coming towards\nhim.\n\n\"How d'ye do, Humphrey?\" said Clara; \"and how is your brother this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"He is better, Clara, and I hope now out of danger.\"\n\n\"But, Humphrey,\" continued Clara; \"when we came into the room last\nnight, what made you say what you did?\"\n\n\"I do not recollect that I said anything.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did; you said that there were now hopes that your brother\nwould be able soon to quit this house, which he had been so unfortunate\nas to enter.  Do you recollect?\"\n\n\"I may have said so, Clara,\" replied Humphrey; \"it was only speaking my\nthoughts aloud.\"\n\n\"But why do you think so, Humphrey?  Why has Edward been unfortunate in\nentering this house?  That is what I want to know.  Patience cried so\nmuch after she left the room because you said that.  Why did you say so?\nYou did not think so a short time ago.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Clara, I did not, but I do now, and I cannot give you my\nreasons; so you must say no more about it.\"\n\nClara was silent for a time, and then said--\n\n\"Patience tells me that your sisters have gone away from the cottage.\nYou told her father so.\"\n\n\"It is very true, they have gone.\"\n\n\"But why have they gone?  What have they gone for?  Who is to look after\nthe cows and goats and poultry?  Who is to cook your dinner, Humphrey?\nWhat can you do without them, and why did you send them away without\nletting me or Patience know that they were going, so that at least we\nmight have bid them farewell?\"\n\n\"My dear Clara,\" replied Humphrey--who, feeling no little difficulty in\nreplying to all these questions, resolved to cut the matter short by\nappearing to be angry--\"you know that you are the daughter of a\ngentleman, and so is Patience Heatherstone.  You are both of gentle\nbirth; but my sisters, you know, are only the daughters of a forester,\nand my brother Edward and I are no better.  It does not become Mistress\nPatience and you to be intimate with such as we are, especially now that\nMistress Patience is a great heiress: for her father has obtained the\nlarge property of Arnwood, and it will be hers after his death.  It is\nnot fit that the heiress of Arnwood should mix herself up with\nforester's daughters; and as we had friends near Lymington who offered\nto assist us, and take our sisters under their charge, we thought it\nbetter that they should go; for what would become of them, if any\naccident was to happen to Edward or to me?  Now they will be provided\nfor.  After they have been taught, they will make very nice tire-women\nto some lady of quality,\" added Humphrey, with a sneer.  \"Don't you\nthink they will, my pretty Clara?\"\n\nClara burst into tears.\n\n\"You are very unkind, Humphrey,\" sobbed she.  \"You had no right to send\naway your sisters.  I don't believe you--that's more!\" and Clara ran\naway into the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\n\nOur readers may think that Humphrey was very unkind; but it was to avoid\nbeing questioned by Clara, who was evidently sent for the purpose, that\nhe was so harsh.  At the same time it must be admitted that Mr\nHeatherstone having obtained possession of Arnwood, rankled no doubt in\nthe minds of both the brothers, and every act now, on the part of him or\nhis family, was viewed in a false medium.  But our feelings are not\nalways at our control, and Edward was naturally impetuous, and Humphrey\nso much attached, and so much alarmed at his brother's danger, that he\nwas even more excited.  The blow fell doubly heavy, as it appeared that\nat the very same time Patience had rejected his brother and taken\npossession of their property, which had been held by the family for\ncenturies.  What made the case more annoying was, that explanation, if\nthere was any to offer on either side, was, under present circumstances,\nalmost impossible.\n\nSoon after Clara left him Humphrey returned to his brother's room.  He\nfound him awake, and talking to Oswald.  Ardently pressing his brother's\nhand, Edward said--\n\n\"My dear Humphrey, I shall soon be well now, and able, I trust, to quit\nthis house.  What I fear is, that some explanation will be asked for by\nthe Intendant, not only relative to my sisters having left us, but also\nupon other points.  This is what I wish to avoid, without giving\noffence.  I do not think that the Intendant is so much to blame in\nhaving obtained my property, as he does not know that a Beverley\nexisted, but I cannot bear to have any further intimacy with him,\nespecially after what has taken place between me and his daughter.  What\nI have to request is, that you will never quit this room while I am\nstill here, unless you are relieved by Oswald; so that the Intendant or\nanybody else may have no opportunity of having any private communication\nwith me, or forcing me to listen to what they may have to say.  I made\nthis known to Oswald before you came in.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, it shall be so, Edward; for I am of your opinion.\nClara came to me just now, and I had much trouble, and was compelled to\nbe harsh, to get rid of her importunity.\"\n\nWhen the surgeon called, he pronounced Edward out of danger, and that\nhis attendance would be no longer necessary.  Edward felt the truth of\nthis.  All that he required was strength; and that he trusted in a few\ndays to obtain.\n\nOswald was sent over to the cottage to ascertain how Pablo was going on\nby himself.  He found that everything was correct, and that Pablo,\nalthough he felt proud of his responsibility, was very anxious for\nHumphrey's return, as he found himself very lonely.  During Oswald's\nabsence on this day, Humphrey never quitted the room and although the\nIntendant came up several times he never could find an opportunity of\nspeaking to Edward, which he evidently wished to do.\n\nTo inquiries made as to how he was, Edward always complained of great\nweakness, for a reason which will soon be understood.  Several days\nelapsed, and Edward had often been out of bed during the night, when not\nlikely to be intruded upon, and he now felt himself strong enough to be\nremoved; and his object was to leave the Intendant's house without his\nknowledge, so as to avoid any explanation.\n\nOne evening Pablo came over with the horses after it was dark.  Oswald\nput them into the stable; and the morning proving fine and clear, a\nlittle before break of day Edward came softly downstairs with Humphrey,\nand, mounting the horses, set off for the cottage, without any one in\nthe Intendant's house being aware of their departure.\n\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Edward took this step without\nsome degree of consideration as to the feelings of the Intendant.  On\nthe contrary, he left a letter with Oswald, to be delivered after his\ndeparture, in which he thanked the Intendant sincerely for all the\nkindness and compassion he had shown towards him assured him of his\ngratitude and kind feelings towards him and his daughter, but said that\ncircumstances had occurred of which no explanation could be given\nwithout great pain to all parties, which rendered it advisable that he\nshould take such an apparently unkind step as to leave without bidding\nthem farewell in person; that he was about to embark immediately for the\ncontinent, to seek his fortune in the wars; and that he wished all\nprosperity to the family, which would ever have his kindest wishes and\nremembrances.\n\n\"Humphrey,\" said Edward, after they had ridden about two miles across\nthe forest, and the sun had risen in an unclouded sky, \"I feel like an\nemancipated slave.  Thank God!  My sickness has cured me of all my\ncomplaints, and all I want now is active employment.  And now, Humphrey,\nChaloner and Grenville are not a little tired of being inured up in\ntheir cottage, and I am as anxious as they are to be off.  What will you\ndo?  Will you join us, or will you remain at the cottage?\"\n\n\"I have reflected upon it, Edward, and I have come to the determination\nof remaining at the cottage.  You will find it expensive enough to\nsupport one where you are going, and you must appear as a Beverley\nshould do.  We have plenty of money saved to equip you, and maintain you\nwell for a year or so; but after that you may require more.  Leave me\nhere.  I can make money, now that the farm is well stocked; and I have\nno doubt that I shall be able to send over a trifle every year to\nsupport the honour of the family.  Besides, I do not wish to leave this\nfor another reason.  I want to know what is going on, and watch the\nmotions of the Intendant and the heiress of Arnwood.  I also do not wish\nto leave the country until I know how my sisters get on with the Ladies\nConynghame: it is my duty to watch over them.  I have made up my mind,\nso do not attempt to dissuade me.\"\n\n\"I shall not, my dear Humphrey, as I think you have decided properly;\nbut I beg you will not think of laying by money for me--a very little\nwill suffice for my wants.\"\n\n\"Not so, good brother; you must and shall, if I can help you, ruffle it\nwith the best.  You will be better received if you do; for, though\npoverty is no sin, as the saying is, it is scouted as sin should be,\nwhile sins are winked at.  You know that I require no money, and\ntherefore you must and shall, if you love me, take it all.\"\n\n\"As you will, my dear Humphrey.  Now then, let us put our horses to\nspeed, for, if possible, we will to-morrow morning leave the forest.\"\n\nBy this time all search for the fugitives from Worcester had long been\nover, and there was no difficulty in obtaining the means of embarkation.\nEarly the next morning everything was ready, and Edward, Humphrey,\nChaloner, Grenville, and Pablo set off for Southampton, one of the\nhorses carrying the little baggage which they had with them.  Edward, as\nwe have before mentioned, with the money he had saved, and the store at\nthe cottage, which had been greatly increased, was well supplied with\ncash; and that evening they embarked, with their horses, in a small\nsailing vessel, and, with a favourable light wind, arrived at a small\nport of France on the following day.  Humphrey and Pablo returned to the\ncottage, we need hardly now say, very much out of spirits at the\nseparation.\n\n\"Oh, Massa Humphrey,\" said Pablo, as they rode along, \"Missy Alice and\nMissy Edith go away--I wish go with them.  Massa Edward go away--I wish\ngo with him.  You stay at cottage--I wish stay with you.  Pablo cannot\nbe in three places.\"\n\n\"No, Pablo; all you can do is to stay where you can be most useful.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that.  You want me at cottage very much.  Missy Alice and\nEdith and Massa Edward no want me; so I stay at cottage.\"\n\n\"Yes, Pablo, we will stay at the cottage, but we can't do everything\nnow.  I think we must give up the dairy, now that my sisters are gone.\nI'll tell you what I have been thinking of, Pablo.  We will make a large\nenclosed place, to coax the ponies into during the winter, pick out as\nmany as we think are good, and sell them at Lymington.  That will be\nbetter than churning butter.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see; plenty of work for Pablo.\"\n\n\"And plenty for me, too, Pablo; but you know, when the enclosure is once\nmade, it will last for a long while; and we will get the wild cattle\ninto it if we can.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Pablo.  \"I like that very much; only not like trouble\nto build place.\"\n\n\"We shan't have much trouble, Pablo: if we fell the trees inside the\nwood at each side, and let them lie one upon the other, the animals will\nnever break through them.\"\n\n\"That very good idea--save trouble,\" said Pablo.  \"And what you do with\ncows, suppose no make butter?\"\n\n\"Keep them, and sell their calves; keep them, to entice the wild cattle\ninto the pen.\"\n\n\"Yes, that good.  And turn out old Billy to 'tice ponies into pen,\"\ncontinued Pablo, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, we will try it.\"\n\nWe must now return to the Intendant's house.  Oswald delivered the\nletter to the Intendant, who read it with much astonishment.\n\n\"Gone!  Is he actually gone?\" said Mr Heatherstone.\n\n\"Yes, sir, before daylight this morning.\"\n\n\"And why was I not informed of it?\" said Mr Heatherstone; \"why have you\nbeen a party to this proceeding, being my servant?  May I inquire that?\"\n\n\"I knew Master Edward before I knew you, sir,\" replied Oswald.\n\n\"Then you had better follow him,\" rejoined the Intendant, in an angry\ntone.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Oswald, who quitted the room.  \"Good Heaven!\nHow all my plans have been frustrated!\" exclaimed the Intendant, when he\nwas alone.  He then read the letter over more carefully than he had done\nat first.  \"`Circumstances had occurred of which no explanation could be\ngiven by him.'  I do not comprehend that--I must see Patience.\"\n\nMr Heatherstone opened the door, and called to his daughter.\n\n\"Patience,\" said Mr Heatherstone, \"Edward has left the house this\nmorning; here is a letter which he has written to me.  Read it, and let\nme know if you can explain some portion of it, which to me is\nincomprehensible.  Sit down and read it attentively.\"\n\nPatience, who was much agitated, gladly took the seat and perused\nEdward's letter.  When she had done so she let it drop in her lap, and\ncovered all her face, the tears trickling through her fingers.  After a\ntime the Intendant said--\n\n\"Patience, has anything passed between you and Edward Armitage?\"\n\nPatience made no reply, but sobbed aloud.  She might not have shown so\nmuch emotion, but it must be remembered that for the last three weeks\nsince Edward had spoken to her, and during his subsequent illness, she\nhad been very unhappy.  The reserve of Humphrey, the expressions he had\nmade use of, his repulse of Clara, and her not having seen anything of\nEdward during his illness, added to his sudden and unexpected departure\nwithout a word to her, had broken her spirits, and she sank beneath the\nload of sorrow.\n\nThe Intendant left her to recover herself before he again addressed her.\nWhen she had ceased sobbing, her father spoke to her in a very kind\nvoice, begging her that she would not conceal anything from him, as it\nwas most important to him that the real facts should be known.\n\n\"Now tell me, my child, what passed between Edward and you?\"\n\n\"He told me, just before you came up to us that evening, that he loved\nme.\"\n\n\"And what was your reply?\"\n\n\"I hardly know, my dear father, what it was that I said.  I did not like\nto be unkind to one who saved my life, and I did not choose to say what\nI thought, because--because--because he was of low birth; and how could\nI give encouragement to the son of a forester without your permission?\"\n\n\"Then you rejected him?\"\n\n\"I suppose I did, or that he considered that I did so.  He had a secret\nof importance that he would have confided to me, had you not interrupted\nus.\"\n\n\"And now, Patience, I must request you to answer me one question\ncandidly.  I do not blame you for your conduct, which was correct under\nthe circumstances.  I also had a secret which I perhaps ought to have\nconfided; but I did consider that the confidence and paternal kindness\nwith which I treated Edward would have been sufficient to point out to\nyou that I could not have been very averse to an union--indeed, the\nfreedom of communication which I allowed between you must have told you\nso: but your sense of duty and propriety has made you act as you ought\nto have done, I grant, although contrary to my real wishes.\"\n\n\"Your wishes, my father?\" said Patience.  \"Yes--my wishes; there is\nnothing that I so ardently desired as an union between you and Edward;\nbut I wished you to love him for his own merits.\"\n\n\"I have done so, father,\" replied Patience, sobbing again, \"although I\ndid not tell him so.\"\n\nThe Intendant remained silent for some time, and then said--\n\n\"There is no cause for further concealment, Patience; I have only to\nregret that I was not more explicit sooner.  I have long suspected, and\nhave since been satisfied, that Edward Armitage is Edward Beverley, who,\nwith his brother and sisters, were supposed to have been burnt to death\nat Arnwood.\"\n\nPatience removed her handkerchief from her face, and looked at her\nfather with astonishment.\n\n\"I tell you that I had a strong suspicion of it, my dear child, first,\nfrom the noble appearance, which no forest garb could disguise; but what\ngave me further conviction was, that when at Lymington I happened to\nfall in with one Benjamin, who had been a servant at Arnwood, and\ninterrogated him closely.  He really believed that the children were\nburnt; it is true that I asked him particularly relative to the\nappearance of the children--how many were boys and how many were girls,\ntheir ages, etcetera; but the strongest proof was, that the names of the\nfour children corresponded with the names of the Children of the Forest,\nas well as their ages, and I went to the church register and extracted\nthem.  Now this was almost amounting to proof; for it was not likely\nthat four children in the forest cottage should have the same ages and\nnames as those of Arnwood.  After I had ascertained this point, I\nengaged Edward, as you know, wishing to secure him; for I was once\nacquainted with his father, and at all events well acquainted with the\nColonel's merits.  You remained in the house together, and it was with\npleasure that I watched the intimacy between you; and then I exerted\nmyself to get Arnwood restored to him.  I could not ask it for him, but\nI prevented it being given to any other, by laying claim to it myself.\nHad Edward remained with us, all might have succeeded as I wished; but\nhe would join in the unfortunate insurrection, and I knew it useless to\nprevent him, so I let him go.  I found that he took the name of Beverley\nduring the time he was with the king's army, and when I was last in town\nI was told so by the commissioners, who wondered where he had come from;\nbut the effect was, that it was now useless for me to request the estate\nfor him, as I had wished to do--his having served in the royal army\nrendered it impossible.  I therefore claimed it for myself, and\nsucceeded.  I had made up my mind that he was attached to you, and you\nwere equally so to him; and as soon as I had the grant sent down, which\nwas on the evening he addressed you, I made known to him that the\nproperty was given to me; and I added, on some dry questions being put\nto me by him, relative to the possibility of there being still existing\nan heir to the estate, that there was no chance of that, and that you\nwould be the mistress of Arnwood.  I threw it out as a hint to him,\nfancying that, as far as you were concerned, all would go well, and that\nI would explain to him my knowledge of who he was after he had made\nknown his regard for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see it all now,\" replied Patience; \"in one hour he is rejected\nby me, and in the next he is told that I have obtained possession of his\nproperty.  No wonder that he is indignant, and looks upon us with scorn.\nAnd now he has left us: we have driven him into danger, and may never\nsee him again.  Oh, father!  I am very, very miserable!\"\n\n\"We must hope for the best, Patience.  It is true that he has gone to\nthe wars, but it does not therefore follow that he is to be killed.  You\nare both very young--much too young to marry--and all may be explained.\nI must see Humphrey, and be candid with him.\"\n\n\"But Alice and Edith,--where are they gone, father?\"\n\n\"That I can inform you.  I have a letter from Langton on the subject,\nfor I begged him to find out.  He says that there are two young ladies\nof the name of Beverley, who have been placed under the charge of his\nfriends the Ladies Conynghame, who is aunt to Major Chaloner, who has\nbeen for some time concealed in the forest.  But I have letters to\nwrite, my dear Patience.  To-morrow, if I live and do well, I will ride\nover to the cottage to see Humphrey Beverley.\"\n\nThe Intendant kissed his daughter; and she left the room.\n\nPoor Patience!  She was glad to be left to herself, and think over this\nstrange communication.  For many days she had felt how fond she had been\nof Edward, much more so than she had believed herself to be.  \"And now,\"\nshe thought, \"if he really loves me, and hears my father's explanation,\nhe will come back again.\"  By degrees, she recovered her serenity, and\nemployed herself in her quiet domestic duties.\n\nMr Heatherstone rode over to the cottage the next day, where he found\nHumphrey busily employed as usual; and, what was very unusual, extremely\ngrave.  It was not a pleasant task for Mr Heatherstone to have to\nexplain his conduct to so very young a man as Humphrey; but he felt that\nhe could not be comfortable until the evil impression against him was\nremoved, and he knew that Humphrey had a great deal of sterling good\nsense.  His reception was cool; but when the explanation was made,\nHumphrey was more than satisfied, as it showed that the Intendant had\nbeen their best friend, and that it was from a delicacy on the part of\nPatience, rather than from any other cause, that the misunderstanding\nhad occurred.  Humphrey inquired if he had permission to communicate the\nsubstance of their conversation to his brother, and Mr Heatherstone\nstated that such was his wish and intention when he confided it to\nHumphrey.  It is hardly necessary to say that Humphrey took the earliest\nopportunity of writing to Edward at the direction which Chaloner had\nleft with him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\n\nBut we must follow Edward for a time.  On his arrival at Paris he was\nkindly received by King Charles, who promised to assist his views in\njoining the army.\n\n\"You have to choose between two generals, both great in the art of war--\nConde and Turenne; I have no doubt that they will be opposed to each\nother soon--that will be the better for you, as you will learn tactics\nfrom such great players.\"\n\n\"Which would your majesty recommend me to follow?\" inquired Edward.\n\n\"Conde is my favourite, and he will soon be opposed to this truculent\nand dishonest court, who have kept me here as an instrument to\naccomplish their own wishes, but who have never intended to keep their\npromises and place me on the English throne.  I will give you letters to\nConde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you\nwill follow him, without pretending to calculate how far his movements\nmay be right or wrong--that is not your affair.  Conde is now just\nreleased from Vincennes; but, depend upon it, he will be in arms very\nsoon.\"\n\nAs soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king\nEdward presented himself at the levee of the prince of Conde.\n\n\"You are here highly spoken of,\" said the prince, \"for so young a man.\nSo you were at the affair of Worcester?  We will retain you, for your\nservices will be wanted by and by.  Can you procure any of your\ncountrymen?\"\n\n\"I know but of two that I can recommend from personal knowledge; but\nthese two officers I can venture to pledge myself for.\"\n\n\"Any more?\"\n\n\"That I cannot at present reply to your highness--but I should think it\nvery possible.\"\n\n\"Bring me the officers to-morrow at this hour, Monsieur Beverley--_au\nrevoir_.\"\n\nThe prince of Conde then passed on to speak to other officers and\ngentlemen who were waiting to pay their respects.\n\nEdward went to Chaloner and Grenville, who were delighted with the\nintelligence which he brought them.  The next day they were at the\nprince's levee, and introduced by Edward.\n\n\"I am fortunate, gentlemen,\" said the prince, \"in securing the services\nof such fine young men.  You will oblige me by enlisting as many of your\ncountrymen as you may consider likely to do good service, and then\nfollow me to Guienne, to which province I am now about to depart.  Be\npleased to put yourself into communication with the parties named in\nthis paper, and after my absence you will receive from them every\nassistance and necessary supplies which may be required.\"\n\nA month after this interview, Conde, who had been joined by a great\nnumber of nobles, and had been reinforced by troops from Spain, set up\nthe standard of revolt.  Edward and his friends joined them, with about\n300 English and Scotch, whom they had enlisted, and very soon afterwards\nConde obtained the victory at Blenan, and in April 1652 advanced to\nParis.\n\nTurenne, who had taken the command of the French army, followed him, and\na severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb D'Antoine, in\nwhich neither party had the advantage.  But eventually Conde was beaten\nback by the superior force of Turenne; and not receiving the assistance\nhe expected from the Spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of\nChampagne.\n\nPrevious to his departure from Paris, Edward had received Humphrey's\nletter, explaining away the Intendant's conduct; and the contents\nremoved a heavy load from Edward's mind; but he now thought of nothing\nbut war, and although he cherished the idea of Patience Heatherstone, he\nwas resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could.\nHe wrote a letter to the Intendant, thanking him for his kind feelings\nand intentions towards him, and he trusted that he might one day have\nthe pleasure of seeing him again.  He did not, however, think it\nadvisable to mention the name of his daughter, except in inquiring after\nher health, and sending his respects.  \"It may be years before I see her\nagain,\" thought Edward, \"and who knows what may happen?\"\n\nThe prince of Conde now had the command of the Spanish forces in the\nNetherlands; and Edward, with his friends, followed his fortunes, and\ngained his good-will: they were rapidly promoted.\n\nTime flew on, and in the year 1654 the court of France concluded an\nalliance with Cromwell, and expelled King Charles from the French\nfrontiers.  The war was still carried on in the Netherlands.  Turenne\nbore down Conde, who had gained every campaign; and the court of Spain,\nwearied with reverses, made overtures of peace, which were gladly\naccepted by the French.\n\nDuring these wars Cromwell had been named Protector, and had shortly\nafterwards died.\n\nEdward, who but rarely heard from Humphrey, was now anxious to quit the\narmy and go to the king, who was in Spain; but to leave his colours\nwhile things were adverse was impossible.\n\nAfter the peace and the pardon of Conde by the French king, the armies\nwere disbanded, and the three adventurers were free.  They took their\nleave of the prince, who thanked them for their long and meritorious\nservices; and they then hastened to King Charles, who had left Spain and\ncome to the Low Countries.  At the time of their joining the king,\nRichard, the son of Cromwell, who had been nominated Protector, had\nresigned, and everything was ready for the Restoration.\n\nOn the 15th of May 1660 the news arrived that Charles had been\nproclaimed king on the 8th, and a large body of gentlemen went to invite\nhim over.  The king sailed from Scheveling, was met at Dover by General\nMonk, and conducted to London, which he entered amidst the acclamations\nof the people, on the 29th of the same month.\n\nWe may leave the reader to suppose that Edward, Chaloner, and Grenville\nwere among the most favoured of those in his train.  As the procession\nmoved slowly along the Strand, through a countless multitude, the\nwindows of all the houses were filled with well-dressed ladies, who\nwaved their white kerchiefs to the king and his attendant suite.\nChaloner, Edward, and Grenville, who rode side by side as gentlemen in\nwaiting, were certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue.\n\n\"Look, Edward,\" said Chaloner, \"at those two lovely girls at yon window.\nDo you recognise them?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do not.  Are they any of our Paris beauties?\"\n\n\"Why, thou insensible and unnatural animal!  They are thy sisters, Alice\nand Edith: and do you not recognise behind them my good aunts\nConynghame?\"\n\n\"It is so, I believe,\" replied Edward.  \"Yes, now that Edith smiles, I'm\nsure it is they.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Grenville, \"there can be no doubt of that; but will they,\nthink you, recognise us?\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Edward, as they now approached within a few\nyards of the window; for while they had been speaking the procession had\nstopped.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" thought Edward, \"that these can be the two girls in\nrusset gowns that I left at the cottage?  And yet it must be.  Well,\nChaloner, to all appearance, your good aunts have done justice to their\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Nature has done more, Edward.  I never thought that they would have\ngrown into such lovely girls as they have, although I always thought\nthat they were handsome.\"\n\nAs they passed Edward caught the eye of Edith, and smiled.\n\n\"Alice, that's Edward!\" said Edith, so loud as to be heard by the king,\nand all near him.\n\nAlice and Edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs, but they were\nobliged to cease, and put them to their eyes.\n\n\"Are those your sisters, Edward?\" said the king.\n\n\"They are, your majesty.\"\n\nThe king rose in his stirrups, and made a low obeisance to the window\nwhere they were standing.\n\n\"We shall have some court beauties, Beverley,\" said the king, looking at\nhim over his shoulder.\n\nAs soon as the ceremonies were over, and they could escape from their\nattendance on the king's person, Edward and his two friends went to the\nhouse in which resided the Ladies Conynghame and his sisters.\n\nWe pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years' absence, and\nthe pleasure which it gave to Edward to find his sisters grown such\naccomplished and elegant young women.  That his two friends, who were,\nas the reader will recollect, old acquaintances of Alice and Edith, were\nwarmly received, we hardly need say.\n\n\"Now, Edward, who do you think was here to-day--the reigning belle, and\nthe toast of all the gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Indeed!  I must be careful of my heart.  Dear Edith, who is she?\"\n\n\"No less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted, Edward--\nPatience Heatherstone.\"\n\n\"Patience Heatherstone,\" cried Edward, \"the toast of all London!\"\n\n\"Yes; and deservedly so, I can assure you: but she is as good as she is\nhandsome, and, moreover, treats all the gay gallants with perfect\nindifference.  She is staying with her uncle, Sir Ashley Cooper; and her\nfather is also in town, for he called here with her to-day.\"\n\n\"When did you hear from Humphrey, Edith?\"\n\n\"A few days back.  He has left the cottage now, altogether.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  Where does he reside then?\"\n\n\"At Arnwood.  The house has been rebuilt, and I understand is a very\nprincely mansion.  Humphrey has charge of it, until it is ascertained to\nwhom it is to belong.\"\n\n\"It belongs to Mr Heatherstone, does it not?\" replied Edward.\n\n\"How can you say so, Edward?  You received Humphrey's letters a long\nwhile ago.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did; but let us not talk about it any more, my dear Edith.  I am\nin great perplexity.\"\n\n\"Nay, dear brother, let us talk about it,\" said Alice, who had come up\nand overheard the latter portion of the conversation.\n\n\"What is your perplexity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Edward, \"since it is to be so, let us sit down and talk\nover the matter.  I acknowledge the kindness of Mr Heatherstone, and\nfeel that all he asserted to Humphrey is true; still I do not like that\nI should be indebted to him for a property which is mine, and that he\nhas no right to give.  I acknowledge his generosity, but I do not\nacknowledge his right of possession.  Nay, much as I admire, and I may\nsay, fond as I am (for time has not effaced the feeling) of his\ndaughter, it still appears to me that, although not said, it is expected\nthat she is to be included in the transfer; and I will accept no wife on\nsuch conditions.\"\n\n\"That is to say, because all you wish for, your property and a woman you\nlove, are offered you in one lot, you will not accept them; they must be\ndivided, and handed over to you in two!\" said Alice, smiling.\n\n\"You mistake, dearest; I am not so foolish; but I have a certain pride,\nwhich you cannot blame.  Accepting the property from Mr Heatherstone is\nreceiving a favour, were it given as a marriage portion with his\ndaughter.  Now, why should I accept as a favour what I can claim as a\nright?  It is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the\nrestoration of my property.  He cannot refuse it.\"\n\n\"Put not your trust in princes, brother,\" replied Alice.  \"I doubt if\nthe king, or his council, will consider it advisable to make so many\ndiscontented as to restore property which has been so long held by\nothers, and by so doing create a host of enemies.  Recollect also that\nMr Heatherstone and his brother-in-law Sir Ashley Cooper have done the\nking much more service than you ever have, or can do.  They have been\nmost important agents in his restoration, and the king's obligations to\nthem are much greater than they are to you.  Besides, merely for what\nmay be called a point of honour, for it is no more, in what an\nunpleasant situation will you put his majesty!  At all events, Edward,\nrecollect you do not know what are the intentions of Mr Heatherstone;\nwait and see what he proffers first.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sister, it appears to me that his intentions are evident.\nWhy has he rebuilt Arnwood?  He is not going to surrender my property\nand make me a present of the house.\"\n\n\"The reason for rebuilding the mansion was good.  You were at the wars;\nit was possible that you might or that you might not return.  He said\nthis to Humphrey, who has all along been acting as his factotum in the\nbusiness; and recollect, at the time that Mr Heatherstone commenced the\nrebuilding of the mansion, what prospect was there of the restoration of\nthe king, or of your ever being in a position to apply for the\nrestoration of your property?  I believe, however, that Humphrey knows\nmore of Mr Heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us; and\nI therefore say again, my dear Edward, make no application till you\nascertain what Mr Heatherstone's intentions may be.\"\n\n\"Your advice is good, my dear Alice, and I will be guided by it,\"\nreplied Edward.\n\n\"And now let me give you some advice for your friends, Masters Chaloner\nand Grenville.  That much of their property has been taken away and put\ninto other hands, I know; and probably they expect it will be restored\nupon their application to the king.  Those who hold the property think\nso too, and so far it is fortunate.  Now, from wiser heads than mine, I\nhave been told that these applications will not be acceded to, as is\nsupposed; but, at the same time, if they were to meet the parties, and\nclose with them at once, before the king's intentions are known, they\nwould recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value.  Now\nis their time: even a few days' delay may make a difference.  They can\neasily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys.  Impress that upon\nthem, my dear Edward, and let them, if possible, be off to their estates\nto-morrow and make the arrangements.\"\n\n\"That is advice which must be followed,\" replied Edward.  \"We must go\nnow, and I will not fail to communicate it to them this very night.\"\n\nWe may as well here inform the reader that the advice was immediately\nacted upon, and that Chaloner and Grenville recovered all their estates\nat about five years' purchase.\n\nEdward remained at court several days.  He had written to Humphrey, and\nhad despatched a messenger with the letter, but the messenger had not\nyet returned.  The court was now one continual scene of fetes and\ngaiety.  On the following day a drawing-room was to be held, and\nEdward's sisters were to be presented.  Edward was standing, with many\nothers of the suite, behind the chair of the king, amusing himself with\nthe presentations as they took place, and waiting for the arrival of his\nsisters.  Chaloner and Grenville were not with him, they had obtained\nleave to go into the country, for the object we have before referred\nto--when his eyes caught, advancing towards the king, Mr Heatherstone,\nwho led his daughter Patience.  That they had not perceived him was\nevident; indeed her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity\nfelt by a young woman in the presence of royalty.  Edward half concealed\nhimself behind one of his companions, that he might gaze upon her\nwithout reserve.  She was indeed a lovely young person, but little\naltered, except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her\nfigure; and her court-dress displayed proportions which her humble\ncostume at the New Forest had concealed, or which time had not matured.\nThere was the same pensive sweet expression in her face, which had\naltered little; but the beautiful rounded arms, the symmetrical fall of\nthe shoulders, and the proportion of the whole figure, was a surprise to\nhim; and Edward, in his own mind, agreed that she might well be the\nreigning toast of the day.\n\nMr Heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance, and then his daughter\nwas led forward, and introduced by a lady unknown to Edward.  After he\nhad saluted her, the king said, loud enough for Edward to hear--\n\n\"My obligations to your father are great.  I trust that the daughter\nwill often grace our court.\"  Patience made no reply, but passed on;\nand, soon afterwards, Edward lost sight of her in the crowd.  If there\never had been any check to Edward's feelings towards Patience--and time\nand absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers--the sight\nof her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic; and he was\nuneasy till the ceremony was over, and he was enabled to go to his\nsisters.\n\nWhen he entered the room he found himself in the arms of Humphrey, who\nhad arrived with the messenger.  After the greetings were over, Edward\nsaid--\n\n\"Alice, I have seen Patience, and I fear I must surrender at discretion.\nMr Heatherstone may make his own terms; I must waive all pride rather\nthan lose her.  I thought that I had more control over myself; but I\nhave seen her, and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining\nher as a wife.  Let her father but give me her, and Arnwood will be but\na trifle in addition!\"\n\n\"With respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess Arnwood,\"\nsaid Humphrey, \"I can inform you what they are.  They are wholly\nunshackled, further than that you are to repay by instalments the money\nexpended in the building of the house.  This I am empowered to state to\nyou, and I think you will allow that Mr Heatherstone has fully acted up\nto what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the\nproperty.\"\n\n\"He has, indeed,\" replied Edward.\n\n\"As for his daughter, Edward, you have yet to `win her and wear her,' as\nthe saying is.  Her father will resign the property to you as yours by\nright; but you have no property in his daughter, and I suspect that she\nwill not be quite so easily handed over to you.\"\n\n\"But why should you say so, Humphrey?  Have we not been attached from\nour youth?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was a youthful passion, I grant; but recollect, nothing came of\nit, and years have passed away.  It is now seven years since you quitted\nthe forest, and in your letters to Mr Heatherstone you made no remark\nupon what had passed between you and Patience.  Since that, you have\nnever corresponded or sent any messages; and you can hardly expect that\na girl, from the age of seventeen to twenty-four, will cherish the image\nof one who, to say the least, had treated her with indifference.  That\nis my view of the matter, Edward.  It may be wrong.\"\n\n\"And it may be true,\" replied Edward mournfully.\n\n\"Well, my view is different,\" replied Edith.  \"You know, Humphrey, how\nmany offers Patience Heatherstone has had, and has every day, I may say.\nWhy has she refused them all?  In my opinion, because she has been\nconstant to a proud brother of mine, who does not deserve her!\"\n\n\"It may be so, Edith,\" replied Humphrey.  \"Women are riddles--I only\nargued upon the common sense of the thing.\"\n\n\"Much you know about women,\" replied Edith.  \"To be sure, you do not\nmeet many in the New Forest, where you have lived all your life.\"\n\n\"Very true, my dear sister; perhaps that is the reason that the New\nForest has had such charms for me.\"\n\n\"After that speech, sir, the sooner you get back again the better!\"\nretorted Edith.  But Edward made a sign to Humphrey, and they beat a\nretreat.\n\n\"Have you seen the Intendant, Humphrey?\"\n\n\"No; I was about to call upon him, but I wanted to see you first.\"\n\n\"I will go with you.  I have not done him justice,\" replied Edward, \"and\nyet I hardly know how to explain to him--\"\n\n\"Say nothing, but meet him cordially; that will be explanation\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"I shall meet him as one whom I shall always revere, and feel that I owe\na deep debt of gratitude.  What must he think of my not having called\nupon him?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  You hold a place at court.  You may not have known that he\nwas in London, as you have never met him; your coming with me will make\nit appear so.  Tell him that I have just made known to you his noble and\ndisinterested conduct.\"\n\n\"You are right--I will.  I fear, however, Humphrey, that you are right,\nand Edith wrong, as regards his daughter.\"\n\n\"Nay, Edward, recollect that I have, as Edith observed, passed my life\nin the woods.\"\n\nEdward was most kindly received by Mr Heatherstone.  Edward, on Mr\nHeatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to Arnwood,\nexpressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct, simply adding--\n\n\"You may think me impetuous, sir; but I trust you will believe me\ngrateful.\"\n\nPatience coloured up and trembled when Edward first saw her.  Edward did\nnot refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their\nacquaintance.  He wooed her again, and won her.  Then all was explained.\n\nAbout a year after the Restoration there was a fete at Hampton Court,\ngiven in honour of three marriages taking place--Edward Beverley to\nPatience Heatherstone, Chaloner to Alice, and Grenville to Edith; and,\nas his majesty himself said, as he gave away the brides, \"Could loyalty\nbe better rewarded?\"\n\nBut our young readers will not be content if they do not hear some\nparticulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little\nhistory.  Humphrey must take the first place.  His love of farming\ncontinued.  Edward gave him a large farm, rent free; and in a few years\nHumphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself.  He\nthen married Clara Ratcliffe, who has not appeared lately on the scene,\nowing to her having been, about two years before the Restoration,\nclaimed by an elderly relation, who lived in the country, and whose\ninfirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house.  He left\nhis property to Clara, about a year after her marriage to Humphrey.  The\ncottage in the New Forest was held by, and eventually made over to,\nPablo, who became a very steady character, and in the course of time\nmarried a young girl from Arnwood, and had a houseful of young gipsies.\nOswald, so soon as Edward came down to Arnwood, gave up his place in the\nNew Forest, and lived entirely with Edward as his steward; and Phoebe\nalso went to Arnwood, and lived to a good old age, in the capacity of\nhousekeeper, her temper becoming rather worse than better as she\nadvanced in years.\n\nThis is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several\nparties; and so now we must say farewell.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Children of the New Forest, by Captain Marryat\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 21558.txt or 21558.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/1\/5\/5\/21558\/\n\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1110,"split":"test"}
