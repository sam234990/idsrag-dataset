{"ori_id":"0619e886fb3167a3d70f4d191754a82b3f9ecf7f","title":"Lorna Doone","context":"Lorna Doone\n The book is set in the 17th century in the Badgworthy Water region of Exmoor in Devon and Somerset, England. John (in West Country dialect, pronounced \"Jan\") Ridd is the son of a respectable farmer who was murdered in cold blood by one of the notorious Doone clan, a once noble family, now outlaws, in the isolated Doone Valley. Battling his desire for revenge, John also grows into a respectable farmer and takes good care of his mother and two sisters. He falls hopelessly in love with Lorna, a girl he meets by accident, who turns out to be not only (apparently) the granddaughter of Sir Ensor Doone (lord of the Doones), but destined to marry (against her will) the impetuous, menacing, and now jealous heir of the Doone Valley, Carver Doone. Carver will let nothing get in the way of his marriage to Lorna, which he plans to force upon her once Sir Ensor dies and he comes into his inheritance.\nSir Ensor dies, and Carver becomes lord of the Doones. John Ridd helps Lorna escape to his family's farm, Plover's Barrows. Since Lorna is a member of the hated Doone clan, feelings are mixed toward her in the Ridd household, but she is nonetheless defended against the enraged Carver's retaliatory attack on the farm. A member of the Ridd household notices Lorna's necklace, a jewel that she was told by Sir Ensor belonged to her mother. During a visit from the Counsellor, Carver's father and the wisest of the Doone family, the necklace is stolen from Plover's Barrows. Shortly after its disappearance, a family friend discovers Lorna's origins, learning that the necklace belonged to a Lady Dugal, who was robbed and murdered by a band of outlaws. Only her daughter survived the attack. It becomes apparent that Lorna, being evidently the long-lost girl in question, is in fact heiress to one of the largest fortunes in the country, and not a Doone after all (although the Doones are remotely related, being descended from a collateral branch of the Dugal family). She is required by law, but against her will, to return to London to become a ward in Chancery. Despite John and Lorna's love for one another, their marriage is out of the question.\nKing Charles II dies, and the Duke of Monmouth (the late king's illegitimate son) challenges Charles's brother James for the throne. The Doones, abandoning their plan to marry Lorna to Carver and claim her wealth, side with Monmouth in the hope of reclaiming their ancestral lands. However, Monmouth is defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor, and his associates are sought for treason. John Ridd is captured during the revolution. Innocent of all charges, he is taken to London by an old friend to clear his name. There, he is reunited with Lorna (now Lorna Dugal), whose love for him has not diminished. When he thwarts an attack on Lorna's great-uncle and legal guardian Earl Brandir, John is granted a pardon, a title, and a coat of arms by the king and returns a free man to Exmoor.\nIn the meantime, the surrounding communities have grown tired of the Doones and their depredations. Knowing the Doones better than any other man, John leads the attack on their land. All the Doone men are killed, except the Counsellor (from whom John retrieves the stolen necklace) and his son Carver, who escapes, vowing revenge. When Earl Brandir dies and Judge Jeffreys, as Lord Chancellor, becomes Lorna's guardian, she is granted her freedom to return to Exmoor and marry John. During their wedding, Carver bursts into the church at Oare. He shoots Lorna and flees. Distraught and filled with blinding rage, John pursues and confronts him. A struggle ensues in which Carver is left sinking in a mire. Exhausted and bloodied from the fight, John can only pant as he watches Carver slip away. He returns to discover that Lorna is not dead, and after a period of anxious uncertainty, she survives to live happily ever after.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lorna Doone, by R.

Blackmore\n\n\nCopyright, 1889, by The Burrows Brothers Company\n\n\n[Illustration: map]\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThis work is called a \"romance,\" because the incidents, characters,\ntime, and scenery, are alike romantic. And in shaping this old tale, the\nWriter neither dares, nor desires, to claim for it the dignity or cumber\nit with the difficulty of an historic novel.\n\nAnd yet he thinks that the outlines are filled in more carefully, and\nthe situations (however simple) more warmly coloured and quickened, than\na reader would expect to find in what is called a \"legend.\"\n\nAnd he knows that any son of Exmoor, chancing on this volume, cannot\nfail to bring to mind the nurse-tales of his childhood--the savage deeds\nof the outlaw Doones in the depth of Bagworthy Forest, the beauty of\nthe hapless maid brought up in the midst of them, the plain John Ridd's\nHerculean power, and (memory's too congenial food) the exploits of Tom\nFaggus.\n\nMarch, 1869.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION\n\nFew things have surprised me more, and nothing has more pleased me, than\nthe great success of this simple tale.\n\nFor truly it is a grand success to win the attention and kind regard,\nnot of the general public only, but also of those who are at home with\nthe scenery, people, life, and language, wherein a native cannot always\nsatisfy the natives.\n\nTherefore any son of Devon may imagine, and will not grudge, the\nWriter's delight at hearing from a recent visitor to the west that\n'\"Lorna Doone,' to a Devonshire man, is as good as clotted cream,\nalmost!\"\n\nAlthough not half so good as that, it has entered many a tranquil,\nhappy, pure, and hospitable home, and the author, while deeply grateful\nfor this genial reception, ascribes it partly to the fact that his story\ncontains no word or thought disloyal to its birthright in the fairest\ncounty of England.\n\n[Illustration: autograph.jpg]\n\nJanuary, 1873.\n\n\n\n\nPUBLISHERS' PREFACE\n\nIn putting this new and somewhat elaborate edition of \"Lorna Doone\" upon\na market already supplied with various others, some of them excellent\nin quality, we ask the literary men and women of the country to give us\ntheir kind support for the reasons set forth herewith.\n\nIn the first place, it seems to us that of the countless thousands of\nbooks that have been written in all the various languages, and during\nthe many ages since first man took to scribbling, no one has ever\nyet appeared which is the equal of this in its delicate and beautiful\ntouches of both nature and human nature. We have had, in various ways,\nabundant proof that our feeling in this respect is not individual to\nourselves, and we desire to thank heartily the many friends who have\nsent us their words and letters of encouragement, sympathy, and interest\nduring the past year as they have by chance become aware of our plans.\n\nWhile there were creditable editions already published, the fact that\nnone existed just such as we ourselves wished for our own library was\nour primary incentive in undertaking this task. The labor upon which\nwe entered was in short, one of love, and great as has been the\nexpenditure of time, trouble, and money in the preparation of this book,\nwe have faith to believe that there are a sufficient number of lovers of\nthe peerless maiden, _Lorna_, to greet her appearance in this new dress\nwith an enthusiasm that will in time repay us.\n\nWe earnestly hope that our judgment in the selection of artists, means,\nand materials has been, in the main, at least, wise, and that such, will\nbe the verdict of book-lovers. Also, we hope that our lack of experience\nas publishers will disarm the critic, and that he will examine the book\nregarding only the excellences which he may find, and passing over its\ndefects.\n\nOne special feature we wish particularly to call to the attention of\nall, and that is the beautiful map of the country we have introduced.\nThis may be regarded by some as an innovation in a romance, but we\nhope that it will be found such a manifest convenience as to be its own\nsufficient excuse.\n\nIn this place it seems to be a duty, also, to call attention to the\nsympathizing and intelligent interest that has been so freely shown by\nthe noble band of workers, artists, printers, engravers, etc., who have\nassisted us upon this work. To Mr. Henry Sandham, Mr. George Wharton\nEdwards, Mr. Harry Fenn, Mr. William Hamilton Gibson, Mr. W. H. Drake,\nMr. Irving R. Wiles, Mr. George E. Graves, Mr. Charles Copeland, Mr.\nHarper Pennington, Mrs. Margaret MacDonald Pullman, Miss Harriet Thayer\nDurgin, Mr. A. V. S. Anthony, Mr. George T. Andrew, Goupil & Co. of\nParis, Mr. Kurtz, The Wright Gravure Co., Mr. Fillebrown, Mr. William J.\nDana, and our very able printers, Messrs. Fleming, Brewster & Alley-to\nthem all we therefore extend our cordial acknowledgment of our\nindebtedness for their services.

Page\n835.\n\nA novel that has stood the test of time so well as Mr. Blackmore's\ncharming story of \"Lorna Doone\" scarcely needs a preface. Certainly no\nword of introduction is necessary to testify to its exquisite humor, its\ndramatic force, its under-current of poetic feeling, its fine touches of\nlandscape-painting, and the novelty and interest of its subject. Since\nit first appeared in 1869 all these have become as household words,\nonly, perhaps, all the admirers of \"Lorna Doone\" have not had the good\nfortune to wander through the romantic and picturesque region where\nthe scene of the story is laid. To travel in North Devon, and over its\nborder into Somerset (\"the Summerland,\" as the old Northmen call it),\nis to be confronted with the scenes of the novel at every turn; for Mr.\nBlackmore has so successfully woven the legends of the whole countryside\ninto his story that one grows to believe it a veritable history, and is\nas disappointed to find traces of the romancer's own hand here and there\nas to find the hills and valleys laid bare of the forests which adorned\nthem in the time of the Doones.\n\nIt is a singular country, this Devonshire coast, made up as it is of\na series of rocky headlands jutting far out into the sea, and holding\nbetween their stretching arms deep fertile wooded valleys called\n_combes_ (pronounced _coomes_), watered by trout and salmon streams, and\nfilled with an Italian profusion of vegetation, myrtles and fuchsias,\ngrowing in the open air, and the walls hidden with a luxuriant tapestry\nof ferns and ivies and blossoming vines. Even the roofs are covered with\nflowers; every cranny bears a blossom or a tuft of green. Then above,\nlong stretches of barren heath (with a few twisted and wind-tortured\ntrees), where the sheep pasture and the sky-lark sings, and in and out\nof the red-fronted cliffs the querulous sea-gulls flash in the sunshine,\nand make their plaintive moan. Near Lynton there is the famous Valley of\nRocks, where the wise woman, _Mother Melldrum_, had her winter quarters\nunder the Devil's Cheese-wring.\n\n[Illustration: xiv.jpg Cheese-wring]\n\nThe irregular pile of rocks that goes by this name is wrongly called\nCheese-_ring_ (or _scoop_) in some editions of \"Lorna Doone,\" instead\nof Cheese-_wring_ or (_press_), which it somewhat resembles in shape.\nSouthey began the fortune of Lynton as a watering-place, and wrote\na glowing description of the village and the Valley of Rocks. Of the\nlatter he says: \"A palace of the pre-Adamite kings, a city of the Anakim\nmust have appeared so shapeless and yet so like the ruins of what had\nbeen shaped after the waters of the flood subsided.\" Great bowlders,\nhalf hidden by the bracken, lie about in wildest confusion; the remains\nof what seem to be Druidic circles can be traced here and there, and it\nis hard to persuade one's self that the ragged towers and picturesque\npiles of rock are not the work of Cyclopean architects.\n\n\"Our home-folk always call it the 'Danes,' or the 'Denes,' which is no\nmore, they tell me, than a hollow place, even as the word 'den' is,\"\nsays _John Ridd_. \"It is a pretty place,\" he adds, \"though nothing to\nfrighten any body, unless he hath lived in a gallipot.\" The valley is\nwell protected from the wind, and \"there is shelter and dry fern-bedding\nand folk to be seen in the distance from a bank whereon the sun shines.\"\nHere _John Ridd_ came to consult the wise woman toward the end of March,\nwhile the weather was still cold and piercing. In the warm days of\nsummer she lived \"in a pleasant cave facing the cool side of the hill,\nfar inland, near Hawkridge, and close over Tarr-steps--a wonderful\ncrossing of Barle River, made (as every body knows) by Satan for a\nwager.\" But the antiquarians of to-day assert that the curious steps\nwere made by the early British.\n\nNot far beyond the Valley of Rocks are the grounds of Ley Abbey, a\nmodern mansion, but occupying the site of Lev Manor, to whose owner,\n_Baron de Whichehalse, John Ridd_ accompanies _Master Huckaback_ in\nsearch of a warrant against the _Doones_. In fact, all the way from\nBarnstaple over the parapet of whose bridge _Tom Faggus_ leaped his\nwonderful mare, every nook and corner of the countryside teems with\nlegends of the _Doones_. From Lynton we drive over the border into\nPorlock, in Somerset that quaint little village where Coleridge wrote\nhis \"Kubla Khan,\" and where Lord Lovelace brought Ada Byron to his seat\nof Ashley Combe.\n\nIt was while riding home from Porlock market that _John Ridd's_ father\nwas murdered by the _Doones_, and from Porlock we drove in a pony-trap\nover the high moors to Malmsmead, in search of the ruined huts of the\n_Doones_.\n\n[Illustration: xv.jpg Malmsmead]\n\nOver the heights of Yarner Moor, and past Oare Ford (now bridged over),\nthe road lay past the old church of Oare, where _Lorna Doone_ and _John\nRidd_ were married, and then into the deep flowery lanes that are the\nglory of Devon and Somerset. Malmsmead proved to be a little cluster of\nheavily thatched cottages, nestled under overhanging trees, where stood\nan ancient signboard with \"Ba_d_gworthy\" on one of its arms, pointing\nthe way we should go. This _d_ on the old sign-board accounted for the\nlocal pronunciation of _Badgery_, as the river is always called.\n\nAt Malmsmead the road ends, and thence one must proceed on foot. Several\ndeep and flowery lanes lead one at length to the river where a lonely\nstone cottage stands on its further brink. This is Clowd Farm, and here\nall paths cease. Two hundred years ago, in the time of the _Doones_,\nthe narrow valley through which the Bagworthy now dances in the open\nsunshine was filled with trees; but now, with the exception of a\nwithered and stunted old orchard and grove near the farm, there is not a\ntree to be seen, and the Bagworthy, a lonely but cheerful trout stream,\nrattles along in the broad sunshine through a deep valley, whose sides\nslope steeply upward.\n\nAfter walking about three miles into the heart of the wilderness,\nanother deep glen, shut in by the same sloping heather-covered hills,\nsuddenly opens to the right. There are no cliffs, no overhanging trees,\nnot even a bush, but all along the stream, \"with its soft, dark babble,\"\nlie heaps and half-circles of stone nearly buried in the turf, and\nalmost hidden by the tall ferns and foxgloves. And this is what we went\nout for to see! These are the ruins of the _Doones'_ huts. There could\nnot be anything more disappointing. Two hundred years have effectually\ndestroyed all distinctive traits, and they might have been sheep-folds\nor pig-sties, or any other innocent agricultural erection for aught\nthat we could tell. \"Not a single house stood there but was the home of\nmurder,\" says their historian. The suns and rains of two hundred and\nodd years have effectually washed out their blood-stains, and there is\nnothing left there but peace.\n\nSome way beyond the ruins stands a small stone cottage of the most\nmodern order. We found it to be the abode of a shepherd, away with his\nflock on the hills, but his wife, no shepherdess of the Dresden china\norder, but a hearty and substantial dame, gave us a cordial welcome. She\nwas in a state of intense delight at our disappointment about the ruins,\nand discussed the situation in that soft Somersetshire accent that gives\nsuch breadth and jollity to the language. \"E'll not vind it a beet loike\nta buik,\" she said, with her cheery laugh. \"Buik's weel mad' up; it\nhoulds 'ee loike, and 'ee can't put it by, but there's nobbut three\npairts o't truth. Hunnerds cooms up here to se't,\" she added, with a\nchuckle.\n\nThe fact is that the traditional and the ideal are as inextricably mixed\nin this charming story of \"Lorna Doone\" as the thousand varieties of\nseeds in the fairy tale which the princess was expected to sort out, and\nit would be almost as difficult to separate them. Perhaps the best way,\nafter all, is--not to try.\n\nKatharine Hillard.\n\n[Illustration: map]\n\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n     I.       ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION\n\n     II.

And they who\nlight upon this book should bear in mind not only that I write for the\nclearing of our parish from ill fame and calumny, but also a thing which\nwill, I trow, appear too often in it, to wit--that I am nothing more\nthan a plain unlettered man, not read in foreign languages, as a\ngentleman might be, nor gifted with long words (even in mine own\ntongue), save what I may have won from the Bible or Master William\nShakespeare, whom, in the face of common opinion, I do value highly. In\nshort, I am an ignoramus, but pretty well for a yeoman.\n\nMy father being of good substance, at least as we reckon in Exmoor, and\nseized in his own right, from many generations, of one, and that the\nbest and largest, of the three farms into which our parish is divided\n(or rather the cultured part thereof), he John Ridd, the elder,\nchurchwarden, and overseer, being a great admirer of learning, and well\nable to write his name, sent me his only son to be schooled at Tiverton,\nin the county of Devon. For the chief boast of that ancient town (next\nto its woollen staple) is a worthy grammar-school, the largest in the\nwest of England, founded and handsomely endowed in the year 1604 by\nMaster Peter Blundell, of that same place, clothier.\n\nHere, by the time I was twelve years old, I had risen into the upper\nschool, and could make bold with Eutropius and C\u00c3\u00a6sar--by aid of an\nEnglish version--and as much as six lines of Ovid. Some even said that\nI might, before manhood, rise almost to the third form, being of a\npersevering nature; albeit, by full consent of all (except my mother),\nthick-headed. But that would have been, as I now perceive, an ambition\nbeyond a farmer's son; for there is but one form above it, and that made\nof masterful scholars, entitled rightly \"monitors\". So it came to\npass, by the grace of God, that I was called away from learning,\nwhilst sitting at the desk of the junior first in the upper school, and\nbeginning the Greek verb\n\n[Illustration: greek1.jpg]\n\nMy eldest grandson makes bold to say that I never could have learned\n\n[Illustration: greek2.jpg]\n\nten pages further on, being all he himself could manage, with plenty of\nstripes to help him. I know that he hath more head than I--though never\nwill he have such body; and am thankful to have stopped betimes, with a\nmeek and wholesome head-piece.\n\n[Illustration: 002.jpg John Ridd's School Desk]\n\nBut if you doubt of my having been there, because now I know so little,\ngo and see my name, \"John Ridd,\" graven on that very form. Forsooth,\nfrom the time I was strong enough to open a knife and to spell my name,\nI began to grave it in the oak, first of the block whereon I sate, and\nthen of the desk in front of it, according as I was promoted from one to\nother of them: and there my grandson reads it now, at this present time\nof writing, and hath fought a boy for scoffing at it--\"John Ridd his\nname\"--and done again in \"winkeys,\" a mischievous but cheerful device,\nin which we took great pleasure.\n\nThis is the manner of a \"winkey,\" which I here set down, lest child\nof mine, or grandchild, dare to make one on my premises; if he does,\nI shall know the mark at once, and score it well upon him. The scholar\nobtains, by prayer or price, a handful of saltpetre, and then with the\nknife wherewith he should rather be trying to mend his pens, what does\nhe do but scoop a hole where the desk is some three inches thick. This\nhole should be left with the middle exalted, and the circumference dug\nmore deeply. Then let him fill it with saltpetre, all save a little\nspace in the midst, where the boss of the wood is. Upon that boss (and\nit will be the better if a splinter of timber rise upward) he sticks the\nend of his candle of tallow, or \"rat's tail,\" as we called it, kindled\nand burning smoothly. Anon, as he reads by that light his lesson,\nlifting his eyes now and then it may be, the fire of candle lays hold of\nthe petre with a spluttering noise and a leaping. Then should the pupil\nseize his pen, and, regardless of the nib, stir bravely, and he will see\na glow as of burning mountains, and a rich smoke, and sparks going\nmerrily; nor will it cease, if he stir wisely, and there be a good store\nof petre, until the wood is devoured through, like the sinking of a\nwell-shaft. Now well may it go with the head of a boy intent upon his\nprimer, who betides to sit thereunder! But, above all things, have good\ncare to exercise this art before the master strides up to his desk, in\nthe early gray of the morning.\n\nOther customs, no less worthy, abide in the school of Blundell, such as\nthe singeing of nightcaps; but though they have a pleasant savour, and\nrefreshing to think of, I may not stop to note them, unless it be that\ngoodly one at the incoming of a flood. The school-house stands beside a\nstream, not very large, called Lowman, which flows into the broad river\nof Exe, about a mile below. This Lowman stream, although it be not fond\nof brawl and violence (in the manner of our Lynn), yet is wont to flood\ninto a mighty head of waters when the storms of rain provoke it; and\nmost of all when its little co-mate, called the Taunton Brook--where\nI have plucked the very best cresses that ever man put salt on--comes\nfoaming down like a great roan horse, and rears at the leap of the\nhedgerows. Then are the gray stone walls of Blundell on every side\nencompassed, the vale is spread over with looping waters, and it is a\nhard thing for the day-boys to get home to their suppers.\n\nAnd in that time, old Cop, the porter (so called because he hath copper\nboots to keep the wet from his stomach, and a nose of copper also, in\nright of other waters), his place is to stand at the gate, attending to\nthe flood-boards grooved into one another, and so to watch the torrents\nrise, and not be washed away, if it please God he may help it. But long\nere the flood hath attained this height, and while it is only waxing,\ncertain boys of deputy will watch at the stoop of the drain-holes, and\nbe apt to look outside the walls when Cop is taking a cordial. And in\nthe very front of the gate, just without the archway, where the ground\nis paved most handsomely, you may see in copy-letters done a great\nP.B. of white pebbles. Now, it is the custom and the law that when\nthe invading waters, either fluxing along the wall from below the\nroad-bridge, or pouring sharply across the meadows from a cut called\nOwen's Ditch--and I myself have seen it come both ways--upon the very\ninstant when the waxing element lips though it be but a single pebble of\nthe founder's letters, it is in the license of any boy, soever small\nand undoctrined, to rush into the great school-rooms, where a score of\nmasters sit heavily, and scream at the top of his voice, \"P.B.\"\n\nThen, with a yell, the boys leap up, or break away from their standing;\nthey toss their caps to the black-beamed roof, and haply the very books\nafter them; and the great boys vex no more the small ones, and the small\nboys stick up to the great ones. One with another, hard they go, to see\nthe gain of the waters, and the tribulation of Cop, and are prone to\nkick the day-boys out, with words of scanty compliment. Then the masters\nlook at one another, having no class to look to, and (boys being no more\nleft to watch) in a manner they put their mouths up. With a spirited\nbang they close their books, and make invitation the one to the other\nfor pipes and foreign cordials, recommending the chance of the time, and\nthe comfort away from cold water.\n\nBut, lo! I am dwelling on little things and the pigeons' eggs of the\ninfancy, forgetting the bitter and heavy life gone over me since then.\nIf I am neither a hard man nor a very close one, God knows I have had no\nlack of rubbing and pounding to make stone of me. Yet can I not somehow\nbelieve that we ought to hate one another, to live far asunder, and\nblock the mouth each of his little den; as do the wild beasts of the\nwood, and the hairy outrangs now brought over, each with a chain upon\nhim. Let that matter be as it will. It is beyond me to unfold, and\nmayhap of my grandson's grandson. All I know is that wheat is better\nthan when I began to sow it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAN IMPORTANT ITEM\n\n[Illustration: 005.jpg The School Room]\n\nNow the cause of my leaving Tiverton school, and the way of it, were as\nfollows. On the 29th day of November, in the year of our Lord 1673, the\nvery day when I was twelve years old, and had spent all my substance in\nsweetmeats, with which I made treat to the little boys, till the large\nboys ran in and took them, we came out of school at five o'clock, as\nthe rule is upon Tuesdays. According to custom we drove the day-boys\nin brave rout down the causeway from the school-porch even to the gate\nwhere Cop has his dwelling and duty. Little it recked us and helped\nthem less, that they were our founder's citizens, and haply his own\ngrand-nephews (for he left no direct descendants), neither did we much\ninquire what their lineage was. For it had long been fixed among us,\nwho were of the house and chambers, that these same day-boys were all\n\"caddes,\" as we had discovered to call it, because they paid no groat\nfor their schooling, and brought their own commons with them. In\nconsumption of these we would help them, for our fare in hall fed\nappetite; and while we ate their victuals, we allowed them freely to\ntalk to us. Nevertheless, we could not feel, when all the victuals\nwere gone, but that these boys required kicking from the premises\nof Blundell. And some of them were shopkeepers' sons, young grocers,\nfellmongers, and poulterers, and these to their credit seemed to know\nhow righteous it was to kick them. But others were of high family, as\nany need be, in Devon--Carews, and Bouchiers, and Bastards, and some of\nthese would turn sometimes, and strike the boy that kicked them. But\nto do them justice, even these knew that they must be kicked for not\npaying.\n\nAfter these \"charity-boys\" were gone, as in contumely we called\nthem--\"If you break my bag on my head,\" said one, \"how will feed thence\nto-morrow?\"--and after old Cop with clang of iron had jammed the double\ngates in under the scruff-stone archway, whereupon are Latin verses,\ndone in brass of small quality, some of us who were not hungry, and\ncared not for the supper-bell, having sucked much parliament and dumps\nat my only charges--not that I ever bore much wealth, but because I had\nbeen thrifting it for this time of my birth--we were leaning quite at\ndusk against the iron bars of the gate some six, or it may be seven of\nus, small boys all, and not conspicuous in the closing of the daylight\nand the fog that came at eventide, else Cop would have rated us up the\ngreen, for he was churly to little boys when his wife had taken their\nmoney. There was plenty of room for all of us, for the gate will hold\nnine boys close-packed, unless they be fed rankly, whereof is little\ndanger; and now we were looking out on the road and wishing we could get\nthere; hoping, moreover, to see a good string of pack-horses come by,\nwith troopers to protect them. For the day-boys had brought us word that\nsome intending their way to the town had lain that morning at Sampford\nPeveril, and must be in ere nightfall, because Mr. Faggus was after\nthem. Now Mr. Faggus was my first cousin and an honour to the family,\nbeing a Northmolton man of great renown on the highway from Barum town\neven to London. Therefore of course, I hoped that he would catch the\npackmen, and the boys were asking my opinion as of an oracle, about it.\n\nA certain boy leaning up against me would not allow my elbow room, and\nstruck me very sadly in the stomach part, though his own was full of my\nparliament. And this I felt so unkindly, that I smote him straightway in\nthe face without tarrying to consider it, or weighing the question duly.\nUpon this he put his head down, and presented it so vehemently at the\nmiddle of my waistcoat, that for a minute or more my breath seemed\ndropped, as it were, from my pockets, and my life seemed to stop from\ngreat want of ease. Before I came to myself again, it had been settled\nfor us that we should move to the \"Ironing-box,\" as the triangle of turf\nis called where the two causeways coming from the school-porch and the\nhall-porch meet, and our fights are mainly celebrated; only we must\nwait until the convoy of horses had passed, and then make a ring by\ncandlelight, and the other boys would like it. But suddenly there came\nround the post where the letters of our founder are, not from the way\nof Taunton but from the side of Lowman bridge, a very small string of\nhorses, only two indeed (counting for one the pony), and a red-faced man\non the bigger nag.\n\n\"Plaise ye, worshipful masters,\" he said, being feared of the gateway,\n\"carn 'e tull whur our Jan Ridd be?\"\n\n\"Hyur a be, ees fai, Jan Ridd,\" answered a sharp little chap, making\ngame of John Fry's language.\n\n\"Zhow un up, then,\" says John Fry poking his whip through the bars at\nus; \"Zhow un up, and putt un aowt.\"\n\nThe other little chaps pointed at me, and some began to hallo; but I\nknew what I was about.\n\n\"Oh, John, John,\" I cried, \"what's the use of your coming now, and Peggy\nover the moors, too, and it so cruel cold for her? The holidays don't\nbegin till Wednesday fortnight, John. To think of your not knowing\nthat!\"\n\nJohn Fry leaned forward in the saddle, and turned his eyes away from\nme; and then there was a noise in his throat like a snail crawling on a\nwindow-pane.\n\n\"Oh, us knaws that wull enough, Maister Jan; reckon every Oare-man knaw\nthat, without go to skoo-ull, like you doth. Your moother have kept arl\nthe apples up, and old Betty toorned the black puddens, and none dare\nset trap for a blagbird. Arl for thee, lad; every bit of it now for\nthee!\"\n\nHe checked himself suddenly, and frightened me. I knew that John Fry's\nway so well.\n\n\"And father, and father--oh, how is father?\" I pushed the boys right and\nleft as I said it. \"John, is father up in town! He always used to come\nfor me, and leave nobody else to do it.\"\n\n\"Vayther'll be at the crooked post, tother zide o' telling-house.* Her\ncoodn't lave 'ouze by raison of the Chirstmas bakkon comin' on, and zome\no' the cider welted.\"\n\n     * The \"telling-houses\" on the moor are rude cots where the\n     shepherds meet to \"tell\" their sheep at the end of the\n     pasturing season.\n\n\nHe looked at the nag's ears as he said it; and, being up to John Fry's\nways, I knew that it was a lie. And my heart fell like a lump of lead,\nand I leaned back on the stay of the gate, and longed no more to fight\nanybody. A sort of dull power hung over me, like the cloud of a brooding\ntempest, and I feared to be told anything. I did not even care to stroke\nthe nose of my pony Peggy, although she pushed it in through the rails,\nwhere a square of broader lattice is, and sniffed at me, and began to\ncrop gently after my fingers. But whatever lives or dies, business must\nbe attended to; and the principal business of good Christians is, beyond\nall controversy, to fight with one another.\n\n\"Come up, Jack,\" said one of the boys, lifting me under the chin; \"he\nhit you, and you hit him, you know.\"\n\n\"Pay your debts before you go,\" said a monitor, striding up to me, after\nhearing how the honour lay; \"Ridd, you must go through with it.\"\n\n\"Fight, for the sake of the junior first,\" cried the little fellow in my\near, the clever one, the head of our class, who had mocked John Fry, and\nknew all about the aorists, and tried to make me know it; but I never\nwent more than three places up, and then it was an accident, and I came\ndown after dinner. The boys were urgent round me to fight, though my\nstomach was not up for it; and being very slow of wit (which is not\nchargeable on me), I looked from one to other of them, seeking any cure\nfor it. Not that I was afraid of fighting, for now I had been three\nyears at Blundell's, and foughten, all that time, a fight at least once\nevery week, till the boys began to know me; only that the load on my\nheart was not sprightly as of the hay-field. It is a very sad thing to\ndwell on; but even now, in my time of wisdom, I doubt it is a fond thing\nto imagine, and a motherly to insist upon, that boys can do without\nfighting. Unless they be very good boys, and afraid of one another.\n\n\"Nay,\" I said, with my back against the wrought-iron stay of the gate,\nwhich was socketed into Cop's house-front: \"I will not fight thee now,\nRobin Snell, but wait till I come back again.\"\n\n\"Take coward's blow, Jack Ridd, then,\" cried half a dozen little boys,\nshoving Bob Snell forward to do it; because they all knew well enough,\nhaving striven with me ere now, and proved me to be their master--they\nknew, I say, that without great change, I would never accept that\ncontumely. But I took little heed of them, looking in dull wonderment\nat John Fry, and Smiler, and the blunderbuss, and Peggy. John Fry was\nscratching his head, I could see, and getting blue in the face, by the\nlight from Cop's parlour-window, and going to and fro upon Smiler, as if\nhe were hard set with it. And all the time he was looking briskly from\nmy eyes to the fist I was clenching, and methought he tried to wink at\nme in a covert manner; and then Peggy whisked her tail.\n\n\"Shall I fight, John?\" I said at last; \"I would an you had not come,\nJohn.\"\n\n\"Chraist's will be done; I zim thee had better faight, Jan,\" he\nanswered, in a whisper, through the gridiron of the gate; \"there be a\ndale of faighting avore thee. Best wai to begin gude taime laike. Wull\nthe geatman latt me in, to zee as thee hast vair plai, lad?\"\n\nHe looked doubtfully down at the colour of his cowskin boots, and the\nmire upon the horses, for the sloughs were exceedingly mucky. Peggy,\nindeed, my sorrel pony, being lighter of weight, was not crusted much\nover the shoulders; but Smiler (our youngest sledder) had been well in\nover his withers, and none would have deemed him a piebald, save of red\nmire and black mire. The great blunderbuss, moreover, was choked with a\ndollop of slough-cake; and John Fry's sad-coloured Sunday hat was indued\nwith a plume of marish-weed. All this I saw while he was dismounting,\nheavily and wearily, lifting his leg from the saddle-cloth as if with a\nsore crick in his back.\n\nBy this time the question of fighting was gone quite out of our\ndiscretion; for sundry of the elder boys, grave and reverend signors,\nwho had taken no small pleasure in teaching our hands to fight, to ward,\nto parry, to feign and counter, to lunge in the manner of sword-play,\nand the weaker child to drop on one knee when no cunning of fence might\nbaffle the onset--these great masters of the art, who would far liefer\nsee us little ones practise it than themselves engage, six or seven of\nthem came running down the rounded causeway, having heard that there\nhad arisen \"a snug little mill\" at the gate. Now whether that word\nhath origin in a Greek term meaning a conflict, as the best-read boys\nasseverated, or whether it is nothing more than a figure of similitude,\nfrom the beating arms of a mill, such as I have seen in counties where\nare no waterbrooks, but folk make bread with wind--it is not for a man\ndevoid of scholarship to determine. Enough that they who made the ring\nintituled the scene a \"mill,\" while we who must be thumped inside it\ntried to rejoice in their pleasantry, till it turned upon the stomach.\n\nMoreover, I felt upon me now a certain responsibility, a dutiful need to\nmaintain, in the presence of John Fry, the manliness of the Ridd family,\nand the honour of Exmoor. Hitherto none had worsted me, although in the\nthree years of my schooling, I had fought more than threescore battles,\nand bedewed with blood every plant of grass towards the middle of the\nIroning-box. And this success I owed at first to no skill of my own;\nuntil I came to know better; for up to twenty or thirty fights, I struck\nas nature guided me, no wiser than a father-long-legs in the heat of a\nlanthorn; but I had conquered, partly through my native strength, and\nthe Exmoor toughness in me, and still more that I could not see when I\nhad gotten my bellyful. But now I was like to have that and more; for\nmy heart was down, to begin with; and then Robert Snell was a bigger boy\nthan I had ever encountered, and as thick in the skull and hard in the\nbrain as even I could claim to be.\n\nI had never told my mother a word about these frequent strivings,\nbecause she was soft-hearted; neither had I told by father, because\nhe had not seen it. Therefore, beholding me still an innocent-looking\nchild, with fair curls on my forehead, and no store of bad language,\nJohn Fry thought this was the very first fight that ever had befallen\nme; and so when they let him at the gate, \"with a message to the\nheadmaster,\" as one of the monitors told Cop, and Peggy and Smiler were\ntied to the railings, till I should be through my business, John comes\nup to me with the tears in his eyes, and says, \"Doon't thee goo for to\ndo it, Jan; doon't thee do it, for gude now.\" But I told him that now it\nwas much too late to cry off; so he said, \"The Lord be with thee, Jan,\nand turn thy thumb-knuckle inwards.\"\n\nIt was not a very large piece of ground in the angle of the causeways,\nbut quite big enough to fight upon, especially for Christians, who loved\nto be cheek by jowl at it. The great boys stood in a circle around,\nbeing gifted with strong privilege, and the little boys had leave to lie\nflat and look through the legs of the great boys. But while we were yet\npreparing, and the candles hissed in the fog-cloud, old Phoebe, of more\nthan fourscore years, whose room was over the hall-porch, came hobbling\nout, as she always did, to mar the joy of the conflict. No one ever\nheeded her, neither did she expect it; but the evil was that two senior\nboys must always lose the first round of the fight, by having to lead\nher home again.\n\nI marvel how Robin Snell felt. Very likely he thought nothing of it,\nalways having been a boy of a hectoring and unruly sort. But I felt my\nheart go up and down as the boys came round to strip me; and greatly\nfearing to be beaten, I blew hot upon my knuckles. Then pulled I off\nmy little cut jerkin, and laid it down on my head cap, and over that my\nwaistcoat, and a boy was proud to take care of them. Thomas Hooper was\nhis name, and I remember how he looked at me. My mother had made that\nlittle cut jerkin, in the quiet winter evenings. And taken pride to loop\nit up in a fashionable way, and I was loth to soil it with blood, and\ngood filberds were in the pocket. Then up to me came Robin Snell (mayor\nof Exeter thrice since that), and he stood very square, and looking\nat me, and I lacked not long to look at him. Round his waist he had a\nkerchief busking up his small-clothes, and on his feet light pumpkin\nshoes, and all his upper raiment off. And he danced about in a way that\nmade my head swim on my shoulders, and he stood some inches over me. But\nI, being muddled with much doubt about John Fry and his errand, was only\nstripped of my jerkin and waistcoat, and not comfortable to begin.\n\n\"Come now, shake hands,\" cried a big boy, jumping in joy of the\nspectacle, a third-former nearly six feet high; \"shake hands, you little\ndevils. Keep your pluck up, and show good sport, and Lord love the\nbetter man of you.\"\n\nRobin took me by the hand, and gazed at me disdainfully, and then smote\nme painfully in the face, ere I could get my fence up.\n\n\"Whutt be 'bout, lad?\" cried John Fry; \"hutt un again, Jan, wull 'e?\nWell done then, our Jan boy.\"\n\nFor I had replied to Robin now, with all the weight and cadence of\npenthemimeral caesura (a thing, the name of which I know, but could\nnever make head nor tail of it), and the strife began in a serious\nstyle, and the boys looking on were not cheated. Although I could not\ncollect their shouts when the blows were ringing upon me, it was no\ngreat loss; for John Fry told me afterwards that their oaths went up\nlike a furnace fire. But to these we paid no heed or hap, being in the\nthick of swinging, and devoid of judgment. All I know is, I came to my\ncorner, when the round was over, with very hard pumps in my chest, and a\ngreat desire to fall away.\n\n\"Time is up,\" cried head-monitor, ere ever I got my breath again; and\nwhen I fain would have lingered awhile on the knee of the boy that held\nme. John Fry had come up, and the boys were laughing because he wanted a\nstable lanthorn, and threatened to tell my mother.\n\n\"Time is up,\" cried another boy, more headlong than head-monitor. \"If we\ncount three before the come of thee, thwacked thou art, and must go\nto the women.\" I felt it hard upon me. He began to count, one, too,\nthree--but before the \"three\" was out of his mouth, I was facing my foe,\nwith both hands up, and my breath going rough and hot, and resolved to\nwait the turn of it. For I had found seat on the knee of a boy sage and\nskilled to tutor me, who knew how much the end very often differs from\nthe beginning. A rare ripe scholar he was; and now he hath routed up the\nGermans in the matter of criticism. Sure the clever boys and men have\nmost love towards the stupid ones.\n\n\"Finish him off, Bob,\" cried a big boy, and that I noticed especially,\nbecause I thought it unkind of him, after eating of my toffee as he\nhad that afternoon; \"finish him off, neck and crop; he deserves it for\nsticking up to a man like you.\"\n\nBut I was not so to be finished off, though feeling in my knuckles now\nas if it were a blueness and a sense of chilblain. Nothing held except\nmy legs, and they were good to help me. So this bout, or round, if you\nplease, was foughten warily by me, with gentle recollection of what my\ntutor, the clever boy, had told me, and some resolve to earn his praise\nbefore I came back to his knee again. And never, I think, in all my\nlife, sounded sweeter words in my ears (except when my love loved me)\nthan when my second and backer, who had made himself part of my doings\nnow, and would have wept to see me beaten, said,--\n\n\"Famously done, Jack, famously! Only keep your wind up, Jack, and you'll\ngo right through him!\"\n\nMeanwhile John Fry was prowling about, asking the boys what they thought\nof it, and whether I was like to be killed, because of my mother's\ntrouble. But finding now that I had foughten three-score fights already,\nhe came up to me woefully, in the quickness of my breathing, while I sat\non the knee of my second, with a piece of spongious coralline to ease\nme of my bloodshed, and he says in my ears, as if he was clapping spurs\ninto a horse,--\n\n\"Never thee knack under, Jan, or never coom naigh Hexmoor no more.\"\n\nWith that it was all up with me. A simmering buzzed in my heavy brain,\nand a light came through my eyeplaces. At once I set both fists again,\nand my heart stuck to me like cobbler's wax. Either Robin Snell should\nkill me, or I would conquer Robin Snell. So I went in again with my\ncourage up, and Bob came smiling for victory, and I hated him for\nsmiling. He let at me with his left hand, and I gave him my right\nbetween his eyes, and he blinked, and was not pleased with it. I feared\nhim not, and spared him not, neither spared myself. My breath came\nagain, and my heart stood cool, and my eyes struck fire no longer. Only\nI knew that I would die sooner than shame my birthplace. How the rest\nof it was I know not; only that I had the end of it, and helped to put\nRobin in bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE WAR-PATH OF THE DOONES\n\n[Illustration: 014.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nFrom Tiverton town to the town of Oare is a very long and painful road,\nand in good truth the traveller must make his way, as the saying is; for\nthe way is still unmade, at least, on this side of Dulverton, although\nthere is less danger now than in the time of my schooling; for now a\ngood horse may go there without much cost of leaping, but when I was\na boy the spurs would fail, when needed most, by reason of the\nslough-cake. It is to the credit of this age, and our advance upon\nfatherly ways, that now we have laid down rods and fagots, and even\nstump-oaks here and there, so that a man in good daylight need not sink,\nif he be quite sober. There is nothing I have striven at more than doing\nmy duty, way-warden over Exmoor.\n\nBut in those days, when I came from school (and good times they were,\ntoo, full of a warmth and fine hearth-comfort, which now are dying out),\nit was a sad and sorry business to find where lay the highway. We are\ntaking now to mark it off with a fence on either side, at least, when\na town is handy; but to me his seems of a high pretence, and a sort of\nlandmark, and channel for robbers, though well enough near London, where\nthey have earned a race-course.\n\nWe left the town of the two fords, which they say is the meaning of it,\nvery early in the morning, after lying one day to rest, as was demanded\nby the nags, sore of foot and foundered. For my part, too, I was glad to\nrest, having aches all over me, and very heavy bruises; and we lodged\nat the sign of the White Horse Inn, in the street called Gold Street,\nopposite where the souls are of John and Joan Greenway, set up in\ngold letters, because we must take the homeward way at cockcrow of the\nmorning. Though still John Fry was dry with me of the reason of his\ncoming, and only told lies about father, and could not keep them\nagreeable, I hoped for the best, as all boys will, especially after a\nvictory. And I thought, perhaps father had sent for me because he had a\ngood harvest, and the rats were bad in the corn-chamber.\n\nIt was high noon before we were got to Dulverton that day, near to which\ntown the river Exe and its big brother Barle have union. My mother had\nan uncle living there, but we were not to visit his house this time, at\nwhich I was somewhat astonished, since we needs must stop for at least\ntwo hours, to bait our horses thorough well, before coming to the black\nbogway. The bogs are very good in frost, except where the hot-springs\nrise; but as yet there had been no frost this year, save just enough\nto make the blackbirds look big in the morning. In a hearty black-frost\nthey look small, until the snow falls over them.\n\nThe road from Bampton to Dulverton had not been very delicate, yet\nnothing to complain of much--no deeper, indeed, than the hocks of a\nhorse, except in the rotten places. The day was inclined to be mild and\nfoggy, and both nags sweated freely; but Peggy carrying little weight\n(for my wardrobe was upon Smiler, and John Fry grumbling always), we\ncould easily keep in front, as far as you may hear a laugh.\n\nJohn had been rather bitter with me, which methought was a mark of ill\ntaste at coming home for the holidays; and yet I made allowance for\nJohn, because he had never been at school, and never would have chance\nto eat fry upon condition of spelling it; therefore I rode on, thinking\nthat he was hard-set, like a saw, for his dinner, and would soften after\ntooth-work. And yet at his most hungry times, when his mind was far gone\nupon bacon, certes he seemed to check himself and look at me as if he\nwere sorry for little things coming over great.\n\nBut now, at Dulverton, we dined upon the rarest and choicest victuals\nthat ever I did taste. Even now, at my time of life, to think of it\ngives me appetite, as once and awhile to think of my first love makes\nme love all goodness. Hot mutton pasty was a thing I had often heard\nof from very wealthy boys and men, who made a dessert of dinner; and to\nhear them talk of it made my lips smack, and my ribs come inwards.\n\nAnd now John Fry strode into the hostel, with the air and grace of a\nshort-legged man, and shouted as loud as if he was calling sheep upon\nExmoor,--\n\n\"Hot mooton pasty for twoo trarv'lers, at number vaive, in vaive\nminnits! Dish un up in the tin with the grahvy, zame as I hardered last\nTuesday.\"\n\nOf course it did not come in five minutes, nor yet in ten or twenty; but\nthat made it all the better when it came to the real presence; and the\nsmell of it was enough to make an empty man thank God for the room there\nwas inside him. Fifty years have passed me quicker than the taste of\nthat gravy.\n\nIt is the manner of all good boys to be careless of apparel, and take no\npride in adornment. Good lack, if I see a boy make to do about the fit\nof his crumpler, and the creasing of his breeches, and desire to be shod\nfor comeliness rather than for use, I cannot 'scape the mark that God\ntook thought to make a girl of him. Not so when they grow older, and\ncourt the regard of the maidens; then may the bravery pass from the\ninside to the outside of them; and no bigger fools are they, even then,\nthan their fathers were before them. But God forbid any man to be a fool\nto love, and be loved, as I have been. Else would he have prevented it.\n\nWhen the mutton pasty was done, and Peggy and Smiler had dined well\nalso, out I went to wash at the pump, being a lover of soap and water,\nat all risk, except of my dinner. And John Fry, who cared very little\nto wash, save Sabbath days in his own soap, and who had kept me from the\npump by threatening loss of the dish, out he came in a satisfied manner,\nwith a piece of quill in his hand, to lean against a door-post, and\nlisten to the horses feeding, and have his teeth ready for supper.\n\nThen a lady's-maid came out, and the sun was on her face, and she turned\nround to go back again; but put a better face upon it, and gave a\ntrip and hitched her dress, and looked at the sun full body, lest the\nhostlers should laugh that she was losing her complexion. With a long\nItalian glass in her fingers very daintily, she came up to the pump in\nthe middle of the yard, where I was running the water off all my head\nand shoulders, and arms, and some of my breast even, and though I had\nglimpsed her through the sprinkle, it gave me quite a turn to see\nher, child as I was, in my open aspect. But she looked at me, no whit\nabashed, making a baby of me, no doubt, as a woman of thirty will do,\neven with a very big boy when they catch him on a hayrick, and she said\nto me in a brazen manner, as if I had been nobody, while I was shrinking\nbehind the pump, and craving to get my shirt on, \"Good leetle boy, come\nhither to me. Fine heaven! how blue your eyes are, and your skin like\nsnow; but some naughty man has beaten it black. Oh, leetle boy, let me\nfeel it. Ah, how then it must have hurt you! There now, and you shall\nlove me.\"\n\nAll this time she was touching my breast, here and there, very lightly,\nwith her delicate brown fingers, and I understood from her voice and\nmanner that she was not of this country, but a foreigner by extraction.\nAnd then I was not so shy of her, because I could talk better English\nthan she; and yet I longed for my jerkin, but liked not to be rude to\nher.\n\n\"If you please, madam, I must go. John Fry is waiting by the tapster's\ndoor, and Peggy neighing to me. If you please, we must get home\nto-night; and father will be waiting for me this side of the\ntelling-house.\"\n\n\"There, there, you shall go, leetle dear, and perhaps I will go after\nyou. I have taken much love of you. But the baroness is hard to me. How\nfar you call it now to the bank of the sea at Wash--Wash--\"\n\n\"At Watchett, likely you mean, madam. Oh, a very long way, and the roads\nas soft as the road to Oare.\"\n\n\"Oh-ah, oh-ah--I shall remember; that is the place where my leetle boy\nlive, and some day I will come seek for him. Now make the pump to flow,\nmy dear, and give me the good water. The baroness will not touch unless\na nebule be formed outside the glass.\"\n\nI did not know what she meant by that; yet I pumped for her very\nheartily, and marvelled to see her for fifty times throw the water away\nin the trough, as if it was not good enough. At last the water suited\nher, with a likeness of fog outside the glass, and the gleam of a\ncrystal under it, and then she made a curtsey to me, in a sort of\nmocking manner, holding the long glass by the foot, not to take the\ncloud off; and then she wanted to kiss me; but I was out of breath, and\nhave always been shy of that work, except when I come to offer it; and\nso I ducked under the pump-handle, and she knocked her chin on the knob\nof it; and the hostlers came out, and asked whether they would do as\nwell.\n\nUpon this, she retreated up the yard, with a certain dark dignity, and\na foreign way of walking, which stopped them at once from going farther,\nbecause it was so different from the fashion of their sweethearts. One\nwith another they hung back, where half a cart-load of hay was, and\nthey looked to be sure that she would not turn round; and then each one\nlaughed at the rest of them.\n\nNow, up to the end of Dulverton town, on the northward side of it,\nwhere the two new pig-sties be, the Oare folk and the Watchett folk must\ntrudge on together, until we come to a broken cross, where a murdered\nman lies buried. Peggy and Smiler went up the hill, as if nothing could\nbe too much for them, after the beans they had eaten, and suddenly\nturning a corner of trees, we happened upon a great coach and six horses\nlabouring very heavily. John Fry rode on with his hat in his hand, as\nbecame him towards the quality; but I was amazed to that degree, that I\nleft my cap on my head, and drew bridle without knowing it.\n\n[Illustration: 019.jpg Great Coach and Six Horses Labouring]\n\nFor in the front seat of the coach, which was half-way open, being of\nthe city-make, and the day in want of air, sate the foreign lady, who\nhad met me at the pump and offered to salute me. By her side was a\nlittle girl, dark-haired and very wonderful, with a wealthy softness on\nher, as if she must have her own way. I could not look at her for two\nglances, and she did not look at me for one, being such a little child,\nand busy with the hedges. But in the honourable place sate a handsome\nlady, very warmly dressed, and sweetly delicate of colour. And close\nto her was a lively child, two or it may be three years old, bearing a\nwhite cockade in his hat, and staring at all and everybody. Now, he saw\nPeggy, and took such a liking to her, that the lady his mother--if so\nshe were--was forced to look at my pony and me. And, to tell the truth,\nalthough I am not of those who adore the high folk, she looked at us\nvery kindly, and with a sweetness rarely found in the women who milk the\ncows for us.\n\nThen I took off my cap to the beautiful lady, without asking wherefore;\nand she put up her hand and kissed it to me, thinking, perhaps, that\nI looked like a gentle and good little boy; for folk always called me\ninnocent, though God knows I never was that. But now the foreign lady,\nor lady's maid, as it might be, who had been busy with little dark eyes,\nturned upon all this going-on, and looked me straight in the face. I was\nabout to salute her, at a distance, indeed, and not with the nicety she\nhad offered to me, but, strange to say, she stared at my eyes as if she\nhad never seen me before, neither wished to see me again. At this I was\nso startled, such things beings out of my knowledge, that I startled\nPeggy also with the muscle of my legs, and she being fresh from stable,\nand the mire scraped off with cask-hoop, broke away so suddenly that I\ncould do no more than turn round and lower my cap, now five months old,\nto the beautiful lady. Soon I overtook John Fry, and asked him all about\nthem, and how it was that we had missed their starting from the hostel.\nBut John would never talk much till after a gallon of cider; and all\nthat I could win out of him was that they were \"murdering Papishers,\"\nand little he cared to do with them, or the devil, as they came\nfrom. And a good thing for me, and a providence, that I was gone down\nDulverton town to buy sweetstuff for Annie, else my stupid head would\nhave gone astray with their great out-coming.\n\nWe saw no more of them after that, but turned into the sideway; and soon\nhad the fill of our hands and eyes to look to our own going. For the\nroad got worse and worse, until there was none at all, and perhaps the\npurest thing it could do was to be ashamed to show itself. But we pushed\non as best we might, with doubt of reaching home any time, except by\nspecial grace of God.\n\nThe fog came down upon the moors as thick as ever I saw it; and there\nwas no sound of any sort, nor a breath of wind to guide us. The little\nstubby trees that stand here and there, like bushes with a wooden leg\nto them, were drizzled with a mess of wet, and hung their points with\ndropping. Wherever the butt-end of a hedgerow came up from the hollow\nground, like the withers of a horse, holes of splash were pocked and\npimpled in the yellow sand of coneys, or under the dwarf tree's ovens.\nBut soon it was too dark to see that, or anything else, I may say,\nexcept the creases in the dusk, where prisoned light crept up the\nvalleys.\n\nAfter awhile even that was gone, and no other comfort left us except to\nsee our horses' heads jogging to their footsteps, and the dark ground\npass below us, lighter where the wet was; and then the splash, foot\nafter foot, more clever than we can do it, and the orderly jerk of the\ntail, and the smell of what a horse is.\n\nJohn Fry was bowing forward with sleep upon his saddle, and now I could\nno longer see the frizzle of wet upon his beard--for he had a very brave\none, of a bright red colour, and trimmed into a whale-oil knot, because\nhe was newly married--although that comb of hair had been a subject of\nsome wonder to me, whether I, in God's good time, should have the like\nof that, handsomely set with shining beads, small above and large below,\nfrom the weeping of the heaven. But still I could see the jog of his\nhat--a Sunday hat with a top to it--and some of his shoulder bowed out\nin the mist, so that one could say \"Hold up, John,\" when Smiler put\nhis foot in. \"Mercy of God! where be us now?\" said John Fry, waking\nsuddenly; \"us ought to have passed hold hash, Jan. Zeen it on the road,\nhave 'ee?\"\n\n[Illustration: 021.jpg Where be us now?]\n\n\"No indeed, John; no old ash. Nor nothing else to my knowing; nor heard\nnothing, save thee snoring.\"\n\n\"Watt a vule thee must be then, Jan; and me myzell no better. Harken,\nlad, harken!\"\n\nWe drew our horses up and listened, through the thickness of the air,\nand with our hands laid to our ears. At first there was nothing to hear,\nexcept the panting of the horses and the trickle of the eaving drops\nfrom our head-covers and clothing, and the soft sounds of the lonely\nnight, that make us feel, and try not to think. Then there came a mellow\nnoise, very low and mournsome, not a sound to be afraid of, but to long\nto know the meaning, with a soft rise of the hair. Three times it came\nand went again, as the shaking of a thread might pass away into the\ndistance; and then I touched John Fry to know that there was something\nnear me.\n\n\"Doon't 'e be a vule, Jan! Vaine moozick as iver I 'eer. God bless the\nman as made un doo it.\"\n\n\"Have they hanged one of the Doones then, John?\"\n\n\"Hush, lad; niver talk laike o' thiccy. Hang a Doone! God knoweth, the\nKing would hang pretty quick if her did.\"\n\n\"Then who is it in the chains, John?\"\n\nI felt my spirit rise as I asked; for now I had crossed Exmoor so often\nas to hope that the people sometimes deserved it, and think that it\nmight be a lesson to the rogues who unjustly loved the mutton they were\nnever born to. But, of course, they were born to hanging, when they set\nthemselves so high.\n\n\"It be nawbody,\" said John, \"vor us to make a fush about. Belong to\nt'other zide o' the moor, and come staling shape to our zide. Red Jem\nHannaford his name. Thank God for him to be hanged, lad; and good cess\nto his soul for craikin' zo.\"\n\nSo the sound of the quiet swinging led us very modestly, as it came and\nwent on the wind, loud and low pretty regularly, even as far as the foot\nof the gibbet where the four cross-ways are.\n\n\"Vamous job this here,\" cried John, looking up to be sure of it, because\nthere were so many; \"here be my own nick on the post. Red Jem, too, and\nno doubt of him; he do hang so handsome like, and his ribs up laike a\nhorse a'most. God bless them as discoovered the way to make a rogue so\nuseful. Good-naight to thee, Jem, my lad; and not break thy drames with\nthe craikin'.\"\n\nJohn Fry shook his bridle-arm, and smote upon Smiler merrily, as he\njogged into the homeward track from the guiding of the body. But I was\nsorry for Red Jem, and wanted to know more about him, and whether\nhe might not have avoided this miserable end, and what his wife and\nchildren thought of it, if, indeed, he had any.\n\nBut John would talk no more about it; and perhaps he was moved with a\nlonesome feeling, as the creaking sound came after us.\n\n\"Hould thee tongue, lad,' he said sharply; 'us be naigh the Doone-track\nnow, two maile from Dunkery Beacon hill, the haighest place of Hexmoor.\nSo happen they be abroad to-naight, us must crawl on our belly-places,\nboy.\"\n\nI knew at once what he meant--those bloody Doones of Bagworthy, the awe\nof all Devon and Somerset, outlaws, traitors, murderers. My little legs\nbegan to tremble to and fro upon Peggy's sides, as I heard the dead\nrobber in chains behind us, and thought of the live ones still in front.\n\n\"But, John,\" I whispered warily, sidling close to his saddle-bow; \"dear\nJohn, you don't think they will see us in such a fog as this?\"\n\n\"Never God made vog as could stop their eyesen,\" he whispered in answer,\nfearfully; \"here us be by the hollow ground. Zober, lad, goo zober now,\nif thee wish to see thy moother.\"\n\nFor I was inclined, in the manner of boys, to make a run of the danger,\nand cross the Doone-track at full speed; to rush for it, and be done\nwith it. But even then I wondered why he talked of my mother so, and\nsaid not a word of father.\n\nWe were come to a long deep \"goyal,\" as they call it on Exmoor, a word\nwhose fountain and origin I have nothing to do with. Only I know that\nwhen little boys laughed at me at Tiverton, for talking about a \"goyal,\"\na big boy clouted them on the head, and said that it was in Homer, and\nmeant the hollow of the hand. And another time a Welshman told me that\nit must be something like the thing they call a \"pant\" in those parts.\nStill I know what it means well enough--to wit, a long trough among\nwild hills, falling towards the plain country, rounded at the bottom,\nperhaps, and stiff, more than steep, at the sides of it. Whether it be\nstraight or crooked, makes no difference to it.\n\nWe rode very carefully down our side, and through the soft grass at\nthe bottom, and all the while we listened as if the air was a\nspeaking-trumpet. Then gladly we breasted our nags to the rise, and were\ncoming to the comb of it, when I heard something, and caught John's\narm, and he bent his hand to the shape of his ear. It was the sound of\nhorses' feet knocking up through splashy ground, as if the bottom sucked\nthem. Then a grunting of weary men, and the lifting noise of stirrups,\nand sometimes the clank of iron mixed with the wheezy croning of leather\nand the blowing of hairy nostrils.\n\n\"God's sake, Jack, slip round her belly, and let her go where she wull.\"\n\nAs John Fry whispered, so I did, for he was off Smiler by this time;\nbut our two pads were too fagged to go far, and began to nose about and\ncrop, sniffing more than they need have done. I crept to John's side\nvery softly, with the bridle on my arm.\n\n\"Let goo braidle; let goo, lad. Plaise God they take them for\nforest-ponies, or they'll zend a bullet through us.\"\n\nI saw what he meant, and let go the bridle; for now the mist was rolling\noff, and we were against the sky-line to the dark cavalcade below us.\nJohn lay on the ground by a barrow of heather, where a little gullet\nwas, and I crept to him, afraid of the noise I made in dragging my legs\nalong, and the creak of my cord breeches. John bleated like a sheep to\ncover it--a sheep very cold and trembling.\n\nThen just as the foremost horseman passed, scarce twenty yards below us,\na puff of wind came up the glen, and the fog rolled off before it. And\nsuddenly a strong red light, cast by the cloud-weight downwards, spread\nlike fingers over the moorland, opened the alleys of darkness, and hung\non the steel of the riders.\n\n\"Dunkery Beacon,\" whispered John, so close into my ear, that I felt his\nlips and teeth ashake; \"dursn't fire it now except to show the Doones\nway home again, since the naight as they went up and throwed the\nwatchmen atop of it. Why, wutt be 'bout, lad? God's sake--\"\n\nFor I could keep still no longer, but wriggled away from his arm, and\nalong the little gullet, still going flat on my breast and thighs, until\nI was under a grey patch of stone, with a fringe of dry fern round it;\nthere I lay, scarce twenty feet above the heads of the riders, and I\nfeared to draw my breath, though prone to do it with wonder.\n\nFor now the beacon was rushing up, in a fiery storm to heaven, and the\nform of its flame came and went in the folds, and the heavy sky was\nhovering. All around it was hung with red, deep in twisted columns, and\nthen a giant beard of fire streamed throughout the darkness. The sullen\nhills were flanked with light, and the valleys chined with shadow, and\nall the sombrous moors between awoke in furrowed anger.\n\nBut most of all the flinging fire leaped into the rocky mouth of the\nglen below me, where the horsemen passed in silence, scarcely deigning\nto look round. Heavy men and large of stature, reckless how they bore\ntheir guns, or how they sate their horses, with leathern jerkins, and\nlong boots, and iron plates on breast and head, plunder heaped behind\ntheir saddles, and flagons slung in front of them; I counted more than\nthirty pass, like clouds upon red sunset. Some had carcasses of sheep\nswinging with their skins on, others had deer, and one had a child flung\nacross his saddle-bow. Whether the child were dead, or alive, was more\nthan I could tell, only it hung head downwards there, and must take the\nchance of it. They had got the child, a very young one, for the sake of\nthe dress, no doubt, which they could not stop to pull off from it; for\nthe dress shone bright, where the fire struck it, as if with gold and\njewels. I longed in my heart to know most sadly what they would do with\nthe little thing, and whether they would eat it.\n\nIt touched me so to see that child, a prey among those vultures, that in\nmy foolish rage and burning I stood up and shouted to them leaping on\na rock, and raving out of all possession. Two of them turned round, and\none set his carbine at me, but the other said it was but a pixie, and\nbade him keep his powder. Little they knew, and less thought I, that the\npixie then before them would dance their castle down one day.\n\n[Illustration: 026.jpg Said it was but a Pixie]\n\nJohn Fry, who in the spring of fright had brought himself down from\nSmiler's side, as if he were dipped in oil, now came up to me, all risk\nbeing over, cross, and stiff, and aching sorely from his wet couch of\nheather.\n\n\"Small thanks to thee, Jan, as my new waife bain't a widder. And who be\nyou to zupport of her, and her son, if she have one? Zarve thee right if\nI was to chuck thee down into the Doone-track. Zim thee'll come to un,\nzooner or later, if this be the zample of thee.\"\n\nAnd that was all he had to say, instead of thanking God! For if ever\nborn man was in a fright, and ready to thank God for anything, the name\nof that man was John Fry not more than five minutes agone.\n\nHowever, I answered nothing at all, except to be ashamed of myself; and\nsoon we found Peggy and Smiler in company, well embarked on the homeward\nroad, and victualling where the grass was good. Right glad they were\nto see us again--not for the pleasure of carrying, but because a horse\n(like a woman) lacks, and is better without, self-reliance.\n\nMy father never came to meet us, at either side of the telling-house,\nneither at the crooked post, nor even at home-linhay although the dogs\nkept such a noise that he must have heard us. Home-side of the\nlinhay, and under the ashen hedge-row, where father taught me to catch\nblackbirds, all at once my heart went down, and all my breast was\nhollow. There was not even the lanthorn light on the peg against the\ncow's house, and nobody said \"Hold your noise!\" to the dogs, or shouted\n\"Here our Jack is!\"\n\nI looked at the posts of the gate, in the dark, because they were tall,\nlike father, and then at the door of the harness-room, where he used to\nsmoke his pipe and sing. Then I thought he had guests perhaps--people\nlost upon the moors--whom he could not leave unkindly, even for his\nson's sake. And yet about that I was jealous, and ready to be vexed with\nhim, when he should begin to make much of me. And I felt in my pocket\nfor the new pipe which I had brought him from Tiverton, and said to\nmyself, \"He shall not have it until to-morrow morning.\"\n\nWoe is me! I cannot tell. How I knew I know not now--only that I slunk\naway, without a tear, or thought of weeping, and hid me in a saw-pit.\nThere the timber, over-head, came like streaks across me; and all I\nwanted was to lack, and none to tell me anything.\n\nBy-and-by, a noise came down, as of woman's weeping; and there my mother\nand sister were, choking and holding together. Although they were my\ndearest loves, I could not bear to look at them, until they seemed to\nwant my help, and put their hands before their eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA VERY RASH VISIT\n\n[Illustration: 028.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nMy dear father had been killed by the Doones of Bagworthy, while riding\nhome from Porlock market, on the Saturday evening. With him were six\nbrother-farmers, all of them very sober; for father would have no\ncompany with any man who went beyond half a gallon of beer, or a single\ngallon of cider. The robbers had no grudge against him; for he had never\nflouted them, neither made overmuch of outcry, because they robbed other\npeople. For he was a man of such strict honesty, and due parish feeling,\nthat he knew it to be every man's own business to defend himself and\nhis goods; unless he belonged to our parish, and then we must look after\nhim.\n\nThese seven good farmers were jogging along, helping one another in the\ntroubles of the road, and singing goodly hymns and songs to keep their\ncourage moving, when suddenly a horseman stopped in the starlight full\nacross them.\n\nBy dress and arms they knew him well, and by his size and stature, shown\nagainst the glimmer of the evening star; and though he seemed one man to\nseven, it was in truth one man to one. Of the six who had been\nsinging songs and psalms about the power of God, and their own\nregeneration--such psalms as went the round, in those days, of the\npublic-houses--there was not one but pulled out his money, and sang\nsmall beer to a Doone.\n\nBut father had been used to think that any man who was comfortable\ninside his own coat and waistcoat deserved to have no other set, unless\nhe would strike a blow for them. And so, while his gossips doffed their\nhats, and shook with what was left of them, he set his staff above his\nhead, and rode at the Doone robber. With a trick of his horse, the wild\nman escaped the sudden onset, although it must have amazed him sadly\nthat any durst resist him. Then when Smiler was carried away with the\ndash and the weight of my father (not being brought up to battle, nor\nused to turn, save in plough harness), the outlaw whistled upon his\nthumb, and plundered the rest of the yeoman. But father, drawing at\nSmiler's head, to try to come back and help them, was in the midst of\na dozen men, who seemed to come out of a turf-rick, some on horse, and\nsome a-foot. Nevertheless, he smote lustily, so far as he could see;\nand being of great size and strength, and his blood well up, they had no\neasy job with him. With the play of his wrist, he cracked three or four\ncrowns, being always famous at single-stick; until the rest drew their\nhorses away, and he thought that he was master, and would tell his wife\nabout it.\n\n[Illustration: 029.jpg He rode at the Doone robber]\n\nBut a man beyond the range of staff was crouching by the peat-stack,\nwith a long gun set to his shoulder, and he got poor father against the\nsky, and I cannot tell the rest of it. Only they knew that Smiler came\nhome, with blood upon his withers, and father was found in the morning\ndead on the moor, with his ivy-twisted cudgel lying broken under him.\nNow, whether this were an honest fight, God judge betwixt the Doones and\nme.\n\n[Illustration: 030.jpg Father was found dead on the moor]\n\nIt was more of woe than wonder, being such days of violence, that mother\nknew herself a widow, and her children fatherless. Of children there\nwere only three, none of us fit to be useful yet, only to comfort\nmother, by making her to work for us. I, John Ridd, was the eldest,\nand felt it a heavy thing on me; next came sister Annie, with about two\nyears between us; and then the little Eliza.\n\nNow, before I got home and found my sad loss--and no boy ever loved his\nfather more than I loved mine--mother had done a most wondrous thing,\nwhich made all the neighbours say that she must be mad, at least. Upon\nthe Monday morning, while her husband lay unburied, she cast a white\nhood over her hair, and gathered a black cloak round her, and, taking\ncounsel of no one, set off on foot for the Doone-gate.\n\nIn the early afternoon she came to the hollow and barren entrance, where\nin truth there was no gate, only darkness to go through. If I get on\nwith this story, I shall have to tell of it by-and-by, as I saw it\nafterwards; and will not dwell there now. Enough that no gun was fired\nat her, only her eyes were covered over, and somebody led her by the\nhand, without any wish to hurt her.\n\nA very rough and headstrong road was all that she remembered, for she\ncould not think as she wished to do, with the cold iron pushed against\nher. At the end of this road they delivered her eyes, and she could\nscarce believe them.\n\nFor she stood at the head of a deep green valley, carved from out the\nmountains in a perfect oval, with a fence of sheer rock standing round\nit, eighty feet or a hundred high; from whose brink black wooded hills\nswept up to the sky-line. By her side a little river glided out from\nunderground with a soft dark babble, unawares of daylight; then growing\nbrighter, lapsed away, and fell into the valley. Then, as it ran down\nthe meadow, alders stood on either marge, and grass was blading out\nupon it, and yellow tufts of rushes gathered, looking at the hurry. But\nfurther down, on either bank, were covered houses built of stone, square\nand roughly cornered, set as if the brook were meant to be the street\nbetween them. Only one room high they were, and not placed opposite each\nother, but in and out as skittles are; only that the first of all, which\nproved to be the captain's, was a sort of double house, or rather two\nhouses joined together by a plank-bridge, over the river.\n\nFourteen cots my mother counted, all very much of a pattern, and nothing\nto choose between them, unless it were the captain's. Deep in the quiet\nvalley there, away from noise, and violence, and brawl, save that of\nthe rivulet, any man would have deemed them homes of simple mind and\ninnocence. Yet not a single house stood there but was the home of\nmurder.\n\nTwo men led my mother down a steep and gliddery stair-way, like the\nladder of a hay-mow; and thence from the break of the falling water as\nfar as the house of the captain. And there at the door they left her\ntrembling, strung as she was, to speak her mind.\n\nNow, after all, what right had she, a common farmer's widow, to take it\namiss that men of birth thought fit to kill her husband. And the Doones\nwere of very high birth, as all we clods of Exmoor knew; and we had\nenough of good teaching now--let any man say the contrary--to feel that\nall we had belonged of right to those above us. Therefore my mother was\nhalf-ashamed that she could not help complaining.\n\nBut after a little while, as she said, remembrance of her husband came,\nand the way he used to stand by her side and put his strong arm round\nher, and how he liked his bacon fried, and praised her kindly for\nit--and so the tears were in her eyes, and nothing should gainsay them.\n\nA tall old man, Sir Ensor Doone, came out with a bill-hook in his\nhand, hedger's gloves going up his arms, as if he were no better than a\nlabourer at ditch-work. Only in his mouth and eyes, his gait, and most\nof all his voice, even a child could know and feel that here was no\nditch-labourer. Good cause he has found since then, perhaps, to wish\nthat he had been one.\n\nWith his white locks moving upon his coat, he stopped and looked down\nat my mother, and she could not help herself but curtsey under the fixed\nblack gazing.\n\n\"Good woman, you are none of us. Who has brought you hither? Young men\nmust be young--but I have had too much of this work.\"\n\nAnd he scowled at my mother, for her comeliness; and yet looked under\nhis eyelids as if he liked her for it. But as for her, in her depth of\nlove-grief, it struck scorn upon her womanhood; and in the flash she\nspoke.\n\n\"What you mean I know not. Traitors! cut-throats! cowards! I am here to\nask for my husband.\" She could not say any more, because her heart\nwas now too much for her, coming hard in her throat and mouth; but she\nopened up her eyes at him.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Sir Ensor Doone--being born a gentleman, although a very\nbad one--\"I crave pardon of you. My eyes are old, or I might have known.\nNow, if we have your husband prisoner, he shall go free without ransoms,\nbecause I have insulted you.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said my mother, being suddenly taken away with sorrow, because of\nhis gracious manner, \"please to let me cry a bit.\"\n\nHe stood away, and seemed to know that women want no help for that. And\nby the way she cried he knew that they had killed her husband. Then,\nhaving felt of grief himself, he was not angry with her, but left her to\nbegin again.\n\n\"Loth would I be,\" said mother, sobbing with her new red handkerchief,\nand looking at the pattern of it, \"loth indeed, Sir Ensor Doone, to\naccuse any one unfairly. But I have lost the very best husband God ever\ngave to a woman; and I knew him when he was to your belt, and I not up\nto your knee, sir; and never an unkind word he spoke, nor stopped\nme short in speaking. All the herbs he left to me, and all the\nbacon-curing, and when it was best to kill a pig, and how to treat the\nmaidens. Not that I would ever wish--oh, John, it seems so strange to\nme, and last week you were everything.\"\n\nHere mother burst out crying again, not loudly, but turning quietly,\nbecause she knew that no one now would ever care to wipe the tears. And\nfifty or a hundred things, of weekly and daily happening, came across my\nmother, so that her spirit fell like slackening lime.\n\n\"This matter must be seen to; it shall be seen to at once,\" the old man\nanswered, moved a little in spite of all his knowledge. \"Madam, if any\nwrong has been done, trust the honour of a Doone; I will redress it to\nmy utmost. Come inside and rest yourself, while I ask about it. What was\nyour good husband's name, and when and where fell this mishap?\"\n\n\"Deary me,\" said mother, as he set a chair for her very polite, but she\nwould not sit upon it; \"Saturday morning I was a wife, sir; and Saturday\nnight I was a widow, and my children fatherless. My husband's name was\nJohn Ridd, sir, as everybody knows; and there was not a finer or better\nman in Somerset or Devon. He was coming home from Porlock market, and a\nnew gown for me on the crupper, and a shell to put my hair up--oh, John,\nhow good you were to me!\"\n\nOf that she began to think again, and not to believe her sorrow, except\nas a dream from the evil one, because it was too bad upon her, and\nperhaps she would awake in a minute, and her husband would have the\nlaugh of her. And so she wiped her eyes and smiled, and looked for\nsomething.\n\n\"Madam, this is a serious thing,\" Sir Ensor Doone said graciously, and\nshowing grave concern: \"my boys are a little wild, I know. And yet I\ncannot think that they would willingly harm any one. And yet--and yet,\nyou do look wronged. Send Counsellor to me,\" he shouted, from the door\nof his house; and down the valley went the call, \"Send Counsellor to\nCaptain.\"\n\nCounsellor Doone came in ere yet my mother was herself again; and if any\nsight could astonish her when all her sense of right and wrong was gone\nastray with the force of things, it was the sight of the Counsellor.\nA square-built man of enormous strength, but a foot below the Doone\nstature (which I shall describe hereafter), he carried a long grey beard\ndescending to the leather of his belt. Great eyebrows overhung his face,\nlike ivy on a pollard oak, and under them two large brown eyes, as of an\nowl when muting. And he had a power of hiding his eyes, or showing them\nbright, like a blazing fire. He stood there with his beaver off, and\nmother tried to look at him, but he seemed not to descry her.\n\n\"Counsellor,\" said Sir Ensor Doone, standing back in his height from\nhim, \"here is a lady of good repute--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir; only a woman.\"\n\n[Illustration: 034.jpg Here is a lady, Counsellor]\n\n\"Allow me, madam, by your good leave. Here is a lady, Counsellor, of\ngreat repute in this part of the country, who charges the Doones with\nhaving unjustly slain her husband--\"\n\n\"Murdered him! murdered him!\" cried my mother, \"if ever there was a\nmurder. Oh, sir! oh, sir! you know it.\"\n\n\"The perfect rights and truth of the case is all I wish to know,\" said\nthe old man, very loftily: \"and justice shall be done, madam.\"\n\n\"Oh, I pray you--pray you, sirs, make no matter of business of it. God\nfrom Heaven, look on me!\"\n\n\"Put the case,\" said the Counsellor.\n\n\"The case is this,\" replied Sir Ensor, holding one hand up to mother:\n\"This lady's worthy husband was slain, it seems, upon his return from\nthe market at Porlock, no longer ago than last Saturday night. Madam,\namend me if I am wrong.\"\n\n\"No longer, indeed, indeed, sir. Sometimes it seems a twelvemonth, and\nsometimes it seems an hour.\"\n\n\"Cite his name,\" said the Counsellor, with his eyes still rolling\ninwards.\n\n\"Master John Ridd, as I understand. Counsellor, we have heard of him\noften; a worthy man and a peaceful one, who meddled not with our duties.\nNow, if any of our boys have been rough, they shall answer it dearly.\nAnd yet I can scarce believe it. For the folk about these parts are\napt to misconceive of our sufferings, and to have no feeling for us.\nCounsellor, you are our record, and very stern against us; tell us how\nthis matter was.\"\n\n\"Oh, Counsellor!\" my mother cried; \"Sir Counsellor, you will be fair: I\nsee it in your countenance. Only tell me who it was, and set me face to\nface with him, and I will bless you, sir, and God shall bless you, and\nmy children.\"\n\nThe square man with the long grey beard, quite unmoved by anything, drew\nback to the door and spoke, and his voice was like a fall of stones in\nthe bottom of a mine.\n\n\"Few words will be enow for this. Four or five of our best-behaved and\nmost peaceful gentlemen went to the little market at Porlock with a lump\nof money. They bought some household stores and comforts at a very high\nprice, and pricked upon the homeward road, away from vulgar revellers.\nWhen they drew bridle to rest their horses, in the shelter of a\npeat-rick, the night being dark and sudden, a robber of great size and\nstrength rode into the midst of them, thinking to kill or terrify. His\narrogance and hardihood at the first amazed them, but they would not\ngive up without a blow goods which were on trust with them. He had\nsmitten three of them senseless, for the power of his arm was terrible;\nwhereupon the last man tried to ward his blow with a pistol. Carver,\nsir, it was, our brave and noble Carver, who saved the lives of\nhis brethren and his own; and glad enow they were to escape.\nNotwithstanding, we hoped it might be only a flesh-wound, and not to\nspeed him in his sins.\"\n\nAs this atrocious tale of lies turned up joint by joint before her, like\na \"devil's coach-horse,\"* mother was too much amazed to do any more than\nlook at him, as if the earth must open. But the only thing that opened\nwas the great brown eyes of the Counsellor, which rested on my mother's\nface with a dew of sorrow, as he spoke of sins.\n\n* The cock-tailed beetle has earned this name in the West of England.\n\n\nShe, unable to bear them, turned suddenly on Sir Ensor, and caught (as\nshe fancied) a smile on his lips, and a sense of quiet enjoyment.\n\n\"All the Doones are gentlemen,\" answered the old man gravely, and\nlooking as if he had never smiled since he was a baby. \"We are always\nglad to explain, madam, any mistake which the rustic people may fall\nupon about us; and we wish you clearly to conceive that we do not charge\nyour poor husband with any set purpose of robbery, neither will we bring\nsuit for any attainder of his property. Is it not so, Counsellor?\"\n\n\"Without doubt his land is attainted; unless is mercy you forbear, sir.\"\n\n\"Counsellor, we will forbear. Madam, we will forgive him. Like enough he\nknew not right from wrong, at that time of night. The waters are strong\nat Porlock, and even an honest man may use his staff unjustly in this\nunchartered age of violence and rapine.\"\n\nThe Doones to talk of rapine! Mother's head went round so that she\ncurtseyed to them both, scarcely knowing where she was, but calling to\nmind her manners. All the time she felt a warmth, as if the right was\nwith her, and yet she could not see the way to spread it out before\nthem. With that, she dried her tears in haste and went into the cold\nair, for fear of speaking mischief.\n\nBut when she was on the homeward road, and the sentinels had charge of\nher, blinding her eyes, as if she were not blind enough with weeping,\nsome one came in haste behind her, and thrust a heavy leathern bag into\nthe limp weight of her hand.\n\n\"Captain sends you this,\" he whispered; \"take it to the little ones.\"\n\nBut mother let it fall in a heap, as if it had been a blind worm; and\nthen for the first time crouched before God, that even the Doones should\npity her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAN ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT\n\n[Illustration: 037.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nGood folk who dwell in a lawful land, if any such there be, may for want\nof exploration, judge our neighbourhood harshly, unless the whole truth\nis set before them. In bar of such prejudice, many of us ask leave to\nexplain how and why it was the robbers came to that head in the midst\nof us. We would rather not have had it so, God knows as well as anybody;\nbut it grew upon us gently, in the following manner. Only let all who\nread observe that here I enter many things which came to my knowledge in\nlater years.\n\nIn or about the year of our Lord 1640, when all the troubles of England\nwere swelling to an outburst, great estates in the North country were\nsuddenly confiscated, through some feud of families and strong influence\nat Court, and the owners were turned upon the world, and might think\nthemselves lucky to save their necks. These estates were in co-heirship,\njoint tenancy I think they called it, although I know not the meaning,\nonly so that if either tenant died, the other living, all would come to\nthe live one in spite of any testament.\n\nOne of the joint owners was Sir Ensor Doone, a gentleman of brisk\nintellect; and the other owner was his cousin, the Earl of Lorne and\nDykemont.\n\nLord Lorne was some years the elder of his cousin, Ensor Doone, and was\nmaking suit to gain severance of the cumbersome joint tenancy by any\nfair apportionment, when suddenly this blow fell on them by wiles and\nwoman's meddling; and instead of dividing the land, they were divided\nfrom it.\n\nThe nobleman was still well-to-do, though crippled in his expenditure;\nbut as for the cousin, he was left a beggar, with many to beg from him.\nHe thought that the other had wronged him, and that all the trouble of\nlaw befell through his unjust petition. Many friends advised him to make\ninterest at Court; for having done no harm whatever, and being a good\nCatholic, which Lord Lorne was not, he would be sure to find hearing\nthere, and probably some favour. But he, like a very hot-brained man,\nalthough he had long been married to the daughter of his cousin (whom he\nliked none the more for that), would have nothing to say to any attempt\nat making a patch of it, but drove away with his wife and sons, and the\nrelics of his money, swearing hard at everybody. In this he may have\nbeen quite wrong; probably, perhaps, he was so; but I am not convinced\nat all but what most of us would have done the same.\n\nSome say that, in the bitterness of that wrong and outrage, he slew a\ngentleman of the Court, whom he supposed to have borne a hand in the\nplundering of his fortunes. Others say that he bearded King Charles the\nFirst himself, in a manner beyond forgiveness. One thing, at any rate,\nis sure--Sir Ensor was attainted, and made a felon outlaw, through some\nviolent deed ensuing upon his dispossession.\n\nHe had searched in many quarters for somebody to help him, and with\ngood warrant for hoping it, inasmuch as he, in lucky days, had been\nopen-handed and cousinly to all who begged advice of him. But now\nall these provided him with plenty of good advice indeed, and great\nassurance of feeling, but not a movement of leg, or lip, or purse-string\nin his favour. All good people of either persuasion, royalty or\ncommonalty, knowing his kitchen-range to be cold, no longer would play\nturnspit. And this, it may be, seared his heart more than loss of land\nand fame.\n\nIn great despair at last, he resolved to settle in some outlandish part,\nwhere none could be found to know him; and so, in an evil day for us,\nhe came to the West of England. Not that our part of the world is at all\noutlandish, according to my view of it (for I never found a better one),\nbut that it was known to be rugged, and large, and desolate. And here,\nwhen he had discovered a place which seemed almost to be made for\nhim, so withdrawn, so self-defended, and uneasy of access, some of the\ncountry-folk around brought him little offerings--a side of bacon, a\nkeg of cider, hung mutton, or a brisket of venison; so that for a little\nwhile he was very honest. But when the newness of his coming began to\nwear away, and our good folk were apt to think that even a gentleman\nought to work or pay other men for doing it, and many farmers were grown\nweary of manners without discourse to them, and all cried out to one\nanother how unfair it was that owning such a fertile valley young men\nwould not spade or plough by reason of noble lineage--then the young\nDoones growing up took things they would not ask for.\n\nAnd here let me, as a solid man, owner of five hundred acres (whether\nfenced or otherwise, and that is my own business), churchwarden also of\nthis parish (until I go to the churchyard), and proud to be called the\nparson's friend--for a better man I never knew with tobacco and strong\nwaters, nor one who could read the lessons so well and he has been at\nBlundell's too--once for all let me declare, that I am a thorough-going\nChurch-and-State man, and Royalist, without any mistake about it. And\nthis I lay down, because some people judging a sausage by the skin,\nmay take in evil part my little glosses of style and glibness, and the\nmottled nature of my remarks and cracks now and then on the frying-pan.\nI assure them I am good inside, and not a bit of rue in me; only queer\nknots, as of marjoram, and a stupid manner of bursting.\n\nThere was not more than a dozen of them, counting a few retainers who\nstill held by Sir Ensor; but soon they grew and multiplied in a manner\nsurprising to think of. Whether it was the venison, which we call a\nstrengthening victual, or whether it was the Exmoor mutton, or the keen\nsoft air of the moorlands, anyhow the Doones increased much faster than\ntheir honesty. At first they had brought some ladies with them, of good\nrepute with charity; and then, as time went on, they added to their\nstock by carrying. They carried off many good farmers' daughters, who\nwere sadly displeased at first; but took to them kindly after awhile,\nand made a new home in their babies. For women, as it seems to me, like\nstrong men more than weak ones, feeling that they need some staunchness,\nsomething to hold fast by.\n\nAnd of all the men in our country, although we are of a thick-set breed,\nyou scarce could find one in three-score fit to be placed among the\nDoones, without looking no more than a tailor. Like enough, we could\nmeet them man for man (if we chose all around the crown and the skirts\nof Exmoor), and show them what a cross-buttock means, because we are\nso stuggy; but in regard of stature, comeliness, and bearing, no woman\nwould look twice at us. Not but what I myself, John Ridd, and one or two\nI know of--but it becomes me best not to talk of that, although my hair\nis gray.\n\nPerhaps their den might well have been stormed, and themselves driven\nout of the forest, if honest people had only agreed to begin with them\nat once when first they took to plundering. But having respect for\ntheir good birth, and pity for their misfortunes, and perhaps a little\nadmiration at the justice of God, that robbed men now were robbers,\nthe squires, and farmers, and shepherds, at first did nothing more than\ngrumble gently, or even make a laugh of it, each in the case of others.\nAfter awhile they found the matter gone too far for laughter, as\nviolence and deadly outrage stained the hand of robbery, until every\nwoman clutched her child, and every man turned pale at the very name of\nDoone. For the sons and grandsons of Sir Ensor grew up in foul liberty,\nand haughtiness, and hatred, to utter scorn of God and man, and\nbrutality towards dumb animals. There was only one good thing about\nthem, if indeed it were good, to wit, their faith to one another, and\ntruth to their wild eyry. But this only made them feared the more, so\ncertain was the revenge they wreaked upon any who dared to strike a\nDoone. One night, some ten years ere I was born, when they were sacking\na rich man's house not very far from Minehead, a shot was fired at them\nin the dark, of which they took little notice, and only one of them knew\nthat any harm was done. But when they were well on the homeward road,\nnot having slain either man or woman, or even burned a house down, one\nof their number fell from his saddle, and died without so much as a\ngroan. The youth had been struck, but would not complain, and perhaps\ntook little heed of the wound, while he was bleeding inwardly. His\nbrothers and cousins laid him softly on a bank of whortle-berries, and\njust rode back to the lonely hamlet where he had taken his death-wound.\nNo man nor woman was left in the morning, nor house for any to dwell in,\nonly a child with its reason gone.*\n\n     *This vile deed was done, beyond all doubt.\n\nThis affair made prudent people find more reason to let them alone than\nto meddle with them; and now they had so entrenched themselves, and\nwaxed so strong in number, that nothing less than a troop of soldiers\ncould wisely enter their premises; and even so it might turn out ill, as\nperchance we shall see by-and-by.\n\nFor not to mention the strength of the place, which I shall describe in\nits proper order when I come to visit it, there was not one among them\nbut was a mighty man, straight and tall, and wide, and fit to lift four\nhundredweight. If son or grandson of old Doone, or one of the northern\nretainers, failed at the age of twenty, while standing on his naked feet\nto touch with his forehead the lintel of Sir Ensor's door, and to fill\nthe door frame with his shoulders from sidepost even to sidepost, he was\nled away to the narrow pass which made their valley so desperate, and\nthrust from the crown with ignominy, to get his own living honestly.\nNow, the measure of that doorway is, or rather was, I ought to say,\nsix feet and one inch lengthwise, and two feet all but two inches taken\ncrossways in the clear. Yet I not only have heard but know, being so\nclosely mixed with them, that no descendant of old Sir Ensor, neither\nrelative of his (except, indeed, the Counsellor, who was kept by them\nfor his wisdom), and no more than two of their following ever failed of\nthat test, and relapsed to the difficult ways of honesty.\n\nNot that I think anything great of a standard the like of that: for\nif they had set me in that door-frame at the age of twenty, it is like\nenough that I should have walked away with it on my shoulders, though\nI was not come to my full strength then: only I am speaking now of the\naverage size of our neighbourhood, and the Doones were far beyond that.\nMoreover, they were taught to shoot with a heavy carbine so delicately\nand wisely, that even a boy could pass a ball through a rabbit's head at\nthe distance of fourscore yards. Some people may think nought of this,\nbeing in practice with longer shots from the tongue than from the\nshoulder; nevertheless, to do as above is, to my ignorance, very good\nwork, if you can be sure to do it. Not one word do I believe of Robin\nHood splitting peeled wands at seven-score yards, and such like. Whoever\nwrote such stories knew not how slippery a peeled wand is, even if one\ncould hit it, and how it gives to the onset. Now, let him stick one in\nthe ground, and take his bow and arrow at it, ten yards away, or even\nfive.\n\nNow, after all this which I have written, and all the rest which a\nreader will see, being quicker of mind than I am (who leave more than\nhalf behind me, like a man sowing wheat, with his dinner laid in the\nditch too near his dog), it is much but what you will understand the\nDoones far better than I did, or do even to this moment; and therefore\nnone will doubt when I tell them that our good justiciaries feared to\nmake an ado, or hold any public inquiry about my dear father's death.\nThey would all have had to ride home that night, and who could say what\nmight betide them. Least said soonest mended, because less chance of\nbreaking.\n\nSo we buried him quietly--all except my mother, indeed, for she could\nnot keep silence--in the sloping little churchyard of Oare, as meek a\nplace as need be, with the Lynn brook down below it. There is not much\nof company there for anybody's tombstone, because the parish spreads\nso far in woods and moors without dwelling-house. If we bury one man\nin three years, or even a woman or child, we talk about it for three\nmonths, and say it must be our turn next, and scarcely grow accustomed\nto it until another goes.\n\nAnnie was not allowed to come, because she cried so terribly; but she\nran to the window, and saw it all, mooing there like a little calf, so\nfrightened and so left alone. As for Eliza, she came with me, one on\neach side of mother, and not a tear was in her eyes, but sudden starts\nof wonder, and a new thing to be looked at unwillingly, yet\ncuriously. Poor little thing! she was very clever, the only one of our\nfamily--thank God for the same--but none the more for that guessed she\nwhat it is to lose a father.\n\n[Illustration: 042.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nNECESSARY PRACTICE\n\n[Illustration: 043.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAbout the rest of all that winter I remember very little, being only a\nyoung boy then, and missing my father most out of doors, as when it\ncame to the bird-catching, or the tracking of hares in the snow, or\nthe training of a sheep-dog. Oftentimes I looked at his gun, an ancient\npiece found in the sea, a little below Glenthorne, and of which he was\nmighty proud, although it was only a match-lock; and I thought of the\ntimes I had held the fuse, while he got his aim at a rabbit, and once\neven at a red deer rubbing among the hazels. But nothing came of my\nlooking at it, so far as I remember, save foolish tears of my own\nperhaps, till John Fry took it down one day from the hooks where\nfather's hand had laid it; and it hurt me to see how John handled it, as\nif he had no memory.\n\n\"Bad job for he as her had not got thiccy the naight as her coom acrass\nthem Doones. Rackon Varmer Jan 'ood a-zhown them the wai to kingdom\ncome, 'stead of gooin' herzel zo aisy. And a maight have been gooin' to\nmarket now, 'stead of laying banked up over yanner. Maister Jan, thee\ncan zee the grave if thee look alang this here goon-barryel. Buy now,\nwhutt be blubberin' at? Wish I had never told thee.\"\n\n\"John Fry, I am not blubbering; you make a great mistake, John. You are\nthinking of little Annie. I cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and\nfather gives me lickerish--I mean--I mean--he used to. Now let me have\nthe gun, John.\"\n\n\"Thee have the goon, Jan! Thee isn't fit to putt un to thy zhoulder.\nWhat a weight her be, for sure!\"\n\n\"Me not hold it, John! That shows how much you know about it. Get out\nof the way, John; you are opposite the mouth of it, and likely it is\nloaded.\"\n\nJohn Fry jumped in a livelier manner than when he was doing day-work;\nand I rested the mouth on a cross rack-piece, and felt a warm sort\nof surety that I could hit the door over opposite, or, at least, the\ncobwall alongside of it, and do no harm in the orchard. But John would\nnot give me link or fuse, and, on the whole, I was glad of it, though\ncarrying on as boys do, because I had heard my father say that the\nSpanish gun kicked like a horse, and because the load in it came from\nhis hand, and I did not like to undo it. But I never found it kick very\nhard, and firmly set to the shoulder, unless it was badly loaded. In\ntruth, the thickness of the metal was enough almost to astonish one; and\nwhat our people said about it may have been true enough, although most\nof them are such liars--at least, I mean, they make mistakes, as all\nmankind must do. Perchance it was no mistake at all to say that this\nancient gun had belonged to a noble Spaniard, the captain of a fine\nlarge ship in the \"Invincible Armada,\" which we of England managed to\nconquer, with God and the weather helping us, a hundred years ago or\nmore--I can't say to a month or so.\n\nAfter a little while, when John had fired away at a rat the charge I\nheld so sacred, it came to me as a natural thing to practise shooting\nwith that great gun, instead of John Fry's blunderbuss, which looked\nlike a bell with a stalk to it. Perhaps for a boy there is nothing\nbetter than a good windmill to shoot at, as I have seen them in flat\ncountries; but we have no windmills upon the great moorland, yet here\nand there a few barn-doors, where shelter is, and a way up the hollows.\nAnd up those hollows you can shoot, with the help of the sides to lead\nyour aim, and there is a fair chance of hitting the door, if you lay\nyour cheek to the barrel, and try not to be afraid of it.\n\n[Illustration: 045.jpg Won skill in target practice]\n\nGradually I won such skill, that I sent nearly all the lead gutter from\nthe north porch of our little church through our best barn-door, a thing\nwhich has often repented me since, especially as churchwarden, and made\nme pardon many bad boys; but father was not buried on that side of the\nchurch.\n\nBut all this time, while I was roving over the hills or about the farm,\nand even listening to John Fry, my mother, being so much older and\nfeeling trouble longer, went about inside the house, or among the maids\nand fowls, not caring to talk to the best of them, except when she broke\nout sometimes about the good master they had lost, all and every one\nof us. But the fowls would take no notice of it, except to cluck for\nbarley; and the maidens, though they had liked him well, were thinking\nof their sweethearts as the spring came on. Mother thought it wrong of\nthem, selfish and ungrateful; and yet sometimes she was proud that none\nhad such call as herself to grieve for him. Only Annie seemed to go\nsoftly in and out, and cry, with nobody along of her, chiefly in the\ncorner where the bees are and the grindstone. But somehow she would\nnever let anybody behold her; being set, as you may say, to think it\nover by herself, and season it with weeping. Many times I caught her,\nand many times she turned upon me, and then I could not look at her, but\nasked how long to dinner-time.\n\nNow in the depth of the winter month, such as we call December, father\nbeing dead and quiet in his grave a fortnight, it happened me to be out\nof powder for practice against his enemies. I had never fired a shot\nwithout thinking, \"This for father's murderer\"; and John Fry said that\nI made such faces it was a wonder the gun went off. But though I could\nhardly hold the gun, unless with my back against a bar, it did me good\nto hear it go off, and hope to have hitten his enemies.\n\n\"Oh, mother, mother,\" I said that day, directly after dinner, while she\nwas sitting looking at me, and almost ready to say (as now she did seven\ntimes in a week), \"How like your father you are growing! Jack, come here\nand kiss me\"--\"oh, mother, if you only knew how much I want a shilling!\"\n\n\"Jack, you shall never want a shilling while I am alive to give thee\none. But what is it for, dear heart, dear heart?\"\n\n\"To buy something over at Porlock, mother. Perhaps I will tell you\nafterwards. If I tell not it will be for your good, and for the sake of\nthe children.\"\n\n\"Bless the boy, one would think he was threescore years of age at least.\nGive me a little kiss, you Jack, and you shall have the shilling.\"\n\nFor I hated to kiss or be kissed in those days: and so all honest boys\nmust do, when God puts any strength in them. But now I wanted the powder\nso much that I went and kissed mother very shyly, looking round the\ncorner first, for Betty not to see me.\n\nBut mother gave me half a dozen, and only one shilling for all of them;\nand I could not find it in my heart to ask her for another, although I\nwould have taken it. In very quick time I ran away with the shilling\nin my pocket, and got Peggy out on the Porlock road without my mother\nknowing it. For mother was frightened of that road now, as if all the\ntrees were murderers, and would never let me go alone so much as a\nhundred yards on it. And, to tell the truth, I was touched with fear for\nmany years about it; and even now, when I ride at dark there, a man by\na peat-rick makes me shiver, until I go and collar him. But this time\nI was very bold, having John Fry's blunderbuss, and keeping a sharp\nlook-out wherever any lurking place was. However, I saw only sheep and\nsmall red cattle, and the common deer of the forest, until I was nigh to\nPorlock town, and then rode straight to Mr. Pooke's, at the sign of the\nSpit and Gridiron.\n\nMr. Pooke was asleep, as it happened, not having much to do that day;\nand so I fastened Peggy by the handle of a warming-pan, at which she\nhad no better manners than to snort and blow her breath; and in I walked\nwith a manful style, bearing John Fry's blunderbuss. Now Timothy Pooke\nwas a peaceful man, glad to live without any enjoyment of mind at\ndanger, and I was tall and large already as most lads of a riper age.\nMr. Pooke, as soon as he opened his eyes, dropped suddenly under the\ncounting-board, and drew a great frying-pan over his head, as if the\nDoones were come to rob him, as their custom was, mostly after the\nfair-time. It made me feel rather hot and queer to be taken for a\nrobber; and yet methinks I was proud of it.\n\n\"Gadzooks, Master Pooke,\" said I, having learned fine words at Tiverton;\n\"do you suppose that I know not then the way to carry firearms? An it\nwere the old Spanish match-lock in the lieu of this good flint-engine,\nwhich may be borne ten miles or more and never once go off, scarcely\ncouldst thou seem more scared. I might point at thee muzzle on--just so\nas I do now--even for an hour or more, and like enough it would never\nshoot thee, unless I pulled the trigger hard, with a crock upon my\nfinger; so you see; just so, Master Pooke, only a trifle harder.\"\n\n\"God sake, John Ridd, God sake, dear boy,\" cried Pooke, knowing me by\nthis time; \"don't 'e, for good love now, don't 'e show it to me, boy,\nas if I was to suck it. Put 'un down, for good, now; and thee shall have\nthe very best of all is in the shop.\"\n\n\"Ho!\" I replied with much contempt, and swinging round the gun so that\nit fetched his hoop of candles down, all unkindled as they were: \"Ho!\nas if I had not attained to the handling of a gun yet! My hands are cold\ncoming over the moors, else would I go bail to point the mouth at you\nfor an hour, sir, and no cause for uneasiness.\"\n\nBut in spite of all assurances, he showed himself desirous only to see\nthe last of my gun and me. I dare say \"villainous saltpetre,\" as the\ngreat playwright calls it, was never so cheap before nor since. For my\nshilling Master Pooke afforded me two great packages over-large to go\ninto my pockets, as well as a mighty chunk of lead, which I bound upon\nPeggy's withers. And as if all this had not been enough, he presented me\nwith a roll of comfits for my sister Annie, whose gentle face and pretty\nmanners won the love of everybody.\n\nThere was still some daylight here and there as I rose the hill above\nPorlock, wondering whether my mother would be in a fright, or would not\nknow it. The two great packages of powder, slung behind my back, knocked\nso hard against one another that I feared they must either spill or blow\nup, and hurry me over Peggy's ears from the woollen cloth I rode\nupon. For father always liked a horse to have some wool upon his loins\nwhenever he went far from home, and had to stand about, where one\npleased, hot, and wet, and panting. And father always said that saddles\nwere meant for men full-grown and heavy, and losing their activity; and\nno boy or young man on our farm durst ever get into a saddle, because\nthey all knew that the master would chuck them out pretty quickly. As\nfor me, I had tried it once, from a kind of curiosity; and I could not\nwalk for two or three days, the leather galled my knees so. But now, as\nPeggy bore me bravely, snorting every now and then into a cloud of air,\nfor the night was growing frosty, presently the moon arose over the\nshoulder of a hill, and the pony and I were half glad to see her, and\nhalf afraid of the shadows she threw, and the images all around us. I\nwas ready at any moment to shoot at anybody, having great faith in my\nblunderbuss, but hoping not to prove it. And as I passed the narrow\nplace where the Doones had killed my father, such a fear broke out upon\nme that I leaned upon the neck of Peggy, and shut my eyes, and was cold\nall over. However, there was not a soul to be seen, until we came home\nto the old farmyard, and there was my mother crying sadly, and Betty\nMuxworthy scolding.\n\n\"Come along, now,\" I whispered to Annie, the moment supper was over;\n\"and if you can hold your tongue, Annie, I will show you something.\"\n\nShe lifted herself on the bench so quickly, and flushed so rich with\npleasure, that I was obliged to stare hard away, and make Betty look\nbeyond us. Betty thought I had something hid in the closet beyond the\nclock-case, and she was the more convinced of it by reason of my denial.\nNot that Betty Muxworthy, or any one else, for that matter, ever found\nme in a falsehood, because I never told one, not even to my mother--or,\nwhich is still a stronger thing, not even to my sweetheart (when I grew\nup to have one)--but that Betty being wronged in the matter of marriage,\na generation or two agone, by a man who came hedging and ditching, had\nnow no mercy, except to believe that men from cradle to grave are liars,\nand women fools to look at them.\n\nWhen Betty could find no crime of mine, she knocked me out of the way in\na minute, as if I had been nobody; and then she began to coax \"Mistress\nAnnie,\" as she always called her, and draw the soft hair down her hands,\nand whisper into the little ears. Meanwhile, dear mother was falling\nasleep, having been troubled so much about me; and Watch, my father's\npet dog, was nodding closer and closer up into her lap.\n\n\"Now, Annie, will you come?\" I said, for I wanted her to hold the ladle\nfor melting of the lead; \"will you come at once, Annie? or must I go for\nLizzie, and let her see the whole of it?\"\n\n\"Indeed, then, you won't do that,\" said Annie; \"Lizzie to come before\nme, John; and she can't stir a pot of brewis, and scarce knows a tongue\nfrom a ham, John, and says it makes no difference, because both are\ngood to eat! Oh, Betty, what do you think of that to come of all her\nbook-learning?\"\n\n\"Thank God he can't say that of me,\" Betty answered shortly, for she\nnever cared about argument, except on her own side; \"thank he, I says,\nevery marning a'most, never to lead me astray so. Men is desaving and so\nis galanies; but the most desaving of all is books, with their heads\nand tails, and the speckots in 'em, lik a peg as have taken the maisles.\nSome folk purtends to laugh and cry over them. God forgive them for\nliars!\"\n\nIt was part of Betty's obstinacy that she never would believe in reading\nor the possibility of it, but stoutly maintained to the very last that\npeople first learned things by heart, and then pretended to make them\nout from patterns done upon paper, for the sake of astonishing honest\nfolk just as do the conjurers. And even to see the parson and clerk was\nnot enough to convince her; all she said was, \"It made no odds, they\nwere all the same as the rest of us.\" And now that she had been on\nthe farm nigh upon forty years, and had nursed my father, and made his\nclothes, and all that he had to eat, and then put him in his coffin, she\nwas come to such authority, that it was not worth the wages of the best\nman on the place to say a word in answer to Betty, even if he would face\nthe risk to have ten for one, or twenty.\n\nAnnie was her love and joy. For Annie she would do anything, even so far\nas to try to smile, when the little maid laughed and danced to her. And\nin truth I know not how it was, but every one was taken with Annie at\nthe very first time of seeing her. She had such pretty ways and manners,\nand such a look of kindness, and a sweet soft light in her long blue\neyes full of trustful gladness. Everybody who looked at her seemed to\ngrow the better for it, because she knew no evil. And then the turn she\nhad for cooking, you never would have expected it; and how it was her\nrichest mirth to see that she had pleased you. I have been out on the\nworld a vast deal as you will own hereafter, and yet have I never seen\nAnnie's equal for making a weary man comfortable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHARD IT IS TO CLIMB\n\n[Illustration: 051.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nSo many a winter night went by in a hopeful and pleasant manner, with\nthe hissing of the bright round bullets, cast into the water, and the\nspluttering of the great red apples which Annie was roasting for me. We\nalways managed our evening's work in the chimney of the back-kitchen,\nwhere there was room to set chairs and table, in spite of the fire\nburning. On the right-hand side was a mighty oven, where Betty\nthreatened to bake us; and on the left, long sides of bacon, made of\nfavoured pigs, and growing very brown and comely. Annie knew the names\nof all, and ran up through the wood-smoke, every now and then, when a\ngentle memory moved her, and asked them how they were getting on, and\nwhen they would like to be eaten. Then she came back with foolish tears,\nat thinking of that necessity; and I, being soft in a different way,\nwould make up my mind against bacon.\n\nBut, Lord bless you! it was no good. Whenever it came to breakfast-time,\nafter three hours upon the moors, I regularly forgot the pigs, but paid\ngood heed to the rashers. For ours is a hungry county, if such there\nbe in England; a place, I mean, where men must eat, and are quick to\ndischarge the duty. The air of the moors is so shrewd and wholesome,\nstirring a man's recollection of the good things which have betided him,\nand whetting his hope of something still better in the future, that by\nthe time he sits down to a cloth, his heart and stomach are tuned too\nwell to say \"nay\" to one another.\n\nAlmost everybody knows, in our part of the world at least, how pleasant\nand soft the fall of the land is round about Plover's Barrows farm. All\nabove it is strong dark mountain, spread with heath, and desolate, but\nnear our house the valleys cove, and open warmth and shelter. Here are\ntrees, and bright green grass, and orchards full of contentment, and\na man may scarce espy the brook, although he hears it everywhere. And\nindeed a stout good piece of it comes through our farm-yard, and swells\nsometimes to a rush of waves, when the clouds are on the hill-tops. But\nall below, where the valley bends, and the Lynn stream comes along with\nit, pretty meadows slope their breast, and the sun spreads on the water.\nAnd nearly all of this is ours, till you come to Nicholas Snowe's land.\n\nBut about two miles below our farm, the Bagworthy water runs into\nthe Lynn, and makes a real river of it. Thence it hurries away, with\nstrength and a force of wilful waters, under the foot of a barefaced\nhill, and so to rocks and woods again, where the stream is covered over,\nand dark, heavy pools delay it. There are plenty of fish all down this\nway, and the farther you go the larger they get, having deeper grounds\nto feed in; and sometimes in the summer months, when mother could spare\nme off the farm, I came down here, with Annie to help (because it was so\nlonely), and caught well-nigh a basketful of little trout and minnows,\nwith a hook and a bit of worm on it, or a fern-web, or a blow-fly, hung\nfrom a hazel pulse-stick. For of all the things I learned at Blundell's,\nonly two abode with me, and one of these was the knack of fishing, and\nthe other the art of swimming. And indeed they have a very rude manner\nof teaching children to swim there; for the big boys take the little\nboys, and put them through a certain process, which they grimly call\n\"sheep-washing.\" In the third meadow from the gate of the school, going\nup the river, there is a fine pool in the Lowman, where the Taunton\nbrook comes in, and they call it the Taunton Pool. The water runs down\nwith a strong sharp stickle, and then has a sudden elbow in it, where\nthe small brook trickles in; and on that side the bank is steep, four or\nit may be five feet high, overhanging loamily; but on the other side it\nis flat, pebbly, and fit to land upon. Now the large boys take the small\nboys, crying sadly for mercy, and thinking mayhap, of their mothers,\nwith hands laid well at the back of their necks, they bring them up to\nthe crest of the bank upon the eastern side, and make them strip their\nclothes off. Then the little boys, falling on their naked knees, blubber\nupwards piteously; but the large boys know what is good for them, and\nwill not be entreated. So they cast them down, one after other into the\nsplash of the water, and watch them go to the bottom first, and then\ncome up and fight for it, with a blowing and a bubbling. It is a very\nfair sight to watch when you know there is little danger, because,\nalthough the pool is deep, the current is sure to wash a boy up on the\nstones, where the end of the depth is. As for me, they had no need to\nthrow me more than once, because I jumped of my own accord, thinking\nsmall things of the Lowman, after the violent Lynn. Nevertheless, I\nlearnt to swim there, as all the other boys did; for the greatest point\nin learning that is to find that you must do it. I loved the water\nnaturally, and could not long be out of it; but even the boys who hated\nit most, came to swim in some fashion or other, after they had been\nflung for a year or two into the Taunton pool.\n\nBut now, although my sister Annie came to keep me company, and was not\nto be parted from me by the tricks of the Lynn stream, because I put her\non my back and carried her across, whenever she could not leap it, or\ntuck up her things and take the stones; yet so it happened that neither\nof us had been up the Bagworthy water. We knew that it brought a good\nstream down, as full of fish as of pebbles; and we thought that it must\nbe very pretty to make a way where no way was, nor even a bullock came\ndown to drink. But whether we were afraid or not, I am sure I cannot\ntell, because it is so long ago; but I think that had something to do\nwith it. For Bagworthy water ran out of Doone valley, a mile or so from\nthe mouth of it.\n\nBut when I was turned fourteen years old, and put into good\nsmall-clothes, buckled at the knee, and strong blue worsted hosen,\nknitted by my mother, it happened to me without choice, I may say, to\nexplore the Bagworthy water. And it came about in this wise.\n\nMy mother had long been ailing, and not well able to eat much; and there\nis nothing that frightens us so much as for people to have no love of\ntheir victuals. Now I chanced to remember that once at the time of\nthe holidays I had brought dear mother from Tiverton a jar of pickled\nloaches, caught by myself in the Lowman river, and baked in the kitchen\noven, with vinegar, a few leaves of bay, and about a dozen pepper-corns.\nAnd mother had said that in all her life she had never tasted anything\nfit to be compared with them. Whether she said so good a thing out of\ncompliment to my skill in catching the fish and cooking them, or whether\nshe really meant it, is more than I can tell, though I quite believe\nthe latter, and so would most people who tasted them; at any rate, I\nnow resolved to get some loaches for her, and do them in the self-same\nmanner, just to make her eat a bit.\n\nThere are many people, even now, who have not come to the right\nknowledge what a loach is, and where he lives, and how to catch and\npickle him. And I will not tell them all about it, because if I did,\nvery likely there would be no loaches left ten or twenty years after the\nappearance of this book. A pickled minnow is very good if you catch him\nin a stickle, with the scarlet fingers upon him; but I count him no more\nthan the ropes in beer compared with a loach done properly.\n\nBeing resolved to catch some loaches, whatever trouble it cost me, I set\nforth without a word to any one, in the forenoon of St. Valentine's\nday, 1675-6, I think it must have been. Annie should not come with me,\nbecause the water was too cold; for the winter had been long, and snow\nlay here and there in patches in the hollow of the banks, like a lady's\ngloves forgotten. And yet the spring was breaking forth, as it always\ndoes in Devonshire, when the turn of the days is over; and though there\nwas little to see of it, the air was full of feeling.\n\nIt puzzles me now, that I remember all those young impressions so,\nbecause I took no heed of them at the time whatever; and yet they\ncome upon me bright, when nothing else is evident in the gray fog\nof experience. I am like an old man gazing at the outside of his\nspectacles, and seeing, as he rubs the dust, the image of his grandson\nplaying at bo-peep with him.\n\nBut let me be of any age, I never could forget that day, and how bitter\ncold the water was. For I doffed my shoes and hose, and put them into\na bag about my neck; and left my little coat at home, and tied my\nshirt-sleeves back to my shoulders. Then I took a three-pronged fork\nfirmly bound to a rod with cord, and a piece of canvas kerchief, with\na lump of bread inside it; and so went into the pebbly water, trying to\nthink how warm it was. For more than a mile all down the Lynn stream,\nscarcely a stone I left unturned, being thoroughly skilled in the tricks\nof the loach, and knowing how he hides himself. For being gray-spotted,\nand clear to see through, and something like a cuttle-fish, only more\nsubstantial, he will stay quite still where a streak of weed is in the\nrapid water, hoping to be overlooked, not caring even to wag his tail.\nThen being disturbed he flips away, like whalebone from the finger, and\nhies to a shelf of stone, and lies with his sharp head poked in under\nit; or sometimes he bellies him into the mud, and only shows his\nback-ridge. And that is the time to spear him nicely, holding the fork\nvery gingerly, and allowing for the bent of it, which comes to pass, I\nknow not how, at the tickle of air and water.\n\nOr if your loach should not be abroad when first you come to look for\nhim, but keeping snug in his little home, then you may see him come\nforth amazed at the quivering of the shingles, and oar himself and look\nat you, and then dart up-stream, like a little grey streak; and then you\nmust try to mark him in, and follow very daintily. So after that, in a\nsandy place, you steal up behind his tail to him, so that he cannot set\neyes on you, for his head is up-stream always, and there you see him\nabiding still, clear, and mild, and affable. Then, as he looks so\ninnocent, you make full sure to prog him well, in spite of the wry of\nthe water, and the sun making elbows to everything, and the trembling\nof your fingers. But when you gird at him lovingly, and have as good as\ngotten him, lo! in the go-by of the river he is gone as a shadow goes,\nand only a little cloud of mud curls away from the points of the fork.\n\nA long way down that limpid water, chill and bright as an iceberg, went\nmy little self that day on man's choice errand--destruction. All\nthe young fish seemed to know that I was one who had taken out God's\ncertificate, and meant to have the value of it; every one of them was\naware that we desolate more than replenish the earth. For a cow\nmight come and look into the water, and put her yellow lips down; a\nkingfisher, like a blue arrow, might shoot through the dark alleys over\nthe channel, or sit on a dipping withy-bough with his beak sunk into his\nbreast-feathers; even an otter might float downstream likening himself\nto a log of wood, with his flat head flush with the water-top, and his\noily eyes peering quietly; and yet no panic would seize other life, as\nit does when a sample of man comes.\n\nNow let not any one suppose that I thought of these things when I was\nyoung, for I knew not the way to do it. And proud enough in truth I\nwas at the universal fear I spread in all those lonely places, where I\nmyself must have been afraid, if anything had come up to me. It is\nall very pretty to see the trees big with their hopes of another year,\nthough dumb as yet on the subject, and the waters murmuring gaiety,\nand the banks spread out with comfort; but a boy takes none of this to\nheart; unless he be meant for a poet (which God can never charge upon\nme), and he would liefer have a good apple, or even a bad one, if he\nstole it.\n\nWhen I had travelled two miles or so, conquered now and then with cold,\nand coming out to rub my legs into a lively friction, and only fishing\nhere and there, because of the tumbling water; suddenly, in an open\nspace, where meadows spread about it, I found a good stream flowing\nsoftly into the body of our brook. And it brought, so far as I could\nguess by the sweep of it under my knee-caps, a larger power of clear\nwater than the Lynn itself had; only it came more quietly down, not\nbeing troubled with stairs and steps, as the fortune of the Lynn is, but\ngliding smoothly and forcibly, as if upon some set purpose.\n\nHereupon I drew up and thought, and reason was much inside me; because\nthe water was bitter cold, and my little toes were aching. So on the\nbank I rubbed them well with a sprout of young sting-nettle, and having\nskipped about awhile, was kindly inclined to eat a bit.\n\nNow all the turn of all my life hung upon that moment. But as I sat\nthere munching a crust of Betty Muxworthy's sweet brown bread, and a bit\nof cold bacon along with it, and kicking my little red heels against the\ndry loam to keep them warm, I knew no more than fish under the fork what\nwas going on over me. It seemed a sad business to go back now and tell\nAnnie there were no loaches; and yet it was a frightful thing, knowing\nwhat I did of it, to venture, where no grown man durst, up the Bagworthy\nwater. And please to recollect that I was only a boy in those days, fond\nenough of anything new, but not like a man to meet it.\n\nHowever, as I ate more and more, my spirit arose within me, and I\nthought of what my father had been, and how he had told me a hundred\ntimes never to be a coward. And then I grew warm, and my little heart\nwas ashamed of its pit-a-patting, and I said to myself, \"now if father\nlooks, he shall see that I obey him.\" So I put the bag round my back\nagain, and buckled my breeches far up from the knee, expecting deeper\nwater, and crossing the Lynn, went stoutly up under the branches which\nhang so dark on the Bagworthy river.\n\nI found it strongly over-woven, turned, and torn with thicket-wood, but\nnot so rocky as the Lynn, and more inclined to go evenly. There were\nbars of chafed stakes stretched from the sides half-way across the\ncurrent, and light outriders of pithy weed, and blades of last year's\nwater-grass trembling in the quiet places, like a spider's threads, on\nthe transparent stillness, with a tint of olive moving it. And here and\nthere the sun came in, as if his light was sifted, making dance upon the\nwaves, and shadowing the pebbles.\n\nHere, although affrighted often by the deep, dark places, and feeling\nthat every step I took might never be taken backward, on the whole I\nhad very comely sport of loaches, trout, and minnows, forking some, and\ntickling some, and driving others to shallow nooks, whence I could bail\nthem ashore. Now, if you have ever been fishing, you will not wonder\nthat I was led on, forgetting all about danger, and taking no heed of\nthe time, but shouting in a childish way whenever I caught a \"whacker\"\n(as we called a big fish at Tiverton); and in sooth there were very\nfine loaches here, having more lie and harbourage than in the rough Lynn\nstream, though not quite so large as in the Lowman, where I have even\ntaken them to the weight of half a pound.\n\nBut in answer to all my shouts there never was any sound at all, except\nof a rocky echo, or a scared bird hustling away, or the sudden dive of a\nwater-vole; and the place grew thicker and thicker, and the covert grew\ndarker above me, until I thought that the fishes might have good chance\nof eating me, instead of my eating the fishes.\n\nFor now the day was falling fast behind the brown of the hill-tops, and\nthe trees, being void of leaf and hard, seemed giants ready to beat me.\nAnd every moment as the sky was clearing up for a white frost, the cold\nof the water got worse and worse, until I was fit to cry with it. And\nso, in a sorry plight, I came to an opening in the bushes, where a great\nblack pool lay in front of me, whitened with snow (as I thought) at the\nsides, till I saw it was only foam-froth.\n\nNow, though I could swim with great ease and comfort, and feared no\ndepth of water, when I could fairly come to it, yet I had no desire to\ngo over head and ears into this great pool, being so cramped and weary,\nand cold enough in all conscience, though wet only up to the middle,\nnot counting my arms and shoulders. And the look of this black pit was\nenough to stop one from diving into it, even on a hot summer's day with\nsunshine on the water; I mean, if the sun ever shone there. As it was, I\nshuddered and drew back; not alone at the pool itself and the black\nair there was about it, but also at the whirling manner, and wisping of\nwhite threads upon it in stripy circles round and round; and the centre\nstill as jet.\n\nBut soon I saw the reason of the stir and depth of that great pit, as\nwell as of the roaring sound which long had made me wonder. For skirting\nround one side, with very little comfort, because the rocks were high\nand steep, and the ledge at the foot so narrow, I came to a sudden sight\nand marvel, such as I never dreamed of. For, lo! I stood at the foot of\na long pale slide of water, coming smoothly to me, without any break or\nhindrance, for a hundred yards or more, and fenced on either side with\ncliff, sheer, and straight, and shining. The water neither ran nor fell,\nnor leaped with any spouting, but made one even slope of it, as if it\nhad been combed or planed, and looking like a plank of deal laid down a\ndeep black staircase. However, there was no side-rail, nor any place to\nwalk upon, only the channel a fathom wide, and the perpendicular walls\nof crag shutting out the evening.\n\n[Illustration: 058.jpg A long pale slide of water]\n\nThe look of this place had a sad effect, scaring me very greatly, and\nmaking me feel that I would give something only to be at home again,\nwith Annie cooking my supper, and our dog Watch sniffing upward. But\nnothing would come of wishing; that I had long found out; and it only\nmade one the less inclined to work without white feather. So I laid the\ncase before me in a little council; not for loss of time, but only that\nI wanted rest, and to see things truly.\n\nThen says I to myself--\"John Ridd, these trees, and pools, and lonesome\nrocks, and setting of the sunlight are making a gruesome coward of thee.\nShall I go back to my mother so, and be called her fearless boy?\"\n\nNevertheless, I am free to own that it was not any fine sense of shame\nwhich settled my decision; for indeed there was nearly as much of danger\nin going back as in going on, and perhaps even more of labour, the\njourney being so roundabout. But that which saved me from turning back\nwas a strange inquisitive desire, very unbecoming in a boy of little\nyears; in a word, I would risk a great deal to know what made the water\ncome down like that, and what there was at the top of it.\n\nTherefore, seeing hard strife before me, I girt up my breeches anew,\nwith each buckle one hole tighter, for the sodden straps were stretching\nand giving, and mayhap my legs were grown smaller from the coldness\nof it. Then I bestowed my fish around my neck more tightly, and not\nstopping to look much, for fear of fear, crawled along over the fork of\nrocks, where the water had scooped the stone out, and shunning thus the\nledge from whence it rose like the mane of a white horse into the broad\nblack pool, softly I let my feet into the dip and rush of the torrent.\n\nAnd here I had reckoned without my host, although (as I thought) so\nclever; and it was much but that I went down into the great black pool,\nand had never been heard of more; and this must have been the end of me,\nexcept for my trusty loach-fork. For the green wave came down like great\nbottles upon me, and my legs were gone off in a moment, and I had not\ntime to cry out with wonder, only to think of my mother and Annie, and\nknock my head very sadly, which made it go round so that brains were\nno good, even if I had any. But all in a moment, before I knew aught,\nexcept that I must die out of the way, with a roar of water upon me, my\nfork, praise God stuck fast in the rock, and I was borne up upon it. I\nfelt nothing except that here was another matter to begin upon; and it\nmight be worth while, or again it might not, to have another fight for\nit. But presently the dash of the water upon my face revived me, and my\nmind grew used to the roar of it, and meseemed I had been worse off than\nthis, when first flung into the Lowman.\n\nTherefore I gathered my legs back slowly, as if they were fish to be\nlanded, stopping whenever the water flew too strongly off my shin-bones,\nand coming along without sticking out to let the wave get hold of\nme. And in this manner I won a footing, leaning well forward like a\ndraught-horse, and balancing on my strength as it were, with the ashen\nstake set behind me. Then I said to my self, \"John Ridd, the sooner you\nget yourself out by the way you came, the better it will be for you.\"\nBut to my great dismay and affright, I saw that no choice was left me\nnow, except that I must climb somehow up that hill of water, or else be\nwashed down into the pool and whirl around it till it drowned me. For\nthere was no chance of fetching back by the way I had gone down into\nit, and further up was a hedge of rock on either side of the waterway,\nrising a hundred yards in height, and for all I could tell five hundred,\nand no place to set a foot in.\n\nHaving said the Lord's Prayer (which was all I knew), and made a very\nbad job of it, I grasped the good loach-stick under a knot, and steadied\nme with my left hand, and so with a sigh of despair began my course up\nthe fearful torrent-way. To me it seemed half a mile at least of sliding\nwater above me, but in truth it was little more than a furlong, as I\ncame to know afterwards. It would have been a hard ascent even without\nthe slippery slime and the force of the river over it, and I had scanty\nhope indeed of ever winning the summit. Nevertheless, my terror left\nme, now I was face to face with it, and had to meet the worst; and I set\nmyself to do my best with a vigour and sort of hardness which did not\nthen surprise me, but have done so ever since.\n\nThe water was only six inches deep, or from that to nine at the utmost,\nand all the way up I could see my feet looking white in the gloom of\nthe hollow, and here and there I found resting-place, to hold on by the\ncliff and pant awhile. And gradually as I went on, a warmth of courage\nbreathed in me, to think that perhaps no other had dared to try that\npass before me, and to wonder what mother would say to it. And then came\nthought of my father also, and the pain of my feet abated.\n\nHow I went carefully, step by step, keeping my arms in front of me, and\nnever daring to straighten my knees is more than I can tell clearly, or\neven like now to think of, because it makes me dream of it. Only I must\nacknowledge that the greatest danger of all was just where I saw no\njeopardy, but ran up a patch of black ooze-weed in a very boastful\nmanner, being now not far from the summit.\n\nHere I fell very piteously, and was like to have broken my knee-cap, and\nthe torrent got hold of my other leg while I was indulging the bruised\none. And then a vile knotting of cramp disabled me, and for awhile I\ncould only roar, till my mouth was full of water, and all of my body was\nsliding. But the fright of that brought me to again, and my elbow caught\nin a rock-hole; and so I managed to start again, with the help of more\nhumility.\n\nNow being in the most dreadful fright, because I was so near the top,\nand hope was beating within me, I laboured hard with both legs and arms,\ngoing like a mill and grunting. At last the rush of forked water, where\nfirst it came over the lips of the fall, drove me into the middle, and\nI stuck awhile with my toe-balls on the slippery links of the pop-weed,\nand the world was green and gliddery, and I durst not look behind me.\nThen I made up my mind to die at last; for so my legs would ache no\nmore, and my breath not pain my heart so; only it did seem such a pity\nafter fighting so long to give in, and the light was coming upon me, and\nagain I fought towards it; then suddenly I felt fresh air, and fell into\nit headlong.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA BOY AND A GIRL\n\n[Illustration: 062.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nWhen I came to myself again, my hands were full of\nyoung grass and mould, and a little girl kneeling at my side was rubbing\nmy forehead tenderly with a dock-leaf and a handkerchief.\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad,\" she whispered softly, as I opened my eyes and looked\nat her; \"now you will try to be better, won't you?\"\n\nI had never heard so sweet a sound as came from between her bright red\nlips, while there she knelt and gazed at me; neither had I ever seen\nanything so beautiful as the large dark eyes intent upon me, full of\npity and wonder. And then, my nature being slow, and perhaps, for that\nmatter, heavy, I wandered with my hazy eyes down the black shower of\nher hair, as to my jaded gaze it seemed; and where it fell on the turf,\namong it (like an early star) was the first primrose of the season. And\nsince that day I think of her, through all the rough storms of my life,\nwhen I see an early primrose. Perhaps she liked my countenance, and\nindeed I know she did, because she said so afterwards; although at the\ntime she was too young to know what made her take to me. Not that I had\nany beauty, or ever pretended to have any, only a solid healthy face,\nwhich many girls have laughed at.\n\nThereupon I sate upright, with my little trident still in one hand, and\nwas much afraid to speak to her, being conscious of my country-brogue,\nlest she should cease to like me. But she clapped her hands, and made a\ntrifling dance around my back, and came to me on the other side, as if I\nwere a great plaything.\n\n[Illustration: 063.jpg Sate upright]\n\n\"What is your name?\" she said, as if she had every right to ask me; \"and\nhow did you come here, and what are these wet things in this great bag?\"\n\n\"You had better let them alone,\" I said; \"they are loaches for my\nmother. But I will give you some, if you like.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how much you think of them! Why, they are only fish. But how\nyour feet are bleeding! oh, I must tie them up for you. And no shoes nor\nstockings! Is your mother very poor, poor boy?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, being vexed at this; \"we are rich enough to buy all this\ngreat meadow, if we chose; and here my shoes and stockings be.\"\n\n\"Why, they are quite as wet as your feet; and I cannot bear to see your\nfeet. Oh, please to let me manage them; I will do it very softly.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think much of that,\" I replied; \"I shall put some\ngoose-grease to them. But how you are looking at me! I never saw any one\nlike you before. My name is John Ridd. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Lorna Doone,\" she answered, in a low voice, as if afraid of it, and\nhanging her head so that I could see only her forehead and eyelashes;\n\"if you please, my name is Lorna Doone; and I thought you must have\nknown it.\"\n\nThen I stood up and touched her hand, and tried to make her look at me;\nbut she only turned away the more. Young and harmless as she was, her\nname alone made guilt of her. Nevertheless I could not help looking at\nher tenderly, and the more when her blushes turned into tears, and her\ntears to long, low sobs.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" I said, \"whatever you do. I am sure you have never done any\nharm. I will give you all my fish Lorna, and catch some more for mother;\nonly don't be angry with me.\"\n\nShe flung her little soft arms up in the passion of her tears, and\nlooked at me so piteously, that what did I do but kiss her. It seemed to\nbe a very odd thing, when I came to think of it, because I hated kissing\nso, as all honest boys must do. But she touched my heart with a sudden\ndelight, like a cowslip-blossom (although there were none to be seen\nyet), and the sweetest flowers of spring.\n\nShe gave me no encouragement, as my mother in her place would have done;\nnay, she even wiped her lips (which methought was rather rude of her),\nand drew away, and smoothed her dress, as if I had used a freedom. Then\nI felt my cheeks grow burning red, and I gazed at my legs and was\nsorry. For although she was not at all a proud child (at any rate in her\ncountenance), yet I knew that she was by birth a thousand years in front\nof me. They might have taken and framed me, or (which would be more to\nthe purpose) my sisters, until it was time for us to die, and then have\ntrained our children after us, for many generations; yet never could we\nhave gotten that look upon our faces which Lorna Doone had naturally, as\nif she had been born to it.\n\nHere was I, a yeoman's boy, a yeoman every inch of me, even where I was\nnaked; and there was she, a lady born, and thoroughly aware of it, and\ndressed by people of rank and taste, who took pride in her beauty and\nset it to advantage. For though her hair was fallen down by reason of\nher wildness, and some of her frock was touched with wet where she had\ntended me so, behold her dress was pretty enough for the queen of all\nthe angels. The colours were bright and rich indeed, and the substance\nvery sumptuous, yet simple and free from tinsel stuff, and matching most\nharmoniously. All from her waist to her neck was white, plaited in close\nlike a curtain, and the dark soft weeping of her hair, and the shadowy\nlight of her eyes (like a wood rayed through with sunset), made it seem\nyet whiter, as if it were done on purpose. As for the rest, she knew\nwhat it was a great deal better than I did, for I never could look far\naway from her eyes when they were opened upon me.\n\nNow, seeing how I heeded her, and feeling that I had kissed her,\nalthough she was such a little girl, eight years old or thereabouts, she\nturned to the stream in a bashful manner, and began to watch the water,\nand rubbed one leg against the other.\n\nI, for my part, being vexed at her behaviour to me, took up all my\nthings to go, and made a fuss about it; to let her know I was going.\nBut she did not call me back at all, as I had made sure she would do;\nmoreover, I knew that to try the descent was almost certain death to\nme, and it looked as dark as pitch; and so at the mouth I turned round\nagain, and came back to her, and said, \"Lorna.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought you were gone,\" she answered; \"why did you ever come\nhere? Do you know what they would do to us, if they found you here with\nme?\"\n\n\"Beat us, I dare say, very hard; or me, at least. They could never beat\nyou.\"\n\n\"No. They would kill us both outright, and bury us here by the water;\nand the water often tells me that I must come to that.\"\n\n\"But what should they kill me for?\"\n\n\"Because you have found the way up here, and they never could believe\nit. Now, please to go; oh, please to go. They will kill us both in\na moment. Yes, I like you very much\"--for I was teasing her to say\nit--\"very much indeed, and I will call you John Ridd, if you like; only\nplease to go, John. And when your feet are well, you know, you can come\nand tell me how they are.\"\n\n\"But I tell you, Lorna, I like you very much indeed--nearly as much as\nAnnie, and a great deal more than Lizzie. And I never saw any one like\nyou, and I must come back again to-morrow, and so must you, to see me;\nand I will bring you such lots of things--there are apples still, and\na thrush I caught with only one leg broken, and our dog has just had\npuppies--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, they won't let me have a dog. There is not a dog in the\nvalley. They say they are such noisy things--\"\n\n\"Only put your hand in mine--what little things they are, Lorna! And I\nwill bring you the loveliest dog; I will show you just how long he is.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" A shout came down the valley, and all my heart was trembling,\nlike water after sunset, and Lorna's face was altered from pleasant play\nto terror. She shrank to me, and looked up at me, with such a power of\nweakness, that I at once made up my mind to save her or to die with her.\nA tingle went through all my bones, and I only longed for my carbine.\nThe little girl took courage from me, and put her cheek quite close to\nmine.\n\n\"Come with me down the waterfall. I can carry you easily; and mother\nwill take care of you.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried, as I took her up: \"I will tell you what to do. They\nare only looking for me. You see that hole, that hole there?\"\n\nShe pointed to a little niche in the rock which verged the meadow, about\nfifty yards away from us. In the fading of the twilight I could just\ndescry it.\n\n\"Yes, I see it; but they will see me crossing the grass to get there.\"\n\n\"Look! look!\" She could hardly speak. \"There is a way out from the top\nof it; they would kill me if I told it. Oh, here they come, I can see\nthem.\"\n\nThe little maid turned as white as the snow which hung on the rocks\nabove her, and she looked at the water and then at me, and she cried,\n\"Oh dear! oh dear!\" And then she began to sob aloud, being so young and\nunready. But I drew her behind the withy-bushes, and close down to the\nwater, where it was quiet and shelving deep, ere it came to the lip of\nthe chasm. Here they could not see either of us from the upper valley,\nand might have sought a long time for us, even when they came quite\nnear, if the trees had been clad with their summer clothes. Luckily I\nhad picked up my fish and taken my three-pronged fork away.\n\nCrouching in that hollow nest, as children get together in ever so\nlittle compass, I saw a dozen fierce men come down, on the other side of\nthe water, not bearing any fire-arms, but looking lax and jovial, as if\nthey were come from riding and a dinner taken hungrily. \"Queen, queen!\"\nthey were shouting, here and there, and now and then: \"where the pest is\nour little queen gone?\"\n\n\"They always call me 'queen,' and I am to be queen by-and-by,\" Lorna\nwhispered to me, with her soft cheek on my rough one, and her little\nheart beating against me: \"oh, they are crossing by the timber there,\nand then they are sure to see us.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said I; \"now I see what to do. I must get into the water, and\nyou must go to sleep.\"\n\n\"To be sure, yes, away in the meadow there. But how bitter cold it will\nbe for you!\"\n\nShe saw in a moment the way to do it, sooner than I could tell her; and\nthere was no time to lose.\n\n\"Now mind you never come again,\" she whispered over her shoulder, as she\ncrept away with a childish twist hiding her white front from me; \"only I\nshall come sometimes--oh, here they are, Madonna!\"\n\nDaring scarce to peep, I crept into the water, and lay down bodily\nin it, with my head between two blocks of stone, and some flood-drift\ncombing over me. The dusk was deepening between the hills, and a white\nmist lay on the river; but I, being in the channel of it, could see\nevery ripple, and twig, and rush, and glazing of twilight above it, as\nbright as in a picture; so that to my ignorance there seemed no chance\nat all but what the men must find me. For all this time they were\nshouting and swearing, and keeping such a hullabaloo, that the rocks all\nround the valley rang, and my heart quaked, so (what with this and\nthe cold) that the water began to gurgle round me, and to lap upon the\npebbles.\n\nNeither in truth did I try to stop it, being now so desperate, between\nthe fear and the wretchedness; till I caught a glimpse of the little\nmaid, whose beauty and whose kindliness had made me yearn to be with\nher. And then I knew that for her sake I was bound to be brave and hide\nmyself. She was lying beneath a rock, thirty or forty yards from me,\nfeigning to be fast asleep, with her dress spread beautifully, and her\nhair drawn over her.\n\nPresently one of the great rough men came round a corner upon her; and\nthere he stopped and gazed awhile at her fairness and her innocence.\nThen he caught her up in his arms, and kissed her so that I heard him;\nand if I had only brought my gun, I would have tried to shoot him.\n\n\"Here our queen is! Here's the queen, here's the captain's daughter!\"\nhe shouted to his comrades; \"fast asleep, by God, and hearty! Now I have\nfirst claim to her; and no one else shall touch the child. Back to the\nbottle, all of you!\"\n\nHe set her dainty little form upon his great square shoulder, and her\nnarrow feet in one broad hand; and so in triumph marched away, with the\npurple velvet of her skirt ruffling in his long black beard, and the\nsilken length of her hair fetched out, like a cloud by the wind behind\nher. This way of her going vexed me so, that I leaped upright in the\nwater, and must have been spied by some of them, but for their haste to\nthe wine-bottle. Of their little queen they took small notice, being in\nthis urgency; although they had thought to find her drowned; but trooped\naway after one another with kindly challenge to gambling, so far as I\ncould make them out; and I kept sharp watch, I assure you.\n\nGoing up that darkened glen, little Lorna, riding still the largest and\nmost fierce of them, turned and put up a hand to me, and I put up a hand\nto her, in the thick of the mist and the willows.\n\nShe was gone, my little dear (though tall of her age and healthy); and\nwhen I got over my thriftless fright, I longed to have more to say to\nher. Her voice to me was so different from all I had ever heard before,\nas might be a sweet silver bell intoned to the small chords of a harp.\nBut I had no time to think about this, if I hoped to have any supper.\n\nI crept into a bush for warmth, and rubbed my shivering legs on\nbark, and longed for mother's fagot. Then as daylight sank below the\nforget-me-not of stars, with a sorrow to be quit, I knew that now must\nbe my time to get away, if there were any.\n\nTherefore, wringing my sodden breaches, I managed to crawl from the bank\nto the niche in the cliff which Lorna had shown me.\n\nThrough the dusk I had trouble to see the mouth, at even the five\nland-yards of distance; nevertheless, I entered well, and held on by\nsome dead fern-stems, and did hope that no one would shoot me.\n\nBut while I was hugging myself like this, with a boyish manner of\nreasoning, my joy was like to have ended in sad grief both to myself\nand my mother, and haply to all honest folk who shall love to read\nthis history. For hearing a noise in front of me, and like a coward not\nknowing where, but afraid to turn round or think of it, I felt myself\ngoing down some deep passage into a pit of darkness. It was no good to\ncatch the sides, the whole thing seemed to go with me. Then, without\nknowing how, I was leaning over a night of water.\n\nThis water was of black radiance, as are certain diamonds, spanned\nacross with vaults of rock, and carrying no image, neither showing marge\nnor end, but centred (at it might be) with a bottomless indrawal.\n\nWith that chill and dread upon me, and the sheer rock all around, and\nthe faint light heaving wavily on the silence of this gulf, I must have\nlost my wits and gone to the bottom, if there were any.\n\nBut suddenly a robin sang (as they will do after dark, towards spring)\nin the brown fern and ivy behind me. I took it for our little Annie's\nvoice (for she could call any robin), and gathering quick warm comfort,\nsprang up the steep way towards the starlight. Climbing back, as the\nstones glid down, I heard the cold greedy wave go japping, like a blind\nblack dog, into the distance of arches and hollow depths of darkness.\n\n[Illustration: 069.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME\n\n[Illustration: 070.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nI can assure you, and tell no lie (as John Fry always used to say, when\ntelling his very largest), that I scrambled back to the mouth of that\npit as if the evil one had been after me. And sorely I repented now of\nall my boyish folly, or madness it might well be termed, in venturing,\nwith none to help, and nothing to compel me, into that accursed valley.\nOnce let me get out, thinks I, and if ever I get in again, without being\ncast in by neck and by crop, I will give our new-born donkey leave to\nset up for my schoolmaster.\n\nHow I kept that resolution we shall see hereafter. It is enough for me\nnow to tell how I escaped from the den that night. First I sat down\nin the little opening which Lorna had pointed out to me, and wondered\nwhether she had meant, as bitterly occurred to me, that I should run\ndown into the pit, and be drowned, and give no more trouble. But in less\nthan half a minute I was ashamed of that idea, and remembered how she\nwas vexed to think that even a loach should lose his life. And then\nI said to myself, \"Now surely she would value me more than a thousand\nloaches; and what she said must be quite true about the way out of this\nhorrible place.\"\n\nTherefore I began to search with the utmost care and diligence, although\nmy teeth were chattering, and all my bones beginning to ache with the\nchilliness and the wetness. Before very long the moon appeared, over the\nedge of the mountain, and among the trees at the top of it; and then I\nespied rough steps, and rocky, made as if with a sledge-hammer, narrow,\nsteep, and far asunder, scooped here and there in the side of the\nentrance, and then round a bulge of the cliff, like the marks upon a\ngreat brown loaf, where a hungry child has picked at it. And higher\nup, where the light of the moon shone broader upon the precipice, there\nseemed to be a rude broken track, like the shadow of a crooked stick\nthrown upon a house-wall.\n\nHerein was small encouragement; and at first I was minded to lie down\nand die; but it seemed to come amiss to me. God has His time for all\nof us; but He seems to advertise us when He does not mean to do it.\nMoreover, I saw a movement of lights at the head of the valley, as if\nlanthorns were coming after me, and the nimbleness given thereon to my\nheels was in front of all meditation.\n\nStraightway I set foot in the lowest stirrup (as I might almost call\nit), and clung to the rock with my nails, and worked to make a jump into\nthe second stirrup. And I compassed that too, with the aid of my stick;\nalthough, to tell you the truth, I was not at that time of life so agile\nas boys of smaller frame are, for my size was growing beyond my years,\nand the muscles not keeping time with it, and the joints of my bones not\nclosely hinged, with staring at one another. But the third step-hole was\nthe hardest of all, and the rock swelled out on me over my breast, and\nthere seemed to be no attempting it, until I espied a good stout rope\nhanging in a groove of shadow, and just managed to reach the end of it.\n\nHow I clomb up, and across the clearing, and found my way home through\nthe Bagworthy forest, is more than I can remember now, for I took all\nthe rest of it then as a dream, by reason of perfect weariness. And\nindeed it was quite beyond my hopes to tell so much as I have told, for\nat first beginning to set it down, it was all like a mist before me.\nNevertheless, some parts grew clearer, as one by one I remembered them,\nhaving taken a little soft cordial, because the memory frightens me.\n\nFor the toil of the water, and danger of labouring up the long cascade\nor rapids, and then the surprise of the fair young maid, and terror of\nthe murderers, and desperation of getting away--all these are much to\nme even now, when I am a stout churchwarden, and sit by the side of my\nfire, after going through many far worse adventures, which I will tell,\nGod willing. Only the labour of writing is such (especially so as to\nconstrue, and challenge a reader on parts of speech, and hope to be even\nwith him); that by this pipe which I hold in my hand I ever expect to be\nbeaten, as in the days when old Doctor Twiggs, if I made a bad stroke\nin my exercise, shouted aloud with a sour joy, \"John Ridd, sirrah, down\nwith your small-clothes!\"\n\nLet that be as it may, I deserved a good beating that night, after\nmaking such a fool of myself, and grinding good fustian to pieces. But\nwhen I got home, all the supper was in, and the men sitting at the white\ntable, and mother and Annie and Lizzie near by, all eager, and offering\nto begin (except, indeed, my mother, who was looking out at the\ndoorway), and by the fire was Betty Muxworthy, scolding, and cooking,\nand tasting her work, all in a breath, as a man would say. I looked\nthrough the door from the dark by the wood-stack, and was half of a mind\nto stay out like a dog, for fear of the rating and reckoning; but the\nway my dear mother was looking about and the browning of the sausages\ngot the better of me.\n\n[Illustration: 072.jpg John Ridd at Supper]\n\nBut nobody could get out of me where I had been all the day and evening;\nalthough they worried me never so much, and longed to shake me to\npieces, especially Betty Muxworthy, who never could learn to let well\nalone. Not that they made me tell any lies, although it would have\nserved them right almost for intruding on other people's business; but\nthat I just held my tongue, and ate my supper rarely, and let them try\ntheir taunts and jibes, and drove them almost wild after supper, by\nsmiling exceeding knowingly. And indeed I could have told them things,\nas I hinted once or twice; and then poor Betty and our little Lizzie\nwere so mad with eagerness, that between them I went into the fire,\nbeing thoroughly overcome with laughter and my own importance.\n\nNow what the working of my mind was (if, indeed it worked at all, and\ndid not rather follow suit of body) it is not in my power to say; only\nthat the result of my adventure in the Doone Glen was to make me dream\na good deal of nights, which I had never done much before, and to drive\nme, with tenfold zeal and purpose, to the practice of bullet-shooting.\nNot that I ever expected to shoot the Doone family, one by one, or even\ndesired to do so, for my nature is not revengeful; but that it seemed\nto be somehow my business to understand the gun, as a thing I must be at\nhome with.\n\nI could hit the barn-door now capitally well with the Spanish\nmatch-lock, and even with John Fry's blunderbuss, at ten good land-yards\ndistance, without any rest for my fusil. And what was very wrong of me,\nthough I did not see it then, I kept John Fry there, to praise my shots,\nfrom dinner-time often until the grey dusk, while he all the time should\nhave been at work spring-ploughing upon the farm. And for that matter so\nshould I have been, or at any rate driving the horses; but John was\nby no means loath to be there, instead of holding the plough-tail. And\nindeed, one of our old sayings is,--\n\n     \"For pleasure's sake I would liefer wet,\n      Than ha' ten lumps of gold for each one of my sweat.\"\n\nAnd again, which is not a bad proverb, though unthrifty and unlike a\nScotsman's,--\n\n     \"God makes the wheat grow greener,\n      While farmer be at his dinner.\"\n\nAnd no Devonshire man, or Somerset either (and I belong to both of\nthem), ever thinks of working harder than God likes to see him.\n\nNevertheless, I worked hard at the gun, and by the time that I had\nsent all the church-roof gutters, so far as I honestly could cut them,\nthrough the red pine-door, I began to long for a better tool that would\nmake less noise and throw straighter. But the sheep-shearing came and\nthe hay-season next, and then the harvest of small corn, and the digging\nof the root called \"batata\" (a new but good thing in our neighbourhood,\nwhich our folk have made into \"taties\"), and then the sweating of the\napples, and the turning of the cider-press, and the stacking of the\nfirewood, and netting of the woodcocks, and the springles to be\nminded in the garden and by the hedgerows, where blackbirds hop to the\nmolehills in the white October mornings, and grey birds come to look for\nsnails at the time when the sun is rising.\n\nIt is wonderful how time runs away, when all these things and a great\nmany others come in to load him down the hill and prevent him from\nstopping to look about. And I for my part can never conceive how people\nwho live in towns and cities, where neither lambs nor birds are (except\nin some shop windows), nor growing corn, nor meadow-grass, nor even so\nmuch as a stick to cut or a stile to climb and sit down upon--how these\npoor folk get through their lives without being utterly weary of them,\nand dying from pure indolence, is a thing God only knows, if His mercy\nallows Him to think of it.\n\nHow the year went by I know not, only that I was abroad all day,\nshooting, or fishing, or minding the farm, or riding after some stray\nbeast, or away by the seaside below Glenthorne, wondering at the great\nwaters, and resolving to go for a sailor. For in those days I had a firm\nbelief, as many other strong boys have, of being born for a seaman. And\nindeed I had been in a boat nearly twice; but the second time mother\nfound it out, and came and drew me back again; and after that she cried\nso badly, that I was forced to give my word to her to go no more without\ntelling her.\n\nBut Betty Muxworthy spoke her mind quite in a different way about it,\nthe while she was wringing my hosen, and clattering to the drying-horse.\n\n\"Zailor, ees fai! ay and zarve un raight. Her can't kape out o' the\nwatter here, whur a' must goo vor to vaind un, zame as a gurt to-ad\nsqualloping, and mux up till I be wore out, I be, wi' the very saight of\n's braiches. How wil un ever baide aboard zhip, wi' the watter zinging\nout under un, and comin' up splash when the wind blow. Latt un goo,\nmissus, latt un goo, zay I for wan, and old Davy wash his clouts for\nun.\"\n\nAnd this discourse of Betty's tended more than my mother's prayers,\nI fear, to keep me from going. For I hated Betty in those days, as\nchildren always hate a cross servant, and often get fond of a false\none. But Betty, like many active women, was false by her crossness only;\nthinking it just for the moment perhaps, and rushing away with a bucket;\nready to stick to it, like a clenched nail, if beaten the wrong way with\nargument; but melting over it, if you left her, as stinging soap, left\nalong in a basin, spreads all abroad without bubbling.\n\nBut all this is beyond the children, and beyond me too for that matter,\neven now in ripe experience; for I never did know what women mean, and\nnever shall except when they tell me, if that be in their power. Now let\nthat question pass. For although I am now in a place of some authority,\nI have observed that no one ever listens to me, when I attempt to lay\ndown the law; but all are waiting with open ears until I do enforce it.\nAnd so methinks he who reads a history cares not much for the wisdom or\nfolly of the writer (knowing well that the former is far less than his\nown, and the latter vastly greater), but hurries to know what the people\ndid, and how they got on about it. And this I can tell, if any one can,\nhaving been myself in the thick of it.\n\nThe fright I had taken that night in Glen Doone satisfied me for a long\ntime thereafter; and I took good care not to venture even in the fields\nand woods of the outer farm, without John Fry for company. John was\ngreatly surprised and pleased at the value I now set upon him; until,\nwhat betwixt the desire to vaunt and the longing to talk things over,\nI gradually laid bare to him nearly all that had befallen me; except,\nindeed, about Lorna, whom a sort of shame kept me from mentioning. Not\nthat I did not think of her, and wish very often to see her again; but\nof course I was only a boy as yet, and therefore inclined to despise\nyoung girls, as being unable to do anything, and only meant to listen to\norders. And when I got along with the other boys, that was how we always\nspoke of them, if we deigned to speak at all, as beings of a lower\norder, only good enough to run errands for us, and to nurse boy-babies.\n\nAnd yet my sister Annie was in truth a great deal more to me than all\nthe boys of the parish, and of Brendon, and Countisbury, put together;\nalthough at the time I never dreamed it, and would have laughed if told\nso. Annie was of a pleasing face, and very gentle manner, almost like\na lady some people said; but without any airs whatever, only trying to\ngive satisfaction. And if she failed, she would go and weep, without\nletting any one know it, believing the fault to be all her own, when\nmostly it was of others. But if she succeeded in pleasing you, it was\nbeautiful to see her smile, and stroke her soft chin in a way of her\nown, which she always used when taking note how to do the right thing\nagain for you. And then her cheeks had a bright clear pink, and her eyes\nwere as blue as the sky in spring, and she stood as upright as a young\napple-tree, and no one could help but smile at her, and pat her brown\ncurls approvingly; whereupon she always curtseyed. For she never tried\nto look away when honest people gazed at her; and even in the court-yard\nshe would come and help to take your saddle, and tell (without your\nasking her) what there was for dinner.\n\nAnd afterwards she grew up to be a very comely maiden, tall, and with a\nwell-built neck, and very fair white shoulders, under a bright cloud\nof curling hair. Alas! poor Annie, like most of the gentle maidens--but\ntush, I am not come to that yet; and for the present she seemed to me\nlittle to look at, after the beauty of Lorna Doone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA BRAVE RESCUE AND A ROUGH RIDE\n\n[Illustration: 077.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nIt happened upon a November evening (when I was about fifteen years old,\nand out-growing my strength very rapidly, my sister Annie being turned\nthirteen, and a deal of rain having fallen, and all the troughs in the\nyard being flooded, and the bark from the wood-ricks washed down the\ngutters, and even our water-shoot going brown) that the ducks in the\ncourt made a terrible quacking, instead of marching off to their pen,\none behind another. Thereupon Annie and I ran out to see what might be\nthe sense of it. There were thirteen ducks, and ten lily-white (as the\nfashion then of ducks was), not I mean twenty-three in all, but ten\nwhite and three brown-striped ones; and without being nice about their\ncolour, they all quacked very movingly. They pushed their gold-coloured\nbills here and there (yet dirty, as gold is apt to be), and they jumped\non the triangles of their feet, and sounded out of their nostrils; and\nsome of the over-excited ones ran along low on the ground, quacking\ngrievously with their bills snapping and bending, and the roof of their\nmouths exhibited.\n\nAnnie began to cry \"Dilly, dilly, einy, einy, ducksey,\" according to\nthe burden of a tune they seem to have accepted as the national duck's\nanthem; but instead of being soothed by it, they only quacked three\ntimes as hard, and ran round till we were giddy. And then they shook\ntheir tails together, and looked grave, and went round and round\nagain. Now I am uncommonly fond of ducks, both roasted and roasting and\nroystering; and it is a fine sight to behold them walk, poddling one\nafter other, with their toes out, like soldiers drilling, and their\nlittle eyes cocked all ways at once, and the way that they dib with\ntheir bills, and dabble, and throw up their heads and enjoy something,\nand then tell the others about it. Therefore I knew at once, by the way\nthey were carrying on, that there must be something or other gone wholly\namiss in the duck-world. Sister Annie perceived it too, but with a\ngreater quickness; for she counted them like a good duck-wife, and could\nonly tell thirteen of them, when she knew there ought to be fourteen.\n\nAnd so we began to search about, and the ducks ran to lead us aright,\nhaving come that far to fetch us; and when we got down to the foot of\nthe court-yard where the two great ash-trees stand by the side of the\nlittle water, we found good reason for the urgency and melancholy of the\nduck-birds. Lo! the old white drake, the father of all, a bird of high\nmanners and chivalry, always the last to help himself from the pan of\nbarley-meal, and the first to show fight to a dog or cock intruding upon\nhis family, this fine fellow, and pillar of the state, was now in a sad\npredicament, yet quacking very stoutly. For the brook, wherewith he\nhad been familiar from his callow childhood, and wherein he was wont to\nquest for water-newts, and tadpoles, and caddis-worms, and other game,\nthis brook, which afforded him very often scanty space to dabble in,\nand sometimes starved the cresses, was now coming down in a great brown\nflood, as if the banks never belonged to it. The foaming of it, and the\nnoise, and the cresting of the corners, and the up and down, like a wave\nof the sea, were enough to frighten any duck, though bred upon stormy\nwaters, which our ducks never had been.\n\nThere is always a hurdle six feet long and four and a half in depth,\nswung by a chain at either end from an oak laid across the channel. And\nthe use of this hurdle is to keep our kine at milking time from straying\naway there drinking (for in truth they are very dainty) and to fence\nstrange cattle, or Farmer Snowe's horses, from coming along the bed of\nthe brook unknown, to steal our substance. But now this hurdle, which\nhung in the summer a foot above the trickle, would have been dipped more\nthan two feet deep but for the power against it. For the torrent came\ndown so vehemently that the chains at full stretch were creaking, and\nthe hurdle buffeted almost flat, and thatched (so to say) with the\ndrift-stuff, was going see-saw, with a sulky splash on the dirty red\ncomb of the waters. But saddest to see was between two bars, where a\nfog was of rushes, and flood-wood, and wild-celery haulm, and dead\ncrowsfoot, who but our venerable mallard jammed in by the joint of his\nshoulder, speaking aloud as he rose and fell, with his top-knot full of\nwater, unable to comprehend it, with his tail washed far away from him,\nbut often compelled to be silent, being ducked very harshly against his\nwill by the choking fall-to of the hurdle.\n\nFor a moment I could not help laughing, because, being borne up high and\ndry by a tumult of the torrent, he gave me a look from his one little\neye (having lost one in fight with the turkey-cock), a gaze of appealing\nsorrow, and then a loud quack to second it. But the quack came out of\ntime, I suppose, for his throat got filled with water, as the hurdle\ncarried him back again. And then there was scarcely the screw of his\ntail to be seen until he swung up again, and left small doubt by the\nway he sputtered, and failed to quack, and hung down his poor crest, but\nwhat he must drown in another minute, and frogs triumph over his body.\n\nAnnie was crying, and wringing her hands, and I was about to rush into\nthe water, although I liked not the look of it, but hoped to hold on by\nthe hurdle, when a man on horseback came suddenly round the corner of\nthe great ash-hedge on the other side of the stream, and his horse's\nfeet were in the water.\n\n\"Ho, there,\" he cried; \"get thee back, boy. The flood will carry thee\ndown like a straw. I will do it for thee, and no trouble.\"\n\n[Illustration: 079.jpg A Brave Rescue]\n\nWith that he leaned forward, and spoke to his mare--she was just of the\ntint of a strawberry, a young thing, very beautiful--and she arched up\nher neck, as misliking the job; yet, trusting him, would attempt it. She\nentered the flood, with her dainty fore-legs sloped further and further\nin front of her, and her delicate ears pricked forward, and the size of\nher great eyes increasing, but he kept her straight in the turbid rush,\nby the pressure of his knee on her. Then she looked back, and wondered\nat him, as the force of the torrent grew stronger, but he bade her go\non; and on she went, and it foamed up over her shoulders; and she tossed\nup her lip and scorned it, for now her courage was waking. Then as the\nrush of it swept her away, and she struck with her forefeet down the\nstream, he leaned from his saddle in a manner which I never could have\nthought possible, and caught up old Tom with his left hand, and set him\nbetween his holsters, and smiled at his faint quack of gratitude. In a\nmoment all these were carried downstream, and the rider lay flat on his\nhorse, and tossed the hurdle clear from him, and made for the bend of\nsmooth water.\n\nThey landed some thirty or forty yards lower, in the midst of our\nkitchen-garden, where the winter-cabbage was; but though Annie and I\ncrept in through the hedge, and were full of our thanks and admiring\nhim, he would answer us never a word, until he had spoken in full to the\nmare, as if explaining the whole to her.\n\n\"Sweetheart, I know thou couldst have leaped it,\" he said, as he patted\nher cheek, being on the ground by this time, and she was nudging up to\nhim, with the water pattering off her; \"but I had good reason, Winnie\ndear, for making thee go through it.\"\n\nShe answered him kindly with her soft eyes, and smiled at him very\nlovingly, and they understood one another. Then he took from his\nwaistcoat two peppercorns, and made the old drake swallow them, and\ntried him softly upon his legs, where the leading gap in the hedge was.\nOld Tom stood up quite bravely, and clapped his wings, and shook off the\nwet from his tail-feathers; and then away into the court-yard, and his\nfamily gathered around him, and they all made a noise in their throats,\nand stood up, and put their bills together, to thank God for this great\ndeliverance.\n\nHaving taken all this trouble, and watched the end of that adventure,\nthe gentleman turned round to us with a pleasant smile on his face, as\nif he were lightly amused with himself; and we came up and looked at\nhim. He was rather short, about John Fry's height, or may be a little\ntaller, but very strongly built and springy, as his gait at every step\nshowed plainly, although his legs were bowed with much riding, and he\nlooked as if he lived on horseback. To a boy like me he seemed very old,\nbeing over twenty, and well-found in beard; but he was not more than\nfour-and-twenty, fresh and ruddy looking, with a short nose and keen\nblue eyes, and a merry waggish jerk about him, as if the world were not\nin earnest. Yet he had a sharp, stern way, like the crack of a pistol,\nif anything misliked him; and we knew (for children see such things)\nthat it was safer to tickle than tackle him.\n\n[Illustration: 081.jpg Tom Faggus]\n\n\"Well, young uns, what be gaping at?\" He gave pretty Annie a chuck on\nthe chin, and took me all in without winking.\n\n\"Your mare,\" said I, standing stoutly up, being a tall boy now; \"I never\nsaw such a beauty, sir. Will you let me have a ride of her?\"\n\n\"Think thou couldst ride her, lad? She will have no burden but mine.\nThou couldst never ride her. Tut! I would be loath to kill thee.\"\n\n\"Ride her!\" I cried with the bravest scorn, for she looked so kind and\ngentle; \"there never was horse upon Exmoor foaled, but I could tackle in\nhalf an hour. Only I never ride upon saddle. Take them leathers off of\nher.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a dry little whistle, and thrust his hands into his\nbreeches-pockets, and so grinned that I could not stand it. And Annie\nlaid hold of me in such a way that I was almost mad with her. And he\nlaughed, and approved her for doing so. And the worst of all was--he\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Get away, Annie, will you? Do you think I'm a fool, good sir! Only\ntrust me with her, and I will not override her.\"\n\n\"For that I will go bail, my son. She is liker to override thee. But the\nground is soft to fall upon, after all this rain. Now come out into the\nyard, young man, for the sake of your mother's cabbages. And the mellow\nstraw-bed will be softer for thee, since pride must have its fall. I\nam thy mother's cousin, boy, and am going up to house. Tom Faggus is my\nname, as everybody knows; and this is my young mare, Winnie.\"\n\nWhat a fool I must have been not to know it at once! Tom Faggus, the\ngreat highwayman, and his young blood-mare, the strawberry! Already her\nfame was noised abroad, nearly as much as her master's; and my longing\nto ride her grew tenfold, but fear came at the back of it. Not that I\nhad the smallest fear of what the mare could do to me, by fair play and\nhorse-trickery, but that the glory of sitting upon her seemed to be too\ngreat for me; especially as there were rumours abroad that she was not a\nmare after all, but a witch. However, she looked like a filly all over,\nand wonderfully beautiful, with her supple stride, and soft slope of\nshoulder, and glossy coat beaded with water, and prominent eyes full of\ndocile fire. Whether this came from her Eastern blood of the Arabs newly\nimported, and whether the cream-colour, mixed with our bay, led to\nthat bright strawberry tint, is certainly more than I can decide, being\nchiefly acquaint with farm-horses. And these come of any colour and\nform; you never can count what they will be, and are lucky to get four\nlegs to them.\n\nMr. Faggus gave his mare a wink, and she walked demurely after him, a\nbright young thing, flowing over with life, yet dropping her soul to a\nhigher one, and led by love to anything; as the manner is of females,\nwhen they know what is the best for them. Then Winnie trod lightly upon\nthe straw, because it had soft muck under it, and her delicate feet came\nback again.\n\n\"Up for it still, boy, be ye?\" Tom Faggus stopped, and the mare stopped\nthere; and they looked at me provokingly.\n\n\"Is she able to leap, sir? There is good take-off on this side of the\nbrook.\"\n\nMr. Faggus laughed very quietly, turning round to Winnie so that she\nmight enter into it. And she, for her part, seemed to know exactly where\nthe fun lay.\n\n\"Good tumble-off, you mean, my boy. Well, there can be small harm to\nthee. I am akin to thy family, and know the substance of their skulls.\"\n\n\"Let me get up,\" said I, waxing wroth, for reasons I cannot tell you,\nbecause they are too manifold; \"take off your saddle-bag things. I will\ntry not to squeeze her ribs in, unless she plays nonsense with me.\"\n\n[Illustration: 083.jpg Bill Dadds]\n\nThen Mr. Faggus was up on his mettle, at this proud speech of mine; and\nJohn Fry was running up all the while, and Bill Dadds, and half a dozen.\nTom Faggus gave one glance around, and then dropped all regard for me.\nThe high repute of his mare was at stake, and what was my life compared\nto it? Through my defiance, and stupid ways, here was I in a duello,\nand my legs not come to their strength yet, and my arms as limp as a\nherring.\n\nSomething of this occurred to him even in his wrath with me, for he\nspoke very softly to the filly, who now could scarce subdue herself;\nbut she drew in her nostrils, and breathed to his breath and did all she\ncould to answer him.\n\n\"Not too hard, my dear,\" he said: \"led him gently down on the mixen.\nThat will be quite enough.\" Then he turned the saddle off, and I was\nup in a moment. She began at first so easily, and pricked her ears so\nlovingly, and minced about as if pleased to find so light a weight upon\nher, that I thought she knew I could ride a little, and feared to show\nany capers. \"Gee wug, Polly!\" cried I, for all the men were now looking\non, being then at the leaving-off time: \"Gee wug, Polly, and show what\nthou be'est made of.\" With that I plugged my heels into her, and Billy\nDadds flung his hat up.\n\nNevertheless, she outraged not, though her eyes were frightening Annie,\nand John Fry took a pick to keep him safe; but she curbed to and fro\nwith her strong forearms rising like springs ingathered, waiting and\nquivering grievously, and beginning to sweat about it. Then her master\ngave a shrill clear whistle, when her ears were bent towards him, and I\nfelt her form beneath me gathering up like whalebone, and her hind-legs\ncoming under her, and I knew that I was in for it.\n\nFirst she reared upright in the air, and struck me full on the nose with\nher comb, till I bled worse than Robin Snell made me; and then down\nwith her fore-feet deep in the straw, and her hind-feet going to heaven.\nFinding me stick to her still like wax, for my mettle was up as hers\nwas, away she flew with me swifter than ever I went before, or since, I\ntrow. She drove full-head at the cobwall--\"Oh, Jack, slip off,\" screamed\nAnnie--then she turned like light, when I thought to crush her, and\nground my left knee against it. \"Mux me,\" I cried, for my breeches were\nbroken, and short words went the furthest--\"if you kill me, you shall\ndie with me.\" Then she took the court-yard gate at a leap, knocking my\nwords between my teeth, and then right over a quick set hedge, as if the\nsky were a breath to her; and away for the water-meadows, while I lay\non her neck like a child at the breast and wished I had never been\nborn. Straight away, all in the front of the wind, and scattering clouds\naround her, all I knew of the speed we made was the frightful flash of\nher shoulders, and her mane like trees in a tempest. I felt the earth\nunder us rushing away, and the air left far behind us, and my breath\ncame and went, and I prayed to God, and was sorry to be so late of it.\n\n[Illustration: 084.jpg A Rough Ride]\n\nAll the long swift while, without power of thought, I clung to her crest\nand shoulders, and dug my nails into her creases, and my toes into her\nflank-part, and was proud of holding on so long, though sure of being\nbeaten. Then in her fury at feeling me still, she rushed at another\ndevice for it, and leaped the wide water-trough sideways across, to and\nfro, till no breath was left in me. The hazel-boughs took me too hard\nin the face, and the tall dog-briers got hold of me, and the ache of\nmy back was like crimping a fish; till I longed to give up, thoroughly\nbeaten, and lie there and die in the cresses. But there came a shrill\nwhistle from up the home-hill, where the people had hurried to watch us;\nand the mare stopped as if with a bullet, then set off for home with\nthe speed of a swallow, and going as smoothly and silently. I never had\ndreamed of such delicate motion, fluent, and graceful, and ambient,\nsoft as the breeze flitting over the flowers, but swift as the summer\nlightning. I sat up again, but my strength was all spent, and no time\nleft to recover it, and though she rose at our gate like a bird, I\ntumbled off into the mixen.\n\n[Illustration: 085.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTOM DESERVES HIS SUPPER\n\n[Illustration: 086.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\n\"Well done, lad,\" Mr. Faggus said good naturedly; for all were now\ngathered round me, as I rose from the ground, somewhat tottering, and\nmiry, and crest-fallen, but otherwise none the worse (having fallen\nupon my head, which is of uncommon substance); nevertheless John Fry was\nlaughing, so that I longed to clout his ears for him; \"Not at all bad\nwork, my boy; we may teach you to ride by-and-by, I see; I thought not\nto see you stick on so long--\"\n\n\"I should have stuck on much longer, sir, if her sides had not been wet.\nShe was so slippery--\"\n\n\"Boy, thou art right. She hath given many the slip. Ha, ha! Vex not,\nJack, that I laugh at thee. She is like a sweetheart to me, and better,\nthan any of them be. It would have gone to my heart if thou hadst\nconquered. None but I can ride my Winnie mare.\"\n\n\"Foul shame to thee then, Tom Faggus,\" cried mother, coming up suddenly,\nand speaking so that all were amazed, having never seen her wrathful;\n\"to put my boy, my boy, across her, as if his life were no more than\nthine! The only son of his father, an honest man, and a quiet man, not\na roystering drunken robber! A man would have taken thy mad horse and\nthee, and flung them both into horse-pond--ay, and what's more, I'll\nhave it done now, if a hair of his head is injured. Oh, my boy, my boy!\nWhat could I do without thee? Put up the other arm, Johnny.\" All the\ntime mother was scolding so, she was feeling me, and wiping me; while\nFaggus tried to look greatly ashamed, having sense of the ways of women.\n\n\"Only look at his jacket, mother!\" cried Annie; \"and a shillingsworth\ngone from his small-clothes!\"\n\n\"What care I for his clothes, thou goose? Take that, and heed thine own\na bit.\" And mother gave Annie a slap which sent her swinging up against\nMr. Faggus, and he caught her, and kissed and protected her, and she\nlooked at him very nicely, with great tears in her soft blue eyes. \"Oh,\nfie upon thee, fie upon thee!\" cried mother (being yet more vexed with\nhim, because she had beaten Annie); \"after all we have done for thee,\nand saved thy worthless neck--and to try to kill my son for me! Never\nmore shall horse of thine enter stable here, since these be thy returns\nto me. Small thanks to you, John Fry, I say, and you Bill Dadds, and you\nJem Slocomb, and all the rest of your coward lot; much you care for your\nmaster's son! Afraid of that ugly beast yourselves, and you put a boy\njust breeched upon him!\"\n\n\"Wull, missus, what could us do?\" began John; \"Jan wudd goo, now wudd't\nher, Jem? And how was us--\"\n\n\"Jan indeed! Master John, if you please, to a lad of his years and\nstature. And now, Tom Faggus, be off, if you please, and think yourself\nlucky to go so; and if ever that horse comes into our yard, I'll\nhamstring him myself if none of my cowards dare do it.\"\n\nEverybody looked at mother, to hear her talk like that, knowing how\nquiet she was day by day and how pleasant to be cheated. And the men\nbegan to shoulder their shovels, both so as to be away from her, and\nto go and tell their wives of it. Winnie too was looking at her, being\npointed at so much, and wondering if she had done amiss. And then she\ncame to me, and trembled, and stooped her head, and asked my pardon, if\nshe had been too proud with me.\n\n\"Winnie shall stop here to-night,\" said I, for Tom Faggus still said\nnever a word all the while; but began to buckle his things on, for he\nknew that women are to be met with wool, as the cannon-balls were at the\nsiege of Tiverton Castle; \"mother, I tell you, Winnie shall stop; else\nI will go away with her, I never knew what it was, till now, to ride a\nhorse worth riding.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said Tom Faggus, still preparing sternly to depart, \"you\nknow more about a horse than any man on Exmoor. Your mother may well be\nproud of you, but she need have had no fear. As if I, Tom Faggus, your\nfather's cousin--and the only thing I am proud of--would ever have let\nyou mount my mare, which dukes and princes have vainly sought, except\nfor the courage in your eyes, and the look of your father about you. I\nknew you could ride when I saw you, and rarely you have conquered. But\nwomen don't understand us. Good-bye, John; I am proud of you, and I\nhoped to have done you pleasure. And indeed I came full of some courtly\ntales, that would have made your hair stand up. But though not a crust\nhave I tasted since this time yesterday, having given my meat to a\nwidow, I will go and starve on the moor far sooner than eat the best\nsupper that ever was cooked, in a place that has forgotten me.\" With\nthat he fetched a heavy sigh, as if it had been for my father; and\nfeebly got upon Winnie's back, and she came to say farewell to me. He\nlifted his hat to my mother, with a glance of sorrow, but never a word;\nand to me he said, \"Open the gate, Cousin John, if you please. You have\nbeaten her so, that she cannot leap it, poor thing.\"\n\nBut before he was truly gone out of our yard, my mother came softly\nafter him, with her afternoon apron across her eyes, and one hand ready\nto offer him. Nevertheless, he made as if he had not seen her, though he\nlet his horse go slowly.\n\n\"Stop, Cousin Tom,\" my mother said, \"a word with you, before you go.\"\n\n\"Why, bless my heart!\" Tom Faggus cried, with the form of his\ncountenance so changed, that I verily thought another man must have\nleaped into his clothes--\"do I see my Cousin Sarah? I thought every one\nwas ashamed of me, and afraid to offer me shelter, since I lost my best\ncousin, John Ridd. 'Come here,' he used to say, 'Tom, come here, when\nyou are worried, and my wife shall take good care of you.' 'Yes, dear\nJohn,' I used to answer, 'I know she promised my mother so; but people\nhave taken to think against me, and so might Cousin Sarah.' Ah, he was a\nman, a man! If you only heard how he answered me. But let that go, I am\nnothing now, since the day I lost Cousin Ridd.\" And with that he began\nto push on again; but mother would not have it so.\n\n\"Oh, Tom, that was a loss indeed. And I am nothing either. And you\nshould try to allow for me; though I never found any one that did.\" And\nmother began to cry, though father had been dead so long; and I looked\non with a stupid surprise, having stopped from crying long ago.\n\n\"I can tell you one that will,\" cried Tom, jumping off Winnie, in a\ntrice, and looking kindly at mother; \"I can allow for you, Cousin Sarah,\nin everything but one. I am in some ways a bad man myself; but I know\nthe value of a good one; and if you gave me orders, by God--\" And he\nshook his fists towards Bagworthy Wood, just heaving up black in the\nsundown.\n\n\"Hush, Tom, hush, for God's sake!\" And mother meant me, without pointing\nat me; at least I thought she did. For she ever had weaned me from\nthoughts of revenge, and even from longings for judgment. \"God knows\nbest, boy,\" she used to say, \"let us wait His time, without wishing\nit.\" And so, to tell the truth, I did; partly through her teaching, and\npartly through my own mild temper, and my knowledge that father, after\nall, was killed because he had thrashed them.\n\n\"Good-night, Cousin Sarah, good-night, Cousin Jack,\" cried Tom, taking\nto the mare again; \"many a mile I have to ride, and not a bit inside of\nme. No food or shelter this side of Exeford, and the night will be black\nas pitch, I trow. But it serves me right for indulging the lad, being\ntaken with his looks so.\"\n\n\"Cousin Tom,\" said mother, and trying to get so that Annie and I could\nnot hear her; \"it would be a sad and unkinlike thing for you to despise\nour dwelling-house. We cannot entertain you, as the lordly inns on the\nroad do; and we have small change of victuals. But the men will go home,\nbeing Saturday; and so you will have the fireside all to yourself and\nthe children. There are some few collops of red deer's flesh, and a ham\njust down from the chimney, and some dried salmon from Lynmouth weir,\nand cold roast-pig, and some oysters. And if none of those be to your\nliking, we could roast two woodcocks in half an hour, and Annie would\nmake the toast for them. And the good folk made some mistake last week,\ngoing up the country, and left a keg of old Holland cordial in the\ncoving of the wood-rick, having borrowed our Smiler, without asking\nleave. I fear there is something unrighteous about it. But what can a\npoor widow do? John Fry would have taken it, but for our Jack. Our Jack\nwas a little too sharp for him.\"\n\nAy, that I was; John Fry had got it, like a billet under his apron,\ngoing away in the gray of the morning, as if to kindle his fireplace.\n\"Why, John,\" I said, \"what a heavy log! Let me have one end of it.\"\n\"Thank'e, Jan, no need of thiccy,\" he answered, turning his back to\nme; \"waife wanteth a log as will last all day, to kape the crock a\nzimmerin.\" And he banged his gate upon my heels to make me stop and rub\nthem. \"Why, John,\" said I, \"you'm got a log with round holes in the end\nof it. Who has been cutting gun-wads? Just lift your apron, or I will.\"\n\nBut, to return to Tom Faggus--he stopped to sup that night with us, and\ntook a little of everything; a few oysters first, and then dried salmon,\nand then ham and eggs, done in small curled rashers, and then a few\ncollops of venison toasted, and next to that a little cold roast-pig,\nand a woodcock on toast to finish with, before the Scheidam and hot\nwater. And having changed his wet things first, he seemed to be in fair\nappetite, and praised Annie's cooking mightily, with a kind of noise\nlike a smack of his lips, and a rubbing of his hands together, whenever\nhe could spare them.\n\nHe had gotten John Fry's best small-clothes on, for he said he was not\ngood enough to go into my father's (which mother kept to look at), nor\nman enough to fill them. And in truth my mother was very glad that he\nrefused, when I offered them. But John was over-proud to have it in his\npower to say that such a famous man had ever dwelt in any clothes of\nhis; and afterwards he made show of them. For Mr. Faggus's glory, then,\nthough not so great as now it is, was spreading very fast indeed all\nabout our neighbourhood, and even as far as Bridgewater.\n\nTom Faggus was a jovial soul, if ever there has been one, not making\nbones of little things, nor caring to seek evil. There was about him\nsuch a love of genuine human nature, that if a traveller said a good\nthing, he would give him back his purse again. It is true that he took\npeople's money more by force than fraud; and the law (being used to the\ninverse method) was bitterly moved against him, although he could quote\nprecedent. These things I do not understand; having seen so much of\nrobbery (some legal, some illegal), that I scarcely know, as here we\nsay, one crow's foot from the other. It is beyond me and above me, to\ndiscuss these subjects; and in truth I love the law right well, when it\ndoth support me, and when I can lay it down to my liking, with prejudice\nto nobody. Loyal, too, to the King am I, as behoves churchwarden; and\nready to make the best of him, as he generally requires. But after\nall, I could not see (until I grew much older, and came to have some\nproperty) why Tom Faggus, working hard, was called a robber and felon of\ngreat; while the King, doing nothing at all (as became his dignity), was\nliege-lord, and paramount owner; with everybody to thank him kindly for\naccepting tribute.\n\nFor the present, however, I learned nothing more as to what our cousin's\nprofession was; only that mother seemed frightened, and whispered to\nhim now and then not to talk of something, because of the children being\nthere; whereupon he always nodded with a sage expression, and applied\nhimself to hollands.\n\n\"Now let us go and see Winnie, Jack,\" he said to me after supper; \"for\nthe most part I feed her before myself; but she was so hot from the\nway you drove her. Now she must be grieving for me, and I never let her\ngrieve long.\"\n\nI was too glad to go with him, and Annie came slyly after us. The filly\nwas walking to and fro on the naked floor of the stable (for he would\nnot let her have any straw, until he should make a bed for her), and\nwithout so much as a headstall on, for he would not have her fastened.\n\"Do you take my mare for a dog?\" he had said when John Fry brought him a\nhalter. And now she ran to him like a child, and her great eyes shone at\nthe lanthorn.\n\n\"Hit me, Jack, and see what she will do. I will not let her hurt thee.\"\nHe was rubbing her ears all the time he spoke, and she was leaning\nagainst him. Then I made believe to strike him, and in a moment she\ncaught me by the waistband, and lifted me clean from the ground, and was\ncasting me down to trample upon me, when he stopped her suddenly.\n\n\"What think you of that, boy? Have you horse or dog that would do that\nfor you? Ay, and more than that she will do. If I were to whistle,\nby-and-by, in the tone that tells my danger, she would break this\nstable-door down, and rush into the room to me. Nothing will keep her\nfrom me then, stone-wall or church-tower. Ah, Winnie, Winnie, you little\nwitch, we shall die together.\"\n\nThen he turned away with a joke, and began to feed her nicely, for she\nwas very dainty. Not a husk of oat would she touch that had been under\nthe breath of another horse, however hungry she might be. And with her\noats he mixed some powder, fetching it from his saddle-bags. What this\nwas I could not guess, neither would he tell me, but laughed and called\nit \"star-shavings.\" He watched her eat every morsel of it, with two or\nthree drinks of pure water, ministered between whiles; and then he made\nher bed in a form I had never seen before, and so we said \"Good-night\"\nto her.\n\nAfterwards by the fireside he kept us very merry, sitting in the great\nchimney-corner, and making us play games with him. And all the while he\nwas smoking tobacco in a manner I never had seen before, not using any\npipe for it, but having it rolled in little sticks about as long as my\nfinger, blunt at one end and sharp at the other. The sharp end he would\nput in his mouth, and lay a brand of wood to the other, and then draw\na white cloud of curling smoke, and we never tired of watching him. I\nwanted him to let me do it, but he said, \"No, my son; it is not meant\nfor boys.\" Then Annie put up her lips and asked, with both hands on his\nknees (for she had taken to him wonderfully), \"Is it meant for girls\nthen cousin Tom?\" But she had better not have asked, for he gave it her\nto try, and she shut both eyes, and sucked at it. One breath, however,\nwas quite enough, for it made her cough so violently that Lizzie and\nI must thump her back until she was almost crying. To atone for that,\ncousin Tom set to, and told us whole pages of stories, not about his own\ndoings at all, but strangely enough they seemed to concern almost every\none else we had ever heard of. Without halting once for a word or a\ndeed, his tales flowed onward as freely and brightly as the flames of\nthe wood up the chimney, and with no smaller variety. For he spoke with\nthe voices of twenty people, giving each person the proper manner, and\nthe proper place to speak from; so that Annie and Lizzie ran all about,\nand searched the clock and the linen-press. And he changed his face\nevery moment so, and with such power of mimicry that without so much as\na smile of his own, he made even mother laugh so that she broke her new\ntenpenny waistband; and as for us children, we rolled on the floor, and\nBetty Muxworthy roared in the wash-up.\n\n[Illustration: 092.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA MAN JUSTLY POPULAR\n\n[Illustration: 093.jpg Tom Faggus]\n\nNow although Mr. Faggus was so clever, and generous, and celebrated,\nI know not whether, upon the whole, we were rather proud of him as a\nmember of our family, or inclined to be ashamed of him. And indeed I\nthink that the sway of the balance hung upon the company we were in. For\ninstance, with the boys at Brendon--for there is no village at Oare--I\nwas exceeding proud to talk of him, and would freely brag of my Cousin\nTom. But with the rich parsons of the neighbourhood, or the justices\n(who came round now and then, and were glad to ride up to a warm\nfarm-house), or even the well-to-do tradesmen of Porlock--in a word, any\nsettled power, which was afraid of losing things--with all of them we\nwere very shy of claiming our kinship to that great outlaw.\n\nAnd sure, I should pity, as well as condemn him though our ways in the\nworld were so different, knowing as I do his story; which knowledge,\nmethinks, would often lead us to let alone God's prerogative--judgment,\nand hold by man's privilege--pity. Not that I would find excuse for\nTom's downright dishonesty, which was beyond doubt a disgrace to him,\nand no credit to his kinsfolk; only that it came about without his\nmeaning any harm or seeing how he took to wrong; yet gradually knowing\nit. And now, to save any further trouble, and to meet those who\ndisparage him (without allowance for the time or the crosses laid upon\nhim), I will tell the history of him, just as if he were not my cousin,\nand hoping to be heeded. And I defy any man to say that a word of this\nis either false, or in any way coloured by family. Much cause he had\nto be harsh with the world; and yet all acknowledged him very pleasant,\nwhen a man gave up his money. And often and often he paid the toll for\nthe carriage coming after him, because he had emptied their pockets, and\nwould not add inconvenience. By trade he had been a blacksmith, in the\ntown of Northmolton, in Devonshire, a rough rude place at the end of\nExmoor, so that many people marvelled if such a man was bred there. Not\nonly could he read and write, but he had solid substance; a piece of\nland worth a hundred pounds, and right of common for two hundred sheep,\nand a score and a half of beasts, lifting up or lying down. And being\nleft an orphan (with all these cares upon him) he began to work right\nearly, and made such a fame at the shoeing of horses, that the farriers\nof Barum were like to lose their custom. And indeed he won a golden\nJacobus for the best-shod nag in the north of Devon, and some say that\nhe never was forgiven.\n\nAs to that, I know no more, except that men are jealous. But whether\nit were that, or not, he fell into bitter trouble within a month of his\nvictory; when his trade was growing upon him, and his sweetheart ready\nto marry him. For he loved a maid of Southmolton (a currier's daughter\nI think she was, and her name was Betsy Paramore), and her father had\ngiven consent; and Tom Faggus, wishing to look his best, and be clean of\ncourse, had a tailor at work upstairs for him, who had come all the way\nfrom Exeter. And Betsy's things were ready too--for which they accused\nhim afterwards, as if he could help that--when suddenly, like a\nthunderbolt, a lawyer's writ fell upon him.\n\nThis was the beginning of a law-suit with Sir Robert Bampfylde, a\ngentleman of the neighbourhood, who tried to oust him from his common,\nand drove his cattle and harassed them. And by that suit of law poor Tom\nwas ruined altogether, for Sir Robert could pay for much swearing; and\nthen all his goods and his farm were sold up, and even his smithery\ntaken. But he saddled his horse, before they could catch him, and rode\naway to Southmolton, looking more like a madman than a good farrier,\nas the people said who saw him. But when he arrived there, instead of\ncomfort, they showed him the face of the door alone; for the news of his\nloss was before him, and Master Paramore was a sound, prudent man, and\na high member of the town council. It is said that they even gave him\nnotice to pay for Betsy's wedding-clothes, now that he was too poor to\nmarry her. This may be false, and indeed I doubt it; in the first place,\nbecause Southmolton is a busy place for talking; and in the next, that\nI do not think the action would have lain at law, especially as the\nmaid lost nothing, but used it all for her wedding next month with Dick\nVellacott, of Mockham.\n\nAll this was very sore upon Tom; and he took it to heart so grievously,\nthat he said, as a better man might have said, being loose of mind and\nproperty, \"The world hath preyed on me like a wolf. God help me now to\nprey on the world.\"\n\nAnd in sooth it did seem, for a while, as if Providence were with him;\nfor he took rare toll on the highway, and his name was soon as good as\ngold anywhere this side of Bristowe. He studied his business by night\nand by day, with three horses all in hard work, until he had made a fine\nreputation; and then it was competent to him to rest, and he had plenty\nleft for charity. And I ought to say for society too, for he truly\nloved high society, treating squires and noblemen (who much affected his\ncompany) to the very best fare of the hostel. And they say that once\nthe King's Justitiaries, being upon circuit, accepted his invitation,\ndeclaring merrily that if never true bill had been found against him,\nmine host should now be qualified to draw one. And so the landlords did;\nand he always paid them handsomely, so that all of them were kind to\nhim, and contended for his visits. Let it be known in any township that\nMr. Faggus was taking his leisure at the inn, and straightway all the\nmen flocked thither to drink his health without outlay, and all the\nwomen to admire him; while the children were set at the cross-roads to\ngive warning of any officers. One of his earliest meetings was with Sir\nRobert Bampfylde himself, who was riding along the Barum road with only\none serving-man after him. Tom Faggus put a pistol to his head, being\nthen obliged to be violent, through want of reputation; while the\nserving-man pretended to be along way round the corner. Then the baronet\npulled out his purse, quite trembling in the hurry of his politeness.\nTom took the purse, and his ring, and time-piece, and then handed them\nback with a very low bow, saying that it was against all usage for him\nto rob a robber. Then he turned to the unfaithful knave, and trounced\nhim right well for his cowardice, and stripped him of all his property.\n\nBut now Mr. Faggus kept only one horse, lest the Government should steal\nthem; and that one was the young mare Winnie. How he came by her he\nnever would tell, but I think that she was presented to him by a certain\nColonel, a lover of sport, and very clever in horseflesh, whose life Tom\nhad saved from some gamblers. When I have added that Faggus as yet\nhad never been guilty of bloodshed (for his eyes, and the click of\nhis pistol at first, and now his high reputation made all his wishes\nrespected), and that he never robbed a poor man, neither insulted a\nwoman, but was very good to the Church, and of hot patriotic opinions,\nand full of jest and jollity, I have said as much as is fair for him,\nand shown why he was so popular. Everybody cursed the Doones, who lived\napart disdainfully. But all good people liked Mr. Faggus--when he had\nnot robbed them--and many a poor sick man or woman blessed him for other\npeople's money; and all the hostlers, stable-boys, and tapsters entirely\nworshipped him.\n\nI have been rather long, and perhaps tedious, in my account of him, lest\nat any time hereafter his character should be misunderstood, and his\ngood name disparaged; whereas he was my second cousin, and the lover of\nmy--But let that bide. 'Tis a melancholy story.\n\nHe came again about three months afterwards, in the beginning of the\nspring-time, and brought me a beautiful new carbine, having learned my\nlove of such things, and my great desire to shoot straight. But mother\nwould not let me have the gun, until he averred upon his honour that he\nhad bought it honestly. And so he had, no doubt, so far as it is honest\nto buy with money acquired rampantly. Scarce could I stop to make my\nbullets in the mould which came along with it, but must be off to the\nQuarry Hill, and new target I had made there. And he taught me then\nhow to ride bright Winnie, who was grown since I had seen her, but\nremembered me most kindly. After making much of Annie, who had a\nwondrous liking for him--and he said he was her godfather, but God knows\nhow he could have been, unless they confirmed him precociously--away he\nwent, and young Winnie's sides shone like a cherry by candlelight.\n\nNow I feel that of those boyish days I have little more to tell, because\neverything went quietly, as the world for the most part does with us. I\nbegan to work at the farm in earnest, and tried to help my mother, and\nwhen I remembered Lorna Doone, it seemed no more than the thought of a\ndream, which I could hardly call to mind. Now who cares to know how many\nbushels of wheat we grew to the acre, or how the cattle milched till we\nate them, or what the turn of the seasons was? But my stupid self seemed\nlike to be the biggest of all the cattle; for having much to look after\nthe sheep, and being always in kind appetite, I grew four inches longer\nin every year of my farming, and a matter of two inches wider; until\nthere was no man of my size to be seen elsewhere upon Exmoor. Let that\npass: what odds to any how tall or wide I be? There is no Doone's door\nat Plover's Barrows and if there were I could never go through it. They\nvexed me so much about my size, long before I had completed it, girding\nat me with paltry jokes whose wit was good only to stay at home, that\nI grew shame-faced about the matter, and feared to encounter a\nlooking-glass. But mother was very proud, and said she never could have\ntoo much of me.\n\nThe worst of all to make me ashamed of bearing my head so high--a thing\nI saw no way to help, for I never could hang my chin down, and my back\nwas like a gatepost whenever I tried to bend it--the worst of all was\nour little Eliza, who never could come to a size herself, though she had\nthe wine from the Sacrament at Easter and Allhallowmas, only to be small\nand skinny, sharp, and clever crookedly. Not that her body was out of\nthe straight (being too small for that perhaps), but that her wit was\nfull of corners, jagged, and strange, and uncomfortable. You never could\ntell what she might say next; and I like not that kind of women. Now God\nforgive me for talking so of my own father's daughter, and so much the\nmore by reason that my father could not help it. The right way is\nto face the matter, and then be sorry for every one. My mother fell\ngrievously on a slide, which John Fry had made nigh the apple-room door,\nand hidden with straw from the stable, to cover his own great idleness.\nMy father laid John's nose on the ice, and kept him warm in spite of it;\nbut it was too late for Eliza. She was born next day with more mind than\nbody--the worst thing that can befall a man.\n\nBut Annie, my other sister, was now a fine fair girl, beautiful to\nbehold. I could look at her by the fireside, for an hour together, when\nI was not too sleepy, and think of my dear father. And she would do the\nsame thing by me, only wait the between of the blazes. Her hair was done\nup in a knot behind, but some would fall over her shoulders; and the\ndancing of the light was sweet to see through a man's eyelashes. There\nnever was a face that showed the light or the shadow of feeling, as if\nthe heart were sun to it, more than our dear Annie's did. To look at her\ncarefully, you might think that she was not dwelling on anything; and\nthen she would know you were looking at her, and those eyes would tell\nall about it. God knows that I try to be simple enough, to keep to His\nmeaning in me, and not make the worst of His children. Yet often have I\nbeen put to shame, and ready to bite my tongue off, after speaking amiss\nof anybody, and letting out my littleness, when suddenly mine eyes have\nmet the pure soft gaze of Annie.\n\nAs for the Doones, they were thriving still, and no one to come against\nthem; except indeed by word of mouth, to which they lent no heed\nwhatever. Complaints were made from time to time, both in high and low\nquarters (as the rank might be of the people robbed), and once or twice\nin the highest of all, to wit, the King himself. But His Majesty made\na good joke about it (not meaning any harm, I doubt), and was so much\npleased with himself thereupon, that he quite forgave the mischief.\nMoreover, the main authorities were a long way off; and the Chancellor\nhad no cattle on Exmoor; and as for my lord the Chief Justice, some\nrogue had taken his silver spoons; whereupon his lordship swore that\nnever another man would he hang until he had that one by the neck.\nTherefore the Doones went on as they listed, and none saw fit to meddle\nwith them. For the only man who would have dared to come to close\nquarters with them, that is to say Tom Faggus, himself was a quarry for\nthe law, if ever it should be unhooded. Moreover, he had transferred his\nbusiness to the neighbourhood of Wantage, in the county of Berks, where\nhe found the climate drier, also good downs and commons excellent for\ngalloping, and richer yeomen than ours be, and better roads to rob them\non.\n\nSome folk, who had wiser attended to their own affairs, said that I\n(being sizeable now, and able to shoot not badly) ought to do something\nagainst those Doones, and show what I was made of. But for a time I was\nvery bashful, shaking when called upon suddenly, and blushing as deep as\na maiden; for my strength was not come upon me, and mayhap I had grown\nin front of it. And again, though I loved my father still, and would\nfire at a word about him, I saw not how it would do him good for me to\nharm his injurers. Some races are of revengeful kind, and will for years\npursue their wrong, and sacrifice this world and the next for a\nmoment's foul satisfaction, but methinks this comes of some black blood,\nperverted and never purified. And I doubt but men of true English birth\nare stouter than so to be twisted, though some of the women may take\nthat turn, if their own life runs unkindly.\n\nLet that pass--I am never good at talking of things beyond me. All I\nknow is, that if I had met the Doone who had killed my father, I would\ngladly have thrashed him black and blue, supposing I were able; but\nwould never have fired a gun at him, unless he began that game with me,\nor fell upon more of my family, or were violent among women. And to\ndo them justice, my mother and Annie were equally kind and gentle, but\nEliza would flame and grow white with contempt, and not trust herself to\nspeak to us.\n\nNow a strange thing came to pass that winter, when I was twenty-one\nyears old, a very strange thing, which affrighted the rest, and made me\nfeel uncomfortable. Not that there was anything in it, to do harm to any\none, only that none could explain it, except by attributing it to the\ndevil. The weather was very mild and open, and scarcely any snow fell;\nat any rate, none lay on the ground, even for an hour, in the highest\npart of Exmoor; a thing which I knew not before nor since, as long as\nI can remember. But the nights were wonderfully dark, as though with no\nstars in the heaven; and all day long the mists were rolling upon\nthe hills and down them, as if the whole land were a wash-house. The\nmoorland was full of snipes and teal, and curlews flying and crying, and\nlapwings flapping heavily, and ravens hovering round dead sheep; yet no\nredshanks nor dottrell, and scarce any golden plovers (of which we have\ngreat store generally) but vast lonely birds, that cried at night, and\nmoved the whole air with their pinions; yet no man ever saw them. It was\ndismal as well as dangerous now for any man to go fowling (which of late\nI loved much in the winter) because the fog would come down so thick\nthat the pan of the gun was reeking, and the fowl out of sight ere the\npowder kindled, and then the sound of the piece was so dead, that the\nshooter feared harm, and glanced over his shoulder. But the danger of\ncourse was far less in this than in losing of the track, and falling\ninto the mires, or over the brim of a precipice.\n\nNevertheless, I must needs go out, being young and very stupid, and\nfeared of being afraid; a fear which a wise man has long cast by, having\nlearned of the manifold dangers which ever and ever encompass us. And\nbeside this folly and wildness of youth, perchance there was something,\nI know not what, of the joy we have in uncertainty. Mother, in fear\nof my missing home--though for that matter, I could smell supper, when\nhungry, through a hundred land-yards of fog--my dear mother, who thought\nof me ten times for one thought about herself, gave orders to ring the\ngreat sheep-bell, which hung above the pigeon-cote, every ten minutes of\nthe day, and the sound came through the plaits of fog, and I was vexed\nabout it, like the letters of a copy-book. It reminded me, too, of\nBlundell's bell, and the grief to go into school again.\n\nBut during those two months of fog (for we had it all the winter), the\nsaddest and the heaviest thing was to stand beside the sea. To be upon\nthe beach yourself, and see the long waves coming in; to know that they\nare long waves, but only see a piece of them; and to hear them lifting\nroundly, swelling over smooth green rocks, plashing down in the hollow\ncorners, but bearing on all the same as ever, soft and sleek and\nsorrowful, till their little noise is over.\n\n[Illustration: 100.jpg To be upon the beach]\n\nOne old man who lived at Lynmouth, seeking to be buried there, having\nbeen more than half over the world, though shy to speak about it, and\nfain to come home to his birthplace, this old Will Watcombe (who dwelt\nby the water) said that our strange winter arose from a thing he called\nthe \"Gulf-stream\", rushing up Channel suddenly. He said it was hot\nwater, almost fit for a man to shave with, and it threw all our cold\nwater out, and ruined the fish and the spawning-time, and a cold spring\nwould come after it. I was fond of going to Lynmouth on Sunday to hear\nthis old man talk, for sometimes he would discourse with me, when nobody\nelse could move him. He told me that this powerful flood set in upon our\nwest so hard sometimes once in ten years, and sometimes not for fifty,\nand the Lord only knew the sense of it; but that when it came, therewith\ncame warmth and clouds, and fog, and moisture, and nuts, and fruit, and\neven shells; and all the tides were thrown abroad. As for nuts he winked\nawhile, and chewed a piece of tobacco; yet did I not comprehend him.\nOnly afterwards I heard that nuts with liquid kernels came, travelling\non the Gulf stream; for never before was known so much foreign cordial\nlanded upon our coast, floating ashore by mistake in the fog, and (what\nwith the tossing and the mist) too much astray to learn its duty.\n\nFolk, who are ever too prone to talk, said that Will Watcombe himself\nknew better than anybody else about this drift of the Gulf-stream,\nand the places where it would come ashore, and the caves that took the\nin-draught. But De Whichehalse, our great magistrate, certified that\nthere was no proof of unlawful importation; neither good cause to\nsuspect it, at a time of Christian charity. And we knew that it was a\nfoul thing for some quarrymen to say that night after night they had\nbeen digging a new cellar at Ley Manor to hold the little marks of\nrespect found in the caverns at high-water weed. Let that be, it is none\nof my business to speak evil of dignities; duly we common people joked\nof the \"Gulp-stream,\" as we called it.\n\nBut the thing which astonished and frightened us so, was not, I do\nassure you, the landing of foreign spirits, nor the loom of a lugger at\ntwilight in the gloom of the winter moonrise. That which made as crouch\nin by the fire, or draw the bed-clothes over us, and try to think of\nsomething else, was a strange mysterious sound.\n\nAt grey of night, when the sun was gone, and no red in the west\nremained, neither were stars forthcoming, suddenly a wailing voice rose\nalong the valleys, and a sound in the air, as of people running. It\nmattered not whether you stood on the moor, or crouched behind rocks\naway from it, or down among reedy places; all as one the sound would\ncome, now from the heart of the earth beneath, now overhead bearing\ndown on you. And then there was rushing of something by, and melancholy\nlaughter, and the hair of a man would stand on end before he could\nreason properly.\n\nGod, in His mercy, knows that I am stupid enough for any man, and very\nslow of impression, nor ever could bring myself to believe that our\nFather would let the evil one get the upper hand of us. But when I had\nheard that sound three times, in the lonely gloom of the evening fog,\nand the cold that followed the lines of air, I was loath to go abroad by\nnight, even so far as the stables, and loved the light of a candle more,\nand the glow of a fire with company.\n\nThere were many stories about it, of course, all over the breadth of the\nmoorland. But those who had heard it most often declared that it must be\nthe wail of a woman's voice, and the rustle of robes fleeing horribly,\nand fiends in the fog going after her. To that, however, I paid no heed,\nwhen anybody was with me; only we drew more close together, and barred\nthe doors at sunset.\n\n[Illustration: 102.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMASTER HUCKABACK COMES IN\n\n[Illustration: 103.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nMr. Reuben Huckaback, whom many good folk in Dulverton will remember\nlong after my time, was my mother's uncle, being indeed her mother's\nbrother. He owned the very best shop in the town, and did a fine\ntrade in soft ware, especially when the pack-horses came safely in at\nChristmas-time. And we being now his only kindred (except indeed his\ngranddaughter, little Ruth Huckaback, of whom no one took any heed),\nmother beheld it a Christian duty to keep as well as could be with him,\nboth for love of a nice old man, and for the sake of her children. And\ntruly, the Dulverton people said that he was the richest man in their\ntown, and could buy up half the county armigers; 'ay, and if it came to\nthat, they would like to see any man, at Bampton, or at Wivelscombe,\nand you might say almost Taunton, who could put down golden Jacobus and\nCarolus against him.\n\nNow this old gentleman--so they called him, according to his money;\nand I have seen many worse ones, more violent and less wealthy--he must\nneeds come away that time to spend the New Year-tide with us; not that\nhe wanted to do it (for he hated country-life), but because my mother\npressing, as mothers will do to a good bag of gold, had wrung a promise\nfrom him; and the only boast of his life was that never yet had he\nbroken his word, at least since he opened business.\n\nNow it pleased God that Christmas-time (in spite of all the fogs) to\nsend safe home to Dulverton, and what was more, with their loads quite\nsafe, a goodly string of packhorses. Nearly half of their charge was\nfor Uncle Reuben, and he knew how to make the most of it. Then having\nbalanced his debits and credits, and set the writs running against\ndefaulters, as behoves a good Christian at Christmas-tide, he saddled\nhis horse, and rode off towards Oare, with a good stout coat upon him,\nand leaving Ruth and his head man plenty to do, and little to eat, until\nthey should see him again.\n\nIt had been settled between us that we should expect him soon after noon\non the last day of December. For the Doones being lazy and fond of bed,\nas the manner is of dishonest folk, the surest way to escape them was\nto travel before they were up and about, to-wit, in the forenoon of\nthe day. But herein we reckoned without our host: for being in high\nfestivity, as became good Papists, the robbers were too lazy, it seems,\nto take the trouble of going to bed; and forth they rode on the Old\nYear-morning, not with any view of business, but purely in search of\nmischief.\n\nWe had put off our dinner till one o'clock (which to me was a sad\nforegoing), and there was to be a brave supper at six of the clock, upon\nNew Year's-eve; and the singers to come with their lanthorns, and do\nit outside the parlour-window, and then have hot cup till their heads\nshould go round, after making away with the victuals. For although there\nwas nobody now in our family to be churchwarden of Oare, it was well\nadmitted that we were the people entitled alone to that dignity; and\nthough Nicholas Snowe was in office by name, he managed it only by\nmother's advice; and a pretty mess he made of it, so that every one\nlonged for a Ridd again, soon as ever I should be old enough. This\nNicholas Snowe was to come in the evening, with his three tall comely\ndaughters, strapping girls, and well skilled in the dairy; and the\nstory was all over the parish, on a stupid conceit of John Fry's, that\nI should have been in love with all three, if there had been but one of\nthem. These Snowes were to come, and come they did, partly because Mr.\nHuckaback liked to see fine young maidens, and partly because none but\nNicholas Snowe could smoke a pipe now all around our parts, except of\nthe very high people, whom we durst never invite. And Uncle Ben, as we\nall knew well, was a great hand at his pipe, and would sit for hours\nover it, in our warm chimney-corner, and never want to say a word,\nunless it were inside him; only he liked to have somebody there over\nagainst him smoking.\n\n[Illustration: 105.jpg Uncle Ben in our warm chimney-corner]\n\nNow when I came in, before one o'clock, after seeing to the cattle--for\nthe day was thicker than ever, and we must keep the cattle close at\nhome, if we wished to see any more of them--I fully expected to find\nUncle Ben sitting in the fireplace, lifting one cover and then another,\nas his favourite manner was, and making sweet mouths over them; for he\nloved our bacon rarely, and they had no good leeks at Dulverton; and\nhe was a man who always would see his business done himself. But there\ninstead of my finding him with his quaint dry face pulled out at me,\nand then shut up sharp not to be cheated--who should run out but Betty\nMuxworthy, and poke me with a saucepan lid.\n\n\"Get out of that now, Betty,\" I said in my politest manner, for really\nBetty was now become a great domestic evil. She would have her own\nway so, and of all things the most distressful was for a man to try to\nreason.\n\n\"Zider-press,\" cried Betty again, for she thought it a fine joke to call\nme that, because of my size, and my hatred of it; \"here be a rare get\nup, anyhow.\"\n\n\"A rare good dinner, you mean, Betty. Well, and I have a rare good\nappetite.\" With that I wanted to go and smell it, and not to stop for\nBetty.\n\n\"Troost thee for thiccy, Jan Ridd. But thee must keep it bit langer, I\nreckon. Her baint coom, Maister Ziderpress. Whatt'e mak of that now?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that Uncle Ben has not arrived yet, Betty?\"\n\n\"Raived! I knaws nout about that, whuther a hath of noo. Only I tell 'e,\nher baint coom. Rackon them Dooneses hath gat 'un.\"\n\nAnd Betty, who hated Uncle Ben, because he never gave her a groat,\nand she was not allowed to dine with him, I am sorry to say that\nBetty Muxworthy grinned all across, and poked me again with the greasy\nsaucepan cover. But I misliking so to be treated, strode through the\nkitchen indignantly, for Betty behaved to me even now, as if I were only\nEliza.\n\n\"Oh, Johnny, Johnny,\" my mother cried, running out of the grand\nshow-parlour, where the case of stuffed birds was, and peacock-feathers,\nand the white hare killed by grandfather; \"I am so glad you are come at\nlast. There is something sadly amiss, Johnny.\"\n\nMother had upon her wrists something very wonderful, of the nature of\nfal-lal as we say, and for which she had an inborn turn, being of good\ndraper family, and polished above the yeomanry. Nevertheless I could\nnever bear it, partly because I felt it to be out of place in our good\nfarm-house, partly because I hate frippery, partly because it seemed to\nme to have nothing to do with father, and partly because I never could\ntell the reason of my hating it. And yet the poor soul had put them on,\nnot to show her hands off (which were above her station) but simply\nfor her children's sake, because Uncle Ben had given them. But another\nthing, I never could bear for man or woman to call me, \"Johnny,\"\n\"Jack,\" or \"John,\" I cared not which; and that was honest enough, and no\nsmallness of me there, I say.\n\n\"Well, mother, what is the matter, then?\"\n\n\"I am sure you need not be angry, Johnny. I only hope it is nothing to\ngrieve about, instead of being angry. You are very sweet-tempered, I\nknow, John Ridd, and perhaps a little too sweet at times\"--here she\nmeant the Snowe girls, and I hanged my head--\"but what would you say if\nthe people there\"--she never would call them \"Doones\"--\"had gotten your\npoor Uncle Reuben, horse, and Sunday coat, and all?\"\n\n\"Why, mother, I should be sorry for them. He would set up a shop by the\nriver-side, and come away with all their money.\"\n\n\"That all you have to say, John! And my dinner done to a very turn, and\nthe supper all fit to go down, and no worry, only to eat and be done\nwith it! And all the new plates come from Watchett, with the Watchett\nblue upon them, at the risk of the lives of everybody, and the capias\nfrom good Aunt Jane for stuffing a curlew with onion before he begins to\nget cold, and make a woodcock of him, and the way to turn the flap over\nin the inside of a roasting pig--\"\n\n\"Well, mother dear, I am very sorry. But let us have our dinner. You\nknow we promised not to wait for him after one o'clock; and you only\nmake us hungry. Everything will be spoiled, mother, and what a pity to\nthink of! After that I will go to seek for him in the thick of the fog,\nlike a needle in a hay-band. That is to say, unless you think\"--for she\nlooked very grave about it--\"unless you really think, mother, that I\nought to go without dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh no, John, I never thought that, thank God! Bless Him for my\nchildren's appetites; and what is Uncle Ben to them?\"\n\nSo we made a very good dinner indeed, though wishing that he could have\nsome of it, and wondering how much to leave for him; and then, as no\nsound of his horse had been heard, I set out with my gun to look for\nhim.\n\nI followed the track on the side of the hill, from the farm-yard, where\nthe sledd-marks are--for we have no wheels upon Exmoor yet, nor ever\nshall, I suppose; though a dunder-headed man tried it last winter, and\nbroke his axle piteously, and was nigh to break his neck--and after\nthat I went all along on the ridge of the rabbit-cleve, with the brook\nrunning thin in the bottom; and then down to the Lynn stream and leaped\nit, and so up the hill and the moor beyond. The fog hung close all\naround me then, when I turned the crest of the highland, and the gorse\nboth before and behind me looked like a man crouching down in ambush.\nBut still there was a good cloud of daylight, being scarce three of the\nclock yet, and when a lead of red deer came across, I could tell them\nfrom sheep even now. I was half inclined to shoot at them, for the\nchildren did love venison; but they drooped their heads so, and looked\nso faithful, that it seemed hard measure to do it. If one of them had\nbolted away, no doubt I had let go at him.\n\nAfter that I kept on the track, trudging very stoutly, for nigh upon\nthree miles, and my beard (now beginning to grow at some length) was\nfull of great drops and prickly, whereat I was very proud. I had not so\nmuch as a dog with me, and the place was unkind and lonesome, and the\nrolling clouds very desolate; and now if a wild sheep ran across he was\nscared at me as an enemy; and I for my part could not tell the meaning\nof the marks on him. We called all this part Gibbet-moor, not being in\nour parish; but though there were gibbets enough upon it, most part\nof the bodies was gone for the value of the chains, they said, and the\nteaching of young chirurgeons. But of all this I had little fear, being\nno more a schoolboy now, but a youth well-acquaint with Exmoor, and\nthe wise art of the sign-posts, whereby a man, who barred the road, now\nopens it up both ways with his finger-bones, so far as rogues allow him.\nMy carbine was loaded and freshly primed, and I knew myself to be\neven now a match in strength for any two men of the size around our\nneighbourhood, except in the Glen Doone. \"Girt Jan Ridd,\" I was called\nalready, and folk grew feared to wrestle with me; though I was tired of\nhearing about it, and often longed to be smaller. And most of all upon\nSundays, when I had to make way up our little church, and the maidens\ntittered at me.\n\nThe soft white mist came thicker around me, as the evening fell; and the\npeat ricks here and there, and the furze-hucks of the summer-time, were\nall out of shape in the twist of it. By-and-by, I began to doubt where\nI was, or how come there, not having seen a gibbet lately; and then I\nheard the draught of the wind up a hollow place with rocks to it; and\nfor the first time fear broke out (like cold sweat) upon me. And yet I\nknew what a fool I was, to fear nothing but a sound! But when I stopped\nto listen, there was no sound, more than a beating noise, and that was\nall inside me. Therefore I went on again, making company of myself, and\nkeeping my gun quite ready.\n\nNow when I came to an unknown place, where a stone was set up endwise,\nwith a faint red cross upon it, and a polish from some conflict, I\ngathered my courage to stop and think, having sped on the way too hotly.\nAgainst that stone I set my gun, trying my spirit to leave it so,\nbut keeping with half a hand for it; and then what to do next was the\nwonder. As for finding Uncle Ben that was his own business, or at any\nrate his executor's; first I had to find myself, and plentifully would\nthank God to find myself at home again, for the sake of all our family.\n\nThe volumes of the mist came rolling at me (like great logs of wood,\npillowed out with sleepiness), and between them there was nothing more\nthan waiting for the next one. Then everything went out of sight, and\nglad was I of the stone behind me, and view of mine own shoes. Then a\ndistant noise went by me, as of many horses galloping, and in my fright\nI set my gun and said, \"God send something to shoot at.\" Yet nothing\ncame, and my gun fell back, without my will to lower it.\n\nBut presently, while I was thinking \"What a fool I am!\" arose as if from\nbelow my feet, so that the great stone trembled, that long, lamenting\nlonesome sound, as of an evil spirit not knowing what to do with it. For\nthe moment I stood like a root, without either hand or foot to help me,\nand the hair of my head began to crawl, lifting my hat, as a snail lifts\nhis house; and my heart like a shuttle went to and fro. But finding\nno harm to come of it, neither visible form approaching, I wiped my\nforehead, and hoped for the best, and resolved to run every step of the\nway, till I drew our own latch behind me.\n\nYet here again I was disappointed, for no sooner was I come to the\ncross-ways by the black pool in the hole, but I heard through the patter\nof my own feet a rough low sound very close in the fog, as of a hobbled\nsheep a-coughing. I listened, and feared, and yet listened again, though\nI wanted not to hear it. For being in haste of the homeward road, and\nall my heart having heels to it, loath I was to stop in the dusk for the\nsake of an aged wether. Yet partly my love of all animals, and partly\nmy fear of the farmer's disgrace, compelled me to go to the succour, and\nthe noise was coming nearer. A dry short wheezing sound it was, barred\nwith coughs and want of breath; but thus I made the meaning of it.\n\n\"Lord have mercy upon me! O Lord, upon my soul have mercy! An if I\ncheated Sam Hicks last week, Lord knowest how well he deserved it, and\nlied in every stocking's mouth--oh Lord, where be I a-going?\"\n\nThese words, with many jogs between them, came to me through the\ndarkness, and then a long groan and a choking. I made towards the sound,\nas nigh as ever I could guess, and presently was met, point-blank, by\nthe head of a mountain-pony. Upon its back lay a man bound down, with\nhis feet on the neck and his head to the tail, and his arms falling\ndown like stirrups. The wild little nag was scared of its life by the\nunaccustomed burden, and had been tossing and rolling hard, in desire to\nget ease of it.\n\nBefore the little horse could turn, I caught him, jaded as he was, by\nhis wet and grizzled forelock, and he saw that it was vain to struggle,\nbut strove to bite me none the less, until I smote him upon the nose.\n\n\"Good and worthy sir,\" I said to the man who was riding so roughly;\n\"fear nothing; no harm shall come to thee.\"\n\n\"Help, good friend, whoever thou art,\" he gasped, but could not look at\nme, because his neck was jerked so; \"God hath sent thee, and not to rob\nme, because it is done already.\"\n\n\"What, Uncle Ben!\" I cried, letting go the horse in amazement, that\nthe richest man in Dulverton--\"Uncle Ben here in this plight! What, Mr.\nReuben Huckaback!\"\n\n\"An honest hosier and draper, serge and longcloth warehouseman\"--he\ngroaned from rib to rib--\"at the sign of the Gartered Kitten in the\nloyal town of Dulverton. For God's sake, let me down, good fellow, from\nthis accursed marrow-bone; and a groat of good money will I pay thee,\nsafe in my house to Dulverton; but take notice that the horse is mine,\nno less than the nag they robbed from me.\"\n\n\"What, Uncle Ben, dost thou not know me, thy dutiful nephew John Ridd?\"\n\nNot to make a long story of it, I cut the thongs that bound him, and\nset him astride on the little horse; but he was too weak to stay so.\nTherefore I mounted him on my back, turning the horse into horse-steps,\nand leading the pony by the cords which I fastened around his nose, set\nout for Plover's Barrows.\n\nUncle Ben went fast asleep on my back, being jaded and shaken beyond his\nstrength, for a man of three-score and five; and as soon he felt assured\nof safety he would talk no more. And to tell the truth he snored so\nloudly, that I could almost believe that fearful noise in the fog every\nnight came all the way from Dulverton.\n\nNow as soon as ever I brought him in, we set him up in the\nchimney-corner, comfortable and handsome; and it was no little delight\nto me to get him off my back; for, like his own fortune, Uncle Ben was\nof a good round figure. He gave his long coat a shake or two, and he\nstamped about in the kitchen, until he was sure of his whereabouts, and\nthen he fell asleep again until supper should be ready.\n\n\"He shall marry Ruth,\" he said by-and-by to himself, and not to me; \"he\nshall marry Ruth for this, and have my little savings, soon as they be\nworth the having. Very little as yet, very little indeed; and ever so\nmuch gone to-day along of them rascal robbers.\"\n\nMy mother made a dreadful stir, of course, about Uncle Ben being in such\na plight as this; so I left him to her care and Annie's, and soon they\nfed him rarely, while I went out to see to the comfort of the captured\npony. And in truth he was worth the catching, and served us very well\nafterwards, though Uncle Ben was inclined to claim him for his business\nat Dulverton, where they have carts and that like. \"But,\" I said, \"you\nshall have him, sir, and welcome, if you will only ride him home as\nfirst I found you riding him.\" And with that he dropped it.\n\nA very strange old man he was, short in his manner, though long of body,\nglad to do the contrary things to what any one expected of him, and\nalways looking sharp at people, as if he feared to be cheated. This\nsurprised me much at first, because it showed his ignorance of what we\nfarmers are--an upright race, as you may find, scarcely ever cheating\nindeed, except upon market-day, and even then no more than may be helped\nby reason of buyers expecting it. Now our simple ways were a puzzle to\nhim, as I told him very often; but he only laughed, and rubbed his mouth\nwith the back of his dry shining hand, and I think he shortly began to\nlanguish for want of some one to higgle with. I had a great mind to give\nhim the pony, because he thought himself cheated in that case; only he\nwould conclude that I did it with some view to a legacy.\n\nOf course, the Doones, and nobody else, had robbed good Uncle Reuben;\nand then they grew sportive, and took his horse, an especially sober\nnag, and bound the master upon the wild one, for a little change as they\ntold him. For two or three hours they had fine enjoyment chasing him\nthrough the fog, and making much sport of his groanings; and then\nwaxing hungry, they went their way, and left him to opportunity. Now\nMr. Huckaback growing able to walk in a few days' time, became thereupon\nimpatient, and could not be brought to understand why he should have\nbeen robbed at all.\n\n\"I have never deserved it,\" he said to himself, not knowing much of\nProvidence, except with a small p to it; \"I have never deserved it, and\nwill not stand it in the name of our lord the King, not I!\" At other\ntimes he would burst forth thus: \"Three-score years and five have I\nlived an honest and laborious life, yet never was I robbed before. And\nnow to be robbed in my old age, to be robbed for the first time now!\"\n\nThereupon of course we would tell him how truly thankful he ought to be\nfor never having been robbed before, in spite of living so long in this\nworld, and that he was taking a very ungrateful, not to say ungracious,\nview, in thus repining, and feeling aggrieved; when anyone else would\nhave knelt and thanked God for enjoying so long an immunity. But say\nwhat we would, it was all as one. Uncle Ben stuck fast to it, that he\nhad nothing to thank God for.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA MOTION WHICH ENDS IN A MULL\n\n[Illustration: 113.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nInstead of minding his New-Year pudding, Master Huckaback carried on so\nabout his mighty grievance, that at last we began to think there must be\nsomething in it, after all; especially as he assured us that choice and\ncostly presents for the young people of our household were among the\ngoods divested. But mother told him her children had plenty, and wanted\nno gold and silver, and little Eliza spoke up and said, \"You can give us\nthe pretty things, Uncle Ben, when we come in the summer to see you.\"\n\nOur mother reproved Eliza for this, although it was the heel of her\nown foot; and then to satisfy our uncle, she promised to call Farmer\nNicholas Snowe, to be of our council that evening, \"And if the young\nmaidens would kindly come, without taking thought to smoothe themselves,\nwhy it would be all the merrier, and who knew but what Uncle Huckaback\nmight bless the day of his robbery, etc., etc.--and thorough good honest\ngirls they were, fit helpmates either for shop or farm.\" All of which\nwas meant for me; but I stuck to my platter and answered not.\n\nIn the evening Farmer Snowe came up, leading his daughters after him,\nlike fillies trimmed for a fair; and Uncle Ben, who had not seen them on\nthe night of his mishap (because word had been sent to stop them), was\nmightily pleased and very pleasant, according to his town bred ways.\nThe damsels had seen good company, and soon got over their fear of his\nwealth, and played him a number of merry pranks, which made our mother\nquite jealous for Annie, who was always shy and diffident. However, when\nthe hot cup was done, and before the mulled wine was ready, we packed\nall the maidens in the parlour and turned the key upon them; and then we\ndrew near to the kitchen fire to hear Uncle Ben's proposal. Farmer Snowe\nsat up in the corner, caring little to bear about anything, but smoking\nslowly, and nodding backward like a sheep-dog dreaming. Mother was in\nthe settle, of course, knitting hard, as usual; and Uncle Ben took to\na three-legged stool, as if all but that had been thieved from him.\nHowsoever, he kept his breath from speech, giving privilege, as was due,\nto mother.\n\n[Illustration: 114.jpg Farmer Snow sat up in the chair]\n\n\"Master Snowe, you are well assured,\" said mother, colouring like the\nfurze as it took the flame and fell over, \"that our kinsman here hath\nreceived rough harm on his peaceful journey from Dulverton. The times\nare bad, as we all know well, and there is no sign of bettering them,\nand if I could see our Lord the King I might say things to move him!\nnevertheless, I have had so much of my own account to vex for--\"\n\n\"You are flying out of the subject, Sarah,\" said Uncle Ben, seeing tears\nin her eyes, and tired of that matter.\n\n\"Zettle the pralimbinaries,\" spoke Farmer Snowe, on appeal from us,\n\"virst zettle the pralimbinaries; and then us knows what be drivin' at.\"\n\n\"Preliminaries be damned, sir,\" cried Uncle Ben, losing his temper.\n\"What preliminaries were there when I was robbed; I should like to know?\nRobbed in this parish as I can prove, to the eternal disgrace of Oare\nand the scandal of all England. And I hold this parish to answer for it,\nsir; this parish shall make it good, being a nest of foul thieves as it\nis; ay, farmers, and yeomen, and all of you. I will beggar every man\nin this parish, if they be not beggars already, ay, and sell your old\nchurch up before your eyes, but what I will have back my tarlatan,\ntime-piece, saddle, and dove-tailed nag.\"\n\nMother looked at me, and I looked at Farmer Snowe, and we all were sorry\nfor Master Huckaback, putting our hands up one to another, that nobody\nshould browbeat him; because we all knew what our parish was, and none\nthe worse for strong language, however rich the man might be. But Uncle\nBen took it in a different way. He thought that we all were afraid of\nhim, and that Oare parish was but as Moab or Edom, for him to cast his\nshoe over.\n\n\"Nephew Jack,\" he cried, looking at me when I was thinking what to say,\nand finding only emptiness, \"you are a heavy lout, sir; a bumpkin, a\nclodhopper; and I shall leave you nothing, unless it be my boots to\ngrease.\"\n\n\"Well, uncle,\" I made answer, \"I will grease your boots all the same for\nthat, so long as you be our guest, sir.\"\n\nNow, that answer, made without a thought, stood me for two thousand\npounds, as you shall see, by-and-by, perhaps.\n\n\"As for the parish,\" my mother cried, being too hard set to contain\nherself, \"the parish can defend itself, and we may leave it to do so.\nBut our Jack is not like that, sir; and I will not have him spoken of.\nLeave him indeed! Who wants you to do more than to leave him alone, sir;\nas he might have done you the other night; and as no one else would\nhave dared to do. And after that, to think so meanly of me, and of my\nchildren!\"\n\n\"Hoity, toity, Sarah! Your children, I suppose, are the same as other\npeople's.\"\n\n\"That they are not; and never will be; and you ought to know it, Uncle\nReuben, if any one in the world ought. Other people's children!\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" Uncle Reuben answered, \"I know very little of children;\nexcept my little Ruth, and she is nothing wonderful.\"\n\n\"I never said that my children were wonderful Uncle Ben; nor did I ever\nthink it. But as for being good--\"\n\nHere mother fetched out her handkerchief, being overcome by our\ngoodness; and I told her, with my hand to my mouth, not to notice him;\nthough he might be worth ten thousand times ten thousand pounds.\n\nBut Farmer Snowe came forward now, for he had some sense sometimes; and\nhe thought it was high time for him to say a word for the parish.\n\n\"Maister Huckaback,\" he began, pointing with his pipe at him, the end\nthat was done in sealing-wax, \"tooching of what you was plaized to zay\n'bout this here parish, and no oother, mind me no oother parish but\nthees, I use the vreedom, zur, for to tell 'e, that thee be a laiar.\"\n\nThen Farmer Nicholas Snowe folded his arms across with the bowl of his\npipe on the upper one, and gave me a nod, and then one to mother, to\ntestify how he had done his duty, and recked not what might come of it.\nHowever, he got little thanks from us; for the parish was nothing at all\nto my mother, compared with her children's interests; and I thought it\nhard that an uncle of mine, and an old man too, should be called a liar,\nby a visitor at our fireplace. For we, in our rude part of the world,\ncounted it one of the worst disgraces that could befall a man, to\nreceive the lie from any one. But Uncle Ben, as it seems was used to\nit, in the way of trade, just as people of fashion are, by a style of\ncourtesy.\n\nTherefore the old man only looked with pity at Farmer Nicholas; and\nwith a sort of sorrow too, reflecting how much he might have made in a\nbargain with such a customer, so ignorant and hot-headed.\n\n\"Now let us bandy words no more,\" said mother, very sweetly; \"nothing is\neasier than sharp words, except to wish them unspoken; as I do many and\nmany's the time, when I think of my good husband. But now let us hear\nfrom Uncle Reuben what he would have us do to remove this disgrace from\namongst us, and to satisfy him of his goods.\"\n\n\"I care not for my goods, woman,\" Master Huckaback answered grandly;\n\"although they were of large value, about them I say nothing. But what I\ndemand is this, the punishment of those scoundrels.\"\n\n\"Zober, man, zober!\" cried Farmer Nicholas; \"we be too naigh Badgery\n'ood, to spake like that of they Dooneses.\"\n\n\"Pack of cowards!\" said Uncle Reuben, looking first at the door,\nhowever; \"much chance I see of getting redress from the valour of this\nExmoor! And you, Master Snowe, the very man whom I looked to to raise\nthe country, and take the lead as churchwarden--why, my youngest shopman\nwould match his ell against you. Pack of cowards,\" cried Uncle Ben,\nrising and shaking his lappets at us; \"don't pretend to answer me. Shake\nyou all off, that I do--nothing more to do with you!\"\n\nWe knew it useless to answer him, and conveyed our knowledge to one\nanother, without anything to vex him. However, when the mulled wine\nwas come, and a good deal of it gone (the season being Epiphany),\nUncle Reuben began to think that he might have been too hard with us.\nMoreover, he was beginning now to respect Farmer Nicholas bravely,\nbecause of the way he had smoked his pipes, and the little noise made\nover them. And Lizzie and Annie were doing their best--for now we had\nlet the girls out--to wake more lightsome uproar; also young Faith Snowe\nwas toward to keep the old men's cups aflow, and hansel them to their\nliking.\n\nSo at the close of our entertainment, when the girls were gone away\nto fetch and light their lanthorns (over which they made rare noise,\nblowing each the other's out for counting of the sparks to come), Master\nHuckaback stood up, without much aid from the crock-saw, and looked at\nmother and all of us.\n\n\"Let no one leave this place,\" said he, \"until I have said what I\nwant to say; for saving of ill-will among us; and growth of cheer and\ncomfort. May be I have carried things too far, even to the bounds of\nchurlishness, and beyond the bounds of good manners. I will not unsay\none word I have said, having never yet done so in my life; but I would\nalter the manner of it, and set it forth in this light. If you folks\nupon Exmoor here are loath and wary at fighting, yet you are brave\nat better stuff; the best and kindest I ever knew, in the matter of\nfeeding.\"\n\nHere he sat down with tears in his eyes, and called for a little mulled\nbastard. All the maids, who were now come back, raced to get it for him,\nbut Annie of course was foremost. And herein ended the expedition, a\nperilous and a great one, against the Doones of Bagworthy; an enterprise\nover which we had all talked plainly more than was good for us. For my\npart, I slept well that night, feeling myself at home again, now that\nthe fighting was put aside, and the fear of it turned to the comfort of\ntalking what we would have done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_QUO WARRANTO_?\n\n[Illustration: 118.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nOn the following day Master Huckaback, with some show of mystery,\ndemanded from my mother an escort into a dangerous part of the world, to\nwhich his business compelled him. My mother made answer to this that\nhe was kindly welcome to take our John Fry with him; at which the good\nclothier laughed, and said that John was nothing like big enough, but\nanother John must serve his turn, not only for his size, but because if\nhe were carried away, no stone would be left unturned upon Exmoor, until\nhe should be brought back again. Hereupon my mother grew very pale, and\nfound fifty reasons against my going, each of them weightier than the\ntrue one, as Eliza (who was jealous of me) managed to whisper to\nAnnie. On the other hand, I was quite resolved (directly the thing was\nmentioned) to see Uncle Reuben through with it; and it added much to my\nself-esteem to be the guard of so rich a man. Therefore I soon persuaded\nmother, with her head upon my breast, to let me go and trust in God; and\nafter that I was greatly vexed to find that this dangerous enterprise\nwas nothing more than a visit to the Baron de Whichehalse, to lay\nan information, and sue a warrant against the Doones, and a posse to\nexecute it.\n\nStupid as I always have been, and must ever be no doubt, I could well\nhave told Uncle Reuben that his journey was no wiser than that of\nthe men of Gotham; that he never would get from Hugh de Whichehalse a\nwarrant against the Doones; moreover, that if he did get one, his own\nwig would be singed with it. But for divers reasons I held my peace,\npartly from youth and modesty, partly from desire to see whatever please\nGod I should see, and partly from other causes.\n\nWe rode by way of Brendon town, Illford Bridge, and Babbrook, to avoid\nthe great hill above Lynmouth; and the day being fine and clear again, I\nlaughed in my sleeve at Uncle Reuben for all his fine precautions. When\nwe arrived at Ley Manor, we were shown very civilly into the hall, and\nrefreshed with good ale and collared head, and the back of a Christmas\npudding. I had never been under so fine a roof (unless it were of a\nchurch) before; and it pleased me greatly to be so kindly entreated by\nhigh-born folk. But Uncle Reuben was vexed a little at being set down\nside by side with a man in a very small way of trade, who was come\nupon some business there, and who made bold to drink his health after\nfinishing their horns of ale.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Uncle Ben, looking at him, \"my health would fare much\nbetter, if you would pay me three pounds and twelve shillings, which you\nhave owed me these five years back; and now we are met at the Justice's,\nthe opportunity is good, sir.\"\n\nAfter that, we were called to the Justice-room, where the Baron himself\nwas sitting with Colonel Harding, another Justiciary of the King's\npeace, to help him. I had seen the Baron de Whichehalse before, and was\nnot at all afraid of him, having been at school with his son as he knew,\nand it made him very kind to me. And indeed he was kind to everybody,\nand all our people spoke well of him; and so much the more because we\nknew that the house was in decadence. For the first De Whichehalse had\ncome from Holland, where he had been a great nobleman, some hundred and\nfifty years agone. Being persecuted for his religion, when the Spanish\npower was everything, he fled to England with all he could save, and\nbought large estates in Devonshire. Since then his descendants had\nintermarried with ancient county families, Cottwells, and Marwoods, and\nWalronds, and Welses of Pylton, and Chichesters of Hall; and several of\nthe ladies brought them large increase of property. And so about fifty\nyears before the time of which I am writing, there were few names in the\nWest of England thought more of than De Whichehalse. But now they had\nlost a great deal of land, and therefore of that which goes with land,\nas surely as fame belongs to earth--I mean big reputation. How they had\nlost it, none could tell; except that as the first descendants had\na manner of amassing, so the later ones were gifted with a power of\nscattering. Whether this came of good Devonshire blood opening the\nsluice of Low Country veins, is beyond both my province and my power to\ninquire. Anyhow, all people loved this last strain of De Whichehalse far\nmore than the name had been liked a hundred years agone.\n\n[Illustration: 120.jpg Hugh de Whichehalse]\n\nHugh de Whichehalse, a white-haired man, of very noble presence, with\nfriendly blue eyes and a sweet smooth forehead, and aquiline nose\nquite beautiful (as you might expect in a lady of birth), and thin lips\ncurving delicately, this gentleman rose as we entered the room; while\nColonel Harding turned on his chair, and struck one spur against the\nother. I am sure that, without knowing aught of either, we must have\nreverenced more of the two the one who showed respect to us. And yet\nnine gentleman out of ten make this dull mistake when dealing with the\nclass below them!\n\nUncle Reuben made his very best scrape, and then walked up to the table,\ntrying to look as if he did not know himself to be wealthier than both\nthe gentlemen put together. Of course he was no stranger to them, any\nmore than I was; and, as it proved afterwards, Colonel Harding owed him\na lump of money, upon very good security. Of him Uncle Reuben took no\nnotice, but addressed himself to De Whichehalse.\n\nThe Baron smiled very gently, so soon as he learned the cause of this\nvisit, and then he replied quite reasonably.\n\n\"A warrant against the Doones, Master Huckaback. Which of the Doones, so\nplease you; and the Christian names, what be they?\"\n\n\"My lord, I am not their godfather; and most like they never had any.\nBut we all know old Sir Ensor's name, so that may be no obstacle.\"\n\n\"Sir Ensor Doone and his sons--so be it. How many sons, Master\nHuckaback, and what is the name of each one?\"\n\n\"How can I tell you, my lord, even if I had known them all as well as my\nown shop-boys? Nevertheless there were seven of them, and that should be\nno obstacle.\"\n\n\"A warrant against Sir Ensor Doone, and seven sons of Sir Ensor Doone,\nChristian names unknown, and doubted if they have any. So far so good\nMaster Huckaback. I have it all down in writing. Sir Ensor himself was\nthere, of course, as you have given in evidence--\"\n\n\"No, no, my lord, I never said that: I never said--\"\n\n\"If he can prove that he was not there, you may be indicted for perjury.\nBut as for those seven sons of his, of course you can swear that they\nwere his sons and not his nephews, or grandchildren, or even no Doones\nat all?\"\n\n\"My lord, I can swear that they were Doones. Moreover, I can pay for any\nmistake I make. Therein need be no obstacle.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he can pay; he can pay well enough,\" said Colonel Harding\nshortly.\n\n\"I am heartily glad to hear it,\" replied the Baron pleasantly; \"for it\nproves after all that this robbery (if robbery there has been) was not\nso very ruinous. Sometimes people think they are robbed, and then it is\nvery sweet afterwards to find that they have not been so; for it adds\nto their joy in their property. Now, are you quite convinced, good sir,\nthat these people (if there were any) stole, or took, or even borrowed\nanything at all from you?\"\n\n\"My lord, do you think that I was drunk?\"\n\n\"Not for a moment, Master Huckaback. Although excuse might be made for\nyou at this time of the year. But how did you know that your visitors\nwere of this particular family?\"\n\n\"Because it could be nobody else. Because, in spite of the fog--\"\n\n\"Fog!\" cried Colonel Harding sharply.\n\n\"Fog!\" said the Baron, with emphasis. \"Ah, that explains the whole\naffair. To be sure, now I remember, the weather has been too thick for a\nman to see the head of his own horse. The Doones (if still there be any\nDoones) could never have come abroad; that is as sure as simony. Master\nHuckaback, for your good sake, I am heartily glad that this charge has\nmiscarried. I thoroughly understand it now. The fog explains the whole\nof it.\"\n\n\"Go back, my good fellow,\" said Colonel Harding; \"and if the day is\nclear enough, you will find all your things where you left them. I know,\nfrom my own experience, what it is to be caught in an Exmoor fog.\"\n\nUncle Reuben, by this time, was so put out, that he hardly knew what he\nwas saying.\n\n\"My lord, Sir Colonel, is this your justice! If I go to London myself\nfor it, the King shall know how his commission--how a man may be robbed,\nand the justices prove that he ought to be hanged at back of it; that in\nhis good shire of Somerset--\"\n\n\"Your pardon a moment, good sir,\" De Whichehalse interrupted him; \"but I\nwas about (having heard your case) to mention what need be an obstacle,\nand, I fear, would prove a fatal one, even if satisfactory proof were\nafforded of a felony. The mal-feasance (if any) was laid in Somerset;\nbut we, two humble servants of His Majesty, are in commission of his\npeace for the county of Devon only, and therefore could never deal with\nit.\"\n\n\"And why, in the name of God,\" cried Uncle Reuben now carried at last\nfairly beyond himself, \"why could you not say as much at first, and save\nme all this waste of time and worry of my temper? Gentlemen, you are\nall in league; all of you stick together. You think it fair sport for an\nhonest trader, who makes no shams as you do, to be robbed and wellnigh\nmurdered, so long as they who did it won the high birthright of felony.\nIf a poor sheep stealer, to save his children from dying of starvation,\nhad dared to look at a two-month lamb, he would swing on the Manor\ngallows, and all of you cry 'Good riddance!' But now, because good birth\nand bad manners--\" Here poor Uncle Ben, not being so strong as before\nthe Doones had played with him, began to foam at the mouth a little, and\nhis tongue went into the hollow where his short grey whiskers were.\n\nI forget how we came out of it, only I was greatly shocked at bearding\nof the gentry so, and mother scarce could see her way, when I told her\nall about it. \"Depend upon it you were wrong, John,\" was all I could get\nout of her; though what had I done but listen, and touch my forelock,\nwhen called upon. \"John, you may take my word for it, you have not done\nas you should have done. Your father would have been shocked to think of\ngoing to Baron de Whichehalse, and in his own house insulting him! And\nyet it was very brave of you John. Just like you, all over. And (as none\nof the men are here, dear John) I am proud of you for doing it.\"\n\nAll throughout the homeward road, Uncle Ben had been very silent,\nfeeling much displeased with himself and still more so with other\npeople. But before he went to bed that night, he just said to me,\n\"Nephew Jack, you have not behaved so badly as the rest to me. And\nbecause you have no gift of talking, I think that I may trust you.\nNow, mark my words, this villain job shall not have ending here. I have\nanother card to play.\"\n\n\"You mean, sir, I suppose, that you will go to the justices of this\nshire, Squire Maunder, or Sir Richard Blewitt, or--\"\n\n\"Oaf, I mean nothing of the sort; they would only make a laughing-stock,\nas those Devonshire people did, of me. No, I will go to the King\nhimself, or a man who is bigger than the King, and to whom I have ready\naccess. I will not tell thee his name at present, only if thou art\nbrought before him, never wilt thou forget it.\" That was true enough,\nby the bye, as I discovered afterwards, for the man he meant was Judge\nJeffreys.\n\n\"And when are you likely to see him, sir?\"\n\n\"Maybe in the spring, maybe not until summer, for I cannot go to London\non purpose, but when my business takes me there. Only remember my words,\nJack, and when you see the man I mean, look straight at him, and tell\nno lie. He will make some of your zany squires shake in their shoes, I\nreckon. Now, I have been in this lonely hole far longer than I intended,\nby reason of this outrage; yet I will stay here one day more upon a\ncertain condition.\"\n\n\"Upon what condition, Uncle Ben? I grieve that you find it so lonely. We\nwill have Farmer Nicholas up again, and the singers, and--\"\n\n\"The fashionable milkmaids. I thank you, let me be. The wenches are too\nloud for me. Your Nanny is enough. Nanny is a good child, and she shall\ncome and visit me.\" Uncle Reuben would always call her \"Nanny\"; he said\nthat \"Annie\" was too fine and Frenchified for us. \"But my condition is\nthis, Jack--that you shall guide me to-morrow, without a word to any\none, to a place where I may well descry the dwelling of these scoundrel\nDoones, and learn the best way to get at them, when the time shall come.\nCan you do this for me? I will pay you well, boy.\"\n\nI promised very readily to do my best to serve him, but, of course,\nwould take no money for it, not being so poor as that came to.\nAccordingly, on the day following, I managed to set the men at work on\nthe other side of the farm, especially that inquisitive and busybody\nJohn Fry, who would pry out almost anything for the pleasure of telling\nhis wife; and then, with Uncle Reuben mounted on my ancient Peggy, I\nmade foot for the westward, directly after breakfast. Uncle Ben refused\nto go unless I would take a loaded gun, and indeed it was always wise\nto do so in those days of turbulence; and none the less because of late\nmore than usual of our sheep had left their skins behind them. This, as\nI need hardly say, was not to be charged to the appetite of the Doones,\nfor they always said that they were not butchers (although upon that\nsubject might well be two opinions); and their practice was to make the\nshepherds kill and skin, and quarter for them, and sometimes carry to\nthe Doone-gate the prime among the fatlings, for fear of any bruising,\nwhich spoils the look at table. But the worst of it was that ignorant\nfolk, unaware of their fastidiousness, scored to them the sheep they\nlost by lower-born marauders, and so were afraid to speak of it: and the\nissue of this error was that a farmer, with five or six hundred sheep,\ncould never command, on his wedding-day, a prime saddle of mutton for\ndinner.\n\nTo return now to my Uncle Ben--and indeed he would not let me go more\nthan three land-yards from him--there was very little said between us\nalong the lane and across the hill, although the day was pleasant. I\ncould see that he was half amiss with his mind about the business,\nand not so full of security as an elderly man should keep himself.\nTherefore, out I spake, and said,--\n\n\"Uncle Reuben, have no fear. I know every inch of the ground, sir; and\nthere is no danger nigh us.\"\n\n\"Fear, boy! Who ever thought of fear? 'Tis the last thing would come\nacross me. Pretty things those primroses.\"\n\nAt once I thought of Lorna Doone, the little maid of six years back, and\nhow my fancy went with her. Could Lorna ever think of me? Was I not a\nlout gone by, only fit for loach-sticking? Had I ever seen a face fit to\nthink of near her? The sudden flash, the quickness, the bright desire to\nknow one's heart, and not withhold her own from it, the soft withdrawal\nof rich eyes, the longing to love somebody, anybody, anything, not\nimbrued with wickedness--\n\nMy uncle interrupted me, misliking so much silence now, with the\nnaked woods falling over us. For we were come to Bagworthy forest, the\nblackest and the loneliest place of all that keep the sun out. Even\nnow, in winter-time, with most of the wood unriddled, and the rest of it\npinched brown, it hung around us like a cloak containing little comfort.\nI kept quite close to Peggy's head, and Peggy kept quite close to me,\nand pricked her ears at everything. However, we saw nothing there,\nexcept a few old owls and hawks, and a magpie sitting all alone, until\nwe came to the bank of the hill, where the pony could not climb it.\nUncle Ben was very loath to get off, because the pony seemed company,\nand he thought he could gallop away on her, if the worst came to\nthe worst, but I persuaded him that now he must go to the end of it.\nTherefore he made Peggy fast, in a place where we could find her, and\nspeaking cheerfully as if there was nothing to be afraid of, he took his\nstaff, and I my gun, to climb the thick ascent.\n\nThere was now no path of any kind; which added to our courage all it\nlessened of our comfort, because it proved that the robbers were not in\nthe habit of passing there. And we knew that we could not go astray,\nso long as we breasted the hill before us; inasmuch as it formed the\nrampart, or side-fence of Glen Doone. But in truth I used the right word\nthere for the manner of our ascent, for the ground came forth so steep\nagainst us, and withal so woody, that to make any way we must throw\nourselves forward, and labour as at a breast-plough. Rough and loamy\nrungs of oak-root bulged here and there above our heads; briers needs\nmust speak with us, using more of tooth than tongue; and sometimes bulks\nof rugged stone, like great sheep, stood across us. At last, though very\nloath to do it, I was forced to leave my gun behind, because I required\none hand to drag myself up the difficulty, and one to help Uncle Reuben.\nAnd so at last we gained the top, and looked forth the edge of the\nforest, where the ground was very stony and like the crest of a quarry;\nand no more trees between us and the brink of cliff below, three hundred\nyards below it might be, all strong slope and gliddery. And now for the\nfirst time I was amazed at the appearance of the Doones's stronghold,\nand understood its nature. For when I had been even in the valley, and\nclimbed the cliffs to escape from it, about seven years agone, I was no\nmore than a stripling boy, noting little, as boys do, except for their\npresent purpose, and even that soon done with. But now, what with\nthe fame of the Doones, and my own recollections, and Uncle Ben's\ninsistence, all my attention was called forth, and the end was simple\nastonishment.\n\nThe chine of highland, whereon we stood, curved to the right and left\nof us, keeping about the same elevation, and crowned with trees and\nbrushwood. At about half a mile in front of us, but looking as if we\ncould throw a stone to strike any man upon it, another crest just like\nour own bowed around to meet it; but failed by reason of two narrow\nclefts of which we could only see the brink. One of these clefts was the\nDoone-gate, with a portcullis of rock above it, and the other was the\nchasm by which I had once made entrance. Betwixt them, where the hills\nfell back, as in a perfect oval, traversed by the winding water, lay a\nbright green valley, rimmed with sheer black rock, and seeming to have\nsunken bodily from the bleak rough heights above. It looked as if no\nfrost could enter neither wind go ruffling; only spring, and hope, and\ncomfort, breathe to one another. Even now the rays of sunshine dwelt and\nfell back on one another, whenever the clouds lifted; and the pale blue\nglimpse of the growing day seemed to find young encouragement.\n\nBut for all that, Uncle Reuben was none the worse nor better. He looked\ndown into Glen Doone first, and sniffed as if he were smelling it, like\na sample of goods from a wholesale house; and then he looked at the\nhills over yonder, and then he stared at me.\n\n\"See what a pack of fools they be?\"\n\n\"Of course I do, Uncle Ben. 'All rogues are fools,' was my first copy,\nbeginning of the alphabet.\"\n\n\"Pack of stuff lad. Though true enough, and very good for young people.\nBut see you not how this great Doone valley may be taken in half an\nhour?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure I do, uncle; if they like to give it up, I mean.\"\n\n\"Three culverins on yonder hill, and three on the top of this one, and\nwe have them under a pestle. Ah, I have seen the wars, my lad, from\nKeinton up to Naseby; and I might have been a general now, if they had\ntaken my advice--\"\n\nBut I was not attending to him, being drawn away on a sudden by a sight\nwhich never struck the sharp eyes of our General. For I had long ago\ndescried that little opening in the cliff through which I made my exit,\nas before related, on the other side of the valley. No bigger than a\nrabbit-hole it seemed from where we stood; and yet of all the scene\nbefore me, that (from my remembrance perhaps) had the most attraction.\nNow gazing at it with full thought of all that it had cost me, I saw a\nlittle figure come, and pause, and pass into it. Something very light\nand white, nimble, smooth, and elegant, gone almost before I knew that\nany one had been there. And yet my heart came to my ribs, and all my\nblood was in my face, and pride within me fought with shame, and vanity\nwith self-contempt; for though seven years were gone, and I from my\nboyhood come to manhood, and all must have forgotten me, and I had\nhalf-forgotten; at that moment, once for all, I felt that I was face to\nface with fate (however poor it might be), weal or woe, in Lorna Doone.\n\n[Illustration: 127.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nLORNA GROWING FORMIDABLE\n\n[Illustration: 128.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nHaving reconnoitred thus the position of the enemy, Master Huckaback, on\nthe homeward road, cross-examined me in a manner not at all desirable.\nFor he had noted my confusion and eager gaze at something unseen by\nhim in the valley, and thereupon he made up his mind to know everything\nabout it. In this, however, he partly failed; for although I was no hand\nat fence, and would not tell him a falsehood, I managed so to hold my\npeace that he put himself upon the wrong track, and continued thereon\nwith many vaunts of his shrewdness and experience, and some chuckles at\nmy simplicity. Thus much however, he learned aright, that I had been in\nthe Doone valley several years before, and might be brought upon strong\ninducement to venture there again. But as to the mode of my getting in,\nthe things I saw, and my thoughts upon them, he not only failed to learn\nthe truth, but certified himself into an obstinacy of error, from which\nno after-knowledge was able to deliver him. And this he did, not only\nbecause I happened to say very little, but forasmuch as he disbelieved\nhalf of the truth I told him, through his own too great sagacity.\n\nUpon one point, however, he succeeded more easily than he expected,\nviz. in making me promise to visit the place again, as soon as occasion\noffered, and to hold my own counsel about it. But I could not help\nsmiling at one thing, that according to his point of view my own counsel\nmeant my own and Master Reuben Huckaback's.\n\nNow he being gone, as he went next day, to his favourite town of\nDulverton, and leaving behind him shadowy promise of the mountains he\nwould do for me, my spirit began to burn and pant for something to go on\nwith; and nothing showed a braver hope of movement and adventure than a\nlonely visit to Glen Doone, by way of the perilous passage discovered in\nmy boyhood. Therefore I waited for nothing more than the slow arrival of\nnew small-clothes made by a good tailor at Porlock, for I was wishful\nto look my best; and when they were come and approved, I started,\nregardless of the expense, and forgetting (like a fool) how badly they\nwould take the water.\n\nWhat with urging of the tailor, and my own misgivings, the time was now\ncome round again to the high-day of St. Valentine, when all our maids\nwere full of lovers, and all the lads looked foolish. And none of them\nmore sheepish or innocent than I myself, albeit twenty-one years old,\nand not afraid of men much, but terrified of women, at least, if they\nwere comely. And what of all things scared me most was the thought of\nmy own size, and knowledge of my strength, which came like knots upon\nme daily. In honest truth I tell this thing, (which often since hath\npuzzled me, when I came to mix with men more), I was to that degree\nashamed of my thickness and my stature, in the presence of a woman,\nthat I would not put a trunk of wood on the fire in the kitchen, but\nlet Annie scold me well, with a smile to follow, and with her own plump\nhands lift up a little log, and fuel it. Many a time I longed to be no\nbigger than John Fry was; whom now (when insolent) I took with my left\nhand by the waist-stuff, and set him on my hat, and gave him little\nchance to tread it; until he spoke of his family, and requested to come\ndown again.\n\n[Illustration: 129.jpg Let Annie scold me well]\n\nNow taking for good omen this, that I was a seven-year Valentine, though\nmuch too big for a Cupidon, I chose a seven-foot staff of ash, and fixed\na loach-fork in it, to look as I had looked before; and leaving word\nupon matters of business, out of the back door I went, and so through\nthe little orchard, and down the brawling Lynn-brook. Not being now\nso much afraid, I struck across the thicket land between the meeting\nwaters, and came upon the Bagworthy stream near the great black\nwhirlpool. Nothing amazed me so much as to find how shallow the stream\nnow looked to me, although the pool was still as black and greedy as it\nused to be. And still the great rocky slide was dark and difficult to\nclimb; though the water, which once had taken my knees, was satisfied\nnow with my ankles. After some labour, I reached the top; and halted to\nlook about me well, before trusting to broad daylight.\n\nThe winter (as I said before) had been a very mild one; and now the\nspring was toward so that bank and bush were touched with it. The valley\ninto which I gazed was fair with early promise, having shelter from the\nwind and taking all the sunshine. The willow-bushes over the stream\nhung as if they were angling with tasseled floats of gold and silver,\nbursting like a bean-pod. Between them came the water laughing, like\na maid at her own dancing, and spread with that young blue which never\nlives beyond the April. And on either bank, the meadow ruffled as\nthe breeze came by, opening (through new tuft, of green) daisy-bud or\ncelandine, or a shy glimpse now and then of the love-lorn primrose.\n\n[Illustration: 131.jpg The meadow ruffled in the breeze]\n\nThough I am so blank of wit, or perhaps for that same reason, these\nlittle things come and dwell with me, and I am happy about them, and\nlong for nothing better. I feel with every blade of grass, as if it had\na history; and make a child of every bud as though it knew and loved me.\nAnd being so, they seem to tell me of my own delusions, how I am no more\nthan they, except in self-importance.\n\nWhile I was forgetting much of many things that harm one, and letting of\nmy thoughts go wild to sounds and sights of nature, a sweeter note than\nthrush or ouzel ever wooed a mate in, floated on the valley breeze at\nthe quiet turn of sundown. The words were of an ancient song, fit to\nlaugh or cry at.\n\n[Illustration: 132.jpg Willow-Bushes over the stream]\n\n    \"Love, an if there be one,\n     Come my love to be,\n     My love is for the one\n     Loving unto me.\n\n     Not for me the show, love,\n     Of a gilded bliss;\n     Only thou must know, love,\n     What my value is.\n\n     If in all the earth, love,\n     Thou hast none but me,\n     This shall be my worth, love:\n     To be cheap to thee.\n\n     But, if so thou ever\n     Strivest to be free,\n     'Twill be my endeavour\n     To be dear to thee.\n\n     So shall I have plea, love,\n     Is thy heart and breath\n     Clinging still to thee, love,\n     In the doom of death.\"\n\nAll this I took in with great eagerness, not for the sake of the meaning\n(which is no doubt an allegory), but for the power and richness, and\nsoftness of the singing, which seemed to me better than we ever had even\nin Oare church. But all the time I kept myself in a black niche of the\nrock, where the fall of the water began, lest the sweet singer (espying\nme) should be alarmed, and flee away. But presently I ventured to look\nforth where a bush was; and then I beheld the loveliest sight--one\nglimpse of which was enough to make me kneel in the coldest water.\n\nBy the side of the stream she was coming to me, even among the\nprimroses, as if she loved them all; and every flower looked the\nbrighter, as her eyes were on them, I could not see what her face was,\nmy heart so awoke and trembled; only that her hair was flowing from\na wreath of white violets, and the grace of her coming was like the\nappearance of the first wind-flower. The pale gleam over the western\ncliffs threw a shadow of light behind her, as if the sun were lingering.\nNever do I see that light from the closing of the west, even in these my\naged days, without thinking of her. Ah me, if it comes to that, what do\nI see of earth or heaven, without thinking of her?\n\nThe tremulous thrill of her song was hanging on her open lips; and she\nglanced around, as if the birds were accustomed to make answer. To me it\nwas a thing of terror to behold such beauty, and feel myself the while\nto be so very low and common. But scarcely knowing what I did, as if\na rope were drawing me, I came from the dark mouth of the chasm; and\nstood, afraid to look at her.\n\nShe was turning to fly, not knowing me, and frightened, perhaps, at\nmy stature, when I fell on the grass (as I fell before her seven years\nagone that day), and I just said, \"Lorna Doone!\"\n\nShe knew me at once, from my manner and ways, and a smile broke through\nher trembling, as sunshine comes through aspen-leaves; and being so\nclever, she saw, of course, that she needed not to fear me.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" she cried, with a feint of anger (because she had shown\nher cowardice, and yet in her heart she was laughing); \"oh, if you\nplease, who are you, sir, and how do you know my name?\"\n\n\"I am John Ridd,\" I answered; \"the boy who gave you those beautiful\nfish, when you were only a little thing, seven years ago to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes, the poor boy who was frightened so, and obliged to hide here in\nthe water.\"\n\n\"And do you remember how kind you were, and saved my life by your\nquickness, and went away riding upon a great man's shoulder, as if you\nhad never seen me, and yet looked back through the willow-trees?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember everything; because it was so rare to see any\nexcept--I mean because I happen to remember. But you seem not to\nremember, sir, how perilous this place is.\"\n\nFor she had kept her eyes upon me; large eyes of a softness, a\nbrightness, and a dignity which made me feel as if I must for ever love\nand yet for ever know myself unworthy. Unless themselves should fill\nwith love, which is the spring of all things. And so I could not answer\nher, but was overcome with thinking and feeling and confusion. Neither\ncould I look again; only waited for the melody which made every word\nlike a poem to me, the melody of her voice. But she had not the least\nidea of what was going on with me, any more than I myself had.\n\n\"I think, Master Ridd, you cannot know,\" she said, with her eyes taken\nfrom me, \"what the dangers of this place are, and the nature of the\npeople.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know enough of that; and I am frightened greatly, all the time,\nwhen I do not look at you.\"\n\nShe was too young to answer me in the style some maidens would have\nused; the manner, I mean, which now we call from a foreign word\n\"coquettish.\" And more than that, she was trembling from real fear of\nviolence, lest strong hands might be laid on me, and a miserable end\nof it. And to tell the truth, I grew afraid; perhaps from a kind of\nsympathy, and because I knew that evil comes more readily than good to\nus.\n\nTherefore, without more ado, or taking any advantage--although I would\nhave been glad at heart, if needs had been, to kiss her (without any\nthought of rudeness)--it struck me that I had better go, and have no\nmore to say to her until next time of coming. So would she look the more\nfor me and think the more about me, and not grow weary of my words and\nthe want of change there is in me. For, of course, I knew what a churl I\nwas compared to her birth and appearance; but meanwhile I might improve\nmyself and learn a musical instrument. \"The wind hath a draw after\nflying straw\" is a saying we have in Devonshire, made, peradventure, by\nsomebody who had seen the ways of women.\n\n\"Mistress Lorna, I will depart\"--mark you, I thought that a powerful\nword--\"in fear of causing disquiet. If any rogue shot me it would grieve\nyou; I make bold to say it, and it would be the death of mother. Few\nmothers have such a son as me. Try to think of me now and then, and I\nwill bring you some new-laid eggs, for our young blue hen is beginning.\"\n\n\"I thank you heartily,\" said Lorna; \"but you need not come to see me.\nYou can put them in my little bower, where I am almost always--I mean\nwhither daily I repair to read and to be away from them.\"\n\n\"Only show me where it is. Thrice a day I will come and stop--\"\n\n\"Nay, Master Ridd, I would never show thee--never, because of\nperil--only that so happens it thou hast found the way already.\"\n\nAnd she smiled with a light that made me care to cry out for no other\nway, except to her dear heart. But only to myself I cried for anything\nat all, having enough of man in me to be bashful with young maidens. So\nI touched her white hand softly when she gave it to me, and (fancying\nthat she had sighed) was touched at heart about it, and resolved to\nyield her all my goods, although my mother was living; and then grew\nangry with myself (for a mile or more of walking) to think she would\ncondescend so; and then, for the rest of the homeward road, was mad with\nevery man in the world who would dare to think of having her.\n\n[Illustration: 136.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nJOHN IS BEWITCHED\n\n[Illustration: 137.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nTo forget one's luck of life, to forget the cark of care and withering\nof young fingers; not to feel, or not be moved by, all the change of\nthought and heart, from large young heat to the sinewy lines and dry\nbones of old age--this is what I have to do ere ever I can make you\nknow (even as a dream is known) how I loved my Lorna. I myself can never\nknow; never can conceive, or treat it as a thing of reason, never can\nbehold myself dwelling in the midst of it, and think that this was I;\nneither can I wander far from perpetual thought of it. Perhaps I have\ntwo farrows of pigs ready for the chapman; perhaps I have ten stones\nof wool waiting for the factor. It is all the same. I look at both, and\nwhat I say to myself is this: \"Which would Lorna choose of them?\" Of\ncourse, I am a fool for this; any man may call me so, and I will not\nquarrel with him, unless he guess my secret. Of course, I fetch my wit,\nif it be worth the fetching, back again to business. But there my heart\nis and must be; and all who like to try can cheat me, except upon parish\nmatters.\n\nThat week I could do little more than dream and dream and rove about,\nseeking by perpetual change to find the way back to myself. I cared\nnot for the people round me, neither took delight in victuals; but made\nbelieve to eat and drink and blushed at any questions. And being called\nthe master now, head-farmer, and chief yeoman, it irked me much that any\none should take advantage of me; yet everybody did so as soon as ever it\nwas known that my wits were gone moon-raking. For that was the way\nthey looked at it, not being able to comprehend the greatness and the\nloftiness. Neither do I blame them much; for the wisest thing is to\nlaugh at people when we cannot understand them. I, for my part, took no\nnotice; but in my heart despised them as beings of a lesser nature, who\nnever had seen Lorna. Yet I was vexed, and rubbed myself, when John Fry\nspread all over the farm, and even at the shoeing forge, that a mad dog\nhad come and bitten me, from the other side of Mallond.\n\nThis seems little to me now; and so it might to any one; but, at the\ntime, it worked me up to a fever of indignity. To make a mad dog of\nLorna, to compare all my imaginings (which were strange, I do assure\nyou--the faculty not being apt to work), to count the raising of my soul\nno more than hydrophobia! All this acted on me so, that I gave John Fry\nthe soundest threshing that ever a sheaf of good corn deserved, or a\nbundle of tares was blessed with. Afterwards he went home, too tired\nto tell his wife the meaning of it; but it proved of service to both of\nthem, and an example for their children.\n\nNow the climate of this country is--so far as I can make of it--to throw\nno man into extremes; and if he throw himself so far, to pluck him\nback by change of weather and the need of looking after things. Lest we\nshould be like the Southerns, for whom the sky does everything, and men\nsit under a wall and watch both food and fruit come beckoning. Their sky\nis a mother to them; but ours a good stepmother to us--fearing to\nhurt by indulgence, and knowing that severity and change of mood are\nwholesome.\n\nThe spring being now too forward, a check to it was needful; and in the\nearly part of March there came a change of weather. All the young growth\nwas arrested by a dry wind from the east, which made both face\nand fingers burn when a man was doing ditching. The lilacs and the\nwoodbines, just crowding forth in little tufts, close kernelling their\nblossom, were ruffled back, like a sleeve turned up, and nicked with\nbrown at the corners. In the hedges any man, unless his eyes were very\ndull, could see the mischief doing. The russet of the young elm-bloom\nwas fain to be in its scale again; but having pushed forth, there must\nbe, and turn to a tawny colour. The hangers of the hazel, too, having\nshed their dust to make the nuts, did not spread their little combs and\ndry them, as they ought to do; but shrivelled at the base and fell, as\nif a knife had cut them. And more than all to notice was (at least about\nthe hedges) the shuddering of everything and the shivering sound among\nthem toward the feeble sun; such as we make to a poor fireplace when\nseveral doors are open. Sometimes I put my face to warm against the\nsoft, rough maple-stem, which feels like the foot of a red deer; but the\npitiless east wind came through all, and took and shook the caved\nhedge aback till its knees were knocking together, and nothing could\nbe shelter. Then would any one having blood, and trying to keep at home\nwith it, run to a sturdy tree and hope to eat his food behind it, and\nlook for a little sun to come and warm his feet in the shelter. And if\nit did he might strike his breast, and try to think he was warmer.\n\nBut when a man came home at night, after long day's labour, knowing\nthat the days increased, and so his care should multiply; still he found\nenough of light to show him what the day had done against him in\nhis garden. Every ridge of new-turned earth looked like an old man's\nmuscles, honeycombed, and standing out void of spring, and powdery.\nEvery plant that had rejoiced in passing such a winter now was cowering,\nturned away, unfit to meet the consequence. Flowing sap had stopped its\ncourse; fluted lines showed want of food, and if you pinched the topmost\nspray, there was no rebound or firmness.\n\nWe think a good deal, in a quiet way, when people ask us about them--of\nsome fine, upstanding pear-trees, grafted by my grandfather, who had\nbeen very greatly respected. And he got those grafts by sheltering a\npoor Italian soldier, in the time of James the First, a man who never\ncould do enough to show his grateful memories. How he came to our place\nis a very difficult story, which I never understood rightly, having\nheard it from my mother. At any rate, there the pear-trees were, and\nthere they are to this very day; and I wish every one could taste their\nfruit, old as they are, and rugged.\n\nNow these fine trees had taken advantage of the west winds, and the\nmoisture, and the promise of the spring time, so as to fill the tips of\nthe spray-wood and the rowels all up the branches with a crowd of eager\nblossom. Not that they were yet in bloom, nor even showing whiteness,\nonly that some of the cones were opening at the side of the cap which\npinched them; and there you might count perhaps, a dozen nobs, like very\nlittle buttons, but grooved, and lined, and huddling close, to make room\nfor one another. And among these buds were gray-green blades, scarce\nbigger than a hair almost, yet curving so as if their purpose was to\nshield the blossom.\n\nOther of the spur-points, standing on the older wood where the sap was\nnot so eager, had not burst their tunic yet, but were flayed and flaked\nwith light, casting off the husk of brown in three-cornered patches, as\nI have seen a Scotchman's plaid, or as his legs shows through it. These\nbuds, at a distance, looked as if the sky had been raining cream upon\nthem.\n\nNow all this fair delight to the eyes, and good promise to the palate,\nwas marred and baffled by the wind and cutting of the night-frosts. The\nopening cones were struck with brown, in between the button buds, and\non the scapes that shielded them; while the foot part of the cover hung\nlike rags, peeled back, and quivering. And there the little stalk of\neach, which might have been a pear, God willing, had a ring around its\nbase, and sought a chance to drop and die. The others which had not\nopened comb, but only prepared to do it, were a little better off, but\nstill very brown and unkid, and shrivelling in doubt of health, and\nneither peart nor lusty.\n\nNow this I have not told because I know the way to do it, for that I do\nnot, neither yet have seen a man who did know. It is wonderful how\nwe look at things, and never think to notice them; and I am as bad as\nanybody, unless the thing to be observed is a dog, or a horse, or a\nmaiden. And the last of those three I look at, somehow, without knowing\nthat I take notice, and greatly afraid to do it, only I knew afterwards\n(when the time of life was in me), not indeed, what the maiden was like,\nbut how she differed from others.\n\nYet I have spoken about the spring, and the failure of fair promise,\nbecause I took it to my heart as token of what would come to me in the\nbudding of my years and hope. And even then, being much possessed, and\nfull of a foolish melancholy, I felt a sad delight at being doomed to\nblight and loneliness; not but that I managed still (when mother\nwas urgent upon me) to eat my share of victuals, and cuff a man for\nlaziness, and see that a ploughshare made no leaps, and sleep of a night\nwithout dreaming. And my mother half-believing, in her fondness and\naffection, that what the parish said was true about a mad dog having\nbitten me, and yet arguing that it must be false (because God would have\nprevented him), my mother gave me little rest, when I was in the room\nwith her. Not that she worried me with questions, nor openly regarded\nme with any unusual meaning, but that I knew she was watching slyly\nwhenever I took a spoon up; and every hour or so she managed to place a\npan of water by me, quite as if by accident, and sometimes even to spill\na little upon my shoe or coat-sleeve. But Betty Muxworthy was worst;\nfor, having no fear about my health, she made a villainous joke of it,\nand used to rush into the kitchen, barking like a dog, and panting,\nexclaiming that I had bitten her, and justice she would have on me, if\nit cost her a twelvemonth's wages. And she always took care to do this\nthing just when I had crossed my legs in the corner after supper, and\nleaned my head against the oven, to begin to think of Lorna.\n\nHowever, in all things there is comfort, if we do not look too hard\nfor it; and now I had much satisfaction, in my uncouth state, from\nlabouring, by the hour together, at the hedging and the ditching,\nmeeting the bitter wind face to face, feeling my strength increase, and\nhoping that some one would be proud of it. In the rustling rush of\nevery gust, in the graceful bend of every tree, even in the \"lords and\nladies,\" clumped in the scoops of the hedgerow, and most of all in the\nsoft primrose, wrung by the wind, but stealing back, and smiling when\nthe wrath was passed--in all of these, and many others there was aching\necstasy, delicious pang of Lorna.\n\nBut however cold the weather was, and however hard the wind blew, one\nthing (more than all the rest) worried and perplexed me. This was, that\nI could not settle, turn and twist as I might, how soon I ought to go\nagain upon a visit to Glen Doone. For I liked not at all the falseness\nof it (albeit against murderers), the creeping out of sight, and hiding,\nand feeling as a spy might. And even more than this. I feared how Lorna\nmight regard it; whether I might seem to her a prone and blunt intruder,\na country youth not skilled in manners, as among the quality, even when\nthey rob us. For I was not sure myself, but that it might be very bad\nmanners to go again too early without an invitation; and my hands and\nface were chapped so badly by the bitter wind, that Lorna might count\nthem unsightly things, and wish to see no more of them.\n\nHowever, I could not bring myself to consult any one upon this point, at\nleast in our own neighbourhood, nor even to speak of it near home. But\nthe east wind holding through the month, my hands and face growing worse\nand worse, and it having occurred to me by this time that possibly Lorna\nmight have chaps, if she came abroad at all, and so might like to talk\nabout them and show her little hands to me, I resolved to take another\nopinion, so far as might be upon this matter, without disclosing the\ncircumstances.\n\nNow the wisest person in all our parts was reckoned to be a certain wise\nwoman, well known all over Exmoor by the name of Mother Melldrum. Her\nreal name was Maple Durham, as I learned long afterwards; and she came\nof an ancient family, but neither of Devon nor Somerset. Nevertheless\nshe was quite at home with our proper modes of divination; and knowing\nthat we liked them best--as each man does his own religion--she would\nalways practise them for the people of the country. And all the while,\nshe would let us know that she kept a higher and nobler mode for those\nwho looked down upon this one, not having been bred and born to it.\n\n[Illustration: 142.jpg Mother Melldrum]\n\nMother Melldrum had two houses, or rather she had none at all, but two\nhomes wherein to find her, according to the time of year. In summer she\nlived in a pleasant cave, facing the cool side of the hill, far inland\nnear Hawkridge and close above Tarr-steps, a wonderful crossing of Barle\nriver, made (as everybody knows) by Satan, for a wager. But throughout\nthe winter, she found sea-air agreeable, and a place where things could\nbe had on credit, and more occasion of talking. Not but what she could\nhave credit (for every one was afraid of her) in the neighbourhood of\nTarr-steps; only there was no one handy owning things worth taking.\n\nTherefore, at the fall of the leaf, when the woods grew damp and\nirksome, the wise woman always set her face to the warmer cliffs of the\nChannel; where shelter was, and dry fern bedding, and folk to be seen in\nthe distance, from a bank upon which the sun shone. And there, as I\nknew from our John Fry (who had been to her about rheumatism, and sheep\npossessed with an evil spirit, and warts on the hand of his son, young\nJohn), any one who chose might find her, towards the close of a winter\nday, gathering sticks and brown fern for fuel, and talking to herself\nthe while, in a hollow stretch behind the cliffs; which foreigners, who\ncome and go without seeing much of Exmoor, have called the Valley of\nRocks.\n\n[Illustration: 143.jpg Tarr-Steps]\n\nThis valley, or goyal, as we term it, being small for a valley, lies to\nthe west of Linton, about a mile from the town perhaps, and away towards\nLey Manor. Our homefolk always call it the Danes, or the Denes, which is\nno more, they tell me, than a hollow place, even as the word \"den\" is.\nHowever, let that pass, for I know very little about it; but the place\nitself is a pretty one, though nothing to frighten anybody, unless he\nhath lived in a gallipot. It is a green rough-sided hollow, bending\nat the middle, touched with stone at either crest, and dotted here and\nthere with slabs in and out the brambles. On the right hand is an upward\ncrag, called by some the Castle, easy enough to scale, and giving great\nview of the Channel. Facing this, from the inland side and the elbow of\nthe valley, a queer old pile of rock arises, bold behind one another,\nand quite enough to affright a man, if it only were ten times larger.\nThis is called the Devil's Cheese-ring, or the Devil's Cheese-knife,\nwhich mean the same thing, as our fathers were used to eat their cheese\nfrom a scoop; and perhaps in old time the upmost rock (which has fallen\naway since I knew it) was like to such an implement, if Satan eat cheese\nuntoasted.\n\nBut all the middle of this valley was a place to rest in; to sit and\nthink that troubles were not, if we would not make them. To know the sea\noutside the hills, but never to behold it; only by the sound of waves to\npity sailors labouring. Then to watch the sheltered sun, coming warmly\nround the turn, like a guest expected, full of gentle glow and gladness,\ncasting shadow far away as a thing to hug itself, and awakening life\nfrom dew, and hope from every spreading bud. And then to fall asleep and\ndream that the fern was all asparagus.\n\nAlas, I was too young in those days much to care for creature comforts,\nor to let pure palate have things that would improve it. Anything went\ndown with me, as it does with most of us. Too late we know the good from\nbad; the knowledge is no pleasure then; being memory's medicine rather\nthan the wine of hope.\n\nNow Mother Melldrum kept her winter in this vale of rocks, sheltering\nfrom the wind and rain within the Devil's Cheese-ring, which added\ngreatly to her fame because all else, for miles around, were afraid to\ngo near it after dark, or even on a gloomy day. Under eaves of lichened\nrock she had a winding passage, which none that ever I knew of durst\nenter but herself. And to this place I went to seek her, in spite of all\nmisgivings, upon a Sunday in Lenten season, when the sheep were folded.\n\nOur parson (as if he had known my intent) had preached a beautiful\nsermon about the Witch of Endor, and the perils of them that meddle\nwantonly with the unseen Powers; and therein he referred especially to\nthe strange noise in the neighbourhood, and upbraided us for want of\nfaith, and many other backslidings. We listened to him very earnestly,\nfor we like to hear from our betters about things that are beyond us,\nand to be roused up now and then, like sheep with a good dog after them,\nwho can pull some wool without biting. Nevertheless we could not see how\nour want of faith could have made that noise, especially at night time,\nnotwithstanding which we believed it, and hoped to do a little better.\n\nAnd so we all came home from church; and most of the people dined with\nus, as they always do on Sundays, because of the distance to go home,\nwith only words inside them. The parson, who always sat next to mother,\nwas afraid that he might have vexed us, and would not have the best\npiece of meat, according to his custom. But soon we put him at his ease,\nand showed him we were proud of him; and then he made no more to do, but\naccepted the best of the sirloin.\n\n[Illustration: 145.jpg The Devil's Cheese-wring]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nWITCHERY LEADS TO WITCHCRAFT\n\n[Illustration: 146.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAlthough wellnigh the end of March, the wind blew wild and piercing,\nas I went on foot that afternoon to Mother Melldrum's dwelling. It was\nsafer not to take a horse, lest (if anything vexed her) she should put\na spell upon him; as had been done to Farmer Snowe's stable by the wise\nwoman of Simonsbath.\n\nThe sun was low on the edge of the hills by the time I entered the\nvalley, for I could not leave home till the cattle were tended, and\nthe distance was seven miles or more. The shadows of rocks fell far and\ndeep, and the brown dead fern was fluttering, and brambles with their\nsere leaves hanging, swayed their tatters to and fro, with a red look on\nthem. In patches underneath the crags, a few wild goats were browsing;\nthen they tossed their horns, and fled, and leaped on ledges, and stared\nat me. Moreover, the sound of the sea came up, and went the length of\nthe valley, and there it lapped on a butt of rocks, and murmured like a\nshell.\n\nTaking things one with another, and feeling all the lonesomeness, and\nhaving no stick with me, I was much inclined to go briskly back,\nand come at a better season. And when I beheld a tall grey shape, of\nsomething or another, moving at the lower end of the valley, where the\nshade was, it gave me such a stroke of fear, after many others, that my\nthumb which lay in mother's Bible (brought in my big pocket for the sake\nof safety) shook so much that it came out, and I could not get it in\nagain. \"This serves me right,\" I said to myself, \"for tampering with\nBeelzebub. Oh that I had listened to parson!\"\n\nAnd thereupon I struck aside; not liking to run away quite, as some\npeople might call it; but seeking to look like a wanderer who was come\nto see the valley, and had seen almost enough of it. Herein I should\nhave succeeded, and gone home, and then been angry at my want of\ncourage, but that on the very turn and bending of my footsteps, the\nwoman in the distance lifted up her staff to me, so that I was bound to\nstop.\n\nAnd now, being brought face to face, by the will of God (as one might\nsay) with anything that might come of it, I kept myself quite straight\nand stiff, and thrust away all white feather, trusting in my Bible\nstill, hoping that it would protect me, though I had disobeyed it. But\nupon that remembrance, my conscience took me by the leg, so that I could\nnot go forward.\n\nAll this while, the fearful woman was coming near and more near to me;\nand I was glad to sit down on a rock because my knees were shaking so. I\ntried to think of many things, but none of them would come to me; and I\ncould not take my eyes away, though I prayed God to be near me.\n\nBut when she was come so nigh to me that I could descry her features,\nthere was something in her countenance that made me not dislike her. She\nlooked as if she had been visited by many troubles, and had felt them\none by one, yet held enough of kindly nature still to grieve for others.\nLong white hair, on either side, was falling down below her chin; and\nthrough her wrinkles clear bright eyes seemed to spread themselves upon\nme. Though I had plenty of time to think, I was taken by surprise no\nless, and unable to say anything; yet eager to hear the silence broken,\nand longing for a noise or two.\n\n\"Thou art not come to me,\" she said, looking through my simple face, as\nif it were but glass, \"to be struck for bone-shave, nor to be blessed\nfor barn-gun. Give me forth thy hand, John Ridd; and tell why thou art\ncome to me.\"\n\nBut I was so much amazed at her knowing my name and all about me, that I\nfeared to place my hand in her power, or even my tongue by speaking.\n\n\"Have no fear of me, my son; I have no gift to harm thee; and if I had,\nit should be idle. Now, if thou hast any wit, tell me why I love thee.\"\n\n\"I never had any wit, mother,\" I answered in our Devonshire way; \"and\nnever set eyes on thee before, to the furthest of my knowledge.\"\n\n\"And yet I know thee as well, John, as if thou wert my grandson.\nRemember you the old Oare oak, and the bog at the head of Exe, and the\nchild who would have died there, but for thy strength and courage, and\nmost of all thy kindness? That was my granddaughter, John; and all I\nhave on earth to love.\"\n\nNow that she came to speak of it, with the place and that, so clearly, I\nremembered all about it (a thing that happened last August), and thought\nhow stupid I must have been not to learn more of the little girl who had\nfallen into the black pit, with a basketful of whortleberries, and\nwho might have been gulfed if her little dog had not spied me in the\ndistance. I carried her on my back to mother; and then we dressed her\nall anew, and took her where she ordered us; but she did not tell us\nwho she was, nor anything more than her Christian name, and that she was\neight years old, and fond of fried batatas. And we did not seek to ask\nher more; as our manner is with visitors.\n\nBut thinking of this little story, and seeing how she looked at me, I\nlost my fear of Mother Melldrum, and began to like her; partly because I\nhad helped her grandchild, and partly that if she were so wise, no need\nwould have been for me to save the little thing from drowning. Therefore\nI stood up and said, though scarcely yet established in my power against\nhers,--\n\n\"Good mother, the shoe she lost was in the mire, and not with us. And we\ncould not match it, although we gave her a pair of sister Lizzie's.\"\n\n\"My son, what care I for her shoe? How simple thou art, and foolish!\naccording to the thoughts of some. Now tell me, for thou canst not lie,\nwhat has brought thee to me.\"\n\nBeing so ashamed and bashful, I was half-inclined to tell her a lie,\nuntil she said that I could not do it; and then I knew that I could not.\n\n\"I am come to know,\" I said, looking at a rock the while, to keep my\nvoice from shaking, \"when I may go to see Lorna Doone.\"\n\nNo more could I say, though my mind was charged to ask fifty other\nquestions. But although I looked away, it was plain that I had asked\nenough. I felt that the wise woman gazed at me in wrath as well as\nsorrow; and then I grew angry that any one should seem to make light of\nLorna.\n\n\"John Ridd,\" said the woman, observing this (for now I faced her\nbravely), \"of whom art thou speaking? Is it a child of the men who slew\nyour father?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell, mother. How should I know? And what is that to thee?\"\n\n\"It is something to thy mother, John, and something to thyself, I trow;\nand nothing worse could befall thee.\"\n\nI waited for her to speak again, because she had spoken so sadly that it\ntook my breath away.\n\n\"John Ridd, if thou hast any value for thy body or thy soul, thy mother,\nor thy father's name, have nought to do with any Doone.\"\n\nShe gazed at me in earnest so, and raised her voice in saying it, until\nthe whole valley, curving like a great bell echoed \"Doone,\" that it\nseemed to me my heart was gone for every one and everything. If it were\nGod's will for me to have no more of Lorna, let a sign come out of the\nrocks, and I would try to believe it. But no sign came, and I turned to\nthe woman, and longed that she had been a man.\n\n\"You poor thing, with bones and blades, pails of water, and door-keys,\nwhat know you about the destiny of a maiden such as Lorna? Chilblains\nyou may treat, and bone-shave, ringworm, and the scaldings; even scabby\nsheep may limp the better for your strikings. John the Baptist and his\ncousins, with the wool and hyssop, are for mares, and ailing dogs, and\nfowls that have the jaundice. Look at me now, Mother Melldrum, am I like\na fool?\"\n\n\"That thou art, my son. Alas that it were any other! Now behold the end\nof that; John Ridd, mark the end of it.\"\n\nShe pointed to the castle-rock, where upon a narrow shelf, betwixt us\nand the coming stars, a bitter fight was raging. A fine fat sheep, with\nan honest face, had clomb up very carefully to browse on a bit of juicy\ngrass, now the dew of the land was upon it. To him, from an upper crag,\na lean black goat came hurrying, with leaps, and skirmish of the horns,\nand an angry noise in his nostrils. The goat had grazed the place\nbefore, to the utmost of his liking, cropping in and out with jerks, as\ntheir manner is of feeding. Nevertheless he fell on the sheep with fury\nand great malice.\n\nThe simple wether was much inclined to retire from the contest, but\nlooked around in vain for any way to peace and comfort. His enemy stood\nbetween him and the last leap he had taken; there was nothing left him\nbut to fight, or be hurled into the sea, five hundred feet below.\n\n\"Lie down, lie down!\" I shouted to him, as if he were a dog, for I had\nseen a battle like this before, and knew that the sheep had no chance of\nlife except from his greater weight, and the difficulty of moving him.\n\n[Illustration: 150.jpg \"Lie down!\" I shouted]\n\n\"Lie down, lie down, John Ridd!\" cried Mother Melldrum, mocking me, but\nwithout a sign of smiling.\n\nThe poor sheep turned, upon my voice, and looked at me so piteously that\nI could look no longer; but ran with all my speed to try and save him\nfrom the combat. He saw that I could not be in time, for the goat was\nbucking to leap at him, and so the good wether stooped his forehead,\nwith the harmless horns curling aside of it; and the goat flung his\nheels up, and rushed at him, with quick sharp jumps and tricks of\nmovement, and the points of his long horns always foremost, and his\nlittle scut cocked like a gun-hammer.\n\nAs I ran up the steep of the rock, I could not see what they were doing,\nbut the sheep must have fought very bravely at last, and yielded his\nground quite slowly, and I hoped almost to save him. But just as my head\ntopped the platform of rock, I saw him flung from it backward, with a\nsad low moan and a gurgle. His body made quite a short noise in the air,\nlike a bucket thrown down a well shaft, and I could not tell when it\nstruck the water, except by the echo among the rocks. So wroth was I\nwith the goat at the moment (being somewhat scant of breath and unable\nto consider), that I caught him by the right hind-leg, before he could\nturn from his victory, and hurled him after the sheep, to learn how he\nliked his own compulsion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS INTERVIEW\n\n[Illustration: 152.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAlthough I left the Denes at once, having little heart for further\nquestions of the wise woman, and being afraid to visit her house under\nthe Devil's Cheese-ring (to which she kindly invited me), and although\nI ran most part of the way, it was very late for farm-house time upon\na Sunday evening before I was back at Plover's Barrows. My mother had\ngreat desire to know all about the matter; but I could not reconcile it\nwith my respect so to frighten her. Therefore I tried to sleep it off,\nkeeping my own counsel; and when that proved of no avail, I strove to\nwork it away, it might be, by heavy outdoor labour, and weariness, and\ngood feeding. These indeed had some effect, and helped to pass a week or\ntwo, with more pain of hand than heart to me.\n\n[Illustration: 153.jpg Fields spread with growth]\n\nBut when the weather changed in earnest, and the frost was gone, and\nthe south-west wind blew softly, and the lambs were at play with the\ndaisies, it was more than I could do to keep from thought of Lorna.\nFor now the fields were spread with growth, and the waters clad with\nsunshine, and light and shadow, step by step, wandered over the furzy\ncleves. All the sides of the hilly wood were gathered in and out with\ngreen, silver-grey, or russet points, according to the several manner of\nthe trees beginning. And if one stood beneath an elm, with any heart to\nlook at it, lo! all the ground was strewn with flakes (too small to know\ntheir meaning), and all the sprays above were rasped and trembling with\na redness. And so I stopped beneath the tree, and carved L.D. upon it,\nand wondered at the buds of thought that seemed to swell inside me.\n\nThe upshot of it all was this, that as no Lorna came to me, except in\ndreams or fancy, and as my life was not worth living without constant\nsign of her, forth I must again to find her, and say more than a man can\ntell. Therefore, without waiting longer for the moving of the spring,\ndressed I was in grand attire (so far as I had gotten it), and thinking\nmy appearance good, although with doubts about it (being forced to\ndress in the hay-tallat), round the corner of the wood-stack went I very\nknowingly--for Lizzie's eyes were wondrous sharp--and then I was sure of\nmeeting none who would care or dare to speak of me.\n\nIt lay upon my conscience often that I had not made dear Annie secret to\nthis history; although in all things I could trust her, and she loved me\nlike a lamb. Many and many a time I tried, and more than once began the\nthing; but there came a dryness in my throat, and a knocking under the\nroof of my mouth, and a longing to put it off again, as perhaps might be\nthe wisest. And then I would remember too that I had no right to speak\nof Lorna as if she were common property.\n\nThis time I longed to take my gun, and was half resolved to do so;\nbecause it seemed so hard a thing to be shot at and have no chance of\nshooting; but when I came to remember the steepness and the slippery\nnature of the waterslide, there seemed but little likelihood of keeping\ndry the powder. Therefore I was armed with nothing but a good stout\nholly staff, seasoned well for many a winter in our back-kitchen\nchimney.\n\nAlthough my heart was leaping high with the prospect of some adventure,\nand the fear of meeting Lorna, I could not but be gladdened by the\nsoftness of the weather, and the welcome way of everything. There was\nthat power all round, that power and that goodness, which make us come,\nas it were, outside our bodily selves, to share them. Over and beside us\nbreathes the joy of hope and promise; under foot are troubles past; in\nthe distance bowering newness tempts us ever forward. We quicken with\nlargesse of life, and spring with vivid mystery.\n\nAnd, in good sooth, I had to spring, and no mystery about it, ere ever I\ngot to the top of the rift leading into Doone-glade. For the stream was\nrushing down in strength, and raving at every corner; a mort of rain\nhaving fallen last night and no wind come to wipe it. However, I reached\nthe head ere dark with more difficulty than danger, and sat in a place\nwhich comforted my back and legs desirably.\n\nHereupon I grew so happy at being on dry land again, and come to look\nfor Lorna, with pretty trees around me, that what did I do but fall\nasleep with the holly-stick in front of me, and my best coat sunk in a\nbed of moss, with water and wood-sorrel. Mayhap I had not done so, nor\nyet enjoyed the spring so much, if so be I had not taken three parts of\na gallon of cider at home, at Plover's Barrows, because of the lowness\nand sinking ever since I met Mother Melldrum.\n\nThere was a little runnel going softly down beside me, falling from the\nupper rock by the means of moss and grass, as if it feared to make a\nnoise, and had a mother sleeping. Now and then it seemed to stop, in\nfear of its own dropping, and wait for some orders; and the blades of\ngrass that straightened to it turned their points a little way, and\noffered their allegiance to wind instead of water. Yet before their\ncarkled edges bent more than a driven saw, down the water came again\nwith heavy drops and pats of running, and bright anger at neglect.\n\nThis was very pleasant to me, now and then, to gaze at, blinking as the\nwater blinked, and falling back to sleep again. Suddenly my sleep was\nbroken by a shade cast over me; between me and the low sunlight Lorna\nDoone was standing.\n\n\"Master Ridd, are you mad?\" she said, and took my hand to move me.\n\n\"Not mad, but half asleep,\" I answered, feigning not to notice her, that\nso she might keep hold of me.\n\n\"Come away, come away, if you care for life. The patrol will be here\ndirectly. Be quick, Master Ridd, let me hide thee.\"\n\n\"I will not stir a step,\" said I, though being in the greatest fright\nthat might be well imagined, \"unless you call me 'John.'\"\n\n\"Well, John, then--Master John Ridd, be quick, if you have any to care\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I have many that care for me,\" I said, just to let her know; \"and I\nwill follow you, Mistress Lorna, albeit without any hurry, unless there\nbe peril to more than me.\"\n\nWithout another word she led me, though with many timid glances towards\nthe upper valley, to, and into, her little bower, where the inlet\nthrough the rock was. I am almost sure that I spoke before (though I\ncannot now go seek for it, and my memory is but a worn-out tub) of\na certain deep and perilous pit, in which I was like to drown myself\nthrough hurry and fright of boyhood. And even then I wondered greatly,\nand was vexed with Lorna for sending me in that heedless manner into\nsuch an entrance. But now it was clear that she had been right and the\nfault mine own entirely; for the entrance to the pit was only to be\nfound by seeking it. Inside the niche of native stone, the plainest\nthing of all to see, at any rate by day light, was the stairway hewn\nfrom rock, and leading up the mountain, by means of which I had escaped,\nas before related. To the right side of this was the mouth of the pit,\nstill looking very formidable; though Lorna laughed at my fear of it,\nfor she drew her water thence. But on the left was a narrow crevice,\nvery difficult to espy, and having a sweep of grey ivy laid, like a\nslouching beaver, over it. A man here coming from the brightness of the\nouter air, with eyes dazed by the twilight, would never think of seeing\nthis and following it to its meaning.\n\nLorna raised the screen for me, but I had much ado to pass, on account\nof bulk and stature. Instead of being proud of my size (as it seemed to\nme she ought to be) Lorna laughed so quietly that I was ready to knock\nmy head or elbows against anything, and say no more about it. However,\nI got through at last without a word of compliment, and broke into the\npleasant room, the lone retreat of Lorna.\n\nThe chamber was of unhewn rock, round, as near as might be, eighteen\nor twenty feet across, and gay with rich variety of fern and moss\nand lichen. The fern was in its winter still, or coiling for the\nspring-tide; but moss was in abundant life, some feathering, and some\ngobleted, and some with fringe of red to it. Overhead there was no\nceiling but the sky itself, flaked with little clouds of April whitely\nwandering over it. The floor was made of soft low grass, mixed with moss\nand primroses; and in a niche of shelter moved the delicate wood-sorrel.\nHere and there, around the sides, were \"chairs of living stone,\" as some\nLatin writer says, whose name has quite escaped me; and in the midst a\ntiny spring arose, with crystal beads in it, and a soft voice as of\na laughing dream, and dimples like a sleeping babe. Then, after going\nround a little, with surprise of daylight, the water overwelled the\nedge, and softly went through lines of light to shadows and an untold\nbourne.\n\nWhile I was gazing at all these things with wonder and some sadness,\nLorna turned upon me lightly (as her manner was) and said,--\n\n\"Where are the new-laid eggs, Master Ridd? Or hath blue hen ceased\nlaying?\"\n\nI did not altogether like the way in which she said it with a sort of\ndialect, as if my speech could be laughed at.\n\n\"Here be some,\" I answered, speaking as if in spite of her. \"I would\nhave brought thee twice as many, but that I feared to crush them in the\nnarrow ways, Mistress Lorna.\"\n\n[Illustration: 157.jpg Here be some Mistress Lorna]\n\nAnd so I laid her out two dozen upon the moss of the rock-ledge,\nunwinding the wisp of hay from each as it came safe out of my pocket.\nLorna looked with growing wonder, as I added one to one; and when I\nhad placed them side by side, and bidden her now to tell them, to my\namazement what did she do but burst into a flood of tears.\n\n\"What have I done?\" I asked, with shame, scarce daring even to look\nat her, because her grief was not like Annie's--a thing that could be\ncoaxed away, and left a joy in going--\"oh, what have I done to vex you\nso?\"\n\n\"It is nothing done by you, Master Ridd,\" she answered, very proudly, as\nif nought I did could matter; \"it is only something that comes upon me\nwith the scent of the pure true clover-hay. Moreover, you have been too\nkind; and I am not used to kindness.\"\n\nSome sort of awkwardness was on me, at her words and weeping, as if I\nwould like to say something, but feared to make things worse perhaps\nthan they were already. Therefore I abstained from speech, as I would\nin my own pain. And as it happened, this was the way to make her tell me\nmore about it. Not that I was curious, beyond what pity urged me and\nthe strange affairs around her; and now I gazed upon the floor, lest I\nshould seem to watch her; but none the less for that I knew all that she\nwas doing.\n\nLorna went a little way, as if she would not think of me nor care for\none so careless; and all my heart gave a sudden jump, to go like a mad\nthing after her; until she turned of her own accord, and with a little\nsigh came back to me. Her eyes were soft with trouble's shadow, and\nthe proud lift of her neck was gone, and beauty's vanity borne down by\nwoman's want of sustenance.\n\n\"Master Ridd,\" she said in the softest voice that ever flowed between\ntwo lips, \"have I done aught to offend you?\"\n\nHereupon it went hard with me, not to catch her up and kiss her, in the\nmanner in which she was looking; only it smote me suddenly that this\nwould be a low advantage of her trust and helplessness. She seemed to\nknow what I would be at, and to doubt very greatly about it, whether\nas a child of old she might permit the usage. All sorts of things went\nthrough my head, as I made myself look away from her, for fear of being\ntempted beyond what I could bear. And the upshot of it was that I said,\nwithin my heart and through it, \"John Ridd, be on thy very best manners\nwith this lonely maiden.\"\n\nLorna liked me all the better for my good forbearance; because she did\nnot love me yet, and had not thought about it; at least so far as I\nknew. And though her eyes were so beauteous, so very soft and kindly,\nthere was (to my apprehension) some great power in them, as if she would\nnot have a thing, unless her judgment leaped with it.\n\nBut now her judgment leaped with me, because I had behaved so well; and\nbeing of quick urgent nature--such as I delight in, for the change\nfrom mine own slowness--she, without any let or hindrance, sitting over\nagainst me, now raising and now dropping fringe over those sweet\neyes that were the road-lights of her tongue, Lorna told me all about\neverything I wished to know, every little thing she knew, except indeed\nthat point of points, how Master Ridd stood with her.\n\nAlthough it wearied me no whit, it might be wearisome for folk who\ncannot look at Lorna, to hear the story all in speech, exactly as she\ntold it; therefore let me put it shortly, to the best of my remembrance.\n\nNay, pardon me, whosoever thou art, for seeming fickle and rude to thee;\nI have tried to do as first proposed, to tell the tale in my own words,\nas of another's fortune. But, lo! I was beset at once with many heavy\nobstacles, which grew as I went onward, until I knew not where I was,\nand mingled past and present. And two of these difficulties only were\nenough to stop me; the one that I must coldly speak without the force of\npity, the other that I, off and on, confused myself with Lorna, as might\nbe well expected.\n\nTherefore let her tell the story, with her own sweet voice and manner;\nand if ye find it wearisome, seek in yourselves the weariness.\n\n[Illustration: 159.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nLORNA BEGINS HER STORY\n\n[Illustration: 160.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\n\"I cannot go through all my thoughts so as to make them clear to you,\nnor have I ever dwelt on things, to shape a story of them. I know not\nwhere the beginning was, nor where the middle ought to be, nor even how\nat the present time I feel, or think, or ought to think. If I look for\nhelp to those around me, who should tell me right and wrong (being older\nand much wiser), I meet sometimes with laughter, and at other times with\nanger.\n\n\"There are but two in the world who ever listen and try to help me; one\nof them is my grandfather, and the other is a man of wisdom, whom we\ncall the Counsellor. My grandfather, Sir Ensor Doone, is very old and\nharsh of manner (except indeed to me); he seems to know what is right\nand wrong, but not to want to think of it. The Counsellor, on the other\nhand, though full of life and subtleties, treats my questions as of\nplay, and not gravely worth his while to answer, unless he can make wit\nof them.\n\n\"And among the women there are none with whom I can hold converse, since\nmy Aunt Sabina died, who took such pains to teach me. She was a lady of\nhigh repute and lofty ways, and learning, but grieved and harassed more\nand more by the coarseness, and the violence, and the ignorance around\nher. In vain she strove, from year to year, to make the young men\nhearken, to teach them what became their birth, and give them sense of\nhonour. It was her favourite word, poor thing! and they called her 'Old\nAunt Honour.' Very often she used to say that I was her only comfort,\nand I am sure she was my only one; and when she died it was more to me\nthan if I had lost a mother.\n\n\"For I have no remembrance now of father or of mother, although they say\nthat my father was the eldest son of Sir Ensor Doone, and the bravest\nand the best of them. And so they call me heiress to this little realm\nof violence; and in sorry sport sometimes, I am their Princess or their\nQueen.\n\n\"Many people living here, as I am forced to do, would perhaps be\nvery happy, and perhaps I ought to be so. We have a beauteous valley,\nsheltered from the cold of winter and power of the summer sun,\nuntroubled also by the storms and mists that veil the mountains;\nalthough I must acknowledge that it is apt to rain too often. The grass\nmoreover is so fresh, and the brook so bright and lively, and flowers\nof so many hues come after one another that no one need be dull, if only\nleft alone with them.\n\n\"And so in the early days perhaps, when morning breathes around me, and\nthe sun is going upward, and light is playing everywhere, I am not so\nfar beside them all as to live in shadow. But when the evening gathers\ndown, and the sky is spread with sadness, and the day has spent itself;\nthen a cloud of lonely trouble falls, like night, upon me. I cannot see\nthe things I quest for of a world beyond me; I cannot join the peace\nand quiet of the depth above me; neither have I any pleasure in the\nbrightness of the stars.\n\n\"What I want to know is something none of them can tell me--what am\nI, and why set here, and when shall I be with them? I see that you are\nsurprised a little at this my curiosity. Perhaps such questions never\nspring in any wholesome spirit. But they are in the depths of mine, and\nI cannot be quit of them.\n\n\"Meantime, all around me is violence and robbery, coarse delight and\nsavage pain, reckless joke and hopeless death. Is it any wonder that I\ncannot sink with these, that I cannot so forget my soul, as to live the\nlife of brutes, and die the death more horrible because it dreams of\nwaking? There is none to lead me forward, there is none to teach me\nright; young as I am, I live beneath a curse that lasts for ever.\"\n\nHere Lorna broke down for awhile, and cried so very piteously, that\ndoubting of my knowledge, and of any power to comfort, I did my best to\nhold my peace, and tried to look very cheerful. Then thinking that might\nbe bad manners, I went to wipe her eyes for her.\n\n[Illustration: 162.jpg I went to wipe her eyes]\n\n\"Master Ridd,\" she began again, \"I am both ashamed and vexed at my own\nchildish folly. But you, who have a mother, who thinks (you say) so\nmuch of you, and sisters, and a quiet home; you cannot tell (it is not\nlikely) what a lonely nature is. How it leaps in mirth sometimes, with\nonly heaven touching it; and how it falls away desponding, when the\ndreary weight creeps on.\n\n\"It does not happen many times that I give way like this; more shame\nnow to do so, when I ought to entertain you. Sometimes I am so full of\nanger, that I dare not trust to speech, at things they cannot hide from\nme; and perhaps you would be much surprised that reckless men would care\nso much to elude a young girl's knowledge. They used to boast to Aunt\nSabina of pillage and of cruelty, on purpose to enrage her; but they\nnever boast to me. It even makes me smile sometimes to see how\nawkwardly they come and offer for temptation to me shining packets,\nhalf concealed, of ornaments and finery, of rings, or chains, or jewels,\nlately belonging to other people.\n\n[Illustration: 163.jpg Jewels lately belonging to others]\n\n\"But when I try to search the past, to get a sense of what befell me ere\nmy own perception formed; to feel back for the lines of childhood, as\na trace of gossamer, then I only know that nought lives longer than God\nwills it. So may after sin go by, for we are children always, as the\nCounsellor has told me; so may we, beyond the clouds, seek this infancy\nof life, and never find its memory.\n\n\"But I am talking now of things which never come across me when any work\nis toward. It might have been a good thing for me to have had a father\nto beat these rovings out of me; or a mother to make a home, and teach\nme how to manage it. For, being left with none--I think; and nothing\never comes of it. Nothing, I mean, which I can grasp and have with any\nsurety; nothing but faint images, and wonderment, and wandering. But\noften, when I am neither searching back into remembrance, nor asking of\nmy parents, but occupied by trifles, something like a sign, or message,\nor a token of some meaning, seems to glance upon me. Whether from the\nrustling wind, or sound of distant music, or the singing of a bird, like\nthe sun on snow it strikes me with a pain of pleasure.\n\n\"And often when I wake at night, and listen to the silence, or wander\nfar from people in the grayness of the evening, or stand and look at\nquiet water having shadows over it, some vague image seems to hover on\nthe skirt of vision, ever changing place and outline, ever flitting as I\nfollow. This so moves and hurries me, in the eagerness and longing, that\nstraightway all my chance is lost; and memory, scared like a wild bird,\nflies. Or am I as a child perhaps, chasing a flown cageling, who among\nthe branches free plays and peeps at the offered cage (as a home not to\nbe urged on him), and means to take his time of coming, if he comes at\nall?\n\n\"Often too I wonder at the odds of fortune, which made me (helpless as\nI am, and fond of peace and reading) the heiress of this mad domain, the\nsanctuary of unholiness. It is not likely that I shall have much power\nof authority; and yet the Counsellor creeps up to be my Lord of the\nTreasury; and his son aspires to my hand, as of a Royal alliance. Well,\n'honour among thieves,' they say; and mine is the first honour: although\namong decent folk perhaps, honesty is better.\n\n\"We should not be so quiet here, and safe from interruption but that I\nhave begged one privilege rather than commanded it. This was that the\nlower end, just this narrowing of the valley, where it is most hard to\ncome at, might be looked upon as mine, except for purposes of guard.\nTherefore none beside the sentries ever trespass on me here, unless it\nbe my grandfather, or the Counsellor or Carver.\n\n\"By your face, Master Ridd, I see that you have heard of Carver Doone.\nFor strength and courage and resource he bears the first repute among\nus, as might well be expected from the son of the Counsellor. But he\ndiffers from his father, in being very hot and savage, and quite free\nfrom argument. The Counsellor, who is my uncle, gives his son the best\nadvice; commending all the virtues, with eloquence and wisdom; yet\nhimself abstaining from them accurately and impartially.\n\n\"You must be tired of this story, and the time I take to think, and\nthe weakness of my telling; but my life from day to day shows so little\nvariance. Among the riders there is none whose safe return I watch\nfor--I mean none more than other--and indeed there seems no risk, all\nare now so feared of us. Neither of the old men is there whom I\ncan revere or love (except alone my grandfather, whom I love with\ntrembling): neither of the women any whom I like to deal with, unless it\nbe a little maiden whom I saved from starving.\n\n[Illustration: 165.jpg Gwenny Carfax]\n\n\"A little Cornish girl she is, and shaped in western manner, not so very\nmuch less in width than if you take her lengthwise. Her father seems to\nhave been a miner, a Cornishman (as she declares) of more than average\nexcellence, and better than any two men to be found in Devonshire, or\nany four in Somerset. Very few things can have been beyond his power of\nperformance, and yet he left his daughter to starve upon a peat-rick.\nShe does not know how this was done, and looks upon it as a mystery,\nthe meaning of which will some day be clear, and redound to her father's\nhonour. His name was Simon Carfax, and he came as the captain of a gang\nfrom one of the Cornish stannaries. Gwenny Carfax, my young maid, well\nremembers how her father was brought up from Cornwall. Her mother had\nbeen buried, just a week or so before; and he was sad about it, and had\nbeen off his work, and was ready for another job. Then people came to\nhim by night, and said that he must want a change, and everybody lost\ntheir wives, and work was the way to mend it. So what with grief,\nand over-thought, and the inside of a square bottle, Gwenny says they\nbrought him off, to become a mighty captain, and choose the country\nround. The last she saw of him was this, that he went down a ladder\nsomewhere on the wilds of Exmoor, leaving her with bread and cheese, and\nhis travelling-hat to see to. And from that day to this he never came\nabove the ground again; so far as we can hear of.\n\n\"But Gwenny, holding to his hat, and having eaten the bread and cheese\n(when he came no more to help her), dwelt three days near the mouth of\nthe hole; and then it was closed over, the while that she was sleeping.\nWith weakness and with want of food, she lost herself distressfully, and\nwent away for miles or more, and lay upon a peat-rick, to die before the\nravens.\n\n\"That very day I chanced to return from Aunt Sabina's dying-place; for\nshe would not die in Glen Doone, she said, lest the angels feared to\ncome for her; and so she was taken to a cottage in a lonely valley. I\nwas allowed to visit her, for even we durst not refuse the wishes of the\ndying; and if a priest had been desired, we should have made bold with\nhim. Returning very sorrowful, and caring now for nothing, I found this\nlittle stray thing lying, her arms upon her, and not a sign of life,\nexcept the way that she was biting. Black root-stuff was in her mouth,\nand a piece of dirty sheep's wool, and at her feet an old egg-shell of\nsome bird of the moorland.\n\n\"I tried to raise her, but she was too square and heavy for me; and so\nI put food in her mouth, and left her to do right with it. And this she\ndid in a little time; for the victuals were very choice and rare, being\nwhat I had taken over to tempt poor Aunt Sabina. Gwenny ate them without\ndelay, and then was ready to eat the basket and the ware that contained\nthem.\n\n\"Gwenny took me for an angel--though I am little like one, as you see,\nMaster Ridd; and she followed me, expecting that I would open wings and\nfly when we came to any difficulty. I brought her home with me, so far\nas this can be a home, and she made herself my sole attendant, without\nso much as asking me. She has beaten two or three other girls, who used\nto wait upon me, until they are afraid to come near the house of my\ngrandfather. She seems to have no kind of fear even of our roughest men;\nand yet she looks with reverence and awe upon the Counsellor. As for the\nwickedness, and theft, and revelry around her, she says it is no concern\nof hers, and they know their own business best. By this way of regarding\nmen she has won upon our riders, so that she is almost free from all\ncontrol of place and season, and is allowed to pass where none even of\nthe youths may go. Being so wide, and short, and flat, she has none to\npay her compliments; and, were there any, she would scorn them, as not\nbeing Cornishmen. Sometimes she wanders far, by moonlight, on the moors\nand up the rivers, to give her father (as she says) another chance of\nfinding her, and she comes back not a wit defeated, or discouraged, or\ndepressed, but confident that he is only waiting for the proper time.\n\n\"Herein she sets me good example of a patience and contentment hard for\nme to imitate. Oftentimes I am vexed by things I cannot meddle with, yet\nwhich cannot be kept from me, that I am at the point of flying from this\ndreadful valley, and risking all that can betide me in the unknown outer\nworld. If it were not for my grandfather, I would have done so long ago;\nbut I cannot bear that he should die with no gentle hand to comfort him;\nand I fear to think of the conflict that must ensue for the government,\nif there be a disputed succession.\n\n\"Ah me! We are to be pitied greatly, rather than condemned, by people\nwhose things we have taken from them; for I have read, and seem almost\nto understand about it, that there are places on the earth where gentle\npeace, and love of home, and knowledge of one's neighbours prevail, and\nare, with reason, looked for as the usual state of things. There honest\nfolk may go to work in the glory of the sunrise, with hope of coming\nhome again quite safe in the quiet evening, and finding all their\nchildren; and even in the darkness they have no fear of lying down, and\ndropping off to slumber, and hearken to the wind of night, not as to an\nenemy trying to find entrance, but a friend who comes to tell the value\nof their comfort.\n\n\"Of all this golden ease I hear, but never saw the like of it; and,\nhaply, I shall never do so, being born to turbulence. Once, indeed, I\nhad the offer of escape, and kinsman's aid, and high place in the gay,\nbright world; and yet I was not tempted much, or, at least, dared not to\ntrust it. And it ended very sadly, so dreadfully that I even shrink from\ntelling you about it; for that one terror changed my life, in a moment,\nat a blow, from childhood and from thoughts of play and commune with the\nflowers and trees, to a sense of death and darkness, and a heavy weight\nof earth. Be content now, Master Ridd ask me nothing more about it, so\nyour sleep be sounder.\"\n\nBut I, John Ridd, being young and new, and very fond of hearing things\nto make my blood to tingle, had no more of manners than to urge poor\nLorna onwards, hoping, perhaps, in depth of heart, that she might have\nto hold by me, when the worst came to the worst of it. Therefore she\nwent on again.\n\n[Illustration: 168.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nLORNA ENDS HER STORY\n\n[Illustration: 169.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\n\"It is not a twelvemonth yet, although it seems ten years agone, since\nI blew the downy globe to learn the time of day, or set beneath my\nchin the veinings of the varnished buttercup, or fired the fox-glove\ncannonade, or made a captive of myself with dandelion fetters; for then\nI had not very much to trouble me in earnest, but went about, romancing\ngravely, playing at bo-peep with fear, making for myself strong heroes\nof gray rock or fir-tree, adding to my own importance, as the children\nlove to do.\n\n\"As yet I had not truly learned the evil of our living, the scorn of\nlaw, the outrage, and the sorrow caused to others. It even was a point\nwith all to hide the roughness from me, to show me but the gallant side,\nand keep in shade the other. My grandfather, Sir Ensor Doone, had given\nstrictest order, as I discovered afterwards, that in my presence all\nshould be seemly, kind, and vigilant. Nor was it very difficult to\nkeep most part of the mischief from me, for no Doone ever robs at home,\nneither do they quarrel much, except at times of gambling. And though\nSir Ensor Doone is now so old and growing feeble, his own way he will\nhave still, and no one dare deny him. Even our fiercest and most mighty\nswordsmen, seared from all sense of right or wrong, yet have plentiful\nsense of fear, when brought before that white-haired man. Not that he is\nrough with them, or querulous, or rebukeful; but that he has a strange\nsoft smile, and a gaze they cannot answer, and a knowledge deeper far\nthan they have of themselves. Under his protection, I am as safe from\nall those men (some of whom are but little akin to me) as if I slept\nbeneath the roof of the King's Lord Justiciary.\n\n\"But now, at the time I speak of, one evening of last summer, a horrible\nthing befell, which took all play of childhood from me. The fifteenth\nday of last July was very hot and sultry, long after the time of\nsundown; and I was paying heed of it, because of the old saying that if\nit rain then, rain will fall on forty days thereafter. I had been long\nby the waterside at this lower end of the valley, plaiting a little\ncrown of woodbine crocketed with sprigs of heath--to please my\ngrandfather, who likes to see me gay at supper-time. Being proud of my\ntiara, which had cost some trouble, I set it on my head at once, to save\nthe chance of crushing, and carrying my gray hat, ventured by a path not\noften trod. For I must be home at the supper-time, or grandfather\nwould be exceeding wrath; and the worst of his anger is that he never\ncondescends to show it.\n\n\"Therefore, instead of the open mead, or the windings of the river, I\nmade short cut through the ash-trees covert which lies in the middle of\nour vale, with the water skirting or cleaving it. You have never been\nup so far as that--at least to the best of my knowledge--but you see it\nlike a long gray spot, from the top of the cliffs above us. Here I was\nnot likely to meet any of our people because the young ones are afraid\nof some ancient tale about it, and the old ones have no love of trees\nwhere gunshots are uncertain.\n\n\"It was more almost than dusk, down below the tree-leaves, and I was\neager to go through, and be again beyond it. For the gray dark hung\naround me, scarcely showing shadow; and the little light that glimmered\nseemed to come up from the ground. For the earth was strown with the\nwinter-spread and coil of last year's foliage, the lichened claws\nof chalky twigs, and the numberless decay which gives a light in its\ndecaying. I, for my part, hastened shyly, ready to draw back and run\nfrom hare, or rabbit, or small field-mouse.\n\n\"At a sudden turn of the narrow path, where it stopped again to the\nriver, a man leaped out from behind a tree, and stopped me, and seized\nhold of me. I tried to shriek, but my voice was still; I could only hear\nmy heart.\n\n\"'Now, Cousin Lorna, my good cousin,' he said, with ease and calmness;\n'your voice is very sweet, no doubt, from all that I can see of you. But\nI pray you keep it still, unless you would give to dusty death your very\nbest cousin and trusty guardian, Alan Brandir of Loch Awe.'\n\n\"'You my guardian!' I said, for the idea was too ludicrous; and\nludicrous things always strike me first, through some fault of nature.\n\n\"'I have in truth that honour, madam,' he answered, with a sweeping bow;\n'unless I err in taking you for Mistress Lorna Doone.'\n\n\"'You have not mistaken me. My name is Lorna Doone.'\n\n\"He looked at me, with gravity, and was inclined to make some claim to\ncloser consideration upon the score of kinship; but I shrunk back, and\nonly said, 'Yes, my name is Lorna Doone.'\n\n\"'Then I am your faithful guardian, Alan Brandir of Loch Awe; called\nLord Alan Brandir, son of a worthy peer of Scotland. Now will you\nconfide in me?'\n\n\"'I confide in you!\" I cried, looking at him with amazement; 'why, you\nare not older than I am!'\n\n\"'Yes I am, three years at least. You, my ward, are not sixteen. I, your\nworshipful guardian, am almost nineteen years of age.'\n\n\"Upon hearing this I looked at him, for that seemed then a venerable\nage; but the more I looked the more I doubted, although he was dressed\nquite like a man. He led me in a courtly manner, stepping at his tallest\nto an open place beside the water; where the light came as in channel,\nand was made the most of by glancing waves and fair white stones.\n\n[Illustration: 172.jpg She led me in a courtly manner]\n\n\"'Now am I to your liking, cousin?' he asked, when I had gazed at him,\nuntil I was almost ashamed, except at such a stripling. 'Does my Cousin\nLorna judge kindly of her guardian, and her nearest kinsman? In a word,\nis our admiration mutual?'\n\n\"'Truly I know not,' I said; 'but you seem good-natured, and to have no\nharm in you. Do they trust you with a sword?'\n\n\"For in my usage among men of stature and strong presence, this pretty\nyouth, so tricked and slender, seemed nothing but a doll to me. Although\nhe scared me in the wood, now that I saw him in good twilight, lo! he\nwas but little greater than my little self; and so tasselled and so\nruffled with a mint of bravery, and a green coat barred with red, and\na slim sword hanging under him, it was the utmost I could do to look at\nhim half-gravely.\n\n\"'I fear that my presence hath scarce enough of ferocity about it'\n(he gave a jerk to his sword as he spoke, and clanked it on the\nbrook-stones); 'yet do I assure you, cousin, that I am not without\nsome prowess; and many a master of defence hath this good sword of mine\ndisarmed. Now if the boldest and biggest robber in all this charming\nvalley durst so much as breathe the scent of that flower coronal, which\ndoth not adorn but is adorned'--here he talked some nonsense--'I would\ncleave him from head to foot, ere ever he could fly or cry.'\n\n\"'Hush!' I said; 'talk not so loudly, or thou mayst have to do both\nthyself, and do them both in vain.'\n\n\"For he was quite forgetting now, in his bravery before me, where he\nstood, and with whom he spoke, and how the summer lightning shone above\nthe hills and down the hollow. And as I gazed on this slight fair youth,\nclearly one of high birth and breeding (albeit over-boastful), a chill\nof fear crept over me; because he had no strength or substance, and\nwould be no more than a pin-cushion before the great swords of the\nDoones.\n\n\"'I pray you be not vexed with me,' he answered, in a softer voice;\n'for I have travelled far and sorely, for the sake of seeing you. I know\nright well among whom I am, and that their hospitality is more of the\nknife than the salt-stand. Nevertheless I am safe enough, for my foot is\nthe fleetest in Scotland, and what are these hills to me? Tush! I have\nseen some border forays among wilder spirits and craftier men than these\nbe. Once I mind some years agone, when I was quite a stripling lad--'\n\n\"'Worshipful guardian,' I said, 'there is no time now for history. If\nthou art in no haste, I am, and cannot stay here idling. Only tell me\nhow I am akin and under wardship to thee, and what purpose brings thee\nhere.'\n\n\"'In order, cousin--all things in order, even with fair ladies. First,\nI am thy uncle's son, my father is thy mother's brother, or at least thy\ngrandmother's--unless I am deceived in that which I have guessed, and no\nother man. For my father, being a leading lord in the councils of\nKing Charles the Second, appointed me to learn the law, not for my\nlivelihood, thank God, but because he felt the lack of it in affairs\nof state. But first your leave, young Mistress Lorna; I cannot lay down\nlegal maxims, without aid of smoke.'\n\n\"He leaned against a willow-tree, and drawing from a gilded box a little\ndark thing like a stick, placed it between his lips, and then striking\na flint on steel made fire and caught it upon touchwood. With this he\nkindled the tip of the stick, until it glowed with a ring of red, and\nthen he breathed forth curls of smoke, blue and smelling on the air\nlike spice. I had never seen this done before, though acquainted with\ntobacco-pipes; and it made me laugh, until I thought of the peril that\nmust follow it.\n\n\"'Cousin, have no fear,' he said; 'this makes me all the safer; they\nwill take me for a glow-worm, and thee for the flower it shines upon.\nBut to return--of law I learned as you may suppose, but little; although\nI have capacities. But the thing was far too dull for me. All I care for\nis adventure, moving chance, and hot encounter; therefore all of law I\nlearned was how to live without it. Nevertheless, for amusement's sake,\nas I must needs be at my desk an hour or so in the afternoon, I took to\nthe sporting branch of the law, the pitfalls, and the ambuscades; and\nof all the traps to be laid therein, pedigrees are the rarest. There is\nscarce a man worth a cross of butter, but what you may find a hole in\nhis shield within four generations. And so I struck our own escutcheon,\nand it sounded hollow. There is a point--but heed not that; enough that\nbeing curious now, I followed up the quarry, and I am come to this at\nlast--we, even we, the lords of Loch Awe, have an outlaw for our cousin,\nand I would we had more, if they be like you.'\n\n\"'Sir,' I answered, being amused by his manner, which was new to me (for\nthe Doones are much in earnest), 'surely you count it no disgrace to be\nof kin to Sir Ensor Doone, and all his honest family!'\n\n\"'If it be so, it is in truth the very highest honour and would heal ten\nholes in our escutcheon. What noble family but springs from a captain\namong robbers? Trade alone can spoil our blood; robbery purifies it. The\nrobbery of one age is the chivalry of the next. We may start anew, and\nvie with even the nobility of France, if we can once enrol but half the\nDoones upon our lineage.'\n\n\"'I like not to hear you speak of the Doones, as if they were no more\nthan that,' I exclaimed, being now unreasonable; 'but will you tell me,\nonce for all, sir, how you are my guardian?'\n\n\"'That I will do. You are my ward because you were my father's ward,\nunder the Scottish law; and now my father being so deaf, I have\nsucceeded to that right--at least in my own opinion--under which claim I\nam here to neglect my trust no longer, but to lead you away from scenes\nand deeds which (though of good repute and comely) are not the best for\nyoung gentlewomen. There spoke I not like a guardian? After that can you\nmistrust me?'\n\n\"'But,' said I, 'good Cousin Alan (if I may so call you), it is not\nmeet for young gentlewomen to go away with young gentlemen, though fifty\ntimes their guardians. But if you will only come with me, and explain\nyour tale to my grandfather, he will listen to you quietly, and take no\nadvantage of you.'\n\n\"'I thank you much, kind Mistress Lorna, to lead the goose into the\nfox's den! But, setting by all thought of danger, I have other reasons\nagainst it. Now, come with your faithful guardian, child. I will pledge\nmy honour against all harm, and to bear you safe to London. By the law\nof the realm, I am now entitled to the custody of your fair person, and\nof all your chattels.'\n\n\"'But, sir, all that you have learned of law, is how to live without\nit.'\n\n\"'Fairly met, fair cousin mine! Your wit will do me credit, after a\nlittle sharpening. And there is none to do that better than your aunt,\nmy mother. Although she knows not of my coming, she is longing to\nreceive you. Come, and in a few months' time you shall set the mode at\nCourt, instead of pining here, and weaving coronals of daisies.'\n\n\"I turned aside, and thought a little. Although he seemed so light of\nmind, and gay in dress and manner, I could not doubt his honesty; and\nsaw, beneath his jaunty air, true mettle and ripe bravery. Scarce had I\nthought of his project twice, until he spoke of my aunt, his mother, but\nthen the form of my dearest friend, my sweet Aunt Sabina, seemed to come\nand bid me listen, for this was what she prayed for. Moreover I felt\n(though not as now) that Doone Glen was no place for me or any proud\nyoung maiden. But while I thought, the yellow lightning spread behind a\nbulk of clouds, three times ere the flash was done, far off and void of\nthunder; and from the pile of cloud before it, cut as from black paper,\nand lit to depths of blackness by the blaze behind it, a form as of an\naged man, sitting in a chair loose-mantled, seemed to lift a hand and\nwarn.\n\n\"This minded me of my grandfather, and all the care I owed him.\nMoreover, now the storm was rising and I began to grow afraid; for of\nall things awful to me thunder is the dreadfulest. It doth so growl,\nlike a lion coming, and then so roll, and roar, and rumble, out of a\nthickening darkness, then crack like the last trump overhead through\ncloven air and terror, that all my heart lies low and quivers, like a\nweed in water. I listened now for the distant rolling of the great black\nstorm, and heard it, and was hurried by it. But the youth before me\nwaved his rolled tobacco at it, and drawled in his daintiest tone and\nmanner,--\n\n\"'The sky is having a smoke, I see, and dropping sparks, and grumbling.\nI should have thought these Exmoor hills too small to gather thunder.'\n\n\"'I cannot go, I will not go with you, Lord Alan Brandir,' I answered,\nbeing vexed a little by those words of his. 'You are not grave enough\nfor me, you are not old enough for me. My Aunt Sabina would not\nhave wished it; nor would I leave my grandfather, without his full\npermission. I thank you much for coming, sir; but be gone at once by the\nway you came; and pray how did you come, sir?'\n\n\"'Fair cousin, you will grieve for this; you will mourn, when you cannot\nmend it. I would my mother had been here, soon would she have persuaded\nyou. And yet,' he added, with the smile of his accustomed gaiety, 'it\nwould have been an unco thing, as we say in Scotland, for her ladyship\nto have waited upon you, as her graceless son has done, and hopes to do\nagain ere long. Down the cliffs I came, and up them I must make way back\nagain. Now adieu, fair Cousin Lorna, I see you are in haste tonight;\nbut I am right proud of my guardianship. Give me just one flower for\ntoken'--here he kissed his hand to me, and I threw him a truss of\nwoodbine--'adieu, fair cousin, trust me well, I will soon be here\nagain.'\n\n\"'That thou never shalt, sir,' cried a voice as loud as a culverin; and\nCarver Doone had Alan Brandir as a spider hath a fly. The boy made a\nlittle shriek at first, with the sudden shock and the terror; then he\nlooked, methought, ashamed of himself, and set his face to fight for\nit. Very bravely he strove and struggled, to free one arm and grasp\nhis sword; but as well might an infant buried alive attempt to lift his\ngravestone. Carver Doone, with his great arms wrapped around the slim\ngay body, smiled (as I saw by the flash from heaven) at the poor young\nface turned up to him; then (as a nurse bears off a child, who is loath\nto go to bed), he lifted the youth from his feet, and bore him away into\nthe darkness.\n\n\"I was young then. I am older now; older by ten years, in thought,\nalthough it is not a twelvemonth since. If that black deed were done\nagain, I could follow, and could combat it, could throw weak arms on\nthe murderer, and strive to be murdered also. I am now at home with\nviolence; and no dark death surprises me.\n\n\"But, being as I was that night, the horror overcame me. The crash of\nthunder overhead, the last despairing look, the death-piece framed with\nblaze of lightning--my young heart was so affrighted that I could not\ngasp. My breath went from me, and I knew not where I was, or who, or\nwhat. Only that I lay, and cowered, under great trees full of thunder;\nand could neither count, nor moan, nor have my feet to help me.\n\n\"Yet hearkening, as a coward does, through the brushing of the wind,\nand echo of far noises, I heard a sharp sound as of iron, and a fall\nof heavy wood. No unmanly shriek came with it, neither cry for mercy.\nCarver Doone knows what it was; and so did Alan Brandir.\"\n\nHere Lorna Doone could tell no more, being overcome with weeping. Only\nthrough her tears she whispered, as a thing too bad to tell, that she\nhad seen that giant Carver, in a few days afterwards, smoking a little\nround brown stick, like those of her poor cousin. I could not press her\nany more with questions, or for clearness; although I longed very\nmuch to know whether she had spoken of it to her grandfather or the\nCounsellor. But she was now in such condition, both of mind and body,\nfrom the force of her own fear multiplied by telling it, that I did\nnothing more than coax her, at a distance humbly; and so that she could\nsee that some one was at least afraid of her. This (although I knew\nnot women in those days, as now I do, and never shall know much of it),\nthis, I say, so brought her round, that all her fear was now for me,\nand how to get me safely off, without mischance to any one. And sooth to\nsay, in spite of longing just to see if Master Carver could have served\nme such a trick--as it grew towards the dusk, I was not best pleased\nto be there; for it seemed a lawless place, and some of Lorna's fright\nstayed with me as I talked it away from her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n[Illustration: 178.jpg Glen Doone]\n\nAfter hearing that tale from Lorna, I went home in sorry spirits, having\nadded fear for her, and misery about, to all my other ailments. And was\nit not quite certain now that she, being owned full cousin to a peer and\nlord of Scotland (although he was a dead one), must have nought to do\nwith me, a yeoman's son, and bound to be the father of more yeomen? I\nhad been very sorry when first I heard about that poor young popinjay,\nand would gladly have fought hard for him; but now it struck me that\nafter all he had no right to be there, prowling (as it were) for Lorna,\nwithout any invitation: and we farmers love not trespass. Still, if I\nhad seen the thing, I must have tried to save him.\n\nMoreover, I was greatly vexed with my own hesitation, stupidity, or\nshyness, or whatever else it was, which had held me back from saying,\nere she told her story, what was in my heart to say, videlicet, that I\nmust die unless she let me love her. Not that I was fool enough to think\nthat she would answer me according to my liking, or begin to care about\nme for a long time yet; if indeed she ever should, which I hardly dared\nto hope. But that I had heard from men more skillful in the matter that\nit is wise to be in time, that so the maids may begin to think, when\nthey know that they are thought of. And, to tell the truth, I had bitter\nfears, on account of her wondrous beauty, lest some young fellow of\nhigher birth and finer parts, and finish, might steal in before poor me,\nand cut me out altogether. Thinking of which, I used to double my great\nfist, without knowing it, and keep it in my pocket ready.\n\nBut the worst of all was this, that in my great dismay and anguish\nto see Lorna weeping so, I had promised not to cause her any further\ntrouble from anxiety and fear of harm. And this, being brought to\npractice, meant that I was not to show myself within the precincts of\nGlen Doone, for at least another month. Unless indeed (as I contrived to\nedge into the agreement) anything should happen to increase her present\ntrouble and every day's uneasiness. In that case, she was to throw a\ndark mantle, or covering of some sort, over a large white stone which\nhung within the entrance to her retreat--I mean the outer entrance--and\nwhich, though unseen from the valley itself, was (as I had observed)\nconspicuous from the height where I stood with Uncle Reuben.\n\nNow coming home so sad and weary, yet trying to console myself with the\nthought that love o'erleapeth rank, and must still be lord of all, I\nfound a shameful thing going on, which made me very angry. For it needs\nmust happen that young Marwood de Whichehalse, only son of the Baron,\nriding home that very evening, from chasing of the Exmoor bustards,\nwith his hounds and serving-men, should take the short cut through\nour farmyard, and being dry from his exercise, should come and ask for\ndrink. And it needs must happen also that there should be none to give\nit to him but my sister Annie. I more than suspect that he had heard\nsome report of our Annie's comeliness, and had a mind to satisfy\nhimself upon the subject. Now, as he took the large ox-horn of our\nquarantine-apple cider (which we always keep apart from the rest, being\ntoo good except for the quality), he let his fingers dwell on Annie's,\nby some sort of accident, while he lifted his beaver gallantly, and\ngazed on her face in the light from the west. Then what did Annie do (as\nshe herself told me afterwards) but make her very best curtsey to him,\nbeing pleased that he was pleased with her, while she thought what a\nfine young man he was and so much breeding about him! And in truth he\nwas a dark, handsome fellow, hasty, reckless, and changeable, with a\nlook of sad destiny in his black eyes that would make any woman pity\nhim. What he was thinking of our Annie is not for me to say, although I\nmay think that you could not have found another such maiden on Exmoor,\nexcept (of course) my Lorna.\n\n[Illustration: 179.jpg Marwood de Whichehase]\n\nThough young Squire Marwood was so thirsty, he spent much time over his\ncider, or at any rate over the ox-horn, and he made many bows to Annie,\nand drank health to all the family, and spoke of me as if I had been his\nvery best friend at Blundell's; whereas he knew well enough all the time\nthat we had nought to say to one another; he being three years older,\nand therefore of course disdaining me. But while he was casting about\nperhaps for some excuse to stop longer, and Annie was beginning to fear\nlest mother should come after her, or Eliza be at the window, or Betty\nup in pigs' house, suddenly there came up to them, as if from the very\nheart of the earth, that long, low, hollow, mysterious sound which I\nspoke of in winter.\n\nThe young man started in his saddle, let the horn fall on the\nhorse-steps, and gazed all around in wonder; while as for Annie, she\nturned like a ghost, and tried to slam the door, but failed through the\nviolence of her trembling; (for never till now had any one heard it so\nclose at hand as you might say) or in the mere fall of the twilight. And\nby this time there was no man, at least in our parish, but knew--for the\nParson himself had told us so--that it was the devil groaning because\nthe Doones were too many for him.\n\nMarwood de Whichehalse was not so alarmed but what he saw a fine\nopportunity. He leaped from his horse, and laid hold of dear Annie in a\nhighly comforting manner; and she never would tell us about it (being\nso shy and modest), whether in breathing his comfort to her he tried\nto take some from her pure lips. I hope he did not, because that to me\nwould seem not the deed of a gentleman, and he was of good old family.\n\nAt this very moment, who should come into the end of the passage upon\nthem but the heavy writer of these doings I, John Ridd myself, and\nwalking the faster, it may be, on account of the noise I mentioned. I\nentered the house with some wrath upon me at seeing the gazehounds in\nthe yard; for it seems a cruel thing to me to harass the birds in the\nbreeding-time. And to my amazement there I saw Squire Marwood among the\nmilk-pans with his arm around our Annie's waist, and Annie all blushing\nand coaxing him off, for she was not come to scold yet.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong; God knows, and if I was, no doubt I shall pay for\nit; but I gave him the flat of my hand on his head, and down he went in\nthe thick of the milk-pans. He would have had my fist, I doubt, but for\nhaving been at school with me; and after that it is like enough he would\nnever have spoken another word. As it was, he lay stunned, with the\ncream running on him; while I took poor Annie up and carried her in to\nmother, who had heard the noise and was frightened.\n\nConcerning this matter I asked no more, but held myself ready to bear it\nout in any form convenient, feeling that I had done my duty, and\ncared not for the consequence; only for several days dear Annie seemed\nfrightened rather than grateful. But the oddest result of it was that\nEliza, who had so despised me, and made very rude verses about me, now\ncame trying to sit on my knee, and kiss me, and give me the best of the\npan. However, I would not allow it, because I hate sudden changes.\n\nAnother thing also astonished me--namely, a beautiful letter from\nMarwood de Whichehalse himself (sent by a groom soon afterwards), in\nwhich he apologised to me, as if I had been his equal, for his rudeness\nto my sister, which was not intended in the least, but came of their\ncommon alarm at the moment, and his desire to comfort her. Also he\nbegged permission to come and see me, as an old schoolfellow, and set\neverything straight between us, as should be among honest Blundellites.\n\nAll this was so different to my idea of fighting out a quarrel, when\nonce it is upon a man, that I knew not what to make of it, but bowed to\nhigher breeding. Only one thing I resolved upon, that come when he would\nhe should not see Annie. And to do my sister justice, she had no desire\nto see him.\n\nHowever, I am too easy, there is no doubt of that, being very quick to\nforgive a man, and very slow to suspect, unless he hath once lied to\nme. Moreover, as to Annie, it had always seemed to me (much against my\nwishes) that some shrewd love of a waiting sort was between her and Tom\nFaggus: and though Tom had made his fortune now, and everybody\nrespected him, of course he was not to be compared, in that point of\nrespectability, with those people who hanged the robbers when fortune\nturned against them.\n\nSo young Squire Marwood came again, as though I had never smitten\nhim, and spoke of it in as light a way as if we were still at school\ntogether. It was not in my nature, of course, to keep any anger against\nhim; and I knew what a condescension it was for him to visit us. And\nit is a very grievous thing, which touches small landowners, to see an\nancient family day by day decaying: and when we heard that Ley Barton\nitself, and all the Manor of Lynton were under a heavy mortgage debt to\nJohn Lovering of Weare-Gifford, there was not much, in our little way,\nthat we would not gladly do or suffer for the benefit of De Whichehalse.\n\nMeanwhile the work of the farm was toward, and every day gave us\nmore ado to dispose of what itself was doing. For after the long dry\nskeltering wind of March and part of April, there had been a fortnight\nof soft wet; and when the sun came forth again, hill and valley, wood\nand meadow, could not make enough of him. Many a spring have I seen\nsince then, but never yet two springs alike, and never one so beautiful.\nOr was it that my love came forth and touched the world with beauty?\n\n[Illustration: 182.jpg Spring was in our valley]\n\nThe spring was in our valley now; creeping first for shelter shyly in\nthe pause of the blustering wind. There the lambs came bleating to her,\nand the orchis lifted up, and the thin dead leaves of clover lay for the\nnew ones to spring through. There the stiffest things that sleep, the\nstubby oak, and the saplin'd beech, dropped their brown defiance to her,\nand prepared for a soft reply.\n\nWhile her over-eager children (who had started forth to meet her,\nthrough the frost and shower of sleet), catkin'd hazel, gold-gloved\nwithy, youthful elder, and old woodbine, with all the tribe of good\nhedge-climbers (who must hasten while haste they may)--was there one of\nthem that did not claim the merit of coming first?\n\nThere she stayed and held her revel, as soon as the fear of frost was\ngone; all the air was a fount of freshness, and the earth of gladness,\nand the laughing waters prattled of the kindness of the sun.\n\nBut all this made it much harder for us, plying the hoe and rake, to\nkeep the fields with room upon them for the corn to tiller. The winter\nwheat was well enough, being sturdy and strong-sided; but the spring\nwheat and the barley and the oats were overrun by ill weeds growing\nfaster. Therefore, as the old saying is,--\n\n    \"Farmer, that thy wife may thrive,\n     Let not burr and burdock wive;\n     And if thou wouldst keep thy son,\n     See that bine and gith have none.\"\n\nSo we were compelled to go down the field and up it, striking in and out\nwith care where the green blades hung together, so that each had space\nto move in and to spread its roots abroad. And I do assure you now,\nthough you may not believe me, it was harder work to keep John Fry, Bill\nDadds, and Jem Slocomb all in a line and all moving nimbly to the tune\nof my own tool, than it was to set out in the morning alone, and hoe\nhalf an acre by dinner-time. For, instead of keeping the good ash\nmoving, they would for ever be finding something to look at or to speak\nof, or at any rate, to stop with; blaming the shape of their tools\nperhaps, or talking about other people's affairs; or, what was most\nirksome of all to me, taking advantage as married men, and whispering\njokes of no excellence about my having, or having not, or being ashamed\nof a sweetheart. And this went so far at last that I was forced to take\ntwo of them and knock their heads together; after which they worked with\na better will.\n\nWhen we met together in the evening round the kitchen chimney-place,\nafter the men had had their supper and their heavy boots were gone, my\nmother and Eliza would do their very utmost to learn what I was thinking\nof. Not that we kept any fire now, after the crock was emptied; but that\nwe loved to see the ashes cooling, and to be together. At these times\nAnnie would never ask me any crafty questions (as Eliza did), but would\nsit with her hair untwined, and one hand underneath her chin, sometimes\nlooking softly at me, as much as to say that she knew it all and I was\nno worse off than she. But strange to say my mother dreamed not, even\nfor an instant, that it was possible for Annie to be thinking of such\na thing. She was so very good and quiet, and careful of the linen, and\nclever about the cookery and fowls and bacon-curing, that people used\nto laugh, and say she would never look at a bachelor until her mother\nordered her. But I (perhaps from my own condition and the sense of what\nit was) felt no certainty about this, and even had another opinion, as\nwas said before.\n\nOften I was much inclined to speak to her about it, and put her on her\nguard against the approaches of Tom Faggus; but I could not find how to\nbegin, and feared to make a breach between us; knowing that if her\nmind was set, no words of mine would alter it; although they needs must\ngrieve her deeply. Moreover, I felt that, in this case, a certain\nhomely Devonshire proverb would come home to me; that one, I mean, which\nrecords that the crock was calling the kettle smutty. Not, of course,\nthat I compared my innocent maid to a highwayman; but that Annie might\nthink her worse, and would be too apt to do so, if indeed she loved Tom\nFaggus. And our Cousin Tom, by this time, was living a quiet and godly\nlife; having retired almost from the trade (except when he needed\nexcitement, or came across public officers), and having won the esteem\nof all whose purses were in his power.\n\nPerhaps it is needless for me to say that all this time while my month\nwas running--or rather crawling, for never month went so slow as\nthat with me--neither weed, nor seed, nor cattle, nor my own mother's\nanxiety, nor any care for my sister, kept me from looking once every\nday, and even twice on a Sunday, for any sign of Lorna. For my heart was\never weary; in the budding valleys, and by the crystal waters, looking\nat the lambs in fold, or the heifers on the mill, labouring in trickled\nfurrows, or among the beaded blades; halting fresh to see the sun lift\nover the golden-vapoured ridge; or doffing hat, from sweat of brow, to\nwatch him sink in the low gray sea; be it as it would of day, of work,\nor night, or slumber, it was a weary heart I bore, and fear was on the\nbrink of it.\n\nAll the beauty of the spring went for happy men to think of; all the\nincrease of the year was for other eyes to mark. Not a sign of any\nsunrise for me from my fount of life, not a breath to stir the dead\nleaves fallen on my heart's Spring.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nA ROYAL INVITATION\n\n[Illustration: 185.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAlthough I had, for the most part, so very stout an appetite, that none\nbut mother saw any need of encouraging me to eat, I could only manage\none true good meal in a day, at the time I speak of. Mother was in\ndespair at this, and tempted me with the whole of the rack, and even\ntalked of sending to Porlock for a druggist who came there twice in\na week; and Annie spent all her time in cooking, and even Lizzie sang\nsongs to me; for she could sing very sweetly. But my conscience told me\nthat Betty Muxworthy had some reason upon her side.\n\n\"Latt the young ozebird aloun, zay I. Makk zuch ado about un, wi'\nhogs'-puddens, and hock-bits, and lambs'-mate, and whaten bradd indade,\nand brewers' ale avore dinner-time, and her not to zit wi' no winder\naupen--draive me mad 'e doo, the ov'ee, zuch a passel of voouls. Do 'un\ngood to starve a bit; and takk zome on's wackedness out ov un.\"\n\nBut mother did not see it so; and she even sent for Nicholas Snowe\nto bring his three daughters with him, and have ale and cake in the\nparlour, and advise about what the bees were doing, and when a swarm\nmight be looked for. Being vexed about this and having to stop at home\nnearly half the evening, I lost good manners so much as to ask him (even\nin our own house!) what he meant by not mending the swing-hurdle where\nthe Lynn stream flows from our land into his, and which he is bound to\nmaintain. But he looked at me in a superior manner, and said, \"Business,\nyoung man, in business time.\"\n\nI had other reason for being vexed with Farmer Nicholas just now, viz.\nthat I had heard a rumour, after church one Sunday--when most of all we\nsorrow over the sins of one another--that Master Nicholas Snowe had\nbeen seen to gaze tenderly at my mother, during a passage of the sermon,\nwherein the parson spoke well and warmly about the duty of Christian\nlove. Now, putting one thing with another, about the bees, and about\nsome ducks, and a bullock with a broken knee-cap, I more than suspected\nthat Farmer Nicholas was casting sheep's eyes at my mother; not only to\nsave all further trouble in the matter of the hurdle, but to override me\naltogether upon the difficult question of damming. And I knew quite well\nthat John Fry's wife never came to help at the washing without declaring\nthat it was a sin for a well-looking woman like mother, with plenty\nto live on, and only three children, to keep all the farmers for miles\naround so unsettled in their minds about her. Mother used to answer \"Oh\nfie, Mistress Fry! be good enough to mind your own business.\" But we\nalways saw that she smoothed her apron, and did her hair up afterwards,\nand that Mistress Fry went home at night with a cold pig's foot or a\nbowl of dripping.\n\n[Illustration: 186.jpg Mistress Ridd]\n\nTherefore, on that very night, as I could not well speak to mother\nabout it, without seeming undutiful, after lighting the three young\nladies--for so in sooth they called themselves--all the way home with\nour stable-lanthorn, I begged good leave of Farmer Nicholas (who had\nhung some way behind us) to say a word in private to him, before he\nentered his own house.\n\n\"Wi' all the plaisure in laife, my zon,\" he answered very graciously,\nthinking perhaps that I was prepared to speak concerning Sally.\n\n\"Now, Farmer Nicholas Snowe,\" I said, scarce knowing how to begin it,\n\"you must promise not to be vexed with me, for what I am going to say to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Vaxed wi' thee! Noo, noo, my lad. I 'ave a knowed thee too long for\nthat. And thy veyther were my best friend, afore thee. Never wronged his\nneighbours, never spak an unkind word, never had no maneness in him.\nTuk a vancy to a nice young 'ooman, and never kep her in doubt about it,\nthough there wadn't mooch to zettle on her. Spak his maind laike a man,\nhe did, and right happy he were wi' her. Ah, well a day! Ah, God knoweth\nbest. I never shall zee his laike again. And he were the best judge of a\ndung-heap anywhere in this county.\"\n\n\"Well, Master Snowe,\" I answered him, \"it is very handsome of you to\nsay so. And now I am going to be like my father, I am going to speak my\nmind.\"\n\n\"Raight there, lad; raight enough, I reckon. Us has had enough of\npralimbinary.\"\n\n\"Then what I want to say is this--I won't have any one courting my\nmother.\"\n\n\"Coortin' of thy mother, lad?\" cried Farmer Snowe, with as much\namazement as if the thing were impossible; \"why, who ever hath been\ndooin' of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, courting of my mother, sir. And you know best who comes doing it.\"\n\n\"Wull, wull! What will boys be up to next? Zhud a' thought herzelf wor\nthe proper judge. No thank 'ee, lad, no need of thy light. Know the wai\nto my own door, at laste; and have a raight to goo there.\" And he shut\nme out without so much as offering me a drink of cider.\n\nThe next afternoon, when work was over, I had seen to the horses, for\nnow it was foolish to trust John Fry, because he had so many children,\nand his wife had taken to scolding; and just as I was saying to myself\nthat in five days more my month would be done, and myself free to seek\nLorna, a man came riding up from the ford where the road goes through\nthe Lynn stream. As soon as I saw that it was not Tom Faggus, I went no\nfarther to meet him, counting that it must be some traveller bound\nfor Brendon or Cheriton, and likely enough he would come and beg for a\ndraught of milk or cider; and then on again, after asking the way.\n\nBut instead of that, he stopped at our gate, and stood up from his\nsaddle, and halloed as if he were somebody; and all the time he was\nflourishing a white thing in the air, like the bands our parson weareth.\nSo I crossed the court-yard to speak with him.\n\n\"Service of the King!\" he saith; \"service of our lord the King! Come\nhither, thou great yokel, at risk of fine and imprisonment.\"\n\nAlthough not pleased with this, I went to him, as became a loyal man;\nquite at my leisure, however, for there is no man born who can hurry me,\nthough I hasten for any woman.\n\n\"Plover Barrows farm!\" said he; \"God only knows how tired I be. Is there\nany where in this cursed county a cursed place called Plover Barrows\nfarm? For last twenty mile at least they told me 'twere only half a mile\nfarther, or only just round corner. Now tell me that, and I fain would\nthwack thee if thou wert not thrice my size.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I replied, \"you shall not have the trouble. This is Plover's\nBarrows farm, and you are kindly welcome. Sheep's kidneys is for supper,\nand the ale got bright from the tapping. But why do you think ill of us?\nWe like not to be cursed so.\"\n\n\"Nay, I think no ill,\" he said; \"sheep's kidneys is good, uncommon good,\nif they do them without burning. But I be so galled in the saddle ten\ndays, and never a comely meal of it. And when they hear 'King's service'\ncried, they give me the worst of everything. All the way down from\nLondon, I had a rogue of a fellow in front of me, eating the fat of\nthe land before me, and every one bowing down to him. He could go three\nmiles to my one though he never changed his horse. He might have robbed\nme at any minute, if I had been worth the trouble. A red mare he rideth,\nstrong in the loins, and pointed quite small in the head. I shall live\nto see him hanged yet.\"\n\nAll this time he was riding across the straw of our courtyard, getting\nhis weary legs out of the leathers, and almost afraid to stand yet. A\ncoarse-grained, hard-faced man he was, some forty years of age or so,\nand of middle height and stature. He was dressed in a dark brown riding\nsuit, none the better for Exmoor mud, but fitting him very differently\nfrom the fashion of our tailors. Across the holsters lay his cloak,\nmade of some red skin, and shining from the sweating of the horse. As I\nlooked down on his stiff bright head-piece, small quick eyes and black\nneedly beard, he seemed to despise me (too much, as I thought) for a\nmere ignoramus and country bumpkin.\n\n\"Annie, have down the cut ham,\" I shouted, for my sister was come to the\ndoor by chance, or because of the sound of a horse in the road, \"and\ncut a few rashers of hung deer's meat. There is a gentleman come to sup,\nAnnie. And fetch the hops out of the tap with a skewer that it may run\nmore sparkling.\"\n\n\"I wish I may go to a place never meant for me,\" said my new friend, now\nwiping his mouth with the sleeve of his brown riding coat, \"if ever I\nfell among such good folk. You are the right sort, and no error therein.\nAll this shall go in your favour greatly, when I make deposition. At\nleast, I mean, if it be as good in the eating as in the hearing. 'Tis\na supper quite fit for Tom Faggus himself, the man who hath stolen\nmy victuals so. And that hung deer's meat, now is it of the red deer\nrunning wild in these parts?\"\n\n\"To be sure it is, sir,\" I answered; \"where should we get any other?\"\n\n\"Right, right, you are right, my son. I have heard that the flavour\nis marvellous. Some of them came and scared me so, in the fog of the\nmorning, that I hungered for them ever since. Ha, ha, I saw their\nhaunches. But the young lady will not forget--art sure she will not\nforget it?\"\n\n\"You may trust her to forget nothing, sir, that may tempt a guest to his\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"In faith, then, I will leave my horse in your hands, and be off for\nit. Half the pleasure of the mouth is in the nose beforehand. But stay,\nalmost I forgot my business, in the hurry which thy tongue hath spread\nthrough my lately despairing belly. Hungry I am, and sore of body, from\nmy heels right upward, and sorest in front of my doublet, yet may I not\nrest nor bite barley-bread, until I have seen and touched John Ridd. God\ngrant that he be not far away; I must eat my saddle, if it be so.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, good sir,\" I answered; \"you have seen and touched John\nRidd. I am he, and not one likely to go beneath a bushel.\"\n\n\"It would take a large bushel to hold thee, John Ridd. In the name of\nthe King, His Majesty, Charles the Second, these presents!\"\n\nHe touched me with the white thing which I had first seen him waving,\nand which I now beheld to be sheepskin, such as they call parchment.\nIt was tied across with cord, and fastened down in every corner\nwith unsightly dabs of wax. By order of the messenger (for I was\nover-frightened now to think of doing anything), I broke enough of seals\nto keep an Easter ghost from rising; and there I saw my name in large;\nGod grant such another shock may never befall me in my old age.\n\n\"Read, my son; read, thou great fool, if indeed thou canst read,\" said\nthe officer to encourage me; \"there is nothing to kill thee, boy, and\nmy supper will be spoiling. Stare not at me so, thou fool; thou art big\nenough to eat me; read, read, read.\"\n\n[Illustration: 190.jpg Read, Read Read!]\n\n\"If you please, sir, what is your name?\" I asked; though why I asked him\nI know not, except from fear of witchcraft.\n\n\"Jeremy Stickles is my name, lad, nothing more than a poor apparitor of\nthe worshipful Court of King's Bench. And at this moment a starving one,\nand no supper for me unless thou wilt read.\"\n\nBeing compelled in this way, I read pretty nigh as follows; not that I\ngive the whole of it, but only the gist and the emphasis,--\n\n\"To our good subject, John Ridd, etc.\"--describing me ever so much\nbetter than I knew myself--\"by these presents, greeting. These are to\nrequire thee, in the name of our lord the King, to appear in person\nbefore the Right Worshipful, the Justices of His Majesty's Bench at\nWestminster, laying aside all thine own business, and there to deliver\nsuch evidence as is within thy cognisance, touching certain matters\nwhereby the peace of our said lord the King, and the well-being of this\nrealm, is, are, or otherwise may be impeached, impugned, imperilled, or\notherwise detrimented. As witness these presents.\" And then there were\nfour seals, and then a signature I could not make out, only that it\nbegan with a J, and ended with some other writing, done almost in a\ncircle. Underneath was added in a different handwriting \"Charges will be\nborne. The matter is full urgent.\"\n\nThe messenger watched me, while I read so much as I could read of it;\nand he seemed well pleased with my surprise, because he had expected it.\nThen, not knowing what else to do, I looked again at the cover, and\non the top of it I saw, \"Ride, Ride, Ride! On His Gracious Majesty's\nbusiness; spur and spare not.\"\n\nIt may be supposed by all who know me, that I was taken hereupon with\nsuch a giddiness in my head and noisiness in my ears, that I was forced\nto hold by the crook driven in below the thatch for holding of the\nhay-rakes. There was scarcely any sense left in me, only that the thing\nwas come by power of Mother Melldrum, because I despised her warning,\nand had again sought Lorna. But the officer was grieved for me, and the\ndanger to his supper.\n\n\"My son, be not afraid,\" he said; \"we are not going to skin thee. Only\nthou tell all the truth, and it shall be--but never mind, I will tell\nthee all about it, and how to come out harmless, if I find thy victuals\ngood, and no delay in serving them.\"\n\n\"We do our best, sir, without bargain,\" said I, \"to please our\nvisitors.\"\n\nBut when my mother saw that parchment (for we could not keep it from\nher) she fell away into her favourite bed of stock gilly-flowers, which\nshe had been tending; and when we brought her round again, did nothing\nbut exclaim against the wickedness of the age and people. \"It was\nuseless to tell her; she knew what it was, and so should all the parish\nknow. The King had heard what her son was, how sober, and quiet, and\ndiligent, and the strongest young man in England; and being himself such\na reprobate--God forgive her for saying so--he could never rest till\nhe got poor Johnny, and made him as dissolute as himself. And if he did\nthat\"--here mother went off into a fit of crying; and Annie minded her\nface, while Lizzie saw that her gown was in comely order.\n\nBut the character of the King improved, when Master Jeremy Stickles\n(being really moved by the look of it, and no bad man after all) laid it\nclearly before my mother that the King on his throne was unhappy, until\nhe had seen John Ridd. That the fame of John had gone so far, and his\nsize, and all his virtues--that verily by the God who made him, the King\nwas overcome with it.\n\nThen mother lay back in her garden chair, and smiled upon the whole of\nus, and most of all on Jeremy; looking only shyly on me, and speaking\nthrough some break of tears. \"His Majesty shall have my John; His\nMajesty is very good: but only for a fortnight. I want no titles for\nhim. Johnny is enough for me; and Master John for the working men.\"\n\nNow though my mother was so willing that I should go to London,\nexpecting great promotion and high glory for me, I myself was deeply\ngone into the pit of sorrow. For what would Lorna think of me? Here was\nthe long month just expired, after worlds of waiting; there would be her\nlovely self, peeping softly down the glen, and fearing to encourage me;\nyet there would be nobody else, and what an insult to her! Dwelling upon\nthis, and seeing no chance of escape from it, I could not find one wink\nof sleep; though Jeremy Stickles (who slept close by) snored loud enough\nto spare me some. For I felt myself to be, as it were, in a place of\nsome importance; in a situation of trust, I may say; and bound not to\ndepart from it. For who could tell what the King might have to say to\nme about the Doones--and I felt that they were at the bottom of this\nstrange appearance--or what His Majesty might think, if after receiving\na message from him (trusty under so many seals) I were to violate\nhis faith in me as a churchwarden's son, and falsely spread his words\nabroad?\n\nPerhaps I was not wise in building such a wall of scruples.\nNevertheless, all that was there, and weighed upon me heavily. And at\nlast I made up my mind to this, that even Lorna must not know the reason\nof my going, neither anything about it; but that she might know I was\ngone a long way from home, and perhaps be sorry for it. Now how was I to\nlet her know even that much of the matter, without breaking compact?\n\nPuzzling on this, I fell asleep, after the proper time to get up; nor\nwas I to be seen at breakfast time; and mother (being quite strange to\nthat) was very uneasy about it. But Master Stickles assured her that the\nKing's writ often had that effect, and the symptom was a good one.\n\n\"Now, Master Stickles, when must we start?\" I asked him, as he lounged\nin the yard gazing at our turkey poults picking and running in the sun\nto the tune of their father's gobble. \"Your horse was greatly foundered,\nsir, and is hardly fit for the road to-day; and Smiler was sledding\nyesterday all up the higher Cleve; and none of the rest can carry me.\"\n\n\"In a few more years,\" replied the King's officer, contemplating me with\nmuch satisfaction; \"'twill be a cruelty to any horse to put thee on his\nback, John.\"\n\nMaster Stickles, by this time, was quite familiar with us, calling\nme \"Jack,\" and Eliza \"Lizzie,\" and what I liked the least of all, our\npretty Annie \"Nancy.\"\n\n\"That will be as God pleases, sir,\" I answered him, rather sharply; \"and\nthe horse that suffers will not be thine. But I wish to know when we\nmust start upon our long travel to London town. I perceive that the\nmatter is of great despatch and urgency.\"\n\n\"To be sure, so it is, my son. But I see a yearling turkey there, him\nI mean with the hop in his walk, who (if I know aught of fowls) would\nroast well to-morrow. Thy mother must have preparation: it is no more\nthan reasonable. Now, have that turkey killed to-night (for his fatness\nmakes me long for him), and we will have him for dinner to-morrow, with,\nperhaps, one of his brethren; and a few more collops of red deer's flesh\nfor supper, and then on the Friday morning, with the grace of God, we\nwill set our faces to the road, upon His Majesty's business.\"\n\n\"Nay, but good sir,\" I asked with some trembling, so eager was I to see\nLorna; \"if His Majesty's business will keep till Friday, may it not keep\nuntil Monday? We have a litter of sucking-pigs, excellently choice and\nwhite, six weeks old, come Friday. There be too many for the sow, and\none of them needeth roasting. Think you not it would be a pity to leave\nthe women to carve it?\"\n\n\"My son Jack,\" replied Master Stickles, \"never was I in such quarters\nyet: and God forbid that I should be so unthankful to Him as to hurry\naway. And now I think on it, Friday is not a day upon which pious people\nlove to commence an enterprise. I will choose the young pig to-morrow at\nnoon, at which time they are wont to gambol; and we will celebrate his\nbirthday by carving him on Friday. After that we will gird our loins,\nand set forth early on Saturday.\"\n\nNow this was little better to me than if we had set forth at once.\nSunday being the very first day upon which it would be honourable for me\nto enter Glen Doone. But though I tried every possible means with Master\nJeremy Stickles, offering him the choice for dinner of every beast\nthat was on the farm, he durst not put off our departure later than the\nSaturday. And nothing else but love of us and of our hospitality would\nhave so persuaded him to remain with us till then. Therefore now my only\nchance of seeing Lorna, before I went, lay in watching from the cliff\nand espying her, or a signal from her.\n\nThis, however, I did in vain, until my eyes were weary and often would\ndelude themselves with hope of what they ached for. But though I lay\nhidden behind the trees upon the crest of the stony fall, and waited\nso quiet that the rabbits and squirrels played around me, and even the\nkeen-eyed weasel took me for a trunk of wood--it was all as one; no cast\nof colour changed the white stone, whose whiteness now was hateful to\nme; nor did wreath or skirt of maiden break the loneliness of the vale.\n\n[Illustration: 194.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nA SAFE PASS FOR KING'S MESSENGER\n\n[Illustration: 195.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nA journey to London seemed to us in those bygone days as hazardous and\ndark an adventure as could be forced on any man. I mean, of course,\na poor man; for to a great nobleman, with ever so many outriders,\nattendants, and retainers, the risk was not so great, unless the\nhighwaymen knew of their coming beforehand, and so combined against\nthem. To a poor man, however, the risk was not so much from those\ngentlemen of the road as from the more ignoble footpads, and the\nlandlords of the lesser hostels, and the loose unguarded soldiers, over\nand above the pitfalls and the quagmires of the way; so that it was hard\nto settle, at the first outgoing whether a man were wise to pray more\nfor his neck or for his head.\n\nBut nowadays it is very different. Not that highway-men are scarce, in\nthis the reign of our good Queen Anne; for in truth they thrive as\nwell as ever, albeit they deserve it not, being less upright and\ncourteous--but that the roads are much improved, and the growing use\nof stage-waggons (some of which will travel as much as forty miles in a\nsummer day) has turned our ancient ideas of distance almost upside down;\nand I doubt whether God be pleased with our flying so fast away from\nHim. However, that is not my business; nor does it lie in my mouth to\nspeak very strongly upon the subject, seeing how much I myself have done\ntowards making of roads upon Exmoor.\n\nTo return to my story (and, in truth, I lose that road too often), it\nwould have taken ten King's messengers to get me away from Plover's\nBarrows without one goodbye to Lorna, but for my sense of the trust\nand reliance which His Majesty had reposed in me. And now I felt most\nbitterly how the very arrangements which seemed so wise, and indeed\ningenious, may by the force of events become our most fatal obstacles.\nFor lo! I was blocked entirely from going to see Lorna; whereas\nwe should have fixed it so that I as well might have the power of\nsignalling my necessity.\n\nIt was too late now to think of that; and so I made up my mind at last\nto keep my honour on both sides, both to the King and to the maiden,\nalthough I might lose everything except a heavy heart for it. And\nindeed, more hearts than mine were heavy; for when it came to the tug of\nparting, my mother was like, and so was Annie, to break down altogether.\nBut I bade them be of good cheer, and smiled in the briskest manner upon\nthem, and said that I should be back next week as one of His Majesty's\ngreatest captains, and told them not to fear me then. Upon which they\nsmiled at the idea of ever being afraid of me, whatever dress I might\nhave on; and so I kissed my hand once more, and rode away very bravely.\nBut bless your heart, I could no more have done so than flown all the\nway to London if Jeremy Stickles had not been there.\n\nAnd not to take too much credit to myself in this matter, I must confess\nthat when we were come to the turn in the road where the moor begins,\nand whence you see the last of the yard, and the ricks and the poultry\nround them and can (by knowing the place) obtain a glance of the kitchen\nwindow under the walnut-tree, it went so hard with me just here that I\neven made pretence of a stone in ancient Smiler's shoe, to dismount, and\nto bend my head awhile. Then, knowing that those I had left behind would\nbe watching to see the last of me, and might have false hopes of my\ncoming back, I mounted again with all possible courage, and rode after\nJeremy Stickles.\n\n[Illustration: 197.jpg Jeremy kept me in jokes]\n\nJeremy, seeing how much I was down, did his best to keep me up with\njokes, and tales, and light discourse, until, before we had ridden a\nleague, I began to long to see the things he was describing. The air,\nthe weather, and the thoughts of going to a wondrous place, added to\nthe fine company--at least so Jeremy said it was--of a man who knew all\nLondon, made me feel that I should be ungracious not to laugh a little.\nAnd being very simple then I laughed no more a little, but something\nquite considerable (though free from consideration) at the strange\nthings Master Stickles told me, and his strange way of telling them.\nAnd so we became very excellent friends, for he was much pleased with my\nlaughing.\n\nNot wishing to thrust myself more forward than need be in this\nnarrative, I have scarcely thought it becoming or right to speak of my\nown adornments. But now, what with the brave clothes I had on, and the\nbetter ones still that were packed up in the bag behind the saddle,\nit is almost beyond me to forbear saying that I must have looked very\npleasing. And many a time I wished, going along, that Lorna could only\nbe here and there, watching behind a furze-bush, looking at me, and\nwondering how much my clothes had cost. For mother would have no\nstint in the matter, but had assembled at our house, immediately upon\nknowledge of what was to be about London, every man known to be a good\nstitcher upon our side of Exmoor. And for three days they had\nworked their best, without stint of beer or cider, according to the\nconstitution of each. The result, so they all declared, was such as to\ncreate admiration, and defy competition in London. And to me it seemed\nthat they were quite right; though Jeremy Stickles turned up his nose,\nand feigned to be deaf in the business.\n\nNow be that matter as you please--for the point is not worth\narguing--certain it is that my appearance was better than it had been\nbefore. For being in the best clothes, one tries to look and to act\n(so far as may be) up to the quality of them. Not only for the fear of\nsoiling them, but that they enlarge a man's perception of his value. And\nit strikes me that our sins arise, partly from disdain of others, but\nmainly from contempt of self, both working the despite of God. But men\nof mind may not be measured by such paltry rule as this.\n\nBy dinner-time we arrived at Porlock, and dined with my old friend,\nMaster Pooke, now growing rich and portly. For though we had plenty of\nvictuals with us we were not to begin upon them, until all chance of\nvictualling among our friends was left behind. And during that first day\nwe had no need to meddle with our store at all; for as had been settled\nbefore we left home, we lay that night at Dunster in the house of\na worthy tanner, first cousin to my mother, who received us very\ncordially, and undertook to return old Smiler to his stable at Plover's\nBarrows, after one day's rest.\n\nThence we hired to Bridgwater; and from Bridgwater on to Bristowe,\nbreaking the journey between the two. But although the whole way was so\nnew to me, and such a perpetual source of conflict, that the remembrance\nstill abides with me, as if it were but yesterday, I must not be so long\nin telling as it was in travelling, or you will wish me farther;\nboth because Lorna was nothing there, and also because a man in our\nneighbourhood had done the whole of it since my time, and feigns to\nthink nothing of it. However, one thing, in common justice to a person\nwho has been traduced, I am bound to mention. And this is, that being\ntwo of us, and myself of such magnitude, we never could have made our\njourney without either fight or running, but for the free pass which\ndear Annie, by some means (I know not what), had procured from Master\nFaggus. And when I let it be known, by some hap, that I was the own\ncousin of Tom Faggus, and honoured with his society, there was not\na house upon the road but was proud to entertain me, in spite of my\nfellow-traveller, bearing the red badge of the King.\n\n\"I will keep this close, my son Jack,\" he said, having stripped it off\nwith a carving-knife; \"your flag is the best to fly. The man who starved\nme on the way down, the same shall feed me fat going home.\"\n\nTherefore we pursued our way, in excellent condition, having thriven\nupon the credit of that very popular highwayman, and being surrounded\nwith regrets that he had left the profession, and sometimes begged to\nintercede that he might help the road again. For all the landlords on\nthe road declared that now small ale was drunk, nor much of spirits\ncalled for, because the farmers need not prime to meet only common\nriders, neither were these worth the while to get drunk with afterwards.\nMaster Stickles himself undertook, as an officer of the King's Justices\nto plead this case with Squire Faggus (as everybody called him now), and\nto induce him, for the general good, to return to his proper ministry.\n\nIt was a long and weary journey, although the roads are wondrous good on\nthe farther side of Bristowe, and scarcely any man need be bogged, if he\nkeeps his eyes well open, save, perhaps, in Berkshire. In consequence\nof the pass we had, and the vintner's knowledge of it, we only met\ntwo public riders, one of whom made off straightway when he saw my\ncompanion's pistols and the stout carbine I bore; and the other came to\na parley with us, and proved most kind and affable, when he knew\nhimself in the presence of the cousin of Squire Faggus. \"God save you,\ngentlemen,\" he cried, lifting his hat politely; \"many and many a happy\nday I have worked this road with him. Such times will never be again.\nBut commend me to his love and prayers. King my name is, and King my\nnature. Say that, and none will harm you.\" And so he made off down the\nhill, being a perfect gentleman, and a very good horse he was riding.\n\nThe night was falling very thick by the time we were come to Tyburn, and\nhere the King's officer decided that it would be wise to halt, because\nthe way was unsafe by night across the fields to Charing village. I for\nmy part was nothing loth, and preferred to see London by daylight.\n\nAnd after all, it was not worth seeing, but a very hideous and dirty\nplace, not at all like Exmoor. Some of the shops were very fine, and\nthe signs above them finer still, so that I was never weary of standing\nstill to look at them. But in doing this there was no ease; for before\none could begin almost to make out the meaning of them, either some\nof the wayfarers would bustle and scowl, and draw their swords, or the\nowner, or his apprentice boys, would rush out and catch hold of me,\ncrying, \"Buy, buy, buy! What d'ye lack, what d'ye lack? Buy, buy, buy!\"\nAt first I mistook the meaning of this--for so we pronounce the word\n\"boy\" upon Exmoor--and I answered with some indignation, \"Sirrah, I am\nno boy now, but a man of one-and-twenty years; and as for lacking, I\nlack naught from thee, except what thou hast not--good manners.\"\n\nThe only things that pleased me much, were the river Thames, and the\nhall and church of Westminster, where there are brave things to be seen,\nand braver still to think about. But whenever I wandered in the streets,\nwhat with the noise the people made, the number of the coaches, the\nrunning of the footmen, the swaggering of great courtiers, and the\nthrusting aside of everybody, many and many a time I longed to be back\namong the sheep again, for fear of losing temper. They were welcome to\nthe wall for me, as I took care to tell them, for I could stand without\nthe wall, which perhaps was more than they could do. Though I said this\nwith the best intention, meaning no discourtesy, some of them were vexed\nat it; and one young lord, being flushed with drink, drew his sword and\nmade at me. But I struck it up with my holly stick, so that it flew on\nthe roof of a house, then I took him by the belt with one hand, and laid\nhim in the kennel. This caused some little disturbance; but none of the\nrest saw fit to try how the matter might be with them.\n\nNow this being the year of our Lord 1683, more than nine years and a\nhalf since the death of my father, and the beginning of this history,\nall London was in a great ferment about the dispute between the Court of\nthe King and the City. The King, or rather perhaps his party (for they\nsaid that His Majesty cared for little except to have plenty of money\nand spend it), was quite resolved to be supreme in the appointment of\nthe chief officers of the corporation. But the citizens maintained that\n(under their charter) this right lay entirely with themselves; upon\nwhich a writ was issued against them for forfeiture of their charter;\nand the question was now being tried in the court of His Majesty's\nbench.\n\nThis seemed to occupy all the attention of the judges, and my case\n(which had appeared so urgent) was put off from time to time, while\nthe Court and the City contended. And so hot was the conflict and hate\nbetween them, that a sheriff had been fined by the King in 100,000\npounds, and a former lord mayor had even been sentenced to the pillory,\nbecause he would not swear falsely. Hence the courtiers and the citizens\nscarce could meet in the streets with patience, or without railing and\nfrequent blows.\n\nNow although I heard so much of this matter, for nothing else was talked\nof, and it seeming to me more important even than the churchwardenship\nof Oare, I could not for the life of me tell which side I should take\nto. For all my sense of position, and of confidence reposed in me, and\nof my father's opinions, lay heavily in one scale, while all my reason\nand my heart went down plump against injustice, and seemed to win the\nother scale. Even so my father had been, at the breaking out of the\ncivil war, when he was less than my age now, and even less skilled in\npolitics; and my mother told me after this, when she saw how I myself\nwas doubting, and vexed with myself for doing so, that my father used\nto thank God often that he had not been called upon to take one side or\nother, but might remain obscure and quiet. And yet he always considered\nhimself to be a good, sound Royalist.\n\nBut now as I stayed there, only desirous to be heard and to get away,\nand scarcely even guessing yet what was wanted of me (for even Jeremy\nStickles knew not, or pretended not to know), things came to a dreadful\npass between the King and all the people who dared to have an opinion.\nFor about the middle of June, the judges gave their sentence, that the\nCity of London had forfeited its charter, and that its franchise should\nbe taken into the hands of the King. Scarcely was this judgment forth,\nand all men hotly talking of it, when a far worse thing befell. News of\nsome great conspiracy was spread at every corner, and that a man in the\nmalting business had tried to take up the brewer's work, and lop the\nKing and the Duke of York. Everybody was shocked at this, for the King\nhimself was not disliked so much as his advisers; but everybody was more\nthan shocked, grieved indeed to the heart with pain, at hearing that\nLord William Russell and Mr. Algernon Sidney had been seized and sent to\nthe Tower of London, upon a charge of high treason.\n\nHaving no knowledge of these great men, nor of the matter how far it was\ntrue, I had not very much to say about either of them or it; but this\nsilence was not shared (although the ignorance may have been) by the\nhundreds of people around me. Such a commotion was astir, such universal\nsense of wrong, and stern resolve to right it, that each man grasped his\nfellow's hand, and led him into the vintner's. Even I, although at that\ntime given to excess in temperance, and afraid of the name of cordials,\nwas hard set (I do assure you) not to be drunk at intervals without\ncoarse discourtesy.\n\nHowever, that (as Betty Muxworthy used to say, when argued down, and\nready to take the mop for it) is neither here nor there. I have naught\nto do with great history and am sorry for those who have to write it;\nbecause they are sure to have both friends and enemies in it, and cannot\nact as they would towards them, without damage to their own consciences.\n\nBut as great events draw little ones, and the rattle of the churn\ndecides the uncertainty of the flies, so this movement of the town, and\neloquence, and passion had more than I guessed at the time, to do with\nmy own little fortunes. For in the first place it was fixed (perhaps\nfrom down right contumely, because the citizens loved him so) that Lord\nRussell should be tried neither at Westminster nor at Lincoln's Inn, but\nat the Court of Old Bailey, within the precincts of the city. This kept\nme hanging on much longer; because although the good nobleman was to be\ntried by the Court of Common Pleas, yet the officers of King's Bench, to\nwhom I daily applied myself, were in counsel with their fellows, and put\nme off from day to day.\n\nNow I had heard of the law's delays, which the greatest of all great\npoets (knowing much of the law himself, as indeed of everything) has\nspecially mentioned, when not expected, among the many ills of life. But\nI never thought at my years to have such bitter experience of the evil;\nand it seemed to me that if the lawyers failed to do their duty, they\nought to pay people for waiting upon them, instead of making them pay\nfor it. But here I was, now in the second month living at my own\ncharges in the house of a worthy fellmonger at the sign of the Seal and\nSquirrel, abutting upon the Strand road which leads from Temple Bar\nto Charing. Here I did very well indeed, having a mattress of good\nskin-dressings, and plenty to eat every day of my life, but the butter\nwas something to cry \"but\" thrice at (according to a conceit of our\nschool days), and the milk must have come from cows driven to water.\nHowever, these evils were light compared with the heavy bill sent up to\nme every Saturday afternoon; and knowing how my mother had pinched to\nsend me nobly to London, and had told me to spare for nothing, but live\nbravely with the best of them, the tears very nearly came into my eyes,\nas I thought, while I ate, of so robbing her.\n\nAt length, being quite at the end of my money, and seeing no other help\nfor it, I determined to listen to clerks no more, but force my way up to\nthe Justices, and insist upon being heard by them, or discharged from my\nrecognisance. For so they had termed the bond or deed which I had been\nforced to execute, in the presence of a chief clerk or notary, the very\nday after I came to London. And the purport of it was, that on pain of\na heavy fine or escheatment, I would hold myself ready and present, to\ngive evidence when called upon. Having delivered me up to sign this,\nJeremy Stickles was quit of me, and went upon other business, not but\nwhat he was kind and good to me, when his time and pursuits allowed of\nit.\n\n[Illustration: 203.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nA GREAT MAN ATTENDS TO BUSINESS\n\n[Illustration: 204.jpg Westminster Hall, 1650]\n\nHaving seen Lord Russell murdered in the fields of Lincoln's Inn, or\nrather having gone to see it, but turned away with a sickness and a\nbitter flood of tears--for a whiter and a nobler neck never fell\nbefore low beast--I strode away towards Westminster, cured of half my\nindignation at the death of Charles the First. Many people hurried past\nme, chiefly of the more tender sort, revolting at the butchery. In their\nghastly faces, as they turned them back, lest the sight should be coming\nafter them, great sorrow was to be seen, and horror, and pity, and some\nanger.\n\nIn Westminster Hall I found nobody; not even the crowd of crawling\nvarlets, who used to be craving evermore for employment or for payment.\nI knocked at three doors, one after other, of lobbies going out of it,\nwhere I had formerly seen some officers and people pressing in and out,\nbut for my trouble I took nothing, except some thumps from echo. And at\nlast an old man told me that all the lawyers were gone to see the result\nof their own works, in the fields of Lincoln's Inn.\n\nHowever, in a few days' time, I had better fortune; for the court was\nsitting and full of business, to clear off the arrears of work, before\nthe lawyers' holiday. As I was waiting in the hall for a good occasion,\na man with horsehair on his head, and a long blue bag in his left hand,\ntouched me gently on the arm, and led me into a quiet place. I followed\nhim very gladly, being confident that he came to me with a message from\nthe Justiciaries. But after taking pains to be sure that none could\noverhear us, he turned on me suddenly, and asked,--\n\n\"Now, John, how is your dear mother?\"\n\n\"Worshipful sir\" I answered him, after recovering from my surprise at\nhis knowledge of our affairs, and kindly interest in them, \"it is two\nmonths now since I have seen her. Would to God that I only knew how she\nis faring now, and how the business of the farm goes!\"\n\n\"Sir, I respect and admire you,\" the old gentleman replied, with a\nbow very low and genteel; \"few young court-gallants of our time are so\nreverent and dutiful. Oh, how I did love my mother!\" Here he turned up\nhis eyes to heaven, in a manner that made me feel for him and yet with a\nkind of wonder.\n\n\"I am very sorry for you, sir,\" I answered most respectfully, not\nmeaning to trespass on his grief, yet wondering at his mother's age; for\nhe seemed to be at least threescore; \"but I am no court-gallant, sir; I\nam only a farmer's son, and learning how to farm a little.\"\n\n\"Enough, John; quite enough,\" he cried, \"I can read it in thy\ncountenance. Honesty is written there, and courage and simplicity. But I\nfear that, in this town of London, thou art apt to be taken in by people\nof no principle. Ah me! Ah me! The world is bad, and I am too old to\nimprove it.\"\n\nThen finding him so good and kind, and anxious to improve the age, I\ntold him almost everything; how much I paid the fellmonger, and all the\nthings I had been to see; and how I longed to get away, before the corn\nwas ripening; yet how (despite of these desires) I felt myself bound to\nwalk up and down, being under a thing called \"recognisance.\" In short,\nI told him everything; except the nature of my summons (which I had no\nright to tell), and that I was out of money.\n\nMy tale was told in a little archway, apart from other lawyers; and the\nother lawyers seemed to me to shift themselves, and to look askew, like\nsheep through a hurdle, when the rest are feeding.\n\n\"What! Good God!\" my lawyer cried, smiting his breast indignantly with a\nroll of something learned; \"in what country do we live? Under what\nlaws are we governed? No case before the court whatever; no primary\ndeposition, so far as we are furnished; not even a King's writ\nissued--and here we have a fine young man dragged from his home and\nadoring mother, during the height of agriculture, at his own cost and\ncharges! I have heard of many grievances; but this the very worst of\nall. Nothing short of a Royal Commission could be warranty for it. This\nis not only illegal, sir, but most gravely unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"I had not told you, worthy sir,\" I answered him, in a lower tone, \"if I\ncould have thought that your sense of right would be moved so painfully.\nBut now I must beg to leave you, sir--for I see that the door again is\nopen. I beg you, worshipful sir, to accept--\"\n\nUpon this he put forth his hand and said, \"Nay, nay, my son, not two,\nnot two:\" yet looking away, that he might not scare me.\n\n\"To accept, kind sir, my very best thanks, and most respectful\nremembrances.\" And with that, I laid my hand in his. \"And if, sir, any\ncircumstances of business or of pleasure should bring you to our part\nof the world, I trust you will not forget that my mother and myself (if\never I get home again) will do our best to make you comfortable with our\npoor hospitality.\"\n\nWith this I was hasting away from him, but he held my hand and looked\nround at me. And he spoke without cordiality.\n\n\"Young man, a general invitation is no entry for my fee book. I have\nspent a good hour of business-time in mastering thy case, and stating\nmy opinion of it. And being a member of the bar, called six-and-thirty\nyears agone by the honourable society of the Inner Temple, my fee is\nat my own discretion; albeit an honorarium. For the honour of the\nprofession, and my position in it, I ought to charge thee at least five\nguineas, although I would have accepted one, offered with good will\nand delicacy. Now I will enter it two, my son, and half a crown for my\nclerk's fee.\"\n\nSaying this, he drew forth from his deep, blue bag, a red book having\nclasps to it, and endorsed in gold letters \"Fee-book\"; and before I\ncould speak (being frightened so) he had entered on a page of it, \"To\nconsideration of case as stated by John Ridd, and advising thereupon,\ntwo guineas.\"\n\n\"But sir, good sir,\" I stammered forth, not having two guineas left in\nthe world, yet grieving to confess it, \"I knew not that I was to pay,\nlearned sir. I never thought of it in that way.\"\n\n\"Wounds of God! In what way thought you that a lawyer listened to your\nrigmarole?\"\n\n\"I thought that you listened from kindness, sir, and compassion of my\ngrievous case, and a sort of liking for me.\"\n\n\"A lawyer like thee, young curmudgeon! A lawyer afford to feel\ncompassion gratis! Either thou art a very deep knave, or the greenest of\nall greenhorns. Well, I suppose, I must let thee off for one guinea, and\nthe clerk's fee. A bad business, a shocking business!\"\n\nNow, if this man had continued kind and soft, as when he heard my story,\nI would have pawned my clothes to pay him, rather than leave a debt\nbehind, although contracted unwittingly. But when he used harsh language\nso, knowing that I did not deserve it, I began to doubt within myself\nwhether he deserved my money. Therefore I answered him with some\nreadiness, such as comes sometimes to me, although I am so slow.\n\n\"Sir, I am no curmudgeon: if a young man had called me so, it would not\nhave been well with him. This money shall be paid, if due, albeit I\nhad no desire to incur the debt. You have advised me that the Court\nis liable for my expenses, so far as they be reasonable. If this be\na reasonable expense, come with me now to Lord Justice Jeffreys, and\nreceive from him the two guineas, or (it may be) five, for the counsel\nyou have given me to deny his jurisdiction.\" With these words, I took\nhis arm to lead him, for the door was open still.\n\n\"In the name of God, boy, let me go. Worthy sir, pray let me go. My wife\nis sick, and my daughter dying--in the name of God, sir, let me go.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" I said, having fast hold of him, \"I cannot let thee go\nunpaid, sir. Right is right; and thou shalt have it.\"\n\n\"Ruin is what I shall have, boy, if you drag me before that devil. He\nwill strike me from the bar at once, and starve me, and all my family.\nHere, lad, good lad, take these two guineas. Thou hast despoiled\nthe spoiler. Never again will I trust mine eyes for knowledge of a\ngreenhorn.\"\n\nHe slipped two guineas into the hand which I had hooked through his\nelbow, and spoke in an urgent whisper again, for the people came\ncrowding around us--\"For God's sake let me go, boy; another moment will\nbe too late.\"\n\n\"Learned sir,\" I answered him, \"twice you spoke, unless I err, of the\nnecessity of a clerk's fee, as a thing to be lamented.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure, my son. You have a clerk as much as I have.\nThere it is. Now I pray thee, take to the study of the law. Possession\nis nine points of it, which thou hast of me. Self-possession is the\ntenth, and that thou hast more than the other nine.\"\n\nBeing flattered by this, and by the feeling of the two guineas and\nhalf-crown, I dropped my hold upon Counsellor Kitch (for he was no less\na man than that), and he was out of sight in a second of time, wig, blue\nbag, and family. And before I had time to make up my mind what I should\ndo with his money (for of course I meant not to keep it) the crier of\nthe Court (as they told me) came out, and wanted to know who I was. I\ntold him, as shortly as I could, that my business lay with His Majesty's\nbench, and was very confidential; upon which he took me inside with\nwarning, and showed me to an under-clerk, who showed me to a higher one,\nand the higher clerk to the head one.\n\nWhen this gentleman understood all about my business (which I told him\nwithout complaint) he frowned at me very heavily, as if I had done him\nan injury.\n\n\"John Ridd,\" he asked me with a stern glance, \"is it your deliberate\ndesire to be brought into the presence of the Lord Chief Justice?\"\n\n\"Surely, sir, it has been my desire for the last two months and more.\"\n\n\"Then, John, thou shalt be. But mind one thing, not a word of thy long\ndetention, or thou mayst get into trouble.\"\n\n\"How, sir? For being detained against my own wish?\" I asked him; but he\nturned away, as if that matter were not worth his arguing, as, indeed, I\nsuppose it was not, and led me through a little passage to a door with a\ncurtain across it.\n\n\"Now, if my Lord cross-question you,\" the gentleman whispered to me,\n\"answer him straight out truth at once, for he will have it out of\nthee. And mind, he loves not to be contradicted, neither can he bear a\nhang-dog look. Take little heed of the other two; but note every word of\nthe middle one; and never make him speak twice.\"\n\nI thanked him for his good advice, as he moved the curtain and thrust me\nin, but instead of entering withdrew, and left me to bear the brunt of\nit.\n\nThe chamber was not very large, though lofty to my eyes, and dark, with\nwooden panels round it. At the further end were some raised seats, such\nas I have seen in churches, lined with velvet, and having broad elbows,\nand a canopy over the middle seat. There were only three men sitting\nhere, one in the centre, and one on each side; and all three were done\nup wonderfully with fur, and robes of state, and curls of thick gray\nhorsehair, crimped and gathered, and plaited down to their shoulders.\nEach man had an oak desk before him, set at a little distance, and\nspread with pens and papers. Instead of writing, however, they seemed\nto be laughing and talking, or rather the one in the middle seemed to\nbe telling some good story, which the others received with approval. By\nreason of their great perukes it was hard to tell how old they were; but\nthe one who was speaking seemed the youngest, although he was the chief\nof them. A thick-set, burly, and bulky man, with a blotchy broad face,\nand great square jaws, and fierce eyes full of blazes; he was one to be\ndreaded by gentle souls, and to be abhorred by the noble.\n\nBetween me and the three lord judges, some few lawyers were gathering up\nbags and papers and pens and so forth, from a narrow table in the middle\nof the room, as if a case had been disposed of, and no other were called\non. But before I had time to look round twice, the stout fierce man\nespied me, and shouted out with a flashing stare--\n\n\"How now, countryman, who art thou?\"\n\n\"May it please your worship,\" I answered him loudly, \"I am John Ridd, of\nOare parish, in the shire of Somerset, brought to this London, some two\nmonths back by a special messenger, whose name is Jeremy Stickles;\nand then bound over to be at hand and ready, when called upon to give\nevidence, in a matter unknown to me, but touching the peace of our lord\nthe King, and the well-being of his subjects. Three times I have met our\nlord the King, but he hath said nothing about his peace, and only held\nit towards me, and every day, save Sunday, I have walked up and down the\ngreat hall of Westminster, all the business part of the day, expecting\nto be called upon, yet no one hath called upon me. And now I desire to\nask your worship, whether I may go home again?\"\n\n\"Well, done, John,\" replied his lordship, while I was panting with all\nthis speech; \"I will go bail for thee, John, thou hast never made such\na long speech before; and thou art a spunky Briton, or thou couldst not\nhave made it now. I remember the matter well, and I myself will attend\nto it, although it arose before my time\"--he was but newly Chief\nJustice--\"but I cannot take it now, John. There is no fear of losing\nthee, John, any more than the Tower of London. I grieve for His\nMajesty's exchequer, after keeping thee two months or more.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, I crave your pardon. My mother hath been keeping me. Not\na groat have I received.\"\n\n\"Spank, is it so?\" his lordship cried, in a voice that shook the\ncobwebs, and the frown on his brow shook the hearts of men, and mine as\nmuch as the rest of them,--\"Spank, is His Majesty come to this, that he\nstarves his own approvers?\"\n\n\"My lord, my lord,\" whispered Mr. Spank, the chief-officer of evidence,\n\"the thing hath been overlooked, my lord, among such grave matters of\ntreason.\"\n\n\"I will overlook thy head, foul Spank, on a spike from Temple Bar, if\never I hear of the like again. Vile varlet, what art thou paid for? Thou\nhast swindled the money thyself, foul Spank; I know thee, though thou\nart new to me. Bitter is the day for thee that ever I came across thee.\nAnswer me not--one word more and I will have thee on a hurdle.\" And he\nswung himself to and fro on his bench, with both hands on his knees; and\nevery man waited to let it pass, knowing better than to speak to him.\n\n\"John Ridd,\" said the Lord Chief Justice, at last recovering a sort of\ndignity, yet daring Spank from the corners of his eyes to do so much as\nlook at him, \"thou hast been shamefully used, John Ridd. Answer me not\nboy; not a word; but go to Master Spank, and let me know how he behaves\nto thee;\" here he made a glance at Spank, which was worth at least ten\npounds to me; \"be thou here again to-morrow, and before any other case\nis taken, I will see justice done to thee. Now be off boy; thy name is\nRidd, and we are well rid of thee.\"\n\nI was only too glad to go, after all this tempest; as you may well\nsuppose. For if ever I saw a man's eyes become two holes for the devil\nto glare from, I saw it that day; and the eyes were those of the Lord\nChief Justice Jeffreys.\n\nMr. Spank was in the lobby before me, and before I had recovered\nmyself--for I was vexed with my own terror--he came up sidling and\nfawning to me, with a heavy bag of yellow leather.\n\n\"Good Master Ridd, take it all, take it all, and say a good word for me\nto his lordship. He hath taken a strange fancy to thee; and thou must\nmake the most of it. We never saw man meet him eye to eye so, and yet\nnot contradict him, and that is just what he loveth. Abide in London,\nMaster Ridd, and he will make thy fortune. His joke upon thy name proves\nthat. And I pray you remember, Master Ridd, that the Spanks are sixteen\nin family.\"\n\nBut I would not take the bag from him, regarding it as a sort of bribe\nto pay me such a lump of money, without so much as asking how great had\nbeen my expenses. Therefore I only told him that if he would kindly keep\nthe cash for me until the morrow, I would spend the rest of the day in\ncounting (which always is sore work with me) how much it had stood me in\nboard and lodging, since Master Stickles had rendered me up; for until\nthat time he had borne my expenses. In the morning I would give Mr.\nSpank a memorandum, duly signed, and attested by my landlord, including\nthe breakfast of that day, and in exchange for this I would take the\nexact amount from the yellow bag, and be very thankful for it.\n\n\"If that is thy way of using opportunity,\" said Spank, looking at me\nwith some contempt, \"thou wilt never thrive in these times, my lad. Even\nthe Lord Chief Justice can be little help to thee; unless thou knowest\nbetter than that how to help thyself.\"\n\nIt mattered not to me. The word \"approver\" stuck in my gorge, as used\nby the Lord Chief Justice; for we looked upon an approver as a very low\nthing indeed. I would rather pay for every breakfast, and even every\ndinner, eaten by me since here I came, than take money as an approver.\nAnd indeed I was much disappointed at being taken in that light, having\nunderstood that I was sent for as a trusty subject, and humble friend of\nHis Majesty.\n\nIn the morning I met Mr. Spank waiting for me at the entrance, and very\ndesirous to see me. I showed him my bill, made out in fair copy, and\nhe laughed at it, and said, \"Take it twice over, Master Ridd; once for\nthine own sake, and once for His Majesty's; as all his loyal tradesmen\ndo, when they can get any. His Majesty knows and is proud of it, for\nit shows their love of his countenance; and he says, '_bis dat qui cito\ndat_,' then how can I grumble at giving twice, when I give so slowly?\"\n\n\"Nay, I will take it but once,\" I said; \"if His Majesty loves to be\nrobbed, he need not lack of his desire, while the Spanks are sixteen in\nfamily.\"\n\nThe clerk smiled cheerfully at this, being proud of his children's\nability; and then having paid my account, he whispered,--\n\n\"He is all alone this morning, John, and in rare good humour. He hath\nbeen promised the handling of poor Master Algernon Sidney, and he\nsays he will soon make republic of him; for his state shall shortly be\nheadless. He is chuckling over his joke, like a pig with a nut; and that\nalways makes him pleasant. John Ridd, my lord!\" With that he swung up\nthe curtain bravely, and according to special orders, I stood, face to\nface, and alone with Judge Jeffreys.\n\n[Illustration: 212.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nJOHN IS DRAINED AND CAST ASIDE\n\n[Illustration: 213.jpg His Lordship busy with letters]\n\nHis lordship was busy with some letters, and did not look up for a\nminute or two, although he knew that I was there. Meanwhile I stood\nwaiting to make my bow; afraid to begin upon him, and wondering at his\ngreat bull-head. Then he closed his letters, well-pleased with their\nimport, and fixed his bold broad stare on me, as if I were an oyster\nopened, and he would know how fresh I was.\n\n\"May it please your worship,\" I said, \"here I am according to order,\nawaiting your good pleasure.\"\n\n\"Thou art made to weight, John, more than order. How much dost thou tip\nthe scales to?\"\n\n\"Only twelvescore pounds, my lord, when I be in wrestling trim. And sure\nI must have lost weight here, fretting so long in London.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! Much fret is there in thee! Hath His Majesty seen thee?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, twice or even thrice; and he made some jest concerning\nme.\"\n\n\"A very bad one, I doubt not. His humour is not so dainty as mine, but\napt to be coarse and unmannerly. Now John, or Jack, by the look of thee,\nthou art more used to be called.\"\n\n\"Yes, your worship, when I am with old Molly and Betty Muxworthy.\"\n\n\"Peace, thou forward varlet! There is a deal too much of thee. We shall\nhave to try short commons with thee, and thou art a very long common.\nHa, ha! Where is that rogue Spank? Spank must hear that by-and-by. It is\nbeyond thy great thick head, Jack.\"\n\n\"Not so, my lord; I have been at school, and had very bad jokes made\nupon me.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! It hath hit thee hard. And faith, it would be hard to miss\nthee, even with harpoon. And thou lookest like to blubber, now. Capital,\nin faith! I have thee on every side, Jack, and thy sides are manifold;\nmany-folded at any rate. Thou shalt have double expenses, Jack, for the\nwit thou hast provoked in me.\"\n\n\"Heavy goods lack heavy payment, is a proverb down our way, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ah, I hurt thee, I hurt thee, Jack. The harpoon hath no tickle for\nthee. Now, Jack Whale, having hauled thee hard, we will proceed to\nexamine thee.\" Here all his manner was changed, and he looked with his\nheavy brows bent upon me, as if he had never laughed in his life, and\nwould allow none else to do so.\n\n\"I am ready to answer, my lord,\" I replied, \"if he asks me nought beyond\nmy knowledge, or beyond my honour.\"\n\n\"Hadst better answer me everything, lump. What hast thou to do with\nhonour? Now is there in thy neighbourhood a certain nest of robbers,\nmiscreants, and outlaws, whom all men fear to handle?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. At least, I believe some of them be robbers, and all of\nthem are outlaws.\"\n\n\"And what is your high sheriff about, that he doth not hang them all? Or\nsend them up for me to hang, without more to do about them?\"\n\n\"I reckon that he is afraid, my lord; it is not safe to meddle with\nthem. They are of good birth, and reckless; and their place is very\nstrong.\"\n\n\"Good birth! What was Lord Russell of, Lord Essex, and this Sidney? 'Tis\nthe surest heirship to the block to be the chip of a good one. What is\nthe name of this pestilent race, and how many of them are there?\"\n\n\"They are the Doones of Bagworthy forest, may it please your worship.\nAnd we reckon there be about forty of them, beside the women and\nchildren.\"\n\n\"Forty Doones, all forty thieves! and women and children! Thunder of\nGod! How long have they been there then?\"\n\n\"They may have been there thirty years, my lord; and indeed they may\nhave been forty. Before the great war broke out they came, longer back\nthan I can remember.\"\n\n\"Ay, long before thou wast born, John. Good, thou speakest plainly.\nWoe betide a liar, whenso I get hold of him. Ye want me on the Western\nCircuit; by God, and ye shall have me, when London traitors are spun and\nswung. There is a family called De Whichehalse living very nigh thee,\nJohn?\"\n\nThis he said in a sudden manner, as if to take me off my guard, and\nfixed his great thick eyes on me. And in truth I was much astonished.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, there is. At least, not so very far from us. Baron de\nWhichehalse, of Ley Manor.\"\n\n\"Baron, ha! of the Exchequer--eh, lad? And taketh dues instead of His\nMajesty. Somewhat which halts there ought to come a little further, I\ntrow. It shall be seen to, as well as the witch which makes it so to\nhalt. Riotous knaves in West England, drunken outlaws, you shall dance,\nif ever I play pipe for you. John Ridd, I will come to Oare parish, and\nrout out the Oare of Babylon.\"\n\n\"Although your worship is so learned,\" I answered seeing that now he\nwas beginning to make things uneasy; \"your worship, though being Chief\nJustice, does little justice to us. We are downright good and loyal\nfolk; and I have not seen, since here I came to this great town of\nLondon, any who may better us, or even come anigh us, in honesty, and\ngoodness, and duty to our neighbours. For we are very quiet folk, not\nprating our own virtues--\"\n\n\"Enough, good John, enough! Knowest thou not that modesty is the\nmaidenhood of virtue, lost even by her own approval? Now hast thou ever\nheard or thought that De Whichehalse is in league with the Doones of\nBagworthy?\"\n\nSaying these words rather slowly, he skewered his great eyes into mine,\nso that I could not think at all, neither look at him, nor yet away.\nThe idea was so new to me that it set my wits all wandering; and looking\ninto me, he saw that I was groping for the truth.\n\n\"John Ridd, thine eyes are enough for me. I see thou hast never dreamed\nof it. Now hast thou ever seen a man whose name is Thomas Faggus?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, many and many a time. He is my own worthy cousin; and I fear\nhe that hath intentions\"--here I stopped, having no right there to speak\nabout our Annie.\n\n\"Tom Faggus is a good man,\" he said; and his great square face had a\nsmile which showed me he had met my cousin; \"Master Faggus hath made\nmistakes as to the title to property, as lawyers oftentimes may do; but\ntake him all for all, he is a thoroughly straightforward man; presents\nhis bill, and has it paid, and makes no charge for drawing it.\nNevertheless, we must tax his costs, as of any other solicitor.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure, my lord!\" was all that I could say, not\nunderstanding what all this meant.\n\n\"I fear he will come to the gallows,\" said the Lord Chief Justice,\nsinking his voice below the echoes; \"tell him this from me, Jack. He\nshall never be condemned before me; but I cannot be everywhere, and some\nof our Justices may keep short memory of his dinners. Tell him to change\nhis name, turn parson, or do something else, to make it wrong to hang\nhim. Parson is the best thing, he hath such command of features, and he\nmight take his tithes on horseback. Now a few more things, John Ridd;\nand for the present I have done with thee.\"\n\nAll my heart leaped up at this, to get away from London so: and yet I\ncould hardly trust to it.\n\n\"Is there any sound round your way of disaffection to His Majesty, His\nmost gracious Majesty?\"\n\n\"No, my lord: no sign whatever. We pray for him in church perhaps,\nand we talk about him afterwards, hoping it may do him good, as it is\nintended. But after that we have naught to say, not knowing much about\nhim--at least till I get home again.\"\n\n\"That is as it should be, John. And the less you say the better. But I\nhave heard of things in Taunton, and even nearer to you in Dulverton,\nand even nigher still upon Exmoor; things which are of the pillory\nkind, and even more of the gallows. I see that you know naught of them.\nNevertheless, it will not be long before all England hears of them. Now,\nJohn, I have taken a liking to thee, for never man told me the truth,\nwithout fear or favour, more thoroughly and truly than thou hast done.\nKeep thou clear of this, my son. It will come to nothing; yet many shall\nswing high for it. Even I could not save thee, John Ridd, if thou wert\nmixed in this affair. Keep from the Doones, keep from De Whichehalse,\nkeep from everything which leads beyond the sight of thy knowledge. I\nmeant to use thee as my tool; but I see thou art too honest and simple.\nI will send a sharper down; but never let me find thee, John, either a\ntool for the other side, or a tube for my words to pass through.\"\n\nHere the Lord Justice gave me such a glare that I wished myself well\nrid of him, though thankful for his warnings; and seeing how he had\nmade upon me a long abiding mark of fear, he smiled again in a jocular\nmanner, and said,--\n\n\"Now, get thee gone, Jack. I shall remember thee; and I trow, thou\nwilt'st not for many a day forget me.\"\n\n\"My lord, I was never so glad to go; for the hay must be in, and the\nricks unthatched, and none of them can make spars like me, and two men\nto twist every hay-rope, and mother thinking it all right, and listening\nright and left to lies, and cheated at every pig she kills, and even the\nskins of the sheep to go--\"\n\n\"John Ridd, I thought none could come nigh your folk in honesty, and\ngoodness, and duty to their neighbours!\"\n\n\"Sure enough, my lord; but by our folk, I mean ourselves, not the men\nnor women neither--\"\n\n\"That will do, John. Go thy way. Not men, nor women neither, are better\nthan they need be.\"\n\nI wished to set this matter right; but his worship would not hear me,\nand only drove me out of court, saying that men were thieves and liars,\nno more in one place than another, but all alike all over the world,\nand women not far behind them. It was not for me to dispute this point\n(though I was not yet persuaded of it), both because my lord was a\nJudge, and must know more about it, and also that being a man myself I\nmight seem to be defending myself in an unbecoming manner. Therefore I\nmade a low bow, and went; in doubt as to which had the right of it.\n\nBut though he had so far dismissed me, I was not yet quite free to\ngo, inasmuch as I had not money enough to take me all the way to Oare,\nunless indeed I should go afoot, and beg my sustenance by the way, which\nseemed to be below me. Therefore I got my few clothes packed, and my few\ndebts paid, all ready to start in half an hour, if only they would give\nme enough to set out upon the road with. For I doubted not, being young\nand strong, that I could walk from London to Oare in ten days or in\ntwelve at most, which was not much longer than horse-work; only I had\nbeen a fool, as you will say when you hear it. For after receiving from\nMaster Spank the amount of the bill which I had delivered--less indeed\nby fifty shillings than the money my mother had given me, for I had\nspent fifty shillings, and more, in seeing the town and treating people,\nwhich I could not charge to His Majesty--I had first paid all my debts\nthereout, which were not very many, and then supposing myself to be an\nestablished creditor of the Treasury for my coming needs, and already\nscenting the country air, and foreseeing the joy of my mother, what had\nI done but spent half my balance, ay and more than three-quarters of it,\nupon presents for mother, and Annie, and Lizzie, John Fry, and his wife,\nand Betty Muxworthy, Bill Dadds, Jim Slocombe, and, in a word, half of\nthe rest of the people at Oare, including all the Snowe family, who must\nhave things good and handsome? And if I must while I am about it, hide\nnothing from those who read me, I had actually bought for Lorna a thing\nthe price of which quite frightened me, till the shopkeeper said it was\nnothing at all, and that no young man, with a lady to love him, could\ndare to offer her rubbish, such as the Jew sold across the way. Now the\nmere idea of beautiful Lorna ever loving me, which he talked about as\npatly (though of course I never mentioned her) as if it were a settled\nthing, and he knew all about it, that mere idea so drove me abroad,\nthat if he had asked three times as much, I could never have counted the\nmoney.\n\nNow in all this I was a fool of course--not for remembering my friends\nand neighbours, which a man has a right to do, and indeed is bound to\ndo, when he comes from London--but for not being certified first what\ncash I had to go on with. And to my great amazement, when I went with\nanother bill for the victuals of only three days more, and a week's\nexpense on the homeward road reckoned very narrowly, Master Spank not\nonly refused to grant me any interview, but sent me out a piece of blue\npaper, looking like a butcher's ticket, and bearing these words and no\nmore, \"John Ridd, go to the devil. He who will not when he may, when he\nwill, he shall have nay.\" From this I concluded that I had lost favour\nin the sight of Chief Justice Jeffreys. Perhaps because my evidence had\nnot proved of any value! perhaps because he meant to let the matter lie,\ntill cast on him.\n\nAnyhow, it was a reason of much grief, and some anger to me, and very\ngreat anxiety, disappointment, and suspense. For here was the time of\nthe hay gone past, and the harvest of small corn coming on, and the\ntrout now rising at the yellow Sally, and the blackbirds eating our\nwhite-heart cherries (I was sure, though I could not see them), and who\nwas to do any good for mother, or stop her from weeping continually? And\nmore than this, what was become of Lorna? Perhaps she had cast me away\naltogether, as a flouter and a changeling; perhaps she had drowned\nherself in the black well; perhaps (and that was worst of all) she was\neven married, child as she was, to that vile Carver Doone, if the Doones\never cared about marrying! That last thought sent me down at once to\nwatch for Mr. Spank again, resolved that if I could catch him, spank him\nI would to a pretty good tune, although sixteen in family.\n\nHowever, there was no such thing as to find him; and the usher vowed\n(having orders I doubt) that he was gone to the sea for the good of his\nhealth, having sadly overworked himself; and that none but a poor devil\nlike himself, who never had handling of money, would stay in London this\nfoul, hot weather; which was likely to bring the plague with it. Here\nwas another new terror for me, who had heard of the plagues of London,\nand the horrible things that happened; and so going back to my lodgings\nat once, I opened my clothes and sought for spots, especially as being\nso long at a hairy fellmonger's; but finding none, I fell down and\nthanked God for that same, and vowed to start for Oare to-morrow, with\nmy carbine loaded, come weal come woe, come sun come shower; though all\nthe parish should laugh at me, for begging my way home again, after the\nbrave things said of my going, as if I had been the King's cousin.\n\nBut I was saved in some degree from this lowering of my pride, and what\nmattered more, of mother's; for going to buy with my last crown-piece\n(after all demands were paid) a little shot and powder, more needful on\nthe road almost than even shoes or victuals, at the corner of the street\nI met my good friend Jeremy Stickles, newly come in search of me. I took\nhim back to my little room--mine at least till to-morrow morning--and\ntold him all my story, and how much I felt aggrieved by it. But he\nsurprised me very much, by showing no surprise at all.\n\n\"It is the way of the world, Jack. They have gotten all they can from\nthee, and why should they feed thee further? We feed not a dead pig, I\ntrow, but baste him well with brine and rue. Nay, we do not victual him\nupon the day of killing; which they have done to thee. Thou art a lucky\nman, John; thou hast gotten one day's wages, or at any rate half a day,\nafter thy work was rendered. God have mercy on me, John! The things I\nsee are manifold; and so is my regard of them. What use to insist on\nthis, or make a special point of that, or hold by something said of old,\nwhen a different mood was on? I tell thee, Jack, all men are liars; and\nhe is the least one who presses not too hard on them for lying.\"\n\nThis was all quite dark to me, for I never looked at things like that,\nand never would own myself a liar, not at least to other people, nor\neven to myself, although I might to God sometimes, when trouble was upon\nme. And if it comes to that, no man has any right to be called a \"liar\"\nfor smoothing over things unwitting, through duty to his neighbour.\n\n\"Five pounds thou shalt have, Jack,\" said Jeremy Stickles suddenly,\nwhile I was all abroad with myself as to being a liar or not; \"five\npounds, and I will take my chance of wringing it from that great rogue\nSpank. Ten I would have made it, John, but for bad luck lately. Put back\nyour bits of paper, lad; I will have no acknowledgment. John Ridd, no\nnonsense with me!\"\n\nFor I was ready to kiss his hand, to think that any man in London (the\nmeanest and most suspicious place, upon all God's earth) should trust me\nwith five pounds, without even a receipt for it! It overcame me so that\nI sobbed; for, after all, though big in body, I am but a child at heart.\nIt was not the five pounds that moved me, but the way of giving it; and\nafter so much bitter talk, the great trust in my goodness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nHOME AGAIN AT LAST\n\n[Illustration: 221.jpg Exmoor Hills]\n\nIt was the beginning of wheat-harvest, when I came to Dunster town,\nhaving walked all the way from London, and being somewhat footsore. For\nthough five pounds was enough to keep me in food and lodging upon the\nroad, and leave me many a shilling to give to far poorer travellers, it\nwould have been nothing for horse-hire, as I knew too well by the prices\nJeremy Stickles had paid upon our way to London. Now I never saw a\nprettier town than Dunster looked that evening; for sooth to say, I had\nalmost lost all hope of reaching it that night, although the castle was\nlong in view. But being once there, my troubles were gone, at least as\nregarded wayfaring; for mother's cousin, the worthy tanner (with whom we\nhad slept on the way to London), was in such indignation at the plight\nin which I came back to him, afoot, and weary, and almost shoeless--not\nto speak of upper things--that he swore then, by the mercy of God, that\nif the schemes abrewing round him, against those bloody Papists, should\ncome to any head or shape, and show good chance of succeeding, he would\nrisk a thousand pounds, as though it were a penny.\n\n[Illustration: 222.jpg The Luttrell Arms]\n\nI told him not to do it, because I had heard otherwise, but was not at\nliberty to tell one-tenth of what I knew, and indeed had seen in London\ntown. But of this he took no heed, because I only nodded at him; and\nhe could not make it out. For it takes an old man, or at least a\nmiddle-aged one, to nod and wink, with any power on the brains of other\nmen. However, I think I made him know that the bad state in which I came\nto his town, and the great shame I had wrought for him among the folk\nround the card-table at the Luttrell Arms, was not to be, even there,\nattributed to King Charles the Second, nor even to his counsellors, but\nto my own speed of travelling, which had beat post-horses. For being\nmuch distraught in mind, and desperate in body, I had made all the way\nfrom London to Dunster in six days, and no more. It may be one hundred\nand seventy miles, I cannot tell to a furlong or two, especially as I\nlost my way more than a dozen times; but at any rate there in six days\nI was, and most kindly they received me. The tanner had some excellent\ndaughters, I forget how many; very pretty damsels, and well set up, and\nable to make good pastry. But though they asked me many questions, and\nmade a sort of lord of me, and offered to darn my stockings (which in\ntruth required it), I fell asleep in the midst of them, although I would\nnot acknowledge it; and they said, \"Poor cousin! he is weary\", and led\nme to a blessed bed, and kissed me all round like swan's down.\n\nIn the morning all the Exmoor hills, the thought of which had frightened\nme at the end of each day's travel, seemed no more than bushels to me,\nas I looked forth the bedroom window, and thanked God for the sight of\nthem. And even so, I had not to climb them, at least by my own labour.\nFor my most worthy uncle (as we oft call a parent's cousin), finding it\nimpossible to keep me for the day, and owning indeed that I was right\nin hastening to my mother, vowed that walk I should not, even though he\nlost his Saturday hides from Minehead and from Watchett. Accordingly he\nsent me forth on the very strongest nag he had, and the maidens came\nto wish me God-speed, and kissed their hands at the doorway. It made\nme proud and glad to think that after seeing so much of the world, and\nhaving held my own with it, I was come once more among my own people,\nand found them kinder, and more warm-hearted, ay and better looking too,\nthan almost any I had happened upon in the mighty city of London.\n\nBut how shall I tell you the things I felt, and the swelling of my heart\nwithin me, as I drew nearer, and more near, to the place of all I loved\nand owned, to the haunt of every warm remembrance, the nest of all the\nfledgling hopes--in a word, to home? The first sheep I beheld on the\nmoor with a great red J.R. on his side (for mother would have them\nmarked with my name, instead of her own as they should have been), I do\nassure you my spirit leaped, and all my sight came to my eyes. I shouted\nout, \"Jem, boy!\"--for that was his name, and a rare hand he was at\nfighting--and he knew me in spite of the stranger horse; and I leaned\nover and stroked his head, and swore he should never be mutton. And when\nI was passed he set off at full gallop, to call the rest of the J.R.'s\ntogether, and tell them young master was come home at last.\n\n[Illustration: 223.jpg Home at last]\n\nBut bless your heart, and my own as well, it would take me all the\nafternoon to lay before you one-tenth of the things which came home to\nme in that one half-hour, as the sun was sinking, in the real way he\nought to sink. I touched my horse with no spur nor whip, feeling that my\nslow wits would go, if the sights came too fast over them. Here was\nthe pool where we washed the sheep, and there was the hollow that oozed\naway, where I had shot three wild ducks. Here was the peat-rick that hid\nmy dinner, when I could not go home for it, and there was the bush with\nthe thyme growing round it, where Annie had found a great swarm of our\nbees. And now was the corner of the dry stone wall, where the moor gave\nover in earnest, and the partridges whisked from it into the corn lands,\nand called that their supper was ready, and looked at our house and the\nricks as they ran, and would wait for that comfort till winter.\n\nAnd there I saw--but let me go--Annie was too much for me. She nearly\npulled me off my horse, and kissed the very mouth of the carbine.\n\n\"I knew you would come. Oh John! Oh John! I have waited here every\nSaturday night; and I saw you for the last mile or more, but I would not\ncome round the corner, for fear that I should cry, John, and then not\ncry when I got you. Now I may cry as much as I like, and you need\nnot try to stop me, John, because I am so happy. But you mustn't cry\nyourself, John; what will mother think of you? She will be so jealous of\nme.\"\n\nWhat mother thought I cannot tell; and indeed I doubt if she thought at\nall for more than half an hour, but only managed to hold me tight, and\ncry, and thank God now and then, but with some fear of His taking me,\nif she should be too grateful. Moreover she thought it was my own\ndoing, and I ought to have the credit of it, and she even came down very\nsharply upon John's wife, Mrs. Fry, for saying that we must not be too\nproud, for all of it was the Lord's doing. However, dear mother was\nashamed of that afterwards, and asked Mrs. Fry's humble pardon; and\nperhaps I ought not to have mentioned it.\n\nOld Smiler had told them that I was coming--all the rest, I mean, except\nAnnie--for having escaped from his halter-ring, he was come out to graze\nin the lane a bit; when what should he see but a strange horse coming\nwith young master and mistress upon him, for Annie must needs get up\nbehind me, there being only sheep to look at her. Then Smiler gave us\na stare and a neigh, with his tail quite stiff with amazement, and then\n(whether in joy or through indignation) he flung up his hind feet and\ngalloped straight home, and set every dog wild with barking.\n\nNow, methinks, quite enough has been said concerning this mighty return\nof the young John Ridd (which was known up at Cosgate that evening), and\nfeeling that I cannot describe it, how can I hope that any one else will\nlabour to imagine it, even of the few who are able? For very few can\nhave travelled so far, unless indeed they whose trade it is, or very\nunsettled people. And even of those who have done so, not one in a\nhundred can have such a home as I had to come home to.\n\nMother wept again, with grief and some wrath, and so did Annie also, and\neven little Eliza, and all were unsettled in loyalty, and talked about\na republic, when I told them how I had been left without money for\ntravelling homeward, and expected to have to beg my way, which Farmer\nSnowe would have heard of. And though I could see they were disappointed\nat my failure of any promotion, they all declared how glad they were,\nand how much better they liked me to be no more than what they were\naccustomed to. At least, my mother and Annie said so, without waiting\nto hear any more; but Lizzie did not answer to it, until I had opened my\nbag and shown the beautiful present I had for her. And then she kissed\nme, almost like Annie, and vowed that she thought very little of\ncaptains.\n\nFor Lizzie's present was the best of all, I mean, of course, except\nLorna's (which I carried in my breast all the way, hoping that it might\nmake her love me, from having lain so long, close to my heart). For I\nhad brought Lizzie something dear, and a precious heavy book it was,\nand much beyond my understanding; whereas I knew well that to both the\nothers my gifts would be dear, for mine own sake. And happier people\ncould not be found than the whole of us were that evening.\n\n[Illustration: 225.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nJOHN HAS HOPE OF LORNA\n\n[Illustration: 226.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nMuch as I longed to know more about Lorna, and though all my heart was\nyearning, I could not reconcile it yet with my duty to mother and Annie,\nto leave them on the following day, which happened to be a Sunday. For\nlo, before breakfast was out of our mouths, there came all the men of\nthe farm, and their wives, and even the two crow-boys, dressed as if\ngoing to Barnstaple fair, to inquire how Master John was, and whether\nit was true that the King had made him one of his body-guard; and if\nso, what was to be done with the belt for the championship of the\nWest-Counties wrestling, which I had held now for a year or more, and\nnone were ready to challenge it. Strange to say, this last point seemed\nthe most important of all to them; and none asked who was to manage the\nfarm, or answer for their wages; but all asked who was to wear the belt.\n\nTo this I replied, after shaking hands twice over all round with all\nof them, that I meant to wear the belt myself, for the honour of\nOare parish, so long as ever God gave me strength and health to meet\nall-comers; for I had never been asked to be body-guard, and if asked\nI would never have done it. Some of them cried that the King must be\nmazed, not to keep me for his protection, in these violent times of\nPopery. I could have told them that the King was not in the least afraid\nof Papists, but on the contrary, very fond of them; however, I held my\ntongue, remembering what Judge Jeffreys bade me.\n\nIn church, the whole congregation, man, woman, and child (except,\nindeed, the Snowe girls, who only looked when I was not watching),\nturned on me with one accord, and stared so steadfastly, to get some\nreflection of the King from me, that they forgot the time to kneel down\nand the parson was forced to speak to them. If I coughed, or moved\nmy book, or bowed, or even said \"Amen,\" glances were exchanged which\nmeant--\"That he hath learned in London town, and most likely from His\nMajesty.\"\n\nHowever, all this went off in time, and people became even angry with\nme for not being sharper (as they said), or smarter, or a whit more\nfashionable, for all the great company I had seen, and all the wondrous\nthings wasted upon me.\n\nBut though I may have been none the wiser by reason of my stay in\nLondon, at any rate I was much the better in virtue of coming home\nagain. For now I had learned the joy of quiet, and the gratitude for\ngood things round us, and the love we owe to others (even those who must\nbe kind), for their indulgence to us. All this, before my journey, had\nbeen too much as a matter of course to me; but having missed it now I\nknew that it was a gift, and might be lost. Moreover, I had pined so\nmuch, in the dust and heat of that great town, for trees, and fields,\nand running waters, and the sounds of country life, and the air\nof country winds, that never more could I grow weary of those soft\nenjoyments; or at least I thought so then.\n\nTo awake as the summer sun came slanting over the hill-tops, with hope\non every beam adance to the laughter of the morning; to see the leaves\nacross the window ruffling on the fresh new air, and the tendrils of the\npowdery vine turning from their beaded sleep. Then the lustrous meadows\nfar beyond the thatch of the garden-wall, yet seen beneath the hanging\nscollops of the walnut-tree, all awaking, dressed in pearl, all amazed\nat their own glistening, like a maid at her own ideas. Down them troop\nthe lowing kine, walking each with a step of character (even as men and\nwomen do), yet all alike with toss of horns, and spread of udders ready.\nFrom them without a word, we turn to the farm-yard proper, seen on the\nright, and dryly strawed from the petty rush of the pitch-paved runnel.\nRound it stand the snug out-buildings, barn, corn-chamber, cider-press,\nstables, with a blinker'd horse in every doorway munching, while his\ndriver tightens buckles, whistles and looks down the lane, dallying\nto begin his labour till the milkmaids be gone by. Here the cock\ncomes forth at last;--where has he been lingering?--eggs may tell\nto-morrow--he claps his wings and shouts \"cock-a-doodle\"; and no other\ncock dare look at him. Two or three go sidling off, waiting till their\nspurs be grown; and then the crowd of partlets comes, chattering how\ntheir lord has dreamed, and crowed at two in the morning, and praying\nthat the old brown rat would only dare to face him. But while the cock\nis crowing still, and the pullet world admiring him, who comes up but\nthe old turkey-cock, with all his family round him. Then the geese\nat the lower end begin to thrust their breasts out, and mum their\ndown-bits, and look at the gander and scream shrill joy for the\nconflict; while the ducks in pond show nothing but tail, in proof of\ntheir strict neutrality.\n\nWhile yet we dread for the coming event, and the fight which would jar\non the morning, behold the grandmother of sows, gruffly grunting right\nand left with muzzle which no ring may tame (not being matrimonial),\nhulks across between the two, moving all each side at once, and then all\nof the other side as if she were chined down the middle, and afraid\nof spilling the salt from her. As this mighty view of lard hides each\ncombatant from the other, gladly each retires and boasts how he would\nhave slain his neighbour, but that old sow drove the other away, and no\nwonder he was afraid of her, after all the chicks she had eaten.\n\nAnd so it goes on; and so the sun comes, stronger from his drink of dew;\nand the cattle in the byres, and the horses from the stable, and the men\nfrom cottage-door, each has had his rest and food, all smell alike of\nhay and straw, and every one must hie to work, be it drag, or draw, or\ndelve.\n\nSo thought I on the Monday morning; while my own work lay before me,\nand I was plotting how to quit it, void of harm to every one, and let my\nlove have work a little--hardest perhaps of all work, and yet as sure as\nsunrise. I knew that my first day's task on the farm would be strictly\nwatched by every one, even by my gentle mother, to see what I had\nlearned in London. But could I let still another day pass, for Lorna to\nthink me faithless?\n\nI felt much inclined to tell dear mother all about Lorna, and how I\nloved her, yet had no hope of winning her. Often and often, I had\nlonged to do this, and have done with it. But the thought of my father's\nterrible death, at the hands of the Doones, prevented me. And it seemed\nto me foolish and mean to grieve mother, without any chance of my suit\never speeding. If once Lorna loved me, my mother should know it; and it\nwould be the greatest happiness to me to have no concealment from her,\nthough at first she was sure to grieve terribly. But I saw no more\nchance of Lorna loving me, than of the man in the moon coming down; or\nrather of the moon coming down to the man, as related in old mythology.\n\nNow the merriment of the small birds, and the clear voice of the waters,\nand the lowing of cattle in meadows, and the view of no houses (except\njust our own and a neighbour's), and the knowledge of everybody around,\ntheir kindness of heart and simplicity, and love of their neighbour's\ndoings,--all these could not help or please me at all, and many of them\nwere much against me, in my secret depth of longing and dark tumult of\nthe mind. Many people may think me foolish, especially after coming from\nLondon, where many nice maids looked at me (on account of my bulk and\nstature), and I might have been fitted up with a sweetheart, in spite of\nmy west-country twang, and the smallness of my purse; if only I had\nsaid the word. But nay; I have contempt for a man whose heart is like\na shirt-stud (such as I saw in London cards), fitted into one to-day,\nsitting bravely on the breast; plucked out on the morrow morn, and the\nplace that knew it, gone.\n\nNow, what did I do but take my chance; reckless whether any one heeded\nme or not, only craving Lorna's heed, and time for ten words to her.\nTherefore I left the men of the farm as far away as might be, after\nmaking them work with me (which no man round our parts could do, to his\nown satisfaction), and then knowing them to be well weary, very unlike\nto follow me--and still more unlike to tell of me, for each had his\nLondon present--I strode right away, in good trust of my speed, without\nany more misgivings; but resolved to face the worst of it, and to try to\nbe home for supper.\n\nAnd first I went, I know not why, to the crest of the broken highland,\nwhence I had agreed to watch for any mark or signal. And sure enough at\nlast I saw (when it was too late to see) that the white stone had been\ncovered over with a cloth or mantle,--the sign that something had arisen\nto make Lorna want me. For a moment I stood amazed at my evil fortune;\nthat I should be too late, in the very thing of all things on which my\nheart was set! Then after eyeing sorrowfully every crick and cranny to\nbe sure that not a single flutter of my love was visible, off I set,\nwith small respect either for my knees or neck, to make the round of the\nouter cliffs, and come up my old access.\n\nNothing could stop me; it was not long, although to me it seemed an\nage, before I stood in the niche of rock at the head of the slippery\nwatercourse, and gazed into the quiet glen, where my foolish heart was\ndwelling. Notwithstanding doubts of right, notwithstanding sense of\nduty, and despite all manly striving, and the great love of my home,\nthere my heart was ever dwelling, knowing what a fool it was, and\ncontent to know it.\n\nMany birds came twittering round me in the gold of August; many trees\nshowed twinkling beauty, as the sun went lower; and the lines of water\nfell, from wrinkles into dimples. Little heeding, there I crouched;\nthough with sense of everything that afterwards should move me, like a\npicture or a dream; and everything went by me softly, while my heart was\ngazing.\n\nAt last, a little figure came, not insignificant (I mean), but looking\nvery light and slender in the moving shadows, gently here and softly\nthere, as if vague of purpose, with a gloss of tender movement, in and\nout the wealth of trees, and liberty of the meadow. Who was I to crouch,\nor doubt, or look at her from a distance; what matter if they killed me\nnow, and one tear came to bury me? Therefore I rushed out at once, as if\nshot-guns were unknown yet; not from any real courage, but from prisoned\nlove burst forth.\n\nI know not whether my own Lorna was afraid of what I looked, or what I\nmight say to her, or of her own thoughts of me; all I know is that she\nlooked frightened, when I hoped for gladness. Perhaps the power of my\njoy was more than maiden liked to own, or in any way to answer to; and\nto tell the truth, it seemed as if I might now forget myself; while she\nwould take good care of it. This makes a man grow thoughtful; unless, as\nsome low fellows do, he believe all women hypocrites.\n\nTherefore I went slowly towards her, taken back in my impulse; and said\nall I could come to say, with some distress in doing it.\n\n\"Mistress Lorna, I had hope that you were in need of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but that was long ago; two months ago, or more, sir.\" And\nsaying this she looked away, as if it all were over. But I was now\nso dazed and frightened, that it took my breath away, and I could not\nanswer, feeling sure that I was robbed and some one else had won her.\nAnd I tried to turn away, without another word, and go.\n\nBut I could not help one stupid sob, though mad with myself for allowing\nit, but it came too sharp for pride to stay it, and it told a world\nof things. Lorna heard it, and ran to me, with her bright eyes full of\nwonder, pity, and great kindness, as if amazed that I had more than a\nsimple liking for her. Then she held out both hands to me; and I took\nand looked at them.\n\n\"Master Ridd, I did not mean,\" she whispered, very softly, \"I did not\nmean to vex you.\"\n\n\"If you would be loath to vex me, none else in this world can do it,\" I\nanswered out of my great love, but fearing yet to look at her, mine eyes\nnot being strong enough.\n\n\"Come away from this bright place,\" she answered, trembling in her turn;\n\"I am watched and spied of late. Come beneath the shadows, John.\"\n\nI would have leaped into the valley of the shadow of death (as described\nby the late John Bunyan), only to hear her call me \"John\"; though\nApollyon were lurking there, and Despair should lock me in.\n\nShe stole across the silent grass; but I strode hotly after her; fear\nwas all beyond me now, except the fear of losing her. I could not but\nbehold her manner, as she went before me, all her grace, and lovely\nsweetness, and her sense of what she was.\n\nShe led me to her own rich bower, which I told of once before; and if\nin spring it were a sight, what was it in summer glory? But although my\nmind had notice of its fairness and its wonder, not a heed my heart took\nof it, neither dwelt it in my presence more than flowing water. All\nthat in my presence dwelt, all that in my heart was felt, was the maiden\nmoving gently, and afraid to look at me.\n\nFor now the power of my love was abiding on her, new to her, unknown to\nher; not a thing to speak about, nor even to think clearly; only just to\nfeel and wonder, with a pain of sweetness. She could look at me no more,\nneither could she look away, with a studied manner--only to let fall her\neyes, and blush, and be put out with me, and still more with herself.\n\nI left her quite alone; though close, though tingling to have hold of\nher. Even her right hand was dropped and lay among the mosses. Neither\ndid I try to steal one glimpse below her eyelids. Life and death to me\nwere hanging on the first glance I should win; yet I let it be so.\n\nAfter long or short--I know not, yet ere I was weary, ere I yet began\nto think or wish for any answer--Lorna slowly raised her eyelids, with\na gleam of dew below them, and looked at me doubtfully. Any look with so\nmuch in it never met my gaze before.\n\n\"Darling, do you love me?\" was all that I could say to her.\n\n\"Yes, I like you very much,\" she answered, with her eyes gone from me,\nand her dark hair falling over, so as not to show me things.\n\n\"But do you love me, Lorna, Lorna; do you love me more than all the\nworld?\"\n\n\"No, to be sure not. Now why should I?\"\n\n\"In truth, I know not why you should. Only I hoped that you did, Lorna.\nEither love me not at all, or as I love you for ever.\"\n\n\"John I love you very much; and I would not grieve you. You are the\nbravest, and the kindest, and the simplest of all men--I mean of all\npeople--I like you very much, Master Ridd, and I think of you almost\nevery day.\"\n\n\"That will not do for me, Lorna. Not almost every day I think, but every\ninstant of my life, of you. For you I would give up my home, my love of\nall the world beside, my duty to my dearest ones, for you I would give\nup my life, and hope of life beyond it. Do you love me so?\"\n\n\"Not by any means,\" said Lorna; \"no, I like you very much, when you do\nnot talk so wildly; and I like to see you come as if you would fill our\nvalley up, and I like to think that even Carver would be nothing in\nyour hands--but as to liking you like that, what should make it likely?\nespecially when I have made the signal, and for some two months or more\nyou have never even answered it! If you like me so ferociously, why do\nyou leave me for other people to do just as they like with me?\"\n\n\"To do as they liked! Oh, Lorna, not to make you marry Carver?\"\n\n\"No, Master Ridd, be not frightened so; it makes me fear to look at\nyou.\"\n\n\"But you have not married Carver yet? Say quick! Why keep me waiting\nso?\"\n\n\"Of course I have not, Master Ridd. Should I be here if I had, think\nyou, and allowing you to like me so, and to hold my hand, and make me\nlaugh, as I declare you almost do sometimes? And at other times you\nfrighten me.\"\n\n\"Did they want you to marry Carver? Tell me all the truth of it.\"\n\n\"Not yet, not yet. They are not half so impetuous as you are, John. I am\nonly just seventeen, you know, and who is to think of marrying? But\nthey wanted me to give my word, and be formally betrothed to him in the\npresence of my grandfather. It seems that something frightened them.\nThere is a youth named Charleworth Doone, every one calls him 'Charlie';\na headstrong and a gay young man, very gallant in his looks and manner;\nand my uncle, the Counsellor, chose to fancy that Charlie looked at me\ntoo much, coming by my grandfather's cottage.\"\n\nHere Lorna blushed so that I was frightened, and began to hate this\nCharlie more, a great deal more, than even Carver Doone.\n\n\"He had better not,\" said I; \"I will fling him over it, if he dare. He\nshall see thee through the roof, Lorna, if at all he see thee.\"\n\n\"Master Ridd, you are worse than Carver! I thought you were so\nkind-hearted. Well, they wanted me to promise, and even to swear a\nsolemn oath (a thing I have never done in my life) that I would wed\nmy eldest cousin, this same Carver Doone, who is twice as old as I am,\nbeing thirty-five and upwards. That was why I gave the token that I\nwished to see you, Master Ridd. They pointed out how much it was for\nthe peace of all the family, and for mine own benefit; but I would not\nlisten for a moment, though the Counsellor was most eloquent, and my\ngrandfather begged me to consider, and Carver smiled his pleasantest,\nwhich is a truly frightful thing. Then both he and his crafty father\nwere for using force with me; but Sir Ensor would not hear of it; and\nthey have put off that extreme until he shall be past its knowledge,\nor, at least, beyond preventing it. And now I am watched, and spied, and\nfollowed, and half my little liberty seems to be taken from me. I could\nnot be here speaking with you, even in my own nook and refuge, but for\nthe aid, and skill, and courage of dear little Gwenny Carfax. She is\nnow my chief reliance, and through her alone I hope to baffle all my\nenemies, since others have forsaken me.\"\n\nTears of sorrow and reproach were lurking in her soft dark eyes, until\nin fewest words I told her that my seeming negligence was nothing but\nmy bitter loss and wretched absence far away; of which I had so vainly\nstriven to give any tidings without danger to her. When she heard all\nthis, and saw what I had brought from London (which was nothing less\nthan a ring of pearls with a sapphire in the midst of them, as pretty as\ncould well be found), she let the gentle tears flow fast, and came\nand sat so close beside me, that I trembled like a folded sheep at the\nbleating of her lamb. But recovering comfort quickly, without more ado,\nI raised her left hand and observed it with a nice regard, wondering at\nthe small blue veins, and curves, and tapering whiteness, and the points\nit finished with. My wonder seemed to please her much, herself so well\naccustomed to it, and not fond of watching it. And then, before she\ncould say a word, or guess what I was up to, as quick as ever I turned\nhand in a bout of wrestling, on her finger was my ring--sapphire for the\nveins of blue, and pearls to match white fingers.\n\n\"Oh, you crafty Master Ridd!\" said Lorna, looking up at me, and blushing\nnow a far brighter blush than when she spoke of Charlie; \"I thought that\nyou were much too simple ever to do this sort of thing. No wonder you\ncan catch the fish, as when first I saw you.\"\n\n\"Have I caught you, little fish? Or must all my life be spent in\nhopeless angling for you?\"\n\n\"Neither one nor the other, John! You have not caught me yet altogether,\nthough I like you dearly John; and if you will only keep away, I shall\nlike you more and more. As for hopeless angling, John--that all others\nshall have until I tell you otherwise.\"\n\nWith the large tears in her eyes--tears which seemed to me to rise\npartly from her want to love me with the power of my love--she put her\npure bright lips, half smiling, half prone to reply to tears, against my\nforehead lined with trouble, doubt, and eager longing. And then she drew\nmy ring from off that snowy twig her finger, and held it out to me; and\nthen, seeing how my face was falling, thrice she touched it with her\nlips, and sweetly gave it back to me. \"John, I dare not take it now;\nelse I should be cheating you. I will try to love you dearly, even as\nyou deserve and wish. Keep it for me just till then. Something tells me\nI shall earn it in a very little time. Perhaps you will be sorry then,\nsorry when it is all too late, to be loved by such as I am.\"\n\nWhat could I do at her mournful tone, but kiss a thousand times the hand\nwhich she put up to warn me, and vow that I would rather die with one\nassurance of her love, than without it live for ever with all beside\nthat the world could give? Upon this she looked so lovely, with her dark\neyelashes trembling, and her soft eyes full of light, and the colour of\nclear sunrise mounting on her cheeks and brow, that I was forced to turn\naway, being overcome with beauty.\n\n\"Dearest darling, love of my life,\" I whispered through her clouds of\nhair; \"how long must I wait to know, how long must I linger doubting\nwhether you can ever stoop from your birth and wondrous beauty to a\npoor, coarse hind like me, an ignorant unlettered yeoman--\"\n\n\"I will not have you revile yourself,\" said Lorna, very tenderly--just\nas I had meant to make her. \"You are not rude and unlettered, John. You\nknow a great deal more than I do; you have learned both Greek and Latin,\nas you told me long ago, and you have been at the very best school in\nthe West of England. None of us but my grandfather, and the Counsellor\n(who is a great scholar), can compare with you in this. And though I\nhave laughed at your manner of speech, I only laughed in fun, John; I\nnever meant to vex you by it, nor knew that it had done so.\"\n\n\"Naught you say can vex me, dear,\" I answered, as she leaned towards\nme in her generous sorrow; \"unless you say 'Begone, John Ridd; I love\nanother more than you.'\"\n\n\"Then I shall never vex you, John. Never, I mean, by saying that. Now,\nJohn, if you please, be quiet--\"\n\nFor I was carried away so much by hearing her calling me \"John\" so\noften, and the music of her voice, and the way she bent toward me, and\nthe shadow of soft weeping in the sunlight of her eyes, that some of\nmy great hand was creeping in a manner not to be imagined, and far\nless explained, toward the lithesome, wholesome curving underneath her\nmantle-fold, and out of sight and harm, as I thought; not being her\nfront waist. However, I was dashed with that, and pretended not to mean\nit; only to pluck some lady-fern, whose elegance did me no good.\n\n\"Now, John,\" said Lorna, being so quick that not even a lover could\ncheat her, and observing my confusion more intently than she need have\ndone. \"Master John Ridd, it is high time for you to go home to your\nmother. I love your mother very much from what you have told me about\nher, and I will not have her cheated.\"\n\n\"If you truly love my mother,\" said I, very craftily \"the only way to\nshow it is by truly loving me.\"\n\nUpon that she laughed at me in the sweetest manner, and with such\nprovoking ways, and such come-and-go of glances, and beginning of quick\nblushes, which she tried to laugh away, that I knew, as well as if she\nherself had told me, by some knowledge (void of reasoning, and the surer\nfor it), I knew quite well, while all my heart was burning hot within\nme, and mine eyes were shy of hers, and her eyes were shy of mine; for\ncertain and for ever this I knew--as in a glory--that Lorna Doone had\nnow begun and would go on to love me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nREAPING LEADS TO REVELLING\n\n[Illustration: 236.jpg The Signal]\n\nAlthough I was under interdict for two months from my darling--\"one for\nyour sake, one for mine,\" she had whispered, with her head withdrawn,\nyet not so very far from me--lighter heart was not on Exmoor than I bore\nfor half the time, and even for three quarters. For she was safe; I knew\nthat daily by a mode of signals well-contrived between us now, on the\nstrength of our experience. \"I have nothing now to fear, John,\" she had\nsaid to me, as we parted; \"it is true that I am spied and watched, but\nGwenny is too keen for them. While I have my grandfather to prevent all\nviolence; and little Gwenny to keep watch on those who try to watch me;\nand you, above all others, John, ready at a moment, if the worst comes\nto the worst--this neglected Lorna Doone was never in such case before.\nTherefore do not squeeze my hand, John; I am safe without it, and you do\nnot know your strength.\"\n\nAh, I knew my strength right well. Hill and valley scarcely seemed to be\nstep and landing for me; fiercest cattle I would play with, making them\ngo backward, and afraid of hurting them, like John Fry with his terrier;\neven rooted trees seemed to me but as sticks I could smite down, except\nfor my love of everything. The love of all things was upon me, and a\nsoftness to them all, and a sense of having something even such as they\nhad.\n\n[Illustration: 237.jpg A wealth of harvest]\n\nThen the golden harvest came, waving on the broad hill-side, and\nnestling in the quiet nooks scooped from out the fringe of wood. A\nwealth of harvest such as never gladdened all our country-side since my\nfather ceased to reap, and his sickle hung to rust. There had not been\na man on Exmoor fit to work that reaping-hook since the time its owner\nfell, in the prime of life and strength, before a sterner reaper. But\nnow I took it from the wall, where mother proudly stored it, while she\nwatched me, hardly knowing whether she should smile or cry.\n\nAll the parish was assembled in our upper courtyard; for we were to open\nthe harvest that year, as had been settled with Farmer Nicholas, and\nwith Jasper Kebby, who held the third or little farm. We started in\nproper order, therefore, as our practice is: first, the parson Josiah\nBowden, wearing his gown and cassock, with the parish Bible in his hand,\nand a sickle strapped behind him. As he strode along well and stoutly,\nbeing a man of substance, all our family came next, I leading mother\nwith one hand, in the other bearing my father's hook, and with a loaf\nof our own bread and a keg of cider upon my back. Behind us Annie and\nLizzie walked, wearing wreaths of corn-flowers, set out very prettily,\nsuch as mother would have worn if she had been a farmer's wife, instead\nof a farmer's widow. Being as she was, she had no adornment, except that\nher widow's hood was off, and her hair allowed to flow, as if she had\nbeen a maiden; and very rich bright hair it was, in spite of all her\ntroubles.\n\nAfter us, the maidens came, milkmaids and the rest of them, with Betty\nMuxworthy at their head, scolding even now, because they would not walk\nfitly. But they only laughed at her; and she knew it was no good to\nscold, with all the men behind them.\n\nThen the Snowes came trooping forward; Farmer Nicholas in the middle,\nwalking as if he would rather walk to a wheatfield of his own, yet\ncontent to follow lead, because he knew himself the leader; and signing\nevery now and then to the people here and there, as if I were nobody.\nBut to see his three great daughters, strong and handsome wenches,\nmaking upon either side, as if somebody would run off with them--this\nwas the very thing that taught me how to value Lorna, and her pure\nsimplicity.\n\nAfter the Snowes came Jasper Kebby, with his wife, new-married; and a\nvery honest pair they were, upon only a hundred acres, and a right of\ncommon. After these the men came hotly, without decent order, trying to\nspy the girls in front, and make good jokes about them, at which their\nwives laughed heartily, being jealous when alone perhaps. And after\nthese men and their wives came all the children toddling, picking\nflowers by the way, and chattering and asking questions, as the children\nwill. There must have been threescore of us, take one with another, and\nthe lane was full of people. When we were come to the big field-gate,\nwhere the first sickle was to be, Parson Bowden heaved up the rail with\nthe sleeves of his gown done green with it; and he said that everybody\nmight hear him, though his breath was short, \"In the name of the Lord,\nAmen!\"\n\n\"Amen! So be it!\" cried the clerk, who was far behind, being only a\nshoemaker.\n\nThen Parson Bowden read some verses from the parish Bible, telling us to\nlift up our eyes, and look upon the fields already white to harvest;\nand then he laid the Bible down on the square head of the gate-post,\nand despite his gown and cassock, three good swipes he cut off corn,\nand laid them right end onwards. All this time the rest were huddling\noutside the gate, and along the lane, not daring to interfere with\nparson, but whispering how well he did it.\n\nWhen he had stowed the corn like that, mother entered, leaning on me,\nand we both said, \"Thank the Lord for all His mercies, and these the\nfirst-fruits of His hand!\" And then the clerk gave out a psalm verse by\nverse, done very well; although he sneezed in the midst of it, from a\nbeard of wheat thrust up his nose by the rival cobbler at Brendon. And\nwhen the psalm was sung, so strongly that the foxgloves on the bank were\nshaking, like a chime of bells, at it, Parson took a stoop of cider, and\nwe all fell to at reaping.\n\nOf course I mean the men, not women; although I know that up the\ncountry, women are allowed to reap; and right well they reap it, keeping\nrow for row with men, comely, and in due order, yet, meseems, the men\nmust ill attend to their own reaping-hooks, in fear lest the other cut\nthemselves, being the weaker vessel. But in our part, women do what\nseems their proper business, following well behind the men, out of harm\nof the swinging hook, and stooping with their breasts and arms up they\ncatch the swathes of corn, where the reapers cast them, and tucking them\ntogether tightly with a wisp laid under them, this they fetch around and\ntwist, with a knee to keep it close; and lo, there is a goodly sheaf,\nready to set up in stooks! After these the children come, gathering each\nfor his little self, if the farmer be right-minded; until each hath a\nbundle made as big as himself and longer, and tumbles now and again with\nit, in the deeper part of the stubble.\n\nWe, the men, kept marching onwards down the flank of the yellow wall,\nwith knees bent wide, and left arm bowed and right arm flashing steel.\nEach man in his several place, keeping down the rig or chine, on the\nright side of the reaper in front, and the left of the man that followed\nhim, each making farther sweep and inroad into the golden breadth and\ndepth, each casting leftwards his rich clearance on his foregoer's\ndouble track.\n\nSo like half a wedge of wildfowl, to and fro we swept the field; and\nwhen to either hedge we came, sickles wanted whetting, and throats\nrequired moistening, and backs were in need of easing, and every man had\nmuch to say, and women wanted praising. Then all returned to the other\nend, with reaping-hooks beneath our arms, and dogs left to mind jackets.\n\nBut now, will you believe me well, or will you only laugh at me? For\neven in the world of wheat, when deep among the varnished crispness of\nthe jointed stalks, and below the feathered yielding of the graceful\nheads, even as I gripped the swathes and swept the sickle round them,\neven as I flung them by to rest on brother stubble, through the whirling\nyellow world, and eagerness of reaping, came the vision of my love, as\nwith downcast eyes she wondered at my power of passion. And then the\nsweet remembrance glowed brighter than the sun through wheat, through my\nvery depth of heart, of how she raised those beaming eyes, and ripened\nin my breast rich hope. Even now I could descry, like high waves in the\ndistance, the rounded heads and folded shadows of the wood of Bagworthy.\nPerhaps she was walking in the valley, and softly gazing up at them. Oh,\nto be a bird just there! I could see a bright mist hanging just above\nthe Doone Glen. Perhaps it was shedding its drizzle upon her. Oh, to\nbe a drop of rain! The very breeze which bowed the harvest to my bosom\ngently, might have come direct from Lorna, with her sweet voice laden.\nAh, the flaws of air that wander where they will around her, fan her\nbright cheek, play with lashes, even revel in her hair and reveal her\nbeauties--man is but a breath, we know, would I were such breath as\nthat!\n\nBut confound it, while I ponder, with delicious dreams suspended, with\nmy right arm hanging frustrate and the giant sickle drooped, with my\nleft arm bowed for clasping something more germane than wheat, and my\neyes not minding business, but intent on distant woods--confound it,\nwhat are the men about, and why am I left vapouring? They have taken\nadvantage of me, the rogues! They are gone to the hedge for the\ncider-jars; they have had up the sledd of bread and meat, quite softly\nover the stubble, and if I can believe my eyes (so dazed with Lorna's\nimage), they are sitting down to an excellent dinner, before the church\nclock has gone eleven!\n\n\"John Fry, you big villain!\" I cried, with John hanging up in the air by\nthe scruff of his neck-cloth, but holding still by his knife and fork,\nand a goose-leg in between his lips, \"John Fry, what mean you by this,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Latt me dowun, or I can't tell 'e,\" John answered with some difficulty.\nSo I let him come down, and I must confess that he had reason on his\nside. \"Plaise your worship\"--John called me so, ever since I returned\nfrom London, firmly believing that the King had made me a magistrate\nat least; though I was to keep it secret--\"us zeed as how your worship\nwere took with thinkin' of King's business, in the middle of the\nwhate-rigg: and so uz zed, 'Latt un coom to his zell, us had better zave\ntaime, by takking our dinner'; and here us be, praise your worship, and\nhopps no offence with thick iron spoon full of vried taties.\"\n\nI was glad enough to accept the ladle full of fried batatas, and to make\nthe best of things, which is generally done by letting men have their\nown way. Therefore I managed to dine with them, although it was so\nearly.\n\nFor according to all that I can find, in a long life and a varied one,\ntwelve o'clock is the real time for a man to have his dinner. Then the\nsun is at his noon, calling halt to look around, and then the plants and\nleaves are turning, each with a little leisure time, before the work of\nthe afternoon. Then is the balance of east and west, and then the right\nand left side of a man are in due proportion, and contribute fairly\nwith harmonious fluids. And the health of this mode of life, and its\nreclaiming virtue are well set forth in our ancient rhyme,--\n\n    \"Sunrise, breakfast; sun high, dinner;\n     Sundown, sup; makes a saint of a sinner.\"\n\nWhish, the wheat falls! Whirl again; ye have had good dinners; give your\nmaster and mistress plenty to supply another year. And in truth we did\nreap well and fairly, through the whole of that afternoon, I not only\nkeeping lead, but keeping the men up to it. We got through a matter of\nten acres, ere the sun between the shocks broke his light on wheaten\nplumes, then hung his red cloak on the clouds, and fell into grey\nslumber.\n\nSeeing this we wiped our sickles, and our breasts and foreheads, and\nsoon were on the homeward road, looking forward to good supper.\n\nOf course all the reapers came at night to the harvest-supper, and\nParson Bowden to say the grace as well as to help to carve for us. And\nsome help was needed there, I can well assure you; for the reapers had\nbrave appetites, and most of their wives having babies were forced to\neat as a duty. Neither failed they of this duty; cut and come again was\nthe order of the evening, as it had been of the day; and I had no time\nto ask questions, but help meat and ladle gravy. All the while our\ndarling Annie, with her sleeves tucked up, and her comely figure\npanting, was running about with a bucket of taties mashed with lard and\ncabbage. Even Lizzie had left her books, and was serving out beer and\ncider; while mother helped plum-pudding largely on pewter-plates with\nthe mutton. And all the time, Betty Muxworthy was grunting in and out\neverywhere, not having space to scold even, but changing the dishes,\nserving the meat, poking the fire, and cooking more. But John Fry would\nnot stir a peg, except with his knife and fork, having all the airs of a\nvisitor, and his wife to keep him eating, till I thought there would be\nno end of it.\n\n[Illustration: 242.jpg Annie and Lizzie]\n\nThen having eaten all they could, they prepared themselves, with one\naccord, for the business now of drinking. But first they lifted the neck\nof corn, dressed with ribbons gaily, and set it upon the mantelpiece,\neach man with his horn a-froth; and then they sang a song about it,\nevery one shouting in the chorus louder than harvest thunderstorm. Some\nwere in the middle of one verse, and some at the end of the next one;\nyet somehow all managed to get together in the mighty roar of the\nburden. And if any farmer up the country would like to know Exmoor\nharvest-song as sung in my time and will be sung long after I am\ngarnered home, lo, here I set it down for him, omitting only the\ndialect, which perchance might puzzle him.\n\n[Illustration: 243.jpg Harvest]\n\n                   EXMOOR HARVEST-SONG\n\n     1\n\n     The corn, oh the corn, 'tis the ripening of the corn!\n     Go unto the door, my lad, and look beneath the moon,\n     Thou canst see, beyond the woodrick, how it is yelloon:\n     'Tis the harvesting of wheat, and the barley must be shorn.\n\n     (Chorus)\n\n     The corn, oh the corn, and the yellow, mellow corn!\n     Here's to the corn, with the cups upon the board!\n     We've been reaping all the day, and we'll reap again the morn\n     And fetch it home to mow-yard, and then we'll thank the Lord.\n\n\n     2\n\n     The wheat, oh the wheat, 'tis the ripening of the wheat!\n     All the day it has been hanging down its heavy head,\n     Bowing over on our bosoms with a beard of red:\n     'Tis the harvest, and the value makes the labour sweet.\n\n     (Chorus)\n\n     The wheat, oh the wheat, and the golden, golden wheat!\n     Here's to the wheat, with the loaves upon the board!\n     We've been reaping all the day, and we never will be beat\n     And fetch it all to mow-yard, and then we'll thank the Lord.\n\n\n     3\n\n     The barley, oh the barley, and the barley is in prime!\n     All the day it has been rustling, with its bristles brown,\n     Waiting with its beard abowing, till it can be mown!\n     'Tis the harvest and the barley must abide its time.\n\n     (Chorus)\n\n     The barley, oh the barley, and the barley ruddy brown!\n     Here's to the barley, with the beer upon the board!\n     We'll go amowing, soon as ever all the wheat is down;\n     When all is in the mow-yard, we'll stop, and thank the Lord.\n\n\n     4\n\n     The oats, oh the oats, 'tis the ripening of the oats!\n     All the day they have been dancing with their flakes of white,\n     Waiting for the girding-hook, to be the nags' delight:\n     'Tis the harvest, let them dangle in their skirted coats.\n\n     (Chorus)\n\n     The oats, oh the oats, and the silver, silver oats!\n     Here's to the oats with the blackstone on the board!\n     We'll go among them, when the barley has been laid in rotes:\n     When all is home to mow-yard, we'll kneel and thank the Lord.\n\n\n     5\n\n     The corn, oh the corn, and the blessing of the corn!\n     Come unto the door, my lads, and look beneath the moon,\n     We can see, on hill and valley, how it is yelloon,\n     With a breadth of glory, as when our Lord was born.\n\n     (Chorus)\n\n     The corn, oh the corn, and the yellow, mellow corn!\n     Thanks for the corn, with our bread upon the board!\n     So shall we acknowledge it, before we reap the morn,\n     With our hands to heaven, and our knees unto the Lord.\n\n\nNow we sang this song very well the first time, having the parish choir\nto lead us, and the clarionet, and the parson to give us the time with\nhis cup; and we sang it again the second time, not so but what you might\npraise it (if you had been with us all the evening), although the parson\nwas gone then, and the clerk not fit to compare with him in the matter\nof keeping time. But when that song was in its third singing, I defy any\nman (however sober) to have made out one verse from the other, or even\nthe burden from the verses, inasmuch as every man present, ay, and woman\ntoo, sang as became convenient to them, in utterance both of words and\ntune.\n\nAnd in truth, there was much excuse for them; because it was a noble\nharvest, fit to thank the Lord for, without His thinking us hypocrites.\nFor we had more land in wheat, that year, than ever we had before,\nand twice the crop to the acre; and I could not help now and then\nremembering, in the midst of the merriment, how my father in the\nchurchyard yonder would have gloried to behold it. And my mother, who\nhad left us now, happening to return just then, being called to have her\nhealth drunk (for the twentieth time at least), I knew by the sadness\nin her eyes that she was thinking just as I was. Presently, therefore,\nI slipped away from the noise, and mirth, and smoking (although of that\nlast there was not much, except from Farmer Nicholas), and crossing the\ncourtyard in the moonlight, I went, just to cool myself, as far as my\nfather's tombstone.\n\n[Illustration: 245.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nANNIE GETS THE BEST OF IT\n\n[Illustration: 246.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nI had long outgrown unwholesome feeling as to my father's death, and\nso had Annie; though Lizzie (who must have loved him least) still\nentertained some evil will, and longing for a punishment. Therefore I\nwas surprised (and indeed, startled would not be too much to say,\nthe moon being somewhat fleecy), to see our Annie sitting there as\nmotionless as the tombstone, and with all her best fallals upon her,\nafter stowing away the dishes.\n\nMy nerves, however, are good and strong, except at least in love\nmatters, wherein they always fail me, and when I meet with witches; and\ntherefore I went up to Annie, although she looked so white and pure;\nfor I had seen her before with those things on, and it struck me who she\nwas.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Annie?\" I inquired rather sternly, being vexed\nwith her for having gone so very near to frighten me.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" said our Annie shortly. And indeed it was truth enough\nfor a woman. Not that I dare to believe that women are such liars as men\nsay; only that I mean they often see things round the corner, and know\nnot which is which of it. And indeed I never have known a woman\n(though right enough in their meaning) purely and perfectly true and\ntransparent, except only my Lorna; and even so, I might not have loved\nher, if she had been ugly.\n\n\"Why, how so?\" said I; \"Miss Annie, what business have you here, doing\nnothing at this time of night? And leaving me with all the trouble to\nentertain our guests!\"\n\n\"You seem not to me to be doing it, John,\" Annie answered softly; \"what\nbusiness have you here doing nothing, at this time of night?\"\n\nI was taken so aback with this, and the extreme impertinence of it, from\na mere young girl like Annie, that I turned round to march away and\nhave nothing more to say to her. But she jumped up, and caught me by the\nhand, and threw herself upon my bosom, with her face all wet with tears.\n\n\"Oh, John, I will tell you. I will tell you. Only don't be angry, John.\"\n\n\"Angry! no indeed,\" said I; \"what right have I to be angry with you,\nbecause you have your secrets? Every chit of a girl thinks now that she\nhas a right to her secrets.\"\n\n\"And you have none of your own, John; of course you have none of your\nown? All your going out at night--\"\n\n\"We will not quarrel here, poor Annie,\" I answered, with some loftiness;\n\"there are many things upon my mind, which girls can have no notion of.\"\n\n\"And so there are upon mine, John. Oh, John, I will tell you everything,\nif you will look at me kindly, and promise to forgive me. Oh, I am so\nmiserable!\"\n\nNow this, though she was behaving so badly, moved me much towards her;\nespecially as I longed to know what she had to tell me. Therefore I\nallowed her to coax me, and to kiss me, and to lead me away a little, as\nfar as the old yew-tree; for she would not tell me where she was.\n\nBut even in the shadow there, she was very long before beginning, and\nseemed to have two minds about it, or rather perhaps a dozen; and she\nlaid her cheek against the tree, and sobbed till it was pitiful; and I\nknew what mother would say to her for spoiling her best frock so.\n\n\"Now will you stop?\" I said at last, harder than I meant it, for I knew\nthat she would go on all night, if any one encouraged her: and though\nnot well acquainted with women, I understood my sisters; or else I must\nbe a born fool--except, of course, that I never professed to understand\nEliza.\n\n\"Yes, I will stop,\" said Annie, panting; \"you are very hard on me, John;\nbut I know you mean it for the best. If somebody else--I am sure I don't\nknow who, and have no right to know, no doubt, but she must be a wicked\nthing--if somebody else had been taken so with a pain all round the\nheart, John, and no power of telling it, perhaps you would have coaxed,\nand kissed her, and come a little nearer, and made opportunity to be\nvery loving.\"\n\nNow this was so exactly what I had tried to do to Lorna, that my breath\nwas almost taken away at Annie's so describing it. For a while I could\nnot say a word, but wondered if she were a witch, which had never been\nin our family: and then, all of a sudden, I saw the way to beat her,\nwith the devil at my elbow.\n\n\"From your knowledge of these things, Annie, you must have had them done\nto you. I demand to know this very moment who has taken such liberties.\"\n\n\"Then, John, you shall never know, if you ask in that manner. Besides,\nit was no liberty in the least at all, Cousins have a right to do\nthings--and when they are one's godfather--\" Here Annie stopped quite\nsuddenly having so betrayed herself; but met me in the full moonlight,\nbeing resolved to face it out, with a good face put upon it.\n\n\"Alas, I feared it would come to this,\" I answered very sadly; \"I know\nhe has been here many a time, without showing himself to me. There is\nnothing meaner than for a man to sneak, and steal a young maid's heart,\nwithout her people knowing it.\"\n\n\"You are not doing anything of that sort yourself then, dear John, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Only a common highwayman!\" I answered, without heeding her; \"a man\nwithout an acre of his own, and liable to hang upon any common, and no\nother right of common over it--\"\n\n\"John,\" said my sister, \"are the Doones privileged not to be hanged upon\ncommon land?\"\n\nAt this I was so thunderstruck, that I leaped in the air like a shot\nrabbit, and rushed as hard as I could through the gate and across the\nyard, and back into the kitchen; and there I asked Farmer Nicholas Snowe\nto give me some tobacco, and to lend me a spare pipe.\n\n[Illustration: 248.jpg Spare Pipe]\n\nThis he did with a grateful manner, being now some five-fourths gone;\nand so I smoked the very first pipe that ever had entered my lips till\nthen; and beyond a doubt it did me good, and spread my heart at leisure.\n\nMeanwhile the reapers were mostly gone, to be up betimes in the morning;\nand some were led by their wives; and some had to lead their wives\nthemselves, according to the capacity of man and wife respectively. But\nBetty was as lively as ever, bustling about with every one, and looking\nout for the chance of groats, which the better off might be free with.\nAnd over the kneading-pan next day, she dropped three and sixpence out\nof her pocket; and Lizzie could not tell for her life how much more\nmight have been in it.\n\nNow by this time I had almost finished smoking that pipe of tobacco, and\nwondering at myself for having so despised it hitherto, and making up my\nmind to have another trial to-morrow night, it began to occur to me that\nalthough dear Annie had behaved so very badly and rudely, and almost\ntaken my breath away with the suddenness of her allusion, yet it was not\nkind of me to leave her out there at that time of night, all alone, and\nin such distress. Any of the reapers going home might be gotten so far\nbeyond fear of ghosts as to venture into the churchyard; and although\nthey would know a great deal better than to insult a sister of mine when\nsober, there was no telling what they might do in their present state of\nrejoicing. Moreover, it was only right that I should learn, for Lorna's\nsake, how far Annie, or any one else, had penetrated our secret.\n\nTherefore, I went forth at once, bearing my pipe in a skilful manner, as\nI had seen Farmer Nicholas do; and marking, with a new kind of pleasure,\nhow the rings and wreaths of smoke hovered and fluttered in the\nmoonlight, like a lark upon his carol. Poor Annie was gone back again\nto our father's grave, and there she sat upon the turf, sobbing very\ngently, and not wishing to trouble any one. So I raised her tenderly,\nand made much of her, and consoled her, for I could not scold her there;\nand perhaps after all she was not to be blamed so much as Tom Faggus\nhimself was. Annie was very grateful to me, and kissed me many times,\nand begged my pardon ever so often for her rudeness to me. And then\nhaving gone so far with it, and finding me so complaisant, she must\nneeds try to go a little further, and to lead me away from her own\naffairs, and into mine concerning Lorna. But although it was clever\nenough of her she was not deep enough for me there; and I soon\ndiscovered that she knew nothing, not even the name of my darling; but\nonly suspected from things she had seen, and put together like a woman.\nUpon this I brought her back again to Tom Faggus and his doings.\n\n\"My poor Annie, have you really promised him to be his wife?\"\n\n\"Then after all you have no reason, John, no particular reason, I mean,\nfor slighting poor Sally Snowe so?\"\n\n\"Without even asking mother or me! Oh, Annie, it was wrong of you!\"\n\n\"But, darling, you know that mother wishes you so much to marry Sally;\nand I am sure you could have her to-morrow. She dotes on the very\nground--\"\n\n\"I dare say he tells you that, Annie, that he dotes on the ground you\nwalk upon--but did you believe him, child?\"\n\n\"You may believe me, I assure you, John, and half the farm to be settled\nupon her, after the old man's time; and though she gives herself little\nairs, it is only done to entice you; she has the very best hand in the\ndairy John, and the lightest at a turn-over cake--\"\n\n\"Now, Annie, don't talk nonsense so. I wish just to know the truth about\nyou and Tom Faggus. Do you mean to marry him?\"\n\n\"I to marry before my brother, and leave him with none to take care of\nhim! Who can do him a red deer collop, except Sally herself, as I can?\nCome home, dear, at once, and I will do you one; for you never ate a\nmorsel of supper, with all the people you had to attend upon.\"\n\nThis was true enough; and seeing no chance of anything more than cross\nquestions and crooked purposes, at which a girl was sure to beat me,\nI even allowed her to lead me home, with the thoughts of the collop\nuppermost. But I never counted upon being beaten so thoroughly as I was;\nfor knowing me now to be off my guard, the young hussy stopped at\nthe farmyard gate, as if with a brier entangling her, and while I\nwas stooping to take it away, she looked me full in the face by the\nmoonlight, and jerked out quite suddenly,--\n\n\"Can your love do a collop, John?\"\n\n\"No, I should hope not,\" I answered rashly; \"she is not a mere cook-maid\nI should hope.\"\n\n\"She is not half so pretty as Sally Snowe; I will answer for that,\" said\nAnnie.\n\n\"She is ten thousand times as pretty as ten thousand Sally Snowes,\" I\nreplied with great indignation.\n\n\"Oh, but look at Sally's eyes!\" cried my sister rapturously.\n\n\"Look at Lorna Doone's,\" said I; \"and you would never look again at\nSally's.\"\n\n\"Oh Lorna Doone. Lorna Doone!\" exclaimed our Annie half-frightened, yet\nclapping her hands with triumph, at having found me out so: \"Lorna Doone\nis the lovely maiden, who has stolen poor somebody's heart so. Ah, I\nshall remember it; because it is so queer a name. But stop, I had better\nwrite it down. Lend me your hat, poor boy, to write on.\"\n\n\"I have a great mind to lend you a box on the ear,\" I answered her in\nmy vexation, \"and I would, if you had not been crying so, you sly\ngood-for-nothing baggage. As it is, I shall keep it for Master Faggus,\nand add interest for keeping.\"\n\n\"Oh no, John; oh no, John,\" she begged me earnestly, being sobered in\na moment. \"Your hand is so terribly heavy, John; and he never would\nforgive you; although he is so good-hearted, he cannot put up with an\ninsult. Promise me, dear John, that you will not strike him; and I will\npromise you faithfully to keep your secret, even from mother, and even\nfrom Cousin Tom himself.\"\n\n\"And from Lizzie; most of all, from Lizzie,\" I answered very eagerly,\nknowing too well which of my relations would be hardest with me.\n\n\"Of course from little Lizzie,\" said Annie, with some contempt; \"a\nyoung thing like her cannot be kept too long, in my opinion, from the\nknowledge of such subjects. And besides, I should be very sorry if\nLizzie had the right to know your secrets, as I have, dearest John. Not\na soul shall be the wiser for your having trusted me, John; although\nI shall be very wretched when you are late away at night, among those\ndreadful people.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"it is no use crying over spilt milk Annie. You have\nmy secret, and I have yours; and I scarcely know which of the two is\nlikely to have the worst time of it, when it comes to mother's ears. I\ncould put up with perpetual scolding but not with mother's sad silence.\"\n\n\"That is exactly how I feel, John.\" and as Annie said it she brightened\nup, and her soft eyes shone upon me; \"but now I shall be much happier,\ndear; because I shall try to help you. No doubt the young lady deserves\nit, John. She is not after the farm, I hope?\"\n\n\"She!\" I exclaimed; and that was enough, there was so much scorn in my\nvoice and face.\n\n\"Then, I am sure, I am very glad,\" Annie always made the best of things;\n\"for I do believe that Sally Snowe has taken a fancy to our dairy-place,\nand the pattern of our cream-pans; and she asked so much about our\nmeadows, and the colour of the milk--\"\n\n\"Then, after all, you were right, dear Annie; it is the ground she dotes\nupon.\"\n\n\"And the things that walk upon it,\" she answered me with another kiss;\n\"Sally has taken a wonderful fancy to our best cow, 'Nipple-pins.' But\nshe never shall have her now; what a consolation!\"\n\nWe entered the house quite gently thus, and found Farmer Nicholas Snowe\nasleep, little dreaming how his plans had been overset between us. And\nthen Annie said to me very slyly, between a smile and a blush,--\n\n\"Don't you wish Lorna Doone was here, John, in the parlour along with\nmother; instead of those two fashionable milkmaids, as Uncle Ben will\ncall them, and poor stupid Mistress Kebby?\"\n\n\"That indeed I do, Annie. I must kiss you for only thinking of it. Dear\nme, it seems as if you had known all about us for a twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"She loves you, with all her heart, John. No doubt about that of\ncourse.\" And Annie looked up at me, as much as to say she would like to\nknow who could help it.\n\n\"That's the very thing she won't do,\" said I, knowing that Annie would\nlove me all the more for it, \"she is only beginning to like me, Annie;\nand as for loving, she is so young that she only loves her grandfather.\nBut I hope she will come to it by-and-by.\"\n\n\"Of course she must,\" replied my sister, \"it will be impossible for her\nto help it.\"\n\n\"Ah well! I don't know,\" for I wanted more assurance of it. \"Maidens are\nsuch wondrous things!\"\n\n[Illustration: 253.jpg Maidens are such wondrous things]\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Annie, casting her bright eyes downwards: \"love\nis as simple as milking, when people know how to do it. But you must not\nlet her alone too long; that is my advice to you. What a simpleton you\nmust have been not to tell me long ago. I would have made Lorna wild\nabout you, long before this time, Johnny. But now you go into the\nparlour, dear, while I do your collop. Faith Snowe is not come, but\nPolly and Sally. Sally has made up her mind to conquer you this very\nblessed evening, John. Only look what a thing of a scarf she has on; I\nshould be quite ashamed to wear it. But you won't strike poor Tom, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not I, my darling, for your sweet sake.\"\n\nAnd so dear Annie, having grown quite brave, gave me a little push into\nthe parlour, where I was quite abashed to enter after all I had heard\nabout Sally. And I made up my mind to examine her well, and try a little\ncourting with her, if she should lead me on, that I might be in practice\nfor Lorna. But when I perceived how grandly and richly both the\nyoung damsels were apparelled; and how, in their curtseys to me, they\nretreated, as if I were making up to them, in a way they had learned\nfrom Exeter; and how they began to talk of the Court, as if they had\nbeen there all their lives, and the latest mode of the Duchess of this,\nand the profile of the Countess of that, and the last good saying of my\nLord something; instead of butter, and cream, and eggs, and things\nwhich they understood; I knew there must be somebody in the room besides\nJasper Kebby to talk at.\n\nAnd so there was; for behind the curtain drawn across the window-seat no\nless a man than Uncle Ben was sitting half asleep and weary; and by his\nside a little girl very quiet and very watchful. My mother led me to\nUncle Ben, and he took my hand without rising, muttering something not\nover-polite, about my being bigger than ever. I asked him heartily how\nhe was, and he said, \"Well enough, for that matter; but none the better\nfor the noise you great clods have been making.\"\n\n\"I am sorry if we have disturbed you, sir,\" I answered very civilly;\n\"but I knew not that you were here even; and you must allow for harvest\ntime.\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" he replied; \"and allow a great deal, including waste\nand drunkenness. Now (if you can see so small a thing, after emptying\nflagons much larger) this is my granddaughter, and my heiress\"--here he\nglanced at mother--\"my heiress, little Ruth Huckaback.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to see you, Ruth,\" I answered, offering her my hand,\nwhich she seemed afraid to take, \"welcome to Plover's Barrows, my good\ncousin Ruth.\"\n\nHowever, my good cousin Ruth only arose, and made me a curtsey, and\nlifted her great brown eyes at me, more in fear, as I thought, than\nkinship. And if ever any one looked unlike the heiress to great\nproperty, it was the little girl before me.\n\n\"Come out to the kitchen, dear, and let me chuck you to the ceiling,\" I\nsaid, just to encourage her; \"I always do it to little girls; and then\nthey can see the hams and bacon.\" But Uncle Reuben burst out laughing;\nand Ruth turned away with a deep rich colour.\n\n\"Do you know how old she is, you numskull?\" said Uncle Ben, in his\ndryest drawl; \"she was seventeen last July, sir.\"\n\n\"On the first of July, grandfather,\" Ruth whispered, with her back still\nto me; \"but many people will not believe it.\"\n\nHere mother came up to my rescue, as she always loved to do; and she\nsaid, \"If my son may not dance Miss Ruth, at any rate he may dance with\nher. We have only been waiting for you, dear John, to have a little\nharvest dance, with the kitchen door thrown open. You take Ruth; Uncle\nBen take Sally; Master Debby pair off with Polly; and neighbour Nicholas\nwill be good enough, if I can awake him, to stand up with fair Mistress\nKebby. Lizzie will play us the virginal. Won't you, Lizzie dear?\"\n\n\"But who is to dance with you, madam?\" Uncle Ben asked, very politely.\n\"I think you must rearrange your figure. I have not danced for a score\nof years; and I will not dance now, while the mistress and the owner of\nthe harvest sits aside neglected.\"\n\n\"Nay, Master Huckaback,\" cried Sally Snowe, with a saucy toss of her\nhair; \"Mistress Ridd is too kind a great deal, in handing you over to\nme. You take her; and I will fetch Annie to be my partner this evening.\nI like dancing very much better with girls, for they never squeeze and\nrumple one. Oh, it is so much nicer!\"\n\n\"Have no fear for me, my dears,\" our mother answered smiling: \"Parson\nBowden promised to come back again; I expect him every minute; and he\nintends to lead me off, and to bring a partner for Annie too, a very\npretty young gentleman. Now begin; and I will join you.\"\n\nThere was no disobeying her, without rudeness; and indeed the girls'\nfeet were already jigging; and Lizzie giving herself wonderful airs with\na roll of learned music; and even while Annie was doing my collop,\nher pretty round instep was arching itself, as I could see from the\nparlour-door. So I took little Ruth, and I spun her around, as the sound\nof the music came lively and ringing; and after us came all the rest\nwith much laughter, begging me not to jump over her; and anon my grave\npartner began to smile sweetly, and look up at me with the brightest of\neyes, and drop me the prettiest curtseys; till I thought what a great\nstupe I must have been to dream of putting her in the cheese-rack. But\none thing I could not at all understand; why mother, who used to do\nall in her power to throw me across Sally Snowe, should now do the very\nopposite; for she would not allow me one moment with Sally, not even to\ncross in the dance, or whisper, or go anywhere near a corner (which as I\nsaid, I intended to do, just by way of practice), while she kept me, all\nthe evening, as close as possible with Ruth Huckaback, and came up\nand praised me so to Ruth, times and again, that I declare I was quite\nashamed. Although of course I knew that I deserved it all, but I could\nnot well say that.\n\nThen Annie came sailing down the dance, with her beautiful hair flowing\nround her; the lightest figure in all the room, and the sweetest, and\nthe loveliest. She was blushing, with her fair cheeks red beneath\nher dear blue eyes, as she met my glance of surprise and grief at the\npartner she was leaning on. It was Squire Marwood de Whichehalse. I\nwould sooner have seen her with Tom Faggus, as indeed I had expected,\nwhen I heard of Parson Bowden. And to me it seemed that she had no\nright to be dancing so with any other; and to this effect I contrived to\nwhisper; but she only said, \"See to yourself, John. No, but let us both\nenjoy ourselves. You are not dancing with Lorna, John. But you seem\nuncommonly happy.\"\n\n\"Tush,\" I said; \"could I flip about so, if I had my love with me?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nJOHN FRY'S ERRAND\n\n[Illustration: 256.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nWe kept up the dance very late that night, mother being in such\nwonderful spirits, that she would not hear of our going to bed: while\nshe glanced from young Squire Marwood, very deep in his talk with our\nAnnie, to me and Ruth Huckaback who were beginning to be very pleasant\ncompany. Alas, poor mother, so proud as she was, how little she dreamed\nthat her good schemes already were hopelessly going awry!\n\nBeing forced to be up before daylight next day, in order to begin right\nearly, I would not go to my bedroom that night for fear of disturbing my\nmother, but determined to sleep in the tallat awhile, that place being\ncool, and airy, and refreshing with the smell of sweet hay. Moreover,\nafter my dwelling in town, where I had felt like a horse on a lime-kiln,\nI could not for a length of time have enough of country life. The mooing\nof a calf was music, and the chuckle of a fowl was wit, and the snore of\nthe horses was news to me.\n\n\"Wult have thee own wai, I reckon,\" said Betty, being cross with\nsleepiness, for she had washed up everything; \"slape in hog-pound, if\nthee laikes, Jan.\"\n\nLetting her have the last word of it (as is the due of women) I stood in\nthe court, and wondered awhile at the glory of the harvest moon, and the\nyellow world it shone upon. Then I saw, as sure as ever I was standing\nthere in the shadow of the stable, I saw a short wide figure glide\nacross the foot of the courtyard, between me and the six-barred gate.\nInstead of running after it, as I should have done, I began to consider\nwho it could be, and what on earth was doing there, when all our people\nwere in bed, and the reapers gone home, or to the linhay close against\nthe wheatfield.\n\nHaving made up my mind at last, that it could be none of our\npeople--though not a dog was barking--and also that it must have been\neither a girl or a woman, I ran down with all speed to learn what might\nbe the meaning of it. But I came too late to learn, through my own\nhesitation, for this was the lower end of the courtyard, not the\napproach from the parish highway, but the end of the sledd-way, across\nthe fields where the brook goes down to the Lynn stream, and where\nSquire Faggus had saved the old drake. And of course the dry channel\nof the brook, being scarcely any water now, afforded plenty of place to\nhide, leading also to a little coppice, beyond our cabbage-garden, and\nso further on to the parish highway.\n\nI saw at once that it was vain to make any pursuit by moonlight; and\nresolving to hold my own counsel about it (though puzzled not a\nlittle) and to keep watch there another night, back I returned to the\ntallatt-ladder, and slept without leaving off till morning.\n\nNow many people may wish to know, as indeed I myself did very greatly,\nwhat had brought Master Huckaback over from Dulverton, at that time of\nyear, when the clothing business was most active on account of harvest\nwages, and when the new wheat was beginning to sample from the early\nparts up the country (for he meddled as well in corn-dealing) and when\nwe could not attend to him properly by reason of our occupation. And\nyet more surprising it seemed to me that he should have brought his\ngranddaughter also, instead of the troop of dragoons, without which\nhe had vowed he would never come here again. And how he had managed to\nenter the house together with his granddaughter, and be sitting quite at\nhome in the parlour there, without any knowledge or even suspicion on\nmy part. That last question was easily solved, for mother herself had\nadmitted them by means of the little passage, during a chorus of the\nharvest-song which might have drowned an earthquake: but as for his\nmeaning and motive, and apparent neglect of his business, none but\nhimself could interpret them; and as he did not see fit to do so, we\ncould not be rude enough to inquire.\n\nHe seemed in no hurry to take his departure, though his visit was so\ninconvenient to us, as himself indeed must have noticed: and presently\nLizzie, who was the sharpest among us, said in my hearing that she\nbelieved he had purposely timed his visit so that he might have liberty\nto pursue his own object, whatsoever it were, without interruption\nfrom us. Mother gazed hard upon Lizzie at this, having formed a very\ndifferent opinion; but Annie and myself agreed that it was worth looking\ninto.\n\nNow how could we look into it, without watching Uncle Reuben, whenever\nhe went abroad, and trying to catch him in his speech, when he was\ntaking his ease at night. For, in spite of all the disgust with which\nhe had spoken of harvest wassailing, there was not a man coming into\nour kitchen who liked it better than he did; only in a quiet way, and\nwithout too many witnesses. Now to endeavour to get at the purpose of\nany guest, even a treacherous one (which we had no right to think Uncle\nReuben) by means of observing him in his cups, is a thing which even the\nlowest of people would regard with abhorrence. And to my mind it was not\nclear whether it would be fair-play at all to follow a visitor even at a\ndistance from home and clear of our premises; except for the purpose of\nfetching him back, and giving him more to go on with. Nevertheless we\ncould not but think, the times being wild and disjointed, that Uncle\nBen was not using fairly the part of a guest in our house, to make long\nexpeditions we knew not whither, and involve us in trouble we knew not\nwhat.\n\nFor his mode was directly after breakfast to pray to the Lord a little\n(which used not to be his practice), and then to go forth upon Dolly,\nthe which was our Annie's pony, very quiet and respectful, with a bag of\ngood victuals hung behind him, and two great cavalry pistols in front.\nAnd he always wore his meanest clothes as if expecting to be robbed,\nor to disarm the temptation thereto; and he never took his golden\nchronometer neither his bag of money. So much the girls found out and\ntold me (for I was never at home myself by day); and they very craftily\nspurred me on, having less noble ideas perhaps, to hit upon Uncle\nReuben's track, and follow, and see what became of him. For he never\nreturned until dark or more, just in time to be in before us, who were\ncoming home from the harvest. And then Dolly always seemed very weary,\nand stained with a muck from beyond our parish.\n\nBut I refused to follow him, not only for the loss of a day's work to\nmyself, and at least half a day to the other men, but chiefly because I\ncould not think that it would be upright and manly. It was all very\nwell to creep warily into the valley of the Doones, and heed everything\naround me, both because they were public enemies, and also because I\nrisked my life at every step I took there. But as to tracking a feeble\nold man (however subtle he might be), a guest moreover of our own, and\na relative through my mother.--\"Once for all,\" I said, \"it is below me,\nand I won't do it.\"\n\nThereupon, the girls, knowing my way, ceased to torment me about it: but\nwhat was my astonishment the very next day to perceive that instead of\nfourteen reapers, we were only thirteen left, directly our breakfast\nwas done with--or mowers rather I should say, for we were gone into the\nbarley now.\n\n\"Who has been and left his scythe?\" I asked; \"and here's a tin cup never\nbeen handled!\"\n\n\"Whoy, dudn't ee knaw, Maister Jan,\" said Bill Dadds, looking at me\nqueerly, \"as Jan Vry wur gane avore braxvass.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" I answered, \"John knows what he is doing.\" For John\nFry was a kind of foreman now, and it would not do to say anything that\nmight lessen his authority. However, I made up my mind to rope him, when\nI should catch him by himself, without peril to his dignity.\n\nBut when I came home in the evening, late and almost weary, there was no\nAnnie cooking my supper, nor Lizzie by the fire reading, nor even little\nRuth Huckaback watching the shadows and pondering. Upon this, I went to\nthe girls' room, not in the very best of tempers, and there I found all\nthree of them in the little place set apart for Annie, eagerly listening\nto John Fry, who was telling some great adventure. John had a great jug\nof ale beside him, and a horn well drained; and he clearly looked upon\nhimself as a hero, and the maids seemed to be of the same opinion.\n\n\"Well done, John,\" my sister was saying, \"capitally done, John Fry. How\nvery brave you have been, John. Now quick, let us hear the rest of it.\"\n\n\"What does all this nonsense mean?\" I said, in a voice which frightened\nthem, as I could see by the light of our own mutton candles: \"John Fry,\nyou be off to your wife at once, or you shall have what I owe you now,\ninstead of to-morrow morning.\"\n\nJohn made no answer, but scratched his head, and looked at the maidens\nto take his part.\n\n\"It is you that must be off, I think,\" said Lizzie, looking straight at\nme with all the impudence in the world; \"what right have you to come in\nhere to the young ladies' room, without an invitation even?\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Lizzie, I suppose mother has some right here.\" And with\nthat, I was going away to fetch her, knowing that she always took my\nside, and never would allow the house to be turned upside down in that\nmanner. But Annie caught hold of me by the arm, and little Ruth stood in\nthe doorway; and Lizzie said, \"Don't be a fool, John. We know things of\nyou, you know; a great deal more than you dream of.\"\n\nUpon this I glanced at Annie, to learn whether she had been telling,\nbut her pure true face reassured me at once, and then she said very\ngently,--\n\n\"Lizzie, you talk too fast, my child. No one knows anything of our John\nwhich he need be ashamed of; and working as he does from light to dusk,\nand earning the living of all of us, he is entitled to choose his own\ngood time for going out and for coming in, without consulting a little\ngirl five years younger than himself. Now, John, sit down, and you shall\nknow all that we have done, though I doubt whether you will approve of\nit.\"\n\nUpon this I kissed Annie, and so did Ruth; and John Fry looked a deal\nmore comfortable, but Lizzie only made a face at us. Then Annie began as\nfollows:--\n\n\"You must know, dear John, that we have been extremely curious, ever\nsince Uncle Reuben came, to know what he was come for, especially at\nthis time of year, when he is at his busiest. He never vouchsafed any\nexplanation, neither gave any reason, true or false, which shows his\nentire ignorance of all feminine nature. If Ruth had known, and refused\nto tell us, we should have been much easier, because we must have got it\nout of Ruth before two or three days were over. But darling Ruth knew no\nmore than we did, and indeed I must do her the justice to say that she\nhas been quite as inquisitive. Well, we might have put up with it, if it\nhad not been for his taking Dolly, my own pet Dolly, away every morning,\nquite as if she belonged to him, and keeping her out until close upon\ndark, and then bringing her home in a frightful condition. And he even\nhad the impudence, when I told him that Dolly was my pony, to say that\nwe owed him a pony, ever since you took from him that little horse upon\nwhich you found him strapped so snugly; and he means to take Dolly to\nDulverton with him, to run in his little cart. If there is law in the\nland he shall not. Surely, John, you will not let him?\"\n\n\"That I won't,\" said I, \"except upon the conditions which I offered him\nonce before. If we owe him the pony, we owe him the straps.\"\n\nSweet Annie laughed, like a bell, at this, and then she went on with her\nstory.\n\n\"Well, John, we were perfectly miserable. You cannot understand it, of\ncourse; but I used to go every evening, and hug poor Dolly, and kiss\nher, and beg her to tell me where she had been, and what she had seen,\nthat day. But never having belonged to Balaam, darling Dolly was quite\nunsuccessful, though often she strove to tell me, with her ears down,\nand both eyes rolling. Then I made John Fry tie her tail in a knot, with\na piece of white ribbon, as if for adornment, that I might trace her\namong the hills, at any rate for a mile or two. But Uncle Ben was too\ndeep for that; he cut off the ribbon before he started, saying he\nwould have no Doones after him. And then, in despair, I applied to you,\nknowing how quick of foot you are, and I got Ruth and Lizzie to help me,\nbut you answered us very shortly; and a very poor supper you had that\nnight, according to your deserts.\n\n\"But though we were dashed to the ground for a time, we were not wholly\ndiscomfited. Our determination to know all about it seemed to increase\nwith the difficulty. And Uncle Ben's manner last night was so dry,\nwhen we tried to romp and to lead him out, that it was much worse than\nJamaica ginger grated into a poor sprayed finger. So we sent him to\nbed at the earliest moment, and held a small council upon him. If\nyou remember you, John, having now taken to smoke (which is a hateful\npractice), had gone forth grumbling about your bad supper and not taking\nit as a good lesson.\"\n\n\"Why, Annie,\" I cried, in amazement at this, \"I will never trust you\nagain for a supper. I thought you were so sorry.\"\n\n\"And so I was, dear; very sorry. But still we must do our duty. And when\nwe came to consider it, Ruth was the cleverest of us all; for she said\nthat surely we must have some man we could trust about the farm to go\non a little errand; and then I remembered that old John Fry would do\nanything for money.\"\n\n\"Not for money, plaize, miss,\" said John Fry, taking a pull at the beer;\n\"but for the love of your swate face.\"\n\n\"To be sure, John; with the King's behind it. And so Lizzie ran for John\nFry at once, and we gave him full directions, how he was to slip out of\nthe barley in the confusion of the breakfast, so that none might miss\nhim; and to run back to the black combe bottom, and there he would find\nthe very same pony which Uncle Ben had been tied upon, and there is no\nfaster upon the farm. And then, without waiting for any breakfast unless\nhe could eat it either running or trotting, he was to travel all up the\nblack combe, by the track Uncle Reuben had taken, and up at the top to\nlook forward carefully, and so to trace him without being seen.\"\n\n\"Ay; and raight wull a doo'd un,\" John cried, with his mouth in the\nbullock's horn.\n\n\"Well, and what did you see, John?\" I asked, with great anxiety; though\nI meant to have shown no interest.\n\n\"John was just at the very point of it,\" Lizzie answered me sharply,\n\"when you chose to come in and stop him.\"\n\n\"Then let him begin again,\" said I; \"things being gone so far, it is now\nmy duty to know everything, for the sake of you girls and mother.\"\n\n\"Hem!\" cried Lizzie, in a nasty way; but I took no notice of her, for\nshe was always bad to deal with. Therefore John Fry began again, being\nheartily glad to do so, that his story might get out of the tumble which\nall our talk had made in it. But as he could not tell a tale in\nthe manner of my Lorna (although he told it very well for those who\nunderstood him) I will take it from his mouth altogether, and state in\nbrief what happened.\n\nWhen John, upon his forest pony, which he had much ado to hold (its\nmouth being like a bucket), was come to the top of the long black combe,\ntwo miles or more from Plover's Barrows, and winding to the southward,\nhe stopped his little nag short of the crest, and got off and looked\nahead of him, from behind a tump of whortles. It was a long flat sweep\nof moorland over which he was gazing, with a few bogs here and there,\nand brushy places round them. Of course, John Fry, from his shepherd\nlife and reclaiming of strayed cattle, knew as well as need be where he\nwas, and the spread of the hills before him, although it was beyond our\nbeat, or, rather, I should say, beside it. Not but what we might have\ngrazed there had it been our pleasure, but that it was not worth our\nwhile, and scarcely worth Jasper Kebby's even; all the land being\ncropped (as one might say) with desolation. And nearly all our knowledge\nof it sprang from the unaccountable tricks of cows who have young calves\nwith them; at which time they have wild desire to get away from the\nsight of man, and keep calf and milk for one another, although it be\nin a barren land. At least, our cows have gotten this trick, and I have\nheard other people complain of it.\n\nJohn Fry, as I said, knew the place well enough, but he liked it none\nthe more for that, neither did any of our people; and, indeed, all\nthe neighbourhood of Thomshill and Larksborough, and most of all Black\nBarrow Down lay under grave imputation of having been enchanted with a\nvery evil spell. Moreover, it was known, though folk were loath to speak\nof it, even on a summer morning, that Squire Thom, who had been murdered\nthere, a century ago or more, had been seen by several shepherds, even\nin the middle day, walking with his severed head carried in his left\nhand, and his right arm lifted towards the sun.\n\nTherefore it was very bold in John (as I acknowledged) to venture across\nthat moor alone, even with a fast pony under him, and some whisky by\nhis side. And he would never have done so (of that I am quite certain),\neither for the sake of Annie's sweet face, or of the golden guinea,\nwhich the three maidens had subscribed to reward his skill and valour.\nBut the truth was that he could not resist his own great curiosity. For,\ncarefully spying across the moor, from behind the tuft of whortles, at\nfirst he could discover nothing having life and motion, except three or\nfour wild cattle roving in vain search for nourishment, and a diseased\nsheep banished hither, and some carrion crows keeping watch on her. But\nwhen John was taking his very last look, being only too glad to go\nhome again, and acknowledge himself baffled, he thought he saw a figure\nmoving in the farthest distance upon Black Barrow Down, scarcely a thing\nto be sure of yet, on account of the want of colour. But as he watched,\nthe figure passed between him and a naked cliff, and appeared to be a\nman on horseback, making his way very carefully, in fear of bogs and\nserpents. For all about there it is adders' ground, and large black\nserpents dwell in the marshes, and can swim as well as crawl.\n\nJohn knew that the man who was riding there could be none but Uncle\nReuben, for none of the Doones ever passed that way, and the shepherds\nwere afraid of it. And now it seemed an unkind place for an unarmed man\nto venture through, especially after an armed one who might not like\nto be spied upon, and must have some dark object in visiting such drear\nsolitudes. Nevertheless John Fry so ached with unbearable curiosity to\nknow what an old man, and a stranger, and a rich man, and a peaceable\ncould possibly be after in that mysterious manner. Moreover, John so\nthrobbed with hope to find some wealthy secret, that come what would of\nit he resolved to go to the end of the matter.\n\nTherefore he only waited awhile for fear of being discovered, till\nMaster Huckaback turned to the left and entered a little gully, whence\nhe could not survey the moor. Then John remounted and crossed the rough\nland and the stony places, and picked his way among the morasses as fast\nas ever he dared to go; until, in about half an hour, he drew nigh the\nentrance of the gully. And now it behoved him to be most wary; for Uncle\nBen might have stopped in there, either to rest his horse or having\nreached the end of his journey. And in either case, John had little\ndoubt that he himself would be pistolled, and nothing more ever heard\nof him. Therefore he made his pony come to the mouth of it sideways,\nand leaned over and peered in around the rocky corner, while the little\nhorse cropped at the briars.\n\nBut he soon perceived that the gully was empty, so far at least as its\ncourse was straight; and with that he hastened into it, though his heart\nwas not working easily. When he had traced the winding hollow for half\na mile or more, he saw that it forked, and one part led to the left up\na steep red bank, and the other to the right, being narrow and slightly\ntending downwards. Some yellow sand lay here and there between the\nstarving grasses, and this he examined narrowly for a trace of Master\nHuckaback.\n\nAt last he saw that, beyond all doubt, the man he was pursuing had taken\nthe course which led down hill; and down the hill he must follow him.\nAnd this John did with deep misgivings, and a hearty wish that he had\nnever started upon so perilous an errand. For now he knew not where he\nwas, and scarcely dared to ask himself, having heard of a horrible hole,\nsomewhere in this neighbourhood, called the Wizard's Slough. Therefore\nJohn rode down the slope, with sorrow, and great caution. And these grew\nmore as he went onward, and his pony reared against him, being scared,\nalthough a native of the roughest moorland. And John had just made up\nhis mind that God meant this for a warning, as the passage seemed darker\nand deeper, when suddenly he turned a corner, and saw a scene which\nstopped him.\n\nFor there was the Wizard's Slough itself, as black as death, and\nbubbling, with a few scant yellow reeds in a ring around it. Outside\nthese, bright water-grass of the liveliest green was creeping, tempting\nany unwary foot to step, and plunge, and founder. And on the marge\nwere blue campanula, sundew, and forget-me-not, such as no child could\nresist. On either side, the hill fell back, and the ground was\nbroken with tufts of rush, and flag, and mares-tail, and a few rough\nalder-trees overclogged with water. And not a bird was seen or heard,\nneither rail nor water-hen, wag-tail nor reed-warbler.\n\nOf this horrible quagmire, the worst upon all Exmoor, John had heard\nfrom his grandfather, and even from his mother, when they wanted to keep\nhim quiet; but his father had feared to speak of it to him, being a man\nof piety, and up to the tricks of the evil one. This made John the more\ndesirous to have a good look at it now, only with his girths well up,\nto turn away and flee at speed, if anything should happen. And now\nhe proved how well it is to be wary and wide-awake, even in lonesome\nplaces. For at the other side of the Slough, and a few land-yards beyond\nit, where the ground was less noisome, he had observed a felled tree\nlying over a great hole in the earth, with staves of wood, and slabs of\nstone, and some yellow gravel around it. But the flags of reeds around\nthe morass partly screened it from his eyes, and he could not make\nout the meaning of it, except that it meant no good, and probably was\nwitchcraft. Yet Dolly seemed not to be harmed by it, for there she was\nas large as life, tied to a stump not far beyond, and flipping the flies\naway with her tail.\n\nWhile John was trembling within himself, lest Dolly should get scent of\nhis pony, and neigh and reveal their presence, although she could not\nsee them, suddenly to his great amazement something white arose out of\nthe hole, under the brown trunk of the tree. Seeing this his blood went\nback within him, yet he was not able to turn and flee, but rooted his\nface in among the loose stones, and kept his quivering shoulders back,\nand prayed to God to protect him. However, the white thing itself was\nnot so very awful, being nothing more than a long-coned night-cap with a\ntassel on the top, such as criminals wear at hanging-time. But when John\nsaw a man's face under it, and a man's neck and shoulders slowly rising\nout of the pit, he could not doubt that this was the place where the\nmurderers come to life again, according to the Exmoor story. He knew\nthat a man had been hanged last week, and that this was the ninth day\nafter it.\n\nTherefore he could bear no more, thoroughly brave as he had been,\nneither did he wait to see what became of the gallows-man; but climbed\non his horse with what speed he might, and rode away at full gallop.\nNeither did he dare go back by the way he came, fearing to face Black\nBarrow Down! therefore he struck up the other track leading away towards\nCloven Rocks, and after riding hard for an hour and drinking all\nhis whisky, he luckily fell in with a shepherd, who led him on to a\npublic-house somewhere near Exeford. And here he was so unmanned, the\nexcitement being over, that nothing less than a gallon of ale and half\na gammon of bacon, brought him to his right mind again. And he took good\ncare to be home before dark, having followed a well-known sheep track.\n\nWhen John Fry finished his story at last, after many exclamations from\nAnnie, and from Lizzie, and much praise of his gallantry, yet some\nlittle disappointment that he had not stayed there a little longer,\nwhile he was about it, so as to be able to tell us more, I said to him\nvery sternly,--\n\n\"Now, John, you have dreamed half this, my man. I firmly believe that\nyou fell asleep at the top of the black combe, after drinking all your\nwhisky, and never went on the moor at all. You know what a liar you are,\nJohn.\"\n\nThe girls were exceedingly angry at this, and laid their hands before\nmy mouth; but I waited for John to answer, with my eyes fixed upon him\nsteadfastly.\n\n\"Bain't for me to denai,\" said John, looking at me very honestly, \"but\nwhat a maight tull a lai, now and awhiles, zame as other men doth, and\nmost of arl them as spaks again it; but this here be no lai, Maister\nJan. I wush to God it wor, boy: a maight slape this naight the better.\"\n\n\"I believe you speak the truth, John; and I ask your pardon. Now not a\nword to any one, about this strange affair. There is mischief brewing, I\ncan see; and it is my place to attend to it. Several things come across\nme now--only I will not tell you.\"\n\nThey were not at all contented with this; but I would give them no\nbetter; except to say, when they plagued me greatly, and vowed to sleep\nat my door all night,--\n\n\"Now, my dears, this is foolish of you. Too much of this matter is known\nalready. It is for your own dear sakes that I am bound to be cautious.\nI have an opinion of my own; but it may be a very wrong one; I will not\nask you to share it with me; neither will I make you inquisitive.\"\n\nAnnie pouted, and Lizzie frowned, and Ruth looked at me with her eyes\nwide open, but no other mark of regarding me. And I saw that if any one\nof the three (for John Fry was gone home with the trembles) could be\ntrusted to keep a secret, that one was Ruth Huckaback.\n\n[Illustration: 267.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nFEEDING OF THE PIGS\n\n[Illustration: 268.jpg Charles II.]\n\nThe story told by John Fry that night, and my conviction of its truth,\nmade me very uneasy, especially as following upon the warning of Judge\nJeffreys, and the hints received from Jeremy Stickles, and the outburst\nof the tanner at Dunster, as well as sundry tales and rumours, and signs\nof secret understanding, seen and heard on market-days, and at places of\nentertainment. We knew for certain that at Taunton, Bridgwater, and even\nDulverton, there was much disaffection towards the King, and regret for\nthe days of the Puritans. Albeit I had told the truth, and the pure and\nsimple truth, when, upon my examination, I had assured his lordship,\nthat to the best of my knowledge there was nothing of the sort with us.\n\nBut now I was beginning to doubt whether I might not have been mistaken;\nespecially when we heard, as we did, of arms being landed at Lynmouth,\nin the dead of the night, and of the tramp of men having reached some\none's ears, from a hill where a famous echo was. For it must be plain to\nany conspirator (without the example of the Doones) that for the secret\nmuster of men and the stowing of unlawful arms, and communication by\nbeacon lights, scarcely a fitter place could be found than the wilds\nof Exmoor, with deep ravines running far inland from an unwatched and\nmostly a sheltered sea. For the Channel from Countisbury Foreland up\nto Minehead, or even farther, though rocky, and gusty, and full of\ncurrents, is safe from great rollers and the sweeping power of the\nsouth-west storms, which prevail with us more than all the others, and\nmake sad work on the opposite coast.\n\nBut even supposing it probable that something against King Charles\nthe Second (or rather against his Roman advisers, and especially his\nbrother) were now in preparation amongst us, was it likely that Master\nHuckaback, a wealthy man, and a careful one, known moreover to the Lord\nChief Justice, would have anything to do with it? To this I could\nmake no answer; Uncle Ben was so close a man, so avaricious, and so\nrevengeful, that it was quite impossible to say what course he\nmight pursue, without knowing all the chances of gain, or rise, or\nsatisfaction to him. That he hated the Papists I knew full well, though\nhe never spoke much about them; also that he had followed the march of\nOliver Cromwell's army, but more as a suttler (people said) than as a\nreal soldier; and that he would go a long way, and risk a great deal\nof money, to have his revenge on the Doones; although their name never\npassed his lips during the present visit.\n\nBut how was it likely to be as to the Doones themselves? Which side\nwould they probably take in the coming movement, if movement indeed it\nwould be? So far as they had any religion at all, by birth they were\nRoman Catholics--so much I knew from Lorna; and indeed it was well known\nall around, that a priest had been fetched more than once to the valley,\nto soothe some poor outlaw's departure. On the other hand, they were\nnot likely to entertain much affection for the son of the man who had\nbanished them and confiscated their property. And it was not at all\nimpossible that desperate men, such as they were, having nothing to\nlose, but estates to recover, and not being held by religion much,\nshould cast away all regard for the birth from which they had been cast\nout, and make common cause with a Protestant rising, for the chance of\nrevenge and replacement.\n\nHowever I do not mean to say that all these things occurred to me as\nclearly as I have set them down; only that I was in general doubt, and\nvery sad perplexity. For mother was so warm, and innocent, and kind\nso to every one, that knowing some little by this time of the English\nconstitution, I feared very greatly lest she should be punished for\nharbouring malcontents. As well as possible I knew, that if any poor man\ncame to our door, and cried, \"Officers are after me; for God's sake take\nand hide me,\" mother would take him in at once, and conceal, and feed\nhim, even though he had been very violent; and, to tell the truth, so\nwould both my sisters, and so indeed would I do. Whence it will be clear\nthat we were not the sort of people to be safe among disturbances.\n\nBefore I could quite make up my mind how to act in this difficulty, and\nhow to get at the rights of it (for I would not spy after Uncle Reuben,\nthough I felt no great fear of the Wizard's Slough, and none of the man\nwith the white night-cap), a difference came again upon it, and a change\nof chances. For Uncle Ben went away as suddenly as he first had come to\nus, giving no reason for his departure, neither claiming the pony, and\nindeed leaving something behind him of great value to my mother. For\nhe begged her to see to his young grand-daughter, until he could find\nopportunity of fetching her safely to Dulverton. Mother was overjoyed\nat this, as she could not help displaying; and Ruth was quite as much\ndelighted, although she durst not show it. For at Dulverton she had\nto watch and keep such ward on the victuals, and the in and out of the\nshopmen, that it went entirely against her heart, and she never could\nenjoy herself. Truly she was an altered girl from the day she came to\nus; catching our unsuspicious manners, and our free goodwill, and hearty\nnoise of laughing.\n\n[Illustration: 271.jpg Thatching of the ricks]\n\nBy this time, the harvest being done, and the thatching of the ricks\nmade sure against south-western tempests, and all the reapers being\ngone, with good money and thankfulness, I began to burn in spirit for\nthe sight of Lorna. I had begged my sister Annie to let Sally Snowe\nknow, once for all, that it was not in my power to have any thing more\nto do with her. Of course our Annie was not to grieve Sally, neither to\nlet it appear for a moment that I suspected her kind views upon me, and\nher strong regard for our dairy: only I thought it right upon our part\nnot to waste Sally's time any longer, being a handsome wench as she was,\nand many young fellows glad to marry her.\n\nAnd Annie did this uncommonly well, as she herself told me afterwards,\nhaving taken Sally in the sweetest manner into her pure confidence, and\nopened half her bosom to her, about my very sad love affair. Not that\nshe let Sally know, of course, who it was, or what it was; only that she\nmade her understand, without hinting at any desire of it, that there was\nno chance now of having me. Sally changed colour a little at this, and\nthen went on about a red cow which had passed seven needles at milking\ntime.\n\nInasmuch as there are two sorts of month well recognised by the\ncalendar, to wit the lunar and the solar, I made bold to regard both\nmy months, in the absence of any provision, as intended to be strictly\nlunar. Therefore upon the very day when the eight weeks were expiring\nforth I went in search of Lorna, taking the pearl ring hopefully, and\nall the new-laid eggs I could find, and a dozen and a half of small\ntrout from our brook. And the pleasure it gave me to catch those trout,\nthinking as every one came forth and danced upon the grass, how much\nshe would enjoy him, is more than I can now describe, although I well\nremember it. And it struck me that after accepting my ring, and saying\nhow much she loved me, it was possible that my Queen might invite\nme even to stay and sup with her: and so I arranged with dear Annie\nbeforehand, who was now the greatest comfort to me, to account for my\nabsence if I should be late.\n\nBut alas, I was utterly disappointed; for although I waited and waited\nfor hours, with an equal amount both of patience and peril, no Lorna\never appeared at all, nor even the faintest sign of her. And another\nthing occurred as well, which vexed me more than it need have done, for\nso small a matter. And this was that my little offering of the trout\nand the new-laid eggs was carried off in the coolest manner by that vile\nCarver Doone. For thinking to keep them the fresher and nicer, away from\nso much handling, I laid them in a little bed of reeds by the side of\nthe water, and placed some dog-leaves over them. And when I had quite\nforgotten about them, and was watching from my hiding-place beneath\nthe willow-tree (for I liked not to enter Lorna's bower, without her\npermission; except just to peep that she was not there), and while I was\nturning the ring in my pocket, having just seen the new moon, I\nbecame aware of a great man coming leisurely down the valley. He had a\nbroad-brimmed hat, and a leather jerkin, and heavy jack-boots to his\nmiddle thigh, and what was worst of all for me, on his shoulder he bore\na long carbine. Having nothing to meet him withal but my staff, and\ndesiring to avoid disturbance, I retired promptly into the chasm,\nkeeping the tree betwixt us that he might not descry me, and watching\nfrom behind the jut of a rock, where now I had scraped myself a neat\nlittle hole for the purpose.\n\nPresently the great man reappeared, being now within fifty yards of me,\nand the light still good enough, as he drew nearer for me to descry\nhis features: and though I am not a judge of men's faces, there was\nsomething in his which turned me cold, as though with a kind of horror.\nNot that it was an ugly face; nay, rather it seemed a handsome one, so\nfar as mere form and line might go, full of strength, and vigour, and\nwill, and steadfast resolution. From the short black hair above the\nbroad forehead, to the long black beard descending below the curt, bold\nchin, there was not any curve or glimpse of weakness or of afterthought.\nNothing playful, nothing pleasant, nothing with a track of smiles;\nnothing which a friend could like, and laugh at him for having. And\nyet he might have been a good man (for I have known very good men so\nfortified by their own strange ideas of God): I say that he might\nhave seemed a good man, but for the cold and cruel hankering of his\nsteel-blue eyes.\n\nNow let no one suppose for a minute that I saw all this in a moment; for\nI am very slow, and take a long time to digest things; only I like to\nset down, and have done with it, all the results of my knowledge, though\nthey be not manifold. But what I said to myself, just then, was no more\nthan this: \"What a fellow to have Lorna!\" Having my sense of right so\noutraged (although, of course, I would never allow her to go so far as\nthat), I almost longed that he might thrust his head in to look after\nme. For there I was, with my ash staff clubbed, ready to have at him,\nand not ill inclined to do so; if only he would come where strength, not\nfirearms, must decide it. However, he suspected nothing of my dangerous\nneighbourhood, but walked his round like a sentinel, and turned at the\nbrink of the water.\n\nThen as he marched back again, along the margin of the stream, he espied\nmy little hoard, covered up with dog-leaves. He saw that the leaves were\nupside down, and this of course drew his attention. I saw him stoop,\nand lay bare the fish, and the eggs set a little way from them and in\nmy simple heart, I thought that now he knew all about me. But to my\nsurprise, he seemed well-pleased; and his harsh short laughter came to\nme without echo,--\n\n\"Ha, ha! Charlie boy! Fisherman Charlie, have I caught thee setting\nbait for Lorna? Now, I understand thy fishings, and the robbing of\nCounsellor's hen roost. May I never have good roasting, if I have it not\nto-night and roast thee, Charlie, afterwards!\"\n\n[Illustration: 274.jpg Ha, Ha! Charlie boy]\n\nWith this he calmly packed up my fish, and all the best of dear Annie's\neggs; and went away chuckling steadfastly, to his home, if one may\ncall it so. But I was so thoroughly grieved and mortified by this most\nimpudent robbery, that I started forth from my rocky screen with the\nintention of pursuing him, until my better sense arrested me, barely\nin time to escape his eyes. For I said to myself, that even supposing\nI could contend unarmed with him, it would be the greatest folly in the\nworld to have my secret access known, and perhaps a fatal barrier placed\nbetween Lorna and myself, and I knew not what trouble brought upon her,\nall for the sake of a few eggs and fishes. It was better to bear this\ntrifling loss, however ignominious and goading to the spirit, than to\nrisk my love and Lorna's welfare, and perhaps be shot into the bargain.\nAnd I think that all will agree with me, that I acted for the wisest, in\nwithdrawing to my shelter, though deprived of eggs and fishes.\n\nHaving waited (as I said) until there was no chance whatever of my love\nappearing, I hastened homeward very sadly; and the wind of early autumn\nmoaned across the moorland. All the beauty of the harvest, all the\ngaiety was gone, and the early fall of dusk was like a weight upon\nme. Nevertheless, I went every evening thenceforward for a fortnight;\nhoping, every time in vain to find my hope and comfort. And meanwhile,\nwhat perplexed me most was that the signals were replaced, in order as\nagreed upon, so that Lorna could scarcely be restrained by any rigour.\n\nOne time I had a narrow chance of being shot and settled with; and\nit befell me thus. I was waiting very carelessly, being now a little\ndesperate, at the entrance to the glen, instead of watching through my\nsight-hole, as the proper practice was. Suddenly a ball went by me, with\na whizz and whistle, passing through my hat and sweeping it away all\nfolded up. My soft hat fluttered far down the stream, before I had time\nto go after it, and with the help of both wind and water, was fifty\nyards gone in a moment. At this I had just enough mind left to shrink\nback very suddenly, and lurk very still and closely; for I knew what\na narrow escape it had been, as I heard the bullet, hard set by the\npowder, sing mournfully down the chasm, like a drone banished out of the\nhive. And as I peered through my little cranny, I saw a wreath of smoke\nstill floating where the thickness was of the withy-bed; and presently\nCarver Doone came forth, having stopped to reload his piece perhaps, and\nran very swiftly to the entrance to see what he had shot.\n\nSore trouble had I to keep close quarters, from the slipperiness of the\nstone beneath me with the water sliding over it. My foe came quite to\nthe verge of the fall, where the river began to comb over; and there he\nstopped for a minute or two, on the utmost edge of dry land, upon the\nvery spot indeed where I had fallen senseless when I clomb it in my\nboyhood. I could hear him breathing hard and grunting, as in doubt and\ndiscontent, for he stood within a yard of me, and I kept my right\nfist ready for him, if he should discover me. Then at the foot of the\nwaterslide, my black hat suddenly appeared, tossing in white foam, and\nfluttering like a raven wounded. Now I had doubted which hat to take,\nwhen I left home that day; till I thought that the black became me best,\nand might seem kinder to Lorna.\n\n\"Have I killed thee, old bird, at last?\" my enemy cried in triumph;\n\"'tis the third time I have shot at thee, and thou wast beginning to\nmock me. No more of thy cursed croaking now, to wake me in the morning.\nHa, ha! there are not many who get three chances from Carver Doone; and\nnone ever go beyond it.\"\n\nI laughed within myself at this, as he strode away in his triumph; for\nwas not this his third chance of me, and he no whit the wiser? And then\nI thought that perhaps the chance might some day be on the other side.\n\nFor to tell the truth, I was heartily tired of lurking and playing\nbo-peep so long; to which nothing could have reconciled me, except\nmy fear for Lorna. And here I saw was a man of strength fit for me to\nencounter, such as I had never met, but would be glad to meet with;\nhaving found no man of late who needed not my mercy at wrestling, or at\nsingle-stick. And growing more and more uneasy, as I found no Lorna, I\nwould have tried to force the Doone Glen from the upper end, and take my\nchance of getting back, but for Annie and her prayers.\n\nNow that same night I think it was, or at any rate the next one, that I\nnoticed Betty Muxworthy going on most strangely. She made the queerest\nsigns to me, when nobody was looking, and laid her fingers on her lips,\nand pointed over her shoulder. But I took little heed of her, being in\na kind of dudgeon, and oppressed with evil luck; believing too that all\nshe wanted was to have some little grumble about some petty grievance.\n\nBut presently she poked me with the heel of a fire-bundle, and passing\nclose to my ear whispered, so that none else could hear her, \"Larna\nDoo-un.\"\n\nBy these words I was so startled, that I turned round and stared at her;\nbut she pretended not to know it, and began with all her might to scour\nan empty crock with a besom.\n\n\"Oh, Betty, let me help you! That work is much too hard for you,\" I\ncried with a sudden chivalry, which only won rude answer.\n\n\"Zeed me adooing of thic, every naight last ten year, Jan, wiout vindin'\nout how hard it wor. But if zo bee thee wants to help, carr peg's bucket\nfor me. Massy, if I ain't forgotten to fade the pegs till now.\"\n\nFavouring me with another wink, to which I now paid the keenest heed,\nBetty went and fetched the lanthorn from the hook inside the door. Then\nwhen she had kindled it, not allowing me any time to ask what she was\nafter, she went outside, and pointed to the great bock of wash, and\nriddlings, and brown hulkage (for we ground our own corn always), and\nthough she knew that Bill Dadds and Jem Slocombe had full work to carry\nit on a pole (with another to help to sling it), she said to me as\nquietly as a maiden might ask one to carry a glove, \"Jan Ridd, carr thic\nthing for me.\"\n\nSo I carried it for her, without any words; wondering what she was up\nto next, and whether she had ever heard of being too hard on the willing\nhorse. And when we came to hog-pound, she turned upon me suddenly, with\nthe lanthorn she was bearing, and saw that I had the bock by one hand\nvery easily.\n\n\"Jan Ridd,\" she said, \"there be no other man in England cud a' dood it.\nNow thee shalt have Larna.\"\n\n[Illustration: 277.jpg The Pigs]\n\nWhile I was wondering how my chance of having Lorna could depend upon\nmy power to carry pig's wash, and how Betty could have any voice in the\nmatter (which seemed to depend upon her decision), and in short, while\nI was all abroad as to her knowledge and everything, the pigs, who had\nbeen fast asleep and dreaming in their emptiness, awoke with one accord\nat the goodness of the smell around them. They had resigned themselves,\nas even pigs do, to a kind of fast, hoping to break their fast more\nsweetly on the morrow morning. But now they tumbled out all headlong,\npigs below and pigs above, pigs point-blank and pigs across, pigs\ncourant and pigs rampant, but all alike prepared to eat, and all in good\ncadence squeaking.\n\n\"Tak smarl boocket, and bale un out; wad 'e waste sich stoof as thic\nhere be?\" So Betty set me to feed the pigs, while she held the lanthorn;\nand knowing what she was, I saw that she would not tell me another word\nuntil all the pigs were served. And in truth no man could well look at\nthem, and delay to serve them, they were all expressing appetite in so\nforcible a manner; some running to and fro, and rubbing, and squealing\nas if from starvation, some rushing down to the oaken troughs, and\npoking each other away from them; and the kindest of all putting up\ntheir fore-feet on the top-rail on the hog-pound, and blinking their\nlittle eyes, and grunting prettily to coax us; as who would say, \"I\ntrust you now; you will be kind, I know, and give me the first and the\nvery best of it.\"\n\n\"Oppen ge-at now, wull 'e, Jan? Maind, young sow wi' the baible back\narlway hath first toorn of it, 'cos I brought her up on my lap, I did.\nZuck, zuck, zuck! How her stickth her tail up; do me good to zee un! Now\nthiccy trough, thee zany, and tak thee girt legs out o' the wai. Wish\nthey wud gie thee a good baite, mak thee hop a bit vaster, I reckon. Hit\nthat there girt ozebird over's back wi' the broomstick, he be robbing\nof my young zow. Choog, choog, choog! and a drap more left in the\ndripping-pail.\"\n\n\"Come now, Betty,\" I said, when all the pigs were at it sucking,\nswilling, munching, guzzling, thrusting, and ousting, and spilling\nthe food upon the backs of their brethren (as great men do with their\ncharity), \"come now, Betty, how much longer am I to wait for your\nmessage? Surely I am as good as a pig.\"\n\n\"Dunno as thee be, Jan. No straikiness in thy bakkon. And now I come to\nthink of it, Jan, thee zed, a wake agone last Vriday, as how I had got a\ngirt be-ard. Wull 'e stick to that now, Maister Jan?\"\n\n\"No, no, Betty, certainly not; I made a mistake about it. I should have\nsaid a becoming mustachio, such as you may well be proud of.\"\n\n\"Then thee be a laiar, Jan Ridd. Zay so, laike a man, lad.\"\n\n\"Not exactly that, Betty; but I made a great mistake; and I humbly ask\nyour pardon; and if such a thing as a crown-piece, Betty\"--\n\n\"No fai, no fai!\" said Betty, however she put it into her pocket; \"now\ntak my advice, Jan; thee marry Zally Snowe.\"\n\n\"Not with all England for her dowry. Oh, Betty, you know better.\"\n\n\"Ah's me! I know much worse, Jan. Break thy poor mother's heart it will.\nAnd to think of arl the danger! Dost love Larna now so much?\"\n\n\"With all the strength of my heart and soul. I will have her, or I will\ndie, Betty.\"\n\n\"Wull. Thee will die in either case. But it baint for me to argify. And\ndo her love thee too, Jan?\"\n\n\"I hope she does, Betty I hope she does. What do you think about it?\"\n\n\"Ah, then I may hold my tongue to it. Knaw what boys and maidens be, as\nwell as I knew young pegs. I myzell been o' that zort one taime every\nbit so well as you be.\" And Betty held the lanthorn up, and defied me to\ndeny it; and the light through the horn showed a gleam in her eyes, such\nas I had never seer there before. \"No odds, no odds about that,\"\nshe continued; \"mak a fool of myzell to spake of it. Arl gone into\nchurchyard. But it be a lucky foolery for thee, my boy, I can tull 'ee.\nFor I love to see the love in thee. Coom'th over me as the spring do,\nthough I be naigh three score. Now, Jan, I will tell thee one thing,\ncan't abear to zee thee vretting so. Hould thee head down, same as they\npegs do.\"\n\nSo I bent my head quite close to her; and she whispered in my ear, \"Goo\nof a marning, thee girt soft. Her can't get out of an avening now, her\nhath zent word to me, to tull 'ee.\"\n\nIn the glory of my delight at this, I bestowed upon Betty a chaste\nsalute, with all the pigs for witnesses; and she took it not amiss,\nconsidering how long she had been out of practice. But then she fell\nback, like a broom on its handle, and stared at me, feigning anger.\n\n\"Oh fai, oh fai! Lunnon impudence, I doubt. I vear thee hast gone on\nzadly, Jan.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nAN EARLY MORNING CALL\n\n[Illustration: 280.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nOf course I was up the very next morning before the October sunrise, and\naway through the wild and the woodland towards the Bagworthy water, at\nthe foot of the long cascade. The rising of the sun was noble in the\ncold and warmth of it; peeping down the spread of light, he raised his\nshoulder heavily over the edge of grey mountain, and wavering length of\nupland. Beneath his gaze the dew-fogs dipped, and crept to the hollow\nplaces; then stole away in line and column, holding skirts, and clinging\nsubtly at the sheltering corners, where rock hung over grass-land; while\nthe brave lines of the hills came forth, one beyond other gliding.\n\nThen the woods arose in folds, like drapery of awakened mountains,\nstately with a depth of awe, and memory of the tempests. Autumn's mellow\nhand was on them, as they owned already, touched with gold, and red,\nand olive; and their joy towards the sun was less to a bridegroom than a\nfather.\n\n[Illustration: 281.jpg Autumn's mellow hand]\n\nYet before the floating impress of the woods could clear itself,\nsuddenly the gladsome light leaped over hill and valley, casting amber,\nblue, and purple, and a tint of rich red rose; according to the scene\nthey lit on, and the curtain flung around; yet all alike dispelling fear\nand the cloven hoof of darkness, all on the wings of hope advancing,\nand proclaiming, \"God is here.\" Then life and joy sprang reassured\nfrom every crouching hollow; every flower, and bud, and bird, had a\nfluttering sense of them; and all the flashing of God's gaze merged into\nsoft beneficence.\n\nSo perhaps shall break upon us that eternal morning, when crag and chasm\nshall be no more, neither hill and valley, nor great unvintaged ocean;\nwhen glory shall not scare happiness, neither happiness envy glory;\nbut all things shall arise and shine in the light of the Father's\ncountenance, because itself is risen.\n\nWho maketh His sun to rise upon both the just and the unjust. And surely\nbut for the saving clause, Doone Glen had been in darkness. Now, as I\nstood with scanty breath--for few men could have won that climb--at\nthe top of the long defile, and the bottom of the mountain gorge all of\nmyself, and the pain of it, and the cark of my discontent fell away\ninto wonder and rapture. For I cannot help seeing things now and then,\nslow-witted as I have a right to be; and perhaps because it comes so\nrarely, the sight dwells with me like a picture.\n\nThe bar of rock, with the water-cleft breaking steeply through it, stood\nbold and bare, and dark in shadow, grey with red gullies down it. But\nthe sun was beginning to glisten over the comb of the eastern highland,\nand through an archway of the wood hung with old nests and ivy. The\nlines of many a leaning tree were thrown, from the cliffs of the\nforeland, down upon the sparkling grass at the foot of the western\ncrags. And through the dewy meadow's breast, fringed with shade, but\ntouched on one side with the sun-smile, ran the crystal water, curving\nin its brightness like diverted hope.\n\nOn either bank, the blades of grass, making their last autumn growth,\npricked their spears and crisped their tuftings with the pearly purity.\nThe tenderness of their green appeared under the glaucous mantle; while\nthat grey suffusion, which is the blush of green life, spread its damask\nchastity. Even then my soul was lifted, worried though my mind was: who\ncan see such large kind doings, and not be ashamed of human grief?\n\nNot only unashamed of grief, but much abashed with joy, was I, when\nI saw my Lorna coming, purer than the morning dew, than the sun more\nbright and clear. That which made me love her so, that which lifted my\nheart to her, as the Spring wind lifts the clouds, was the gayness of\nher nature, and its inborn playfulness. And yet all this with maiden\nshame, a conscious dream of things unknown, and a sense of fate about\nthem.\n\nDown the valley still she came, not witting that I looked at her, having\nceased (through my own misprison) to expect me yet awhile; or at least\nshe told herself so. In the joy of awakened life and brightness of\nthe morning, she had cast all care away, and seemed to float upon the\nsunrise, like a buoyant silver wave. Suddenly at sight of me, for I\nleaped forth at once, in fear of seeming to watch her unawares, the\nbloom upon her cheeks was deepened, and the radiance of her eyes; and\nshe came to meet me gladly.\n\n\"At last then, you are come, John. I thought you had forgotten me. I\ncould not make you understand--they have kept me prisoner every evening:\nbut come into my house; you are in danger here.\"\n\n[Illustration: 283.jpg At last then, you are come John]\n\nMeanwhile I could not answer, being overcome with joy, but followed\nto her little grotto, where I had been twice before. I knew that the\ncrowning moment of my life was coming--that Lorna would own her love for\nme.\n\nShe made for awhile as if she dreamed not of the meaning of my gaze,\nbut tried to speak of other things, faltering now and then, and mantling\nwith a richer damask below her long eyelashes.\n\n\"This is not what I came to know,\" I whispered very softly, \"you know\nwhat I am come to ask.\"\n\n\"If you are come on purpose to ask anything, why do you delay so?\" She\nturned away very bravely, but I saw that her lips were trembling.\n\n\"I delay so long, because I fear; because my whole life hangs in balance\non a single word; because what I have near me now may never more be near\nme after, though more than all the world, or than a thousand worlds,\nto me.\" As I spoke these words of passion in a low soft voice, Lorna\ntrembled more and more; but she made no answer, neither yet looked up at\nme.\n\n\"I have loved you long and long,\" I pursued, being reckless now, \"when\nyou were a little child, as a boy I worshipped you: then when I saw\nyou a comely girl, as a stripling I adored you: now that you are a\nfull-grown maiden all the rest I do, and more--I love you more than\ntongue can tell, or heart can hold in silence. I have waited long and\nlong; and though I am so far below you I can wait no longer; but must\nhave my answer.\"\n\n\"You have been very faithful, John,\" she murmured to the fern and moss;\n\"I suppose I must reward you.\"\n\n\"That will not do for me,\" I said; \"I will not have reluctant liking,\nnor assent for pity's sake; which only means endurance. I must have all\nlove, or none, I must have your heart of hearts; even as you have mine,\nLorna.\"\n\nWhile I spoke, she glanced up shyly through her fluttering lashes,\nto prolong my doubt one moment, for her own delicious pride. Then she\nopened wide upon me all the glorious depth and softness of her loving\neyes, and flung both arms around my neck, and answered with her heart on\nmine,--\n\n\"Darling, you have won it all. I shall never be my own again. I am\nyours, my own one, for ever and for ever.\"\n\nI am sure I know not what I did, or what I said thereafter, being\novercome with transport by her words and at her gaze. Only one thing I\nremember, when she raised her bright lips to me, like a child, for me to\nkiss, such a smile of sweet temptation met me through her flowing hair,\nthat I almost forgot my manners, giving her no time to breathe.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Lorna gently, but violently blushing; \"for the\npresent that will do, John. And now remember one thing, dear. All the\nkindness is to be on my side; and you are to be very distant, as behoves\nto a young maiden; except when I invite you. But you may kiss my hand,\nJohn; oh, yes, you may kiss my hand, you know. Ah to be sure! I had\nforgotten; how very stupid of me!\"\n\nFor by this time I had taken one sweet hand and gazed on it, with the\npride of all the world to think that such a lovely thing was mine; and\nthen I slipped my little ring upon the wedding finger; and this time\nLorna kept it, and looked with fondness on its beauty, and clung to me\nwith a flood of tears.\n\n\"Every time you cry,\" said I, drawing her closer to me \"I shall consider\nit an invitation not to be too distant. There now, none shall make you\nweep. Darling, you shall sigh no more, but live in peace and happiness,\nwith me to guard and cherish you: and who shall dare to vex you?\" But\nshe drew a long sad sigh, and looked at the ground with the great tears\nrolling, and pressed one hand upon the trouble of her pure young breast.\n\n\"It can never, never be,\" she murmured to herself alone: \"Who am I, to\ndream of it? Something in my heart tells me it can be so never, never.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTWO NEGATIVES MAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE\n\n[Illustration: 286.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThere was, however, no possibility of depressing me at such a time. To\nbe loved by Lorna, the sweet, the pure, the playful one, the fairest\ncreature on God's earth and the most enchanting, the lady of high birth\nand mind; that I, a mere clumsy, blundering yeoman, without wit, or\nwealth, or lineage, should have won that loving heart to be my own for\never, was a thought no fears could lessen, and no chance could steal\nfrom me.\n\nTherefore at her own entreaty taking a very quick adieu, and by her own\ninvitation an exceeding kind one, I hurried home with deep exulting, yet\nsome sad misgivings, for Lorna had made me promise now to tell my mother\neverything; as indeed I always meant to do, when my suit should be gone\ntoo far to stop. I knew, of course, that my dear mother would be greatly\nmoved and vexed, the heirship of Glen Doone not being a very desirable\ndower, but in spite of that, and all disappointment as to little Ruth\nHuckaback, feeling my mother's tenderness and deep affection to me, and\nforgiving nature, I doubted not that before very long she would view the\nmatter as I did. Moreover, I felt that if once I could get her only to\nlook at Lorna, she would so love and glory in her, that I should obtain\nall praise and thanks, perchance without deserving them.\n\nUnluckily for my designs, who should be sitting down at breakfast with\nmy mother and the rest but Squire Faggus, as everybody now began to\nentitle him. I noticed something odd about him, something uncomfortable\nin his manner, and a lack of that ease and humour which had been wont to\ndistinguish him. He took his breakfast as it came, without a single\njoke about it, or preference of this to that; but with sly soft looks\nat Annie, who seemed unable to sit quiet, or to look at any one\nsteadfastly. I feared in my heart what was coming on, and felt truly\nsorry for poor mother. After breakfast it became my duty to see to the\nploughing of a barley-stubble ready for the sowing of a French grass,\nand I asked Tom Faggus to come with me, but he refused, and I knew the\nreason. Being resolved to allow him fair field to himself, though with\ngreat displeasure that a man of such illegal repute should marry into\nour family, which had always been counted so honest, I carried my dinner\nupon my back, and spent the whole day with the furrows.\n\nWhen I returned, Squire Faggus was gone; which appeared to me but\na sorry sign, inasmuch as if mother had taken kindly to him and his\nintentions, she would surely have made him remain awhile to celebrate\nthe occasion. And presently no doubt was left: for Lizzie came running\nto meet me, at the bottom of the woodrick, and cried,--\n\n\"Oh, John, there is such a business. Mother is in such a state of mind,\nand Annie crying her eyes out. What do you think? You would never guess,\nthough I have suspected it, ever so long.\"\n\n\"No need for me to guess,\" I replied, as though with some indifference,\nbecause of her self-important air; \"I knew all about it long ago. You\nhave not been crying much, I see. I should like you better if you had.\"\n\n\"Why should I cry? I like Tom Faggus. He is the only one I ever see with\nthe spirit of a man.\"\n\nThis was a cut, of course, at me. Mr. Faggus had won the goodwill of\nLizzie by his hatred of the Doones, and vows that if he could get a\ndozen men of any courage to join him, he would pull their stronghold\nabout their ears without any more ado. This malice of his seemed strange\nto me, as he had never suffered at their hands, so far at least as I\nknew; was it to be attributed to his jealousy of outlaws who excelled\nhim in his business? Not being good at repartee, I made no answer to\nLizzie, having found this course more irksome to her than the very best\ninvective: and so we entered the house together; and mother sent at once\nfor me, while I was trying to console my darling sister Annie.\n\n\"Oh, John! speak one good word for me,\" she cried with both hands laid\nin mine, and her tearful eyes looking up at me.\n\n\"Not one, my pet, but a hundred,\" I answered, kindly embracing her:\n\"have no fear, little sister: I am going to make your case so bright, by\ncomparison, I mean, that mother will send for you in five minutes, and\ncall you her best, her most dutiful child, and praise Cousin Tom to the\nskies, and send a man on horseback after him; and then you will have a\nharder task to intercede for me, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, John, dear John, you won't tell her about Lorna--oh, not to-day,\ndear.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-day, and at once, Annie. I want to have it over, and be done\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but think of her, dear. I am sure she could not bear it, after this\ngreat shock already.\"\n\n\"She will bear it all the better,\" said I; \"the one will drive the other\nout. I know exactly what mother is. She will be desperately savage first\nwith you, and then with me, and then for a very little while with both\nof us together; and then she will put one against the other (in her mind\nI mean) and consider which was most to blame; and in doing that she will\nbe compelled to find the best in either's case, that it may beat the\nother; and so as the pleas come before her mind, they will gain upon the\ncharges, both of us being her children, you know: and before very long\n(particularly if we both keep out of the way) she will begin to think\nthat after all she has been a little too hasty, and then she will\nremember how good we have always been to her; and how like our father.\nUpon that, she will think of her own love-time, and sigh a good bit,\nand cry a little, and then smile, and send for both of us, and beg our\npardon, and call us her two darlings.\"\n\n\"Now, John, how on earth can you know all that?\" exclaimed my sister,\nwiping her eyes, and gazing at me with a soft bright smile. \"Who on\nearth can have told you, John? People to call you stupid indeed! Why,\nI feel that all you say is quite true, because you describe so exactly\nwhat I should do myself; I mean--I mean if I had two children, who had\nbehaved as we have done. But tell me, darling John, how you learned all\nthis.\"\n\n\"Never you mind,\" I replied, with a nod of some conceit, I fear: \"I must\nbe a fool if I did not know what mother is by this time.\"\n\nNow inasmuch as the thing befell according to my prediction, what need\nfor me to dwell upon it, after saying how it would be? Moreover, I would\nregret to write down what mother said about Lorna, in her first surprise\nand tribulation; not only because I was grieved by the gross injustice\nof it, and frightened mother with her own words (repeated deeply after\nher); but rather because it is not well, when people repent of hasty\nspeech, to enter it against them.\n\nThat is said to be the angels' business; and I doubt if they can attend\nto it much, without doing injury to themselves.\n\nHowever, by the afternoon, when the sun began to go down upon us, our\nmother sat on the garden bench, with her head on my great otter-skin\nwaistcoat (which was waterproof), and her right arm round our Annie's\nwaist, and scarcely knowing which of us she ought to make the most of,\nor which deserved most pity. Not that she had forgiven yet the rivals to\nher love--Tom Faggus, I mean, and Lorna--but that she was beginning to\nthink a tattle better of them now, and a vast deal better of her own\nchildren.\n\nAnd it helped her much in this regard, that she was not thinking half\nso well as usual of herself, or rather of her own judgment; for in good\ntruth she had no self, only as it came home to her, by no very distant\nroad, but by way of her children. A better mother never lived; and can\nI, after searching all things, add another word to that?\n\nAnd indeed poor Lizzie was not so very bad; but behaved (on the whole)\nvery well for her. She was much to be pitied, poor thing, and great\nallowances made for her, as belonging to a well-grown family, and a very\ncomely one; and feeling her own shortcomings. This made her leap to the\nother extreme, and reassert herself too much, endeavouring to exalt the\nmind at the expense of the body; because she had the invisible one (so\nfar as can be decided) in better share than the visible. Not but what\nshe had her points, and very comely points of body; lovely eyes to wit,\nand very beautiful hands and feet (almost as good as Lorna's), and a\nneck as white as snow; but Lizzie was not gifted with our gait and port,\nand bounding health.\n\nNow, while we sat on the garden bench, under the great ash-tree, we left\ndear mother to take her own way, and talk at her own pleasure. Children\nalmost always are more wide-awake than their parents. The fathers and\nthe mothers laugh; but the young ones have the best of them. And now\nboth Annie knew, and I, that we had gotten the best of mother; and\ntherefore we let her lay down the law, as if we had been two dollies.\n\n[Illustration: 290.jpg Gotten the best of mother]\n\n\"Darling John,\" my mother said, \"your case is a very hard one. A young\nand very romantic girl--God send that I be right in my charitable\nview of her--has met an equally simple boy, among great dangers and\ndifficulties, from which my son has saved her, at the risk of his life\nat every step. Of course, she became attached to him, and looked up to\nhim in every way, as a superior being\"--\n\n\"Come now, mother,\" I said; \"if you only saw Lorna, you would look upon\nme as the lowest dirt\"--\n\n\"No doubt I should,\" my mother answered; \"and the king and queen, and\nall the royal family. Well, this poor angel, having made up her mind to\ntake compassion upon my son, when he had saved her life so many times,\npersuades him to marry her out of pure pity, and throw his poor mother\noverboard. And the saddest part of it all is this--\"\n\n\"That my mother will never, never, never understand the truth,\" said I.\n\n\"That is all I wish,\" she answered; \"just to get at the simple truth\nfrom my own perception of it. John, you are very wise in kissing me;\nbut perhaps you would not be so wise in bringing Lorna for an afternoon,\njust to see what she thinks of me. There is a good saddle of mutton now;\nand there are some very good sausages left, on the blue dish with the\nanchor, Annie, from the last little sow we killed.\"\n\n\"As if Lorna would eat sausages!\" said I, with appearance of high\ncontempt, though rejoicing all the while that mother seemed to have her\nname so pat; and she pronounced it in a manner which made my heart leap\nto my ears: \"Lorna to eat sausages!\"\n\n\"I don't see why she shouldn't,\" my mother answered smiling, \"if she\nmeans to be a farmer's wife, she must take to farmer's ways, I think.\nWhat do you say, Annie?\"\n\n\"She will eat whatever John desires, I should hope,\" said Annie gravely;\n\"particularly as I made them.\"\n\n\"Oh that I could only get the chance of trying her!\" I answered, \"if you\ncould once behold her, mother, you would never let her go again. And she\nwould love you with all her heart, she is so good and gentle.\"\n\n\"That is a lucky thing for me\"; saying this my mother wept, as she had\nbeen doing off and on, when no one seemed to look at her; \"otherwise I\nsuppose, John, she would very soon turn me out of the farm, having you\nso completely under her thumb, as she seems to have. I see now that my\ntime is over. Lizzie and I will seek our fortunes. It is wiser so.\"\n\n\"Now, mother,\" I cried; \"will you have the kindness not to talk any\nnonsense? Everything belongs to you; and so, I hope, your children do.\nAnd you, in turn, belong to us; as you have proved ever since--oh, ever\nsince we can remember. Why do you make Annie cry so? You ought to know\nbetter than that.\"\n\nMother upon this went over all the things she had done before; how many\ntimes I know not; neither does it matter. Only she seemed to enjoy it\nmore, every time of doing it. And then she said she was an old fool; and\nAnnie (like a thorough girl) pulled her one grey hair out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nRUTH IS NOT LIKE LORNA\n\n[Illustration: 292.jpg Carver Doone]\n\nAlthough by our mother's reluctant consent a large part of the obstacles\nbetween Annie and her lover appeared to be removed, on the other hand\nLorna and myself gained little, except as regarded comfort of mind, and\nsome ease to the conscience. Moreover, our chance of frequent meetings\nand delightful converse was much impaired, at least for the present;\nbecause though mother was not aware of my narrow escape from Carver\nDoone, she made me promise never to risk my life by needless visits.\nAnd upon this point, that is to say, the necessity of the visit, she was\nwell content, as she said, to leave me to my own good sense and honour;\nonly begging me always to tell her of my intention beforehand. This\npledge, however, for her own sake, I declined to give; knowing how\nwretched she would be during all the time of my absence; and, on that\naccount, I promised instead, that I would always give her a full account\nof my adventure upon returning.\n\nNow my mother, as might be expected, began at once to cast about for\nsome means of relieving me from all further peril, and herself from\ngreat anxiety. She was full of plans for fetching Lorna, in some\nwonderful manner, out of the power of the Doones entirely, and into her\nown hands, where she was to remain for at least a twelve-month, learning\nall mother and Annie could teach her of dairy business, and farm-house\nlife, and the best mode of packing butter. And all this arose from my\nhappening to say, without meaning anything, how the poor dear had longed\nfor quiet, and a life of simplicity, and a rest away from violence!\nBless thee, mother--now long in heaven, there is no need to bless thee;\nbut it often makes a dimness now in my well-worn eyes, when I think of\nthy loving-kindness, warmth, and romantic innocence.\n\nAs to stealing my beloved from that vile Glen Doone, the deed itself was\nnot impossible, nor beyond my daring; but in the first place would she\ncome, leaving her old grandfather to die without her tendence? And\neven if, through fear of Carver and that wicked Counsellor, she should\nconsent to fly, would it be possible to keep her without a regiment of\nsoldiers? Would not the Doones at once ride forth to scour the country\nfor their queen, and finding her (as they must do), burn our house, and\nmurder us, and carry her back triumphantly?\n\nAll this I laid before my mother, and to such effect that she\nacknowledged, with a sigh that nothing else remained for me (in the\npresent state of matters) except to keep a careful watch upon Lorna from\nsafe distance, observe the policy of the Doones, and wait for a tide in\ntheir affairs. Meanwhile I might even fall in love (as mother unwisely\nhinted) with a certain more peaceful heiress, although of inferior\nblood, who would be daily at my elbow. I am not sure but what dear\nmother herself would have been disappointed, had I proved myself so\nfickle; and my disdain and indignation at the mere suggestion did not so\nmuch displease her; for she only smiled and answered,--\n\n\"Well, it is not for me to say; God knows what is good for us. Likings\nwill not come to order; otherwise I should not be where I am this day.\nAnd of one thing I am rather glad; Uncle Reuben well deserves that his\npet scheme should miscarry. He who called my boy a coward, an ignoble\ncoward, because he would not join some crack-brained plan against the\nvalley which sheltered his beloved one! And all the time this dreadful\n'coward' risking his life daily there, without a word to any one! How\nglad I am that you will not have, for all her miserable money, that\nlittle dwarfish granddaughter of the insolent old miser!\"\n\nShe turned, and by her side was standing poor Ruth Huckaback herself,\nwhite, and sad, and looking steadily at my mother's face, which became\nas red as a plum while her breath deserted her.\n\n[Illustration: 294.jpg Poor Ruth Huckaback herself]\n\n\"If you please, madam,\" said the little maiden, with her large calm eyes\nunwavering, \"it is not my fault, but God Almighty's, that I am a little\ndwarfish creature. I knew not that you regarded me with so much contempt\non that account; neither have you told my grandfather, at least\nwithin my hearing, that he was an insolent old miser. When I return to\nDulverton, which I trust to do to-morrow (for it is too late to-day),\nI shall be careful not to tell him your opinion of him, lest I should\nthwart any schemes you may have upon his property. I thank you all for\nyour kindness to me, which has been very great, far more than a little\ndwarfish creature could, for her own sake, expect. I will only add for\nyour further guidance one more little truth. It is by no means certain\nthat my grandfather will settle any of his miserable money upon me. If\nI offend him, as I would in a moment, for the sake of a brave and\nstraightforward man\"--here she gave me a glance which I scarcely knew\nwhat to do with--\"my grandfather, upright as he is, would leave me\nwithout a shilling. And I often wish it were so. So many miseries come\nupon me from the miserable money--\" Here she broke down, and burst out\ncrying, and ran away with a faint good-bye; while we three looked at one\nanother, and felt that we had the worst of it.\n\n\"Impudent little dwarf!\" said my mother, recovering her breath after\never so long. \"Oh, John, how thankful you ought to be! What a life she\nwould have led you!\"\n\n\"Well, I am sure!\" said Annie, throwing her arms around poor mother:\n\"who could have thought that little atomy had such an outrageous spirit!\nFor my part I cannot think how she can have been sly enough to hide it\nin that crafty manner, that John might think her an angel!\"\n\n\"Well, for my part,\" I answered, laughing, \"I never admired Ruth\nHuckaback half, or a quarter so much before. She is rare stuff. I would\nhave been glad to have married her to-morrow, if I had never seen my\nLorna.\"\n\n\"And a nice nobody I should have been, in my own house!\" cried mother:\n\"I never can be thankful enough to darling Lorna for saving me. Did you\nsee how her eyes flashed?\"\n\n\"That I did; and very fine they were. Now nine maidens out of ten would\nhave feigned not to have heard one word that was said, and have borne\nblack malice in their hearts. Come, Annie, now, would not you have done\nso?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Annie, \"although of course I cannot tell, you know,\nJohn, that I should have been ashamed at hearing what was never meant\nfor me, and should have been almost as angry with myself as anybody.\"\n\n\"So you would,\" replied my mother; \"so any daughter of mine would have\ndone, instead of railing and reviling. However, I am very sorry that any\nwords of mine which the poor little thing chose to overhear should have\nmade her so forget herself. I shall beg her pardon before she goes, and\nI shall expect her to beg mine.\"\n\n\"That she will never do,\" said I; \"a more resolute little maiden never\nyet had right upon her side; although it was a mere accident. I might\nhave said the same thing myself, and she was hard upon you, mother\ndear.\"\n\nAfter this, we said no more, at least about that matter; and little\nRuth, the next morning, left us, in spite of all that we could do. She\nvowed an everlasting friendship to my younger sister Eliza; but she\nlooked at Annie with some resentment, when they said good-bye, for being\nso much taller. At any rate so Annie fancied, but she may have been\nquite wrong. I rode beside the little maid till far beyond Exeford, when\nall danger of the moor was past, and then I left her with John Fry, not\nwishing to be too particular, after all the talk about her money. She\nhad tears in her eyes when she bade me farewell, and she sent a kind\nmessage home to mother, and promised to come again at Christmas, if she\ncould win permission.\n\n[Illustration: 296.jpg She had tears in her eyes]\n\nUpon the whole, my opinion was that she had behaved uncommonly well for\na maid whose self-love was outraged, with spirit, I mean, and proper\npride; and yet with a great endeavour to forgive, which is, meseems, the\nhardest of all things to a woman, outside of her own family.\n\nAfter this, for another month, nothing worthy of notice happened, except\nof course that I found it needful, according to the strictest good sense\nand honour, to visit Lorna immediately after my discourse with mother,\nand to tell her all about it. My beauty gave me one sweet kiss with all\nher heart (as she always did, when she kissed at all), and I begged for\none more to take to our mother, and before leaving, I obtained it. It\nis not for me to tell all she said, even supposing (what is not likely)\nthat any one cared to know it, being more and more peculiar to ourselves\nand no one else. But one thing that she said was this, and I took good\ncare to carry it, word for word, to my mother and Annie:--\n\n\"I never can believe, dear John, that after all the crime and outrage\nwrought by my reckless family, it ever can be meant for me to settle\ndown to peace and comfort in a simple household. With all my heart I\nlong for home; any home, however dull and wearisome to those used to\nit, would seem a paradise to me, if only free from brawl and tumult,\nand such as I could call my own. But even if God would allow me this, in\nlieu of my wild inheritance, it is quite certain that the Doones never\ncan and never will.\"\n\nAgain, when I told her how my mother and Annie, as well as myself,\nlonged to have her at Plover's Barrows, and teach her all the quiet\nduties in which she was sure to take such delight, she only answered\nwith a bright blush, that while her grandfather was living she would\nnever leave him; and that even if she were free, certain ruin was all\nshe should bring to any house that received her, at least within the\nutmost reach of her amiable family. This was too plain to be denied,\nand seeing my dejection at it, she told me bravely that we must hope for\nbetter times, if possible, and asked how long I would wait for her.\n\n\"Not a day if I had my will,\" I answered very warmly; at which she\nturned away confused, and would not look at me for awhile; \"but all my\nlife,\" I went on to say, \"if my fortune is so ill. And how long would\nyou wait for me, Lorna?\"\n\n\"Till I could get you,\" she answered slyly, with a smile which\nwas brighter to me than the brightest wit could be. \"And now,\" she\ncontinued, \"you bound me, John, with a very beautiful ring to you, and\nwhen I dare not wear it, I carry it always on my heart. But I will bind\nyou to me, you dearest, with the very poorest and plainest thing that\never you set eyes on. I could give you fifty fairer ones, but they would\nnot be honest; and I love you for your honesty, and nothing else of\ncourse, John; so don't you be conceited. Look at it, what a queer\nold thing! There are some ancient marks upon it, very grotesque and\nwonderful; it looks like a cat in a tree almost, but never mind what it\nlooks like. This old ring must have been a giant's; therefore it will\nfit you perhaps, you enormous John. It has been on the front of my old\nglass necklace (which my grandfather found them taking away, and very\nsoon made them give back again) ever since I can remember; and long\nbefore that, as some woman told me. Now you seem very greatly amazed;\npray what thinks my lord of it?\"\n\n\"That is worth fifty of the pearl thing which I gave you, you darling;\nand that I will not take it from you.\"\n\n\"Then you will never take me, that is all. I will have nothing to do\nwith a gentleman\"--\n\n\"No gentleman, dear--a yeoman.\"\n\n\"Very well, a yeoman--nothing to do with a yeoman who will not accept my\nlove-gage. So, if you please, give it back again, and take your lovely\nring back.\"\n\nShe looked at me in such a manner, half in earnest, half in jest, and\nthree times three in love, that in spite of all good resolutions, and\nher own faint protest, I was forced to abandon all firm ideas, and kiss\nher till she was quite ashamed, and her head hung on my bosom, with the\nnight of her hair shed over me. Then I placed the pearl ring back on the\nsoft elastic bend of the finger she held up to scold me; and on my own\nsmallest finger drew the heavy hoop she had given me. I considered this\nwith satisfaction, until my darling recovered herself; and then I began\nvery gravely about it, to keep her (if I could) from chiding me:--\n\n\"Mistress Lorna, this is not the ring of any giant. It is nothing more\nnor less than a very ancient thumb-ring, such as once in my father's\ntime was ploughed up out of the ground in our farm, and sent to learned\ndoctors, who told us all about it, but kept the ring for their trouble.\nI will accept it, my own one love; and it shall go to my grave with\nme.\" And so it shall, unless there be villains who would dare to rob the\ndead.\n\nNow I have spoken about this ring (though I scarcely meant to do so,\nand would rather keep to myself things so very holy) because it holds an\nimportant part in the history of my Lorna. I asked her where the glass\nnecklace was from which the ring was fastened, and which she had worn\nin her childhood, and she answered that she hardly knew, but remembered\nthat her grandfather had begged her to give it up to him, when she was\nten years old or so, and had promised to keep it for her until she\ncould take care of it; at the same time giving her back the ring, and\nfastening it from her pretty neck, and telling her to be proud of it.\nAnd so she always had been, and now from her sweet breast she took it,\nand it became John Ridd's delight.\n\nAll this, or at least great part of it, I told my mother truly,\naccording to my promise; and she was greatly pleased with Lorna for\nhaving been so good to me, and for speaking so very sensibly; and then\nshe looked at the great gold ring, but could by no means interpret it.\nOnly she was quite certain, as indeed I myself was, that it must have\nbelonged to an ancient race of great consideration, and high rank,\nin their time. Upon which I was for taking it off, lest it should be\ndegraded by a common farmer's finger. But mother said \"No,\" with tears\nin her eyes; \"if the common farmer had won the great lady of the ancient\nrace, what were rings and old-world trinkets, when compared to the\nliving jewel?\" Being quite of her opinion in this, and loving the ring\n(which had no gem in it) as the token of my priceless gem, I resolved to\nwear it at any cost, except when I should be ploughing, or doing things\nlikely to break it; although I must own that it felt very queer (for I\nnever had throttled a finger before), and it looked very queer, for a\nlength of time, upon my great hard-working hand.\n\nAnd before I got used to my ring, or people could think that it belonged\nto me (plain and ungarnished though it was), and before I went to see\nLorna again, having failed to find any necessity, and remembering my\nduty to mother, we all had something else to think of, not so pleasant,\nand more puzzling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nJOHN RETURNS TO BUSINESS\n\n[Illustration: 299.jpg Guy Fawkes]\n\nNow November was upon us, and we had kept Allhallowmass, with roasting\nof skewered apples (like so many shuttlecocks), and after that the day\nof Fawkes, as became good Protestants, with merry bonfires and burned\nbatatas, and plenty of good feeding in honour of our religion; and then\nwhile we were at wheat-sowing, another visitor arrived.\n\nThis was Master Jeremy Stickles, who had been a good friend to me (as\ndescribed before) in London, and had earned my mother's gratitude, so\nfar as ever he chose to have it. And he seemed inclined to have it all;\nfor he made our farm-house his headquarters, and kept us quite at his\nbeck and call, going out at any time of the evening, and coming back at\nany time of the morning, and always expecting us to be ready, whether\nwith horse, or man, or maiden, or fire, or provisions. We knew that he\nwas employed somehow upon the service of the King, and had at different\nstations certain troopers and orderlies quite at his disposal; also\nwe knew that he never went out, nor even slept in his bedroom, without\nheavy firearms well loaded, and a sharp sword nigh his hand; and that\nhe held a great commission, under royal signet, requiring all good\nsubjects, all officers of whatever degree, and especially justices of\nthe peace, to aid him to the utmost, with person, beast, and chattel, or\nto answer it at their peril.\n\nNow Master Jeremy Stickles, of course, knowing well what women are,\ndurst not open to any of them the nature of his instructions. But, after\nawhile, perceiving that I could be relied upon, and that it was a great\ndiscomfort not to have me with him, he took me aside in a lonely place,\nand told me nearly everything; having bound me first by oath, not to\nimpart to any one, without his own permission, until all was over.\n\nBut at this present time of writing, all is over long ago; ay and\nforgotten too, I ween, except by those who suffered. Therefore may I\ntell the whole without any breach of confidence. Master Stickles was\ngoing forth upon his usual night journey, when he met me coming home,\nand I said something half in jest, about his zeal and secrecy; upon\nwhich he looked all round the yard, and led me to an open space in the\nclover field adjoining.\n\n\"John,\" he said, \"you have some right to know the meaning of all this,\nbeing trusted as you were by the Lord Chief Justice. But he found you\nscarcely supple enough, neither gifted with due brains.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that same,\" I answered, while he tapped his head, to\nsignify his own much larger allowance. Then he made me bind myself,\nwhich in an evil hour I did, to retain his secret; and after that he\nwent on solemnly, and with much importance,--\n\n\"There be some people fit to plot, and others to be plotted against,\nand others to unravel plots, which is the highest gift of all. This last\nhath fallen to my share, and a very thankless gift it is, although a\nrare and choice one. Much of peril too attends it; daring courage and\ngreat coolness are as needful for the work as ready wit and spotless\nhonour. Therefore His Majesty's advisers have chosen me for this high\ntask, and they could not have chosen a better man. Although you have\nbeen in London, Jack, much longer than you wished it, you are wholly\nignorant, of course, in matters of state, and the public weal.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"no doubt but I am, and all the better for me. Although\nI heard a deal of them; for everybody was talking, and ready to come to\nblows; if only it could be done without danger. But one said this, and\none said that; and they talked so much about Birminghams, and Tantivies,\nand Whigs and Tories, and Protestant flails and such like, that I was\nonly too glad to have my glass and clink my spoon for answer.\"\n\n\"Right, John, thou art right as usual. Let the King go his own gait. He\nhath too many mistresses to be ever England's master. Nobody need fear\nhim, for he is not like his father: he will have his own way, 'tis true,\nbut without stopping other folk of theirs: and well he knows what women\nare, for he never asks them questions. Now heard you much in London town\nabout the Duke of Monmouth?\"\n\n\"Not so very much,\" I answered; \"not half so much as in Devonshire: only\nthat he was a hearty man, and a very handsome one, and now was banished\nby the Tories; and most people wished he was coming back, instead of the\nDuke of York, who was trying boots in Scotland.\"\n\n\"Things are changed since you were in town. The Whigs are getting up\nagain, through the folly of the Tories killing poor Lord Russell; and\nnow this Master Sidney (if my Lord condemns him) will make it worse\nagain. There is much disaffection everywhere, and it must grow to an\noutbreak. The King hath many troops in London, and meaneth to bring\nmore from Tangier; but he cannot command these country places; and the\ntrained bands cannot help him much, even if they would. Now, do you\nunderstand me, John?\"\n\n\"In truth, not I. I see not what Tangier hath to do with Exmoor; nor the\nDuke of Monmouth with Jeremy Stickles.\"\n\n\"Thou great clod, put it the other way. Jeremy Stickles may have much to\ndo about the Duke of Monmouth. The Whigs having failed of Exclusion, and\nhaving been punished bitterly for the blood they shed, are ripe for any\nviolence. And the turn of the balance is now to them. See-saw is the\nfashion of England always; and the Whigs will soon be the top-sawyers.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, still more confused, \"'The King is the top-sawyer,'\naccording to our proverb. How then can the Whigs be?\"\n\n\"Thou art a hopeless ass, John. Better to sew with a chestnut than to\nteach thee the constitution. Let it be so, let it be. I have seen a\nboy of five years old more apt at politics than thou. Nay, look not\noffended, lad. It is my fault for being over-deep to thee. I should have\nconsidered thy intellect.\"\n\n\"Nay, Master Jeremy, make no apologies. It is I that should excuse\nmyself; but, God knows, I have no politics.\"\n\n\"Stick to that, my lad,\" he answered; \"so shalt thou die easier. Now,\nin ten words (without parties, or trying thy poor brain too much), I am\nhere to watch the gathering of a secret plot, not so much against the\nKing as against the due succession.\"\n\n\"Now I understand at last. But, Master Stickles, you might have said all\nthat an hour ago almost.\"\n\n\"It would have been better, if I had, to thee,\" he replied with much\ncompassion; \"thy hat is nearly off thy head with the swelling of brain I\nhave given thee. Blows, blows, are thy business, Jack. There thou art in\nthine element. And, haply, this business will bring thee plenty even\nfor thy great head to take. Now hearken to one who wishes thee well,\nand plainly sees the end of it--stick thou to the winning side, and have\nnaught to do with the other one.\"\n\n\"That,\" said I, in great haste and hurry, \"is the very thing I want\nto do, if I only knew which was the winning side, for the sake of\nLorna--that is to say, for the sake of my dear mother and sisters, and\nthe farm.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Jeremy Stickles, laughing at the redness of my face--\"Lorna,\nsaidst thou; now what Lorna? Is it the name of a maiden, or a\nlight-o'-love?\"\n\n\"Keep to your own business,\" I answered, very proudly; \"spy as much as\ne'er thou wilt, and use our house for doing it, without asking leave or\ntelling; but if I ever find thee spying into my affairs, all the King's\nlifeguards in London, and the dragoons thou bringest hither, shall not\nsave thee from my hand--or one finger is enough for thee.\"\n\nBeing carried beyond myself by his insolence about Lorna, I looked\nat Master Stickles so, and spake in such a voice, that all his daring\ncourage and his spotless honour quailed within him, and he shrank--as if\nI would strike so small a man.\n\nThen I left him, and went to work at the sacks upon the corn-floor, to\ntake my evil spirit from me before I should see mother. For (to tell the\ntruth) now my strength was full, and troubles were gathering round me,\nand people took advantage so much of my easy temper, sometimes when\nI was over-tried, a sudden heat ran over me, and a glowing of all\nmy muscles, and a tingling for a mighty throw, such as my utmost\nself-command, and fear of hurting any one, could but ill refrain.\nAfterwards, I was always very sadly ashamed of myself, knowing how poor\na thing bodily strength is, as compared with power of mind, and that it\nis a coward's part to misuse it upon weaker folk. For the present there\nwas a little breach between Master Stickles and me, for which I blamed\nmyself very sorely. But though, in full memory of his kindness and\nfaithfulness in London, I asked his pardon many times for my foolish\nanger with him, and offered to undergo any penalty he would lay upon me,\nhe only said it was no matter, there was nothing to forgive. When people\nsay that, the truth often is that they can forgive nothing.\n\nSo for the present a breach was made between Master Jeremy and myself,\nwhich to me seemed no great loss, inasmuch as it relieved me from any\nprivity to his dealings, for which I had small liking. All I feared was\nlest I might, in any way, be ungrateful to him; but when he would have\nno more of me, what could I do to help it? However, in a few days' time\nI was of good service to him, as you shall see in its proper place.\n\nBut now my own affairs were thrown into such disorder that I could\nthink of nothing else, and had the greatest difficulty in hiding my\nuneasiness. For suddenly, without any warning, or a word of message,\nall my Lorna's signals ceased, which I had been accustomed to watch for\ndaily, and as it were to feed upon them, with a glowing heart. The first\ntime I stood on the wooded crest, and found no change from yesterday, I\ncould hardly believe my eyes, or thought at least that it must be some\ngreat mistake on the part of my love. However, even that oppressed me\nwith a heavy heart, which grew heavier, as I found from day to day no\ntoken.\n\nThree times I went and waited long at the bottom of the valley, where\nnow the stream was brown and angry with the rains of autumn, and the\nweeping trees hung leafless. But though I waited at every hour of day,\nand far into the night, no light footstep came to meet me, no sweet\nvoice was in the air; all was lonely, drear, and drenched with sodden\ndesolation. It seemed as if my love was dead, and the winds were at her\nfuneral.\n\nOnce I sought far up the valley, where I had never been before, even\nbeyond the copse where Lorna had found and lost her brave young cousin.\nFollowing up the river channel, in shelter of the evening fog, I gained\na corner within stone's throw of the last outlying cot. This was a\ngloomy, low, square house, without any light in the windows, roughly\nbuilt of wood and stone, as I saw when I drew nearer. For knowing it\nto be Carver's dwelling (or at least suspecting so, from some words of\nLorna's), I was led by curiosity, and perhaps by jealousy, to have a\ncloser look at it. Therefore, I crept up the stream, losing half my\nsense of fear, by reason of anxiety. And in truth there was not much to\nfear, the sky being now too dark for even a shooter of wild fowl to make\ngood aim. And nothing else but guns could hurt me, as in the pride of my\nstrength I thought, and in my skill of single-stick.\n\n[Illustration: 304.jpg Nevertheless, I went warily]\n\nNevertheless, I went warily, being now almost among this nest of\ncockatrices. The back of Carver's house abutted on the waves of the\nrushing stream; and seeing a loop-hole, vacant for muskets, I looked in,\nbut all was quiet. So far as I could judge by listening, there was no\none now inside, and my heart for a moment leaped with joy, for I\nhad feared to find Lorna there. Then I took a careful survey of the\ndwelling, and its windows, and its door, and aspect, as if I had been\na robber meaning to make privy entrance. It was well for me that I did\nthis, as you will find hereafter.\n\nHaving impressed upon my mind (a slow but, perhaps retentive mind), all\nthe bearings of the place, and all its opportunities, and even the\ncurve of the stream along it, and the bushes near the door, I was much\ninclined to go farther up, and understand all the village. But a bar of\nred light across the river, some forty yards on above me, and crossing\nfrom the opposite side like a chain, prevented me. In that second house\nthere was a gathering of loud and merry outlaws, making as much noise as\nif they had the law upon their side. Some, indeed, as I approached, were\nlaying down both right and wrong, as purely, and with as high a sense,\nas if they knew the difference. Cold and troubled as I was, I could\nhardly keep from laughing.\n\nBefore I betook myself home that night, and eased dear mother's heart\nso much, and made her pale face spread with smiles, I had resolved to\npenetrate Glen Doone from the upper end, and learn all about my Lorna.\nNot but what I might have entered from my unsuspected channel, as so\noften I had done; but that I saw fearful need for knowing something more\nthan that. Here was every sort of trouble gathering upon me, here was\nJeremy Stickles stealing upon every one in the dark; here was\nUncle Reuben plotting Satan only could tell what; here was a white\nnight-capped man coming bodily from the grave; here was my own sister\nAnnie committed to a highwayman, and mother in distraction; most of\nall--here, there, and where--was my Lorna stolen, dungeoned, perhaps\noutraged. It was no time for shilly shally, for the balance of this and\nthat, or for a man with blood and muscle to pat his nose and ponder.\nIf I left my Lorna so; if I let those black-soul'd villains work their\npleasure on my love; if the heart that clave to mine could find no\nvigour in it--then let maidens cease from men, and rest their faith in\ntabby-cats.\n\nRudely rolling these ideas in my heavy head and brain I resolved to let\nthe morrow put them into form and order, but not contradict them. And\nthen, as my constitution willed (being like that of England), I slept,\nand there was no stopping me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nA VERY DESPERATE VENTURE\n\n[Illustration: 306.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThat the enterprise now resolved upon was far more dangerous than any\nhitherto attempted by me, needs no further proof than this:--I went and\nmade my will at Porlock, with a middling honest lawyer there; not that I\nhad much to leave, but that none could say how far the farm, and all the\nfarming stock, might depend on my disposition. It makes me smile when I\nremember how particular I was, and how for the life of me I was puzzled\nto bequeath most part of my clothes, and hats, and things altogether\nmy own, to Lorna, without the shrewd old lawyer knowing who she was and\nwhere she lived. At last, indeed, I flattered myself that I had baffled\nold Tape's curiosity; but his wrinkled smile and his speech at parting\nmade me again uneasy.\n\n\"A very excellent will, young sir. An admirably just and virtuous will;\nall your effects to your nearest of kin; filial and fraternal duty\nthoroughly exemplified; nothing diverted to alien channels, except a\nsmall token of esteem and reverence to an elderly lady, I presume: and\nwhich may or may not be valid, or invalid, on the ground of uncertainty,\nor the absence of any legal status on the part of the legatee. Ha, ha!\nYes, yes! Few young men are so free from exceptionable entanglements.\nTwo guineas is my charge, sir: and a rare good will for the money. Very\nprudent of you, sir. Does you credit in every way. Well, well; we all\nmust die; and often the young before the old.\"\n\nNot only did I think two guineas a great deal too much money for a\nquarter of an hour's employment, but also I disliked particularly the\nwords with which he concluded; they sounded, from his grating voice,\nlike the evil omen of a croaking raven. Nevertheless I still abode in my\nfixed resolve to go, and find out, if I died for it, what was become of\nLorna. And herein I lay no claim to courage; the matter being simply\na choice between two evils, of which by far the greater one was, of\ncourse, to lose my darling.\n\nThe journey was a great deal longer to fetch around the Southern hills,\nand enter by the Doone-gate, than to cross the lower land and steal in\nby the water-slide. However, I durst not take a horse (for fear of\nthe Doones who might be abroad upon their usual business), but started\nbetimes in the evening, so as not to hurry, or waste any strength upon\nthe way. And thus I came to the robbers' highway, walking circumspectly,\nscanning the sky-line of every hill, and searching the folds of every\nvalley, for any moving figure.\n\nAlthough it was now well on towards dark, and the sun was down an hour\nor so, I could see the robbers' road before me, in a trough of the\nwinding hills, where the brook ploughed down from the higher barrows,\nand the coving banks were roofed with furze. At present, there was no\none passing, neither post nor sentinel, so far as I could descry; but\nI thought it safer to wait a little, as twilight melted into night;\nand then I crept down a seam of the highland, and stood upon the\nDoone-track.\n\nAs the road approached the entrance, it became more straight and strong,\nlike a channel cut from rock, with the water brawling darkly along the\nnaked side of it. Not a tree or bush was left, to shelter a man from\nbullets: all was stern, and stiff, and rugged, as I could not help\nperceiving, even through the darkness, and a smell as of churchyard\nmould, a sense of being boxed in and cooped, made me long to be out\nagain.\n\nAnd here I was, or seemed to be, particularly unlucky; for as I drew\nnear the very entrance, lightly of foot and warily, the moon (which had\noften been my friend) like an enemy broke upon me, topping the eastward\nridge of rock, and filling all the open spaces with the play of wavering\nlight. I shrank back into the shadowy quarter on the right side of the\nroad; and gloomily employed myself to watch the triple entrance, on\nwhich the moonlight fell askew.\n\nAll across and before the three rude and beetling archways hung a\nfelled oak overhead, black, and thick, and threatening. This, as I heard\nbefore, could be let fall in a moment, so as to crush a score of men,\nand bar the approach of horses. Behind this tree, the rocky mouth was\nspanned, as by a gallery with brushwood and piled timber, all upon a\nledge of stone, where thirty men might lurk unseen, and fire at any\ninvader. From that rampart it would be impossible to dislodge them,\nbecause the rock fell sheer below them twenty feet, or it may be more;\nwhile overhead it towered three hundred, and so jutted over that nothing\ncould be cast upon them; even if a man could climb the height. And\nthe access to this portcullis place--if I may so call it, being no\nportcullis there--was through certain rocky chambers known to the\ntenants only.\n\nBut the cleverest of their devices, and the most puzzling to an enemy,\nwas that, instead of one mouth only, there were three to choose from,\nwith nothing to betoken which was the proper access; all being pretty\nmuch alike, and all unfenced and yawning. And the common rumour was\nthat in times of any danger, when any force was known to be on muster in\ntheir neighbourhood, they changed their entrance every day, and diverted\nthe other two, by means of sliding doors to the chasms and dark abysses.\n\nNow I could see those three rough arches, jagged, black, and terrible;\nand I knew that only one of them could lead me to the valley; neither\ngave the river now any further guidance; but dived underground with a\nsullen roar, where it met the cross-bar of the mountain. Having no means\nat all of judging which was the right way of the three, and knowing that\nthe other two would lead to almost certain death, in the ruggedness and\ndarkness,--for how could a man, among precipices and bottomless depths\nof water, without a ray of light, have any chance to save his life?--I\ndo declare that I was half inclined to go away, and have done with it.\n\nHowever, I knew one thing for certain, to wit, that the longer I stayed\ndebating the more would the enterprise pall upon me, and the less my\nrelish be. And it struck me that, in times of peace, the middle way was\nthe likeliest; and the others diverging right and left in their farther\nparts might be made to slide into it (not far from the entrance), at the\npleasure of the warders. Also I took it for good omen that I remembered\n(as rarely happened) a very fine line in the Latin grammar, whose\nemphasis and meaning is \"middle road is safest.\"\n\nTherefore, without more hesitation, I plunged into the middle way,\nholding a long ash staff before me, shodden at the end with iron.\nPresently I was in black darkness groping along the wall, and feeling a\ndeal more fear than I wished to feel; especially when upon looking back\nI could no longer see the light, which I had forsaken. Then I stumbled\nover something hard, and sharp, and very cold, moreover so grievous to\nmy legs that it needed my very best doctrine and humour to forbear from\nswearing, in the manner they use in London. But when I arose and felt\nit, and knew it to be a culverin, I was somewhat reassured thereby,\ninasmuch as it was not likely that they would plant this engine except\nin the real and true entrance.\n\nTherefore I went on again, more painfully and wearily, and presently\nfound it to be good that I had received that knock, and borne it with\nsuch patience; for otherwise I might have blundered full upon the\nsentries, and been shot without more ado. As it was, I had barely time\nto draw back, as I turned a corner upon them; and if their lanthorn had\nbeen in its place, they could scarce have failed to descry me, unless\nindeed I had seen the gleam before I turned the corner.\n\nThere seemed to be only two of them, of size indeed and stature as all\nthe Doones must be, but I need not have feared to encounter them both,\nhad they been unarmed, as I was. It was plain, however, that each had a\nlong and heavy carbine, not in his hands (as it should have been), but\nstanding close beside him. Therefore it behoved me now to be exceedingly\ncareful, and even that might scarce avail, without luck in proportion.\nSo I kept well back at the corner, and laid one cheek to the rock\nface, and kept my outer eye round the jut, in the wariest mode I could\ncompass, watching my opportunity: and this is what I saw.\n\nThe two villains looked very happy--which villains have no right to be,\nbut often are, meseemeth--they were sitting in a niche of rock, with\nthe lanthorn in the corner, quaffing something from glass measures, and\nplaying at push-pin, or shepherd's chess, or basset; or some trivial\ngame of that sort. Each was smoking a long clay pipe, quite of new\nLondon shape, I could see, for the shadow was thrown out clearly; and\neach would laugh from time to time, as he fancied he got the better of\nit. One was sitting with his knees up, and left hand on his thigh; and\nthis one had his back to me, and seemed to be the stouter. The other\nleaned more against the rock, half sitting and half astraddle, and\nwearing leathern overalls, as if newly come from riding. I could see his\nface quite clearly by the light of the open lanthorn, and a handsomer\nor a bolder face I had seldom, if ever, set eyes upon; insomuch that it\nmade me very unhappy to think of his being so near my Lorna.\n\n\"How long am I to stand crouching here?\" I asked of myself, at last,\nbeing tired of hearing them cry, \"score one,\" \"score two,\" \"No,\nby--, Charlie,\" \"By --, I say it is, Phelps.\" And yet my only chance of\nslipping by them unperceived was to wait till they quarrelled more, and\ncame to blows about it. Presently, as I made up my mind to steal along\ntowards them (for the cavern was pretty wide, just there), Charlie, or\nCharleworth Doone, the younger and taller man, reached forth his hand\nto seize the money, which he swore he had won that time. Upon this,\nthe other jerked his arm, vowing that he had no right to it; whereupon\nCharlie flung at his face the contents of the glass he was sipping,\nbut missed him and hit the candle, which sputtered with a flare of\nblue flame (from the strength perhaps of the spirit) and then went out\ncompletely. At this, one swore, and the other laughed; and before they\nhad settled what to do, I was past them and round the corner.\n\nAnd then, like a giddy fool as I was, I needs must give them a\nstartler--the whoop of an owl, done so exactly, as John Fry had taught\nme, and echoed by the roof so fearfully, that one of them dropped the\ntinder box; and the other caught up his gun and cocked it, at least as\nI judged by the sounds they made. And then, too late, I knew my madness,\nfor if either of them had fired, no doubt but what all the village would\nhave risen and rushed upon me. However, as the luck of the matter went,\nit proved for my advantage; for I heard one say to the other,--\n\n\"Curse it, Charlie, what was that? It scared me so, I have dropped my\nbox; my flint is gone, and everything. Will the brimstone catch from\nyour pipe, my lad?\"\n\n\"My pipe is out, Phelps, ever so long. Damn it, I am not afraid of an\nowl, man. Give me the lanthorn, and stay here. I'm not half done with\nyou yet, my friend.\"\n\n\"Well said, my boy, well said! Go straight to Carver's, mind you. The\nother sleepy heads be snoring, as there is nothing up to-night. No\ndallying now under Captain's window. Queen will have nought to say to\nyou; and Carver will punch your head into a new wick for your lanthorn.\"\n\n\"Will he though? Two can play at that.\" And so after some rude jests,\nand laughter, and a few more oaths, I heard Charlie (or at any rate\nsomebody) coming toward me, with a loose and not too sober footfall. As\nhe reeled a little in his gait, and I would not move from his way one\ninch, after his talk of Lorna, but only longed to grasp him (if common\nsense permitted it), his braided coat came against my thumb, and his\nleathern gaiters brushed my knee. If he had turned or noticed it, he\nwould have been a dead man in a moment; but his drunkenness saved him.\n\nSo I let him reel on unharmed; and thereupon it occurred to me that I\ncould have no better guide, passing as he would exactly where I wished\nto be; that is to say under Lorna's window. Therefore I followed him\nwithout any especial caution; and soon I had the pleasure of seeing\nhis form against the moonlit sky. Down a steep and winding path, with\na handrail at the corners (such as they have at Ilfracombe), Master\nCharlie tripped along--and indeed there was much tripping, and he must\nhave been an active fellow to recover as he did--and after him walked I,\nmuch hoping (for his own poor sake) that he might not turn and espy me.\n\nBut Bacchus (of whom I read at school, with great wonder about his\nmeaning--and the same I may say of Venus) that great deity preserved\nCharlie, his pious worshipper, from regarding consequences. So he led\nme very kindly to the top of the meadow land, where the stream from\nunderground broke forth, seething quietly with a little hiss of bubbles.\nHence I had fair view and outline of the robbers' township, spread\nwith bushes here and there, but not heavily overshadowed. The moon,\napproaching now the full, brought the forms in manner forth, clothing\neach with character, as the moon (more than the sun) does, to an eye\naccustomed.\n\nI knew that the Captain's house was first, both from what Lorna had\nsaid of it, and from my mother's description, and now again from seeing\nCharlie halt there for a certain time, and whistle on his fingers, and\nhurry on, fearing consequence. The tune that he whistled was strange to\nme, and lingered in my ears, as having something very new and striking,\nand fantastic in it. And I repeated it softly to myself, while I marked\nthe position of the houses and the beauty of the village. For the\nstream, in lieu of any street, passing between the houses, and affording\nperpetual change, and twinkling, and reflections moreover by its sleepy\nmurmur soothing all the dwellers there, this and the snugness of the\nposition, walled with rock and spread with herbage, made it look, in the\nquiet moonlight, like a little paradise. And to think of all the inmates\nthere, sleeping with good consciences, having plied their useful trade\nof making others work for them, enjoying life without much labour, yet\nwith great renown.\n\nMaster Charlie went down the village, and I followed him carefully,\nkeeping as much as possible in the shadowy places, and watching the\nwindows of every house, lest any light should be burning. As I passed\nSir Ensor's house, my heart leaped up, for I spied a window, higher than\nthe rest above the ground, and with a faint light moving. This could\nhardly fail to be the room wherein my darling lay; for here that\nimpudent young fellow had gazed while he was whistling. And here my\ncourage grew tenfold, and my spirit feared no evil--for lo, if Lorna had\nbeen surrendered to that scoundrel, Carver, she would not have been at\nher grandfather's house, but in Carver's accursed dwelling.\n\nWarm with this idea, I hurried after Charleworth Doone, being resolved\nnot to harm him now, unless my own life required it. And while I watched\nfrom behind a tree, the door of the farthest house was opened; and sure\nenough it was Carver's self, who stood bareheaded, and half undressed in\nthe doorway. I could see his great black chest, and arms, by the light\nof the lamp he bore.\n\n\"Who wants me this time of night?\" he grumbled, in a deep gruff voice;\n\"any young scamp prowling after the maids shall have sore bones for his\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"All the fair maids are for thee, are they, Master Carver?\" Charlie\nanswered, laughing; \"we young scamps must be well-content with coarser\nstuff than thou wouldst have.\"\n\n\"Would have? Ay, and will have,\" the great beast muttered angrily. \"I\nbide my time; but not very long. Only one word for thy good, Charlie. I\nwill fling thee senseless into the river, if ever I catch thy girl-face\nthere again.\"\n\n\"Mayhap, Master Carver, it is more than thou couldst do. But I will not\nkeep thee; thou art not pleasant company to-night. All I want is a light\nfor my lanthorn, and a glass of schnapps, if thou hast it.\"\n\n\"What is become of thy light, then? Good for thee I am not on duty.\"\n\n\"A great owl flew between me and Phelps, as we watched beside the\nculvern, and so scared was he at our fierce bright eyes that he fell and\nknocked the light out.\"\n\n\"Likely tale, or likely lie, Charles! We will have the truth to-morrow.\nHere take thy light, and be gone with thee. All virtuous men are in bed\nnow.\"\n\n\"Then so will I be, and why art thou not? Ha, have I earned my schnapps\nnow?\"\n\n\"If thou hast, thou hast paid a bad debt; there is too much in thee\nalready. Be off! my patience is done with.\"\n\nThen he slammed the door in the young man's face, having kindled his\nlanthorn by this time: and Charlie went up to the watchplace again,\nmuttering as he passed me, \"Bad look-out for all of us, when that surly\nold beast is Captain. No gentle blood in him, no hospitality, not even\npleasant language, nor a good new oath in his frowsy pate! I've a mind\nto cut the whole of it; and but for the girls I would so.\"\n\nMy heart was in my mouth, as they say, when I stood in the shade by\nLorna's window, and whispered her name gently. The house was of one\nstory only, as the others were, with pine-ends standing forth the stone,\nand only two rough windows upon that western side of it, and perhaps\nboth of them were Lorna's. The Doones had been their own builders, for\nno one should know their ins and outs; and of course their work was\nclumsy. As for their windows, they stole them mostly from the houses\nround about. But though the window was not very close, I might have\nwhispered long enough, before she would have answered me; frightened as\nshe was, no doubt by many a rude overture. And I durst not speak\naloud because I saw another watchman posted on the western cliff, and\ncommanding all the valley. And now this man (having no companion for\ndrinking or for gambling) espied me against the wall of the house, and\nadvanced to the brink, and challenged me.\n\n\"Who are you there? Answer! One, two, three; and I fire at thee.\"\n\nThe nozzle of his gun was pointed full upon me, as I could see, with the\nmoonlight striking on the barrel; he was not more than fifty yards off,\nand now he began to reckon. Being almost desperate about it, I began to\nwhistle, wondering how far I should get before I lost my windpipe:\nand as luck would have it, my lips fell into that strange tune I\nhad practised last; the one I had heard from Charlie. My mouth would\nscarcely frame the notes, being parched with terror; but to my surprise,\nthe man fell back, dropped his gun, and saluted. Oh, sweetest of all\nsweet melodies!\n\nThat tune was Carver Doone's passport (as I heard long afterwards),\nwhich Charleworth Doone had imitated, for decoy of Lorna. The sentinel\ntook me for that vile Carver; who was like enough to be prowling there,\nfor private talk with Lorna; but not very likely to shout forth his\nname, if it might be avoided. The watchman, perceiving the danger\nperhaps of intruding on Carver's privacy, not only retired along the\ncliff, but withdrew himself to good distance.\n\nMeanwhile he had done me the kindest service; for Lorna came to the\nwindow at once, to see what the cause of the shout was, and drew back\nthe curtain timidly. Then she opened the rough lattice; and then she\nwatched the cliff and trees; and then she sighed very sadly.\n\n\"Oh, Lorna, don't you know me?\" I whispered from the side, being afraid\nof startling her by appearing over suddenly.\n\nQuick though she always was of thought, she knew me not from my whisper,\nand was shutting the window hastily when I caught it back, and showed\nmyself.\n\n\"John!\" she cried, yet with sense enough not to speak aloud: \"oh, you\nmust be mad, John.\"\n\n\"As mad as a March hare,\" said I, \"without any news of my darling. You\nknew I would come: of course you did.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought, perhaps--you know: now, John, you need not eat my\nhand. Do you see they have put iron bars across?\"\n\n\"To be sure. Do you think I should be contented, even with this lovely\nhand, but for these vile iron bars. I will have them out before I go.\nNow, darling, for one moment--just the other hand, for a change, you\nknow.\"\n\nSo I got the other, but was not honest; for I kept them both, and felt\ntheir delicate beauty trembling, as I laid them to my heart.\n\n\"Oh, John, you will make me cry directly\"--she had been crying long\nago--\"if you go on in that way. You know we can never have one another;\nevery one is against it. Why should I make you miserable? Try not to\nthink of me any more.\"\n\n\"And will you try the same of me, Lorna?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, John; if you agree to it. At least I will try to try it.\"\n\n\"Then you won't try anything of the sort,\" I cried with great\nenthusiasm, for her tone was so nice and melancholy: \"the only thing\nwe will try to try, is to belong to one another. And if we do our best,\nLorna, God alone can prevent us.\"\n\nShe crossed herself, with one hand drawn free as I spoke so boldly;\nand something swelled in her little throat, and prevented her from\nanswering.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" I said; \"what means all this? Why are you so pent up\nhere? Why have you given me no token? Has your grandfather turned\nagainst you? Are you in any danger?\"\n\n\"My poor grandfather is very ill: I fear that he will not live long. The\nCounsellor and his son are now the masters of the valley; and I dare\nnot venture forth, for fear of anything they might do to me. When I went\nforth, to signal for you, Carver tried to seize me; but I was too quick\nfor him. Little Gwenny is not allowed to leave the valley now; so that\nI could send no message. I have been so wretched, dear, lest you should\nthink me false to you. The tyrants now make sure of me. You must watch\nthis house, both night and day, if you wish to save me. There is nothing\nthey would shrink from; if my poor grandfather--oh, I cannot bear to\nthink of myself, when I ought to think of him only; dying without a son\nto tend him, or a daughter to shed a tear.\"\n\n\"But surely he has sons enough; and a deal too many,\" I was going to\nsay, but stopped myself in time: \"why do none of them come to him?\"\n\n\"I know not. I cannot tell. He is a very strange old man; and few have\never loved him. He was black with wrath at the Counsellor, this very\nafternoon--but I must not keep you here--you are much too brave, John;\nand I am much too selfish: there, what was that shadow?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than a bat, darling, come to look for his sweetheart. I\nwill not stay long; you tremble so: and yet for that very reason, how\ncan I leave you, Lorna?\"\n\n\"You must--you must,\" she answered; \"I shall die if they hurt you. I\nhear the old nurse moving. Grandfather is sure to send for me. Keep back\nfrom the window.\"\n\nHowever, it was only Gwenny Carfax, Lorna's little handmaid: my darling\nbrought her to the window and presented her to me, almost laughing\nthrough her grief.\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad, John; Gwenny, I am so glad you came. I have wanted\nlong to introduce you to my 'young man,' as you call him. It is rather\ndark, but you can see him. I wish you to know him again, Gwenny.\"\n\n\"Whoy!\" cried Gwenny, with great amazement, standing on tiptoe to look\nout, and staring as if she were weighing me: \"her be bigger nor any\nDoone! Heared as her have bate our Cornish champion awrastling. 'Twadn't\nfair play nohow: no, no; don't tell me, 'twadn't fair play nohow.\"\n\n\"True enough, Gwenny,\" I answered her; for the play had been very unfair\nindeed on the side of the Bodmin champion; \"it was not a fair bout,\nlittle maid; I am free to acknowledge that.\" By that answer, or rather\nby the construction she put upon it, the heart of the Cornish girl was\nwon, more than by gold and silver.\n\n\"I shall knoo thee again, young man; no fear of that,\" she answered,\nnodding with an air of patronage. \"Now, missis, gae on coortin', and\nI wall gae outside and watch for 'ee.\" Though expressed not over\ndelicately, this proposal arose, no doubt, from Gwenny's sense of\ndelicacy; and I was very thankful to her for taking her departure.\n\n\"She is the best little thing in the world,\" said Lorna, softly\nlaughing; \"and the queerest, and the truest. Nothing will bribe her\nagainst me. If she seems to be on the other side, never, never doubt\nher. Now no more of your 'coortin', John! I love you far too well for\nthat. Yes, yes, ever so much! If you will take a mean advantage of me.\nAnd as much as ever you like to imagine; and then you may double it,\nafter that. Only go, do go, good John; kind, dear, darling John; if you\nlove me, go.\"\n\n\"How can I go without settling anything?\" I asked very sensibly. \"How\nshall I know of your danger now? Hit upon something; you are so quick.\nAnything you can think of; and then I will go, and not frighten you.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking long of something,\" Lorna answered rapidly, with\nthat peculiar clearness of voice which made every syllable ring like\nmusic of a several note, \"you see that tree with the seven rooks' nests\nbright against the cliffs there? Can you count them, from above, do you\nthink? From a place where you will be safe, dear\"--\n\n\"No doubt, I can; or if I cannot, it will not take me long to find a\nspot, whence I can do it.\"\n\n\"Gwenny can climb like any cat. She has been up there in the summer,\nwatching the young birds, day by day, and daring the boys to touch them.\nThere are neither birds, nor eggs there now, of course, and nothing\ndoing. If you see but six rooks' nests; I am in peril and want you. If\nyou see but five, I am carried off by Carver.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said I, at the mere idea; in a tone which frightened Lorna.\n\n\"Fear not, John,\" she whispered sadly, and my blood grew cold at it:\n\"I have means to stop him; or at least to save myself. If you can come\nwithin one day of that man's getting hold of me, you will find me quite\nunharmed. After that you will find me dead, or alive, according to\ncircumstances, but in no case such that you need blush to look at me.\"\n\nHer dear sweet face was full of pride, as even in the gloom I saw: and I\nwould not trespass on her feelings by such a thing, at such a moment, as\nan attempt at any caress. I only said, \"God bless you, darling!\" and\nshe said the same to me, in a very low sad voice. And then I stole below\nCarver's house, in the shadow from the eastern cliff; and knowing\nenough of the village now to satisfy all necessity, betook myself to my\nwell-known track in returning from the valley; which was neither down\nthe waterslide (a course I feared in the darkness) nor up the cliffs at\nLorna's bower; but a way of my own inventing, which there is no need to\ndwell upon.\n\nA weight of care was off my mind; though much of trouble hung there\nstill. One thing was quite certain--if Lorna could not have John Ridd,\nno one else should have her. And my mother, who sat up for me, and with\nme long time afterwards, agreed that this was comfort.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nA GOOD TURN FOR JEREMY\n\n[Illustration: 318.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nJohn Fry had now six shillings a week of regular and permanent wage,\nbesides all harvest and shearing money, as well as a cottage rent-free,\nand enough of garden-ground to rear pot-herbs for his wife and all\nhis family. Now the wages appointed by our justices, at the time of\nsessions, were four-and-sixpence a week for summer, and a shilling less\nfor the winter-time; and we could be fined, and perhaps imprisoned, for\ngiving more than the sums so fixed. Therefore John Fry was looked upon\nas the richest man upon Exmoor, I mean of course among labourers, and\nthere were many jokes about robbing him, as if he were the mint of the\nKing; and Tom Faggus promised to try his hand, if he came across John\non the highway, although he had ceased from business, and was seeking a\nRoyal pardon.\n\nNow is it according to human nature, or is it a thing contradictory\n(as I would fain believe)? But anyhow, there was, upon Exmoor, no more\ndiscontented man, no man more sure that he had not his worth, neither\nhalf so sore about it, than, or as, John Fry was. And one thing he did\nwhich I could not wholly (or indeed I may say, in any measure)\nreconcile with my sense of right, much as I laboured to do John justice,\nespecially because of his roguery; and this was, that if we said too\nmuch, or accused him at all of laziness (which he must have known to be\nin him), he regularly turned round upon us, and quite compelled us\nto hold our tongues, by threatening to lay information against us for\npaying him too much wages!\n\nNow I have not mentioned all this of John Fry, from any disrespect for\nhis memory (which is green and honest amongst us), far less from any\ndesire to hurt the feelings of his grandchildren; and I will do them the\njustice, once for all, to avow, thus publicly, that I have known a great\nmany bigger rogues, and most of themselves in the number. But I have\nreferred, with moderation, to this little flaw in a worthy character (or\nfoible, as we call it, when a man is dead) for this reason only--that\nwithout it there was no explaining John's dealings with Jeremy Stickles.\n\nMaster Jeremy, being full of London and Norwich experience, fell into\nthe error of supposing that we clods and yokels were the simplest of the\nsimple, and could be cheated at his good pleasure. Now this is not so:\nwhen once we suspect that people have that idea of us, we indulge them\nin it to the top of their bent, and grieve that they should come out of\nit, as they do at last in amazement, with less money than before, and\nthe laugh now set against them.\n\nEver since I had offended Jeremy, by threatening him (as before related)\nin case of his meddling with my affairs, he had more and more allied\nhimself with simple-minded John, as he was pleased to call him. John\nFry was everything: it was \"run and fetch my horse, John\"--\"John, are my\npistols primed well?\"--\"I want you in the stable, John, about something\nvery particular\", until except for the rudeness of it, I was longing\nto tell Master Stickles that he ought to pay John's wages. John for\nhis part was not backward, but gave himself the most wonderful airs of\nsecrecy and importance, till half the parish began to think that the\naffairs of the nation were in his hand, and he scorned the sight of a\ndungfork.\n\nIt was not likely that this should last; and being the only man in the\nparish with any knowledge of politics, I gave John Fry to understand\nthat he must not presume to talk so freely, as if he were at least a\nconstable, about the constitution; which could be no affair of his, and\nmight bring us all into trouble. At this he only tossed his nose, as if\nhe had been in London at least three times for my one; which vexed me so\nthat I promised him the thick end of the plough-whip if even the name of\na knight of the shire should pass his lips for a fortnight.\n\nNow I did not suspect in my stupid noddle that John Fry would ever tell\nJeremy Stickles about the sight at the Wizard's Slough and the man in\nthe white nightcap; because John had sworn on the blade of his knife not\nto breathe a word to any soul, without my full permission. However, it\nappears that John related, for a certain consideration, all that he\nhad seen, and doubtless more which had accrued to it. Upon this Master\nStickles was much astonished at Uncle Reuben's proceedings, having\nalways accounted him a most loyal, keen, and wary subject.\n\nAll this I learned upon recovering Jeremy's good graces, which came to\npass in no other way than by the saving of his life. Being bound to keep\nthe strictest watch upon the seven rooks' nests, and yet not bearing\nto be idle and to waste my mother's stores, I contrived to keep my work\nentirely at the western corner of our farm, which was nearest to Glen\nDoone, and whence I could easily run to a height commanding the view I\ncoveted.\n\nOne day Squire Faggus had dropped in upon us, just in time for dinner;\nand very soon he and King's messenger were as thick as need be. Tom had\nbrought his beloved mare to show her off to Annie, and he mounted his\npretty sweetheart upon her, after giving Winnie notice to be on her\nvery best behaviour. The squire was in great spirits, having just\naccomplished a purchase of land which was worth ten times what he gave\nfor it; and this he did by a merry trick upon old Sir Roger Bassett, who\nnever supposed him to be in earnest, as not possessing the money. The\nwhole thing was done on a bumper of claret in a tavern where they met;\nand the old knight having once pledged his word, no lawyers could\nhold him back from it. They could only say that Master Faggus, being\nattainted of felony, was not a capable grantee. \"I will soon cure that,\"\nquoth Tom, \"my pardon has been ready for months and months, so soon as I\ncare to sue it.\"\n\nAnd now he was telling our Annie, who listened very rosily, and believed\nevery word he said, that, having been ruined in early innocence by the\nmeans of lawyers, it was only just, and fair turn for turn, that having\nbecome a match for them by long practice upon the highway, he should\nreinstate himself, at their expense, in society. And now he would go\nto London at once, and sue out his pardon, and then would his lovely\ndarling Annie, etc., etc.--things which I had no right to hear, and in\nwhich I was not wanted.\n\nTherefore I strode away up the lane to my afternoon's employment, sadly\ncomparing my love with theirs (which now appeared so prosperous), yet\nheartily glad for Annie's sake; only remembering now and then the old\nproverb \"Wrong never comes right.\"\n\nI worked very hard in the copse of young ash, with my billhook and a\nshearing-knife; cutting out the saplings where they stooled too close\ntogether, making spars to keep for thatching, wall-crooks to drive into\nthe cob, stiles for close sheep hurdles, and handles for rakes, and\nhoes, and two-bills, of the larger and straighter stuff. And all the\nlesser I bound in faggots, to come home on the sledd to the woodrick.\nIt is not to be supposed that I did all this work, without many peeps at\nthe seven rooks' nests, which proved my Lorna's safety. Indeed, whenever\nI wanted a change, either from cleaving, or hewing too hard, or stooping\ntoo much at binding, I was up and away to the ridge of the hill, instead\nof standing and doing nothing.\n\nSoon I forgot about Tom and Annie; and fell to thinking of Lorna only;\nand how much I would make of her; and what I should call our children;\nand how I would educate them, to do honour to her rank; yet all the time\nI worked none the worse, by reason of meditation. Fresh-cut spars are\nnot so good as those of a little seasoning; especially if the sap\nwas not gone down at the time of cutting. Therefore we always find it\nneedful to have plenty still in stock.\n\nIt was very pleasant there in the copse, sloping to the west as it was,\nand the sun descending brightly, with rocks and banks to dwell upon. The\nstems of mottled and dimpled wood, with twigs coming out like elbows,\nhung and clung together closely, with a mode of bending in, as children\ndo at some danger; overhead the shrunken leaves quivered and rustled\nripely, having many points like stars, and rising and falling\ndelicately, as fingers play sad music. Along the bed of the slanting\nground, all between the stools of wood, there were heaps of dead brown\nleaves, and sheltered mats of lichen, and drifts of spotted stick gone\nrotten, and tufts of rushes here and there, full of fray and feathering.\n\nAll by the hedge ran a little stream, a thing that could barely name\nitself, flowing scarce more than a pint in a minute, because of the\nsunny weather. Yet had this rill little crooks and crannies dark and\nbravely bearded, and a gallant rush through a reeden pipe--the stem of\na flag that was grounded; and here and there divided threads, from the\npoints of a branching stick, into mighty pools of rock (as large as a\ngrown man's hat almost) napped with moss all around the sides and hung\nwith corded grasses. Along and down the tiny banks, and nodding into one\nanother, even across main channel, hung the brown arcade of ferns; some\nwith gold tongues languishing; some with countless ear-drops jerking,\nsome with great quilled ribs uprising and long saws aflapping; others\ncupped, and fanning over with the grace of yielding, even as a hollow\nfountain spread by winds that have lost their way.\n\nDeeply each beyond other, pluming, stooping, glancing, glistening,\nweaving softest pillow lace, coying to the wind and water, when their\nfleeting image danced, or by which their beauty moved,--God has made no\nlovelier thing; and only He takes heed of them.\n\nIt was time to go home to supper now, and I felt very friendly towards\nit, having been hard at work for some hours, with only the voice of the\nlittle rill, and some hares and a pheasant for company. The sun was gone\ndown behind the black wood on the farther cliffs of Bagworthy, and the\nrusset of the tufts and spear-beds was becoming gray, while the greyness\nof the sapling ash grew brown against the sky; the hollow curves of\nthe little stream became black beneath the grasses and the fairy fans\ninnumerable, while outside the hedge our clover was crimping its leaves\nin the dewfall, like the cocked hats of wood-sorrel,--when, thanking God\nfor all this scene, because my love had gifted me with the key to all\nthings lovely, I prepared to follow their example, and to rest from\nlabour.\n\nTherefore I wiped my bill-hook and shearing-knife very carefully, for\nI hate to leave tools dirty; and was doubting whether I should try for\nanother glance at the seven rooks' nests, or whether it would be too\ndark for it. It was now a quarter of an hour mayhap, since I had made\nany chopping noise, because I had been assorting my spars, and tying\nthem in bundles, instead of plying the bill-hook; and the gentle tinkle\nof the stream was louder than my doings. To this, no doubt, I owe my\nlife, which then (without my dreaming it) was in no little jeopardy.\n\nFor, just as I was twisting the bine of my very last faggot, before\ntucking the cleft tongue under, there came three men outside the hedge,\nwhere the western light was yellow; and by it I could see that all three\nof them carried firearms. These men were not walking carelessly, but\nfollowing down the hedge-trough, as if to stalk some enemy: and for a\nmoment it struck me cold to think it was I they were looking for. With\nthe swiftness of terror I concluded that my visits to Glen Doone were\nknown, and now my life was the forfeit.\n\nIt was a most lucky thing for me, that I heard their clothes catch in\nthe brambles, and saw their hats under the rampart of ash, which is made\nby what we call \"splashing,\" and lucky, for me that I stood in a goyal,\nand had the dark coppice behind me. To this I had no time to fly, but\nwith a sort of instinct, threw myself flat in among the thick fern, and\nheld my breath, and lay still as a log. For I had seen the light gleam\non their gun-barrels, and knowing the faults of the neighbourhood, would\nfain avoid swelling their number. Then the three men came to the gap\nin the hedge, where I had been in and out so often; and stood up, and\nlooked in over.\n\nIt is all very well for a man to boast that, in all his life, he has\nnever been frightened, and believes that he never could be so. There\nmay be men of that nature--I will not dare to deny it; only I have\nnever known them. The fright I was now in was horrible, and all my bones\nseemed to creep inside me; when lying there helpless, with only a billet\nand the comb of fern to hide me, in the dusk of early evening, I saw\nthree faces in the gap; and what was worse, three gun-muzzles.\n\n\"Somebody been at work here--\" it was the deep voice of Carver Doone;\n\"jump up, Charlie, and look about; we must have no witnesses.\"\n\n\"Give me a hand behind,\" said Charlie, the same handsome young Doone I\nhad seen that night; \"this bank is too devilish steep for me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, man!\" cried Marwood de Whichehalse, who to my amazement was\nthe third of the number; \"only a hind cutting faggots; and of course he\nhath gone home long ago. Blind man's holiday, as we call it. I can see\nall over the place; and there is not even a rabbit there.\"\n\nAt that I drew my breath again, and thanked God I had gotten my coat on.\n\n\"Squire is right,\" said Charlie, who was standing up high (on a root\nperhaps), \"there is nobody there now, captain; and lucky for the poor\ndevil that he keepeth workman's hours. Even his chopper is gone, I see.\"\n\n\"No dog, no man, is the rule about here, when it comes to coppice work,\"\ncontinued young de Whichehalse; \"there is not a man would dare work\nthere, without a dog to scare the pixies.\"\n\n\"There is a big young fellow upon this farm,\" Carver Doone muttered\nsulkily, \"with whom I have an account to settle, if ever I come across\nhim. He hath a cursed spite to us, because we shot his father. He was\ngoing to bring the lumpers upon us, only he was afeared, last winter.\nAnd he hath been in London lately, for some traitorous job, I doubt.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean that fool, John Ridd,\" answered the young squire; \"a very\nsimple clod-hopper. No treachery in him I warrant; he hath not the head\nfor it. All he cares about is wrestling. As strong as a bull, and with\nno more brains.\"\n\n\"A bullet for that bull,\" said Carver; and I could see the grin on his\nscornful face; \"a bullet for ballast to his brain, the first time I come\nacross him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, captain! I won't have him shot, for he is my old\nschool-fellow, and hath a very pretty sister. But his cousin is of a\ndifferent mould, and ten times as dangerous.\"\n\n\"We shall see, lads, we shall see,\" grumbled the great black-bearded\nman. \"Ill bodes for the fool that would hinder me. But come, let us\nonward. No lingering, or the viper will be in the bush from us. Body and\nsoul, if he give us the slip, both of you shall answer it.\"\n\n\"No fear, captain, and no hurry,\" Charlie answered gallantly, \"would I\nwere as sure of living a twelvemonth as he is of dying within the hour!\nExtreme unction for him in my bullet patch. Remember, I claim to be his\nconfessor, because he hath insulted me.\"\n\n\"Thou art welcome to the job for me,\" said Marwood, as they turned away,\nand kept along the hedge-row; \"I love to meet a man sword to sword; not\nto pop at him from a foxhole.\"\n\nWhat answer was made I could not hear, for by this time the stout ashen\nhedge was between us, and no other gap to be found in it, until at the\nvery bottom, where the corner of the copse was. Yet I was not quit of\ndanger now; for they might come through that second gap, and then would\nbe sure to see me, unless I crept into the uncut thicket, before they\ncould enter the clearing. But in spite of all my fear, I was not wise\nenough to do that. And in truth the words of Carver Doone had filled me\nwith such anger, knowing what I did about him and his pretence to Lorna;\nand the sight of Squire Marwood, in such outrageous company, had so\nmoved my curiosity, and their threats against some unknown person so\naroused my pity, that much of my prudence was forgotten, or at least the\nbetter part of courage, which loves danger at long distance.\n\nTherefore, holding fast my bill-hook, I dropped myself very quietly\ninto the bed of the runnel, being resolved to take my chance of their\nentrance at the corner, where the water dived through the hedge-row. And\nso I followed them down the fence, as gently as a rabbit goes, only I\nwas inside it, and they on the outside; but yet so near that I heard the\nbranches rustle as they pushed them.\n\nPerhaps I had never loved ferns so much as when I came to the end of\nthat little gully, and stooped betwixt two patches of them, now my\nchiefest shelter, for cattle had been through the gap just there, in\nquest of fodder and coolness, and had left but a mound of trodden earth\nbetween me and the outlaws. I mean at least on my left hand (upon which\nside they were), for in front where the brook ran out of the copse was a\ngood stiff hedge of holly. And now I prayed Heaven to lead them straight\non; for if they once turned to their right, through the gap, the muzzles\nof their guns would come almost against my forehead.\n\nI heard them, for I durst not look; and could scarce keep still for\ntrembling--I heard them trampling outside the gap, uncertain which track\nthey should follow. And in that fearful moment, with my soul almost\nlooking out of my body, expecting notice to quit it, what do you think\nI did? I counted the threads in a spider's web, and the flies he had\nlately eaten, as their skeletons shook in the twilight.\n\n\"We shall see him better in there,\" said Carver, in his horrible gruff\nvoice, like the creaking of the gallows chain; \"sit there, behind holly\nhedge, lads, while he cometh down yonder hill; and then our good-evening\nto him; one at his body, and two at his head; and good aim, lest we\nbaulk the devil.\"\n\n\"I tell you, captain, that will not do,\" said Charlie, almost\nwhispering: \"you are very proud of your skill, we know, and can hit a\nlark if you see it: but he may not come until after dark, and we cannot\nbe too nigh to him. This holly hedge is too far away. He crosses down\nhere from Slocomslade, not from Tibbacot, I tell you; but along that\ntrack to the left there, and so by the foreland to Glenthorne, where his\nboat is in the cove. Do you think I have tracked him so many evenings,\nwithout knowing his line to a hair? Will you fool away all my trouble?\"\n\n\"Come then, lad, we will follow thy lead. Thy life for his, if we fail\nof it.\"\n\n\"After me then, right into the hollow; thy legs are growing stiff,\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"So shall thy body be, young man, if thou leadest me astray in this.\"\n\nI heard them stumbling down the hill, which was steep and rocky in that\npart; and peering through the hedge, I saw them enter a covert, by the\nside of the track which Master Stickles followed, almost every evening,\nwhen he left our house upon business. And then I knew who it was they\nwere come on purpose to murder--a thing which I might have guessed long\nbefore, but for terror and cold stupidity.\n\n\"Oh that God,\" I thought for a moment, waiting for my blood to flow; \"Oh\nthat God had given me brains, to meet such cruel dastards according to\ntheir villainy! The power to lie, and the love of it; the stealth to\nspy, and the glory in it; above all, the quiet relish for blood, and joy\nin the death of an enemy--these are what any man must have, to contend\nwith the Doones upon even terms. And yet, I thank God that I have not\nany of these.\"\n\nIt was no time to dwell upon that, only to try, if might be, to prevent\nthe crime they were bound upon. To follow the armed men down the hill\nwould have been certain death to me, because there was no covert there,\nand the last light hung upon it. It seemed to me that my only chance to\nstop the mischief pending was to compass the round of the hill, as fast\nas feet could be laid to ground; only keeping out of sight from the\nvalley, and then down the rocks, and across the brook, to the track from\nSlocombslade: so as to stop the King's messenger from travelling any\nfarther, if only I could catch him there.\n\nAnd this was exactly what I did; and a terrible run I had for it,\nfearing at every step to hear the echo of shots in the valley, and\ndropping down the scrubby rocks with tearing and violent scratching.\nThen I crossed Bagworthy stream, not far below Doone-valley, and\nbreasted the hill towards Slocombslade, with my heart very heavily\npanting. Why Jeremy chose to ride this way, instead of the more direct\none (which would have been over Oare-hill), was more than I could account\nfor: but I had nothing to do with that; all I wanted was to save his\nlife.\n\nAnd this I did by about a minute; and (which was the hardest thing of\nall) with a great horse-pistol at my head as I seized upon his bridle.\n\n\"Jeremy, Jerry,\" was all I could say, being so fearfully short of\nbreath; for I had crossed the ground quicker than any horse could.\n\n\"Spoken just in time, John Ridd!\" cried Master Stickles, still however\npointing the pistol at me: \"I might have known thee by thy size, John.\nWhat art doing here?\"\n\n\"Come to save your life. For God's sake, go no farther. Three men in the\ncovert there, with long guns, waiting for thee.\"\n\n\"Ha! I have been watched of late. That is why I pointed at thee, John.\nBack round this corner, and get thy breath, and tell me all about it. I\nnever saw a man so hurried. I could beat thee now, John.\"\n\nJeremy Stickles was a man of courage, and presence of mind, and much\nresource: otherwise he would not have been appointed for this business;\nnevertheless he trembled greatly when he heard what I had to tell\nhim. But I took good care to keep back the name of young Marwood de\nWhichehalse; neither did I show my knowledge of the other men; for\nreasons of my own not very hard to conjecture.\n\n\"We will let them cool their heels, John Ridd,\" said Jeremy, after\nthinking a little. \"I cannot fetch my musketeers either from Glenthorne\nor Lynmouth, in time to seize the fellows. And three desperate Doones,\nwell-armed, are too many for you and me. One result this attempt will\nhave, it will make us attack them sooner than we had intended. And one\nmore it will have, good John, it will make me thy friend for ever. Shake\nhands my lad, and forgive me freely for having been so cold to thee.\nMayhap, in the troubles coming, it will help thee not a little to have\ndone me this good turn.\"\n\nUpon this he shook me by the hand, with a pressure such as we feel not\noften; and having learned from me how to pass quite beyond view of his\nenemies, he rode on to his duty, whatever it might be. For my part I was\ninclined to stay, and watch how long the three fusiliers would have the\npatience to lie in wait; but seeing less and less use in that, as I\ngrew more and more hungry, I swung my coat about me, and went home to\nPlover's Barrows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nA TROUBLED STATE AND A FOOLISH JOKE\n\n[Illustration: 328.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nStickles took me aside the next day, and opened all his business to me,\nwhether I would or not. But I gave him clearly to understand that he was\nnot to be vexed with me, neither to regard me as in any way dishonest,\nif I should use for my own purpose, or for the benefit of my friends,\nany part of the knowledge and privity thus enforced upon me. To this he\nagreed quite readily; but upon the express provision that I should\ndo nothing to thwart his schemes, neither unfold them to any one; but\notherwise be allowed to act according to my own conscience, and as\nconsisted with the honour of a loyal gentleman--for so he was pleased to\nterm me. Now what he said lay in no great compass and may be summed in\nsmaller still; especially as people know the chief part of it already.\nDisaffection to the King, or rather dislike to his brother James, and\nfear of Roman ascendancy, had existed now for several years, and of late\nwere spreading rapidly; partly through the downright arrogance of\nthe Tory faction, the cruelty and austerity of the Duke of York, the\ncorruption of justice, and confiscation of ancient rights and charters;\npartly through jealousy of the French king, and his potent voice in our\naffairs; and partly (or perhaps one might even say, mainly) through that\nnatural tide in all political channels, which verily moves as if it had\nthe moon itself for its mistress. No sooner is a thing done and fixed,\nbeing set far in advance perhaps of all that was done before (like a new\nmole in the sea), but immediately the waters retire, lest they should\nundo it; and every one says how fine it is, but leaves other people to\nwalk on it. Then after awhile, the vague endless ocean, having retired\nand lain still without a breeze or murmur, frets and heaves again with\nimpulse, or with lashes laid on it, and in one great surge advances over\nevery rampart.\n\nAnd so there was at the time I speak of, a great surge in England, not\nrolling yet, but seething; and one which a thousand Chief Justices,\nand a million Jeremy Stickles, should never be able to stop or turn,\nby stringing up men in front of it; any more than a rope of onions can\nrepulse a volcano. But the worst of it was that this great movement took\na wrong channel at first; not only missing legitimate line, but roaring\nout that the back ditchway was the true and established course of it.\n\nAgainst this rash and random current nearly all the ancient mariners of\nthe State were set; not to allow the brave ship to drift there, though\nsome little boats might try it. For the present there seemed to be\na pause, with no open onset, but people on the shore expecting, each\naccording to his wishes, and the feel of his own finger, whence the rush\nof wind should come which might direct the water.\n\nNow,--to reduce high figures of speech into our own little\nnumerals,--all the towns of Somersetshire and half the towns of\nDevonshire were full of pushing eager people, ready to swallow anything,\nor to make others swallow it. Whether they believed the folly about the\nblack box, and all that stuff, is not for me to say; only one thing\nI know, they pretended to do so, and persuaded the ignorant rustics.\nTaunton, Bridgwater, Minehead, and Dulverton took the lead of the other\ntowns in utterance of their discontent, and threats of what they meant\nto do if ever a Papist dared to climb the Protestant throne of England.\nOn the other hand, the Tory leaders were not as yet under apprehension\nof an immediate outbreak, and feared to damage their own cause by\npremature coercion, for the struggle was not very likely to begin in\nearnest during the life of the present King; unless he should (as some\npeople hoped) be so far emboldened as to make public profession of\nthe faith which he held (if any). So the Tory policy was to watch, not\nindeed permitting their opponents to gather strength, and muster in\narmed force or with order, but being well apprised of all their schemes\nand intended movements, to wait for some bold overt act, and then to\nstrike severely. And as a Tory watchman--or spy, as the Whigs would call\nhim--Jeremy Stickles was now among us; and his duty was threefold.\n\nFirst, and most ostensibly, to see to the levying of poundage in the\nlittle haven of Lynmouth, and farther up the coast, which was now\nbecoming a place of resort for the folk whom we call smugglers, that is\nto say, who land their goods without regard to King's revenue as by\nlaw established. And indeed there had been no officer appointed to take\ntoll, until one had been sent to Minehead, not so very long before.\nThe excise as well (which had been ordered in the time of the Long\nParliament) had been little heeded by the people hereabouts.\n\nSecond, his duty was (though only the Doones had discovered it) to watch\nthose outlaws narrowly, and report of their manners (which were scanty),\ndoings (which were too manifold), reputation (which was execrable), and\npolitics, whether true to the King and the Pope, or otherwise.\n\nJeremy Stickles' third business was entirely political; to learn the\ntemper of our people and the gentle families, to watch the movements of\nthe trained bands (which could not always be trusted), to discover any\ncollecting of arms and drilling of men among us, to prevent (if need\nwere, by open force) any importation of gunpowder, of which there had\nbeen some rumour; in a word, to observe and forestall the enemy.\n\nNow in providing for this last-mentioned service, the Government had\nmade a great mistake, doubtless through their anxiety to escape any\npublic attention. For all the disposable force at their emissary's\ncommand amounted to no more than a score of musketeers, and these\nso divided along the coast as scarcely to suffice for the duty of\nsentinels. He held a commission, it is true, for the employment of the\ntrain-bands, but upon the understanding that he was not to call upon\nthem (except as a last resource), for any political object; although\nhe might use them against the Doones as private criminals, if found\nneedful; and supposing that he could get them.\n\n\"So you see, John,\" he said in conclusion, \"I have more work than tools\nto do it with. I am heartily sorry I ever accepted such a mixed and\nmeagre commission. At the bottom of it lies (I am well convinced) not\nonly the desire to keep things quiet, but the paltry jealousy of the\nmilitary people. Because I am not a Colonel, forsooth, or a Captain in\nHis Majesty's service, it would never do to trust me with a company of\nsoldiers! And yet they would not send either Colonel or Captain, for\nfear of a stir in the rustic mind. The only thing that I can do with\nany chance of success, is to rout out these vile Doone fellows, and burn\ntheir houses over their heads. Now what think you of that, John Ridd?\"\n\n\"Destroy the town of the Doones,\" I said, \"and all the Doones inside it!\nSurely, Jeremy, you would never think of such a cruel act as that!\"\n\n\"A cruel act, John! It would be a mercy for at least three counties. No\ndoubt you folk, who live so near, are well accustomed to them, and would\nmiss your liveliness in coming home after nightfall, and the joy of\nfinding your sheep and cattle right, when you not expected it. But after\nawhile you might get used to the dullness of being safe in your beds,\nand not losing your sisters and sweethearts. Surely, on the whole, it is\nas pleasant not to be robbed as to be robbed.\"\n\n\"I think we should miss them very much,\" I answered after consideration;\nfor the possibility of having no Doones had never yet occurred to me,\nand we all were so thoroughly used to them, and allowed for it in\nour year's reckoning; \"I am sure we should miss them very sadly; and\nsomething worse would come of it.\"\n\n\"Thou art the staunchest of all staunch Tories,\" cried Stickles,\nlaughing, as he shook my hand; \"thou believest in the divine right of\nrobbers, who are good enough to steal thy own fat sheep. I am a jolly\nTory, John, but thou art ten times jollier: oh! the grief in thy face at\nthe thought of being robbed no longer!\"\n\nHe laughed in a very unseemly manner; while I descried nothing to laugh\nabout. For we always like to see our way; and a sudden change upsets us.\nAnd unless it were in the loss of the farm, or the death of the King, or\nof Betty Muxworthy, there was nothing that could so unsettle our minds\nas the loss of the Doones of Bagworthy.\n\nAnd beside all this, I was thinking, of course, and thinking more than\nall the rest, about the troubles that might ensue to my own beloved\nLorna. If an attack of Glen Doone were made by savage soldiers and\nrude train-bands, what might happen, or what might not, to my delicate,\ninnocent darling? Therefore, when Jeremy Stickles again placed the\nmatter before me, commending my strength and courage and skill (to\nflatter me of the highest), and finished by saying that I would be worth\nat least four common men to him, I cut him short as follows:--\n\n\"Master Stickles, once for all, I will have naught to do with it. The\nreason why is no odds of thine, nor in any way disloyal. Only in thy\nplans remember that I will not strike a blow, neither give any counsel,\nneither guard any prisoners.\"\n\n\"Not strike a blow,\" cried Jeremy, \"against thy father's murderers,\nJohn!\"\n\n\"Not a single blow, Jeremy; unless I knew the man who did it, and he\ngloried in his sin. It was a foul and dastard deed, yet not done in cold\nblood; neither in cold blood will I take God's task of avenging it.\"\n\n\"Very well, John,\" answered Master Stickles, \"I know thine obstinacy.\nWhen thy mind is made up, to argue with thee is pelting a rock with\npeppercorns. But thou hast some other reason, lad, unless I am much\nmistaken, over and above thy merciful nature and Christian forgiveness.\nAnyhow, come and see it, John. There will be good sport, I reckon;\nespecially when we thrust our claws into the nest of the ravens. Many\na yeoman will find his daughter, and some of the Porlock lads their\nsweethearts. A nice young maiden, now, for thee, John; if indeed, any--\"\n\n\"No more of this!\" I answered very sternly: \"it is no business of thine,\nJeremy; and I will have no joking upon this matter.\"\n\n\"Good, my lord; so be it. But one thing I tell thee in earnest. We will\nhave thy old double-dealing uncle, Huckaback of Dulverton, and march him\nfirst to assault Doone Castle, sure as my name is Stickles. I hear that\nhe hath often vowed to storm the valley himself, if only he could find a\ndozen musketeers to back him. Now, we will give him chance to do it, and\nprove his loyalty to the King, which lies under some suspicion of late.\"\n\nWith regard to this, I had nothing to say; for it seemed to me very\nreasonable that Uncle Reuben should have first chance of recovering his\nstolen goods, about which he had made such a sad to-do, and promised\nhimself such vengeance. I made bold, however, to ask Master Stickles at\nwhat time he intended to carry out this great and hazardous attempt. He\nanswered that he had several things requiring first to be set in order,\nand that he must make an inland Journey, even as far as Tiverton, and\nperhaps Crediton and Exeter, to collect his forces and ammunition\nfor them. For he meant to have some of the yeomanry as well as of the\ntrained bands, so that if the Doones should sally forth, as perhaps they\nwould, on horseback, cavalry might be there to meet them, and cut them\noff from returning.\n\nAll this made me very uncomfortable, for many and many reasons, the\nchief and foremost being of course my anxiety about Lorna. If the attack\nsucceeded, what was to become of her? Who would rescue her from the\nbrutal soldiers, even supposing that she escaped from the hands of her\nown people, during the danger and ferocity? And in smaller ways, I was\nmuch put out; for instance, who would ensure our corn-ricks, sheep, and\ncattle, ay, and even our fat pigs, now coming on for bacon, against the\nspreading all over the country of unlicensed marauders? The Doones\nhad their rights, and understood them, and took them according to\nprescription, even as the parsons had, and the lords of manors, and the\nKing himself, God save him! But how were these low soldiering fellows\n(half-starved at home very likely, and only too glad of the fat of the\nland, and ready, according to our proverb, to burn the paper they\nfried in), who were they to come hectoring and heroing over us, and\nHeliogabalising, with our pretty sisters to cook for them, and be\nchucked under chin perhaps afterwards? There is nothing England hates\nso much, according to my sense of it, as that fellows taken from\nplough-tail, cart-tail, pot-houses and parish-stocks, should be hoisted\nand foisted upon us (after a few months' drilling, and their lying\nshaped into truckling) as defenders of the public weal, and heroes of\nthe universe.\n\nIn another way I was vexed, moreover--for after all we must consider the\nopinions of our neighbours--namely, that I knew quite well how everybody\nfor ten miles round (for my fame must have been at least that wide,\nafter all my wrestling), would lift up hands and cry out thus--\"Black\nshame on John Ridd, if he lets them go without him!\"\n\nPutting all these things together, as well as many others, which your\nown wits will suggest to you, it is impossible but what you will freely\nacknowledge that this unfortunate John Ridd was now in a cloven stick.\nThere was Lorna, my love and life, bound by her duty to that old\nvil--nay, I mean to her good grandfather, who could now do little\nmischief, and therefore deserved all praise--Lorna bound, at any rate,\nby her womanly feelings, if not by sense of duty, to remain in the thick\ndanger, with nobody to protect her, but everybody to covet her, for\nbeauty and position. Here was all the country roused with violent\nexcitement, at the chance of snapping at the Doones; and not only\ngetting tit for tat; but every young man promising his sweetheart a\ngold chain, and his mother at least a shilling. And here was our own\nmow-yard, better filled than we could remember, and perhaps every sheaf\nin it destined to be burned or stolen, before we had finished the bread\nwe had baked.\n\nAmong all these troubles, there was, however, or seemed to be, one\ncomfort. Tom Faggus returned from London very proudly and very happily,\nwith a royal pardon in black and white, which everybody admired the\nmore, because no one could read a word of it. The Squire himself\nacknowledged cheerfully that he could sooner take fifty purses than read\na single line of it. Some people indeed went so far as to say that the\nparchment was made from a sheep Tom had stolen, and that was why it\nprevaricated so in giving him a character. But I, knowing something by\nthis time, of lawyers, was able to contradict them; affirming that the\nwolf had more than the sheep to do with this matter.\n\nFor, according to our old saying, the three learned professions live by\nroguery on the three parts of a man. The doctor mauls our bodies; the\nparson starves our souls, but the lawyer must be the adroitest knave,\nfor he has to ensnare our minds. Therefore he takes a careful delight in\ncovering his traps and engines with a spread of dead-leaf words, whereof\nhimself knows little more than half the way to spell them.\n\nBut now Tom Faggus, although having wit to gallop away on his strawberry\nmare, with the speed of terror, from lawyers (having paid them with\nmoney too honest to stop), yet fell into a reckless adventure, ere ever\nhe came home, from which any lawyer would have saved him, although he\nought to have needed none beyond common thought for dear Annie. Now I\nam, and ever have been, so vexed about this story that I cannot tell it\npleasantly (as I try to write in general) in my own words and manner.\nTherefore I will let John Fry (whom I have robbed of another story,\nto which he was more entitled, and whom I have robbed of many speeches\n(which he thought very excellent), lest I should grieve any one with his\nlack of education,--the last lack he ever felt, by the bye), now with\nyour good leave, I will allow poor John to tell this tale, in his own\nwords and style; which he has a perfect right to do, having been the\nfirst to tell us. For Squire Faggus kept it close; not trusting even\nAnnie with it (or at least she said so); because no man knows much of\nhis sweetheart's tongue, until she has borne him a child or two.\n\nOnly before John begins his story, this I would say, in duty to him, and\nin common honesty,--that I dare not write down some few of his words,\nbecause they are not convenient, for dialect or other causes; and that I\ncannot find any way of spelling many of the words which I do repeat, so\nthat people, not born on Exmoor, may know how he pronounced them; even\nif they could bring their lips and their legs to the proper attitude.\nAnd in this I speak advisedly; having observed some thousand times that\nthe manner a man has of spreading his legs, and bending his knees,\nor stiffening, and even the way he will set his heel, make all the\ndifference in his tone, and time of casting his voice aright, and power\nof coming home to you.\n\nWe always liked John's stories, not for any wit in them; but because we\nlaughed at the man, rather than the matter. The way he held his head was\nenough, with his chin fixed hard like a certainty (especially during his\nbiggest lie), not a sign of a smile in his lips or nose, but a power of\nnot laughing; and his eyes not turning to anybody, unless somebody had\ntoo much of it (as young girls always do) and went over the brink of\nlaughter. Thereupon it was good to see John Fry; how he looked gravely\nfirst at the laughter, as much as to ask, \"What is it now?\" then if\nthe fool went laughing more, as he or she was sure to do upon that dry\ninquiry, John would look again, to be sure of it, and then at somebody\nelse to learn whether the laugh had company; then if he got another\ngrin, all his mirth came out in glory, with a sudden break; and he wiped\nhis lips, and was grave again.\n\nNow John, being too much encouraged by the girls (of which I could never\nbreak them), came into the house that December evening, with every inch\nof him full of a tale. Annie saw it, and Lizzie, of course; and even I,\nin the gloom of great evils, perceived that John was a loaded gun; but I\ndid not care to explode him. Now nothing primed him so hotly as this: if\nyou wanted to hear all John Fry had heard, the surest of all sure ways\nto it was, to pretend not to care for a word of it.\n\n\"I wor over to Exeford in the morning,\" John began from the\nchimney-corner, looking straight at Annie; \"for to zee a little calve,\nJan, as us cuddn't get thee to lave houze about. Meesus have got a quare\nvancy vor un, from wutt her have heer'd of the brade. Now zit quite,\nwull 'e Miss Luzzie, or a 'wunt goo on no vurder.

If her be, do 'ee want to shutt 'un?'\n\n\"'Thee not knaw!' says Bill Blacksmith, just the zame as I be a tullin\nof it: 'whai, man, us expex Tam Faggus, and zum on us manes to shutt\n'un.'\n\n\"'Shutt 'un wi'out a warrant!' says I: 'sure 'ee knaws better nor thic,\nBill! A man mayn't shutt to another man, wi'out have a warrant, Bill.\nWarship zed so, last taime I zeed un, and nothing to the contrairy.'\n\n\"'Haw, haw!

Shutt 'un, us\nmanes; and shutt 'un, us will--' Whai, Miss Annie, good Lord, whuttiver\nmaks 'ee stear so?'\n\n\"Nothing at all, John,\" our Annie answered; \"only the horrible ferocity\nof that miserable blacksmith.\"\n\n\"That be nayther here nor there,\" John continued, with some wrath at\nhis own interruption: \"Blacksmith knawed whutt the Squire had been; and\nveared to lose his own custom, if Squire tuk to shooin' again. Shutt any\nman I would myzell as intervared wi' my trade laike. 'Lucky for thee,'\nsaid Bill Blacksmith, 'as thee bee'st so shart and fat, Jan.

I answered 'un, wi' a girt cold swat upon me: 'shutt\nme, Bill; and my own waife niver drame of it!'\"\n\nHere John Fry looked round the kitchen; for he had never said anything\nof the kind, I doubt; but now made it part of his discourse, from\nthinking that Mistress Fry was come, as she generally did, to fetch him.\n\n\"Wull done then, Jan Vry,\" said the woman, who had entered quietly, but\nwas only our old Molly. \"Wutt handsome manners thee hast gat, Jan, to\nspake so well of thy waife laike; after arl the laife she leads thee!\"\n\n\"Putt thee pot on the fire, old 'ooman, and bile thee own bakkon,\" John\nanswered her, very sharply: \"nobody no raight to meddle wi' a man's bad\nooman but himzell.

Mark me\nnow, all these charps was good to shutt 'un, as her coom crass the\nwatter; the watter be waide enow there and stony, but no deeper than my\nknee-place.\n\n\"'Thee cas'n goo no vurder,' Bill Blacksmith saith to me: 'nawbody\n'lowed to crass the vord, until such time as Faggus coom; plaise God us\nmay mak sure of 'un.'\n\n\"'Amen, zo be it,' says I; 'God knoweth I be never in any hurry, and\nwould zooner stop nor goo on most taimes.'\n\n\"Wi' that I pulled my vittles out, and zat a horsebarck, atin' of 'em,\nand oncommon good they was. 'Won't us have 'un this taime just,' saith\nTim Potter, as keepeth the bull there; 'and yet I be zorry for 'un. But\na man must kape the law, her must; zo be her can only learn it. And now\npoor Tom will swing as high as the tops of they girt hashes there.'\n\n\"'Just thee kitch 'un virst,' says I; 'maisure rope, wi' the body to\nmaisure by.'\n\n\"'Hurrah! here be another now,' saith Bill Blacksmith, grinning;\n'another coom to help us. What a grave gentleman! A warship of the pace,\nat laste!'\n\n\"For a gentleman, on a cue-ball horse, was coming slowly down the hill\non tother zide of watter, looking at us in a friendly way, and with a\nlong papper standing forth the lining of his coat laike. Horse stapped\nto drink in the watter, and gentleman spak to 'un kindly, and then they\ncoom raight on to ussen, and the gentleman's face wor so long and so\ngrave, us veared 'a wor gooin' to prache to us.\n\n\"'Coort o' King's Bench,' saith one man; 'Checker and Plays,' saith\nanother; 'Spishal Commission, I doubt,' saith Bill Blacksmith; 'backed\nby the Mayor of Taunton.'\n\n\"'Any Justice of the King's Peace, good people, to be found near here?'\nsaid the gentleman, lifting his hat to us, and very gracious in his\nmanner.\n\n\"'Your honour,' saith Bill, with his hat off his head; 'there be sax or\nzeven warships here: arl on 'em very wise 'uns. Squaire Maunder there be\nthe zinnyer.'\n\n\"So the gentleman rode up to Squire Maunder, and raised his cocked hat\nin a manner that took the Squire out of countenance, for he could not do\nthe like of it.\n\n\"'Sir,' said he, 'good and worshipful sir, I am here to claim your\ngood advice and valour; for purposes of justice. I hold His Majesty's\ncommission, to make to cease a notorious rogue, whose name is Thomas\nFaggus.' With that he offered his commission; but Squire Maunder told\nthe truth, that he could not rade even words in print, much less written\nkarakters.* Then the other magistrates rode up, and put their heads\ntogether, how to meet the London gentleman without loss of importance.\nThere wor one of 'em as could rade purty vair, and her made out King's\nmark upon it: and he bowed upon his horse to the gentleman, and he laid\nhis hand on his heart and said, 'Worshipful sir, we, as has the honour\nof His Gracious Majesty's commission, are entirely at your service, and\ncrave instructions from you.'\"\n\n     * Lest John Fry seem to under-rate the erudition of\n     Devonshire magistrates, I venture to offer copy of a letter\n     from a Justice of the Peace to his bookseller, circa 1810\n     A.D., now in my possession:--\n\n    'Sur.\n           'plez to zen me the aks relatting to _A-gustus-paks_,'\n\n    --Ed. of L.D.\n\n    [Emphasized this in original]\n\n\"Then a waving of hats began, and a bowing, and making of legs to wan\nanather, sich as nayver wor zeed afore; but none of 'em arl, for air and\nbrading, cud coom anaigh the gentleman with the long grave face.\n\n\"'Your warships have posted the men right well,' saith he with anather\nbow all round; 'surely that big rogue will have no chance left among so\nmany valiant musketeers. Ha! what see I there, my friend? Rust in the\npan of your gun! That gun would never go off, sure as I am the King's\nCommissioner. And I see another just as bad; and lo, there the\nthird! Pardon me, gentlemen, I have been so used to His Majesty's\nOrdnance-yards. But I fear that bold rogue would ride through all of\nyou, and laugh at your worship's beards, by George.'\n\n\"'But what shall us do?' Squire Maunder axed; 'I vear there be no oil\nhere.'\n\n\"'Discharge your pieces, gentlemen, and let the men do the same; or at\nleast let us try to discharge them, and load again with fresh powder. It\nis the fog of the morning hath spoiled the priming. That rogue is not\nin sight yet: but God knows we must not be asleep with him, or what will\nHis Majesty say to me, if we let him slip once more?'\n\n\"'Excellent, wondrous well said, good sir,' Squire Maunder answered him;\n'I never should have thought of that now. Bill Blacksmith, tell all the\nmen to be ready to shoot up into the air, directly I give the word. Now,\nare you ready there, Bill?'\n\n\"'All ready, your worship,' saith Bill, saluting like a soldier.\n\n\"'Then, one, two, dree, and shutt!' cries Squire Maunder, standing up in\nthe irons of his stirrups.\n\n\"Thereupon they all blazed out, and the noise of it went all round the\nhills; with a girt thick cloud arising, and all the air smelling of\npowder. Before the cloud was gone so much as ten yards on the wind,\nthe gentleman on the cue-bald horse shuts up his face like a pair of\nnut-cracks, as wide as it was long before, and out he pulls two girt\npistols longside of zaddle, and clap'th one to Squire Maunder's head,\nand tother to Sir Richard Blewitt's.\n\n\"'Hand forth your money and all your warrants,' he saith like a clap of\nthunder; 'gentlemen, have you now the wit to apprehend Tom Faggus?'\n\n[Illustration: 339.jpg Hand forth your money]\n\n\"Squire Maunder swore so that he ought to be fined; but he pulled out\nhis purse none the slower for that, and so did Sir Richard Blewitt.\n\n\"'First man I see go to load a gun, I'll gi'e 'un the bullet to do it\nwith,' said Tom; for you see it was him and no other, looking quietly\nround upon all of them. Then he robbed all the rest of their warships,\nas pleasant as might be; and he saith, 'Now, gentlemen, do your duty:\nserve your warrants afore you imprison me'; with that he made them give\nup all the warrants, and he stuck them in the band of his hat, and then\nhe made a bow with it.\n\n\"'Good morning to your warships now, and a merry Christmas all of\nyou! And the merrier both for rich and poor, when gentlemen see their\nalmsgiving. Lest you deny yourselves the pleasure, I will aid your\nwarships. And to save you the trouble of following me, when your guns be\nloaded--this is my strawberry mare, gentlemen, only with a little cream\non her. Gentlemen all, in the name of the King, I thank you.'\n\n\"All this while he was casting their money among the poor folk by the\nhandful; and then he spak kaindly to the red mare, and wor over the back\nof the hill in two zeconds, and best part of two maile away, I reckon,\nafore ever a gun wor loaded.\"*\n\n* The truth of this story is well established by first-rate tradition.\n\n[Illustration: 341.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nTWO FOOLS TOGETHER\n\n[Illustration: 342.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThat story of John Fry's, instead of causing any amusement, gave us\ngreat disquietude; not only because it showed that Tom Faggus could not\nresist sudden temptation and the delight of wildness, but also that we\ngreatly feared lest the King's pardon might be annulled, and all his\nkindness cancelled, by a reckless deed of that sort. It was true (as\nAnnie insisted continually, even with tears, to wear in her arguments)\nthat Tom had not brought away anything, except the warrants, which were\nof no use at all, after receipt of the pardon; neither had he used any\nviolence, except just to frighten people; but could it be established,\neven towards Christmas-time, that Tom had a right to give alms, right\nand left, out of other people's money?\n\nDear Annie appeared to believe that it could; saying that if the rich\ncontinually chose to forget the poor, a man who forced them to remember,\nand so to do good to themselves and to others, was a public benefactor,\nand entitled to every blessing. But I knew, and so Lizzie knew--John Fry\nbeing now out of hearing--that this was not sound argument. For, if it\ncame to that, any man might take the King by the throat, and make him\ncast away among the poor the money which he wanted sadly for Her Grace\nthe Duchess, and the beautiful Countess, of this, and of that. Lizzie,\nof course, knew nothing about His Majesty's diversions, which were not\nfit for a young maid's thoughts; but I now put the form of the argument\nas it occurred to me.\n\nTherefore I said, once for all (and both my sisters always listened when\nI used the deep voice from my chest):\n\n\"Tom Faggus hath done wrong herein; wrong to himself, and to our Annie.\nAll he need have done was to show his pardon, and the magistrates would\nhave rejoiced with him. He might have led a most godly life, and have\nbeen respected by everybody; and knowing how brave Tom is, I thought\nthat he would have done as much. Now if I were in love with a maid\"--I\nput it thus for the sake of poor Lizzie--\"never would I so imperil my\nlife, and her fortune in life along with me, for the sake of a poor\ndiversion. A man's first duty is to the women, who are forced to hang\nupon him\"--\n\n\"Oh, John, not that horrible word,\" cried Annie, to my great surprise,\nand serious interruption; \"oh, John, any word but that!\" And she burst\nforth crying terribly.\n\n\"What word, Lizzie? What does the wench mean?\" I asked, in the saddest\nvexation; seeing no good to ask Annie at all, for she carried on most\ndreadfully.\n\n\"Don't you know, you stupid lout?\" said Lizzie, completing my\nwonderment, by the scorn of her quicker intelligence; \"if you don't\nknow, axe about?\"\n\nAnd with that, I was forced to be content; for Lizzie took Annie in such\na manner (on purpose to vex me, as I could see) with her head drooping\ndown, and her hair coming over, and tears and sobs rising and falling,\nto boot, without either order or reason, that seeing no good for a\nman to do (since neither of them was Lorna), I even went out into the\ncourtyard, and smoked a pipe, and wondered what on earth is the meaning\nof women.\n\nNow in this I was wrong and unreasonable (as all women will\nacknowledge); but sometimes a man is so put out, by the way they take\non about nothing, that he really cannot help thinking, for at least\na minute, that women are a mistake for ever, and hence are for ever\nmistaken. Nevertheless I could not see that any of these great thoughts\nand ideas applied at all to my Lorna; but that she was a different\nbeing; not woman enough to do anything bad, yet enough of a woman for\nman to adore.\n\nAnd now a thing came to pass which tested my adoration pretty sharply,\ninasmuch as I would far liefer faced Carver Doone and his father, nay,\neven the roaring lion himself with his hoofs and flaming nostrils, than\nhave met, in cold blood, Sir Ensor Doone, the founder of all the colony,\nand the fear of the very fiercest.\n\nBut that I was forced to do at this time, and in the manner following.\nWhen I went up one morning to look for my seven rooks' nests, behold\nthere were but six to be seen; for the topmost of them all was gone,\nand the most conspicuous. I looked, and looked, and rubbed my eyes, and\nturned to try them by other sights; and then I looked again; yes, there\ncould be no doubt about it; the signal was made for me to come, because\nmy love was in danger. For me to enter the valley now, during the broad\ndaylight, could have brought no comfort, but only harm to the maiden,\nand certain death to myself. Yet it was more than I could do to keep\naltogether at distance; therefore I ran to the nearest place where I\ncould remain unseen, and watched the glen from the wooded height, for\nhours and hours, impatiently.\n\nHowever, no impatience of mine made any difference in the scene upon\nwhich I was gazing. In the part of the valley which I could see, there\nwas nothing moving, except the water, and a few stolen cows, going sadly\nalong, as if knowing that they had no honest right there. It sank very\nheavily into my heart, with all the beds of dead leaves around it, and\nthere was nothing I cared to do, except blow on my fingers, and long for\nmore wit.\n\nFor a frost was beginning, which made a great difference to Lorna and to\nmyself, I trow; as well as to all the five million people who dwell in\nthis island of England; such a frost as never I saw before,* neither\nhope ever to see again; a time when it was impossible to milk a cow for\nicicles, or for a man to shave some of his beard (as I liked to do for\nLorna's sake, because she was so smooth) without blunting his razor\non hard gray ice. No man could \"keep yatt\" (as we say), even though he\nabandoned his work altogether, and thumped himself, all on the chest and\nthe front, till his frozen hands would have been bleeding except for the\ncold that kept still all his veins.\n\n     * If John Ridd lived until the year 1740 (as so strong a man\n     was bound to do), he must have seen almost a harder frost;\n     and perhaps it put an end to him; for then he would be some\n     fourscore years old. But tradition makes him \"keep yatt,\" as\n     he says, up to fivescore years.--Ed. L.D.\n\nHowever, at present there was no frost, although for a fortnight\nthreatening; and I was too young to know the meaning of the way the dead\nleaves hung, and the worm-casts prickling like women's combs, and\nthe leaden tone upon everything, and the dead weight of the sky. Will\nWatcombe, the old man at Lynmouth, who had been half over the world\nalmost, and who talked so much of the Gulf-stream, had (as I afterwards\ncalled to mind) foretold a very bitter winter this year. But no one\nwould listen to him because there were not so many hips and haws as\nusual; whereas we have all learned from our grandfathers that Providence\nnever sends very hard winters, without having furnished a large supply\nof berries for the birds to feed upon.\n\nIt was lucky for me, while I waited here, that our very best sheep-dog,\nold Watch, had chosen to accompany me that day. For otherwise I must\nhave had no dinner, being unpersuaded, even by that, to quit my survey\nof the valley. However, by aid of poor Watch, I contrived to obtain a\nsupply of food; for I sent him home with a note to Annie fastened upon\nhis chest; and in less than an hour back he came, proud enough to wag\nhis tail off, with his tongue hanging out from the speed of his journey,\nand a large lump of bread and of bacon fastened in a napkin around his\nneck. I had not told my sister, of course, what was toward; for why\nshould I make her anxious?\n\nWhen it grew towards dark, I was just beginning to prepare for my\ncircuit around the hills; but suddenly Watch gave a long low growl; I\nkept myself close as possible, and ordered the dog to be silent, and\npresently saw a short figure approaching from a thickly-wooded hollow on\nthe left side of my hiding-place. It was the same figure I had seen once\nbefore in the moonlight, at Plover's Barrows; and proved, to my great\ndelight, to be the little maid Gwenny Carfax. She started a moment, at\nseeing me, but more with surprise than fear; and then she laid both her\nhands upon mine, as if she had known me for twenty years.\n\n\"Young man,\" she said, \"you must come with me. I was gwain' all the\nway to fetch thee. Old man be dying; and her can't die, or at least her\nwon't, without first considering thee.\"\n\n\"Considering me!\" I cried; \"what can Sir Ensor Doone want with\nconsidering me? Has Mistress Lorna told him?\"\n\n\"All concerning thee, and thy doings; when she knowed old man were so\nnear his end. That vexed he was about thy low blood, a' thought her\nwould come to life again, on purpose for to bate 'ee. But after all,\nthere can't be scarcely such bad luck as that. Now, if her strook thee,\nthou must take it; there be no denaying of un. Fire I have seen afore,\nhot and red, and raging; but I never seen cold fire afore, and it maketh\nme burn and shiver.\"\n\nAnd in truth, it made me both burn and shiver, to know that I must\neither go straight to the presence of Sir Ensor Doone, or give up Lorna,\nonce for all, and rightly be despised by her. For the first time of my\nlife, I thought that she had not acted fairly. Why not leave the old man\nin peace, without vexing him about my affair? But presently I saw again\nthat in this matter she was right; that she could not receive the old\nman's blessing (supposing that he had one to give, which even a worse\nman might suppose), while she deceived him about herself, and the life\nshe had undertaken.\n\nTherefore, with great misgiving of myself, but no ill thought of my\ndarling, I sent Watch home, and followed Gwenny; who led me along very\nrapidly, with her short broad form gliding down the hollow, from which\nshe had first appeared. Here at the bottom, she entered a thicket of\ngray ash stubs and black holly, with rocks around it gnarled with roots,\nand hung with masks of ivy. Here in a dark and lonely corner, with a\npixie ring before it, she came to a narrow door, very brown and solid,\nlooking like a trunk of wood at a little distance. This she opened,\nwithout a key, by stooping down and pressing it, where the threshold met\nthe jamb; and then she ran in very nimbly, but I was forced to be\nbent in two, and even so without comfort. The passage was close and\ndifficult, and as dark as any black pitch; but it was not long (be it as\nit might), and in that there was some comfort. We came out soon at the\nother end, and were at the top of Doone valley. In the chilly dusk air,\nit looked most untempting, especially during that state of mind under\nwhich I was labouring. As we crossed towards the Captain's house, we\nmet a couple of great Doones lounging by the waterside. Gwenny said\nsomething to them, and although they stared very hard at me, they let me\npass without hindrance. It is not too much to say that when the little\nmaid opened Sir Ensor's door, my heart thumped, quite as much with\nterror as with hope of Lorna's presence.\n\nBut in a moment the fear was gone, for Lorna was trembling in my arms,\nand my courage rose to comfort her. The darling feared, beyond all\nthings else, lest I should be offended with her for what she had said to\nher grandfather, and for dragging me into his presence; but I told her\nalmost a falsehood (the first, and the last, that ever I did tell her),\nto wit, that I cared not that much--and showed her the tip of my thumb\nas I said it--for old Sir Ensor, and all his wrath, so long as I had his\ngranddaughter's love.\n\nNow I tried to think this as I said it, so as to save it from being a\nlie; but somehow or other it did not answer, and I was vexed with myself\nboth ways. But Lorna took me by the hand as bravely as she could, and\nled me into a little passage where I could hear the river moaning and\nthe branches rustling.\n\nHere I passed as long a minute as fear ever cheated time of, saying\nto myself continually that there was nothing to be frightened at, yet\ngrowing more and more afraid by reason of so reasoning. At last my Lorna\ncame back very pale, as I saw by the candle she carried, and whispered,\n\"Now be patient, dearest. Never mind what he says to you; neither\nattempt to answer him. Look at him gently and steadfastly, and, if you\ncan, with some show of reverence; but above all things, no compassion;\nit drives him almost mad. Now come; walk very quietly.\"\n\nShe led me into a cold, dark room, rough and very gloomy, although with\ntwo candles burning. I took little heed of the things in it, though I\nmarked that the window was open. That which I heeded was an old man,\nvery stern and comely, with death upon his countenance; yet not lying in\nhis bed, but set upright in a chair, with a loose red cloak thrown over\nhim. Upon this his white hair fell, and his pallid fingers lay in a\nghastly fashion without a sign of life or movement or of the power that\nkept him up; all rigid, calm, and relentless. Only in his great black\neyes, fixed upon me solemnly, all the power of his body dwelt, all the\nlife of his soul was burning.\n\nI could not look at him very nicely, being afeared of the death in his\nface, and most afeared to show it. And to tell the truth, my poor\nblue eyes fell away from the blackness of his, as if it had been my\ncoffin-plate. Therefore I made a low obeisance, and tried not to shiver.\nOnly I groaned that Lorna thought it good manners to leave us two\ntogether.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the old man, and his voice seemed to come from a cavern of\nskeletons; \"are you that great John Ridd?\"\n\n\"John Ridd is my name, your honour,\" was all that I could answer; \"and I\nhope your worship is better.\"\n\n\"Child, have you sense enough to know what you have been doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew right well,\" I answered, \"that I have set mine eyes far\nabove my rank.\"\n\n\"Are you ignorant that Lorna Doone is born of the oldest families\nremaining in North Europe?\"\n\n\"I was ignorant of that, your worship; yet I knew of her high descent\nfrom the Doones of Bagworthy.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes, like fire, probed me whether I was jesting; then\nperceiving how grave I was, and thinking that I could not laugh (as many\npeople suppose of me), he took on himself to make good the deficiency\nwith a very bitter smile.\n\n\"And know you of your own low descent from the Ridds of Oare?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I answered, being as yet unaccustomed to this style of speech,\n\"the Ridds, of Oare, have been honest men twice as long as the Doones\nhave been rogues.\"\n\n\"I would not answer for that, John,\" Sir Ensor replied, very quietly,\nwhen I expected fury. \"If it be so, thy family is the very oldest in\nEurope. Now hearken to me, boy, or clown, or honest fool, or whatever\nthou art; hearken to an old man's words, who has not many hours to live.\nThere is nothing in this world to fear, nothing to revere or trust,\nnothing even to hope for; least of all, is there aught to love.\"\n\n\"I hope your worship is not quite right,\" I answered, with great\nmisgivings; \"else it is a sad mistake for anybody to live, sir.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" he continued, as if I had never spoken, \"though it may seem\nhard for a week or two, like the loss of any other toy, I deprive you of\nnothing, but add to your comfort, and (if there be such a thing) to your\nhappiness, when I forbid you ever to see that foolish child again. All\nmarriage is a wretched farce, even when man and wife belong to the same\nrank of life, have temper well assorted, similar likes and dislikes, and\nabout the same pittance of mind. But when they are not so matched,\nthe farce would become a long, dull tragedy, if anything were worth\nlamenting. There, I have reasoned enough with you; I am not in the habit\nof reasoning. Though I have little confidence in man's honour, I have\nsome reliance in woman's pride. You will pledge your word in Lorna's\npresence never to see or to seek her again; never even to think of her\nmore. Now call her, for I am weary.\"\n\nHe kept his great eyes fixed upon me with their icy fire (as if he\nscorned both life and death), and on his haughty lips some slight\namusement at my trouble; and then he raised one hand (as if I were a\npoor dumb creature), and pointed to the door. Although my heart rebelled\nand kindled at his proud disdain, I could not disobey him freely; but\nmade a low salute, and went straightway in search of Lorna.\n\nI found my love (or not my love; according as now she should behave; for\nI was very desperate, being put upon so sadly); Lorna Doone was crying\nsoftly at a little window, and listening to the river's grief. I laid\nmy heavy arm around her, not with any air of claiming or of forcing\nher thoughts to me, but only just to comfort her, and ask what she was\nthinking of. To my arm she made no answer, neither to my seeking eyes;\nbut to my heart, once for all, she spoke with her own upon it. Not a\nword, nor sound between us; not even a kiss was interchanged; but man,\nor maid, who has ever loved hath learned our understanding.\n\nTherefore it came to pass, that we saw fit to enter Sir Ensor's room in\nthe following manner. Lorna, with her right hand swallowed entirely by\nthe palm of mine, and her waist retired from view by means of my left\narm. All one side of her hair came down, in a way to be remembered, upon\nthe left and fairest part of my favourite otter-skin waistcoat; and\nher head as well would have lain there doubtless, but for the danger\nof walking so. I, for my part, was too far gone to lag behind in the\nmatter; but carried my love bravely, fearing neither death nor hell,\nwhile she abode beside me.\n\nOld Sir Ensor looked much astonished. For forty years he had been obeyed\nand feared by all around him; and he knew that I had feared him vastly,\nbefore I got hold of Lorna. And indeed I was still afraid of him; only\nfor loving Lorna so, and having to protect her.\n\nThen I made him a bow, to the very best of all I had learned both at\nTiverton and in London; after that I waited for him to begin, as became\nhis age and rank in life.\n\n\"Ye two fools!\" he said at last, with a depth of contempt which no words\nmay express; \"ye two fools!\"\n\n\"May it please your worship,\" I answered softly; \"maybe we are not such\nfools as we look. But though we be, we are well content, so long as we\nmay be two fools together.\"\n\n\"Why, John,\" said the old man, with a spark, as of smiling in his eyes;\n\"thou art not altogether the clumsy yokel, and the clod, I took thee\nfor.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, grandfather; oh, dear grandfather,\" cried Lorna, with such zeal\nand flashing, that her hands went forward; \"nobody knows what John Ridd\nis, because he is so modest. I mean, nobody except me, dear.\" And here\nshe turned to me again, and rose upon tiptoe, and kissed me.\n\n\"I have seen a little o' the world,\" said the old man, while I was half\nashamed, although so proud of Lorna; \"but this is beyond all I have\nseen, and nearly all I have heard of. It is more fit for southern\nclimates than for the fogs of Exmoor.\"\n\n\"It is fit for all the world, your worship; with your honour's good\nleave, and will,\" I answered in humility, being still ashamed of it;\n\"when it happens so to people, there is nothing that can stop it, sir.\"\n\nNow Sir Ensor Doone was leaning back upon his brown chair-rail, which\nwas built like a triangle, as in old farmhouses (from one of which it\nhad come, no doubt, free from expense or gratitude); and as I spoke he\ncoughed a little; and he sighed a good deal more; and perhaps his dying\nheart desired to open time again, with such a lift of warmth and hope as\nhe descried in our eyes, and arms. I could not understand him then; any\nmore than a baby playing with his grandfather's spectacles; nevertheless\nI wondered whether, at his time of life, or rather on the brink of\ndeath, he was thinking of his youth and pride.\n\n\"Fools you are; be fools for ever,\" said Sir Ensor Doone, at last; while\nwe feared to break his thoughts, but let each other know our own, with\nlittle ways of pressure; \"it is the best thing I can wish you; boy and\ngirl, be boy and girl, until you have grandchildren.\"\n\nPartly in bitterness he spoke, and partly in pure weariness, and then\nhe turned so as not to see us; and his white hair fell, like a shroud,\naround him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nCOLD COMFORT\n\n[Illustration: 351.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAll things being full of flaw, all things being full of holes, the\nstrength of all things is in shortness. If Sir Ensor Doone had dwelled\nfor half an hour upon himself, and an hour perhaps upon Lorna and me,\nwe must both have wearied of him, and required change of air. But now\nI longed to see and know a great deal more about him, and hoped that he\nmight not go to Heaven for at least a week or more. However, he was too\ngood for this world (as we say of all people who leave it); and I verily\nbelieve his heart was not a bad one, after all.\n\nEvil he had done, no doubt, as evil had been done to him; yet how many\nhave done evil, while receiving only good! Be that as it may; and not\nvexing a question (settled for ever without our votes), let us own that\nhe was, at least, a brave and courteous gentleman.\n\nAnd his loss aroused great lamentation, not among the Doones alone, and\nthe women they had carried off, but also of the general public, and many\neven of the magistrates, for several miles round Exmoor. And this,\nnot only from fear lest one more wicked might succeed him (as appeared\nindeed too probable), but from true admiration of his strong will, and\nsympathy with his misfortunes.\n\nI will not deceive any one, by saying that Sir Ensor Doone gave (in so\nmany words) his consent to my resolve about Lorna. This he never did,\nexcept by his speech last written down; from which as he mentioned\ngrandchildren, a lawyer perhaps might have argued it. Not but what he\nmay have meant to bestow on us his blessing; only that he died next day,\nwithout taking the trouble to do it.\n\nHe called indeed for his box of snuff, which was a very high thing to\ntake; and which he never took without being in very good humour, at\nleast for him. And though it would not go up his nostrils, through the\nfailure of his breath, he was pleased to have it there, and not to think\nof dying.\n\n\"Will your honour have it wiped?\" I asked him very softly, for the\nbrown appearance of it spoiled (to my idea) his white mostacchio; but\nhe seemed to shake his head; and I thought it kept his spirits up. I had\nnever before seen any one do, what all of us have to do some day; and it\ngreatly kept my spirits down, although it did not so very much frighten\nme.\n\nFor it takes a man but a little while, his instinct being of death\nperhaps, at least as much as of life (which accounts for his slaying his\nfellow men so, and every other creature), it does not take a man very\nlong to enter into another man's death, and bring his own mood to suit\nit. He knows that his own is sure to come; and nature is fond of the\npractice. Hence it came to pass that I, after easing my mother's fears,\nand seeing a little to business, returned (as if drawn by a polar\nneedle) to the death-bed of Sir Ensor.\n\nThere was some little confusion, people wanting to get away, and people\ntrying to come in, from downright curiosity (of all things the most\nhateful), and others making great to-do, and talking of their own time\nto come, telling their own age, and so on. But every one seemed to\nthink, or feel, that I had a right to be there; because the women took\nthat view of it. As for Carver and Counsellor, they were minding their\nown affairs, so as to win the succession; and never found it in their\nbusiness (at least so long as I was there) to come near the dying man.\n\nHe, for his part, never asked for any one to come near him, not even\na priest, nor a monk or friar; but seemed to be going his own way,\npeaceful, and well contented. Only the chief of the women said that from\nhis face she believed and knew that he liked to have me at one side of\nhis bed, and Lorna upon the other. An hour or two ere the old man died,\nwhen only we two were with him, he looked at us both very dimly and\nsoftly, as if he wished to do something for us, but had left it now too\nlate. Lorna hoped that he wanted to bless us; but he only frowned at\nthat, and let his hand drop downward, and crooked one knotted finger.\n\n\"He wants something out of the bed, dear,\" Lorna whispered to me; \"see\nwhat it is, upon your side, there.\"\n\nI followed the bent of his poor shrunken hand, and sought among the\npilings; and there I felt something hard and sharp, and drew it forth\nand gave it to him. It flashed, like the spray of a fountain upon us, in\nthe dark winter of the room. He could not take it in his hand, but let\nit hang, as daisies do; only making Lorna see that he meant her to have\nit.\n\n\"Why, it is my glass necklace!\" Lorna cried, in great surprise; \"my\nnecklace he always promised me; and from which you have got the ring,\nJohn. But grandfather kept it, because the children wanted to pull it\nfrom my neck. May I have it now, dear grandfather? Not unless you wish,\ndear.\"\n\nDarling Lorna wept again, because the old man could not tell her (except\nby one very feeble nod) that she was doing what he wished. Then she gave\nto me the trinket, for the sake of safety; and I stowed it in my breast.\nHe seemed to me to follow this, and to be well content with it.\n\nBefore Sir Ensor Doone was buried, the greatest frost of the century\nhad set in, with its iron hand, and step of stone, on everything. How\nit came is not my business, nor can I explain it; because I never have\nwatched the skies; as people now begin to do, when the ground is not to\ntheir liking. Though of all this I know nothing, and less than nothing I\nmay say (because I ought to know something); I can hear what people tell\nme; and I can see before my eyes.\n\nThe strong men broke three good pickaxes, ere they got through the hard\nbrown sod, streaked with little maps of gray where old Sir Ensor was to\nlie, upon his back, awaiting the darkness of the Judgment-day. It was in\nthe little chapel-yard; I will not tell the name of it; because we are\nnow such Protestants, that I might do it an evil turn; only it was the\nlittle place where Lorna's Aunt Sabina lay.\n\nHere was I, remaining long, with a little curiosity; because some people\ntold me plainly that I must be damned for ever by a Papist funeral; and\nhere came Lorna, scarcely breathing through the thick of stuff around\nher, yet with all her little breath steaming on the air, like frost.\n\nI stood apart from the ceremony, in which of course I was not entitled,\neither by birth or religion, to bear any portion; and indeed it would\nhave been wiser in me to have kept away altogether; for now there was no\none to protect me among those wild and lawless men; and both Carver\nand the Counsellor had vowed a fearful vengeance on me, as I heard from\nGwenny. They had not dared to meddle with me while the chief lay dying;\nnor was it in their policy, for a short time after that, to endanger\ntheir succession by an open breach with Lorna, whose tender age and\nbeauty held so many of the youths in thrall.\n\nThe ancient outlaw's funeral was a grand and moving sight; more perhaps\nfrom the sense of contrast than from that of fitness. To see those dark\nand mighty men, inured to all of sin and crime, reckless both of man and\nGod, yet now with heads devoutly bent, clasped hands, and downcast eyes,\nfollowing the long black coffin of their common ancestor, to the place\nwhere they must join him when their sum of ill was done; and to see the\nfeeble priest chanting, over the dead form, words the living would\nhave laughed at, sprinkling with his little broom drops that could not\npurify; while the children, robed in white, swung their smoking censers\nslowly over the cold and twilight grave; and after seeing all, to ask,\nwith a shudder unexpressed, \"Is this the end that God intended for a man\nso proud and strong?\"\n\nNot a tear was shed upon him, except from the sweetest of all sweet\neyes; not a sigh pursued him home. Except in hot anger, his life had\nbeen cold, and bitter, and distant; and now a week had exhausted all\nthe sorrow of those around him, a grief flowing less from affection than\nfear. Aged men will show his tombstone; mothers haste with their infants\nby it; children shrink from the name upon it, until in time his history\nshall lapse and be forgotten by all except the great Judge and God.\n\nAfter all was over, I strode across the moors very sadly; trying to\nkeep the cold away by virtue of quick movement. Not a flake of snow had\nfallen yet; all the earth was caked and hard, with a dry brown crust\nupon it; all the sky was banked with darkness, hard, austere, and\nfrowning. The fog of the last three weeks was gone, neither did any\nrime remain; but all things had a look of sameness, and a kind of furzy\ncolour. It was freezing hard and sharp, with a piercing wind to back it;\nand I had observed that the holy water froze upon Sir Ensor's coffin.\n\nOne thing struck me with some surprise, as I made off for our fireside\n(with a strong determination to heave an ash-tree up the chimney-place),\nand that was how the birds were going, rather than flying as they used\nto fly. All the birds were set in one direction, steadily journeying\nwestward, not with any heat of speed, neither flying far at once; but\nall (as if on business bound), partly running, partly flying, partly\nfluttering along; silently, and without a voice, neither pricking head\nnor tail. This movement of the birds went on, even for a week or more;\nevery kind of thrushes passed us, every kind of wild fowl, even plovers\nwent away, and crows, and snipes and wood-cocks. And before half the\nfrost was over, all we had in the snowy ditches were hares so tame that\nwe could pat them; partridges that came to hand, with a dry noise in\ntheir crops; heath-poults, making cups of snow; and a few poor hopping\nredwings, flipping in and out the hedge, having lost the power to fly.\nAnd all the time their great black eyes, set with gold around them,\nseemed to look at any man, for mercy and for comfort.\n\nAnnie took a many of them, all that she could find herself, and all the\nboys would bring her; and she made a great hutch near the fire, in the\nback-kitchen chimney-place. Here, in spite of our old Betty (who sadly\nwanted to roast them), Annie kept some fifty birds, with bread and milk,\nand raw chopped meat, and all the seed she could think of, and lumps of\nrotten apples, placed to tempt them, in the corners. Some got on, and\nsome died off; and Annie cried for all that died, and buried them under\nthe woodrick; but, I do assure you, it was a pretty thing to see, when\nshe went to them in the morning. There was not a bird but knew her well,\nafter one day of comforting; and some would come to her hand, and sit,\nand shut one eye, and look at her. Then she used to stroke their heads,\nand feel their breasts, and talk to them; and not a bird of them all was\nthere but liked to have it done to him. And I do believe they would eat\nfrom her hand things unnatural to them, lest she should be grieved and\nhurt by not knowing what to do for them. One of them was a noble bird,\nsuch as I never had seen before, of very fine bright plumage, and larger\nthan a missel-thrush. He was the hardest of all to please: and yet he\ntried to do his best. I have heard since then, from a man who knows all\nabout birds, and beasts, and fishes, that he must have been a Norwegian\nbird, called in this country a Roller, who never comes to England but in\nthe most tremendous winters.\n\nAnother little bird there was, whom I longed to welcome home, and\nprotect from enemies, a little bird no native to us, but than any\nnative dearer. But lo, in the very night which followed old Sir Ensor's\nfuneral, such a storm of snow began as never have I heard nor read of,\nneither could have dreamed it. At what time of night it first began is\nmore than I can say, at least from my own knowledge, for we all went to\nbed soon after supper, being cold and not inclined to talk. At that time\nthe wind was moaning sadly, and the sky as dark as a wood, and the straw\nin the yard swirling round and round, and the cows huddling into the\ngreat cowhouse, with their chins upon one another. But we, being blinder\nthan they, I suppose, and not having had a great snow for years, made\nno preparation against the storm, except that the lambing ewes were in\nshelter.\n\nIt struck me, as I lay in bed, that we were acting foolishly; for an\nancient shepherd had dropped in and taken supper with us, and foretold a\nheavy fall and great disaster to live stock. He said that he had known\na frost beginning, just as this had done, with a black east wind, after\ndays of raw cold fog, and then on the third night of the frost, at this\nvery time of year (to wit on the 15th of December) such a snow set in\nas killed half of the sheep and many even of the red deer and the forest\nponies. It was three-score years agone,* he said; and cause he had to\nremember it, inasmuch as two of his toes had been lost by frost-nip,\nwhile he dug out his sheep on the other side of the Dunkery. Hereupon\nmother nodded at him, having heard from her father about it, and how\nthree men had been frozen to death, and how badly their stockings came\noff from them.\n\n     * The frost of 1625.\n\nRemembering how the old man looked, and his manner of listening to the\nwind and shaking his head very ominously (when Annie gave him a glass\nof schnapps), I grew quite uneasy in my bed, as the room got colder and\ncolder; and I made up my mind, if it only pleased God not to send the\nsnow till the morning, that every sheep, and horse, and cow, ay, and\neven the poultry, should be brought in snug, and with plenty to eat, and\nfodder enough to roast them.\n\nAlas what use of man's resolves, when they come a day too late; even if\nthey may avail a little, when they are most punctual!\n\nIn the bitter morning I arose, to follow out my purpose, knowing the\ntime from the force of habit, although the room was so dark and gray.\nAn odd white light was on the rafters, such as I never had seen before;\nwhile all the length of the room was grisly, like the heart of a mouldy\noat-rick. I went to the window at once, of course; and at first I could\nnot understand what was doing outside of it. It faced due east (as I may\nhave said), with the walnut-tree partly sheltering it; and generally I\ncould see the yard, and the woodrick, and even the church beyond.\n\nBut now, half the lattice was quite blocked up, as if plastered with\ngray lime; and little fringes, like ferns, came through, where the\njoining of the lead was; and in the only undarkened part, countless dots\ncame swarming, clustering, beating with a soft, low sound, then gliding\ndown in a slippery manner, not as drops of rain do, but each distinct\nfrom his neighbour. Inside the iron frame (which fitted, not to say too\ncomfortably, and went along the stonework), at least a peck of snow had\nentered, following its own bend and fancy; light as any cobweb.\n\nWith some trouble, and great care, lest the ancient frame should yield,\nI spread the lattice open; and saw at once that not a moment must be\nlost, to save our stock. All the earth was flat with snow, all the air\nwas thick with snow; more than this no man could see, for all the world\nwas snowing.\n\nI shut the window and dressed in haste; and when I entered the kitchen,\nnot even Betty, the earliest of all early birds, was there. I raked the\nashes together a little, just to see a spark of warmth; and then set\nforth to find John Fry, Jem Slocombe, and Bill Dadds. But this was\neasier thought than done; for when I opened the courtyard door, I\nwas taken up to my knees at once, and the power of the drifting cloud\nprevented sight of anything. However, I found my way to the woodrick,\nand there got hold of a fine ash-stake, cut by myself not long ago. With\nthis I ploughed along pretty well, and thundered so hard at John\nFry's door, that he thought it was the Doones at least, and cocked his\nblunderbuss out of the window.\n\nJohn was very loth to come down, when he saw the meaning of it; for he\nvalued his life more than anything else; though he tried to make out\nthat his wife was to blame. But I settled his doubts by telling him,\nthat I would have him on my shoulder naked, unless he came in five\nminutes; not that he could do much good, but because the other men would\nbe sure to skulk, if he set them the example. With spades, and shovels,\nand pitch-forks, and a round of roping, we four set forth to dig out the\nsheep; and the poor things knew that it was high time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nTHE GREAT WINTER\n\n[Illustration: 358.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nIt must have snowed most wonderfully to have made that depth of covering\nin about eight hours. For one of Master Stickles' men, who had been out\nall the night, said that no snow began to fall until nearly midnight.\nAnd here it was, blocking up the doors, stopping the ways, and the water\ncourses, and making it very much worse to walk than in a saw-pit newly\nused. However, we trudged along in a line; I first, and the other men\nafter me; trying to keep my track, but finding legs and strength not\nup to it. Most of all, John Fry was groaning; certain that his time was\ncome, and sending messages to his wife, and blessings to his children.\nFor all this time it was snowing harder than it ever had snowed before,\nso far as a man might guess at it; and the leaden depth of the sky came\ndown, like a mine turned upside down on us. Not that the flakes were\nso very large; for I have seen much larger flakes in a shower of March,\nwhile sowing peas; but that there was no room between them, neither any\nrelaxing, nor any change of direction.\n\nWatch, like a good and faithful dog, followed us very cheerfully,\nleaping out of the depth, which took him over his back and ears already,\neven in the level places; while in the drifts he might have sunk to any\ndistance out of sight, and never found his way up again. However, we\nhelped him now and then, especially through the gaps and gateways; and\nso after a deal of floundering, some laughter, and a little swearing, we\ncame all safe to the lower meadow, where most of our flock was hurdled.\n\nBut behold, there was no flock at all! None, I mean, to be seen\nanywhere; only at one corner of the field, by the eastern end, where the\nsnow drove in, a great white billow, as high as a barn, and as broad as\na house. This great drift was rolling and curling beneath the violent\nblast, tufting and combing with rustling swirls, and carved (as in\npatterns of cornice) where the grooving chisel of the wind swept round.\nEver and again the tempest snatched little whiffs from the channelled\nedges, twirled them round and made them dance over the chime of the\nmonster pile, then let them lie like herring-bones, or the seams of sand\nwhere the tide has been. And all the while from the smothering sky, more\nand more fiercely at every blast, came the pelting, pitiless arrows,\nwinged with murky white, and pointed with the barbs of frost.\n\nBut although for people who had no sheep, the sight was a very fine one\n(so far at least as the weather permitted any sight at all); yet for us,\nwith our flock beneath it, this great mount had but little charm. Watch\nbegan to scratch at once, and to howl along the sides of it; he knew\nthat his charge was buried there, and his business taken from him. But\nwe four men set to in earnest, digging with all our might and main,\nshovelling away at the great white pile, and fetching it into the\nmeadow. Each man made for himself a cave, scooping at the soft, cold\nflux, which slid upon him at every stroke, and throwing it out behind\nhim, in piles of castled fancy. At last we drove our tunnels in (for\nwe worked indeed for the lives of us), and all converging towards the\nmiddle, held our tools and listened.\n\nThe other men heard nothing at all; or declared that they heard nothing,\nbeing anxious now to abandon the matter, because of the chill in their\nfeet and knees. But I said, \"Go, if you choose all of you. I will work\nit out by myself, you pie-crusts,\" and upon that they gripped their\nshovels, being more or less of Englishmen; and the least drop of English\nblood is worth the best of any other when it comes to lasting out.\n\nBut before we began again, I laid my head well into the chamber; and\nthere I hears a faint \"ma-a-ah,\" coming through some ells of snow, like\na plaintive, buried hope, or a last appeal. I shouted aloud to cheer him\nup, for I knew what sheep it was, to wit, the most valiant of all the\nwethers, who had met me when I came home from London, and been so glad\nto see me. And then we all fell to again; and very soon we hauled\nhim out. Watch took charge of him at once, with an air of the noblest\npatronage, lying on his frozen fleece, and licking all his face and\nfeet, to restore his warmth to him. Then fighting Tom jumped up at once,\nand made a little butt at Watch, as if nothing had ever ailed him, and\nthen set off to a shallow place, and looked for something to nibble at.\n\nFurther in, and close under the bank, where they had huddled themselves\nfor warmth, we found all the rest of the poor sheep packed, as closely\nas if they were in a great pie. It was strange to observe how their\nvapour and breath, and the moisture exuding from their wool had scooped,\nas it were, a coved room for them, lined with a ribbing of deep yellow\nsnow. Also the churned snow beneath their feet was as yellow as gamboge.\nTwo or three of the weaklier hoggets were dead, from want of air, and\nfrom pressure; but more than three-score were as lively as ever; though\ncramped and stiff for a little while.\n\n\"However shall us get 'em home?\" John Fry asked in great dismay, when\nwe had cleared about a dozen of them; which we were forced to do very\ncarefully, so as not to fetch the roof down. \"No manner of maning to\ndraive 'un, drough all they girt driftnesses.\"\n\n\"You see to this place, John,\" I replied, as we leaned on our shovels\na moment, and the sheep came rubbing round us; \"let no more of them out\nfor the present; they are better where they be. Watch, here boy, keep\nthem!\"\n\nWatch came, with his little scut of a tail cocked as sharp as duty, and\nI set him at the narrow mouth of the great snow antre. All the sheep\nsidled away, and got closer, that the other sheep might be bitten first,\nas the foolish things imagine; whereas no good sheep-dog even so much as\nlips a sheep to turn it.\n\nThen of the outer sheep (all now snowed and frizzled like a lawyer's\nwig) I took the two finest and heaviest, and with one beneath my right\narm, and the other beneath my left, I went straight home to the upper\nsheppey, and set them inside and fastened them. Sixty and six I took\nhome in that way, two at a time on each journey; and the work grew harder\nand harder each time, as the drifts of the snow were deepening. No other\nman should meddle with them; I was resolved to try my strength against\nthe strength of the elements; and try it I did, ay, and proved it. A\ncertain fierce delight burned in me, as the struggle grew harder; but\nrather would I die than yield; and at last I finished it. People talk of\nit to this day; but none can tell what the labour was, who have not felt\nthat snow and wind.\n\n[Illustration: 361.jpg None can tell what the labour was]\n\nOf the sheep upon the mountain, and the sheep upon the western farm, and\nthe cattle on the upper barrows, scarcely one in ten was saved; do what\nwe would for them, and this was not through any neglect (now that our\nwits were sharpened), but from the pure impossibility of finding them\nat all. That great snow never ceased a moment for three days and nights;\nand then when all the earth was filled, and the topmost hedges were\nunseen, and the trees broke down with weight (wherever the wind had not\nlightened them), a brilliant sun broke forth and showed the loss of all\nour customs.\n\nAll our house was quite snowed up, except where we had purged a way, by\ndint of constant shovellings. The kitchen was as dark and darker than\nthe cider-cellar, and long lines of furrowed scollops ran even up to the\nchimney-stacks. Several windows fell right inwards, through the weight\nof the snow against them; and the few that stood, bulged in, and bent\nlike an old bruised lanthorn. We were obliged to cook by candle-light;\nwe were forced to read by candle-light; as for baking, we could not do\nit, because the oven was too chill; and a load of faggots only brought a\nlittle wet down the sides of it.\n\nFor when the sun burst forth at last upon that world of white, what he\nbrought was neither warmth, nor cheer, nor hope of softening; only a\nclearer shaft of cold, from the violet depths of sky. Long-drawn alleys\nof white haze seemed to lead towards him, yet such as he could not come\ndown, with any warmth remaining. Broad white curtains of the frost-fog\nlooped around the lower sky, on the verge of hill and valley, and above\nthe laden trees. Only round the sun himself, and the spot of heaven he\nclaimed, clustered a bright purple-blue, clear, and calm, and deep.\n\nThat night such a frost ensued as we had never dreamed of, neither read\nin ancient books, or histories of Frobisher. The kettle by the fire\nfroze, and the crock upon the hearth-cheeks; many men were killed, and\ncattle rigid in their head-ropes. Then I heard that fearful sound, which\nnever I had heard before, neither since have heard (except during that\nsame winter), the sharp yet solemn sound of trees burst open by the\nfrost-blow. Our great walnut lost three branches, and has been dying\never since; though growing meanwhile, as the soul does. And the ancient\noak at the cross was rent, and many score of ash trees. But why should\nI tell all this? the people who have not seen it (as I have) will only\nmake faces, and disbelieve; till such another frost comes; which perhaps\nmay never be.\n\nThis terrible weather kept Tom Faggus from coming near our house for\nweeks; at which indeed I was not vexed a quarter so much as Annie was;\nfor I had never half approved of him, as a husband for my sister; in\nspite of his purchase from Squire Bassett, and the grant of the Royal\npardon. It may be, however, that Annie took the same view of my love for\nLorna, and could not augur well of it; but if so, she held her peace,\nthough I was not so sparing. For many things contributed to make me less\ngood-humoured now than my real nature was; and the very least of all\nthese things would have been enough to make some people cross, and rude,\nand fractious. I mean the red and painful chapping of my face and hands,\nfrom working in the snow all day, and lying in the frost all night. For\nbeing of a fair complexion, and a ruddy nature, and pretty plump withal,\nand fed on plenty of hot victuals, and always forced by my mother to sit\nnearer the fire than I wished, it was wonderful to see how the cold ran\nrevel on my cheeks and knuckles. And I feared that Lorna (if it should\never please God to stop the snowing) might take this for a proof of low\nand rustic blood and breeding.\n\nAnd this I say was the smallest thing; for it was far more serious that\nwe were losing half our stock, do all we would to shelter them. Even the\nhorses in the stables (mustered all together for the sake of breath and\nsteaming) had long icicles from their muzzles, almost every morning.\nBut of all things the very gravest, to my apprehension, was the\nimpossibility of hearing, or having any token of or from my loved one.\nNot that those three days alone of snow (tremendous as it was) could\nhave blocked the country so; but that the sky had never ceased, for more\nthan two days at a time, for full three weeks thereafter, to pour fresh\npiles of fleecy mantle; neither had the wind relaxed a single day from\nshaking them. As a rule, it snowed all day, cleared up at night, and\nfroze intensely, with the stars as bright as jewels, earth spread out in\nlustrous twilight, and the sounds in the air as sharp and crackling as\nartillery; then in the morning, snow again; before the sun could come to\nhelp.\n\nIt mattered not what way the wind was. Often and often the vanes went\nround, and we hoped for change of weather; the only change was that it\nseemed (if possible) to grow colder. Indeed, after a week or so, the\nwind would regularly box the compass (as the sailors call it) in the\ncourse of every day, following where the sun should be, as if to make\na mock of him. And this of course immensely added to the peril of the\ndrifts; because they shifted every day; and no skill or care might learn\nthem.\n\nI believe it was on Epiphany morning, or somewhere about that period,\nwhen Lizzie ran into the kitchen to me, where I was thawing my\ngoose-grease, with the dogs among the ashes--the live dogs, I mean, not\nthe iron ones, for them we had given up long ago,--and having caught\nme, by way of wonder (for generally I was out shoveling long before my\n\"young lady\" had her nightcap off), she positively kissed me, for the\nsake of warming her lips perhaps, or because she had something proud to\nsay.\n\n\"You great fool, John,\" said my lady, as Annie and I used to call her,\non account of her airs and graces; \"what a pity you never read, John!\"\n\n\"Much use, I should think, in reading!\" I answered, though pleased with\nher condescension; \"read, I suppose, with roof coming in, and only this\nchimney left sticking out of the snow!\"\n\n\"The very time to read, John,\" said Lizzie, looking grander; \"our worst\ntroubles are the need, whence knowledge can deliver us.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" I cried out; \"are you parson or clerk? Whichever you are,\ngood-morning.\"\n\nThereupon I was bent on my usual round (a very small one nowadays), but\nEliza took me with both hands, and I stopped of course; for I could not\nbear to shake the child, even in play, for a moment, because her back\nwas tender. Then she looked up at me with her beautiful eyes, so large,\nunhealthy and delicate, and strangely shadowing outward, as if to spread\ntheir meaning; and she said,--\n\n\"Now, John, this is no time to joke. I was almost frozen in bed last\nnight; and Annie like an icicle. Feel how cold my hands are. Now, will\nyou listen to what I have read about climates ten times worse than this;\nand where none but clever men can live?\"\n\n\"Impossible for me to listen now, I have hundreds of things to see to;\nbut I will listen after breakfast to your foreign climates, child. Now\nattend to mother's hot coffee.\"\n\nShe looked a little disappointed, but she knew what I had to do; and\nafter all she was not so utterly unreasonable; although she did\nread books. And when I had done my morning's work, I listened to her\npatiently; and it was out of my power to think that all she said was\nfoolish.\n\nFor I knew common sense pretty well, by this time, whether it happened\nto be my own, or any other person's, if clearly laid before me. And\nLizzie had a particular way of setting forth very clearly whatever she\nwished to express and enforce. But the queerest part of it all was this,\nthat if she could but have dreamed for a moment what would be the first\napplication made me by of her lesson, she would rather have bitten her\ntongue off than help me to my purpose.\n\nShe told me that in the Arctic Regions, as they call some places, a long\nway north, where the Great Bear lies all across the heavens, and no\nsun is up, for whole months at a time, and yet where people will go\nexploring, out of pure contradiction, and for the sake of novelty, and\nlove of being frozen--that here they always had such winters as we were\nhaving now. It never ceased to freeze, she said; and it never ceased to\nsnow; except when it was too cold; and then all the air was choked with\nglittering spikes; and a man's skin might come off of him, before he\ncould ask the reason. Nevertheless the people there (although the snow\nwas fifty feet deep, and all their breath fell behind them frozen, like\na log of wood dropped from their shoulders), yet they managed to\nget along, and make the time of the year to each other, by a little\ncleverness. For seeing how the snow was spread, lightly over everything,\ncovering up the hills and valleys, and the foreskin of the sea, they\ncontrived a way to crown it, and to glide like a flake along. Through\nthe sparkle of the whiteness, and the wreaths of windy tossings, and\nthe ups and downs of cold, any man might get along with a boat on either\nfoot, to prevent his sinking.\n\nShe told me how these boats were made; very strong and very light,\nof ribs with skin across them; five feet long, and one foot wide; and\nturned up at each end, even as a canoe is. But she did not tell me, nor\ndid I give it a moment's thought myself, how hard it was to walk upon\nthem without early practice. Then she told me another thing equally\nuseful to me; although I would not let her see how much I thought about\nit. And this concerned the use of sledges, and their power of gliding,\nand the lightness of their following; all of which I could see at once,\nthrough knowledge of our own farm-sleds; which we employ in lieu of\nwheels, used in flatter districts. When I had heard all this from her, a\nmere chit of a girl as she was, unfit to make a snowball even, or to fry\nsnow pancakes, I looked down on her with amazement, and began to wish a\nlittle that I had given more time to books.\n\nBut God shapes all our fitness, and gives each man his meaning, even as\nhe guides the wavering lines of snow descending. Our Eliza was meant for\nbooks; our dear Annie for loving and cooking; I, John Ridd, for sheep,\nand wrestling, and the thought of Lorna; and mother to love all three\nof us, and to make the best of her children. And now, if I must tell\nthe truth, as at every page I try to do (though God knows it is hard\nenough), I had felt through all this weather, though my life was\nLorna's, something of a satisfaction in so doing duty to my kindest and\nbest of mothers, and to none but her. For (if you come to think of it)\na man's young love is very pleasant, very sweet, and tickling; and takes\nhim through the core of heart; without his knowing how or why. Then he\ndwells upon it sideways, without people looking, and builds up all sorts\nof fancies, growing hot with working so at his own imaginings. So his\nlove is a crystal Goddess, set upon an obelisk; and whoever will not bow\nthe knee (yet without glancing at her), the lover makes it a sacred rite\neither to kick or to stick him. I am not speaking of me and Lorna, but\nof common people.\n\nThen (if you come to think again) lo!--or I will not say lo! for no one\ncan behold it--only feel, or but remember, what a real mother is. Ever\nloving, ever soft, ever turning sin to goodness, vices into virtues;\nblind to all nine-tenths of wrong; through a telescope beholding (though\nherself so nigh to them) faintest decimal of promise, even in her vilest\nchild. Ready to thank God again, as when her babe was born to her;\nleaping (as at kingdom-come) at a wandering syllable of Gospel for her\nlost one.\n\nAll this our mother was to us, and even more than all of this; and hence\nI felt a pride and joy in doing my sacred duty towards her, now that the\nweather compelled me. And she was as grateful and delighted as if she\nhad no more claim upon me than a stranger's sheep might have. Yet from\ntime to time I groaned within myself and by myself, at thinking of\nmy sad debarment from the sight of Lorna, and of all that might have\nhappened to her, now she had no protection.\n\nTherefore, I fell to at once, upon that hint from Lizzie, and being used\nto thatching-work, and the making of traps, and so on, before very long\nI built myself a pair of strong and light snow-shoes, framed with ash\nand ribbed of withy, with half-tanned calf-skin stretched across, and\nan inner sole to support my feet. At first I could not walk at all, but\nfloundered about most piteously, catching one shoe in the other, and\nboth of them in the snow-drifts, to the great amusement of the girls,\nwho were come to look at me. But after a while I grew more expert,\ndiscovering what my errors were, and altering the inclination of the\nshoes themselves, according to a print which Lizzie found in a book of\nadventures. And this made such a difference, that I crossed the farmyard\nand came back again (though turning was the worst thing of all) without\nso much as falling once, or getting my staff entangled.\n\nBut oh, the aching of my ankles, when I went to bed that night; I was\nforced to help myself upstairs with a couple of mopsticks! and I rubbed\nthe joints with neatsfoot oil, which comforted them greatly. And likely\nenough I would have abandoned any further trial, but for Lizzie's\nridicule, and pretended sympathy; asking if the strong John Ridd would\nhave old Betty to lean upon. Therefore I set to again, with a fixed\nresolve not to notice pain or stiffness, but to warm them out of me.\nAnd sure enough, before dark that day, I could get along pretty freely;\nespecially improving every time, after leaving off and resting. The\nastonishment of poor John Fry, Bill Dadds, and Jem Slocombe, when they\nsaw me coming down the hill upon them, in the twilight, where they were\nclearing the furze rick and trussing it for cattle, was more than I\ncan tell you; because they did not let me see it, but ran away with one\naccord, and floundered into a snowdrift. They believed, and so did every\none else (especially when I grew able to glide along pretty rapidly),\nthat I had stolen Mother Melldrum's sieves, on which she was said to fly\nover the foreland at midnight every Saturday.\n\nUpon the following day, I held some council with my mother; not liking\nto go without her permission, yet scarcely daring to ask for it. But\nhere she disappointed me, on the right side of disappointment; saying\nthat she had seen my pining (which she never could have done; because\nI had been too hard at work), and rather than watch me grieving so,\nfor somebody or other, who now was all in all to me, I might go upon my\ncourse, and God's protection go with me! At this I was amazed, because\nit was not at all like mother; and knowing how well I had behaved, ever\nsince the time of our snowing up, I was a little moved to tell her that\nshe could not understand me. However my sense of duty kept me, and my\nknowledge of the catechism, from saying such a thing as that, or even\nthinking twice of it. And so I took her at her word, which she was\nnot prepared for; and telling her how proud I was of her trust in\nProvidence, and how I could run in my new snow-shoes, I took a short\npipe in my mouth, and started forth accordingly.\n\n[Illustration: 368.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nNOT TOO SOON\n\n[Illustration: 369.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nWhen I started on my road across the hills and valleys (which now were\npretty much alike), the utmost I could hope to do was to gain the crest\nof hills, and look into the Doone Glen. Hence I might at least descry\nwhether Lorna still was safe, by the six nests still remaining, and the\nview of the Captain's house. When I was come to the open country, far\nbeyond the sheltered homestead, and in the full brunt of the wind, the\nkeen blast of the cold broke on me, and the mighty breadth of snow. Moor\nand highland, field and common, cliff and vale, and watercourse, over\nall the rolling folds of misty white were flung. There was nothing\nsquare or jagged left, there was nothing perpendicular; all the rugged\nlines were eased, and all the breaches smoothly filled. Curves, and\nmounds, and rounded heavings, took the place of rock and stump; and all\nthe country looked as if a woman's hand had been on it.\n\n[Illustration: 370.jpg Open country]\n\nThrough the sparkling breadth of white, which seemed to glance my eyes\naway, and outside the humps of laden trees, bowing their backs like a\nwoodman, I contrived to get along, half-sliding and half-walking, in\nplaces where a plain-shodden man must have sunk, and waited freezing\ntill the thaw should come to him. For although there had been such\nviolent frost, every night, upon the snow, the snow itself, having never\nthawed, even for an hour, had never coated over. Hence it was as soft\nand light as if all had fallen yesterday. In places where no drift had\nbeen, but rather off than on to them, three feet was the least of\ndepth; but where the wind had chased it round, or any draught led like a\nfunnel, or anything opposed it; there you might very safely say that\nit ran up to twenty feet, or thirty, or even fifty, and I believe some\ntimes a hundred.\n\nAt last I got to my spy-hill (as I had begun to call it), although I\nnever should have known it but for what it looked on. And even to\nknow this last again required all the eyes of love, soever sharp\nand vigilant. For all the beautiful Glen Doone (shaped from out\nthe mountains, as if on purpose for the Doones, and looking in the\nsummer-time like a sharp cut vase of green) now was besnowed half up\nthe sides, and at either end so, that it was more like the white basins\nwherein we boil plum-puddings. Not a patch of grass was there, not\na black branch of a tree; all was white; and the little river flowed\nbeneath an arch of snow; if it managed to flow at all.\n\nNow this was a great surprise to me; not only because I believed Glen\nDoone to be a place outside all frost, but also because I thought\nperhaps that it was quite impossible to be cold near Lorna. And now it\nstruck me all at once that perhaps her ewer was frozen (as mine had been\nfor the last three weeks, requiring embers around it), and perhaps her\nwindow would not shut, any more than mine would; and perhaps she wanted\nblankets. This idea worked me up to such a chill of sympathy, that\nseeing no Doones now about, and doubting if any guns would go off, in\nthis state of the weather, and knowing that no man could catch me up\n(except with shoes like mine), I even resolved to slide the cliffs, and\nbravely go to Lorna.\n\nIt helped me much in this resolve, that the snow came on again, thick\nenough to blind a man who had not spent his time among it, as I had done\nnow for days and days. Therefore I took my neatsfoot oil, which now was\nclogged like honey, and rubbed it hard into my leg-joints, so far as\nI could reach them. And then I set my back and elbows well against a\nsnowdrift, hanging far adown the cliff, and saying some of the Lord's\nPrayer, threw myself on Providence. Before there was time to think or\ndream, I landed very beautifully upon a ridge of run-up snow in a quiet\ncorner. My good shoes, or boots, preserved me from going far beneath it;\nthough one of them was sadly strained, where a grub had gnawed the ash,\nin the early summer-time. Having set myself aright, and being in good\nspirits, I made boldly across the valley (where the snow was furrowed\nhard), being now afraid of nobody.\n\nIf Lorna had looked out of the window she would not have known me, with\nthose boots upon my feet, and a well-cleaned sheepskin over me, bearing\nmy own (J.R.) in red, just between my shoulders, but covered now in\nsnow-flakes. The house was partly drifted up, though not so much as ours\nwas; and I crossed the little stream almost without knowing that it was\nunder me. At first, being pretty safe from interference from the other\nhuts, by virtue of the blinding snow and the difficulty of walking, I\nexamined all the windows; but these were coated so with ice, like ferns\nand flowers and dazzling stars, that no one could so much as guess what\nmight be inside of them. Moreover I was afraid of prying narrowly into\nthem, as it was not a proper thing where a maiden might be; only I\nwanted to know just this, whether she were there or not.\n\nTaking nothing by this movement, I was forced, much against my will, to\nventure to the door and knock, in a hesitating manner, not being sure\nbut what my answer might be the mouth of a carbine. However it was not\nso, for I heard a pattering of feet and a whispering going on, and then\na shrill voice through the keyhole, asking, \"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Only me, John Ridd,\" I answered; upon which I heard a little laughter,\nand a little sobbing, or something that was like it; and then the door\nwas opened about a couple of inches, with a bar behind it still; and\nthen the little voice went on,--\n\n\"Put thy finger in, young man, with the old ring on it. But mind thee,\nif it be the wrong one, thou shalt never draw it back again.\"\n\nLaughing at Gwenny's mighty threat, I showed my finger in the opening;\nupon which she let me in, and barred the door again like lightning.\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this, Gwenny?\" I asked, as I slipped\nabout on the floor, for I could not stand there firmly with my great\nsnow-shoes on.\n\n\"Maning enough, and bad maning too,\" the Cornish girl made answer. \"Us be\nshut in here, and starving, and durstn't let anybody in upon us. I wish\nthou wer't good to ate, young man: I could manage most of thee.\"\n\nI was so frightened by her eyes, full of wolfish hunger, that I could\nonly say \"Good God!\" having never seen the like before. Then drew I\nforth a large piece of bread, which I had brought in case of accidents,\nand placed it in her hands. She leaped at it, as a starving dog leaps at\nsight of his supper, and she set her teeth in it, and then withheld\nit from her lips, with something very like an oath at her own vile\ngreediness; and then away round the corner with it, no doubt for her\nyoung mistress. I meanwhile was occupied, to the best of my ability, in\ntaking my snow-shoes off, yet wondering much within myself why Lorna did\nnot come to me.\n\nBut presently I knew the cause, for Gwenny called me, and I ran, and\nfound my darling quite unable to say so much as, \"John, how are you?\"\nBetween the hunger and the cold, and the excitement of my coming, she\nhad fainted away, and lay back on a chair, as white as the snow around\nus. In betwixt her delicate lips, Gwenny was thrusting with all her\nstrength the hard brown crust of the rye-bread, which she had snatched\nfrom me so.\n\n\"Get water, or get snow,\" I said; \"don't you know what fainting is, you\nvery stupid child?\"\n\n\"Never heerd on it, in Cornwall,\" she answered, trusting still to the\nbread; \"be un the same as bleeding?\"\n\n\"It will be directly, if you go on squeezing away with that crust so.\nEat a piece: I have got some more. Leave my darling now to me.\"\n\nHearing that I had some more, the starving girl could resist no longer,\nbut tore it in two, and had swallowed half before I had coaxed my Lorna\nback to sense, and hope, and joy, and love.\n\n\"I never expected to see you again. I had made up my mind to die, John;\nand to die without your knowing it.\"\n\nAs I repelled this fearful thought in a manner highly fortifying, the\ntender hue flowed back again into her famished cheeks and lips, and a\nsofter brilliance glistened from the depth of her dark eyes. She gave me\none little shrunken hand, and I could not help a tear for it.\n\n\"After all, Mistress Lorna,\" I said, pretending to be gay, for a smile\nmight do her good; \"you do not love me as Gwenny does; for she even\nwanted to eat me.\"\n\n\"And shall, afore I have done, young man,\" Gwenny answered laughing;\n\"you come in here with they red chakes, and make us think o' sirloin.\"\n\n\"Eat up your bit of brown bread, Gwenny. It is not good enough for\nyour mistress. Bless her heart, I have something here such as she never\ntasted the like of, being in such appetite. Look here, Lorna; smell it\nfirst. I have had it ever since Twelfth Day, and kept it all the time\nfor you. Annie made it. That is enough to warrant it good cooking.\"\n\nAnd then I showed my great mince-pie in a bag of tissue paper, and I\ntold them how the mince-meat was made of golden pippins finely shred,\nwith the undercut of the sirloin, and spice and fruit accordingly and\nfar beyond my knowledge. But Lorna would not touch a morsel until she\nhad thanked God for it, and given me the kindest kiss, and put a piece\nin Gwenny's mouth.\n\nI have eaten many things myself, with very great enjoyment, and keen\nperception of their merits, and some thanks to God for them. But I never\ndid enjoy a thing, that had found its way between my own lips, half, or\neven a quarter as much as I now enjoyed beholding Lorna, sitting\nproudly upwards (to show that she was faint no more) entering into\nthat mince-pie, and moving all her pearls of teeth (inside her little\nmouth-place) exactly as I told her. For I was afraid lest she should be\ntoo fast in going through it, and cause herself more damage so, than she\ngot of nourishment. But I had no need to fear at all, and Lorna could\nnot help laughing at me for thinking that she had no self-control.\n\nSome creatures require a deal of food (I myself among the number), and\nsome can do with a very little; making, no doubt, the best of it. And I\nhave often noticed that the plumpest and most perfect women never eat so\nhard and fast as the skinny and three-cornered ones. These last be often\nashamed of it, and eat most when the men be absent. Hence it came to\npass that Lorna, being the loveliest of all maidens, had as much as she\ncould do to finish her own half of pie; whereas Gwenny Carfax (though\ngenerous more than greedy), ate up hers without winking, after finishing\nthe brown loaf; and then I begged to know the meaning of this state of\nthings.\n\n\"The meaning is sad enough,\" said Lorna; \"and I see no way out of it. We\nare both to be starved until I let them do what they like with me.\n\n\"That is to say until you choose to marry Carver Doone, and be slowly\nkilled by him?\"\n\n\"Slowly! No, John, quickly. I hate him so intensely, that less than a\nweek would kill me.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of that,\" said Gwenny; \"oh, she hates him nicely then; but\nnot half so much as I do.\"\n\nI told them that this state of things could be endured no longer, on\nwhich point they agreed with me, but saw no means to help it. For\neven if Lorna could make up her mind to come away with me and live at\nPlover's Barrows farm, under my good mother's care, as I had urged so\noften, behold the snow was all around us, heaped as high as mountains,\nand how could any delicate maiden ever get across it?\n\nThen I spoke with a strange tingle upon both sides of my heart, knowing\nthat this undertaking was a serious one for all, and might burn our farm\ndown,--\n\n\"If I warrant to take you safe, and without much fright or hardship,\nLorna, will you come with me?\"\n\n\"To be sure I will, dear,\" said my beauty, with a smile and a glance to\nfollow it; \"I have small alternative, to starve, or go with you, John.\"\n\n\"Gwenny, have you courage for it? Will you come with your young\nmistress?\"\n\n\"Will I stay behind?\" cried Gwenny, in a voice that settled it. And so\nwe began to arrange about it; and I was much excited. It was useless\nnow to leave it longer; if it could be done at all, it could not be too\nquickly done. It was the Counsellor who had ordered, after all other\nschemes had failed, that his niece should have no food until she would\nobey him. He had strictly watched the house, taking turns with Carver,\nto ensure that none came nigh it bearing food or comfort. But this\nevening, they had thought it needless to remain on guard; and it\nwould have been impossible, because themselves were busy offering high\nfestival to all the valley, in right of their own commandership. And\nGwenny said that nothing made her so nearly mad with appetite as\nthe account she received from a woman of all the dishes preparing.\nNevertheless she had answered bravely,--\n\n\"Go and tell the Counsellor, and go and tell the Carver, who sent you to\nspy upon us, that we shall have a finer dish than any set before them.\"\nAnd so in truth they did, although so little dreaming it; for no Doone\nthat was ever born, however much of a Carver, might vie with our Annie\nfor mince-meat.\n\nNow while we sat reflecting much, and talking a good deal more, in spite\nof all the cold--for I never was in a hurry to go, when I had Lorna with\nme--she said, in her silvery voice, which always led me so along, as if\nI were a slave to a beautiful bell,--\n\n\"Now, John, we are wasting time, dear. You have praised my hair, till it\ncurls with pride, and my eyes till you cannot see them, even if they are\nbrown diamonds which I have heard for the fiftieth time at least; though\nI never saw such a jewel. Don't you think it is high time to put on your\nsnow-shoes, John?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered, \"'till we have settled something more. I was\nso cold when I came in; and now I am as warm as a cricket. And so are\nyou, you lively soul; though you are not upon my hearth yet.\"\n\n\"Remember, John,\" said Lorna, nestling for a moment to me; \"the severity\nof the weather makes a great difference between us. And you must never\ntake advantage.\"\n\n\"I quite understand all that, dear. And the harder it freezes the\nbetter, while that understanding continues. Now do try to be serious.\"\n\n\"I try to be serious! And I have been trying fifty times, and could\nnot bring you to it, John! Although I am sure the situation, as the\nCounsellor says at the beginning of a speech, the situation, to say the\nleast, is serious enough for anything. Come, Gwenny, imitate him.\"\n\nGwenny was famed for her imitation of the Counsellor making a speech;\nand she began to shake her hair, and mount upon a footstool; but I\nreally could not have this, though even Lorna ordered it. The truth\nwas that my darling maiden was in such wild spirits, at seeing me so\nunexpected, and at the prospect of release, and of what she had never\nknown, quiet life and happiness, that like all warm and loving natures,\nshe could scarce control herself.\n\n\"Come to this frozen window, John, and see them light the stack-fire.\nThey will little know who looks at them. Now be very good, John. You\nstay in that corner, dear, and I will stand on this side; and try to\nbreathe yourself a peep-hole through the lovely spears and banners. Oh,\nyou don't know how to do it. I must do it for you. Breathe three times,\nlike that, and that; and then you rub it with your fingers, before it\nhas time to freeze again.\"\n\nAll this she did so beautifully, with her lips put up like cherries, and\nher fingers bent half back, as only girls can bend them, and her little\nwaist thrown out against the white of the snowed-up window, that I made\nher do it three times over; and I stopped her every time and let it\nfreeze again, that so she might be the longer. Now I knew that all her\nlove was mine, every bit as much as mine was hers; yet I must have her\nto show it, dwelling upon every proof, lengthening out all certainty.\nPerhaps the jealous heart is loath to own a life worth twice its own. Be\nthat as it may, I know that we thawed the window nicely.\n\nAnd then I saw, far down the stream (or rather down the bed of it, for\nthere was no stream visible), a little form of fire arising, red, and\ndark, and flickering. Presently it caught on something, and went upward\nboldly; and then it struck into many forks, and then it fell, and rose\nagain.\n\n\"Do you know what all that is, John?\" asked Lorna, smiling cleverly at\nthe manner of my staring.\n\n\"How on earth should I know? Papists burn Protestants in the flesh; and\nProtestants burn Papists in effigy, as we mock them. Lorna, are they\ngoing to burn any one to-night?\"\n\n\"No, you dear. I must rid you of these things. I see that you are\nbigoted. The Doones are firing Dunkery beacon, to celebrate their new\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"But how could they bring it here through the snow? If they have\nsledges, I can do nothing.\"\n\n\"They brought it before the snow began. The moment poor grandfather was\ngone, even before his funeral, the young men, having none to check them,\nbegan at once upon it. They had always borne a grudge against it; not\nthat it ever did them harm; but because it seemed so insolent. 'Can't a\ngentleman go home, without a smoke behind him?' I have often heard them\nsaying. And though they have done it no serious harm, since they threw\nthe firemen on the fire, many, many years ago, they have often promised\nto bring it here for their candle; and now they have done it. Ah, now\nlook! The tar is kindled.\"\n\nThough Lorna took it so in joke, I looked upon it very gravely, knowing\nthat this heavy outrage to the feelings of the neighbourhood would cause\nmore stir than a hundred sheep stolen, or a score of houses sacked. Not\nof course that the beacon was of the smallest use to any one, neither\nstopped anybody from stealing, nay, rather it was like the parish knell,\nwhich begins when all is over, and depresses all the survivors; yet\nI knew that we valued it, and were proud, and spoke of it as a mighty\ninstitution; and even more than that, our vestry had voted, within\nthe last two years, seven shillings and six-pence to pay for it, in\nproportion with other parishes. And one of the men who attended to\nit, or at least who was paid for doing so, was our Jem Slocombe's\ngrandfather.\n\nHowever, in spite of all my regrets, the fire went up very merrily,\nblazing red and white and yellow, as it leaped on different things.\nAnd the light danced on the snow-drifts with a misty lilac hue. I was\nastonished at its burning in such mighty depths of snow; but Gwenny said\nthat the wicked men had been three days hard at work, clearing, as it\nwere, a cock-pit, for their fire to have its way. And now they had a\nmighty pile, which must have covered five land-yards square, heaped up\nto a goodly height, and eager to take fire.\n\nIn this I saw great obstacle to what I wished to manage. For when this\npyramid should be kindled thoroughly, and pouring light and blazes\nround, would not all the valley be like a white room full of candles?\nThinking thus, I was half inclined to abide my time for another night:\nand then my second thoughts convinced me that I would be a fool in this.\nFor lo, what an opportunity! All the Doones would be drunk, of course,\nin about three hours' time, and getting more and more in drink as the\nnight went on. As for the fire, it must sink in about three hours or\nmore, and only cast uncertain shadows friendly to my purpose. And then\nthe outlaws must cower round it, as the cold increased on them, helping\nthe weight of the liquor; and in their jollity any noise would be\ncheered as a false alarm. Most of all, and which decided once for all my\naction,--when these wild and reckless villains should be hot with ardent\nspirits, what was door, or wall, to stand betwixt them and my Lorna?\n\nThis thought quickened me so much that I touched my darling reverently,\nand told her in a few short words how I hoped to manage it.\n\n\"Sweetest, in two hours' time, I shall be again with you. Keep the bar\nup, and have Gwenny ready to answer any one. You are safe while they are\ndining, dear, and drinking healths, and all that stuff; and before they\nhave done with that, I shall be again with you. Have everything you care\nto take in a very little compass, and Gwenny must have no baggage. I\nshall knock loud, and then wait a little; and then knock twice, very\nsoftly.\"\n\nWith this I folded her in my arms; and she looked frightened at me; not\nhaving perceived her danger; and then I told Gwenny over again what I\nhad told her mistress: but she only nodded her head and said, \"Young\nman, go and teach thy grandmother.\"\n\n[Illustration: 378.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nBROUGHT HOME AT LAST\n\n[Illustration: 379.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nTo my great delight I found that the weather, not often friendly to\nlovers, and lately seeming so hostile, had in the most important matter\ndone me a signal service. For when I had promised to take my love from\nthe power of those wretches, the only way of escape apparent lay\nthrough the main Doone-gate. For though I might climb the cliffs myself,\nespecially with the snow to aid me, I durst not try to fetch Lorna up\nthem, even if she were not half-starved, as well as partly frozen;\nand as for Gwenny's door, as we called it (that is to say, the little\nentrance from the wooded hollow), it was snowed up long ago to the level\nof the hills around. Therefore I was at my wit's end how to get them\nout; the passage by the Doone-gate being long, and dark, and difficult,\nand leading to such a weary circuit among the snowy moors and hills.\n\nBut now, being homeward-bound by the shortest possible track, I slipped\nalong between the bonfire and the boundary cliffs, where I found a caved\nway of snow behind a sort of avalanche: so that if the Doones had been\nkeeping watch (which they were not doing, but revelling), they could\nscarcely have discovered me. And when I came to my old ascent, where I\nhad often scaled the cliff and made across the mountains, it struck me\nthat I would just have a look at my first and painful entrance, to wit,\nthe water-slide. I never for a moment imagined that this could help me\nnow; for I never had dared to descend it, even in the finest weather;\nstill I had a curiosity to know what my old friend was like, with so\nmuch snow upon him. But, to my very great surprise, there was scarcely\nany snow there at all, though plenty curling high overhead from the\ncliff, like bolsters over it. Probably the sweeping of the north-east\nwind up the narrow chasm had kept the showers from blocking it,\nalthough the water had no power under the bitter grip of frost. All my\nwater-slide was now less a slide than path of ice; furrowed where the\nwaters ran over fluted ridges; seamed where wind had tossed and combed\nthem, even while congealing; and crossed with little steps wherever the\nfreezing torrent lingered. And here and there the ice was fibred with\nthe trail of sludge-weed, slanting from the side, and matted, so as to\nmake resting-place.\n\nLo it was easy track and channel, as if for the very purpose made, down\nwhich I could guide my sledge with Lorna sitting in it. There were only\ntwo things to be feared; one lest the rolls of snow above should fall in\nand bury us; the other lest we should rush too fast, and so be carried\nheadlong into the black whirlpool at the bottom, the middle of which was\nstill unfrozen, and looking more horrible by the contrast. Against this\ndanger I made provision, by fixing a stout bar across; but of the other\nwe must take our chance, and trust ourselves to Providence.\n\nI hastened home at my utmost speed, and told my mother for God's sake\nto keep the house up till my return, and to have plenty of fire blazing,\nand plenty of water boiling, and food enough hot for a dozen people, and\nthe best bed aired with the warming-pan. Dear mother smiled softly at my\nexcitement, though her own was not much less, I am sure, and enhanced by\nsore anxiety. Then I gave very strict directions to Annie, and praised\nher a little, and kissed her; and I even endeavoured to flatter Eliza,\nlest she should be disagreeable.\n\nAfter this I took some brandy, both within and about me; the former,\nbecause I had sharp work to do; and the latter in fear of whatever might\nhappen, in such great cold, to my comrades. Also I carried some other\nprovisions, grieving much at their coldness: and then I went to the\nupper linhay, and took our new light pony-sledd, which had been made\nalmost as much for pleasure as for business; though God only knows how\nour girls could have found any pleasure in bumping along so. On the\nsnow, however, it ran as sweetly as if it had been made for it; yet I\ndurst not take the pony with it; in the first place, because his hoofs\nwould break through the ever-shifting surface of the light and piling\nsnow; and secondly, because these ponies, coming from the forest, have a\ndreadful trick of neighing, and most of all in frosty weather.\n\nTherefore I girded my own body with a dozen turns of hay-rope, twisting\nboth the ends in under at the bottom of my breast, and winding the hay\non the skew a little, that the hempen thong might not slip between, and\nso cut me in the drawing. I put a good piece of spare rope in the sledd,\nand the cross-seat with the back to it, which was stuffed with our\nown wool, as well as two or three fur coats; and then, just as I was\nstarting, out came Annie, in spite of the cold, panting for fear of\nmissing me, and with nothing on her head, but a lanthorn in one hand.\n\n\"Oh, John, here is the most wonderful thing! Mother has never shown it\nbefore; and I can't think how she could make up her mind. She had\ngotten it in a great well of a cupboard, with camphor, and spirits, and\nlavender. Lizzie says it is a most magnificent sealskin cloak, worth\nfifty pounds, or a farthing.\"\n\n\"At any rate it is soft and warm,\" said I, very calmly flinging it into\nthe bottom of the sledd. \"Tell mother I will put it over Lorna's feet.\"\n\n\"Lorna's feet! Oh, you great fool,\" cried Annie, for the first time\nreviling me; \"over her shoulders; and be proud, you very stupid John.\"\n\n\"It is not good enough for her feet,\" I answered, with strong emphasis;\n\"but don't tell mother I said so, Annie. Only thank her very kindly.\"\n\nWith that I drew my traces hard, and set my ashen staff into the snow,\nand struck out with my best foot foremost (the best one at snow-shoes, I\nmean), and the sledd came after me as lightly as a dog might follow; and\nAnnie, with the lanthorn, seemed to be left behind and waiting like a\npretty lamp-post.\n\nThe full moon rose as bright behind me as a paten of pure silver,\ncasting on the snow long shadows of the few things left above, burdened\nrock, and shaggy foreland, and the labouring trees. In the great white\ndesolation, distance was a mocking vision; hills looked nigh, and\nvalleys far; when hills were far and valleys nigh. And the misty breath\nof frost, piercing through the ribs of rock, striking to the pith of\ntrees, creeping to the heart of man, lay along the hollow places, like a\nserpent sloughing. Even as my own gaunt shadow (travestied as if I were\nthe moonlight's daddy-longlegs), went before me down the slope; even\nI, the shadow's master, who had tried in vain to cough, when coughing\nbrought good liquorice, felt a pressure on my bosom, and a husking in my\nthroat.\n\nHowever, I went on quietly, and at a very tidy speed; being only too\nthankful that the snow had ceased, and no wind as yet arisen. And from\nthe ring of low white vapour girding all the verge of sky, and from the\nrosy blue above, and the shafts of starlight set upon a quivering bow,\nas well as from the moon itself and the light behind it, having learned\nthe signs of frost from its bitter twinges, I knew that we should have\na night as keen as ever England felt. Nevertheless, I had work enough to\nkeep me warm if I managed it. The question was, could I contrive to save\nmy darling from it?\n\nDaring not to risk my sledd by any fall from the valley-cliffs, I\ndragged it very carefully up the steep incline of ice, through the\nnarrow chasm, and so to the very brink and verge where first I had seen\nmy Lorna, in the fishing days of boyhood. As I then had a trident fork,\nfor sticking of the loaches, so I now had a strong ash stake, to lay\nacross from rock to rock, and break the speed of descending. With this I\nmoored the sledd quite safe, at the very lip of the chasm, where all was\nnow substantial ice, green and black in the moonlight; and then I set\noff up the valley, skirting along one side of it.\n\nThe stack-fire still was burning strongly, but with more of heat than\nblaze; and many of the younger Doones were playing on the verge of it,\nthe children making rings of fire, and their mothers watching them. All\nthe grave and reverend warriors having heard of rheumatism, were inside\nof log and stone, in the two lowest houses, with enough of candles\nburning to make our list of sheep come short.\n\nAll these I passed, without the smallest risk or difficulty, walking up\nthe channel of drift which I spoke of once before. And then I crossed,\nwith more of care, and to the door of Lorna's house, and made the sign,\nand listened, after taking my snow-shoes off.\n\nBut no one came, as I expected, neither could I espy a light. And I\nseemed to hear a faint low sound, like the moaning of the snow-wind.\nThen I knocked again more loudly, with a knocking at my heart: and\nreceiving no answer, set all my power at once against the door. In a\nmoment it flew inwards, and I glided along the passage with my feet\nstill slippery. There in Lorna's room I saw, by the moonlight flowing\nin, a sight which drove me beyond sense.\n\n[Illustration: 383.jpg Set all my power against the door]\n\nLorna was behind a chair, crouching in the corner, with her hands up,\nand a crucifix, or something that looked like it. In the middle of the\nroom lay Gwenny Carfax, stupid, yet with one hand clutching the ankle of\na struggling man. Another man stood above my Lorna, trying to draw the\nchair away. In a moment I had him round the waist, and he went out of\nthe window with a mighty crash of glass; luckily for him that window had\nno bars like some of them. Then I took the other man by the neck; and he\ncould not plead for mercy. I bore him out of the house as lightly as I\nwould bear a baby, yet squeezing his throat a little more than I fain\nwould do to an infant. By the bright moonlight I saw that I carried\nMarwood de Whichehalse. For his father's sake I spared him, and because\nhe had been my schoolfellow; but with every muscle of my body strung\nwith indignation, I cast him, like a skittle, from me into a snowdrift,\nwhich closed over him. Then I looked for the other fellow, tossed\nthrough Lorna's window, and found him lying stunned and bleeding,\nneither able to groan yet. Charleworth Doone, if his gushing blood did\nnot much mislead me.\n\nIt was no time to linger now; I fastened my shoes in a moment, and\ncaught up my own darling with her head upon my shoulder, where she\nwhispered faintly; and telling Gwenny to follow me, or else I would come\nback for her, if she could not walk the snow, I ran the whole distance\nto my sledd, caring not who might follow me. Then by the time I had set\nup Lorna, beautiful and smiling, with the seal-skin cloak all over her,\nsturdy Gwenny came along, having trudged in the track of my snow-shoes,\nalthough with two bags on her back. I set her in beside her mistress,\nto support her, and keep warm; and then with one look back at the glen,\nwhich had been so long my home of heart, I hung behind the sledd, and\nlaunched it down the steep and dangerous way.\n\nThough the cliffs were black above us, and the road unseen in front, and\na great white grave of snow might at a single word come down, Lorna was\nas calm and happy as an infant in its bed. She knew that I was with her;\nand when I told her not to speak, she touched my hand in silence. Gwenny\nwas in a much greater fright, having never seen such a thing before,\nneither knowing what it is to yield to pure love's confidence. I could\nhardly keep her quiet, without making a noise myself. With my staff from\nrock to rock, and my weight thrown backward, I broke the sledd's too\nrapid way, and brought my grown love safely out, by the selfsame road\nwhich first had led me to her girlish fancy, and my boyish slavery.\n\nUnpursued, yet looking back as if some one must be after us, we skirted\nround the black whirling pool, and gained the meadows beyond it. Here\nthere was hard collar work, the track being all uphill and rough; and\nGwenny wanted to jump out, to lighten the sledd and to push behind. But\nI would not hear of it; because it was now so deadly cold, and I feared\nthat Lorna might get frozen, without having Gwenny to keep her warm. And\nafter all, it was the sweetest labour I had ever known in all my\nlife, to be sure that I was pulling Lorna, and pulling her to our own\nfarmhouse.\n\nGwenny's nose was touched with frost, before we had gone much farther,\nbecause she would not keep it quiet and snug beneath the sealskin. And\nhere I had to stop in the moonlight (which was very dangerous) and rub\nit with a clove of snow, as Eliza had taught me; and Gwenny scolding\nall the time, as if myself had frozen it. Lorna was now so far oppressed\nwith all the troubles of the evening, and the joy that followed them, as\nwell as by the piercing cold and difficulty of breathing, that she lay\nquite motionless, like fairest wax in the moonlight--when we stole a\nglance at her, beneath the dark folds of the cloak; and I thought that\nshe was falling into the heavy snow-sleep, whence there is no awaking.\n\nTherefore, I drew my traces tight, and set my whole strength to the\nbusiness; and we slipped along at a merry pace, although with many\njoltings, which must have sent my darling out into the cold snowdrifts\nbut for the short strong arm of Gwenny. And so in about an hour's time,\nin spite of many hindrances, we came home to the old courtyard, and all\nthe dogs saluted us. My heart was quivering, and my cheeks as hot as\nthe Doones' bonfire, with wondering both what Lorna would think of\nour farm-yard, and what my mother would think of her. Upon the former\nsubject my anxiety was wasted, for Lorna neither saw a thing, nor even\nopened her heavy eyes. And as to what mother would think of her, she was\ncertain not to think at all, until she had cried over her.\n\nAnd so indeed it came to pass. Even at this length of time, I can hardly\ntell it, although so bright before my mind, because it moves my heart\nso. The sledd was at the open door, with only Lorna in it; for Gwenny\nCarfax had jumped out, and hung back in the clearing, giving any reason\nrather than the only true one--that she would not be intruding. At the\ndoor were all our people; first, of course, Betty Muxworthy, teaching\nme how to draw the sledd, as if she had been born in it, and flourishing\nwith a great broom, wherever a speck of snow lay. Then dear Annie,\nand old Molly (who was very quiet, and counted almost for nobody), and\nbehind them, mother, looking as if she wanted to come first, but\ndoubted how the manners lay. In the distance Lizzie stood, fearful of\nencouraging, but unable to keep out of it.\n\nBetty was going to poke her broom right in under the sealskin cloak,\nwhere Lorna lay unconscious, and where her precious breath hung frozen,\nlike a silver cobweb; but I caught up Betty's broom, and flung it clean\naway over the corn chamber; and then I put the others by, and fetched my\nmother forward.\n\n\"You shall see her first,\" I said: \"is she not your daughter? Hold the\nlight there, Annie.\"\n\nDear mother's hands were quick and trembling, as she opened the shining\nfolds; and there she saw my Lorna sleeping, with her black hair all\ndishevelled, and she bent and kissed her forehead, and only said, \"God\nbless her, John!\" And then she was taken with violent weeping, and I was\nforced to hold her.\n\n\"Us may tich of her now, I rackon,\" said Betty in her most jealous way;\n\"Annie, tak her by the head, and I'll tak her by the toesen. No taime\nto stand here like girt gawks. Don'ee tak on zo, missus. Ther be vainer\nvish in the zea--Lor, but, her be a booty!\"\n\nWith this, they carried her into the house, Betty chattering all the\nwhile, and going on now about Lorna's hands, and the others crowding\nround her, so that I thought I was not wanted among so many women, and\nshould only get the worst of it, and perhaps do harm to my darling.\nTherefore I went and brought Gwenny in, and gave her a potful of\nbacon and peas, and an iron spoon to eat it with, which she did right\nheartily.\n\nThen I asked her how she could have been such a fool as to let those two\nvile fellows enter the house where Lorna was; and she accounted for it\nso naturally, that I could only blame myself. For my agreement had been\nto give one loud knock (if you happen to remember) and after that two\nlittle knocks. Well these two drunken rogues had come; and one, being\nvery drunk indeed, had given a great thump; and then nothing more to\ndo with it; and the other, being three-quarters drunk, had followed his\nleader (as one might say) but feebly, and making two of it. Whereupon up\njumped Lorna, and declared that her John was there.\n\nAll this Gwenny told me shortly, between the whiles of eating, and even\nwhile she licked the spoon; and then there came a message for me that my\nlove was sensible, and was seeking all around for me. Then I told Gwenny\nto hold her tongue (whatever she did among us), and not to trust to\nwomen's words; and she told me they all were liars, as she had found\nout long ago; and the only thing to believe in was an honest man, when\nfound. Thereupon I could have kissed her as a sort of tribute, liking to\nbe appreciated; yet the peas upon her lips made me think about it; and\nthought is fatal to action. So I went to see my dear.\n\nThat sight I shall not forget; till my dying head falls back, and my\nbreast can lift no more. I know not whether I were then more blessed,\nor harrowed by it. For in the settle was my Lorna, propped with\npillows round her, and her clear hands spread sometimes to the blazing\nfireplace. In her eyes no knowledge was of anything around her, neither\nin her neck the sense of leaning towards anything. Only both her lovely\nhands were entreating something, to spare her, or to love her; and the\nlines of supplication quivered in her sad white face.\n\n[Illustration: 387.jpg For in the settle was my Lorna]\n\n\"All go away, except my mother,\" I said very quietly, but so that I\nwould be obeyed; and everybody knew it. Then mother came to me alone;\nand she said, \"The frost is in her brain; I have heard of this before,\nJohn.\" \"Mother, I will have it out,\" was all that I could answer her;\n\"leave her to me altogether; only you sit there and watch.\" For I felt\nthat Lorna knew me, and no other soul but me; and that if not interfered\nwith, she would soon come home to me. Therefore I sat gently by her,\nleaving nature, as it were, to her own good time and will. And presently\nthe glance that watched me, as at distance and in doubt, began to\nflutter and to brighten, and to deepen into kindness, then to beam with\ntrust and love, and then with gathering tears to falter, and in shame\nto turn away. But the small entreating hands found their way, as if by\ninstinct, to my great projecting palms; and trembled there, and rested\nthere.\n\nFor a little while we lingered thus, neither wishing to move away,\nneither caring to look beyond the presence of the other; both alike so\nfull of hope, and comfort, and true happiness; if only the world would\nlet us be. And then a little sob disturbed us, and mother tried to make\nbelieve that she was only coughing. But Lorna, guessing who she was,\njumped up so very rashly that she almost set her frock on fire from the\ngreat ash log; and away she ran to the old oak chair, where mother was\nby the clock-case pretending to be knitting, and she took the work from\nmother's hands, and laid them both upon her head, kneeling humbly, and\nlooking up.\n\n\"God bless you, my fair mistress!\" said mother, bending nearer, and then\nas Lorna's gaze prevailed, \"God bless you, my sweet child!\"\n\nAnd so she went to mother's heart by the very nearest road, even as she\nhad come to mine; I mean the road of pity, smoothed by grace, and youth,\nand gentleness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nA CHANGE LONG NEEDED\n\n[Illustration: 389.jpg Marwood Whichehalse]\n\nJeremy Stickles was gone south, ere ever the frost set in, for the\npurpose of mustering forces to attack the Doone Glen. But, of course,\nthis weather had put a stop to every kind of movement; for even if men\ncould have borne the cold, they could scarcely be brought to face the\nperils of the snow-drifts. And to tell the truth I cared not how long\nthis weather lasted, so long as we had enough to eat, and could keep\nourselves from freezing. Not only that I did not want Master Stickles\nback again, to make more disturbances; but also that the Doones could\nnot come prowling after Lorna while the snow lay piled between us, with\nthe surface soft and dry. Of course they would very soon discover where\ntheir lawful queen was, although the track of sledd and snow-shoes had\nbeen quite obliterated by another shower, before the revellers could\nhave grown half as drunk as they intended. But Marwood de Whichehalse,\nwho had been snowed up among them (as Gwenny said), after helping\nto strip the beacon, that young Squire was almost certain to have\nrecognised me, and to have told the vile Carver. And it gave me no\nlittle pleasure to think how mad that Carver must be with me, for\nrobbing him of the lovely bride whom he was starving into matrimony.\nHowever, I was not pleased at all with the prospect of the consequences;\nbut set all hands on to thresh the corn, ere the Doones could come and\nburn the ricks. For I knew that they could not come yet, inasmuch as\neven a forest pony could not traverse the country, much less the heavy\nhorses needed to carry such men as they were. And hundreds of the forest\nponies died in this hard weather, some being buried in the snow, and\nmore of them starved for want of grass.\n\nGoing through this state of things, and laying down the law about\nit (subject to correction), I very soon persuaded Lorna that for the\npresent she was safe, and (which made her still more happy) that she was\nnot only welcome, but as gladdening to our eyes as the flowers of May.\nOf course, so far as regarded myself, this was not a hundredth part of\nthe real truth; and even as regarded others, I might have said it ten\ntimes over. For Lorna had so won them all, by her kind and gentle ways,\nand her mode of hearkening to everybody's trouble, and replying without\nwords, as well as by her beauty, and simple grace of all things, that\nI could almost wish sometimes the rest would leave her more to me. But\nmother could not do enough; and Annie almost worshipped her; and even\nLizzie could not keep her bitterness towards her; especially when she\nfound that Lorna knew as much of books as need be.\n\nAs for John Fry, and Betty, and Molly, they were a perfect plague when\nLorna came into the kitchen. For betwixt their curiosity to see a\nlive Doone in the flesh (when certain not to eat them), and their high\nrespect for birth (with or without honesty), and their intense desire to\nknow all about Master John's sweetheart (dropped, as they said, from the\nsnow-clouds), and most of all their admiration of a beauty such as never\neven their angels could have seen--betwixt and between all this, I say,\nthere was no getting the dinner cooked, with Lorna in the kitchen.\n\nAnd the worst of it was that Lorna took the strangest of all strange\nfancies for this very kitchen; and it was hard to keep her out of it.\nNot that she had any special bent for cooking, as our Annie had; rather\nindeed the contrary, for she liked to have her food ready cooked; but\nthat she loved the look of the place, and the cheerful fire burning, and\nthe racks of bacon to be seen, and the richness, and the homeliness, and\nthe pleasant smell of everything. And who knows but what she may have\nliked (as the very best of maidens do) to be admired, now and then,\nbetween the times of business?\n\nTherefore if you wanted Lorna (as I was always sure to do, God knows\nhow many times a day), the very surest place to find her was our own\nold kitchen. Not gossiping, I mean, nor loitering, neither seeking into\nthings, but seeming to be quite at home, as if she had known it from a\nchild, and seeming (to my eyes at least) to light it up, and make life\nand colour out of all the dullness; as I have seen the breaking sun do\namong brown shocks of wheat.\n\nBut any one who wished to learn whether girls can change or not, as the\nthings around them change (while yet their hearts are steadfast, and for\never anchored), he should just have seen my Lorna, after a fortnight\nof our life, and freedom from anxiety. It is possible that my\ncompany--although I am accounted stupid by folk who do not know my\nway--may have had something to do with it; but upon this I will not say\nmuch, lest I lose my character. And indeed, as regards company, I had\nall the threshing to see to, and more than half to do myself (though any\none would have thought that even John Fry must work hard this weather),\nelse I could not hope at all to get our corn into such compass that a\ngood gun might protect it.\n\nBut to come back to Lorna again (which I always longed to do, and must\nlong for ever), all the change between night and day, all the shifts\nof cloud and sun, all the difference between black death and brightsome\nliveliness, scarcely may suggest or equal Lorna's transformation. Quick\nshe had always been and \"peart\" (as we say on Exmoor) and gifted with a\nleap of thought too swift for me to follow; and hence you may find fault\nwith much, when I report her sayings. But through the whole had always\nrun, as a black string goes through pearls, something dark and touched\nwith shadow, coloured as with an early end.\n\nBut, now, behold! there was none of this! There was no getting her, for\na moment, even to be serious. All her bright young wit was flashing,\nlike a newly-awakened flame, and all her high young spirits leaped, as\nif dancing to its fire. And yet she never spoke a word which gave more\npain than pleasure.\n\nAnd even in her outward look there was much of difference. Whether it\nwas our warmth, and freedom, and our harmless love of God, and trust\nin one another; or whether it were our air, and water, and the pea-fed\nbacon; anyhow my Lorna grew richer and more lovely, more perfect and\nmore firm of figure, and more light and buoyant, with every passing day\nthat laid its tribute on her cheeks and lips. I was allowed one kiss\na day; only one for manners' sake, because she was our visitor; and I\nmight have it before breakfast, or else when I came to say \"good-night!\"\naccording as I decided. And I decided every night, not to take it in the\nmorning, but put it off till the evening time, and have the pleasure to\nthink about, through all the day of working. But when my darling came up\nto me in the early daylight, fresher than the daystar, and with no one\nlooking; only her bright eyes smiling, and sweet lips quite ready, was\nit likely I could wait, and think all day about it? For she wore a frock\nof Annie's, nicely made to fit her, taken in at the waist and curved--I\nnever could explain it, not being a mantua-maker; but I know how her\nfigure looked in it, and how it came towards me.\n\nBut this is neither here nor there; and I must on with my story. Those\ndays are very sacred to me, and if I speak lightly of them, trust\nme, 'tis with lip alone; while from heart reproach peeps sadly at the\nflippant tricks of mind.\n\nAlthough it was the longest winter ever known in our parts (never having\nceased to freeze for a single night, and scarcely for a single day, from\nthe middle of December till the second week in March), to me it was the\nvery shortest and the most delicious; and verily I do believe it was\nthe same to Lorna. But when the Ides of March were come (of which I\ndo remember something dim from school, and something clear from my\nfavourite writer) lo, there were increasing signals of a change of\nweather.\n\nOne leading feature of that long cold, and a thing remarked by every one\n(however unobservant) had been the hollow moaning sound ever present in\nthe air, morning, noon, and night-time, and especially at night, whether\nany wind were stirring, or whether it were a perfect calm. Our people\nsaid that it was a witch cursing all the country from the caverns by the\nsea, and that frost and snow would last until we could catch and drown\nher. But the land, being thoroughly blocked with snow, and the inshore\nparts of the sea with ice (floating in great fields along), Mother\nMelldrum (if she it were) had the caverns all to herself, for there\nwas no getting at her. And speaking of the sea reminds me of a thing\nreported to us, and on good authority; though people might be found\nhereafter who would not believe it, unless I told them that from what I\nmyself beheld of the channel I place perfect faith in it: and this is,\nthat a dozen sailors at the beginning of March crossed the ice, with the\naid of poles from Clevedon to Penarth, or where the Holm rocks barred\nthe flotage.\n\nBut now, about the tenth of March, that miserable moaning noise, which\nhad both foregone and accompanied the rigour, died away from out the\nair; and we, being now so used to it, thought at first that we must be\ndeaf. And then the fog, which had hung about (even in full sunshine)\nvanished, and the shrouded hills shone forth with brightness manifold.\nAnd now the sky at length began to come to its true manner, which we\nhad not seen for months, a mixture (if I so may speak) of various\nexpressions. Whereas till now from Allhallows-tide, six weeks ere the\ngreat frost set in, the heavens had worn one heavy mask of ashen gray\nwhen clouded, or else one amethystine tinge with a hazy rim, when\ncloudless. So it was pleasant to behold, after that monotony, the fickle\nsky which suits our England, though abused by foreign folk.\n\nAnd soon the dappled softening sky gave some earnest of its mood; for a\nbrisk south wind arose, and the blessed rain came driving, cold indeed,\nyet most refreshing to the skin, all parched with snow, and the eyeballs\nso long dazzled. Neither was the heart more sluggish in its thankfulness\nto God. People had begun to think, and somebody had prophesied, that we\nshould have no spring this year, no seed-time, and no harvest; for that\nthe Lord had sent a judgment on this country of England, and the\nnation dwelling in it, because of the wickedness of the Court, and the\nencouragement shown to Papists. And this was proved, they said, by what\nhad happened in the town of London; where, for more than a fortnight,\nsuch a chill of darkness lay that no man might behold his neighbour,\neven across the narrowest street; and where the ice upon the Thames was\nmore than four feet thick, and crushing London Bridge in twain. Now\nto these prophets I paid no heed, believing not that Providence would\nfreeze us for other people's sins; neither seeing how England could for\nmany generations have enjoyed good sunshine, if Popery meant frost and\nfogs. Besides, why could not Providence settle the business once for\nall by freezing the Pope himself; even though (according to our view) he\nwere destined to extremes of heat, together with all who followed him?\n\nNot to meddle with that subject, being beyond my judgment, let me tell\nthe things I saw, and then you must believe me. The wind, of course, I\ncould not see, not having the powers of a pig; but I could see the laden\nbranches of the great oaks moving, hoping to shake off the load packed\nand saddled on them. And hereby I may note a thing which some one may\nexplain perhaps in the after ages, when people come to look at things.\nThis is that in desperate cold all the trees were pulled awry, even\nthough the wind had scattered the snow burden from them. Of some sorts\nthe branches bended downwards, like an archway; of other sorts the\nboughs curved upwards, like a red deer's frontlet. This I know no\nreason* for; but am ready to swear that I saw it.\n\n     * The reason is very simple, as all nature's reasons are;\n     though the subject has not yet been investigated thoroughly.\n     In some trees the vascular tissue is more open on the upper\n     side, in others on the under side, of the spreading\n     branches; according to the form of growth, and habit of the\n     sap. Hence in very severe cold, when the vessels\n     (comparatively empty) are constricted, some have more power\n     of contraction on the upper side, and some upon the under.\n     Ed. L.D.\n\nNow when the first of the rain began, and the old familiar softness\nspread upon the window glass, and ran a little way in channels (though\nfrom the coldness of the glass it froze before reaching the bottom),\nknowing at once the difference from the short sharp thud of snow, we all\nran out, and filled our eyes and filled our hearts with gazing. True,\nthe snow was piled up now all in mountains round us; true, the air was\nstill so cold that our breath froze on the doorway, and the rain was\nturned to ice wherever it struck anything; nevertheless that it was rain\nthere was no denying, as we watched it across black doorways, and could\nsee no sign of white. Mother, who had made up her mind that the farm\nwas not worth having after all those prophesies, and that all of us must\nstarve, and holes be scratched in the snow for us, and no use to put up\na tombstone (for our church had been shut up long ago) mother fell\nupon my breast, and sobbed that I was the cleverest fellow ever born\nof woman. And this because I had condemned the prophets for a pack of\nfools; not seeing how business could go on, if people stopped to hearken\nto them.\n\nThen Lorna came and glorified me, for I had predicted a change of\nweather, more to keep their spirits up, than with real hope of it; and\nthen came Annie blushing shyly, as I looked at her, and said that Winnie\nwould soon have four legs now. This referred to some stupid joke made\nby John Fry or somebody, that in this weather a man had no legs, and a\nhorse had only two.\n\nBut as the rain came down upon us from the southwest wind, and we could\nnot have enough of it, even putting our tongues to catch it, as little\nchildren might do, and beginning to talk of primroses; the very noblest\nthing of all was to hear and see the gratitude of the poor beasts yet\nremaining and the few surviving birds. From the cowhouse lowing came,\nmore than of fifty milking times; moo and moo, and a turn-up noise at\nthe end of every bellow, as if from the very heart of kine. Then the\nhorses in the stables, packed as closely as they could stick, at the\nrisk of kicking, to keep the warmth in one another, and their spirits\nup by discoursing; these began with one accord to lift up their voices,\nsnorting, snaffling, whinnying, and neighing, and trotting to the door\nto know when they should have work again. To whom, as if in answer, came\nthe feeble bleating of the sheep, what few, by dint of greatest care,\nhad kept their fleeces on their backs, and their four legs under them.\n\nNeither was it a trifling thing, let whoso will say the contrary, to\nbehold the ducks and geese marching forth in handsome order from their\nbeds of fern and straw. What a goodly noise they kept, what a flapping\nof their wings, and a jerking of their tails, as they stood right up and\ntried with a whistling in their throats to imitate a cockscrow! And then\nhow daintily they took the wet upon their dusty plumes, and ducked their\nshoulders to it, and began to dress themselves, and laid their grooved\nbills on the snow, and dabbled for more ooziness!\n\nLorna had never seen, I dare say, anything like this before, and it was\nall that we could do to keep her from rushing forth with only little\nlambswool shoes on, and kissing every one of them. \"Oh, the dear things,\noh, the dear things!\" she kept saying continually, \"how wonderfully\nclever they are! Only look at that one with his foot up, giving orders\nto the others, John!\"\n\n\"And I must give orders to you, my darling,\" I answered, gazing on her\nface, so brilliant with excitement; \"and that is, that you come in at\nonce, with that worrisome cough of yours; and sit by the fire, and warm\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, John! Not for a minute, if you please, good John. I want to see\nthe snow go away, and the green meadows coming forth. And here comes our\nfavourite robin, who has lived in the oven so long, and sang us a song\nevery morning. I must see what he thinks of it!\"\n\n\"You will do nothing of the sort,\" I answered very shortly, being only\ntoo glad of a cause for having her in my arms again. So I caught her up,\nand carried her in; and she looked and smiled so sweetly at me instead\nof pouting (as I had feared) that I found myself unable to go very fast\nalong the passage. And I set her there in her favourite place, by the\nsweet-scented wood-fire; and she paid me porterage without my even\nasking her; and for all the beauty of the rain, I was fain to stay with\nher; until our Annie came to say that my advice was wanted.\n\nNow my advice was never much, as everybody knew quite well; but that was\nthe way they always put it, when they wanted me to work for them. And in\ntruth it was time for me to work; not for others, but myself, and (as I\nalways thought) for Lorna. For the rain was now coming down in earnest;\nand the top of the snow being frozen at last, and glazed as hard as a\nchina cup, by means of the sun and frost afterwards, all the rain ran\nright away from the steep inclines, and all the outlets being blocked\nwith ice set up like tables, it threatened to flood everything. Already\nit was ponding up, like a tide advancing at the threshold of the door\nfrom which we had watched the duck-birds; both because great piles of\nsnow trended in that direction, in spite of all our scraping, and also\nthat the gulley hole, where the water of the shoot went out (I mean when\nit was water) now was choked with lumps of ice, as big as a man's body.\nFor the \"shoot,\" as we called our little runnel of everlasting water,\nnever known to freeze before, and always ready for any man either to\nwash his hands, or drink, where it spouted from a trough of bark, set\namong white flint-stones; this at last had given in, and its music\nceased to lull us, as we lay in bed.\n\nIt was not long before I managed to drain off this threatening flood,\nby opening the old sluice-hole; but I had much harder work to keep the\nstables, and the cow-house, and the other sheds, from flooding. For we\nhave a sapient practice (and I never saw the contrary round about our\nparts, I mean), of keeping all rooms underground, so that you step down\nto them. We say that thus we keep them warmer, both for cattle and for\nmen, in the time of winter, and cooler in the summer-time. This I will\nnot contradict, though having my own opinion; but it seems to me to be\na relic of the time when people in the western countries lived in caves\nbeneath the ground, and blocked the mouths with neat-skins.\n\nLet that question still abide, for men who study ancient times to inform\nme, if they will; all I know is, that now we had no blessings for the\nsystem. If after all their cold and starving, our weak cattle now should\nhave to stand up to their knees in water, it would be certain death to\nthem; and we had lost enough already to make us poor for a long time;\nnot to speak of our kind love for them. And I do assure you, I loved\nsome horses, and even some cows for that matter, as if they had been my\nblood-relations; knowing as I did their virtues. And some of these were\nlost to us; and I could not bear to think of them. Therefore I worked\nhard all night to try and save the rest of them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nSQUIRE FAGGUS MAKES SOME LUCKY HITS\n\n[Illustration: 397.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThrough that season of bitter frost the red deer of the forest, having\nnothing to feed upon, and no shelter to rest in, had grown accustomed to\nour ricks of corn, and hay, and clover. There we might see a hundred\nof them almost any morning, come for warmth, and food, and comfort, and\nscarce willing to move away. And many of them were so tame, that they\nquietly presented themselves at our back door, and stood there with\ntheir coats quite stiff, and their flanks drawn in and panting,\nand icicles sometimes on their chins, and their great eyes fastened\nwistfully upon any merciful person; craving for a bit of food, and a\ndrink of water; I suppose that they had not sense enough to chew the\nsnow and melt it; at any rate, all the springs being frozen, and rivers\nhidden out of sight, these poor things suffered even more from thirst\nthan they did from hunger.\n\nBut now there was no fear of thirst, and more chance indeed of drowning;\nfor a heavy gale of wind arose, with violent rain from the south-west,\nwhich lasted almost without a pause for three nights and two days. At\nfirst the rain made no impression on the bulk of snow, but ran from\nevery sloping surface and froze on every flat one, through the coldness\nof the earth; and so it became impossible for any man to keep his legs\nwithout the help of a shodden staff. After a good while, however, the\nair growing very much warmer, this state of things began to change, and\na worse one to succeed it; for now the snow came thundering down from\nroof, and rock, and ivied tree, and floods began to roar and foam in\nevery trough and gulley. The drifts that had been so white and fair,\nlooked yellow, and smirched, and muddy, and lost their graceful curves,\nand moulded lines, and airiness. But the strangest sight of all to me\nwas in the bed of streams, and brooks, and especially of the Lynn river.\nIt was worth going miles to behold such a thing, for a man might never\nhave the chance again.\n\nVast drifts of snow had filled the valley, and piled above the\nriver-course, fifty feet high in many places, and in some as much as a\nhundred. These had frozen over the top, and glanced the rain away from\nthem, and being sustained by rock and tree, spanned the water mightily.\nBut meanwhile the waxing flood, swollen from every moorland hollow\nand from every spouting crag, had dashed away all icy fetters, and\nwas rolling gloriously. Under white fantastic arches, and long tunnels\nfreaked and fretted, and between pellucid pillars jagged with nodding\narchitraves, the red impetuous torrent rushed, and the brown foam\nwhirled and flashed. I was half inclined to jump in and swim through\nsuch glorious scenery; for nothing used to please me more than swimming\nin a flooded river. But I thought of the rocks, and I thought of the\ncramp, and more than all, of Lorna; and so, between one thing and\nanother, I let it roll on without me.\n\n[Illustration: 399.jpg Jump in and swim]\n\nIt was now high time to work very hard; both to make up for the\nfarm-work lost during the months of frost and snow, and also to be ready\nfor a great and vicious attack from the Doones, who would burn us in our\nbeds at the earliest opportunity. Of farm-work there was little yet for\neven the most zealous man to begin to lay his hand to; because when the\nground appeared through the crust of bubbled snow (as at last it did,\nthough not as my Lorna had expected, at the first few drops of rain)\nit was all so soaked and sodden, and as we call it, \"mucksy,\" that to\nmeddle with it in any way was to do more harm than good. Nevertheless,\nthere was yard work, and house work, and tendence of stock, enough to\nsave any man from idleness.\n\nAs for Lorna, she would come out. There was no keeping her in the house.\nShe had taken up some peculiar notion that we were doing more for her\nthan she had any right to, and that she must earn her living by the\nhard work of her hands. It was quite in vain to tell her that she was\nexpected to do nothing, and far worse than vain (for it made her cry\nsadly) if any one assured her that she could do no good at all. She even\nbegan upon mother's garden before the snow was clean gone from it, and\nsowed a beautiful row of peas, every one of which the mice ate.\n\nBut though it was very pretty to watch her working for her very life,\nas if the maintenance of the household hung upon her labours, yet I was\ngrieved for many reasons, and so was mother also. In the first place,\nshe was too fair and dainty for this rough, rude work; and though it\nmade her cheeks so bright, it surely must be bad for her to get her\nlittle feet so wet. Moreover, we could not bear the idea that she should\nlabour for her keep; and again (which was the worst of all things)\nmother's garden lay exposed to a dark deceitful coppice, where a man\nmight lurk and watch all the fair gardener's doings. It was true that\nnone could get at her thence, while the brook which ran between poured\nso great a torrent. Still the distance was but little for a gun to\ncarry, if any one could be brutal enough to point a gun at Lorna. I\nthought that none could be found to do it; but mother, having more\nexperience, was not so certain of mankind.\n\nNow in spite of the floods, and the sloughs being out, and the state of\nthe roads most perilous, Squire Faggus came at last, riding his famous\nstrawberry mare. There was a great ado between him and Annie, as you\nmay well suppose, after some four months of parting. And so we left them\nalone awhile, to coddle over their raptures. But when they were tired of\nthat, or at least had time enough to do so, mother and I went in to know\nwhat news Tom had brought with him. Though he did not seem to want us\nyet, he made himself agreeable; and so we sent Annie to cook the dinner\nwhile her sweetheart should tell us everything.\n\nTom Faggus had very good news to tell, and he told it with such force of\nexpression as made us laugh very heartily. He had taken up his purchase\nfrom old Sir Roger Bassett of a nice bit of land, to the south of the\nmoors, and in the parish of Molland. When the lawyers knew thoroughly\nwho he was, and how he had made his money, they behaved uncommonly well\nto him, and showed great sympathy with his pursuits. He put them up to a\nthing or two; and they poked him in the ribs, and laughed, and said that\nhe was quite a boy; but of the right sort, none the less. And so they\nmade old Squire Bassett pay the bill for both sides; and all he got for\nthree hundred acres was a hundred and twenty pounds; though Tom had paid\nfive hundred. But lawyers know that this must be so, in spite of all\ntheir endeavours; and the old gentleman, who now expected to find a bill\nfor him to pay, almost thought himself a rogue, for getting anything out\nof them.\n\nIt is true that the land was poor and wild, and the soil exceeding\nshallow; lying on the slope of rock, and burned up in hot summers. But\nwith us, hot summers are things known by tradition only (as this great\nwinter may be); we generally have more moisture, especially in July,\nthan we well know what to do with. I have known a fog for a fortnight\nat the summer solstice, and farmers talking in church about it when they\nought to be praying. But it always contrives to come right in the end,\nas other visitations do, if we take them as true visits, and receive\nthem kindly.\n\nNow this farm of Squire Faggus (as he truly now had a right to be\ncalled) was of the very finest pasture, when it got good store of rain.\nAnd Tom, who had ridden the Devonshire roads with many a reeking jacket,\nknew right well that he might trust the climate for that matter. The\nherbage was of the very sweetest, and the shortest, and the closest,\nhaving perhaps from ten to eighteen inches of wholesome soil between it\nand the solid rock. Tom saw at once what it was fit for--the breeding of\nfine cattle.\n\nBeing such a hand as he was at making the most of everything, both his\nown and other people's (although so free in scattering, when the\nhumour lay upon him) he had actually turned to his own advantage that\nextraordinary weather which had so impoverished every one around him.\nFor he taught his Winnie (who knew his meaning as well as any child\ncould, and obeyed not only his word of mouth, but every glance he\ngave her) to go forth in the snowy evenings when horses are seeking\neverywhere (be they wild or tame) for fodder and for shelter; and to\nwhinny to the forest ponies, miles away from home perhaps, and lead\nthem all with rare appetites and promise of abundance, to her master's\nhomestead. He shod good Winnie in such a manner that she could not sink\nin the snow; and he clad her over the loins with a sheep-skin dyed to\nher own colour, which the wild horses were never tired of coming up and\nsniffing at; taking it for an especial gift, and proof of inspiration.\nAnd Winnie never came home at night without at least a score of ponies\ntrotting shyly after her, tossing their heads and their tails in turn,\nand making believe to be very wild, although hard pinched by famine. Of\ncourse Tom would get them all into his pound in about five minutes,\nfor he himself could neigh in a manner which went to the heart of the\nwildest horse. And then he fed them well, and turned them into his great\ncattle pen, to abide their time for breaking, when the snow and frost\nshould be over.\n\n[Illustration: 401.jpg He clad her over the loins]\n\nHe had gotten more than three hundred now, in this sagacious manner; and\nhe said it was the finest sight to see their mode of carrying on, how\nthey would snort, and stamp, and fume, and prick their ears, and rush\nbackwards, and lash themselves with their long rough tails, and shake\ntheir jagged manes, and scream, and fall upon one another, if a strange\nman came anigh them. But as for feeding time, Tom said it was better\nthan fifty plays to watch them, and the tricks they were up to, to cheat\ntheir feeders, and one another. I asked him how on earth he had managed\nto get fodder, in such impassable weather, for such a herd of horses;\nbut he said that they lived upon straw and sawdust; and he knew that I\ndid not believe him, any more than about his star-shavings. And this was\njust the thing he loved--to mystify honest people, and be a great deal\ntoo knowing. However, I may judge him harshly, because I myself tell\neverything.\n\nI asked him what he meant to do with all that enormous lot of horses,\nand why he had not exerted his wits to catch the red deer as well. He\nsaid that the latter would have been against the laws of venery, and\nmight have brought him into trouble, but as for disposing of his stud,\nit would give him little difficulty. He would break them, when the\nspring weather came on, and deal with them as they required, and keep\nthe handsomest for breeding. The rest he would despatch to London, where\nhe knew plenty of horse-dealers; and he doubted not that they would\nfetch him as much as ten pounds apiece all round, being now in great\ndemand. I told him I wished that he might get it; but as it proved\nafterwards, he did.\n\nThen he pressed us both on another point, the time for his marriage to\nAnnie; and mother looked at me to say when, and I looked back at mother.\nHowever, knowing something of the world, and unable to make any further\nobjection, by reason of his prosperity, I said that we must even do as\nthe fashionable people did, and allow the maid herself to settle, when\nshe would leave home and all. And this I spoke with a very bad grace,\nbeing perhaps of an ancient cast, and over fond of honesty--I mean, of\ncourse, among lower people.\n\nBut Tom paid little heed to this, knowing the world a great deal better\nthan ever I could pretend to do; and being ready to take a thing, upon\nwhich he had set his mind, whether it came with a good grace, or whether\nit came with a bad one. And seeing that it would be awkward to provoke\nmy anger, he left the room, before more words, to submit himself to\nAnnie.\n\nUpon this I went in search of Lorna, to tell her of our cousin's\narrival, and to ask whether she would think fit to see him, or to dine\nby herself that day; for she should do exactly as it pleased her in\neverything, while remaining still our guest. But I rather wished that\nshe might choose not to sit in Tom's company, though she might be\nintroduced to him. Not but what he could behave quite as well as could,\nand much better, as regarded elegance and assurance, only that his\nhonesty had not been as one might desire. But Lorna had some curiosity\nto know what this famous man was like, and declared that she would by\nall means have the pleasure of dining with him, if he did not object to\nher company on the ground of the Doones' dishonesty; moreover, she said\nthat it would seem a most foolish air on her part, and one which would\ncause the greatest pain to Annie, who had been so good to her, if she\nshould refuse to sit at table with a man who held the King's pardon, and\nwas now a pattern of honesty.\n\nAgainst this I had not a word to say; and could not help acknowledging\nin my heart that she was right, as well as wise, in her decision. And\nafterwards I discovered that mother would have been much displeased, if\nshe had decided otherwise.\n\nAccordingly she turned away, with one of her very sweetest smiles (whose\nbeauty none can describe) saying that she must not meet a man of such\nfashion and renown, in her common gardening frock; but must try to look\nas nice as she could, if only in honour of dear Annie. And truth to\ntell, when she came to dinner, everything about her was the neatest\nand prettiest that can possibly be imagined. She contrived to match\nthe colours so, to suit one another and her own, and yet with a certain\ndelicate harmony of contrast, and the shape of everything was so nice,\nso that when she came into the room, with a crown of winning modesty\nupon the consciousness of beauty, I was quite as proud as if the Queen\nof England entered.\n\nMy mother could not help remarking, though she knew that it was not\nmannerly, how like a princess Lorna looked, now she had her best things\non; but two things caught Squire Faggus's eyes, after he had made a\nmost gallant bow, and received a most graceful courtesy; and he kept his\nbright bold gaze upon them, first on one, and then on the other, until\nmy darling was hot with blushes, and I was ready to knock him down if he\nhad not been our visitor. But here again I should have been wrong, as I\nwas apt to be in those days; for Tom intended no harm whatever, and his\ngaze was of pure curiosity; though Annie herself was vexed with it. The\ntwo objects of his close regard, were first, and most worthily, Lorna's\nface, and secondly, the ancient necklace restored to her by Sir Ensor\nDoone.\n\nNow wishing to save my darling's comfort, and to keep things quiet, I\nshouted out that dinner was ready, so that half the parish could hear\nme; upon which my mother laughed, and chid me, and despatched her guests\nbefore her. And a very good dinner we made, I remember, and a very\nhappy one; attending to the women first, as now is the manner of eating;\nexcept among the workmen. With them, of course, it is needful that\nthe man (who has his hours fixed) should be served first, and make the\nutmost of his time for feeding, while the women may go on, as much as\never they please, afterwards. But with us, who are not bound to time,\nthere is no such reason to be quoted; and the women being the weaker\nvessels, should be the first to begin to fill. And so we always arranged\nit.\n\nNow, though our Annie was a graceful maid, and Lizzie a very learned\none, you should have seen how differently Lorna managed her dining; she\nnever took more than about a quarter of a mouthful at a time, and she\nnever appeared to be chewing that, although she must have done so.\nIndeed, she appeared to dine as if it were a matter of no consequence,\nand as if she could think of other things more than of her business. All\nthis, and her own manner of eating, I described to Eliza once, when I\nwanted to vex her for something very spiteful that she had said; and\nI never succeeded so well before, for the girl was quite outrageous,\nhaving her own perception of it, which made my observation ten times as\nbitter to her. And I am not sure but what she ceased to like poor Lorna\nfrom that day; and if so, I was quite paid out, as I well deserved, for\nmy bit of satire.\n\nFor it strikes me that of all human dealings, satire is the very lowest,\nand most mean and common. It is the equivalent in words of what bullying\nis in deeds; and no more bespeaks a clever man, than the other does a\nbrave one. These two wretched tricks exalt a fool in his own low esteem,\nbut never in his neighbour's; for the deep common sense of our nature\ntells that no man of a genial heart, or of any spread of mind, can take\npride in either. And though a good man may commit the one fault or the\nother, now and then, by way of outlet, he is sure to have compunctions\nsoon, and to scorn himself more than the sufferer.\n\nNow when the young maidens were gone--for we had quite a high dinner of\nfashion that day, with Betty Muxworthy waiting, and Gwenny Carfax at the\ngravy--and only mother, and Tom, and I remained at the white deal table,\nwith brandy, and schnapps, and hot water jugs; Squire Faggus said quite\nsuddenly, and perhaps on purpose to take us aback, in case of our hiding\nanything,--\"What do you know of the history of that beautiful maiden,\ngood mother?\"\n\n\"Not half so much as my son does,\" mother answered, with a soft smile at\nme; \"and when John does not choose to tell a thing, wild horses will not\npull it out of him.\"\n\n\"That is not at all like me, mother,\" I replied rather sadly; \"you know\nalmost every word about Lorna, quite as well as I do.\"\n\n\"Almost every word, I believe, John; for you never tell a falsehood. But\nthe few unknown may be of all the most important to me.\"\n\nTo this I made no answer, for fear of going beyond the truth, or else\nof making mischief. Not that I had, or wished to have, any mystery with\nmother; neither was there in purest truth, any mystery in the matter;\nto the utmost of my knowledge. And the only things that I had kept back,\nsolely for mother's comfort, were the death of poor Lord Alan Brandir\n(if indeed he were dead) and the connection of Marwood de Whichehalse\nwith the dealings of the Doones, and the threats of Carver Doone against\nmy own prosperity; and, may be, one or two little things harrowing more\nthan edifying.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Master Faggus, smiling very pleasantly, \"you two\nunderstand each other, if any two on earth do. Ah, if I had only had a\nmother, how different I might have been!\" And with that he sighed,\nin the tone which always overcame mother upon that subject, and had\nsomething to do with his getting Annie; and then he produced his pretty\nbox, full of rolled tobacco, and offered me one, as I now had joined the\ngoodly company of smokers. So I took it, and watched what he did with\nhis own, lest I might go wrong about mine.\n\nBut when our cylinders were both lighted, and I enjoying mine\nwonderfully, and astonishing mother by my skill, Tom Faggus told us that\nhe was sure he had seen my Lorna's face before, many and many years ago,\nwhen she was quite a little child, but he could not remember where it\nwas, or anything more about it at present; though he would try to do so\nafterwards. He could not be mistaken, he said, for he had noticed her\neyes especially; and had never seen such eyes before, neither\nagain, until this day. I asked him if he had ever ventured into the\nDoone-valley; but he shook his head, and replied that he valued his life\na deal too much for that. Then we put it to him, whether anything might\nassist his memory; but he said that he knew not of aught to do so,\nunless it were another glass of schnapps.\n\nThis being provided, he grew very wise, and told us clearly and candidly\nthat we were both very foolish. For he said that we were keeping Lorna,\nat the risk not only of our stock, and the house above our heads, but\nalso of our precious lives; and after all was she worth it, although so\nvery beautiful? Upon which I told him, with indignation, that her beauty\nwas the least part of her goodness, and that I would thank him for his\nopinion when I had requested it.\n\n\"Bravo, our John Ridd!\" he answered; \"fools will be fools till the end\nof the chapter; and I might be as big a one, if I were in thy shoes,\nJohn. Nevertheless, in the name of God, don't let that helpless child go\nabout with a thing worth half the county on her.\"\n\n\"She is worth all the county herself,\" said I, \"and all England put\ntogether; but she has nothing worth half a rick of hay upon her; for the\nring I gave her cost only,\"--and here I stopped, for mother was looking,\nand I never would tell her how much it had cost me; though she had tried\nfifty times to find out.\n\n\"Tush, the ring!\" Tom Faggus cried, with a contempt that moved me: \"I\nwould never have stopped a man for that. But the necklace, you great\noaf, the necklace is worth all your farm put together, and your Uncle\nBen's fortune to the back of it; ay, and all the town of Dulverton.\"\n\n\"What,\" said I, \"that common glass thing, which she has had from her\nchildhood!\"\n\n\"Glass indeed! They are the finest brilliants ever I set eyes on; and I\nhave handled a good many.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" cried mother, now flushing as red as Tom's own cheeks with\nexcitement, \"you must be wrong, or the young mistress would herself have\nknown it.\"\n\nI was greatly pleased with my mother, for calling Lorna \"the young\nmistress\"; it was not done for the sake of her diamonds, whether they\nwere glass or not; but because she felt as I had done, that Tom Faggus,\na man of no birth whatever, was speaking beyond his mark, in calling a\nlady like Lorna a helpless child; as well as in his general tone, which\ndisplayed no deference. He might have been used to the quality, in the\nway of stopping their coaches, or roystering at hotels with them; but he\nnever had met a high lady before, in equality, and upon virtue; and we\nboth felt that he ought to have known it, and to have thanked us for the\nopportunity, in a word, to have behaved a great deal more humbly than he\nhad even tried to do.\n\n\"Trust me,\" answered Tom, in his loftiest manner, which Annie said\nwas \"so noble,\" but which seemed to me rather flashy, \"trust me, good\nmother, and simple John, for knowing brilliants, when I see them. I\nwould have stopped an eight-horse coach, with four carabined out-riders,\nfor such a booty as that. But alas, those days are over; those were days\nworth living in. Ah, I never shall know the like again. How fine it was\nby moonlight!\"\n\n\"Master Faggus,\" began my mother, with a manner of some dignity, such\nas she could sometimes use, by right of her integrity, and thorough\nkindness to every one, \"this is not the tone in which you have hitherto\nspoken to me about your former pursuits and life, I fear that the\nspirits\"--but here she stopped, because the spirits were her own, and\nTom was our visitor,--\"what I mean, Master Faggus, is this: you have\nwon my daughter's heart somehow; and you won my consent to the matter\nthrough your honest sorrow, and manly undertaking to lead a different\nlife, and touch no property but your own. Annie is my eldest daughter,\nand the child of a most upright man. I love her best of all on earth,\nnext to my boy John here\"--here mother gave me a mighty squeeze, to be\nsure that she would have me at least--\"and I will not risk my Annie's\nlife with a man who yearns for the highway.\"\n\n[Illustration: 407.jpg \"Master Faggus,\" began my mother]\n\nHaving made this very long speech (for her), mother came home upon my\nshoulder, and wept so that (but for heeding her) I would have taken Tom\nby the nose, and thrown him, and Winnie after him, over our farm-yard\ngate. For I am violent when roused; and freely hereby acknowledge it;\nthough even my enemies will own that it takes a great deal to rouse me.\nBut I do consider the grief and tears (when justly caused) of my dearest\nfriends, to be a great deal to rouse me.\n\n[Illustration: 409.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nJEREMY IN DANGER\n\n[Illustration: 410.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nNothing very long abides, as the greatest of all writers (in whose\nextent I am for ever lost in raptured wonder, and yet for ever quite at\nhome, as if his heart were mine, although his brains so different), in a\nword as Mr. William Shakespeare, in every one of his works insists, with\na humoured melancholy. And if my journey to London led to nothing else\nof advancement, it took me a hundred years in front of what I might else\nhave been, by the most simple accident.\n\nTwo women were scolding one another across the road, very violently,\nboth from upstair windows; and I in my hurry for quiet life, and not\nknowing what might come down upon me, quickened my step for the nearest\ncorner. But suddenly something fell on my head; and at first I was\nafraid to look, especially as it weighed heavily. But hearing no\nbreakage of ware, and only the other scold laughing heartily, I turned\nme about and espied a book, which one had cast at the other, hoping to\nbreak her window. So I took the book, and tendered it at the door of the\nhouse from which it had fallen; but the watchman came along just then,\nand the man at the door declared that it never came from their house,\nand begged me to say no more. This I promised readily, never wishing to\nmake mischief; and I said, \"Good sir, now take the book; I will go on\nto my business.\" But he answered that he would do no such thing; for\nthe book alone, being hurled so hard, would convict his people of a lewd\nassault; and he begged me, if I would do a good turn, to put the book\nunder my coat and go. And so I did: in part at least. For I did not put\nthe book under my coat, but went along with it openly, looking for any\nto challenge it. Now this book, so acquired, has been not only the\njoy of my younger days, and main delight of my manhood, but also the\ncomfort, and even the hope, of my now declining years. In a word, it is\nnext to my Bible to me, and written in equal English; and if you espy\nany goodness whatever in my own loose style of writing, you must not\nthank me, John Ridd, for it, but the writer who holds the champion's\nbelt in wit, as I once did in wrestling.\n\n[Illustration: 411.jpg Something fell on my head]\n\nNow, as nothing very long abides, it cannot be expected that a woman's\nanger should last very long, if she be at all of the proper sort. And\nmy mother, being one of the very best, could not long retain her wrath\nagainst the Squire Faggus especially when she came to reflect, upon\nAnnie's suggestion, how natural, and one might say, how inevitable\nit was that a young man fond of adventure and change and winning good\nprofits by jeopardy, should not settle down without some regrets to a\nfixed abode and a life of sameness, however safe and respectable.\nAnd even as Annie put the case, Tom deserved the greater credit for\nvanquishing so nobly these yearnings of his nature; and it seemed very\nhard to upbraid him, considering how good his motives were; neither\ncould Annie understand how mother could reconcile it with her knowledge\nof the Bible, and the one sheep that was lost, and the hundredth piece\nof silver, and the man that went down to Jericho.\n\nWhether Annie's logic was good and sound, I am sure I cannot tell; but\nit seemed to me that she ought to have let the Jericho traveller alone,\ninasmuch as he rather fell among Tom Fagusses, than resembled them.\nHowever, her reasoning was too much for mother to hold out against; and\nTom was replaced, and more than that, being regarded now as an injured\nman. But how my mother contrived to know, that because she had been too\nhard upon Tom, he must be right about the necklace, is a point which I\nnever could clearly perceive, though no doubt she could explain it.\n\nTo prove herself right in the conclusion, she went herself to fetch\nLorna, that the trinket might be examined, before the day grew dark. My\ndarling came in, with a very quick glance and smile at my cigarro (for I\nwas having the third by this time, to keep things in amity); and I waved\nit towards her, as much as to say, \"you see that I can do it.\" And then\nmother led her up to the light, for Tom to examine her necklace.\n\nOn the shapely curve of her neck it hung, like dewdrops upon a white\nhyacinth; and I was vexed that Tom should have the chance to see it\nthere. But even if she had read my thoughts, or outrun them with her\nown, Lorna turned away, and softly took the jewels from the place which\nso much adorned them. And as she turned away, they sparkled through\nthe rich dark waves of hair. Then she laid the glittering circlet in\nmy mother's hands; and Tom Faggus took it eagerly, and bore it to the\nwindow.\n\n[Illustration: 413.jpg Tom Faggus took it eagerly]\n\n\"Don't you go out of sight,\" I said; \"you cannot resist such things as\nthose, if they be what you think them.\"\n\n\"Jack, I shall have to trounce thee yet. I am now a man of honour, and\nentitled to the duello. What will you take for it, Mistress Lorna? At a\nhazard, say now.\"\n\n\"I am not accustomed to sell things, sir,\" replied Lorna, who did not\nlike him much, else she would have answered sportively, \"What is it\nworth, in your opinion?\"\n\n\"Do you think it is worth five pounds, now?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I never had so much money as that in all my life. It is very\nbright, and very pretty; but it cannot be worth five pounds, I am sure.\"\n\n\"What a chance for a bargain! Oh, if it were not for Annie, I could make\nmy fortune.\"\n\n\"But, sir, I would not sell it to you, not for twenty times five pounds.\nMy grandfather was so kind about it; and I think it belonged to my\nmother.\"\n\n\"There are twenty-five rose diamonds in it, and twenty-five large\nbrilliants that cannot be matched in London. How say you, Mistress\nLorna, to a hundred thousand pounds?\"\n\nMy darling's eyes so flashed at this, brighter than any diamonds, that\nI said to myself, \"Well, all have faults; and now I have found out\nLorna's--she is fond of money!\" And then I sighed rather heavily; for of\nall faults this seems to me one of the worst in a woman. But even before\nmy sigh was finished, I had cause to condemn myself. For Lorna took the\nnecklace very quietly from the hands of Squire Faggus, who had not half\ndone with admiring it, and she went up to my mother with the sweetest\nsmile I ever saw.\n\n\"Dear kind mother, I am so glad,\" she said in a whisper, coaxing mother\nout of sight of all but me; \"now you will have it, won't you, dear? And\nI shall be so happy; for a thousandth part of your kindness to me no\njewels in the world can match.\"\n\nI cannot lay before you the grace with which she did it, all the air\nof seeking favour, rather than conferring it, and the high-bred fear of\ngiving offence, which is of all fears the noblest. Mother knew not what\nto say. Of course she would never dream of taking such a gift as that;\nand yet she saw how sadly Lorna would be disappointed. Therefore, mother\ndid, from habit, what she almost always did, she called me to help her.\nBut knowing that my eyes were full--for anything noble moves me so,\nquite as rashly as things pitiful--I pretended not to hear my mother,\nbut to see a wild cat in the dairy.\n\nTherefore I cannot tell what mother said in reply to Lorna; for when I\ncame back, quite eager to let my love know how I worshipped her, and\nhow deeply I was ashamed of myself, for meanly wronging her in my heart,\nbehold Tom Faggus had gotten again the necklace which had such charms\nfor him, and was delivering all around (but especially to Annie, who was\nwondering at his learning) a dissertation on precious stones, and his\nsentiments about those in his hand. He said that the work was very\nancient, but undoubtedly very good; the cutting of every line was\ntrue, and every angle was in its place. And this he said, made all the\ndifference in the lustre of the stone, and therefore in its value. For\nif the facets were ill-matched, and the points of light so ever little\nout of perfect harmony, all the lustre of the jewel would be loose\nand wavering, and the central fire dulled; instead of answering, as it\nshould, to all possibilities of gaze, and overpowering any eye intent on\nits deeper mysteries. We laughed at the Squire's dissertation; for how\nshould he know all these things, being nothing better, and indeed much\nworse than a mere Northmolton blacksmith? He took our laughter with much\ngood nature; having Annie to squeeze his hand and convey her grief at\nour ignorance: but he said that of one thing he was quite certain, and\ntherein I believed him. To wit, that a trinket of this kind never could\nhave belonged to any ignoble family, but to one of the very highest and\nmost wealthy in England. And looking at Lorna, I felt that she must have\ncome from a higher source than the very best of diamonds.\n\nTom Faggus said that the necklace was made, he would answer for it, in\nAmsterdam, two or three hundred years ago, long before London jewellers\nhad begun to meddle with diamonds; and on the gold clasp he found some\nletters, done in some inverted way, the meaning of which was beyond him;\nalso a bearing of some kind, which he believed was a mountain-cat. And\nthereupon he declared that now he had earned another glass of schnapps,\nand would Mistress Lorna mix it for him?\n\nI was amazed at his impudence; and Annie, who thought this her business,\ndid not look best pleased; and I hoped that Lorna would tell him at once\nto go and do it for himself. But instead of that she rose to do it with\na soft humility, which went direct to the heart of Tom; and he leaped up\nwith a curse at himself, and took the hot water from her, and would not\nallow her to do anything except to put the sugar in; and then he bowed\nto her grandly. I knew what Lorna was thinking of; she was thinking all\nthe time that her necklace had been taken by the Doones with violence\nupon some great robbery; and that Squire Faggus knew it, though he would\nnot show his knowledge; and that this was perhaps the reason why mother\nhad refused it so.\n\nWe said no more about the necklace for a long time afterwards; neither\ndid my darling wear it, now that she knew its value, but did not know\nits history. She came to me the very next day, trying to look cheerful,\nand begged me if I loved her (never mind how little) to take charge of\nit again, as I once had done before, and not even to let her know in\nwhat place I stored it. I told her that this last request I could not\ncomply with; for having been round her neck so often, it was now a\nsacred thing, more than a million pounds could be. Therefore it should\ndwell for the present in the neighbourhood of my heart; and so could not\nbe far from her. At this she smiled her own sweet smile, and touched\nmy forehead with her lips and wished that she could only learn how to\ndeserve such love as mine.\n\nTom Faggus took his good departure, which was a kind farewell to me,\non the very day I am speaking of, the day after his arrival. Tom was\na thoroughly upright man, according to his own standard; and you might\nrely upon him always, up to a certain point I mean, to be there or\nthereabouts. But sometimes things were too many for Tom, especially with\nardent spirits, and then he judged, perhaps too much, with only himself\nfor the jury. At any rate, I would trust him fully, for candour and\nfor honesty, in almost every case in which he himself could have no\ninterest. And so we got on very well together; and he thought me a fool;\nand I tried my best not to think anything worse of him.\n\nScarcely was Tom clean out of sight, and Annie's tears not dry yet (for\nshe always made a point of crying upon his departure), when in came\nMaster Jeremy Stickles, splashed with mud from head to foot, and not in\nthe very best of humours, though happy to get back again.\n\n\"Curse those fellows!\" he cried, with a stamp which sent the water\nhissing from his boot upon the embers; \"a pretty plight you may call\nthis, for His Majesty's Commissioner to return to his headquarters in!\nAnnie, my dear,\" for he was always very affable with Annie, \"will you\nhelp me off with my overalls, and then turn your pretty hand to the\ngridiron? Not a blessed morsel have I touched for more than twenty-four\nhours.\"\n\n\"Surely then you must be quite starving, sir,\" my sister replied with\nthe greatest zeal; for she did love a man with an appetite; \"how glad I\nam that the fire is clear!\" But Lizzie, who happened to be there, said\nwith her peculiar smile,--\n\n\"Master Stickles must be used to it; for he never comes back without\ntelling us that.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" cried Annie, quite shocked with her; \"how would you like to\nbe used to it? Now, Betty, be quick with the things for me. Pork, or\nmutton, or deer's meat, sir? We have some cured since the autumn.\"\n\n\"Oh, deer's meat, by all means,\" Jeremy Stickles answered; \"I have\ntasted none since I left you, though dreaming of it often. Well, this\nis better than being chased over the moors for one's life, John. All the\nway from Landacre Bridge, I have ridden a race for my precious life, at\nthe peril of my limbs and neck. Three great Doones galloping after me,\nand a good job for me that they were so big, or they must have overtaken\nme. Just go and see to my horse, John, that's an excellent lad. He\ndeserves a good turn this day, from me; and I will render it to him.\"\n\nHowever he left me to do it, while he made himself comfortable: and\nin truth the horse required care; he was blown so that he could hardly\nstand, and plastered with mud, and steaming so that the stable was\nquite full with it. By the time I had put the poor fellow to rights, his\nmaster had finished dinner, and was in a more pleasant humour, having\neven offered to kiss Annie, out of pure gratitude, as he said; but Annie\nanswered with spirit that gratitude must not be shown by increasing the\nobligation. Jeremy made reply to this that his only way to be grateful\nthen was to tell us his story: and so he did, at greater length than\nI can here repeat it; for it does not bear particularly upon Lorna's\nfortunes.\n\nIt appears that as he was riding towards us from the town of Southmolton\nin Devonshire, he found the roads very soft and heavy, and the floods\nout in all directions; but met with no other difficulty until he came to\nLandacre Bridge. He had only a single trooper with him, a man not of the\nmilitia but of the King's army, whom Jeremy had brought from Exeter.\nAs these two descended towards the bridge they observed that both the\nKensford water and the River Barle were pouring down in mighty floods\nfrom the melting of the snow. So great indeed was the torrent, after\nthey united, that only the parapets of the bridge could be seen above\nthe water, the road across either bank being covered and very deep on\nthe hither side. The trooper did not like the look of it, and proposed\nto ride back again, and round by way of Simonsbath, where the stream is\nsmaller. But Stickles would not have it so, and dashing into the river,\nswam his horse for the bridge, and gained it with some little trouble;\nand there he found the water not more than up to his horse's knees\nperhaps. On the crown of the bridge he turned his horse to watch the\ntrooper's passage, and to help him with directions; when suddenly he saw\nhim fall headlong into the torrent, and heard the report of a gun from\nbehind, and felt a shock to his own body, such as lifted him out of\nthe saddle. Turning round he beheld three men, risen up from behind the\nhedge on one side of his onward road, two of them ready to load again,\nand one with his gun unfired, waiting to get good aim at him. Then\nJeremy did a gallant thing, for which I doubt whether I should have had\nthe presence of mind in danger. He saw that to swim his horse back again\nwould be almost certain death; as affording such a target, where even\na wound must be fatal. Therefore he struck the spurs into the nag, and\nrode through the water straight at the man who was pointing the long gun\nat him. If the horse had been carried off his legs, there must have been\nan end of Jeremy; for the other men were getting ready to have another\nshot at him. But luckily the horse galloped right on without any need\nfor swimming, being himself excited, no doubt, by all he had seen and\nheard of it. And Jeremy lay almost flat on his neck, so as to give\nlittle space for good aim, with the mane tossing wildly in front of him.\nNow if that young fellow with the gun had his brains as ready as his\nflint was, he would have shot the horse at once, and then had Stickles\nat his mercy; but instead of that he let fly at the man, and missed him\naltogether, being scared perhaps by the pistol which Jeremy showed him\nthe mouth of. And galloping by at full speed, Master Stickles tried to\nleave his mark behind him, for he changed the aim of his pistol to the\nbiggest man, who was loading his gun and cursing like ten cannons. But\nthe pistol missed fire, no doubt from the flood which had gurgled in\nover the holsters; and Jeremy seeing three horses tethered at a gate\njust up the hill, knew that he had not yet escaped, but had more of\ndanger behind him. He tried his other great pistol at one of the\nhorses tethered there, so as to lessen (if possible) the number of his\npursuers. But the powder again failed him; and he durst not stop to cut\nthe bridles, bearing the men coming up the hill. So he even made the\nmost of his start, thanking God that his weight was light, compared at\nleast to what theirs was.\n\nAnd another thing he had noticed which gave him some hope of escaping,\nto wit that the horses of the Doones, although very handsome animals,\nwere suffering still from the bitter effects of the late long frost, and\nthe scarcity of fodder. \"If they do not catch me up, or shoot me, in the\ncourse of the first two miles, I may see my home again\"; this was what\nhe said to himself as he turned to mark what they were about, from\nthe brow of the steep hill. He saw the flooded valley shining with the\nbreadth of water, and the trooper's horse on the other side, shaking\nhis drenched flanks and neighing; and half-way down the hill he saw the\nthree Doones mounting hastily. And then he knew that his only chance lay\nin the stoutness of his steed.\n\nThe horse was in pretty good condition; and the rider knew him\nthoroughly, and how to make the most of him; and though they had\ntravelled some miles that day through very heavy ground, the bath in\nthe river had washed the mud off, and been some refreshment. Therefore\nStickles encouraged his nag, and put him into a good hard gallop,\nheading away towards Withycombe. At first he had thought of turning to\nthe right, and making off for Withypool, a mile or so down the valley;\nbut his good sense told him that no one there would dare to protect him\nagainst the Doones, so he resolved to go on his way; yet faster than he\nhad intended.\n\nThe three villains came after him, with all the speed they could muster,\nmaking sure from the badness of the road that he must stick fast ere\nlong, and so be at their mercy. And this was Jeremy's chiefest fear,\nfor the ground being soft and thoroughly rotten, after so much frost and\nsnow, the poor horse had terrible work of it, with no time to pick the\nway; and even more good luck than skill was needed to keep him from\nfoundering. How Jeremy prayed for an Exmoor fog (such as he had often\nsworn at), that he might turn aside and lurk, while his pursuers went\npast him! But no fog came, nor even a storm to damp the priming of their\nguns; neither was wood or coppice nigh, nor any place to hide in; only\nhills, and moor, and valleys; with flying shadows over them, and great\nbanks of snow in the corners. At one time poor Stickles was quite in\ndespair; for after leaping a little brook which crosses the track at\nNewland, be stuck fast in a \"dancing bog,\" as we call them upon Exmoor.\nThe horse had broken through the crust of moss and sedge and marishweed,\nand could do nothing but wallow and sink, with the black water spirting\nover him. And Jeremy, struggling with all his might, saw the three\nvillains now topping the crest, less than a furlong behind him; and\nheard them shout in their savage delight. With the calmness of despair,\nhe yet resolved to have one more try for it; and scrambling over the\nhorse's head, gained firm land, and tugged at the bridle. The poor nag\nreplied with all his power to the call upon his courage, and reared his\nforefeet out of the slough, and with straining eyeballs gazed at him.\n\"Now,\" said Jeremy, \"now, my fine fellow!\" lifting him with the bridle,\nand the brave beast gathered the roll of his loins, and sprang from his\nquagmired haunches. One more spring, and he was on earth again, instead\nof being under it; and Jeremy leaped on his back, and stooped, for he\nknew that they would fire. Two bullets whistled over him, as the horse,\nmad with fright, dashed forward; and in five minutes more he had come to\nthe Exe, and the pursuers had fallen behind him. The Exe, though a much\nsmaller stream than the Barle, now ran in a foaming torrent, unbridged,\nand too wide for leaping. But Jeremy's horse took the water well; and\nboth he and his rider were lightened, as well as comforted by it. And as\nthey passed towards Lucott hill, and struck upon the founts of Lynn,\nthe horses of the three pursuers began to tire under them. Then Jeremy\nStickles knew that if he could only escape the sloughs, he was safe for\nthe present; and so he stood up in his stirrups, and gave them a loud\nhalloo, as if they had been so many foxes.\n\n[Illustration: 419.jpg With a wave of his hat]\n\nTheir only answer was to fire the remaining charge at him; but the\ndistance was too great for any aim from horseback; and the dropping\nbullet idly ploughed the sod upon one side of him. He acknowledged it\nwith a wave of his hat, and laid one thumb to his nose, in the manner\nfashionable in London for expression of contempt. However, they followed\nhim yet farther; hoping to make him pay out dearly, if he should only\nmiss the track, or fall upon morasses. But the neighbourhood of our Lynn\nstream is not so very boggy; and the King's messenger now knew his\nway as well as any of his pursuers did; and so he arrived at Plover's\nBarrows, thankful, and in rare appetite.\n\n\"But was the poor soldier drowned?\" asked Annie; \"and you never went to\nlook for him! Oh, how very dreadful!\"\n\n\"Shot, or drowned; I know not which. Thank God it was only a trooper.\nBut they shall pay for it, as dearly as if it had been a captain.\"\n\n\"And how was it you were struck by a bullet, and only shaken in your\nsaddle? Had you a coat of mail on, or of Milanese chain-armour? Now,\nMaster Stickles, had you?\"\n\n\"No, Mistress Lizzie; we do not wear things of that kind nowadays. You\nare apt, I perceive, at romances. But I happened to have a little flat\nbottle of the best stoneware slung beneath my saddle-cloak, and filled\nwith the very best _eau de vie_, from the George Hotel, at Southmolton.\nThe brand of it now is upon my back. Oh, the murderous scoundrels, what\na brave spirit they have spilled!\"\n\n\"You had better set to and thank God,\" said I, \"that they have not\nspilled a braver one.\"\n\n[Illustration: 421.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nEVERY MAN MUST DEFEND HIMSELF\n\n[Illustration: 422.jpg The Bagworthy Water]\n\nIt was only right in Jeremy Stickles, and of the simplest common sense,\nthat he would not tell, before our girls, what the result of his journey\nwas. But he led me aside in the course of the evening, and told me all\nabout it; saying that I knew, as well as he did, that it was not woman's\nbusiness. This I took, as it was meant, for a gentle caution that Lorna\n(whom he had not seen as yet) must not be informed of any of his doings.\nHerein I quite agreed with him; not only for his furtherance, but\nbecause I always think that women, of whatever mind, are best when least\nthey meddle with the things that appertain to men.\n\nMaster Stickles complained that the weather had been against him\nbitterly, closing all the roads around him; even as it had done with us.\nIt had taken him eight days, he said, to get from Exeter to Plymouth;\nwhither he found that most of the troops had been drafted off from\nExeter. When all were told, there was but a battalion of one of the\nKing's horse regiments, and two companies of foot soldiers; and their\ncommanders had orders, later than the date of Jeremy's commission, on\nno account to quit the southern coast, and march inland. Therefore,\nalthough they would gladly have come for a brush with the celebrated\nDoones, it was more than they durst attempt, in the face of their\ninstructions. However, they spared him a single trooper, as a companion\nof the road, and to prove to the justices of the county, and the lord\nlieutenant, that he had their approval.\n\nTo these authorities Master Stickles now was forced to address himself,\nalthough he would rather have had one trooper than a score from the\nvery best trained bands. For these trained bands had afforded very good\nsoldiers, in the time of the civil wars, and for some years afterwards;\nbut now their discipline was gone; and the younger generation had seen\nno real fighting. Each would have his own opinion, and would want to\nargue it; and if he were not allowed, he went about his duty in such a\ntemper as to prove that his own way was the best.\n\nNeither was this the worst of it; for Jeremy made no doubt but what (if\nhe could only get the militia to turn out in force) he might manage,\nwith the help of his own men, to force the stronghold of the enemy; but\nthe truth was that the officers, knowing how hard it would be to collect\ntheir men at that time of the year, and in that state of the weather,\nbegan with one accord to make every possible excuse. And especially\nthey pressed this point, that Bagworthy was not in their county; the\nDevonshire people affirming vehemently that it lay in the shire of\nSomerset, and the Somersetshire folk averring, even with imprecations,\nthat it lay in Devonshire. Now I believe the truth to be that the\nboundary of the two counties, as well as of Oare and Brendon parishes,\nis defined by the Bagworthy river; so that the disputants on both sides\nwere both right and wrong.\n\nUpon this, Master Stickles suggested, and as I thought very sensibly,\nthat the two counties should unite, and equally contribute to the\nextirpation of this pest, which shamed and injured them both alike. But\nhence arose another difficulty; for the men of Devon said they would\nmarch when Somerset had taken the field; and the sons of Somerset\nreplied that indeed they were quite ready, but what were their cousins\nof Devonshire doing? And so it came to pass that the King's Commissioner\nreturned without any army whatever; but with promise of two hundred men\nwhen the roads should be more passable. And meanwhile, what were we to\ndo, abandoned as we were to the mercies of the Doones, with only our own\nhands to help us? And herein I grieved at my own folly, in having let\nTom Faggus go, whose wit and courage would have been worth at least half\na dozen men to us. Upon this matter I held long council with my good\nfriend Stickles; telling him all about Lorna's presence, and what I knew\nof her history. He agreed with me that we could not hope to escape an\nattack from the outlaws, and the more especially now that they knew\nhimself to be returned to us. Also he praised me for my forethought\nin having threshed out all our corn, and hidden the produce in such a\nmanner that they were not likely to find it. Furthermore, he recommended\nthat all the entrances to the house should at once be strengthened,\nand a watch must be maintained at night; and he thought it wiser that\nI should go (late as it was) to Lynmouth, if a horse could pass the\nvalley, and fetch every one of his mounted troopers, who might now be\nquartered there. Also if any men of courage, though capable only of\nhandling a pitchfork, could be found in the neighbourhood, I was to try\nto summon them. But our district is so thinly peopled, that I had little\nfaith in this; however my errand was given me, and I set forth upon it;\nfor John Fry was afraid of the waters.\n\nKnowing how fiercely the floods were out, I resolved to travel the\nhigher road, by Cosgate and through Countisbury; therefore I swam my\nhorse through the Lynn, at the ford below our house (where sometimes you\nmay step across), and thence galloped up and along the hills. I could\nsee all the inland valleys ribbon'd with broad waters; and in every\nwinding crook, the banks of snow that fed them; while on my right the\nturbid sea was flaked with April showers. But when I descended the hill\ntowards Lynmouth, I feared that my journey was all in vain.\n\nFor the East Lynn (which is our river) was ramping and roaring\nfrightfully, lashing whole trunks of trees on the rocks, and rending\nthem, and grinding them. And into it rushed, from the opposite side, a\ntorrent even madder; upsetting what it came to aid; shattering wave with\nboiling billow, and scattering wrath with fury. It was certain death to\nattempt the passage: and the little wooden footbridge had been carried\naway long ago. And the men I was seeking must be, of course, on the\nother side of this deluge, for on my side there was not a single house.\n\nI followed the bank of the flood to the beach, some two or three hundred\nyards below; and there had the luck to see Will Watcombe on the opposite\nside, caulking an old boat. Though I could not make him hear a word,\nfrom the deafening roar of the torrent, I got him to understand at last\nthat I wanted to cross over. Upon this he fetched another man, and the\ntwo of them launched a boat; and paddling well out to sea, fetched round\nthe mouth of the frantic river. The other man proved to be Stickles's\nchief mate; and so he went back and fetched his comrades, bringing their\nweapons, but leaving their horses behind. As it happened there were\nbut four of them; however, to have even these was a help; and I started\nagain at full speed for my home; for the men must follow afoot, and\ncross our river high up on the moorland.\n\nThis took them a long way round, and the track was rather bad to find,\nand the sky already darkening; so that I arrived at Plover's Barrows\nmore than two hours before them. But they had done a sagacious thing,\nwhich was well worth the delay; for by hoisting their flag upon the\nhill, they fetched the two watchmen from the Foreland, and added them to\ntheir number.\n\nIt was lucky that I came home so soon; for I found the house in a great\ncommotion, and all the women trembling. When I asked what the matter\nwas, Lorna, who seemed the most self-possessed, answered that it was all\nher fault, for she alone had frightened them. And this in the following\nmanner. She had stolen out to the garden towards dusk, to watch some\nfavourite hyacinths just pushing up, like a baby's teeth, and just\nattracting the fatal notice of a great house-snail at night-time. Lorna\nat last had discovered the glutton, and was bearing him off in triumph\nto the tribunal of the ducks, when she descried two glittering eyes\nglaring at her steadfastly, from the elder-bush beyond the stream.\nThe elder was smoothing its wrinkled leaves, being at least two months\nbehind time; and among them this calm cruel face appeared; and she knew\nit was the face of Carver Doone.\n\nThe maiden, although so used to terror (as she told me once before),\nlost all presence of mind hereat, and could neither shriek nor fly, but\nonly gaze, as if bewitched. Then Carver Doone, with his deadly smile,\ngloating upon her horror, lifted his long gun, and pointed full at\nLorna's heart. In vain she strove to turn away; fright had stricken her\nstiff as stone. With the inborn love of life, she tried to cover the\nvital part wherein the winged death must lodge--for she knew Carver's\ncertain aim--but her hands hung numbed, and heavy; in nothing but her\neyes was life.\n\nWith no sign of pity in his face, no quiver of relenting, but a\nwell-pleased grin at all the charming palsy of his victim, Carver Doone\nlowered, inch by inch, the muzzle of his gun. When it pointed to the\nground, between her delicate arched insteps, he pulled the trigger,\nand the bullet flung the mould all over her. It was a refinement of\nbullying, for which I swore to God that night, upon my knees, in secret,\nthat I would smite down Carver Doone or else he should smite me down.\nBase beast! what largest humanity, or what dreams of divinity, could\nmake a man put up with this?\n\nMy darling (the loveliest, and most harmless, in the world of maidens),\nfell away on a bank of grass, and wept at her own cowardice; and\ntrembled, and wondered where I was; and what I would think of this. Good\nGod! What could I think of it? She over-rated my slow nature, to admit\nthe question.\n\nWhile she leaned there, quite unable yet to save herself, Carver came\nto the brink of the flood, which alone was between them; and then he\nstroked his jet-black beard, and waited for Lorna to begin. Very likely,\nhe thought that she would thank him for his kindness to her. But she was\nnow recovering the power of her nimble limbs; and ready to be off like\nhope, and wonder at her own cowardice.\n\n\"I have spared you this time,\" he said, in his deep calm voice, \"only\nbecause it suits my plans; and I never yield to temper. But unless you\ncome back to-morrow, pure, and with all you took away, and teach me\nto destroy that fool, who has destroyed himself for you, your death is\nhere, your death is here, where it has long been waiting.\"\n\nAlthough his gun was empty, he struck the breech of it with his finger;\nand then he turned away, not deigning even once to look back again; and\nLorna saw his giant figure striding across the meadow-land, as if the\nRidds were nobodies, and he the proper owner. Both mother and I were\ngreatly hurt at hearing of this insolence: for we had owned that meadow,\nfrom the time of the great Alfred; and even when that good king lay in\nthe Isle of Athelney, he had a Ridd along with him.\n\nNow I spoke to Lorna gently, seeing how much she had been tried; and\nI praised her for her courage, in not having run away, when she was so\nunable; and my darling was pleased with this, and smiled upon me for\nsaying it; though she knew right well that, in this matter, my judgment\nwas not impartial. But you may take this as a general rule, that a woman\nlikes praise from the man whom she loves, and cannot stop always to\nbalance it.\n\nNow expecting a sharp attack that night--when Jeremy Stickles the more\nexpected, after the words of Carver, which seemed to be meant to mislead\nus--we prepared a great quantity of knuckles of pork, and a ham in full\ncut, and a fillet of hung mutton. For we would almost surrender rather\nthan keep our garrison hungry. And all our men were exceedingly brave;\nand counted their rounds of the house in half-pints.\n\nBefore the maidens went to bed, Lorna made a remark which seemed to me a\nvery clever one, and then I wondered how on earth it had never occurred\nto me before. But first she had done a thing which I could not in the\nleast approve of: for she had gone up to my mother, and thrown herself\ninto her arms, and begged to be allowed to return to Glen Doone.\n\n\"My child, are you unhappy here?\" mother asked her, very gently, for she\nhad begun to regard her now as a daughter of her own.\n\n\"Oh, no! Too happy, by far too happy, Mrs. Ridd. I never knew rest or\npeace before, or met with real kindness. But I cannot be so ungrateful,\nI cannot be so wicked, as to bring you all into deadly peril, for\nmy sake alone. Let me go: you must not pay this great price for my\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Dear child, we are paying no price at all,\" replied my mother,\nembracing her; \"we are not threatened for your sake only. Ask John,\nhe will tell you. He knows every bit about politics, and this is a\npolitical matter.\"\n\nDear mother was rather proud in her heart, as well as terribly\nfrightened, at the importance now accruing to Plover's Barrows farm;\nand she often declared that it would be as famous in history as the Rye\nHouse, or the Meal-tub, or even the great black box, in which she was a\nfirm believer: and even my knowledge of politics could not move her upon\nthat matter. \"Such things had happened before,\" she would say, shaking\nher head with its wisdom, \"and why might they not happen again? Women\nwould be women, and men would be men, to the end of the chapter; and if\nshe had been in Lucy Water's place, she would keep it quiet, as she\nhad done\"; and then she would look round, for fear, lest either of her\ndaughters had heard her; \"but now, can you give me any reason, why it\nmay not have been so? You are so fearfully positive, John: just as men\nalways are.\" \"No,\" I used to say; \"I can give you no reason, why it may\nnot have been so, mother. But the question is, if it was so, or not;\nrather than what it might have been. And, I think, it is pretty good\nproof against it, that what nine men of every ten in England would\nonly too gladly believe, if true, is nevertheless kept dark from them.\"\n\"There you are again, John,\" mother would reply, \"all about men, and not\na single word about women. If you had any argument at all, you would own\nthat marriage is a question upon which women are the best judges.\" \"Oh!\"\nI would groan in my spirit, and go; leaving my dearest mother quite\nsure, that now at last she must have convinced me. But if mother had\nknown that Jeremy Stickles was working against the black box, and its\nissue, I doubt whether he would have fared so well, even though he was\na visitor. However, she knew that something was doing and something of\nimportance; and she trusted in God for the rest of it. Only she used to\ntell me, very seriously, of an evening, \"The very least they can give\nyou, dear John, is a coat of arms. Be sure you take nothing less, dear;\nand the farm can well support it.\"\n\nBut lo! I have left Lorna ever so long, anxious to consult me upon\npolitical matters. She came to me, and her eyes alone asked a hundred\nquestions, which I rather had answered upon her lips than troubled her\npretty ears with them. Therefore I told her nothing at all, save that\nthe attack (if any should be) would not be made on her account; and that\nif she should hear, by any chance, a trifle of a noise in the night, she\nwas to wrap the clothes around her, and shut her beautiful eyes again.\nOn no account, whatever she did, was she to go to the window. She liked\nmy expression about her eyes, and promised to do the very best she could\nand then she crept so very close, that I needs must have her closer; and\nwith her head on my breast she asked,--\n\n\"Can't you keep out of this fight, John?\"\n\n\"My own one,\" I answered, gazing through the long black lashes, at the\ndepths of radiant love; \"I believe there will be nothing: but what there\nis I must see out.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you what I think, John? It is only a fancy of mine, and\nperhaps it is not worth telling.\"\n\n\"Let us have it, dear, by all means. You know so much about their ways.\"\n\n\"What I believe is this, John. You know how high the rivers are, higher\nthan ever they were before, and twice as high, you have told me. I\nbelieve that Glen Doone is flooded, and all the houses under water.\"\n\n\"You little witch,\" I answered; \"what a fool I must be not to think\nof it! Of course it is: it must be. The torrent from all the Bagworthy\nforest, and all the valleys above it, and the great drifts in the glen\nitself, never could have outlet down my famous waterslide. The valley\nmust be under water twenty feet at least. Well, if ever there was a\nfool, I am he, for not having thought of it.\"\n\n\"I remember once before,\" said Lorna, reckoning on her fingers, \"when\nthere was heavy rain, all through the autumn and winter, five or it may\nbe six years ago, the river came down with such a rush that the\nwater was two feet deep in our rooms, and we all had to camp by the\ncliff-edge. But you think that the floods are higher now, I believe I\nheard you say, John.\"\n\n\"I don't think about it, my treasure,\" I answered; \"you may trust me for\nunderstanding floods, after our work at Tiverton. And I know that the\ndeluge in all our valleys is such that no living man can remember,\nneither will ever behold again. Consider three months of snow, snow,\nsnow, and a fortnight of rain on the top of it, and all to be drained\nin a few days away! And great barricades of ice still in the rivers\nblocking them up, and ponding them. You may take my word for it,\nMistress Lorna, that your pretty bower is six feet deep.\"\n\n\"Well, my bower has served its time\", said Lorna, blushing as she\nremembered all that had happened there; \"and my bower now is here, John.\nBut I am so sorry to think of all the poor women flooded out of their\nhouses and sheltering in the snowdrifts. However, there is one good of\nit: they cannot send many men against us, with all this trouble upon\nthem.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" I replied; \"how clever you are! and that is why there\nwere only three to cut off Master Stickles. And now we shall beat them,\nI make no doubt, even if they come at all. And I defy them to fire the\nhouse: the thatch is too wet for burning.\"\n\nWe sent all the women to bed quite early, except Gwenny Carfax and our\nold Betty. These two we allowed to stay up, because they might be useful\nto us, if they could keep from quarreling. For my part, I had little\nfear, after what Lorna had told me, as to the result of the combat. It\nwas not likely that the Doones could bring more than eight or ten men\nagainst us, while their homes were in such danger: and to meet these\nwe had eight good men, including Jeremy, and myself, all well armed and\nresolute, besides our three farm-servants, and the parish-clerk, and the\nshoemaker. These five could not be trusted much for any valiant conduct,\nalthough they spoke very confidently over their cans of cider. Neither\nwere their weapons fitted for much execution, unless it were at close\nquarters, which they would be likely to avoid. Bill Dadds had a sickle,\nJem Slocombe a flail, the cobbler had borrowed the constable's staff\n(for the constable would not attend, because there was no warrant), and\nthe parish clerk had brought his pitch-pipe, which was enough to break\nany man's head. But John Fry, of course, had his blunderbuss, loaded\nwith tin-tacks and marbles, and more likely to kill the man who\ndischarged it than any other person: but we knew that John had it only\nfor show, and to describe its qualities.\n\nNow it was my great desire, and my chiefest hope, to come across Carver\nDoone that night, and settle the score between us; not by any shot\nin the dark, but by a conflict man to man. As yet, since I came to\nfull-grown power, I had never met any one whom I could not play teetotum\nwith: but now at last I had found a man whose strength was not to be\nlaughed at. I could guess it in his face, I could tell it in his arms, I\ncould see it in his stride and gait, which more than all the rest betray\nthe substance of a man. And being so well used to wrestling, and to\njudge antagonists, I felt that here (if anywhere) I had found my match.\n\nTherefore I was not content to abide within the house, or go the rounds\nwith the troopers; but betook myself to the rick yard, knowing that the\nDoones were likely to begin their onset there. For they had a pleasant\ncustom, when they visited farm-houses, of lighting themselves towards\npicking up anything they wanted, or stabbing the inhabitants, by first\ncreating a blaze in the rick yard. And though our ricks were all now of\nmere straw (except indeed two of prime clover-hay), and although on\nthe top they were so wet that no firebrands might hurt them; I was both\nunwilling to have them burned, and fearful that they might kindle, if\nwell roused up with fire upon the windward side.\n\nBy the bye, these Doones had got the worst of this pleasant trick\none time. For happening to fire the ricks of a lonely farm called\nYeanworthy, not far above Glenthorne, they approached the house to get\npeople's goods, and to enjoy their terror. The master of the farm was\nlately dead, and had left, inside the clock-case, loaded, the great long\ngun, wherewith he had used to sport at the ducks and the geese on the\nshore. Now Widow Fisher took out this gun, and not caring much what\nbecame of her (for she had loved her husband dearly), she laid it upon\nthe window-sill, which looked upon the rick-yard; and she backed up the\nbutt with a chest of oak drawers, and she opened the window a little\nback, and let the muzzle out on the slope. Presently five or six fine\nyoung Doones came dancing a reel (as their manner was) betwixt her and\nthe flaming rick. Upon which she pulled the trigger with all the force\nof her thumb, and a quarter of a pound of duck-shot went out with a\nblaze on the dancers. You may suppose what their dancing was, and their\nreeling how changed to staggering, and their music none of the sweetest.\nOne of them fell into the rick, and was burned, and buried in a ditch\nnext day; but the others were set upon their horses, and carried home\non a path of blood. And strange to say, they never avenged this very\ndreadful injury; but having heard that a woman had fired this desperate\nshot among them, they said that she ought to be a Doone, and inquired\nhow old she was.\n\nNow I had not been so very long waiting in our mow-yard, with my best\ngun ready, and a big club by me, before a heaviness of sleep began to\ncreep upon me. The flow of water was in my ears, and in my eyes a hazy\nspreading, and upon my brain a closure, as a cobbler sews a vamp up. So\nI leaned back in the clover-rick, and the dust of the seed and the smell\ncame round me, without any trouble; and I dozed about Lorna, just once\nor twice, and what she had said about new-mown hay; and then back went\nmy head, and my chin went up; and if ever a man was blest with slumber,\ndown it came upon me, and away went I into it.\n\nNow this was very vile of me, and against all good resolutions, even\nsuch as I would have sworn to an hour ago or less. But if you had been\nin the water as I had, ay, and had long fight with it, after a good\nday's work, and then great anxiety afterwards, and brain-work (which is\nnot fair for me), and upon that a stout supper, mayhap you would not be\nso hard on my sleep; though you felt it your duty to wake me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nMAIDEN SENTINELS ARE BEST\n\n[Illustration: 432.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nIt was not likely that the outlaws would attack out premises until some\ntime after the moon was risen; because it would be too dangerous to\ncross the flooded valleys in the darkness of the night. And but for this\nconsideration, I must have striven harder against the stealthy\napproach of slumber. But even so, it was very foolish to abandon watch,\nespecially in such as I, who sleep like any dormouse. Moreover, I had\nchosen the very worst place in the world for such employment, with a\ngoodly chance of awakening in a bed of solid fire.\n\nAnd so it might have been, nay, it must have been, but for Lorna's\nvigilance. Her light hand upon my arm awoke me, not too readily; and\nleaping up, I seized my club, and prepared to knock down somebody.\n\n\"Who's that?\" I cried; \"stand back, I say, and let me have fair chance\nat you.\"\n\n\"Are you going to knock me down, dear John?\" replied the voice I loved\nso well; \"I am sure I should never get up again, after one blow from\nyou, John.\"\n\n\"My darling, is it you?\" I cried; \"and breaking all your orders? Come\nback into the house at once: and nothing on your head, dear!\"\n\n\"How could I sleep, while at any moment you might be killed beneath my\nwindow? And now is the time of real danger; for men can see to travel.\"\n\nI saw at once the truth of this. The moon was high and clearly lighting\nall the watered valleys. To sleep any longer might be death, not only to\nmyself, but all.\n\n[Illustration: 433.jpg The moon was high]\n\n\"The man on guard at the back of the house is fast asleep,\" she\ncontinued; \"Gwenny, who let me out, and came with me, has heard him\nsnoring for two hours. I think the women ought to be the watch, because\nthey have had no travelling. Where do you suppose little Gwenny is?\"\n\n\"Surely not gone to Glen Doone?\" I was not sure, however: for I could\nbelieve almost anything of the Cornish maiden's hardihood.\n\n\"No,\" replied Lorna, \"although she wanted even to do that. But of course\nI would not hear of it, on account of the swollen waters. But she is\nperched on yonder tree, which commands the Barrow valley. She says that\nthey are almost sure to cross the streamlet there; and now it is so wide\nand large, that she can trace it in the moonlight, half a mile beyond\nher. If they cross, she is sure to see them, and in good time to let us\nknow.\"\n\n\"What a shame,\" I cried, \"that the men should sleep, and the maidens\nbe the soldiers! I will sit in that tree myself, and send little Gwenny\nback to you. Go to bed, my best and dearest; I will take good care not\nto sleep again.\"\n\n\"Please not to send me away, dear John,\" she answered very mournfully;\n\"you and I have been together through perils worse than this. I shall\nonly be more timid, and more miserable, indoors.\"\n\n\"I cannot let you stay here,\" I said; \"it is altogether impossible. Do\nyou suppose that I can fight, with you among the bullets, Lorna? If this\nis the way you mean to take it, we had better go both to the apple-room,\nand lock ourselves in, and hide under the tiles, and let them burn all\nthe rest of the premises.\"\n\nAt this idea Lorna laughed, as I could see by the moonlight; and then\nshe said,--\n\n\"You are right, John. I should only do more harm than good: and of all\nthings I hate fighting most, and disobedience next to it. Therefore I\nwill go indoors, although I cannot go to bed. But promise me one thing,\ndearest John. You will keep yourself out of the way, now won't you, as\nmuch as you can, for my sake?\"\n\n\"Of that you may be quite certain, Lorna. I will shoot them all through\nthe hay-ricks.\"\n\n\"That is right, dear,\" she answered, never doubting but what I could do\nit; \"and then they cannot see you, you know. But don't think of climbing\nthat tree, John; it is a great deal too dangerous. It is all very well\nfor Gwenny; she has no bones to break.\"\n\n\"None worth breaking, you mean, I suppose. Very well; I will not climb\nthe tree, for I should defeat my own purpose, I fear; being such a\nconspicuous object. Now go indoors, darling, without more words. The\nmore you linger, the more I shall keep you.\"\n\nShe laughed her own bright laugh at this, and only said, \"God keep you,\nlove!\" and then away she tripped across the yard, with the step I loved\nto watch so. And thereupon I shouldered arms, and resolved to tramp till\nmorning. For I was vexed at my own neglect, and that Lorna should have\nto right it.\n\nBut before I had been long on duty, making the round of the ricks and\nstables, and hailing Gwenny now and then from the bottom of her tree,\na short wide figure stole towards me, in and out the shadows, and I saw\nthat it was no other than the little maid herself, and that she bore\nsome tidings.\n\n\"Ten on 'em crossed the watter down yonner,\" said Gwenny, putting her\nhand to her mouth, and seeming to regard it as good news rather than\notherwise: \"be arl craping up by hedgerow now. I could shutt dree on 'em\nfrom the bar of the gate, if so be I had your goon, young man.\"\n\n\"There is no time to lose, Gwenny. Run to the house and fetch Master\nStickles, and all the men; while I stay here, and watch the rick-yard.\"\n\nPerhaps I was wrong in heeding the ricks at such a time as that;\nespecially as only the clover was of much importance. But it seemed\nto me like a sort of triumph that they should be even able to boast of\nhaving fired our mow-yard. Therefore I stood in a nick of the clover,\nwhence we had cut some trusses, with my club in hand, and gun close by.\n\nThe robbers rode into our yard as coolly as if they had been invited,\nhaving lifted the gate from the hinges first on account of its being\nfastened. Then they actually opened our stable-doors, and turned our\nhonest horses out, and put their own rogues in the place of them. At\nthis my breath was quite taken away; for we think so much of our horses.\nBy this time I could see our troopers, waiting in the shadow of the\nhouse, round the corner from where the Doones were, and expecting the\norder to fire. But Jeremy Stickles very wisely kept them in readiness,\nuntil the enemy should advance upon them.\n\n\"Two of you lazy fellows go,\" it was the deep voice of Carver Doone,\n\"and make us a light, to cut their throats by. Only one thing, once\nagain. If any man touches Lorna, I will stab him where he stands. She\nbelongs to me. There are two other young damsels here, whom you may take\naway if you please. And the mother, I hear, is still comely. Now for our\nrights. We have borne too long the insolence of these yokels. Kill every\nman, and every child, and burn the cursed place down.\"\n\nAs he spoke thus blasphemously, I set my gun against his breast; and\nby the light buckled from his belt, I saw the little \"sight\" of brass\ngleaming alike upon either side, and the sleek round barrel glimmering.\nThe aim was sure as death itself. If I only drew the trigger (which\nwent very lightly) Carver Doone would breathe no more. And yet--will you\nbelieve me?--I could not pull the trigger. Would to God that I had done\nso!\n\nFor I never had taken human life, neither done bodily harm to man;\nbeyond the little bruises, and the trifling aches and pains, which\nfollow a good and honest bout in the wrestling ring. Therefore I\ndropped my carbine, and grasped again my club, which seemed a more\nstraight-forward implement.\n\nPresently two young men came towards me, bearing brands of resined hemp,\nkindled from Carver's lamp. The foremost of them set his torch to the\nrick within a yard of me, and smoke concealing me from him. I struck\nhim with a back-handed blow on the elbow, as he bent it; and I heard the\nbone of his arm break, as clearly as ever I heard a twig snap. With a\nroar of pain he fell on the ground, and his torch dropped there, and\nsinged him. The other man stood amazed at this, not having yet gained\nsight of me; till I caught his firebrand from his hand, and struck it\ninto his countenance. With that he leaped at me; but I caught him, in a\nmanner learned from early wrestling, and snapped his collar-bone, as I\nlaid him upon the top of his comrade.\n\nThis little success so encouraged me, that I was half inclined to\nadvance, and challenge Carver Doone to meet me; but I bore in mind that\nhe would be apt to shoot me without ceremony; and what is the utmost of\nhuman strength against the power of powder? Moreover, I remembered my\npromise to sweet Lorna; and who would be left to defend her, if the\nrogues got rid of me?\n\nWhile I was hesitating thus (for I always continue to hesitate, except\nin actual conflict), a blaze of fire lit up the house, and brown smoke\nhung around it. Six of our men had let go at the Doones, by Jeremy\nStickles' order, as the villains came swaggering down in the moonlight\nready for rape or murder. Two of them fell, and the rest hung back, to\nthink at their leisure what this was. They were not used to this sort of\nthing: it was neither just nor courteous.\n\nBeing unable any longer to contain myself, as I thought of Lorna's\nexcitement at all this noise of firing, I came across the yard,\nexpecting whether they would shoot at me. However, no one shot at me;\nand I went up to Carver Doone, whom I knew by his size in the moonlight,\nand I took him by the beard, and said, \"Do you call yourself a man?\"\n\n[Illustration: 437.jpg I took him by the beard]\n\nFor a moment he was so astonished that he could not answer. None had\never dared, I suppose, to look at him in that way; and he saw that he\nhad met his equal, or perhaps his master. And then he tried a pistol at\nme, but I was too quick for him.\n\n\"Now, Carver Doone, take warning,\" I said to him, very soberly; \"you\nhave shown yourself a fool by your contempt of me. I may not be your\nmatch in craft; but I am in manhood. You are a despicable villain. Lie\nlow in your native muck.\"\n\nAnd with that word, I laid him flat upon his back in our straw-yard, by\na trick of the inner heel, which he could not have resisted (though his\nstrength had been twice as great as mine), unless he were a wrestler.\nSeeing him down the others ran, though one of them made a shot at me,\nand some of them got their horses, before our men came up; and some went\naway without them. And among these last was Captain Carver who arose,\nwhile I was feeling myself (for I had a little wound), and strode away\nwith a train of curses enough to poison the light of the moon.\n\nWe gained six very good horses, by this attempted rapine, as well as\ntwo young prisoners, whom I had smitten by the clover-rick. And two\ndead Doones were left behind, whom (as we buried them in the churchyard,\nwithout any service over them), I for my part was most thankful that\nI had not killed. For to have the life of a fellow-man laid upon one's\nconscience--deserved he his death, or deserved it not--is to my sense of\nright and wrong the heaviest of all burdens; and the one that wears most\ndeeply inwards, with the dwelling of the mind on this view and on that\nof it.\n\nI was inclined to pursue the enemy and try to capture more of them; but\nJeremy Stickles would not allow it, for he said that all the advantage\nwould be upon their side, if we went hurrying after them, with only the\nmoon to guide us. And who could tell but what there might be another\nband of them, ready to fall upon the house, and burn it, and seize the\nwomen, if we left them unprotected? When he put the case thus, I was\nglad enough to abide by his decision. And one thing was quite certain,\nthat the Doones had never before received so rude a shock, and so\nviolent a blow to their supremacy, since first they had built up their\npower, and become the Lords of Exmoor. I knew that Carver Doone would\ngnash those mighty teeth of his, and curse the men around him, for\nthe blunder (which was in truth his own) of over-confidence and\ncarelessness. And at the same time, all the rest would feel that such a\nthing had never happened, while old Sir Ensor was alive; and that it was\ncaused by nothing short of gross mismanagement.\n\nI scarcely know who made the greatest fuss about my little wound,\nmother, or Annie, or Lorna. I was heartily ashamed to be so treated like\na milksop; but most unluckily it had been impossible to hide it. For the\nball had cut along my temple, just above the eyebrow; and being fired so\nnear at hand, the powder too had scarred me. Therefore it seemed a great\ndeal worse than it really was; and the sponging, and the plastering,\nand the sobbing, and the moaning, made me quite ashamed to look Master\nStickles in the face.\n\nHowever, at last I persuaded them that I had no intention of giving up\nthe ghost that night; and then they all fell to, and thanked God with an\nemphasis quite unknown in church. And hereupon Master Stickles said, in\nhis free and easy manner (for no one courted his observation), that I\nwas the luckiest of all mortals in having a mother, and a sister, and\na sweetheart, to make much of me. For his part, he said, he was just as\nwell off in not having any to care for him. For now he might go and get\nshot, or stabbed, or knocked on the head, at his pleasure, without any\none being offended. I made bold, upon this, to ask him what was become\nof his wife; for I had heard him speak of having one. He said that he\nneither knew nor cared; and perhaps I should be like him some day.\nThat Lorna should hear such sentiments was very grievous to me. But she\nlooked at me with a smile, which proved her contempt for all such\nideas; and lest anything still more unfit might be said, I dismissed the\nquestion.\n\nBut Master Stickles told me afterwards, when there was no one with us,\nto have no faith in any woman, whatever she might seem to be. For he\nassured me that now he possessed very large experience, for so small\na matter; being thoroughly acquainted with women of every class, from\nladies of the highest blood, to Bonarobas, and peasants' wives: and that\nthey all might be divided into three heads and no more; that is to\nsay as follows. First, the very hot and passionate, who were only\ncontemptible; second, the cold and indifferent, who were simply odious;\nand third, the mixture of the other two, who had the bad qualities of\nboth. As for reason, none of them had it; it was like a sealed book to\nthem, which if they ever tried to open, they began at the back of the\ncover.\n\nNow I did not like to hear such things; and to me they appeared to be\ninsolent, as well as narrow-minded. For if you came to that, why might\nnot men, as well as women, be divided into the same three classes,\nand be pronounced upon by women, as beings even more devoid than their\ngentle judges of reason? Moreover, I knew, both from my own sense, and\nfrom the greatest of all great poets, that there are, and always have\nbeen, plenty of women, good, and gentle, warm-hearted, loving, and\nlovable; very keen, moreover, at seeing the right, be it by reason, or\notherwise. And upon the whole, I prefer them much to the people of my\nown sex, as goodness of heart is more important than to show good reason\nfor having it. And so I said to Jeremy,--\n\n\"You have been ill-treated, perhaps, Master Stickles, by some woman or\nother?\"\n\n\"Ah, that have I,\" he replied with an oath; \"and the last on earth who\nshould serve me so, the woman who was my wife. A woman whom I never\nstruck, never wronged in any way, never even let her know that I like\nanother better. And yet when I was at Berwick last, with the regiment\non guard there against those vile moss-troopers, what does that woman\ndo but fly in the face of all authority, and of my especial business, by\nrunning away herself with the biggest of all moss-troopers? Not that I\ncared a groat about her; and I wish the fool well rid of her: but the\ninsolence of the thing was such that everybody laughed at me; and back\nI went to London, losing a far better and safer job than this; and all\nthrough her. Come, let's have another onion.\"\n\nMaster Stickles's view of the matter was so entirely unromantic, that I\nscarcely wondered at Mistress Stickles for having run away from him to\nan adventurous moss-trooper. For nine women out of ten must have some\nkind of romance or other, to make their lives endurable; and when their\nlove has lost this attractive element, this soft dew-fog (if such\nit be), the love itself is apt to languish; unless its bloom be well\nreplaced by the budding hopes of children. Now Master Stickles neither\nhad, nor wished to have, any children.\n\nWithout waiting for any warrant, only saying something about \"captus in\nflagrante delicto,\"--if that be the way to spell it--Stickles sent our\nprisoners off, bound and looking miserable, to the jail at Taunton. I\nwas desirous to let them go free, if they would promise amendment; but\nalthough I had taken them, and surely therefore had every right to let\nthem go again, Master Stickles said, \"Not so.\" He assured me that it was\na matter of public polity; and of course, not knowing what he meant,\nI could not contradict him; but thought that surely my private rights\nought to be respected. For if I throw a man in wrestling, I expect to\nget his stakes; and if I take a man prisoner--why, he ought, in common\njustice, to belong to me, and I have a good right to let him go, if I\nthink proper to do so. However, Master Stickles said that I was quite\nbenighted, and knew nothing of the Constitution; which was the very\nthing I knew, beyond any man in our parish!\n\n[Illustration: 440.jpg Annie bound the broken arm]\n\nNevertheless, it was not for me to contradict a commissioner; and\ntherefore I let my prisoners go, and wished them a happy deliverance.\nStickles replied, with a merry grin, that if ever they got it, it would\nbe a jail deliverance, and the bliss of dancing; and he laid his hand to\nhis throat in a manner which seemed to me most uncourteous. However, his\nforesight proved too correct; for both those poor fellows were executed,\nsoon after the next assizes. Lorna had done her very best to earn\nanother chance for them; even going down on her knees to that common\nJeremy, and pleading with great tears for them. However, although much\nmoved by her, he vowed that he durst do nothing else. To set them free\nwas more than his own life was worth; for all the country knew, by this\ntime, that two captive Doones were roped to the cider-press at Plover's\nBarrows. Annie bound the broken arm of the one whom I had knocked down\nwith the club, and I myself supported it; and then she washed and\nrubbed with lard the face of the other poor fellow, which the torch had\ninjured; and I fetched back his collar-bone to the best of my ability.\nFor before any surgeon could arrive, they were off with a well-armed\nescort. That day we were reinforced so strongly from the stations along\nthe coast, even as far as Minehead, that we not only feared no further\nattack, but even talked of assaulting Glen Doone, without waiting\nfor the train-bands. However, I thought that it would be mean to take\nadvantage of the enemy in the thick of the floods and confusion; and\nseveral of the others thought so too, and did not like fighting in\nwater. Therefore it was resolved to wait and keep a watch upon the\nvalley, and let the floods go down again.\n\n[Illustration: 441.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nA MERRY MEETING A SAD ONE\n\n[Illustration: 442.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nNow the business I had most at heart (as every one knows by this time)\nwas to marry Lorna as soon as might be, if she had no objection, and\nthen to work the farm so well, as to nourish all our family. And herein\nI saw no difficulty; for Annie would soon be off our hands, and somebody\nmight come and take a fancy to little Lizzie (who was growing up very\nnicely now, though not so fine as Annie); moreover, we were almost sure\nto have great store of hay and corn after so much snow, if there be any\ntruth in the old saying,--\n\n    \"A foot deep of rain\n     Will kill hay and grain;\n     But three feet of snow\n     Will make them come mo'.\"\n\nAnd although it was too true that we had lost a many cattle, yet even so\nwe had not lost money; for the few remaining fetched such prices as\nwere never known before. And though we grumbled with all our hearts,\nand really believed, at one time, that starvation was upon us, I doubt\nwhether, on the whole, we were not the fatter, and the richer, and the\nwiser for that winter. And I might have said the happier, except for the\nsorrow which we felt at the failures among our neighbours. The Snowes\nlost every sheep they had, and nine out of ten horned cattle; and poor\nJasper Kebby would have been forced to throw up the lease of his farm,\nand perhaps to go to prison, but for the help we gave him.\n\nHowever, my dear mother would have it that Lorna was too young, as yet,\nto think of being married: and indeed I myself was compelled to admit\nthat her form was becoming more perfect and lovely; though I had not\nthought it possible. And another difficulty was, that as we had all\nbeen Protestants from the time of Queen Elizabeth, the maiden must be\nconverted first, and taught to hate all Papists. Now Lorna had not the\nsmallest idea of ever being converted. She said that she loved me truly,\nbut wanted not to convert me; and if I loved her equally, why should I\nwish to convert her? With this I was tolerably content, not seeing so\nvery much difference between a creed and a credo, and believing God to\nbe our Father, in Latin as well as English. Moreover, my darling knew\nbut little of the Popish ways--whether excellent or otherwise--inasmuch\nas the Doones, though they stole their houses, or at least the joiner's\nwork, had never been tempted enough by the devil to steal either church\nor chapel.\n\nLorna came to our little church, when Parson Bowden reappeared after the\nsnow was over; and she said that all was very nice, and very like what\nshe had seen in the time of her Aunt Sabina, when they went far away to\nthe little chapel, with a shilling in their gloves. It made the tears\ncome into her eyes, by the force of memory, when Parson Bowden did the\nthings, not so gracefully nor so well, yet with pleasant imitation of\nher old Priest's sacred rites.\n\n\"He is a worthy man,\" she said, being used to talk in the service time,\nand my mother was obliged to cough: \"I like him very much indeed: but I\nwish he would let me put his things the right way on his shoulders.\"\n\nEverybody in our parish, who could walk at all, or hire a boy and a\nwheelbarrow, ay, and half the folk from Countisbury, Brendon, and even\nLynmouth, was and were to be found that Sunday, in our little church\nof Oare. People who would not come anigh us, when the Doones were\nthreatening with carbine and with fire-brand, flocked in their very best\nclothes, to see a lady Doone go to church. Now all this came of that\nvile John Fry; I knew it as well as possible; his tongue was worse than\nthe clacker of a charity-school bell, or the ladle in the frying-pan,\nwhen the bees are swarming.\n\nHowever, Lorna was not troubled; partly because of her natural dignity\nand gentleness; partly because she never dreamed that the people were\ncome to look at her. But when we came to the Psalms of the day, with\nsome vague sense of being stared at more than ought to be, she dropped\nthe heavy black lace fringing of the velvet hat she wore, and concealed\nfrom the congregation all except her bright red lips, and the oval\nsnowdrift of her chin. I touched her hand, and she pressed mine; and we\nfelt that we were close together, and God saw no harm in it.\n\nAs for Parson Bowden (as worthy a man as ever lived, and one who could\nshoot flying), he scarcely knew what he was doing, without the clerk to\nhelp him. He had borne it very well indeed, when I returned from London;\nbut to see a live Doone in his church, and a lady Doone, and a lovely\nDoone, moreover one engaged to me, upon whom he almost looked as the\nSquire of his parish (although not rightly an Armiger), and to feel that\nthis lovely Doone was a Papist, and therefore of higher religion--as all\nour parsons think--and that she knew exactly how he ought to do all\nthe service, of which he himself knew little; I wish to express my firm\nbelief that all these things together turned Parson Bowden's head a\nlittle, and made him look to me for orders.\n\nMy mother, the very best of women, was (as I could well perceive) a\nlittle annoyed and vexed with things. For this particular occasion,\nshe had procured from Dulverton, by special message to Ruth Huckaback\n(whereof more anon), a head-dress with a feather never seen before upon\nExmoor, to the best of every one's knowledge. It came from a bird\ncalled a flaming something--a flaming oh, or a flaming ah, I will not be\npositive--but I can assure you that it did flame; and dear mother had no\nother thought, but that all the congregation would neither see nor think\nof any other mortal thing, or immortal even, to the very end of the\nsermon.\n\nHerein she was so disappointed, that no sooner did she get home, but\nupstairs she went at speed, not even stopping at the mirror in our\nlittle parlour, and flung the whole thing into a cupboard, as I knew by\nthe bang of the door, having eased the lock for her lately. Lorna saw\nthere was something wrong; and she looked at Annie and Lizzie (as more\nlikely to understand it) with her former timid glance; which I knew so\nwell, and which had first enslaved me.\n\n\"I know not what ails mother,\" said Annie, who looked very beautiful,\nwith lilac lute-string ribbons, which I saw the Snowe girls envying;\n\"but she has not attended to one of the prayers, nor said 'Amen,' all\nthe morning. Never fear, darling Lorna, it is nothing about you. It is\nsomething about our John, I am sure; for she never worries herself very\nmuch about anybody but him.\" And here Annie made a look at me, such as I\nhad had five hundred of.\n\n\"You keep your opinions to yourself,\" I replied; because I knew the\ndear, and her little bits of jealousy; \"it happens that you are quite\nwrong, this time. Lorna, come with me, my darling.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Lorna; go with him,\" cried Lizzie, dropping her lip, in a way\nwhich you must see to know its meaning; \"John wants nobody now but you;\nand none can find fault with his taste, dear.\"\n\n\"You little fool, I should think not,\" I answered, very rudely; for,\nbetwixt the lot of them, my Lorna's eyelashes were quivering; \"now,\ndearest angel, come with me; and snap your hands at the whole of them.\"\n\nMy angel did come, with a sigh, and then with a smile, when we were\nalone; but without any unangelic attempt at snapping her sweet white\nfingers.\n\nThese little things are enough to show that while every one so admired\nLorna, and so kindly took to her, still there would, just now and then,\nbe petty and paltry flashes of jealousy concerning her; and perhaps\nit could not be otherwise among so many women. However, we were always\ndoubly kind to her afterwards; and although her mind was so sensitive\nand quick that she must have suffered, she never allowed us to perceive\nit, nor lowered herself by resenting it.\n\nPossibly I may have mentioned that little Ruth Huckaback had been asked,\nand had even promised to spend her Christmas with us; and this was the\nmore desirable, because she had left us through some offence, or sorrow,\nabout things said of her. Now my dear mother, being the kindest and\nbest-hearted of all women, could not bear that poor dear Ruth (who would\nsome day have such a fortune), should be entirely lost to us. \"It is our\nduty, my dear children,\" she said more than once about it, \"to forgive\nand forget, as freely as we hope to have it done to us. If dear little\nRuth has not behaved quite as we might have expected, great allowance\nshould be made for a girl with so much money. Designing people get hold\nof her, and flatter her, and coax her, to obtain a base influence over\nher; so that when she falls among simple folk, who speak the honest\ntruth of her, no wonder the poor child is vexed, and gives herself airs,\nand so on. Ruth can be very useful to us in a number of little ways; and\nI consider it quite a duty to pardon her freak of petulance.\"\n\nNow one of the little ways in which Ruth had been very useful, was the\npurchase of the scarlet feathers of the flaming bird; and now that\nthe house was quite safe from attack, and the mark on my forehead was\nhealing, I was begged, over and over again, to go and see Ruth, and make\nall things straight, and pay for the gorgeous plumage. This last I was\nvery desirous to do, that I might know the price of it, having made\na small bet on the subject with Annie; and having held counsel with\nmyself, whether or not it were possible to get something of the kind for\nLorna, of still more distinguished appearance. Of course she could not\nwear scarlet as yet, even if I had wished it; but I believed that people\nof fashion often wore purple for mourning; purple too was the royal\ncolour, and Lorna was by right a queen; therefore I was quite resolved\nto ransack Uncle Reuben's stores, in search of some bright purple bird,\nif nature had kindly provided one.\n\nAll this, however, I kept to myself, intending to trust Ruth Huckaback,\nand no one else in the matter. And so, one beautiful spring morning,\nwhen all the earth was kissed with scent, and all the air caressed with\nsong, up the lane I stoutly rode, well armed, and well provided.\n\nNow though it is part of my life to heed, it is no part of my tale to\ntell, how the wheat was coming on. I reckon that you, who read this\nstory, after I am dead and gone (and before that none shall read it),\nwill say, \"Tush! What is his wheat to us? We are not wheat: we are human\nbeings: and all we care for is human doings.\" This may be very good\nargument, and in the main, I believe that it is so. Nevertheless, if a\nman is to tell only what he thought and did, and not what came around\nhim, he must not mention his own clothes, which his father and mother\nbought for him. And more than my own clothes to me, ay, and as much as\nmy own skin, are the works of nature round about, whereof a man is the\nsmallest.\n\nAnd now I will tell you, although most likely only to be laughed at,\nbecause I cannot put it in the style of Mr. Dryden--whom to compare to\nShakespeare! but if once I begin upon that, you will never hear the last\nof me--nevertheless, I will tell you this; not wishing to be rude, but\nonly just because I know it; the more a man can fling his arms (so\nto say) round Nature's neck, the more he can upon her bosom, like an\ninfant, lie and suck,--the more that man shall earn the trust and love\nof all his fellow men.\n\nIn this matter is no jealousy (when the man is dead); because thereafter\nall others know how much of the milk be had; and he can suck no longer;\nand they value him accordingly, for the nourishment he is to them. Even\nas when we keep a roaster of the sucking-pigs, we choose, and praise at\ntable most, the favourite of its mother. Fifty times have I seen this,\nand smiled, and praised our people's taste, and offered them more of the\nvitals.\n\nNow here am I upon Shakespeare (who died, of his own fruition, at the\nage of fifty-two, yet lived more than fifty thousand men, within his\nlittle span of life), when all the while I ought to be riding as hard as\nI can to Dulverton. But, to tell the truth, I could not ride hard, being\nheld at every turn, and often without any turn at all, by the beauty\nof things around me. These things grow upon a man if once he stops to\nnotice them.\n\nIt wanted yet two hours to noon, when I came to Master Huckaback's door,\nand struck the panels smartly. Knowing nothing of their manners, only\nthat people in a town could not be expected to entertain (as we do in\nfarm-houses), having, moreover, keen expectation of Master Huckaback's\navarice, I had brought some stuff to eat, made by Annie, and packed by\nLorna, and requiring no thinking about it.\n\nRuth herself came and let me in, blushing very heartily; for which\ncolour I praised her health, and my praises heightened it. That little\nthing had lovely eyes, and could be trusted thoroughly. I do like an\nobstinate little woman, when she is sure that she is right. And indeed\nif love had never sped me straight to the heart of Lorna (compared to\nwhom, Ruth was no more than the thief is to the candle), who knows but\nwhat I might have yielded to the law of nature, that thorough trimmer of\nbalances, and verified the proverb that the giant loves the dwarf?\n\n\"I take the privilege, Mistress Ruth, of saluting you according to\nkinship, and the ordering of the Canons.\" And therewith I bussed her\nwell, and put my arm around her waist, being so terribly restricted in\nthe matter of Lorna, and knowing the use of practice. Not that I had any\nwarmth--all that was darling Lorna's--only out of pure gallantry, and my\nknowledge of London fashions. Ruth blushed to such a pitch at this, and\nlooked up at me with such a gleam; as if I must have my own way; that\nall my love of kissing sunk, and I felt that I was wronging her. Only\nmy mother had told me, when the girls were out of the way, to do all I\ncould to please darling Ruth, and I had gone about it accordingly.\n\nNow Ruth as yet had never heard a word about dear Lorna; and when she\nled me into the kitchen (where everything looked beautiful), and told me\nnot to mind, for a moment, about the scrubbing of my boots, because she\nwould only be too glad to clean it all up after me, and told me how glad\nshe was to see me, blushing more at every word, and recalling some of\nthem, and stooping down for pots and pans, when I looked at her too\nruddily--all these things came upon me so, without any legal notice,\nthat I could only look at Ruth, and think how very good she was, and how\nbright her handles were; and wonder if I had wronged her. Once or twice,\nI began--this I say upon my honour--to endeavour to explain exactly, how\nwe were at Plover's Barrows; how we all had been bound to fight, and had\ndefeated the enemy, keeping their queen amongst us. But Ruth would\nmake some great mistake between Lorna and Gwenny Carfax, and gave me no\nchance to set her aright, and cared about nothing much, except some news\nof Sally Snowe.\n\nWhat could I do with this little thing? All my sense of modesty, and\nvalue for my dinner, were against my over-pressing all the graceful\nhints I had given about Lorna. Ruth was just a girl of that sort, who\nwill not believe one word, except from her own seeing; not so much\nfrom any doubt, as from the practice of using eyes which have been in\nbusiness.\n\nI asked Cousin Ruth (as we used to call her, though the cousinship was\ndistant) what was become of Uncle Ben, and how it was that we never\nheard anything of or from him now. She replied that she hardly knew\nwhat to make of her grandfather's manner of carrying on, for the last\nhalf-year or more. He was apt to leave his home, she said, at any hour\nof the day or night; going none knew whither, and returning no one\nmight say when. And his dress, in her opinion, was enough to frighten\na hodman, of a scavenger of the roads, instead of the decent suit\nof kersey, or of Sabbath doeskins, such as had won the respect and\nreverence of his fellow-townsmen. But the worst of all things was, as\nshe confessed with tears in her eyes, that the poor old gentleman had\nsomething weighing heavily on his mind.\n\n\"It will shorten his days, Cousin Ridd,\" she said, for she never would\ncall me Cousin John; \"he has no enjoyment of anything that he eats or\ndrinks, nor even in counting his money, as he used to do all Sunday;\nindeed no pleasure in anything, unless it be smoking his pipe, and\nthinking and staring at bits of brown stone, which he pulls, every now\nand then, out of his pockets. And the business he used to take such\npride in is now left almost entirely to the foreman, and to me.\"\n\n\"And what will become of you, dear Ruth, if anything happens to the old\nman?\"\n\n\"I am sure I know not,\" she answered simply; \"and I cannot bear to think\nof it. It must depend, I suppose, upon dear grandfather's pleasure about\nme.\"\n\n\"It must rather depend,\" said I, though having no business to say it,\n\"upon your own good pleasure, Ruth; for all the world will pay court to\nyou.\"\n\n\"That is the very thing which I never could endure. I have begged dear\ngrandfather to leave no chance of that. When he has threatened me with\npoverty, as he does sometimes, I have always met him truly, with the\nanswer that I feared one thing a great deal worse than poverty; namely,\nto be an heiress. But I cannot make him believe it. Only think how\nstrange, Cousin Ridd, I cannot make him believe it.\"\n\n\"It is not strange at all,\" I answered; \"considering how he values\nmoney. Neither would any one else believe you, except by looking into\nyour true, and very pretty eyes, dear.\"\n\nNow I beg that no one will suspect for a single moment, either that I\ndid not mean exactly what I said, or meant a single atom more, or would\nnot have said the same, if Lorna had been standing by. What I had always\nliked in Ruth, was the calm, straightforward gaze, and beauty of her\nlarge brown eyes. Indeed I had spoken of them to Lorna, as the only ones\nto be compared (though not for more than a moment) to her own, for truth\nand light, but never for depth and softness. But now the little maiden\ndropped them, and turned away, without reply.\n\n\"I will go and see to my horse,\" I said; \"the boy that has taken him\nseemed surprised at his having no horns on his forehead. Perhaps he will\nlead him into the shop, and feed him upon broadcloth.\"\n\n\"Oh, he is such a stupid boy,\" Ruth answered with great sympathy: \"how\nquick of you to observe that now: and you call yourself 'Slow John\nRidd!' I never did see such a stupid boy: sometimes he spoils my temper.\nBut you must be back in half an hour, at the latest, Cousin Ridd. You\nsee I remember what you are; when once you get among horses, or cows, or\nthings of that sort.\"\n\n\"Things of that sort! Well done, Ruth! One would think you were quite a\nCockney.\"\n\nUncle Reuben did not come home to his dinner; and his granddaughter said\nshe had strictest orders never to expect him. Therefore we had none to\ndine with us, except the foreman of the shop, a worthy man, named\nThomas Cockram, fifty years of age or so. He seemed to me to have strong\nintentions of his own about little Ruth, and on that account to regard\nme with a wholly undue malevolence. And perhaps, in order to justify\nhim, I may have been more attentive to her than otherwise need have\nbeen; at any rate, Ruth and I were pleasant; and he the very opposite.\n\n\"My dear Cousin Ruth,\" I said, on purpose to vex Master Cockram, because\nhe eyed us so heavily, and squinted to unluckily, \"we have long been\nlooking for you at our Plover's Barrows farm. You remember how you used\nto love hunting for eggs in the morning, and hiding up in the tallat\nwith Lizzie, for me to seek you among the hay, when the sun was down.\nAh, Master Cockram, those are the things young people find\ntheir pleasure in, not in selling a yard of serge, and giving\ntwopence-halfpenny change, and writing 'settled' at the bottom, with a\npencil that has blacked their teeth. Now, Master Cockram, you ought to\ncome as far as our good farm, at once, and eat two new-laid eggs for\nbreakfast, and be made to look quite young again. Our good Annie would\ncook for you; and you should have the hot new milk and the pope's eye\nfrom the mutton; and every foot of you would become a yard in about a\nfortnight.\" And hereupon, I spread my chest, to show him an example.\nRuth could not keep her countenance: but I saw that she thought it wrong\nof me; and would scold me, if ever I gave her the chance of taking those\nlittle liberties. However, he deserved it all, according to my young\nideas, for his great impertinence in aiming at my cousin.\n\nBut what I said was far less grievous to a man of honest mind than\nlittle Ruth's own behaviour. I could hardly have believed that so\nthoroughly true a girl, and one so proud and upright, could have got rid\nof any man so cleverly as she got rid of Master Thomas Cockram. She gave\nhim not even a glass of wine, but commended to his notice, with a sweet\nand thoughtful gravity, some invoice which must be corrected, before her\ndear grandfather should return; and to amend which three great ledgers\nmust be searched from first to last. Thomas Cockram winked at me, with\nthe worst of his two wrong eyes; as much as to say, \"I understand it;\nbut I cannot help myself. Only you look out, if ever\"--and before he had\nfinished winking, the door was shut behind him. Then Ruth said to me in\nthe simplest manner, \"You have ridden far today, Cousin Ridd; and have\nfar to ride to get home again. What will dear Aunt Ridd say, if we send\nyou away without nourishment? All the keys are in my keeping, and\ndear grandfather has the finest wine, not to be matched in the west of\nEngland, as I have heard good judges say; though I know not wine from\ncider. Do you like the wine of Oporto, or the wine of Xeres?\"\n\n\"I know not one from the other, fair cousin, except by the colour,\" I\nanswered: \"but the sound of Oporto is nobler, and richer. Suppose we try\nwine of Oporto.\"\n\nThe good little creature went and fetched a black bottle of an ancient\ncast, covered with dust and cobwebs. These I was anxious to shake aside;\nand indeed I thought that the wine would be better for being roused up a\nlittle. Ruth, however, would not hear a single word to that purport;\nand seeing that she knew more about it, I left her to manage it. And the\nresult was very fine indeed, to wit, a sparkling rosy liquor, dancing\nwith little flakes of light, and scented like new violets. With this I\nwas so pleased and gay, and Ruth so glad to see me gay, that we quite\nforgot how the time went on; and though my fair cousin would not be\npersuaded to take a second glass herself, she kept on filling mine so\nfast that it was never empty, though I did my best to keep it so.\n\n\"What is a little drop like this to a man of your size and strength,\nCousin Ridd?\" she said, with her cheeks just brushed with rose, which\nmade her look very beautiful; \"I have heard you say that your head is so\nthick--or rather so clear, you ought to say--that no liquor ever moves\nit.\"\n\n\"That is right enough,\" I answered; \"what a witch you must be, dear\nRuth, to have remembered that now!\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember every word I have ever heard you say, Cousin Ridd;\nbecause your voice is so deep, you know, and you talk so little. Now\nit is useless to say 'no'. These bottles hold almost nothing. Dear\ngrandfather will not come home, I fear, until long after you are gone.\nWhat will Aunt Ridd think of me, I am sure? You are all so dreadfully\nhospitable. Now not another 'no,' Cousin Ridd. We must have another\nbottle.\"\n\n\"Well, must is must,\" I answered, with a certain resignation. \"I cannot\nbear bad manners, dear; and how old are you next birthday?\"\n\n\"Eighteen, dear John;\" said Ruth, coming over with the empty bottle;\nand I was pleased at her calling me \"John,\" and had a great mind to kiss\nher. However, I thought of my Lorna suddenly, and of the anger I should\nfeel if a man went on with her so; therefore I lay back in my chair, to\nwait for the other bottle.\n\n\"Do you remember how we danced that night?\" I asked, while she was\nopening it; \"and how you were afraid of me first, because I looked so\ntall, dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, and so very broad, Cousin Ridd. I thought that you would eat me.\nBut I have come to know, since then, how very kind and good you are.\"\n\n\"And will you come and dance again, at my wedding, Cousin Ruth?\"\n\nShe nearly let the bottle fall, the last of which she was sloping\ncarefully into a vessel of bright glass; and then she raised her hand\nagain, and finished it judiciously. And after that, she took the window,\nto see that all her work was clear; and then she poured me out a glass\nand said, with very pale cheeks, but else no sign of meaning about her,\n\"What did you ask me, Cousin Ridd?\"\n\n\"Nothing of any importance, Ruth; only we are so fond of you. I mean to\nbe married as soon as I can. Will you come and help us?\"\n\n\"To be sure I will, Cousin Ridd--unless, unless, dear grandfather cannot\nspare me from the business.\" She went away; and her breast was heaving,\nlike a rick of under-carried hay. And she stood at the window long,\ntrying to make yawns of sighs.\n\nFor my part, I knew not what to do. And yet I could think about it, as\nI never could with Lorna; with whom I was always in a whirl, from the\npower of my love. So I thought some time about it; and perceived that it\nwas the manliest way, just to tell her everything; except that I feared\nshe liked me. But it seemed to me unaccountable that she did not even\nask the name of my intended wife. Perhaps she thought that it must be\nSally; or perhaps she feared to trust her voice.\n\n\"Come and sit by me, dear Ruth; and listen to a long, long story, how\nthings have come about with me.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Cousin Ridd,\" she answered; \"at least I mean that I\nshall be happy--that I shall be ready to hear you--to listen to you, I\nmean of course. But I would rather stay where I am, and have the air--or\nrather be able to watch for dear grandfather coming home. He is so kind\nand good to me. What should I do without him?\"\n\nThen I told her how, for years and years, I had been attached to Lorna,\nand all the dangers and difficulties which had so long beset us, and\nhow I hoped that these were passing, and no other might come between\nus, except on the score of religion; upon which point I trusted soon\nto overcome my mother's objections. And then I told her how poor, and\nhelpless, and alone in the world, my Lorna was; and how sad all her\nyouth had been, until I brought her away at last. And many other little\nthings I mentioned, which there is no need for me again to dwell upon.\nRuth heard it all without a word, and without once looking at me; and\nonly by her attitude could I guess that she was weeping. Then when all\nmy tale was told, she asked in a low and gentle voice, but still without\nshowing her face to me,--\n\n\"And does she love you, Cousin Ridd? Does she say that she loves you\nwith--with all her heart?\"\n\n\"Certainly, she does,\" I answered. \"Do you think it impossible for one\nlike her to do so?\"\n\nShe said no more; but crossed the room before I had time to look at her,\nand came behind my chair, and kissed me gently on the forehead.\n\n\"I hope you may be very happy, with--I mean in your new life,\" she\nwhispered very softly; \"as happy as you deserve to be, and as happy as\nyou can make others be. Now how I have been neglecting you! I am quite\nashamed of myself for thinking only of grandfather: and it makes me so\nlow-spirited. You have told me a very nice romance, and I have never\neven helped you to a glass of wine. Here, pour it for yourself, dear\ncousin; I shall be back again directly.\"\n\nWith that she was out of the door in a moment; and when she came back,\nyou would not have thought that a tear had dimmed those large bright\neyes, or wandered down those pale clear cheeks. Only her hands were cold\nand trembling: and she made me help myself.\n\nUncle Reuben did not appear at all; and Ruth, who had promised to come\nand see us, and stay for a fortnight at our house (if her grandfather\ncould spare her), now discovered, before I left, that she must not think\nof doing so. Perhaps she was right in deciding thus; at any rate it had\nnow become improper for me to press her. And yet I now desired tenfold\nthat she should consent to come, thinking that Lorna herself would work\nthe speediest cure of her passing whim.\n\nFor such, I tried to persuade myself, was the nature of Ruth's regard\nfor me: and upon looking back I could not charge myself with any\nmisconduct towards the little maiden. I had never sought her company, I\nhad never trifled with her (at least until that very day), and being so\nengrossed with my own love, I had scarcely ever thought of her. And the\nmaiden would never have thought of me, except as a clumsy yokel, but for\nmy mother's and sister's meddling, and their wily suggestions. I believe\nthey had told the little soul that I was deeply in love with her;\nalthough they both stoutly denied it. But who can place trust in a\nwoman's word, when it comes to a question of match-making?\n\n[Illustration: 454.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nA VISIT FROM THE COUNSELLOR\n\n[Illustration: 455.jpg Counsellor]\n\nNow while I was riding home that evening, with a tender conscience\nabout Ruth, although not a wounded one, I guessed but little that all\nmy thoughts were needed much for my own affairs. So however it proved\nto be; for as I came in, soon after dark, my sister Eliza met me at\nthe corner of the cheese-room, and she said, \"Don't go in there, John,\"\npointing to mother's room; \"until I have had a talk with you.\"\n\n\"In the name of Moses,\" I inquired, having picked up that phrase at\nDulverton; \"what are you at about me now? There is no peace for a quiet\nfellow.\"\n\n\"It is nothing we are at,\" she answered; \"neither may you make light of\nit. It is something very important about Mistress Lorna Doone.\"\n\n\"Let us have it at once,\" I cried; \"I can bear anything about Lorna,\nexcept that she does not care for me.\"\n\n\"It has nothing to do with that, John. And I am quite sure that\nyou never need fear anything of that sort. She perfectly wearies me\nsometimes, although her voice is so soft and sweet, about your endless\nperfections.\"\n\n\"Bless her little heart!\" I said; \"the subject is inexhaustible.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied Lizzie, in the driest manner; \"especially to your\nsisters. However this is no time to joke. I fear you will get the worst\nof it, John. Do you know a man of about Gwenny's shape, nearly as broad\nas he is long, but about six times the size of Gwenny, and with a\nlength of snow-white hair, and a thickness also; as the copses were last\nwinter. He never can comb it, that is quite certain, with any comb yet\ninvented.\"\n\n\"Then you go and offer your services. There are few things you cannot\nscarify. I know the man from your description, although I have never\nseen him. Now where is my Lorna?\"\n\n\"Your Lorna is with Annie, having a good cry, I believe; and Annie too\nglad to second her. She knows that this great man is here, and knows\nthat he wants to see her. But she begged to defer the interview, until\ndear John's return.\"\n\n\"What a nasty way you have of telling the very commonest piece of news!\"\nI said, on purpose to pay her out. \"What man will ever fancy you, you\nunlucky little snapper? Now, no more nursery talk for me. I will go and\nsettle this business. You had better go and dress your dolls; if you can\ngive them clothes unpoisoned.\" Hereupon Lizzie burst into a perfect roar\nof tears; feeling that she had the worst of it. And I took her up, and\nbegged her pardon; although she scarcely deserved it; for she knew that\nI was out of luck, and she might have spared her satire.\n\nI was almost sure that the man who was come must be the Counsellor\nhimself; of whom I felt much keener fear than of his son Carver. And\nknowing that his visit boded ill to me and Lorna, I went and sought\nmy dear; and led her with a heavy heart, from the maiden's room to\nmother's, to meet our dreadful visitor.\n\nMother was standing by the door, making curtseys now and then, and\nlistening to a long harangue upon the rights of state and land, which\nthe Counsellor (having found that she was the owner of her property, and\nknew nothing of her title to it) was encouraged to deliver it. My dear\nmother stood gazing at him, spell-bound by his eloquence, and only\nhoping that he would stop. He was shaking his hair upon his shoulders,\nin the power of his words, and his wrath at some little thing, which he\ndeclared to be quite illegal.\n\nThen I ventured to show myself, in the flesh, before him; although he\nfeigned not to see me; but he advanced with zeal to Lorna; holding out\nboth hands at once.\n\n\"My darling child, my dearest niece; how wonderfully well you look!\nMistress Ridd, I give you credit. This is the country of good things. I\nnever would have believed our Queen could have looked so royal. Surely\nof all virtues, hospitality is the finest, and the most romantic.\nDearest Lorna, kiss your uncle; it is quite a privilege.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is to you, sir,\" said Lorna, who could never quite check her\nsense of oddity; \"but I fear that you have smoked tobacco, which spoils\nreciprocity.\"\n\n\"You are right, my child. How keen your scent is! It is always so with\nus. Your grandfather was noted for his olfactory powers. Ah, a great\nloss, dear Mrs. Ridd, a terrible loss to this neighbourhood! As one of\nour great writers says--I think it must be Milton--'We ne'er shall look\nupon his like again.'\"\n\n\"With your good leave sir,\" I broke in, \"Master Milton could never\nhave written so sweet and simple a line as that. It is one of the great\nShakespeare.\"\n\n\"Woe is me for my neglect!\" said the Counsellor, bowing airily; \"this\nmust be your son, Mistress Ridd, the great John, the wrestler. And one\nwho meddles with the Muses! Ah, since I was young, how everything is\nchanged, madam! Except indeed the beauty of women, which seems to me to\nincrease every year.\" Here the old villain bowed to my mother; and she\nblushed, and made another curtsey, and really did look very nice.\n\n\"Now though I have quoted the poets amiss, as your son informs me (for\nwhich I tender my best thanks, and must amend my reading), I can hardly\nbe wrong in assuming that this young armiger must be the too attractive\ncynosure to our poor little maiden. And for my part, she is welcome to\nhim. I have never been one of those who dwell upon distinctions of rank,\nand birth, and such like; as if they were in the heart of nature, and\nmust be eternal. In early youth, I may have thought so, and been full\nof that little pride. But now I have long accounted it one of the first\naxioms of political economy--you are following me, Mistress Ridd?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I am doing my best; but I cannot quite keep up with you.\"\n\n\"Never mind, madam; I will be slower. But your son's intelligence is so\nquick--\"\n\n\"I see, sir; you thought that mine must be. But no; it all comes from\nhis father, sir. His father was that quick and clever--\"\n\n\"Ah, I can well suppose it, madam. And a credit he is to both of you.\nNow, to return to our muttons--a figure which you will appreciate--I may\nnow be regarded, I think, as this young lady's legal guardian; although\nI have not had the honour of being formally appointed such. Her father\nwas the eldest son of Sir Ensor Doone; and I happened to be the second\nson; and as young maidens cannot be baronets, I suppose I am 'Sir\nCounsellor.' Is it so, Mistress Ridd, according to your theory of\ngenealogy?\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know, sir,\" my mother answered carefully; \"I know not\nanything of that name, sir, except in the Gospel of Matthew: but I see\nnot why it should be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Good, madam! I may look upon that as your sanction and approval: and\nthe College of Heralds shall hear of it. And in return, as Lorna's\nguardian, I give my full and ready consent to her marriage with your\nson, madam.\"\n\n\"Oh, how good of you, sir, how kind! Well, I always did say, that the\nlearnedest people were, almost always, the best and kindest, and the\nmost simple-hearted.\"\n\n\"Madam, that is a great sentiment. What a goodly couple they will be!\nand if we can add him to our strength--\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, oh no!\" cried mother: \"you really must not think of it. He\nhas always been brought up so honest--\"\n\n\"Hem! that makes a difference. A decided disqualification for domestic\nlife among the Doones. But, surely, he might get over those prejudices,\nmadam?\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir! he never can: he never can indeed. When he was only that\nhigh, sir, he could not steal even an apple, when some wicked boys tried\nto mislead him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied the Counsellor, shaking his white head gravely; \"then I\ngreatly fear that his case is quite incurable. I have known such cases;\nviolent prejudice, bred entirely of education, and anti-economical\nto the last degree. And when it is so, it is desperate: no man, after\nimbibing ideas of that sort, can in any way be useful.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir, John is very useful. He can do as much work as three other\nmen; and you should see him load a sledd, sir.\"\n\n\"I was speaking, madam, of higher usefulness,--power of the brain and\nheart. The main thing for us upon earth is to take a large view of\nthings. But while we talk of the heart, what is my niece Lorna\ndoing, that she does not come and thank me, for my perhaps too prompt\nconcession to her youthful fancies? Ah, if I had wanted thanks, I should\nhave been more stubborn.\"\n\nLorna, being challenged thus, came up and looked at her uncle, with\nher noble eyes fixed full upon his, which beneath his white eyebrows\nglistened, like dormer windows piled with snow.\n\n\"For what am I to thank you, uncle?\"\n\n\"My dear niece, I have told you. For removing the heaviest obstacle,\nwhich to a mind so well regulated could possibly have existed, between\nyour dutiful self and the object of your affections.\"\n\n\"Well, uncle, I should be very grateful, if I thought that you did\nso from love of me; or if I did not know that you have something yet\nconcealed from me.\"\n\n\"And my consent,\" said the Counsellor, \"is the more meritorious, the\nmore liberal, frank, and candid, in the face of an existing fact, and a\nvery clearly established one; which might have appeared to weaker minds\nin the light of an impediment; but to my loftier view of matrimony seems\nquite a recommendation.\"\n\n\"What fact do you mean, sir? Is it one that I ought to know?\"\n\n\"In my opinion it is, good niece. It forms, to my mind, so fine a basis\nfor the invariable harmony of the matrimonial state. To be brief--as I\nalways endeavour to be, without becoming obscure--you two young people\n(ah, what a gift is youth! one can never be too thankful for it) you\nwill have the rare advantage of commencing married life, with a subject\nof common interest to discuss, whenever you weary of--well, say of one\nanother; if you can now, by any means, conceive such a possibility. And\nperfect justice meted out: mutual goodwill resulting, from the sense of\nreciprocity.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, sir. Why can you not say what you mean, at\nonce?\"\n\n\"My dear child, I prolong your suspense. Curiosity is the most powerful\nof all feminine instincts; and therefore the most delightful, when not\nprematurely satisfied. However, if you must have my strong realities,\nhere they are. Your father slew dear John's father, and dear John's\nfather slew yours.\"\n\nHaving said thus much, the Counsellor leaned back upon his chair, and\nshaded his calm white-bearded eyes from the rays of our tallow candles.\nHe was a man who liked to look, rather than to be looked at. But Lorna\ncame to me for aid; and I went up to Lorna and mother looked at both of\nus.\n\nThen feeling that I must speak first (as no one would begin it), I took\nmy darling round the waist, and led her up to the Counsellor; while she\ntried to bear it bravely; yet must lean on me, or did.\n\n\"Now, Sir Counsellor Doone,\" I said, with Lorna squeezing both my hands,\nI never yet knew how (considering that she was walking all the time, or\nsomething like it); \"you know right well, Sir Counsellor, that Sir Ensor\nDoone gave approval.\" I cannot tell what made me think of this: but so\nit came upon me.\n\n\"Approval to what, good rustic John? To the slaughter so reciprocal?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not to that; even if it ever happened; which I do not believe.\nBut to the love betwixt me and Lorna; which your story shall not break,\nwithout more evidence than your word. And even so, shall never break; if\nLorna thinks as I do.\"\n\nThe maiden gave me a little touch, as much as to say, \"You are right,\ndarling: give it to him, again, like that.\" However, I held my peace,\nwell knowing that too many words do mischief.\n\nThen mother looked at me with wonder, being herself too amazed to speak;\nand the Counsellor looked, with great wrath in his eyes, which he tried\nto keep from burning.\n\n\"How say you then, John Ridd,\" he cried, stretching out one hand, like\nElijah; \"is this a thing of the sort you love? Is this what you are used\nto?\"\n\n\"So please your worship,\" I answered; \"no kind of violence can surprise\nus, since first came Doones upon Exmoor. Up to that time none heard\nof harm; except of taking a purse, maybe, or cutting a strange sheep's\nthroat. And the poor folk who did this were hanged, with some benefit of\nclergy. But ever since the Doones came first, we are used to anything.\"\n\n\"Thou varlet,\" cried the Counsellor, with the colour of his eyes quite\nchanged with the sparkles of his fury; \"is this the way we are to deal\nwith such a low-bred clod as thou? To question the doings of our people,\nand to talk of clergy! What, dream you not that we could have clergy,\nand of the right sort, too, if only we cared to have them? Tush! Am I to\nspend my time arguing with a plough-tail Bob?\"\n\n\"If your worship will hearken to me,\" I answered very modestly, not\nwishing to speak harshly, with Lorna looking up at me; \"there are many\nthings that might be said without any kind of argument, which I would\nnever wish to try with one of your worship's learning. And in the first\nplace it seems to me that if our fathers hated one another bitterly, yet\nneither won the victory, only mutual discomfiture; surely that is but\na reason why we should be wiser than they, and make it up in this\ngeneration by goodwill and loving\"--\n\n\"Oh, John, you wiser than your father!\" mother broke upon me here; \"not\nbut what you might be as wise, when you come to be old enough.\"\n\n\"Young people of the present age,\" said the Counsellor severely, \"have\nno right feeling of any sort, upon the simplest matter. Lorna Doone,\nstand forth from contact with that heir of parricide; and state in your\nown mellifluous voice, whether you regard this slaughter as a pleasant\ntrifle.\"\n\n\"You know, without any words of mine,\" she answered very softly, yet not\nwithdrawing from my hand, \"that although I have been seasoned well to\nevery kind of outrage, among my gentle relatives, I have not yet so\npurely lost all sense of right and wrong as to receive what you have\nsaid, as lightly as you declared it. You think it a happy basis for our\nfuture concord. I do not quite think that, my uncle; neither do I quite\nbelieve that a word of it is true. In our happy valley, nine-tenths of\nwhat is said is false; and you were always wont to argue that true\nand false are but a blind turned upon a pivot. Without any failure of\nrespect for your character, good uncle, I decline politely to believe a\nword of what you have told me. And even if it were proved to me, all I\ncan say is this, if my John will have me, I am his for ever.\"\n\nThis long speech was too much for her; she had overrated her strength\nabout it, and the sustenance of irony. So at last she fell into my arms,\nwhich had long been waiting for her; and there she lay with no other\nsound, except a gurgling in her throat.\n\n\"You old villain,\" cried my mother, shaking her fist at the Counsellor,\nwhile I could do nothing else but hold, and bend across, my darling, and\nwhisper to deaf ears; \"What is the good of the quality; if this is\nall that comes of it? Out of the way! You know the words that make the\ndeadly mischief; but not the ways that heal them. Give me that bottle,\nif hands you have; what is the use of Counsellors?\"\n\nI saw that dear mother was carried away; and indeed I myself was\nsomething like it; with the pale face upon my bosom, and the heaving of\nthe heart, and the heat and cold all through me, as my darling breathed\nor lay. Meanwhile the Counsellor stood back, and seemed a little sorry;\nalthough of course it was not in his power to be at all ashamed of\nhimself.\n\n\"My sweet love, my darling child,\" our mother went on to Lorna, in a way\nthat I shall never forget, though I live to be a hundred; \"pretty pet,\nnot a word of it is true, upon that old liar's oath; and if every word\nwere true, poor chick, you should have our John all the more for it.\nYou and John were made by God and meant for one another, whatever falls\nbetween you. Little lamb, look up and speak: here is your own John and\nI; and the devil take the Counsellor.\"\n\nI was amazed at mother's words, being so unlike her; while I loved her\nall the more because she forgot herself so. In another moment in ran\nAnnie, ay and Lizzie also, knowing by some mystic sense (which I have\noften noticed, but never could explain) that something was astir,\nbelonging to the world of women, yet foreign to the eyes of men. And now\nthe Counsellor, being well-born, although such a heartless miscreant,\nbeckoned to me to come away; which I, being smothered with women, was\nonly too glad to do, as soon as my own love would let go of me.\n\n\"That is the worst of them,\" said the old man; when I had led him into\nour kitchen, with an apology at every step, and given him hot schnapps\nand water, and a cigarro of brave Tom Faggus: \"you never can say much,\nsir, in the way of reasoning (however gently meant and put) but what\nthese women will fly out. It is wiser to put a wild bird in a cage, and\nexpect him to sit and look at you, and chirp without a feather rumpled,\nthan it is to expect a woman to answer reason reasonably.\" Saying this,\nhe looked at his puff of smoke as if it contained more reason.\n\n\"I am sure I do not know, sir,\" I answered according to a phrase which\nhas always been my favourite, on account of its general truth: moreover,\nhe was now our guest, and had right to be treated accordingly: \"I am,\nas you see, not acquainted with the ways of women, except my mother and\nsisters.\"\n\n\"Except not even them, my son,\" said the Counsellor, now having finished\nhis glass, without much consultation about it; \"if you once understand\nyour mother and sisters--why you understand the lot of them.\"\n\nHe made a twist in his cloud of smoke, and dashed his finger through\nit, so that I could not follow his meaning, and in manners liked not to\npress him.\n\n\"Now of this business, John,\" he said, after getting to the bottom of\nthe second glass, and having a trifle or so to eat, and praising our\nchimney-corner; \"taking you on the whole, you know, you are wonderfully\ngood people; and instead of giving me up to the soldiers, as you might\nhave done, you are doing your best to make me drunk.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir,\" I answered; \"not at all, your worship. Let me mix\nyou another glass. We rarely have a great gentleman by the side of our\nembers and oven. I only beg your pardon, sir, that my sister Annie (who\nknows where to find all the good pans and the lard) could not wait upon\nyou this evening; and I fear they have done it with dripping instead,\nand in a pan with the bottom burned. But old Betty quite loses her head\nsometimes, by dint of over-scolding.\"\n\n\"My son,\" replied the Counsellor, standing across the front of the fire,\nto prove his strict sobriety: \"I meant to come down upon you to-night;\nbut you have turned the tables upon me. Not through any skill on your\npart, nor through any paltry weakness as to love (and all that stuff,\nwhich boys and girls spin tops at, or knock dolls' noses together), but\nthrough your simple way of taking me, as a man to be believed; combined\nwith the comfort of this place, and the choice tobacco and cordials. I\nhave not enjoyed an evening so much, God bless me if I know when!\"\n\n\"Your worship,\" said I, \"makes me more proud than I well know what to\ndo with. Of all the things that please and lead us into happy sleep\nat night, the first and chiefest is to think that we have pleased a\nvisitor.\"\n\n\"Then, John, thou hast deserved good sleep; for I am not pleased easily.\nBut although our family is not so high now as it hath been, I have\nenough of the gentleman left to be pleased when good people try me. My\nfather, Sir Ensor, was better than I in this great element of birth, and\nmy son Carver is far worse. _Aetas parentum_, what is it, my boy? I hear\nthat you have been at a grammar-school.\"\n\n\"So I have, your worship, and at a very good one; but I only got far\nenough to make more tail than head of Latin.\"\n\n\"Let that pass,\" said the Counsellor; \"John, thou art all the wiser.\"\nAnd the old man shook his hoary locks, as if Latin had been his ruin.\nI looked at him sadly, and wondered whether it might have so ruined me,\nbut for God's mercy in stopping it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nTHE WAY TO MAKE THE CREAM RISE\n\n[Illustration: 464.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThat night the reverend Counsellor, not being in such state of mind as\nought to go alone, kindly took our best old bedstead, carved in panels,\nwell enough, with the woman of Samaria. I set him up, both straight\nand heavy, so that he need but close both eyes, and keep his mouth just\nopen; and in the morning he was thankful for all that he could remember.\n\nI, for my part, scarcely knew whether he really had begun to feel\ngoodwill towards us, and to see that nothing else could be of any use\nto him; or whether he was merely acting, so as to deceive us. And it\nhad struck me, several times, that he had made a great deal more of the\nspirit he had taken than the quantity would warrant, with a man so wise\nand solid. Neither did I quite understand a little story which Lorna\ntold me, how that in the night awaking, she had heard, or seemed to\nhear, a sound of feeling in her room; as if there had been some\none groping carefully among the things within her drawers or\nwardrobe-closet. But the noise had ceased at once, she said, when she\nsat up in bed and listened; and knowing how many mice we had, she took\ncourage and fell asleep again.\n\nAfter breakfast, the Counsellor (who looked no whit the worse for\nschnapps, but even more grave and venerable) followed our Annie into the\ndairy, to see how we managed the clotted cream, of which he had eaten\na basinful. And thereupon they talked a little; and Annie thought him a\nfine old gentleman, and a very just one; for he had nobly condemned the\npeople who spoke against Tom Faggus.\n\n\"Your honour must plainly understand,\" said Annie, being now alone\nwith him, and spreading out her light quick hands over the pans, like\nbutterflies, \"that they are brought in here to cool, after being set in\nthe basin-holes, with the wood-ash under them, which I showed you in the\nback-kitchen. And they must have very little heat, not enough to simmer\neven; only just to make the bubbles rise, and the scum upon the top set\nthick; and after that, it clots as firm--oh, as firm as my two hands\nbe.\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard,\" asked the Counsellor, who enjoyed this talk with\nAnnie, \"that if you pass across the top, without breaking the surface, a\nstring of beads, or polished glass, or anything of that kind, the cream\nwill set three times as solid, and in thrice the quantity?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I have never heard that,\" said Annie, staring with all her\nsimple eyes; \"what a thing it is to read books, and grow learned! But\nit is very easy to try it: I will get my coral necklace; it will not be\nwitchcraft, will it, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" the old man replied; \"I will make the experiment\nmyself; and you may trust me not to be hurt, my dear. But coral will not\ndo, my child, neither will anything coloured. The beads must be of plain\ncommon glass; but the brighter they are the better.\"\n\n\"Then I know the very thing,\" cried Annie; \"as bright as bright can be,\nand without any colour in it, except in the sun or candle light. Dearest\nLorna has the very thing, a necklace of some old glass-beads, or I think\nthey called them jewels: she will be too glad to lend it to us. I will\ngo for it, in a moment.\"\n\n\"My dear, it cannot be half so bright as your own pretty eyes. But\nremember one thing, Annie, you must not say what it is for; or even that\nI am going to use it, or anything at all about it; else the charm will\nbe broken. Bring it here, without a word; if you know where she keeps\nit.\"\n\n\"To be sure I do,\" she answered; \"John used to keep it for her. But\nshe took it away from him last week, and she wore it when--I mean when\nsomebody was here; and he said it was very valuable, and spoke with\ngreat learning about it, and called it by some particular name, which I\nforget at this moment. But valuable or not, we cannot hurt it, can we,\nsir, by passing it over the cream-pan?\"\n\n\"Hurt it!\" cried the Counsellor: \"nay, we shall do it good, my dear.\nIt will help to raise the cream: and you may take my word for it, young\nmaiden, none can do good in this world, without in turn receiving it.\"\nPronouncing this great sentiment, he looked so grand and benevolent,\nthat Annie (as she said afterwards) could scarce forbear from kissing\nhim, yet feared to take the liberty. Therefore, she only ran away to\nfetch my Lorna's necklace.\n\nNow as luck would have it--whether good luck or otherwise, you must not\njudge too hastily,--my darling had taken it into her head, only a day or\ntwo before, that I was far too valuable to be trusted with her necklace.\nNow that she had some idea of its price and quality, she had begun to\nfear that some one, perhaps even Squire Faggus (in whom her faith was\nilliberal), might form designs against my health, to win the bauble from\nme. So, with many pretty coaxings, she had led me to give it up; which,\nexcept for her own sake, I was glad enough to do, misliking a charge of\nsuch importance.\n\nTherefore Annie found it sparkling in the little secret hole, near the\nhead of Lorna's bed, which she herself had recommended for its safer\ncustody; and without a word to any one she brought it down, and danced\nit in the air before the Counsellor, for him to admire its lustre.\n\n\"Oh, that old thing!\" said the gentleman, in a tone of some contempt; \"I\nremember that old thing well enough. However, for want of a better, no\ndoubt it will answer our purpose. Three times three, I pass it over.\nCrinkleum, crankum, grass and clover! What are you feared of, you silly\nchild?\"\n\n\"Good sir, it is perfect witchcraft! I am sure of that, because it\nrhymes. Oh, what would mother say to me? Shall I ever go to heaven\nagain? Oh, I see the cream already!\"\n\n\"To be sure you do; but you must not look, or the whole charm will be\nbroken, and the devil will fly away with the pan, and drown every cow\nyou have got in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, it is too horrible. How could you lead me to such a sin? Away\nwith thee, witch of Endor!\"\n\nFor the door began to creak, and a broom appeared suddenly in the\nopening, with our Betty, no doubt, behind it. But Annie, in the greatest\nterror, slammed the door, and bolted it, and then turned again to the\nCounsellor; yet looking at his face, had not the courage to reproach\nhim. For his eyes rolled like two blazing barrels, and his white shagged\nbrows were knit across them, and his forehead scowled in black furrows,\nso that Annie said that if she ever saw the devil, she saw him then, and\nno mistake. Whether the old man wished to scare her, or whether he was\ntrying not to laugh, is more than I can tell you.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, in a deep stern whisper; \"not a word of this to a living\nsoul; neither must you, nor any other enter this place for three hours\nat least. By that time the charm will have done its work: the pan will\nbe cream to the bottom; and you will bless me for a secret which will\nmake your fortune. Put the bauble under this pannikin; which none must\nlift for a day and a night. Have no fear, my simple wench; not a breath\nof harm shall come to you, if you obey my orders.\"\n\n\"Oh, that I will, sir, that I will: if you will only tell me what to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Go to your room, without so much as a single word to any one. Bolt\nyourself in, and for three hours now, read the Lord's Prayer backwards.\"\n\nPoor Annie was only too glad to escape, upon these conditions; and the\nCounsellor kissed her upon the forehead and told her not to make her\neyes red, because they were much too sweet and pretty. She dropped them\nat this, with a sob and a curtsey, and ran away to her bedroom; but as\nfor reading the Lord's Prayer backwards, that was much beyond her;\nand she had not done three words quite right, before the three hours\nexpired.\n\nMeanwhile the Counsellor was gone. He bade our mother adieu, with so\nmuch dignity of bearing, and such warmth of gratitude, and the high-bred\ncourtesy of the old school (now fast disappearing), that when he was\ngone, dear mother fell back on the chair which he had used last night,\nas if it would teach her the graces. And for more than an hour she made\nbelieve not to know what there was for dinner.\n\n\"Oh, the wickedness of the world! Oh, the lies that are told of\npeople--or rather I mean the falsehoods--because a man is better born,\nand has better manners! Why, Lorna, how is it that you never speak about\nyour charming uncle? Did you notice, Lizzie, how his silver hair was\nwaving upon his velvet collar, and how white his hands were, and every\nnail like an acorn; only pink like shell-fish, or at least like shells?\nAnd the way he bowed, and dropped his eyes, from his pure respect for\nme! And then, that he would not even speak, on account of his emotion;\nbut pressed my hand in silence! Oh, Lizzie, you have read me beautiful\nthings about Sir Gallyhead, and the rest; but nothing to equal Sir\nCounsellor.\"\n\n\"You had better marry him, madam,\" said I, coming in very sternly;\nthough I knew I ought not to say it: \"he can repay your adoration. He\nhas stolen a hundred thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"John,\" cried my mother, \"you are mad!\" And yet she turned as pale as\ndeath; for women are so quick at turning; and she inkled what it was.\n\n\"Of course I am, mother; mad about the marvels of Sir Galahad. He has\ngone off with my Lorna's necklace. Fifty farms like ours can never make\nit good to Lorna.\"\n\nHereupon ensued grim silence. Mother looked at Lizzie's face, for she\ncould not look at me; and Lizzie looked at me, to know: and as for me, I\ncould have stamped almost on the heart of any one. It was not the value\nof the necklace--I am not so low a hound as that--nor was it even the\ndamned folly shown by every one of us--it was the thought of Lorna's\nsorrow for her ancient plaything; and even more, my fury at the breach\nof hospitality.\n\nBut Lorna came up to me softly, as a woman should always come; and she\nlaid one hand upon my shoulder; and she only looked at me. She even\nseemed to fear to look, and dropped her eyes, and sighed at me. Without\na word, I knew by that, how I must have looked like Satan; and the evil\nspirit left my heart; when she had made me think of it.\n\n\"Darling John, did you want me to think that you cared for my money,\nmore than for me?\"\n\nI led her away from the rest of them, being desirous of explaining\nthings, when I saw the depth of her nature opened, like an everlasting\nwell, to me. But she would not let me say a word, or do anything by\nourselves, as it were: she said, \"Your duty is to your mother: this blow\nis on her, and not on me.\"\n\nI saw that she was right; though how she knew it is beyond me; and I\nasked her just to go in front, and bring my mother round a little. For I\nmust let my passion pass: it may drop its weapons quickly; but it cannot\ncome and go, before a man has time to think.\n\nThen Lorna went up to my mother, who was still in the chair of elegance;\nand she took her by both hands, and said,--\n\n\"Dearest mother, I shall fret so, if I see you fretting. And to fret\nwill kill me, mother. They have always told me so.\"\n\nPoor mother bent on Lorna's shoulder, without thought of attitude, and\nlaid her cheek on Lorna's breast, and sobbed till Lizzie was jealous,\nand came with two pocket-handkerchiefs. As for me, my heart was lighter\n(if they would only dry their eyes, and come round by dinnertime) than\nit had been since the day on which Tom Faggus discovered the value of\nthat blessed and cursed necklace. None could say that I wanted Lorna for\nher money now. And perhaps the Doones would let me have her; now that\nher property was gone.\n\nBut who shall tell of Annie's grief? The poor little thing would have\nstaked her life upon finding the trinket, in all its beauty, lying under\nthe pannikin. She proudly challenged me to lift it--which I had done,\nlong ere that, of course--if only I would take the risk of the spell for\nmy incredulity. I told her not to talk of spells, until she could spell\na word backwards; and then to look into the pan where the charmed cream\nshould be. She would not acknowledge that the cream was the same as all\nthe rest was: and indeed it was not quite the same, for the points of\npoor Lorna's diamonds had made a few star-rays across the rich firm\ncrust of yellow.\n\nBut when we raised the pannikin, and there was nothing under it, poor\nAnnie fell against the wall, which had been whitened lately; and her\nface put all the white to scorn. My love, who was as fond of her, as if\nshe had known her for fifty years, hereupon ran up and caught her, and\nabused all diamonds. I will dwell no more upon Annie's grief, because we\nfelt it all so much. But I could not help telling her, if she wanted a\nwitch, to seek good Mother Melldrum, a legitimate performer.\n\nThat same night Master Jeremy Stickles (of whose absence the Counsellor\nmust have known) came back, with all equipment ready for the grand\nattack. Now the Doones knew, quite as well as we did, that this attack\nwas threatening; and that but for the wonderful weather it would have\nbeen made long ago. Therefore we, or at least our people (for I was\ndoubtful about going), were sure to meet with a good resistance, and due\npreparation.\n\nIt was very strange to hear and see, and quite impossible to account\nfor, that now some hundreds of country people (who feared to whisper\nso much as a word against the Doones a year ago, and would sooner have\nthought of attacking a church, in service time, than Glen Doone) now\nsharpened their old cutlasses, and laid pitch-forks on the grindstone,\nand bragged at every village cross, as if each would kill ten Doones\nhimself, neither care to wipe his hands afterwards. And this fierce\nbravery, and tall contempt, had been growing ever since the news of the\nattack upon our premises had taken good people by surprise; at least as\nconcerned the issue.\n\nJeremy Stickles laughed heartily about Annie's new manner of charming\nthe cream; but he looked very grave at the loss of the jewels, so soon\nas he knew their value.\n\n\"My son,\" he exclaimed, \"this is very heavy. It will go ill with all of\nyou to make good this loss, as I fear that you will have to do.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried I, with my blood running cold. \"We make good the loss,\nMaster Stickles! Every farthing we have in the world, and the labour of\nour lives to boot, will never make good the tenth of it.\"\n\n\"It would cut me to the heart,\" he answered, laying his hand on mine,\n\"to hear of such a deadly blow to you and your good mother. And this\nfarm; how long, John, has it been in your family?\"\n\n\"For at least six hundred years,\" I said, with a foolish pride that was\nonly too like to end in groans; \"and some people say, by a Royal grant,\nin the time of the great King Alfred. At any rate, a Ridd was with him\nthroughout all his hiding-time. We have always held by the King and\ncrown: surely none will turn us out, unless we are guilty of treason?\"\n\n\"My son,\" replied Jeremy very gently, so that I could love him for\nit, \"not a word to your good mother of this unlucky matter. Keep it to\nyourself, my boy, and try to think but little of it. After all, I may be\nwrong: at any rate, least said best mended.\"\n\n\"But Jeremy, dear Jeremy, how can I bear to leave it so? Do you suppose\nthat I can sleep, and eat my food, and go about, and look at other\npeople, as if nothing at all had happened? And all the time have it on\nmy mind, that not an acre of all the land, nor even our old sheep-dog,\nbelongs to us, of right at all! It is more than I can do, Jeremy. Let me\ntalk, and know the worst of it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Master Stickles, seeing that both the doors were\nclosed; \"I thought that nothing could move you, John; or I never would\nhave told you. Likely enough I am quite wrong; and God send that I be\nso. But what I guessed at some time back seems more than a guess, now\nthat you have told me about these wondrous jewels. Now will you keep, as\nclose as death, every word I tell you?\"\n\n\"By the honour of a man, I will. Until you yourself release me.\"\n\n\"That is quite enough, John. From you I want no oath; which, according\nto my experience, tempts a man to lie the more, by making it more\nimportant. I know you now too well to swear you, though I have the\npower. Now, my lad, what I have to say will scare your mind in one way,\nand ease it in another. I think that you have been hard pressed--I can\nread you like a book, John--by something which that old villain said,\nbefore he stole the necklace. You have tried not to dwell upon it; you\nhave even tried to make light of it for the sake of the women: but on\nthe whole it has grieved you more than even this dastard robbery.\"\n\n\"It would have done so, Jeremy Stickles, if I could once have believed\nit. And even without much belief, it is so against our manners, that it\nmakes me miserable. Only think of loving Lorna, only think of kissing\nher; and then remembering that her father had destroyed the life of\nmine!\"\n\n\"Only think,\" said Master Stickles, imitating my very voice, \"of Lorna\nloving you, John, of Lorna kissing you, John; and all the while saying\nto herself, 'this man's father murdered mine.' Now look at it in Lorna's\nway as well as in your own way. How one-sided all men are!\"\n\n\"I may look at it in fifty ways, and yet no good will come of it.\nJeremy, I confess to you, that I tried to make the best of it; partly to\nbaffle the Counsellor, and partly because my darling needed my help, and\nbore it so, and behaved to me so nobly. But to you in secret, I am not\nashamed to say that a woman may look over this easier than a man may.\"\n\n\"Because her nature is larger, my son, when she truly loves; although\nher mind be smaller. Now, if I can ease you from this secret burden,\nwill you bear, with strength and courage, the other which I plant on\nyou?\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" said I.\n\n\"No man can do more,\" said he and so began his story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nJEREMY FINDS OUT SOMETHING\n\n[Illustration: 472.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\n\"You know, my son,\" said Jeremy Stickles, with a good pull at his pipe,\nbecause he was going to talk so much, and putting his legs well along\nthe settle; \"it has been my duty, for a wearier time than I care to\nthink of (and which would have been unbearable, except for your great\nkindness), to search this neighbourhood narrowly, and learn everything\nabout everybody. Now the neighbourhood itself is queer; and people\nhave different ways of thinking from what we are used to in London. For\ninstance now, among your folk, when any piece of news is told, or any\nman's conduct spoken of, the very first question that arises in your\nmind is this--'Was this action kind and good?' Long after that, you say\nto yourselves, 'does the law enjoin or forbid this thing?' Now here\nis your fundamental error: for among all truly civilised people the\nforemost of all questions is, 'how stands the law herein?' And if the\nlaw approve, no need for any further questioning. That this is so, you\nmay take my word: for I know the law pretty thoroughly.\n\n\"Very well; I need not say any more about that, for I have shown that\nyou are all quite wrong. I only speak of this savage tendency, because\nit explains so many things which have puzzled me among you, and most of\nall your kindness to men whom you never saw before; which is an utterly\nillegal thing. It also explains your toleration of these outlaw Doones\nso long. If your views of law had been correct, and law an element of\nyour lives, these robbers could never have been indulged for so many\nyears amongst you: but you must have abated the nuisance.\"\n\n\"Now, Stickles,\" I cried, \"this is too bad!\" he was delivering himself\nso grandly. \"Why you yourself have been amongst us, as the balance, and\nsceptre, and sword of law, for nigh upon a twelvemonth; and have you\nabated the nuisance, or even cared to do it, until they began to shoot\nat you?\"\n\n\"My son,\" he replied, \"your argument is quite beside the purpose, and\nonly tends to prove more clearly that which I have said of you. However,\nif you wish to hear my story, no more interruptions. I may not have a\nchance to tell you, perhaps for weeks, or I know not when, if once those\nyellows and reds arrive, and be blessed to them, the lubbers! Well,\nit may be six months ago, or it may be seven, at any rate a good while\nbefore that cursed frost began, the mere name of which sends a shiver\ndown every bone of my body, when I was riding one afternoon from\nDulverton to Watchett\"--\n\n\"Dulverton to Watchett!\" I cried. \"Now what does that remind me of? I am\nsure, I remember something--\"\n\n\"Remember this, John, if anything--that another word from thee, and thou\nhast no more of mine. Well, I was a little weary perhaps, having been\nplagued at Dulverton with the grossness of the people. For they would\ntell me nothing at all about their fellow-townsmen, your worthy Uncle\nHuckaback, except that he was a God-fearing man, and they only wished\nI was like him. I blessed myself for a stupid fool, in thinking to have\npumped them; for by this time I might have known that, through your\nWestern homeliness, every man in his own country is something more than\na prophet. And I felt, of course, that I had done more harm than good by\nquestioning; inasmuch as every soul in the place would run straightway\nand inform him that the King's man from the other side of the forest had\nbeen sifting out his ways and works.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I cried, for I could not help it; \"you begin to understand at\nlast, that we are not quite such a set of oafs, as you at first believed\nus.\"\n\n\"I was riding on from Dulverton,\" he resumed, with great severity, yet\nthreatening me no more, which checked me more than fifty threats: \"and\nit was late in the afternoon, and I was growing weary. The road (if road\nit could be called) turned suddenly down from the higher land to the\nvery brink of the sea; and rounding a little jut of cliff, I met the\nroar of the breakers. My horse was scared, and leaped aside; for a\nnortherly wind was piping, and driving hunks of foam across, as children\nscatter snow-balls. But he only sank to his fetlocks in the dry sand,\npiled with pop-weed: and I tried to make him face the waves; and then I\nlooked about me.\n\n\"Watchett town was not to be seen, on account of a little foreland, a\nmile or more upon my course, and standing to the right of me. There was\nroom enough below the cliffs (which are nothing there to yours, John),\nfor horse and man to get along, although the tide was running high with\na northerly gale to back it. But close at hand and in the corner, drawn\nabove the yellow sands and long eye-brows of rackweed, as snug a little\nhouse blinked on me as ever I saw, or wished to see.\n\n[Illustration: 474.jpg Snug little house blinked on me]\n\n\"You know that I am not luxurious, neither in any way given to the\ncommon lusts of the flesh, John. My father never allowed his hair to\ngrow a fourth part of an inch in length, and he was a thoroughly godly\nman; and I try to follow in his footsteps, whenever I think about it.\nNevertheless, I do assure you that my view of that little house and the\nway the lights were twinkling, so different from the cold and darkness\nof the rolling sea, moved the ancient Adam in me, if he could be found\nto move. I love not a house with too many windows: being out of house\nand doors some three-quarters of my time, when I get inside a house I\nlike to feel the difference. Air and light are good for people who have\nany lack of them; and if a man once talks about them, 'tis enough to\nprove his need of them. But, as you well know, John Ridd, the horse who\nhas been at work all day, with the sunshine in his eyes, sleeps better\nin dark stables, and needs no moon to help him.\n\n\"Seeing therefore that this same inn had four windows, and no more,\nI thought to myself how snug it was, and how beautiful I could sleep\nthere. And so I made the old horse draw hand, which he was only too glad\nto do, and we clomb above the spring-tide mark, and over a little piece\nof turf, and struck the door of the hostelry. Some one came and peeped\nat me through the lattice overhead, which was full of bulls' eyes; and\nthen the bolt was drawn back, and a woman met me very courteously. A\ndark and foreign-looking woman, very hot of blood, I doubt, but not\naltogether a bad one. And she waited for me to speak first, which an\nEnglishwoman would not have done.\n\n\"'Can I rest here for the night?' I asked, with a lift of my hat to her;\nfor she was no provincial dame, who would stare at me for the courtesy;\n'my horse is weary from the sloughs, and myself but little better:\nbeside that, we both are famished.'\n\n\"'Yes, sir, you can rest and welcome. But of food, I fear, there is but\nlittle, unless of the common order. Our fishers would have drawn the\nnets, but the waves were violent. However, we have--what you call it? I\nnever can remember, it is so hard to say--the flesh of the hog salted.'\n\n\"'Bacon!' said I; 'what can be better? And half dozen of eggs with it,\nand a quart of fresh-drawn ale. You make me rage with hunger, madam. Is\nit cruelty, or hospitality?'\n\n\"'Ah, good!' she replied, with a merry smile, full of southern sunshine:\n'you are not of the men round here; you can think, and you can laugh!'\n\n\"'And most of all, I can eat, good madam. In that way I shall astonish\nyou; even more than by my intellect.'\n\n\"She laughed aloud, and swung her shoulders, as your natives cannot do;\nand then she called a little maid to lead my horse to stable. However,\nI preferred to see that matter done myself, and told her to send the\nlittle maid for the frying-pan and the egg-box.\n\n\"Whether it were my natural wit and elegance of manner; or whether it\nwere my London freedom and knowledge of the world; or (which is perhaps\nthe most probable, because the least pleasing supposition) my ready and\npermanent appetite, and appreciation of garlic--I leave you to decide,\nJohn: but perhaps all three combined to recommend me to the graces of my\ncharming hostess. When I say 'charming,' I mean of course by manners\nand by intelligence, and most of all by cooking; for as regards external\ncharms (most fleeting and fallacious) hers had ceased to cause distress,\nfor I cannot say how many years. She said that it was the climate--for\neven upon that subject she requested my opinion--and I answered, 'if\nthere be a change, let madam blame the seasons.'\n\n\"However, not to dwell too much upon our little pleasantries (for I\nalways get on with these foreign women better than with your Molls and\nPegs), I became, not inquisitive, but reasonably desirous to know, by\nwhat strange hap or hazard, a clever and a handsome woman, as she must\nhave been some day, a woman moreover with great contempt for the rustic\nminds around her, could have settled here in this lonely inn, with\nonly the waves for company, and a boorish husband who slaved all day in\nturning a potter's wheel at Watchett. And what was the meaning of the\nemblem set above her doorway, a very unattractive cat sitting in a\nruined tree?\n\n\"However, I had not very long to strain my curiosity; for when she found\nout who I was, and how I held the King's commission, and might be called\nan officer, her desire to tell me all was more than equal to mine\nof hearing it. Many and many a day, she had longed for some one both\nskilful and trustworthy, most of all for some one bearing warrant from\na court of justice. But the magistrates of the neighbourhood would have\nnothing to say to her, declaring that she was a crack-brained woman, and\na wicked, and even a foreign one.\n\n\"With many grimaces she assured me that never by her own free-will would\nshe have lived so many years in that hateful country, where the sky for\nhalf the year was fog, and rain for nearly the other half. It was so\nthe very night when first her evil fortune brought her there; and so no\ndoubt it would be, long after it had killed her. But if I wished to know\nthe reason of her being there, she would tell me in few words, which I\nwill repeat as briefly.\n\n\"By birth she was an Italian, from the mountains of Apulia, who had\ngone to Rome to seek her fortunes, after being badly treated in some\nlove-affair. Her Christian name was Benita; as for her surname, that\ncould make no difference to any one. Being a quick and active girl,\nand resolved to work down her troubles, she found employment in a large\nhotel; and rising gradually, began to send money to her parents. And\nhere she might have thriven well, and married well under sunny skies,\nand been a happy woman, but that some black day sent thither a rich and\nnoble English family, eager to behold the Pope. It was not, however,\ntheir fervent longing for the Holy Father which had brought them to St.\nPeter's roof; but rather their own bad luck in making their home too\nhot to hold them. For although in the main good Catholics, and pleasant\nreceivers of anything, one of their number had given offence, by the\nfolly of trying to think for himself. Some bitter feud had been among\nthem, Benita knew not how it was; and the sister of the nobleman who\nhad died quite lately was married to the rival claimant, whom they all\ndetested. It was something about dividing land; Benita knew not what it\nwas.\n\n\"But this Benita did know, that they were all great people, and rich,\nand very liberal; so that when they offered to take her, to attend to\nthe children, and to speak the language for them, and to comfort the\nlady, she was only too glad to go, little foreseeing the end of it.\nMoreover, she loved the children so, from their pretty ways and that,\nand the things they gave her, and the style of their dresses, that it\nwould have broken her heart almost never to see the dears again.\n\n\"And so, in a very evil hour, she accepted the service of the noble\nEnglishman, and sent her father an old shoe filled to the tongue with\nmoney, and trusted herself to fortune. But even before she went, she\nknew that it could not turn out well; for the laurel leaf which she\nthrew on the fire would not crackle even once, and the horn of the goat\ncame wrong in the twist, and the heel of her foot was shining. This made\nher sigh at the starting-time; and after that what could you hope for?\n\n\"However, at first all things went well. My Lord was as gay as gay could\nbe: and never would come inside the carriage, when a decent horse could\nbe got to ride. He would gallop in front, at a reckless pace, without a\nweapon of any kind, delighted with the pure blue air, and throwing his\nheart around him. Benita had never seen any man so admirable, and so\nchildish. As innocent as an infant; and not only contented, but noisily\nhappy with anything. Only other people must share his joy; and the\nshadow of sorrow scattered it, though it were but the shade of poverty.\n\n\"Here Benita wept a little; and I liked her none the less, and believed\nher ten times more; in virtue of a tear or two.\n\n\"And so they travelled through Northern Italy, and throughout the south\nof France, making their way anyhow; sometimes in coaches, sometimes in\ncarts, sometimes upon mule-back, sometimes even a-foot and weary; but\nalways as happy as could be. The children laughed, and grew, and throve\n(especially the young lady, the elder of the two), and Benita began\nto think that omens must not be relied upon. But suddenly her faith in\nomens was confirmed for ever.\n\n\"My Lord, who was quite a young man still, and laughed at English\narrogance, rode on in front of his wife and friends, to catch the first\nof a famous view, on the French side of the Pyrenee hills. He kissed his\nhand to his wife, and said that he would save her the trouble of coming.\nFor those two were so one in one, that they could make each other know\nwhatever he or she had felt. And so my Lord went round the corner, with\na fine young horse leaping up at the steps.\n\n\"They waited for him, long and long; but he never came again; and within\na week, his mangled body lay in a little chapel-yard; and if the priests\nonly said a quarter of the prayers they took the money for, God knows\nthey can have no throats left; only a relaxation.\n\n\"My lady dwelled for six months more--it is a melancholy tale (what true\ntale is not so?)--scarcely able to believe that all her fright was not a\ndream. She would not wear a piece or shape of any mourning-clothes;\nshe would not have a person cry, or any sorrow among us. She simply\ndisbelieved the thing, and trusted God to right it. The Protestants, who\nhave no faith, cannot understand this feeling. Enough that so it was;\nand so my Lady went to heaven.\n\n\"For when the snow came down in autumn on the roots of the Pyrenees, and\nthe chapel-yard was white with it, many people told the lady that it was\ntime for her to go. And the strongest plea of all was this, that now she\nbore another hope of repeating her husband's virtues. So at the end of\nOctober, when wolves came down to the farm-lands, the little English\nfamily went home towards their England.\n\n\"They landed somewhere on the Devonshire coast, ten or eleven years\nagone, and stayed some days at Exeter; and set out thence in a hired\ncoach, without any proper attendance, for Watchett, in the north of\nSomerset. For the lady owned a quiet mansion in the neighbourhood of\nthat town, and her one desire was to find refuge there, and to meet her\nlord, who was sure to come (she said) when he heard of his new infant.\nTherefore with only two serving-men and two maids (including Benita),\nthe party set forth from Exeter, and lay the first night at Bampton.\n\n\"On the following morn they started bravely, with earnest hope of\narriving at their journey's end by daylight. But the roads were soft and\nvery deep, and the sloughs were out in places; and the heavy coach broke\ndown in the axle, and needed mending at Dulverton; and so they lost\nthree hours or more, and would have been wiser to sleep there. But her\nladyship would not hear of it; she must be home that night, she said,\nand her husband would be waiting. How could she keep him waiting now,\nafter such a long, long time?\n\n\"Therefore, although it was afternoon, and the year now come to\nDecember, the horses were put to again, and the heavy coach went up the\nhill, with the lady and her two children, and Benita, sitting inside\nof it; the other maid, and two serving-men (each man with a great\nblunderbuss) mounted upon the outside; and upon the horses three Exeter\npostilions. Much had been said at Dulverton, and even back at Bampton,\nabout some great freebooters, to whom all Exmoor owed suit and service,\nand paid them very punctually. Both the serving-men were scared, even\nover their ale, by this. But the lady only said, 'Drive on; I know a\nlittle of highwaymen: they never rob a lady.'\"\n\n\"Through the fog and through the muck the coach went on, as best\nit might; sometimes foundered in a slough, with half of the horses\nsplashing it, and some-times knuckled up on a bank, and straining across\nthe middle, while all the horses kicked at it. However, they went on\ntill dark as well as might be expected. But when they came, all thanking\nGod, to the pitch and slope of the sea-bank, leading on towards Watchett\ntown, and where my horse had shied so, there the little boy jumped up,\nand clapped his hands at the water; and there (as Benita said) they met\ntheir fate, and could not fly it.\n\n\"Although it was past the dusk of day, the silver light from the sea\nflowed in, and showed the cliffs, and the gray sand-line, and the drifts\nof wreck, and wrack-weed. It showed them also a troop of horsemen,\nwaiting under a rock hard by, and ready to dash upon them. The\npostilions lashed towards the sea, and the horses strove in the depth of\nsand, and the serving-men cocked their blunder-busses, and cowered away\nbehind them; but the lady stood up in the carriage bravely, and neither\nscreamed nor spoke, but hid her son behind her. Meanwhile the drivers\ndrove into the sea, till the leading horses were swimming.\n\n\"But before the waves came into the coach, a score of fierce men were\nround it. They cursed the postilions for mad cowards, and cut the\ntraces, and seized the wheel-horses, all-wild with dismay in the wet and\nthe dark. Then, while the carriage was heeling over, and well-nigh upset\nin the water, the lady exclaimed, 'I know that man! He is our ancient\nenemy;' and Benita (foreseeing that all their boxes would be turned\ninside out, or carried away), snatched the most valuable of the jewels,\na magnificent necklace of diamonds, and cast it over the little girl's\nhead, and buried it under her travelling-cloak, hoping to save it. Then\na great wave, crested with foam, rolled in, and the coach was thrown\non its side, and the sea rushed in at the top and the windows, upon\nshrieking, and clashing, and fainting away.\n\n\"What followed Benita knew not, as one might well suppose, herself being\nstunned by a blow on the head, beside being palsied with terror. 'See,\nI have the mark now,' she said, 'where the jamb of the door came down on\nme!' But when she recovered her senses, she found herself lying upon\nthe sand, the robbers were out of sight, and one of the serving-men was\nbathing her forehead with sea water. For this she rated him well, having\ntaken already too much of that article; and then she arose and ran to\nher mistress, who was sitting upright on a little rock, with her dead\nboy's face to her bosom, sometimes gazing upon him, and sometimes\nquesting round for the other one.\n\n\"Although there were torches and links around, and she looked at her\nchild by the light of them, no one dared to approach the lady, or speak,\nor try to help her. Each man whispered his fellow to go, but each hung\nback himself, and muttered that it was too awful to meddle with. And\nthere she would have sat all night, with the fine little fellow stone\ndead in her arms, and her tearless eyes dwelling upon him, and her heart\nbut not her mind thinking, only that the Italian women stole up softly\nto her side, and whispered, 'It is the will of God.'\n\n\"'So it always seems to be,' were all the words the mother answered;\nand then she fell on Benita's neck; and the men were ashamed to be near\nher weeping; and a sailor lay down and bellowed. Surely these men are\nthe best.\n\n\"Before the light of the morning came along the tide to Watchett my Lady\nhad met her husband. They took her into the town that night, but not\nto her own castle; and so the power of womanhood (which is itself\nmaternity) came over swiftly upon her. The lady, whom all people\nloved (though at certain times particular), lies in Watchett little\nchurchyard, with son and heir at her right hand, and a little babe, of\nsex unknown, sleeping on her bosom.\n\n\"This is a miserable tale,\" said Jeremy Stickles brightly; \"hand me\nover the schnapps, my boy. What fools we are to spoil our eyes for other\npeople's troubles! Enough of our own to keep them clean, although we\nall were chimney-sweeps. There is nothing like good hollands, when a\nman becomes too sensitive. Restore the action of the glands; that is\nmy rule, after weeping. Let me make you another, John. You are quite\nlow-spirited.\"\n\nBut although Master Jeremy carried on so (as became his manhood), and\nlaughed at the sailor's bellowing; bless his heart, I knew as well that\ntears were in his brave keen eyes, as if I had dared to look for them,\nor to show mine own.\n\n\"And what was the lady's name?\" I asked; \"and what became of the little\ngirl? And why did the woman stay there?\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Jeremy Stickles, only too glad to be cheerful again: \"talk\nof a woman after that! As we used to say at school--Who dragged whom,\nhow many times, in what manner, round the wall of what?\" But to begin,\nlast first, my John (as becomes a woman): Benita stayed in that blessed\nplace, because she could not get away from it. The Doones--if Doones\nindeed they were, about which you of course know best--took every stiver\nout of the carriage: wet or dry they took it. And Benita could never get\nher wages: for the whole affair is in Chancery, and they have appointed\na receiver.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" said I, knowing something of London, and sorry for Benita's\nchance.\n\n\"So the poor thing was compelled to drop all thought of Apulia, and\nsettle down on the brink of Exmoor, where you get all its evils, without\nthe good to balance them. She married a man who turned a wheel for\nmaking the blue Watchett ware, partly because he could give her a house,\nand partly because he proved himself a good soul towards my Lady. There\nthey are, and have three children; and there you may go and visit them.\"\n\n\"I understand all that, Jeremy, though you do tell things too quickly,\nand I would rather have John Fry's style; for he leaves one time for\nhis words to melt. Now for my second question. What became of the little\nmaid?\"\n\n\"You great oaf!\" cried Jeremy Stickles: \"you are rather more likely to\nknow, I should think, than any one else in all the kingdoms.\"\n\n\"If I knew, I should not ask you. Jeremy Stickles, do try to be neither\nconceited nor thick-headed.\"\n\n\"I will when you are neither,\" answered Master Jeremy; \"but you occupy\nall the room, John. No one else can get in with you there.\"\n\n\"Very well then, let me out. Take me down in both ways.\"\n\n\"If ever you were taken down; you must have your double joints ready\nnow. And yet in other ways you will be as proud and set up as Lucifer.\nAs certain sure as I stand here, that little maid is Lorna Doone.\"\n\n[Illustration: 482.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nMUTUAL DISCOMFITURE\n\n[Illustration: 483.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nIt must not be supposed that I was altogether so thick-headed as Jeremy\nwould have made me out. But it is part of my character that I like other\npeople to think me slow, and to labour hard to enlighten me, while all\nthe time I can say to myself, \"This man is shallower than I am; it is\npleasant to see his shoals come up while he is sounding mine so!\" Not\nthat I would so behave, God forbid, with anybody (be it man or woman)\nwho in simple heart approached me, with no gauge of intellect. But when\nthe upper hand is taken, upon the faith of one's patience, by a man of\neven smaller wits (not that Jeremy was that, neither could he have lived\nto be thought so), why, it naturally happens, that we knuckle under,\nwith an ounce of indignation.\n\nJeremy's tale would have moved me greatly both with sorrow and anger,\neven without my guess at first, and now my firm belief, that the child\nof those unlucky parents was indeed my Lorna. And as I thought of the\nlady's troubles, and her faith in Providence, and her cruel, childless\ndeath, and then imagined how my darling would be overcome to hear it,\nyou may well believe that my quick replies to Jeremy Stickles's banter\nwere but as the flourish of a drum to cover the sounds of pain.\n\nFor when he described the heavy coach and the persons in and upon it,\nand the breaking down at Dulverton, and the place of their destination,\nas well as the time and the weather, and the season of the year, my\nheart began to burn within me, and my mind replaced the pictures, first\nof the foreign lady's-maid by the pump caressing me, and then of the\ncoach struggling up the hill, and the beautiful dame, and the fine\nlittle boy, with the white cockade in his hat; but most of all the\nlittle girl, dark-haired and very lovely, and having even in those days\nthe rich soft look of Lorna.\n\nBut when he spoke of the necklace thrown over the head of the little\nmaiden, and of her disappearance, before my eyes arose at once the\nflashing of the beacon-fire, the lonely moors embrowned with the light,\nthe tramp of the outlaw cavalcade, and the helpless child head-downward,\nlying across the robber's saddle-bow.\n\nThen I remembered my own mad shout of boyish indignation, and marvelled\nat the strange long way by which the events of life come round. And\nwhile I thought of my own return, and childish attempt to hide myself\nfrom sorrow in the sawpit, and the agony of my mother's tears, it did\nnot fail to strike me as a thing of omen, that the selfsame day should\nbe, both to my darling and myself, the blackest and most miserable of\nall youthful days.\n\nThe King's Commissioner thought it wise, for some good reason of his\nown, to conceal from me, for the present, the name of the poor lady\nsupposed to be Lorna's mother; and knowing that I could easily now\ndiscover it, without him, I let that question abide awhile. Indeed I was\nhalf afraid to hear it, remembering that the nobler and the wealthier\nshe proved to be, the smaller was my chance of winning such a wife for\nplain John Ridd. Not that she would give me up: that I never dreamed of.\nBut that others would interfere; or indeed I myself might find it only\nhonest to relinquish her. That last thought was a dreadful blow, and\ntook my breath away from me.\n\nJeremy Stickles was quite decided--and of course the discovery being\nhis, he had a right to be so--that not a word of all these things must\nbe imparted to Lorna herself, or even to my mother, or any one\nwhatever. \"Keep it tight as wax, my lad,\" he cried, with a wink of\ngreat expression; \"this belongs to me, mind; and the credit, ay, and the\npremium, and the right of discount, are altogether mine. It would have\ntaken you fifty years to put two and two together so, as I did, like a\nclap of thunder. Ah, God has given some men brains; and others have good\nfarms and money, and a certain skill in the lower beasts. Each must use\nhis special talent. You work your farm: I work my brains. In the end, my\nlad, I shall beat you.\"\n\n\"Then, Jeremy, what a fool you must be, if you cudgel your brains to\nmake money of this, to open the barn-door to me, and show me all your\nthreshing.\"\n\n\"Not a whit, my son. Quite the opposite. Two men always thresh better\nthan one. And here I have you bound to use your flail, one two, with\nmine, and yet in strictest honour bound not to bushel up, till I tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, being much amused by a Londoner's brave, yet uncertain,\nuse of simplest rural metaphors, for he had wholly forgotten the\nwinnowing: \"surely if I bushel up, even when you tell me, I must take\nhalf-measure.\"\n\n\"So you shall, my boy,\" he answered, \"if we can only cheat those\nconfounded knaves of Equity. You shall take the beauty, my son, and\nthe elegance, and the love, and all that--and, my boy, I will take the\nmoney.\"\n\nThis he said in a way so dry, and yet so richly unctuous, that being\ngifted somehow by God, with a kind of sense of queerness, I fell back in\nmy chair, and laughed, though the underside of my laugh was tears.\n\n\"Now, Jeremy, how if I refuse to keep this half as tight as wax. You\nbound me to no such partnership, before you told the story; and I am not\nsure, by any means, of your right to do so afterwards.\"\n\n\"Tush!\" he replied: \"I know you too well, to look for meanness in you.\nIf from pure goodwill, John Ridd, and anxiety to relieve you, I made no\ncondition precedent, you are not the man to take advantage, as a lawyer\nmight. I do not even want your promise. As sure as I hold this glass,\nand drink your health and love in another drop (forced on me by pathetic\nwords), so surely will you be bound to me, until I do release you. Tush!\nI know men well by this time: a mere look of trust from one is worth\nanother's ten thousand oaths.\"\n\n\"Jeremy, you are right,\" I answered; \"at least as regards the issue.\nAlthough perhaps you were not right in leading me into a bargain like\nthis, without my own consent or knowledge. But supposing that we should\nboth be shot in this grand attack on the valley (for I mean to go\nwith you now, heart and soul), is Lorna to remain untold of that which\nchanges all her life?\"\n\n\"Both shot!\" cried Jeremy Stickles: \"my goodness, boy, talk not like\nthat! And those Doones are cursed good shots too. Nay, nay, the yellows\nshall go in front; we attack on the Somerset side, I think. I from a\nhill will reconnoitre, as behoves a general, you shall stick behind a\ntree, if we can only find one big enough to hide you. You and I to be\nshot, John Ridd, with all this inferior food for powder anxious to be\ndevoured?\"\n\nI laughed, for I knew his cool hardihood, and never-flinching courage;\nand sooth to say no coward would have dared to talk like that.\n\n\"But when one comes to think of it,\" he continued, smiling at himself;\n\"some provision should be made for even that unpleasant chance. I will\nleave the whole in writing, with orders to be opened, etc., etc.--Now no\nmore of that, my boy; a cigarro after schnapps, and go to meet my yellow\nboys.\"\n\nHis \"yellow boys,\" as he called the Somersetshire trained bands, were\neven now coming down the valley from the London Road, as every one since\nI went up to town, grandly entitled the lane to the moors. There was one\ngood point about these men, that having no discipline at all, they made\npretence to none whatever. Nay, rather they ridiculed the thing, as\nbelow men of any spirit. On the other hand, Master Stickles's troopers\nlooked down on these native fellows from a height which I hope they may\nnever tumble, for it would break the necks of all of them.\n\nNow these fine natives came along, singing, for their very lives, a song\nthe like of which set down here would oust my book from modest\npeople, and make everybody say, \"this man never can have loved Lorna.\"\nTherefore, the less of that the better; only I thought, \"what a\ndifference from the goodly psalms of the ale house!\"\n\nHaving finished their canticle, which contained more mirth than melody,\nthey drew themselves up, in a sort of way supposed by them to be\nmilitary, each man with heel and elbow struck into those of his\nneighbour, and saluted the King's Commissioner. \"Why, where are your\nofficers?\" asked Master Stickles; \"how is it that you have no officers?\"\nUpon this there arose a general grin, and a knowing look passed along\ntheir faces, even up to the man by the gatepost. \"Are you going to tell\nme, or not,\" said Jeremy, \"what is become of your officers?\"\n\n\"Plaise zur,\" said one little fellow at last, being nodded at by the\nrest to speak, in right of his known eloquence; \"hus tould Harfizers, as\na wor no nade of un, now King's man hiszell wor coom, a puppose vor to\ncommand us laike.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say, you villains,\" cried Jeremy, scarce knowing\nwhether to laugh, or to swear, or what to do; \"that your officers took\ntheir dismissal thus, and let you come on without them?\"\n\n\"What could 'em do?\" asked the little man, with reason certainly on his\nside: \"hus zent 'em about their business, and they was glad enough to\ngoo.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said poor Jeremy, turning to me; \"a pretty state of things,\nJohn! Threescore cobblers, and farming men, plasterers, tailors, and\nkettles-to-mend; and not a man to keep order among them, except my\nblessed self, John! And I trow there is not one among them could hit all\nin-door flying. The Doones will make riddles of all of us.\"\n\nHowever, he had better hopes when the sons of Devon appeared, as\nthey did in about an hour's time; fine fellows, and eager to prove\nthemselves. These had not discarded their officers, but marched in good\nobedience to them, and were quite prepared to fight the men of Somerset\n(if need be) in addition to the Doones. And there was scarcely a man\namong them but could have trounced three of the yellow men, and would\nhave done it gladly too, in honour of the red facings.\n\n\"Do you mean to suppose, Master Jeremy Stickles,\" said I, looking on\nwith amazement, beholding also all our maidens at the upstair windows\nwondering; \"that we, my mother a widow woman, and I a young man of small\nestate, can keep and support all these precious fellows, both yellow\nones, and red ones, until they have taken the Doone Glen?\"\n\n\"God forbid it, my son!\" he replied, laying a finger upon his lip:\n\"Nay, nay, I am not of the shabby order, when I have the strings of\ngovernment. Kill your sheep at famine prices, and knead your bread at\na figure expressing the rigours of last winter. Let Annie make out the\nbill every day, and I at night will double it. You may take my word for\nit, Master John, this spring-harvest shall bring you in three times\nas much as last autumn's did. If they cheated you in town, my lad, you\nshall have your change in the country. Take thy bill, and write down\nquickly.\"\n\nHowever this did not meet my views of what an honest man should do; and\nI went to consult my mother about it, as all the accounts would be made\nin her name.\n\nDear mother thought that if the King paid only half again as much as\nother people would have to pay, it would be perhaps the proper thing;\nthe half being due for loyalty: and here she quoted an ancient saying,--\n\n    \"The King and his staff.\n     Be a man and a half;\"\n\nwhich, according to her judgment, ruled beyond dispute the law of the\npresent question. To argue with her after that (which she brought up\nwith such triumph) would have been worse than useless. Therefore I just\ntold Annie to make the bills at a third below the current market prices;\nso that the upshot would be fair. She promised me honestly that she\nwould; but with a twinkle in her bright blue eyes, which she must have\ncaught from Tom Faggus. It always has appeared to me that stern and\ndownright honesty upon money matters is a thing not understood of women;\nbe they as good as good can be.\n\nThe yellows and the reds together numbered a hundred and twenty men,\nmost of whom slept in our barns and stacks; and besides these we had\nfifteen troopers of the regular army. You may suppose that all the\ncountry was turned upside down about it; and the folk who came to see\nthem drill--by no means a needless exercise--were a greater plague\nthan the soldiers. The officers too of the Devonshire hand were such a\ntorment to us, that we almost wished their men had dismissed them, as\nthe Somerset troop had done with theirs. For we could not keep them out\nof our house, being all young men of good family, and therefore not to\nbe met with bars. And having now three lovely maidens (for even Lizzie\nmight be called so, when she cared to please), mother and I were at\nwit's ends, on account of those blessed officers. I never got a wink of\nsleep; they came whistling under the window so; and directly I went out\nto chase them, there was nothing but a cat to see.\n\nTherefore all of us were right glad (except perhaps Farmer Snowe, from\nwhom we had bought some victuals at rare price), when Jeremy Stickles\ngave orders to march, and we began to try to do it. A good deal of\nboasting went overhead, as our men defiled along the lane; and the thick\nbroad patins of pennywort jutted out between the stones, ready to\nheal their bruises. The parish choir came part of the way, and the\nsinging-loft from Countisbury; and they kept our soldiers' spirits up\nwith some of the most pugnacious Psalms. Parson Bowden marched ahead,\nleading all our van and file, as against the Papists; and promising\nto go with us, till we came to bullet distance. Therefore we marched\nbravely on, and children came to look at us. And I wondered where Uncle\nReuben was, who ought to have led the culverins (whereof we had no less\nthan three), if Stickles could only have found him; and then I thought\nof little Ruth; and without any fault on my part, my heart went down\nwithin me.\n\nThe culverins were laid on bark; and all our horses pulling them, and\nlooking round every now and then, with their ears curved up like a\nsquirrel'd nut, and their noses tossing anxiously, to know what sort\nof plough it was man had been pleased to put behind them--man, whose\nendless whims and wildness they could never understand, any more than\nthey could satisfy. However, they pulled their very best--as all our\nhorses always do--and the culverins went up the hill, without smack\nof whip, or swearing. It had been arranged, very justly, no doubt, and\nquite in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution, but as it proved\nnot too wisely, that either body of men should act in its own county\nonly. So when we reached the top of the hill, the sons of Devon marched\non, and across the track leading into Doone-gate, so as to fetch round\nthe western side, and attack with their culverin from the cliffs, whence\nthe sentry had challenged me on the night of my passing the entrance.\nMeanwhile the yellow lads were to stay upon the eastern highland, whence\nUncle Reuben and myself had reconnoitred so long ago; and whence I had\nleaped into the valley at the time of the great snow-drifts. And here\nthey were not to show themselves; but keep their culverin in the woods,\nuntil their cousins of Devon appeared on the opposite parapet of the\nglen.\n\nThe third culverin was entrusted to the fifteen troopers; who, with ten\npicked soldiers from either trained hand, making in all five-and-thirty\nmen, were to assault the Doone-gate itself, while the outlaws were\nplaced between two fires from the eastern cliff and the western. And\nwith this force went Jeremy Stickles, and with it went myself, as\nknowing more about the passage than any other stranger did. Therefore,\nif I have put it clearly, as I strive to do, you will see that the\nDoones must repulse at once three simultaneous attacks, from an army\nnumbering in the whole one hundred and thirty-five men, not including\nthe Devonshire officers; fifty men on each side, I mean, and thirty-five\nat the head of the valley.\n\nThe tactics of this grand campaign appeared to me so clever, and\nbeautifully ordered, that I commended Colonel Stickles, as everybody\nnow called him, for his great ability and mastery of the art of war. He\nadmitted that he deserved high praise; but said that he was not by any\nmeans equally certain of success, so large a proportion of his forces\nbeing only a raw militia, brave enough no doubt for anything, when they\nsaw their way to it; but knowing little of gunnery, and wholly unused\nto be shot at. Whereas all the Doones were practised marksmen, being\ncompelled when lads (like the Balearic slingers) to strike down their\nmeals before tasting them. And then Colonel Stickles asked me, whether I\nmyself could stand fire; he knew that I was not a coward, but this was\na different question. I told him that I had been shot at, once or twice\nbefore; but nevertheless disliked it, as much as almost anything. Upon\nthat he said that I would do; for that when a man got over the first\nblush of diffidence, he soon began to look upon it as a puff of destiny.\n\nI wish I could only tell what happened, in the battle of that day,\nespecially as nearly all the people round these parts, who never saw\ngun-fire in it, have gotten the tale so much amiss; and some of them\nwill even stand in front of my own hearth, and contradict me to the\nteeth; although at the time they were not born, nor their fathers put\ninto breeches. But in truth, I cannot tell, exactly, even the part in\nwhich I helped, how then can I be expected, time by time, to lay before\nyou, all the little ins and outs of places, where I myself was not? Only\nI can contradict things, which I know could not have been; and what I\nplainly saw should not be controverted in my own house.\n\nNow we five-and-thirty men lay back a little way round the corner,\nin the hollow of the track which leads to the strong Doone-gate. Our\nculverin was in amongst us, loaded now to the muzzle, and it was not\ncomfortable to know that it might go off at any time. Although the\nyeomanry were not come (according to arrangement), some of us had horses\nthere; besides the horses who dragged the cannon, and now were sniffing\nat it. And there were plenty of spectators to mind these horses for us,\nas soon as we should charge; inasmuch as all our friends and neighbours,\nwho had so keenly prepared for the battle, now resolved to take no part,\nbut look on, and praise the winners.\n\nAt last we heard the loud bang-bang, which proved that Devon and\nSomerset were pouring their indignation hot into the den of malefactors,\nor at least so we supposed; therefore at double quick march we advanced\nround the bend of the cliff which had hidden us, hoping to find the gate\nundefended, and to blow down all barriers with the fire of our cannon.\nAnd indeed it seemed likely at first to be so, for the wild and\nmountainous gorge of rock appeared to be all in pure loneliness, except\nwhere the coloured coats of our soldiers, and their metal trappings,\nshone with the sun behind them. Therefore we shouted a loud hurrah, as\nfor an easy victory.\n\nBut while the sound of our cheer rang back among the crags above us, a\nshrill clear whistle cleft the air for a single moment, and then a dozen\ncarbines bellowed, and all among us flew murderous lead. Several of our\nmen rolled over, but the rest rushed on like Britons, Jeremy and myself\nin front, while we heard the horses plunging at the loaded gun behind\nus. \"Now, my lads,\" cried Jeremy, \"one dash, and we are beyond them!\"\nFor he saw that the foe was overhead in the gallery of brushwood.\n\nOur men with a brave shout answered him, for his courage was fine\nexample; and we leaped in under the feet of the foe, before they could\nload their guns again. But here, when the foremost among us were past,\nan awful crash rang behind us, with the shrieks of men, and the din of\nmetal, and the horrible screaming of horses. The trunk of the tree\nhad been launched overhead, and crashed into the very midst of us. Our\ncannon was under it, so were two men, and a horse with his poor back\nbroken. Another horse vainly struggled to rise, with his thigh-bone\nsmashed and protruding.\n\nNow I lost all presence of mind at this, for I loved both those good\nhorses, and shouting for any to follow me, dashed headlong into the\ncavern. Some five or six men came after me, the foremost of whom was\nJeremy, when a storm of shot whistled and patted around me, with a blaze\nof light and a thunderous roar. On I leaped, like a madman, and pounced\non one gunner, and hurled him across his culverin; but the others had\nfled, and a heavy oak door fell to with a bang, behind them. So utterly\nwere my senses gone, and naught but strength remaining, that I caught up\nthe cannon with both hands, and dashed it, breech-first, at the doorway.\nThe solid oak burst with the blow, and the gun stuck fast, like a\nbuilder's putlog.\n\nBut here I looked round in vain for any one to come and follow up my\nsuccess. The scanty light showed me no figure moving through the length\nof the tunnel behind me; only a heavy groan or two went to my heart, and\nchilled it. So I hurried back to seek Jeremy, fearing that he must be\nsmitten down.\n\nAnd so indeed I found him, as well as three other poor fellows, struck\nby the charge of the culverin, which had passed so close beside me. Two\nof the four were as dead as stones, and growing cold already, but Jeremy\nand the other could manage to groan, just now and then. So I turned my\nattention to them, and thought no more of fighting.\n\nHaving so many wounded men, and so many dead among us, we loitered at\nthe cavern's mouth, and looked at one another, wishing only for somebody\nto come and take command of us. But no one came; and I was griefed so\nmuch about poor Jeremy, besides being wholly unused to any violence of\nbloodshed, that I could only keep his head up, and try to stop him from\nbleeding. And he looked up at me pitifully, being perhaps in a haze of\nthought, as a calf looks at a butcher.\n\nThe shot had taken him in the mouth; about that no doubt could be, for\ntwo of his teeth were in his beard, and one of his lips was wanting. I\nlaid his shattered face on my breast, and nursed him, as a woman might.\nBut he looked at me with a jerk at this; and I saw that he wanted\ncoolness.\n\nWhile here we stayed, quite out of danger (for the fellows from the\ngallery could by no means shoot us, even if they remained there, and the\noaken door whence the others fled was blocked up by the culverin), a boy\nwho had no business there (being in fact our clerk's apprentice to the\nart of shoe-making) came round the corner upon us in the manner which\nboys, and only boys, can use with grace and freedom; that is to say,\nwith a sudden rush, and a sidelong step, and an impudence,--\n\n\"Got the worst of it!\" cried the boy; \"better be off all of you.\nZoomerzett and Devon a vighting; and the Doones have drashed 'em both.\nMaister Ridd, even thee be drashed.\"\n\nWe few, who yet remained of the force which was to have won the\nDoone-gate, gazed at one another, like so many fools, and nothing more.\nFor we still had some faint hopes of winning the day, and recovering our\nreputation, by means of what the other men might have done without us.\nAnd we could not understand at all how Devonshire and Somerset, being\nembarked in the same cause, should be fighting with one another.\n\nFinding nothing more to be done in the way of carrying on the war, we\nlaid poor Master Stickles and two more of the wounded upon the carriage\nof bark and hurdles, whereon our gun had lain; and we rolled the gun\ninto the river, and harnessed the horses yet alive, and put the others\nout of their pain, and sadly wended homewards, feeling ourselves to be\nthoroughly beaten, yet ready to maintain that it was no fault of ours\nwhatever. And in this opinion the women joined, being only too glad and\nthankful to see us home alive again.\n\nNow, this enterprise having failed so, I prefer not to dwell too long\nupon it; only just to show the mischief which lay at the root of the\nfailure. And this mischief was the vile jealousy betwixt red and yellow\nuniform. Now I try to speak impartially, belonging no more to Somerset\nthan I do to Devonshire, living upon the borders, and born of either\ncounty. The tale was told me by one side first; and then quite to a\ndifferent tune by the other; and then by both together, with very hot\nwords of reviling and a desire to fight it out again. And putting this\nwith that, the truth appears to be as follows:--\n\nThe men of Devon, who bore red facings, had a long way to go round the\nhills, before they could get into due position on the western side of\nthe Doone Glen. And knowing that their cousins in yellow would claim the\nwhole of the glory, if allowed to be first with the firing, these worthy\nfellows waited not to take good aim with their cannons, seeing the\nothers about to shoot; but fettled it anyhow on the slope, pointing in a\ngeneral direction; and trusting in God for aimworthiness, laid the rope\nto the breech, and fired. Now as Providence ordained it, the shot,\nwhich was a casual mixture of anything considered hard--for instance,\njug-bottoms and knobs of doors--the whole of this pernicious dose came\nscattering and shattering among the unfortunate yellow men upon the\nopposite cliff; killing one and wounding two.\n\nNow what did the men of Somerset do, but instead of waiting for their\nfriends to send round and beg pardon, train their gun full mouth upon\nthem, and with a vicious meaning shoot. Not only this, but they loudly\ncheered, when they saw four or five red coats lie low; for which savage\nfeeling not even the remarks of the Devonshire men concerning their\ncoats could entirely excuse them. Now I need not tell the rest of it,\nfor the tale makes a man discontented. Enough that both sides waxed\nhotter and hotter with the fire of destruction. And but that the gorge\nof the cliffs lay between, very few would have lived to tell of it; for\nour western blood becomes stiff and firm, when churned with the sense of\nwrong in it.\n\nAt last the Doones (who must have laughed at the thunder passing\noverhead) recalling their men from the gallery, issued out of Gwenny's\ngate (which had been wholly overlooked) and fell on the rear of\nthe Somerset men, and slew four beside their cannon. Then while the\nsurvivors ran away, the outlaws took the hot culverin, and rolled it\ndown into their valley. Thus, of the three guns set forth that morning,\nonly one ever came home again, and that was the gun of the Devonshire\nmen, who dragged it home themselves, with the view of making a boast\nabout it.\n\nThis was a melancholy end of our brave setting out, and everybody blamed\nevery one else; and several of us wanted to have the whole thing over\nagain, as then we must have righted it. But upon one point all agreed,\nby some reason not clear to me, that the root of the evil was to be\nfound in the way Parson Bowden went up the hill, with his hat on, and no\ncassock.\n\n[Illustration: 494.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nGETTING INTO CHANCERY\n\n[Illustration: 495.jpg Devonshire Town]\n\nTwo of the Devonshire officers (Captains Pyke and Dallan) now took\ncommand of the men who were left, and ordered all to go home again,\ncommending much the bravery which had been displayed on all sides, and\nthe loyalty to the King, and the English constitution. This last word\nalways seems to me to settle everything when said, because nobody\nunderstands it, and yet all can puzzle their neighbours. So the\nDevonshire men, having beans to sow (which they ought to have done on\nGood Friday) went home; and our Somerset friends only stayed for two\ndays more to backbite them.\n\nTo me the whole thing was purely grievous; not from any sense of defeat\n(though that was bad enough) but from the pain and anguish caused by\ndeath, and wounds, and mourning. \"Surely we have woes enough,\" I used to\nthink of an evening, when the poor fellows could not sleep or rest, or\nlet others rest around them; \"surely all this smell of wounds is not\nincense men should pay to the God who made them. Death, when it comes\nand is done with, may be a bliss to any one; but the doubt of life or\ndeath, when a man lies, as it were, like a trunk upon a sawpit and a\ngrisly head looks up at him, and the groans of pain are cleaving him,\nthis would be beyond all bearing--but for Nature's sap--sweet hope.\"\n\nJeremy Stickles lay and tossed, and thrust up his feet in agony, and\nbit with his lipless mouth the clothes, and was proud to see blood upon\nthem. He looked at us ever so many times, as much as to say, \"Fools, let\nme die, then I shall have some comfort\"; but we nodded at him sagely,\nespecially the women, trying to convey to him, on no account to die yet.\nAnd then we talked to one another (on purpose for him to hear us), how\nbrave he was, and not the man to knock under in a hurry, and how he\nshould have the victory yet; and how well he looked, considering.\n\nThese things cheered him a little now, and a little more next time; and\nevery time we went on so, he took it with less impatience. Then once\nwhen he had been very quiet, and not even tried to frown at us, Annie\nleaned over, and kissed his forehead, and spread the pillows and sheet,\nwith a curve as delicate as his own white ears; and then he feebly\nlifted hands, and prayed to God to bless her. And after that he came\nround gently; though never to the man he had been, and never to speak\nloud again.\n\nFor a time (as I may have implied before) Master Stickles's authority,\nand manner of levying duties, had not been taken kindly by the people\nround our neighbourhood. The manors of East Lynn and West Lynn, and even\nthat of Woolhanger--although just then all three were at issue about\nsome rights of wreck, and the hanging of a sheep-stealer (a man of no\ngreat eminence, yet claimed by each for the sake of his clothes)--these\nthree, having their rights impugned, or even superseded, as they\ndeclared by the quartering of soldiers in their neighbourhood, united\nvery kindly to oppose the King's Commissioner. However, Jeremy had\ncontrived to conciliate the whole of them, not so much by anything\nengaging in his deportment or delicate address, as by holding out bright\nhopes that the plunder of the Doone Glen might become divisible among\nthe adjoining manors. Now I have never discovered a thing which the\nlords of manors (at least in our part of the world) do not believe to\nbelong to themselves, if only they could get their rights. And it\ndid seem natural enough that if the Doones were ousted, and a nice\ncollection of prey remained, this should be parted among the people\nhaving ancient rights of plunder. Nevertheless, Master Jeremy knew that\nthe soldiers would have the first of it, and the King what they could\nnot carry.\n\nAnd perhaps he was punished justly for language so misleading, by the\ngeneral indignation of the people all around us, not at his failure, but\nat himself, for that which he could in no wise prevent. And the stewards\nof the manors rode up to our house on purpose to reproach him, and were\ngreatly vexed with all of us, because he was too ill to see them.\n\nTo myself (though by rights the last to be thought of, among so much\npain and trouble) Jeremy's wound was a great misfortune, in more ways\nthan one. In the first place, it deferred my chance of imparting either\nto my mother or to Mistress Lorna my firm belief that the maid I loved\nwas not sprung from the race which had slain my father; neither could\nhe in any way have offended against her family. And this discovery I was\nyearning more and more to declare to them; being forced to see (even\nin the midst of all our warlike troubles) that a certain difference was\ngrowing betwixt them both, and betwixt them and me. For although the\nwords of the Counsellor had seemed to fail among us, being bravely\nmet and scattered, yet our courage was but as wind flinging wide the\ntare-seeds, when the sower casts them from his bag. The crop may not\ncome evenly, many places may long lie bare, and the field be all in\npatches; yet almost every vetch will spring, and tiller out, and stretch\nacross the scatterings where the wind puffed.\n\nAnd so dear mother and darling Lorna now had been for many a day\nthinking, worrying, and wearing, about the matter between us. Neither\nliked to look at the other, as they used to do; with mother admiring\nLorna's eyes, and grace, and form of breeding; and Lorna loving mother's\ngoodness, softness, and simplicity. And the saddest and most hurtful\nthing was that neither could ask the other of the shadow falling between\nthem. And so it went on, and deepened.\n\nIn the next place Colonel Stickles's illness was a grievous thing to\nus, in that we had no one now to command the troopers. Ten of these were\nstill alive, and so well approved to us, that they could never fancy\naught, whether for dinner or supper, without its being forth-coming. If\nthey wanted trout they should have it; if colloped venison, or broiled\nham, or salmon from Lynmouth and Trentisoe, or truffles from the\nwoodside, all these were at the warriors' service, until they lusted for\nsomething else. Even the wounded men ate nobly; all except poor Jeremy,\nwho was forced to have a young elder shoot, with the pith drawn, for to\nfeed him. And once, when they wanted pickled loach*  (from my description\nof it), I took up my boyish sport again, and pronged them a good jarful.\nTherefore, none of them could complain; and yet they were not satisfied;\nperhaps for want of complaining.\n\n     * There are said to be no loach now in Lynn. This proves\n     that John Ridd caught them all.\n\nBe that as it might, we knew that if they once resolved to go (as they\nmight do at any time, with only a corporal over them) all our house, and\nall our goods, ay, and our own precious lives, would and must be at the\nmercy of embittered enemies. For now the Doones, having driven back, as\nevery one said, five hundred men--though not thirty had ever fought with\nthem--were in such feather all round the country, that nothing was too\ngood for them. Offerings poured in at the Doone gate, faster than Doones\ncould away with them, and the sympathy both of Devon and Somerset became\nalmost oppressive. And perhaps this wealth of congratulation, and mutual\ngood feeling between plundered and victim, saved us from any piece of\nspite; kindliness having won the day, and every one loving every one.\n\nBut yet another cause arose, and this the strongest one of all, to prove\nthe need of Stickles's aid, and calamity of his illness. And this came\nto our knowledge first, without much time to think of it. For two men\nappeared at our gate one day, stripped to their shirts, and void of\nhorses, and looking very sorrowful. Now having some fear of attack from\nthe Doones, and scarce knowing what their tricks might be, we received\nthese strangers cautiously, desiring to know who they were before we let\nthem see all our premises.\n\nHowever, it soon became plain to us that although they might not be\nhonest fellows, at any rate they were not Doones; and so we took them\nin, and fed, and left them to tell their business. And this they were\nglad enough to do; as men who have been maltreated almost always are.\nAnd it was not for us to contradict them, lest our victuals should go\namiss.\n\nThese two very worthy fellows--nay, more than that by their own account,\nbeing downright martyrs--were come, for the public benefit, from the\nCourt of Chancery, sitting for everybody's good, and boldly redressing\nevil. This court has a power of scent unknown to the Common-law\npractitioners, and slowly yet surely tracks its game; even as the great\nlumbering dogs, now introduced from Spain, and called by some people\n\"pointers,\" differ from the swift gaze-hound, who sees his prey and runs\nhim down in the manner of the common lawyers. If a man's ill fate should\ndrive him to make a choice between these two, let him rather be chased\nby the hounds of law, than tracked by the dogs of Equity.\n\nNow, as it fell in a very black day (for all except the lawyers) His\nMajesty's Court of Chancery, if that be what it called itself, gained\nscent of poor Lorna's life, and of all that might be made of it. Whether\nthrough that brave young lord who ran into such peril, or through any\nof his friends, or whether through that deep old Counsellor, whose game\nnone might penetrate; or through any disclosures of the Italian woman,\nor even of Jeremy himself; none just now could tell us; only this truth\nwas too clear--Chancery had heard of Lorna, and then had seen how\nrich she was; and never delaying in one thing, had opened mouth, and\nswallowed her.\n\nThe Doones, with a share of that dry humour which was in them\nhereditary, had welcomed the two apparitors (if that be the proper name\nfor them) and led them kindly down the valley, and told them then to\nserve their writ. Misliking the look of things, these poor men began to\nfumble among their clothes; upon which the Doones cried, \"off with them!\nLet us see if your message he on your skins.\" And with no more manners\nthan that, they stripped, and lashed them out of the valley; only\nbidding them come to us, if they wanted Lorna Doone; and to us they came\naccordingly. Neither were they sure at first but that we should treat\nthem so; for they had no knowledge of the west country, and thought it\nquite a godless place, wherein no writ was holy.\n\nWe however comforted and cheered them so considerably, that, in\ngratitude, they showed their writs, to which they had stuck like\nleeches. And these were twofold; one addressed to Mistress Lorna Doone,\nso called, and bidding her keep in readiness to travel whenever called\nupon, and commit herself to nobody, except the accredited messengers\nof the right honourable Court; while the other was addressed to all\nsubjects of His Majesty, having custody of Lorna Doone, or any power\nover her. And this last threatened and exhorted, and held out hopes\nof recompense, if she were rendered truly. My mother and I held\nconsultation, over both these documents, with a mixture of some wrath\nand fear, and a fork of great sorrow to stir them. And now having Jeremy\nStickles's leave, which he gave with a nod when I told him all, and at\nlast made him understand it, I laid bare to my mother as well what\nI knew, as what I merely surmised, or guessed, concerning Lorna's\nparentage. All this she received with great tears, and wonder, and\nfervent thanks to God, and still more fervent praise of her son, who had\nnothing whatever to do with it. However, now the question was, how to\nact about these writs. And herein it was most unlucky that we could not\nhave Master Stickles, with his knowledge of the world, and especially\nof the law-courts, to advise us what to do, and to help in doing it. And\nfirstly of the first I said, \"We have rogues to deal with; but try we\nnot to rogue them.\"\n\nTo this, in some measure, dear mother agreed, though she could not see\nthe justice of it, yet thought that it might be wiser, because of our\nwant of practice. And then I said, \"Now we are bound to tell Lorna, and\nto serve her citation upon her, which these good fellows have given us.\"\n\n\"Then go, and do it thyself, my son,\" mother replied with a mournful\nsmile, misdoubting what the end might be. So I took the slip of brown\nparchment, and went to seek my darling.\n\nLorna was in her favourite place, the little garden which she tended\nwith such care and diligence. Seeing how the maiden loved it, and was\nhappy there, I had laboured hard to fence it from the dangers of the\nwood. And here she had corrected me, with better taste, and sense of\npleasure, and the joys of musing. For I meant to shut out the brook, and\nbuild my fence inside of it; but Lorna said no; if we must have a fence,\nwhich could not but be injury, at any rate leave the stream inside,\nand a pleasant bank beyond it. And soon I perceived that she was right,\nthough not so much as afterwards; for the fairest of all things in a\ngarden, and in summer-time most useful, is a brook of crystal water;\nwhere a man may come and meditate, and the flowers may lean and see\nthemselves, and the rays of the sun are purified. Now partly with her own\nwhite hands, and partly with Gwenny's red ones, Lorna had made of this\nsunny spot a haven of beauty to dwell in. It was not only that colours\nlay in the harmony we would seek of them, neither was it the height of\nplants, sloping to one another; nor even the delicate tone of foliage\nfollowing suit, and neighbouring. Even the breathing of the wind, soft\nand gentle in and out, moving things that need not move, and passing\nlonger-stalked ones, even this was not enough among the flush of\nfragrance, to tell a man the reason of his quiet satisfaction. But so it\nshall for ever be. As the river we float upon (with wine, and flowers,\nand music,) is nothing at the well-spring but a bubble without reason.\n\nFeeling many things, but thinking without much to guide me, over the\ngrass-plats laid between, I went up to Lorna. She in a shower of damask\nroses, raised her eyes and looked at me. And even now, in those sweet\neyes, so deep with loving-kindness, and soft maiden dreamings, there\nseemed to be a slight unwilling, half confessed withdrawal; overcome by\nlove and duty, yet a painful thing to see.\n\n[Illustration: 502.jpg In a shower of damask roses]\n\n\"Darling,\" I said, \"are your spirits good? Are you strong enough to-day,\nto bear a tale of cruel sorrow; but which perhaps, when your tears are\nshed, will leave you all the happier?\"\n\n\"What can you mean?\" she answered trembling, not having been very strong\nof late, and now surprised at my manner; \"are you come to give me up,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Not very likely,\" I replied; \"neither do I hope such a thing would\nleave you all the happier. Oh, Lorna, if you can think that so quickly\nas you seem to have done, now you have every prospect and strong\ntemptation to it. You are far, far above me in the world, and I have no\nright to claim you. Perhaps, when you have heard these tidings you will\nsay, 'John Ridd, begone; your life and mine are parted.'\"\n\n\"Will I?\" cried Lorna, with all the brightness of her playful ways\nreturning: \"you very foolish and jealous John, how shall I punish you\nfor this? Am I to forsake every flower I have, and not even know that\nthe world goes round, while I look up at you, the whole day long and\nsay, 'John, I love, love, love you?'\"\n\nDuring these words she leaned upon me, half in gay imitation of what\nI had so often made her do, and half in depth of earnestness, as the\nthrice-repeated word grew stronger, and grew warmer, with and to her\nheart. And as she looked up at the finish, saying, \"you,\" so musically,\nI was much inclined to clasp her round; but remembering who she was,\nforbore; at which she seemed surprised with me.\n\n\"Mistress Lorna,\" I replied, with I know not what temptation, making\nlittle of her caresses, though more than all my heart to me: \"Mistress\nLorna, you must keep your rank and proper dignity. You must never look\nat me with anything but pity now.\"\n\n\"I shall look at you with pity, John,\" said Lorna, trying to laugh it\noff, yet not knowing what to make of me, \"if you talk any more of this\nnonsense, knowing me as you ought to do. I shall even begin to think\nthat you, and your friends, are weary of me, and of so long supporting\nme; and are only seeking cause to send me back to my old misery. If it\nbe so, I will go. My life matters little to any one.\" Here the great\nbright tears arose; but the maiden was too proud to sob.\n\n\"Sweetest of all sweet loves,\" I cried, for the sign of a tear defeated\nme; \"what possibility could make me ever give up Lorna?\"\n\n\"Dearest of all dears,\" she answered; \"if you dearly love me, what\npossibility could ever make me give you up, dear?\"\n\nUpon that there was no more forbearing, but I kissed and clasped her,\nwhether she were Countess, or whether Queen of England; mine she was, at\nleast in heart; and mine she should be wholly. And she being of the same\nopinion, nothing was said between us.\n\n\"Now, Lorna,\" said I, as she hung on my arm, willing to trust me\nanywhere, \"come to your little plant-house, and hear my moving story.\"\n\n\"No story can move me much, dear,\" she answered rather faintly, for any\nexcitement stayed with her; \"since I know your strength of kindness,\nscarcely any tale can move me, unless it be of yourself, love; or of my\npoor mother.\"\n\n\"It is of your poor mother, darling. Can you bear to hear it?\" And yet I\nwondered why she did not say as much of her father.\n\n\"Yes, I can bear anything. But although I cannot see her, and have long\nforgotten, I could not bear to hear ill of her.\"\n\n\"There is no ill to hear, sweet child, except of evil done to her.\nLorna, you are of an ill-starred race.\"\n\n\"Better that than a wicked race,\" she answered with her usual quickness,\nleaping at conclusion; \"tell me I am not a Doone, and I will--but I\ncannot love you more.\"\n\n\"You are not a Doone, my Lorna, for that, at least, I can answer; though\nI know not what your name is.\"\n\n\"And my father--your father--what I mean is--\"\n\n\"Your father and mine never met one another. Your father was killed by\nan accident in the Pyrenean mountains, and your mother by the Doones; or\nat least they caused her death, and carried you away from her.\"\n\nAll this, coming as in one breath upon the sensitive maiden, was more\nthan she could bear all at once; as any but a fool like me must of\ncourse have known. She lay back on the garden bench, with her black hair\nshed on the oaken bark, while her colour went and came and only by that,\nand her quivering breath, could any one say that she lived and thought.\nAnd yet she pressed my hand with hers, that I might tell her all of it.\n\n[Illustration: 504.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nJOHN BECOMES TOO POPULAR\n\n[Illustration: 505.jpg Lorna]\n\nNo flower that I have ever seen, either in shifting of light and shade,\nor in the pearly morning, may vie with a fair young woman's face when\ntender thought and quick emotion vary, enrich, and beautify it. Thus my\nLorna hearkened softly, almost without word or gesture, yet with sighs\nand glances telling, and the pressure of my hand, how each word was\nmoving her.\n\nWhen at last my tale was done, she turned away, and wept bitterly for\nthe sad fate of her parents. But to my surprise she spoke not even a\nword of wrath or rancour. She seemed to take it all as fate.\n\n\"Lorna, darling,\" I said at length, for men are more impatient in trials\nof time than women are, \"do you not even wish to know what your proper\nname is?\"\n\n\"How can it matter to me, John?\" she answered, with a depth of grief\nwhich made me seem a trifler. \"It can never matter now, when there are\nnone to share it.\"\n\n\"Poor little soul!\" was all I said in a tone of purest pity; and to my\nsurprise she turned upon me, caught me in her arms, and loved me as she\nhad never done before.\n\n\"Dearest, I have you,\" she cried; \"you, and only you, love. Having you I\nwant no other. All my life is one with yours. Oh, John, how can I treat\nyou so?\"\n\nBlushing through the wet of weeping, and the gloom of pondering, yet she\nwould not hide her eyes, but folded me, and dwelled on me.\n\n\"I cannot believe,\" in the pride of my joy, I whispered into one little\near, \"that you could ever so love me, beauty, as to give up the world\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Would you give up your farm for me, John?\" cried Lorna, leaping back\nand looking, with her wondrous power of light at me; \"would you give up\nyour mother, your sisters, your home, and all that you have in the world\nand every hope of your life, John?\"\n\n\"Of course I would. Without two thoughts. You know it; you know it,\nLorna.\"\n\n\"It is true that I do,\" she answered in a tone of deepest sadness; \"and\nit is this power of your love which has made me love you so. No good can\ncome of it, no good. God's face is set against selfishness.\"\n\nAs she spoke in that low tone I gazed at the clear lines of her face\n(where every curve was perfect) not with love and wonder only, but with\na strange new sense of awe.\n\n\"Darling,\" I said, \"come nearer to me. Give me surety against that. For\nGod's sake never frighten me with the thought that He would part us.\"\n\n\"Does it then so frighten you?\" she whispered, coming close to me; \"I\nknow it, dear; I have known it long; but it never frightens me. It makes\nme sad, and very lonely, till I can remember.\"\n\n\"'Till you can remember what?\" I asked, with a long, deep shudder; for we\nare so superstitious.\n\n\"Until I do remember, love, that you will soon come back to me, and be\nmy own for ever. This is what I always think of, this is what I hope\nfor.\"\n\nAlthough her eyes were so glorious, and beaming with eternity, this\ndistant sort of beatitude was not much to my liking. I wanted to have\nmy love on earth; and my dear wife in my own home; and children in good\ntime, if God should please to send us any. And then I would be to them,\nexactly what my father was to me. And beside all this, I doubted much\nabout being fit for heaven; where no ploughs are, and no cattle, unless\nsacrificed bulls went thither.\n\nTherefore I said, \"Now kiss me, Lorna; and don't talk any nonsense.\" And\nthe darling came and did it; being kindly obedient, as the other world\noften makes us.\n\n\"You sweet love,\" I said at this, being slave to her soft obedience; \"do\nyou suppose I should be content to leave you until Elysium?\"\n\n\"How on earth can I tell, dear John, what you will be content with?\"\n\n\"You, and only you,\" said I; \"the whole of it lies in a syllable. Now\nyou know my entire want; and want must be my comfort.\"\n\n\"But surely if I have money, sir, and birth, and rank, and all sorts of\ngrandeur, you would never dare to think of me.\"\n\nShe drew herself up with an air of pride, as she gravely pronounced\nthese words, and gave me a scornful glance, or tried; and turned away\nas if to enter some grand coach or palace; while I was so amazed and\ngrieved in my raw simplicity especially after the way in which she had\nfirst received my news, so loving and warm-hearted, that I never said a\nword, but stared and thought, \"How does she mean it?\"\n\nShe saw the pain upon my forehead, and the wonder in my eyes, and\nleaving coach and palace too, back she flew to me in a moment, as simple\nas simplest milkmaid.\n\n\"Oh, you fearful stupid, John, you inexpressibly stupid, John,\" she\ncried with both arms round my neck, and her lips upon my forehead; \"you\nhave called yourself thick-headed, John, and I never would believe it.\nBut now I do with all my heart. Will you never know what I am, love?\"\n\n\"No, Lorna, that I never shall. I can understand my mother well, and one\nat least of my sisters, and both the Snowe girls very easily, but you I\nnever understand; only love you all the more for it.\"\n\n\"Then never try to understand me, if the result is that, dear John. And\nyet I am the very simplest of all foolish simple creatures. Nay, I am\nwrong; therein I yield the palm to you, my dear. To think that I can\nact so! No wonder they want me in London, as an ornament for the stage,\nJohn.\"\n\nNow in after days, when I heard of Lorna as the richest, and noblest,\nand loveliest lady to be found in London, I often remembered that little\nscene, and recalled every word and gesture, wondering what lay under it.\nEven now, while it was quite impossible once to doubt those clear deep\neyes, and the bright lips trembling so; nevertheless I felt how much\nthe world would have to do with it; and that the best and truest people\ncannot shake themselves quite free. However, for the moment, I was very\nproud and showed it.\n\nAnd herein differs fact from fancy, things as they befall us from things\nas we would have them, human ends from human hopes; that the first are\nmoved by a thousand and the last on two wheels only, which (being named)\nare desire and fear. Hope of course is nothing more than desire with a\ntelescope, magnifying distant matters, overlooking near ones; opening\none eye on the objects, closing the other to all objections. And if hope\nbe the future tense of desire, the future of fear is religion--at least\nwith too many of us.\n\nWhether I am right or wrong in these small moralities, one thing is sure\nenough, to wit, that hope is the fastest traveller, at any rate, in the\ntime of youth. And so I hoped that Lorna might be proved of blameless\nfamily, and honourable rank and fortune; and yet none the less for that,\nlove me and belong to me. So I led her into the house, and she fell into\nmy mother's arms; and I left them to have a good cry of it, with Annie\nready to help them.\n\nIf Master Stickles should not mend enough to gain his speech a little,\nand declare to us all he knew, I was to set out for Watchett, riding\nupon horseback, and there to hire a cart with wheels, such as we had not\nbegun, as yet, to use on Exmoor. For all our work went on broad wood,\nwith runners and with earthboards; and many of us still looked upon\nwheels (though mentioned in the Bible) as the invention of the evil one,\nand Pharoah's especial property.\n\nNow, instead of getting better, Colonel Stickles grew worse and worse,\nin spite of all our tendance of him, with simples and with nourishment,\nand no poisonous medicine, such as doctors would have given him. And the\nfault of this lay not with us, but purely with himself and his unquiet\nconstitution. For he roused himself up to a perfect fever, when through\nLizzie's giddiness he learned the very thing which mother and Annie were\nhiding from him, with the utmost care; namely, that Sergeant Bloxham had\ntaken upon himself to send direct to London by the Chancery officers,\na full report of what had happened, and of the illness of his chief,\ntogether with an urgent prayer for a full battalion of King's troops,\nand a plenary commander.\n\nThis Sergeant Bloxham, being senior of the surviving soldiers, and a\nvery worthy man in his way, but a trifle over-zealous, had succeeded to\nthe captaincy upon his master's disablement. Then, with desire to serve\nhis country and show his education, he sat up most part of three nights,\nand wrote this very wonderful report by the aid of our stable lanthorn.\nIt was a very fine piece of work, as three men to whom he read it (but\nonly one at a time) pronounced, being under seal of secrecy. And all\nmight have gone well with it, if the author could only have held his\ntongue, when near the ears of women. But this was beyond his sense as it\nseems, although so good a writer. For having heard that our Lizzie was\na famous judge of literature (as indeed she told almost every one), he\ncould not contain himself, but must have her opinion upon his work.\n\nLizzie sat on a log of wood, and listened with all her ears up, having\nmade proviso that no one else should be there to interrupt her. And she\nput in a syllable here and there, and many a time she took out one (for\nthe Sergeant overloaded his gun, more often than undercharged it; like\na liberal man of letters), and then she declared the result so good,\nso chaste, and the style to be so elegant, and yet so fervent, that the\nSergeant broke his pipe in three, and fell in love with her on the spot.\nNow this has led me out of my way; as things are always doing, partly\nthrough their own perverseness, partly through my kind desire to give\nfair turn to all of them, and to all the people who do them. If any one\nexpects of me a strict and well-drilled story, standing \"at attention\"\nall the time, with hands at the side like two wens on my trunk, and eyes\ngoing neither right nor left; I trow that man has been disappointed\nmany a page ago, and has left me to my evil ways; and if not, I love his\ncharity. Therefore let me seek his grace, and get back, and just begin\nagain.\n\nThat great despatch was sent to London by the Chancery officers, whom\nwe fitted up with clothes, and for three days fattened them; which in\nstrict justice they needed much, as well as in point of equity. They\nwere kind enough to be pleased with us, and accepted my new shirts\ngenerously; and urgent as their business was, another week (as they both\ndeclared) could do no harm to nobody, and might set them upon their legs\nagain. And knowing, although they were London men, that fish do live\nin water, these two fellows went fishing all day, but never landed\nanything. However, their holiday was cut short; for the Sergeant, having\nfinished now his narrative of proceedings, was not the man to let it\nhang fire, and be quenched perhaps by Stickles.\n\nTherefore, having done their business, and served both citations,\nthese two good men had a pannier of victuals put up by dear Annie, and\nborrowing two of our horses, rode to Dunster, where they left them, and\nhired on towards London. We had not time to like them much, and so we\ndid not miss them, especially in our great anxiety about poor Master\nStickles.\n\nJeremy lay between life and death, for at least a fortnight. If the link\nof chain had flown upwards (for half a link of chain it was which took\nhim in the mouth so), even one inch upwards, the poor man could have\nneeded no one except Parson Bowden; for the bottom of his skull, which\nholds the brain as in the egg-cup, must have clean gone from him. But\nstriking him horizontally, and a little upon the skew, the metal\ncame out at the back of his neck, and (the powder not being strong, I\nsuppose) it lodged in his leather collar.\n\nNow the rust of this iron hung in the wound, or at least we thought so;\nthough since I have talked with a man of medicine, I am not so sure of\nit. And our chief aim was to purge this rust; when rather we should have\nstopped the hole, and let the oxide do its worst, with a plug of new\nflesh on both sides of it.\n\nAt last I prevailed upon him by argument, that he must get better, to\nsave himself from being ignobly and unjustly superseded; and hereupon\nI reviled Sergeant Bloxham more fiercely than Jeremy's self could have\ndone, and indeed to such a pitch that Jeremy almost forgave him, and\nbecame much milder. And after that his fever and the inflammation of his\nwound, diminished very rapidly.\n\nHowever, not knowing what might happen, or even how soon poor Lorna\nmight be taken from our power, and, falling into lawyers' hands, have\ncause to wish herself most heartily back among the robbers, I set forth\none day for Watchett, taking advantage of the visit of some troopers\nfrom an outpost, who would make our house quite safe. I rode alone,\nbeing fully primed, and having no misgivings. For it was said that even\nthe Doones had begun to fear me, since I cast their culverin through the\ndoor, as above related; and they could not but believe, from my being\nstill untouched (although so large an object) in the thickest of their\nfire, both of gun and cannon, that I must bear a charmed life, proof\nagainst ball and bullet. However, I knew that Carver Doone was not\na likely man to hold any superstitious opinions; and of him I had an\ninstinctive dread, although quite ready to face him.\n\nRiding along, I meditated upon Lorna's history; how many things were\nnow beginning to unfold themselves, which had been obscure and dark!\nFor instance, Sir Ensor Doone's consent, or to say the least his\nindifference, to her marriage with a yeoman; which in a man so proud\n(though dying) had greatly puzzled both of us. But now, if she not only\nproved to be no grandchild of the Doone, but even descended from his\nenemy, it was natural enough that he should feel no great repugnance to\nher humiliation. And that Lorna's father had been a foe to the house\nof Doone I gathered from her mother's cry when she beheld their leader.\nMoreover that fact would supply their motive in carrying off the\nunfortunate little creature, and rearing her among them, and as one of\ntheir own family; yet hiding her true birth from her. She was a \"great\ncard,\" as we say, when playing All-fours at Christmas-time; and if one\nof them could marry her, before she learned of right and wrong, vast\nproperty, enough to buy pardons for a thousand Doones, would be at their\nmercy. And since I was come to know Lorna better, and she to know me\nthoroughly--many things had been outspoken, which her early bashfulness\nhad kept covered from me. Attempts I mean to pledge her love to this\none, or that other; some of which perhaps might have been successful, if\nthere had not been too many.\n\nAnd then, as her beauty grew richer and brighter, Carver Doone was\nsmitten strongly, and would hear of no one else as a suitor for her; and\nby the terror of his claim drove off all the others. Here too may the\nexplanation of a thing which seemed to be against the laws of human\nnature, and upon which I longed, but dared not to cross-question Lorna.\nHow could such a lovely girl, although so young, and brave, and distant,\nhave escaped the vile affections of a lawless company?\n\nBut now it was as clear as need be. For any proven violence would have\nutterly vitiated all claim upon her grand estate; at least as those\nclaims must be urged before a court of equity. And therefore all the\nelders (with views upon her real estate) kept strict watch on the\nyoungers, who confined their views to her personality.\n\nNow I do not mean to say that all this, or the hundred other things\nwhich came, crowding consideration, were half as plain to me at the\ntime, as I have set them down above. Far be it from me to deceive you\nso. No doubt my thoughts were then dark and hazy, like an oil-lamp full\nof fungus; and I have trimmed them, as when they burned, with scissors\nsharpened long afterwards. All I mean to say is this, that jogging along\nto a certain tune of the horse's feet, which we call \"three-halfpence\nand twopence,\" I saw my way a little into some things which had puzzled\nme.\n\nWhen I knocked at the little door, whose sill was gritty and grimed with\nsand, no one came for a very long time to answer me, or to let me in.\nNot wishing to be unmannerly, I waited a long time, and watched the sea,\nfrom which the wind was blowing; and whose many lips of waves--though\nthe tide was half-way out--spoke to and refreshed me. After a while I\nknocked again, for my horse was becoming hungry; and a good while after\nthat again, a voice came through the key-hole,--\n\n\"Who is that wishes to enter?\"\n\n\"The boy who was at the pump,\" said I, \"when the carriage broke down\nat Dulverton. The boy that lives at oh--ah; and some day you would come\nseek for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember certainly. My leetle boy, with the fair white skin.\nI have desired to see him, oh many, yes, many times.\"\n\nShe was opening the door, while saying this, and then she started back\nin affright that the little boy should have grown so.\n\n\"You cannot be that leetle boy. It is quite impossible. Why do you\nimpose on me?\"\n\n\"Not only am I that little boy, who made the water to flow for you, till\nthe nebule came upon the glass; but also I am come to tell you all about\nyour little girl.\"\n\n\"Come in, you very great leetle boy,\" she answered, with her dark eyes\nbrightened. And I went in, and looked at her. She was altered by time,\nas much as I was. The slight and graceful shape was gone; not that I\nremembered anything of her figure, if you please; for boys of twelve are\nnot yet prone to note the shapes of women; but that her lithe straight\ngait had struck me as being so unlike our people. Now her time for\nwalking so was past, and transmitted to her children. Yet her face was\ncomely still, and full of strong intelligence. I gazed at her, and she\nat me; and we were sure of one another.\n\n\"Now what will ye please to eat?\" she asked, with a lively glance at\nthe size of my mouth: \"that is always the first thing you people ask, in\nthese barbarous places.\"\n\n\"I will tell you by-and-by,\" I answered, misliking this satire upon us;\n\"but I might begin with a quart of ale, to enable me to speak, madam.\"\n\n\"Very well. One quevart of be-or;\" she called out to a little maid,\nwho was her eldest child, no doubt. \"It is to be expected, sir. Be-or,\nbe-or, be-or, all day long, with you Englishmen!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I replied, \"not all day long, if madam will excuse me. Only a\npint at breakfast-time, and a pint and a half at eleven o'clock, and a\nquart or so at dinner. And then no more till the afternoon; and half a\ngallon at supper-time. No one can object to that.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it is right,\" she said, with an air of resignation;\n\"God knows. But I do not understand it. It is 'good for business,' as\nyou say, to preclude everything.\"\n\n\"And it is good for us, madam,\" I answered with indignation, \"for beer is\nmy favourite beverage; and I am a credit to beer, madam; and so are all\nwho trust to it.\"\n\n\"At any rate, you are, young man. If beer has made you grow so large, I\nwill put my children upon it; it is too late for me to begin. The smell\nto me is hateful.\"\n\nNow I only set down that to show how perverse those foreign people\nare. They will drink their wretched heartless stuff, such as they call\nclaret, or wine of Medoc, or Bordeaux, or what not, with no more meaning\nthan sour rennet, stirred with the pulp from the cider press, and\nstrained through the cap of our Betty. This is very well for them; and\nas good as they deserve, no doubt, and meant perhaps by the will of God,\nfor those unhappy natives. But to bring it over to England and set it\nagainst our home-brewed ale (not to speak of wines from Portugal) and\nsell it at ten times the price, as a cure for British bile, and a great\nenlightenment; this I say is the vilest feature of the age we live in.\n\nMadam Benita Odam--for the name of the man who turned the wheel proved\nto be John Odam--showed me into a little room containing two chairs and\na fir-wood table, and sat down on a three-legged seat and studied me\nvery steadfastly. This she had a right to do; and I, having all my\nclothes on now, was not disconcerted. It would not become me to repeat\nher judgment upon my appearance, which she delivered as calmly as if I\nwere a pig at market, and as proudly as if her own pig. And she asked me\nwhether I had ever got rid of the black marks on my breast.\n\nNot wanting to talk about myself (though very fond of doing so, when\ntime and season favour) I led her back to that fearful night of the day\nwhen first I had seen her. She was not desirous to speak of it,\nbecause of her own little children; however, I drew her gradually to\nrecollection of Lorna, and then of the little boy who died, and the\npoor mother buried with him. And her strong hot nature kindled, as she\ndwelled upon these things; and my wrath waxed within me; and we forgot\nreserve and prudence under the sense of so vile a wrong. She told me\n(as nearly as might be) the very same story which she had told to Master\nJeremy Stickles; only she dwelled upon it more, because of my knowing\nthe outset. And being a woman, with an inkling of my situation, she\nenlarged upon the little maid, more than to dry Jeremy.\n\n\"Would you know her again?\" I asked, being stirred by these accounts of\nLorna, when she was five years old: \"would you know her as a full-grown\nmaiden?\"\n\n\"I think I should,\" she answered; \"it is not possible to say until one\nsees the person; but from the eyes of the little girl, I think that I\nmust know her. Oh, the poor young creature! Is it to be believed that\nthe cannibals devoured her! What a people you are in this country! Meat,\nmeat, meat!\"\n\nAs she raised her hands and eyes in horror at our carnivorous\npropensities, to which she clearly attributed the disappearance of\nLorna, I could scarce help laughing, even after that sad story. For\nthough it is said at the present day, and will doubtless be said\nhereafter, that the Doones had devoured a baby once, as they came up\nPorlock hill, after fighting hard in the market-place, I knew that the\ntale was utterly false; for cruel and brutal as they were, their taste\nwas very correct and choice, and indeed one might say fastidious.\nNevertheless I could not stop to argue that matter with her.\n\n\"The little maid has not been devoured,\" I said to Mistress Odam: \"and\nnow she is a tall young lady, and as beautiful as can be. If I sleep in\nyour good hostel to-night after going to Watchett town, will you come\nwith me to Oare to-morrow, and see your little maiden?\"\n\n\"I would like--and yet I fear. This country is so barbarous. And I am\ngood to eat--my God, there is much picking on my bones!\"\n\nShe surveyed herself with a glance so mingled of pity and admiration,\nand the truth of her words was so apparent (only that it would have\ntaken a week to get at the bones, before picking) that I nearly lost\ngood manners; for she really seemed to suspect even me of cannibal\ninclinations. However, at last I made her promise to come with me on the\nmorrow, presuming that Master Odam could by any means be persuaded to\nkeep her company in the cart, as propriety demanded. Having little doubt\nthat Master Odam was entirely at his wife's command, I looked upon that\nmatter as settled, and set off for Watchett, to see the grave of Lorna's\npoor mother, and to hire a cart for the morrow.\n\nAnd here (as so often happens with men) I succeeded without any trouble\nor hindrance, where I had looked for both of them, namely, in finding a\nsuitable cart; whereas the other matter, in which I could have expected\nno difficulty, came very near to defeat me. For when I heard that\nLorna's father was the Earl of Dugal--as Benita impressed upon me with a\nstrong enforcement, as much as to say, \"Who are you, young man, to come\neven asking about her?\"--then I never thought but that everybody in\nWatchett town must know all about the tombstone of the Countess of\nDugal.\n\nThis, however, proved otherwise. For Lord Dugal had never lived at\nWatchett Grange, as their place was called; neither had his name become\nfamiliar as its owner. Because the Grange had only devolved to him by\nwill, at the end of a long entail, when the last of the Fitz-Pains died\nout; and though he liked the idea of it, he had gone abroad, without\ntaking seisin. And upon news of his death, John Jones, a rich gentleman\nfrom Llandaff, had taken possession, as next of right, and hushed up all\nthe story. And though, even at the worst of times, a lady of high rank\nand wealth could not be robbed, and as bad as murdered, and then buried\nin a little place, without moving some excitement, yet it had been given\nout, on purpose and with diligence, that this was only a foreign lady\ntravelling for her health and pleasure, along the seacoast of England.\nAnd as the poor thing never spoke, and several of her servants and her\nbaggage looked so foreign, and she herself died in a collar of lace\nunlike any made in England, all Watchett, without hesitation, pronounced\nher to be a foreigner. And the English serving man and maid, who might\nhave cleared up everything, either were bribed by Master Jones, or else\ndecamped of their own accord with the relics of the baggage. So the poor\nCountess of Dugal, almost in sight of her own grand house, was buried in\nan unknown grave, with her pair of infants, without a plate, without a\ntombstone (worse than all) without a tear, except from the hired Italian\nwoman.\n\nSurely my poor Lorna came of an ill-starred family.\n\nNow in spite of all this, if I had only taken Benita with me, or even\ntold her what I wished, and craved her directions, there could have been\nno trouble. But I do assure you that among the stupid people at Watchett\n(compared with whom our folk of Oare, exceeding dense though being, are\nas Hamlet against Dogberry) what with one of them and another, and the\nfirm conviction of all the town that I could be come only to wrestle, I\ndo assure you (as I said before) that my wits almost went out of me.\nAnd what vexed me yet more about it was, that I saw my own mistake, in\ncoming myself to seek out the matter, instead of sending some unknown\nperson. For my face and form were known at that time (and still are so)\nto nine people out of every ten living in forty miles of me. Not through\nany excellence, or anything of good desert, in either the one or\nthe other, but simply because folks will be fools on the rivalry of\nwrestling. The art is a fine one in itself, and demands a little wit of\nbrain, as well as strength of body; it binds the man who studies it to\ntemperance, and chastity, to self-respect, and most of all to an even\nand sweet temper; for I have thrown stronger men than myself (when I was\na mere sapling, and before my strength grew hard on me) through their\nloss of temper. But though the art is an honest one, surely they who\nexcel therein have a right (like all the rest of man-kind) to their own\nprivate life.\n\nBe that either way--and I will not speak too strongly, for fear of\nindulging my own annoyance--anyhow, all Watchett town cared ten times as\nmuch to see John Ridd, as to show him what he wanted. I was led to every\npublic-house, instead of to the churchyard; and twenty tables were ready\nfor me, in lieu of a single gravestone. \"Zummerzett thou bee'st, Jan\nRidd, and Zummerzett thou shalt be. Thee carl theezell a Davonsheer man!\nWhoy, thee lives in Zummerzett; and in Zummerzett thee wast barn, lad.\"\nAnd so it went on, till I was weary; though very much obliged to them.\n\nDull and solid as I am, and with a wild duck waiting for me at good\nMistress Odam's, I saw that there was nothing for it but to yield to\nthese good people, and prove me a man of Somerset, by eating a dinner\nat their expense. As for the churchyard, none would hear of it; and I\ngrieved for broaching the matter.\n\nBut how was I to meet Lorna again, without having done the thing of all\nthings which I had promised to see to? It would never do to tell her\nthat so great was my popularity, and so strong the desire to feed me,\nthat I could not attend to her mother. Least of all could I say that\nevery one in Watchett knew John Ridd; while none had heard of the\nCountess of Dugal. And yet that was about the truth, as I hinted very\ndelicately to Mistress Odam that evening. But she (being vexed about her\nwild duck, and not having English ideas on the matter of sport, and so\non) made a poor unwitting face at me. Nevertheless Master Odam restored\nme to my self-respect; for he stared at me till I went to bed; and he\nbroke his hose with excitement. For being in the leg-line myself, I\nwanted to know what the muscles were of a man who turned a wheel all\nday. I had never seen a treadmill (though they have one now at Exeter),\nand it touched me much to learn whether it were good exercise. And\nherein, from what I saw of Odam, I incline to think that it does great\nharm; as moving the muscles too much in a line, and without variety.\n\n[Illustration: 517.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nLORNA KNOWS HER NURSE\n\n[Illustration: 518.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nHaving obtained from Benita Odam a very close and full description of\nthe place where her poor mistress lay, and the marks whereby to know it,\nI hastened to Watchett the following morning, before the sun was up,\nor any people were about. And so, without interruption, I was in the\nchurchyard at sunrise.\n\nIn the farthest and darkest nook, overgrown with grass, and overhung by\na weeping-tree a little bank of earth betokened the rounding off of a\nhapless life. There was nothing to tell of rank, or wealth, of love, or\neven pity; nameless as a peasant lay the last (as supposed) of a mighty\nrace. Only some unskilful hand, probably Master Odam's under his wife's\nteaching, had carved a rude L., and a ruder D., upon a large pebble from\nthe beach, and set it up as a headstone.\n\nI gathered a little grass for Lorna and a sprig of the weeping-tree, and\nthen returned to the Forest Cat, as Benita's lonely inn was called.\nFor the way is long from Watchett to Oare; and though you may ride\nit rapidly, as the Doones had done on that fatal night, to travel\non wheels, with one horse only, is a matter of time and of prudence.\nTherefore, we set out pretty early, three of us and a baby, who could\nnot well be left behind. The wife of the man who owned the cart had\nundertaken to mind the business, and the other babies, upon condition of\nhaving the keys of all the taps left with her.\n\n[Illustration: 519.jpg In the Churchyard]\n\nAs the manner of journeying over the moor has been described oft enough\nalready, I will say no more, except that we all arrived before dusk\nof the summer's day, safe at Plover's Barrows. Mistress Benita was\ndelighted with the change from her dull hard life; and she made many\nexcellent observations, such as seem natural to a foreigner looking at\nour country.\n\nAs luck would have it, the first who came to meet us at the gate was\nLorna, with nothing whatever upon her head (the weather being summerly)\nbut her beautiful hair shed round her; and wearing a sweet white frock\ntucked in, and showing her figure perfectly. In her joy she ran straight\nup to the cart; and then stopped and gazed at Benita. At one glance her\nold nurse knew her: \"Oh, the eyes, the eyes!\" she cried, and was over\nthe rail of the cart in a moment, in spite of all her substance. Lorna,\non the other hand, looked at her with some doubt and wonder, as though\nhaving right to know much about her, and yet unable to do so. But when\nthe foreign woman said something in Roman language, and flung new hay\nfrom the cart upon her, as if in a romp of childhood, the young maid\ncried, \"Oh, Nita, Nita!\" and fell upon her breast, and wept; and after\nthat looked round at us.\n\nThis being so, there could be no doubt as to the power of proving Lady\nLorna's birth, and rights, both by evidence and token. For though we had\nnot the necklace now--thanks to Annie's wisdom--we had the ring of heavy\ngold, a very ancient relic, with which my maid (in her simple way) had\npledged herself to me. And Benita knew this ring as well as she knew her\nown fingers, having heard a long history about it; and the effigy on it\nof the wild cat was the bearing of the house of Lorne.\n\nFor though Lorna's father was a nobleman of high and goodly lineage, her\nmother was of yet more ancient and renowned descent, being the last\nin line direct from the great and kingly chiefs of Lorne. A wild and\nheadstrong race they were, and must have everything their own way. Hot\nblood was ever among them, even of one household; and their sovereignty\n(which more than once had defied the King of Scotland) waned and fell\namong themselves, by continual quarrelling. And it was of a piece with\nthis, that the Doones (who were an offset, by the mother's side, holding\nin co-partnership some large property, which had come by the spindle,\nas we say) should fall out with the Earl of Lorne, the last but one of\nthat title.\n\nThe daughter of this nobleman had married Sir Ensor Doone; but this,\ninstead of healing matters, led to fiercer conflict. I never could quite\nunderstand all the ins and outs of it; which none but a lawyer may go\nthrough, and keep his head at the end of it. The motives of mankind are\nplainer than the motions they produce. Especially when charity (such\nas found among us) sits to judge the former, and is never weary of it;\nwhile reason does not care to trace the latter complications, except for\nfee or title.\n\nTherefore it is enough to say, that knowing Lorna to be direct in\nheirship to vast property, and bearing especial spite against the house\nof which she was the last, the Doones had brought her up with full\nintention of lawful marriage; and had carefully secluded her from the\nwildest of their young gallants. Of course, if they had been next in\nsuccession, the child would have gone down the waterfall, to save any\nfurther trouble; but there was an intercepting branch of some honest\nfamily; and they being outlaws, would have a poor chance (though the law\nloves outlaws) against them. Only Lorna was of the stock; and Lorna they\nmust marry. And what a triumph against the old earl, for a cursed Doone\nto succeed him!\n\nAs for their outlawry, great robberies, and grand murders, the veriest\nchild, nowadays, must know that money heals the whole of that. Even if\nthey had murdered people of a good position, it would only cost about\ntwice as much to prove their motives loyal. But they had never slain any\nman above the rank of yeoman; and folk even said that my father was the\nhighest of their victims; for the death of Lorna's mother and brother\nwas never set to their account.\n\nPure pleasure it is to any man, to reflect upon all these things. How\ntruly we discern clear justice, and how well we deal it. If any poor\nman steals a sheep, having ten children starving, and regarding it as\nmountain game (as a rich man does a hare), to the gallows with him. If\na man of rank beats down a door, smites the owner upon the head, and\nhonours the wife with attention, it is a thing to be grateful for, and\nto slouch smitten head the lower.\n\nWhile we were full of all these things, and wondering what would happen\nnext, or what we ought ourselves to do, another very important matter\ncalled for our attention. This was no less than Annie's marriage to the\nSquire Faggus. We had tried to put it off again; for in spite of all\nadvantages, neither my mother nor myself had any real heart for it. Not\nthat we dwelled upon Tom's short-comings or rather perhaps his going too\nfar, at the time when he worked the road so. All that was covered by\nthe King's pardon, and universal respect of the neighbourhood. But our\nscruple was this--and the more we talked the more it grew upon us--that\nwe both had great misgivings as to his future steadiness.\n\nFor it would be a thousand pities, we said, for a fine, well-grown, and\npretty maiden (such as our Annie was), useful too, in so many ways, and\nlively, and warm-hearted, and mistress of 500 pounds, to throw herself\naway on a man with a kind of a turn for drinking. If that last were even\nhinted, Annie would be most indignant, and ask, with cheeks as red as\nroses, who had ever seen Master Faggus any the worse for liquor indeed?\nHer own opinion was, in truth, that he took a great deal too little,\nafter all his hard work, and hard riding, and coming over the hills to\nbe insulted! And if ever it lay in her power, and with no one to grudge\nhim his trumpery glass, she would see that poor Tom had the nourishment\nwhich his cough and his lungs required.\n\nHis lungs being quite as sound as mine, this matter was out of all\nargument; so mother and I looked at one another, as much as to say, \"let\nher go upstairs, she will cry and come down more reasonable.\" And while\nshe was gone, we used to say the same thing over and over again; but\nwithout perceiving a cure for it. And we almost always finished up with\nthe following reflection, which sometimes came from mother's lips, and\nsometimes from my own: \"Well, well, there is no telling. None can say\nhow a man may alter; when he takes to matrimony. But if we could only\nmake Annie promise to be a little firm with him!\"\n\nI fear that all this talk on our part only hurried matters forward,\nAnnie being more determined every time we pitied her. And at last Tom\nFaggus came, and spoke as if he were on the King's road, with a pistol\nat my head, and one at mother's. \"No more fast and loose,\" he cried.\n\"either one thing or the other. I love the maid, and she loves me; and\nwe will have one another, either with your leave, or without it. How\nmany more times am I to dance over these vile hills, and leave my\nbusiness, and get nothing more than a sigh or a kiss, and 'Tom, I must\nwait for mother'? You are famous for being straightforward, you Ridds.\nJust treat me as I would treat you now.\"\n\nI looked at my mother; for a glance from her would have sent Tom out of\nthe window; but she checked me with her hand, and said, \"You have\nsome ground of complaint, sir; I will not deny it. Now I will be as\nstraight-forward with you, as even a Ridd is supposed to be. My son and\nmyself have all along disliked your marriage with Annie. Not for what\nyou have been so much, as for what we fear you will be. Have patience,\none moment, if you please. We do not fear your taking to the highway\nlife again; for that you are too clever, no doubt, now that you have\nproperty. But we fear that you will take to drinking, and to squandering\nmoney. There are many examples of this around us; and we know what the\nfate of the wife is. It has been hard to tell you this, under our own\nroof, and with our own--\" Here mother hesitated.\n\n\"Spirits, and cider, and beer,\" I broke in; \"out with it, like a Ridd,\nmother; as he will have all of it.\"\n\n\"Spirits, and cider, and beer,\" said mother very firmly after me; and\nthen she gave way and said, \"You know, Tom, you are welcome to every\ndrop and more of it.\"\n\nNow Tom must have had a far sweeter temper than ever I could claim; for\nI should have thrust my glass away, and never have taken another drop\nin the house where such a check had met me. But instead of that, Master\nFaggus replied, with a pleasant smile,--\n\n\"I know that I am welcome, good mother; and to prove it, I will have\nsome more.\"\n\nAnd thereupon be mixed himself another glass of hollands with lemon and\nhot water, yet pouring it very delicately.\n\n\"Oh, I have been so miserable--take a little more, Tom,\" said mother,\nhanding the bottle.\n\n\"Yes, take a little more,\" I said; \"you have mixed it over weak, Tom.\"\n\n\"If ever there was a sober man,\" cried Tom, complying with our request;\n\"if ever there was in Christendom a man of perfect sobriety, that man is\nnow before you. Shall we say to-morrow week, mother? It will suit your\nwashing day.\"\n\n\"How very thoughtful you are, Tom! Now John would never have thought of\nthat, in spite of all his steadiness.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered proudly; \"when my time comes for Lorna, I\nshall not study Betty Muxworthy.\"\n\nIn this way the Squire got over us; and Farmer Nicholas Snowe was\nsent for, to counsel with mother about the matter and to set his two\ndaughters sewing.\n\nWhen the time for the wedding came, there was such a stir and commotion\nas had never been known in the parish of Oare since my father's\nmarriage. For Annie's beauty and kindliness had made her the pride of\nthe neighbourhood; and the presents sent her, from all around, were\nenough to stock a shop with. Master Stickles, who now could walk, and\nwho certainly owed his recovery, with the blessing of God, to Annie,\npresented her with a mighty Bible, silver-clasped, and very handsome,\nbeating the parson's out and out, and for which he had sent to Taunton.\nEven the common troopers, having tasted her cookery many times (to help\nout their poor rations), clubbed together, and must have given at least\na week's pay apiece, to have turned out what they did for her. This was\nno less than a silver pot, well-designed, but suited surely rather\nto the bridegroom's taste than bride's. In a word, everybody gave her\nthings.\n\nAnd now my Lorna came to me, with a spring of tears in appealing\neyes--for she was still somewhat childish, or rather, I should say, more\nchildish now than when she lived in misery--and she placed her little\nhand in mine, and she was half afraid to speak, and dropped her eyes for\nme to ask.\n\n\"What is it, little darling?\" I asked, as I saw her breath come fast;\nfor the smallest emotion moved her form.\n\n\"You don't think, John, you don't think, dear, that you could lend me\nany money?\"\n\n\"All I have got,\" I answered; \"how much do you want, dear heart?\"\n\n\"I have been calculating; and I fear that I cannot do any good with less\nthan ten pounds, John.\"\n\nHere she looked up at me, with horror at the grandeur of the sum, and\nnot knowing what I could think of it. But I kept my eyes from her.\n\"Ten pounds!\" I said in my deepest voice, on purpose to have it out\nin comfort, when she should be frightened; \"what can you want with ten\npounds, child?\"\n\n[Illustration: 524.jpg Kept my eyes from her]\n\n\"That is my concern,\" said Lorna, plucking up her spirit at this: \"when\na lady asks for a loan, no gentleman pries into the cause of her asking\nit.\"\n\n\"That may be as may be,\" I answered in a judicial manner; \"ten pounds,\nor twenty, you shall have. But I must know the purport.\"\n\n\"Then that you never shall know, John. I am very sorry for asking you.\nIt is not of the smallest consequence. Oh, dear, no.\" Herewith she was\nrunning away.\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes,\" I replied; \"it is of very great consequence; and I\nunderstand the whole of it. You want to give that stupid Annie, who\nhas lost you a hundred thousand pounds, and who is going to be married\nbefore us, dear--God only can tell why, being my younger sister--you\nwant to give her a wedding present. And you shall do it, darling;\nbecause it is so good of you. Don't you know your title, love? How\nhumble you are with us humble folk. You are Lady Lorna something, so far\nas I can make out yet: and you ought not even to speak to us. You will\ngo away and disdain us.\"\n\n\"If you please, talk not like that, John. I will have nothing to do with\nit, if it comes between you and me, John.\"\n\n\"You cannot help yourself,\" said I. And then she vowed that she could\nand would. And rank and birth were banished from between our lips in no\ntime.\n\n\"What can I get her good enough? I am sure I do not know,\" she asked:\n\"she has been so kind and good to me, and she is such a darling. How I\nshall miss her, to be sure! By the bye, you seem to think, John, that I\nshall be rich some day.\"\n\n\"Of course you will. As rich as the French King who keeps ours. Would\nthe Lord Chancellor trouble himself about you, if you were poor?\"\n\n\"Then if I am rich, perhaps you would lend me twenty pounds, dear John.\nTen pounds would be very mean for a wealthy person to give her.\"\n\nTo this I agreed, upon condition that I should make the purchase myself,\nwhatever it might be. For nothing could be easier than to cheat Lorna\nabout the cost, until time should come for her paying me. And this was\nbetter than to cheat her for the benefit of our family. For this end,\nand for many others, I set off to Dulverton, bearing more commissions,\nmore messages, and more questions than a man of thrice my memory might\ncarry so far as the corner where the sawpit is. And to make things\nworse, one girl or other would keep on running up to me, or even after\nme (when started) with something or other she had just thought of, which\nshe could not possibly do without, and which I must be sure to remember,\nas the most important of the whole.\n\nTo my dear mother, who had partly outlived the exceeding value of\ntrifles, the most important matter seemed to ensure Uncle Reuben's\ncountenance and presence at the marriage. And if I succeeded in this,\nI might well forget all the maidens' trumpery. This she would have been\nwiser to tell me when they were out of hearing; for I left her to fight\nher own battle with them; and laughing at her predicament, promised to\ndo the best I could for all, so far as my wits would go.\n\nUncle Reuben was not at home, but Ruth, who received me very kindly,\nalthough without any expressions of joy, was sure of his return in the\nafternoon, and persuaded me to wait for him. And by the time that I had\nfinished all I could recollect of my orders, even with paper to help\nme, the old gentleman rode into the yard, and was more surprised than\npleased to see me. But if he was surprised, I was more than that--I was\nutterly astonished at the change in his appearance since the last time I\nhad seen him. From a hale, and rather heavy man, gray-haired, but plump,\nand ruddy, he was altered to a shrunken, wizened, trembling, and almost\ndecrepit figure. Instead of curly and comely locks, grizzled indeed, but\nplentiful, he had only a few lank white hairs scattered and flattened\nupon his forehead. But the greatest change of all was in the expression\nof his eyes, which had been so keen, and restless, and bright, and\na little sarcastic. Bright indeed they still were, but with a slow\nunhealthy lustre; their keenness was turned to perpetual outlook, their\nrestlessness to a haggard want. As for the humour which once gleamed\nthere (which people who fear it call sarcasm) it had been succeeded by\nstares of terror, and then mistrust, and shrinking. There was none of\nthe interest in mankind, which is needful even for satire.\n\n\"Now what can this be?\" thought I to myself, \"has the old man lost all\nhis property, or taken too much to strong waters?\"\n\n\"Come inside, John Ridd,\" he said; \"I will have a talk with you. It is\ncold out here; and it is too light. Come inside, John Ridd, boy.\"\n\nI followed him into a little dark room, quite different from Ruth\nHuckaback's. It was closed from the shop by an old division of boarding,\nhung with tanned canvas; and the smell was very close and faint. Here\nthere was a ledger desk, and a couple of chairs, and a long-legged\nstool.\n\n\"Take the stool,\" said Uncle Reuben, showing me in very quietly, \"it is\nfitter for your height, John. Wait a moment; there is no hurry.\"\n\nThen he slipped out by another door, and closing it quickly after him,\ntold the foreman and waiting-men that the business of the day was done.\nThey had better all go home at once; and he would see to the fastenings.\nOf course they were only too glad to go; but I wondered at his sending\nthem, with at least two hours of daylight left.\n\nHowever, that was no business of mine, and I waited, and pondered\nwhether fair Ruth ever came into this dirty room, and if so, how she\nkept her hands from it. For Annie would have had it upside down in about\ntwo minutes, and scrubbed, and brushed, and dusted, until it looked\nquite another place; and yet all this done without scolding and\ncrossness; which are the curse of clean women, and ten times worse than\nthe dustiest dust.\n\nUncle Ben came reeling in, not from any power of liquor, but because he\nwas stiff from horseback, and weak from work and worry.\n\n\"Let me be, John, let me be,\" he said, as I went to help him; \"this is\nan unkind dreary place; but many a hundred of good gold Carolus has been\nturned in this place, John.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it, sir,\" I answered in my loud and cheerful manner;\n\"and many another hundred, sir; and may you long enjoy them!\"\n\n\"My boy, do you wish me to die?\" he asked, coming up close to my stool,\nand regarding me with a shrewd though blear-eyed gaze; \"many do. Do you,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said I, \"don't ask such nonsense. You know better than that,\nUncle Ben. Or else, I am sorry for you. I want you to live as long as\npossible, for the sake of--\" Here I stopped.\n\n\"For the sake of what, John? I knew it is not for my own sake. For the\nsake of what, my boy?\"\n\n\"For the sake of Ruth,\" I answered; \"if you must have all the truth. Who\nis to mind her when you are gone?\"\n\n\"But if you knew that I had gold, or a manner of getting gold, far more\nthan ever the sailors got out of the Spanish galleons, far more than\never was heard of; and the secret was to be yours, John; yours after me\nand no other soul's--then you would wish me dead, John.\" Here he eyed me\nas if a speck of dust in my eyes should not escape him.\n\n\"You are wrong, Uncle Ben; altogether wrong. For all the gold ever heard\nor dreamed of, not a wish would cross my heart to rob you of one day of\nlife.\"\n\nAt last he moved his eyes from mine; but without any word, or sign, to\nshow whether he believed, or disbelieved. Then he went to a chair, and\nsat with his chin upon the ledger-desk; as if the effort of probing me\nhad been too much for his weary brain. \"Dreamed of! All the gold ever\ndreamed of! As if it were but a dream!\" he muttered; and then he closed\nhis eyes to think.\n\n\"Good Uncle Reuben,\" I said to him, \"you have been a long way to-day,\nsir. Let me go and get you a glass of good wine. Cousin Ruth knows where\nto find it.\"\n\n\"How do you know how far I have been?\" he asked, with a vicious look\nat me. \"And Cousin Ruth! You are very pat with my granddaughter's name,\nyoung man!\"\n\n\"It would be hard upon me, sir, not to know my own cousin's name.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let that go by. You have behaved very badly to Ruth. She\nloves you; and you love her not.\"\n\nAt this I was so wholly amazed--not at the thing itself, I mean, but at\nhis knowledge of it--that I could not say a single word; but looked, no\ndoubt, very foolish.\n\n\"You may well be ashamed, young man,\" he cried, with some triumph over\nme, \"you are the biggest of all fools, as well as a conceited coxcomb.\nWhat can you want more than Ruth? She is a little damsel, truly; but\nfiner men than you, John Ridd, with all your boasted strength and\nwrestling, have wedded smaller maidens. And as for quality, and\nvalue--bots! one inch of Ruth is worth all your seven feet put\ntogether.\"\n\nNow I am not seven feet high; nor ever was six feet eight inches, in\nmy very prime of life; and nothing vexes me so much as to make me out a\ngiant, and above human sympathy, and human scale of weakness. It cost\nme hard to hold my tongue; which luckily is not in proportion to my\nstature. And only for Ruth's sake I held it. But Uncle Ben (being old\nand worn) was vexed by not having any answer, almost as much as a woman\nis.\n\n\"You want me to go on,\" he continued, with a look of spite at me, \"about\nmy poor Ruth's love for you, to feed your cursed vanity. Because a\nset of asses call you the finest man in England; there is no maid (I\nsuppose) who is not in love with you. I believe you are as deep as you\nare long, John Ridd. Shall I ever get to the bottom of your character?\"\n\nThis was a little too much for me. Any insult I could take (with\ngoodwill) from a white-haired man, and one who was my relative; unless\nit touched my love for Lorna, or my conscious modesty. Now both of\nthese were touched to the quick by the sentences of the old gentleman.\nTherefore, without a word, I went; only making a bow to him.\n\nBut women who are (beyond all doubt) the mothers of all mischief, also\nnurse that babe to sleep, when he is too noisy. And there was Ruth, as I\ntook my horse (with a trunk of frippery on him), poor little Ruth was\nat the bridle, and rusting all the knops of our town-going harness with\ntears.\n\n[Illustration: 531.jpg Little Ruth was at the bridle]\n\n\"Good-bye dear,\" I said, as she bent her head away from me; \"shall I put\nyou up on the saddle, dear?\"\n\n\"Cousin Ridd, you may take it lightly,\" said Ruth, turning full upon me,\n\"and very likely you are right, according to your nature\"--this was\nthe only cutting thing the little soul ever said to me--\"but oh, Cousin\nRidd, you have no idea of the pain you will leave behind you.\"\n\n\"How can that be so, Ruth, when I am as good as ordered to be off the\npremises?\"\n\n\"In the first place, Cousin Ridd, grandfather will be angry with\nhimself, for having so ill-used you. And now he is so weak and poorly,\nthat he is always repenting. In the next place I shall scold him first,\nuntil he admits his sorrow; and when he has admitted it, I shall scold\nmyself for scolding him. And then he will come round again, and think\nthat I was hard on him; and end perhaps by hating you--for he is like a\nwoman now, John.\"\n\nThat last little touch of self-knowledge in Ruth, which she delivered\nwith a gleam of some secret pleasantry, made me stop and look closely\nat her: but she pretended not to know it. \"There is something in this\nchild,\" I thought, \"very different from other girls. What it is I cannot\ntell; for one very seldom gets at it.\"\n\nAt any rate the upshot was that the good horse went back to stable, and\nhad another feed of corn, while my wrath sank within me. There are two\nthings, according to my experience (which may not hold with another man)\nfitted beyond any others to take hot tempers out of us. The first is\nto see our favourite creatures feeding, and licking up their food, and\nhappily snuffling over it, yet sparing time to be grateful, and showing\ntaste and perception; the other is to go gardening boldly, in the spring\nof the year, without any misgiving about it, and hoping the utmost of\neverything. If there be a third anodyne, approaching these two in power,\nit is to smoke good tobacco well, and watch the setting of the moon; and\nif this should only be over the sea, the result is irresistible.\n\nMaster Huckaback showed no especial signs of joy at my return; but\nreceived me with a little grunt, which appeared to me to mean, \"Ah, I\nthought he would hardly be fool enough to go.\" I told him how sorry I\nwas for having in some way offended him; and he answered that I did well\nto grieve for one at least of my offences. To this I made no reply, as\nbehoves a man dealing with cross and fractious people; and presently he\nbecame better-tempered, and sent little Ruth for a bottle of wine. She\ngave me a beautiful smile of thanks for my forbearance as she passed;\nand I knew by her manner that she would bring the best bottle in all the\ncellar.\n\nAs I had but little time to spare (although the days were long and\nlight) we were forced to take our wine with promptitude and rapidity;\nand whether this loosened my uncle's tongue, or whether he meant\nbeforehand to speak, is now almost uncertain. But true it is that he\nbrought his chair very near to mine, after three or four glasses, and\nsent Ruth away upon some errand which seemed of small importance. At\nthis I was vexed, for the room always looked so different without her.\n\n\"Come, Jack,\" he said, \"here's your health, young fellow, and a good and\nobedient wife to you. Not that your wife will ever obey you though; you\nare much too easy-tempered. Even a bitter and stormy woman might live\nin peace with you, Jack. But never you give her the chance to try. Marry\nsome sweet little thing, if you can. If not, don't marry any. Ah, we\nhave the maid to suit you, my lad, in this old town of Dulverton.\"\n\n\"Have you so, sir? But perhaps the maid might have no desire to suit\nme.\"\n\n\"That you may take my word she has. The colour of this wine will prove\nit. The little sly hussy has been to the cobwebbed arch of the cellar,\nwhere she has no right to go, for any one under a magistrate. However,\nI am glad to see it, and we will not spare it, John. After my time,\nsomebody, whoever marries little Ruth, will find some rare wines there,\nI trow, and perhaps not know the difference.\"\n\nThinking of this the old man sighed, and expected me to sigh after him.\nBut a sigh is not (like a yawn) infectious; and we are all more prone\nto be sent to sleep than to sorrow by one another. Not but what a sigh\nsometimes may make us think of sighing.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" cried I, in my sprightliest manner, which rouses up most\npeople, \"here's to your health and dear little Ruth's: and may you live\nto knock off the cobwebs from every bottle in under the arch. Uncle\nReuben, your life and health, sir?\"\n\nWith that I took my glass thoughtfully, for it was wondrous good; and\nUncle Ben was pleased to see me dwelling pleasantly on the subject with\nparenthesis, and self-commune, and oral judgment unpronounced, though\nsmacking of fine decision. \"_Curia vult advisari_,\" as the lawyers say;\nwhich means, \"Let us have another glass, and then we can think about\nit.\"\n\n\"Come now, John,\" said Uncle Ben, laying his wrinkled hand on my knee,\nwhen he saw that none could heed us, \"I know that you have a sneaking\nfondness for my grandchild Ruth. Don't interrupt me now; you have; and\nto deny it will only provoke me.\"\n\n\"I do like Ruth, sir,\" I said boldly, for fear of misunderstanding; \"but\nI do not love her.\"\n\n\"Very well; that makes no difference. Liking may very soon be loving (as\nsome people call it) when the maid has money to help her.\"\n\n\"But if there be, as there is in my case--\"\n\n\"Once for all, John, not a word. I do not attempt to lead you into any\nengagement with little Ruth; neither will I blame you (though I may be\ndisappointed) if no such engagement should ever be. But whether you will\nhave my grandchild, or whether you will not--and such a chance is\nrarely offered to a fellow of your standing\"--Uncle Ben despised all\nfarmers--\"in any case I have at least resolved to let you know my\nsecret; and for two good reasons. The first is that it wears me out\nto dwell upon it, all alone, and the second is that I can trust you to\nfulfil a promise. Moreover, you are my next of kin, except among\nthe womankind; and you are just the man I want, to help me in my\nenterprise.\"\n\n\"And I will help you, sir,\" I answered, fearing some conspiracy, \"in\nanything that is true, and loyal, and according to the laws of the\nrealm.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" cried the old man, laughing until his eyes ran over, and\nspreading out his skinny hands upon his shining breeches, \"thou hast\ngone the same fools' track as the rest; even as spy Stickles went, and\nall his precious troopers. Landing of arms at Glenthorne, and Lynmouth,\nwagons escorted across the moor, sounds of metal and booming noises!\nAh, but we managed it cleverly, to cheat even those so near to\nus. Disaffection at Taunton, signs of insurrection at Dulverton,\nrevolutionary tanner at Dunster! We set it all abroad, right well. And\nnot even you to suspect our work; though we thought at one time that you\nwatched us. Now who, do you suppose, is at the bottom of all this Exmoor\ninsurgency, all this western rebellion--not that I say there is none,\nmind--but who is at the bottom of it?\"\n\n\"Either Mother Melldrum,\" said I, being now a little angry, \"or else old\nNick himself.\"\n\n\"Nay, old Uncle Reuben!\" Saying this, Master Huckaback cast back his\ncoat, and stood up, and made the most of himself.\n\n[Illustration: 534.jpg Master Huckaback cast back his coat]\n\n\"Well!\" cried I, being now quite come to the limits of my intellect,\n\"then, after all, Captain Stickles was right in calling you a rebel,\nsir!\"\n\n\"Of course he was; could so keen a man be wrong about an old fool like\nme? But come, and see our rebellion, John. I will trust you now with\neverything. I will take no oath from you; only your word to keep\nsilence; and most of all from your mother.\"\n\n\"I will give you my word,\" I said, although liking not such pledges;\nwhich make a man think before he speaks in ordinary company, against\nhis usual practices. However, I was now so curious, that I thought of\nnothing else; and scarcely could believe at all that Uncle Ben was quite\nright in his head.\n\n\"Take another glass of wine, my son,\" he cried with a cheerful\ncountenance, which made him look more than ten years younger; \"you shall\ncome into partnership with me: your strength will save us two horses,\nand we always fear the horse work. Come and see our rebellion, my boy;\nyou are a made man from to-night.\"\n\n\"But where am I to come and see it? Where am I to find it, sir?\"\n\n\"Meet me,\" he answered, yet closing his hands, and wrinkling with\ndoubt his forehead, \"come alone, of course; and meet me at the Wizard's\nSlough, at ten to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\nMASTER HUCKABACK'S SECRET\n\n[Illustration: 535.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nKnowing Master Huckaback to be a man of his word, as well as one who\nwould have others so, I was careful to be in good time the next morning,\nby the side of the Wizard's Slough. I am free to admit that the name of\nthe place bore a feeling of uneasiness, and a love of distance, in some\nmeasure to my heart. But I did my best not to think of this; only I\nthought it a wise precaution, and due for the sake of my mother and\nLorna, to load my gun with a dozen slugs made from the lead of the old\nchurch-porch, laid by, long since, against witchcraft.\n\nI am well aware that some people now begin to doubt about witchcraft; or\nat any rate feign to do so; being desirous to disbelieve whatever they\nare afraid of. This spirit is growing too common among us, and will end\n(unless we put a stop to it!) in the destruction of all religion. And\nas regards witchcraft, a man is bound either to believe in it, or to\ndisbelieve the Bible. For even in the New Testament, discarding many\nthings of the Old, such as sacrifices, and Sabbath, and fasting, and\nother miseries, witchcraft is clearly spoken of as a thing that\nmust continue; that the Evil One be not utterly robbed of his vested\ninterests. Hence let no one tell me that witchcraft is done away with;\nfor I will meet him with St. Paul, than whom no better man, and few less\nsuperstitious, can be found in all the Bible.\n\nFeeling these things more in those days than I feel them now, I fetched\na goodish compass round, by the way of the cloven rocks, rather than\ncross Black Barrow Down, in a reckless and unholy manner. There were\nseveral spots, upon that Down, cursed and smitten, and blasted, as if\nthunderbolts had fallen there, and Satan sat to keep them warm. At any\nrate it was good (as every one acknowledged) not to wander there too\nmuch; even with a doctor of divinity on one arm and of medicine upon the\nother.\n\nTherefore, I, being all alone, and on foot (as seemed the wisest),\npreferred a course of roundabout; and starting about eight o'clock,\nwithout mentioning my business, arrived at the mouth of the deep\ndescent, such as John Fry described it. Now this (though I have not\nspoken of it) was not my first time of being there. For, although I\ncould not bring myself to spy upon Uncle Reuben, as John Fry had done,\nyet I thought it no ill manners, after he had left our house, to have a\nlook at the famous place, where the malefactor came to life, at least\nin John's opinion. At that time, however, I saw nothing except the great\nugly black morass, with the grisly reeds around it; and I did not care\nto go very near it, much less to pry on the further side.\n\nNow, on the other hand, I was bent to get at the very bottom of this\nmystery (if there were any), having less fear of witch or wizard, with\na man of Uncle Reuben's wealth to take my part, and see me through. So\nI rattled the ramrod down my gun, just to know if the charge were right,\nafter so much walking; and finding it full six inches deep, as I like to\nhave it, went boldly down the steep gorge of rock, with a firm resolve\nto shoot any witch unless it were good Mother Melldrum. Nevertheless to\nmy surprise, all was quiet, and fair to look at, in the decline of\nthe narrow way, with great stalked ferns coming forth like trees, yet\nhanging like cobwebs over one. And along one side, a little spring was\ngetting rid of its waters. Any man might stop and think; or he might\ngo on and think; and in either case, there was none to say that he was\nmaking a fool of himself.\n\nWhen I came to the foot of this ravine, and over against the great black\nslough, there was no sign of Master Huckaback, nor of any other living\nman, except myself, in the silence. Therefore, I sat in a niche of rock,\ngazing at the slough, and pondering the old tradition about it.\n\nThey say that, in the ancient times, a mighty necromancer lived in the\nwilderness of Exmoor. Here, by spell and incantation, he built himself\na strong high palace, eight-sided like a spider's web, and standing on\na central steep; so that neither man nor beast could cross the moors\nwithout his knowledge. If he wished to rob and slay a traveller, or to\nhave wild ox, or stag for food, he had nothing more to do than sit at\none of his eight windows, and point his unholy book at him. Any moving\ncreature, at which that book was pointed, must obey the call, and come\nfrom whatever distance, if sighted once by the wizard.\n\nThis was a bad condition of things, and all the country groaned under\nit; and Exmoor (although the most honest place that a man could wish\nto live in) was beginning to get a bad reputation, and all through that\nvile wizard. No man durst even go to steal a sheep, or a pony, or so\nmuch as a deer for dinner, lest he should be brought to book by a far\nbigger rogue than he was. And this went on for many years; though they\nprayed to God to abate it. But at last, when the wizard was getting fat\nand haughty upon his high stomach, a mighty deliverance came to Exmoor,\nand a warning, and a memory. For one day the sorcerer gazed from his\nwindow facing the southeast of the compass, and he yawned, having killed\nso many men that now he was weary of it.\n\n\"Ifackins,\" he cried, or some such oath, both profane and uncomely,\n\"I see a man on the verge of the sky-line, going along laboriously. A\npilgrim, I trow, or some such fool, with the nails of his boots inside\nthem. Too thin to be worth eating; but I will have him for the fun of\nthe thing; and most of those saints have got money.\"\n\nWith these words he stretched forth his legs on a stool, and pointed\nthe book of heathenish spells back upwards at the pilgrim. Now this good\npilgrim was plodding along, soberly and religiously, with a pound of\nflints in either boot, and not an ounce of meat inside him. He felt the\nspell of the wicked book, but only as a horse might feel a \"gee-wug!\"\naddressed to him. It was in the power of this good man, either to go\non, or turn aside, and see out the wizard's meaning. And for a moment he\nhalted and stood, like one in two minds about a thing. Then the wizard\nclapped one cover to, in a jocular and insulting manner; and the sound\nof it came to the pilgrim's ear, about five miles in the distance, like\na great gun fired at him.\n\n\"By our Lady,\" he cried, \"I must see to this; although my poor feet have\nno skin below them. I will teach this heathen miscreant how to scoff at\nGlastonbury.\"\n\nThereupon he turned his course, and ploughed along through the moors\nand bogs, towards the eight-sided palace. The wizard sat on his chair of\ncomfort, and with the rankest contempt observed the holy man ploughing\ntowards him. \"He has something good in his wallet, I trow,\" said the\nblack thief to himself; \"these fellows get always the pick of the wine,\nand the best of a woman's money.\" Then he cried, \"Come in, come in, good\nsir,\" as he always did to every one.\n\n\"Bad sir, I will not come in,\" said the pilgrim; \"neither shall you come\nout again. Here are the bones of all you have slain; and here shall your\nown bones be.\"\n\n\"Hurry me not,\" cried the sorcerer; \"that is a thing to think about. How\nmany miles hast thou travelled this day?\"\n\nBut the pilgrim was too wide awake, for if he had spoken of any number,\nbearing no cross upon it, the necromancer would have had him, like a\nball at bando-play. Therefore he answered, as truly as need be, \"By the\ngrace of our Lady, nine.\"\n\nNow nine is the crossest of all cross numbers, and full to the lip of\nall crochets. So the wizard staggered back, and thought, and inquired\nagain with bravery, \"Where can you find a man and wife, one going\nup-hill and one going down, and not a word spoken between them?\"\n\n\"In a cucumber plant,\" said the modest saint; blushing even to think of\nit; and the wizard knew he was done for.\n\n\"You have tried me with ungodly questions,\" continued the honest\npilgrim, with one hand still over his eyes, as he thought of the\nfeminine cucumber; \"and now I will ask you a pure one. To whom of\nmankind have you ever done good, since God saw fit to make you?\"\n\nThe wizard thought, but could quote no one; and he looked at the saint,\nand the saint at him, and both their hearts were trembling. \"Can you\nmention only one?\" asked the saint, pointing a piece of the true cross\nat him, hoping he might cling to it; \"even a little child will do; try\nto think of some one.\"\n\nThe earth was rocking beneath their feet, and the palace windows\ndarkened on them, with a tint of blood, for now the saint was come\ninside, hoping to save the wizard.\n\n\"If I must tell the pure truth,\" said the wizard, looking up at the\narches of his windows, \"I can tell of only one to whom I ever have done\ngood.\"\n\n\"One will do; one is quite enough; be quick before the ground opens. The\nname of one--and this cross will save you. Lay your thumb on the end of\nit.\"\n\n\"Nay, that I cannot do, great saint. The devil have mercy upon me.\"\n\nAll this while the palace was sinking, and blackness coming over them.\n\n\"Thou hast all but done for thyself,\" said the saint, with a glory\nburning round his head; \"by that last invocation. Yet give us the name\nof the one, my friend, if one there be; it will save thee, with the\ncross upon thy breast. All is crashing round us; dear brother, who is\nthat one?\"\n\n\"My own self,\" cried the wretched wizard.\n\n\"Then there is no help for thee.\" And with that the honest saint went\nupward, and the wizard, and all his palace, and even the crag that bore\nit, sank to the bowels of the earth; and over them was nothing left\nexcept a black bog fringed with reed, of the tint of the wizard's\nwhiskers. The saint, however, was all right, after sleeping off the\nexcitement; and he founded a chapel, some three miles westward; and\nthere he lies with his holy relic and thither in after ages came (as\nwe all come home at last) both my Lorna's Aunt Sabina, and her guardian\nEnsor Doone.\n\nWhile yet I dwelled upon this strange story, wondering if it all were\ntrue, and why such things do not happen now, a man on horseback appeared\nas suddenly as if he had risen out of the earth, on the other side of\nthe great black slough. At first I was a little scared, my mind being\nin the tune for wonders; but presently the white hair, whiter from the\nblackness of the bog between us, showed me that it was Uncle Reuben come\nto look for me, that way. Then I left my chair of rock, and waved my hat\nand shouted to him, and the sound of my voice among the crags and lonely\ncorners frightened me.\n\nOld Master Huckaback made no answer, but (so far as I could guess)\nbeckoned me to come to him. There was just room between the fringe of\nreed and the belt of rock around it, for a man going very carefully to\nescape that horrible pit-hole. And so I went round to the other side,\nand there found open space enough, with stunted bushes, and starveling\ntrees, and straggling tufts of rushes.\n\n\"You fool, you are frightened,\" said Uncle Ben, as he looked at my face\nafter shaking hands: \"I want a young man of steadfast courage, as well\nas of strength and silence. And after what I heard of the battle at Glen\nDoone, I thought I might trust you for courage.\"\n\n\"So you may,\" said I, \"wherever I see mine enemy; but not where witch\nand wizard be.\"\n\n\"Tush, great fool!\" cried Master Huckaback; \"the only witch or wizard\nhere is the one that bewitcheth all men. Now fasten up my horse, John\nRidd, and not too near the slough, lad. Ah, we have chosen our entrance\nwisely. Two good horsemen, and their horses, coming hither to spy us\nout, are gone mining on their own account (and their last account it is)\ndown this good wizard's bog-hole.\"\n\nWith these words, Uncle Reuben clutched the mane of his horse and came\ndown, as a man does when his legs are old; and as I myself begin to do,\nat this time of writing. I offered a hand, but he was vexed, and would\nhave nought to do with it.\n\n\"Now follow me, step for step,\" he said, when I had tethered his horse\nto a tree; \"the ground is not death (like the wizard's hole), but many\nparts are treacherous, I know it well by this time.\"\n\nWithout any more ado, he led me in and out the marshy places, to a great\nround hole or shaft, bratticed up with timber. I never had seen the like\nbefore, and wondered how they could want a well, with so much water on\nevery side. Around the mouth were a few little heaps of stuff unused to\nthe daylight; and I thought at once of the tales I had heard concerning\nmines in Cornwall, and the silver cup at Combe-Martin, sent to the Queen\nElizabeth.\n\n[Illustration: 541.jpg Never had seen the like before]\n\n\"We had a tree across it, John,\" said Uncle Reuben, smiling grimly at my\nsudden shrink from it: \"but some rogue came spying here, just as one of\nour men went up. He was frightened half out of his life, I believe, and\nnever ventured to come again. But we put the blame of that upon you. And\nI see that we were wrong, John.\" Here he looked at me with keen eyes,\nthough weak.\n\n\"You were altogether wrong,\" I answered. \"Am I mean enough to spy upon\nany one dwelling with us? And more than that, Uncle Reuben, it was mean\nof you to suppose it.\"\n\n\"All ideas are different,\" replied the old man to my heat, like a little\nworn-out rill running down a smithy; \"you with your strength and youth,\nand all that, are inclined to be romantic. I take things as I have known\nthem, going on for seventy years. Now will you come and meet the wizard,\nor does your courage fail you?\"\n\n\"My courage must be none,\" said I, \"if I would not go where you go,\nsir.\"\n\nHe said no more, but signed to me to lift a heavy wooden corb with an\niron loop across it, and sunk in a little pit of earth, a yard or so\nfrom the mouth of the shaft. I raised it, and by his direction dropped\nit into the throat of the shaft, where it hung and shook from a great\ncross-beam laid at the level of the earth. A very stout thick rope was\nfastened to the handle of the corb, and ran across a pulley hanging from\nthe centre of the beam, and thence out of sight in the nether places.\n\n\"I will first descend,\" he said; \"your weight is too great for safety.\nWhen the bucket comes up again, follow me, if your heart is good.\"\n\nThen he whistled down, with a quick sharp noise, and a whistle from\nbelow replied; and he clomb into the vehicle, and the rope ran through\nthe pulley, and Uncle Ben went merrily down, and was out of sight,\nbefore I had time to think of him.\n\nNow being left on the bank like that, and in full sight of the goodly\nheaven, I wrestled hard with my flesh and blood, about going down\ninto the pit-hole. And but for the pale shame of the thing, that a\nwhite-headed man should adventure so, and green youth doubt about\nit, never could I have made up my mind; for I do love air and heaven.\nHowever, at last up came the bucket; and with a short sad prayer I went\ninto whatever might happen.\n\nMy teeth would chatter, do all I could; but the strength of my arms was\nwith me; and by them I held on the grimy rope, and so eased the foot\nof the corb, which threatened to go away fathoms under me. Of course I\nshould still have been safe enough, being like an egg in an egg-cup, too\nbig to care for the bottom; still I wished that all should be done, in\ngood order, without excitement.\n\nThe scoopings of the side grew black, and the patch of sky above more\nblue, as with many thoughts of Lorna, a long way underground I sank.\nThen I was fetched up at the bottom with a jerk and rattle; and but for\nholding by the rope so, must have tumbled over. Two great torches of\nbale-resin showed me all the darkness, one being held by Uncle Ben and\nthe other by a short square man with a face which seemed well-known to\nme.\n\n\"Hail to the world of gold, John Ridd,\" said Master Huckaback, smiling\nin the old dry manner; \"bigger coward never came down the shaft, now did\nhe, Carfax?\"\n\n\"They be all alike,\" said the short square man, \"fust time as they doos\nit.\"\n\n\"May I go to heaven,\" I cried, \"which is a thing quite out of\nsight\"--for I always have a vein of humour, too small to be followed\nby any one--\"if ever again of my own accord I go so far away from it!\"\nUncle Ben grinned less at this than at the way I knocked my shin in\ngetting out of the bucket; and as for Master Carfax, he would not\neven deign to smile. And he seemed to look upon my entrance as an\ninterloping.\n\nFor my part, I had nought to do, after rubbing my bruised leg, except to\nlook about me, so far as the dullness of light would help. And herein I\nseemed, like a mouse in a trap, able no more than to run to and fro,\nand knock himself, and stare at things. For here was a little channel\ngrooved with posts on either side of it, and ending with a heap of\ndarkness, whence the sight came back again; and there was a scooped\nplace, like a funnel, but pouring only to darkness. So I waited for\nsomebody to speak first, not seeing my way to anything.\n\n\"You seem to be disappointed, John,\" said Uncle Reuben, looking blue by\nthe light of the flambeaux; \"did you expect to see the roof of gold, and\nthe sides of gold, and the floor of gold, John Ridd?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" cried Master Carfax; \"I reckon her did; no doubt her did.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" I replied; \"but I did expect to see something better\nthan dirt and darkness.\"\n\n\"Come on then, my lad; and we will show you some-thing better. We want\nyour great arm on here, for a job that has beaten the whole of us.\"\n\nWith these words, Uncle Ben led the way along a narrow passage, roofed\nwith rock and floored with slate-coloured shale and shingle, and winding\nin and out, until we stopped at a great stone block or boulder, lying\nacross the floor, and as large as my mother's best oaken wardrobe.\nBeside it were several sledge-hammers, battered, and some with broken\nhelves.\n\n\"Thou great villain!\" cried Uncle Ben, giving the boulder a little kick;\n\"I believe thy time is come at last. Now, John, give us a sample of the\nthings they tell of thee. Take the biggest of them sledge-hammers and\ncrack this rogue in two for us. We have tried at him for a fortnight,\nand he is a nut worth cracking. But we have no man who can swing that\nhammer, though all in the mine have handled it.\"\n\n\"I will do my very best,\" said I, pulling off my coat and waistcoat, as\nif I were going to wrestle; \"but I fear he will prove too tough for me.\"\n\n\"Ay, that her wull,\" grunted Master Carfax; \"lack'th a Carnishman, and\na beg one too, not a little charp such as I be. There be no man outside\nCarnwall, as can crack that boolder.\"\n\n\"Bless my heart,\" I answered; \"but I know something of you, my friend,\nor at any rate of your family. Well, I have beaten most of your Cornish\nmen, though not my place to talk of it. But mind, if I crack this rock\nfor you, I must have some of the gold inside it.\"\n\n\"Dost think to see the gold come tumbling out like the kernel of a nut,\nthou zany?\" asked Uncle Reuben pettishly; \"now wilt thou crack it or\nwilt thou not? For I believe thou canst do it, though only a lad of\nSomerset.\"\n\nUncle Reuben showed by saying this, and by his glance at Carfax, that he\nwas proud of his county, and would be disappointed for it if I failed to\ncrack the boulder. So I begged him to stoop his torch a little, that\nI might examine my subject. To me there appeared to be nothing at all\nremarkable about it, except that it sparkled here and there, when the\nflash of the flame fell upon it. A great obstinate, oblong, sullen\nstone; how could it be worth the breaking, except for making roads with?\n\nNevertheless, I took up the hammer, and swinging it far behind my head,\nfetched it down, with all my power, upon the middle of the rock. The\nroof above rang mightily, and the echo went down delven galleries, so\nthat all the miners flocked to know what might be doing. But Master\nCarfax only smiled, although the blow shook him where he stood, for\nbehold the stone was still unbroken, and as firm as ever. Then I smote\nit again, with no better fortune, and Uncle Ben looked vexed and angry,\nbut all the miners grinned with triumph.\n\n\"This little tool is too light,\" I cried; \"one of you give me a piece of\nstrong cord.\"\n\nThen I took two more of the weightiest hammers, and lashed them fast to\nthe back of mine, not so as to strike, but to burden the fall. Having\nmade this firm, and with room to grasp the handle of the largest one\nonly--for the helves of the others were shorter--I smiled at Uncle Ben,\nand whirled the mighty implement round my head, just to try whether I\ncould manage it. Upon that the miners gave a cheer, being honest men,\nand desirous of seeing fair play between this \"shameless stone\" (as Dan\nHomer calls it) and me with my hammer hammering.\n\nThen I swung me on high to the swing of the sledge, as a thresher\nbends back to the rise of his flail, and with all my power descending\ndelivered the ponderous onset. Crashing and crushed the great stone fell\nover, and threads of sparkling gold appeared in the jagged sides of the\nbreakage.\n\n[Illustration: 544.jpg Swung me on high]\n\n\"How now, Simon Carfax?\" cried Uncle Ben triumphantly; \"wilt thou find a\nman in Cornwall can do the like of that?\"\n\n\"Ay, and more,\" he answered; \"however, it be pretty fair for a lad of\nthese outlandish parts. Get your rollers, my lads, and lead it to the\ncrushing engine.\"\n\nI was glad to have been of some service to them; for it seems that this\ngreat boulder had been too large to be drawn along the gallery and too\nhard to crack. But now they moved it very easily, taking piece by piece,\nand carefully picking up the fragments.\n\n\"Thou hast done us a good turn, my lad,\" said Uncle Reuben, as the\nothers passed out of sight at the corner; \"and now I will show thee the\nbottom of a very wondrous mystery. But we must not do it more than once,\nfor the time of day is the wrong one.\"\n\nThe whole affair being a mystery to me, and far beyond my understanding,\nI followed him softly, without a word, yet thinking very heavily, and\nlonging to be above ground again. He led me through small passages, to a\nhollow place near the descending shaft, where I saw a most extraordinary\nmonster fitted up. In form it was like a great coffee-mill, such as\nI had seen in London, only a thousand times larger, and with heavy\nwindlass to work it.\n\n\"Put in a barrow-load of the smoulder,\" said Uncle Ben to Carfax, \"and\nlet them work the crank, for John to understand a thing or two.\"\n\n\"At this time of day!\" cried Simon Carfax; \"and the watching as has been\no' late!\"\n\nHowever, he did it without more remonstrance; pouring into the scuttle\nat the top of the machine about a basketful of broken rock; and then a\ndozen men went to the wheel, and forced it round, as sailors do. Upon\nthat such a hideous noise arose, as I never should have believed any\ncreature capable of making, and I ran to the well of the mine for air,\nand to ease my ears, if possible.\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" shouted Uncle Ben by the time I was nearly deafened;\n\"we will digest our goodly boulder after the devil is come abroad for\nhis evening work. Now, John, not a word about what you have learned; but\nhenceforth you will not be frightened by the noise we make at dusk.\"\n\nI could not deny but what this was very clever management. If they could\nnot keep the echoes of the upper air from moving, the wisest plan was to\nopen their valves during the discouragement of the falling evening;\nwhen folk would rather be driven away, than drawn into the wilds and\nquagmires, by a sound so deep and awful, coming through the darkness.\n\n[Illustration: 546.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\nLORNA GONE AWAY\n\n[Illustration: 547.jpg Wizard]\n\nAlthough there are very ancient tales of gold being found upon Exmoor,\nin lumps and solid hummocks, and of men who slew one another for it,\nthis deep digging and great labour seemed to me a dangerous and unholy\nenterprise. And Master Huckaback confessed that up to the present time\nhis two partners and himself (for they proved to be three adventurers)\nhad put into the earth more gold than they had taken out of it.\nNevertheless he felt quite sure that it must in a very short time\nsucceed, and pay them back an hundredfold; and he pressed me with great\nearnestness to join them, and work there as much as I could, without\nmoving my mother's suspicions. I asked him how they had managed so long\nto carry on without discovery; and he said that this was partly through\nthe wildness of the neighbourhood, and the legends that frightened\npeople of a superstitious turn; partly through their own great caution,\nand the manner of fetching both supplies and implements by night;\nbut most of all, they had to thank the troubles of the period, the\nsuspicions of rebellion, and the terror of the Doones, which (like the\nwizard I was speaking of) kept folk from being too inquisitive where\nthey had no business. The slough, moreover, had helped them well,\nboth by making their access dark, and yet more by swallowing up and\nconcealing all that was cast from the mouth of the pit. Once, before\nthe attack on Glen Doone, they had a narrow escape from the King's\nCommissioner; for Captain Stickles having heard no doubt the story of\nJohn Fry, went with half a dozen troopers, on purpose to search the\nneighbourhood. Now if he had ridden alone, most likely he would have\ndiscovered everything; but he feared to venture so, having suspicion of\na trap. Coming as they did in a company, all mounted and conspicuous,\nthe watchman (who was posted now on the top of the hill, almost every\nday since John Fry's appearance) could not help espying them, miles\ndistant, over the moorland. He watched them under the shade of his hand,\nand presently ran down the hill, and raised a great commotion. Then\nSimon Carfax and all his men came up, and made things natural, removing\nevery sign of work; and finally, sinking underground, drew across the\nmouth of the pit a hurdle thatched with sedge and heather. Only Simon\nhimself was left behind, ensconced in a hole of the crags, to observe\nthe doings of the enemy.\n\nCaptain Stickles rode very bravely, with all his men clattering after\nhim, down the rocky pass, and even to the margin of the slough. And\nthere they stopped, and held council; for it was a perilous thing to\nrisk the passage upon horseback, between the treacherous brink and\nthe cliff, unless one knew it thoroughly. Stickles, however, and one\nfollower, carefully felt the way along, having their horses well in\nhand, and bearing a rope to draw them out, in case of being foundered.\nThen they spurred across the rough boggy land, farther away than the\nshaft was. Here the ground lay jagged and shaggy, wrought up with high\ntufts of reed, or scragged with stunted brushwood. And between the ups\nand downs (which met anybody anyhow) green-covered places tempted the\nfoot, and black bog-holes discouraged it. It is not to be marvelled at\nthat amid such place as this, for the first time visited, the horses\nwere a little skeary; and their riders partook of the feeling, as all\ngood riders do. In and out of the tufts they went, with their eyes\ndilating, wishing to be out of harm, if conscience were but satisfied.\nAnd of this tufty flaggy ground, pocked with bogs and boglets, one\nespecial nature is that it will not hold impressions.\n\nSeeing thus no track of men, nor anything but marsh-work, and stormwork,\nand of the seasons, these two honest men rode back, and were glad to do\nso. For above them hung the mountains, cowled with fog, and seamed with\nstorm; and around them desolation; and below their feet the grave. Hence\nthey went, with all goodwill; and vowed for ever afterwards that fear of\na simple place like that was only too ridiculous. So they all rode\nhome with mutual praises, and their courage well-approved; and the only\nresult of the expedition was to confirm John Fry's repute as a bigger\nliar than ever.\n\nNow I had enough of that underground work, as before related, to last me\nfor a year to come; neither would I, for sake of gold, have ever stepped\ninto that bucket, of my own goodwill again. But when I told Lorna--whom\nI could trust in any matter of secrecy, as if she had never been a\nwoman--all about my great descent, and the honeycombing of the earth,\nand the mournful noise at eventide, when the gold was under the crusher\nand bewailing the mischief it must do, then Lorna's chief desire was to\nknow more about Simon Carfax.\n\n\"It must be our Gwenny's father,\" she cried; \"the man who disappeared\nunderground, and whom she has ever been seeking. How grieved the poor\nlittle thing will be, if it should turn out, after all, that he left his\nchild on purpose! I can hardly believe it; can you, John?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied; \"all men are wicked, more or less, to some extent;\nand no man may say otherwise.\"\n\nFor I did not wish to commit myself to an opinion about Simon, lest I\nmight be wrong, and Lorna think less of my judgment.\n\nBut being resolved to see this out, and do a good turn, if I could, to\nGwenny, who had done me many a good one, I begged my Lorna to say not a\nword of this matter to the handmaiden, until I had further searched\nit out. And to carry out this resolve, I went again to the place of\nbusiness where they were grinding gold as freely as an apothecary at his\npills.\n\nHaving now true right of entrance, and being known to the watchman, and\nregarded (since I cracked the boulder) as one who could pay his footing,\nand perhaps would be the master, when Uncle Ben should be choked with\nmoney, I found the corb sent up for me rather sooner than I wished it.\nFor the smell of the places underground, and the way men's eyes came out\nof them, with links, and brands, and flambeaux, instead of God's light\nto look at, were to me a point of caution, rather than of pleasure.\n\nNo doubt but what some men enjoy it, being born, like worms, to dig, and\nto live in their own scoopings. Yet even the worms come up sometimes,\nafter a good soft shower of rain, and hold discourse with one another;\nwhereas these men, and the horses let down, come above ground never.\n\nAnd the changing of the sky is half the change our nature calls for.\nEarth we have, and all its produce (moving from the first appearance,\nand the hope with infants' eyes, through the bloom of beauty's promise,\nto the rich and ripe fulfilment, and the falling back to rest); sea we\nhave (with all its wonder shed on eyes, and ears, and heart; and the\nthought of something more)--but without the sky to look at, what would\nearth, and sea, and even our own selves, be to us?\n\nDo we look at earth with hope? Yes, for victuals only. Do we look at\nsea with hope? Yes, that we may escape it. At the sky alone (though\nquestioned with the doubts of sunshine, or scattered with uncertain\nstars), at the sky alone we look with pure hope and with memory.\n\nHence it always hurt my feelings when I got into that bucket, with my\nsmall-clothes turned up over, and a kerchief round my hat. But knowing\nthat my purpose was sound, and my motives pure, I let the sky grow to\na little blue hole, and then to nothing over me. At the bottom Master\nCarfax met me, being captain of the mine, and desirous to know my\nbusiness. He wore a loose sack round his shoulders, and his beard was\ntwo feet long.\n\n\"My business is to speak with you,\" I answered rather sternly; for\nthis man, who was nothing more than Uncle Reuben's servant, had carried\nthings too far with me, showing no respect whatever; and though I did\nnot care for much, I liked to receive a little, even in my early days.\n\n\"Coom into the muck-hole, then,\" was his gracious answer; and he led me\ninto a filthy cell, where the miners changed their jackets.\n\n\"Simon Carfax,\" I began, with a manner to discourage him; \"I fear you are\na shallow fellow, and not worth my trouble.\"\n\n\"Then don't take it,\" he replied; \"I want no man's trouble.\"\n\n\"For your sake I would not,\" I answered; \"but for your daughter's sake\nI will; the daughter whom you left to starve so pitifully in the\nwilderness.\"\n\nThe man stared at me with his pale gray eyes, whose colour was lost from\ncandle light; and his voice as well as his body shook, while he cried,--\n\n\"It is a lie, man. No daughter, and no son have I. Nor was ever child of\nmine left to starve in the wilderness. You are too big for me to tackle,\nand that makes you a coward for saying it.\" His hands were playing with\na pickaxe helve, as if he longed to have me under it.\n\n\"Perhaps I have wronged you, Simon,\" I answered very softly; for the\nsweat upon his forehead shone in the smoky torchlight; \"if I have, I\ncrave your pardon. But did you not bring up from Cornwall a little maid\nnamed 'Gwenny,' and supposed to be your daughter?\"\n\n\"Ay, and she was my daughter, my last and only child of five; and for\nher I would give this mine, and all the gold will ever come from it.\"\n\n\"You shall have her, without either mine or gold; if you only prove to\nme that you did not abandon her.\"\n\n\"Abandon her! I abandon Gwenny!\" He cried with such a rage of scorn,\nthat I at once believed him. \"They told me she was dead, and crushed,\nand buried in the drift here; and half my heart died with her. The\nAlmighty blast their mining-work, if the scoundrels lied to me!\"\n\n\"The scoundrels must have lied to you,\" I answered, with a spirit fired\nby his heat of fury: \"the maid is living and with us. Come up; and you\nshall see her.\"\n\n\"Rig the bucket,\" he shouted out along the echoing gallery; and then he\nfell against the wall, and through the grimy sack I saw the heaving of\nhis breast, as I have seen my opponent's chest, in a long hard bout of\nwrestling. For my part, I could do no more than hold my tongue and look\nat him.\n\nWithout another word we rose to the level of the moors and mires;\nneither would Master Carfax speak, as I led him across the barrows. In\nthis he was welcome to his own way, for I do love silence; so little\nharm can come of it. And though Gwenny was no beauty, her father might\nbe fond of her.\n\nSo I put him in the cow-house (not to frighten the little maid), and\nthe folding shutters over him, such as we used at the beestings; and he\nlistened to my voice outside, and held on, and preserved himself. For\nnow he would have scooped the earth, as cattle do at yearning-time, and\nas meekly and as patiently, to have his child restored to him. Not to\nmake long tale of it--for this thing is beyond me, through want of true\nexperience--I went and fetched his Gwenny forth from the back kitchen,\nwhere she was fighting, as usual, with our Betty.\n\n\"Come along, you little Vick,\" I said, for so we called her; \"I have a\nmessage to you, Gwenny, from the Lord in heaven.\"\n\n\"Don't 'ee talk about He,\" she answered; \"Her have long forgatten me.\"\n\n\"That He has never done, you stupid. Come, and see who is in the\ncowhouse.\"\n\nGwenny knew; she knew in a moment. Looking into my eyes, she knew; and\nhanging back from me to sigh, she knew it even better.\n\nShe had not much elegance of emotion, being flat and square all over;\nbut none the less for that her heart came quick, and her words came\nslowly.\n\n\"Oh, Jan, you are too good to cheat me. Is it joke you are putting upon\nme?\"\n\nI answered her with a gaze alone; and she tucked up her clothes and\nfollowed me because the road was dirty. Then I opened the door just wide\nenough for the child to to go her father, and left those two to have it\nout, as might be most natural. And they took a long time about it.\n\nMeanwhile I needs must go and tell my Lorna all the matter; and her joy\nwas almost as great as if she herself had found a father. And the\nwonder of the whole was this, that I got all the credit; of which not\na thousandth part belonged by right and reason to me. Yet so it almost\nalways is. If I work for good desert, and slave, and lie awake at night,\nand spend my unborn life in dreams, not a blink, nor wink, nor inkling\nof my labour ever tells. It would have been better to leave unburned,\nand to keep undevoured, the fuel and the food of life. But if I have\nlaboured not, only acted by some impulse, whim, caprice, or anything;\nor even acting not at all, only letting things float by; piled upon me\ncommendations, bravoes, and applauses, almost work me up to tempt once\nagain (though sick of it) the ill luck of deserving.\n\nWithout intending any harm, and meaning only good indeed, I had now done\nserious wrong to Uncle Reuben's prospects. For Captain Carfax was full\nas angry at the trick played on him as he was happy in discovering the\nfalsehood and the fraud of it. Nor could I help agreeing with him, when\nhe told me all of it, as with tears in his eyes he did, and ready to be\nmy slave henceforth; I could not forbear from owning that it was a low\nand heartless trick, unworthy of men who had families; and the recoil\nwhereof was well deserved, whatever it might end in.\n\nFor when this poor man left his daughter, asleep as he supposed, and\nhaving his food, and change of clothes, and Sunday hat to see to, he\nmeant to return in an hour or so, and settle about her sustenance in\nsome house of the neighbourhood. But this was the very thing of all\nthings which the leaders of the enterprise, who had brought him up from\nCornwall, for his noted skill in metals, were determined, whether by\nfair means or foul, to stop at the very outset. Secrecy being their main\nobject, what chance could there be of it, if the miners were allowed to\nkeep their children in the neighbourhood? Hence, on the plea of feasting\nSimon, they kept him drunk for three days and three nights, assuring him\n(whenever he had gleams enough to ask for her) that his daughter was as\nwell as could be, and enjoying herself with the children. Not wishing\nthe maid to see him tipsy, he pressed the matter no further; but applied\nhimself to the bottle again, and drank her health with pleasure.\n\nHowever, after three days of this, his constitution rose against it, and\nhe became quite sober; with a certain lowness of heart moreover, and a\nsense of error. And his first desire to right himself, and easiest way\nto do it, was by exerting parental authority upon Gwenny. Possessed with\nthis intention (for he was not a sweet tempered man, and his head was\naching sadly) he sought for Gwenny high and low; first with threats, and\nthen with fears, and then with tears and wailing. And so he became to\nthe other men a warning and a great annoyance. Therefore they combined\nto swear what seemed a very likely thing, and might be true for all\nthey knew, to wit, that Gwenny had come to seek for her father down the\nshaft-hole, and peering too eagerly into the dark, had toppled forward,\nand gone down, and lain at the bottom as dead as a stone.\n\n\"And thou being so happy with drink,\" the villains finished up to him,\n\"and getting drunker every day, we thought it shame to trouble thee; and\nwe buried the wench in the lower drift; and no use to think more of her;\nbut come and have a glass, Sim.\"\n\nBut Simon Carfax swore that drink had lost him his wife, and now had\nlost him the last of his five children, and would lose him his own soul,\nif further he went on with it; and from that day to his death he never\ntouched strong drink again. Nor only this; but being soon appointed\ncaptain of the mine, he allowed no man on any pretext to bring cordials\nthither; and to this and his stern hard rule and stealthy secret\nmanagement (as much as to good luck and place) might it be attributed\nthat scarcely any but themselves had dreamed about this Exmoor mine.\n\nAs for me, I had no ambition to become a miner; and the state to which\ngold-seeking had brought poor Uncle Ben was not at all encouraging. My\nbusiness was to till the ground, and tend the growth that came of it,\nand store the fruit in Heaven's good time, rather than to scoop and\nburrow like a weasel or a rat for the yellow root of evil. Moreover, I\nwas led from home, between the hay and corn harvests (when we often have\na week to spare), by a call there was no resisting; unless I gave up all\nregard for wrestling, and for my county.\n\nNow here many persons may take me amiss, and there always has been some\nconfusion; which people who ought to have known better have wrought into\nsubject of quarrelling. By birth it is true, and cannot be denied,\nthat I am a man of Somerset; nevertheless by breed I am, as well as by\neducation, a son of Devon also. And just as both of our two counties\nvowed that Glen Doone was none of theirs, but belonged to the other\none; so now, each with hot claim and jangling (leading even to blows\nsometimes), asserted and would swear to it (as I became more famous)\nthat John Ridd was of its own producing, bred of its own true blood, and\nbasely stolen by the other.\n\nNow I have not judged it in any way needful or even becoming and\ndelicate, to enter into my wrestling adventures, or describe my\nprogress. The whole thing is so different from Lorna, and her gentle\nmanners, and her style of walking; moreover I must seem (even to kind\npeople) to magnify myself so much, or at least attempt to do it, that I\nhave scratched out written pages, through my better taste and sense.\n\nNeither will I, upon this head, make any difference even now; being\nsimply betrayed into mentioning the matter because bare truth requires\nit, in the tale of Lorna's fortunes.\n\nFor a mighty giant had arisen in a part of Cornwall: and his calf was\ntwenty-five inches round, and the breadth of his shoulders two feet\nand a quarter; and his stature seven feet and three-quarters. Round the\nchest he was seventy inches, and his hand a foot across, and there were\nno scales strong enough to judge of his weight in the market-place. Now\nthis man--or I should say, his backers and his boasters, for the giant\nhimself was modest--sent me a brave and haughty challenge, to meet\nhim in the ring at Bodmin-town, on the first day of August, or else to\nreturn my champion's belt to them by the messenger.\n\nIt is no use to deny but that I was greatly dashed and scared at first.\nFor my part, I was only, when measured without clothes on, sixty inches\nround the breast, and round the calf scarce twenty-one, only two feet\nacross the shoulders, and in height not six and three-quarters. However,\nmy mother would never believe that this man could beat me; and Lorna\nbeing of the same mind, I resolved to go and try him, as they would pay\nall expenses and a hundred pounds, if I conquered him; so confident were\nthose Cornishmen.\n\nNow this story is too well known for me to go through it again and\nagain. Every child in Devonshire knows, and his grandson will know, the\nsong which some clever man made of it, after I had treated him to water,\nand to lemon, and a little sugar, and a drop of eau-de-vie. Enough that\nI had found the giant quite as big as they had described him, and enough\nto terrify any one. But trusting in my practice and study of the art, I\nresolved to try a back with him; and when my arms were round him once,\nthe giant was but a farthingale put into the vice of a blacksmith. The\nman had no bones; his frame sank in, and I was afraid of crushing him.\nHe lay on his back, and smiled at me; and I begged his pardon.\n\nNow this affair made a noise at the time, and redounded so much to my\ncredit, that I was deeply grieved at it, because deserving none. For\nI do like a good strife and struggle; and the doubt makes the joy of\nvictory; whereas in this case, I might as well have been sent for a\nmatch with a hay-mow. However, I got my hundred pounds, and made up my\nmind to spend every farthing in presents for mother and Lorna.\n\nFor Annie was married by this time, and long before I went away; as need\nscarcely be said, perhaps; if any one follows the weeks and the months.\nThe wedding was quiet enough, except for everybody's good wishes; and I\ndesire not to dwell upon it, because it grieved me in many ways.\n\nBut now that I had tried to hope the very best for dear Annie, a deeper\nblow than could have come, even through her, awaited me. For after that\nvisit to Cornwall, and with my prize-money about me, I came on foot\nfrom Okehampton to Oare, so as to save a little sum towards my time of\nmarrying. For Lorna's fortune I would not have; small or great I would\nnot have it; only if there were no denying we would devote the whole of\nit to charitable uses, as Master Peter Blundell had done; and perhaps\nthe future ages would endeavour to be grateful. Lorna and I had settled\nthis question at least twice a day, on the average; and each time with\nmore satisfaction.\n\nNow coming into the kitchen with all my cash in my breeches pocket\n(golden guineas, with an elephant on them, for the stamp of the Guinea\nCompany), I found dear mother most heartily glad to see me safe and\nsound again--for she had dreaded that giant, and dreamed of him--and\nshe never asked me about the money. Lizzie also was softer, and more\ngracious than usual; especially when she saw me pour guineas, like\npeppercorns, into the pudding-basin. But by the way they hung about, I\nknew that something was gone wrong.\n\n\"Where is Lorna?\" I asked at length, after trying not to ask it; \"I want\nher to come, and see my money. She never saw so much before.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said mother with a heavy sigh; \"she will see a great deal more,\nI fear; and a deal more than is good for her. Whether you ever see her\nagain will depend upon her nature, John.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, mother? Have you quarrelled? Why does not Lorna come\nto me? Am I never to know?\"\n\n\"Now, John, be not so impatient,\" my mother replied, quite calmly, for\nin truth she was jealous of Lorna, \"you could wait now, very well, John,\nif it were till this day week, for the coming of your mother, John. And\nyet your mother is your best friend. Who can ever fill her place?\"\n\nThinking of her future absence, mother turned away and cried; and the\nbox-iron singed the blanket.\n\n\"Now,\" said I, being wild by this time; \"Lizzie, you have a little\nsense; will you tell me where is Lorna?\"\n\n\"The Lady Lorna Dugal,\" said Lizzie, screwing up her lips as if the\ntitle were too grand, \"is gone to London, brother John; and not likely\nto come back again. We must try to get on without her.\"\n\n\"You little--[something]\" I cried, which I dare not write down here,\nas all you are too good for such language; but Lizzie's lip provoked me\nso--\"my Lorna gone, my Lorna gone! And without good-bye to me even! It\nis your spite has sickened her.\"\n\n\"You are quite mistaken there,\" she replied; \"how can folk of low degree\nhave either spite or liking towards the people so far above them? The\nLady Lorna Dugal is gone, because she could not help herself; and she\nwept enough to break ten hearts--if hearts are ever broken, John.\"\n\n\"Darling Lizzie, how good you are!\" I cried, without noticing her sneer;\n\"tell me all about it, dear; tell me every word she said.\"\n\n\"That will not take long,\" said Lizzie, quite as unmoved by soft coaxing\nas by urgent cursing; \"the lady spoke very little to any one, except\nindeed to mother, and to Gwenny Carfax; and Gwenny is gone with her, so\nthat the benefit of that is lost. But she left a letter for 'poor John,'\nas in charity she called him. How grand she looked, to be sure, with the\nfine clothes on that were come for her!\"\n\n\"Where is the letter, you utter vixen! Oh, may you have a husband! Who\nwill thresh it out of you, and starve it, and swear it out of you!\"\nwas the meaning of my imprecation: but Lizzie, not dreaming as yet of\nsuch things, could not understand me, and was rather thankful; therefore\nshe answered quietly,--\n\n\"The letter is in the little cupboard, near the head of Lady Lorna's\nbed, where she used to keep the diamond necklace, which we contrived to\nget stolen.\"\n\nWithout another word I rushed (so that every board in the house shook)\nup to my lost Lorna's room, and tore the little wall-niche open and\nespied my treasure. It was as simple, and as homely, and loving, as even\nI could wish. Part of it ran as follows,--the other parts it behoves me\nnot to open out to strangers:--\"My own love, and sometime lord,--Take it\nnot amiss of me, that even without farewell, I go; for I cannot persuade\nthe men to wait, your return being doubtful. My great-uncle, some grand\nlord, is awaiting me at Dunster, having fear of venturing too near this\nExmoor country. I, who have been so lawless always, and the child of\noutlaws, am now to atone for this, it seems, by living in a court of\nlaw, and under special surveillance (as they call it, I believe) of\nHis Majesty's Court of Chancery. My uncle is appointed my guardian and\nmaster; and I must live beneath his care, until I am twenty-one years\nold. To me this appears a dreadful thing, and very unjust, and cruel;\nfor why should I lose my freedom, through heritage of land and gold? I\noffered to abandon all if they would only let me go; I went down on my\nknees to them, and said I wanted titles not, neither land, nor money;\nonly to stay where I was, where first I had known happiness. But they\nonly laughed and called me 'child,' and said I must talk of that to the\nKing's High Chancellor. Their orders they had, and must obey them; and\nMaster Stickles was ordered too, to help as the King's Commissioner. And\nthen, although it pierced my heart not to say one 'goodbye, John,' I\nwas glad upon the whole that you were not here to dispute it. For I am\nalmost certain that you would not, without force to yourself, have let\nyour Lorna go to people who never, never can care for her.\"\n\nHere my darling had wept again, by the tokens on the paper; and then\nthere followed some sweet words, too sweet for me to chatter them.\nBut she finished with these noble lines, which (being common to all\nhumanity, in a case of steadfast love) I do no harm, but rather help all\ntrue love by repeating. \"Of one thing rest you well assured--and I do\nhope that it may prove of service to your rest, love, else would my own\nbe broken--no difference of rank, or fortune, or of life itself, shall\never make me swerve from truth to you. We have passed through many\ntroubles, dangers, and dispartments, but never yet was doubt between us;\nneither ever shall be. Each has trusted well the other; and still\neach must do so. Though they tell you I am false, though your own mind\nharbours it, from the sense of things around, and your own undervaluing,\nyet take counsel of your heart, and cast such thoughts away from you;\nbeing unworthy of itself they must be unworthy also of the one who\ndwells there; and that one is, and ever shall be, your own Lorna Dugal.\"\n\nSome people cannot understand that tears should come from pleasure; but\nwhether from pleasure or from sorrow (mixed as they are in the twisted\nstrings of a man's heart, or a woman's), great tears fell from my stupid\neyes, even on the blots of Lorna's.\n\n\"No doubt it is all over,\" my mind said to me bitterly; \"trust me, all\nshall yet be right,\" my heart replied very sweetly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\nANNIE LUCKIER THAN JOHN\n\n[Illustration: 559.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nSome people may look down upon us for our slavish ways (as they may\nchoose to call them), but in our part of the country, we do love to\nmention title, and to roll it on our tongues, with a conscience and a\ncomfort. Even if a man knows not, through fault of education, who the\nDuke of this is, or the Earl of that, it will never do for him to say\nso, lest the room look down on him. Therefore he must nod his head,\nand say, \"Ah, to be sure! I know him as well as ever I know my own\ngood woman's brother. He married Lord Flipflap's second daughter, and a\nprecious life she led him.\" Whereupon the room looks up at him. But\nI, being quite unable to carry all this in my head, as I ought, was\nspeedily put down by people of a noble tendency, apt at Lords, and pat\nwith Dukes, and knowing more about the King than His Majesty would have\nrequested. Therefore, I fell back in thought, not daring in words to do\nso, upon the titles of our horses. And all these horses deserved their\nnames, not having merely inherited, but by their own doing earned them.\nSmiler, for instance, had been so called, not so much from a habit of\nsmiling, as from his general geniality, white nose, and white ankle.\nThis worthy horse was now in years, but hale and gay as ever; and when\nyou let him out of the stable, he could neigh and whinny, and make men\nand horses know it. On the other hand, Kickums was a horse of morose\nand surly order; harbouring up revenge, and leading a rider to false\nconfidence. Very smoothly he would go, and as gentle as a turtle-dove;\nuntil his rider fully believed that a pack-thread was enough for him,\nand a pat of approval upon his neck the aim and crown of his worthy\nlife. Then suddenly up went his hind feet to heaven, and the rider for\nthe most part flew over his nose; whereupon good Kickums would take\nadvantage of his favourable position to come and bite a piece out of\nhis back. Now in my present state of mind, being understood of nobody,\nhaving none to bear me company, neither wishing to have any, an\nindefinite kind of attraction drew me into Kickum's society. A bond of\nmutual sympathy was soon established between us; I would ride no other\nhorse, neither Kickums be ridden by any other man. And this good horse\nbecame as jealous about me as a dog might be; and would lash out, or run\nteeth foremost, at any one who came near him when I was on his back.\n\nThis season, the reaping of the corn, which had been but a year ago so\npleasant and so lightsome, was become a heavy labour, and a thing for\ngrumbling rather than for gladness. However, for the sake of all, it\nmust be attended to, and with as fair a show of spirit and alacrity as\nmight be. For otherwise the rest would drag, and drop their hands and\nidle, being quicker to take infection of dullness than of diligence. And\nthe harvest was a heavy one, even heavier than the year before, although\nof poorer quality. Therefore was I forced to work as hard as any horse\ncould during all the daylight hours, and defer till night the brooding\nupon my misfortune. But the darkness always found me stiff with work,\nand weary, and less able to think than to dream, may be, of Lorna. And\nnow the house was so dull and lonesome, wanting Annie's pretty presence,\nand the light of Lorna's eyes, that a man had no temptation after\nsupper-time even to sit and smoke a pipe.\n\nFor Lizzie, though so learned, and pleasant when it suited her, never\nhad taken very kindly to my love for Lorna, and being of a proud and\nslightly upstart nature, could not bear to be eclipsed in bearing,\nlooks, and breeding, and even in clothes, by the stranger. For one thing\nI will say of the Doones, that whether by purchase or plunder, they had\nalways dressed my darling well, with her own sweet taste to help them.\nAnd though Lizzie's natural hate of the maid (as a Doone and burdened\nwith father's death) should have been changed to remorse when she\nlearned of Lorna's real parentage, it was only altered to sullenness,\nand discontent with herself, for frequent rudeness to an innocent\nperson, and one of such high descent. Moreover, the child had imbibed\nstrange ideas as to our aristocracy, partly perhaps from her own way of\nthinking, and partly from reading of history. For while, from one point\nof view she looked up at them very demurely, as commissioned by God for\nthe country's good; from another sight she disliked them, as ready to\nsacrifice their best and follow their worst members.\n\nYet why should this wench dare to judge upon a matter so far beyond her,\nand form opinions which she knew better than declare before mother? But\nwith me she had no such scruple, for I had no authority over her; and my\nintellect she looked down upon, because I praised her own so. Thus\nshe made herself very unpleasant to me; by little jags and jerks of\nsneering, sped as though unwittingly; which I (who now considered myself\nallied to the aristocracy, and perhaps took airs on that account) had\nnot wit enough to parry, yet had wound enough to feel.\n\nNow any one who does not know exactly how mothers feel and think, would\nhave expected my mother (than whom could be no better one) to pet me,\nand make much of me, under my sad trouble; to hang with anxiety on my\nlooks, and shed her tears with mine (if any), and season every dish of\nmeat put by for her John's return. And if the whole truth must be told,\nI did expect that sort of thing, and thought what a plague it would\nbe to me; yet not getting it, was vexed, as if by some new injury.\nFor mother was a special creature (as I suppose we all are), being the\nwarmest of the warm, when fired at the proper corner; and yet, if taken\nat the wrong point, you would say she was incombustible.\n\nHence it came to pass that I had no one even to speak to, about Lorna\nand my grievances; for Captain Stickles was now gone southward; and John\nFry, of course, was too low for it, although a married man, and well\nunder his wife's management. But finding myself unable at last to bear\nthis any longer, upon the first day when all the wheat was cut, and the\nstooks set up in every field, yet none quite fit for carrying, I saddled\ngood Kickums at five in the morning, and without a word to mother (for a\nlittle anxiety might do her good) off I set for Molland parish, to have\nthe counsel and the comfort of my darling Annie.\n\nThe horse took me over the ground so fast (there being few better to go\nwhen he liked), that by nine o'clock Annie was in my arms, and blushing\nto the colour of Winnie's cheeks, with sudden delight and young\nhappiness.\n\n\"You precious little soul!\" I cried: \"how does Tom behave to you?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Annie: \"how dare you ask? He is the kindest, and the best,\nand the noblest of all men, John; not even setting yourself aside. Now\nlook not jealous, John: so it is. We all have special gifts, you know.\nYou are as good as you can be, John; but my husband's special gift is\nnobility of character.\" Here she looked at me, as one who has discovered\nsomething quite unknown.\n\n\"I am devilish glad to hear it,\" said I, being touched at going down so:\n\"keep him to that mark, my dear; and cork the whisky bottle.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling John,\" she answered quickly, not desiring to open that\nsubject, and being too sweet to resent it: \"and how is lovely Lorna?\nWhat an age it is since I have seen you! I suppose we must thank her for\nthat.\"\n\n\"You may thank her for seeing me now,\" said I; \"or rather,\"--seeing how\nhurt she looked,--\"you may thank my knowledge of your kindness, and my\ndesire to speak of her to a soft-hearted dear little soul like you. I\nthink all the women are gone mad. Even mother treats me shamefully. And\nas for Lizzie--\" Here I stopped, knowing no words strong enough, without\nshocking Annie.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that Lorna is gone?\" asked Annie, in great\namazement; yet leaping at the truth, as women do, with nothing at all to\nleap from.\n\n\"Gone. And I never shall see her again. It serves me right for aspiring\nso.\"\n\nBeing grieved at my manner, she led me in where none could interrupt\nus; and in spite of all my dejection, I could not help noticing how very\npretty and even elegant all things were around. For we upon Exmoor have\nlittle taste; all we care for is warm comfort, and plenty to eat and to\ngive away, and a hearty smack in everything. But Squire Faggus had seen\nthe world, and kept company with great people; and the taste he had\nfirst displayed in the shoeing of farmers' horses (which led almost to\nhis ruin, by bringing him into jealousy, and flattery, and dashing ways)\nhad now been cultivated in London, and by moonlight, so that none could\nhelp admiring it.\n\n\"Well!\" I cried, for the moment dropping care and woe in astonishment:\n\"we have nothing like this at Plover's Barrows; nor even Uncle Reuben. I\ndo hope it is honest, Annie?\"\n\n\"Would I sit in a chair that was not my own?\" asked Annie, turning\ncrimson, and dropping defiantly, and with a whisk of her dress which\nI never had seen before, into the very grandest one: \"would I lie on a\ncouch, brother John, do you think, unless good money was paid for it?\nBecause other people are clever, John, you need not grudge them their\nearnings.\"\n\n\"A couch!\" I replied: \"why what can you want with a couch in the\nday-time, Annie? A couch is a small bed, set up in a room without space\nfor a good four-poster. What can you want with a couch downstairs? I\nnever heard of such nonsense. And you ought to be in the dairy.\"\n\n\"I won't cry, brother John, I won't; because you want to make me\ncry\"--and all the time she was crying--\"you always were so nasty, John,\nsometimes. Ah, you have no nobility of character, like my husband. And I\nhave not seen you for two months, John; and now you come to scold me!\"\n\n\"You little darling,\" I said, for Annie's tears always conquered me;\n\"if all the rest ill-use me, I will not quarrel with you, dear. You have\nalways been true to me; and I can forgive your vanity. Your things\nare very pretty, dear; and you may couch ten times a day, without my\ninterference. No doubt your husband has paid for all this, with the\nponies he stole from Exmoor. Nobility of character is a thing beyond\nmy understanding; but when my sister loves a man, and he does well and\nflourishes, who am I to find fault with him? Mother ought to see these\nthings: they would turn her head almost: look at the pimples on the\nchairs!\"\n\n\"They are nothing,\" Annie answered, after kissing me for my kindness:\n\"they are only put in for the time indeed; and we are to have much\nbetter, with gold all round the bindings, and double plush at the\ncorners; so soon as ever the King repays the debt he owes to my poor\nTom.\"\n\nI thought to myself that our present King had been most unlucky in one\nthing--debts all over the kingdom. Not a man who had struck a blow for\nthe King, or for his poor father, or even said a good word for him,\nin the time of his adversity, but expected at least a baronetcy, and\na grant of estates to support it. Many have called King Charles\nungrateful: and he may have been so. But some indulgence is due to\na man, with entries few on the credit side, and a terrible column of\ndebits.\n\n\"Have no fear for the chair,\" I said, for it creaked under me very\nfearfully, having legs not so large as my finger; \"if the chair breaks,\nAnnie, your fear should be, lest the tortoise-shell run into me. Why, it\nis striped like a viper's loins! I saw some hundreds in London; and very\ncheap they are. They are made to be sold to the country people, such as\nyou and me, dear; and carefully kept they will last for almost half\na year. Now will you come back from your furniture, and listen to my\nstory?\"\n\nAnnie was a hearty dear, and she knew that half my talk was joke, to\nmake light of my worrying. Therefore she took it in good part, as I well\nknew that she would do; and she led me to a good honest chair; and she\nsat in my lap and kissed me.\n\n\"All this is not like you, John. All this is not one bit like you:\nand your cheeks are not as they ought to be. I shall have to come home\nagain, if the women worry my brother so. We always held together, John;\nand we always will, you know.\"\n\n\"You dear,\" I cried, \"there is nobody who understands me as you do.\nLorna makes too much of me, and the rest they make too little.\"\n\n\"Not mother; oh, not mother, John!\"\n\n\"No, mother makes too much, no doubt; but wants it all for herself\nalone; and reckons it as a part of her. She makes me more wroth than any\none: as if not only my life, but all my head and heart must seek from\nhers, and have no other thought or care.\"\n\nBeing sped of my grumbling thus, and eased into better temper, I told\nAnnie all the strange history about Lorna and her departure, and the\nsmall chance that now remained to me of ever seeing my love again. To\nthis Annie would not hearken twice, but judging women by her faithful\nself, was quite vexed with me for speaking so. And then, to my surprise\nand sorrow, she would deliver no opinion as to what I ought to do until\nshe had consulted darling Tom.\n\nDear Tom knew much of the world, no doubt, especially the dark side of\nit. But to me it scarcely seemed becoming that my course of action with\nregard to the Lady Lorna Dugal should be referred to Tom Faggus, and\ndepend upon his decision. However, I would not grieve Annie again by\nmaking light of her husband; and so when he came in to dinner, the\nmatter was laid before him.\n\nNow this man never confessed himself surprised, under any circumstances;\nhis knowledge of life being so profound, and his charity universal. And\nin the present case he vowed that he had suspected it all along, and\ncould have thrown light upon Lorna's history, if we had seen fit to\napply to him. Upon further inquiry I found that this light was a very\ndim one, flowing only from the fact that he had stopped her mother's\ncoach, at the village of Bolham, on the Bampton Road, the day before I\nsaw them. Finding only women therein, and these in a sad condition, Tom\nwith his usual chivalry (as he had no scent of the necklace) allowed\nthem to pass; with nothing more than a pleasant exchange of courtesies,\nand a testimonial forced upon him, in the shape of a bottle of Burgundy\nwine. This the poor countess handed him; and he twisted the cork out\nwith his teeth, and drank her health with his hat off.\n\n\"A lady she was, and a true one; and I am a pretty good judge,\" said\nTom: \"ah, I do like a high lady!\"\n\nOur Annie looked rather queer at this, having no pretensions to be one:\nbut she conquered herself, and said, \"Yes, Tom; and many of them liked\nyou.\"\n\nWith this, Tom went on the brag at once, being but a shallow fellow, and\nnot of settled principles, though steadier than he used to be; until I\nfelt myself almost bound to fetch him back a little; for of all things\nI do hate brag the most, as any reader of this tale must by this time\nknow. Therefore I said to Squire Faggus, \"Come back from your highway\ndays. You have married the daughter of an honest man; and such talk\nis not fit for her. If you were right in robbing people, I am right\nin robbing you. I could bind you to your own mantelpiece, as you know\nthoroughly well, Tom; and drive away with your own horses, and all your\ngoods behind them, but for the sense of honesty. And should I not do as\nfine a thing as any you did on the highway? If everything is of public\nright, how does this chair belong to you? Clever as you are, Tom Faggus,\nyou are nothing but a fool to mix your felony with your farmership. Drop\nthe one, or drop the other; you cannot maintain them both.\"\n\nAs I finished very sternly a speech which had exhausted me more than ten\nrounds of wrestling--but I was carried away by the truth, as sometimes\nhappens to all of us--Tom had not a word to say; albeit his mind was\nso much more nimble and rapid than ever mine was. He leaned against the\nmantelpiece (a newly-invented affair in his house) as if I had corded\nhim to it, even as I spoke of doing. And he laid one hand on his breast\nin a way which made Annie creep softly to him, and look at me not like a\nsister.\n\n\"You have done me good, John,\" he said at last, and the hand he gave me\nwas trembling: \"there is no other man on God's earth would have dared\nto speak to me as you have done. From no other would I have taken it.\nNevertheless every word is true; and I shall dwell on it when you are\ngone. If you never did good in your life before, John, my brother, you\nhave done it now.\"\n\nHe turned away, in bitter pain, that none might see his trouble; and\nAnnie, going along with him, looked as if I had killed our mother. For\nmy part, I was so upset, for fear of having gone too far, that without\na word to either of them, but a message on the title-page of King\nJames his Prayer-book, I saddled Kickums, and was off, and glad of the\nmoorland air again.\n\n[Illustration: 566.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\nTHEREFORE HE SEEKS COMFORT\n\n[Illustration: 567.jpg Dulvertin Church and Street]\n\nIt was for poor Annie's sake that I had spoken my mind to her husband so\nfreely, and even harshly. For we all knew she would break her heart, if\nTom took to evil ways again. And the right mode of preventing this\nwas, not to coax, and flatter, and make a hero of him (which he did for\nhimself, quite sufficiently), but to set before him the folly of the\nthing, and the ruin to his own interests. They would both be vexed with\nme, of course, for having left them so hastily, and especially just\nbefore dinner-time; but that would soon wear off; and most likely they\nwould come to see mother, and tell her that I was hard to manage, and\nthey could feel for her about it.\n\nNow with a certain yearning, I know not what, for softness, and for one\nwho could understand me--for simple as a child though being, I found\nfew to do that last, at any rate in my love-time--I relied upon Kickum's\nstrength to take me round by Dulverton. It would make the journey some\neight miles longer, but what was that to a brisk young horse, even with\nmy weight upon him?\n\nAnd having left Squire Faggus and Annie much sooner than had been\nintended, I had plenty of time before me, and too much, ere a prospect\nof dinner. Therefore I struck to the right, across the hills, for\nDulverton.\n\nPretty Ruth was in the main street of the town, with a basket in her\nhand, going home from the market.\n\n\"Why, Cousin Ruth, you are grown,\" I exclaimed; \"I do believe you are,\nRuth. And you were almost too tall, already.\"\n\nAt this the little thing was so pleased, that she smiled through her\nblushes beautifully, and must needs come to shake hands with me; though\nI signed to her not to do it, because of my horse's temper. But scarcely\nwas her hand in mine, when Kickums turned like an eel upon her, and\ncaught her by the left arm with his teeth, so that she screamed with\nagony. I saw the white of his vicious eye, and struck him there with all\nmy force, with my left hand over her right arm, and he never used that\neye again; none the less he kept his hold on her. Then I smote him again\non the jaw, and caught the little maid up by her right hand, and laid\nher on the saddle in front of me; while the horse being giddy and\nstaggered with blows, and foiled of his spite, ran backward. Ruth's wits\nwere gone; and she lay before me, in such a helpless and senseless way\nthat I could have killed vile Kickums. I struck the spurs into him past\nthe rowels, and away he went at full gallop; while I had enough to do to\nhold on, with the little girl lying in front of me. But I called to the\nmen who were flocking around, to send up a surgeon, as quick as could\nbe, to Master Reuben Huckaback's.\n\nThe moment I brought my right arm to bear, the vicious horse had no\nchance with me; and if ever a horse was well paid for spite, Kickums\nhad his change that day. The bridle would almost have held a whale and\nI drew on it so that his lower jaw was well-nigh broken from him; while\nwith both spurs I tore his flanks, and he learned a little lesson.\nThere are times when a man is more vicious than any horse may vie with.\nTherefore by the time we had reached Uncle Reuben's house at the top of\nthe hill, the bad horse was only too happy to stop; every string of his\nbody was trembling, and his head hanging down with impotence. I leaped\nfrom his back at once, and carried the maiden into her own sweet room.\n\nNow Cousin Ruth was recovering softly from her fright and faintness; and\nthe volley of the wind from galloping so had made her little ears quite\npink, and shaken her locks all round her. But any one who might wish\nto see a comely sight and a moving one, need only have looked at Ruth\nHuckaback, when she learned (and imagined yet more than it was) the\nmanner of her little ride with me. Her hair was of a hazel-brown, and\nfull of waving readiness; and with no concealment of the trick, she\nspread it over her eyes and face. Being so delighted with her, and so\nglad to see her safe, I kissed her through the thick of it, as a cousin\nhas a right to do; yea, and ought to do, with gravity.\n\n\"Darling,\" I said; \"he has bitten you dreadfully: show me your poor arm,\ndear.\"\n\nShe pulled up her sleeve in the simplest manner, rather to look at it\nherself, than to show me where the wound was. Her sleeve was of dark\nblue Taunton staple; and her white arm shone, coming out of it, as round\nand plump and velvety, as a stalk of asparagus, newly fetched out of the\nground. But above the curved soft elbow, where no room was for one cross\nword (according to our proverb),* three sad gashes, edged with crimson,\nspoiled the flow of the pearly flesh. My presence of mind was lost\naltogether; and I raised the poor sore arm to my lips, both to stop the\nbleeding and to take the venom out, having heard how wise it was, and\nthinking of my mother. But Ruth, to my great amazement, drew away from\nme in bitter haste, as if I had been inserting instead of extracting\npoison. For the bite of a horse is most venomous; especially when he\nsheds his teeth; and far more to be feared than the bite of a dog, or\neven of a cat. And in my haste I had forgotten that Ruth might not know\na word about this, and might doubt about my meaning, and the warmth\nof my osculation. But knowing her danger, I durst not heed her\nchildishness, or her feelings.\n\n     * \"A maid with an elbow sharp, or knee,\n     Hath cross words two, out of every three.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Cousin Ruth,\" I said, catching her so that she could\nnot move; \"the poison is soaking into you. Do you think that I do it for\npleasure?\"\n\nThe spread of shame on her face was such, when she saw her own\nmisunderstanding, that I was ashamed to look at her; and occupied myself\nwith drawing all the risk of glanders forth from the white limb, hanging\nhelpless now, and left entirely to my will. Before I was quite sure of\nhaving wholly exhausted suction, and when I had made the holes in her\narm look like the gills of a lamprey, in came the doctor, partly drunk,\nand in haste to get through his business.\n\n\"Ha, ha! I see,\" he cried; \"bite of a horse, they tell me. Very\npoisonous; must be burned away. Sally, the iron in the fire. If you have\na fire, this weather.\"\n\n\"Crave your pardon, good sir,\" I said; for poor little Ruth was fainting\nagain at his savage orders: \"but my cousin's arm shall not be burned; it\nis a great deal too pretty, and I have sucked all the poison out. Look,\nsir, how clean and fresh it is.\"\n\n\"Bless my heart! And so it is! No need at all for cauterising. The\nepidermis will close over, and the cutis and the pellis. John Ridd, you\nought to have studied medicine, with your healing powers. Half my virtue\nlies in touch. A clean and wholesome body, sir; I have taught you the\nLatin grammar. I leave you in excellent hands, my dear, and they wait\nfor me at shovel-board. Bread and water poultice cold, to be renewed,\n_tribus horis_. John Ridd, I was at school with you, and you beat me very\nlamentably, when I tried to fight with you. You remember me not? It is\nlikely enough: I am forced to take strong waters, John, from infirmity\nof the liver. Attend to my directions; and I will call again in the\nmorning.\"\n\nAnd in that melancholy plight, caring nothing for business, went one\nof the cleverest fellows ever known at Tiverton. He could write Latin\nverses a great deal faster than I could ever write English prose, and\nnothing seemed too great for him. We thought that he would go to Oxford\nand astonish every one, and write in the style of Buchanan; but he fell\nall abroad very lamentably; and now, when I met him again, was come down\nto push-pin and shovel-board, with a wager of spirits pending.\n\nWhen Master Huckaback came home, he looked at me very sulkily; not only\nbecause of my refusal to become a slave to the gold-digging, but also\nbecause he regarded me as the cause of a savage broil between Simon\nCarfax and the men who had cheated him as to his Gwenny. However, when\nUncle Ben saw Ruth, and knew what had befallen her, and she with tears\nin her eyes declared that she owed her life to Cousin Ridd, the old man\nbecame very gracious to me; for if he loved any one on earth, it was his\nlittle granddaughter.\n\nI could not stay very long, because, my horse being quite unfit to\ntravel from the injuries which his violence and vice had brought upon\nhim, there was nothing for me but to go on foot, as none of Uncle Ben's\nhorses could take me to Plover's Barrows, without downright cruelty: and\nthough there would be a harvest-moon, Ruth agreed with me that I must\nnot keep my mother waiting, with no idea where I might be, until a\nlate hour of the night. I told Ruth all about our Annie, and her noble\nfurniture; and the little maid was very lively (although her wounds were\npaining her so, that half her laughter came \"on the wrong side of her\nmouth,\" as we rather coarsely express it); especially she laughed about\nAnnie's new-fangled closet for clothes, or standing-press, as she called\nit. This had frightened me so that I would not come without my stick to\nlook at it; for the front was inlaid with two fiery dragons, and a glass\nwhich distorted everything, making even Annie look hideous; and when it\nwas opened, a woman's skeleton, all in white, revealed itself, in the\nmidst of three standing women. \"It is only to keep my best frocks in\nshape,\" Annie had explained to me; \"hanging them up does ruin them so.\nBut I own that I was afraid of it, John, until I had got all my best\nclothes there, and then I became very fond of it. But even now it\nfrightens me sometimes in the moonlight.\"\n\nHaving made poor Ruth a little cheerful, with a full account of all\nAnnie's frocks, material, pattern, and fashion (of which I had taken a\nlist for my mother, and for Lizzie, lest they should cry out at man's\nstupidity about anything of real interest), I proceeded to tell her\nabout my own troubles, and the sudden departure of Lorna; concluding\nwith all the show of indifference which my pride could muster, that\nnow I never should see her again, and must do my best to forget her, as\nbeing so far above me. I had not intended to speak of this, but Ruth's\nface was so kind and earnest, that I could not stop myself.\n\n\"You must not talk like that, Cousin Ridd,\" she said, in a low and\ngentle tone, and turning away her eyes from me; \"no lady can be above\na man, who is pure, and brave, and gentle. And if her heart be worth\nhaving, she will never let you give her up, for her grandeur, and her\nnobility.\"\n\nShe pronounced those last few words, as I thought, with a little\nbitterness, unperceived by herself perhaps, for it was not in her\nappearance. But I, attaching great importance to a maiden's opinion\nabout a maiden (because she might judge from experience), would have led\nher further into that subject. But she declined to follow, having now no\nmore to say in a matter so removed from her. Then I asked her full and\nstraight, and looking at her in such a manner that she could not look\naway, without appearing vanquished by feelings of her own--which thing\nwas very vile of me; but all men are so selfish,--\n\n\"Dear cousin, tell me, once for all, what is your advice to me?\"\n\n[Illustration: 572.jpg What is your advice to me?]\n\n\"My advice to you,\" she answered bravely, with her dark eyes full of\npride, and instead of flinching, foiling me,--\"is to do what every man\nmust do, if he would win fair maiden. Since she cannot send you token,\nneither is free to return to you, follow her, pay your court to her;\nshow that you will not be forgotten; and perhaps she will look down--I\nmean, she will relent to you.\"\n\n\"She has nothing to relent about. I have never vexed nor injured her.\nMy thoughts have never strayed from her. There is no one to compare with\nher.\"\n\n\"Then keep her in that same mind about you. See now, I can advise no\nmore. My arm is swelling painfully, in spite of all your goodness, and\nbitter task of surgeonship. I shall have another poultice on, and go to\nbed, I think, Cousin Ridd, if you will not hold me ungrateful. I am so\nsorry for your long walk. Surely it might be avoided. Give my love to\ndear Lizzie: oh, the room is going round so.\"\n\nAnd she fainted into the arms of Sally, who was come just in time to\nfetch her: no doubt she had been suffering agony all the time she talked\nto me. Leaving word that I would come again to inquire for her,\nand fetch Kickums home, so soon as the harvest permitted me, I gave\ndirections about the horse, and striding away from the ancient town, was\nsoon upon the moorlands.\n\nNow, through the whole of that long walk--the latter part of which was\nled by starlight, till the moon arose--I dwelt, in my young and foolish\nway, upon the ordering of our steps by a Power beyond us. But as I could\nnot bring my mind to any clearness upon this matter, and the stars shed\nno light upon it, but rather confused me with wondering how their Lord\ncould attend to them all, and yet to a puny fool like me, it came to\npass that my thoughts on the subject were not worth ink, if I knew them.\n\nBut it is perhaps worth ink to relate, so far as I can do so, mother's\ndelight at my return, when she had almost abandoned hope, and concluded\nthat I was gone to London, in disgust at her behaviour. And now she was\nlooking up the lane, at the rise of the harvest-moon, in despair, as she\nsaid afterwards. But if she had despaired in truth, what use to look at\nall? Yet according to the epigram made by a good Blundellite,--\n\n    \"Despair was never yet so deep\n     In sinking as in seeming;\n     Despair is hope just dropped asleep\n     For better chance of dreaming.\"\n\nAnd mother's dream was a happy one, when she knew my step at a furlong\ndistant; for the night was of those that carry sound thrice as far as\nday can. She recovered herself, when she was sure, and even made up her\nmind to scold me, and felt as if she could do it. But when she was in\nmy arms, into which she threw herself, and I by the light of the moon\ndescried the silver gleam on one side of her head (now spreading since\nAnnie's departure), bless my heart and yours therewith, no room was left\nfor scolding. She hugged me, and she clung to me; and I looked at her,\nwith duty made tenfold, and discharged by love. We said nothing to one\nanother; but all was right between us.\n\nEven Lizzie behaved very well, so far as her nature admitted; not even\nsaying a nasty thing all the time she was getting my supper ready, with\na weak imitation of Annie. She knew that the gift of cooking was not\nvouchsafed by God to her; but sometimes she would do her best, by\nintellect to win it. Whereas it is no more to be won by intellect than\nis divine poetry. An amount of strong quick heart is needful, and the\nunderstanding must second it, in the one art as in the other. Now my\nfare was very choice for the next three days or more; yet not turned out\nlike Annie's. They could do a thing well enough on the fire; but they\ncould not put it on table so; nor even have plates all piping hot. This\nwas Annie's special gift; born in her, and ready to cool with her; like\na plate borne away from the fireplace. I sighed sometimes about Lorna,\nand they thought it was about the plates. And mother would stand and\nlook at me, as much as to say, \"No pleasing him\"; and Lizzie would jerk\nup one shoulder, and cry, \"He had better have Lorna to cook for him\";\nwhile the whole truth was that I wanted not to be plagued about any\ncookery; but just to have something good and quiet, and then smoke and\nthink about Lorna.\n\nNevertheless the time went on, with one change and another; and we\ngathered all our harvest in; and Parson Bowden thanked God for it,\nboth in church and out of it; for his tithes would be very goodly. The\nunmatched cold of the previous winter, and general fear of scarcity, and\nour own talk about our ruin, had sent prices up to a grand high pitch;\nand we did our best to keep them there. For nine Englishmen out of every\nten believe that a bitter winter must breed a sour summer, and explain\naway topmost prices. While according to my experience, more often it\nwould be otherwise, except for the public thinking so. However, I have\nsaid too much; and if any farmer reads my book, he will vow that I wrote\nit for nothing else except to rob his family.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\nTHE KING MUST NOT BE PRAYED FOR\n\n[Illustration: 575.jpg Lynmouth]\n\nAll our neighbourhood was surprised that the Doones had not ere now\nattacked, and probably made an end of us. For we lay almost at their\nmercy now, having only Sergeant Bloxham, and three men, to protect us,\nCaptain Stickles having been ordered southwards with all his force;\nexcept such as might be needful for collecting toll, and watching the\nimports at Lynmouth, and thence to Porlock. The Sergeant, having now\nimbibed a taste for writing reports (though his first great effort had\ndone him no good, and only offended Stickles), reported weekly from\nPlover's Barrows, whenever he could find a messenger. And though we fed\nnot Sergeant Bloxham at our own table, with the best we had (as in the\ncase of Stickles, who represented His Majesty), yet we treated him so\nwell, that he reported very highly of us, as loyal and true-hearted\nlieges, and most devoted to our lord the King. And indeed he could\nscarcely have done less, when Lizzie wrote great part of his reports,\nand furbished up the rest to such a pitch of lustre, that Lord Clarendon\nhimself need scarce have been ashamed of them. And though this cost a\ngreat deal of ale, and even of strong waters (for Lizzie would have it\nthe duty of a critic to stand treat to the author), and though it was\notherwise a plague, as giving the maid such airs of patronage, and such\npretence to politics; yet there was no stopping it, without the risk\nof mortal offence to both writer and reviewer. Our mother also, while\ndisapproving Lizzie's long stay in the saddle-room on a Friday night and\na Saturday, and insisting that Betty should be there, was nevertheless\nas proud as need be, that the King should read our Eliza' s writings--at\nleast so the innocent soul believed--and we all looked forward to\nsomething great as the fruit of all this history. And something great\ndid come of it, though not as we expected; for these reports, or as many\nof them as were ever opened, stood us in good stead the next year, when\nwe were accused of harbouring and comforting guilty rebels.\n\nNow the reason why the Doones did not attack us was that they were\npreparing to meet another and more powerful assault upon their fortress;\nbeing assured that their repulse of King's troops could not be looked\nover when brought before the authorities. And no doubt they were right;\nfor although the conflicts in the Government during that summer and\nautumn had delayed the matter yet positive orders had been issued that\nthese outlaws and malefactors should at any price be brought to justice;\nwhen the sudden death of King Charles the Second threw all things into\nconfusion, and all minds into a panic.\n\nWe heard of it first in church, on Sunday, the eighth day of February,\n1684-5, from a cousin of John Fry, who had ridden over on purpose from\nPorlock. He came in just before the anthem, splashed and heated from his\nride, so that every one turned and looked at him. He wanted to create a\nstir (knowing how much would be made of him), and he took the best way\nto do it. For he let the anthem go by very quietly--or rather I should\nsay very pleasingly, for our choir was exceeding proud of itself, and\nI sang bass twice as loud as a bull, to beat the clerk with the\nclarionet--and then just as Parson Bowden, with a look of pride at his\nminstrels, was kneeling down to begin the prayer for the King's Most\nExcellent Majesty (for he never read the litany, except upon Easter\nSunday), up jumps young Sam Fry, and shouts,--\n\n\"I forbid that there prai-er.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the parson, rising slowly, and looking for some one to\nshut the door: \"have we a rebel in the congregation?\" For the parson was\ngrowing short-sighted now, and knew not Sam Fry at that distance.\n\n\"No,\" replied Sam, not a whit abashed by the staring of all the parish;\n\"no rebel, parson; but a man who mislaiketh popery and murder. That\nthere prai-er be a prai-er for the dead.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried the parson, now recognising and knowing him to be our\nJohn's first cousin, \"you do not mean to say, Sam, that His Gracious\nMajesty is dead!\"\n\n\"Dead as a sto-un: poisoned by they Papishers.\" And Sam rubbed his hands\nwith enjoyment, at the effect he had produced.\n\n\"Remember where you are, Sam,\" said Parson Bowden solemnly; \"when did\nthis most sad thing happen? The King is the head of the Church, Sam Fry;\nwhen did he leave her?\"\n\n\"Day afore yesterday. Twelve o'clock. Warn't us quick to hear of 'un?\"\n\n\"Can't be,\" said the minister: \"the tidings can never have come so\nsoon. Anyhow, he will want it all the more. Let us pray for His Gracious\nMajesty.\"\n\nAnd with that he proceeded as usual; but nobody cried \"Amen,\" for fear\nof being entangled with Popery. But after giving forth his text, our\nparson said a few words out of book, about the many virtues of His\nMajesty, and self-denial, and devotion, comparing his pious mirth to the\ndancing of the patriarch David before the ark of the covenant; and he\nadded, with some severity, that if his flock would not join their pastor\n(who was much more likely to judge aright) in praying for the King, the\nleast they could do on returning home was to pray that the King might\nnot be dead, as his enemies had asserted.\n\nNow when the service was over, we killed the King, and we brought him to\nlife, at least fifty times in the churchyard: and Sam Fry was mounted on\na high gravestone, to tell every one all he knew of it. But he knew no\nmore than he had told us in the church, as before repeated: upon which\nwe were much disappointed with him, and inclined to disbelieve him;\nuntil he happily remembered that His Majesty had died in great pain,\nwith blue spots on his breast and black spots all across his back, and\nthese in the form of a cross, by reason of Papists having poisoned him.\nWhen Sam called this to his remembrance (or to his imagination) he was\noverwhelmed, at once, with so many invitations to dinner, that he scarce\nknew which of them to accept; but decided in our favour.\n\nGrieving much for the loss of the King, however greatly it might be (as\nthe parson had declared it was, while telling us to pray against it) for\nthe royal benefit, I resolved to ride to Porlock myself, directly after\ndinner, and make sure whether he were dead, or not. For it was not by\nany means hard to suppose that Sam Fry, being John's first cousin, might\nhave inherited either from grandfather or grandmother some of those\ngifts which had made our John so famous for mendacity. At Porlock I\nfound that it was too true; and the women of the town were in great\ndistress, for the King had always been popular with them: the men, on\nthe other hand, were forecasting what would be likely to ensue.\n\nAnd I myself was of this number, riding sadly home again; although bound\nto the King as churchwarden now; which dignity, next to the parson's in\nrank, is with us (as it ought to be in every good parish) hereditary.\nFor who can stick to the church like the man whose father stuck to it\nbefore him; and who knows all the little ins, and great outs, which must\nin these troublous times come across?\n\nBut though appointed at last, by virtue of being best farmer in the\nparish (as well as by vice of mismanagement on the part of my mother,\nand Nicholas Snowe, who had thoroughly mixed up everything, being too\nquick-headed); yet, while I dwelled with pride upon the fact that I\nstood in the King's shoes, as the manager and promoter of the Church of\nEngland, and I knew that we must miss His Majesty (whose arms were above\nthe Commandments), as the leader of our thoughts in church, and handsome\nupon a guinea; nevertheless I kept on thinking how his death would act\non me.\n\nAnd here I saw it, many ways. In the first place, troubles must break\nout; and we had eight-and-twenty ricks; counting grain, and straw, and\nhay. Moreover, mother was growing weak about riots, and shooting, and\nburning; and she gathered the bed-clothes around her ears every night,\nwhen her feet were tucked up; and prayed not to awake until morning. In\nthe next place, much rebellion (though we would not own it; in either\nsense of the verb, to \"own\") was whispering, and plucking skirts, and\nmaking signs, among us. And the terror of the Doones helped greatly;\nas a fruitful tree of lawlessness, and a good excuse for everybody.\nAnd after this--or rather before it, and first of all indeed (if I must\nstate the true order)--arose upon me the thought of Lorna, and how these\nthings would affect her fate.\n\nAnd indeed I must admit that it had occurred to me sometimes, or been\nsuggested by others, that the Lady Lorna had not behaved altogether\nkindly, since her departure from among us. For although in those days\nthe post (as we call the service of letter-carrying, which now comes\nwithin twenty miles of us) did not extend to our part of the world, yet\nit might have been possible to procure for hire a man who would ride\npost, if Lorna feared to trust the pack-horses, or the troopers, who\nwent to and fro. Yet no message whatever had reached us; neither any\ntoken even of her safety in London. As to this last, however, we had no\nmisgivings, having learned from the orderlies, more than once, that\nthe wealth, and beauty, and adventures of young Lady Lorna Dugal were\ngreatly talked of, both at court and among the common people.\n\nNow riding sadly homewards, in the sunset of the early spring, I was\nmore than ever touched with sorrow, and a sense of being, as it were,\nabandoned. And the weather growing quite beautiful, and so mild that the\ntrees were budding, and the cattle full of happiness, I could not but\nthink of the difference between the world of to-day and the world of\nthis day twelvemonth. Then all was howling desolation, all the earth\nblocked up with snow, and all the air with barbs of ice as small\nas splintered needles, yet glittering, in and out, like stars, and\ngathering so upon a man (if long he stayed among them) that they began\nto weigh him down to sleepiness and frozen death. Not a sign of life\nwas moving, nor was any change of view; unless the wild wind struck the\ncrest of some cold drift, and bowed it.\n\nNow, on the other hand, all was good. The open palm of spring was laid\nupon the yielding of the hills; and each particular valley seemed to be\nthe glove for a finger. And although the sun was low, and dipping in the\nwestern clouds, the gray light of the sea came up, and took, and taking,\ntold the special tone of everything. All this lay upon my heart, without\na word of thinking, spreading light and shadow there, and the soft\ndelight of sadness. Nevertheless, I would it were the savage snow around\nme, and the piping of the restless winds, and the death of everything.\nFor in those days I had Lorna.\n\nThen I thought of promise fair; such as glowed around me, where the\nred rocks held the sun, when he was departed; and the distant crags\nendeavoured to retain his memory. But as evening spread across them,\nshading with a silent fold, all the colour stole away; all remembrance\nwaned and died.\n\n\"So it has been with love,\" I thought, \"and with simple truth and\nwarmth. The maid has chosen the glittering stars, instead of the plain\ndaylight.\"\n\nNevertheless I would not give in, although in deep despondency\n(especially when I passed the place where my dear father had fought in\nvain), and I tried to see things right and then judge aright about them.\nThis, however, was more easy to attempt than to achieve; and by the time\nI came down the hill, I was none the wiser. Only I could tell my mother\nthat the King was dead for sure; and she would have tried to cry, but\nfor thought of her mourning.\n\nThere was not a moment for lamenting. All the mourning must be ready (if\nwe cared to beat the Snowes) in eight-and-forty hours: and, although\nit was Sunday night, mother now feeling sure of the thing, sat up with\nLizzie, cutting patterns, and stitching things on brown paper, and\nsnipping, and laying the fashions down, and requesting all opinions, yet\nwhen given, scorning them; insomuch that I grew weary even of tobacco\n(which had comforted me since Lorna), and prayed her to go on until the\nKing should be alive again.\n\nThe thought of that so flurried her--for she never yet could see a\njoke--that she laid her scissors on the table and said, \"The Lord\nforbid, John! after what I have cut up!\"\n\n\"It would be just like him,\" I answered, with a knowing smile: \"Mother,\nyou had better stop. Patterns may do very well; but don't cut up any\nmore good stuff.\"\n\n\"Well, good lack, I am a fool! Three tables pegged with needles! The\nLord in His mercy keep His Majesty, if ever He hath gotten him!\"\n\nBy this device we went to bed; and not another stitch was struck until\nthe troopers had office-tidings that the King was truly dead. Hence the\nSnowes beat us by a day; and both old Betty and Lizzie laid the blame\nupon me, as usual.\n\nAlmost before we had put off the mourning, which as loyal subjects we\nkept for the King three months and a week; rumours of disturbances, of\nplottings, and of outbreak began to stir among us. We heard of fighting\nin Scotland, and buying of ships on the continent, and of arms in Dorset\nand Somerset; and we kept our beacon in readiness to give signals of a\nlanding; or rather the soldiers did. For we, having trustworthy reports\nthat the King had been to high mass himself in the Abbey of Westminster,\nmaking all the bishops go with him, and all the guards in London, and\nthen tortured all the Protestants who dared to wait outside, moreover\nhad received from the Pope a flower grown in the Virgin Mary's garden,\nand warranted to last for ever, we of the moderate party, hearing all\nthis and ten times as much, and having no love for this sour James,\nsuch as we had for the lively Charles, were ready to wait for what might\nhappen, rather than care about stopping it. Therefore we listened to\nrumours gladly, and shook our heads with gravity, and predicted, every\nman something, but scarce any two the same. Nevertheless, in our part,\nthings went on as usual, until the middle of June was nigh. We ploughed\nthe ground, and sowed the corn, and tended the cattle, and heeded every\none his neighbour's business, as carefully as heretofore; and the only\nthing that moved us much was that Annie had a baby. This being a very\nfine child with blue eyes, and christened \"John\" in compliment to me,\nand with me for his godfather, it is natural to suppose that I thought\na good deal about him; and when mother or Lizzie would ask me, all of a\nsudden, and treacherously, when the fire flared up at supper-time (for\nwe always kept a little wood just alight in summer-time, and enough to\nmake the pot boil), then when they would say to me, \"John, what are\nyou thinking of? At a word, speak!\" I would always answer, \"Little John\nFaggus\"; and so they made no more of me.\n\nBut when I was down, on Saturday the thirteenth of June, at the\nblacksmith's forge by Brendon town, where the Lynn-stream runs so close\nthat he dips his horseshoes in it, and where the news is apt to come\nfirst of all to our neighbourhood (except upon a Sunday), while we were\ntalking of the hay-crop, and of a great sheep-stealer, round the corner\ncame a man upon a piebald horse looking flagged and weary. But seeing\nhalf a dozen of us, young, and brisk, and hearty, he made a flourish\nwith his horse, and waved a blue flag vehemently, shouting with great\nglory,--\n\n[Illustration: 582.jpg Waved a blue flag vehemently]\n\n\"Monmouth and the Protestant faith! Monmouth and no Popery! Monmouth,\nthe good King's eldest son! Down with the poisoning murderer! Down with\nthe black usurper, and to the devil with all papists!\"\n\n\"Why so, thou little varlet?\" I asked very quietly; for the man was too\nsmall to quarrel with: yet knowing Lorna to be a \"papist,\" as we choose\nto call them--though they might as well call us \"kingists,\" after the\nhead of our Church--I thought that this scurvy scampish knave might show\nthem the way to the place he mentioned, unless his courage failed him.\n\n\"Papist yourself, be you?\" said the fellow, not daring to answer much:\n\"then take this, and read it.\"\n\nAnd he handed me a long rigmarole, which he called a \"Declaration\": I\nsaw that it was but a heap of lies, and thrust it into the blacksmith's\nfire, and blew the bellows thrice at it. No one dared attempt to stop\nme, for my mood had not been sweet of late; and of course they knew my\nstrength.\n\nThe man rode on with a muttering noise, having won no recruits from us,\nby force of my example: and he stopped at the ale-house farther down,\nwhere the road goes away from the Lynn-stream. Some of us went thither\nafter a time, when our horses were shodden and rasped, for although we\nmight not like the man, we might be glad of his tidings, which seemed to\nbe something wonderful. He had set up his blue flag in the tap-room, and\nwas teaching every one.\n\n\"Here coom'th Maister Jan Ridd,\" said the landlady, being well pleased\nwith the call for beer and cider: \"her hath been to Lunnon-town, and\nlive within a maile of me. Arl the news coom from them nowadays, instead\nof from here, as her ought to do. If Jan Ridd say it be true, I will try\nalmost to belave it. Hath the good Duke landed, sir?\" And she looked at\nme over a foaming cup, and blew the froth off, and put more in.\n\n\"I have no doubt it is true enough,\" I answered, before drinking; \"and\ntoo true, Mistress Pugsley. Many a poor man will die; but none shall die\nfrom our parish, nor from Brendon, if I can help it.\"\n\nAnd I knew that I could help it; for every one in those little places\nwould abide by my advice; not only from the fame of my schooling and\nlong sojourn in London, but also because I had earned repute for being\nvery \"slow and sure\": and with nine people out of ten this is the very\nbest recommendation. For they think themselves much before you in wit,\nand under no obligation, but rather conferring a favour, by doing the\nthing that you do. Hence, if I cared for influence--which means, for\nthe most part, making people do one's will, without knowing it--my first\nstep toward it would be to be called, in common parlance, \"slow but\nsure.\"\n\nFor the next fortnight we were daily troubled with conflicting rumours,\neach man relating what he desired, rather than what he had right, to\nbelieve. We were told that the Duke had been proclaimed King of England\nin every town of Dorset and of Somerset; that he had won a great battle\nat Axminster, and another at Bridport, and another somewhere else;\nthat all the western counties had risen as one man for him, and all\nthe militia had joined his ranks; that Taunton, and Bridgwater, and\nBristowe, were all mad with delight, the two former being in his hands,\nand the latter craving to be so. And then, on the other hand, we heard\nthat the Duke had been vanquished, and put to flight, and upon being\napprehended, had confessed himself an impostor and a papist as bad as\nthe King was.\n\nWe longed for Colonel Stickles (as he always became in time of war,\nthough he fell back to Captain, and even Lieutenant, directly the fight\nwas over), for then we should have won trusty news, as well as good\nconsideration. But even Sergeant Bloxham, much against his will, was\ngone, having left his heart with our Lizzie, and a collection of all\nhis writings. All the soldiers had been ordered away at full speed for\nExeter, to join the Duke of Albemarle, or if he were gone, to follow\nhim. As for us, who had fed them so long (although not quite for\nnothing), we must take our chance of Doones, or any other enemies.\n\nNow all these tidings moved me a little; not enough to spoil appetite,\nbut enough to make things lively, and to teach me that look of wisdom\nwhich is bred of practice only, and the hearing of many lies. Therefore\nI withheld my judgment, fearing to be triumphed over, if it should\nhappen to miss the mark. But mother and Lizzie, ten times in a day,\npredicted all they could imagine; and their prophecies increased in\nstrength according to contradiction. Yet this was not in the proper\nstyle for a house like ours, which knew the news, or at least had known\nit; and still was famous, all around, for the last advices. Even from\nLynmouth, people sent up to Plover's Barrows to ask how things were\ngoing on: and it was very grievous to answer that in truth we knew not,\nneither had heard for days and days; and our reputation was so great,\nespecially since the death of the King had gone abroad from Oare parish,\nthat many inquirers would only wink, and lay a finger on the lip, as if\nto say, \"you know well enough, but see not fit to tell me.\" And before\nthe end arrived, those people believed that they had been right all\nalong, and that we had concealed the truth from them.\n\nFor I myself became involved (God knows how much against my will and my\nproper judgment) in the troubles, and the conflict, and the cruel work\ncoming afterwards. If ever I had made up my mind to anything in all my\nlife, it was at this particular time, and as stern and strong as could\nbe. I had resolved to let things pass,--to hear about them gladly, to\nencourage all my friends to talk, and myself to express opinion upon\neach particular point, when in the fullness of time no further doubt\ncould be. But all my policy went for nothing, through a few touches of\nfeeling.\n\nOne day at the beginning of July, I came home from mowing about noon, or\na little later, to fetch some cider for all of us, and to eat a morsel\nof bacon. For mowing was no joke that year, the summer being wonderfully\nwet (even for our wet country), and the swathe falling heavier over the\nscythe than ever I could remember it. We were drenched with rain almost\nevery day; but the mowing must be done somehow; and we must trust to God\nfor the haymaking.\n\nIn the courtyard I saw a little cart, with iron brakes underneath it,\nsuch as fastidious people use to deaden the jolting of the road; but few\nmen under a lord or baronet would be so particular. Therefore I wondered\nwho our noble visitor could be. But when I entered the kitchen-place,\nbrushing up my hair for somebody, behold it was no one greater than our\nAnnie, with my godson in her arms, and looking pale and tear-begone.\nAnd at first she could not speak to me. But presently having sat down a\nlittle, and received much praise for her baby, she smiled and blushed,\nand found her tongue as if she had never gone from us.\n\n\"How natural it all looks again! Oh, I love this old kitchen so! Baby\ndear, only look at it wid him pitty, pitty eyes, and him tongue out of\nhis mousy! But who put the flour-riddle up there. And look at the pestle\nand mortar, and rust I declare in the patty pans! And a book, positively\na dirty book, where the clean skewers ought to hang! Oh, Lizzie, Lizzie,\nLizzie!\"\n\n\"You may just as well cease lamenting,\" I said, \"for you can't alter\nLizzie's nature, and you will only make mother uncomfortable, and\nperhaps have a quarrel with Lizzie, who is proud as Punch of her\nhousekeeping.\"\n\n\"She,\" cried Annie, with all the contempt that could be compressed in a\nsyllable. \"Well, John, no doubt you are right about it. I will try not\nto notice things. But it is a hard thing, after all my care, to see\neverything going to ruin. But what can be expected of a girl who knows\nall the kings of Carthage?\"\n\n\"There were no kings of Carthage, Annie. They were called, why let me\nsee--they were called--oh, something else.\"\n\n\"Never mind what they were called,\" said Annie; \"will they cook our\ndinner for us? But now, John, I am in such trouble. All this talk is\nmake-believe.\"\n\n\"Don't you cry, my dear: don't cry, my darling sister,\" I answered,\nas she dropped into the worn place of the settle, and bent above her\ninfant, rocking as if both their hearts were one: \"don't you know,\nAnnie, I cannot tell, but I know, or at least I mean, I have heard the\nmen of experience say, it is so bad for the baby.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I know that as well as you do, John,\" said Annie, looking up at\nme with a gleam of her old laughing: \"but how can I help crying; I am in\nsuch trouble.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is, my dear. Any grief of yours will vex me greatly;\nbut I will try to bear it.\"\n\n\"Then, John, it is just this. Tom has gone off with the rebels; and you\nmust, oh, you must go after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: 586.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\nJOHN IS WORSTED BY THE WOMEN\n\n[Illustration: 587.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nMoved as I was by Annie's tears, and gentle style of coaxing, and most\nof all by my love for her, I yet declared that I could not go, and leave\nour house and homestead, far less my dear mother and Lizzie, at the\nmercy of the merciless Doones.\n\n\"Is that all your objection, John?\" asked Annie, in her quick panting\nway: \"would you go but for that, John?\"\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"be in no such hurry\"--for while I was gradually\nyielding, I liked to pass it through my fingers, as if my fingers shaped\nit: \"there are many things to be thought about, and many ways of viewing\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, you never can have loved Lorna! No wonder you gave her up so! John,\nyou can love nobody, but your oat-ricks, and your hay-ricks.\"\n\n\"Sister mine, because I rant not, neither rave of what I feel, can you\nbe so shallow as to dream that I feel nothing? What is your love for\nTom Faggus? What is your love for your baby (pretty darling as he is)\nto compare with such a love as for ever dwells with me? Because I do not\nprate of it; because it is beyond me, not only to express, but even form\nto my own heart in thoughts; because I do not shape my face, and would\nscorn to play to it, as a thing of acting, and lay it out before you,\nare you fools enough to think--\" but here I stopped, having said more\nthan was usual with me.\n\n\"I am very sorry, John. Dear John, I am so sorry. What a shallow fool I\nam!\"\n\n\"I will go seek your husband,\" I said, to change the subject, for even\nto Annie I would not lay open all my heart about Lorna: \"but only\nupon condition that you ensure this house and people from the Doones\nmeanwhile. Even for the sake of Tom, I cannot leave all helpless. The\noat-ricks and the hay-ricks, which are my only love, they are welcome to\nmake cinders of. But I will not have mother treated so; nor even little\nLizzie, although you scorn your sister so.\"\n\n\"Oh, John, I do think you are the hardest, as well as the softest of all\nthe men I know. Not even a woman's bitter word but what you pay her out\nfor. Will you never understand that we are not like you, John? We say\nall sorts of spiteful things, without a bit of meaning. John, for God's\nsake fetch Tom home; and then revile me as you please, and I will kneel\nand thank you.\"\n\n\"I will not promise to fetch him home,\" I answered, being ashamed of\nmyself for having lost command so: \"but I will promise to do my best, if\nwe can only hit on a plan for leaving mother harmless.\"\n\nAnnie thought for a little while, trying to gather her smooth clear brow\ninto maternal wrinkles, and then she looked at her child, and said, \"I\nwill risk it, for daddy's sake, darling; you precious soul, for daddy's\nsake.\" I asked her what she was going to risk. She would not tell me;\nbut took upper hand, and saw to my cider-cans and bacon, and went from\ncorner to cupboard, exactly as if she had never been married; only\nwithout an apron on. And then she said, \"Now to your mowers, John; and\nmake the most of this fine afternoon; kiss your godson before you go.\"\nAnd I, being used to obey her, in little things of that sort, kissed the\nbaby, and took my cans, and went back to my scythe again.\n\nBy the time I came home it was dark night, and pouring again with a\nfoggy rain, such as we have in July, even more than in January. Being\nsoaked all through, and through, and with water squelching in my boots,\nlike a pump with a bad bucket, I was only too glad to find Annie's\nbright face, and quick figure, flitting in and out the firelight,\ninstead of Lizzie sitting grandly, with a feast of literature, and not\na drop of gravy. Mother was in the corner also, with her cheery-coloured\nribbons glistening very nice by candle-light, looking at Annie now and\nthen, with memories of her babyhood; and then at her having a baby: yet\nhalf afraid of praising her much, for fear of that young Lizzie. But\nLizzie showed no jealousy: she truly loved our Annie (now that she\nwas gone from us), and she wanted to know all sorts of things, and she\nadored the baby. Therefore Annie was allowed to attend to me, as she\nused to do.\n\n\"Now, John, you must start the first thing in the morning,\" she said,\nwhen the others had left the room, but somehow she stuck to the baby,\n\"to fetch me back my rebel, according to your promise.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" I replied, misliking the job, \"all I promised was to go, if\nthis house were assured against any onslaught of the Doones.\"\n\n\"Just so; and here is that assurance.\" With these words she drew forth a\npaper, and laid it on my knee with triumph, enjoying my amazement. This,\nas you may suppose was great; not only at the document, but also at her\npossession of it. For in truth it was no less than a formal undertaking,\non the part of the Doones, not to attack Plover's Barrows farm, or\nmolest any of the inmates, or carry off any chattels, during the absence\nof John Ridd upon a special errand. This document was signed not only\nby the Counsellor, but by many other Doones: whether Carver's name were\nthere, I could not say for certain; as of course he would not sign it\nunder his name of \"Carver,\" and I had never heard Lorna say to what (if\nany) he had been baptized.\n\nIn the face of such a deed as this, I could no longer refuse to go; and\nhaving received my promise, Annie told me (as was only fair) how she had\nprocured that paper. It was both a clever and courageous act; and would\nhave seemed to me, at first sight, far beyond Annie's power. But none\nmay gauge a woman's power, when her love and faith are moved.\n\nThe first thing Annie had done was this: she made herself look ugly.\nThis was not an easy thing; but she had learned a great deal from her\nhusband, upon the subject of disguises. It hurt her feelings not a\nlittle to make so sad a fright of herself; but what could it matter?--if\nshe lost Tom, she must be a far greater fright in earnest, than now\nshe was in seeming. And then she left her child asleep, under Betty\nMuxworthy's tendance--for Betty took to that child, as if there never\nhad been a child before--and away she went in her own \"spring-cart\" (as\nthe name of that engine proved to be), without a word to any one, except\nthe old man who had driven her from Molland parish that morning, and who\ncoolly took one of our best horses, without \"by your leave\" to any one.\n\nAnnie made the old man drive her within easy reach of the Doone-gate,\nwhose position she knew well enough, from all our talk about it. And\nthere she bade the old man stay, until she should return to him. Then\nwith her comely figure hidden by a dirty old woman's cloak, and her fair\nyoung face defaced by patches and by liniments, so that none might covet\nher, she addressed the young man at the gate in a cracked and trembling\nvoice; and they were scarcely civil to the \"old hag,\" as they called\nher. She said that she bore important tidings for Sir Counsellor\nhimself, and must be conducted to him. To him accordingly she was led,\nwithout even any hoodwinking, for she had spectacles over her eyes, and\nmade believe not to see ten yards.\n\nShe found Sir Counsellor at home, and when the rest were out of sight,\nthrew off all disguise to him, flashing forth as a lovely young woman,\nfrom all her wraps and disfigurements. She flung her patches on the\nfloor, amid the old man's laughter, and let her tucked-up hair come\ndown; and then went up and kissed him.\n\n\"Worthy and reverend Counsellor, I have a favour to ask,\" she began.\n\n\"So I should think from your proceedings,\"--the old man\ninterrupted--\"ah, if I were half my age\"--\n\n\"If you were, I would not sue so. But most excellent Counsellor, you owe\nme some amends, you know, for the way in which you robbed me.\"\n\n\"Beyond a doubt I do, my dear. You have put it rather strongly; and it\nmight offend some people. Nevertheless I own my debt, having so fair a\ncreditor.\"\n\n\"And do you remember how you slept, and how much we made of you, and\nwould have seen you home, sir; only you did not wish it?\"\n\n\"And for excellent reasons, child. My best escort was in my cloak, after\nwe made the cream to rise. Ha, ha! The unholy spell. My pretty child,\nhas it injured you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fear it has,\" said Annie; \"or whence can all my ill luck come?\"\nAnd here she showed some signs of crying, knowing that Counsellor hated\nit.\n\n\"You shall not have ill luck, my dear. I have heard all about your\nmarriage to a very noble highwayman. Ah, you made a mistake in that; you\nwere worthy of a Doone, my child; your frying was a blessing meant for\nthose who can appreciate.\"\n\n\"My husband can appreciate,\" she answered very proudly; \"but what I wish\nto know is this, will you try to help me?\"\n\nThe Counsellor answered that he would do so, if her needs were moderate;\nwhereupon she opened her meaning to him, and told of all her anxieties.\nConsidering that Lorna was gone, and her necklace in his possession, and\nthat I (against whom alone of us the Doones could bear any malice) would\nbe out of the way all the while, the old man readily undertook that\nour house should not be assaulted, nor our property molested, until\nmy return. And to the promptitude of his pledge, two things perhaps\ncontributed, namely, that he knew not how we were stripped of all\ndefenders, and that some of his own forces were away in the rebel camp.\nFor (as I learned thereafter) the Doones being now in direct feud with\nthe present Government, and sure to be crushed if that prevailed, had\nresolved to drop all religious questions, and cast in their lot with\nMonmouth. And the turbulent youths, being long restrained from their\nwonted outlet for vehemence, by the troopers in the neighbourhood, were\nonly too glad to rush forth upon any promise of blows and excitement.\n\nHowever, Annie knew little of this, but took the Counsellor's pledge as\na mark of especial favour in her behalf (which it may have been to some\nextent), and thanked him for it most heartily, and felt that he had\nearned the necklace; while he, like an ancient gentleman, disclaimed all\nobligation, and sent her under an escort safe to her own cart again.\nBut Annie, repassing the sentinels, with her youth restored and blooming\nwith the flush of triumph, went up to them very gravely, and said,\n\"The old hag wishes you good-evening, gentlemen\"; and so made her best\ncurtsey.\n\nNow, look at it as I would, there was no excuse left for me, after the\npromise given. Dear Annie had not only cheated the Doones, but also had\ngotten the best of me, by a pledge to a thing impossible. And I bitterly\nsaid, \"I am not like Lorna: a pledge once given, I keep it.\"\n\n\"I will not have a word against Lorna,\" cried Annie; \"I will answer for\nher truth as surely as I would for my own or yours, John.\" And with that\nshe vanquished me.\n\nBut when my poor mother heard that I was committed, by word of honour,\nto a wild-goose chase, among the rebels, after that runagate Tom Faggus,\nshe simply stared, and would not believe it. For lately I had joked with\nher, in a little style of jerks, as people do when out of sorts; and\nshe, not understanding this, and knowing jokes to be out of my power,\nwould only look, and sigh, and toss, and hope that I meant nothing. At\nlast, however, we convinced her that I was in earnest, and must be off\nin the early morning, and leave John Fry with the hay crop.\n\nThen mother was ready to fall upon Annie, as not content with disgracing\nus, by wedding a man of new honesty (if indeed of any), but laying traps\nto catch her brother, and entangle him perhaps to his death, for the\nsake of a worthless fellow; and \"felon\"--she was going to say, as by the\nshape of her lips I knew. But I laid my hand upon dear mother's lips;\nbecause what must be, must be; and if mother and daughter stayed at\nhome, better in love than in quarrelling.\n\nRight early in the morning, I was off, without word to any one; knowing\nthat mother and sister mine had cried each her good self to sleep;\nrelenting when the light was out, and sorry for hard words and thoughts;\nand yet too much alike in nature to understand each other. Therefore\nI took good Kickums, who (although with one eye spoiled) was worth ten\nsweet-tempered horses, to a man who knew how to manage him; and being\nwell charged both with bacon and powder, forth I set on my wild-goose\nchase.\n\nFor this I claim no bravery. I cared but little what came of it;\nsave for mother's sake, and Annie's, and the keeping of the farm, and\ndiscomfiture of the Snowes, and lamenting of Lorna at my death, if die I\nmust in a lonesome manner, not found out till afterwards, and bleaching\nbones left to weep over. However, I had a little kettle, and a pound and\na half of tobacco, and two dirty pipes and a clean one; also a bit of\nclothes for change, also a brisket of hung venison, and four loaves of\nfarmhouse bread, and of the upper side of bacon a stone and a half it\nmight be--not to mention divers small things for campaigning, which may\ncome in handily, when no one else has gotten them.\n\nWe went away in merry style; my horse being ready for anything, and I\nonly glad of a bit of change, after months of working and brooding; with\nno content to crown the work; no hope to hatch the brooding; or\nwithout hatching to reckon it. Who could tell but what Lorna might be\ndiscovered, or at any rate heard of, before the end of this campaign; if\ncampaign it could be called of a man who went to fight nobody, only\nto redeem a runagate? And vexed as I was about the hay, and the\nhunch-backed ricks John was sure to make (which spoil the look of a\nfarm-yard), still even this was better than to have the mows and houses\nfired, as I had nightly expected, and been worn out with the worry of\nit.\n\nYet there was one thing rather unfavourable to my present enterprise,\nnamely, that I knew nothing of the country I was bound to, nor even in\nwhat part of it my business might be supposed to lie. For beside the\nuncertainty caused by the conflict of reports, it was likely that King\nMonmouth's army would be moving from place to place, according to the\nprospect of supplies and of reinforcements. However, there would arise\nmore chance of getting news as I went on: and my road being towards the\neast and south, Dulverton would not lie so very far aside of it, but\nwhat it might be worth a visit, both to collect the latest tidings, and\nto consult the maps and plans in Uncle Reuben's parlour. Therefore I\ndrew the off-hand rein, at the cross-road on the hills, and made for\nthe town; expecting perhaps to have breakfast with Master Huckaback, and\nRuth, to help and encourage us. This little maiden was now become a very\ngreat favourite with me, having long outgrown, no doubt, her childish\nfancies and follies, such as my mother and Annie had planted under her\nsoft brown hair. It had been my duty, as well as my true interest (for\nUncle Ben was more and more testy, as he went on gold-digging), to ride\nthither, now and again, to inquire what the doctor thought of her. Not\nthat her wounds were long in healing, but that people can scarcely\nbe too careful and too inquisitive, after a great horse-bite. And she\nalways let me look at the arm, as I had been first doctor; and she held\nit up in a graceful manner, curving at the elbow, and with a sweep of\nwhite roundness going to a wrist the size of my thumb or so, and\nwithout any thimble-top standing forth, such as even our Annie had. But\ngradually all I could see, above the elbow, where the bite had been,\nwas very clear, transparent skin, with very firm sweet flesh below, and\nthree little blue marks as far asunder as the prongs of a toasting-fork,\nand no deeper than where a twig has chafed the peel of a waxen apple.\nAnd then I used to say in fun, as the children do, \"Shall I kiss it, to\nmake it well, dear?\"\n\nNow Ruth looked very grave indeed, upon hearing of this my enterprise;\nand crying, said she could almost cry, for the sake of my dear mother.\nDid I know the risks and chances, not of the battlefield alone, but\nof the havoc afterwards; the swearing away of innocent lives, and the\nhurdle, and the hanging? And if I would please not to laugh (which was\nso unkind of me), had I never heard of imprisonments, and torturing with\nthe cruel boot, and selling into slavery, where the sun and the lash\noutvied one another in cutting a man to pieces? I replied that of all\nthese things I had heard, and would take especial care to steer me free\nof all of them. My duty was all that I wished to do; and none could harm\nme for doing that. And I begged my cousin to give me good-speed, instead\nof talking dolefully. Upon this she changed her manner wholly, becoming\nso lively and cheerful that I was convinced of her indifference, and\nsurprised even more than gratified.\n\n\"Go and earn your spurs, Cousin Ridd,\" she said: \"you are strong enough\nfor anything. Which side is to have the benefit of your doughty arm?\"\n\n\"Have I not told you, Ruth,\" I answered, not being fond of this kind of\ntalk, more suitable for Lizzie, \"that I do not mean to join either side,\nthat is to say, until--\"\n\n\"Until, as the common proverb goes, you know which way the cat will\njump. Oh, John Ridd! Oh, John Ridd!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" said I: \"what a hurry you are in! I am for the\nKing of course.\"\n\n\"But not enough to fight for him. Only enough to vote, I suppose, or\ndrink his health, or shout for him.\"\n\n\"I can't make you out to-day, Cousin Ruth; you are nearly as bad as\nLizzie. You do not say any bitter things, but you seem to mean them.\"\n\n\"No, cousin, think not so of me. It is far more likely that I say them,\nwithout meaning them.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, it is not like you. And I know not what I can have done in any\nway, to vex you.\"\n\n\"Dear me, nothing, Cousin Ridd; you never do anything to vex me.\"\n\n\"Then I hope I shall do something now, Ruth, when I say good-bye. God\nknows if we ever shall meet again, Ruth: but I hope we may.\"\n\n\"To be sure we shall,\" she answered in her brightest manner. \"Try not\nto look wretched, John: you are as happy as a Maypole.\"\n\n\"And you as a rose in May,\" I said; \"and pretty nearly as pretty. Give\nmy love to Uncle Ben; and I trust him to keep on the winning side.\"\n\n\"Of that you need have no misgivings. Never yet has he failed of it.\nNow, Cousin Ridd, why go you not? You hurried me so at breakfast time?\"\n\n\"My only reason for waiting, Ruth, is that you have not kissed me, as\nyou are almost bound to do, for the last time perhaps of seeing me.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that is all, just fetch the stool; and I will do my best,\ncousin.\"\n\n\"I pray you be not so vexatious; you always used to do it nicely,\nwithout any stool, Ruth.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you are grown since then, and become a famous man, John Ridd,\nand a member of the nobility. Go your way, and win your spurs. I want no\nlip-service.\"\n\nBeing at the end of my wits, I did even as she ordered me. At least I\nhad no spurs to win, because there were big ones on my boots, paid for\nin the Easter bill, and made by a famous saddler, so as never to clog\nwith marsh-weed, but prick as hard as any horse, in reason, could\ndesire. And Kickums never wanted spurs; but always went tail-foremost,\nif anybody offered them for his consideration.\n\n[Illustration: 595.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\nSLAUGHTER IN THE MARSHES\n\n[Illustration: 596.jpg James I.]\n\nWe rattled away at a merry pace, out of the town of Dulverton; my horse\nbeing gaily fed, and myself quite fit again for going. Of course I was\npuzzled about Cousin Ruth; for her behaviour was not at all such as I\nhad expected; and indeed I had hoped for a far more loving and moving\nfarewell than I got from her. But I said to myself, \"It is useless ever\nto count upon what a woman will do; and I think that I must have vexed\nher, almost as much as she vexed me. And now to see what comes of\nit.\" So I put my horse across the moorland; and he threw his chest out\nbravely.\n\nNow if I tried to set down at length all the things that happened to me,\nupon this adventure, every in and out, and up and down, and to and fro,\nthat occupied me, together with the things I saw, and the things I heard\nof, however much the wiser people might applaud my narrative, it is\nlikely enough that idle readers might exclaim, \"What ails this man?\nKnows he not that men of parts and of real understanding, have told\nus all we care to hear of that miserable business. Let him keep to his\nfarm, and his bacon, and his wrestling, and constant feeding.\"\n\nFearing to meet with such rebuffs (which after my death would vex me), I\nwill try to set down only what is needful for my story, and the clearing\nof my character, and the good name of our parish. But the manner in\nwhich I was bandied about, by false information, from pillar to post, or\nat other times driven quite out of my way by the presence of the King's\nsoldiers, may be known by the names of the following towns, to which\nI was sent in succession, Bath, Frome, Wells, Wincanton, Glastonbury,\nShepton, Bradford, Axbridge, Somerton, and Bridgwater.\n\nThis last place I reached on a Sunday night, the fourth or fifth of\nJuly, I think--or it might be the sixth, for that matter; inasmuch as I\nhad been too much worried to get the day of the month at church. Only I\nknow that my horse and myself were glad to come to a decent place, where\nmeat and corn could be had for money; and being quite weary of wandering\nabout, we hoped to rest there a little.\n\nOf this, however, we found no chance, for the town was full of the good\nDuke's soldiers; if men may be called so, the half of whom had never\nbeen drilled, nor had fired a gun. And it was rumoured among them,\nthat the \"popish army,\" as they called it, was to be attacked that very\nnight, and with God's assistance beaten. However, by this time I had\nbeen taught to pay little attention to rumours; and having sought vainly\nfor Tom Faggus among these poor rustic warriors, I took to my hostel;\nand went to bed, being as weary as weary can be.\n\nFalling asleep immediately, I took heed of nothing; although the town\nwas all alive, and lights had come glancing, as I lay down, and shouts\nmaking echo all round my room. But all I did was to bolt the door; not\nan inch would I budge, unless the house, and even my bed, were on fire.\nAnd so for several hours I lay, in the depth of the deepest slumber,\nwithout even a dream on its surface; until I was roused and awakened at\nlast by a pushing, and pulling, and pinching, and a plucking of hair out\nby the roots. And at length, being able to open mine eyes, I saw the old\nlandlady, with a candle, heavily wondering at me.\n\n\"Can't you let me alone?\" I grumbled. \"I have paid for my bed, mistress;\nand I won't get up for any one.\"\n\n\"Would to God, young man,\" she answered, shaking me as hard as ever,\n\"that the popish soldiers may sleep this night, only half as strong as\nthou dost! Fie on thee, fie on thee! Get up, and go fight; we can hear\nthe battle already; and a man of thy size mought stop a cannon.\"\n\n\"I would rather stop a-bed,\" said I; \"what have I to do with fighting? I\nam for King James, if any.\"\n\n\"Then thou mayest even stop a-bed,\" the old woman muttered sulkily. \"A\nwould never have laboured half an hour to awake a Papisher. But hearken\nyou one thing, young man; Zummerzett thou art, by thy brogue; or at\nleast by thy understanding of it; no Zummerzett maid will look at thee,\nin spite of thy size and stature, unless thou strikest a blow this\nnight.\"\n\n\"I lack no Zummerzett maid, mistress: I have a fairer than your brown\nthings; and for her alone would I strike a blow.\"\n\nAt this the old woman gave me up, as being beyond correction: and\nit vexed me a little that my great fame had not reached so far as\nBridgwater, when I thought that it went to Bristowe. But those people in\nEast Somerset know nothing about wrestling. Devon is the headquarters\nof the art; and Devon is the county of my chief love. Howbeit, my vanity\nwas moved, by this slur upon it--for I had told her my name was John\nRidd, when I had a gallon of ale with her, ere ever I came upstairs; and\nshe had nodded, in such a manner, that I thought she knew both name\nand fame--and here was I, not only shaken, pinched, and with many hairs\npulled out, in the midst of my first good sleep for a week, but also\nabused, and taken amiss, and (which vexed me most of all) unknown.\n\nNow there is nothing like vanity to keep a man awake at night, however\nhe be weary; and most of all, when he believes that he is doing\nsomething great--this time, if never done before--yet other people will\nnot see, except what they may laugh at; and so be far above him, and\nsleep themselves the happier. Therefore their sleep robs his own; for\nall things play so, in and out (with the godly and ungodly ever moving\nin a balance, as they have done in my time, almost every year or two),\nall things have such nice reply of produce to the call for it, and such\na spread across the world, giving here and taking there, yet on the\nwhole pretty even, that haply sleep itself has but a certain stock,\nand keeps in hand, and sells to flattered (which can pay) that which\nflattened vanity cannot pay, and will not sue for.\n\nBe that as it may, I was by this time wide awake, though much aggrieved\nat feeling so, and through the open window heard the distant roll of\nmusketry, and the beating of drums, with a quick rub-a-dub, and the\n\"come round the corner\" of trumpet-call. And perhaps Tom Faggus might be\nthere, and shot at any moment, and my dear Annie left a poor widow, and\nmy godson Jack an orphan, without a tooth to help him.\n\nTherefore I reviled myself for all my heavy laziness; and partly through\ngood honest will, and partly through the stings of pride, and yet a\nlittle perhaps by virtue of a young man's love of riot, up I arose, and\ndressed myself, and woke Kickums (who was snoring), and set out to see\nthe worst of it. The sleepy hostler scratched his poll, and could not\ntell me which way to take; what odds to him who was King, or Pope, so\nlong as he paid his way, and got a bit of bacon on Sunday? And would I\nplease to remember that I had roused him up at night, and the quality\nalways made a point of paying four times over for a man's loss of\nhis beauty-sleep. I replied that his loss of beauty-sleep was rather\nimproving to a man of so high complexion; and that I, being none of the\nquality, must pay half-quality prices: and so I gave him double fee, as\nbecame a good farmer; and he was glad to be quit of Kickums; as I saw by\nthe turn of his eye, while going out at the archway.\n\nAll this was done by lanthorn light, although the moon was high and\nbold; and in the northern heaven, flags and ribbons of a jostling\npattern; such as we often have in autumn, but in July very rarely. Of\nthese Master Dryden has spoken somewhere, in his courtly manner; but of\nhim I think so little--because by fashion preferred to Shakespeare--that\nI cannot remember the passage; neither is it a credit to him.\n\nTherefore I was guided mainly by the sound of guns and trumpets, in\nriding out of the narrow ways, and into the open marshes. And thus I\nmight have found my road, in spite of all the spread of water, and the\nglaze of moonshine; but that, as I followed sound (far from hedge or\ncauseway), fog (like a chestnut-tree in blossom, touched with moonlight)\nmet me. Now fog is a thing that I understand, and can do with well\nenough, where I know the country; but here I had never been before. It\nwas nothing to our Exmoor fogs; not to be compared with them; and all\nthe time one could see the moon; which we cannot do in our fogs; nor\neven the sun, for a week together. Yet the gleam of water always makes\nthe fog more difficult: like a curtain on a mirror; none can tell the\nboundaries.\n\nAnd here we had broad-water patches, in and out, inlaid on land, like\nmother-of-pearl in brown Shittim wood. To a wild duck, born and bred\nthere, it would almost be a puzzle to find her own nest amongst us; what\nchance then had I and Kickums, both unused to marsh and mere? Each time\nwhen we thought that we must be right, now at last, by track or passage,\nand approaching the conflict, with the sounds of it waxing nearer,\nsuddenly a break of water would be laid before us, with the moon looking\nmildly over it, and the northern lights behind us, dancing down the\nlines of fog.\n\nIt was an awful thing, I say (and to this day I remember it), to hear\nthe sounds of raging fight, and the yells of raving slayers, and the\nhowls of poor men stricken hard, and shattered from wrath to wailing;\nthen suddenly the dead low hush, as of a soul departing, and spirits\nkneeling over it. Through the vapour of the earth, and white breath of\nthe water, and beneath the pale round moon (bowing as the drift went\nby), all this rush and pause of fear passed or lingered on my path.\n\nAt last, when I almost despaired of escaping from this tangle of spongy\nbanks, and of hazy creeks, and reed-fringe, my horse heard the neigh\nof a fellow-horse, and was only too glad to answer it; upon which the\nother, having lost its rider, came up and pricked his ears at us, and\ngazed through the fog very steadfastly. Therefore I encouraged him with\na soft and genial whistle, and Kickums did his best to tempt him with a\nsnort of inquiry. However, nothing would suit that nag, except to enjoy\nhis new freedom; and he capered away with his tail set on high, and the\nstirrup-irons clashing under him. Therefore, as he might know the way,\nand appeared to have been in the battle, we followed him very carefully;\nand he led us to a little hamlet, called (as I found afterwards) West\nZuyland, or Zealand, so named perhaps from its situation amid this\ninland sea.\n\nHere the King's troops had been quite lately, and their fires were still\nburning; but the men themselves had been summoned away by the night\nattack of the rebels. Hence I procured for my guide a young man who knew\nthe district thoroughly, and who led me by many intricate ways to the\nrear of the rebel army. We came upon a broad open moor striped with\nsullen water courses, shagged with sedge, and yellow iris, and in the\ndrier part with bilberries. For by this time it was four o'clock, and\nthe summer sun, rising wanly, showed us all the ghastly scene.\n\nWould that I had never been there! Often in the lonely hours, even now\nit haunts me: would, far more, that the piteous thing had never been\ndone in England! Flying men, flung back from dreams of victory and\nhonour, only glad to have the luck of life and limbs to fly with,\nmud-bedraggled, foul with slime, reeking both with sweat and blood,\nwhich they could not stop to wipe, cursing, with their pumped-out lungs,\nevery stick that hindered them, or gory puddle that slipped the step,\nscarcely able to leap over the corses that had dragged to die. And to\nsee how the corses lay; some, as fair as death in sleep; with the smile\nof placid valour, and of noble manhood, hovering yet on the silent lips.\nThese had bloodless hands put upwards, white as wax, and firm as death,\nclasped (as on a monument) in prayer for dear ones left behind, or in\nhigh thanksgiving. And of these men there was nothing in their broad\nblue eyes to fear. But others were of different sort; simple fellows\nunused to pain, accustomed to the bill-hook, perhaps, or rasp of the\nknuckles in a quick-set hedge, or making some to-do at breakfast, over a\nthumb cut in sharpening a scythe, and expecting their wives to make more\nto-do. Yet here lay these poor chaps, dead; dead, after a deal of pain,\nwith little mind to bear it, and a soul they had never thought of; gone,\ntheir God alone knows whither; but to mercy we may trust. Upon these\nthings I cannot dwell; and none I trow would ask me: only if a plain man\nsaw what I saw that morning, he (if God had blessed him with the heart\nthat is in most of us) must have sickened of all desire to be great\namong mankind.\n\nSeeing me riding to the front (where the work of death went on among\nthe men of true English pluck; which, when moved, no farther moves), the\nfugitives called out to me, in half a dozen dialects, to make no utter\nfool of myself; for the great guns were come, and the fight was over;\nall the rest was slaughter.\n\n\"Arl oop wi Moonmo,\" shouted one big fellow, a miner of the Mendip\nhills, whose weapon was a pickaxe: \"na oose to vaight na moor. Wend thee\nhame, yoong mon agin.\"\n\nUpon this I stopped my horse, desiring not to be shot for nothing; and\neager to aid some poor sick people, who tried to lift their arms to\nme. And this I did to the best of my power, though void of skill in\nthe business; and more inclined to weep with them than to check their\nweeping. While I was giving a drop of cordial from my flask to one poor\nfellow, who sat up, while his life was ebbing, and with slow insistence\nurged me, when his broken voice would come, to tell his wife (whose name\nI knew not) something about an apple-tree, and a golden guinea stored in\nit, to divide among six children--in the midst of this I felt warm lips\nlaid against my cheek quite softly, and then a little push; and behold\nit was a horse leaning over me! I arose in haste, and there stood\nWinnie, looking at me with beseeching eyes, enough to melt a heart of\nstone. Then seeing my attention fixed she turned her head, and glanced\nback sadly toward the place of battle, and gave a little wistful neigh:\nand then looked me full in the face again, as much as to say, \"Do you\nunderstand?\" while she scraped with one hoof impatiently. If ever a\nhorse tried hard to speak, it was Winnie at that moment. I went to her\nside and patted her; but that was not what she wanted. Then I offered to\nleap into the empty saddle; but neither did that seem good to her: for\nshe ran away toward the part of the field at which she had been glancing\nback, and then turned round, and shook her mane, entreating me to follow\nher.\n\nUpon this I learned from the dying man where to find his apple-tree, and\npromised to add another guinea to the one in store for his children; and\nso, commending him to God, I mounted my own horse again, and to Winnie's\ngreat delight, professed myself at her service. With her ringing silvery\nneigh, such as no other horse of all I ever knew could equal, she at\nonce proclaimed her triumph, and told her master (or meant to tell, if\ndeath should not have closed his ears) that she was coming to his aid,\nand bringing one who might be trusted, of the higher race that kill.\n\nA cannon-bullet (fired low, and ploughing the marsh slowly) met poor\nWinnie front to front; and she, being as quick as thought, lowered her\nnose to sniff at it. It might be a message from her master; for it made\na mournful noise. But luckily for Winnie's life, a rise of wet ground\ntook the ball, even under her very nose; and there it cut a splashy\ngroove, missing her off hindfoot by an inch, and scattering black mud\nover her. It frightened me much more than Winnie; of that I am quite\ncertain: because though I am firm enough, when it comes to a real\ntussle, and the heart of a fellow warms up and tells him that he must go\nthrough with it; yet I never did approve of making a cold pie of death.\n\nTherefore, with those reckless cannons, brazen-mouthed, and bellowing,\ntwo furlongs off, or it might be more (and the more the merrier), I\nwould have given that year's hay-crop for a bit of a hill, or a thicket\nof oaks, or almost even a badger's earth. People will call me a coward\nfor this (especially when I had made up my mind, that life was not worth\nhaving without any sign of Lorna); nevertheless, I cannot help it: those\nwere my feelings; and I set them down, because they made a mark on me.\nAt Glen Doone I had fought, even against cannon, with some spirit and\nfury: but now I saw nothing to fight about; but rather in every poor\ndoubled corpse, a good reason for not fighting. So, in cold blood riding\non, and yet ashamed that a man should shrink where a horse went bravely,\nI cast a bitter blame upon the reckless ways of Winnie.\n\nNearly all were scattered now. Of the noble countrymen (armed with\nscythe or pickaxe, blacksmith's hammer, or fold-pitcher), who had stood\ntheir ground for hours against blazing musketry (from men whom they\ncould not get at, by reason of the water-dyke), and then against the\ndeadly cannon, dragged by the Bishop's horses to slaughter his own\nsheep; of these sturdy Englishmen, noble in their want of sense, scarce\none out of four remained for the cowards to shoot down. \"Cross the\nrhaine,\" they shouted out, \"cross the rhaine, and coom within rache:\"\nbut the other mongrel Britons, with a mongrel at their head, found it\npleasanter to shoot men who could not shoot in answer, than to meet the\nchance of mischief from strong arms, and stronger hearts.\n\nThe last scene of this piteous play was acting, just as I rode up. Broad\ndaylight, and upstanding sun, winnowing fog from the eastern hills,\nand spreading the moors with freshness; all along the dykes they shone,\nglistened on the willow-trunks, and touched the banks with a hoary gray.\nBut alas! those banks were touched more deeply with a gory red, and\nstrewn with fallen trunks, more woeful than the wreck of trees; while\nhowling, cursing, yelling, and the loathsome reek of carnage, drowned\nthe scent of the new-mown hay, and the carol of the lark.\n\nThen the cavalry of the King, with their horses at full speed, dashed\nfrom either side upon the helpless mob of countrymen. A few pikes\nfeebly levelled met them; but they shot the pikemen, drew swords, and\nhelter-skelter leaped into the shattered and scattering mass. Right and\nleft they hacked and hewed; I could hear the snapping of scythes beneath\nthem, and see the flash of their sweeping swords. How it must end was\nplain enough, even to one like myself, who had never beheld such a\nbattle before. But Winnie led me away to the left; and as I could\nnot help the people, neither stop the slaughter, but found the\ncannon-bullets coming very rudely nigh me, I was only too glad to follow\nher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\nFALLING AMONG LAMBS\n\n[Illustration: 604.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThat faithful creature, whom I began to admire as if she were my own\n(which is no little thing for a man to say of another man's horse),\nstopped in front of a low black shed, such as we call a \"linhay.\" And\nhere she uttered a little greeting, in a subdued and softened voice,\nhoping to obtain an answer, such as her master was wont to give in a\ncheery manner. Receiving no reply, she entered; and I (who could scarce\nkeep up with her, poor Kickums being weary) leaped from his back, and\nfollowed. There I found her sniffing gently, but with great emotion, at\nthe body of Tom Faggus. A corpse poor Tom appeared to be, if ever\nthere was one in this world; and I turned away, and felt unable to keep\naltogether from weeping. But the mare either could not understand, or\nelse would not believe it. She reached her long neck forth, and felt him\nwith her under lip, passing it over his skin as softly as a mother would\ndo to an infant; and then she looked up at me again; as much as to say,\n\"he is all right.\"\n\nUpon this I took courage, and handled poor Tom, which being young I had\nfeared at first to do. He groaned very feebly, as I raised him up; and\nthere was the wound, a great savage one (whether from pike-thrust or\nmusket-ball), gaping and welling in his right side, from which a piece\nseemed to be torn away. I bound it up with some of my linen, so far as I\nknew how; just to stanch the flow of blood, until we could get a doctor.\nThen I gave him a little weak brandy and water, which he drank with the\ngreatest eagerness, and made sign to me for more of it. But not knowing\nhow far it was right to give cordial under the circumstances, I handed\nhim unmixed water that time; thinking that he was too far gone to\nperceive the difference. But herein I wrong Tom Faggus; for he shook his\nhead and frowned at me. Even at the door of death, he would not drink\nwhat Adam drank, by whom came death into the world. So I gave him a\nlittle more eau-de-vie, and he took it most submissively.\n\nAfter that he seemed better, and a little colour came into his cheeks;\nand he looked at Winnie and knew her; and would have her nose in his\nclammy hand, though I thought it not good for either of them. With the\nstay of my arm he sat upright, and faintly looked about him; as if at\nthe end of a violent dream, too much for his power of mind. Then he\nmanaged to whisper, \"Is Winnie hurt?\"\n\n\"As sound as a roach,\" I answered. \"Then so am I,\" said he: \"put me upon\nher back, John; she and I die together.\"\n\nSurprised as I was at this fatalism (for so it appeared to me), of which\nhe had often shown symptoms before (but I took them for mere levity),\nnow I knew not what to do; for it seemed to me a murderous thing to set\nsuch a man on horseback; where he must surely bleed to death, even if he\ncould keep the saddle. But he told me, with many breaks and pauses,\nthat unless I obeyed his orders, he would tear off all my bandages, and\naccept no further aid from me.\n\nWhile I was yet hesitating, a storm of horse at full gallop went by,\ntearing, swearing, bearing away all the country before them. Only a\nlittle pollard hedge kept us from their blood-shot eyes. \"Now is the\ntime,\" said my cousin Tom, so far as I could make out his words; \"on\ntheir heels, I am safe, John, if I have only Winnie under me. Winnie and\nI die together.\"\n\nSeeing this strong bent of his mind, stronger than any pains of death,\nI even did what his feeble eyes sometimes implored, and sometimes\ncommanded. With a strong sash, from his own hot neck, bound and twisted,\ntight as wax, around his damaged waist, I set him upon Winnie's back,\nand placed his trembling feet in stirrups, with a band from one to\nanother, under the good mare's body; so that no swerve could throw him\nout: and then I said, \"Lean forward, Tom; it will stop your hurt from\nbleeding.\" He leaned almost on the neck of the mare, which, as I knew,\nmust close the wound; and the light of his eyes was quite different,\nand the pain of his forehead unstrung itself, as if he felt the undulous\nreadiness of her volatile paces under him.\n\n\"God bless you, John; I am safe,\" he whispered, fearing to open his\nlungs much: \"who can come near my Winnie mare? A mile of her gallop\nis ten years of life. Look out for yourself, John Ridd.\" He sucked his\nlips, and the mare went off, as easy and swift as a swallow.\n\n\"Well,\" thought I, as I looked at Kickums, ignobly cropping up a bit\nof grass, \"I have done a very good thing, no doubt, and ought to be\nthankful to God for the chance. But as for getting away unharmed, with\nall these scoundrels about me, and only a foundered horse to trust\nin--good and spiteful as he is--upon the whole, I begin to think that I\nhave made a fool of myself, according to my habit. No wonder Tom said,\n'Look out for yourself!' I shall look out from a prison window, or\nperhaps even out of a halter. And then, what will Lorna think of me?\"\n\nBeing in this wistful mood, I resolved to abide awhile, even where fate\nhad thrown me; for my horse required good rest no doubt, and was taking\nit even while he cropped, with his hind legs far away stretched out, and\nhis forelegs gathered under him, and his muzzle on the mole-hills; so\nthat he had five supportings from his mother earth. Moreover, the linhay\nitself was full of very ancient cow dung; than which there is no balmier\nand more maiden soporific. Hence I resolved, upon the whole, though\ngrieving about breakfast, to light a pipe, and go to sleep; or at least\nuntil the hot sun should arouse the flies.\n\nI may have slept three hours, or four, or it might be even five--for I\nnever counted time, while sleeping--when a shaking more rude than the\nold landlady's, brought me back to the world again. I looked up, with a\nmighty yawn; and saw twenty, or so, of foot-soldiers.\n\n\"This linhay is not yours,\" I said, when they had quite aroused me, with\ntongue, and hand, and even sword-prick: \"what business have you here,\ngood fellows?\"\n\n\"Business bad for you,\" said one, \"and will lead you to the gallows.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to know the way out again?\" I asked, very quietly, as being\nno braggadocio.\n\n\"We will show thee the way out,\" said one, \"and the way out of the\nworld,\" said another: \"but not the way to heaven,\" said one chap, most\nunlikely to know it: and thereupon they all fell wagging, like a bed of\nclover leaves in the morning, at their own choice humour.\n\n\"Will you pile your arms outside,\" I said, \"and try a bit of fair play\nwith me?\"\n\nFor I disliked these men sincerely, and was fain to teach them a lesson;\nthey were so unchristian in appearance, having faces of a coffee colour,\nand dirty beards half over them. Moreover their dress was outrageous,\nand their address still worse. However, I had wiser let them alone, as\nwill appear afterwards. These savage-looking fellows laughed at the idea\nof my having any chance against some twenty of them: but I knew that\nthe place was in my favour; for my part of it had been fenced off (for\nweaning a calf most likely), so that only two could come at me at once;\nand I must be very much out of training, if I could not manage two of\nthem. Therefore I laid aside my carbine, and the two horse-pistols; and\nthey with many coarse jokes at me went a little way outside, and\nset their weapons against the wall, and turned up their coat sleeves\njauntily; and then began to hesitate.\n\n\"Go you first, Bob,\" I heard them say: \"you are the biggest man of us;\nand Dick the wrestler along of you. Us will back you up, boy.\"\n\n\"I'll warrant I'll draw the badger,\" said Bob; \"and not a tooth will I\nleave him. But mind, for the honour of Kirke's lambs, every man stands\nme a glass of gin.\" Then he, and another man, made a rush, and the\nothers came double-quick-march on their heels. But as Bob ran at me most\nstupidly, not even knowing how to place his hands, I caught him with my\nknuckles at the back of his neck, and with all the sway of my right arm\nsent him over the heads of his comrades. Meanwhile Dick the wrestler had\ngrappled me, expecting to show off his art, of which indeed he had some\nsmall knowledge; but being quite of the light-weights, in a second he\nwas flying after his companion Bob.\n\nNow these two men were hurt so badly, the light one having knocked his\nhead against the lintel of the outer gate, that the rest had no desire\nto encounter the like misfortune. So they hung back whispering; and\nbefore they had made up their minds, I rushed into the midst of them.\nThe suddenness and the weight of my onset took them wholly by surprise;\nand for once in their lives, perhaps, Kirke's lambs were worthy of their\nname. Like a flock of sheep at a dog's attack they fell away, hustling\none another, and my only difficulty was not to tumble over them.\n\nI had taken my carbine out with me, having a fondness for it; but the\ntwo horse-pistols I left behind; and therefore felt good title to take\ntwo from the magazine of the lambs. And with these, and my carbine, I\nleaped upon Kickums, who was now quite glad of a gallop again; and I\nbade adieu to that mongrel lot; yet they had the meanness to shoot at\nme. Thanking God for my deliverance (inasmuch as those men would have\nstrung me up, from a pollard-ash without trial, as I heard them tell\none another, and saw the tree they had settled upon), I ventured to go\nrather fast on my way, with doubt and uneasiness urging me. And now my\nway was home again. Nobody could say but what I had done my duty, and\nrescued Tom (if he could be rescued) from the mischief into which\nhis own perverseness and love of change (rather than deep religious\nconvictions, to which our Annie ascribed his outbreak) had led, or\nseemed likely to lead him. And how proud would my mother be; and--ah\nwell, there was nobody else to be proud of me now.\n\nBut while thinking these things, and desiring my breakfast, beyond any\npower of describing, and even beyond my remembrance, I fell into another\nfold of lambs, from which there was no exit. These, like true crusaders,\nmet me, swaggering very heartily, and with their barrels of cider set,\nlike so many cannon, across the road, over against a small hostel.\n\n\"We have won the victory, my lord King, and we mean to enjoy it. Down\nfrom thy horse, and have a stoup of cider, thou big rebel.\"\n\n\"No rebel am I. My name is John Ridd. I belong to the side of the King:\nand I want some breakfast.\"\n\nThese fellows were truly hospitable; that much will I say for them.\nBeing accustomed to Arab ways, they could toss a grill, or fritter, or\nthe inner meaning of an egg, into any form they pleased, comely and\nvery good to eat; and it led me to think of Annie. So I made the rarest\nbreakfast any man might hope for, after all his troubles; and getting\non with these brown fellows better than could be expected, I craved\npermission to light a pipe, if not disagreeable. Hearing this, they\nroared at me, with a superior laughter, and asked me, whether or not,\nI knew the tobacco-leaf from the chick-weed; and when I was forced to\nanswer no, not having gone into the subject, but being content with\nanything brown, they clapped me on the back and swore they had never\nseen any one like me. Upon the whole this pleased me much; for I do\nnot wish to be taken always as of the common pattern: and so we smoked\nadmirable tobacco--for they would not have any of mine, though very\ncourteous concerning it--and I was beginning to understand a little of\nwhat they told me; when up came those confounded lambs, who had shown\nmore tail than head to me, in the linhay, as I mentioned.\n\nNow these men upset everything. Having been among wrestlers so much as\nmy duty compelled me to be, and having learned the necessity of the rest\nwhich follows the conflict, and the right of discussion which all people\nhave to pay their sixpence to enter; and how they obtrude this right,\nand their wisdom, upon the man who has laboured, until he forgets all\nthe work he did, and begins to think that they did it; having some\nknowledge of this sort of thing, and the flux of minds swimming in\nliquor, I foresaw a brawl, as plainly as if it were Bear Street in\nBarnstaple.\n\nAnd a brawl there was, without any error, except of the men who hit\ntheir friends, and those who defended their enemies. My partners in\nbreakfast and beer-can swore that I was no prisoner, but the best and\nmost loyal subject, and the finest-hearted fellow they had ever the luck\nto meet with. Whereas the men from the linhay swore that I was a rebel\nmiscreant; and have me they would, with a rope's-end ready, in spite\nof every [violent language] who had got drunk at my expense, and been\nmisled by my [strong word] lies.\n\nWhile this fight was going on (and its mere occurrence shows, perhaps,\nthat my conversation in those days was not entirely despicable--else\nwhy should my new friends fight for me, when I had paid for the ale, and\ntherefore won the wrong tense of gratitude?) it was in my power at any\nmoment to take horse and go. And this would have been my wisest plan,\nand a very great saving of money; but somehow I felt as if it would be a\nmean thing to slip off so. Even while I was hesitating, and the men were\nbreaking each other's heads, a superior officer rode up, with his sword\ndrawn, and his face on fire.\n\n\"What, my lambs, my lambs!\" he cried, smiting with the flat of his\nsword; \"is this how you waste my time and my purse, when you ought to be\ncatching a hundred prisoners, worth ten pounds apiece to me? Who is this\nyoung fellow we have here? Speak up, sirrah; what art thou, and how much\nwill thy good mother pay for thee?\"\n\n\"My mother will pay naught for me,\" I answered; while the lambs fell\nback, and glowered at one another: \"so please your worship, I am no\nrebel; but an honest farmer, and well-proved of loyalty.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha; a farmer art thou? Those fellows always pay the best. Good\nfarmer, come to yon barren tree; thou shalt make it fruitful.\"\n\nColonel Kirke made a sign to his men, and before I could think of\nresistance, stout new ropes were flung around me; and with three men on\neither side I was led along very painfully. And now I saw, and repented\ndeeply of my careless folly, in stopping with those boon-companions,\ninstead of being far away. But the newness of their manners to me, and\ntheir mode of regarding the world (differing so much from mine own), as\nwell as the flavour of their tobacco, had made me quite forget my duty\nto the farm and to myself. Yet methought they would be tender to me,\nafter all our speeches: how then was I disappointed, when the men who\nhad drunk my beer, drew on those grievous ropes, twice as hard as the\nmen I had been at strife with! Yet this may have been from no ill will;\nbut simply that having fallen under suspicion of laxity, they were\ncompelled, in self-defence, now to be over-zealous.\n\nNevertheless, however pure and godly might be their motives, I beheld\nmyself in a grievous case, and likely to get the worst of it. For the\nface of the Colonel was hard and stern as a block of bogwood oak; and\nthough the men might pity me and think me unjustly executed, yet they\nmust obey their orders, or themselves be put to death. Therefore I\naddressed myself to the Colonel, in a most ingratiating manner; begging\nhim not to sully the glory of his victory, and dwelling upon my pure\ninnocence, and even good service to our lord the King. But Colonel Kirke\nonly gave command that I should be smitten in the mouth; which office\nBob, whom I had flung so hard out of the linhay, performed with great\nzeal and efficiency. But being aware of the coming smack, I thrust\nforth a pair of teeth; upon which the knuckles of my good friend made a\nmelancholy shipwreck.\n\nIt is not in my power to tell half the thoughts that moved me, when\nwe came to the fatal tree, and saw two men hanging there already, as\ninnocent perhaps as I was, and henceforth entirely harmless. Though\nordered by the Colonel to look steadfastly upon them, I could not bear\nto do so; upon which he called me a paltry coward, and promised my\nbreeches to any man who would spit upon my countenance. This vile\nthing Bob, being angered perhaps by the smarting wound of his knuckles,\nbravely stepped forward to do for me, trusting no doubt to the rope I\nwas led with. But, unluckily as it proved for him, my right arm was free\nfor a moment; and therewith I dealt him such a blow, that he never spake\nagain. For this thing I have often grieved; but the provocation was very\nsore to the pride of a young man; and I trust that God has forgiven me.\nAt the sound and sight of that bitter stroke, the other men drew back;\nand Colonel Kirke, now black in the face with fury and vexation, gave\norders for to shoot me, and cast me into the ditch hard by. The men\nraised their pieces, and pointed at me, waiting for the word to fire;\nand I, being quite overcome by the hurry of these events, and quite\nunprepared to die yet, could only think all upside down about Lorna,\nand my mother, and wonder what each would say to it. I spread my hands\nbefore my eyes, not being so brave as some men; and hoping, in some\nfoolish way, to cover my heart with my elbows. I heard the breath of\nall around, as if my skull were a sounding-board; and knew even how the\ndifferent men were fingering their triggers. And a cold sweat broke all\nover me, as the Colonel, prolonging his enjoyment, began slowly to say,\n\"Fire.\"\n\nBut while he was yet dwelling on the \"F,\" the hoofs of a horse dashed\nout on the road, and horse and horseman flung themselves betwixt me and\nthe gun muzzles. So narrowly was I saved that one man could not check\nhis trigger: his musket went off, and the ball struck the horse on the\nwithers, and scared him exceedingly. He began to lash out with his heels\nall around, and the Colonel was glad to keep clear of him; and the men\nmade excuse to lower their guns, not really wishing to shoot me.\n\n\"How now, Captain Stickles?\" cried Kirke, the more angry because he had\nshown his cowardice; \"dare you, sir, to come betwixt me and my lawful\nprisoner?\"\n\n\"Nay, hearken one moment, Colonel,\" replied my old friend Jeremy; and\nhis damaged voice was the sweetest sound I had heard for many a day;\n\"for your own sake, hearken.\" He looked so full of momentous tidings,\nthat Colonel Kirke made a sign to his men not to shoot me till further\norders; and then he went aside with Stickles, so that in spite of all my\nanxiety I could not catch what passed between them. But I fancied that\nthe name of the Lord Chief-Justice Jeffreys was spoken more than once,\nand with emphasis and deference.\n\n\"Then I leave him in your hands, Captain Stickles,\" said Kirke at last,\nso that all might hear him; and though the news was good for me, the\nsmile of baffled malice made his dark face look most hideous; \"and I\nshall hold you answerable for the custody of this prisoner.\"\n\n\"Colonel Kirke, I will answer for him,\" Master Stickles replied, with a\ngrave bow, and one hand on his breast: \"John Ridd, you are my prisoner.\nFollow me, John Ridd.\"\n\nUpon that, those precious lambs flocked away, leaving the rope still\naround me; and some were glad, and some were sorry, not to see me\nswinging. Being free of my arms again, I touched my hat to Colonel\nKirke, as became his rank and experience; but he did not condescend to\nreturn my short salutation, having espied in the distance a prisoner,\nout of whom he might make money.\n\nI wrung the hand of Jeremy Stickles, for his truth and goodness; and\nhe almost wept (for since his wound he had been a weakened man) as he\nanswered, \"Turn for turn, John. You saved my life from the Doones; and\nby the mercy of God, I have saved you from a far worse company. Let your\nsister Annie know it.\"\n\n[Illustration: 612.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nSUITABLE DEVOTION\n\n[Illustration: 613.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nNow Kickums was not like Winnie, any more than a man is like a woman;\nand so he had not followed my fortunes, except at his own distance. No\ndoubt but what he felt a certain interest in me; but his interest was\nnot devotion; and man might go his way and be hanged, rather than horse\nwould meet hardship. Therefore, seeing things to be bad, and his master\ninvolved in trouble, what did this horse do but start for the ease and\ncomfort of Plover's Barrows, and the plentiful ration of oats abiding\nin his own manger. For this I do not blame him. It is the manner of\nmankind.\n\nBut I could not help being very uneasy at the thought of my mother's\ndiscomfort and worry, when she should spy this good horse coming home,\nwithout any master, or rider, and I almost hoped that he might be caught\n(although he was worth at least twenty pounds) by some of the King's\ntroopers, rather than find his way home, and spread distress among\nour people. Yet, knowing his nature, I doubted if any could catch, or\ncatching would keep him.\n\nJeremy Stickles assured me, as we took the road to Bridgwater, that the\nonly chance for my life (if I still refused to fly) was to obtain\nan order forthwith, for my despatch to London, as a suspected person\nindeed, but not found in open rebellion, and believed to be under the\npatronage of the great Lord Jeffreys. \"For,\" said he, \"in a few hours\ntime you would fall into the hands of Lord Feversham, who has won this\nfight, without seeing it, and who has returned to bed again, to have his\nbreakfast more comfortably. Now he may not be quite so savage perhaps\nas Colonel Kirke, nor find so much sport in gibbeting; but he is equally\npitiless, and his price no doubt would be higher.\"\n\n\"I will pay no price whatever,\" I answered, \"neither will I fly. An hour\nagone I would have fled for the sake of my mother, and the farm. But\nnow that I have been taken prisoner, and my name is known, if I fly,\nthe farm is forfeited; and my mother and sister must starve. Moreover, I\nhave done no harm; I have borne no weapons against the King, nor desired\nthe success of his enemies. I like not that the son of a bona-roba\nshould be King of England; neither do I count the Papists any worse than\nwe are. If they have aught to try me for, I will stand my trial.\"\n\n\"Then to London thou must go, my son. There is no such thing as trial\nhere: we hang the good folk without it, which saves them much anxiety.\nBut quicken thy step, good John; I have influence with Lord Churchill,\nand we must contrive to see him, ere the foreigner falls to work again.\nLord Churchill is a man of sense, and imprisons nothing but his money.\"\n\nWe were lucky enough to find this nobleman, who has since become so\nfamous by his foreign victories. He received us with great civility;\nand looked at me with much interest, being a tall and fine young\nman himself, but not to compare with me in size, although far better\nfavoured. I liked his face well enough, but thought there was something\nfalse about it. He put me a few keen questions, such as a man not\nassured of honesty might have found hard to answer; and he stood in a\nvery upright attitude, making the most of his figure.\n\nI saw nothing to be proud of, at the moment, in this interview; but\nsince the great Duke of Marlborough rose to the top of glory, I have\ntried to remember more about him than my conscience quite backs up.\nHow should I know that this man would be foremost of our kingdom in\nfive-and-twenty years or so; and not knowing, why should I heed\nhim, except for my own pocket? Nevertheless, I have been so\ncross-questioned--far worse than by young Lord Churchill--about His\nGrace the Duke of Marlborough, and what he said to me, and what I said\nthen, and how His Grace replied to that, and whether he smiled like\nanother man, or screwed up his lips like a button (as our parish tailor\nsaid of him), and whether I knew from the turn of his nose that no\nFrenchman could stand before him: all these inquiries have worried me\nso, ever since the Battle of Blenheim, that if tailors would only print\nupon waistcoats, I would give double price for a vest bearing\nthis inscription, \"No information can be given about the Duke of\nMarlborough.\"\n\nNow this good Lord Churchill--for one might call him good, by comparison\nwith the very bad people around him--granted without any long hesitation\nthe order for my safe deliverance to the Court of King's Bench at\nWestminster; and Stickles, who had to report in London, was empowered to\nconvey me, and made answerable for producing me. This arrangement would\nhave been entirely to my liking, although the time of year was bad for\nleaving Plover's Barrows so; but no man may quite choose his times,\nand on the while I would have been quite content to visit London, if my\nmother could be warned that nothing was amiss with me, only a mild, and\nas one might say, nominal captivity. And to prevent her anxiety, I did\nmy best to send a letter through good Sergeant Bloxham, of whom I heard\nas quartered with Dumbarton's regiment at Chedzuy. But that regiment was\naway in pursuit; and I was forced to entrust my letter to a man who said\nthat he knew him, and accepted a shilling to see to it.\n\nFor fear of any unpleasant change, we set forth at once for London; and\ntruly thankful may I be that God in His mercy spared me the sight of\nthe cruel and bloody work with which the whole country reeked and howled\nduring the next fortnight. I have heard things that set my hair on end,\nand made me loathe good meat for days; but I make a point of setting\ndown only the things which I saw done; and in this particular case, not\nmany will quarrel with my decision. Enough, therefore, that we rode on\n(for Stickles had found me a horse at last) as far as Wells, where we\nslept that night; and being joined in the morning by several troopers\nand orderlies, we made a slow but safe journey to London, by way of Bath\nand Reading.\n\nThe sight of London warmed my heart with various emotions, such as a\ncordial man must draw from the heart of all humanity. Here there are\nquick ways and manners, and the rapid sense of knowledge, and the power\nof understanding, ere a word be spoken. Whereas at Oare, you must say a\nthing three times, very slowly, before it gets inside the skull of the\ngood man you are addressing. And yet we are far more clever there than\nin any parish for fifteen miles.\n\nBut what moved me most, when I saw again the noble oil and tallow of the\nLondon lights, and the dripping torches at almost every corner, and\nthe handsome signboards, was the thought that here my Lorna lived, and\nwalked, and took the air, and perhaps thought now and then of the old\ndays in the good farm-house. Although I would make no approach to her,\nany more than she had done to me (upon which grief I have not dwelt, for\nfear of seeming selfish), yet there must be some large chance, or the\nlittle chance might be enlarged, of falling in with the maiden somehow,\nand learning how her mind was set. If against me, all should be over. I\nwas not the man to sigh and cry for love, like a Romeo: none should even\nguess my grief, except my sister Annie.\n\nBut if Lorna loved me still--as in my heart of hearts I hoped--then\nwould I for no one care, except her own delicious self. Rank and title,\nwealth and grandeur, all should go to the winds, before they scared me\nfrom my own true love.\n\nThinking thus, I went to bed in the centre of London town, and was\nbitten so grievously by creatures whose name is \"legion,\" mad with the\ndelight of getting a wholesome farmer among them, that verily I was\nashamed to walk in the courtly parts of the town next day, having lumps\nupon my face of the size of a pickling walnut. The landlord said that\nthis was nothing; and that he expected, in two days at the utmost,\na very fresh young Irishman, for whom they would all forsake me.\nNevertheless, I declined to wait, unless he could find me a hayrick to\nsleep in; for the insects of grass only tickle. He assured me that no\nhayrick could now be found in London; upon which I was forced to leave\nhim, and with mutual esteem we parted.\n\nThe next night I had better luck, being introduced to a decent widow, of\nvery high Scotch origin. That house was swept and garnished so, that\nnot a bit was left to eat, for either man or insect. The change of air\nhaving made me hungry, I wanted something after supper; being quite\nready to pay for it, and showing my purse as a symptom. But the face of\nWidow MacAlister, when I proposed to have some more food, was a thing to\nbe drawn (if it could be drawn further) by our new caricaturist.\n\nTherefore I left her also; for liefer would I be eaten myself than have\nnothing to eat; and so I came back to my old furrier; the which was\na thoroughly hearty man, and welcomed me to my room again, with two\nshillings added to the rent, in the joy of his heart at seeing me. Being\nunder parole to Master Stickles, I only went out betwixt certain hours;\nbecause I was accounted as liable to be called upon; for what purpose\nI knew not, but hoped it might be a good one. I felt it a loss, and\na hindrance to me, that I was so bound to remain at home during the\nsession of the courts of law; for thereby the chance of ever beholding\nLorna was very greatly contracted, if not altogether annihilated. For\nthese were the very hours in which the people of fashion, and the high\nworld, were wont to appear to the rest of mankind, so as to encourage\nthem. And of course by this time, the Lady Lorna was high among people\nof fashion, and was not likely to be seen out of fashionable hours. It\nis true that there were some places of expensive entertainment, at which\nthe better sort of mankind might be seen and studied, in their hours of\nrelaxation, by those of the lower order, who could pay sufficiently. But\nalas, my money was getting low; and the privilege of seeing my betters\nwas more and more denied to me, as my cash drew shorter. For a man must\nhave a good coat at least, and the pockets not wholly empty, before he\ncan look at those whom God has created for his ensample.\n\nHence, and from many other causes--part of which was my own pride--it\nhappened that I abode in London betwixt a month and five weeks' time,\nere ever I saw Lorna. It seemed unfit that I should go, and waylay\nher, and spy on her, and say (or mean to say), \"Lo, here is your poor\nfaithful farmer, a man who is unworthy of you, by means of his common\nbirth; and yet who dares to crawl across your path, that you may pity\nhim. For God's sake show a little pity, though you may not feel it.\"\nSuch behaviour might be comely in a love-lorn boy, a page to some grand\nprincess; but I, John Ridd, would never stoop to the lowering of love\nso.\n\nNevertheless I heard of Lorna, from my worthy furrier, almost every day,\nand with a fine exaggeration. This honest man was one of those who in\nvirtue of their trade, and nicety of behaviour, are admitted into noble\nlife, to take measurements, and show patterns. And while so doing,\nthey contrive to acquire what is to the English mind at once the most\nimportant and most interesting of all knowledge,--the science of being\nable to talk about the titled people. So my furrier (whose name was\nRamsack), having to make robes for peers, and cloaks for their wives and\notherwise, knew the great folk, sham or real, as well as he knew a fox\nor skunk from a wolverine skin.\n\nAnd when, with some fencing and foils of inquiry, I hinted about Lady\nLorna Dugal, the old man's face became so pleasant that I knew her birth\nmust be wondrous high. At this my own countenance fell, I suppose,--for\nthe better she was born, the harder she would be to marry--and mistaking\nmy object, he took me up:--\n\n\"Perhaps you think, Master Ridd, that because her ladyship, Lady Lorna\nDugal, is of Scottish origin, therefore her birth is not as high as of\nour English nobility. If you think so you are wrong, sir. She comes\nnot of the sandy Scotch race, with high cheek-bones, and raw\nshoulder-blades, who set up pillars in their courtyards. But she comes\nof the very best Scotch blood, descended from the Norsemen. Her mother\nwas of the very noblest race, the Lords of Lorne; higher even than the\ngreat Argyle, who has lately made a sad mistake, and paid for it most\nsadly. And her father was descended from the King Dugal, who fought\nagainst Alexander the Great. No, no, Master Ridd; none of your\npromiscuous blood, such as runs in the veins of half our modern\npeerage.\"\n\n\"Why should you trouble yourself about it, Master Ramsack?\" I replied:\n\"let them all go their own ways: and let us all look up to them, whether\nthey come by hook or crook.\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all, my lad. That is not the way to regard it. We\nlook up at the well-born men, and side-ways at the base-born.\"\n\n\"Then we are all base-born ourselves. I will look up to no man, except\nfor what himself has done.\"\n\n\"Come, Master Ridd, you might be lashed from Newgate to Tyburn and back\nagain, once a week, for a twelvemonth, if some people heard you. Keep\nyour tongue more close, young man; or here you lodge no longer; albeit\nI love your company, which smells to me of the hayfield. Ah, I have not\nseen a hayfield for nine-and-twenty years, John Ridd. The cursed moths\nkeep me at home, every day of the summer.\"\n\n\"Spread your furs on the haycocks,\" I answered very boldly: \"the indoor\nmoth cannot abide the presence of the outdoor ones.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" he answered: \"I never thought of that before. And yet I\nhave known such strange things happen in the way of fur, that I can\nwell believe it. If you only knew, John, the way in which they lay their\neggs, and how they work tail-foremost--\"\n\n\"Tell me nothing of the kind,\" I replied, with equal confidence: \"they\ncannot work tail-foremost; and they have no tails to work with.\" For I\nknew a little about grubs, and the ignorance concerning them, which\nwe have no right to put up with. However, not to go into that (for the\nargument lasted a fortnight; and then was only come so far as to begin\nagain), Master Ramsack soon convinced me of the things I knew already;\nthe excellence of Lorna's birth, as well as her lofty place at Court,\nand beauty, and wealth, and elegance. But all these only made me sigh,\nand wish that I were born to them.\n\nFrom Master Ramsack I discovered that the nobleman to whose charge Lady\nLorna had been committed, by the Court of Chancery, was Earl Brandir\nof Lochawe, her poor mother's uncle. For the Countess of Dugal was\ndaughter, and only child, of the last Lord Lorne, whose sister had\nmarried Sir Ensor Doone; while he himself had married the sister of\nEarl Brandir. This nobleman had a country house near the village of\nKensington; and here his niece dwelled with him, when she was not in\nattendance on Her Majesty the Queen, who had taken a liking to her.\nNow since the King had begun to attend the celebration of mass, in the\nchapel at Whitehall--and not at Westminster Abbey, as our gossips had\naverred--he had given order that the doors should be thrown open, so\nthat all who could make interest to get into the antechamber, might see\nthis form of worship. Master Ramsack told me that Lorna was there almost\nevery Sunday; their Majesties being most anxious to have the presence\nof all the nobility of the Catholic persuasion, so as to make a goodly\nshow. And the worthy furrier, having influence with the door-keepers,\nkindly obtained admittance for me, one Sunday, into the antechamber.\n\nHere I took care to be in waiting, before the Royal procession entered;\nbut being unknown, and of no high rank, I was not allowed to stand\nforward among the better people, but ordered back into a corner very\ndark and dismal; the verger remarking, with a grin, that I could see\nover all other heads, and must not set my own so high. Being frightened\nto find myself among so many people of great rank and gorgeous apparel,\nI blushed at the notice drawn upon me by this uncourteous fellow; and\nsilently fell back into the corner by the hangings.\n\nYou may suppose that my heart beat high, when the King and Queen\nappeared, and entered, followed by the Duke of Norfolk, bearing the\nsword of state, and by several other noblemen, and people of repute.\nThen the doors of the chapel were thrown wide open; and though I\ncould only see a little, being in the corner so, I thought that it was\nbeautiful. Bowers of rich silk were there, and plenty of metal shining,\nand polished wood with lovely carving; flowers too of the noblest kind,\nand candles made by somebody who had learned how to clarify tallow. This\nlast thing amazed me more than all, for our dips never will come clear,\nmelt the mutton-fat how you will. And methought that this hanging of\nflowers about was a pretty thing; for if a man can worship God best of\nall beneath a tree, as the natural instinct is, surely when by fault of\nclimate the tree would be too apt to drip, the very best make-believe is\nto have enough and to spare of flowers; which to the dwellers in London\nseem to have grown on the tree denied them.\n\nBe that as it may, when the King and Queen crossed the threshold, a\nmighty flourish of trumpets arose, and a waving of banners. The Knights\nof the Garter (whoever they be) were to attend that day in state;\nand some went in, and some stayed out, and it made me think of the\ndifference betwixt the ewes and the wethers. For the ewes will go\nwherever you lead them; but the wethers will not, having strong\nopinions, and meaning to abide by them. And one man I noticed was of the\nwethers, to wit the Duke of Norfolk; who stopped outside with the sword\nof state, like a beadle with a rapping-rod. This has taken more to tell\nthan the time it happened in. For after all the men were gone, some\nto this side, some to that, according to their feelings, a number of\nladies, beautifully dressed, being of the Queen's retinue, began to\nenter, and were stared at three times as much as the men had been. And\nindeed they were worth looking at (which men never are to my ideas,\nwhen they trick themselves with gewgaws), but none was so well worth\neye-service as my own beloved Lorna. She entered modestly and shyly,\nwith her eyes upon the ground, knowing the rudeness of the gallants, and\nthe large sum she was priced at. Her dress was of the purest white, very\nsweet and simple, without a line of ornament, for she herself adorned\nit. The way she walked and touched her skirt (rather than seemed to\nhold it up) with a white hand beaming one red rose, this and her stately\nsupple neck, and the flowing of her hair would show, at a distance of a\nhundred yards, that she could be none but Lorna Doone. Lorna Doone of\nmy early love; in the days when she blushed for her name before me\nby reason of dishonesty; but now the Lady Lorna Dugal as far beyond\nreproach as above my poor affection. All my heart, and all my mind,\ngathered themselves upon her. Would she see me, or would she pass? Was\nthere instinct in our love?\n\nBy some strange chance she saw me. Or was it through our destiny? While\nwith eyes kept sedulously on the marble floor, to shun the weight of\nadmiration thrust too boldly on them, while with shy quick steps she\npassed, some one (perhaps with purpose) trod on the skirt of her clear\nwhite dress,--with the quickness taught her by many a scene of danger,\nshe looked up, and her eyes met mine.\n\nAs I gazed upon her, steadfastly, yearningly, yet with some reproach,\nand more of pride than humility, she made me one of the courtly bows\nwhich I do so much detest; yet even that was sweet and graceful, when my\nLorna did it. But the colour of her pure clear cheeks was nearly as\ndeep as that of my own, when she went on for the religious work. And the\nshining of her eyes was owing to an unpaid debt of tears.\n\nUpon the whole I was satisfied. Lorna had seen me, and had not\n(according to the phrase of the high world then) even tried to \"cut\" me.\nWhether this low phrase is born of their own stupid meanness, or whether\nit comes of necessity exercised on a man without money, I know not, and\nI care not. But one thing I know right well; any man who \"cuts\" a man\n(except for vice or meanness) should be quartered without quarter.\n\nAll these proud thoughts rose within me as the lovely form of Lorna went\ninside, and was no more seen. And then I felt how coarse I was; how apt\nto think strong thoughts, and so on; without brains to bear me out: even\nas a hen's egg, laid without enough of lime, and looking only a poor\njelly.\n\nNevertheless, I waited on; as my usual manner is. For to be beaten,\nwhile running away, is ten times worse than to face it out, and take\nit, and have done with it. So at least I have always found, because of\nreproach of conscience: and all the things those clever people carried\non inside, at large, made me long for our Parson Bowden that he might\nknow how to act.\n\nWhile I stored up, in my memory, enough to keep our parson going through\nsix pipes on a Saturday night--to have it as right as could be next\nday--a lean man with a yellow beard, too thin for a good Catholic (which\nreligion always fattens), came up to me, working sideways, in the manner\nof a female crab.\n\n\"This is not to my liking,\" I said: \"if aught thou hast, speak plainly;\nwhile they make that horrible noise inside.\"\n\nNothing had this man to say; but with many sighs, because I was not of\nthe proper faith, he took my reprobate hand to save me: and with several\nreligious tears, looked up at me, and winked with one eye. Although the\nskin of my palms was thick, I felt a little suggestion there, as of a\ngentle leaf in spring, fearing to seem too forward. I paid the man, and\nhe went happy; for the standard of heretical silver is purer than that\nof the Catholics.\n\nThen I lifted up my little billet; and in that dark corner read it, with\na strong rainbow of colours coming from the angled light. And in mine\neyes there was enough to make rainbow of strongest sun, as my anger\nclouded off.\n\nNot that it began so well; but that in my heart I knew (ere three lines\nwere through me) that I was with all heart loved--and beyond that, who\nmay need? The darling of my life went on, as if I were of her own rank,\nor even better than she was; and she dotted her \"i\"s, and crossed\nher \"t\"s, as if I were at least a schoolmaster. All of it was done in\npencil; but as plain as plain could be. In my coffin it shall lie, with\nmy ring and something else. Therefore will I not expose it to every man\nwho buys this book, and haply thinks that he has bought me to the bottom\nof my heart. Enough for men of gentle birth (who never are inquisitive)\nthat my love told me, in her letter, just to come and see her.\n\nI ran away, and could not stop. To behold even her, at the moment, would\nhave dashed my fancy's joy. Yet my brain was so amiss, that I must do\nsomething. Therefore to the river Thames, with all speed, I hurried;\nand keeping all my best clothes on (indeed for sake of Lorna), into the\nquiet stream I leaped, and swam as far as London Bridge, and ate nobler\ndinner afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\nLORNA STILL IS LORNA\n\n[Illustration: 623.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nAlthough a man may be as simple as the flowers of the field; knowing\nwhen, but scarcely why, he closes to the bitter wind; and feeling why,\nbut scarcely when, he opens to the genial sun; yet without his questing\nmuch into the capsule of himself--to do which is a misery--he may have a\ngeneral notion how he happens to be getting on.\n\nI felt myself to be getting on better than at any time since the last\nwheat-harvest, as I took the lane to Kensington upon the Monday evening.\nFor although no time was given in my Lorna's letter, I was not inclined\nto wait more than decency required. And though I went and watched\nthe house, decency would not allow me to knock on the Sunday evening,\nespecially when I found at the corner that his lordship was at home.\n\nThe lanes and fields between Charing Cross and the village of\nKensington, are, or were at that time, more than reasonably infested\nwith footpads and with highwaymen. However, my stature and holly club\nkept these fellows from doing more than casting sheep's eyes at me.\nFor it was still broad daylight, and the view of the distant villages,\nChelsea, Battersea, Tyburn, and others, as well as a few large houses,\namong the hams and towards the river, made it seem less lonely.\nTherefore I sang a song in the broadest Exmoor dialect, which caused no\nlittle amazement in the minds of all who met me.\n\nWhen I came to Earl Brandir's house, my natural modesty forbade me to\nappear at the door for guests; therefore I went to the entrance for\nservants and retainers. Here, to my great surprise, who should come\nand let me in but little Gwenny Carfax, whose very existence had almost\nescaped my recollection. Her mistress, no doubt, had seen me coming, and\nsent her to save trouble. But when I offered to kiss Gwenny, in my joy\nand comfort to see a farm-house face again, she looked ashamed, and\nturned away, and would hardly speak to me.\n\nI followed her to a little room, furnished very daintily; and there she\nordered me to wait, in a most ungracious manner. \"Well,\" thought I, \"if\nthe mistress and the maid are alike in temper, better it had been for\nme to abide at Master Ramsack's.\" But almost ere my thought was done, I\nheard the light quick step which I knew as well as \"Watch,\" my dog, knew\nmine; and my breast began to tremble, like the trembling of an arch ere\nthe keystone is put in.\n\nAlmost ere I hoped--for fear and hope were so entangled that they\nhindered one another--the velvet hangings of the doorway parted, with\na little doubt, and then a good face put on it. Lorna, in her perfect\nbeauty, stood before the crimson folds, and her dress was all pure\nwhite, and her cheeks were rosy pink, and her lips were scarlet.\n\nLike a maiden, with skill and sense checking violent impulse, she stayed\nthere for one moment only, just to be admired; and then like a woman,\nshe came to me, seeing how alarmed I was. The hand she offered me I\ntook, and raised it to my lips with fear, as a thing too good for me.\n\"Is that all?\" she whispered; and then her eyes gleamed up at me; and in\nanother instant, she was weeping on my breast.\n\n\"Darling Lorna, Lady Lorna,\" I cried, in astonishment, yet unable but to\nkeep her closer to me, and closer; \"surely, though I love you so, this\nis not as it should be.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is, John. Yes, it is. Nothing else should ever be. Oh, why have\nyou behaved so?\"\n\n\"I am behaving.\" I replied, \"to the very best of my ability. There is no\nother man in the world could hold you so, without kissing you.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you do it, John?\" asked Lorna, looking up at me, with a\nflash of her old fun.\n\nNow this matter, proverbially, is not for discussion, and repetition.\nEnough that we said nothing more than, \"Oh, John, how glad I am!\" and\n\"Lorna, Lorna Lorna!\" for about five minutes. Then my darling drew\nback proudly, with blushing cheeks, and tear-bright eyes, she began to\ncross-examine me.\n\n\"Master John Ridd, you shall tell the truth, the whole truth, and\nnothing but the truth. I have been in Chancery, sir; and can detect a\nstory. Now why have you never, for more than a twelvemonth, taken the\nsmallest notice of your old friend, Mistress Lorna Doone?\" Although she\nspoke in this lightsome manner, as if it made no difference, I saw that\nher quick heart was moving, and the flash of her eyes controlled.\n\n\"Simply for this cause,\" I answered, \"that my old friend and true love,\ntook not the smallest heed of me. Nor knew I where to find her.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Lorna; and nothing more; being overcome with wondering;\nand much inclined to fall away, but for my assistance. I told her, over\nand over again, that not a single syllable of any message from her,\nor tidings of her welfare, had reached me, or any one of us, since the\nletter she left behind; except by soldier's gossip.\n\n\"Oh, you poor dear John!\" said Lorna, sighing at thought of my misery:\n\"how wonderfully good of you, thinking of me as you must have done, not\nto marry that little plain thing (or perhaps I should say that lovely\ncreature, for I have never seen her), Mistress Ruth--I forget her name;\nbut something like a towel.\"\n\n\"Ruth Huckaback is a worthy maid,\" I answered with some dignity; \"and\nshe alone of all our world, except indeed poor Annie, has kept her\nconfidence in you, and told me not to dread your rank, but trust your\nheart, Lady Lorna.\"\n\n\"Then Ruth is my best friend,\" she answered, \"and is worthy of you, dear\nJohn. And now remember one thing, dear; if God should part us, as may be\nby nothing short of death, try to marry that little Ruth, when you cease\nto remember me. And now for the head-traitor. I have often suspected it:\nbut she looks me in the face, and wishes--fearful things, which I cannot\nrepeat.\"\n\nWith these words, she moved an implement such as I had not seen before,\nand which made a ringing noise at a serious distance. And before I had\nceased wondering--for if such things go on, we might ring the church\nbells, while sitting in our back-kitchen--little Gwenny Carfax came,\nwith a grave and sullen face.\n\n\"Gwenny,\" began my Lorna, in a tone of high rank and dignity, \"go and\nfetch the letters which I gave you at various times for despatch to\nMistress Ridd.\"\n\n\"How can I fetch them, when they are gone? It be no use for him to tell\nno lies--\"\n\n\"Now, Gwenny, can you look at me?\" I asked, very sternly; for the matter\nwas no joke to me, after a year's unhappiness.\n\n\"I don't want to look at 'ee. What should I look at a young man for,\nalthough he did offer to kiss me?\"\n\nI saw the spite and impudence of this last remark, and so did Lorna,\nalthough she could not quite refrain from smiling.\n\n\"Now, Gwenny, not to speak of that,\" said Lorna, very demurely, \"if you\nthought it honest to keep the letters, was it honest to keep the money?\"\n\nAt this the Cornish maiden broke into a rage of honesty: \"A putt the\nmoney by for 'ee. 'Ee shall have every farden of it.\" And so she flung\nout of the room.\n\n\"And, Gwenny,\" said Lorna very softly, following under the\ndoor-hangings; \"if it is not honest to keep the money, it is not honest\nto keep the letters, which would have been worth more than any gold to\nthose who were so kind to you. Your father shall know the whole, Gwenny,\nunless you tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Now, a will tell all the truth,\" this strange maiden answered, talking\nto herself at least as much as to her mistress, while she went out of\nsight and hearing. And then I was so glad at having my own Lorna once\nagain, cleared of all contempt for us, and true to me through all of it,\nthat I would have forgiven Gwenny for treason, or even forgery.\n\n\"I trusted her so much,\" said Lorna, in her old ill-fortuned way; \"and\nlook how she has deceived me! That is why I love you, John (setting\nother things aside), because you never told me falsehood; and you never\ncould, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not so sure of that. I think I could tell any lie, to have\nyou, darling, all my own.\"\n\n\"Yes. And perhaps it might be right. To other people besides us two.\nBut you could not do it to me, John. You never could do it to me,\nyou know.\" Before I quite perceived my way to the bottom of the\ndistinction--although beyond doubt a valid one--Gwenny came back with a\nleathern bag, and tossed it upon the table. Not a word did she vouchsafe\nto us; but stood there, looking injured.\n\n\"Go, and get your letters, John,\" said Lorna very gravely; \"or at least\nyour mother's letters, made of messages to you. As for Gwenny, she shall\ngo before Lord Justice Jeffreys.\" I knew that Lorna meant it not; but\nthought that the girl deserved a frightening; as indeed she did. But we\nboth mistook the courage of this child of Cornwall. She stepped upon a\nlittle round thing, in the nature of a stool, such as I never had seen\nbefore, and thus delivered her sentiments.\n\n\"And you may take me, if you please, before the great Lord Jeffreys. I\nhave done no more than duty, though I did it crookedly, and told a heap\nof lies, for your sake. And pretty gratitude I gets.\"\n\n\"Much gratitude you have shown,\" replied Lorna, \"to Master Ridd, for all\nhis kindness and his goodness to you. Who was it that went down, at the\nperil of his life, and brought your father to you, when you had lost him\nfor months and months? Who was it? Answer me, Gwenny?\"\n\n\"Girt Jan Ridd,\" said the handmaid, very sulkily.\n\n\"What made you treat me so, little Gwenny?\" I asked, for Lorna would not\nask lest the reply should vex me.\n\n\"Because 'ee be'est below her so. Her shanna' have a poor farmering\nchap, not even if her were a Carnishman. All her land, and all her\nbirth--and who be you, I'd like to know?\"\n\n\"Gwenny, you may go,\" said Lorna, reddening with quiet anger; \"and\nremember that you come not near me for the next three days. It is the\nonly way to punish her,\" she continued to me, when the maid was gone, in\na storm of sobbing and weeping. \"Now, for the next three days, she will\nscarcely touch a morsel of food, and scarcely do a thing but cry. Make\nup your mind to one thing, John; if you mean to take me, for better for\nworse, you will have to take Gwenny with me.\n\n\"I would take you with fifty Gwennies,\" said I, \"although every one\nof them hated me, which I do not believe this little maid does, in the\nbottom of her heart.\"\n\n\"No one can possibly hate you, John,\" she answered very softly; and I\nwas better pleased with this, than if she had called me the most noble\nand glorious man in the kingdom.\n\nAfter this, we spoke of ourselves and the way people would regard us,\nsupposing that when Lorna came to be her own free mistress (as she must\ndo in the course of time) she were to throw her rank aside, and refuse\nher title, and caring not a fig for folk who cared less than a fig-stalk\nfor her, should shape her mind to its native bent, and to my perfect\nhappiness. It was not my place to say much, lest I should appear to use\nan improper and selfish influence. And of course to all men of common\nsense, and to everybody of middle age (who must know best what is good\nfor youth), the thoughts which my Lorna entertained would be enough to\nprove her madness.\n\nNot that we could not keep her well, comfortably, and with nice clothes,\nand plenty of flowers, and fruit, and landscape, and the knowledge of\nour neighbours' affairs, and their kind interest in our own. Still this\nwould not be as if she were the owner of a county, and a haughty title;\nand able to lead the first men of the age, by her mind, and face, and\nmoney.\n\nTherefore was I quite resolved not to have a word to say, while this\nyoung queen of wealth and beauty, and of noblemen's desire, made her\nmind up how to act for her purest happiness. But to do her justice, this\nwas not the first thing she was thinking of: the test of her judgment\nwas only this, \"How will my love be happiest?\"\n\n\"Now, John,\" she cried; for she was so quick that she always had my\nthoughts beforehand; \"why will you be backward, as if you cared not\nfor me? Do you dream that I am doubting? My mind has been made up, good\nJohn, that you must be my husband, for--well, I will not say how long,\nlest you should laugh at my folly. But I believe it was ever since you\ncame, with your stockings off, and the loaches. Right early for me to\nmake up my mind; but you know that you made up yours, John; and, of\ncourse, I knew it; and that had a great effect on me. Now, after all\nthis age of loving, shall a trifle sever us?\"\n\nI told her that it was no trifle, but a most important thing, to abandon\nwealth, and honour, and the brilliance of high life, and be despised\nby every one for such abundant folly. Moreover, that I should appear a\nknave for taking advantage of her youth, and boundless generosity, and\nruining (as men would say) a noble maid by my selfishness. And I told\nher outright, having worked myself up by my own conversation, that she\nwas bound to consult her guardian, and that without his knowledge, I\nwould come no more to see her. Her flash of pride at these last words\nmade her look like an empress; and I was about to explain myself better,\nbut she put forth her hand and stopped me.\n\n\"I think that condition should rather have proceeded from me. You are\nmistaken, Master Ridd, in supposing that I would think of receiving\nyou in secret. It was a different thing in Glen Doone, where all except\nyourself were thieves, and when I was but a simple child, and oppressed\nwith constant fear. You are quite right in threatening to visit me thus\nno more; but I think you might have waited for an invitation, sir.\"\n\n\"And you are quite right, Lady Lorna, in pointing out my presumption. It\nis a fault that must ever be found in any speech of mine to you.\"\n\nThis I said so humbly, and not with any bitterness--for I knew that I\nhad gone too far--and made her so polite a bow, that she forgave me in a\nmoment, and we begged each other's pardon.\n\n\"Now, will you allow me just to explain my own view of this matter,\nJohn?\" said she, once more my darling. \"It may be a very foolish view,\nbut I shall never change it. Please not to interrupt me, dear, until you\nhave heard me to the end. In the first place, it is quite certain that\nneither you nor I can be happy without the other. Then what stands\nbetween us? Worldly position, and nothing else. I have no more education\nthan you have, John Ridd; nay, and not so much. My birth and ancestry\nare not one whit more pure than yours, although they may be better\nknown. Your descent from ancient freeholders, for five-and-twenty\ngenerations of good, honest men, although you bear no coat of arms, is\nbetter than the lineage of nine proud English noblemen out of every ten\nI meet with. In manners, though your mighty strength, and hatred of any\nmeanness, sometimes break out in violence--of which I must try to cure\nyou, dear--in manners, if kindness, and gentleness, and modesty are\nthe true things wanted, you are immeasurably above any of our\nCourt-gallants; who indeed have very little. As for difference of\nreligion, we allow for one another, neither having been brought up\nin a bitterly pious manner.\"\n\nHere, though the tears were in my eyes, at the loving things love said\nof me, I could not help a little laugh at the notion of any bitter piety\nbeing found among the Doones, or even in mother, for that matter. Lorna\nsmiled, in her slyest manner, and went on again:--\n\n\"Now, you see, I have proved my point; there is nothing between us but\nworldly position--if you can defend me against the Doones, for which, I\ntrow, I may trust you. And worldly position means wealth, and title,\nand the right to be in great houses, and the pleasure of being envied.\nI have not been here for a year, John, without learning something. Oh,\nI hate it; how I hate it! Of all the people I know, there are but two,\nbesides my uncle, who do not either covet, or detest me. And who are\nthose two, think you?\"\n\n\"Gwenny, for one,\" I answered.\n\n\"Yes, Gwenny, for one. And the queen, for the other. The one is too far\nbelow me (I mean, in her own opinion), and the other too high above.\nAs for the women who dislike me, without having even heard my voice, I\nsimply have nothing to do with them. As for the men who covet me, for\nmy land and money, I merely compare them with you, John Ridd; and all\nthought of them is over. Oh, John, you must never forsake me, however\ncross I am to you. I thought you would have gone, just now; and though I\nwould not move to stop you, my heart would have broken.\"\n\n\"You don't catch me go in a hurry,\" I answered very sensibly, \"when the\nloveliest maiden in all the world, and the best, and the dearest, loves\nme. All my fear of you is gone, darling Lorna, all my fear--\"\n\n\"Is it possible you could fear me, John, after all we have been through\ntogether? Now you promised not to interrupt me; is this fair behaviour?\nWell, let me see where I left off--oh, that my heart would have broken.\nUpon that point, I will say no more, lest you should grow conceited,\nJohn; if anything could make you so. But I do assure you that half\nLondon--however, upon that point also I will check my power of speech,\nlest you think me conceited. And now to put aside all nonsense; though I\nhave talked none for a year, John, having been so unhappy; and now it is\nsuch a relief to me--\"\n\n\"Then talk it for an hour,\" said I; \"and let me sit and watch you. To me\nit is the very sweetest of all sweetest wisdom.\"\n\n\"Nay, there is no time,\" she answered, glancing at a jewelled timepiece,\nscarcely larger than an oyster, which she drew from her waist-band; and\nthen she pushed it away, in confusion, lest its wealth should startle\nme. \"My uncle will come home in less than half an hour, dear: and you\nare not the one to take a side-passage, and avoid him. I shall tell him\nthat you have been here; and that I mean you to come again.\"\n\nAs Lorna said this, with a manner as confident as need be, I saw that\nshe had learned in town the power of her beauty, and knew that she could\ndo with most men aught she set her mind upon. And as she stood there,\nflushed with pride and faith in her own loveliness, and radiant with the\nlove itself, I felt that she must do exactly as she pleased with every\none. For now, in turn, and elegance, and richness, and variety, there\nwas nothing to compare with her face, unless it were her figure.\nTherefore I gave in, and said,--\n\n\"Darling, do just what you please. Only make no rogue of me.\"\n\nFor that she gave me the simplest, kindest, and sweetest of all kisses;\nand I went down the great stairs grandly, thinking of nothing else but\nthat.\n\n[Illustration: 631.jpg Old London Bridge]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII\n\nJOHN IS JOHN NO LONGER\n\n[Illustration: 632.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nIt would be hard for me to tell the state of mind in which I lived for a\nlong time after this. I put away from me all torment, and the thought of\nfuture cares, and the sight of difficulty; and to myself appeared,\nwhich means that I became the luckiest of lucky fellows, since the world\nitself began. I thought not of the harvest even, nor of the men who\nwould get their wages without having earned them, nor of my mother's\nanxiety and worry about John Fry's great fatness (which was growing upon\nhim), and how she would cry fifty times in a day, \"Ah, if our John would\nonly come home, how different everything would look!\"\n\nAlthough there were no soldiers now quartered at Plover's Barrows, all\nbeing busied in harassing the country, and hanging the people where the\nrebellion had thriven most, my mother, having received from me a message\ncontaining my place of abode, contrived to send me, by the pack-horses,\nas fine a maund as need be of provisions, and money, and other comforts.\nTherein I found addressed to Colonel Jeremiah Stickles, in Lizzie's best\nhandwriting, half a side of the dried deer's flesh, in which he rejoiced\nso greatly. Also, for Lorna, a fine green goose, with a little salt\ntowards the tail, and new-laid eggs inside it, as well as a bottle of\nbrandied cherries, and seven, or it may have been eight pounds of fresh\nhomemade butter. Moreover, to myself there was a letter full of good\nadvice, excellently well expressed, and would have been of the greatest\nvalue, if I had cared to read it. But I read all about the farm affairs,\nand the man who had offered himself to our Betty for the five pounds\nin her stocking; as well as the antics of Sally Snowe, and how she had\nalmost thrown herself at Parson Bowden's head (old enough to be her\ngrandfather), because on the Sunday after the hanging of a Countisbury\nman, he had preached a beautiful sermon about Christian love; which\nLizzie, with her sharp eyes, found to be the work of good Bishop Ken.\nAlso I read that the Doones were quiet; the parishes round about having\nunited to feed them well through the harvest time, so that after the\nday's hard work, the farmers might go to bed at night. And this plan had\nbeen found to answer well, and to save much trouble on both sides, so\nthat everybody wondered it had not been done before. But Lizzie thought\nthat the Doones could hardly be expected much longer to put up with it,\nand probably would not have done so now, but for a little adversity; to\nwit, that the famous Colonel Kirke had, in the most outrageous manner,\nhanged no less than six of them, who were captured among the rebels;\nfor he said that men of their rank and breeding, and above all of\ntheir religion, should have known better than to join plough-boys, and\ncarters, and pickaxemen, against our Lord the King, and his Holiness\nthe Pope. This hanging of so many Doones caused some indignation among\npeople who were used to them; and it seemed for a while to check the\nrest from any spirit of enterprise.\n\nMoreover, I found from this same letter (which was pinned upon the\nknuckle of a leg of mutton, for fear of being lost in straw) that good\nTom Faggus was at home again, and nearly cured of his dreadful wound;\nbut intended to go to war no more, only to mind his family. And it\ngrieved him more than anything he ever could have imagined, that his\nduty to his family, and the strong power of his conscience, so totally\nforbade him to come up and see after me. For now his design was to lead\na new life, and be in charity with all men. Many better men than he had\nbeen hanged, he saw no cause to doubt; but by the grace of God he hoped\nhimself to cheat the gallows.\n\nThere was no further news of moment in this very clever letter, except\nthat the price of horses' shoes was gone up again, though already\ntwopence-farthing each; and that Betty had broken her lover's head with\nthe stocking full of money; and then in the corner it was written that\nthe distinguished man of war, and worshipful scholar, Master Bloxham,\nwas now promoted to take the tolls, and catch all the rebels around our\npart.\n\nLorna was greatly pleased with the goose, and the butter, and the\nbrandied cherries; and the Earl Brandir himself declared that he never\ntasted better than those last, and would beg the young man from the\ncountry to procure him instructions for making them. This nobleman,\nbeing as deaf as a post, and of a very solid mind, could never be\nbrought to understand the nature of my thoughts towards Lorna. He looked\nupon me as an excellent youth, who had rescued the maiden from the\nDoones, whom he cordially detested; and learning that I had thrown two\nof them out of window (as the story was told him), he patted me on the\nback, and declared that his doors would ever be open to me, and that I\ncould not come too often.\n\nI thought this very kind of his lordship, especially as it enabled me to\nsee my darling Lorna, not indeed as often as I wished, but at any\nrate very frequently, and as many times as modesty (ever my leading\nprinciple) would in common conscience approve of. And I made up my mind\nthat if ever I could help Earl Brandir, it would be--as we say, when\nwith brandy and water--the \"proudest moment of my life,\" when I could\nfulfil the pledge.\n\nAnd I soon was able to help Lord Brandir, as I think, in two different\nways; first of all as regarded his mind, and then as concerned his body:\nand the latter perhaps was the greatest service, at his time of life.\nBut not to be too nice about that; let me tell how these things were.\n\nLorna said to me one day, being in a state of excitement--whereto she\nwas over prone, when reft of my slowness to steady her,--\n\n\"I will tell him, John; I must tell him, John. It is mean of me to\nconceal it.\"\n\nI thought that she meant all about our love, which we had endeavoured\nthrice to drill into his fine old ears; but could not make him\ncomprehend, without risk of bringing the house down: and so I said, \"By\nall means; darling; have another try at it.\"\n\nLorna, however, looked at me--for her eyes told more than tongue--as\nmuch as to say, \"Well, you are a stupid. We agreed to let that subject\nrest.\" And then she saw that I was vexed at my own want of quickness;\nand so she spoke very kindly,--\n\n\"I meant about his poor son, dearest; the son of his old age almost;\nwhose loss threw him into that dreadful cold--for he went, without hat,\nto look for him--which ended in his losing the use of his dear old ears.\nI believe if we could only get him to Plover's Barrows for a month, he\nwould be able to hear again. And look at his age! he is not much over\nseventy, John, you know; and I hope that you will be able to hear me,\nlong after you are seventy, John.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"God settles that. Or at any rate, He leaves us time\nto think about those questions, when we are over fifty. Now let me know\nwhat you want, Lorna. The idea of my being seventy! But you would still\nbe beautiful.\"\n\n\"To the one who loves me,\" she answered, trying to make wrinkles in her\npure bright forehead: \"but if you will have common sense, as you always\nwill, John, whether I wish it or otherwise--I want to know whether I am\nbound, in honour, and in conscience, to tell my dear and good old uncle\nwhat I know about his son?\"\n\n\"First let me understand quite clearly,\" said I, never being in a hurry,\nexcept when passion moves me, \"what his lordship thinks at present; and\nhow far his mind is urged with sorrow and anxiety.\" This was not the\nfirst time we had spoken of the matter.\n\n\"Why, you know, John, well enough,\" she answered, wondering at my\ncoolness, \"that my poor uncle still believes that his one beloved\nson will come to light and live again. He has made all arrangements\naccordingly: all his property is settled on that supposition. He knows\nthat young Alan always was what he calls a 'feckless ne'er-do-weel;' but\nhe loves him all the more for that. He cannot believe that he will die,\nwithout his son coming back to him; and he always has a bedroom ready,\nand a bottle of Alan's favourite wine cool from out the cellar; he has\nmade me work him a pair of slippers from the size of a mouldy boot; and\nif he hears of a new tobacco--much as he hates the smell of it--he will\ngo to the other end of London to get some for Alan. Now you know how\ndeaf he is; but if any one say, 'Alan,' even in the place outside the\ndoor, he will make his courteous bow to the very highest visitor, and be\nout there in a moment, and search the entire passage, and yet let no one\nknow it.\"\n\n\"It is a piteous thing,\" I said; for Lorna's eyes were full of tears.\n\n\"And he means me to marry him. It is the pet scheme of his life. I am\nto grow more beautiful, and more highly taught, and graceful; until\nit pleases Alan to come back, and demand me. Can you understand this\nmatter, John? Or do you think my uncle mad?\"\n\n\"Lorna, I should be mad myself, to call any other man mad, for hoping.\"\n\n\"Then will you tell me what to do? It makes me very sorrowful. For I\nknow that Alan Brandir lies below the sod in Doone-valley.\"\n\n\"And if you tell his father,\" I answered softly, but clearly, \"in a few\nweeks he will lie below the sod in London; at least if there is any.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, John,\" she replied: \"to lose hope must be a\ndreadful thing, when one is turned of seventy. Therefore I will never\ntell him.\"\n\nThe other way in which I managed to help the good Earl Brandir was of\nless true moment to him; but as he could not know of the first, this was\nthe one which moved him. And it happened pretty much as follows--though\nI hardly like to tell, because it advanced me to such a height as I\nmyself was giddy at; and which all my friends resented greatly (save\nthose of my own family), and even now are sometimes bitter, in spite of\nall my humility. Now this is a matter of history, because the King was\nconcerned in it; and being so strongly misunderstood, (especially in\nmy own neighbourhood, I will overcome so far as I can) my diffidence in\ntelling it.\n\nThe good Earl Brandir was a man of the noblest charity. True charity\nbegins at home, and so did his; and was afraid of losing the way, if it\nwent abroad. So this good nobleman kept his money in a handsome\npewter box, with his coat of arms upon it, and a double lid and locks.\nMoreover, there was a heavy chain, fixed to a staple in the wall, so\nthat none might carry off the pewter with the gold inside of it. Lorna\ntold me the box was full, for she had seen him go to it, and she often\nthought that it would be nice for us to begin the world with. I told\nher that she must not allow her mind to dwell upon things of this sort;\nbeing wholly against the last commandment set up in our church at Oare.\n\nNow one evening towards September, when the days were drawing in,\nlooking back at the house to see whether Lorna were looking after me,\nI espied (by a little glimpse, as it were) a pair of villainous fellows\n(about whom there could be no mistake) watching from the thicket-corner,\nsome hundred yards or so behind the good Earl's dwelling. \"There is\nmischief afoot,\" thought I to myself, being thoroughly conversant with\ntheft, from my knowledge of the Doones; \"how will be the moon to-night,\nand when may we expect the watch?\"\n\nI found that neither moon nor watch could be looked for until the\nmorning; the moon, of course, before the watch, and more likely to be\npunctual. Therefore I resolved to wait, and see what those two villains\ndid, and save (if it were possible) the Earl of Brandir's pewter box.\nBut inasmuch as those bad men were almost sure to have seen me leaving\nthe house and looking back, and striking out on the London road, I\nmarched along at a merry pace, until they could not discern me; and\nthen I fetched a compass round, and refreshed myself at a certain inn,\nentitled The Cross-bones and Buttons.\n\nHere I remained until it was very nearly as dark as pitch; and the house\nbeing full of footpads and cutthroats, I thought it right to leave them.\nOne or two came after me, in the hope of designing a stratagem; but I\ndropped them in the darkness; and knowing all the neighbourhood well, I\ntook up my position, two hours before midnight, among the shrubs at the\neastern end of Lord Brandir's mansion. Hence, although I might not see,\nI could scarcely fail to hear, if any unlawful entrance either at back\nor front were made.\n\nFrom my own observation, I thought it likely that the attack would be\nin the rear; and so indeed it came to pass. For when all the lights were\nquenched, and all the house was quiet, I heard a low and wily whistle\nfrom a clump of trees close by; and then three figures passed between me\nand a whitewashed wall, and came to a window which opened into a part\nof the servants' basement. This window was carefully raised by some one\ninside the house; and after a little whispering, and something which\nsounded like a kiss, all the three men entered.\n\n\"Oh, you villains!\" I said to myself, \"this is worse than any Doone job;\nbecause there is treachery in it.\" But without waiting to consider the\nsubject from a moral point of view, I crept along the wall, and entered\nvery quietly after them; being rather uneasy about my life, because I\nbore no fire-arms, and had nothing more than my holly staff, for even a\nviolent combat.\n\nTo me this was matter of deep regret, as I followed these vile men\ninward. Nevertheless I was resolved that my Lorna should not be robbed\nagain. Through us (or at least through our Annie) she had lost that\nbrilliant necklace; which then was her only birthright: therefore it\nbehoved me doubly, to preserve the pewter box; which must belong to her\nin the end, unless the thieves got hold of it.\n\nI went along very delicately (as a man who has learned to wrestle can\ndo, although he may weigh twenty stone), following carefully the light,\nbrought by the traitorous maid, and shaking in her loose dishonest hand.\nI saw her lead the men into a little place called a pantry; and there\nshe gave them cordials, and I could hear them boasting.\n\nNot to be too long over it--which they were much inclined to be--I\nfollowed them from this drinking-bout, by the aid of the light they\nbore, as far as Earl Brandir's bedroom, which I knew, because Lorna had\nshown it to me that I might admire the tapestry. But I had said that no\nhorse could ever be shod as the horses were shod therein, unless he had\nthe foot of a frog, as well as a frog to his foot. And Lorna had been\nvexed at this (as taste and high art always are, at any small accurate\nknowledge), and so she had brought me out again, before I had time to\nadmire things.\n\nNow, keeping well away in the dark, yet nearer than was necessary to my\nown dear Lorna's room, I saw these fellows try the door of the good Earl\nBrandir, knowing from the maid, of course, that his lordship could hear\nnothing, except the name of Alan. They tried the lock, and pushed at it,\nand even set their knees upright; but a Scottish nobleman may be trusted\nto secure his door at night. So they were forced to break it open; and\nat this the guilty maid, or woman, ran away. These three rogues--for\nrogues they were, and no charity may deny it--burst into Earl Brandir's\nroom, with a light, and a crowbar, and fire-arms. I thought to myself\nthat this was hard upon an honest nobleman; and if further mischief\ncould be saved, I would try to save it.\n\nWhen I came to the door of the room, being myself in shadow, I beheld\ntwo bad men trying vainly to break open the pewter box, and the third\nwith a pistol-muzzle laid to the night-cap of his lordship. With foul\nface and yet fouler words, this man was demanding the key of the box,\nwhich the other men could by no means open, neither drag it from the\nchain.\n\n[Illustration: 639.jpg Two bad men]\n\n\"I tell you,\" said this aged Earl, beginning to understand at last what\nthese rogues were up for; \"I will give no key to you. It all belongs to\nmy boy, Alan. No one else shall have a farthing.\"\n\n\"Then you may count your moments, lord. The key is in your old cramped\nhand. One, two, and at three, I shoot you.\"\n\nI saw that the old man was abroad; not with fear, but with great wonder,\nand the regrets of deafness. And I saw that rather would he be shot\nthan let these men go rob his son, buried now, or laid to bleach in the\ntangles of the wood, three, or it might be four years agone, but still\nalive to his father. Hereupon my heart was moved; and I resolved to\ninterfere. The thief with the pistol began to count, as I crossed the\nfloor very quietly, while the old Earl fearfully gazed at the muzzle,\nbut clenched still tighter his wrinkled hand. The villain, with hair all\nover his eyes, and the great horse-pistol levelled, cried \"three,\" and\npulled the trigger; but luckily, at that very moment, I struck up the\nbarrel with my staff, so that the shot pierced the tester, and then\nwith a spin and a thwack I brought the good holly down upon the rascal's\nhead, in a manner which stretched him upon the floor.\n\nMeanwhile the other two robbers had taken the alarm, and rushed at me,\none with a pistol and one with a hanger; which forced me to be very\nlively. Fearing the pistol most, I flung the heavy velvet curtain of the\nbed across, that he might not see where to aim at me, and then stooping\nvery quickly I caught up the senseless robber, and set him up for a\nshield and target; whereupon he was shot immediately, without having the\npain of knowing it; and a happy thing it was for him. Now the other two\nwere at my mercy, being men below the average strength; and no hanger,\nexcept in most skilful hands, as well as firm and strong ones, has\nany chance to a powerful man armed with a stout cudgel, and thoroughly\npractised in single-stick.\n\nSo I took these two rogues, and bound them together; and leaving them\nunder charge of the butler (a worthy and shrewd Scotchman), I myself\nwent in search of the constables, whom, after some few hours, I found;\nneither were they so drunk but what they could take roped men to prison.\nIn the morning, these two men were brought before the Justices of the\nPeace: and now my wonderful luck appeared; for the merit of having\ndefeated, and caught them, would never have raised me one step in the\nState, or in public consideration, if they had only been common robbers,\nor even notorious murderers. But when these fellows were recognised,\nby some one in the court, as Protestant witnesses out of employment,\ncompanions and understrappers to Oates, and Bedloe, and Carstairs, and\nhand in glove with Dangerfield, Turberville; and Dugdale--in a word, the\nvery men against whom His Majesty the King bore the bitterest rancour,\nbut whom he had hitherto failed to catch--when this was laid before the\npublic (with emphasis and admiration), at least a dozen men came\nup, whom I had never seen before, and prayed me to accept their\ncongratulations, and to be sure to remember them; for all were of\nneglected merit, and required no more than a piece of luck.\n\nI answered them very modestly, and each according to his worth, as\nstated by himself, who of course could judge the best. The magistrate\nmade me many compliments, ten times more than I deserved, and took good\ncare to have them copied, that His Majesty might see them. And ere the\ncase was thoroughly heard, and those poor fellows were committed, more\nthan a score of generous men had offered to lend me a hundred pounds,\nwherewith to buy a new Court suit, when called before His Majesty.\n\nNow this may seem very strange to us who live in a better and purer\nage--or say at least that we do so--and yet who are we to condemn our\nfathers for teaching us better manners, and at their own expense? With\nthese points any virtuous man is bound to deal quite tenderly, making\nallowance for corruption, and not being too sure of himself. And to tell\nthe truth, although I had seen so little of the world as yet, that which\nastonished me in the matter, was not so much that they paid me court, as\nthat they found out so soon the expediency of doing it.\n\nIn the course of that same afternoon I was sent for by His Majesty. He\nhad summoned first the good Earl Brandir, and received the tale from\nhim, not without exaggeration, although my lord was a Scotchman. But\nthe chief thing His Majesty cared to know was that, beyond all possible\ndoubt, these were the very precious fellows from perjury turned to\nrobbery.\n\nBeing fully assured at last of this, His Majesty had rubbed his hands,\nand ordered the boots of a stricter pattern (which he himself had\ninvented) to be brought at once, that he might have them in the best\npossible order. And he oiled them himself, and expressed his fear that\nthere was no man in London quite competent to work them. Nevertheless\nhe would try one or two, rather than wait for his pleasure, till the\ntorturer came from Edinburgh.\n\nThe next thing he did was to send for me; and in great alarm and flurry\nI put on my best clothes, and hired a fashionable hairdresser, and drank\nhalf a gallon of ale, because both my hands were shaking. Then forth I\nset, with my holly staff, wishing myself well out of it. I was shown at\nonce, and before I desired it, into His Majesty's presence, and there I\nstood most humbly, and made the best bow I could think of.\n\nAs I could not advance any farther--for I saw that the Queen was\npresent, which frightened me tenfold--His Majesty, in the most gracious\nmanner, came down the room to encourage me. And as I remained with my\nhead bent down, he told me to stand up, and look at him.\n\n\"I have seen thee before, young man,\" he said; \"thy form is not one to be\nforgotten. Where was it? Thou art most likely to know.\"\n\n\"May it please Your Most Gracious Majesty the King,\" I answered, finding\nmy voice in a manner which surprised myself; \"it was in the Royal\nChapel.\"\n\nNow I meant no harm whatever by this. I ought to have said the\n\"Ante-chapel,\" but I could not remember the word, and feared to keep the\nKing looking at me.\n\n\"I am well-pleased,\" said His Majesty, with a smile which almost made\nhis dark and stubborn face look pleasant, \"to find that our greatest\nsubject, greatest I mean in the bodily form, is also a good Catholic.\nThou needest not say otherwise. The time shall be, and that right soon,\nwhen men shall be proud of the one true faith.\" Here he stopped, having\ngone rather far! but the gleam of his heavy eyes was such that I durst\nnot contradict.\n\n\"This is that great Johann Reed,\" said Her Majesty, coming forward,\nbecause the King was in meditation; \"for whom I have so much heard, from\nthe dear, dear Lorna. Ah, she is not of this black countree, she is of\nthe breet Italie.\"\n\nI have tried to write it, as she said it: but it wants a better scholar\nto express her mode of speech.\n\n\"Now, John Ridd,\" said the King, recovering from his thoughts about the\ntrue Church, and thinking that his wife was not to take the lead upon\nme; \"thou hast done great service to the realm, and to religion. It was\ngood to save Earl Brandir, a loyal and Catholic nobleman; but it was\ngreat service to catch two of the vilest bloodhounds ever laid on by\nheretics. And to make them shoot one another: it was rare; it was rare,\nmy lad. Now ask us anything in reason; thou canst carry any honours, on\nthy club, like Hercules. What is thy chief ambition, lad?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, after thinking a little, and meaning to make the most\nof it, for so the Queen's eyes conveyed to me; \"my mother always used to\nthink that having been schooled at Tiverton, with thirty marks a year to\npay, I was worthy of a coat of arms. And that is what she longs for.\"\n\n\"A good lad! A very good lad,\" said the King, and he looked at the\nQueen, as if almost in joke; \"but what is thy condition in life?\"\n\n\"I am a freeholder,\" I answered, in my confusion, \"ever since the time\nof King Alfred. A Ridd was with him in the isle of Athelney, and we hold\nour farm by gift from him; or at least people say so. We have had three\nvery good harvests running, and might support a coat of arms; but for\nmyself I want it not.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt have a coat, my lad,\" said the King, smiling at his own\nhumour; \"but it must be a large one to fit thee. And more than that\nshalt thou have, John Ridd, being of such loyal breed, and having done\nsuch service.\"\n\nAnd while I wondered what he meant, he called to some of the people in\nwaiting at the farther end of the room, and they brought him a little\nsword, such as Annie would skewer a turkey with. Then he signified to me\nto kneel, which I did (after dusting the board, for the sake of my\nbest breeches), and then he gave me a little tap very nicely upon my\nshoulder, before I knew what he was up to; and said, \"Arise, Sir John\nRidd!\"\n\nThis astonished and amazed me to such extent of loss of mind, that when\nI got up I looked about, and thought what the Snowes would think of it.\nAnd I said to the King, without forms of speech,--\n\n\"Sir, I am very much obliged. But what be I to do with it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX\n\nNOT TO BE PUT UP WITH\n\n[Illustration: 644.jpg Coat of Arms]\n\nThe coat of arms, devised for me by the Royal heralds, was of great\nsize, and rich colours, and full of bright imaginings. They did me the\nhonour to consult me first, and to take no notice of my advice. For I\nbegged that there might be a good-sized cow on it, so as to stamp our\npats of butter before they went to market: also a horse on the other\nside, and a flock snowed up at the bottom. But the gentlemen would not\nhear of this; and to find something more appropriate, they inquired\nstrictly into the annals of our family. I told them, of course, all\nabout King Alfred; upon which they settled that one quarter should be,\nthree cakes on a bar, with a lion regardant, done upon a field of gold.\nAlso I told them that very likely there had been a Ridd in the battle\nfought, not very far from Plover's Barrows, by the Earl of Devon against\nthe Danes, when Hubba their chief was killed, and the sacred standard\ntaken. As some of the Danes are said to be buried, even upon land\nof ours, and we call their graves (if such they be) even to this day\n\"barrows,\" the heralds quite agreed with me that a Ridd might have been\nthere, or thereabouts; and if he was there, he was almost certain to\nhave done his best, being in sight of hearth and home; and it was plain\nthat he must have had good legs to be at the same time both there and in\nAthelney; and good legs are an argument for good arms; and supposing\na man of this sort to have done his utmost (as the manner of the Ridds\nis), it was next to certain that he himself must have captured the\nstandard. Moreover, the name of our farm was pure proof; a plover being\na wild bird, just the same as a raven is. Upon this chain of reasoning,\nand without any weak misgivings, they charged my growing escutcheon with\na black raven on a ground of red. And the next thing which I mentioned\npossessing absolute certainty, to wit, that a pig with two heads had\nbeen born upon our farm, not more than two hundred years agone (although\nhe died within a week), my third quarter was made at once, by a\ntwo-headed boar with noble tusks, sable upon silver. All this was very\nfierce and fine; and so I pressed for a peaceful corner in the lower\ndexter, and obtained a wheat-sheaf set upright, gold upon a field of\ngreen.\n\n[Illustration: 645.jpg John Ridd admiring his coat of arms]\n\nHere I was inclined to pause, and admire the effect; for even De\nWhichehalse could not show a bearing so magnificent. But the heralds\nsaid that it looked a mere sign-board, without a good motto under it;\nand the motto must have my name in it. They offered me first, \"_Ridd\nnon ridendus_\"; but I said, \"for God's sake, gentlemen, let me forget my\nLatin.\" Then they proposed, \"Ridd readeth riddles\": but I begged them\nnot to set down such a lie; for no Ridd ever had made, or made out, such\na thing as a riddle, since Exmoor itself began. Thirdly, they gave me,\n\"Ridd never be ridden,\" and fearing to make any further objections, I\nlet them inscribe it in bronze upon blue. The heralds thought that the\nKing would pay for this noble achievement; but His Majesty, although\ngraciously pleased with their ingenuity, declined in the most decided\nmanner to pay a farthing towards it; and as I had now no money left, the\nheralds became as blue as azure, and as red as gules; until Her Majesty\nthe Queen came forward very kindly, and said that if His Majesty gave\nme a coat of arms, I was not to pay for it; therefore she herself did so\nquite handsomely, and felt goodwill towards me in consequence.\n\nNow being in a hurry--so far at least as it is in my nature to hurry--to\nget to the end of this narrative, is it likely that I would have dwelled\nso long upon my coat of arms, but for some good reason? And this good\nreason is that Lorna took the greatest pride in it, and thought (or at\nany rate said) that it quite threw into the shade, and eclipsed, all her\nown ancient glories. And half in fun, and half in earnest, she called\nme \"Sir John\" so continually, that at last I was almost angry with\nher; until her eyes were bedewed with tears; and then I was angry with\nmyself.\n\nBeginning to be short of money, and growing anxious about the farm,\nlonging also to show myself and my noble escutcheon to mother, I\ntook advantage of Lady Lorna's interest with the Queen, to obtain my\nacquittance and full discharge from even nominal custody. It had been\nintended to keep me in waiting, until the return of Lord Jeffreys, from\nthat awful circuit of shambles, through which his name is still used by\nmothers to frighten their children into bed. And right glad was\nI--for even London shrank with horror at the news--to escape a man\nso bloodthirsty, savage, and even to his friends (among whom I was\nreckoned) malignant.\n\nEarl Brandir was greatly pleased with me, not only for having saved his\nlife, but for saving that which he valued more, the wealth laid by for\nLord Alan. And he introduced me to many great people, who quite kindly\nencouraged me, and promised to help me in every way when they heard how\nthe King had spoken. As for the furrier, he could never have enough of\nmy society; and this worthy man, praying my commendation, demanded of me\none thing only--to speak of him as I found him. As I had found him many\na Sunday, furbishing up old furs for new, with a glaze to conceal the\nmoths' ravages, I begged him to reconsider the point, and not to demand\nsuch accuracy. He said, \"Well, well; all trades had tricks, especially\nthe trick of business; and I must take him--if I were his true\nfriend--according to his own description.\" This I was glad enough to do;\nbecause it saved so much trouble, and I had no money to spend with him.\nBut still he requested the use of my name; and I begged him to do the\nbest with it, as I never had kept a banker. And the \"John Ridd cuffs,\"\nand the \"Sir John mantles,\" and the \"Holly-staff capes,\" he put into\nhis window, as the winter was coming on, ay and sold (for everybody was\nburning with gossip about me), must have made this good man's fortune;\nsince the excess of price over value is the true test of success in\nlife.\n\nTo come away from all this stuff, which grieves a man in London--when\nthe brisk air of the autumn cleared its way to Ludgate Hill, and clever\n'prentices ran out, and sniffed at it, and fed upon it (having little\nelse to eat); and when the horses from the country were a goodly sight\nto see, with the rasp of winter bristles rising through and among the\nsoft summer-coat; and when the new straw began to come in, golden\nwith the harvest gloss, and smelling most divinely at those strange\nlivery-stables, where the nags are put quite tail to tail; and when\nall the London folk themselves are asking about white frost (from\nrecollections of childhood); then, I say, such a yearning seized me for\nmoory crag, and for dewy blade, and even the grunting of our sheep (when\nthe sun goes down), that nothing but the new wisps of Samson could have\nheld me in London town.\n\nLorna was moved with equal longing towards the country and country ways;\nand she spoke quite as much of the glistening dew as she did of the\nsmell of our oven. And here let me mention--although the two are quite\ndistinct and different--that both the dew and the bread of Exmoor may\nbe sought, whether high or low, but never found elsewhere. The dew is so\ncrisp, and pure, and pearly, and in such abundance; and the bread is so\nsweet, so kind, and homely, you can eat a loaf, and then another.\n\nNow while I was walking daily in and out great crowds of men (few of\nwhom had any freedom from the cares of money, and many of whom were\neven morbid with a worse pest called \"politics\"), I could not be quit of\nthinking how we jostle one another. God has made the earth quite large,\nwith a spread of land large enough for all to live on, without fighting.\nAlso a mighty spread of water, laying hands on sand and cliff with a\nsolemn voice in storm-time; and in the gentle weather moving men to\nthoughts of equity. This, as well, is full of food; being two-thirds of\nthe world, and reserved for devouring knowledge; by the time the sons\nof men have fed away the dry land. Yet before the land itself has\nacknowledged touch of man, upon one in a hundred acres; and before one\nmile in ten thousand of the exhaustless ocean has ever felt the plunge\nof hook, or combing of the haul-nets; lo, we crawl, in flocks together\nupon the hot ground that stings us, even as the black grubs crowd upon\nthe harried nettle! Surely we are too much given to follow the tracks of\neach other.\n\nHowever, for a moralist, I never set up, and never shall, while common\nsense abides with me. Such a man must be very wretched in this pure\ndearth of morality; like a fisherman where no fish be; and most of us\nhave enough to do to attend to our own morals. Enough that I resolved\nto go; and as Lorna could not come with me, it was even worse than\nstopping. Nearly everybody vowed that I was a great fool indeed, to\nneglect so rudely--which was the proper word, they said--the pushing\nof my fortunes. But I answered that to push was rude, and I left it to\npeople who had no room; and thought that my fortune must be heavy, if it\nwould not move without pushing.\n\nLorna cried when I came away (which gave me great satisfaction), and she\nsent a whole trunkful of things for mother and Annie, and even Lizzie.\nAnd she seemed to think, though she said it not, that I made my own\noccasion for going, and might have stayed on till the winter. Whereas\nI knew well that my mother would think (and every one on the farm the\nsame) that here I had been in London, lagging, and taking my pleasure,\nand looking at shops, upon pretence of King's business, and leaving the\nharvest to reap itself, not to mention the spending of money; while all\nthe time there was nothing whatever, except my own love of adventure\nand sport, to keep me from coming home again. But I knew that my coat\nof arms, and title, would turn every bit of this grumbling into fine\nadmiration.\n\nAnd so it fell out, to a greater extent than even I desired; for all\nthe parishes round about united in a sumptuous dinner, at the Mother\nMelldrum inn--for now that good lady was dead, and her name and face\nset on a sign-post--to which I was invited, so that it was as good as a\nsummons. And if my health was no better next day, it was not from want\nof good wishes, any more than from stint of the liquor.\n\nIt is needless to say that the real gentry for a long time treated my\nnew honours with contempt and ridicule; but gradually as they found that\nI was not such a fool as to claim any equality with them, but went about\nmy farm-work, and threw another man at wrestling, and touched my hat to\nthe magistrates, just the same as ever; some gentlemen of the highest\nblood--of which we think a great deal more than of gold, around our\nneighbourhood--actually expressed a desire to make my acquaintance.\nAnd when, in a manner quite straightforward, and wholly free from\nbitterness, I thanked them for this (which appeared to me the highest\nhonour yet offered me), but declined to go into their company because it\nwould make me uncomfortable, and themselves as well, in a different\nway, they did what nearly all Englishmen do, when a thing is right and\nsensible. They shook hands with me; and said that they could not deny\nbut that there was reason in my view of the matter. And although they\nthemselves must be the losers--which was a handsome thing to say--they\nwould wait until I was a little older and more aware of my own value.\n\nNow this reminds me how it is that an English gentleman is so far in\nfront of foreign noblemen and princes. I have seen at times, a little,\nboth of one and of the other, and making more than due allowance for\nthe difficulties of language, and the difference of training, upon the\nwhole, the balance is in favour of our people. And this, because we have\ntwo weights, solid and (even in scale of manners) outweighing all light\ncomplaisance; to wit, the inborn love of justice, and the power of\nabiding.\n\nYet some people may be surprised that men with any love of justice,\nwhether inborn or otherwise, could continue to abide the arrogance, and\nrapacity, and tyranny of the Doones.\n\nFor now as the winter passed, the Doones were not keeping themselves at\nhome, as in honour they were bound to do. Twenty sheep a week, and one\nfat ox, and two stout red deer (for wholesome change of diet), as well\nas threescore bushels of flour, and two hogsheads and a half of cider,\nand a hundredweight of candles, not to mention other things of almost\nevery variety which they got by insisting upon it--surely these might\nhave sufficed to keep the people in their place, with no outburst of\nwantonness. Nevertheless, it was not so; they had made complaint about\nsomething--too much ewe-mutton, I think it was--and in spite of all the\npledges given, they had ridden forth, and carried away two maidens of\nour neighbourhood.\n\nNow these two maidens were known, because they had served the beer at\nan ale-house; and many men who had looked at them, over a pint or quart\nvessel (especially as they were comely girls), thought that it was very\nhard for them to go in that way, and perhaps themselves unwilling. And\ntheir mother (although she had taken some money, which the Doones were\nalways full of) declared that it was a robbery; and though it increased\nfor a while the custom, that must soon fall off again. And who would\nhave her two girls now, clever as they were and good?\n\nBefore we had finished meditating upon this loose outrage--for so I\nat least would call it, though people accustomed to the law may take a\ndifferent view of it--we had news of a thing far worse, which turned the\nhearts of our women sick. This I will tell in most careful language, so\nas to give offence to none, if skill of words may help it.*\n\n     * The following story is strictly true; and true it is that\n     the country-people rose, to a man, at this dastard cruelty,\n     and did what the Government failed to do.--Ed. L.D.\n\nMistress Margery Badcock, a healthy and upright young woman, with a\ngood rich colour, and one of the finest hen-roosts anywhere round our\nneighbourhood, was nursing her child about six of the clock, and\nlooking out for her husband. Now this child was too old to be nursed, as\neverybody told her; for he could run, say two yards alone, and perhaps\nfour or five, by holding to handles. And he had a way of looking round,\nand spreading his legs, and laughing, with his brave little body well\nfetched up, after a desperate journey to the end of the table, which\nhis mother said nothing could equal. Nevertheless, he would come to\nbe nursed, as regular as a clock, almost; and, inasmuch as he was\nthe first, both father and mother made much of him; for God only knew\nwhether they could ever compass such another one.\n\nChristopher Badcock was a tenant farmer, in the parish of Martinhoe,\nrenting some fifty acres of land, with a right of common attached to\nthem; and at this particular time, being now the month of February,\nand fine open weather, he was hard at work ploughing and preparing for\nspring corn. Therefore his wife was not surprised although the dusk\nwas falling, that farmer Christopher should be at work in \"blind man's\nholiday,\" as we call it.\n\nBut she was surprised, nay astonished, when by the light of the kitchen\nfire (brightened up for her husband), she saw six or seven great armed\nmen burst into the room upon her; and she screamed so that the maid in\nthe back kitchen heard her, but was afraid to come to help. Two of the\nstrongest and fiercest men at once seized poor young Margery; and though\nshe fought for her child and home, she was but an infant herself in\ntheir hands. In spite of tears, and shrieks, and struggles, they tore\nthe babe from the mother's arms, and cast it on the lime ash floor; then\nthey bore her away to their horses (for by this time she was senseless),\nand telling the others to sack the house, rode off with their prize to\nthe valley. And from the description of one of those two, who carried\noff the poor woman, I knew beyond all doubt that it was Carver Doone\nhimself.\n\n[Illustration: 652.jpg Siezed poor Margery]\n\nThe other Doones being left behind, and grieved perhaps in some\nrespects, set to with a will to scour the house, and to bring away all\nthat was good to eat. And being a little vexed herein (for the Badcocks\nwere not a rich couple) and finding no more than bacon, and eggs, and\ncheese, and little items, and nothing to drink but water; in a word,\ntheir taste being offended, they came back, to the kitchen, and stamped;\nand there was the baby lying.\n\nBy evil luck, this child began to squeal about his mother, having been\npetted hitherto, and wont to get all he wanted, by raising his voice but\na little. Now the mark of the floor was upon his head, as the maid (who\nhad stolen to look at him, when the rough men were swearing upstairs)\ngave evidence. And she put a dish-cloth under his head, and kissed him,\nand ran away again. Her name was Honour Jose, and she meant what was\nright by her master and mistress; but could not help being frightened.\nAnd many women have blamed her, as I think unduly, for her mode of\nforsaking baby so. If it had been her own baby, instinct rather than\nreason might have had the day with her; but the child being born of her\nmistress, she wished him good luck, and left him, as the fierce men came\ndownstairs. And being alarmed by their power of language (because they\nhad found no silver), she crept away in a breathless hurry, and afraid\nhow her breath might come back to her. For oftentime she had hiccoughs.\n\nWhile this good maid was in the oven, by side of back-kitchen fireplace,\nwith a faggot of wood drawn over her, and lying so that her own heart\nbeat worse than if she were baking; the men (as I said before) came\ndownstairs, and stamped around the baby.\n\n\"Rowland, is the bacon good?\" one of them asked with an oath or two; \"it\nis too bad of Carver to go off with the only prize, and leave us in a\nstarving cottage; and not enough to eat for two of us. Fetch down the\nstaves of the rack, my boy. What was farmer to have for supper?\"\n\n\"Naught but an onion or two, and a loaf and a rasher of rusty bacon.\nThese poor devils live so badly, they are not worth robbing.\"\n\n\"No game! Then let us have a game of loriot with the baby! It will\nbe the best thing that could befall a lusty infant heretic. Ride a\ncock-horse to Banbury Cross. Bye, bye, baby Bunting; toss him up, and\nlet me see if my wrist be steady.\"\n\nThe cruelty of this man is a thing it makes me sick to speak of; enough\nthat when the poor baby fell (without attempt at cry or scream, thinking\nit part of his usual play, when they tossed him up, to come down again),\nthe maid in the oven of the back-kitchen, not being any door between,\nheard them say as follows,--\n\n    \"If any man asketh who killed thee,\n     Say 'twas the Doones of Bagworthy.'*\n\n          * Always pronounced \"Badgery.\"\n\nNow I think that when we heard this story, and poor Kit Badcock came all\naround, in a sort of half-crazy manner, not looking up at any one,\nbut dropping his eyes, and asking whether we thought he had been\nwell-treated, and seeming void of regard for life, if this were all the\nstyle of it; then having known him a lusty man, and a fine singer in an\nale-house, and much inclined to lay down the law, as show a high hand\nabout women, I really think that it moved us more than if he had gone\nabout ranting, and raving, and vowing revenge upon every one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX\n\nCOMPELLED TO VOLUNTEER\n\n[Illustration: 654.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThere had been some trouble in our own home during the previous autumn,\nwhile yet I was in London. For certain noted fugitives from the army\nof King Monmouth (which he himself had deserted, in a low and currish\nmanner), having failed to obtain free shipment from the coast near\nWatersmouth, had returned into the wilds of Exmoor, trusting to\nlurk, and be comforted among the common people. Neither were they\ndisappointed, for a certain length of time; nor in the end was their\ndisappointment caused by fault on our part. Major Wade was one of them;\nan active and well-meaning man; but prone to fail in courage, upon\nlasting trial; although in a moment ready. Squire John Whichehalse (not\nthe baron) and Parson Powell* caught him (two or three months before my\nreturn) in Farley farmhouse, near Brendon. He had been up at our house\nseveral times; and Lizzie thought a great deal of him. And well I know\nthat if at that time I had been in the neighbourhood, he should not have\nbeen taken so easily.\n\n     * Not our parson Bowden, nor any more a friend of his. Our\n     Parson Bowden never had naught whatever to do with it; and\n     never smoked a pipe with Parson Powell after it.--J.R.\n\nJohn Birch, the farmer who had sheltered him, was so fearful of\npunishment, that he hanged himself, in a few days' time, and even before\nhe was apprehended. But nothing was done to Grace Howe, of Bridgeball,\nwho had been Wade's greatest comforter; neither was anything done to us;\nalthough Eliza had added greatly to mother's alarm and danger by falling\nupon Rector Powell, and most soundly rating him for his meanness,\nand his cruelty, and cowardice, as she called it, in setting men\nwith firearms upon a poor helpless fugitive, and robbing all our\nneighbourhood of its fame for hospitality. However, by means of Sergeant\nBloxham, and his good report of us, as well as by virtue of Wade's\nconfession (which proved of use to the Government) my mother escaped all\npenalties.\n\nIt is likely enough that good folk will think it hard upon our\nneighbourhood to be threatened, and sometimes heavily punished, for\nkindness and humanity; and yet to be left to help ourselves against\ntyranny, and base rapine. And now at last our gorge was risen, and\nour hearts in tumult. We had borne our troubles long, as a wise and\nwholesome chastisement; quite content to have some few things of our own\nunmeddled with. But what could a man dare to call his own, or what right\ncould he have to wish for it, while he left his wife and children at the\npleasure of any stranger?\n\nThe people came flocking all around me, at the blacksmith's forge, and\nthe Brendon alehouse; and I could scarce come out of church, but they\ngot me among the tombstones. They all agreed that I was bound to take\ncommand and management. I bade them go to the magistrates, but they\nsaid they had been too often. Then I told them that I had no wits for\nordering of an armament, although I could find fault enough with the one\nwhich had not succeeded. But they would hearken to none of this.\n\nAll they said was \"Try to lead us; and we will try not to run away.\"\n\nThis seemed to me to be common sense, and good stuff, instead of mere\nbragging; moreover, I myself was moved by the bitter wrongs of Margery,\nhaving known her at the Sunday-school, ere ever I went to Tiverton;\nand having in those days, serious thoughts of making her my\nsweetheart; although she was three years my elder. But now I felt this\ndifficulty--the Doones had behaved very well to our farm, and to mother,\nand all of us, while I was away in London. Therefore, would it not be\nshabby, and mean, for me to attack them now?\n\nYet being pressed still harder and harder, as day by day the excitement\ngrew (with more and more talking over it), and no one else coming forward\nto undertake the business, I agreed at last to this; that if the Doones,\nupon fair challenge, would not endeavour to make amends by giving up\nMistress Margery, as well as the man who had slain the babe, then I\nwould lead the expedition, and do my best to subdue them. All our men\nwere content with this, being thoroughly well assured from experience,\nthat the haughty robbers would only shoot any man who durst approach\nthem with such proposal.\n\nAnd then arose a difficult question--who was to take the risk of making\novertures so unpleasant? I waited for the rest to offer; and as none was\nready, the burden fell on me, and seemed to be of my own inviting. Hence\nI undertook the task, sooner than reason about it; for to give the cause\nof everything is worse than to go through with it.\n\nIt may have been three of the afternoon, when leaving my witnesses\nbehind (for they preferred the background) I appeared with our Lizzie's\nwhite handkerchief upon a kidney-bean stick, at the entrance to the\nrobbers' dwelling. Scarce knowing what might come of it, I had taken the\nwise precaution of fastening a Bible over my heart, and another across\nmy spinal column, in case of having to run away, with rude men shooting\nafter me. For my mother said that the Word of God would stop a two-inch\nbullet, with three ounces of powder behind it. Now I took no weapons,\nsave those of the Spirit, for fear of being misunderstood. But I could\nnot bring myself to think that any of honourable birth would take\nadvantage of an unarmed man coming in guise of peace to them.\n\nAnd this conclusion of mine held good, at least for a certain length of\ntime; inasmuch as two decent Doones appeared, and hearing of my purpose,\noffered, without violence, to go and fetch the Captain; if I would stop\nwhere I was, and not begin to spy about anything. To this, of course,\nI agreed at once; for I wanted no more spying, because I had thorough\nknowledge of all ins and outs already. Therefore, I stood waiting\nsteadily, with one hand in my pocket feeling a sample of corn for\nmarket; and the other against the rock, while I wondered to see it so\nbrown already.\n\nThose men came back in a little while, with a sharp short message that\nCaptain Carver would come out and speak to me by-and-by, when his pipe\nwas finished. Accordingly, I waited long, and we talked about the signs\nof bloom for the coming apple season, and the rain that had fallen last\nWednesday night, and the principal dearth of Devonshire, that it will\nnot grow many cowslips--which we quite agreed to be the prettiest of\nspring flowers; and all the time I was wondering how many black and\ndeadly deeds these two innocent youths had committed, even since last\nChristmas.\n\nAt length, a heavy and haughty step sounded along the stone roof of the\nway; and then the great Carver Doone drew up, and looked at me rather\nscornfully. Not with any spoken scorn, nor flash of strong contumely;\nbut with that air of thinking little, and praying not to be troubled,\nwhich always vexes a man who feels that he ought not to be despised so,\nand yet knows not how to help it.\n\n\"What is it you want, young man?\" he asked, as if he had never seen me\nbefore.\n\nIn spite of that strong loathing which I always felt at sight of him,\nI commanded my temper moderately, and told him that I was come for his\ngood, and that of his worshipful company, far more than for my own.\nThat a general feeling of indignation had arisen among us at the recent\nbehaviour of certain young men, for which he might not be answerable,\nand for which we would not condemn him, without knowing the rights of\nthe question. But I begged him clearly to understand that a vile and\ninhuman wrong had been done, and such as we could not put up with; but\nthat if he would make what amends he could by restoring the poor woman,\nand giving up that odious brute who had slain the harmless infant, we\nwould take no further motion; and things should go on as usual. As I put\nthis in the fewest words that would meet my purpose, I was grieved to\nsee a disdainful smile spread on his sallow countenance. Then he made me\na bow of mock courtesy, and replied as follows,--\n\n[Illustration: 657.jpg Disdainful smile]\n\n\"Sir John, your new honours have turned your poor head, as might have\nbeen expected. We are not in the habit of deserting anything that\nbelongs to us; far less our sacred relatives. The insolence of your\ndemand well-nigh outdoes the ingratitude. If there be a man upon Exmoor\nwho has grossly ill-used us, kidnapped our young women, and slain half\na dozen of our young men, you are that outrageous rogue, Sir John. And\nafter all this, how have we behaved? We have laid no hand upon your\nfarm, we have not carried off your women, we have even allowed you to\ntake our Queen, by creeping and crawling treachery; and we have given\nyou leave of absence to help your cousin the highwayman, and to come\nhome with a title. And now, how do you requite us? By inflaming the\nboorish indignation at a little frolic of our young men; and by\ncoming with insolent demands, to yield to which would ruin us. Ah, you\nungrateful viper!\"\n\nAs he turned away in sorrow from me, shaking his head at my badness, I\nbecame so overcome (never having been quite assured, even by people's\npraises, about my own goodness); moreover, the light which he threw upon\nthings differed so greatly from my own, that, in a word--not to be too\nlong--I feared that I was a villain. And with many bitter pangs--for\nI have bad things to repent of--I began at my leisure to ask myself\nwhether or not this bill of indictment against John Ridd was true. Some\nof it I knew to be (however much I condemned myself) altogether out of\nreason; for instance, about my going away with Lorna very quietly, over\nthe snow, and to save my love from being starved away from me. In this\nthere was no creeping neither crawling treachery; for all was done with\nsliding; and yet I was so out of training for being charged by other\npeople beyond mine own conscience, that Carver Doone's harsh words came\non me, like prickly spinach sown with raking. Therefore I replied, and\nsaid,--\n\n\"It is true that I owe you gratitude, sir, for a certain time of\nforbearance; and it is to prove my gratitude that I am come here now. I\ndo not think that my evil deeds can be set against your own; although I\ncannot speak flowingly upon my good deeds as you can. I took your Queen\nbecause you starved her, having stolen her long before, and killed her\nmother and brother. This is not for me to dwell upon now; any more than\nI would say much about your murdering of my father. But how the balance\nhangs between us, God knows better than thou or I, thou low miscreant,\nCarver Doone.\"\n\nI had worked myself up, as I always do, in the manner of heavy men;\ngrowing hot like an ill-washered wheel revolving, though I start with\na cool axle; and I felt ashamed of myself for heat, and ready to ask\npardon. But Carver Doone regarded me with a noble and fearless grandeur.\n\n\"I have given thee thy choice, John Ridd,\" he said in a lofty manner,\nwhich made me drop away under him; \"I always wish to do my best with the\nworst people who come near me. And of all I have ever met with thou art\nthe very worst, Sir John, and the most dishonest.\"\n\nNow after all my labouring to pay every man to a penny, and to allow the\nwomen over, when among the couch-grass (which is a sad thing for their\ngowns), to be charged like this, I say, so amazed me that I stood, with\nmy legs quite open, and ready for an earthquake. And the scornful way\nin which he said \"Sir John,\" went to my very heart, reminding me of my\nlittleness. But seeing no use in bandying words, nay, rather the chance\nof mischief, I did my best to look calmly at him, and to say with a\nquiet voice, \"Farewell, Carver Doone, this time, our day of reckoning is\nnigh.\"\n\n\"Thou fool, it is come,\" he cried, leaping aside into the niche of rock\nby the doorway; \"Fire!\"\n\nSave for the quickness of spring, and readiness, learned in many a\nwrestling bout, that knavish trick must have ended me; but scarce was\nthe word \"fire!\" out of his mouth ere I was out of fire, by a single\nbound behind the rocky pillar of the opening. In this jump I was so\nbrisk, at impulse of the love of life (for I saw the muzzles set upon\nme from the darkness of the cavern), that the men who had trained their\nguns upon me with goodwill and daintiness, could not check their fingers\ncrooked upon the heavy triggers; and the volley sang with a roar behind\nit, down the avenue of crags.\n\n[Illustration: 660.jpg Volley sang with a roar]\n\nWith one thing and another, and most of all the treachery of this\ndastard scheme, I was so amazed that I turned and ran, at the very top\nof my speed, away from these vile fellows; and luckily for me, they\nhad not another charge to send after me. And thus by good fortune, I\nescaped; but with a bitter heart, and mind at their treacherous usage.\n\nWithout any further hesitation; I agreed to take command of the honest\nmen who were burning to punish, ay and destroy, those outlaws, as now\nbeyond all bearing. One condition, however, I made, namely, that the\nCounsellor should be spared if possible; not because he was less a\nvillain than any of the others, but that he seemed less violent; and\nabove all, had been good to Annie. And I found hard work to make them\nlisten to my wish upon this point; for of all the Doones, Sir Counsellor\nhad made himself most hated, by his love of law and reason.\n\nWe arranged that all our men should come and fall into order with pike\nand musket, over against our dung-hill, and we settled early in the day,\nthat their wives might come and look at them. For most of these men had\ngood wives; quite different from sweethearts, such as the militia had;\nwomen indeed who could hold to a man, and see to him, and bury him--if\nhis luck were evil--and perhaps have no one afterwards. And all these\nwomen pressed their rights upon their precious husbands, and brought so\nmany children with them, and made such a fuss, and hugging, and racing\nafter little legs, that our farm-yard might be taken for an out-door\nschool for babies rather than a review ground.\n\nI myself was to and fro among the children continually; for if I love\nanything in the world, foremost I love children. They warm, and yet they\ncool our hearts, as we think of what we were, and what in young clothes\nwe hoped to be; and how many things have come across. And to see our\nmotives moving in the little things that know not what their aim or\nobject is, must almost or ought at least, to lead us home, and soften\nus. For either end of life is home; both source and issue being God.\n\nNevertheless, I must confess that the children were a plague sometimes.\nThey never could have enough of me--being a hundred to one, you might\nsay--but I had more than enough of them; and yet was not contented.\nFor they had so many ways of talking, and of tugging at my hair, and\nof sitting upon my neck (not even two with their legs alike), and they\nforced me to jump so vehemently, seeming to court the peril of my coming\ndown neck and crop with them, and urging me still to go faster, however\nfast I might go with them; I assure you that they were sometimes so hard\nand tyrannical over me, that I might almost as well have been among the\nvery Doones themselves.\n\nNevertheless, the way in which the children made me useful proved also\nof some use to me; for their mothers were so pleased by the exertions of\nthe \"great Gee-gee\"--as all the small ones entitled me--that they gave\nme unlimited power and authority over their husbands; moreover, they did\ntheir utmost among their relatives round about, to fetch recruits\nfor our little band. And by such means, several of the yeomanry from\nBarnstaple, and from Tiverton, were added to our number; and inasmuch\nas these were armed with heavy swords, and short carabines, their\nappearance was truly formidable.\n\nTom Faggus also joined us heartily, being now quite healed of his\nwound, except at times when the wind was easterly. He was made second in\ncommand to me; and I would gladly have had him first, as more fertile\nin expedients; but he declined such rank on the plea that I knew most\nof the seat of war; besides that I might be held in some measure to draw\nauthority from the King. Also Uncle Ben came over to help us with his\nadvice and presence, as well as with a band of stout warehousemen, whom\nhe brought from Dulverton. For he had never forgiven the old outrage put\nupon him; and though it had been to his interest to keep quiet during\nthe last attack, under Commander Stickles--for the sake of his secret\ngold mine--yet now he was in a position to give full vent to his\nfeelings. For he and his partners when fully-assured of the value of\ntheir diggings, had obtained from the Crown a licence to adventure in\nsearch of minerals, by payment of a heavy fine and a yearly royalty.\nTherefore they had now no longer any cause for secrecy, neither for\ndread of the outlaws; having so added to their force as to be a match\nfor them. And although Uncle Ben was not the man to keep his miners idle\nan hour more than might be helped, he promised that when we had fixed\nthe moment for an assault on the valley, a score of them should come\nto aid us, headed by Simon Carfax, and armed with the guns which they\nalways kept for the protection of their gold.\n\n[Illustration: 663.jpg Having pipes and schnapps]\n\nNow whether it were Uncle Ben, or whether it were Tom Faggus or even my\nown self--for all three of us claimed the sole honour--is more than I\nthink fair to settle without allowing them a voice. But at any rate, a\nclever thing was devised among us; and perhaps it would be the fairest\nthing to say that this bright stratagem (worthy of the great Duke\nhimself) was contributed, little by little, among the entire three of\nus, all having pipes, and schnapps-and-water, in the chimney-corner.\nHowever, the world, which always judges according to reputation, vowed\nthat so fine a stroke of war could only come from a highwayman; and so\nTom Faggus got all the honour, at less perhaps than a third of the cost.\n\nNot to attempt to rob him of it--for robbers, more than any other,\ncontend for rights of property--let me try to describe this grand\nartifice. It was known that the Doones were fond of money, as well as\nstrong drink, and other things; and more especially fond of gold, when\nthey could get it pure and fine. Therefore it was agreed that in this\nway we should tempt them; for we knew that they looked with ridicule\nupon our rustic preparations; after repulsing King's troopers, and the\nmilitia of two counties, was it likely that they should yield their\nfortress to a set of ploughboys? We, for our part, felt of course,\nthe power of this reasoning, and that where regular troops had failed,\nhalf-armed countrymen must fail, except by superior judgment and harmony\nof action. Though perhaps the militia would have sufficed, if they had\nonly fought against the foe, instead of against each other. From these\nthings we took warning; having failed through over-confidence, was it\nnot possible now to make the enemy fail through the selfsame cause?\n\nHence, what we devised was this; to delude from home a part of the\nrobbers, and fall by surprise on the other part. We caused it to be\nspread abroad that a large heap of gold was now collected at the mine\nof the Wizard's Slough. And when this rumour must have reached them,\nthrough women who came to and fro, as some entirely faithful to them\nwere allowed to do, we sent Captain Simon Carfax, the father of little\nGwenny, to demand an interview with the Counsellor, by night, and as it\nwere secretly. Then he was to set forth a list of imaginary grievances\nagainst the owners of the mine; and to offer partly through resentment,\npartly through the hope of gain, to betray into their hands, upon the\nFriday night, by far the greatest weight of gold as yet sent up for\nrefining. He was to have one quarter part, and they to take the residue.\nBut inasmuch as the convoy across the moors, under his command, would\nbe strong, and strongly armed, the Doones must be sure to send not less\nthan a score of men, if possible. He himself, at a place agreed upon,\nand fit for an ambuscade, would call a halt, and contrive in the\ndarkness to pour a little water into the priming of his company's guns.\n\nIt cost us some trouble and a great deal of money to bring the sturdy\nCornishman into this deceitful part; and perhaps he never would have\nconsented but for his obligation to me, and the wrongs (as he said) of\nhis daughter. However, as he was the man for the task, both from his\ncoolness and courage, and being known to have charge of the mine, I\npressed him, until he undertook to tell all the lies we required.\nAnd right well he did it too, having once made up his mind to it; and\nperceiving that his own interests called for the total destruction of\nthe robbers.\n\n[Illustration: 664.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI\n\nA LONG ACCOUNT SETTLED\n\n[Illustration: 665.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nHaving resolved on a night-assault (as our undisciplined men,\nthree-fourths of whom had never been shot at, could not fairly be\nexpected to march up to visible musket-mouths), we cared not much about\ndrilling our forces, only to teach them to hold a musket, so far as we\ncould supply that weapon to those with the cleverest eyes; and to give\nthem familiarity with the noise it made in exploding. And we fixed upon\nFriday night for our venture, because the moon would be at the full; and\nour powder was coming from Dulverton on the Friday afternoon.\n\nUncle Reuben did not mean to expose himself to shooting, his time of\nlife for risk of life being now well over and the residue too valuable.\nBut his counsels, and his influence, and above all his warehousemen,\nwell practised in beating carpets, were of true service to us. His\nminers also did great wonders, having a grudge against the Doones; as\nindeed who had not for thirty miles round their valley?\n\nIt was settled that the yeomen, having good horses under them, should\ngive account (with the miners' help) of as many Doones as might be\ndespatched to plunder the pretended gold. And as soon as we knew that\nthis party of robbers, be it more or less, was out of hearing from the\nvalley, we were to fall to, ostensibly at the Doone-gate (which was\nimpregnable now), but in reality upon their rear, by means of my old\nwater-slide. For I had chosen twenty young fellows, partly miners, and\npartly warehousemen, and sheep farmers, and some of other vocations, but\nall to be relied upon for spirit and power of climbing. And with proper\ntools to aid us, and myself to lead the way, I felt no doubt whatever\nbut that we could all attain the crest where first I had met with Lorna.\n\nUpon the whole, I rejoiced that Lorna was not present now. It must have\nbeen irksome to her feelings to have all her kindred and old associates\n(much as she kept aloof from them) put to death without ceremony, or\nelse putting all of us to death. For all of us were resolved this\ntime to have no more shilly-shallying; but to go through with a nasty\nbusiness, in the style of honest Englishmen, when the question comes to\n\"Your life or mine.\"\n\nThere was hardly a man among us who had not suffered bitterly from the\nmiscreants now before us. One had lost his wife perhaps, another had\nlost a daughter--according to their ages, another had lost his favourite\ncow; in a word, there was scarcely any one who had not to complain of\na hayrick; and what surprised me then, not now, was that the men least\ninjured made the greatest push concerning it. But be the wrong too great\nto speak of, or too small to swear about, from poor Kit Badcock to rich\nMaster Huckaback, there was not one but went heart and soul for stamping\nout these firebrands.\n\nThe moon was lifting well above the shoulder of the uplands, when we,\nthe chosen band, set forth, having the short cut along the valleys to\nfoot of the Bagworthy water; and therefore having allowed the rest an\nhour, to fetch round the moors and hills; we were not to begin our climb\nuntil we heard a musket fired from the heights on the left-hand side,\nwhere John Fry himself was stationed, upon his own and his wife's\nrequest; so as to keep out of action. And that was the place where I had\nbeen used to sit, and to watch for Lorna. And John Fry was to fire his\ngun, with a ball of wool inside it, so soon as he heard the hurly-burly\nat the Doone-gate beginning; which we, by reason of waterfall, could not\nhear, down in the meadows there.\n\nWe waited a very long time, with the moon marching up heaven\nsteadfastly, and the white fog trembling in chords and columns, like\na silver harp of the meadows. And then the moon drew up the fogs, and\nscarfed herself in white with them; and so being proud, gleamed upon the\nwater, like a bride at her looking-glass; and yet there was no sound of\neither John Fry, or his blunderbuss.\n\nI began to think that the worthy John, being out of all danger, and\nhaving brought a counterpane (according to his wife's directions,\nbecause one of the children had a cold), must veritably have gone to\nsleep; leaving other people to kill, or be killed, as might be the will\nof God; so that he were comfortable. But herein I did wrong to John,\nand am ready to acknowledge it; for suddenly the most awful noise that\nanything short of thunder could make, came down among the rocks, and\nwent and hung upon the corners.\n\n\"The signal, my lads,\" I cried, leaping up and rubbing my eyes; for even\nnow, while condemning John unjustly, I was giving him right to be hard\nupon me. \"Now hold on by the rope, and lay your quarter-staffs across,\nmy lads; and keep your guns pointing to heaven, lest haply we shoot one\nanother.\"\n\n\"Us shan't never shutt one anoother, wi' our goons at that mark, I\nreckon,\" said an oldish chap, but as tough as leather, and esteemed a\nwit for his dryness.\n\n\"You come next to me, old Ike; you be enough to dry up the waters; now,\nremember, all lean well forward. If any man throws his weight back, down\nhe goes; and perhaps he may never get up again; and most likely he will\nshoot himself.\"\n\nI was still more afraid of their shooting me; for my chief alarm in\nthis steep ascent was neither of the water nor of the rocks, but of\nthe loaded guns we bore. If any man slipped, off might go his gun, and\nhowever good his meaning, I being first was most likely to take far more\nthan I fain would apprehend.\n\nFor this cause, I had debated with Uncle Ben and with Cousin Tom as to\nthe expediency of our climbing with guns unloaded. But they, not being\nin the way themselves, assured me that there was nothing to fear, except\nthrough uncommon clumsiness; and that as for charging our guns at\nthe top, even veteran troops could scarcely be trusted to perform it\nproperly in the hurry, and the darkness, and the noise of fighting\nbefore them.\n\nHowever, thank God, though a gun went off, no one was any the worse\nfor it, neither did the Doones notice it, in the thick of the firing in\nfront of them. For the orders to those of the sham attack, conducted by\nTom Faggus, were to make the greatest possible noise, without exposure\nof themselves; until we, in the rear, had fallen to; which John Fry was\nagain to give the signal of.\n\nTherefore we, of the chosen band, stole up the meadow quietly, keeping\nin the blots of shade, and hollow of the watercourse. And the earliest\nnotice the Counsellor had, or any one else, of our presence, was the\nblazing of the log-wood house, where lived that villain Carver. It\nwas my especial privilege to set this house on fire; upon which I had\ninsisted, exclusively and conclusively. No other hand but mine\nshould lay a brand, or strike steel on flint for it; I had made all\npreparations carefully for a goodly blaze. And I must confess that I\nrubbed my hands, with a strong delight and comfort, when I saw the home\nof that man, who had fired so many houses, having its turn of smoke, and\nblaze, and of crackling fury.\n\nWe took good care, however, to burn no innocent women or children in\nthat most righteous destruction. For we brought them all out beforehand;\nsome were glad, and some were sorry; according to their dispositions.\nFor Carver had ten or a dozen wives; and perhaps that had something to\ndo with his taking the loss of Lorna so easily. One child I noticed, as\nI saved him; a fair and handsome little fellow, whom (if Carver Doone\ncould love anything on earth beside his wretched self) he did love. The\nboy climbed on my back and rode; and much as I hated his father, it was\nnot in my heart to say or do a thing to vex him.\n\nLeaving these poor injured people to behold their burning home, we drew\naside, by my directions, into the covert beneath the cliff. But not\nbefore we had laid our brands to three other houses, after calling the\nwomen forth, and bidding them go for their husbands, and to come and\nfight a hundred of us. In the smoke and rush, and fire, they believed\nthat we were a hundred; and away they ran, in consternation, to the\nbattle at the Doone-gate.\n\n\"All Doone-town is on fire, on fire!\" we heard them shrieking as they\nwent; \"a hundred soldiers are burning it, with a dreadful great man at\nthe head of them!\"\n\nPresently, just as I expected, back came the warriors of the Doones;\nleaving but two or three at the gate, and burning with wrath to crush\nunder foot the presumptuous clowns in their valley. Just then the waxing\nfire leaped above the red crest of the cliffs, and danced on the pillars\nof the forest, and lapped like a tide on the stones of the slope. All\nthe valley flowed with light, and the limpid waters reddened, and the\nfair young women shone, and the naked children glistened.\n\nBut the finest sight of all was to see those haughty men striding down\nthe causeway darkly, reckless of their end, but resolute to have two\nlives for every one. A finer dozen of young men could not have been\nfound in the world perhaps, nor a braver, nor a viler one.\n\nSeeing how few there were of them, I was very loath to fire, although I\ncovered the leader, who appeared to be dashing Charley; for they were at\neasy distance now, brightly shone by the fire-light, yet ignorant where\nto look for us. I thought that we might take them prisoners--though\nwhat good that could be God knows, as they must have been hanged\nthereafter--anyhow I was loath to shoot, or to give the word to my\nfollowers.\n\nBut my followers waited for no word; they saw a fair shot at the men\nthey abhorred, the men who had robbed them of home or of love, and the\nchance was too much for their charity. At a signal from old Ikey, who\nlevelled his own gun first, a dozen muskets were discharged, and half\nof the Doones dropped lifeless, like so many logs of firewood, or\nchopping-blocks rolled over.\n\nAlthough I had seen a great battle before, and a hundred times the\ncarnage, this appeared to me to be horrible; and I was at first inclined\nto fall upon our men for behaving so. But one instant showed me that\nthey were right; for while the valley was filled with howling, and with\nshrieks of women, and the beams of the blazing houses fell, and hissed\nin the bubbling river; all the rest of the Doones leaped at us, like\nso many demons. They fired wildly, not seeing us well among the hazel\nbushes; and then they clubbed their muskets, or drew their swords, as\nmight be; and furiously drove at us.\n\nFor a moment, although we were twice their number, we fell back before\ntheir valorous fame, and the power of their onset. For my part, admiring\ntheir courage greatly, and counting it slur upon manliness that two\nshould be down upon one so, I withheld my hand awhile; for I cared to\nmeet none but Carver; and he was not among them. The whirl and hurry\nof this fight, and the hard blows raining down--for now all guns were\nempty--took away my power of seeing, or reasoning upon anything. Yet\none thing I saw, which dwelled long with me; and that was Christopher\nBadcock spending his life to get Charley's.\n\nHow he had found out, none may tell; both being dead so long ago; but,\nat any rate, he had found out that Charley was the man who had robbed\nhim of his wife and honour. It was Carver Doone who took her away, but\nCharleworth Doone was beside him; and, according to cast of dice, she\nfell to Charley's share. All this Kit Badcock (who was mad, according\nto our measures) had discovered, and treasured up; and now was his\nrevenge-time.\n\nHe had come into the conflict without a weapon of any kind; only begging\nme to let him be in the very thick of it. For him, he said, life was no\nmatter, after the loss of his wife and child; but death was matter to\nhim, and he meant to make the most of it. Such a face I never saw, and\nnever hope to see again, as when poor Kit Badcock spied Charley coming\ntowards us.\n\nWe had thought this man a patient fool, a philosopher of a little sort,\nor one who could feel nothing. And his quiet manner of going about, and\nthe gentleness of his answers (when some brutes asked him where his wife\nwas, and whether his baby had been well-trussed), these had misled us\nto think that the man would turn the mild cheek to everything. But I, in\nthe loneliness of our barn, had listened, and had wept with him.\n\nTherefore was I not surprised, so much as all the rest of us, when, in\nthe foremost of red light, Kit went up to Charleworth Doone, as if to\nsome inheritance; and took his seisin of right upon him, being himself a\npowerful man; and begged a word aside with him. What they said aside, I\nknow not; all I know is that without weapon, each man killed the other.\nAnd Margery Badcock came, and wept, and hung upon her poor husband; and\ndied, that summer, of heart-disease.\n\nNow for these and other things (whereof I could tell a thousand) was the\nreckoning come that night; and not a line we missed of it; soon as our\nbad blood was up. I like not to tell of slaughter, though it might be\nof wolves and tigers; and that was a night of fire and slaughter, and\nof very long-harboured revenge. Enough that ere the daylight broke\nupon that wan March morning, the only Doones still left alive were the\nCounsellor and Carver. And of all the dwellings of the Doones (inhabited\nwith luxury, and luscious taste, and licentiousness) not even one was\nleft, but all made potash in the river.\n\nThis may seem a violent and unholy revenge upon them. And I (who led\nthe heart of it) have in these my latter years doubted how I shall\nbe judged, not of men--for God only knows the errors of man's\njudgments--but by that great God Himself, the front of whose forehead is\nmercy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII\n\nTHE COUNSELLOR AND THE CARVER\n\n[Illustration: 671.jpg Law and Justice]\n\nFrom that great confusion--for nothing can be broken up, whether lawful\nor unlawful, without a vast amount of dust, and many people grumbling,\nand mourning for the good old times, when all the world was happiness,\nand every man a gentleman, and the sun himself far brighter than since\nthe brassy idol upon which he shone was broken--from all this loss of\nancient landmarks (as unrobbed men began to call our clearance of those\nmurderers) we returned on the following day, almost as full of anxiety\nas we were of triumph. In the first place, what could we possibly do\nwith all these women and children, thrown on our hands as one might say,\nwith none to protect and care for them? Again how should we answer to\nthe justices of the peace, or perhaps even to Lord Jeffreys, for having,\nwithout even a warrant, taken the law into our own hands, and abated\nour nuisance so forcibly? And then, what was to be done with the spoil,\nwhich was of great value; though the diamond necklace came not to public\nlight? For we saw a mighty host of claimants already leaping up for\nbooty. Every man who had ever been robbed, expected usury on his loss;\nthe lords of the manors demanded the whole; and so did the King's\nCommissioner of revenue at Porlock; and so did the men who had fought\nour battle; while even the parsons, both Bowden and Powell, and another\nwho had no parish in it, threatened us with the just wrath of the\nChurch, unless each had tithes of the whole of it.\n\nNow this was not as it ought to be; and it seemed as if by burning the\nnest of robbers, we had but hatched their eggs; until being made sole\nguardian of the captured treasure (by reason of my known honesty) I\nhit upon a plan, which gave very little satisfaction; yet carried this\nadvantage, that the grumblers argued against one another and for the\nmost part came to blows; which renewed their goodwill to me, as being\nabused by the adversary.\n\nAnd my plan was no more than this--not to pay a farthing to lord of\nmanor, parson, or even King's Commissioner, but after making good some\nof the recent and proven losses--where the men could not afford to\nlose--to pay the residue (which might be worth some fifty thousand\npounds) into the Exchequer at Westminster; and then let all the\nclaimants file what wills they pleased in Chancery.\n\nNow this was a very noble device, for the mere name of Chancery, and the\nhigh repute of the fees therein, and low repute of the lawyers, and the\ncomfortable knowledge that the woolsack itself is the golden fleece,\nabsorbing gold for ever, if the standard be but pure; consideration of\nthese things staved off at once the lords of the manors, and all the\nlittle farmers, and even those whom most I feared; videlicet, the\nparsons. And the King's Commissioner was compelled to profess himself\ncontented, although of all he was most aggrieved; for his pickings would\nhave been goodly.\n\nMoreover, by this plan I made--although I never thought of that--a\nmighty friend worth all the enemies, whom the loss of money moved. The\nfirst man now in the kingdom (by virtue perhaps of energy, rather than\nof excellence) was the great Lord Jeffreys, appointed the head of the\nEquity, as well as the law of the realm, for his kindness in hanging\nfive hundred people, without the mere brief of trial. Nine out of ten\nof these people were innocent, it was true; but that proved the merit of\nthe Lord Chief Justice so much the greater for hanging them, as showing\nwhat might be expected of him, when he truly got hold of a guilty man.\nNow the King had seen the force of this argument; and not being without\ngratitude for a high-seasoned dish of cruelty, had promoted the only man\nin England, combining the gifts of both butcher and cook.\n\nNevertheless, I do beg you all to believe of me--and I think that, after\nfollowing me so long, you must believe it--that I did not even know at\nthe time of Lord Jeffreys's high promotion. Not that my knowledge of\nthis would have led me to act otherwise in the matter; for my object was\nto pay into an office, and not to any official; neither if I had known\nthe fact, could I have seen its bearing upon the receipt of my money.\nFor the King's Exchequer is, meseemeth, of the Common Law; while\nChancery is of Equity, and well named for its many chances. But the true\nresult of the thing was this--Lord Jeffreys being now head of the law,\nand almost head of the kingdom, got possession of that money, and was\nkindly pleased with it.\n\nAnd this met our second difficulty; for the law having won and laughed\nover the spoil, must have injured its own title by impugning our\nlegality.\n\nNext, with regard to the women and children, we were long in a state of\nperplexity. We did our very best at the farm, and so did many others to\nprovide for them, until they should manage about their own subsistence.\nAnd after a while this trouble went, as nearly all troubles go with\ntime. Some of the women were taken back by their parents, or their\nhusbands, or it may be their sweethearts; and those who failed of this,\nwent forth, some upon their own account to the New World plantations,\nwhere the fairer sex is valuable; and some to English cities; and the\nplainer ones to field work. And most of the children went with their\nmothers, or were bound apprentices; only Carver Doone's handsome child\nhad lost his mother and stayed with me.\n\nThis boy went about with me everywhere. He had taken as much of liking\nto me--first shown in his eyes by the firelight--as his father had of\nhatred; and I, perceiving his noble courage, scorn of lies, and high\nspirit, became almost as fond of Ensie as he was of me. He told us that\nhis name was \"Ensie,\" meant for \"Ensor,\" I suppose, from his father's\ngrandfather, the old Sir Ensor Doone. And this boy appeared to be\nCarver's heir, having been born in wedlock, contrary to the general\nmanner and custom of the Doones.\n\nHowever, although I loved the poor child, I could not help feeling very\nuneasy about the escape of his father, the savage and brutal Carver.\nThis man was left to roam the country, homeless, foodless, and\ndesperate, with his giant strength, and great skill in arms, and the\nwhole world to be revenged upon. For his escape the miners, as I shall\nshow, were answerable; but of the Counsellor's safe departure the burden\nlay on myself alone. And inasmuch as there are people who consider\nthemselves ill-used, unless one tells them everything, straitened though\nI am for space, I will glance at this transaction.\n\nAfter the desperate charge of young Doones had been met by us, and\nbroken, and just as Poor Kit Badcock died in the arms of the dead\nCharley, I happened to descry a patch of white on the grass of the\nmeadow, like the head of a sheep after washing-day. Observing with\nsome curiosity how carefully this white thing moved along the bars of\ndarkness betwixt the panels of firelight, I ran up to intercept it,\nbefore it reached the little postern which we used to call Gwenny's\ndoor. Perceiving me, the white thing stopped, and was for making back\nagain; but I ran up at full speed; and lo, it was the flowing silvery\nhair of that sage the Counsellor, who was scuttling away upon all fours;\nbut now rose and confronted me.\n\n\"John,\" he said, \"Sir John, you will not play falsely with your ancient\nfriend, among these violent fellows, I look to you to protect me, John.\"\n\n\"Honoured sir, you are right,\" I replied; \"but surely that posture was\nunworthy of yourself, and your many resources. It is my intention to let\nyou go free.\"\n\n\"I knew it. I could have sworn to it. You are a noble fellow, John. I\nsaid so, from the very first; you are a noble fellow, and an ornament to\nany rank.\"\n\n\"But upon two conditions,\" I added, gently taking him by the arm; for\ninstead of displaying any desire to commune with my nobility, he was\nedging away toward the postern; \"the first is that you tell me truly\n(for now it can matter to none of you) who it was that slew my father.\"\n\n\"I will tell you truly and frankly, John; however painful to me to\nconfess it. It was my son, Carver.\"\n\n\"I thought as much, or I felt as much all along,\" I answered; \"but the\nfault was none of yours, sir; for you were not even present.\"\n\n\"If I had been there, it would not have happened. I am always opposed\nto violence. Therefore, let me haste away; this scene is against my\nnature.\"\n\n\"You shall go directly, Sir Counsellor, after meeting my other\ncondition; which is, that you place in my hands Lady Lorna's diamond\nnecklace.\"\n\n\"Ah, how often I have wished,\" said the old man with a heavy sigh, \"that\nit might yet be in my power to ease my mind in that respect, and to do a\nthoroughly good deed by lawful restitution.\"\n\n\"Then try to have it in your power, sir. Surely, with my encouragement,\nyou might summon resolution.\"\n\n\"Alas, John, the resolution has been ready long ago. But the thing is\nnot in my possession. Carver, my son, who slew your father, upon him you\nwill find the necklace. What are jewels to me, young man, at my time of\nlife? Baubles and trash,--I detest them, from the sins they have led me\nto answer for. When you come to my age, good Sir John, you will scorn\nall jewels, and care only for a pure and bright conscience. Ah! ah! Let\nme go. I have made my peace with God.\"\n\nHe looked so hoary, and so silvery, and serene in the moonlight, that\nverily I must have believed him, if he had not drawn in his breast. But\nI happened to have noticed that when an honest man gives vent to noble\nand great sentiments, he spreads his breast, and throws it out, as if\nhis heart were swelling; whereas I had seen this old gentleman draw in\nhis breast more than once, as if it happened to contain better goods\nthan sentiment.\n\n\"Will you applaud me, kind sir,\" I said, keeping him very tight, all the\nwhile, \"if I place it in your power to ratify your peace with God? The\npledge is upon your heart, no doubt, for there it lies at this moment.\"\n\nWith these words, and some apology for having recourse to strong\nmeasures, I thrust my hand inside his waistcoat, and drew forth Lorna's\nnecklace, purely sparkling in the moonlight, like the dancing of new\nstars. The old man made a stab at me, with a knife which I had not\nespied; but the vicious onset failed; and then he knelt, and clasped his\nhands.\n\n\"Oh, for God's sake, John, my son, rob me not in that manner. They\nbelong to me; and I love them so; I would give almost my life for them.\nThere is one jewel I can look at for hours, and see all the lights of\nheaven in it; which I never shall see elsewhere. All my wretched, wicked\nlife--oh, John, I am a sad hypocrite--but give me back my jewels. Or\nelse kill me here; I am a babe in your hands; but I must have back my\njewels.\"\n\nAs his beautiful white hair fell away from his noble forehead, like a\nsilver wreath of glory, and his powerful face, for once, was moved with\nreal emotion, I was so amazed and overcome by the grand contradictions\nof nature, that verily I was on the point of giving him back the\nnecklace. But honesty, which is said to be the first instinct of all the\nRidds (though I myself never found it so), happened here to occur to me,\nand so I said, without more haste than might be expected,--\n\n\"Sir Counsellor, I cannot give you what does not belong to me. But if\nyou will show me that particular diamond which is heaven to you, I will\ntake upon myself the risk and the folly of cutting it out for you. And\nwith that you must go contented; and I beseech you not to starve with\nthat jewel upon your lips.\"\n\nSeeing no hope of better terms, he showed me his pet love of a jewel;\nand I thought of what Lorna was to me, as I cut it out (with the hinge\nof my knife severing the snakes of gold) and placed it in his careful\nhand. Another moment, and he was gone, and away through Gwenny's\npostern; and God knows what became of him.\n\nNow as to Carver, the thing was this--so far as I could ascertain from\nthe valiant miners, no two of whom told the same story, any more than\none of them told it twice. The band of Doones which sallied forth for\nthe robbery of the pretended convoy was met by Simon Carfax, according\nto arrangement, at the ruined house called The Warren, in that part of\nBagworthy Forest where the river Exe (as yet a very small stream) runs\nthrough it. The Warren, as all our people know, had belonged to a fine\nold gentleman, whom every one called \"The Squire,\" who had retreated\nfrom active life to pass the rest of his days in fishing, and shooting,\nand helping his neighbours. For he was a man of some substance; and no\npoor man ever left The Warren without a bag of good victuals, and a\nfew shillings put in his pocket. However, this poor Squire never made\na greater mistake, than in hoping to end his life peacefully upon the\nbanks of a trout-stream, and in the green forest of Bagworthy. For as\nhe came home from the brook at dusk, with his fly-rod over his shoulder,\nthe Doones fell upon him, and murdered him, and then sacked his house,\nand burned it.\n\nNow this had made honest people timid about going past The Warren at\nnight; for, of course, it was said that the old Squire \"walked,\" upon\ncertain nights of the moon, in and out of the trunks of trees, on the\ngreen path from the river. On his shoulder he bore a fishing-rod, and\nhis book of trout-flies, in one hand, and on his back a wicker-creel;\nand now and then he would burst out laughing to think of his coming so\nnear the Doones.\n\nAnd now that one turns to consider it, this seems a strangely righteous\nthing, that the scene of one of the greatest crimes even by Doones\ncommitted should, after twenty years, become the scene of vengeance\nfalling (like hail from heaven) upon them. For although The Warren lies\nwell away to the westward of the mine; and the gold, under escort to\nBristowe, or London, would have gone in the other direction; Captain\nCarfax, finding this place best suited for working of his design, had\npersuaded the Doones, that for reasons of Government, the ore must go\nfirst to Barnstaple for inspection, or something of that sort. And\nas every one knows that our Government sends all things westward\nwhen eastward bound, this had won the more faith for Simon, as being\naccording to nature.\n\nNow Simon, having met these flowers of the flock of villainy, where the\nrising moonlight flowed through the weir-work of the wood, begged them\nto dismount; and led them with an air of mystery into the Squire's\nruined hall, black with fire, and green with weeds.\n\n[Illustration: 677.jpg Rising moonlight]\n\n\"Captain, I have found a thing,\" he said to Carver Doone, himself,\n\"which may help to pass the hour, ere the lump of gold comes by. The\nsmugglers are a noble race; but a miner's eyes are a match for them.\nThere lies a puncheon of rare spirit, with the Dutchman's brand upon it,\nhidden behind the broken hearth. Set a man to watch outside; and let us\nsee what this be like.\"\n\nWith one accord they agreed to this, and Carver pledged Master Carfax,\nand all the Doones grew merry. But Simon being bound, as he said, to\nsee to their strict sobriety, drew a bucket of water from the well into\nwhich they had thrown the dead owner, and begged them to mingle it with\ntheir drink; which some of them did, and some refused.\n\nBut the water from that well was poured, while they were carousing, into\nthe priming-pan of every gun of theirs; even as Simon had promised to do\nwith the guns of the men they were come to kill. Then just as the giant\nCarver arose, with a glass of pure hollands in his hand, and by the\nlight of the torch they had struck, proposed the good health of the\nSquire's ghost--in the broken doorway stood a press of men, with pointed\nmuskets, covering every drunken Doone. How it fared upon that I know\nnot, having none to tell me; for each man wrought, neither thought of\ntelling, nor whether he might be alive to tell. The Doones rushed\nto their guns at once, and pointed them, and pulled at them; but the\nSquire's well had drowned their fire; and then they knew that they were\nbetrayed, but resolved to fight like men for it. Upon fighting I can\nnever dwell; it breeds such savage delight in me; of which I would\nfain have less. Enough that all the Doones fought bravely; and like men\n(though bad ones) died in the hall of the man they had murdered. And\nwith them died poor young De Whichehalse, who, in spite of his good\nfather's prayers, had cast in his lot with the robbers. Carver Doone\nalone escaped. Partly through his fearful strength, and his yet more\nfearful face; but mainly perhaps through his perfect coolness, and his\nmode of taking things.\n\nI am happy to say that no more than eight of the gallant miners were\nkilled in that combat, or died of their wounds afterwards; and adding\nto these the eight we had lost in our assault on the valley (and two of\nthem excellent warehousemen), it cost no more than sixteen lives to be\nrid of nearly forty Doones, each of whom would most likely have killed\nthree men in the course of a year or two. Therefore, as I said at the\ntime, a great work was done very reasonably; here were nigh upon forty\nDoones destroyed (in the valley, and up at The Warrens) despite their\nextraordinary strength and high skill in gunnery; whereas of us ignorant\nrustics there were only sixteen to be counted dead--though others might\nbe lamed, or so,--and of those sixteen only two had left wives, and\ntheir wives did not happen to care for them.\n\nYet, for Lorna' s sake, I was vexed at the bold escape of Carver.\nNot that I sought for Carver's life, any more than I did for the\nCounsellor's; but that for us it was no light thing, to have a man of\nsuch power, and resource, and desperation, left at large and furious,\nlike a famished wolf round the sheepfold. Yet greatly as I blamed the\nyeomen, who were posted on their horses, just out of shot from the\nDoone-gate, for the very purpose of intercepting those who escaped the\nminers, I could not get them to admit that any blame attached to them.\n\nBut lo, he had dashed through the whole of them, with his horse at\nfull gallop; and was nearly out of shot before they began to think of\nshooting him. Then it appears from what a boy said--for boys manage to\nbe everywhere--that Captain Carver rode through the Doone-gate, and so\nto the head of the valley. There, of course, he beheld all the houses,\nand his own among the number, flaming with a handsome blaze, and\nthrowing a fine light around such as he often had revelled in, when of\nother people's property. But he swore the deadliest of all oaths, and\nseeing himself to be vanquished (so far as the luck of the moment went),\nspurred his great black horse away, and passed into the darkness.\n\n[Illustration: 679.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII\n\nHOW TO GET OUT OF CHANCERY\n\n[Illustration: 680.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nThings at this time so befell me, that I cannot tell one half; but\nam like a boy who has left his lesson (to the master's very footfall)\nunready, except with false excuses. And as this makes no good work, so\nI lament upon my lingering, in the times when I might have got through\na good page, but went astray after trifles. However, every man must\ndo according to his intellect; and looking at the easy manner of\nmy constitution, I think that most men will regard me with pity and\ngoodwill for trying, more than with contempt and wrath for having tried\nunworthily. Even as in the wrestling ring, whatever man did his best,\nand made an honest conflict, I always laid him down with softness,\neasing off his dusty fall.\n\nBut the thing which next betided me was not a fall of any sort; but\nrather a most glorious rise to the summit of all fortune. For in good\ntruth it was no less than the return of Lorna--my Lorna, my own darling;\nin wonderful health and spirits, and as glad as a bird to get back\nagain. It would have done any one good for a twelve-month to behold her\nface and doings, and her beaming eyes and smile (not to mention blushes\nalso at my salutation), when this Queen of every heart ran about our\nrooms again. She did love this, and she must see that, and where was our\nold friend the cat? All the house was full of brightness, as if the sun\nhad come over the hill, and Lorna were his mirror.\n\nMy mother sat in an ancient chair, and wiped her cheeks, and looked at\nher; and even Lizzie's eyes must dance to the freshness and joy of her\nbeauty. As for me, you might call me mad; for I ran out and flung my\nbest hat on the barn, and kissed mother Fry, till she made at me with\nthe sugar-nippers.\n\nWhat a quantity of things Lorna had to tell us! And yet how often we\nstopped her mouth--at least mother, I mean, and Lizzie--and she quite as\noften would stop her own, running up in her joy to some one of us!\nAnd then there arose the eating business--which people now call\n\"refreshment,\" in these dandyfied days of our language--for how was it\npossible that our Lorna could have come all that way, and to her own\nExmoor, without being terribly hungry?\n\n\"Oh, I do love it all so much,\" said Lorna, now for the fiftieth time,\nand not meaning only the victuals: \"the scent of the gorse on the moors\ndrove me wild, and the primroses under the hedges. I am sure I was meant\nfor a farmer's--I mean for a farm-house life, dear Lizzie\"--for Lizzie\nwas looking saucily--\"just as you were meant for a soldier's bride, and\nfor writing despatches of victory. And now, since you will not ask me,\ndear mother, in the excellence of your manners, and even John has not\nthe impudence, in spite of all his coat of arms--I must tell you a\nthing, which I vowed to keep until tomorrow morning; but my resolution\nfails me. I am my own mistress--what think you of that, mother? I am my\nown mistress!\"\n\n\"Then you shall not be so long,\" cried I; for mother seemed not to\nunderstand her, and sought about for her glasses: \"darling, you shall be\nmistress of me; and I will be your master.\"\n\n\"A frank announcement of your intent, and beyond doubt a true one; but\nsurely unusual at this stage, and a little premature, John. However,\nwhat must be, must be.\" And with tears springing out of smiles, she fell\non my breast, and cried a bit.\n\nWhen I came to smoke a pipe over it (after the rest were gone to bed), I\ncould hardly believe in my good luck. For here was I, without any merit,\nexcept of bodily power, and the absence of any falsehood (which surely\nis no commendation), so placed that the noblest man in England might\nenvy me, and be vexed with me. For the noblest lady in all the land, and\nthe purest, and the sweetest--hung upon my heart, as if there was none\nto equal it.\n\nI dwelled upon this matter, long and very severely, while I smoked a\nnew tobacco, brought by my own Lorna for me, and next to herself most\ndelicious; and as the smoke curled away, I thought, \"Surely this is too\nfine to last, for a man who never deserved it.\"\n\nSeeing no way out of this, I resolved to place my faith in God; and so\nwent to bed and dreamed of it. And having no presence of mind to pray\nfor anything, under the circumstances, I thought it best to fall asleep,\nand trust myself to the future. Yet ere I fell asleep the roof above me\nswarmed with angels, having Lorna under it.\n\nIn the morning Lorna was ready to tell her story, and we to hearken; and\nshe wore a dress of most simple stuff; and yet perfectly wonderful, by\nmeans of the shape and her figure. Lizzie was wild with jealousy, as\nmight be expected (though never would Annie have been so, but have\npraised it, and craved for the pattern), and mother not understanding\nit, looked forth, to be taught about it. For it was strange to note that\nlately my dear mother had lost her quickness, and was never quite brisk,\nunless the question were about myself. She had seen a great deal of\ntrouble; and grief begins to close on people, as their power of life\ndeclines. We said that she was hard of hearing; but my opinion was,\nthat seeing me inclined for marriage made her think of my father, and\nso perhaps a little too much, to dwell on the courting of thirty years\nagone. Anyhow, she was the very best of mothers; and would smile and\ncommand herself; and be (or try to believe herself) as happy as could\nbe, in the doings of the younger folk, and her own skill in detecting\nthem. Yet, with the wisdom of age, renouncing any opinion upon the\nmatter; since none could see the end of it.\n\nBut Lorna in her bright young beauty, and her knowledge of my heart, was\nnot to be checked by any thoughts of haply coming evil. In the morning\nshe was up, even sooner than I was, and through all the corners of the\nhens, remembering every one of them. I caught her and saluted her with\nsuch warmth (being now none to look at us), that she vowed she would\nnever come out again; and yet she came the next morning.\n\nThese things ought not to be chronicled. Yet I am of such nature, that\nfinding many parts of life adverse to our wishes, I must now and then\ndraw pleasure from the blessed portions. And what portion can be more\nblessed than with youth, and health, and strength, to be loved by a\nvirtuous maid, and to love her with all one's heart? Neither was my\npride diminished, when I found what she had done, only from her love of\nme.\n\nEarl Brandir's ancient steward, in whose charge she had travelled, with\na proper escort, looked upon her as a lovely maniac; and the mixture of\npity and admiration wherewith he regarded her, was a strange thing to\nobserve; especially after he had seen our simple house and manners. On\nthe other hand, Lorna considered him a worthy but foolish old gentleman;\nto whom true happiness meant no more than money and high position.\n\nThese two last she had been ready to abandon wholly, and had in part\nescaped from them, as the enemies of her happiness. And she took\nadvantage of the times, in a truly clever manner. For that happened\nto be a time--as indeed all times hitherto (so far as my knowledge\nextends), have, somehow, or other, happened to be--when everybody\nwas only too glad to take money for doing anything. And the greatest\nmoney-taker in the kingdom (next to the King and Queen, of course, who\nhad due pre-eminence, and had taught the maids of honour) was generally\nacknowledged to be the Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys.\n\nUpon his return from the bloody assizes, with triumph and great glory,\nafter hanging every man who was too poor to help it, he pleased his\nGracious Majesty so purely with the description of their delightful\nagonies, that the King exclaimed, \"This man alone is worthy to be at the\nhead of the law.\" Accordingly in his hand was placed the Great Seal of\nEngland.\n\nSo it came to pass that Lorna's destiny hung upon Lord Jeffreys; for at\nthis time Earl Brandir died, being taken with gout in the heart, soon\nafter I left London. Lorna was very sorry for him; but as he had never\nbeen able to hear one tone of her sweet silvery voice, it is not to be\nsupposed that she wept without consolation. She grieved for him as we\nought to grieve for any good man going; and yet with a comforting sense\nof the benefit which the blessed exchange must bring to him.\n\nNow the Lady Lorna Dugal appeared to Lord Chancellor Jeffreys so\nexceeding wealthy a ward that the lock would pay for turning. Therefore\nhe came, of his own accord, to visit her, and to treat with her; having\nheard (for the man was as big a gossip as never cared for anybody,\nyet loved to know all about everybody) that this wealthy and beautiful\nmaiden would not listen to any young lord, having pledged her faith to\nthe plain John Ridd.\n\nThereupon, our Lorna managed so to hold out golden hopes to the Lord\nHigh Chancellor, that he, being not more than three parts drunk, saw his\nway to a heap of money. And there and then (for he was not the man\nto daily long about anything) upon surety of a certain round sum--the\namount of which I will not mention, because of his kindness towards\nme--he gave to his fair ward permission, under sign and seal, to marry\nthat loyal knight, John Ridd; upon condition only that the King's\nconsent should be obtained.\n\nHis Majesty, well-disposed towards me for my previous service, and\nregarding me as a good Catholic, being moved moreover by the Queen, who\ndesired to please Lorna, consented, without much hesitation, upon the\nunderstanding that Lorna, when she became of full age, and the mistress\nof her property (which was still under guardianship), should pay a\nheavy fine to the Crown, and devote a fixed portion of her estate to the\npromotion of the holy Catholic faith, in a manner to be dictated by the\nKing himself. Inasmuch, however, as King James was driven out of his\nkingdom before this arrangement could take effect, and another king\nsucceeded, who desired not the promotion of the Catholic religion,\nneither hankered after subsidies, whether French or English, that\nagreement was pronounced invalid, improper, and contemptible. However,\nthere was no getting back the money once paid to Lord Chancellor\nJeffreys.\n\nBut what thought we of money at this present moment; or of position,\nor anything else, except indeed one another? Lorna told me, with the\nsweetest smile, that if I were minded to take her at all, I must take\nher without anything; inasmuch as she meant, upon coming of age, to make\nover the residue of her estates to the next-of-kin, as being unfit for a\nfarmer's wife. And I replied with the greatest warmth and a readiness\nto worship her, that this was exactly what I longed for, but had never\ndared to propose it. But dear mother looked most exceeding grave; and\nsaid that to be sure her opinion could not be expected to count for\nmuch, but she really hoped that in three years' time we should both he a\nlittle wiser, and have more regard for our interests, and perhaps those\nof others by that time; and Master Snowe having daughters only, and\nnobody coming to marry them, if anything happened to the good old\nman--and who could tell in three years' time what might happen to all\nor any of us?--why perhaps his farm would be for sale, and perhaps Lady\nLorna's estates in Scotland would fetch enough money to buy it, and so\nthrow the two farms into one, and save all the trouble about the brook,\nas my poor father had longed to do many and many a time, but not having\na title could not do all quite as he wanted. And then if we young\npeople grew tired of the old mother, as seemed only too likely, and was\naccording to nature, why we could send her over there, and Lizzie to\nkeep her company.\n\nWhen mother had finished, and wiped her eyes, Lorna, who had been\nblushing rosily at some portions of this great speech, flung her fair\narms around mother's neck, and kissed her very heartily, and scolded\nher (as she well deserved) for her want of confidence in us. My mother\nreplied that if anybody could deserve her John, it was Lorna; but that\nshe could not hold with the rashness of giving up money so easily; while\nher next-of-kin would be John himself, and who could tell what others,\nby the time she was one-and-twenty?\n\nHereupon, I felt that after all my mother had common sense on her side;\nfor if Master Snowe's farm should be for sale, it would be far more to\nthe purpose than my coat of arms, to get it; for there was a different\npasture there, just suited for change of diet to our sheep as well\nas large cattle. And beside this, even with all Annie's skill (and of\ncourse yet more now she was gone), their butter would always command in\nthe market from one to three farthings a pound more than we could get\nfor ours. And few things vexed us more than this. Whereas, if we got\npossession of the farm, we might, without breach of the market-laws, or\nany harm done to any one (the price being but a prejudice), sell all our\nbutter as Snowe butter, and do good to all our customers.\n\nThinking thus, yet remembering that Farmer Nicholas might hold out for\nanother score of years--as I heartily hoped he might--or that one, if\nnot all, of his comely daughters might marry a good young farmer (or\nfarmers, if the case were so)--or that, even without that, the farm\nmight never be put up for sale; I begged my Lorna to do as she liked; or\nrather to wait and think of it; for as yet she could do nothing.\n\n[Illustration: 685.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV\n\nBLOOD UPON THE ALTAR\n\n[Illustration: 686.jpg Entrance to Oare Church]\n\nEverything was settled smoothly, and without any fear or fuss, that\nLorna might find end of troubles, and myself of eager waiting, with\nthe help of Parson Bowden, and the good wishes of two counties. I could\nscarce believe my fortune, when I looked upon her beauty, gentleness,\nand sweetness, mingled with enough of humour and warm woman's feeling,\nnever to be dull or tiring; never themselves to be weary.\n\nFor she might be called a woman now; although a very young one, and as\nfull of playful ways, or perhaps I may say ten times as full, as if she\nhad known no trouble. To wit, the spirit of bright childhood, having\nbeen so curbed and straitened, ere its time was over, now broke forth,\nenriched and varied with the garb of conscious maidenhood. And the sense\nof steadfast love, and eager love enfolding her, coloured with so many\ntinges all her looks, and words, and thoughts, that to me it was the\nnoblest vision even to think about her.\n\nBut this was far too bright to last, without bitter break, and the\nplunging of happiness in horror, and of passionate joy in agony. My\ndarling in her softest moments, when she was alone with me, when the\nspark of defiant eyes was veiled beneath dark lashes, and the challenge\nof gay beauty passed into sweetest invitation; at such times of her\npurest love and warmest faith in me, a deep abiding fear would flutter\nin her bounding heart, as of deadly fate's approach. She would cling to\nme, and nestle to me, being scared of coyishness, and lay one arm around\nmy neck, and ask if I could do without her.\n\nHence, as all emotions haply, of those who are more to us than\nourselves, find within us stronger echo, and more perfect answer, so\nI could not be regardless of some hidden evil; and my dark misgivings\ndeepened as the time drew nearer. I kept a steadfast watch on Lorna,\nneglecting a field of beans entirely, as well as a litter of young pigs,\nand a cow somewhat given to jaundice. And I let Jem Slocombe go to sleep\nin the tallat, all one afternoon, and Bill Dadds draw off a bucket of\ncider, without so much as a \"by your leave.\" For these men knew that my\nknighthood, and my coat of arms, and (most of all) my love, were greatly\nagainst good farming; the sense of our country being--and perhaps it may\nbe sensible--that a man who sticks up to be anything, must allow himself\nto be cheated.\n\nBut I never did stick up, nor would, though all the parish bade me; and\nI whistled the same tunes to my horses, and held my plough-tree, just\nthe same as if no King, nor Queen, had ever come to spoil my tune or\nhand. For this thing, nearly all the men around our parts upbraided me;\nbut the women praised me: and for the most part these are right, when\nthemselves are not concerned.\n\nHowever humble I might be, no one knowing anything of our part of the\ncountry, would for a moment doubt that now here was a great to do and\ntalk of John Ridd and his wedding. The fierce fight with the Doones so\nlately, and my leading of the combat (though I fought not more than need\nbe), and the vanishing of Sir Counsellor, and the galloping madness of\nCarver, and the religious fear of the women that this last was gone to\nhell--for he himself had declared that his aim, while he cut through\nthe yeomanry--also their remorse, that he should have been made to go\nthither with all his children left behind--these things, I say (if\never I can again contrive to say anything), had led to the broadest\nexcitement about my wedding of Lorna. We heard that people meant to come\nfrom more than thirty miles around, upon excuse of seeing my stature and\nLorna's beauty; but in good truth out of sheer curiosity, and the love\nof meddling.\n\nOur clerk had given notice, that not a man should come inside the door\nof his church without shilling-fee; and women (as sure to see twice as\nmuch) must every one pay two shillings. I thought this wrong; and as\nchurch-warden, begged that the money might be paid into mine own hands,\nwhen taken. But the clerk said that was against all law; and he had\norders from the parson to pay it to him without any delay. So as I\nalways obey the parson, when I care not much about a thing, I let them\nhave it their own way; though feeling inclined to believe, sometimes,\nthat I ought to have some of the money.\n\nDear mother arranged all the ins and outs of the way in which it was\nto be done; and Annie and Lizzie, and all the Snowes, and even Ruth\nHuckaback (who was there, after great persuasion), made such a sweeping\nof dresses that I scarcely knew where to place my feet, and longed for a\nstaff, to put by their gowns. Then Lorna came out of a pew half-way, in\na manner which quite astonished me, and took my left hand in her right,\nand I prayed God that it were done with.\n\nMy darling looked so glorious, that I was afraid of glancing at her, yet\ntook in all her beauty. She was in a fright, no doubt; but nobody should\nsee it; whereas I said (to myself at least), \"I will go through it like\na grave-digger.\"\n\nLorna's dress was of pure white, clouded with faint lavender (for the\nsake of the old Earl Brandir), and as simple as need be, except for\nperfect loveliness. I was afraid to look at her, as I said before,\nexcept when each of us said, \"I will,\" and then each dwelled upon the\nother.\n\nIt is impossible for any who have not loved as I have to conceive my joy\nand pride, when after ring and all was done, and the parson had blessed\nus, Lorna turned to look at me with her glances of subtle fun subdued by\nthis great act.\n\nHer eyes, which none on earth may ever equal, or compare with, told me\nsuch a depth of comfort, yet awaiting further commune, that I was almost\namazed, thoroughly as I knew them. Darling eyes, the sweetest eyes, the\nloveliest, the most loving eyes--the sound of a shot rang through the\nchurch, and those eyes were filled with death.\n\nLorna fell across my knees when I was going to kiss her, as the\nbridegroom is allowed to do, and encouraged, if he needs it; a flood of\nblood came out upon the yellow wood of the altar steps, and at my feet\nlay Lorna, trying to tell me some last message out of her faithful eyes.\nI lifted her up, and petted her, and coaxed her, but it was no good; the\nonly sign of life remaining was a spirt of bright red blood.\n\nSome men know what things befall them in the supreme time of their\nlife--far above the time of death--but to me comes back as a hazy dream,\nwithout any knowledge in it, what I did, or felt, or thought, with my\nwife's arms flagging, flagging, around my neck, as I raised her up, and\nsoftly put them there. She sighed a long sigh on my breast, for her last\nfarewell to life, and then she grew so cold, and cold, that I asked the\ntime of year.\n\nIt was Whit-Tuesday, and the lilacs all in blossom; and why I thought\nof the time of year, with the young death in my arms, God or His angels,\nmay decide, having so strangely given us. Enough that so I did, and\nlooked; and our white lilacs were beautiful. Then I laid my wife in my\nmother's arms, and begging that no one would make a noise, went forth\nfor my revenge.\n\nOf course, I knew who had done it. There was but one man in the\nworld, or at any rate, in our part of it, who could have done such a\nthing--such a thing. I use no harsher word about it, while I leaped upon\nour best horse, with bridle but no saddle, and set the head of Kickums\ntowards the course now pointed out to me. Who showed me the course, I\ncannot tell. I only know that I took it. And the men fell back before\nme.\n\nWeapon of no sort had I. Unarmed, and wondering at my strange attire\n(with a bridal vest, wrought by our Annie, and red with the blood of the\nbride), I went forth just to find out this; whether in this world there\nbe or be not God of justice.\n\nWith my vicious horse at a furious speed, I came upon Black Barrow Down,\ndirected by some shout of men, which seemed to me but a whisper. And\nthere, about a furlong before me, rode a man on a great black horse, and\nI knew that the man was Carver Doone.\n\n\"Your life or mine,\" I said to myself; \"as the will of God may be. But\nwe two live not upon this earth, one more hour together.\"\n\nI knew the strength of this great man; and I knew that he was armed with\na gun--if he had time to load again, after shooting my Lorna--or at any\nrate with pistols, and a horseman's sword as well. Nevertheless, I had\nno more doubt of killing the man before me than a cook has of spitting a\nheadless fowl.\n\nSometimes seeing no ground beneath me, and sometimes heeding every leaf,\nand the crossing of the grass-blades, I followed over the long moor,\nreckless whether seen or not. But only once the other man turned round\nand looked back again, and then I was beside a rock, with a reedy swamp\nbehind me.\n\nAlthough he was so far before me, and riding as hard as ride he might, I\nsaw that he had something on the horse in front of him; something which\nneeded care, and stopped him from looking backward. In the whirling of\nmy wits, I fancied first that this was Lorna; until the scene I had been\nthrough fell across hot brain and heart, like the drop at the close of\na tragedy. Rushing there through crag and quag, at utmost speed of a\nmaddened horse, I saw, as of another's fate, calmly (as on canvas laid),\nthe brutal deed, the piteous anguish, and the cold despair.\n\nThe man turned up the gully leading from the moor to Cloven Rocks,\nthrough which John Fry had tracked Uncle Ben, as of old related. But as\nCarver entered it, he turned round, and beheld me not a hundred yards\nbehind; and I saw that he was bearing his child, little Ensie, before\nhim. Ensie also descried me, and stretched his hands and cried to me;\nfor the face of his father frightened him.\n\nCarver Doone, with a vile oath, thrust spurs into his flagging horse,\nand laid one hand on a pistol-stock; whence I knew that his slung\ncarbine had received no bullet since the one that had pierced Lorna. And\na cry of triumph rose from the black depths of my heart. What cared I\nfor pistols? I had no spurs, neither was my horse one to need the rowel;\nI rather held him in than urged him, for he was fresh as ever; and I\nknew that the black steed in front, if he breasted the steep ascent,\nwhere the track divided, must be in our reach at once.\n\nHis rider knew this; and, having no room in the rocky channel to turn\nand fire, drew rein at the crossways sharply, and plunged into the black\nravine leading to the Wizard's Slough. \"Is it so?\" I said to myself\nwith a brain and head cold as iron; \"though the foul fiend come from the\nslough, to save thee; thou shalt carve it, Carver.\"\n\nI followed my enemy carefully, steadily, even leisurely; for I had him,\nas in a pitfall, whence no escape might be. He thought that I feared to\napproach him, for he knew not where he was: and his low disdainful laugh\ncame back. \"Laugh he who wins,\" thought I.\n\nA gnarled and half-starved oak, as stubborn as my own resolve, and\nsmitten by some storm of old, hung from the crag above me. Rising from\nmy horse's back, although I had no stirrups, I caught a limb, and tore\nit (like a mere wheat-awn) from the socket. Men show the rent even now,\nwith wonder; none with more wonder than myself.\n\nCarver Doone turned the corner suddenly on the black and bottomless bog;\nwith a start of fear he reined back his horse, and I thought he would\nhave turned upon me. But instead of that, he again rode on; hoping to\nfind a way round the side.\n\nNow there is a way between cliff and slough for those who know the\nground thoroughly, or have time enough to search it; but for him there\nwas no road, and he lost some time in seeking it. Upon this he made up\nhis mind; and wheeling, fired, and then rode at me.\n\nHis bullet struck me somewhere, but I took no heed of that. Fearing only\nhis escape, I laid my horse across the way, and with the limb of the\noak struck full on the forehead his charging steed. Ere the slash of the\nsword came nigh me, man and horse rolled over, and wellnigh bore my own\nhorse down, with the power of their onset.\n\nCarver Doone was somewhat stunned, and could not arise for a moment.\nMeanwhile I leaped on the ground and awaited, smoothing my hair back,\nand baring my arms, as though in the ring for wrestling. Then the little\nboy ran to me, clasped my leg, and looked up at me, and the terror in\nhis eyes made me almost fear myself.\n\n\"Ensie, dear,\" I said quite gently, grieving that he should see his\nwicked father killed, \"run up yonder round the corner and try to find\na pretty bunch of bluebells for the lady.\" The child obeyed me,\nhanging back, and looking back, and then laughing, while I prepared for\nbusiness. There and then I might have killed mine enemy, with a single\nblow, while he lay unconscious; but it would have been foul play.\n\nWith a sullen and black scowl, the Carver gathered his mighty limbs, and\narose, and looked round for his weapons; but I had put them well away.\nThen he came to me and gazed; being wont to frighten thus young men.\n\n\"I would not harm you, lad,\" he said, with a lofty style of sneering: \"I\nhave punished you enough, for most of your impertinence. For the rest I\nforgive you; because you have been good and gracious to my little son.\nGo, and be contented.\"\n\nFor answer, I smote him on the cheek, lightly, and not to hurt him: but\nto make his blood leap up. I would not sully my tongue by speaking to a\nman like this.\n\nThere was a level space of sward between us and the slough. With the\ncourtesy derived from London, and the processions I had seen, to this\nplace I led him. And that he might breathe himself, and have every fibre\ncool, and every muscle ready, my hold upon his coat I loosed, and left\nhim to begin with me, whenever he thought proper.\n\nI think that he felt that his time was come. I think he knew from my\nknitted muscles, and the firm arch of my breast, and the way in which\nI stood; but most of all from my stern blue eyes; that he had found his\nmaster. At any rate a paleness came, an ashy paleness on his cheeks, and\nthe vast calves of his legs bowed in, as if he were out of training.\n\nSeeing this, villain as he was, I offered him first chance. I stretched\nforth my left hand, as I do to a weaker antagonist, and I let him have\nthe hug of me. But in this I was too generous; having forgotten my\npistol-wound, and the cracking of one of my short lower ribs. Carver\nDoone caught me round the waist, with such a grip as never yet had been\nlaid upon me.\n\nI heard my rib go; I grasped his arm, and tore the muscle out of it* (as\nthe string comes out of an orange); then I took him by the throat, which\nis not allowed in wrestling; but he had snatched at mine; and now was no\ntime of dalliance. In vain he tugged, and strained, and writhed, dashed\nhis bleeding fist into my face, and flung himself on me with gnashing\njaws. Beneath the iron of my strength--for God that day was with me--I\nhad him helpless in two minutes, and his fiery eyes lolled out.\n\n     * A far more terrible clutch than this is handed down, to\n     weaker ages, of the great John Ridd.--Ed.\n\n\"I will not harm thee any more,\" I cried, so far as I could for panting,\nthe work being very furious: \"Carver Doone, thou art beaten: own it, and\nthank God for it; and go thy way, and repent thyself.\"\n\nIt was all too late. Even if he had yielded in his ravening frenzy--for\nhis beard was like a mad dog's jowl--even if he would have owned that,\nfor the first time in his life, he had found his master; it was all too\nlate.\n\nThe black bog had him by the feet; the sucking of the ground drew on\nhim, like the thirsty lips of death. In our fury, we had heeded neither\nwet nor dry; nor thought of earth beneath us. I myself might scarcely\nleap, with the last spring of o'er-laboured legs, from the engulfing\ngrave of slime. He fell back, with his swarthy breast (from which my\ngripe had rent all clothing), like a hummock of bog-oak, standing out\nthe quagmire; and then he tossed his arms to heaven, and they were black\nto the elbow, and the glare of his eyes was ghastly. I could only gaze\nand pant; for my strength was no more than an infant's, from the fury\nand the horror. Scarcely could I turn away, while, joint by joint, he\nsank from sight.\n\n[Illustration: 693.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV\n\nGIVE AWAY THE GRANDEUR\n\n[Illustration: 694.jpg Illustrated Capital]\n\nWhen the little boy came back with the bluebells, which he had managed\nto find--as children always do find flowers, when older eyes see\nnone--the only sign of his father left was a dark brown bubble, upon a\nnewly formed patch of blackness. But to the center of its pulpy gorge\nthe greedy slough was heaving, and sullenly grinding its weltering jaws\namong the flags and the sedges.\n\nWith pain, and ache, both of mind and body, and shame at my own fury, I\nheavily mounted my horse again, and, looked down at the innocent Ensie.\nWould this playful, loving child grow up like his cruel father, and end\na godless life of hatred with a death of violence? He lifted his noble\nforehead towards me, as if to answer, \"Nay, I will not\": but the words\nhe spoke were these:--\n\n\"Don,\"--for he could never say \"John\"--\"oh, Don, I am so glad that nasty\nnaughty man is gone away. Take me home, Don. Take me home.\"\n\nIt has been said of the wicked, \"not even their own children love them.\"\nAnd I could easily believe that Carver Doone's cold-hearted ways had\nscared from him even his favorite child. No man would I call truly\nwicked, unless his heart be cold.\n\nIt hurt me, more than I can tell, even through all other grief, to take\ninto my arms the child of the man just slain by me. The feeling was a\nfoolish one, and a wrong one, as the thing has been--for I would fain\nhave saved that man, after he was conquered--nevertheless my arms went\ncoldly round that little fellow; neither would they have gone at all,\nif there had been any help for it. But I could not leave him there, till\nsome one else might fetch him; on account of the cruel slough, and the\nravens which had come hovering over the dead horse; neither could I,\nwith my wound, tie him on my horse and walk.\n\nFor now I had spent a great deal of blood, and was rather faint and\nweary. And it was lucky for me that Kickums had lost spirit, like his\nmaster, and went home as mildly as a lamb. For, when we came towards the\nfarm, I seemed to be riding in a dream almost; and the voices both of\nman and women (who had hurried forth upon my track), as they met me,\nseemed to wander from a distant muffling cloud. Only the thought of\nLorna's death, like a heavy knell, was tolling in the belfry of my\nbrain.\n\nWhen we came to the stable door, I rather fell from my horse than got\noff; and John Fry, with a look of wonder took Kickum's head, and led\nhim in. Into the old farmhouse I tottered, like a weanling child, with\nmother in her common clothes, helping me along, yet fearing, except by\nstealth, to look at me.\n\n\"I have killed him,\" was all I said; \"even as he killed Lorna. Now let\nme see my wife, mother. She belongs to me none the less, though dead.\"\n\n\"You cannot see her now, dear John,\" said Ruth Huckaback, coming\nforward; since no one else had the courage. \"Annie is with her now,\nJohn.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it? Let me see my dead one; and pray myself to\ndie.\"\n\nAll the women fell away, and whispered, and looked at me, with side\nglances, and some sobbing; for my face was hard as flint. Ruth alone\nstood by me, and dropped her eyes, and trembled. Then one little hand\nof hers stole into my great shaking palm, and the other was laid on\nmy tattered coat: yet with her clothes she shunned my blood, while she\nwhispered gently,--\n\n\"John, she is not your dead one. She may even be your living one yet,\nyour wife, your home, and your happiness. But you must not see her now.\"\n\n\"Is there any chance for her? For me, I mean; for me, I mean?\"\n\n\"God in heaven knows, dear John. But the sight of you, and in this sad\nplight, would be certain death to her. Now come first, and be healed\nyourself.\"\n\nI obeyed her, like a child, whispering only as I went, for none but\nmyself knew her goodness--\"Almighty God will bless you, darling, for the\ngood you are doing now.\"\n\nTenfold, ay and a thousandfold, I prayed and I believed it, when I came\nto know the truth. If it had not been for this little maid, Lorna must\nhave died at once, as in my arms she lay for dead, from the dastard and\nmurderous cruelty. But the moment I left her Ruth came forward and took\nthe command of every one, in right of her firmness and readiness.\n\nShe made them bear her home at once upon the door of the pulpit, with\nthe cushion under the drooping head. With her own little hands she cut\noff, as tenderly as a pear is peeled, the bridal-dress, so steeped and\nstained, and then with her dainty transparent fingers (no larger than a\npencil) she probed the vile wound in the side, and fetched the reeking\nbullet forth; and then with the coldest water stanched the flowing of\nthe life-blood. All this while my darling lay insensible, and white as\ndeath; and needed nothing but her maiden shroud.\n\nBut Ruth still sponged the poor side and forehead, and watched the long\neyelashes flat upon the marble cheek; and laid her pure face on the\nfaint heart, and bade them fetch her Spanish wine. Then she parted the\npearly teeth (feebly clenched on the hovering breath), and poured in\nwine from a christening spoon, and raised the graceful neck and breast,\nand stroked the delicate throat, and waited; and then poured in a little\nmore.\n\nAnnie all the while looked on with horror and amazement, counting\nherself no second-rate nurse, and this as against all theory. But the\nquiet lifting of Ruth's hand, and one glance from her dark bright eyes,\ntold Annie just to stand away, and not intercept the air so. And at the\nvery moment when all the rest had settled that Ruth was a simple idiot,\nbut could not harm the dead much, a little flutter in the throat,\nfollowed by a short low sigh, made them pause, and look and hope.\n\nFor hours, however, and days, she lay at the very verge of death,\nkept alive by nothing but the care, the skill, the tenderness, and the\nperpetual watchfulness of Ruth. Luckily Annie was not there very often,\nso as to meddle; for kind and clever nurse as she was, she must have\ndone more harm than good. But my broken rib, which was set by a doctor,\nwho chanced to be at the wedding, was allotted to Annie's care; and\ngreat inflammation ensuing, it was quite enough to content her. This\ndoctor had pronounced poor Lorna dead; wherefore Ruth refused most\nfirmly to have aught to do with him. She took the whole case on herself;\nand with God's help she bore it through.\n\nNow whether it were the light and brightness of my Lorna's nature; or\nthe freedom from anxiety--for she knew not of my hurt;--or, as some\npeople said, her birthright among wounds and violence, or her manner of\nnot drinking beer--I leave that doctor to determine who pronounced her\ndead. But anyhow, one thing is certain; sure as stars of hope above us;\nLorna recovered, long ere I did.\n\nFor the grief was on me still of having lost my love and lover at the\nmoment she was mine. With the power of fate upon me, and the black\ncauldron of the wizard's death boiling in my heated brain, I had\nno faith in the tales they told. I believed that Lorna was in the\nchurchyard, while these rogues were lying to me. For with strength of\nblood like mine, and power of heart behind it, a broken bone must burn\nitself.\n\nMine went hard with fires of pain, being of such size and thickness; and\nI was ashamed of him for breaking by reason of a pistol-ball, and the\nmere hug of a man. And it fetched me down in conceit of strength; so\nthat I was careful afterwards.\n\nAll this was a lesson to me. All this made me very humble; illness being\na thing, as yet, altogether unknown to me. Not that I cried small, or\nskulked, or feared the death which some foretold; shaking their heads\nabout mortification, and a green appearance. Only that I seemed quite\nfit to go to heaven, and Lorna. For in my sick distracted mind (stirred\nwith many tossings), like the bead in the spread of frog-spawn carried\nby the current, hung the black and central essence of my future life. A\nlife without Lorna; a tadpole life. All stupid head; and no body.\n\nMany men may like such life; anchorites, fakirs, high-priests, and so\non; but to my mind, it is not the native thing God meant for us. My\ndearest mother was a show, with crying and with fretting. The Doones,\nas she thought, were born to destroy us. Scarce had she come to some\nliveliness (though sprinkled with tears, every now and then) after her\ngreat bereavement, and ten years' time to dwell on it--when lo, here was\nher husband's son, the pet child of her own good John, murdered like his\nfather! Well, the ways of God were wonderful!\n\nSo they were, and so they are; and so they ever will be. Let us debate\nthem as we will, our ways are His, and much the same; only second-hand\nfrom Him. And I expected something from Him, even in my worst of times,\nknowing that I had done my best.\n\nThis is not edifying talk--as our Nonconformist parson says, when he can\nget no more to drink--therefore let me only tell what became of Lorna.\nOne day, I was sitting in my bedroom, for I could not get downstairs,\nand there was no one strong enough to carry me, even if I would have\nallowed it.\n\nThough it cost me sore trouble and weariness, I had put on all my Sunday\nclothes, out of respect for the doctor, who was coming to bleed me again\n(as he always did twice a week); and it struck me that he had seemed\nhurt in his mind, because I wore my worst clothes to be bled in--for lie\nin bed I would not, after six o'clock; and even that was great laziness.\n\nI looked at my right hand, whose grasp had been like that of a\nblacksmith's vice; and it seemed to myself impossible that this could\nbe John Ridd's. The great frame of the hand was there, as well as the\nmuscles, standing forth like the guttering of a candle, and the broad\nblue veins, going up the back, and crossing every finger. But as\nfor colour, even Lorna's could scarcely have been whiter; and as for\nstrength, little Ensie Doone might have come and held it fast. I laughed\nas I tried in vain to lift the basin set for bleeding me.\n\nThen I thought of all the lovely things going on out-of-doors just now,\nconcerning which the drowsy song of the bees came to me. These must\nbe among the thyme, by the sound of their great content. Therefore the\nroses must be in blossom, and the woodbine, and clove-gilly-flower; the\ncherries on the wall must be turning red, the yellow Sally must be on\nthe brook, wheat must be callow with quavering bloom, and the early\nmeadows swathed with hay.\n\nYet here was I, a helpless creature quite unfit to stir among them,\ngifted with no sight, no scent of all the changes that move our love,\nand lead our hearts, from month to month, along the quiet path of life.\nAnd what was worse, I had no hope of caring ever for them more.\n\nPresently a little knock sounded through my gloomy room, and supposing\nit to be the doctor, I tried to rise and make my bow. But to my surprise\nit was little Ruth, who had never once come to visit me, since I\nwas placed under the doctor's hands. Ruth was dressed so gaily, with\nrosettes, and flowers, and what not, that I was sorry for her bad\nmanners; and thought she was come to conquer me, now that Lorna was done\nwith.\n\nRuth ran towards me with sparkling eyes, being rather short of sight;\nthen suddenly she stopped, and I saw entire amazement in her face.\n\n\"Can you receive visitors, Cousin Ridd?--why, they never told me of\nthis!\" she cried: \"I knew that you were weak, dear John; but not that\nyou were dying. Whatever is that basin for?\"\n\n\"I have no intention of dying, Ruth; and I like not to talk about it.\nBut that basin, if you must know, is for the doctor's purpose.\"\n\n\"What, do you mean bleeding you? You poor weak cousin! Is it possible\nthat he does that still?\"\n\n\"Twice a week for the last six weeks, dear. Nothing else has kept me\nalive.\"\n\n\"Nothing else has killed you, nearly. There!\" and she set her little\nboot across the basin, and crushed it. \"Not another drop shall they have\nfrom you. Is Annie such a fool as that? And Lizzie, like a zany, at her\nbooks! And killing her brother, between them!\"\n\nI was surprised to see Ruth excited; her character being so calm and\nquiet. And I tried to soothe her with my feeble hand, as now she knelt\nbefore me.\n\n\"Dear cousin, the doctor must know best. Annie says so, every day. What\nhas he been brought up for?\"\n\n\"Brought up for slaying and murdering. Twenty doctors killed King\nCharles, in spite of all the women. Will you leave it to me, John? I\nhave a little will of my own; and I am not afraid of doctors. Will you\nleave it to me, dear John? I have saved your Lorna's life. And now I\nwill save yours; which is a far, far easier business.\"\n\n\"You have saved my Lorna's life! What do you mean by talking so?\"\n\n\"Only what I say, Cousin John. Though perhaps I overprize my work. But\nat any rate she says so.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" I said, falling back with bewilderment; \"all\nwomen are such liars.\"\n\n\"Have you ever known me tell a lie?\" Ruth in great indignation--more\nfeigned, I doubt, than real--\"your mother may tell a story, now and then\nwhen she feels it right; and so may both your sisters. But so you cannot\ndo, John Ridd; and no more than you can I do it.\"\n\nIf ever there was virtuous truth in the eyes of any woman, it was now\nin Ruth Huckaback's: and my brain began very slowly to move, the heart\nbeing almost torpid from perpetual loss of blood.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" was all I could say for a very long time.\n\n\"Will you understand, if I show you Lorna? I have feared to do it, for\nthe sake of you both. But now Lorna is well enough, if you think that\nyou are, Cousin John. Surely you will understand, when you see your\nwife.\"\n\nFollowing her, to the very utmost of my mind and heart, I felt that all\nshe said was truth; and yet I could not make it out. And in her last\nfew words there was such a power of sadness rising through the cover\nof gaiety, that I said to myself, half in a dream, \"Ruth is very\nbeautiful.\"\n\nBefore I had time to listen much for the approach of footsteps, Ruth\ncame back, and behind her Lorna; coy as if of her bridegroom; and\nhanging back with her beauty. Ruth banged the door, and ran away; and\nLorna stood before me.\n\nBut she did not stand for an instant, when she saw what I was like. At\nthe risk of all thick bandages, and upsetting a dozen medicine bottles,\nand scattering leeches right and left, she managed to get into my arms,\nalthough they could not hold her. She laid her panting warm young breast\non the place where they meant to bleed me, and she set my pale face up;\nand she would not look at me, having greater faith in kissing.\n\nI felt my life come back, and warm; I felt my trust in women flow; I\nfelt the joys of living now, and the power of doing it. It is not a\nmoment to describe; who feels can never tell of it. But the rush of\nLorna's tears, and the challenge of my bride's lips, and the throbbing\nof my wife's heart (now at last at home on mine), made me feel that the\nworld was good, and not a thing to be weary of.\n\nLittle more have I to tell. The doctor was turned out at once; and\nslowly came back my former strength, with a darling wife, and good\nvictuals. As for Lorna, she never tired of sitting and watching me eat\nand eat. And such is her heart that she never tires of being with me\nhere and there, among the beautiful places, and talking with her arm\naround me--so far at least as it can go, though half of mine may go\nround her--of the many fears and troubles, dangers and discouragements,\nand worst of all the bitter partings, which we used to have, somehow.\n\nThere is no need for my farming harder than becomes a man of weight.\nLorna has great stores of money, though we never draw it out, except for\nsome poor neighbor; unless I find her a sumptuous dress, out of her own\nperquisites. And this she always looks upon as a wondrous gift from me;\nand kisses me much when she puts it on, and walks like the noble woman\nshe is. And yet I may never behold it again; for she gets back to her\nsimple clothes, and I love her the better in them. I believe that she\ngives half the grandeur away, and keeps the other half for the children.\n\nAs for poor Tom Faggus, every one knows his bitter adventures, when his\npardon was recalled, because of his journey to Sedgemoor. Not a child\nin the country, I doubt, but knows far more than I do of Tom's most\ndesperate doings. The law had ruined him once, he said; and then he had\nbeen too much for the law: and now that a quiet life was his object,\nhere the base thing came after him. And such was his dread of this\nevil spirit, that being caught upon Barnstaple Bridge, with soldiers\nat either end of it (yet doubtful about approaching him), he set his\nstrawberry mare, sweet Winnie, at the left-hand parapet, with a whisper\ninto her dove-coloured ear. Without a moment's doubt she leaped it, into\nthe foaming tide, and swam, and landed according to orders. Also his\nflight from a public-house (where a trap was set for him, but Winnie\ncame and broke down the door, and put two men under, and trod on them,)\nis as well known as any ballad. It was reported for awhile that poor Tom\nhad been caught at last, by means of his fondness for liquor, and was\nhanged before Taunton Jail; but luckily we knew better. With a good\nwife, and a wonderful horse, and all the country attached to him, he\nkept the law at a wholesome distance, until it became too much for its\nmaster; and a new king arose. Upon this, Tom sued his pardon afresh; and\nJeremy Stickles, who suited the times, was glad to help him in getting\nit, as well as a compensation. Thereafter the good and respectable\nTom lived a godly (though not always sober) life; and brought up his\nchildren to honesty, as the first of all qualifications.\n\nMy dear mother was as happy as possibly need be with us; having no\ncause for jealousy, as others arose around her. And everybody was well\npleased, when Lizzy came in one day and tossed her bookshelf over, and\ndeclared that she would have Captain Bloxham, and nobody should prevent\nher. For that he alone, of all the men she had ever met with, knew good\nwriting when he saw it, and could spell a word when told. As he had now\nsucceeded to Captain Stickle's position (Stickles going up the tree),\nand had the power of collecting, and of keeping, what he liked, there\nwas nothing to be said against it; and we hoped that he would pay her\nout.\n\nI sent little Ensie to Blundell's school, at my own cost and charges,\nhaving changed his name, for fear of what anyone might do to him. I\ncalled him Ensie Jones; and we got him a commission, and after many\nscrapes of spirit, he did great things in the Low Countries. He looks\nupon me as his father; and without my leave will not lay claim to the\nheritage and title of the Doones, which clearly belong to him.\n\nRuth Huckaback is not married yet; although upon Uncle Reuben's death\nshe came into all his property; except, indeed, 2000 pounds, which Uncle\nBen, in his driest manner, bequeathed \"to Sir John Ridd, the worshipful\nknight, for greasing of the testator's boots.\" And he left almost a\nmint of money, not from the mine, but from the shop, and the good use of\nusury. For the mine had brought in just what it cost, when the vein of\ngold ended suddenly; leaving all concerned much older, and some, I fear,\nmuch poorer; but no one utterly ruined, as is the case with most of\nthem. Ruth herself was his true mine, as upon death-bed he found. I know\na man even worthy of her: and though she is not very young, he loves\nher, as I love Lorna. It is my firm conviction, that in the end he\nwill win her; and I do not mean to dance again, except at dear Ruth's\nwedding; if the floor be strong enough.\n\nOf Lorna, of my lifelong darling, of my more and more loved wife, I will\nnot talk; for it is not seemly that a man should exalt his pride. Year\nby year her beauty grows, with the growth of goodness, kindness, and\ntrue happiness--above all with loving. For change, she makes a joke of\nthis, and plays with it, and laughs at it; and then, when my slow nature\nmarvels, back she comes to the earnest thing. And if I wish to pay her\nout for something very dreadful--as may happen once or twice, when we\nbecome too gladsome--I bring her to forgotten sadness, and to me for\ncure of it, by the two words \"Lorna Doone.\"\n\n[Illustration: 703.jpg Tailpiece]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lorna Doone, by R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":28,"split":"train"}
