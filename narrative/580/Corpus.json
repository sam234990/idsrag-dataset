Beenay takes his findings to his superior at the university, Aton, who formulated the Theory of Universal Gravitation (the in-story discussion of this makes light of an article once written about Einstein's theory of relativity, referencing the false notion that \"only twelve men\" could understand it). This prompts the astronomers at Saro University to seek the cause of this anomaly. Eventually, they discover that the only possible cause of the deviation is an astronomical body that orbits Lagash.\nBeenay, through his friend Theremon\u00a0762, a reporter, has learned some of the beliefs of the group known as the Cult (\"Apostles of Flame\" in the novel). They believe the world would be destroyed in a darkness with the appearance of stars that unleash a torrent of fire. Beenay combines what he has learned about the repetitive collapses at the archaeological site, and the new theory of potential eclipses; he concludes that once every 2049 years, the one sun otherwise visible is eclipsed, resulting in a brief \"night\". His theory is that this \"night\" was so horrifying to the people who experienced it, they desperately sought out any light source to try to drive it away: particularly, by frantically starting fires which burned down and destroyed their successive civilizations. He also postulates that the \"Apostles of the Flame\" started out as vague surviving legends and myths after the last eclipse: small children too young to understand what was happening did not go insane but grew up half-feral in the ruins, and as they grew older, the only clues they had were the insane ramblings of adults who had lived through the eclipse. Over the centuries, these vague stories became legend, and then a cult of religious devotion.\nSince the current population of Lagash has never experienced general darkness, the scientists conclude that the darkness would traumatize the people and that they would need to prepare for it. When nightfall occurs, the scientists (who have prepared themselves for darkness) and the rest of the planet are most surprised by the sight of hitherto invisible stars outside the six-star system filling the sky. Never having seen other stars in the sky, the inhabitants of Lagash had come to believe that their six-star system contained the entirety of the universe. In one horrifying instant, anyone gazing at the night sky \u2013 the first night sky which they have ever known \u2013 is suddenly faced with the reality that the universe contains many millions upon billions of stars: the awesome realization of just how vast the universe truly is drives them insane. This night sky is very different from that of Earth's, because Lagash and its stars reside in a globular cluster, where hundreds of thousands of stars are visible in the now-darkened sky.\nThe short story concludes with the arrival of the night and a crimson glow that was \"not the glow of a sun\", with the implication that societal collapse has occurred once again. In the novel and X\u00a0Minus One program, civil disorder breaks out; cities are destroyed in massive fires and civilization collapses, with the ashes of the fallen civilization and the competing groups trying to seize control.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Nightfall, by Anthony Pryde\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Wanhope was a large, old-fashioned\nmanor-house, a plain brick front unbroken except in the middle, where\nits corniced roof was carried down by steps to an immense gateway of\nweathered stone, carved with the escutcheon of the family and their\nMotto: FORTIS ET FIDELIS. Wistarias rambled over both sides,\nwreathing the stone window-frames in their grape-like clusters of\nlilac bloom, and flagstones running from end to end, shallow, and so\nworn that a delicate growth of stonecrop fringed them, shelved down\nto a lawn.\n\nIndoors in the great hall it was dark because floor and staircase\nand wall and ceiling were all lined with Spanish chestnut-wood,\nwhile the windows were full of Flemish glass in purple and sepia\nand blue.  There was nothing to reflect a glint of light except a\ncollection of weapons of all ages which occupied the wall behind\na bare stone hearth; suits of inlaid armour, coats of chainmail\nas flexible as silk, assegais and blowpipes, Bornean parangs and\nGurkha kukris, Abyssinian shotels with their double blades,\nMexican knives in chert and chalcedony, damascened swords and\nautomatic pistols, a Chinese bronze drum, a Persian mace of the\ndate of Rustum, and an Austrian cavalry helmet marked with a\nbullet-hole and a stain.\n\nGradually, as her eyes grew used to the gloom Laura found her way\nto her husband's couch.  She would have liked to kiss him, but\ndared not: the narrow mocking smile, habitual on his lips, showed\nno disposition to respond to advances.  Dressed in an ordinary\nsuit of Irish tweed, Bernard Clowes lay at full length in an easy\nattitude, his hands in his pockets and his legs decently extended\nas Barry, his male nurse, had left them twenty minutes ago: a\nbig, powerful man, well over six feet in height, permanently\nbronze and darkly handsome, his immense shoulders still held back\nso flat that his coat fitted without a wrinkle--but a cripple\nsince the war.\n\nLaura Clowes too was tall and slightly sunburnt,  but thin for\nher height, and rather plain except for her sweet eyes, her silky\nbrown hair, and--rarer gift!--the vague elegance which was a\nprerogative of Selincourt women.  She rarely wore expensive\nclothes, her maid Catherine made most of her indoor dresses,\nand yet she could still hold her own, as in old days, among\nwomen who shopped in the Rue de la Paix.  This afternoon, in her\nsilk muslin of the same shade as the trail of wistaria tucked\nin where the frills crossed over her breast, she might have gone\nastray out of the seventeenth century.\n\n\"Tea is in the parlour,\" said Mrs. Clowes. \"Shall I wheel you\nround through the garden?  It's a lovely day and the roses are\nin their perfection, I counted eighty blooms on the old Frau\nKarl.  I should like you to see her.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't.  But you can drag me into the parlour if you like,\"\nsaid Bernard Clowes--a grudging concession: more often than not\nhe ate his food in the hall.  His wife pushed his couch, which\nran on cycle wheels and so lightly that a child could propel it,\ninto her sitting-room and as near as she dared to the French\nwindows that opened without step or ledge on the terrace\nflagstones and the verdure of the lawn.  Out of doors, for some\nobscure reason, he refused to go, though the garden was sweet\nwith the scent of clover and the gold sunlight was screened by\nthe milky branches of a great acacia.  Still he was in the fresh\nair, and Laura hastily busied herself with her flowered Dresden\nteacups, pretending unconsciousness because if she had shown the\nslightest satisfaction he would probably have demanded to be\ntaken back. Her mild duplicity was of course mere make believe:\nthe two understood each other only too well: but it was wiser to\nkeep a veil drawn in case Bernard Clowes should suddenly return\nto his senses.  For this reason Laura always spoke as if his\nchoice of a coffined life were only a day or two old.  Had he\nsaid--as he might say at any moment--\"Laura, I should like to\ngo for a drive,\" Laura would have been able without inconsistency\nto reply, \"Yes, dear: what time shall I order the car?\" as though\nthey had been driving together every evening of their married\nlife.\n\n\"What have you been doing today?\" Clowes  asked, sipping his tea\nand looking out of the window.  He had shut himself up in his\nbedroom with a headache and his wife had not seen him since the\nnight before.\n\n\"This morning I motored into Amesbury to change the library\nbooks and to enquire after Canon Bodington. I saw Mrs. Bodington\nand Phoebe and George--,\"\n\n\"Who's George?\"\n\n\"Their son in the Navy, don't you remember?  The Sapphire is in\ndry dock--\"\n\n\"How old is he?\"\n\n\"Nineteen,\" said Mrs. Clowes.\n\n\"Oh.  Go on.\"\n\n\"I don't remember doing anything else except get some stamps at\nthe post office.  Stay, now I come to think of it, I met Mr.\nMaturin, but I didn't  speak to him.  He only took off his hat to\nme, Bernard. He is seventy-four.\"\n\n\"Dull sort of morning you seem to have had,\" said Bernard Clowes.\n\n\"What did you do after lunch?\"\n\n\"With a great want of intelligence, I strolled down to Wharton to\nsee Yvonne, but she was out. They had all gone over to the big\ngarden party at Temple Brading.  I forgot about it--\"\n\n\"Why weren't you asked?\"\n\n\"I was asked but I didn't care to go.  Now that I am no longer in\nmy first youth these expensive crushes cease to amuse me.\"\nBernard gave an incredulous sniff but said nothing.  \"On my way\nhome I looked in at the vicarage to settle the day for the school\ntreat.  Isabel has made Jack Bendish promise to help with the\ncricket, and she seems to be under the impression that Yvonne\nwill join in the games.  I can hardly believe that anything will\ninduce Yvonne to play Nuts and May, but if it is to be done that\nenergetic child will do it.  No, I didn't see Val or Mr.\nStafford.  Val was over at Red Springs and Mr. Stafford was\npreparing his sermon.\"\n\n\"Have you written any letters?\"\n\n\"I wrote to father and sent him fifty pounds.  It was out of my\nown allowance. He seems even harder up than usual.  I'm afraid\nthe latest system is not profitable.\"\n\n\"I should not think it would be, for Mr. Selincourt,\" replied\nBernard Clowes politely. \"Monte Carlo never does pay unless one's\npretty sharp, and your father hasn't the brains of a flea.  Was\nthat the only letter you wrote?\"\n\n\"Yes--will you have some more bread and butter?\"\n\n\"And what letters did you get?\"  Clowes pursued his leisured\ncatechism while he helped himself daintily to a fragile sandwich.\nThis was all part of the daily routine, and Laura, if she felt\nany resentment, had long since grown out of showing it.\n\n\"One from Lucian.  He's in Paris--\"\n\n\"With--?\"\n\n\"No one, so far as I know,\" Laura replied, not affecting to\nmisunderstand his jibe.  Lucian Selincourt was her only brother\nand very dear to her, but there was no denying that his career\nhad its seamy side.  He was not, like her father, a family\nskeleton--he had never been warned off the Turf: but he was\nrarely solitary and never out of debt. \"Poor Lucian, he's hard\nup too. I wish I could send him fifty pounds, but if I did he'd\nsend it back.\"\n\n\"What other letters did you have?\"\n\nMrs. Clowes had had a sheaf of unimportant notes, which she was\nmade to describe in detail, her husband listening in his hard\npatience.  When they were exhausted Laura went on in a hesitating\nvoice, \"And there was one more that I want to consult you about.\nI know you'll say we can't have him, but I hardly liked to refuse\non my own imitative, as he's your cousin, not mine.  It was from\nLawrence Hyde, offering to come here for a day or two.\"\n\n\"Lawrence Hyde?  Why, I haven't seen or heard of him for years,\"\nClowes raised his head with a gleam of interest.  \"I remember him\nwell enough though.  Good-looking chap, six foot two or three and\nas strong as a horse.  Well-built chap, too.  Women ran after\nhim.  I haven't seen him since we were in the trenches together.\"\n\n\"Yes, Bernard.  Don't you recollect his going to see you in\nhospital?\"\n\n\"So he did, by Jove!  I'd forgotten that.  He'd ten days' leave\nand he chucked one of them away to look me up.  Not such a bad\nsort, old Lawrence.\"\n\n\"I liked him very much,\" said Laura quietly.\n\n\"Wants to come to us, does he?  Why?  Where does he write from?\"\n\n\"Paris.  It seems he ran across Lucian at Auteuil--\"\n\n\"Let me see the letter.\"\n\nLaura give it over.  \"Calls you Laura, does he?\" Clowes read it\naloud with a running commentary of his own.  \"H'm: pleasant\nrelationship, cousins-in-law. . . 'Met Lucian . . . chat about\nold times'--is he a bird of Lucian's feather, I wonder?  He\nwasn't keen on women in the old days, but people change a lot\nin ten years . . . 'Like to come and see us while he's in\nEngland . . . run over for the day'--bosh, he knows we should\nhave to put him up for a couple of nights! . . . 'Sorry to hear\nsuch a bad account of Bernard'--Very kind of him, does he want\na cheque?  Hallo!  'Lucian says he is leading you a deuce of a\nlife.' Upon my word!\"  He lowered the letter and burst out\nlaughing--the first hearty laugh she had heard from him for many\na long day.  Laura, who had given him the letter in fear and\ntrembling and only because she could not help herself, was\nexceedingly relieved and joined in merrily.  But while she was\nlaughing she had to wink a sudden moisture from her eyelashes:\nthis glimpse of the natural self of the man she had married went\nto her heart.  \"Is it true?\" he said, still with that friendly\ntwinkle in his eyes.  \"Do I lead you the deuce of a life, poor\nold Laura?\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" said Laura, smiling back at him.  She could have\nbeen more eloquent, but she dared not.  Bernard's moods required\ndelicate handling.\n\n\"He's a cool hand anyhow to write like that to a woman about her\nhusband.  But Lawrence always was a cool hand. I remember the\nturn-up we had in the Farringay woods when I was twelve and he\nwas fourteen.  He nearly murdered me. But I paid him out,\" said\nBernard in a glow of pleasurable reminiscence.  \"He was too\nheavy for me. Old Andrew Hyde came and dragged him off.  But\nI marked him: he was banished from his mother's drawingroom for\na week--not that he minded that much . . . Aunt Helen was a\npretty woman.  Gertrude and I never could think why she married\nUncle Andrew, but I believe they got on all right, though she was\na big handsome woman--a Clowes all over--while old Andrew\nlooked like any little scrub out of Houndsditch.  Never can tell\nwhy people marry each other, can you?\" Bernard was becoming\nphilosophical.  I suppose if you go to the bottom it's Nature\nthat takes them by the scruff of the neck and gives them a gentle\nshove and says 'More babies, please.' She doesn't always bring it\noff though, witness you and me, my love.--  But I say, Laura, I\nlike the way you handed over that letter!  Thought it would do me\ngood, didn't you?  Look here, I can't have my character taken\naway behind my back!  You tell him to come and judge for\nhimself.\"\n\n\"You'll get very tired of him, Berns,\" said Laura doubtfully.\n\"You always say you get sick of people in twenty-four hours: and\nI can't take him entirely off your hands--you'll have to do your\nshare of entertaining him.  He's your cousin, not mine, and it'll\nbe you he comes to see.\"\n\n\"I shan't see any more of him than I want to, my dear, on that\nyou may depend,\" said Bernard with easy emphasis.  \"If he\ninvites himself he'll have to put with what he can get.  But\nI can stand a good deal of him.  Regimental shop is always\namusing, and Lawrence will know heaps of fellows I used to know,\nand tell me what's become of them all.  Besides, I'm sick to\ndeath of the local gang and Lawrence will be a change.  He's got\nmore brains than Jack Bendish, and from the style of his letter\nhe can't be so much like a curate as Val is.\"  Val Stafford was\nagent for the Wanhope property.  \"Oh,  by George!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\nBernard threw back his head and grinned broadly with half shut\neyes.  \"Ha, ha! by Gad, that's funny--that's very funny.  Why,\nVal knows him!\"\n\n\"Knows Lawrence?  I never heard Val mention his name.\"\n\n\"No, my love, but one can't get Val to open his lips on that\nsubject. Lawrence and I were in the same battalion.  He was there\nwhen Val got his ribbon.\"\n\n\"Really?  That will be nice for Val, meeting him again.\"\n\n\"Oh rather!\" said Bernard Clowes. \"On my word it's a shame and\nI've half a mind . . .. No, let him come: let him come and be\ndamned to the pair of them!  Straighten me out, will you?\" He was\nliable like most paralytics to mechanical jerks and convulsions\nwhich drove him mad with impatience.  Laura drew down the\nhelplessly twitching knee, and ran one firm hand over him from\nthigh to ankle.  Her touch had a mesmeric effect on his nerves\nwhen he could endure it, but nine times out of ten he struck it\naway. He did so now. \"Go to the devil!  How often have I told\nyou not to paw me about?  I wish you'd do as you're told.  What\ndo you call him Lawrence for?\"\n\n\"I always did.  But I'll call him Captain Hyde if you like--\"\n\n\"'Mr.,' you mean: he's probably dropped the 'Captain.' He was\nonly a 'temporary.'\"\n\n\"For all that, he has stuck to his prefix,\" said Laura smiling.\n\"Lucian chaffed him about it. But Lawrence was always rather a\nbaby in some ways: clocked socks to match his ties, and\nastonishing adventures in jewellery, and so on.  Oh yes, I knew\nhim very well indeed when I was a girl.  Mr. and Mrs. Hyde were\namong the last of the old set who kept up with us after father\nwas turned out of his clubs.  I've stayed at Farringay.\"\n\n\"You never told me that!\"\n\n\"I never thought of telling you. Lawrence hasn't been near us\nsince we came to Wanhope and I don't recollect your ever\nmentioning his name.  You see I tell you now.\"\n\n\"How old were you when you stayed at Farringay?\"\n\n\"Twenty-two.  Lawrence and I are the same age.\"\n\n\"And you knew him well, did you?\"\n\n\"We were great friends,\" said Mrs. Clowes, tossing a lump of\nsugar out of the window to a lame jackdaw. She had many such\npensioners, alike in a community of misfortune.  \"And, yes,\nBerns, you're right, we flirted a little--only a little: wasn't\nit natural?  It was only for fun, because we were both young and\nit was such heavenly weather--it was the Easter before war broke\nout.  No, he didn't ask me to marry him!  Nothing was farther\nfrom his mind.\"\n\n\"Did he kiss you?\"\n\nLaura slowly and smilingly shook her head. \"Am I, Yvonne?\"\n\n\"But you liked the fellow?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he was charming.  A little too much one of a class,\nperhaps: there's a strong family likeness, isn't there, between\nCambridge undergraduates?  But he was more cultivated than a good\nmany of his class.  We used to go up the river together and read\n--what did one read in the spring of 1914?  Masefield, I suppose,\nor was it Maeterlinck?  Rupert Brooks came with the war.  Imagine\nreading 'Pelleas et Melisande' in a Canadian canoe!  It makes one\nwant to be twenty-two again, so young and so delightfully\nserious.\"  It was hard to run on while the glow faded out of\nBernard's face and a cold gloom again came over it, but sad\nexperience had taught Laura that at all costs, under whatever\ntemptation, it was wiser to be frank.  It would have been easier\nfor the moment to paint the boy and girl friendship in neutral\ntints, but if its details came out later, trivial and innocent\nas they were, the economy of today would cost her dear tomorrow,\nHer own impression was that Clowes had never been jealous of her\nin his life.  But the pretence of jealousy was one of his few\ndiversions.\n\n\"I dare say you do wish you were twenty-two again,\" he said,\ndelicately setting down his tea cup on the tray--all his\nmovements, so far as he could control them, were delicate and\nfastidious. \"I dare say you would like a chance to play your\ncards differently.  Can't be done, my, girl, but what a good\nfellow I am to ask Lawrence to Wanhope, ain't I? No one can say\nI'm not an obliging husband.  Lawrence isn't a jumping doll. He's\nsix and thirty and as strong as a horse.  You'll have no end of a\ngood time knitting up your severed friendship .. 'Pon my word,\nI've a good mind to put him off. . I shouldn't care to fall foul\nof the King's Proctor.\"\n\n\"Will you have another cup of tea before I ring\"\n\n\"No, thanks . . . Do I lead you the deuce of a life, Lally?\"\n\n\"You do now and then,\" said his wife, smiling with pale lips.\n\n\"It isn't that I'm sensitive for myself, because I know you don't\nmean a word of it, but I rather hate it for your own sake.  It\nisn't worthy of you, old boy.  It's so--so ungentlemanly.\"\n\n\"So it is.  But I do it because I'm bored.  I am bored, you know.\nDesperately!\" He stretched out his hand to her with such haggard,\nhunted eyes that Laura, reckless, threw herself down by him and\nkissed the heavy eyelids.  Clowes put his arm round her neck,\nfondling her hair, and for a little while peace, the peace of\nperfect mutual tenderness, fell on this hard-driven pair.  But\nsoon, a great sigh bursting from his breast, Clowes pushed her\naway, his features settling back into their old harsh lines of\nsavage pain and scorn.\n\n\"Get away! get up! do you want Parker to see you through the\nwindow?  If there's a thing on earth I hate it's a dishevelled\ncrying woman.  Write to Lawrence.  Say I shall be delighted to\nsee him and that I hope he'll give us at least a week. Stop.\nWarn him that I shan't be able to see much of him because of\nmy invalid habits, and that I shall depute you to entertain\nhim.  That ought to fetch him if he remembers you when you were\ntwenty-two.\"\n\nLaura was neither dishevelled nor in tears: perhaps such scenes\nwere no novelty to her.  She leant against the frame of the open\nwindow, looking out over the sunlit garden full of flowers, over\nthe wide expanse of turf that sloped down to a wide, shallow\nriver all sparkling in western light, and over airy fields on\nthe other side of it to the roofs of the distant village strung\nout under a break of woody hill.\n\n\"Are you sure you want him?  He used to have a hot temper when he\nwas a young man, and you know, Berns, it would be tiresome if\nthere were any open scandal.\"\n\n\"Scandal be hanged,\"  said Bernard Clowes. \"You do as you're\ntold.\"  His wife gave an almost imperceptible shrug of the\nshoulders as if to disclaim further responsibility.  She was\nbreathing rather hurriedly as if she had been running, and her\nneck was so white that the shadow of her sunlit wistaria threw a\nfaint lilac stain on the warm, fine grain of her skin.  And the\nhaggard look returned to Bernard's eyes as he watched her, and\nwith it a wistfulness, a weariness of desire, \"hungry, and\nbarren, and sharp as the sea.\"  Laura never saw that hunger in\nhis eyes.  If he spared her nothing else he spared her that.\n\n\"You do as I tell you, old girl,\" his harsh voice had softened\nagain. \"There won't be any row.  Honestly I'd like to have old\nLawrence here for a bit, I'm not rotting now.  He had almost four\nyears of it--almost as long as I had.  I'll guarantee it put a\nmark on him.  It scarred us all. It'll amuse me to dine him and\nVal together, and make them talk shop, our own old shop, and see\nwhat the war's done for each of us: three retired veterans,\nthat's what we shall be, putting our legs under the same\nmahogany: three old comrades in arms.\" He gave his strange,\njarring laugh. \"Wonder which of us is scarred deepest?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWANHOPE and Castle Wharton--or, to give them their due order,\nWharton and Wanhope, for Major Clowes' place would have gone\ninside the Castle three times over--were the only country\nhouses in the Reverend James Stafford's parish.  The village\nof Chilmark--a stone bridge, crossroads, a church with Norman\ntower and frondlike Renaissance tracery, and an irregular line\nof school, shops, and cottages strung out between the stream and\nchalky beech-crested hillside occupied one of those long, winding,\nsheltered crannies that mark the beds of watercourses along the\nfolds of Salisbury Plain.  Uplands rose steeply all along it\nexcept on the south, where it widened away into the flats of\nDorsetshire.  Wharton overlooked this expanse of hunting country:\na formidable Norman keep, round which, by gradual accretion, a\ndwelling-place had grown up, a history of English architecture\nand English gardening written in stone and brick and grass and\nflowers.  One sunny square there was, enclosed between arched\nhedges set upon pillars of carpenters' work, which still kept the\ndesign of old Verulam: and Yvonne of the Castle loved its little\nturrets and cages of singing birds, and its alleys paved with\nburnet, wild thyme, and watermints, which perfume the air most\ndelightfully, not passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon\nand crushed.\n\nWanhope also, though modest by comparison, had a good deal of\nland attached to it, but the Clowes property lay north up the\nPlain, where they sowed the headlands with red wheat still as\nin the days of Justice Shallow.  The shining Mere, a tributary\nof the Avon, came dancing down out of these hills: strange\npastoral cliffs of chalk covered with fine sward, and worked by\nthe hands of prehistoric man into bastions and ramparts that\nimitated in verdure the bold sweep of masonry.\n\nMr. Stafford was a man of sixty, white-haired and of sensitive,\nintelligent features.  He was a High Churchman, but wore a felt\nwideawake in winter because when he bought it wideawakes were\nthe fashion for High Churchmen.  In the summer he usually roved\nabout his parish without any hat at all, his white curls flying\nin the wind.  He was of gentle birth, which tended to ease his\nintercourse with the Castle.  He had a hundred a year of his own,\nand the living of Chilmark was worth 175 pounds net.  So it may\nhave been partly from necessity that he went about in clothes at\nwhich any respectable tramp would have turned his nose up: but\nidiosyncrasy alone can have inspired him to get the village tailor\nto line his short blue pilot jacket with pink flannelette.  \"It's\nvery warm and comfortable, my dear,\" he said apologetically to his\nwife, who sat and gazed at him aghast, \"so much more cosy than\nItalian cloth.\"\n\nOn that occasion Mrs. Stafford was too late to interfere, but as\na rule she exercised a restraining influence, and while she lived\nthe vicar was not allowed to go about with holes in his trousers.\nAfter her death Mr. Stafford mourned her sincerely and cherished\nher memory, but all the same he was glad to be able to wear his\nold boots.  However, he had a cold bath every morning and kept\nhis hands irreproachable, not from vanity but from an inbred\ninstinct of personal care.  Yvonne of the Castle, who spoke her\nmind as Yvonne's of the Castle commonly do, said that the fewer\nclothes Mr. Stafford wore the better she liked him, because he\nwas always clean and they were not.\n\nMr. Stafford had three children; Val, late of the Dorchester\nRegiment, Rowsley an Artillery lieutenant two years younger,\nand Isabel the curate, a tall slip of a girl of nineteen.  They\nwere all beloved, but Val was the prop of the family and the\npride of his father's heart.  Invalided out of the Army after\nsix weeks' fighting, with an honourable distinction and an\nirremediably shattered arm, he had been given the agency of the\nWanhope property, and lived at home, where the greater part of\nhis three hundred a year went to pay the family bills.  Most of\nthese were for what Mr. Stafford gave away, for the vicar had no\nidea of the value of money, and was equally generous with Val's\nincome and his own.\n\nAltogether Mr. Stafford was a contented and happy man, and his\nonly worry was the thought, which crossed his mind now and then,\nthat Chilmark for a young man of Val's age was dull, and that the\nWanhope agency led nowhere.  If Val had been an ambitious man!\nBut Val was not ambitious, and Mr Stafford thanked heaven that\nthis pattern son of his had never been infected by the vulgar\nmodern craze for money making. His salary would not have kept him\nin luxury in a cottage of his own, but it was enough to make the\nvicarage a comfortable home for him; and, so long as he remained\nunmarried, what could he want more, after all, than the society\nof his own family and his kind country neighbours?\n\nRowsley, cheerfully making both ends meet in the Artillery on an\nallowance from his godmother, was off his father's hands.\nIsabel?  Mr. Stafford did not trouble much about Isabel, who was\nonly a little girl.  She was a happy, healthy young thing, and\nMr. Stafford was giving her a thoroughly good education.  She\nwould be able to earn her own living when he died, if she were\nnot married, as every woman ought to be.  (There was no one for\nIsabel to marry, but Mr. Stafford's principles rose superior to\nfacts.)  Meantime it was not as if she were running wild: that\nsweet woman Laura Clowes and the charming minx at the Castle\nbetween them could safely be left to form her manners and see\nafter her clothes.\n\nOne summer afternoon Isabel was coming back from an afternoon's\ntennis at Wharton.  Mrs. Clowes brought her in the Wanhope car as\nfar as the Wanhope footpath, and would have sent her home, but\nIsabel declined, ostensibly because she wanted to stretch her\nlegs, actually because she couldn't afford to tip the Wanhope\nchauffeur.  So she tumbled out of the car and walked away at a\ngreat rate, waving Laura farewell with her tennis racquet.\nIsabel was a tall girl of nineteen, but she still plaited her\nhair in a pigtail which swung, thick and dark and glossy, well\nbelow her waist.  She wore a holland blouse and skirt, a sailor\nhat trimmed with a band of Rowsley's ribbon, brown cotton\nstockings, and brown sandshoes bought for 5\/11-3\/4 of Chapman,\nthe leading draper in Chilmark High Street.  Isabel made her own\nclothes and made them badly.  Her skirt was short in front and\nnarrow below the waist, and her sailor blouse was comfortably but\ninelegantly loose round the armholes.  Laura Clowes, who had a\nFrench instinct of dress, and would have clad Isabel as Guinevere\nclad Enid, if Isabel had not been prouder than Enid, looked after\nher with a smile and a sigh: it was a grief to her to see her\nyoung friend so shabby, but, bless the child! how little she\ncared--and how little it signified after all!  Isabel's poverty\nsat as light on her spirits as the sailor hat, never straight,\nsat on her upflung head.\n\nIsabel knew every one in Chilmark parish.  Pausing before a knot\nof boys playing marbles: \"Herbert,\" she said sternly, \"why\nweren't you at school on Sunday?\" Old Hewett, propped like a\nwheezy mummy against the oak tree that shaded the Prince of\nWales's Feathers, brought up his stiff arm slowly in a salute to\nthe vicar's daughter. \"'Evening,\" said Isabel cheerfully, \"what a\nnight for rheumatics isn't it?\"  Hewitt chuckled mightily at this\nsubtle joke. \"'Evening, Isabel,\" called out Dr. Verney, putting\nup one finger to his cap: he considered one finger enough for a\nyoung lady whom he had brought into the world.  Isabel knew every\none in Chilmark and every one knew her.  Such a range of\nintensive acquaintance is not so narrow as people who have never\nlived in a country village are apt to suppose.\n\nPast the schoolhouse, past the wide stone bridge where Isabel\nloved to hang over the parapet watching for trout--but not\ntonight, for it was late, and Isabel after a \"company tea\" wanted\nher supper: by a footpath through the churchyard, closely mown\nand planted with rosebushes: and so into the church, where, after\ndropping a hurried professional curtsey to the altar, she set\nabout her evening duties. Isabel called herself the curate, but\nshe did a good deal which is not expected of a curate, such as\nshutting windows and changing lesson-markers, propping up the\ntrebles when they went astray in the pointing of the Psalms,\naltering the numbers on the hymn-board, writing out choir papers,\nputting flowers in the vases and candles in the benediction\nlights, playing the organ as required and occasionally blowing\nit. . . . Before leaving the church she fell on her knees, in\ndeference to Mr. Stafford and the text by the door, and said a\nprayer.  What did she pray?  \"O Lord bless this church and all\nwho worship in it and make father preach a good sermon next\nSunday. I wish I'd been playing with Val instead of Jack, we\nshould have won that last set if Jack hadn't muffed his\nservices. . . .  Well, this curate was only nineteen.\"\n\nAnd then, coming out into the fading light, she locked the north\ndoor behind her and went off whistling like a blackbird, if a\nblackbird could whistle the alto of Calkin's Magnificat in B\nflat. . . . Five minutes climbing of the steep brown floor of\nthe beechwood, and she was out on uplands in the dying fires of\nday.  It had been twilight in the valley, but here the wide plain\nwas sunlit and the air was fresh and dry: in the valley even the\nriver-aspens were almost quiet, but here there was still a sough\nof wind coming and going, through the dry grass thick set with\nlemon thyme and lady's slipper, or along the low garden wall\nwhere red valerian sprouted out of yellow stonecrop.\n\nA wishing gate led into the garden, and Isabel made for an open\nwindow, but halfway over the sill she paused, gazing with all her\nsoul in her eyes across the vicarage gooseberry bushes.  That\ngrey suit was Val's of course, but who was inside the belted coat\nand riding breeches?  \"Rows-lee!\" sang out Isabel, tumbling back\ninto the garden with a generous display of leg.  The raiders rose\nup each holding a handful of large red strawberries melting ripe,\nand Isabel, pitching in her racquet on a sofa, ran across the\ngrass and enfolded her brother in her arms.  Rowsley, dark and\nslight and shrewd, returned her hug with one arm, while carefully\nguarding his strawberries with the other--\"You pig, you perfect\npig!\" wailed Isabel.  \"I was saving them for tea tomorrow,\nLaura's coming and I can't afford a cake.  Oh joy, you can buy me\none!  How long can you stay?\"\n\n\"Over the week end: but I didn't come to buy you cakes, Baby. I\nhaven't any money either. I came because I wanted you to buy me\ncakes.\"\n\n\"O well never mind, I'll make one,\" Isabel joyously slipped her\nhand through Rowsley's arm. \"Then I can get the flour from the\nbaker and it won't cost anything at all--it'll go down in the\nbill. Well give me one anyhow, now they're picked it would be a\npity to waste them.\" She helped herself liberally out of Val's\nhand.  \"Now stop both of you, you can't have any more.\"\n\nShe linked her other arm in Val's and dragged her brothers out of\nthe dangerous proximity of the strawberry beds.  Val sat down on\na deck chair, one leg thrown over the other, Rowsley dropped at\nfull length on the turf, and Isabel doubled herself up between\nthem, her arms clasped round her knees.  \"How's the Old Man?\" she\nasked in friendly reference to Rowsley's commanding officer.\n\"Oh Rose, I knew there was something I wanted to ask you.  Will\nSpillsby be able to play on the Fourth?\"  Spillsby, a brother\nsubaltern and a famous bat, had twisted his ankle at the nets,\nand Rowsley in his last letter had been uncertain whether he\nwould be well enough to play the Sappers at the annual fixture.\n\nHappily Rowsley was able to reassure his young sister: the ankle\nwas much better and Spillsby was already allowed to walk on it.\nIsabel then turned her large velvet eyes--gazelle eyes with a\nworld of pathos in their velvet gloom on her elder brother.\n\"Coruscate, Val,\" she commanded.  \"You haven't said anything at\nall yet.  We should all try to be bright in the home circle.  We\ncannot all be witty, but-Ow!  Rowsley, if you pull my hair I\nshall hit you in the--in the place where the Gauls fined their\nsoldiers if they stuck out on parade.  Oh, Val, that really isn't\nvulgar, I found it in Matthew Arnold!  Their stomachs, you know.\nThey wouldn't have fined you anyhow.  You look fagged, darling--\nare you?\"\n\n\"Not so much fagged as hungry,\" said Val in his soft voice. \"It's\ngetting on for nine o'clock and I was done out of my tea. I went\nin to Wanhope, but Laura was out, and Clowes was drinking whisky\nand soda. I cannot stand whisky at four in the afternoon, and\nIrish whisky at that.  There'll be some supper going before long,\nwon't there?\"\n\n\"Not until half past nine because Jimmy has his Bible class\ntonight.\"  Jimmy was Mr. Stafford: and perhaps a purist might\nhave objected that Mrs. Clowes and Yvonne Bendish had not done\nall they might have done to form Isabel's manners. \"I'm so sorry,\ndarling,\" she continued, preparing to leap to her feet.  \"Shall I\nget you a biscuit?  There are oatmeals in the sideboard, the kind\nyou like, I won't be a minute--\"\n\n\"Thanks very much, I'd rather wait.  Did you see Mrs. Clowes\ntoday? Clowes said she was at the Castle.\"\n\n\"So she was, sitting with Mrs. Morley in an angelic striped\ncotton.  Mrs. Morley was in mauve ninon and a Gainsborough hat.\nYvonne says Mr. Morley is a Jew and made his money in I. D. B.'s,\nwhich I suppose are some sort of stocks?\" Neither of her brothers\noffered to enlighten her, Rowsley because he was feeling\nindolent, Val because he never said an unkind word to any one.\nIsabel, who was enamoured of her own voice flowed on with little\ndelay: \"If he really is a Jew, I can't think how she could marry\nhim; I wouldn't. Mrs. Morley can't be very happy or Laura\nwouldn't go and talk to her.  Laura is so sweet, she always sits\nwith people that other people run away from.  Oh Val, did Major\nClowes tell you their news?\" Isabel might refer to her father as\nJimmy and to Rowsley's commander as the Old Man, but she rarely\nfailed to give Bernard Clowes his correct prefix.\n\n\"No--is there any?\"\n\n\"Only that they have some one coming to stay with them.  Won't he\nhave a deadly time?\" Isabel glanced from Val to Rowsley in the\ncertainty of a common response. \"Imagine staying at Wanhope!\nHowever, he invited himself, so it's at his own risk.  Perhaps\nhe's embarrassed like you, Rose, and wants Laura to feed him.\nIt's rather fun for Laura, though--that is, it will be, if Major\nClowes isn't too hopeless.\"\n\nStrange freemasonry of the generations!  Mr. Stafford's children\nloved him dearly and he was wont to say that there were no\nsecrets at the vicarage, yet they lived in a conspiracy of\nsilence, and even Val, who was mentally nearer to his father's\nage, would have been loth to let Mr. Stafford know as much as\nIsabel knew about Wanhope.  It was assumed that Val's job was the\nvery job Val wanted.  Mr. Stafford had indeed a suspicion that it\nwas not all plain sailing:  Bernard Clowes retained just so much\nof the decently bred man as to be courteous to his wife before a\nmere acquaintance, but the vicar came and went at odd hours, and\nhe observed now and then vague intimations--undertones from\nBernard himself, an uncontrollable shrinking on Laura's part, an\noccasional hesitation or reluctance in Val--which hinted at\nflying storms.  But Val, the father supposed, could make\nallowance for a cripple: Bernard was so much to be pitied that no\nman would resent an occasional burst of temper!  And there his\nchildren left him. The younger generation can trust one another\nnot to interfere, but when the seniors strike in, with their cut\nand dry precedents and rule of thumb moralities, who knows what\nmischief may follow?  Elder people are so indiscreet!\n\n\"It's a cousin of Major Clowes,\"  Isabel continued, \"but they\nhaven't met for years and years--not since the war.  Laura knows\nhim too, she met him before she was married and liked him very\nmuch indeed.  She's looking forward to it--that is, she would be\nif she had spirit enough to look forward to anything.\"\n\n\"Clowes never said a word to me about it,\" remarked Val.\n\n\"Didn't he?\" Isabel unfolded herself and stood up. \"That means he\nis going to be tiresome.  I must run now, it's five past nine.\nWhich will you both have, cold beef or eggs?\"\n\n\"Oh, anything that's going,\" said Val.\n\n\"Eggs,\" said Rowsley, \"not less than four.  Without prejudice to\nthe cold beef if it's underdone.  Hallo!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What's the matter with your skirt?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Isabel shortly.  She screwed her head over her\nshoulder in a vain endeavour to see her own back.  \"It's\nperfectly all right.\"\n\n\"It would be, on a scarecrow.\" Isabel stuck her chin up.  \"Have\nyou been over to the Castle in that kit, Baby?  Well, if Yvonne\nwon't give you some of her old clothes, you might ask the\nkitchenmaid.\"\n\n\"The kitchenmaid has more money than I have,\" said Isabel\ncheerfully.  \"Is it so very bad?  It's clean anyway, I washed and\nironed it myself.\"\n\n\"It looks very nice and so do you,\" said Val. Isabel eyed him\nwith a softened glance: one could rely on Val to salve one's\nwounded vanity, but, alas!  Val did not know home-made from\ntailor-made. Reluctantly she owned to herself that she had more\nfaith in Rowsley's judgment.  \"It seems rather short though,\" Val\nadded. \"I suppose you will have to go into long frocks pretty\nsoon, won't you, and put your hair up?\"\n\n\"Oh bother my hair and my dresses!\" said Isabel with a great\nsigh.  \"I will pin my hair up when I get some new clothes, but\nhow can I when I haven't any money and Jim hasn't any money and\nneither of you have any money?  Don't you see, idiot,\" this was\nexclusively to Rowsley, \"when I pin my hair up I shall turn into\na grown up lady?  And then I shall have to wear proper clothes.\nAt present I'm only a little girl and it doesn't signify what I\nwear. If any one will give me five pounds I'll pin my hair up\nlike a shot.  Oh dear, I wonder what Yvonne would say if Jack\nexpected her to outfit herself for five pounds? I do wish some\none would leave me 10,000 pounds a year.  Get up now, you lazy\nbeggar, come and help me lay the supper.  It's Fanny's evening\nout.\"\n\nShe pulled Rowsley to his feet and they went off together leaving\nVal alone on the lawn: good comrades those two, and apparently\nmore of an age, in spite of the long gap between them, than\nRowsley and Val, who was the eldest by only eighteen months.  And\nVal sat on alone, while stains of coral and amber faded out of\nthe lavender sky, and a rack of sea clouds, which half an hour\nago had shone like fiery ripples, dwindled away into smoke--mist\n--a mere shadow on the breast of the night. Stars began to\nsparkle, moths and humming cockchafers sailed by him, a chase of\nbats overhead endlessly fell down airy precipices and rose in\nlong loops of darkling flight: honeysuckle and night-scented\nstock tinged with their sweet garden perfume the cool airs from\nthe moor.\n\nVal lit a cigarette, a rare indulgence.  If cigarettes grew on\ngooseberry bushes Val would have been an inveterate smoker, but\ngood Egyptians were a luxury which he could not often afford\nThe Wanhope agency was ample for his needs, though underpaid as\nagencies go: but there was Rowsley, always hard up, uncomplaining,\nbut sensitive, as a young fellow in his position is sure to be, and\nsecretly fretting because he could not do as other men did: and there\nwas Isabel, for whom Val felt the anxiety Mr. Stafford ought to have\nfelt, and was trying to make the provision Mr. Stafford ought to have\nmade: and then there was the vicar himself, who laid out a great deal\nof money in those investments for which we are promised cent per cent\ninterest, but upon a system of deferred payment.\n\nTonight however Val lit a cigarette, and then a second, to the\nsurprise of Isabel, who saw the red spark on the lawn.  She\nthought her brother must be tired, and perhaps it really was the\nlong day without food that made him so restless in mind and so\nuneasy.  Bernard Clowes had been more than usually cranky that\nafternoon.  Even the patient Val had had thoughts of throwing up\nhis job when the cripple made him go through his week's accounts,\nscrutinizing every entry and cross-examining him on every\ntransaction in such a tone as the head of a firm might employ to\na junior clerk suspected of dishonesty.  It was Bernard's way:\nit meant nothing: but it was irksome to Val, especially when he\ncould not soothe himself by dropping into Laura's quiet parlour\nfor a cup of tea.  Yet his irritation would not have lingered\nthrough a cigarette if Isabel's news had not revived it.  This\ncousin of Bernard's!  Val had not much faith in any cousin of\nBernard Clowes: nor in the kindness of life.\n\nVal was a slight, fair, pleasant-looking man of eight or nine and\ntwenty, quiet of movement, friendly-mannered and as inconspicuous\nas his own rather worn grey tweeds: one of a class, till he\nraised his eyes: and then?  There was something strange in Val's eyes\nwhen they were fully raised, an indrawn arresting brilliance\ndifficult to analyse: imaginative and sympathetic, as if he were at\nhome in dark places: the quality of acceptance of pain.\n\nAdepts in old days knew by his eyes a man who had been on the\nrack.  Stafford had been racked: and by the pain that is half\nshame, the keenest, the most lacerating and destructive of\nwounds.  He had suffered till he could suffer no more, and\ntonight in the starlit garden he, suffered still, without hope,\nor rebellion, or defence.\n\nIndoors Rowsley and Isabel, with the rapidity of long use, laid\nthe cloth, and Isabel fetched cold beef from the larder and\nbutter and eggs from the dairy, while Rowsley went down the\ncellar with a jug and a candle and drew from the cask a generous\nallowance of beer.  \"Come along in, old Val,\" said Isabel,\nreappearing at the open window, \"You and Rose are both famishing\nand I'm not,\" this was a pious fiction, \"so you can begin and\nI'll wait for Jimmy.  I dare say he's gone wandering off\nsomewhere and won't be in till ten.\"\n\nVal came across the dark, cool lawn and climbed over the window\nsill.  A shabby room, large and low: a faded paper, grey toning\nto blue: a carpet of faded roses on a grey ground: the shaded\nDresden lamp and roselit supper table shining like an island in\na pool of shadow, and those two beloved heads, both so dark and\nsmooth and young, tam cara capita!  Neither of them suspected\nthat Val was unhappy.  His feeling for them was more fatherly\nthan fraternal, and Rowsley, strange to say, fell in with Val's\nattitude, coming to his brother for money as naturally as most\nyoung men go to their parents.  Val sat at the head of the table\nbecause Mr. Stafford could not carve.  \"There!\" said Isabel,\ngiving him his plate.  \"Mustard?  I've just made it so you\nneedn't look to see if it's fresh.  Watercress: I picked it\nmyself.  Lettuce.  Cream and vinegar and sugar.  Beer.  Now do\nyou feel happy?  Lord love you, dear, I like to see you eat.\"\n\nShe sat on the arm of Mr. Stafford's mahogany chair.  \"What time\ndo you want breakfast? Seven o'clock?  Major Clowes wouldn't come\ndown at seven if he were your agent.  Can you get back to tea\ntomorrow?  Laura may bring the cousin up to tea with her and she\nwants him to meet you.\"\n\n\"Very good of her.  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, because he was in the Army too and all through the war.  He\nwent out with the first hundred thousand.  He's much older than\nyou are--the same age as Laura.  Oh, wait a minute!\" exclaimed\nIsabel in the tone in which a Frenchwoman says Tenez. I forgot.\nShe thinks you must have met him, Val.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Val.\n\n\"Was he in the Dorchesters?\" asked Rowsley--much more\ninterested than his brother,  no doubt because he was not so\nhungry as Val, who was giving all his attention to his supper.\n\n\"No, in the Winchesters,\" said Isabel.  \"Do I mean the\nWinchesters,   Val?  What was Major Clowes' old regiment?\"\n\n\"Clowes was in the Wintons.\"\n\nIsabel nodded. \"Then so was the cousin.  And Laura says he was\nout there when the Wintons were in the next bit of trench north\nof the Dorchesters.  He was there when--when you were wounded.\"\nSuch was Val Stafford's modesty that in the family circle it was\nnot in etiquette to refer in other terms to that famous occasion.\n\n\"I don't remember any fellow named Clowes and I never knew\nBernard Clowes had a cousin out there,\" said Val, mixing himself\na salad.\n\n\"Oh, his name isn't Clowes.  It's Ryde or Pride or something like\nthat.  I'm sorry to be so vague, but Jack Bendish and Yvonne and\nMrs. Morley were all talking at once.  Lawrence Pied--Fried--\"\n\n\"Lawrence Hyde?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it!  Then you really do remember him?\"\n\n\"Er--yes.   Is that lamp smoking, Rowsley?  You might turn it\ndown a trifle, I can't reach.\"\n\n\"Let me, let me?--  What was he like?\"\n\n\"Who--Hyde?  Oh,\" said Val vaguely, \"he was like the rest of us\n--very tired.\"\n\n\"Tired?\" echoed Isabel with a blank face, \"but, Val darling, he\ncouldn't have been only tired!  What should you think he was like\nwhen he wasn't tired?\"\n\n\"That is a question I have occasionally asked myself,\" Val\nanswered with his faint indecipherable smile.  \"My dear child,\nI only saw him once or twice.  He was a senior captain and\ncommanded his company. I was a very junior lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Still he was there at the time,\" reflected Isabel. \"O Rose! if\nhe's anything like nice, which is almost past praying for in\nMajor Clowes' cousin, let's beguile him into the gooseberry\nbushes and make him tell us all about it!  Val is very dear to\nhis family, but no one, however tenderly attached to him, could\ncall him a brilliant raconteur.  Now Mr. Hyde won't have any\nmodest scruples.  Val, if there is a slug in that lettuce I wish\nyou would say so. It would hurt my feelings less than for you to\nsit looking at it in a stony silence.  Was he good-looking?\"\n\n\"Possibly he might be,\" said Val, \"when he scraped the dirt off.\"\n After a moment he added, \"He was very decent to me.\"\n\n\"Was he?  Then he was nice?\"\n\n\"Gnat,\"  said Rowsley from the middle of his third egg.  Isabel\nrounded him indignantly.\n\n\"I'm not gnatting!  I'm not asking Val anything about himself, am\nI? Val can't possibly mind telling me about another man in\nanother regiment.  You eat your eggs, there's a good boy, before\nthey get cold.--  Laura says the Dorchesters dined the Winchesters\nonce when they were in billets.  Was that when you and Mr. Hyde\nwere there?\"\n\n\"Captain Hyde,\" Val corrected his young sister.  \"Yes, we both\ngraced the festive board.  It was too festive for me.  We had\nBuszard's soup and curried chicken and real cream, and more\nchampagne than was good for us.  But it was not on that occasion\nthat Hyde was so decent to me.  The day I--the day Dale went\ndown--\" Rowsley nodded to him as he raised his glass of beer to\nhis lips--\"thank you, Rose.--  As I was saying, that evening I\nran across Hyde between the lines.  The Dorsets and Wintons had\ngone over the top together, and he had been left behind with a\nbullet in his chest.  I was done to the world, but he had some\nbrandy left and shared it with me.  If it had not been for Hyde I\nshould never have brought Dale in.\"\n\n\"Well, I've never heard that before,\" said Rowsley to his fourth\negg.\n\nIsabel was silent, and her eyes in the shadow of a momentary\ngravity were the eyes of a woman and not of a child.  She raised\nthem to look out at the evening sky, indigo blue against the\nlamplit interior, or faintly primrose in the west, and wondered\nfor the thousandth time why it was still such an effort to Val to\nrefer to his brief military experience.  Soft country noises came\nin, peaceful and soothing: the short shrill shriek of a bat, the\nrustle of a branch of rose-leaves moving like a hand over the\nwindow panes, a faint breathing of wind from the moor.  Surely\nthe scar of war ought to be healed by now!  Isabel kept these\nthoughts to herself: young as she was, her solitary life--for\na woman alone among men is always to some extent solitary--had\ntrained her to a clear perception of what had better not be said.\n\n\"When is Hyde coming?\" asked Val, going on with his salad.\n\n\"Tomorrow, didn't you hear me say Laura is going to bring him\nhere to tea?  He's staying at his own place, Farringay--I think\nfrom the way Laura spoke it is what one calls a place--and they\nexpect him by the morning train.  Laura's to meet him in the\ncar.\"\n\n\"Did you ask her to bring him in to tea,\"  said Rowsley, frowning\nover the marmalade jar, \"when Val is safe to be out and you\ndidn't know I should be here?\"\n\n\"Yes: oughtn't I to have?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else you would like to speak to me about?\"\nsaid Isabel after a pregnant silence. \"Dear Rowsley, you seem\ndetermined to look after my manners and morals!  I asked him to\nplease Laura. She's nervous of Major Clowes.  Jack and Yvonne\nare coming too.\"\n\n\"Oh I don't see that it signifies,\" said Val.  Mrs. Clowes\nwouldn't have accepted if it weren't all right. I don't see that\nyou or I need worry if she doesn't.  Isabel is old enough to pour\nout tea for herself.  In any case, as it happens, you'll be here\nif I'm not, and I dare say Jimmy will look in for ten minutes.\"\n\n\"You are sweet, Val,\" said Isabel gratefully.\n\n\"Oh I don't say Rowsley's not right!  Prigs generally are: and\nbesides now I come to think of it, Laura did look faintly amused\nwhen I asked her. But these stupid things never occur to me till\nafterwards!  After all, what am I to do?  I can't manufacture a\nchaperon, and it would be very bad for the parish if the vicar\nnever entertained.  And it's not as if Captain Hyde were a young\nman; he's thirty-six if he's a day.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhen the sea retreats after a storm one finds on the beach all\nsorts of strange flotsam.  Bernard Clowes was a bit of human\nwreckage left on the sands of society by the storm of the war.\nWhen it broke out he was a second lieutenant in the Winchester\nRegiment, a keen polo player and first class batsman who rarely\nopened a book.  He was sent out with the First Division and\ncarried himself with his usual phlegmatic good humour through\nalmost four years of fighting from Mons to Cambrai.\n\nIn the March break-through he had his wrist broken by a rifle-bullet\nand was invalided home, where he took advantage of his leave to get\nmarried, partly because most of the men he knew were already married,\nand partly to please his sister. There were no other brothers, and\nMrs. Morrison, a practical lady, but always a little regretful of her\nown marriage with Morrison's Boot and Shoe Company, recommended him\nwith the family bluntness to arrange for an olive branch before the\nHuns got him.\n\nLaura, a penniless woman two years his senior and handicapped by\nher disreputable belongings, was not the wife Gertrude Morrison\nwould have chosen for him: still it might have been worse, for\nLaura was well-born and personally irreproachable, while Clowes,\nhot-blooded and casual, was as likely as not to have married a\nchorus-girl.  If any disappointment lingered, Gertrude soothed\nit by trying over in her own mind the irritation that she would\nbe able to produce in Morrison circles: \"Where he met her?\nOh, when she was staying with her married sister at Castle\nWharton . . . .Yvonne, the elder Selincourt girl, married into\nthe Bendish family.\"\n\nBernard did not care a straw either for the paternal handicap or\nfor the glories of the Wharton connection.  He took his\nlove-affair as simply as his cricket and with the same bold\nconfidence. Laura was what he wanted; she would fit into her\nsurroundings at Wanhope as delicately as an old picture fits\ninto an old frame, and one could leave her about--so he put\nit to himself--without fear of her getting damaged.  When Tom\nMorrison, shrewd business man, dropped a hint about the rashness\nof marrying the daughter of a scamp like Ferdinand Selincourt,\nBernard merely stared at him and let the indiscretion go in\nsilence.  He can scarcely be said to have loved his bride, for\nup to the time of the wedding his nature was not much more\ndeveloped than that of a prize bull, but he considered her a\nvery pretty woman, and his faith in her was a religion.\n\nSo they were married, and went to Eastbourne for their honeymoon:\nan average match, not marked by passion on either side, but\ndestined apparently to an average amount of comfort and good\nwill.  They had ten gay days before Laura was left on a victoria\nplatform, gallantly smiling with pale lips and waving her\nhandkerchief after the train that carried Bernard back to the\nfront.\n\nFive months later on the eve of the Armistice he was flung out\nof the service, a broken man, paralysed below the waist, cursing\nevery one who came near him and chiefly the surgeons for not\nletting him die.  No one ever desired life more passionately than\nBernard desired death.  For some time he clung to the hope that\nhis mind would wear his body out.  But his body was too young,\ntoo strong, too tenacious of earth to be betrayed by the renegade\nmind.\n\nThere came a day when Clowes felt his youth welling up in him\nlike sap in a fallen tree: new energy throbbed in his veins, his\nheart beat strong and even, it was hard to believe that he could\nnot get off his bed if he liked and go down to the playing fields\nor throw his leg over a horse.  This mood fastened on him without\nwarning in a Surbiton hospital after a calm night without a\nsleeping draught, when through his open window he could see green\nbranches waving in sunlight, and hear the cries of men playing\ncricket and the smack of the driven ball: and it was torture.\nTears forced their way suddenly into Bernard's eyes.  His nurse,\nwho had watched not a few reluctant recoveries, went out of the\nroom.  Then his great chest heaved, and he sobbed aloud, lying\non his back with face unhidden, his wide black eyes blinking at\nthe sweet pale June sky.  No chance of death for him: he was good\nfor ten, twenty, fifty years more:  he could not bear it, but it\nhad to be borne.  He tried to pull himself up: if he could only\nhave reached the window!  But the arms that felt so strong were\nas weak as an infant's, while the dead weight of his helpless\nlegs dragged on him like lead.  The only result of his struggle\nwas a dreadful access of pain.  Reaction followed, for he had\nlearnt in his A B C days not to whimper when he was hurt, and by\nthe time the nurse returned Clowes had scourged himself back to\nhis usual savage tranquillity.  \"Can I have that window shut,\nplease?\" he asked, cynically frank. \"I used to play cricket\nmyself.\"\n\nLaura Clowes in this period went through an experience almost\nequally formative. Two years older than Bernard, she was also\nmore mature for her years and had developed more evenly, and from\nthe outset her engagement and marriage had meant more to her then\nto Bernard, because her girlhood had been unhappy and they provided\na way of escape.  Her sister Yvonne had met Jack Bendish at a\nrace-meeting and he had fallen madly in love with her and married\nher in a month in the teeth of opposition.  That was luck--heaven-sent\nluck, for Yvonne on the night before her marriage had broken down\nutterly and confessed that if Jack had not saved her she would have\ngone off with the first man who asked her on any terms, because she\nwas twenty-nine and sick to death of wandering with her father on the\noutskirts of society.  Subsequently Yvonne had after a hard fight won\na footing at Wharton for herself and her sister, and there Laura had\nmet Clowes, not such a social prize as Jack, but rich and able to\ngive his wife an assured position.  She was shrewd and realized that\nin himself he had little to offer beyond a handsome and highly\ntrained physique and a mind that worked lucidly within the limits of\na narrow imagination but she was beyond all words grateful to him,\nand he fascinated her more than she realized.\n\nThe ten days at Eastbourne opened her eyes.  Bernard enjoyed\nevery minute of them and was exceedingly pleased with himself\nand proud of his wife, but for Laura they were a time of heavy\nstrain.  Innocent and shy, she had feared her husband, only to\ndiscover that she loved him better than he was capable of loving\nher.  Laura was not blind.  She understood Bernard and all his\nlimitations, the dangerous grip that his passions had of him,\nhis boyish impatience, his wild-bull courage, and his inability\nto distinguish between a wife and a mistress: she was happiest\nwhen he slept, always holding her in his arms, exacting even in\nsleep, but so naively youthful in the bloom of his four and\ntwenty summers, and, for the moment, all her own.  She loved him\n\"because I am I--because you are you,\" and her tenderness was\nedged with the profound pity that women felt in those days for\nthe men who came to them under the shadow of death.  It was her\nhope that the strong half-developed nature would grow to meet her\nneed.  It grew swiftly enough: in the forcing-house of pain he\nsoon learned to think and to feel: but the change did not lead\nhim to his wife's heart.\n\nLaura had married a man of a class and apparently normal to a\nfault: she found herself united now to incarnate storm and\ntempest.  The first time she saw him at Surbiton, he drove her\nout in five minutes with curses and insult.  Why?  Laura,\nwandering about half-stunned in the visitors' room, had no idea\nwhy.  She stumbled against the furniture: she looked at the\nphotographs of Windermere and King's College Chapel and the\nNursing Staff on the walls: she took up Punch and began to read\nit.  Laura was no dreamer, she had never doubted that her husband\nwould rather have the use of his legs again than all the feminine\ndevotion in the world, but she had hoped to soothe him, perhaps\nfor a little while to make him forget:  it had not crossed her\nmind that her anguish of love and service would be rejected.\nEnlightenment was like folding a sword to her breast.\n\nBy and by his nurse came down to her, a young hard-looking woman\nwith tired eyes.  She had little comfort to give, but what she\ngave Laura never forgot, because it was the truth without any\nconventional or sentimental gloss.  \"You're having a bad time\nwith him, aren't you?\" she said, coldly sympathetic.  \"It won't\nlast.  Nothing lasts.  You mustn't think he's left off caring for\nyou.  I expect he was very fond of you, wasn't he?  That's the\ntrouble. Some men take invalid life nicely and let their wives\nfuss over them to their hearts' content, but Major Clowes is one\nof those tremendously strong masculine men that always want to be\ntop dog.  Besides, you're young and pretty, if you don't mind my\nsaying so, and you remind him of what he's done out of . . .\nTwenty-four, isn't he?  Don't give way, Mrs. Clowes,  you've a\nlong road before you; these paralysis cases are a frightful\nworry, almost as bad for the friends as they are for the patient;\nbut if you play up it'll get better instead of worse.  He'll get\nused to it and so will you.  One gets used to anything.\"\n\nEven so: time goes on and storms subside.  Bernard Clowes came\nout of the hospital and he and his wife settled down on friendly\nterms after all. \"It's not what you bargained for when you\nmarried me,\" said the cripple with his hard smile. \"However, it's\nno good crying over spilt milk, and you must console yourself\nwith the fact that there's still plenty of money going.  But I\nwish we'd had a little more time together first.\" He pierced her\nwith his black eyes, restless and fiery.  \"I dare say you would\nhave liked a boy.  So should I.  Nevermind, my girl, you shan't\nmiss much else.\"\n\nWanhope, the family property, was buried deep in Wiltshire, three\nor four miles from a station.  Laura liked the country: Wanhope\nlet it be, then: and Wanhope it was, with the additional\nadvantage that Yvonne was at Castle Wharton within a stroll.\nLaura liked a wide house and airy rooms, a wide garden, plenty of\nland, privacy from her neighbours: all this Wanhope gave her, no\nslight relief to a girl who had been brought up between Brighton\nand Monte Carlo. The place was too big to be run without an\nagent?  No drawback, the agent: on the contrary, Clowes looked\nout for a fellow who would be useful to Laura, a gentleman, an\nunmarried man, who would be available to ride with her or make a\nfourth at bridge--and there by good luck was Val Stafford ready\nto hand.  Born and reared in the country, though young and\nuntrained, Val brought to his job a wide casual knowledge of\nlocal conditions and a natural head for business, and was only\ntoo glad to squire Laura in the hunting field.  For Laura must\nhunt: as Laura Selincourt she had hunted whenever she was offered\na mount, and she was to go on doing as she had always done.\nLaura would rather not have hunted, for the freshness of her\nyouth was gone and the strain of her life left her permanently\ntired, and she pleaded first expense, then propriety.  \"Don't be\na damned fool,\" replied Bernard Clowes.  So Laura went riding\nwith Val Stafford.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Major Clowes in a rasping snarl, and Laura came\ninto her husband's room and stumbled over a chair.  The windows\nwere shuttered and the room was still dark at eleven o'clock of a\nfine June morning.  Laura, irrepressibly annoyed, groped her way\nthrough a disorder of furniture, which seemed, as furniture\nalways does in the dark, to be out of place and malevolently full\nof corners, and without asking leave flung down a shutter and\nflung up a window.  In a field across the river they were cutting\nhay, and the dry summer smell of it breathed in, and with it the\nlong rolling whirr of a haymaking machine and its periodical\nclash, most familiar of summer noises.  And the June daylight lit\nup the gaunt body of Bernard Clowes stretched out on a water\nmattress, his silk jacket unbuttoned over his strong, haggard\nthroat.  \"Really, Berns,\" said Laura, flinging down a second\nshutter, \"I don't wonder you sleep badly.  The room is positively\nstuffy!  I should have a racking headache if I slept in it.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't, you see,\" Bernard replied politely.  \"Stop\npulling those blinds about.  Come over here.\" Laura came to him.\n\"Kiss me,\" said Clowes, and she laid her cool lips on his cheek.\nClowes received her kiss passively: even Laura,  though she\nunderstood him pretty well, never was sure whether he made her\nkiss him because he liked it or because he thought she did not\nlike it.\n\n\"Where are you off to now?\" asked Clowes, pushing her away: \"you\nlook very smart. I like that cotton dress.  It is cotton, isn't\nit?\" he rubbed the fabric gingerly between his finger and thumb.\n\"Did Catherine make it?  That girl is a jewel. I like that gipsy\nhat too, it's a pretty shape and it shades your eyes.  I call\nthat sensible, which can't often be said for a woman's clothes.\nYou have good eyes, Laura, well worth shading, though your figure\nis your trump card.  I like these fitting bodices that give a\nwoman a chance to show what shape she is.  All you Selincourt\nwomen score in evening gowns.  Yvonne has a topping figure,\nthough she's an ugly little devil.  She has an American\ncomplexion and her eyes aren't as good as yours.  Where did you\nsay you were going?\"\n\n\"To the station to meet Lawrence. I promised to fetch him in the\ncar.\"\n\n\"Lawrence?  So he's due today, is he?  I'd forgotten all about\nhim.  And you're meeting him?  Oh yes, that explains the dress\nand hat,  I thought you wouldn't have put them on for my\nbenefit.\"\n\n\"Dear, it's only one of the cotton frocks I wear every day, and I\ncouldn't go driving without a hat, could I?\"\n\n\"Can't conceive why you want to go at all.\"  Laura was silent.\n\"If Lawrence must be met, why can't Miller go alone?\" Miller was\nthe chauffeur.  \"Undignified, I call it, the way you women run\nafter a man nowadays.  You think men like it but they don't.\"\n\nLaura wondered if she dared tell him not to be silly.  He might\ntake it with a grin, in which case he would probably relent and\nlet her go: or--?  The field of alternative conjecture was wide.\nIn the end Laura, whose knee was still aching from her adventure\nwith the chair, decided to chance it.  But--perhaps because they\nwere suffused with irritation--the words had no sooner left her\nlips than she regretted them.\n\n\"I won't have it.\" Bernard's heavy jaw was clenched like a\nbloodhound's. \"It's not decent running after Hyde while I'm tied\nhere by the leg. I won't have you set all the village talking.\nThere's the Times on my table.  Stop. Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To ring the bell.  It's time Miller started. You don't want your\ncousin to find no one there to meet him--not even a cart for his\nluggage.\"\n\n\"He can walk.  Do him good: and Miller can fetch the luggage\nafterwards.  You do as I tell you.  Take the Times.  Sit down in\nthat chair with your face to the light and read me the leading\narticles and the rest of the news on Page 7. Don't gabble: read\ndistinctly if you can--you're supposed to be an educated woman,\naren't you?\"\n\nPoor Laura had been looking forward to her drive.  She had taken\nsome innocent pleasure in choosing the prettiest of her morning\ndresses, a gingham that fell into soft folds the colour of a\nperiwinkle, and in rearranging the liberty scarf on her drooping\ngipsy straw, and in putting on her long fringed gauntlets and\nlittle country shoes.  Her husband's compliments made her wince,\nJack Bendish had eyes only for his wife, Val Stafford's\nadmiration was sweet but indiscriminate: but she remembered\nLawrence as a connoisseur.  And worse than the sting of her own\nsmall disappointment were the breaking of her promise to\nLawrence, the failure in hospitality, in common courtesy.\n\nAnd for the thousandth time Laura wondered whether it would not\nhave been better for Bernard, in the long run, to defy his\nsenseless tyranny.  He was at her mercy: it would have been easy\nto defy him.  Easy, but how cruel!  A trained nurse would have\nmade short work of Bernard's whims, he would have been washed and\nbrushed and fed and exercised and disregarded--till he died\nunder it?   Perhaps.  It was safer at all events to let him go\nhis own way.  He could never hope to command his regiment now:\nlet him get what satisfaction he could out of commanding his\nwife!  She would have preferred a form of sacrifice which looked\nless like fear, but there was little sentiment in Bernard, and\nlove must not pick and choose.  For it was love still, the old\ninexplicable fascination: in the middle of one of his tirades,\nwhen he was at his most wayward, she would lose herself in the\ncontemplation of some small physical trait, the scar of a burn on\nhis wrist or the tiny trefoil-shaped birthmark on his temple, as\nif that summed up for her the essence of his personality, and\nwere more truly Bernard Clowes then his intemperate insignificance\nof speech. . . . Even when others suffered for it she yielded to\nBernard, because she loved him and because he suffered so infinitely\nworse than they.\n\nFor denial maddened him.  He raised himself on his arm, crimson\nwith anger, his chest heaving under the thin silken jacket which\ndefined his gaunt ribs--\"Sit down, will you, damn you?\" Because\nLaura believed that she and she only stood between  her husband\nand despair, she yielded and began to read out the Times leader\nin a voice that was perfectly gentle and placid.\n\nBernard sank back and watched her like a cat after a mouse.  He\nwas under no delusion: he knew she was not cowed or nervous, but\nthat the spring of her devotion was pity--pity ever fed anew by\nhis dreadful helplessness: and it was this knowledge that drove\nhim into brutality.  The instincts of possession and domination\nwere strong in him, and but for the accident that wrenched his\nmind awry he would probably have made himself a king to Laura,\nfor, once her master, he would have grown more gentle and more\ntender as the years went by, while Laura was one of those women\nwho find happiness in love and duty: not a weak woman, not a\ncoward, but a humble-minded woman with no great opinion of her\nown judgment, who would have liked to look up to father, brother,\nsister, husband, as better and wiser than herself. But in his\npresent avatar he could not master her: and Clowes, feeling as\nshe felt, seeing himself as she saw him, came sometimes as near\nmadness as any man out of an asylum.  He was not far off it now,\nthough he lay quiet enough, with not one grain of expression in\nhis cold black eyes.\n\nThe 11:39 pulled up at Countisford station, and Lawrence Hyde got\nout of a first class smoking carriage and stood at ease, waiting\nfor his servant to come and look after him.  \"There'll be a car\nwaiting from Wanhope, Gaston--\"\n\n\"Zere no car 'ere, M'sieu--ze man say.\"\n\n\"What, no one to meet me?\" Evidently no one: there were not half\na dozen people on the flower-bordered platform, and those few\nwere country folk with bundles and bags.  Lawrence strolled out\ninto the yard, hoping that his servant's incorrigibly lame\nEnglish might have led to a misunderstanding.  But there was no\nvehicle of any kind, and the station master could not recommend a\ncab.  Countisford was a small village, smaller even than\nChilmark, and owed the distinction of the railway solely to its\nbeing in the flat country under the Plain.  \"But you don't mean\nto say,\" said Lawrence incredulous, \"that I shall have to walk?\"\n\nBut it seemed there was no help for it, unless he preferred to\nsit in the station while a small boy on a bicycle was despatched\nto Chilmark for the fly from the Prince of Wales's Feathers; and\nin the end Lawrence went afoot, though his expression when faced\nwith four miles of dusty road would have moved pity in any heart\nbut that of his little valet.  Hyde was one of those men who\nchange their habits when they change their clothes.  He did not\ncare what happened to him when he was out of England, following\nthe Alaskan trail in eighty degrees of frost, or thrashing round\nthe Horn in a tramp steamer, but when he shaved off his beard,\nand put on silk underclothing and the tweeds of Sackville Street,\nhe grew as lazy as any flaneur of the pavement.  Gaston however\nwas not sympathetic. He was always glad when anything unpleasant\nhappened to his master.\n\nLeaving Gaston to sit on the luggage, Lawrence swung off with his\nlong even stride, flicking with his stick at the bachelor's\nbuttons in the hedge.  He could not miss his way, said the\nstation master: straight down the main road for a couple of\nmiles, then the first turning on the left and the first on the\nleft again.  Some half a mile out of Countisford however Lawrence\ncame on a signpost and with the traveller's instinct stopped to\nread it:\n\n              WINCANTON              8 M.\n              CASTLE WHARTON         3 1\/2 M.\n              CHILMARK               3 M.\n\nSo ran the clear lettering on the southern arm.  Eastwards a much\nmore weatherbeaten arm, pointing crookedly up a stony cart track,\nsaid in dim brown characters: \"CHILMARK 2 M.\" Plainly a short cut\nover the moor!  Better stones underfoot than padded dust: and\nLawrence struck uphill swiftly, glad to escape from the traffic\nof the London road.  But he knew too much about short cuts to be\nsurprised when, after climbing five hundred feet in twice as many\nyards--for the gradients off the Plain are steep--he found\nhimself adrift on the open moor, his track going five ways at\nonce in the light dry grass.\n\nHe halted, leaning on his stick.  He was on the edge of the\nPlain: below him stretched away a great half-ring of cultivated\ncountry, its saliencies the square tower of a church jutting over\na group of elms, or the glint of light on a stream, or pale\nhaystacks dotted round the disorderly yard of a grange--the\ntillage and the quiet dwellings of close on a thousand years.\nOn all this Lawrence Hyde looked with the reflective smile of an\nalien.  It touched him, but to revolt.  More than a child of the\nsoil he felt the charm of its tranquillity, but he felt it also\nas an oppression, a limitation: an ordered littleness from which\nworld-interests were excluded.  He was a lover of art and a\ncosmopolitan, and though the lowland landscape was itself a piece\nof art, and perfect in its way, Hyde's mind found no home in it.\nYet, he reflected with his tolerant smile, he had fought for it,\nand was ready any day to fight for it again--for stability and\ntradition, the Game Laws, the Established Church, and the\nrotation of crops.  He was the son of an English mother and had\nreceived the training of an Englishman.  A rather cynical smile,\nnow and then, at the random and diffident ways of England was the\nonly freedom he allowed to the foreign strain within him.\n\nAnd when he looked the other way even this faint feeling of\nirritation passed off, blown away by the wind that always blows\nacross a moor, thin and sweet now, and sunlit as the light curled\nclouds that it carried overhead through the profound June blue.\nAcres upon acres of pale sward, sown all over with the blue of\nscabious and the lemon-yellow of hawkweed, stretched away in\nrolling undulations like the plain of the sea; dense woods hung\nmassed on the far horizon, beech-woods, sapphire blue beyond the\npale silver and amber, of the middle distance, and under them a\npuff of white smoke from a passing train, or was it the white\nscar of a quarry?  He could not be sure across so many miles of\nsunlit air, but it must have been smoke, for it dissolved slowly\naway till there was no gleam left under the brown hillside.  Here\ntoo was stability, permanence: the wind ruffling the grass as it\nhad done when the Normans crossed their not far distant Channel,\nor rattling over hilltops through leather-coated oak groves which\nhad kept their symmetry since their progenitors were planted by\nthe Druids.  Here was nothing to cramp the mind: here was the\nEngland that has absorbed Celt, Saxon, Fleming, Norman,\ngeneration after generation, each with its passing form of\npolitical faith: the England of traditional eld, the beloved\ncountry.\n\nIn the meanwhile Lawrence had to find Chilmark.  He had neither\nmap nor compass and was unfamiliar with the lie of the land, but,\nmindful of the station master's directions to go south and turn\ntwice to the left, he shaped a course south-east and looked for a\nshepherd to ask his way of.  At present there were no shepherds\nto be seen and no houses; here and there a trail of smoke marked\nsome hidden hamlet, sunk deep in cup or cranny, but which was\nChilmark he could not tell.  Down went the track, plunging\ntowards a stream that brawled in a wild bottom: up over a rough\nhillside ruby-red with willowherb: then down again to a pool\nshaded by two willows and a silver birch, and lying so cool and\nsolitary in its own cloven nook, bounded in every direction by\nhalf a furlong of chalky hillside, that Lawrence was seized with\na desire to strip and bathe, and sun himself dry on the brilliant\nmossy lawn at its brink.  But out of regard for the Wanhope lunch\nhour he walked on, following a trickle of water between reeds and\nknotgrafis, till in the next winding of the glen he came on a\nhouse: only a labourer's cot, two rooms below and one above, but\ninhabited, for smoke was coming out of the chimney.  Lawrence\nturned up a worn thread of path and knocked with his stick at the\nopen door.\n\nIt was answered by a tall young girl with a dirty face, wearing a\nserge skirt pinned up under a dirty apron.  The house was dirty\ntoo: the smell of an unwashed, unswept interior came out of it,\ntogether with the wailing of a fretful baby.  \"I've missed my\nway on the moor,\" said Lawrence, inobtrusively holding his\nhandkerchief to his nose. \"Can you direct me to Chilmark?\"\n\n\"Do you mean Chilmark or Castle Wharton?  Oh Dorrie, don't cry!\"\nShe lifted the babe on her arm and stood gazing at Lawrence in a\nleisured and friendly manner, as if she wondered who he were. \"It\nisn't far, but it's a long rambling village and there are any\nnumber of paths down.  And if you want the Bendishes--\" Evidently\nshe thought he must want the Bendishes, and perhaps Lawrence's\njudgment was a little bribed by her artless compliment, for at\nthis point he began to think her pretty in an undeveloped way:\ncertainly she had lovely eyes, dark blue under black lashes,\nwhich reminded him of other eyes that he had seen long ago--but\nwhen?  He could not remember those wistful eyes in any other\nwoman's face.\n\n\"I'm making for Wanhope--Major Clowe's house.\"\n\n\"Oh, but then you must be Captain Hyde,\" exclaimed Miss\nStafford:  \"aren't you? that Mrs. Clowes was expecting.\"\n\n\"My name is Hyde.  No one met me at the station\" in spite of\nhimself Lawrence could not keep his grievance out of his voice\n\"so, as there are no cabs at Countisford, I had to walk.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, how sad: and on such a hot day too!  You'll be so\ntired.\" Was this satire?  Pert little thing!  Lawrence was\nfaintly amused--not irritated, because she was certainly very\npretty: what a swan's throat she had under her holland blouse,\nand what a smooth slope of neck!  But for all that she ought to\nhave sirred him.\n\n\"So you know Mrs. Clowes, do you?\" He said with as much\npoliteness as a little girl deserves who has lovely eyes and a\ndirty face.  It had crossed his mind that she might be one of the\nservants at Wanhope: he knew next to nothing of the English\nlabouring classes, but was not without experience of lady's\nmaids.\n\n\"Yes, I know her,\" said Isabel.  She hung on the brink of\nintroducing herself--was not Captain Hyde coming to tea with her\nthat afternoon?--but was deterred by a very unusual feeling of\nconstraint.  She was not accustomed to be watched as Hyde was\nwatching her, and she felt shy and restless, though she knew not\nwhy.  It never entered her head that he had taken her for Dorrie\nDrury's sister.  She was dressed like a servant, but what of\nthat?  In Chilmark she would have remained \"Miss Isabel\" if she\nhad gone about in rags, and it would have wounded her bitterly to\nlearn that she owed the deference of the parish rather to her\nrank as the vicar's daughter, who visited at Wanhope and Wharton,\nthan to any dignity of her own.  In all her young life no one had\never taken a liberty with Isabel.  And, for that matter, why\nshould any one take a liberty with Dorrie Drury's sister?\nIsabel's father would not have done so, nor her brothers, nor\nindeed Jack Bendish, and she was too ignorant of other men to\nknow what it was that made her so hot under Hyde's eyes.  \"But\nyou'll be late for lunch. Wait half a minute and I'll run up with\nyou to the top of the glen.\"\n\nLawrence watched her wrap her charge carefully in a shawl, and\nfetch milk from the dresser, and coax till Dorrie turned her\nsmall head, heavy with the cares of neglected babyhood, sideways\non the old plaid maud and began to suck.  Apparently he had\ninterrupted the scrubbing of the kitchen floor,  for the tiles\nwere wet three quarters of the way over, and on a dry oasis stood\na pail, a scrubbing brush, and a morsel of soap.  Among less\nhonourable odours he was glad to distinguish a good strong whiff\nof carbolic.\n\nIsabel meanwhile had recovered from her little fit of shyness.\nShe pulled off her apron and pulled down her skirt (it had been\nkilted to the knee), rinsed her hands under a tap, wiped her face\nwith a wet handkerchief, and came out into the June sunshine\nbareheaded, her long pigtail swinging between drilled and slender\nshoulders.  \"Yours are London boots,\" she remarked as she\nbuttoned her cuff.  \"Do you mind going over the marsh?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Not if you get your feet wet?\" Lawrence laughed outright.  \"But\nit's a real marsh!\" said Isabel offended: \"and you're not used to\nmud, are you?  You don't look as if you were.\" She pointed down\nthe glen, and Lawrence saw that some high spring, dammed at its\nexit and turned back on itself, had filled the wide bottom with a\nsponge of moss thickset with flowering rush and silken fluff of\ncotton grass.  \"There's no danger in summertime, the shepherds\noften cross it and so do I.  Still if you're afraid--\"\n\n\"I assure you I'm not afraid,\" said Lawrence, looking at her so\noddly that Isabel was not sure whether he was angry or amused.\nNor was Lawrence.  She had struck out of his male vanity a\nresentment so crude that he was ashamed of it, ashamed or even\nshocked?  He was not readily shocked.  A pure cynic, he let into\nhis mind, on an easy footing, primitive desires that the average\nman admits only behind a screen.  Yet when these libertine\nfancies played over Isabel's innocent head they were distasteful\nto him:  as he remembered once, in a Barbizon studio, to have\nknocked a man down for a Gallic jest on the Queen of Heaven\nalthough Luke's Evangel meant no more to him than the legend of\nEros and Psyche.  But one can't knock oneself down--more's the\npity!\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Isabel impatiently.  He was watching her\nagain!  \"But do look where you're going, this isn't Piccadilly.\nYou had better hold my hand.\"\n\nLawrence was six and thirty.  At eighteen he would have snatched\nher up and carried her over: at thirty-six he said: \"Thanks very\nmuch,\" touched the tips of her fingers, let them fall. . . .\nUnfortunately however he weighed more than Isabel or the\nshepherds, and, half way across, the green floor quietly gave way\nunder him: first one foot immersed itself with a gentle splash\nand then the other--\"Oh dear\" said Isabel, seized with a great\ndisposition to laugh. Lawrence was not amused.  His boots were\nfull of mud and water and he had an aching sense of injured\ndignity.  The bog was not even dangerous: and ankle-deep,\ncalf-deep, knee-deep he waded through it and got out on the\nopposite bank, bringing up a cloud of little marsh-bubbles on his\nheels.  Isabel would have given all the money she had in the\nworld--about five shillings to go away and laugh, but she had\nbeen well brought up and she remained grave, though she grew very\nred.\n\n\"I am so sorry!\" she faltered, looking up at Lawrence with her\nbeautiful sympathetic eyes (one must never say I told you so).\n\"I never thought you really would go in.  You must be very heavy!\nOh! dear, I'm afraid you've spoilt your trousers, and it was all\nmy fault.  Oh! dear, I hope you won't catch cold.  Do you catch\ncold easily?\"\n\n\"Oh no, thanks.  Do you mind showing me the way to Wanhope?\"\n\nIsabel without another word took the steep hillside at a run. In\nher decalogue of manners to refuse an apology was an unpardonable\nsin.  How differently Val would have behaved!  Val never lost his\ntemper over trifles, and if anything happened to make him look\nridiculous he was the first to laugh at himself.  At this time in\nher life Isabel compared Val with all the other men she met and\nmuch to his advantage.  She forgot that Lawrence was not her\nbrother and that no man cares to be made ridiculous before a\nwoman, or rather she never thought of herself as a woman at all.\n\nShe pointed east by south across the Plain.  \"Do you see that\nhawk hovering?  Carry your eye down to the patch of smoke right\nunder him, in the trees: those are the Wanhope chimneys.  If you\ngo straight over there till you strike the road, it will bring\nyou into Chilmark High Street.  Go on past Chapman the draper's\nshop, turn sharp down a footpath opposite the Prince of Wales's\nFeathers, cross the stream by a footbridge, and you'll be in the\ngrounds of Wanhope.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lawrence, \"your directions are most precise.\"\nHe had one hand in his pocket feeling among his loose silver:\ntips are more easily given than thanks, especially when one is\nnot feeling grateful, and he was accustomed to pay his way\nthrough the world with the facile profusion of a rich man.  Still\nhe hesitated: if he had not the refined intuition that would have\nmade such a blunder impossible to Val Stafford, he had at all\nevents enough intelligence to hesitate.  There is a coinage that\nis safer than silver, and Lawrence thought it might well pass\ncurrent (now that she had washed her face) with this fair\nschoolgirl of sixteen, ruffled by sun and wind and unaware of her\nbeauty.  He would not confess to himself that the prospect of\nIsabel's confusion pleased him.\n\nHe bent his head, smiling into Isabel's eyes. \"You're a very kind\nlittle girl.  May I--?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Isabel.\n\nThe blood sprang to her cheek, but she did not budge, not by a\nhair's breadth.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Lawrence, standing\nerect. He had measured in that moment the extent of his error,\nand he cursed, not for the first time, his want of perception,\nwhich his ever-candid father had once called a streak of\nvulgarity. Defrauded of the pleasure he had promised himself\nfrom the contact of Isabel's smooth cheek, he grew suddenly very\ntired of her.  Young girls with their trick of attaching\nimportance to trifles are a nuisance!\n\nHe forced a smile.  \"I beg your pardon, I had no idea--  I see\nyou're ever so much older than I thought you were.  Some day I\nshall find my way up here again and you must let me make my peace\nwith a box of chocolates.\" He raised his hat--he had not done so\nwhen she opened the door--and swung off across the moor, leaving\nthe vicar's daughter to go back and scrub Mrs. Drury's floor as\nit had never been scrubbed before in its life.  The honours of\nthe day lay with Isabel, but she was not proud of them, and her\nface flamed for the rest of the morning.  \"You're worse than\nMajor Clowes!\" she said violently to the kitchen tap.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n\"How do?\" Bernard Clowes was saying an hour later.  \"So good of\nyou to look us up.\"\n\nLawrence, coming down from his own room after brushing his muddy\nclothes, met his cousin with a good humoured smile which covered\ndismay.  Heavens, what a wreck of manhood!  And how chill it\nstruck indoors, and how dark, after the June sunshine on the\nmoor! Delicately he took the hand that Clowes held out to him--\nbut seized in a grip that made him wince.  Clowes gave his curt\n\"Ha ha!\"\n\n\"I can still use my arms, Lawrence.  Don't be so timid, I shan't\nbreak to pieces if I'm touched.  It's only these legs of mine\nthat won't work.  Awkward, isn't it?  But never mind that now,\nit's an old story.  You had a mishap on the moor, the servants\ntell me?  Ah! while I think of it, let me apologize for leaving\nyou to walk from the station.  Laura, my wife, you know, forgot\nto send the car.  By the by, you know her, don't you?  She says\nshe met you once or twice before she married me.\"\n\nLike most men who surrender to their temperaments, Lawrence was\nas a rule well served by his intuitions.  Now and again they\nfailed him as with Isabel, but when his mind was alert it was a\nsensitive medium.  He dropped with crossed knees into his chair\nand glanced reflectively at Bernard Clowes, heu quantum\nmutatus. . . . When the body was wrecked, was there not nine\ntimes out of ten some corresponding mental warp?  Bernard's\nfluent geniality struck him as too good to be true--it was not\nin Bernard's line: and why translate a close friendship into\n\"meeting once or twice\"? Was Bernard misled or mistaken, or was\nhe laying a trap?--Not misled: the Laura Selincourt of Hyde's\nrecollection was not one to stoop to petty shifts.\n\n\"'Once or twice?'\"  Lawrence echoed: \"Oh, much oftener than that!\nMrs. Clowes and I are old friends, at least I hoped we were.  She\ncan't be so ungracious as to have forgotten me?\"\n\n\"She seems to have, doesn't she?\"  Bernard with his inscrutable\nsmile let the question drop.  \"Just touch that bell, will you,\nthere's a good fellow? So sorry to make you dance attendance--\nHallo, here she is!\"\n\nLaura had been waiting in the parlour, under orders not to enter\ntill the bell rang.  She had heard all, and wondered whether it\nwas innocence or subtlety that had walked in and out of Bernard's\ntrap.  She remembered Hyde was much like other fourth-year\nUniversity men except that he was not egotistical and not shy:\nhe had altered away from his class, but in what direction it was\ndifficult to tell: there was no deciphering the pleasant\nblankness of his features or the conventional smile in his black\neyes.\n\n\"I haven't seen you for fourteen years,\" she said, giving him her\nhand.  \"Oh Lawrence, how old you make me feel!\"\n\n\"Shall I swear you haven't changed?  It would be a poor\ncompliment.\"\n\n\"And one I couldn't return.  I shouldn't have known you, unless\nit were by your likeness to Bernard.\"\n\n\"Am I like Bernard?\" said Lawrence, startled.\n\n\"That's a good joke, isn't it?\" said Clowes. \"But my wife is\nright.  If I were not paralysed, we should be a good bit alike.\"\n\nUnder the casual manner, it was in that moment that Hyde saw his\ncousin for what he was: a rebel in agony.  There was a tragedy at\nWanhope then, Lucian Selincourt had not exaggerated.  Though\nLawrence was not naturally sympathetic, he felt an unpleasant\ntwinge of pity, much the same as when his dog was run over in the\nstreet: a pain in the region of the heart, as well defined as\nrheumatism.  In Sally's case, after convincing himself that she\nwould never get on her legs again, he had eased it by carrying\nher to the nearest chemist's: the loving little thing had licked\nhis hand with her last breath, but when the brightness faded out\nof her brown eyes, in his quality of Epicurean, Lawrence had not\nlet himself grieve over her.  Unluckily one could not pay a\nchemist to put Bernard Clowes out of his pain!  \"This is going to\nbe deuced uncomfortable,\" was the reflection that crossed his\nmind in its naked selfishness.  \"I wish I had never come near the\nplace. I'll get away as soon as I can.\"\n\nThen he saw that Bernard was struggling to turn over on his side,\nflapping about with his slow uncouth gestures like a bird with a\nbroken wing. \"Let me--!\" Laura's \"No, Lawrence!\" came too late.\nHyde had taken the cripple in his arms, lifting him like a child:\n\"You're light for your height,\" he said softly.  He was as strong\nas Barry and as gentle as Val Stafford.  Laura had turned\nperfectly white.  She fully expected Clowes to strike his cousin.\nShe could hardly believe her eyes when with a great gasp of\nrelief he flung his arm round Hyde's neck and lay back on Hyde's\nshoulder.  \"Thanks, that's damned comfortable--first easy moment\nI've had since last night,\" he murmured: then, to Laura, \"we must\npersuade this fellow to stop on a bit.  You're not in a hurry to\nget off, are you, Lawrence?\"\n\n\"Not I. I'll stay as long as you and Laura care to keep me.\"\n\n\"I and Laura, hey?\"\n\nBernard's flush faded: he slipped from Hyde's arm.\n\n\"H'm, yes, you're old friends, aren't you?  Met at Farringay?\nI'd forgotten that.\" He shut his eyes.  \"And Laura's dying to\nrenew the intimacy.  It's dull for her down here. Take him into\nthe garden,  Lally.  You'll excuse me now, Lawrence, I can't talk\nlong without getting fagged.  Wretched state of things, isn't it?\nI'm a vile bad host but I can't help it.  At the present moment\nfor example I'm undergoing grinding torments and it doesn't amuse\nme to make conversation, so you two can cut along and disport\nyourselves in any way you like. Give Lawrence a drink, will you,\nmy love? . . . . Oh no, thanks, you've done a lot but you can't\ndo any more, no one can, I just have to grin and bear it. Laura,\nwould you mind ringing for Barry?   I'm not sure I shall show up\nagain before dinner-time.  It's no end good of you, old chap, to\ncome to such a beastly house. . .\"\n\nHe pursued them with banal gratitude till they were out of\nearshot, when Lawrence drew a deep breath as if to throw off\nsome physical oppression.  Under the weathered archway, down the\nflagged steps and over the lawn. . . . How still it was, and how\nsweet!  The milk-blooms in the spire of the acacia were beginning\nto turn faintly brown, but its perfume still hung in the valley\nair, mixed with the honey-heavy breath of a great white double\nlime tree on the edge of the stream.  There were no dense woods\nat Wanhope, the trees were set apart with an airy and graceful\neffect, so that one could trace the course of their branches; and\nbetween them were visible hayfields from which the hay had\nrecently been carried, and the headlands of the Plain--fair\nsunny distances, the lowlands bloomed over with summer mist, the\nuplands delicately clear like those blue landscapes that in early\nItalian pictures lie behind the wheel of Saint Catherine or the\nturrets of Saint Barbara.\n\n\"A sweet pretty place you have here. I was in China nine weeks\nago.  Everlasting mud huts and millet fields.  I must say there's\nnothing  to beat an English June.\"\n\n\"Or a French June?\" suggested Laura, her accent faintly sly.\n\"Lucian said he met you at Auteuil.\"\n\n\"Dear old Lucian!  He seemed very fit, but rather worried about\nyou, Laura--may I call you Laura?  We're cousins by marriage,\nwhich constitutes a sort of tie.  Besides, you let me at\nFarringay.\"\n\n\"Farringay. . . . What a long while ago it seems!  I can't keep\nup any pretence of juvenility with you, can I?  We were the same\nage then so we're both thirty-six now.  Isn't it strange to think\nthat half one's life is over?  Mine doesn't seem ever to have\nbegun.  But you wouldn't feel that: a man's life is so much\nfuller than a woman's.  You've been half over the world while\nBerns and I have been patiently cultivating our cabbage patch.\nI envy you: it would be jolly to have one's mind stored full of\nqueer foreign adventures and foreign landscapes to think about in\nodd moments, even if it were only millet fields.\"\n\n\"I've no ties, you see, nothing to keep me in England.  Come to\nthink of it, Bernard is my nearest male relative, since my father\ndied five years ago.\"\n\n\"I heard of that and wanted to write to you, but I wasn't sure of\nyour address\"\n\n\"I was in Peru.  They cabled to me to come home when he was taken\nill, but I was up country and missed it.  The first news I had\nwas a second cable announcing his death.  It was unlucky.\"\n\n\"For both of you,\" said Laura gently, \"if it meant that he was alone\nwhen he died.\" Sincere herself, Mrs. Clowes exacted from her friends\neither sincerity or silence, and her sweet half-melancholy smile\npierced through Hyde's conventional regrets. He was silent, a little\nconfused.\n\nThey were near the river now, and in the pale shadow of the lime\ntree Laura sat down on a bench, while Hyde threw himself on a\npatch of sunlit turf at her feet.  Most men of his age would have\nlooked clumsy in such an unbuttoned attitude, but Hyde was an\nathlete still, and Laura, who was fond of sketching, admired his\nvigorous grace.  She felt intimate with him already: she was not\nshy nor was Lawrence, but this was an intimacy of sympathy that\nwent deeper than the mere trained ease of social intercourse: she\ncould be herself with him: she could say whatever she liked.\nAnd, looking back on the old days which she had half forgotten,\nLaura remembered that she had always felt the same freedom from\nconstraint in Hyde's company: she had found it pleasant fourteen\nyears ago, when she was young and had no reserves except a\nnatural delicacy of mind, and it was pleasant still, but strange,\nafter the isolating adventure of her marriage.  Perhaps she would\nnot now have felt it so strongly, if he had not been her\nhusband's cousin as well as her friend.\n\nShe sat with folded hands watching Lawrence with a vague, observant\nsmile.  Drilled to a stately ease and worn down to a lean hardihood\nby his life of war and wandering, he was, like his cousin, a big,\nhandsome man, but distinguished by the singular combination of black\neyes and fair hair.  Was there a corresponding anomaly in his\ntemperament?  He looked as though he had lived through many\nexperiences and had come out of them fortified with philosophy--that\neasy negative philosophy of a man of the world, for which death is\nonly the last incident in life and not the most important. Of\nBernard's hot passions there was not a sign.  Amiable?  Laura fancied\nthat so far as she was concerned she could count on a personal\namiability: he liked her, she was sure of that, his eyes softened\nwhen he spoke to her.  But the ruck of people?  She doubted whether\nLawrence would have lost his appetite for lunch if they had all been\ndrowned.\n\nThe pleasant, selfish man of the world is a common type, but she\ncould not confine Lawrence to his type.  He basked in the sun:\nwith every nerve of his thinly-clad body he relinquished himself\nto the contact of the warm grass: deliberately and consciously he\nwas savouring the honied air, the babble of running water, the\ncaress of the tiny green blades fresh against his cheek and hand,\nthe swell of earth that supported his broad, powerful limbs.\nThis sensuous acceptance of the physical joy of life pleased\nLaura, born a Selincourt, bred in France, and temperamentally out\nof touch with middle-class England.\n\nWhether one could rely on him for any serviceable friendship\nLaura was uncertain.  As a youth he had inclined to idealize\nwomen, but she was suspicious of his later record.  Good or bad\nit had left no mark on him.  Probably he had not much principle\nwhere women were concerned.  Few of the men Laura had known in\nearly life had had any principles of any sort except a common\nspirit of kindliness and fair play.  Her brother was always\ndrifting in and out of amatory entanglements--the hunter or the\nhunted--and he was not much the worse for it so far as Laura\ncould see.  Perhaps Hyde was of the game stamp, in which case\nthere might well be no lines round his mouth, since lines are\ndrawn by conflict: or perhaps a wandering life had kept him out\nof harm's way.  It made no great odds to Laura--she had not the\nshrinking abhorrence which most women feel for that special form\nof evil: it was on the same footing in her mind as other errors\nto which male human nature is more prone than female, a little\nworse than drunkenness but not so bad as cruelty.  From her own\nlife of serene married maidenhood such sins of the flesh seemed\nas remote as murder.\n\nThe strong southern light broke in splinters on the dancing\nwater, and was mirrored in reflected ripplings, silver-pale,\ntremulous, over the shadowy understems of grass and loosestrife\non the opposite bank.  \"And I never gave you anything to drink\nafter all!\" said Laura after a long, companionable silence.  \"Why\ndidn't you remind me?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't want it.  Don't you worry: I'll look after\nmyself. I always do.  I'm a charming guest, no trouble to any\none.\"\n\n\"At least have a cigarette while you're waiting for lunch!  I'm\nsorry to have none to offer you.\"\n\n\"Don't you smoke now?  You did at Farringay.\"\n\n\"No, I've given it up. I never much cared for it, and Bernard\ndoes so hate to see a woman smoking. He is very old-fashioned in\nsome ways.\"\n\n\"And do you always do as Bernard likes?\" Lawrence asked with an\nimpertinence so airy that it left Laura no time to be offended.\n\"--It was a great shock to me to find him so helpless.  Is he\nalways like that?\"\n\n\"He can never get about, if that's what you mean.\" It was not all\nHyde meant, but Laura had not the heart to repress him; she felt\nthat thrill of guilty joy which we all feel when some one says\nfor us what we are too magnanimous to say for ourselves.  \"He\nlies indoors all day smoking and reading quantities of novels.\"\n\n\"Fearfully sad.  Very galling to the temper.  But there are a lot\nof modern mechanical appliances, aren't there, that ought to make\nhim fairly independent?\"\n\n\"He won't touch any of them.\"\n\n\"Sick men have their whims.  But can't you drag him out into the\nsun?  He ought not to lie in that mausoleum of a hall.\"\n\n\"He has never been in the garden in all our years at Wanhope.\"\n\nLawrence took off his straw hat to fan himself with.  It was not\nonly the heat of the day that oppressed him.  \"Poor, wretched\nBernard!  But I dare say I should be equally mulish if I were in\nhis shoes.  By the by, was he really in pain just now?\"\n\n\"Really in pain?\" Laura echoed.  \"Why--why should you say that?\"\nShe no longer doubted Lawrence Hyde's subtlety.  \"'He's\nconstantly in pain and he scarcely ever complains.\"\n\n\"Oh? I didn't know one suffered, with paralysis.\"\n\n\"He has racking neuritis in his shoulders and back.\"\n\n\"That's bad.  I'm afraid he can't be much up to entertaining\nvisitors.  Does he hate having me here?\"\n\n\"No! oh no!  I know he sometimes seems a little odd,\" said poor\nLaura, wishing her guest were less clear-sighted: and yet before\nhe came she had been hoping that Lawrence would divine the less\nobvious aspects of the situation, and perhaps, since a man can do\nmore with a man like Bernard than any woman can, succeed in\neasing it.  \"But can you wonder?  Struck down like this at five\nand twenty! and he never was keen on indoor interests--sport and\nhis profession were all he cared about.  Please, Lawrence, make\nallowances for him--he had been looking forward so much to your\ncoming here!  A man's society always does him good, and you know\nhow few men there are in this country: we have only the vicar,\nand the doctor, and Jack Bendish and people who stay at the\nCastle.  And if you only realized how different he was with you\nfrom what he is with most people, you would be flattered!  He\nwon't let any one touch him as a rule, except Barry,  whom he\ntreats like a machine.  But he was quite grateful to you--he\nseemed to lean on you.\"\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\nShe had made Lawrence feel uncomfortable again in the region of\nthe heart, but he was deliberately stifling pity, as five years\nago, in a Peruvian fonda, he had subdued his filial tenderness\nand grief.  He was not callous: if he had had the earlier cable\nhe would have sailed for home without delay.  But since Andrew\nHyde was dead and would never know whether his son wept for him\nor not, Lawrence set himself to repress not only tears but the\nfount of human feeling that fed them.  He had dabbled enough in\npsychology to know that natural emotions, if not indulged, may\nonly be driven down under the surface, there to work havoc among\nthe roots of nerve life.  Lawrence however had no nerves and no\nfear of Nemesis, and no inclination to sacrifice himself for\nBernard, and he determined, if Wanhope continued to inspire these\noppressive sensations to send himself a telegram calling him\naway.\n\nHe changed the subject.  \"It's a long while since I've heard\nstockdoves cooing.  And, yes, that's a nightingale.  Oh, you\njolly little beggar!\" His face fell into boyish creases when he\nsmiled. \"Do you remember the nightingales at Farringay?  Laura--\nmay I say it?--while rusticating in Arden you haven't forgotten\ncertain talents you used to possess.  The dress is delightful,\nbut where the masterhand appears is in the way it's worn.  That\ncarries me back to Auteull.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Laura, changing her attitude, but not visibly\ndispleased.\n\n\"Oh I shan't say don't move\"  Lawrence murmured.  \"The slippers\nalso. . . . Are there many trout in this river, I wonder?  Hallo!\nthere's a big fellow rubbing along by that black stone!   Must\nweigh a cool pound and a half. I suppose the angling rights go\nwith the property?\"\n\n\"You can fish all day long if you like: the water is ours, both\nsides of it, as far south as the mill above Wharton and a good\nhalf-mile upstream.  The banks are kept clear on principle,\nthough none of us ever touch a line.  The Castle people come\nover now and then: Jack Bendish is keen, and he says our sport\nis better than theirs because they fish theirs down too much.\nVal put some stock in this spring.\"\n\n\"Val?\"\n\n\"You seem to fit in so naturally,\" Laura smiled, \"that I forget\nyou've only just come.  Val is Bernard's agent, and I ought not\nto have omitted him from our list of country neighbours, but he's\nlike one of the family.  Bernard wants you, to meet him because\nhe was near you in the war.  But I don't know that you'll have\nmuch in common: Val was very junior to you, and he's not keen on\ntalking about it in any case.  So many men have that shrinking.\nHave you, I wonder?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't take impressions easily. Didn't your friend\nenjoy it?\"\n\n\"He had no chance.  He had only six or seven weeks at the front;\nhe was barely nineteen, poor boy, when he was invalided out.\nThat was why Bernard offered him the agency--he was delighted to\nlend a helping hand to one of his old brother officers.\"\n\n\"Wounded?\"\n\n\"Yes, he had his right arm smashed by a revolver bullet.  Then\nrheumatic fever set in, and the trouble went to the heart, and he\nwas very ill for a long time.  I don't suppose he ever has been\nso strong as he was before.  What made it so sad was the splendid\nway he had just distinguished himself,\" Laura continued.  She\ngave a little sketch of the rescue of Dale, far more vivid than\nVal had ever given to his family.  \"Perhaps you can imagine what\na fuss Chilmark made over its solitary hero!  We're still proud\nof him.  Val is always in request at local shows: he appears on\nthe platform looking very shy and bored.  Poor boy!  I believe he\nsometimes wishes he had never won that embarrassing decoration.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Val Stafford.  Why--do you remember him?\"\n\n\"Er--yes, I do,\" said Lawrence.  He took out his cigar case and\nturned from Laura to light a cigar.  \"I knew a lot of the\nDorchesters. . . Amiable-looking, fair boy, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Middle height, and rather sunburnt.  But that description fits\nsuch dozens!  However, I'm taking you up to tea there this\nafternoon, if the prospect doesn't bore you, so you'll be able to\njudge for yourself.  He has a young sister who threatens to be\nvery pretty.  Are you still interested in pretty girls, M. le\ncapitaine?\"\n\n\"Immensely.\" Hyde lay back on one arm, smoking rather fast. \"I\nsee no immediate prospect of my being bored, thanks.  Rather fun\nrunning into Stafford again after all these years! I shall love a\nchat over old times.\"  He raised his black eyes, and Laura\nstarted.  Was it her fancy, or a trick of the sunlight, that\nconjured up in them that sparkle of smiling cruelty, gone before\nshe could fix it?  \"You say he doesn't care to talk about his\nmilitary exploits?  He always was a modest youth, I should love\nto see him on a recruiting platform.  Wait till I get him to\nmyself, he won't be shy with me.  Did you tell him I was coming?\"\n\n\"I told his sister Isabel, who probably told him. I haven't seen\nhim since, he hasn't happened to come in; I suppose the hay\nharvest has kept him extra busy--Dear me! why, there he is!\"\n\nIn the field across the stream a young man on horseback had come\ninto view.  Catching sight of Laura he slipped across a low\nboundary wall, his brown mare, a thoroughbred, changing her feet\nin a ladylike way on the worn stones, and trotted down to the\nriverbank, raising his cap.\n\n\"Coming in to lunch, Val?\" Laura called across the water.\n\n\"Thank you very much, I'm afraid I shan't have time.\"\n\n\"But you haven't been in since Sunday!\"  Laura's accent was\nreproachful.  \"Why are you forsaking us?  We need you more than\nthe farm does!\"\n\nVal's pleasant laugh was the avoidance of an answer.  \"So sorry!\nBut I can't come in now, Laura: I have to go over to Countisford\nto talk to Bishop about the new tractor, and I want to get back\nby teatime.  Isabel tells me you're bringing Captain Hyde up to\nsee us.\" He raised his cap again, smiling directly at Lawrence,\nwho returned the salute with such gay good humour that Laura was\nable to dismiss that first fleeting impression from her mind.\nSo this was Val Stafford, was it?  And a very personable fellow\ntoo! Hyde had not foreseen that ten years would work as great a\nchange in Val as in himself, or greater.\n\n\"I was going to call on you in due form, sir, but my young\nsister hasn't left me the chance.  You haven't forgotten me, have\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, I remember you most distinctly.  Delighted to meet you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  The pleasure is mutual.  Now I must push on or I\nshall be late.\"\n\n\"He can use his arm, then,\" said Lawrence, as Val rode away,\njumping his mare over a fence into the road.  \"Shaves himself and\nall that, I suppose?  He rides well.\"\n\n\"A great deal too well! and rides to hounds too, but he ought not\nto do it, and I'm always scolding him.  He can't straighten his\nright arm, and has very little power in it.  He was badly thrown\nlast winter, but directly he got up he was out again on Kitty.\"\n\n\"Living up to his reputation.\" Lawrence flicked the ash from his\ncigar.  \"I should have known him anywhere by his eyes.\"\n\n\"He has kept very young, hasn't he?  An uneventful life without\nmuch anxiety does keep people young,\" philosophized Laura.  \"I\nfeel like a mother to him.  But you'll see more of him this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"So I shall,\" said Lawrence, \"if he isn't detained at\nCountisford.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThe reason why Lawrence found Isabel scrubbing Mrs. Drury's\nfloor was that Dorrie's pretty, sluttish little mother had been\nwhisked off to the Cottage Hospital with appendicitis an hour\nearlier.  She was in great distress about Dorrie when Isabel,\ncoming in with the parish magazine, offered to stay while Drury\nwent to fetch an aunt from Winterbourne Stoke.  When Drury drove\nup in a borrowed farm cart, Isabel without expecting or receiving\nmany thanks dragged her bicycle to the top of the glen and pelted\noff across the moor.  Her Sunbeam was worn and old, so old that\nit had a fixed wheel, but what was that to Isabel?  She put her\nfeet up and rattled down the hill, first on the turf and then on\nthe road, in a happy reliance on her one serviceable brake.\n\nHer father was locked in his study writing a sermon: Isabel\nhowever tumbled in by the window.  She sidled up to Mr. Stafford,\nsat on his knee, and wound one arm round his neck.  \"Jim\ndarling,\" she murmured in his ear, \"have you any money?\"\n\n\"Isabel,\" said Mr. Stafford, \"how often have I told you that I\nwill  not be interrupted in the middle of my morning's work?  You\ncome in like a whirlwind, with holes in your stockings--\"\n\nIsabel giggled suddenly.  \"Never mind, darling, I'll help you\nwith your sermon.  Whereabouts are you?  Oh!--'I need not tell\nyou, my friends, the story we all know so well'--Jim, that's\nwhat my tutor calls 'Redundancy and repetition.' You know quite\nwell you're going to tell us every word of it.  Darling take its\nlittle pen and cross it out--so--with its own nasty little\ncross-nibbed J--\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying you want money,\"  Mr. Stafford\nhurriedly changed the subject, \"and how much do you want?  The\nbutcher's bill came to half a sovereign this week, and I must\nkeep five shillings to take to old Hewitt--\"\n\n\"I want pounds and pounds.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said Mr. Stafford aghast.  He took off his spectacles\nto polish them, and then as he put them on again, \"If it's for\nthat Appleton boy I really can't allow it.  There's nothing\nwhatever wrong with him but laziness\"\n\n\"It isn't for Appleton.  It's for me myself.\"  Isabel sat up\nstraight, a little flushed.  \"I'm growing up.  Isn't it a\nnuisance? I want a new dress!  I did think I could carry on till\nthe winter, but I can't.  Could you let me have enough to buy one\nready-made?  Chapman's have one in their window that would fit me\npretty well.  It's rather dear, but somehow when I make my own\nthey never come right.  And Rowsley says I look like a scarecrow,\nand even Val's been telling me to put my hair up!\"\n\n\"Put your hair up, my child?  Why, how old are you? I don't like\nlittle girls to be in a hurry to turn into big ones\"\n\n\"I'm not a little girl,\" said Isabel shortly.  \"I'm nineteen.\"\n\n\"Nineteen? no, surely not!\"\n\n\"Twenty next December.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Stafford, quite overcome. \"How time flies!\"\nHe set her down from his knee and went to his cash box.  \"If Val\ntells you to put your hair up, no doubt you had better do it.\" He\npaused.  \"I don't know whether Val said you ought to have a new\nfrock, though?  I can't bear spending money on fripperies when\neven in our own parish so many people--\" Some glimmering\nperception reached him of the repressed anguish in Isabel's eyes.\n\"But of course you must have what you need.  How much is it?\"\n\n\"1. 11. 6.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!  That seems a great deal.\"\n\n\"It isn't really much for a best dress,\" said poor Isabel.\n\n\"But you mustn't be extravagant, darling,\" said Mr. Stafford\ntenderly.  \"I see other girls running about in little cotton\ndresses or bits of muslin or what not that look very nice--much\nnicer on a young girl than 'silksand fine array.' Last time\nYvonne came to tea she wore a little frock as simple as a\nchild's\"\n\n\"She did,\" said Isabel.  \"She picked it up in a French sale.  It\nwas very cheap--only 275 francs.\"\n\n\"Eleven pounds!\" Mr. Stafford held up his hands.  \"My dear, are\nyou sure?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Isabel. Mr. Stafford sighed. \"I must speak to\nYvonne.  'How hardly shall they...'\"  He took a note out of his\ncash box. \"Can't you make that do--?\" he was beginning when a\nqualm of compunction came upon him.  After all it was a long time\nsince he had given Isabel any money for herself, and there must\nbe many little odds and ends about a young girl's clothing that\nan elderly man wouldn't understand.  He took out a second note\nand pressed them both hurriedly into Isabel's palm.  \"There! now\nrun off and don't ask me for another penny for the next\ntwelvemonth!\" he exclaimed, beaming over his generosity though\nmore than half ashamed of it.  \"You extravagant puss, you! dear,\ndear, who'd have a daughter?\"\n\nIsabel gave him a rather hasty though warm embrace (she was\nterribly afraid that his conscience would prick him and that he\nwould take the second note away again), and flew out of the\nwindow faster than she had come in.  The clock was striking a\nquarter past one, and she had to scamper down to Chapman's to buy\nthe dress, and a length of lilac ribbon for a sash, and a packet\nof bronze hairpins, and be back in time to lay the cloth for two\no'clock lunch.  If it is only for idle hands that Satan finds\nmischief, he could not have had much satisfaction out of Isabel\nStafford.\n\nSoon after four Mrs. Clowes stepped from her car, shook out her\nsoft flounces, and led the way across the lawn, Lawrence Hyde in\nattendance.  The vicarage was an old-fashioned house too large\nfor the living, its long front, dotted with rosebushes, rising up\nhoney-coloured against the clear green of a beech grove.  There\nare grand houses that one sees at once will never be comfortable,\nand there are unpretentious houses that promise to be cool in\nsummer and warm in winter and restful all the year round: of such\nwas Chilmark vicarage, sunning itself in the afternoon clearness,\nwhile faded green sunblinds filled the interior with verdant\nshadow, and the smell of sweetbrier and Japanese honeysuckle\nbreathed round the rough-cast walls.\n\nIsabel had laid tea on the lawn, and Mrs. Clowes smiled to herself\nwhen she saw seven worn deck chairs drawn up round the table; she was\nalways secretly amused at Isabel in her character of hostess, at the\nnaive natural confidence with which the young lady scattered\ninvitations and dispensed hospitality.  But when Isabel came forward\nLaura's covert smile passed into irrepressible surprise.  She raised\nher eyebrows at Isabel, who replied by an almost imperceptible but\ntriumphant nod.  In her white and mauve embroidered muslin, her dark\nhair accurately parted at the side of her head and drawn back into\nwhat she called a soup plate of plaits, Isabel no longer threatened\nto be pretty.  Impelled by that singularly pure benevolence which a\nwoman who has ceased to hope for happiness feels for the eager\ninnocence of youth, Laura drew her close and kissed her.  \"My sweet,\nI'm so glad,\" she whispered. A bright blush was Isabel's only answer.\nThen Mrs. Clowes stepped back and indicated her cavalier, very big\nand handsome in white clothes and a Panama hat: \"May I introduce--\nCaptain Hyde, Miss Stafford,\" with a delicate formality which\nthrilled Isabel to her finger-tips.  Let him see if he would call her\na little girl now!\n\nLawrence recognized Isabel at a glance, but he was not abashed.\nHe scarcely gave her a second thought till he had satisfied\nhimself that Val Stafford was not present.  Lawrence smiled, not\nat all surprised: he had had a presentiment that Val, the modest\neasy-going Val of his recollections, would be detained at\nCountisford: too modest by half, if he was shy of meeting an old\nfriend!  Rowsley Stafford was doing the honours and came forward\nto be introduced to Lawrence, a ceremony remarkable only because\nthey both took an instantaneous dislike to each other.  Lawrence\ndisliked Rowsley because he was young and well-meaning and the\nchild of a parsonage, and Rowsley disliked Lawrence because a\nmanner which owed some of its serenity to his physical advantages,\nand his tailor, and his income, irritated the susceptibilities of\nthe poor man's son.\n\nPoor men's sons were often annoyed by Lawrence Hyde's manner.\nNot so Jack Bendish, sprawling in a deck chair which had no\nsound pair of notches: not so his wife, Laura's sister, Yvonne of\nthe Castle, curled up on a moth-eaten tigerskin rug, and clad in\nraiment of brown and silver which even Mr. Stafford would not\nhave credited to Chapman's General Drapery and Grocery Stores.\nIsabel was innocently surprised when the Bendishes found they had\nmet Captain Hyde in town.  Laura's smile was very faintly tinged\nwith bitterness: she knew of that small world where every one\nmeets every one, though she had been barred out of it most of her\nlife, first by her disreputable father and then by the tragedy of\nher marriage: Rowsley pulled his tooth-brush moustache and said\nnothing.  He was young, but not so young as Isabel, and there\nwere moments when he felt his own footing at the Castle to be\nvaguely anomalous.\n\nHowever, the talk ran easily.  Lawrence, as was inevitable, sat\ndown by Yvonne Bendish: she did not raise an eyelash to summon\nhim, but it seemed to be a natural law that the rich unmarried\nman should sit beside her and talk cosmopolitan scandal, and show\na discreet appreciation of her clothing and her eyes.  Meanwhile\nthe other four conversed with much greater simplicity upon such\nhomely subjects as the coming school treat and the way Isabel had\ndone her hair, Rowsley's regimental doings, and a recent turn-up\nbetween Jack Bendish as deputy M. F. H. and Mr. Morley the Jew.\n\nBernard Clowes had described Mrs. Jack Bendish as a plain little\ndevil, but as a rule the devilry was more conspicuous than the\nplainness.  She was a tall and extremely slight woman, her\nfeatures insignificant and her complexion sallow, but her figure\nindecorously beautiful under its close French draperies.  And yet\nif she had let Lawrence alone he would have gone over to the\nother camp. How they laughed, three out of the four of them, and\nwhat marvellous good tea they put away!  The little Stafford girl\nhad a particularly infectious laugh, a real child's giggle which\ndoubled her up in her chair.  Lawrence had no desire to join in\nthe school treat and barnyard conversation, but he would have\nliked to sit and listen.\n\n\"If no one will have any more tea,\" said Isabel, jumping up and\nshaking the crumbs out of her lap, \"will you all come and eat\nstrawberries?\"\n\n\"Isn't Val coming in?\" asked Laura.\n\n\"Not till after five.  He said we weren't to wait for him: he was\ndelayed in getting off.  He sent his love to you, Laura, and he\nwas very sorry.\"\n\n\"His love!\" said Yvonne Bendish.\n\n\"My dear Isabel, I'm sure he didn't,\" said Laura laughing.\n\n\"Kind regards then,\" said Isabel: \"not that it signifies, because\nwe all do love you, darling.  Val's always telling me that if I\nwant to be a lady when I grow up I must model my manners on yours.\nNot yours, Yvonne.\"\n\n\"After that the least I can do is to wait and give him his tea\nwhen he does appear,\" said Laura. \"It's very hot among the\nstrawberry beds, and I'm a little tired: and I haven't seen Val\nfor days.\"\n\n\"No more have I,\" said Yvonne in her odd drawl, \"and I'm tired\ntoo.\"  Mrs. Jack Bendish was made of whipcord: she had been\nbrought up to ride Irish horses over Irish fences and to dance all\nnight, after tramping the moors all day with a gun.  \"I'll stay with\nyou and rest.  Jack, you run on.  Bring me some big ones in a cabbage\nleaf.  And, Captain Hyde, you'll find them excellent with bread and\nbutter.\" By which Lawrence perceived that his interest in the other\ncamp had not gone unobserved, and that was the worst of Yvonne:\nbut--and that was the best of Yvonne: there was no tinge of spite in\nher jeering eyes.\n\nSo the sisters remained on the lawn, and Jack Bendish, a\nperfectly simple young man, walked off with Rowsley to pick a\ncabbage leaf.  Isabel was demureness itself as she followed with\nCaptain Hyde. The embroidered muslin gave her courage, more\ncourage perhaps than if she could have heard his frank opinion of\nit.  \"The trailing skirt of the young girl,\" said Miss Stafford\nto herself, \"made a gentle frou-frou as she swept over the velvet\nlawn.\" A quoi revent les junes filles?  Very innocent was the\nvanity of Isabel's dreams.  She was not strictly pretty, but she\nwas young and fresh, and the spotless muslin fell in graceful\nfolds round her tall, lissome figure.  To the jaded man of the\nworld at her side . . . .  Alas for Isabel!  The jaded man of\nthe world was a trifle bored: he was easily bored.  He liked\nlistening to Miss Stafford's artless merriment but he had no\ndesire to share in it; what had he to say to a promoted\nschoolgirl in her Sunday best?\n\nHe began politely making conversation.  \"What a pretty place this\nis!\" It seemed wiser not to refer even by way of apology to the\nindiscretion of the morning.  \"You have a beautiful view over the\nPlain.  Rather dreary in winter though, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I like it best then,\" said Isabel briefly.  \"Don't you want any\nstrawberries?\" She indicated the netted furrows among which\nlittle could be seen of Rowsley and Jack Bendish except their\nstern ends.\n\n\"No, thanks, I had too much tea.\" Isabel checked herself on the\nbrink of reminding him that he had eaten only two cucumber\nsandwiches and a macaroon.  In Lawrence Hyde's society her\nconversation had not its usual happy flow, she felt tonguetied\nand missish.  \"How close you are to the Downs here!\" They were\nfollowing a flagged path between espalier pear trees, and beds of\nbroccoli and carrots and onions, and borders full of old standard\nroses and lavender and sweet herbs and tall lilies; at the end\nappeared a wishing gate in a low stone wall, and beyond it,\npathless and sunshiny, the southern stretches of the Plain.  \"Are\nyou a great gardener, Miss Isabel?\"\n\n\"Some,\" said Isabel. \"I look after my pet vegetables.  The\nflowers have to look after themselves.  My father has eruptions\nof industry.\"  She overflowed into a little laugh.  \"We don't\nencourage him in it.  He had a bad attack of weeding last spring,\nand pulled up all my little salads by mistake.\"  Now that small\ntale, she reflected, would have tickled Jack Bendish, but Captain\nHyde, though he smiled at it dutifully, did not seem to be\namused.\n\n\"Oh bother you!\" Isabel apostrophised him mentally.  \"You're not\nthe grandson of a duke anyhow. I expect you would be nicer if you\nwere.\"\n\nShe folded her arms on the gate and gazed across the Plain.  The\nvillage below was not far off, but they could see nothing of it,\nburied as it was in the river-valley and behind a green arras of\nbeech leaves: in every other direction, far as the eye could see,\nleagues of feathery pale grass besprinkled with blue and yellow\nflowers went away in ribbed undulations, occasionally rolling up\ninto a crest on which a company of fir trees hung like men on\nmarch.  The sun was pale and smudged, the sky veiled: on its\nsilken pallor floated, here and there, a blot of dark low cloud,\nand the clear distances presaged rain.\n\n\"May I--?\" Lawrence took out his cigarettes. Isabel gave a\ngrudging assent.  She could not understand how any one could be\nwilling to taint the sweet summering air that had blown over so\nmany leagues of grass and flowers.  \"Dare I offer you one?\"\nLawrence asked, tendering his case.  It was of gold, and bore his\nmonogram in diamonds. Isabel eyed it scornfully.  Jack Bendish's\nwas only silver and much scratched and dinted into the bargain.\nNow Jack Bendish was the grandson of a duke.\n\n\"'No thank you,\" said Miss Stafford.  \"I detest smoking.\"\n\n To this Lawrence made no reply at all, no doubt, thought Isabel,\nbecause he did not consider it worth one.  She was proportionally\nsurprised and a trifle flattered when he replaced the cigarette\nto which he had just helped himself. \"'The young girl had not\nrealized her own power.  She was only just coming into her\nwoman's kingdom.  Her heart beat faster and a vermilion blush\ndyed her pale cheek.\"' Isabel's favourite authors were Stevenson\nand Mr. Kipling, but her mental rubric insisted on clothing itself\nin the softer style of Molly Bawn.\n\n\"I don't detest other people's smoking,\" she explained in a\nrather penitent tone.\n\n\"Let's get out on the downs,\" said Lawrence.  He swung the gate\nto and fro for her, then took off his hat and strolled slowly by\nher side through the rustling grass.  \"Really,\" he said, more to\nhimself than to her, \"there are places in England that are very\nwell worth while.\"\n\n\"Worth while what?\"\n\n\"Er--worth coming to see.  I suppose there isn't much shooting\nto be had except rabbits.\" He swung an imaginary gun to his\nshoulder and sighted it at a quarry which seemed to Isabel to be\nequally imaginary.  \"See him?  Under that heap of stones left of\nthe beech ring.\" Isabel's vision was both keen and practised, but\nshe saw nothing till the rabbit showed his white scut in a\nflickering leap to earth.\n\n\"You have jolly good eyes,\" she conceded, still rather\ngrudgingly.\n\n\"So have bunnies, unluckily.  Major Clowes tells me there's\npretty good shooting over Wanhope. I suppose your brother looks\nafter it, for of course Clowes can do nothing.  It was a great\nstroke of luck for my cousin, getting hold of a fellow like Val.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.  It was a great stroke of luck for\nVal.\"\n\n\"I want so much to meet him.  I'm disappointed at missing him this\nafternoon. I remember him perfectly in the army, though he was\nonly a boy then and I wasn't much more myself.  He must be close\non thirty now.  But when I met him this morning it struck me he\nhadn't altered much.\"  Isabel, looking up eager-eyed, felt\nfaintly and mysteriously chilled.  Was there a point of cruelty\nin Hyde's smile? as there was now and then in his cousin's: she\nhad seen Bernard Clowes watching his wife with the same secret\nglow.\n\n\"Val is old for his age,\" she said.  \"He always seems much older\nthan my other brother, although there are only two or three years\nbetween them.\"\n\n\"Probably his spell in the army aged him.  It must have been a\nformative experience.\"\n\nThis time Isabel had no doubt about it, there was certainly a\ntouch of cruel irony in Hyde's soft voice.  Her breath came fast.\n\"Why do you say that\": she cried--\"say it like that?\"\n\nThe smile faded: Lawrence turned, startled out of his self-possession.\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"As if you we're sneering at Val!\"\n\n\"I?--  My dear Miss Isabel, aren't you a little fanciful?\"\n\nIsabel supposed so too, on second thoughts: how could any man\nsneer at a record like Val's: unless indeed it were with that\npeculiarly graceless sneer which springs from jealousy?  And,\nlittle as she liked Captain Hyde, she could not think him weak\nenough for that. She blushed again, this time without any rubric,\nand hung her head.  \"I'm sorry! But you did say it as if you\ndidn't mean it.  Perhaps you think we make too much fuss over\nVal?  But in these sleepy country villages exciting things don't\nhappen every day.  I dare say you've had scores of adventures\nsince that time you met Val.  But Chilmark hasn't had any.  That\nmakes us remember.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Lawrence with an earnest gentleness foreign\nto his ordinary manner, \"you misunderstood me altogether.  I\nliked your brother very much.  Remember, I was there when he won\nhis decoration--\" He broke off.  An intensely visual memory had\nflashed over him.  Now he knew of whom Isabel had reminded him\nthat morning:  she had her brother's eyes.\n\n\"At the very time?  Were you really?  Do, do, do tell me about\nit!  Major Clowes never will--he pretends he can't remember.\"\n\n\"Has Val never told you?\"\n\n\"Hardly any more than was in the official account--that he was\nleft between the lines after one of our raids, and went back in\nspite of his wound to bring in Mr. Dale.  He had to wait till\nafter dark?\"  Lawrence nodded.. \"And 'under particularly trying\nconditions.' Why was that?\"\n\n\"Because Dale was so close to the German lines. He was entangled\nin their wire.\"\n\nIsabel shuddered.  \"It seems so long ago.  One can't understand\nwhy such cruelties were ever allowed.  Of course they will never\nbe again.\" This naive voice of the younger generation made\nLawrence smile.  \"And Val had to cut their wire?\"\n\n\"To peel it off Dale, or peel Dale off it--what was left of him.\nHe didn't live more than twenty minutes after he was brought in.\"\n\n\"Did you know Dale?\"\n\n\"Not well: he was in my cousin's company, not in mine.\"\n\n\"And was Val under fire at the time?\"\n\n\"Under heavy fire.  The Boches were sending up starshells that\nmade the place as light as day.\"\n\n\"I can't understand how Val could do it with his broken arm.\"\n\n\"His arm wasn't broken when he cut their wires.\"\n\n\"Oh!  When was it then?\"\n\nHyde flicked with his stick at the airy heads of grass that rose\nup thin-sown out of a burnished carpet of lady's slipper.  His\nmanner was even but his face was dark.  \"He had it splintered by\na revolver--shot on his way home, near our lines.\"\n\n\"Oh!  But the Army doctors said the shot must have been fired at\nclose quarters?\"\n\n\"There, you see I'm not much of an authority,  am I?  No doubt,\nif they said so, they were right.  The fact is I was knocked out\nmyself that afternoon with a rifle bullet in the ribs.  It was a\nhot corner for the Wintons and Dorsets.\"\n\n\"Were you?  I'm sorry.\" Isabel ran her eyes with a touch of\nwhimsical solicitude over Hyde's tall easy figure and the\nexquisite keeping of his white clothes.  Difficult to connect him\nwith the bloody disarray of war!  \"Were you too left lying\nbetween the lines?\"\n\n\"With a good many others, English and German.\n\n\"There was a fellow near me that hadn't a scratch.  He was\nfrightened--mad with fear: he lay up in the long grass and wept\nmost of the day.  I never hated any one so much in my life.  I\ncould have shot him with pleasure.\"\n\n\"German, of course?\"\n\nHyde smiled.  \"German, of course.\"\n\n\"If he had been English he would have deserved to be shot,\" said\nIsabel briefly: then, reverting to a subject in which she was far\nmore deeply interested, \"Rowsley--my second brother--said I\nwasn't to cross-examine you: but it was a great temptation,\nbecause one never can get anything out of Val.  And after all\nwe've the right to be proud of him!  Even then, when every one\nwas so brave, you would say, wouldn't you, that Val earned his\ndistinction? It really was what the Gazette called it, 'conspicuous\ngallantry'?\"\n\n\"It was a daring piece of work,\" said Lawrence, reddening to his\nhair.  He fought down a sensation so unfamiliar that he could\nscarcely put a name to it, and forced himself on: \"We were all proud\nof him and we none of us forget it.  Don't tell him I said so,\nthough.  It isn't etiquette.  You won't think I'm trying to minimize\nwhat Val did, will you, if I say that we who were through the\nfighting saw so many horrible and ghastly things . . .\"  Again his\nvoice failed.  He was aware of Isabel's bewilderment, but he was\nseeing more ghosts than he had seen in all the intervening years of\npeace, and they came between him and the sunlit landscape and\nIsabel's young eyes.  War! always war! human bodies torn to rags in a\nmoment, and the flowers of the field wet with a darker moisture than\nrain: the very smell of the trenches was in his nostrils, their odour\nof blood and decay.  What in heaven's name had brought it all back,\nand, stranger still, what had moved him to speak of it and to betray\nfeelings whose very existence was unknown to him and which he had\nnever betrayed before?\n\nThe silence was brief though to Lawrence it seemed endless.  He\ndrove the ghosts back to quarters and finished quietly: \"Well, we\nwon't talk about that, it's not a pleasant subject.  Only give\nVal my love and tell him if he doesn't look me up soon I shall\ncome and call on him.  We're much too old friends to stand on\nceremony.\"\n\n\"All right, I will,\" said Isabel.\n\nThere was a shrub of juniper close by, and she felt under its\nsharp branches.  \"Do you like honeysuckle?\" She held up a fresh\nsprig fragrant with its pale horns, which she had tracked to\ncovert by its scent.  Lawrence was not given to wearing\nbuttonholes, but he understood the friendly and apologetic\nintention and inclined his broad shoulder for Miss Stafford to\npass the stem through the lapel of his coat.  Isabel had not\nintended to pin it in for  him, but she was generally willing to\ndo what was expected of her.  She took a pin from her own dress\n(there were plenty in it), and fastened the flower deftly on the\nbreast of Captain Hyde's white jacket.\n\nAnd so standing before him, her head bent over her task, she\nunwittingly left Lawrence free to observe the texture of her\nskin, bloomed over with down like a peach, and the curves of her\nyoung shoulders, a little inclined to stoop, as young backs often\nare in the strain of growth, but so firm, so fresh, so white\nunder the thin stuff of her bodice:  below her silken plaits, on\nthe nape of her neck, a curl or two of hair grew in close rings,\nso fine that it was almost indistinguishable from its own shadow.\nSwiftly, without warning, Lawrence was aware of a pleasurable\ncommotion in his veins, a thrill that shook through him like a\nburst of gay music.  This experience was not novel, he had felt\nit three or four times before in his life, and on the spot, while\nit was sending gentle electric currents to his finger-tips, he\nwas able to analyse its origin--item, to warm weather and\nlaziness after the strain of his Chinese journey, so much: item,\nto Isabel's promise of beauty, so much: item, to the disparity\nbetween her age and his own, to her ignorance and immaturity, the\nbloom on the untouched fruit, so much more.  But there was this\ndifference between the present and previous occasions when he had\nfallen or thought of falling in love, that he desired no victory:\nno, it was he and not Isabel who was to capitulate, leaning his\nforehead upon her young hand. . . . And he had never seen her\ntill that morning, and the child was nineteen, the daughter of a\ncountry vicarage, brought up to wear calico and to say her\nprayers!  more, she was Val Stafford's sister, and she loved her\nbrother.  Lawrence gave himself a gentle shake.  At six and\nthirty it is time to put away childish things. \"Thank you very\nmuch.  Is that Mrs. Clowes calling us?\"\n\nIt was Laura Clowes and Yvonne Bendish, and Lawrence, as he\nstrolled back with Isabel to the garden gate, had an uneasy\nsuspicion that the episode of the honeysuckle had been overseen.\nLaura was graver than usual, while Yvonne had a sardonic spark in\nher eye.  \"I'm afraid it's no use waiting any longer, Isabel,\"\nsaid Laura.\n\n\"What do you think, Lawrence?  It's after six o'clock.\"\n\n\"Hasn't Val come?\" said Isabel.\n\n\"No, he must have been kept at Countisford.  It's a long ride for\nhim on such a hot day.  Perhaps Mrs. Bishop made him stay to\ntea.\"\n\n\"As if he would stay with any old Mrs. Bishop when he knew you were\ncoming here!\" said Isabel scornfully.  \"Poor old Val, I shan't tell\nhim how you misjudged him, he'd be so hurt.  But I'll send him down,\nshall I, to see you and Captain Hyde after supper?--Tired?  Oh no,\nhe's never too tired to go to Wanhope.\"\n\nShe kissed Laura, gave Lawrence her sweetest friendly smile, and\nreturned to the lawn, where Yvonne had apparently taken root upon\nher tigerskin.  Isabel heard Rowsley say, \"Make her shut up,\nJack,\" but before she could ask why Yvonne was to be shut up the\ndaughter of Lilith had opened fire on the daughter of Eve.  \"And\nwhat did you think of Lawrence Hyde?\" Mrs. Bendish asked,\nstretching herself out like a snake and examining Isabel out of\nher pale eyes, much the colour of an unripe gooseberry.  \"Was he\nvery attractive?  Oh Isabel! oh Isabel!  I should not have\nthought this of one so young.\"\n\nIsabel considered the point. \"I can't understand him,\" she said\nhonestly. \"I liked parts of him.  He isn't so--so homogeneous as\nmost people are.\n\n\"Did he ask you for the honeysuckle?\"\n\n\"No, I gave it to him for a peace offering.  I hurt his feelings,\nand afterwards I was sorry and wanted to make it up with him.\nBut would you have thought he had any feelings? any, that is,\nthat anything I said would hurt?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" from Rowsley.\n\n\"Any woman can hurt any man,\" said Yvonne.  \"But, of course, you\naren't a woman, Isabel.  What was the trouble?\"\n\n\"Oh, something about the war.\"\n\n\"No, my child, it wasn't about the war.  It was something that\nstung up his vanity or his self-love.  Lawrence isn't a\nsentimentalist like Jack or Val.\"  Here Jack Bendish got as far\nas an artless \"Oh, I say!\" but his wife paid no attention.\n\"Lawrence never took the war seriously.\"\n\n\"But he did,\" insisted Isabel.  \"He coloured all over his face--\"\n\nShe paused, realizing that Mrs. Bendish, under her mask of\nscepticism, was agog with curiosity.  Isabel was not fond of\nbeing drawn out.  Lawrence had given her his confidence, and she\nvalued it, for with all her ignorance of society she had seen too\nmuch of plain human nature to suppose that he was often taken off\nhis guard as he had been by her: and was she going to expose him\nto Yvonne's lacerating raillery?  A thousand times no!  \"I\nmisunderstood something he said about Val,\" she continued with\nscarcely a break, and falling back on one of those explanations\nthat deceive the sceptical by their economy of truth.  \"It was\nstupid of me, and awkward for him, so I had to apologize.\"\n\n\"I see.  Come, Jack.\" Yvonne rose to her feet,  more like a snake\nthan ever in her flexibility and swiftness, and held Isabel to\nher for a moment, her arm round her young friend's waist.  \"But\nif you pin any more buttonholes into Captain Hyde's coat,\" the\nlast low murmur was only for Isabel's ear, \"he will infallibly\nkiss you: so now you are forewarned and can choose whether or no\nyou will continue to pay him these little attentions.\"\n\nIsabel was not disturbed.  She had early formed the habit of not\nattending to Mrs. Bendish, and she unwound herself without even\nchanging colour.\n\n\"You always remind me of Nettie Hills at the Clowes's lodge,\" she\nretorted.  \"Mrs. Hills says she's that flighty in the way she\ncarries on, no one would believe what a good sensible girl she is\nunder all her nonsense, and walks out with her own young man as\nregular as clockwork.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nAnd that evening Val Stafford came to pay his respects to his old\ncomrade in arms.  Lawrence had travelled so much that it never\ntook him long to settle down.  Even at Wanhope he managed within\na few hours to make himself at home.  A trap sent over to\nCountisford brought back his manservant and an effeminate\nquantity of luggage, and by teatime his room was strewn from end\nto end with a litter of expensive trifles more proper to a pretty\nwoman than to a man.  Mrs. Clowes, slipping in to cast a\nhousewifely glance to his comfort, held up her hands in mock\ndismay.  \"You must give yourself plenty of time to dust all this\ntomorrow morning, Caroline,\" she said to the house-maid.  She\nlaughed at the gold brushes and gold manicure set, the polished\narray of boots, the fine silk and linen laid out on his bed, the\nperfume of sandalwood and Russian leather and eau de cologne.\n\"And I hope you will be able to make Captain Hyde's valet\ncomfortable.  Did he say whether he liked his room?\"\n\n\"I reelly don't know, ma'am,\"  replied the truthful Caroline.\n\"You see he's a foreigner, and most of what he says, well, it\nreelly sounds like swearing.\n\n\"Madame.\" It was Gaston himself, appearing from nowhere at\nLaura's elbow, and saluting her with an empressement that was\ndue, if Laura had only known it, to the harmony of her flounces.\nLaura eyed the little Gaston kindly.  \"You are of the South,\nare you not?\" she said in her soft French, the French of a\nFrenchwoman but for a slight stiffness of disuse: \"and are you\ncomfortable here, Gaston?  You must tell me if there is anything\nyou want.\"\n\nGaston was grateful less for her solicitude than for the sound\nof his own language.  When she had left the room he caught up a\nphotograph, thrust it back into his master's dressingcase, and\nspat through the open window--\"C'est fini avec toi, vieille\nbiche,\" said he: \"allons donc! j'aime mieux celle-ci par\nexemple.\"\n\nBut, though Laura laughed, it was with indulgence.  While Isabel\nand Lawrence were conversing among the juniper bushes, the\nBendishes had given Mrs. Clowes a sketch of Hyde which had\nconfirmed her own impressions.  Although he liked good food and\nwine and cigars, he liked sport and travel too, and music and\npainting and books.  His eighty-guinea breechloaders were dearer\nto him than the lady of the ivory frame.  Who was the lady of the\nivory frame?  Gaston would have been happy to define with the\nleer of the boulevards the relations between his master and\nPhilippa Cleve.  Gaston had no doubt of them, nor had Frederick\nCleve; Philippa had high hopes; Lawrence alone hung fire.  If he\ncontinued to meet her and she to offer him lavish opportunities\nthe situation might develop, for Lawrence was not sufficiently\nin earnest in any direction to play what has been called the\nill-favoured part of a Joseph, but in his heart of hearts, this\nJoseph wished Potiphar would keep his wife in order.  And,\nstrange to say, Yvonne was not far wide of the mark.  She\nbelieved that Joseph was a sinner but not a willing one: and Jack\nBendish, a little astray among these feminine subtleties,\nassented after his fashion--\"Hyde's rather an ass in some\nways,\" he said simply, \"but he's an all-round sportsman.\"\n\nThus primed, Laura was able to draw out her guest, and dinner\npassed off gaily, for Bernard Clowes was no dog in the manger,\nand listened with sparkling eyes to adventures that ranged from\nAtlantic sailing in a thirty-ton yacht to a Nigerian rhinoceros\nshoot.  Nor was Lawrence the focus of the lime-light-he was\nunaffectedly modest; but when, in expatiating on a favourite\nrifle, he confessed to having held fire till a charging\nrhinoceros bull was within eight and twenty yards of him, Bernard\ncould supply the footnotes for himself. \"I knew she wouldn't let\nme down,\" said Lawrence apologetically.  \"Ah! she was a bonnie\nthing, that old gun of mine.  Ever shoot with a cordite rifle?\"\nBernard shook his head.  \"I'd like you to see my guns,\" Lawrence\ncontinued, too shrewd to be tactful. \"I'll have them sent down,\nshall I? Or Gaston shall run up and fetch 'em. He loves a day in\ntown.\"\n\nUnder this bracing treatment Bernard became more natural than\nLaura had seen him for a long time, and he stayed in the\ndrawingroom after dinner, chatting with Lawrence and listening to\nhis wife at the piano, till Laura thought the Golden Age had come\nagain.  How long would it last?  Philosophers like Laura never\nask that question.  At all events it lasted till half past nine,\nwhen the sick man was honestly tired and the lines of no\nfictitious pain were drawn deep about his mouth and eyes.\n\nMrs. Clowes went away with her husband, who liked to have her at\nhand while Barry was getting him to bed, and Lawrence had\nstrolled out on the lawn, when a shutter was thrown down in\nBernard's room and Laura reappeared at the open window.\n\"Lawrence, are you there?\" she asked, shading her eyes between\nher hands.\n\n\"Here,\" said Lawrence removing his cigar.\n\n\"Will you be so very kind as to unlock the gate over the\nfootbridge?  If Val does look us up tonight he's sure to scramble\nover it, which is awkward for him with his stiff arm.\"\n\nShe dropped a key down to Lawrence.  A voice--Bernard's called\nfrom within, \"Good night, old fellow, thanks for a pleasant\nevening.  I'm being washed now.\"\n\nThe night was overcast, warm, quiet, and very dark under the\ntrees: there was husbandry in heaven, their candles were all out.\nAnd by the bridge under the pleated and tasselled branches of an\nalder coppice the river ran quiet as the night, only uttering an\noccasional murmur or a deep sucking gurgle when a rotten stick,\nframed in foam, span down the silken whirl of an eddy: but\ndown-stream, where waifs of mist curled like smoke off a grey mirror,\nthere was a continual talking of open water, small cold river voices\nthat chattered over a pebbly channel, or heaped themselves up and\ndied down again in the harsh distant murmur of the weir.  The\nquantity of water that passed through the lock gates should have been\nconstant from minute to minute, but the roar of it was not constant,\nnor the pitch of its note, which fell when Lawrence stood erect, but\nrose to a shrill overtone when he bent his head: sometimes one would\nhave thought the river was going down in spate, and then the volume\nof sound dwindled to a mere thread, a lisp in the air.  Lawrence was\nobserving these phenomena with a mind vacant of thought when he heard\nfootsteps brushing through the grass by the field path from the\nvillage.  Val had come, then, after all!\n\nVal had naturally no idea that any one was near him.  He had\nreached the gate and was preparing to vault it when out of the\ndense alder-shadow a hand seized his arm.  \"So sorry if I\nstartled you.\"  But Val was not visibly startled.  \"Mrs. Clowes\nsent me, down to let you in.\"\n\n\"Did she?  Very good of her, and of you,\" returned Val's voice,\npleasant and friendly.  \"She always expects me to walk into the\nriver.  But, after all, I shouldn't be drowned if I did.  Is\nClowes gone to bed?\"\n\n\"He's on his way there.  Did you want to see him?\"\n\n\"I'll look in for five minutes after Barry has tucked him up.\nHave you been introduced to Barry yet?  He's quite a character.\"\n\n\"So I should imagine.  He came in to cart Bernard off, and did\nsomething clumsy, or Bernard said he did, and Bernard cuffed his\nhead for him.  Barry didn't seem to mind much.  Why does he stay?\nIs it devotion?\"\n\n\"He stays because your cousin pays him twice what he would get\nanywhere else.  No, I shouldn't call Barry devoted.  But he does\nhis work well, and it isn't anybody's job.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" Lawrence muttered.\n\n\"Warm tonight, isn't it?  No, thanks, I won't have anything to\ndrink--  I've only just finished supper.  By the by, let me\napologize for my absence this afternoon.  I was most awfully\nsorry to miss you, but I never got away from Countisford till\nafter half past five, and my mare cast a shoe on the way back.\nThen I tried to get her shod in Liddiard St. Agnes, which is one\nof those idyllic villages that people write books about, and\nthere I found an Odd-fellows' fete in full swing.  The village\nblacksmith was altogether too harmonious for business, so not\nbeing able to cuff his head, like your cousin, I was obliged to\nwalk home.\n\n\"Really'?  Have a cigar if you won't have anything else.\" Val\naccepted one, and in default of a match Lawrence made him light\nit from his own.  He was entirely at his ease, though the\nsituation struck him as bizarre, but he did not believe that Val\nwas at ease, no, not for all his natural manner and fertility in\ncommonplace.  Lawrence was faintly sorry for the poor devil, but\nonly faintly: after all, an awkward interview once in ten years\nwas a low price to pay for that night which Lawrence never had\nforgotten and never would forget. He had an excellent memory,\nphotographic and phonographic, a gift that wise men covet for\nthemselves but deprecate in their friends.\n\nLawrence was no Pharisee, but he was not a Samaritan either.  He\nhad deliberately set himself to pull up any stray weeds of moral\nscruple that lingered in a mind stripped bare of Christian ethic,\na task harder than some realize, since thousands of men who have\nno faith in Christ practise virtues that were not known for\nvirtues by the Western world before Christ came to it.  But every\nman is his own special pleader, and Lawrence, whose theory was\nthat one man is as good as another, retained a good hearty\nprejudice against certain forms of moral failure, and excused it\non the ground that it was rather a taste than a principle. He\nlooked directly into Stafford's eyes as the red glow of the cigar\nflamed and faded between the two heads so close together, and in\nhis own eyes there was the same point of smiling ironic cruelty\nthat Isabel had read in them--the same as Stafford himself had\nread in them not so many years ago.  But apparently Stafford read\nnothing in them now.\n\n\"Sit down, won't you? you've had a fagging day.\"  Lawrence\nindicated the chairs left on the lawn.  \"Hear me beginning to\nplay the host!  As a matter of fact, you must know your way about\nthe place far better than I do.  Although we're cousins, Bernard\nand I have seen next to nothing of each other since we were boys\nat school.  You, Val, must know him better than any one except\nhis wife.  I want you to tell me about him.  I'm in dangerous\ncountry and I need a map.\"\n\n\"I should be inclined to vary the metaphor a little and call him\nan uncharted sea,\" Val smiled as he threw one leg over the other\nand settled himself among his cushions.  He was dead tired,\nhaving been up since six in the morning and on his feet or in\nthe saddle all day.  \"But I'm at your service, subject always to\nthe proviso that I'm Bernard's agent, which makes my position\nrather delicate.  What is it you want to know?\"\n\nSince it was whether Clowes behaved decently to his wife,\nLawrence shifted in his chair and flicked the ash from his cigar.\n\"Imprimis, whether Bernard has a trout rod I can borrow.  I\ndidn't know there was any fishing to be had or I'd have brought\nmy own.\"\n\n\"You can have mine: I scarcely ever touch a line now.  Certainly\nnot in hay-harvest!  I'll send it down for you the first thing--\"\nWas it possible that he was as insouciant as he professed to be?\n\n\"Oh, thanks very much,\" Hyde cut in swiftly, but I couldn't\nborrow yours.  I'll find out if Clowes can't lend me one.\"\n\n\"As you please.\" Stafford left it at that and passed on. \"But I\ndon't fancy Bernard has ever thrown a line in his life, he is too\nenergetic to make a fisherman.  By the way, I suppose you won't\nbe staying any length of time at Wanhope?\"\n\nLawrence smiled, the wish was father to the thought: that was\nmore like the Val of old times!\n\n\"That depends--mainly on my cousin, to be frank: I suspect he'll\nsoon get sick of having a third person in the house.\"\n\n\"Oh, probably.  But you needn't take any notice of that.\"\nLawrence looked up in surprise.  \"But, perhaps, that is none of\nmy business.  Or will you let me give you one warning, since\nyou've asked for a map?  Don't be too prompt to take Bernard at\nhis word.  He may be very rude to you and yet not want you to go.\nHe sacks Barry every few weeks. In fact now I come to think of it\nI'm under notice myself, for last time I saw him he told me to\nlook out for another job.  He said what he wanted was a practical\nman who knew a little about farming.\"\n\n\"And you stay on?  Quite right, if it suits your book.\"\nUnconsciously putting the worst construction on everything Val\nsaid or did, Lawrence's conclusion was that probably Val, an\namateur farmer, was paid, like Barry, twice what he was worth in\nthe market.  \"But it wouldn't suit mine.  However, I don't\nimagine Bernard will try it on with me. I'm not Barry.  If he\nhits me I shall hit him back.\"\n\n\"Oh, will you?\" returned Val, invisibly amused. \"I'm not sure\nthat wouldn't be a good plan.  It has at least the merit of\noriginality.  All the same I'm afraid Mrs. Clowes wouldn't like\nit, she is a standing obstacle in the way of drastic measures.\"\n\n\"But why do you want me to stay?\" Lawrence asked more and more\nsurprised.\n\n\"Well, here is what brought me up tonight, when I knew Bernard\nwould be on his way to bed.  Will you--\" he leaned forward, his\nhands clasped between his knees--\"stick it out, whatever happens,\nfor a week or two, and keep your eyes open?  Life at Wanhope\nisn't all plain sailing.\"\n\n\"Plain sailing for Bernard?\"\n\n\"Or for his wife.\"\n\n\"You speak as the friend of the house who sees both sides?\"\n\n\"They're forced on me.\"\n\n\"I'll stay as long as I'm comfortable,\" said Lawrence, cynically\nfrank.  \"More I can't promise.\"\n\nVal leant back with an imperceptible shrug.  He was disappointed\nbut not surprised: there was in Hyde a vein of hard selfishness--\nnot a weakness, for the egoism which openly says \"I will consult\nmy own convenience first\" is too scornful of public opinion to be\ncalled weak, but an acquired defensive quality on which argument\nwould have been thrown away.  Val's arm dropped inert, he was\ntired, not in body alone, but by the strain of contact with\nanother mind, hostile, and pitiless, and dominant.\n\nAnd Lawrence also was content to sit silent, lulled by the rising\nand falling murmur of the stream, and by that agreeably cruel\nmemory. . . .   He had no inclination to recall it to Val, but it\nlent an emotional piquancy to their intercourse.  He had the whip\nhand of Val through the past, and perhaps the present also.\nLawrence had been struck by Val's allusion to Mrs. Clowes.  He\nwas the friend of the house, was he?  Now the position of a\nfriend of the house who shields a wife from her husband is\nnotoriously a delicate one.\n\nVal roused himself.  \"Well, we'll drop this.  I must now say two\nwords on a different subject: I'd rather let it alone, and so I\ndare say would you, but we shall meet a good deal off and on\nwhile you're here, and it had better be got over.  I'm sorry if I\nembarrass you--\"\n\n\"Set your mind at rest,\" said Lawrence, silkenly brutal.  \"You\ndon't embarrass me at all.\"\n\nHe threw away his cigar and got up laughing, and as Val also rose\nLawrence gently slapped him on the back. \"I know what you're\ndriving at--that you've not forgotten that small indiscretion\nof yours, or ceased to regret it.  Don't you worry, Val!  You\nalways were one of the worrying sort, weren't you?  But you need\nnever refer to it again, and I won't if you don't.\" Surely a\ngenerous, a handsome offer!  But Stafford only touched with the\ntips of his fingers the ringed and manicured hand of the elder\nman.\n\n\"Thank you!  But I wasn't going to say anything of the sort.  The\nfact is that for a long while I've been making up my mind to see\nyou some time when you were in England: there was no hurry,\nbecause so long as my father's alive I can do nothing, but when I\nheard you were coming to Wanhope the opportunity was too good to\nbe missed.  Railway fares,\" Val added with a preoccupied smile,\n\"are a consideration to me.  So don't walk away yet, Hyde,\nplease.  I have such a vivid recollection of the last time we met.\nBetween the lines at dawn.  Do you remember?\"\n\n\"Everything, Val.\"\n\n\"You were badly hurt, but before you fainted you dragged a\npromise out of me.\"\n\n\"Dragged it out of you?\" Lawrence repeated: \"that's one way of\nputting it!\"\n\n\"But I made some feeble resistance at the time,\" said Val mildly.\n\"My head wasn't clear then or for a long while after, but I had\na--a presentiment that it was a mistake.  You meant it kindly.\"\nHad he?  Lawrence laughed.  He had never been able, to analyse\nthe complex of instincts and passions that had determined his\ndealings with Stafford on that dim day between the lines.\n\n\"You were in a damned funk weren't you, Val?\"\n\nStafford gave a slight start, the reaction of the prisoner under\na blow.  But apart from the coarse cynicism of it, which\nirritated him, it was no more than he had foreseen, and from then\non till the end he did not flinch.\n\n\"Yes, anything you like: you can't overstate it. But my point is\nthat I gave you my parole.  Will you release me from it?\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Lawrence.\n\nHe had never been more surprised in his life. \"Come in: let us\ntalk this over in the light.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThrough the open windows of the drawingroom, where candlesticks\nof twisted silver glimmered among Laura's old, silvery brocades,\nand dim mirrors, and branches of pink and white rosebuds blooming\ndeliciously in rose-coloured Dubarry jars, the two men came in\ntogether, Lawrence keenly on the watch.  But observation was\nwasted on Stafford who had nothing to conceal, who was merely\nwhat he appeared to be, a faded and tired-looking man of middle\nheight, with blue eyes and brown hair turning grey, and wellworn\nevening clothes a trifle rubbed at the cuffs. It was difficult to\nconnect this gentle and unassuming person with the fiery memory\nof the war, and Lawrence without apology took hold of Stafford's\narm like a surgeon and tried to flex the rigid elbow-muscles, and\nto distinguish with his fingers used to handling wounds the hard\nseams and hollows below its shrunken joint.  The action, which\nwas overbearing was by no means redeemed by the intention, which\nwas brutal.\n\n\"Surely after all these years you don't propose to confess, Val?\"\n\n\"I should like to make some sort of amends.\"\n\n\"Too late: these things can never be undone.\"\n\n\"No, of course not.  Undone? no, nothing once done can be undone.\n\n\"But one needn't follow a wrong path to the bitter end.  You made\nme give you that promise for the sake of discipline and morale.\nBut of the men who were in the trenches with us that night how\nmany are left?  Your battalion were pretty badly cut up at\nCambrai, weren't they?  And the survivors are all back in civil\nlife like ourselves.  If it were to come out now there aren't\ntwenty men who would remember anything about it: except of course\nhere in Chilmark, where they know my people so well.\"\n\n\"But you surely don't contemplate writing to the War Office?\nI've no idea what course they would take, but they'd be safe to\nmake themselves unpleasant. I might even come in for a reprimand\nmyself!  That's a fate I could support with equanimity, but what\nabout you?  If I were you I shouldn't care to be hauled up for an\ninterview!\"\n\n\"Really, if you'll forgive my saying so, I don't want to enter\ninto contingencies at all.  Give me my promise back, Hyde,\nthere's a good fellow, it's worth nothing now to anyone but the\nowner.\"\n\n\"What about your own people?\" said Lawrence, his hands in his\npockets, and falling unawares into the tone of the orderly room.\n\"You'll do nothing while your father's alive: I'm glad you've\nsense enough for that: but what about your brother and sister?\nYou're suffering under some unpractical attack of remorse, Val,\nand like most penitent souls you think of nothing but yourself.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I shrink very much from bringing distress on\nother people.  I'm well aware,\" said Val slowly, \"that a man who\ndoes what I've done forfeits his right to take an easy way out.\"\n\n\"An easy way?\"\n\n\"Believe me, I haven't found the way you imposed on me an easy\none.\"\n\n\"Poor wretch!\" said Lawrence under his breath.  Stafford heard,\nperhaps he was meant to hear: and he glanced out over the dark\nturf on which the windows traced a golden oblong, over the trees,\ndark and mysterious except where the same light caught and\nbronzed the tips of their branches.  In its glow every leaf stood\nout separate and defined, clearer than by day through the\ncontrast of the immense surrounding darkness: and so it had been\nin that bit of French forest years ago, when the wild bright\nsearchlights lit up its plague-spotted glades.  Civilians talk\nglibly of courage and cowardice who have never smelt the odour\nof corruption. . . .\n\n\"What's your motive?  Some misbegotten sense of duty?\"\n\n\"Partly,\" said Val, turning from the window.  How like his eyes\nwere to his young sister's!  The impression was unwelcome, and\nLawrence flung it off.  \"I ought never to have given way to you.\nI ought to have faced Wynn-West and let him deal with me as he\nthought fit.  After all, I was of no standing in the regiment.\nA boy of nineteen--what on earth would it have signified?  I\nwas so very young.\"\n\nNineteen! yes, one called a lad young at nineteen even in those\npitiless days.  Under normal conditions he would have had two or\nthree years' more training before he was required to shoulder the\nresponsibilities and develop the braced muscles of manhood.\n\n\"Anyhow it's all over now--\"\n\n\"No, you forget.\" A wave of colour swept over Val's face but his\nvoice was steady.  \"Through me the regiment holds a distinction\nit hasn't earned, and the distinction is in hands that don't\ndeserve to hold it. That isn't consonant with the traditions of\nthe service.\"\n\n\"Oh, when it comes to the honour of the Army--!\" Lawrence jeered\nat him.  \"There speaks the soldier born and bred.  But I was only\na 'temporary.' Give me a personal reason.\"\n\n\"Well, I can do that too!  I hate sailing under false colours.\nThe good folk of Chilmark; my own people; Bernard, Laura . . . .\"\nLawrence's eyes began to sparkle: when a man's voice deepens over\na woman's name--! \"Oh, I dare say nothing will ever come of it,\"\nVal resumed after a moment: \"my father may live another thirty\nyears, and by that time I should be too old to stand in a white\nsheet.  Or perhaps I shall only tell one or two people--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clowes?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"You would like to tell my cousin and his wife?\"\n\n\"I should like to feel myself a free agent, which I'm not now,\nbecause I'm under parole to you.\"\n\n\"And so you will remain,\" said Lawrence coldly.\n\n\"You mean that?\"\n\n\"Thoroughly.  I've no wish to distress you, Val, but I'm no more\nconvinced now than I was ten years ago that you can be trusted to\njudge for yourself.  You were an impulsive boy then with remarkably\nlittle self-control: you're--forgive my saying so--an impulsive man\nnow, capable of doing things that in five minutes you would be\nuncommonly sorry for.  How long would Bernard keep your secret?  If\nI'm not much mistaken you would lose your billet and the whole county\nwould hear why.  The whole thing's utter rubbish.  You make too much\nof your ribbon: you--I--it would never have been given if Dale's\nfather hadn't been a brass hat.\"\n\nStafford was ashy pale. \"I know you think you're just.\"\n\n\"No, I don't. I'm not just, my good chap: I'm weakly, idiotically\ngenerous.  In your heart of hearts you're grateful to me.  Now\nlet's drop all this.  Nothing you can say will have the slightest\neffect, so you may as well not say it.\" He stood by Val's chair,\nlaughing down at him and gently gripping him by the shoulder.\n\"Be a man, Val! you're not nineteen now.  You've got a comfortable\njob and the esteem of all who know you--take it and be thankful:\nit's more than you deserve.  If you must indulge in a hair shirt,\nwear it under your clothes.  It isn't necessary to embarrass other\npeople by undressing in public.\"\n\nThought is free: one may be at a man's mercy and in his debt and\nkeep one's own opinion of him, impersonal and cold.  With a faint\nsmile on his lips Val got up and strolled over to the piano.\n\"Hullo, what's all this music lying about?\" he said in his\nordinary manner.  \"Has Laura been playing?  Good, I'm so glad:\nBernard can hardly ever stand it.  See the first fruits of your\nbracing influence!  Oh, the Polonaises . . .\"  And then he in\nhis turn began to play, but not the melancholy fiery lyrics that\nhad soothed Laura's unsatisfied heart.  Val, a thorough musician,\nwent for sympathy to the classics.  Impulsive?  There was not\nmuch impulse left in this quiet, reticent man, who with his old\ntrouble fresh on him could sit down and play a chorale of Bach or\na prelude of Mozart, subordinating his own imperious anguish to\nthe grave universal daylight of the elder masters.  Long since\nVal had resolved that no shadow from him should fall across any\nother life.  He had foresworn \"that impure passion of remorse,\"\nand so keen an observer as Rowsley had grown up in his intimacy\nwithout suspecting anything wrong.  Unfortunately for Val,\nhowever, he still suffered, though he was now denied all\nexpression, all relief: the wounded mind bled inwardly.  It was\nno wonder Val's hair was turning grey.\n\nLawrence, no mean judge of music, understood much--not all--of\nthe significance of Val's playing.  He was an imaginative man--\nfar more so than Val, who would have lived an ordinary life and\ntravelled on ordinary lines of thought but for the war, which\nwrenched so many men out of their natural development.  But it\nwas again unfortunate for Val that the sporting instinct ran\nstrong in Captain Hyde.  He was irritated by Val's grave superior\ndignity, and deep and unacknowledged there was working in him the\ninstinct of the bully, the love of cruelty, overlaid by layer on\nlayer of civilization, of chivalry, of decency, yet native to the\nhuman heart and quick to reassert itself at any age: in the boy\nwho thrashes a smaller boy, in the young man who takes advantage\nof a woman, in the fighter who hounds down surrendered men.\n\nHe settled himself in a chair close to the piano. \"Val, I'm very\nglad to have met you.  Having taken so much upon me,\" he was\nsmiling into Val's eyes, \"I've often wondered what had become of\nyou.  This,\" he lightly touched Val's arm, \"was a cruel handicap.\nI had to disable you, but it need not have been permanent.\"\n\n\"Do you mind moving? you're in my light.\"\n\nHe shifted his chair by an inch or so.  \"After all, what's a single\nfailure of nerve?  Physical causes--wet, cold, indigestion, tight\nputtees--account for nine out of ten of these queer breakdowns.\nAt all events you've paid, Val, paid twice over: when I read your\nname in the Honours List I laughed, but I was sorry for you.  The\nsword-and-epaulets business would have been mild compared to that.\"\n\n\"Cat and mouse, is it?\" said Val, resting his hands on the keys.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to stand this sort of thing, Hyde, not for a\nminute.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Lawrence, reddening slowly to\nhis forehead.  But it was a lie: he was not one of those who can\noverstep limits with impunity.  The streak of vulgarity again!\nand worse than vulgarity: Andrew Hyde's sardonic old voice was\nringing in his ears, \"Lawrence, you'll never be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll leave it at that.  Only don't do it again.\"\nLawrence was dumb.  \"Here's Mrs. Clowes.\"\n\nVal rose as Laura came in, released at length from attendance on\nher husband. \"I heard you playing,\" she said, giving him her hand\nwith her sweet, friendly smile. \"So you've introduced yourself to\nCaptain Hyde?  I hope you were nice to him, for my gratitude to\nhim is boundless. I haven't seen Bernard looking so fit or so\nbright for months and months!  Now sit down, both of you, and\nwe'll have cigarettes and coffee.  Ring, Val, will you--? it's\nbarely half past ten.\n\n\"I can only stay for one cigarette, Laura: I must get home to\nbed.\"\n\n\"But, my dear boy, how tired you look!\" exclaimed Laura.  \"You do\ntoo much--I'm sure you do too much.  He wears himself out,\nLawrence--oh! my scarf!\" She was wearing a silver scarf over her\nblack dress, and as she moved it fluttered up and caught on the\nchain round her throat. \"Unfasten me, please, Val,\" she said,\nbending her fair neck, and Val was obliged laboriously to\ndisentangle the silken cobweb from the spurs of her clear-set\ndiamonds, a process which fascinated Lawrence, whose mind was\nmore French than English in its permanent interest in women.\nCertainly Val's office of friend of the family was not less\ndelicate because Laura, secure in her few years seniority,\ntreated him like a younger brother!  Watching, not Val, but Val's\nreflection in a mirror,  Lawrence overlooked no shade of\nconstraint, no effort that Val made to avoid touching with his\nfinger-tips the satin allure of Laura's exquisite skin.  \"Poor\nmiserable Val!\" Suspicion was crystallizing into certainty.  \"Or\nis it poor Bernard?   No, I swear she doesn't know.  Does he know\nhimself?\"\n\nA servant had brought in coffee, and Lawrence in his quality of\ncousin poured out two cups and carried them over to Laura and to\nVal.  \"Well, I'm damned!\" murmured Lawrence as Val refastened the\nclasp of the chain.  \"Picturesque, all this.--  Here, Val, here's\nyour coffee.\"\n\n\"But do you know each other so well as that?\" exclaimed Laura,\narching her wren's-feather eyebrows.\n\n\"I was an infant subaltern when Hyde knew me,\" said Val laughing,\n\"and he was a howling swell of a captain.  Do you remember that\nnight you all dined with us, sir, when we were in billets?  We\nstood you champagne--\"\n\n\"Purchased locally.  I remember the champagne.\"\n\n\"Dine with us tomorrow night,\" said Laura. \"Do! and bring\nIsabel.\" Lawrence gave an imperceptible start: for the last hour\nhe had forgotten Isabel's existence except when her eyes had\nlooked at him out of her brother's face.  \"The child will enjoy\nit, I never knew any one so easily pleased; and you and Lawrence\nand Bernard can rag one another to your heart's content.  Yes,\nyou will, I know you will, Army men always do when they get\ntogether; and you're all boys, even Bernard, even you with your\ngrey hair, my dear Val; as for Lawrence, he's only giving himself\nairs.\"\n\n\"Yes, do bring your sister,\" said Lawrence. \"She is the most\ncharming young girl I've met for years, if a man of my mature age\nmay say so.  She is so natural, a rare thing nowadays: the modern\njeune fille is a sophisticated product.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Lawrence!\" cried Mrs. Clowes, clapping her hands.  \"Now,\nVal, didn't I tell you Isabel was going to be very, very pretty?\nThat's settled, then, you'll both come: and, to please me,\" she\nlooked not much older than Isabel as she took hold of the lapel\nof Val's coat, \"will you wear your ribbon?  I know you hate\nwearing it in civilian kit!  But I do so love to see you in it:\nand it's not as if there would be any one here but ourselves.\"\n\nLawrence swung round on his heel and walked away.  One may enjoy\nthe pleasures of the chase and yet draw the line at watching an\napplication of the rack, and it sickened him to remember that his\nown hand had given a turn to the screw.  It had needed that brief\ncolloquy to let him see what Stafford's life was like at Wanhope,\nand in what slow nerve-by-nerve laceration amends were being\nmade.  He admired the gallantry of Stafford's reply.\n\n\"My dear Laura, I would tie myself up in ribbon from head to foot\nif it would give you pleasure.  I'll wear it if you like, though\nmy superior officer will certainly rag me if I do.\"\n\n\"No, I shan't,\" said Lawrence shortly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n\"And now tell me,\"  murmured Mrs. Clowes in the mischievously\ncaressing tone that she kept for Isabel, \"did mamma's little girl\nenjoy her party?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" said Isabel--with a great sigh, the satisfied sigh of\na dog curling up after a meal. \"They were lovely strawberries.\nAnd what do you call that French thing?  Oh, that's what a\nvol-au-vent is, is it?  I wish I knew how to make it, but probably\nit's one of those recipes that begin 'Take twelve eggs and a quart of\ncream.' I wish nice things to eat weren't so dear, Jimmy would love\nit.  Captain Hyde took two helps--did you see?--big ones!  If he\nalways eats as much as he did tonight he'll be fat before he's fifty,\nwhich will be a pity.  He ate three times what Val did.\"\n\n\"Is that what you were thinking of all the time?  I noticed you\ndidn't say very much.\"\n\n\"Well, I was between Captain Hyde and Major Clowes, and they\nneither of them think I'm grown up,\" explained Isabel.  \"They\ntalked to each other over the top of me.  Oh no, not rudely,\nMajor Clowes was as nice as he could be\" (Isabel salved her\nconscience by reflecting that this was verbally true since Major\nClowes could never he nice), \"and Captain Hyde asked me if I was\nfond of dolls--\"\n\n\"My dear Isabel!\"\n\n\"Or words to that effect.  Oh! it's perfectly fair, I'm not grown\nup, or only by fits and starts.  Some of me is a weary forty-five\nbut the rest is still in pigtails.  It's curious, isn't it?\nconsidering that I'm nearly twenty.  Let's go through the wood,\nmy stockings are coming down.\"  Out of sight of the house in a\nclearing of the loosely planted alder-coppice by the bridge, she\npulled them up, slowly and candidly: white cotton stockings\nsupported by garters of black elastic.  \"After all,\" she\ncontinued, \"I'm housekeeper, and in common politeness we shall\nhave to dine you back, so I really did want to see what sort of\nthings Captain Hyde likes.  But it's no use, he won't like\nanything we give him.  Not though we strain our resources to the\nuttermost. Laura! would Mrs. Fryar give me the receipt for that\nvol-au-vent? I don't suppose we could run to it, but I should\nlove to try.\"\n\n\"Mrs.  Fryar would be flattered,\" said Laura, finding a chair in\nthe forked stem of a wild apple-tree,  while Isabel sat plump\ndown on the net of moss-fronds and fine ivy and grey wood-violets\nat her feet.  \"But, my darling, you're not to worry your small\nhead over vol-au-vents!  Lawrence will like one of your own roast\nchickens just as well, or any simple thing--\"\n\n\"Oh no, Lawrence won't!\" Isabel gave a little laugh.  \"Excuse my\ncontradicting you, but Lawrence isn't a bit fond of simple\nthings.  That's why he doesn't like me, because I'm simple,\nsimple as a daisy.  I don't mind--much,\" she added truthfully.\n\"I can survive his most extended want of interest.  After all\nwhat can you expect if you go out to dinner in the same nun's\nveiling frock you wore when you were confirmed, with the tucks\nlet down and the collar taken out?  O! Laura,  I wish someone\nwould give me twenty pounds on condition that I spent it all on\ndress!  I'd buy--I'd buy--oh,--silk stockings, and long\ngloves, and French cambric underclothes, and chiffon nightgowns\nlike those Yvonne wears (but they aren't decent: still that\ndoesn't matter so long as you're not married, and they are so\npretty)!  And a homespun tailor-made suit with a seam down the\nback and open tails: and--and--one of those real Panamas that\nyou can pull through a wedding ring: and--oh! dear, I am greedy!\nIt must be because I never have any clothes at all that I'm\nalways wanting some. I ache all over when I look at catalogues.\nIsn't it silly?\"\n\nIf so it was a form of silliness with which Mrs. Clowes was in\nfull sympathy.  In her world, to be young and pretty gave a woman\na claim on Fate to provide her with pretty dresses and the\nadmiration of men.  As for Yvonne, till she married Jack Bendish\nshe had never been out of debt in her life.  \"No, it's the most\nnatural thing on earth,\" said Laura.  \"How I wish--!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Isabel hastily.  \"It's very, very sweet of you,\nbut even Jimmy wouldn't like it: and as for Val I don't know what\nhe'd say!  Poor old Val, he wants some new evening clothes\nhimself, and it's worse for him than for me because men do so\nhate to look shabby and out at elbows.  He's worn that suit for\nten years.  My one consolation is that Captain Hyde couldn't wear\na suit he wore ten years ago.  It would burst.\"\n\n\"Isabel!  really!  you ridiculous child, why have you such a\nspite against poor Lawrence?  Any one would think he was a\nperfect Daniel Lambert!  Do you know he's a pukka sportsman and\nhas shot all over the world?  Lions and tigers, and rhinoceros,\nand grizzly bears, and all sorts of ferocious animals!  He's\npromised me a black panther skin for my parlour and he's\npersuaded Bernard to call in Dr. Verney for his neuritis, so I\nwon't hear another word against him!\"\n\n\"Has he?  H'm. . . . No, I haven't any prejudice against him: in\nfact I like him,\" said Isabel, smiling to herself.  \"But he\nreminds me of Tom Wallis at the Prince of Wales's Feathers.  Do\nyou remember Tom?   'Poor Tom,' Mrs. Wallis always says, 'he went\nfrom bad to worse.  First it was a drop too much of an evening:\nand then he began getting drunk mornings: and then he 'listed for\na soldier!' Not that Captain Hyde would get drunk, but he has the\nsame excitable temperament. . . .  Laura!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Mrs. Clowes, framing the young face between\nher hands as Isabel rose up kneeling before her.  In the\nquivering apple-tree shadow Isabel's eyes were very dark, and\npenetrating and reflective too, as if she had just undergone one\nof those transitions from childhood to womanhood which are the\nmark and the charm of her variable age.  Laura was puzzled by her\njudgment of Lawrence Hyde, so keen, yet so wide of the truth as\nLaura saw it: \"excitable\" was the last thing that Laura would\nhave called him, and she couldn't see any likeness to Tom Wallis.\nBut one can't argue over a man's character with a child. \"Why so\nserious?\"\n\n\"This evening, at dinner, weren't there some queer\nundercurrents?\"\n\n\"Undercurrents!\" Laura drew her hands away. She looked startled\nand nervous.  \"What sort of undercurrents?\"\n\n\"When they were chaffing Val about his ribbon. Oh, I don't know,\"\nsaid Isabel vaguely.  Laura drew a breath of relief. \"I was sorry\nyou made him wear it.  But he'd cut his hand off to please you,\ndarling.  You don't really realize the way you can make Val do\nanything you like.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Laura, but with an indulgent smile, which was\nher way of saying that it was true but did not signify.  She was\nno coquette, but she preferred to create an agreeable impression.\nAlways in France, where women are the focus of social interest,\nthere had been men who did as Laura Selincourt pleased, and the\nincense which Val alone continued to burn was not ungrateful to\nher altar.  \"As if Val would mind about a little thing like\nthat.\"\n\nIsabel shook her head.  \"Perhaps you weren't attending.  Major\nClowes was very down on him for wearing it--chaffing him, of\ncourse, but chaffing half in earnest: a snowball with a stone in\nit.  Naturally Val wasn't going to say you made him--\"\n\n\"No, but Lawrence did: or I should have cut in myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, after a minute, he interfered, and then Major Clowes shut\nup, but it was all rather--rather queer, and I'm sure Val hated\nit.  You won't make him do it again, will you?  Val's so odd.\nLaura--don't tell any one--I sometimes think Val's very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Val, unhappy?  You fanciful child, this is worse than Tom\nWallis! What should make Val unhappy?  He might be dull,\" said\nLaura ruefully.  \"Life at Wanhope isn't exciting!  But he's keen\non his work and very fond of the country.  Val is one of the most\ncontented people I know.\"\n\nA shadow fell over Isabel's face, the veil that one draws down\nwhen one has offered a confidence to hands that are not ready to\nreceive it.  \"Then it must be all my imagination.\" She abandoned\nthe subject as rapidly as she had introduced it. \"O! dear, I am\nsleepy.\" She stretched herself and yawned, opening her mouth wide\nand shutting it with a little snap like a kitten.  \"I was up at\nsix to give Val his breakfast, and I've been running about all\nday, what with the school treat next week, and Jimmy's new\nnight-shirts that I had to get the stuff for and cut them out,\nand choir practice, and Fanny taking it into her head to make\nrhubarb jam.  How can London people stay up till twelve or one\no'clock every night?  But of course they don't get up at six.\"\n\n\"Have a snooze in my hammock,\" suggested Laura. \"I see Barry\ncoming, which means that Bernard is going off and I shall have to\nrun away and leave you, and probably the men won't come out for\nsome time.  Take forty winks, you poor child, it will freshen you\nup.\"\n\n\"I never, never go to sleep in the daytime,\" said Isabel firmly.\n\"It's a demoralizing habit.  But I shouldn't mind tumbling into\nyour hammock, thank you very much.\" And, while Mrs. Clowes went\naway with Barry, she slipped across to Laura's large comfortable\ncot, swung waist-high between two alders that knelt on the river\nbrink.\n\nIsabel sprawled luxuriously at full length, one arm under her\nhead and the other dropped over the netting: her young frame was\ntired, little flying aches of fatigue were darting pins and\nneedles through her knees and shoulders and the base of her\nspine.  The evening was very warm and the stars winked at her,\nthey were green diamonds that sparkled through chinks in the\nalder leafage overhead: round dark leaves like coins, and\nscattered in clusters, like branches of black bloom.  Near at\nhand the river ran in silken blackness, but below the coppice,\nwhere it widened into shallows, it went whispering and rippling\nover a pebbly bottom on its way to the humming thunder of the\nmill.  And in a fir-tree not far off a nightingale was singing,\nnow a string of pearls dropping bead by bead from his throat, now\nrich turns and grace-notes, and now again a reiterated metallic\nchink which melted into liquid fluting:\n\n              Vogek im Tannenwald\n              Pfeifet so hell:\n              Pfeifet de Wald aus und ein,\n         wo wird mein Schatze sein?\n         Vogele im Tannenwald pfeifet so hell.\n\nIsabel was still so young that she felt the beauty more deeply\nwhen she could link it with some poetic association, and as she\nlistened to the nightingale she murmured to herself \"'In some\nmelodious plot of beechen green with shadows numberless'--but\nit isn't a beech, it's a fir-tree,\" and then wandering off into\nanother literary channel, \"'How thick the bursts come crowding\nthrough the leaves!  Eternal passion--eternal pain' . . . but I\ndon't believe he feels any pain at all.  It is we who feel pain.\nHe's not been long married, and it's lovely weather, and there's\nplenty for them to eat, and they're in love . . . what a heavenly\nnight it is!  I wish some one were in love with me.  I wonder if\nany one ever will be.\n\n\"How thrilling it would be to refuse him!  Of course I couldn't\npossibly accept him--not the first: it would be too slow,\nbecause then one couldn't have any more.  One would be like\nLaura.  Poor Laura!  Now if she were in that tree\"--Isabel's\nideas were becoming slightly confused--\"it would be natural for\nher to be melancholy--only if she were a bird she wouldn't care,\nshe would fly off with some one else and leave Major Clowes, and\nall the other birds would come and peck him to death.  They\nmanage these things better in bird land.\"  Isabel's eyes shut but\nshe hurriedly opened them again.  \"I'm not going to go to sleep.\nIt's perfectly absurd.  It can't be much after nine o'clock.  I\ndare say Captain Hyde will come out before so very long . . . I\nshould like to talk to him again by myself.  He isn't so\ninteresting when other people are there. I wonder why I told\nLaura he was getting fat?  He isn't: he couldn't be, to travel\nall over the world and shoot black panthers.  And if he did take\ntwo helps of vol-au-vent, you must remember, Isabel, he's a big\nman--well over six feet--and requires good support.  He\ncertainly is not greedy or he would have tried to pick out the\noysters: all men love oysters.\n\n\"He was nice about Val's ribbon, too . . . wish I understood\nabout that ribbon.  Val was grateful: he said 'Thanks, Hyde'\nwhile Major Clowes was speaking to Barry.  Laura isn't stupid,\nbut she never understands Val.  'Contented?' My dearest darling\nVal!  If he were being roasted over a slow fire he would be\n'contented' if Laura was looking on.  That's the worst of being\nperfectly unselfish: people never realize that you're unselfish\nat all.  Wives don't seem to hear what their husbands say.  Often\nand often Major Clowes is absolutely insulting to Val, before\nLaura and before me.  But Laura always looks on Val as a boy.\nPerhaps if Captain Hyde hears it going on he'll interfere and\nshut Major Clowes up as he did tonight.  He can manage Major\nClowes . . . which is clever of him! 'A strong, silent man'--as\na matter of fact he talks a good deal. . . . But I loved him for\nsitting on Major Clowes.  I'd rather he were nice to Val than to\nme.\n\n\"But he might be nice to me too. . . .\n\n\"He was, yesterday afternoon.  How he coloured up! He was\nabsolutely natural for the minute.  That can't often happen.\nPeople who don't like giving themselves away are thrilling when\nthey do.\"\n\nAnother yawn came upon her.\n\n\"O! dear, I really mustn't go to sleep.  What a lulling noise you\nmake, you old river!  I don't think I can get up at six tomorrow.\nThis hammock is as comfortable as a bed.  'The young girl\nreclined in a graceful attitude, her head pillowed on her slender\nhand, her long dark lashes entangled and resting on her ivory\ncheek.' Well, they couldn't rest anywhere else: unless they were\nlong enough to rest on her nose. 'Her--her breathing  was soft\nand regular . . .'\"  It became so.  Isabel slept.\n\nVal would rather have owed no gratitude to a man he disliked so\nmuch as Hyde.  When Bernard was wheeled away, an interchange of\nperfunctory civilities was followed by a constrained silence,\nwhich Val broke by rising.  \"Hyde, if you'll excuse me, I'll say\nfive words to Bernard before Barry begins getting him to bed.\nThere's a right of way dispute going on that he liked me to keep\nhim posted up in.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said Lawrence vaguely. He brushed past Val and escaped into\nthe garden.\n\nLawrence was enjoying his stay at Wanhope, but tonight he felt\ndefrauded, though he knew not why.  He had had an agreeable day.\nIn the morning Jack Bendish had appeared on horseback and Lawrence\nhad ridden over with him to lunch at Wharton, a sufficiently amusing\nexperience, what with the crabbed high-spirited whims of Jack's\ngrandfather and the old-fashioned courtesy of Lord Grantchester, and\nYvonne's romantic toilette: later Laura had joined them and they had\nplayed bowls on the famous green: in the cool of the evening he had\nstrolled home with Laura through the fields.  Dinner too had been\namusing in its way, the wines were excellent, the parlour maid waited\nat table like a deft ghost, and he recognized in Mrs. Fryar an artist\nwho was thrown away alike on Bernard's devotion to roast beef and\nVal's inability to remember what he ate.  Yet Lawrence was left\nvaguely discontented.\n\nBernard's manner to Val had set his teeth on edge.  Bernard could\nhave meant no harm: no one had ever known the truth except\nLawrence and Val, and possibly Dale with such torn shreds of\nconsciousness as H. E. and barbed wire had left him: but in all\ninnocence Bernard had set the rack to work as deftly as Lawrence\ncould have done it himself.  Lawrence pitied--no, that was a\nslip of the mind: he was not so weak as to pity Stafford, but\ntheir intercourse was difficult, genant.\n\nAnd Isabel Stafford too: Clowes had left her out of the\nconversation as though she were a child, and though Lawrence\ntried to bring her in she remained, so to say, in the nursery\nmost of the time, speaking when she was spoken to but without any\nof her characteristic freshness and boldness.  She was the\nschoolgirl that Clowes expected her to be.  Her very dress\nirritated Lawrence, as if he had seen a fine painting in a tawdry\nframe, or a pearl of price foiled by a spurious setting.  He had\nnot felt any glow at all, and was left to suppose his fancy had\nplayed him a trick.  Disappointing! and now there was no chance\nof revising his impression, for apparently she had gone away with\nLaura--who should have known better than to leave Captain Hyde\nto his own devices.  But probably Miss Stafford had refused to\nface the men alone: it was what a little shy country girl would\ndo.\n\nIsabel's arm hanging over the edge of the hammock, and pearly\nwhite in the dark, was his first warning of her presence.  He\ncrossed the wood with his hunter's step and found her lapped in\ndreams, the starlight that filtered between the alder branches\nchequering her with a faint diaper of light and shade.  Only the\nvery young can afford to be, seen asleep, when the face sinks\nback into its original repose, and lines and wrinkles reappear in\nthe loss of all that smiling charm of expression which may efface\nthem by day.  Laura, asleep, looked old and haggard.  But Isabel\npresented a blank page, a face virginally pure, and candid, and\nlineless: from the attitude of her young body one would have\nthought she was constructed without bones, and from her serenity\nit might have been a child who slept there in the June night, so\nplacidly entrusting herself to its mild embrace.  Vividly aware\nthat he had no right to watch her, Lawrence stood watching her,\nthough afraid at every breath that she would wake up: it was hard\nto believe that even in her sleep she could remain insensible of\nhis eyes.  Here was the authentic Isabel, the girl who had\nenchanted him on the moor: the incarnation of that classic beauty\nby which alone his spirit was capable of being touched to fine\nissues.  The alder branches quivered, their clusters of black\nshadow fell like an embroidered veil over the imperfections of\nher dress, but what light there was shone clear on her head and\nthroat, and the pearly moulding of her shoulder, based where her\nsleeve was dragged down a little by the tension of her weight\nupon it.  All the mystery of womanhood and all its promise of\nlife in bud and life not yet sown lay on this young girl asleep\nin the starshine.  Lights flashed up in the house, figures were\nmoving between the curtains: Laura had left Bernard, soon she\nwould come out into the garden and call to Isabel, and Isabel\nwould wake and his chance be lost.  His chance?  Isabel had\nrashly incurred a forfeit and would have to pay.  The frolic was\nold, there was plenty of precedent for it, and not for one moment\ndid Lawrence dream of letting her off.  A moth, a dead leaf might\nhave settled on her sleeping lips and she would have been none\nthe wiser, and just such a moth's touch he promised himself, the\ncontact of a moment, but enough to intoxicate him with its\nsweetness, and the first--yes, he believed it would be the\nfirst: not from any special faith in Isabel's obduracy, but\nbecause no one in Chilmark was enough of a connoisseur to\nappreciate her.  Yes, the first, the bloom on the fruit, the\nunfolding of the bud, he promised himself that: and warily he\nstooped over Isabel, who slept as tranquil as though she were in\nher own room under the vicarage eaves.  Lawrence held his breath.\nIf she were to wake?  Then?--Oh, then the middleaged friend of\nthe family claiming his gloves and his jest!  But Lawrence was\nnot feeling middle-aged.\n\n\"O! dear,\" said Isabel, \"I've been asleep!\"\n\nShe sat up rubbing her eyes.  \"Laura, are you there?\" But no one\nwas there.  Yet, though she was alone, in the solitude of the\nalder shade Isabel blushed scarlet.  \"What a ridiculous dream!\nworse than ridiculous, What would Val say if he knew?  Really,\nIsabel, you ought to be whipped!\" She slipped to her feet and\npeered suspiciously this way and that into the shadowy corners of\nthe wood.  Not a step: not the rustle of a leaf: no one.\n\nYet Isabel's cheeks continued to burn, till with a little\nfrightened laugh she buried them in her hands. \"O! it was--\nit was a dream--?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nLawrence's reflections when he went to bed that night were more\ninsurgent and disorderly than usual.  In his negative philosophy,\nwhen he shut the door of his room, it was his custom to shut the\ndoor on memory too--to empty his mind of all its contents except\nthe physical disposition to sleep.  He cultivated an Indian's\nself-involved and deliberate vacancy.  On this his second night\nat Wanhope however--Wanhope which was to bring him a good many\nwhite nights before he was done with it--he lay long awake,\nwatching the stars that winked and glittered in the field of his\nopen window, the same stars that were perhaps shining on Isabel's\npillow. . . .\n\nIsabel: it was on her that his thoughts ran with a tiring\npersistency against which his common sense rebelled.  A kiss!\nwhat was it after all?  A Christmas forfeit, a prank of which\neven Val Stafford could have said no worse than that it was\nbeneath the dignity of his six and thirty years:  only too\nflattering for such a little country girl, sunburnt, simple, and\noccasionally tongue-tied.  The lady of the ivory frame (whom\nLawrence had fished out of her seclusion and set up on his\ndressing table, to the disgust of Caroline: who was a Baptist,\nand didn't care to dust a person who wore so few clothes), the\nlady of the ivory frame was far handsomer than Isabel, or at\nleast handsome in a far more finished style.\n\nLawrence had the curiosity to get out of bed and carry Mrs. Cleve\nto the window.  Yes, she certainly was an expensive luxury, this\nsmiling lady, her eyes large and liquid, her waved hair rippling\nunder its diamond aigrette, her rather wide, eighteenth century\nshoulders dimpling down under a collar of diamonds to the half\nbare swell of her breast: and for an amateur of her type she was\ncharming, with her tired, sophisticated glance and her fresh\nmouth, like a rouged child: but it was borne in on Lawrence that\nshe was not for him.  He had kissed her two or three times, as\noccasion served and she seemed to desire it, but he had never\nlain awake afterwards, nor had his heart beaten any faster, no,\nnot even in the summerhouse at Bingley when she was fairly in his\narms.  He pitched the photograph into a drawer.  Frederick Cleve\nwas safe, for him.\n\nStrolling out on the balcony,  Lawrence folded his arms on the\nbalustrade.  The night was hot: perhaps that was why he could not\nsleep.  By his watch it was ten minutes past two.  The moon was\nnear her setting.    She lay on her back with tumbled clouds all\nround her: mother & pearl clouds, quilted, and tinged with a\nsheen of opal.  He wondered whether Bernard was asleep: poor\nBernard, lying alone through the dreary hours.   Perhaps it was\nbecause Lawrence was not at all like a curate that Bernard had\nalready made his cousin free of certain dark corners which Val\nhad never been allowed to explore.  \"My wife?  She's not my\nwife,\" Clowes had said, staring up at Lawrence with his wide\nblack eyes.  \"She's my nurse.\"  And he went on defining the\nsituation with the large coarse frankness which he permitted\nhimself since his accident, and which did not repel Lawrence, as\nit would have repelled Val or Jack Bendish, because Lawrence\nhabitually used the same frankness in his own mind.  There was\nsome family likeness between the cousins, and it came out in\ntheir common contempt for modern delicacy, which Bernard called\nsqueamishness and Lawrence damned in more literary language as\nthe Victorian manner.\n\nThe moon dipped lower over the trees while Lawrence took one of\nhis sharp turns of self-analysis.  Most men live in a haze, but\nLawrence was naturally a clear thinker, and he had neither a warm\nheart nor a sentimental temperament to blind him.  Cleve was\nsafe: but with his Rabelaisian candour and cultivated want of\nscruple Lawrence reflected that Cleve had been anything but safe\nat Bingley.  Whence the change?  From Isabel Stafford!  Lawrence\nshrugged his shoulders: he was accustomed to examine himself in a\ndry light of curiosity, and no vice or weakness shocked him,  but\nhere was pure folly.\n\nWhat was he doing at Wanhope?  \"I'm contracting attachments,\" he\nreflected, unbuttoning his silk jacket to feel the night air cool\non his chest, a characteristic action: wind, sunshine, a\nwandering scent,  the freshness of dew, all the small sensuous\npleasures that most men neglect, Lawrence would go out of his way\nto procure.   \"I'm breaking my rule.\" Long ago he had resolved\nnever to let himself get fond of any one again, because in this\nworld of chance and change, at the mercy of a blindly striking\npower, the game is not worth the candle: one suffers too much.\n\nAs for Miss Stafford, one need not be a professed stole to draw\nthe line at a little country girl, pious to insipidity and simple\nto the brink of silliness.  Here Lawrence, not being one of those\nwho deny facts when they are unwelcome, caught himself up: she\nwas not insipid and her power over him was undeniable.  Twice\nwithin forty-eight hours she had defeated his will, and what was\nstranger was that each time he had surrendered eagerly, feeling\nfor the moment as though it didn't matter what he said or did\nbefore Isabel.--It was at this point of his analysis that Lawrence\nbegan to take fright.  \"You rascal,\" he said to himself, \"so that's\nwhy you're off Mrs. Cleve, is it?  What is it you want--to marry the\nchild?  You would be sick to death of her in six weeks--and haven't\nyou had enough of giving hostages to Fortune?\"\n\nHostages to fortune: that pregnant phrase frightens men who fear\nnothing else in heaven or earth.  But not one of Hyde's friends\nknew that he had ever given fortune a hostage.  He was not\nreserved as a rule: indeed he was always willing to argue creed\nand code with a frankness rare in the self-conscious English\nrace: he was never shy and there was little in him that was\ndistinctively English.  But he was too subtle and inconsistent\nfor the average homogeneous Englishman, and not even the comrades\nof trench and tent knew much about his private life.  Lawrence\nwas one of those products of a high civilization which have in\nthem pretty strong affinities with barbarism,--but always with a\ndifference.  The noble savage tortures his enemy out of hate or\nrevenge: Lawrence, more sophisticated in brutality, was capable\nof doing it by way of a psychological experiment.  The savage\ntakes a short cut from desire to possession:  Lawrence though his\nblood ran hot curbed it from caution, because in modern life\nwomen are a burden and a drag.\n\nThis was the trained and tempered Lawrence Hyde, a personage of\ngreat good humour and numitigable egoism.  This was the companion\nof easy morals with whom Lawrence was on familiar terms.  But on\nthat first white night at Wanhope Lawrence grew dimly aware of\nthe upheaval of deeper forces, as if his youth were stirring in\nits grave.  When Laura Clowes smiled at him with her gallant\nbearing: when Bernard gripped his hand in wishing him good night:\nwhen Val in the middle of the psychological experiment pierced\nhim with his grave tired eyes, all sorts of feelings long dormant\nand believed to be dead came to life in Lawrence: pity, and\naffection, and remorse and shame.  \"Hang the fellow!\" Lawrence\nreflected.  \"He's too like his sister.  And Isabel?  She is a\nchild.\"  Whose voice was it that answered, \"This is the woman I\nhave been waiting for all my life?\"\n\nAnd then, turning at bay, he came to a sufficiently cynical\nconclusion.  \"No nonsense!\" he said to himself.  \"Your trouble is\nthat she's twenty and you're six and thirty, which is a dangerous\nage.  But you don't want to marry her, and there's no middle\ncourse.  Fruit defendu, mon ami: hands off!  If you can't be\nsensible you'll have to shift out of Wanhope and compromise on\nMrs. Cleve.\"\n\nThe rain held off, and after breakfast--a cheery meal at which\nBernard for the first time for many months appeared dressed and\nin a good temper--Lawrence fulfilled the main duty of a guest by\ngoing for a walk.\n\nHe came by footbridge and field path into the High Street, where\nhe was immediately buttonholed by the vicar.  Lawrence had a\nfixed idea that all priests were hypocrites: they must be, since\nas educated men they could not well believe the fables they were\npaid to teach!  But it was hard to associate hypocrisy with Mr.\nStafford, whose fond ambition it was to nail Lawrence Hyde to\nlecture on his Chinese travels before the Bible Class.  \"Oh, nothing\nreligious,\" he explained, holding his victim firmly by the coat as\nLawrence edged away.  \"Only half an hour's story-telling to put a few\nnew ideas into their heads--as if you were talking to a young brother\nof your own.  I'm always trying to get them to emigrate, but they\nneed a great deal of shoving.\"  Lawrence said they could not emigrate\nto China, and, further, that he didn't regard them as brothers.  \"How\nnarrow you are, some of you University men!\" sighed Mr. Stafford.\n\"What a concept of society!  But,\" brightening, \"you're not so bad as\nyou're painted.  Come, come! a fifth-of-August recruit can't very\nwell deny that we're all brothers in arms?\" Before Lawrence escaped\nhe was not sure that he hadn't pledged himself to an address on\n\"Fringes of the Empire,\" with special reference to the C.U.M.C.A.\n\nIt was too sunny to fish, but the trout lured him, and from the\ncross-roads by the stone bridge he struck into a footpath that\nled upstream into the hills, behind whose green spurs Chilmark\nbefore long was out of sight.  Here it was lonely country.\nSometimes on a headland the sun flashed white over a knot of\nlabourers, scything the hay where no machine could go: sometimes\na shepherd's cote gleamed far off above the pale wattlings of a\nfold:  but as he wound on--and on into the Plain there was no\nsign of man in all the hot landscape, and no motion but the\nbicker of the stream over its stony bed, and the hum of insect\nlife busy on its millions of dark and tiny vibrant wings.  Not a\nbreath of wind stirred among these grassy valleys, and Lawrence,\nfeeling warm, had sat down by a pool under a sapling birchtree,\nwhen he heard a step on the path.  It was Isabel Stafford.\n\nHe had hardly seen her again overnight, for Val had carried his\nyoung sister away before ten o'clock.  He waited for her in the\nrare shadow of the birchtree, a tall powerful figure in a white\ndrill suit of the tropics, his fair skin and black eyes shaded by\na wide Panama hat.  Isabel as she drew near was vexed to find\nherself blushing.  She was a little shy of Captain Hyde, a little\naverse to meet his sparkling eyes.\n\n\"Isn't it hot?\" she said, frankly wiping her face with a large\nhandkerchief.  \"This is a favourite pool of mine, I often sit\nhere when I come this way.  I never saw such beautiful dragonflies,\ndid you?  They must be nearly as big as hummingbirds.\"\n\nOver the brown mirror of the pool a troop of great dragonflies\nwere ceaselessly darting to and fro, their metallic wings making\na faint whirr as they looped in blinding mazes through the air\nthat glowed blue with their splendour.  \"Very beautiful,\" said\nLawrence.\n\n\"Are you out for a walk?  I'm on my way to Wancote.\" Here panic\nfell on Isabel, the panic that lies in wait for young girls: if\nhe were to think she thought he ought to offer to escort her!\n\"I'm late, I must go on now.  Good-bye!\"\n\nLawrence stood looking down at her, impassive, almost sombre, but\nfor the hot glow in his eyes.  His caution had gone overboard.\n\"Mayn't I come too?\"\n\n\"Oh. . . .\"\n\n\"Do let me.\"\n\n\"If you--if you like.\"\n\nThe valley narrowed as it receded, the upland air began to\nsparkle with a myriad prismatic needles that glittered from the\nwings of flies and beetles, and from dewdrops on patches of turf\nstill as grey as hoarfrost in the shadow on the edge of a wood,\nand from wayside hollies whose leaf-points were all starred in\nsilver.  The blue bow overhead was stainless, not a cloud in it\nnor a mist: azure, azure, and unfathomable, like the heart of\nman, or the justice of God.--Isabel was not shy now but alert\nand radiant, as if she had caught a sparkle from the air: and\nexpansive, as women are when they are sure of pleasing.  \"'For\nthe jaded man of the world at her side, the young girl's rustic\nfreshness was her chief charm.  She was so different from the\nbeautiful but heartless mondaines he had known in Town.  No\ndiamonds glittered round her slender throat, and her hands,\nthough small and well-shaped, were tanned by the summer sun.  But\nfor the jaded-man-of-the-world, weary of sparkling epigram or\ncaustic repartee, her simple chatter held a fascination of its\nown.' I don't believe,\" reflected Isabel, coming down mentally to\nplain prose, \"he'd mind if I talked to him about the dinner or\nlast week's washing bill.\"\n\nShe did not in fact enter on any such intimate topic, but\nconversed sedately about parish politics and the beauties of the\nPlain.  \"This is a very lonely part,\" she said, \"there are\nscarcely any houses.  I'm taking the magazine to one of Major\nClowes' shepherds.  It's rather interesting going there.  He's\nmad.\"\n\n\"Mad!\"\n\n\"As a March hare.  He's perfectly harmless of course, and an\nexcellent shepherd.  In lambing time he looks after the ewes like\na mother, Val says his flock hardly ever lose a lamb.  But he's a\nthrilling person to district-visit.  Last time I went he had the\nPrince of Wales staying with him.\"\n\n\"Why on earth don't they put him in an asylum?\"\n\n\"Do you know much about country villages?\" Isabel enquired.  \"I\nthought not.  They never put any one in an asylum till after he's\ngot into trouble, and not always then if he doesn't want to go:\njust as they never build a bridge over a level crossing till one\nor two people have been killed.  We had a woman in Chilmark that\nwas much madder than poor dear Ben is.  She took a knife out of\nher drawer once when I was there and told me she was going to cut\nher throat with it.  She made me feel the edge to see how sharp\nit was.  At last she cut the children's throats instead of her\nown, and then they put her away, but none of them died and she's\nout again now. She's supposed to be cured.  You see a County\nasylum doesn't keep people longer than it must because the money\ncomes out of the rates.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" Lawrence fastened on the point that struck\nhim most forcibly, \"that your father lets you go to such places\nby yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh yes: why not?  He would think it showed want of faith to\nprevent me.  He's very sensible about things like that,\" said\nIsabel without affectation.  \"There are always typhoid and\ndiphtheria about in the autumn, but Jimmy never fusses.  It\nwouldn't be much use if he did, with him and Val always in and\nout of infected houses.\"\n\n\"Pure fatalism--\" said Lawrence, hitting with his stick at the\nflowers by their path.  \"Your brother ought to put his foot\ndown--\" Isabel seized his arm.\n\n\"Take care!--  There was a bee in it.  You really are most\ncareless Captain Hyde! I shan't take you for any more walks if\nyou do that.  I dare say it was one of my own bees, and he had\nthe very narrowest escape!  And Val wouldn't dream of interfering.\nBen and I are the best of friends.  Besides, it's Mrs. Janaway I\nreally go to see, poor dear,  she don't ever hear a bit o' news from\nweek's end to week's end.  Wouldn't you be glad to see me,\" her eyes\nwere destitute of challenge but not of humour, \"if you lived three\nmiles deep in the Plain, alone with your husband and the Prince of\nWales?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted to see you at any time.\"\n\nIsabel, not knowing what to do with this speech, let it alone.\n\"And the dog: I mustn't forget the dog.  They have a thoroughbred\nGreat Dane.  Mr. Bendish gave Ben the puppy because it was the\nworst of the litter and they thought it would die: but it didn't\ndie--no animal does that Ben gets hold of--and he's too fond of\nit now to part with it, though a dog fancier from Amesbury has\noffered him practically his own price for it.\"\n\n\"I should like to see the Dane.\"\n\n\"Well, you will, if you come with me.  There's the cottage.\"\n\nThey had turned a bend and the head of the dale lay before them,\na mere dimpling depression between breasts of chalky grass.  Set\nclose by the way on a cross-track, which forded the brook by\nstepping stones and went on over the downs to Amesbury, stood a\nsmall, square, tumbledown cottage, its door opening on primeval\nturf, though behind it a plot of garden enclosed in a quickset\nhedge provided Mrs. Janaway with cabbages and gooseberries and\nsour apples and room to hang out the clothes.\n\n\"Ben won't be in, but Billy will be looking after Clara.  Billy\nis no good with the sheep, but he's death on tramps.  In fact if\nI weren't here it wouldn't be too safe for you to go to the door.\nA Dane can pull any man down: I've heard even Jack Bendish say he\nwouldn't care to tackle him--\"\n\nEven Jack Bendish!  Lawrence smiled.  He felt the prick of\nIsabel's blade, it amused him, automatically he reacted to it,\nshe made him want to fight the Dane first and Jack Bendish\nafterwards--but he retained just too much of the ascendancy of\nhis six and thirty years to gratify her by self-betrayal.\n\"You're a very brave young lady,\" he said cheerfully, \"but if I\nwere Val--\"\n\nHe stopped short.  From the cottage window,  now not twenty yards\noff, there had come a burst of the most appalling screams he had\never heard in his life, the mechanical screaming of mortal agony.\nIsabel went as white as chalk and even Hyde felt the blood turn\ncold at his heart.  Next moment the door was torn open and out of\nit came a big red-bearded man, dressed in a brown tweed jacket\nand velveteen trousers tied at the knees, and prancing high in a\nsolemn jig.  In one hand he held up an iron stake and in the\nother a rag of red and black carpet . . . the body of a woman in\na black dress, her arms and legs hanging down, her face a scarlet\nmask that had ceased to scream.\n\n\"Keep back, Isabel,\" said Lawrence: then, running across the\nturf, \"Drop that, Janaway! drop her!\" in the hard authoritative\nvoice of the barrack square.  With the fitful docility of the\nmad, Janaway obeyed, and directly he did so Lawrence checked and\nstood on the defensive, taking a moment to collect his wits--he\nhad need of them:  he had to make his head guard his hands.  He\nwas a tall powerful man, but so was the shepherd: to offset\nHyde's science, Janaway was mad and would be stopped by no\npunishment short of a knock-out blow: and Lawrence carried only\nan ordinary walking-stick, while Janaway had hold of an upright\nfrom a bit of iron railing, five feet long and barbed like a\nspear.\n\n\"If he whacks me over the head with that or jabs it into my\nstomach, I'm done,\" Lawrence thought, and pat to the moment\nJanaway, his mouth open and his teeth bare, rushed on him and\nstruck at his eyes.  Lawrence parried and sprang aside: but his\narm was jarred to the elbow.  \"That was a close call.  Ha! my\nchance now . . .\"  Like a flash, as Janaway turned, Lawrence\nran in to meet him body to body, seized him by the lapels of his\ncoat, pinned down his arms, set one foot against his thigh, and\nwith no great exertion of strength, by the Samurai's trick of\nfalling with one's enemy, heaved him up and shot him clean over\nhis own shoulder: then, as they dropped together, struck with his\nwrist a paralysing blow at the base of the spine.  Janaway's yell\nof fury was choked into a rattling groan.\n\nLawrence was up in a twinkling, but the shepherd lay where he had\nfallen, and Lawrence let him lie: he knew that, so handled, the\nvictim could be counted out of action, perhaps for good and all.\nHe stood erect, breathing deep.  Ben could wait, but what of Mrs.\nBen?  He was shocked to find Isabel already at her side on the\nreddened turf.\n\nMechanically Lawrence picked up his stick before he went to join\nher. Clara was huddled up over a pool of blood, her head between\nher knees: not a pleasant sight for a young girl.  But Isabel,\nthough white and trembling, was collected.  \"I can't feel her\nheart, I--I'm afraid--\"\n\nShe broke off.  Her glance had travelled beyond Lawrence and her\nfeatures were stiffening into a mask of fear.  \"Oh, the dog, the\ndog!\"  she pointed past him.  \"Billy, Billy, down, sir!\"\n\nFrom some eyrie on the hillside the Dane had watched without\nemotion the legitimate spectacle of his master beating his\nmistress: in the war of the sexes, a dog is ever on the man's\nside.  But when the tables were turned Billy went to the rescue.\nHe was coming round the corner of the cottage when Isabel caught\nsight of him, travelling in great bounds at the pace of a wolf,\nbut silent.  Lawrence had but just time to swing Isabel behind\nhim before the Dane leapt for his throat.  Lawrence struck him\nover the head, but the blow glanced: so sudden, so thundering\ncame the impact that Lawrence all but went down under it: and\nonce down. . . .\n\nThe great jaws snapped one inch from his cheek, and before the\nDane could recover Lawrence had seized him by the throat and\nfought him off.  Then Lawrence set his back against the cottage\nwall and felt safer.  A second blow got home, and spoilt Billy's\nbeauty for ever:  it laid open his left eye and the left side of\nhis jaw. Undaunted, the Dane gave himself an angry shake, which\nspattered Lawrence with blood, and gathered his haunches for a\nsecond spring.  But by now Lawrence had clubbed his stick and was\nbeating him about the head with its heavy knobbed handle.  Swift\nas the dog was, the man was swifter: they fought eye to eye, the\nman forestalling every motion of the dog's whipcord frame:\nLawrence's blood was up, he would have liked to fight it out\nbare-handed.  They would not have been ill-matched, for when the\nDane reared Lawrence overtopped him only by an inch or so, and\nthe weight of the steelclad paws on his breast tore open his\nclothes and pinned him to the wall.  But Lawrence thrashed him\noff his feet whenever he tried to rise, till at length the lean\nmuzzle sank with a low baffled moan.\n\nEven then there was such fell strength in him that Lawrence dared\nnot spare him, and blow rained on blow.--\"Don't kill him,\" said\nIsabel.  \"Put this over his head.\"\n\nLawrence took the length of serge she gave him and with\ncharacteristic indifference to danger stooped over the dog, whose\nspirit he admired, and tried to swathe his head in its heavy\nfolds.  But, torn, blinded, baffled, the Dane was undefeated.  He\nwrenched his jaws out of their mufflings and rolled his head from\nside to side, snapping right and left.  \"Oh Billy,\" cried Isabel,\n\"you know me, lie down, dear old man!\" A pure-bred dog when sight\nand hearing are gone will recognize a familiar scent.  In an\nagony of pity Isabel flung her arm over the heaving shoulders--\n\n\"Don't!\" Lawrence dragged her off, but too late: the Dane's teeth\nhad snapped on her wrist.   The next moment he was lying on his\nside with his brains beaten out.  Lawrence was willing to spare\nhis own enemy but not Isabel's.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Isabel, shivering and moaning, \"oh, my poor old\nBilly!\"\n\n\"Damn your poor old Billy,\" said Lawrence: \"let me look at your\narm.\"\n\nHe carried her indoors, leaving Janaway and his wife and the Dane\nlying scattered on the sunlit turf.  He did not care one straw\nwhether they lived or died.  In the little front parlour, neat\nand fresh with its window full of white muslin and red geraniums,\nhe laid Isabel on a sofa and rolled up her sleeve: the flesh was\nnot much torn but the Dane's fangs had sunk in deep and clean.\n\"How far are we from a doctor?\"\n\n\"Four miles.  Why?  Billy wasn't mad.  I shall be all right\ndirectly.   May I have some water to drink?\"\n\n\"Curse these country hamlets,\" said Lawrence.  He could not carry\nher four miles, nor was she fit to walk so far: but to fetch help\nwould mean an hour or so's delay.  He went into the kitchen to\nfilla tumbler from the pump, and found an iron wash-bowl in Clara\nJanaway's neat sink, and a kettle boiling on the hob beside a\nsaucepan of potatoes that she had been cooking for dinner.\nIsabel sat up and took the glass from his hand.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she murmured, raising her beautiful dark eyes in\na diffident apology. \"It was all my own fault.\" Lawrence slipped\na cushion under her head and drew her gently down.  \"Oh, thank\nyou!  But please don't trouble about me. I do feel rather queer.\"\nLawrence thought it probable.  He had been bitten by a dog\nhimself and knew how horribly such a wound smarts.  \"It was all\nso--so very dreadful.  But I shall be all right directly.. Do go\nback to the others: I'm afraid poor Clara--oh!   oh, Captain\nHyde!  What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Set your teeth and shut your eyes,\" said Lawrence \"it won't take\nlong.  Your beloved Billy wasn't a nice animal to be bitten by.\nNo, he wasn't mad, but his teeth weren't very clean, and we don't\nwant blood poisoning to set up.  Steady now.\" He pressed his lips\nto her arm.\n\nIsabel's hand lay lax in his grasp while he methodically sucked\nthe wound and rinsed his mouth from her tumbler.  He hurt her,\nbut she had been bred to accept pain philosophically.  \"Is it\ndone?\" she asked meekly when he released her.  \"Not any more?\"\n\n\"No, that's enough.  Now for a drop of warm water.\" He bathed the\nwound thoroughly and in default of a better dressing bound it up\nwith his own handkerchief.  \"I wish I had some brandy to give\nyou, but there isn't a drop in the place.  Your estimable friend\nappears to have been a teetotaller.  I don't doubt he was a\npattern of all the virtues.--  But for that matter I couldn't give\nthe child publichouse stuff.--  Now, my little friend, if you'll\nlie quiet for five minutes, I'll see what's going on outside.\"\n\n\"Please may I have my skirt?\"\n\n\"Your what?\"\n\n\"My serge skirt.\"\n\nIt had not struck Lawrence till then that she was dressed in a\nwhite muslin blouse and a pink and blue striped petticoat.  \"Do\nyou mean to say that was your skirt you gave me to tie up the\ndog's head in?\"\n\n\"I hadn't anything else,\" said Isabel still more apologetically,\nand blushing--she was feeling very guilty, very much ashamed of\nthe trouble she had given: \"and you don't know how fond Ben was\nof Billy!\"\n\n\"Oh, damn Billy!\" said Lawrence for the second time.\n\nHe went out into the summer sunshine.  The dog, the fallen man,\nthe fallen woman, not one of  them had stirred a hair.  All was\npeaceful and clear in every note of black and white and scarlet\non the turf plat where they lay as if on a stage, in their green\nsetting of dimpled hillside and beech grove and marsh.  There was\na sickly smell in the hot bright air which carried Lawrence back\nto the trenches.\n\nHe went to examine the human wreckage.  No need to examine Billy\n--his record for good or ill was manifestly closed: and Lawrence\nhad a sickening suspicion that Mrs. Janaway too had finished with\na world which perhaps had not offered her much inducement to\nremain in it.  He lifted her up and laid her down again in a\ndecent posture, straightening her limbs and sweeping back her\nclotted grey hair: no, no need to feel for the pulse in that\nfaded breast from which her husband had partly torn away the\nneatly darned stuff bodice, so modest with its white tucker and\nsilver Mizpah brooch.  Lawrence composed its disorder with a\nreverent hand, spreading his own coat over her face.\n\nHe went on to Ben, and was frankly disappointed to find that Ben\nwas not dead--far from it: he gave a deep groan when Lawrence\nrolled him over: but it was a case of broken arm and collarbone,\nif not of spinal injury as well.  Lawrence found a length of line\nin the yard--Clara's clothes-line, in fact--and knotted it into\na triple cord, for, though no sane man could have got far in such\na state, it was on the cards that Janaway in his madness might\nscramble up and wander away on the downs.  So Lawrence lashed him\nhand and foot, and Ben blinked and grinned at the sun and\nslavered over his beard.\n\nIt was while thus employed that Lawrence began to wonder what\nwould have happened if Isabel had come to Wancote alone.  She\nmight have run away.  But would she, while Ben was engaged in\ncarpet-beating?  Not she!  Lawrence was not a fanciful man: but\nthe red and grey remains of Clara Janaway would have set the\nvisualizing faculty to work in the mind of a ploughboy.  After\ntying the last of a dozen knots, reef knots and none too loose,\nhe went to the back of the cottage where Isabel could not see him\nand was swiftly and violently sick.\n\nAfter that he felt better.  There was a pump in the yard, and he\nrinsed his head and hands under it, and washed off as best he\ncould the stains of the fight, and re-knotted his scarf and shook\nhimself down into his disordered clothes before going back to\nIsabel. And then it was that Isabel received of him a fresh\nimpression as though she had never known him before, one of those\nvivid second impressions that efface earlier memories.\n\nVal had always held paternal rank, Captain Hyde had been\nintroduced as Val's late superior officer, and so Isabel had\naccepted him as Val's contemporary, of the generation before her\nown.  But framed in the sunlit doorway, a very tall handsome man\nin undress, his coat thrown off, his trousers belted on his lean\nflanks, his wet shirt modelling itself over his powerful throat\nand shoulders and sticking to his ribs,  Hyde might have been\nonly six or seven and twenty: and certainly his manner was not\nmiddle-aged!  Val's language was refined enough for a curate, and\neven Rowsley in his young sister's presence never went beyond a\nsarcenet oath; but Hyde's frank fury was piquant to Isabel's not\nvery decorous taste.  When he came in, her pain and faintness\nbegan to diminish as if a stream of warm fresh life were flowing\ninto her veins.\n\n\"Are you better, Miss Isabel?\"\n\n\"Ever so much better, thank you.  Is--is Clara--?\"\n\nCool, grave, and tranquil, Lawrence took her hand.  \"Clara is\ndead.\"  He felt her trembling, and found a form of consolation\nwhich would have been slow to occur to his unprompted fancy.\n\"Better so, isn't it?  She wouldn't have been very happy after her\nhusband's trying to kill her.\"\n\n\"No, she wouldn't want them to put him in an asylum,\" Isabel\nagreed, but in a subdued voice.  \"Did you forget my skirt?\"\n\n\"No, but it was rather in a mess with the unfortunate Billy, and\nI'm afraid you'll have to do without it.  I'm going to take you\nhome now.  You can walk, can't you, with my help?  I'd like to\ncarry you a few steps, till we're out of sight of the cottage.\nPut your arm round my neck.\" Isabel hesitated.  She had been\nfrightened out of her life and still felt cruelly shaken, but her\nquick sense of the ridiculous protested against this deference\npaid to her when she wasn't really hurt and it was all her own\nfault.  What would Val have said?  But apparently Captain Hyde\nwas less exacting than Val.  \"Ah! let me: it is an ugly little\nscene outside and I don't want you to be haunted by it.\"\n\nShe resigned herself.  She had not yet begun to feel shy of\nLawrence, she was a child still, a child with the instincts of a\nwoman, but those instincts all asleep.  They quickened in her\nwhen she felt the glow of his life so near her own, but there was\na touch of Miranda in Isabel, and no cautionary withdrawal\nfollowed.\n\nAnd Lawrence?  The trustfulness of a noble nature begets what it\nassumes.  One need not ask what would have become of Miranda if\nshe had given her troth to an unworthy Ferdinand, because the\nMirandas of this world are rarely deceived.  Hyde was but a\nbattered Ferdinand.  He was a man of strong and rather coarse\nfibre who had indifferently indulged tastes that he saw no reason\nto restrain.  But he was changing: when he carried Isabel across\nthe sunlit grass plot, her beautiful grave childish head lying\nwarm on his shoulder, he had travelled far from the Hyde of the\nsummer house at Bingley.\n\n\"My word!\" said Yvonne Bendish, startled out of her drawl.  \"Is\nit you,  Isabel?\" She reined in and sat gazing with all her eyes\nat the couple coming down the field path to Chilmark Bridge.\n\"Have you had an accident?  What's happened?\"\n\n\"Excuse my hat,\" said Lawrence with rather more than his habitual\ncalm.  \"How lucky to have met you.  There has been a shocking\nbusiness up at Wancote.  Perhaps you would take Miss Stafford\nhome?  She should be got to bed, I think.\"\n\nMrs. Jack Bendish was not soon ruffled, nor for long.  \"Lift her\nin,\" she said.  \"Sorry I can't make room for you too, Captain\nHyde, you are as white as a ghost.  Very upsetting, isn't it? but\ndon't worry, girls of her age turn faint rather easily.  Her arm\nhurt? . . .\"  She pointed down the road with her whip.  \"Dr.\nVerney lives at The Laburnus, on the right, beyond the publichouse.\nIf you would be so kind as to send him up to the vicarage?\"\n\nShe whipped up her black ponies and was gone.  Lawrence was\ngrateful to her for asking no questions, but he would rather have\ntaken Isabel direct to Val.  Romance in bud requires a delicate\nhand.  Now Mrs. Jack Bendish had all the bourgeois virtues except\nmodesty and discretion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThe Wancote affair made a nine days' wonder in the Plain.  Indeed\nit even got into the London papers, under such titles as \"A\nDomestic Tragedy\" or \"Duel with a Dog\": and, while the Morning\nPost added a thumbnail sketch of Captain Hyde's distinguished\ncareer, the Spectator took Ben as the text of a \"middle\" on \"The\nAbuse of Asylum Administration in Rural Districts.\"\n\nLawrence himself, when he had despatched Hubert Verney to the\nvicarage, would have liked to cut his responsibility.  But it\ncould not be done: first there was the village policeman to run\nto earth and information to be laid before him, and then, since\nBrown's first flustered impulse was to arrest all concerned from\nLawrence to Clara Janaway,  Lawrence had to walk down with him to\nWharton to interview Jack Bendish, as both the nearest magistrate\nand the nearest sensible man.  But after pouring his tale into\nJack's sympathetic ear he felt entitled to wash his hands of the\naffair.  Instead of going back to Wanhope with the relief party\nhe got Bendish to drop him at the field path to Wanhope: and he\nslipped up to his room by a garden door, bathed, changed, and\ncame down to lunch without trace of discomposure.  Gaston,\ncurtly ordered to take his master's clothes away and burn them,\nwas eaten by curiosity, but in vain.\n\nEven before his cousin, Lawrence did not own to his adventure\ntill the servants had left the room.  If it could have been kept\ndark he would not have owned to it at all.  He did so only\nbecause it must soon be common property and he did not care to be\ntaxed with affectation.\n\nWhen, bit by bits his story came out across the liqueur glasses\nand the early strawberries, Major Clowes laid his head back and\nroared with laughter.  Lawrence was annoyed: he had not found it\namusing and he felt that his cousin had a macabre and uncomfortable\nsense of humour.  But Bernard,  wiping the tears from his eyes,\ndeveloped unabashed his idea of a good joke.  \"Hark to him!  Now\nisn't that Lawrence all over?  What! can't you run down for\ntwenty-four hours to a hamlet the size of Chilmark but you must\nbring your faics divers in your pocket?\"\n\n\"It isn't my fault if you have dangerous lunatics at large,\" said\nLawrence, helping himself daintily to cream.  \"If this is a\nspecimen of the way things go on in country districts, thank you,\ngive me a London slum.  The brute was as mad as a hatter.  He\nought to have been locked up years ago.  I can't conceive what\nStafford was about to keep him on the estate.\"\n\n\"All very fine,\" Bernard chuckled, \"but I'd lay any odds Ben\ndidn't go for Mrs. Ben till he saw you coming.\"\n\n\"Adventures are to the adventurous,\" Laura mildly translated the\nbitter jest.  Her mission in life was to smooth down Bernard's\nrough edges.  \"But that is too ugly, Berns.  You oughtn't to say\nsuch a thing even in fun.  It was no fun for Lawrence.\"\n\n\"I don't object to an occasional scrap,\" said Lawrence.  \"But\nthis one was overdone.\" He shivered suddenly from head to foot.\n\n\"Hallo, old man, I didn't know you had a nerve in your body!\"\nsaid Bernard staring at him.\n\nLawrence went on with his strawberries in an ungenial silence.\nHe was irritated by his momentary self betrayal. If he had cared\nto explain it he would have had to confess that though personally\nindifferent to adventures he disliked to have women mixed up in\nthem.  He was glad when Laura with her intuitive tact changed the\nconversation, not too abruptly.\n\n\"All modern men have nerves.  I should think Lawrence had as few\nas any, but it must have been a frightful scene.  I must run up\nafter lunch and see Isabel.  Poor child!  But she's wonderfully\nbrave.  All the Staffords were brought up to be stoical: if they\nknocked themselves about as children they were never allowed to\ncry.  Mr. Stafford is a fanatic on the point of personal courage.\nVal told me once that the only sins for which his father ever\ncuffed him were telling fibs and running away.\"\n\n\"Did he get cuffed often?\" Lawrence enquired.\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder,\" said Bernard. \"Val's one of your nervy men.\"\n\n\"Not after he was ten years old,\" said Laura smiling.  \"But as a\nlittle boy he was always in trouble.  Not the wisest treatment,\nwas it? for a delicate, sensitive child.\"\n\n\"Miss Isabel is not nervous,\" said Lawrence. \"She is as cool a\nyoung lady as I have ever seen. I believe she still owes me a\ngrudge for hitting Billy so hard.\" He dipped his fingers\ndelicately into his finger bowl.  \"No, no more, thanks.  Did I\ntell you that the brute of a Dane bit her?\"\n\n\"Bit Isabel!\"\n\n\"Made his teeth pretty nearly meet in her forearm.  She was\ntrying to soothe the dear dog.  Mr. Stafford's theories may be\nethically beautiful, but I object to their being carried to\nextremes.  Frankly, I should describe your young friend as\nidiotically rash,\" said Lawrence with a wintry smile.  \"I\ncouldn't prevent her doing it because I hadn't the remotest\nnotion she was going to do it.  The Dane was practically mad with\nrage.  I could have cuffed her myself with pleasure.  It was a\nwild thing to do and not at all agreeable for me.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Lawrence, that is one way of looking at it!\" Laura\nprotested, amused by his cool egoism, though she took it with the\nnecessary grain of salt.  \"Bitten by that horrible dog?  My poor\nIsabel! she loves dogs--I don't suppose she stopped to consider\nher own feelings or yours.\"\n\n\"She ought to have had more sense.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Bernard.  \"Half the trouble in the world comes\nfrom women shoving in where they're not wanted.  It's a pleasure\nto talk to you, Lawrence, after lying here to be slobbered over\nby a pack of old women.  I always exclude you, my dear,\" he\nnodded to Laura, \"but the parson twaddles on till he makes me\nsick, and Val's not much better.  What's a woman want with\ncourage?  Teach her to buy decent clothes and put 'em on\nproperly, and she's learning something useful.  I'll guarantee\nIsabel only got in the way. But you, Lawrence,\" he measured his\ncousin with an admiring eye, much as a Roman connoisseur might\nhave run over the points of a favourite gladiator, \"I should have\nliked to see you tackle the Dane.   You're a big chap--deeper in\nthe chest than I ever was, and longer in the reach.  What's your\nchest measurement?--  Yes, you look it.  And nothing in your hand\nbut a stick?  By Jove, it must have been worth watching!  Hey,\nLaura?\"\n\n\"Bernard, you are embarrassing!  You will make even Lawrence shy.\nBut, yes,\" Laura laid her hand on Hyde's arm: \"I should have\nliked to watch you fight the Dane.\"\n\nHow long was it since any one had spoken to Lawrence in that warm\ntone of affection?  Not since his father died.  From time to time\nMrs. Cleve or other ladies had flattered his senses or his\nvanity, but none of them had ever looked at him with Laura's kind\nadmiring eyes.  Perhaps after all there was something to be said\nfor family life!  Tragic wreck as Clowes was, he would have been\nfar more to be pitied but for his wife: their marriage, crippled\nand sterilized, was yet--as Lawrence saw it--a beautiful\nrelation.  Suppose he stood in that relation to Isabel?  Sitting\nat table in the cool panelled diningroom, his careless pose\nstiffening under Laura's touch, Lawrence for the first time began\nto wonder whether he would not gain more in happiness than he\nwould lose in freedom if he were to make the child his wife.\n\n\"To make the child his wife.\" He was not really more of an egoist\nthan the average man, but he did assume that if he wanted her he\ncould win her.  His mistress was very young: it was her rose of\nyouth and her unquelled spirit that charmed him even more than\nher beauty: and she had not sixpence to her name, while he was a\nrich man.  He did not, as Bernard would have done, go on to plume\nhimself on his magnanimity, or infer that Isabel's gratitude\nwould give him a claim on her fealty over and beyond the Pauline\nduty of wives.  In the immediate personal relation Lawrence was\nvisited by a saving humility.  But on the main issue he took, or\nthought he took, a practical view.  A man in love cannot soberly\nanalyse his own psychological state, and Lawrence did not know\nthat he had fallen in love with Isabel at first sight or that the\ngerm of matrimonial intentions had lain all along in his mind.\nHere and now he believed that he first thought of marrying her.\n\nThen he would have to stay on at Wanhope.   And court Isabel\nunder the eyes of all Chilmark?  Under Bernard's eyes at all\nevents; they were already watching him.  Lawrence was irritated:\nwhatever happened, he was not going to be watched by his cousin\nand chaffed and argued over and betted on.  In most points\nindifferently frank, Lawrence was silent as the grave where sex\ncame into play.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He touched with his lips the hand that Laura had\ninnocently laid on his wrist.  \"It can't really be fourteen\nyears, Laura, since you were staying at Farringay.\"\n\n\"Flatterer!\" said Laura, smiling but startled, and rising from\nher chair.  \"This to an old married woman!\"\n\n\"Ah! when I remember that I knew you before this fellow did--!\"\n\n\"Here, I say,\" came Bernard's voice across the table, riotously\namused, \"none o' that! none o' that!\"\n\n\"Penalty for having a charming wife,\" laughed Lawrence, in his\npreoccupation blind and deaf to danger signals.  He rose to open\nthe door for Laura.  \"By the by, if you go to the vicarage this\nafternoon, I'll stroll up with you, if I may.  I suppose I owe\nthe young lady that much civility!\"\n\n\"I can't: I'm busy,\" said Laura hastily.  \"That is, I don't know\nwhat time I shall get away.  Go by yourself, don't wait for me.\"\n\n\"Rubbish,\" said Bernard.  \"Much pleasanter for both of you to\nhave the walk together.  Lawrence doesn't want to go alone, do\nyou?\" (\"Rather not,\" said Lawrence heartily.) \"And I don't want\nyou here, my love, if that's the trouble, I can't have you tied\nto the leg of my sofa.\"\n\nLater, when Lawrence had gone out on the lawn to smoke, Bernard\nrecalled Laura.  She came to him.  He took hold of her wrist and lay\nsmiling up at her.  \"Nice relationship, isn't it, cousins-in-law?\nSo free and easy.  You--.  I watched you pawing him about.  So\naffectionate.  He felt it too.  Did you see the start he gave?  He\ntwigged fast enough.  Think you can play that game under my nose, do\nyou?  So you can.  I don't care what you do. Take yourself off now\nand take him with you.\"\n\n\"Don't pinch my wrist below the cuff, Bernard,\" said his wife. \"I\ncan't wear gloves at tea.\"\n\n\"You can stop out all night for all I care,\" said Clowes.  \"I'm\nsick of the sight of you.\"\n\nThen Laura knew that the Golden Age was over.\n\nIsabel had refused to go to bed.  She had no nerves: she saw life\nin its proper colours without refraction.  The dreadful scene at\nWancote had made its full impression on her, but she was not\nbeset like Hyde by visions of what might have been.  Still she\nwas tired and subdued, and when Verney had dressed her arm she\nannounced her intention of spending the afternoon in the garden\nout of the way of kind enquiries: and she settled herself on an\nIndian chair behind a thicket of lilac and syringa, while Val and\nRowsley and Yvonne brought books and cushions and chocolate and\neau de cologne to comfort beauty in distress.\n\nBut she had reckoned without the wicket gate in the garden wall,\nwhich Lawrence let himself in by.   He caught sight of her as he\ncrossed the lawn and came up to her bare-headed.  \"How are you?\"\nhe asked without preface.  \"Better now?\"\n\nHis informality went against the grain of Isabel's taste: he had\nno right to presume on a forced situation: with what fastidious\nmodesty Val would have drawn back!  She was tired, and she did\nnot want to be reminded of what had happened in the morning.  She\nshut up her book, but kept a finger in the place.  \"Thank you.\nI'm sorry the others are all out.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clowes sent me on ahead.\"\n\nFor the second time she had made Lawrence redden like a girl, and\nhis easy manner deserted him.  Isabel unconsciously let the book\nslip from her hand.  The lives of the Forsythe family were less\nabsorbing than her own life when this fiery dramatic glow was\nshed over it.  A singular smile flitted over her lips: \"Well, you\nmay as well sit down now you are here,\" she observed.  Lawrence\nsat down in a deck chair and Isabel's smile broadened: she was\nlaughing at him and teasing him with her eyes, though what she\nsaid remained conventional to the point of primness.  \"Is Laura\ncoming to see me?  How sweet of her!  But what a pity she\ncouldn't come with you!  Why couldn't she?\"\n\n\"I believe she stayed to look after my cousin.\"\n\n\"How is Major Clowes?  Did he have a good night and was he in a--\nwas he cheerful today?\"\n\n\"So-so: he's not a great talker, is he?\"\n\nIsabel's speaking face expressed dissent.   \"Perhaps not when\nhe's in a good temper.  Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm always forgetting\nhe's your cousin.\"\n\n\"I'm prone to forget it myself.  I've seen so little of him.\"\n\n \"('Though the blase-man-of-the-world had seen thousands of\nsuperbly beautiful women in elegant creations by Paquin or Worth,\nhis gaze was riveted as by a mesmeric attraction on the innocent\nyoung girl in her simple little white muslin frock, with her\nlissome ankles and slim, sunburnt hands.')  Laura said you had\nbeen a great traveller.  Shall you settle down in England?\"\n\n\"Not unless I marry.\"\n\nIsabel declined this topic, on which Mrs. Jack Bendish would have\nexpatiated.  \"Laura says you have a lovely old house in\nSomersetshire.  It must be jolly to have an ancestral house.\"\n\n\"Mine is not ancestral,\" said Lawrence amused. \"My father bought\nit forty years ago at the time of the agricultural depression.\nIt belonged to some county people--Sir Frank Fleet--who\ncouldn't afford to keep it up.  It is a lovely place, Farringay,\nbut it's full of Fleet ghosts and the neighbourhood doesn't let\nme forget that I'm an alien.\"\n\n\"But how absurd! how narrow-minded!\" exclaimed Isabel. \"Houses\nmust change hands now and then, and I dare say your father was a\nbetter landlord than the Fleets were.  Besides, see how much worse it\nmight have been!  There's Wilmerdings, here in Chilmark, that the\nMorleys have taken: his name isn't Morley at all, Yvonne says it's\nMoss in the City: but they foreclosed on the Orr-Matthews' mortgage\nand turned them out, and that darling old place is delivered over to\na horrid little Jew!\"\n\n\"Poor Morley!\" said Lawrence laughing.  \"I am a Jew myself.\"\nIsabel was stricken dumb.  \"I thought I had better tell you than\nlet you hear it from some one else.  No, don't apologize! these\nthings will happen, and I'm not deeply hurt, for I refuse to call\nsibb with a Moss-Morley. I should never foreclose on any one's\nmortgage.  My mother was an Englishwoman and my father was a\nLevantine--half Jew, half Greek.  Have you never heard of Andrew\nHyde the big curio dealer in New Bond Street?  He was commonly\nknown as old Hyde-and-seek.  The Hyde galleries are famous.  As I\nremember him he was a common-looking little old man with a\npassion for art.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry I said such a stupid thing,\" said Isabel, still\nvery red, \"not because of hurting your feelings, for it isn't\nlikely that anything I said would do that--but because it was\nstupid in itself, and narrow-minded, and snobbish.  It'll be a\nlesson to me.  All the same, it's interesting.\"  She had\nforgotten by now that she was an innocent-young-girl and Lawrence\na blase-man-of-the-world, and had slipped into a vein of intimacy\nwhich was fast charming Lawrence out of all his caution.  \"I\nsuppose you take after your father, and that's why you're so\nunlike Major Clowes.  He is a Clowes, but you're a Hyde.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\nIsabel waited a moment to think it out.  \"You're more of a\ncosmopolitan; I expect you have a passion for art too, like your\nfather. Major Clowes hasn't.  He doesn't care two pins for the\nbeauty of his old swords and daggers, he cares only for getting\nall the different sorts.  You, perhaps, might care almost too\nmuch.\" Lawrence dropped his eyes.  \"And you vary more, you're\nnot always the same,  you have more facets: one can see you've\ndone all sorts of things and mixed with all sorts of people. I\nsuppose that's why you're so easily bored--I don't mean to be\nrude!\"\n\n\"At the present moment I am deeply interested.  Go on: it charms\nme to be dissected to my face,  and by such an able hand.\"\n\n\"No: it's absurd and I never meant to begin it.  Of course I\ndon't know a bit what you're like.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" Lawrence murmured:--\"Guess away and I'll tell you\nif you're right.\"\n\n\"You won't play fair.  You won't own up and you'll get cross if I\ndo.\"\n\n\"Not I, I have the most amiable temper in the world.\"\n\n\"Now I wonder if that's true?\" said Isabel, scrutinizing him\nclosely.  \"Perhaps you wouldn't often take the trouble to get in\na wax.  Oh well,\" surrendering at indiscretion, \"then I guess\nthat you care for very few people and for those few very much.\"\n\n\"Missed both barrels.  I like any number of people and I\nshouldn't care if I never saw one of them again.\"\n\nIsabel laughed. \"I said you wouldn't play fair.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe me?\"\n\n\"No, of course not.  You wouldn't say it if it were true.\"\n\nLawrence drew a deep breath and looked away.  Their nook of turf was\nout of sight of the house,  sheltered from it behind a great thicket\nof lilac and syringa, which walled off the lawn from the kitchen\ngarden full of sweet-smelling currant bushes and apple-trees laden\nwith green fruit.  The sleepy air was alive with gilded wasps, and\nbetween the stiffly-drooping apple-branches, with their coarse\nfoliage, and the pencilled frieze of stonecrop and valerian waving\nalong the low stone boundarywall, there was a dim honey-coloured\nexpanse that stretched away like an inland sea, where, the afternoon\nsunshine lay in a yellow haze over brown and yellow and blue tracts\nof the Plain.  Nothing was to be heard but the drone of wings near at\nhand and the whirr of a haycutter far down in the valley.  No one was\nnear and summer lay heavy on the land.\n\n\"I did care once. . I had a bad smash in my life when I was\nlittle more than a boy.\" He dragged a heavy gold band from his\nfinger.  \"That was my wedding ring.\"\n\n\"Oh ... I'm sorry!\" faltered Isabel.  She was stunned by the\nextraordinary confidence.\n\n\"I married out of my class.  It was when I was at Cambridge.  She\nwas a beautiful girl but she was not a lady.  Her father was a\ntobacconist in the Cury, and Lizzie liked to serve in the shop.\nAs she didn't want to lose her character nor I my degree, we\ncompromised on secret nuptials. I took a house for her in Newham\nwhere I could go and visit her. I ought not to tell you the rest\nof the story.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you can,\" said Isabel simply. \"I hear all sorts of\nstories in the village.\"\n\nSo childish in some ways, so mature in others, she saw that\nLawrence was longing to unbosom himself, and her instinct was to\nlisten quietly, for, after all, this, though the strangest, was\nnot the first such confidence that had been poured into her ear.\nShe and her brother Val were alike in occasionally hearing\nsecrets that had never been told to any one else.  Why?  Probably\nbecause they never gave advice, never moralized, never thought of\nthemselves at all but only of the friend in distress. Isabel took\nHyde's hand and held it closely, palm to palm.  \"Tell me all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"There was another fellow at Trinity who had been in the Sixth at\nEton with me, a year older than I was, a very brilliant man and\nas hard as nails: Rendell, his name was: an athlete, a tophole\ncentre-forward, with a fascinating Irish manner and blazing blue\neyes.  To him I told my tale, because we were Damon and Pythias,\nand I couldn't have kept a secret from him to save my life.  I\nwas an ingenuous youngster in those days: never was such a pal as\nmy pal!  He saw me through my marriage and afterwards I took him\nwith me once or twice to Myrtle Villa: it may illuminate the\nsituation if I say that it made me all the prouder of Lizzie when\nI saw Rendell admired her: never was such an idyll as my manage a\ntrois! Unluckily, one evening when I turned up unexpectedly I\nfound them together.\"\n\n\"Oh! . . . What did you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  There was nothing to be done. I wasn't going to ruin\nmyself by divorcing her.  Luckily the war broke out and Rendell\nand I both enlisted the next day.  He was killed fighting by my\nside at Neuve Chapelle, and I had the job of breaking the news to\nLizzie.  She was royally angry, poor Lizzle: told me I had no\nright to be alive when a better man than myself was dead. I\nagreed: Rendell was--the better man, though he didn't behave\nwell to me.  He died better than he lived.  Out there it didn't\nseem to matter much.  He died in my arms.\"\n\n\"Did you forgive your wife?\"\n\n\"I never lived with her again, if that's what you mean.  If I had\nbeen willing, which I wasn't, she never would have consented.\nShe had the rather irrational prejudices of her type and class,\nand persisted in regarding me, or professing to regard me, as\nanswerable for Rendell's death.  It wasn't true,\" said Lawrence,\nturning his eyes on Isabel without any attempt to veil their\nagony.  \"If I'd meant to shoot him I should have shot him to his\nface.  But I'd have saved him if I could.  How on earth could any\none do anything in such a hell as Neuve Chapelle?  That week\nevery officer in my company was either killed or wounded.  But\nLizzie had no imagination.  She couldn't get beyond the fact that\nI was alive and he was dead.\"\n\n\"What became of her?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to say she went to the bad.  She had money from both\nof us, but she spent it in public houses--didn't seem to care\nwhat happened to her after losing Arthur: a wretched life: it\nended last January with her death from pneumonia after measles.\nThat was what brought me back to England; I couldn't stand coming\nhome before.\"\n\n\"Was it a relief when she died?\"\n\n\"No, I was sorry,\" said Hyde.  His wide black eyes, devil-driven\nbeyond reticence, were riveted on Isabel's: apparently she no\nlonger existed for him except as the Chorus before whom he could\nstrip himself of the last rag of his reserve.  \"It brought it all\nback.  I was besotted when I married her, and I remembered all\nthat when I saw her dead. I forgot the other men.  It was just as\nit was when Arthur died.  I couldn't do anything for him, and he\nwas in agony: he was shot through the stomach: it didn't seem to\nmatter then that he had robbed me of Lizzie.  I couldn't even get\nhim a drop of water to drink.  He died hard, did Rendell.  It\nwasn't true, what Lizzie said.  I'd have given my life for him.\nBut I couldn't even make it easy for him to go.\"\n\n\"Poor Rendell,\" said Isabel softly, \"and poor you!  Oh, I'm so\nsorry--I'm so sorry!\"\n\nShe was not afraid of Hyde now nor shy of him, she felt only an\nimmense pity for him--this man who for no conceivable reason and\nwithout the slightest warning had flung the weight of his\nterrible past on her young shoulders.  She longed to comfort him.\nBut he was inaccessibly far away, isolated, his voice rapid and\nhard and clear, his manner normal: every nerve stripped bare but\nstill rigid.  Inexperienced as she was, Isabel had a shrewd idea\nof his immediate need.  She took up the ring that Lawrence had\nwrenched off and slipped it on his finger again.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" said Lawrence starting: \"why do you do that?\"\n\n\"But I shall love to see you wear it,\" said Isabel. \"It's the\nsign that you've forgiven them both.\"\n\n\"Have I?\"\n\n\"Of course you have.  You loved them too much not to forgive.\"\n\n\"It is true.  But I hate myself for it,\" said Lawrence.  \"I hate\nyour etiolated Christian ethics.  I don't believe in the\nforgiveness of sins.  The complaisant husband, O God!  If I'd had\nthe spirit of a man, I should have shot Arthur the night--that\nnight--. . . .\n\n \"But you loved him,\" said Isabel, \"and your wife too.  You felt\nrevenge and hate and passion, but love was stronger: and love is\nnobler than hate.  They betrayed you, but you never betrayed\nthem.  It wasn't unmanly of you, it was defeat and dishonour for\nthem, not for you, when Rendell, after that great wrong he had\ndone you, when you tried to make it easy for him to go.\"\n\n\"May I--?\" said Lawrence.\n\nHe leaned his face down on her open palms, and she felt the tears\nthat she could not see.  He could not control them, and indeed\nafter the first racking agony, when he felt as though his will\nwere being torn out of him by the roots, he made no effort to\ncontrol them, releasing Isabel and dropping at full length upon\nthe turf.  Nothing else, no torment of his own thoughts, not\nRendell's last pangs nor his wife's beauty young again in death\nhad ever made Hyde weep: if Rendell had died hard, Lawrence had\nlived equally hard, locking up his frightful trouble in his own\nbreast, escaping from it when he could, cursing it and fighting\nagainst it when it threatened to overpower him.  But now he\nsurrendered to it and acknowledged to himself that it had broken\nhis life.  And he felt no shame, not one iota, nothing but a\nprofound soulagement: the proud reticent man, too vain to shed\ntears in his own room alone, wept voluntarily before Isabel,\nuncovering for her pity the wounds not only of grief but of rage\nand humiliation.\n\nSuch an outbreak would have been impossible in a man of pure\nEnglish blood, and in a pure Oriental it would have manifested\nitself differently, but Isabel had truly said of Hyde that his\ntemperament was not homogeneous: the mixed strain in him betrayed\nhim into strange incongruities of strength and weakness.  Isabel\nshut her eyes to incongruity.  She gave him without stint the\npitying gentleness he thirsted for.  She refused now to contrast\nhim with her brother.  Certainly Val's judgment would have been\ncutting and curt.  But just?  Hardly.  By instinct Isabel felt\nthat her brother's clear, sane, English mind had not all the\nfactors necessary for judging this collapse.\n\nHer imagination was at work in the shadow: \"'the night--that\nnight. . . .\" How do men live through such hours?  She saw Lizzie\nas a chocolate-box beauty, but redeemed from hebetude by her\nrobust youth: able to attract Hyde by his love of luxury and to\nhold him by main force: uneducated, coarse, and cruel, but not\nweak.  What a disastrous marriage! doomed from the outset, even\nif no Rendell had come on the scene.  Isabel dismissed Rendell\nrather scornfully: in that night at Myrtle Villa she felt pretty\nsure that the duel had been fought out between husband and wife:\nthe very staging of it, picturesque for Lizzie Hyde and tragic\nfor her husband, must for the entrapped lover have taken a frame\nof ignominious farce. A gleam shot through Isabel's eyes-as she\nimagined Rendell trying to face Hyde, and Hyde sparing him and\nsending him away untouched.  No, no! as between the two men, the\nhonours lay with Hyde.\n\nBut as between him and Lizzie?  There the reckoning was not so\neasy.  His wife had set scars on him that would never wear out.\nDimly Isabel guessed that since coming out of her destructive\nhands Hyde himself could be both coarse and cruel: the seed of\nbrutality must have been in him all along, but Myrtle Villa had\nfertilized it.  If he married again, what would be required of\nLizzie's successor?  A strange deep smile gave to Isabel's young\nlips the wisdom of the women of all the ages. Love that gives\nwithout stint asking for no recompense: love that understands yet\nwill not criticize nor listen to criticism: love that dares to\ndeny its lover for his own sake.\n\nAfter collapse came quiescence, and, after a long quiescence,\nrevival.  Hyde raised himself on his arm and felt for his\nhandkerchief--indifferent to Isabel's observation, or soothed by\nit:  his features were ravaged.  Isabel drenched her own\nhandkerchief in Mrs. Bendish's eau-de cologne and gave it him,\ndripping wet.  \"Take this, it will do you  good.\"\n\n\"Thank you\" said Lawrence, exhausted and subdued.\n\nBecoming gradually rather more composed, he raised his eyes\nagain.  \"What must you think of me? It is beyond apology.  Will\nyou ever forgive me?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to forgive: I'm not hurt.\"\n\n\"You're rather young to hear such a history as mine.\"\n\nShe blushed.  \"Val says it doesn't matter what one knows so long\nas one doesn't think about it in the wrong way.\" With her sweet\nfriendly smile, she touched with her fingertip the lapel of his\ncoat: an airy gesture, but there was a fire as well as sweetness\nin Isabel, and for his life Lawrence could not repress a start.\n\"You mustn't mind me, Captain Hyde.  You needn't mind, because\nyou couldn't help it.  One can keep a secret for twenty years but\nnot for ever, and for confessor I suppose any woman will do\nbetter than a man, won't she?  It's not as though I should ever\ntell any one else: I never will, I promise you that.  You'll go\naway and never see me again, and it'll be as though no one knew\nor as though I were dead.\"\n\nTouching innocence!  Did she indeed imagine that after such a\nscene . . .?\n\n\"But I do not care two straws,\" said Lawrence, \"so spare your\nconsolations!  On the contrary, it has been a great relief to me.\nIt's as if you had unlocked a door.  The prisoner you have set\nfree thanks you.  I was only afraid it might have been too much\nfor you, but you're made of strong stuff.  Yet I don't suppose\nyou ever saw a man weep before: well, you've seen it now: mon\nDieu, mon Dieu, but I am tired!  But you've let yourself in for a\nconsiderable responsibility.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For me.  Do you think it can ever again be the same between us?\"\nOn one knee by Isabel's chair, Hyde laughed down at her with his\nbrilliant eyes, irreticent and unsparing of timidity in others.\n\"Do you think I could have leaned my head on any hands but\nyours?\"\n\nHe came too near, he touched her.  Isabel had gone through a\ngreat deal that day, but, with the cruel and sordid history of\nHyde's married life fresh in her mind, none of the material\nhorrors at Wancote had produced in her such a shuddering recoil\nas now.  His wife had not been dead six months!  \"Captain Hyde,\nhow dare you?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nLawrence drew himself up, a good-humoured  smile on his lips: but\nthey were pale.  \"I--I didn't mean to hurt you,\" faltered\nIsabel, as the tension of his silence reached her.  What right\nhad she, a young girl, to impose her own code of delicacy on a\nman of Hyde's age and standing?--Lawrence looked at her\nsearchingly and his eyes changed, the sad irony died out of them,\nand rapidly, imperceptibly, he returned to his normal manner.\n\n\"Nor I to frighten you.  Why, what a child it is, after all!\nYes, your hands are strong, but they aren't practised yet.  Never\nmind, you shall forget or remember anything you like, except this\none thing which it pleases me and may please you to remember that\nI'm very glad you know the worst and weakest of me--\"\n\n\"Isabel, are you there?\"\n\nThus daily life revenges itself on those who forget its\nexistence.\n\n\"That is Val's voice,\" said Lawrence.  He stood up, no longer\npale.  \"Heavens, I can't face him!\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" said Isabel in dismay.  She was no more anxious for\nthem to meet than Lawrence was,  but Val's footstep on the turf\nwas dangerously near.  But he was making for the middle of the\nlilac-hedge, for the red rose archway and the asphalt walk\nbetween reddening apple trees: and Isabel was sitting near the\nend, close to the garden wall.  She flew out of her chair, held\nup a branch while  Lawrence squeezed between the wall and the\nlilacs,  and flew back and curled up again.  The lilac leaves had\nnot finished twinkling and rustling when  Val appeared.\n\n\"How are you, invalid?  I came home early on purpose to look\nafter you.\" He was in well-worn grey  riding clothes, booted and\nspurred, his whip in one hand and his gloves in the other: a\nslight,  cool, well-knit figure of low tones and half-lights.\n\"Have you had a quiet afternoon?\"\n\n\"So-so,\" said Isabel, crimson.\n\n\"You look flushed, my darling,\" said Val tenderly.  He sat down\nat the foot of Isabel's Indian chair and laid a finger on her\nwrist. \"You don't  feel feverish, do you?\" The light click of the\nwicket gate, which meant that Lawrence was safely off the\npremises, enabled Isabel to say no with a sigh of relief.  \"It\nmust be the hot weather.  Hallo! what have we here?\"\n\nHe held up the gold cigarette case which had dropped from Hyde's\ncoat when he was lying on the grass.\n\n\"Some of Mrs. Bendish's property by the look of it,\" remarked\nVal. \"Diamonds, begad!  I should have thought Yvonne had better\ntaste.  But it must be hers, though the cipher doesn't seem to\nhave a B in it.  I'll guarantee it isn't Rosy's.\"   He slipped it\ninto his pocket.  \"I'll give it to Jack, I shall see him tonight\nat the vestry-meeting.\"\n\n\"It belongs to Captain Hyde.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"He's been here this afternoon.\"\n\n\"How long did he stay?\"\n\n\"What time is it?--  An hour and twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"What brought him?\" said Val, bewildered.\n\nIsabel was mute. . . \"I don't know what you're talking about,\nIsabel.  Has he been with you all that time?  Very stupid of him\nwhen I particularly wanted you to have a quiet afternoon.  When\ndid he go?\"\n\n\"He has only just gone.\"\n\n\"Just gone? I never saw him.\"\n\n\"He went by the wicket gate.\"\n\n\"But I came in by the wicket gate myself!\" said Val.  His kind\nserene eyes rested on his sister without a shadow of any thought\nbehind surprise.\n\n\"I left the mare with Rowsley in the village.\"\n\nIsabel sat up suddenly and wound her arms round Val's neck. \"I\nsent him away when I heard you coming.  He dodged you behind the\nlilacs. I didn't want to tell you he'd been here.  I never should\nhave told you if you hadn't found that case.\"\n\n\"You got rid of him--  This minute?  Because I came--?  Isabel!\"\nStafford held her off.  \"It is not possible--!  Listen to me: I\nwill have an answer.  I know Hyde.  Has he said anything to\noffend you?\"\n\n\"No! no! oh Val, don't be so angry!\"\n\n\"Lucky for him,\" said Val, drawing a long breath and sitting down\nagain, his whip across his knee.  \"My dear little sister, you\nmustn't make mysteries out of nothing at all!  I'm sorry I\nstartled you, but you startled me: I didn't know what to make of\nit. Hyde has not a very good name. . . . In fact I'd rather you\ndidn't see too much of him unless Rose or I were there: it was\ncheek of him to come up this afternoon when I was out, considering\nthat he scarcely knows you: but I suppose he thinks the Wancote show\ngives him right of entry.  That is the sort of thing a chap like Hyde\ndoes think.  Now begin again and tell me what it's all about.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, Val, nothing!\" said Isabel, laughing, though the\ntears were not far from her eyes.  \"I didn't know you could get\nin such a wax if you tried!  It's as you say, a little mystery of\nnothing at all.  I'd tell you like a shot if I could, but I can't\nbecause it would be breaking a promise.\"\n\n\"Hyde had no earthly right to make you promise.\"\n\n\"It was of my own accord.\"\n\n\"It is all wrong,\" said Val.  \"Promises and silly secrets between\na child like you and a fellow like Hyde!\"  He was more grave and\nvexed than Isabel had ever seen him.  \"There must be no more of\nit.\"\n\n\"There won't if I can help it!\" said Isabel.  \"I like Captain\nHyde--yes, I do: I know you don't, and I can quite see that he's\nwhat Rose would call a bit of an outsider, but I'm sorry for him\nand there's a great deal I like in him.  But I don't want to see\nhim again for years and years.\" She gave a little shiver of\ndistaste: if anything had been wanting to heighten the reaction\nof her youth against Hyde's stained middle age, the evasions in\nwhich he had involved her would have done it.  \"Now don't scold\nme any more!  I'm innocent, and I feel rather sad.  The world\nlooks unhomely this afternoon.  All except you!  You stay there\nwhere I can watch you: you're so comfortably English, so nice and\ncool and quiet!  There's no one like you, no one: the more I see\nof other people the more I like you!  I'm so glad you don't wear\nlinen clothes and a Panama hat and rings.  I'd give you away if\nyou did with half a pound of tea.  No, it's no use asking me any\nmore questions because I shan't answer them: a promise is all the\nmore binding if one would rather not keep it.  No, and it's no\nuse fishing either, I can keep a secret as well as you can--\"\n\nShe broke off before the white alteration in Val's face.\n\n\"Has--.\n\n\"No,\" said Isabel slowly: \"no, he never mentioned your name.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n\"Val\"\n\n\"M'm.\"\n\n\"I say\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"What's all this about the Etchingham agency?\"\n\nVal Stafford, smoking a well-earned pipe some hours later in the\nevening sunlight on the vicarage lawn, looked up at his brother\nover the Chronicle with a faint frown.  \"Who?\"\n\n\"Ah! who?\" said Rowsley, squatting cross-legged on the turf.\n\n\"Jack began on it this afternoon, and I had to switch him off, for\nI didn't care to own that it was news to me.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in it at present.\"\n\n\"The duke has offered me the management of his Etchingham\nproperty,\" said Val unwillingly. \"Oh no, not to give up Bernard:\nEtchingham, you see, marches with Wanhope and the two could be\nrun together.  He was awfully nice about it: would take what time\nI could give him: quite saw that Wanhope would have to come\nfirst.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Four hundred and an allowance for a house.  Five, to be precise,\nwhich is what he is giving Mills: but of course I couldn't take\nfull time pay for a part-time job.\"\n\nRowsley whistled.\n\n\"Yes, it would be very nice,\" said Val, always temperate.  \"It\nwould practically be 300 pounds, for I couldn't go on taking my\nfull 300 pounds from Bernard.  I should get him to put on a young\nfellow to work under me.\"\n\n\"It would make a lot of difference to you, even so.\"\n\n\"To us,\" Val corrected him.  \"Another pound a week would oil the\nwheels of Isabel's housekeeping.   And--\" he hesitated, but\nhaving gone so far one might as well go on--\"it would enable me\nto do two things I've long set my heart on, only it was no use\nsaying so: give you another hundred and fifty a year and insure\nmy life in Isabel's favour.  It would lift a weight off my mind\nif I could do that.  Suppose I were to die suddenly--one never\nknows what would become of her?  She'll be able to earn her own\nliving after taking her degree in October, but women's posts are\nbadly paid and it's uncommonly hard to save.  Oh yes, old boy, I\nknow you'd look after her!  But I don't want her to be a drag on\nyou: it's bad enough now--you never grumble, but I know what\nit's like never to have a penny to spare.  Times have changed\nsince I was in the Army, but nothing alters the fact that it's\nuncommonly unpleasant to be worse off than other fellows. I hate\nit for you--all the more because you don't grumble.  It is a\nconstant worry to me not to be able to put you in a better\nposition.\"\n\nRowsley had been too long inured to this paternal tenderness to\nbe sensible of its touching absurdity on the lips of a man not\nmuch older than himself.  But he was not a selfish youth, and he\nremonstrated with Val, though more like a son than a brother.\n\"Yes, I dare say, but where do you come in? A stiff premium for\nIsabel and 50 pounds for Jim and 150 pounds for me doesn't leave\nmuch change out of 300 pounds!\"\n\n\"Oh, I've all I want.  Living at home, I don't get the chance of\nspending a lot of pocket money.\"\n\n\"Why don't you close at once?\"\n\n\"Because I can't get an answer out of Bernard. I've spoken to him\nbut he won't decide one way or the other.  And he's my master,\nand I can't take on another job if he objects.  That's why I kept\nit dark at home: what's the good of raising hopes that may be\ndisappointed?\"\n\n\"Pity you can't chuck Bernard and take on Etchingham and the\nfive hundred.\"\n\n\"I should never do that,\" said Val in the rare tone of decision\nwhich in him was final.  \"After all these years I could never\nleave Bernard in the lurch.  I owe him too much.\"\n\n\"As if the boot weren't on the other leg!\" Rowsley muttered.  He\nwas not mercenary--none of Mr. Stafford's children were: he saw\neye to eye with Val in Val's calm preference of six to eight\nhundred a year: but when Val carried his financial principles\ninto the realm of sentiment Rowsley now and then lost his temper.\nHis brother smiled at him, amused by his irritation, unmoved by\nit: other men's opinions rarely had any weight with Val Stafford.\n\n\"Pax till it happens, at all events!  Honestly I don't think\nBernard means to object: he's been all smiles the last day or\ntwo--Hyde's coming has shaken him up and done him good--\"\n\n\"Oh!  Hyde!\"\n\nVal let fail his paper and looked curiously at Rowsley, whose\ntone was a challenge.  \"What is it now?\"\n\n\"Do you like this chap Hyde?\"\n\n\"That depends on what you mean by liking him.  He's not a bad\nspecimen of his class.\"\n\n\"What is his class?  Do you know anything of his people?\"\n\n\"Of his family I know little except that he has Jew blood in him\nand is very well off,\" Val could have told his brother where the\nmoney came from, but forbore out of consideration for Lawrence,\nwho might not care to have his connection with the Hyde Galleries\nknown in Chilmark.  \"He came here because Lucian Selincourt asked\nhim to see if he could do anything for Bernard.\"\n\n\"I can't see Hyde putting himself out of his way to oblige Mr.\nSelincourt.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, Rose, I should say he had only just got back to\nEngland and was at a loose end.  But there was a dash of good\nnature in it: he's genuinely fond of Mrs. Clowes.\"\n\n\"So I gathered,\" said Rowsley.  His tone was pregnant.  Val sat\nsilent for a moment.\n\n\"What rubbish!  He hasn't seen her for eight or ten years.\"\n\n\"Since her marriage.\" Val shrugged his shoulders.  \"Sorry, Val,\nbut I cannot see Hyde staying on at Wanhope out of cousinly\naffection for Bernard Clowes.  It must be a beastly uncomfortable\nhouse to stay in.  Nicely run and all that, and they do you very\nwell, but Bernard is distinctly an acquired taste.  Oh, my dear\nchap!\" as Val's silence stiffened, \"no one suggests that Laura's\never looked at the fellow!  But facts are facts, and Hyde is--\nHyde.  I'm not a bit surprised to hear he has Jew blood in him,\"\nRowsley continued, warming to the discussion: he was a much\nkeener judge of character that the tolerant and easy-going Val.\n\"That accounts for the arty strain in him.  Yvonne says he's a\nthorough musician, and Jack told me Lord Grantchester took to him\nbecause he knew such a lot about pictures.  Well, so he ought!\nHe's a Londoner.  What does he know of the country?  Only what\nyou pick up at a big country-house party or a big shoot!  He's\nnot the sort of chap to stay on at Wanhope for the pleasure of\ncheering up across-grained br--a fellow like Bernard.  Yes, he's\ntalking of staying on indefinitely: is going to send to town for\none of his confounded cars. . . .  And what other woman is there\nin Chilmark that he'd walk across the road to look at?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure you're fair to him.\"\n\nRowsley turned up to his brother an amused, rather sweet smile.\n\"Val, you'd pray for the devil?\"\n\n\"Oh, Hyde isn't a devil! I came pretty close to him ten years\nago.  He has a streak of generosity in him: no one knows that\nbetter than I do, for I'm in his debt.  What?  Oh! no, not in\nmoney matters: is that likely?  But he's capable of . . .\nmagnanimity, one might call it,\" Stafford fastidiously felt after\nprecision: \"no, he wouldn't pursue Laura; he wouldn't make her\nlife harder than it is already.\"\n\n\"He might propose to make it easier.\" Rowsley threw a daisy at a\ncockchafer and missed it.  \"You and I are sons of a parsonage.\nWe shouldn't run off with a married lady because it would be\nagainst our principles.\" His thin brown features were twisted\ninto a faint grimace.  Rowsley, like Val, possessed a satirical\nsense of humour, and gave it freer play than Val did.  \"It's so\ndifficult to shake off early prejudices.  When Fowler and I were\nat the club the other day, we met a horrid little sweep who waxed\nconfidential.  I said I couldn't make love to a married woman if\nI tried, and Fowler said he could but held rather not, and we\nwalked off, but as I remarked to Fowler afterwards the funny\nthing was that it was true.  I don't see anything romantic in the\nsituation.  It strikes me as immoral and disgusting.  But Hyde\nwouldn't take a narrow view like mine.  He has to live up to his\ntailor.\"\n\n\"Oh, really, Rose!\" Val gave his unwilling laugh.  \"You're like\nIsabel, who can't forgive him for sporting a diamond monogram.\"\n\n\"No, but I'm interested.  I know Jack's limitations, and Jimmy's,\nand yours, but Hyde's I don't know, and he intrigues me,\" said\nRowsley, lighting a cigarette with his agile brown fingers.\n\"Now I'll tell you the way he really strikes me.  He's not a bad\nsort: I shouldn't wonder if there were more decency in him than\nhe'd care to get credit for.  But I should think,\" he looked up\nat Val with his clear speculative hazel eyes, \"that he's never in\nhis life taken a thrashing.  He's always had pots of money and\nsuperb health.  I know nothing, of his private concerns, but at\nall events he isn't married, and from what Jack says he's sought\nsafety in numbers.  No wife, no kids, no near relations--that\nmeans none of the big wrenches.  No: I don't believe Hyde's ever\ntaken a licking in his life.\"\n\n\"You sound as if you would like to administer one.\"\n\n\"Only by way of a literary experiment,\" said Rowsley with his\nmischievous grin.  He was of the new Army, Val of the old: it was\na constant source of mild surprise to Val that his brother read\nbooks about philosophy, and psychology, and sociology, of which\npre-war Sandhurst had never heard: read poetry too, not Tennyson\nor Shakespeare, but slim modern volumes with brown covers and\nwide margins: and wrote verses now and then, and sent them to\norange-coloured magazines or annual anthologies, at which Val\ngazed from a respectful distance.  \"I don't owe him any grudge.\nI'm not Bernard's dry-nurse!\"\n\nVal turned a leaf of his paper, but he was not reading it.\n\n\"I rather wish you hadn't said all this, Rowsley.  It does no\ngood: not even if it were true.\"\n\n\"Val, if it weren't such a warm evening I'd get up and punch your\nhead.  You're a little too bright and good, aren't you?  Yvonne\nBendish says it, and she's Laura's sister.\"\n\n\"Yvonne would say anything. I wish you had given her a hint to\nhold her tongue.  She may do most pestilent mischief if she sets\nthis gossip going.\"\n\n\"It'll set itself going,\" said Rowsley.  \"And, though I know the\nBendishes pretty well, I really shouldn't care to tell Mrs. Jack\nnot to gossip about her own sister.  You might see your way to\nit, reverend sir, but I don't.\"\n\n\"If it came to Bernard's ears I wouldn't answer for the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"Won't Bernard see it for himself?\"\n\n\"If I thought that,\" said Val, \"if I thought that. . . .\n\n\"You couldn't interfere, old man,\" said Rowsley with a shrewd\nglance at his brother.  \"Your hands are tied.\"\n\n\"H'm: yes, that's true.\" It was much truer than Rowsley knew.  \"I\ndon't care,\" said Val, involuntarily crushing the paper in his\nhand: \"I would not let that stand in my way: I'd speak to Hyde.\"\n\n\"Are you prepared to take high ground? I can't imagine any one\nless likely to be amenable to moral suasion, unless of course\nyou're much more intimate with him than you ever let on to me.\nPerhaps you are,\" Rowsley added.  \"He certainly is interested in\nyou.\"\n\n\"Hyde is?\"\n\n\"Watches you like a cat after a mouse.  What's at the root of it,\nVal?  Is it the original obligation you spoke of?  I'm not sure\nthat I should care to be under an obligation to Hyde myself.\nHullo,  are you off?\" Val had risen, folding the newspaper,\nlaying it carefully down on his chair: in all his ways he was as\nneat as an old maid.\n\n\"I have to be at the managers' meeting by half past eight, and\nit's twenty past now.\"\n\nWatching his brother across the lawn, Rowsley cudgelled his\nbrains to account for Val's precipitate departure.  The pretext\nwas valid, for Val was always punctual, and yet it looked like a\nretreat--not to say a rout.  But what had he said to put Val to\nflight?\n\nPresent at the managers' meeting were Val, still in breeches:\nJack Bendish in a dinner jacket and black tie: Garrett the\nblacksmith, cursorily washed:  Thurlow, a leading Nonconformist\ntradesman: and Mrs. Verney the doctor's wife.  Agenda: to instruct\nthe Correspondent to requisition a new scrubbing brush for the\nInfants' School.  This done and formally entered in the Minutes by\nMrs. Verney,  the meeting resolved itself into a Committee of Ways\nand Means for getting rid of the boys' headmaster without falling\nfoul of the National Union of Teachers; but these proceedings, though\nof extreme interest to all concerned, were recorded in no Minutes.\n\nThe meeting broke up in amity and Bendish came out into the\npurple twilight, taking Val's arm.  It was gently withdrawn.\n\"Neuritis again?\"  said Jack.  \"Why don't you try massage?\" He\nalways asked the same question, and, being born to fifteen\nthousand a year, never read between the lines of Val's vague\nreply.  Val had a touch of neuritis in his injured arm two nights\nout of seven, but he could not find the shillings for his train\nfare to Salisbury, far less the fees of a professional masseuse.\nBendish, who could have settled that difficulty out of a week's\ncigar bills, would have been shocked and distressed if Val had\nowned to it, but it was beyond the scope of his imagination,\nthough he was a thoughtful young man and quietly did his best to\nprotect Val from the tax of chauffeurs and gamekeepers.  He\nunderstood that poor men cannot always find sovereigns.  But he\nreally did not know that sometimes they cannot even find\nshillings.  Tonight he said, \"I can't think why you don't get a\nwoman over to massage you,\" and then, reverting to the peccant\nmaster,  \"Brown's a nuisance.  He has a rotten influence on the\nelder boys.  He's thick with all that beastly Labour crowd, and I\nbelieve Thurlow's right about his goings on with Warner's wife,\nthough I wasn't going to say so to Thurlow. I do wish he'd do\nsomething, then we could fire him. But we don't want a row with\nthe N.U.T.\"\n\n\"You can't fire a man for his political opinions.\"\n\n\"Why not, if they're wrong?\" said Bendish placidly.\n\nHis was the creed that Labour men are so slow to understand\nbecause it is so slow to explain itself: not a blind prejudice,\nbut the reasonable faith of one who feels himself to belong to an\nhereditary officer caste for whom privilege and responsibility go\nhand in hand.  And an excellent working rule it is so long as\npractice is not divorced from theory: so long as the average\nmember of the governing class acts up to the tradition of\ngovernment, be he sachem or daimio or resident English squire.\nIt amused Val: but he admired it.\n\n\"Brown is a thorn in Jimmy's side,\" he remarked, dropping the\nimpersonal issue. \"I never in my life heard a man make such a\ndisagreeable noise on the organ. I tackled him about it last\nSunday.  He said it ciphered, but organs don't cipher in dry\nweather, so I went to look at it and found three or four keys\nglued together with candle grease.\"\n\n\"Filthy swine!  Are you coming round to Wanhope? I have to call\nin on my way home, my wife's dining there.\"\n\nVal made no reply.  \"Are you coming up or not?  You look fagged,\nVal,\" said Bendish affectionately. \"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"No: I was only wondering whether I'd get you to take a message\nfor me, but I'd better go myself.\"\n\nBendish nodded.  \"Just as you like.  Have you settled yet about\nthe Etchingham agency?\"\n\n\"No, I'm waiting for Bernard.\"\n\n\"Hope you'll see your way to accepting.  My only fear is that it\nwould throw too much work on you; you're such a conscientious beggar!\nbut of course you wouldn't do for us all the odd jobs you do for poor\nBernard.  Seems to me,\" Jack ruminated, \"the best plan would be for\nyou to have a car.  One gets about quicker like that and it wouldn't\nbe such a fag.  There's that little green Napier roadster, she'd come\nin handy if we stabled her at Nicholson's.\"  He added simply, to\nobviate any possible misunderstanding, \"Garage bills our show, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Thanks most awfully,\" said Val, accepting without false pride.\n\"I should love it, I do get tired after being in the saddle all\nday.  It would more than make up for the extra work.\"\n\nThey were crossing the Wanhope lawn as he spoke, on their way to\nthe open French windows of the parlour, gold-lit with many\ncandles against an amethyst evening sky.  Laura, in a plain black\ndress, was at the piano, the cool drenched foliage of Claude\nDebussy's rainwet gardens rustling under her magic fingers.\nBernard was talking to Mrs. Jack Bendish, for the sufficient\nreason that she disliked him and disliked talking to any one\nwhile Laura played.  Her defiant sparkle, her gipsy features, her\nslim white shoulders emerging from the brocade and sapphires of a\nsleeveless bodice cut open almost to her waist, produced the\neffect of a Carolus Duran lady come to life and threw Laura back\ninto a dimmed and tired middle age.  Jack's eyes glowed as they\ndwelt on her.  His marriage had been a trial to his family, but\nno one could deny that Yvonne had made a success of it, for Jack\nworshipped her.--Lawrence, leaning forward in his chair, his\nforehead on his hand to shield his eyes from the light, looked\nexceedingly tired, and probably was so.\n\n\"Queer chap Hyde,\" said Bendish to Val as they waited on the\ngrass for the music to finish.  \"Can't think what he's stopping\non for.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jack, for heaven's sake don't you begin on that subject!\"\n\n\"Hey?  Oh!  No, by Jove.  Seems a shame, doesn't it?\" returned\nBendish, taking the point with that rapid effortless readiness of\nhis class which made him more soothing to Val than many a\ncleverer man.  \"It all says itself, so what's the good of saying\nit?  All the same I shan't be sorry when Hyde packs his movin'\ntent a day's march nearer Jerusalem.\"  And with a casual wink at\nVal he stepped over the threshold.  His judgment, so vague and\nshrewd and sure of itself, represented probably the kindest view\nthat would be taken in Chilmark.\n\nTheir entrance broke up the gathering.  Jack carried off his\nwife, and Barry appeared to wheel Bernard away to bed.  With a\nword to Laura, Val followed the cripple to his room.  The Duke\nwas pressing for an answer, and long experience had taught Val\nthat for Bernard one time was as good as another: it was not\npossible to count on his moods.  And there was not much to be\nsaid; all pros and cons had been thrashed out before; the five\nminutes while Barry was out of the room fetching Bernard's\nindispensable hot-water bottles would give Val ample time to\nsecure Bernard's consent.--Laura had scarcely finished putting\naway her music when Val came back, humming under his breath the\njangled tune that echoes night in the streets of Granada.  Laura\nglanced at Lawrence, who had gone into the garden to smoke and\nwas passing and repassing the open window: no, he could not hear.\n\"Well, Val?\"\n\n\"Let me do that for you, shall I?\" said Val, lightly smiling, at\nher. \"Your ottoman has a heavy lid.\"\n\n\"Have you spoken to Bernard?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And it's all right?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Val, deftly flinging diamond-wise a glittering Chinese\ncloth: \"is that straight?--that is, for me.  I shan't take the\nagency.\"\n\n\"Val!\"\n\n\"Bernard agrees with me that the double work would be too heavy.\nOf course I should like the money and I'm awfully sorry to\ndisoblige Lord Grantchester and Jack, but one has one's\nlimitations, and I don't want to knock up.\"\n\n\"It is too bad--too bad of Bernard,\". said Laura, lowering her\nvoice as Lawrence lingered near the window.  \"He doesn't half\ndeserve your goodness to him.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" said Val laughing.  \"Where do these candlesticks go?  In\nmy heart of hearts I'm grateful to him.  I'm a cowardly beggar,\nLaura, and I was dreading the big financial responsibility.  Oh\nno, Bernard didn't put any pressure on me: simply offered me the\nchoice between Etchingham and Wanhope.\"\n\n\"They would pay you twice what you get from Bernard.  Oh, Val, I\nwish you would take it and throw us over!\"\n\n\"That's very unkind of you.\"\n\n\"Is this definite?\"\n\n\"Quite: Bernard had thought it well over and made up his mind.  I\nshouldn't speak to him about it if I were you.\"\n\n\"I shan't. I couldn't bear to.\"\n\n\"Bosh again--excuse me.  I must go home. Good-night, dear.\" He\nheld out his hand, wishing, in the repressed way that had become\na second nature to him, that Laura would not wring it so warmly\nand so long.  In the first bitterness of disappointment--so much\nthe keener for his unlucky confidence to Rowsley--Val could not\nstand sympathy.  Not even from Laura?  Least of all from Laura.\nHe nodded to her with a bright careless smile and went out into\nthe night.\n\nBut he had still one more mission to perform before he could go\nhome to break the bad news to Rowsley: a trying mission under\nwhich Val fretted in repressed distaste. He came up to Lawrence\nholding out the gold cigarette case.  \"You dropped this at our\nplace when you were talking to my sister this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" Lawrence slipped it into his pocket. His manner was\nperfectly calm.  \"Thanks so much.--I hadn't missed it.\"  He had\nno fear of having been betrayed, in essentials, by Isabel.\n\n\"I don't want to offend you,\" Val continued with his direct\nsimplicity of manner, \"but perhaps you hardly realize how young\nmy sister is.\"\n\n\"Some one said she was nineteen, but why?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you said to her, probably nothing of the\nslightest consequence, but she's only a child, and you managed to\nupset her.  To be frank, I didn't want her to see any one this\nafternoon.  Oh, she's all right, but her arm has run her up a bit\nof a temperature, and Verney wants her to keep quiet for a few\ndays.  It'll give her an excuse to keep clear of the inquest too.\nThis sounds ungrateful as well as ungracious, when we owe you so\nmuch, but there's no ingratitude in it, only common sense.\"\n\n\"Oh, damn your common sense!\" exclaimed Lawrence.\n\nIt was as laconic a warning-off as civility allowed: and it\nirritated Lawrence beyond bearing to be rebuked by young\nStafford, whose social life stood in his danger, whom he could at\npleasure strip to universal crucifying shame.  But there was\nneither defiance nor fear in Val: tranquil and unpretentious, in\nhis force of character he reminded Lawrence of Laura Clowes.  She\ntoo had been attacked once or twice that evening by her husband,\nand Lawrence had admired the way in which she either foiled or\nevaded the rapier point, or took it to her bosom without\nflinching.  This same silken courage, it seemed, Val also\npossessed.  Both would stand up to a blow with the same grave\ndignity and--perhaps--secret scorn.\n\nMinutes passed.  Val waited because he chose not to be the first\nto break silence, Lawrence because he was absorbing fresh\nimpressions with that intensity which wipes out time and place.\nHe was in the mood to receive them: tired, softened, and\nquickened, from the tears of the afternoon.  After all Val was\nIsabel's brother and possessed Isabel's eyes!  This drew Lawrence\nto him by a double cord: practically, because it is inconvenient\nto be on bad terms with one's brother-in-law, and mystically,\nbecause in his profound romantic passion he loved whatever was\nassociated with her, down to the very sprig of honeysuckle that\nshe had pinned into his coat.  But for this cord his relations\nwith Stafford would have begun and ended in a casual regret for\nthe casual indulgence of a cruel impulse.  But Isabel's brother\nhad ex officio a right of entry into Hyde's private life, and,\nthe doors once opened, he was dazed by the light that Val let in.\n\nIt was after ten o'clock and dews were falling, falling from a\nclear night.  \"One faint eternal eventide of gems,\" beading the\ndark turf underfoot and the pale faces of roses that had bloomed\nall day in sunshine: now prodigal of scent only they hung their\nheads like ghosts of flowers among dark glossy leaves.  Stars\nhung sparkling on the dark field of heaven, stars threw down\ntheir spears on the dark river fleeting to the star-roofed\ndistant Channel.  Stream and grass and leaf-buds were ephemeral\nand eternal, ever passing and ever renewed, old as the stars, or\nthe waste ether in which they range: the green, sappy stem, the\ndew-bead that hung on it, the shape of a ripple were the same now\nas when Nineveh was a queen of civilization and men's flesh was\nreddening alive in osier cages over altar fires on Wiltshire\ndowns. And all the sweetness, all the romance of an English\nmidsummer night seized the heart of Lawrence, a nomad, a returned\nexile, and a man in love--as if he had never known England\nbefore.\n\nOr her inhabitants either!  Lawrence, without country, creed,\nprofession, or territorial obligation, was one of those sons of\nrich men who form, in any social order, its loosest and most\nself-centred class.  In his set, frank egoism was the only motive\nfor which one need not apologize.  But in Chilmark it was not\nso. Far other forces were in play in the lives of the Stafford\nfamily, and Laura Clowes, and Lord Grantchester and his wife and\nJack Bendish.  What were these forces?  Lawrence thought in\nflashes, by imagery, scene after scene flitting before him out of\nthe last forty-eight hours.  Homespun virtues: unselfishness,\nindifference to money values, the constant sense of filial,\nfraternal, social responsibility . . . the glow in Jack's eyes\nwhen they rested on his wife: Verney's war on cesspools: Leverton\nMorley as scoutmaster: the Chinese lecture: rosebushes in the\nchurchyard, by the great stone cross with its list of names\nbeginning \"George Potts, Wiltshire Rifles, aged 49,\" and ending\n\"Robert Denis Bendish, Grenadier Guards, aged 19: Into Thy Hands,\nO Lord\": old, old feudal England, closeknit, no pastoral of easy\nvirtues, yet holding together in a fellowship which underlies\nclass disunion: whose sons, from days long before the Conquest,\nhave always desired to go to sea when the cuckoo sang, and to\ncome home again when they were tired of the hail and salt\nshowers, because they could not bear to be landless and lordless\nmen. . . .\n\n[Footnote]\n\n     \"Swylce geac mona geomran reorde, singe sumeres\n     weard, sorge beade bittre in breosthord; pset se\n     beorn ne wat, secg esteadig, hwset pa sume dreoga,\n     pe pa wrseclastas widost lecga! . . . . pince him\n     on mode pset he his monndryhten clyppe and cysse\n     andon cneo lecge honda and heafod; ponne onwsecne,\n     gesihp him beforan fealwe wegas, bapian brimfuglas.\"\n\n     \"Even so the cuckoo warns him with its sad voice,\n     Summer's warden sings foreboding sorrow, bitter grief\n     of heart.  Little knows the prosperous fellow what\n     others are doing who follow far and wide the tracks\n     of exile . . . Then dreams the seafarer that he clasps\n     his lord and kisses him, and on his knee lays hand and\n     head; but he awakes and sees before him the fallow\n     waterways and the sea-fowls bathing.\"\n\n[End of Footnote]\n\n\nLawrence flung off the impression with a jerk of his shoulders,\nas if it were a physical weight.  It was too heavy to be endured.\nNot even to marry Isabel was he going to impose on his own\nunbroken egoism the restricting code of a country village.\n\n\"You are a dreamer, Val!  Why don't you throw over Bernard and\ntake the Etchingham agency?  Yes, I heard every word you said to\nLaura: you made a gallant effort, but the facts speak for\nthemselves, and your terminological inexactitudes wouldn't\ndeceive a babe at the breast.  Bernard pays you 300 pounds a year\nand orders you about like a groom, Grautchester would give you\nsix and behave like a gentleman.  But no, you must needs stick to\nBernard, though you never get any thanks for it!  You're an\nunpractical dreamer.\"\n\n\"I don't know what on earth you're talking about.\"\n\n\"And you're all in it together, damn you!\"  Lawrence broke out\nwith an angry laugh.  \"It's all equally picturesque--feudal's\nthe word!  I never knew anything like it in my life and I\nwouldn't have believed it could continue to exist.  What do you\ndo with gipsies?  evict 'em, I suppose.\"  He flung a second\nquestion at Val which made the son of a vicarage knit his brows.\n\n\"As a matter of fact there's a house in Brook Lane about which\nBendish and I are a good deal exercised in our minds at the\npresent moment . . . and the percentage of children born too soon\nafter marriage is disastrous.    You're all out, Hyde.  Nothing\ncould be more commonplace than Chilmark, believe me: life is like\nthis all over rural England, and it's only from a distance that\none takes it for Arcadia.\"\n\n\"Folly,\" said Lawrence.  \"Good God, why should you exercise your\nsimple minds over the house in Brook Lane?  Ah! because the men\nwho go to it are your own men, and the parsonage and the Castle\nare answerable for their souls.\" Val, irritated, suggested that\nif Hyde's forebears had lived in Chilmark since the time when\nevery freeman had to swear fealty, laying his hands between the\nknees of his lord, Hyde might have shared this feeling.  \"But\nthey didn't,\" said Lawrence, drily. \"My grandfather was a\npawnbroker in the New Cut.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you're hardly in a position to judge.\"\n\n\"Judge? I don't judge, my good fellow--I'm lost in admiration!\nIn an age of materialism it's refreshing to come across these\nsimple, homespun virtues. I didn't know there was a man left in\nEngland that would exist, for choice, on three hundred a year.\nAre you always content with your rustic ideals, Val?  Haven't you\nany ambition?\"\n\n\"I?\" said Val.\n\n\"'Carry me out of the fight,'\" quoted Lawrence under his breath.\n\"I swear I forgot.\"\n\nSilence fell again, the silence on Lawrence's part of continual\nconflict and adjustment, and on Val's mainly of irritation.\nLawrence talked too much and too loosely, and was over-given to\ndamning what he disliked--a trick that went with his rings and\nhis diamond monogram.  Val was not interested in a townsman's\namateur satire; in so far as Lawrence was not satirical, he had\nprobably drunk one glass more of Bernard's' champagne than was\ngood for him!  In the upshot, Val was less disinclined to credit\nRowsley than half an hour ago.\n\nLawrence roused himself.  \"About your sister: I was sorry\nafterwards to have stayed so long.  She seemed none the worse for\nit at the time, but no doubt she ought to keep quiet for a bit.\nWill you make my excuses to her?\"\n\n\"I will with pleasure.\"\n\n\"And will you allow me to tackle Bernard about the agency?\"\n\n\"To--?\"\n\n\"If you won't resent my interfering? I can generally knock some\nsense into Bernard's head.  It's an iniquitous thing that he\nshould take advantage of your generosity, Val.\"\n\nStafford was completely taken by surprise.  \"I'd rather--it's\nmost awfully kind of you,\" he stammered, \"but I couldn't trespass\non your kindness--\"\n\n\"Kindness, nonsense!  Bernard's my cousin: if your services are\nworth more in the open market than he pays you, it's up to me to\nsee he doesn't fleece you.  Otherwise you might ultimately chuck\nup your job, and where should we be then?  In the soup: for he'd\nnever get another man of your class--a gentleman--to put up\nwith the rough side of his tongue.  No: he must be brought to\nbook: if you'll allow me?\"\n\nVal's disposition was to refuse; it was odious to him to accept a\nfavour from Hyde.  But pride is one of the luxuries that poor men\ncannot afford. \"I should be most grateful.  Thank you very much.\"\n\n\"And now go to bed: you're tired and so am I.  I've had the devil\nof a hard day.\" He stretched himself, raising his wrists to the\nlevel of his shoulders, luxuriously tense under the closefitting\ncoat. \"I shall hope to see your sister again after the inquest.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Val, hesitating: \"are you staying on, then?\"\n\n\"As you advised.\"\n\n\"You'll be very bored.\"\n\n\"No, I've fallen in love.\" Val gave a perceptible start.  \"With\nthe country,\" Lawrence explained with a merry laugh.  \"Rustic\nideals. Don't misjudge me, I beg: I have no designs on Mrs.\nBendish.\"\n\n\"Hyde . . .\n\n\"Well, my dear Val?\"\n\n\"Give me back my parole.\"\n\n\"Not  I.\"\n\n\"You're unjust and ungenerous,\" said Val with repressed passion.\n\"But I warn you that I shall interfere none the less to protect\nothers if necessary.  Good-night.\"\n\nLawrence watched him across the lawn with a bewildered\nexpression.  But he forgot him in a minute--or remembered him\nonly in the association with Isabel which brought Val into the\nradius of his good will.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\"Hadow's bringing out a new play,\" remarked Lawrence, looking up\nfrom the Morning Post.  \"A Moore comedy, They're clever stuff,\nMoore's comedies: always well written, and well put on when Hadow\nhas a hand in it.  You never were a playgoer, Bernard.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Bernard Clowes.  He and his guest were smoking\ntogether in the hall after breakfast, Lawrence imparting items of\nnews from the Morning Post, while Bernard, propped up in a\nsitting attitude on the latest model of invalid couch, turned\nover and sorted on a swing table a quantity of curios mainly in\ncopper, steel, and iron.  Both swing-table and couch had been\nbought in London by Lawrence, and to his vigorous protests it was\nalso due that the great leaved doors were thrown wide to the\namber sunshine: while the curios came out of one of his Eastern\npacking-cases, which he had had unpacked by Gaston for Bernard to\ntake what he liked.  Lawrence's instincts were acquisitive, not\nto say predatory.  Wherever he went he amassed native treasures\nwhich seemed to stick to his fingers, and which in nine cases out\nof ten, thanks to his racial tact, would have fetched at\nChristie's more than he gave for them.  Coming fresh from foreign\nsoil, they were a godsend to Bernard, who was weary of collecting\nfrom collectors' catalogues.  \"Can I have this flint knife?\nEgyptian, isn't it?  Oh, thanks awfully, I'm taking all the\nbest.\"  This was true.  But Lawrence, like most of his nation,\ngave freely when he gave at all.  \"No, I never was one for plays\nexcept Gilbert and Sullivan and the 'Merry Widow' and things like\nthat with catchy tunes in 'em.  Choruses.\"  He gave a reminiscent\nlaugh.\n\n\"Legs?\" suggested Lawrence.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Bernard, winking at him.  \"Oh damn!\"  A mechanical\njerk of his own legs had tilted the table and sent the knife\nrolling on the floor.  Lawrence picked it up for him, drew his\nfeet down, and tucked a rug over his hips.\n\n\"Mind that box of Burmese darts, old man, they're poisoned.--  I\nused to be an inveterate first-nighter.  Still am, in fact, when\nI'm in or near town.  I can sit out anything from 'Here We Are\nAgain' to 'Samson Agonistes.' To be frank, I rather liked\n'Samson':  it does one's ears good to listen to that austere,\ndelicate English.\"\n\n\"How long would these take to polish one off?\"\n\n\"Ten or twelve hours, chiefly in the form of a hoop.  No, Berns,\nI can't recommend them.\" He drew from its jewelled sheath and put\ninto Bernard's hands a Persian dagger nine inches long, the naked\nblade damascened in wavy ripplings and slightly curved from point\nto hilt.  \"That would do your trick better.  Under the fifth rib.\nI bought it of a Greek muleteer, God knows how he got hold of it,\nbut he was a bit of a poet: he assured me it would go in 'as soft\nas a kiss.' For its softness I cannot speak, but it is as sharp\nas a knife need be.\"\n\n\"Sharper,\" said Bernard, his thumb in his mouth.\n\n\"You silly ass, I warned you!--  I should rather like to see this\nMoore play.  I suppose Laura never goes, as you don't?\"\n\n\"I don't stop her going, as you jolly well know.  She's welcome\nto go six nights a week if she likes.\"\n\n\"She couldn't very well go alone,\" Lawrence ignored the scowl of\nhis host.  \"Tell you what: suppose I took her tonight?  I could\nrun her up and down in my car, or we could get back by the\nmidnight train.  Would the feelings of Chilmark be outraged?\"\n\n\"What business is it of Chilmark's?  If I'm complaisant, that's\nenough,\" said Bernard, his features relaxing into a broad grin.\n\"I may be planked down in a country village for the rest of my\nvery unnatural life, but I'll be shot if I'll regulate mine or my\nwife'& behaviour by the twaddle they talk!  I'll have that\ndagger.\"  Slipping it slowly into its sheath he watched it travel\nhome, the supple female curve gliding and yielding as a woman\nyields to a man's caress.  \"Voluptuous, I call it.  Under the\nleft breast, eh?\"  He drew it again and held it poised and\npointing at his cousin.  \"Come, even I could cut your heart out\nwith a gem of a blade like that.\" Lawrence held himself lightly\nerect, his big frame stiffening from head to foot and the pupils\nof his eyes dilating till the irids were blackened.  \"Call\nLaura.\"  Bernard sheathed the dagger again and laid it down.\n\"She's out there snipping away at the roses.  Why can't she leave\n'em to Parker?  She's always messing about out there dirtying her\nhands, and then she comes in and paws me.  Call her in.\"\n\nLawrence escaped into the sunshine.  He had not liked that moment\nwhen Bernard had held up the dagger, nor was it the first time\nthat Bernard had made him shiver, but these vague apprehensions\nsoon faded in the open air.  It was a sallow sunshine, a light\nwind was blowing, and the lawn was spun over with brilliancies of\ngossamer and flecked with yellow leaflets of acacia and lime.\nLittle light clouds floated overhead, sun-smitten to a fiery\nwhiteness, or curling in gold and silver surf over the grey of\ndistant hayfields.  In the borders the velvet bodies of bees hung\nbetween the velvet petals, ruby-red, of dahlias.  There had been\nno frost, and yet a foreboding of frost was in the air, a\nsparkle, a sting--enough to have braced Lawrence when he went\ndown to bathe before breakfast, standing stripped amid long\nriver-herbage drenched in dew, a west wind striking cold on his\nwet limbs: sensations exquisite so long as the blood of health\nand manhood glowed under the chilled skin!  It was early autumn.\n\n\nTime slips away fast in a country village, and Lawrence remained\na welcome guest at Wanhope, where Chilmark said--though with a\ncovert smile--that Captain Hyde had done his cousin a great deal\nof good.  Bernard was better behaved with Lawrence than with any\none else, less surly, less unsociable, less violently coarse:\nsince June there had been fewer quarrels with Val and Barry and\nthe servants, and less open incivility to Laura.  He had even\nlet Laura give a few mild entertainments, arrears of hospitality\nwhich she was glad to clear off: and he had appeared at them in\nperson, polite and well dressed, and on the friendliest terms\nwith his cousin and his wife.\n\nLawrence knew his own mind now.  It was because he knew it that\nhe held his hand: meeting Isabel two or three times a week,\nentering into the life of the little place because it was her\nlife, fighting Val's battle with Bernard--and winning it--\nbecause Val was her brother.  When he remembered his collapse he\nwas not abashed: shame was an emotion which he rarely felt: but\nhe had gone too far and too fast, and was content to mark time in\na more rational and conventional courtship.\n\nBut a courtship under the rose, for before others he hid his love\nlike a crime, treating Isabel as good humoured elderly men treat\npretty children.   Where the astringent memory of Lizzie came\ninto play, Lawrence was dumb.  The one aspect of that fiasco\nwhich he had not fully confessed to Isabel--though only because\nit was not then prominent in his mind--was its scorching, its\nlacerating effect on his pride.  But for it he would probably\nhave flung discretion to the winds, confided in Laura, in\nBernard, in Val, pursued Isabel with a hot and headstrong\nimpetuosity: but it had left the entire tract of sex in him one\nseared and branded scar.\n\nEven when they were alone together, which rarely happened--Val\nsaw to that--he had as yet made no open love to her: it was\ndifficult to do so when one was never secure from interruption\nfor ten minutes together.  Of late he had begun to chafe against\nVal's cobweb barriers.  Three months is a long time! and patience\nwas not a virtue that came natural to Lawrence Hyde.\n\nHe found Laura cutting off dead roses, a sufficiently harmless\noccupation, one would have thought: a trifle thinner, a trifle\npaler than when he came: and were those grey threads in her brown\nhair?\n\n\"Berns wants you,\" said Lawrence.  \"I've done such an awful\nthing,  Laura--\"\n\nAgain that flash of imperfect perception!  What was going on\nunder the surface at Wanhope, that Laura should turn as white as\nher handkerchief?   He hurried on as if he had noticed nothing.\n\"Bernard and I have been laying our heads together.  Do you know\nwhat I'm going to do?  Run you up to town to see the new Moore\nplay at Hadow's.\"\n\n\"Delightful!\" Already Laura had recovered herself: her smile was\nas sweet as ever, and as serene.  \"Was it your idea or Bernard's?\"\n\n\"Mine. . . I say, Laura: Bernard is all right, isn't he?\"\n\n\"In what way, all right?\"\n\nLawrence reddened, regretting his indiscretion.  \"I've fancied\nhis manner queer, once or twice.\"\n\n\"There is a close connection, of course, between the spine and\nthe brain,\" said Laura quietly.  \"But my husband is perfectly\nsane. . . . Oh my dear Lawrence, of course I forgive you! what is\nthere to forgive? I only wish I could come tonight, but I'm\nafraid it can't be managed--\"\n\n\"She says it can't be managed,\" said Lawrence,  standing aside\nfor Laura to pass in.  \"Pitch into her, Bernard.  Hear her talk\nlike a woman of sixty!  Are you frightened of the night air,\nLaura?  Or would Chilmark chatter?\"\n\n\"It might, if you and I went alone,\" Laura smiled.\n\n\"Make up a party then,\" suggested Lawrence.  \"Get the Bendishes\nto come too.\"\n\nShe shook her head.  \"They're dining with the Dean.\"\n\n\"And decanal dinner-parties can't be thrown over.\"  When he made\nthe suggestion, Lawrence had known that the Bendishes were dining\nwith the Dean.  \"Some one else, then.\"\n\n\"Whom could I ask like this at the last moment?   No, I won't\ngo--thank you all the same.  I'm not so keen on late hours and\nlong train journeys as I used to be.  Go by yourself and you can\ntell us all about it afterwards.  Berns and I shall enjoy that as\nmuch as seeing it ourselves.  Shan't we, Berns?\"  Clowes gave a\nshort laugh: he could not have expressed his opinion more clearly\nif he had called his wife a fool to her face.\n\n\"You weren't so particular before you married me, my love.  When\nyou ran that French flat with Yvonne you jolly well knew how to\namuse yourself.\"\n\n\"Girls do many things before they're married,\" said Laura\nvaguely.  \"I know better now.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know a lot.  She ought to go, Lawrence. It'll do her\ngood.  Now you shall go, my dear, that's flat.\"\n\nLawrence began to wish he had held his tongue.  He had his own\nends to serve, but, to do him justice, he had not meant to serve\nthem at Laura's expense.  But he had still his trump card to\nplay. \"Surely we could find a chaperon?\" he said gently, ignoring\nBernard. \"What about the Staffords?  Hardly in Val's line,\nperhaps.  But the child--little Miss Isabel--won't she do?\"\n\nTo his relief, Laura's eyes lit up with pleasure.  \"Isabel? I\nnever thought of her!  Yes, she would love to come!--But, if she\ndoes, she must come as my guest.  You would never have asked her\nof your own accord, and the Staffords are so proud, I'm sure Val\nwouldn't like you to pay for her.\"  Again Bernard's short,\nsardonic laugh translated the silence of his cousin's constraint\nand dismay.\n\n\"Hark to her!  I'll sort her for you, Lawrence.  She shall go,\nand you shall be paymaster.  Yes, and for the Stafford brat too.\nLawrence and I don't understand these modern manners, my dear.\nWhen we take a pretty woman out we like to do the treating.  Now\ncut along and see about the tickets, Lawrence.  You can 'phone\nfrom the post office.\"\n\nLawrence had secured a box ten days ago, but he strolled out,\nthinking that the husband and wife might understand each other\nbetter when alone.  As soon as he was out of earshot Bernard\nturned on Laura and seized her by the wrist, his features\naltering, their sardonic mask recast in deep lines of hate.\n\"Why wouldn't you go up alone?  That's what he wanted.  Why have\nyou saddled him with the little Stafford girl?  You can't take\nher to dine in a private room.\"\n\n\"It was because I foresaw this that I refused.  Why do you\ntorment yourself by forcing me to go?\"\n\n\"I?  What do I care?  Do you think I should shed many tears if\nyou walked out of the house and never came back?  Think I don't\nknow he's your lover? you're uncommonly circumspect with your\nstable door! . . . A woman like you! Look here.\" He picked up the\nPersian dagger.  \"See it? That's been used before. I should like\nto use it on you. I should like to cut your tongue out with it.\nDon't be afraid, I'm not going to stab you.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" said his wife with her serene ironical smile.   \"My\ndear Bernard, you tempt me to wish you were.\"\n\n\"Oh, not before tonight.  Jolly time you'll have tonight, you and\nLawrence . . . I can only trust you'll respect the Stafford\nchild's innocence.\"\n\n\"Bernard!  Bernard!\"\n\n\"Don't you Bernard me.  You can't take me in. Stop.  Where are\nyou off to now?\"\n\n\"To tell Lawrence not to get the tickets.  I shan't go with him.\"\n\n\"You will go with him,\" said Bernard Clowes, his fingers\ntightening on her wrist.  \"Stop here: come closer.\" He locked his\narm round her waist. \"Is he your lover yet, Lally?  Tell me: I\nswear I won't kill you if you do.  Are you on the borderland of\nvirtue still, or over it?\"\n\n\"Let me go,\" said Laura, panting for breath under his clenched\ngrip.  \"I will not answer such questions.  You know you don't\nmean one word of them.  Take care, you're tearing my blouse.  Oh,\nthat frightful war! what has it done to you, to turn you from the\nman I married into what you are?\"\n\n\"What am I?\"\n\n\"A madman, or not far off it.  End this horrible life: send him\naway.  It's killing me, and as for you, if you were sane enough\nto understand what you're doing, you would blow your brains out.\"\n\n\"Likely enough,\" said Bernard Clowes.\n\nHe let her go.  \"Come back to me now, Laura.\"  His wife leant\nover him, unfaltering, though she had known for some time that\nshe was dealing with the abnormal.  \"Kiss me.\" Laura touched his\nlips.  \"That's better, old girl.  I am a cross-grained devil and\nI make your life a hell to you, don't I?  But don't--don't leave\nme.  Don't chuck me over.  Let me have your love to cling to.  I\ndon't believe in God, I don't believe in any other man, often\nenough I don't believe in myself, I feel, I feel unreal . . . .\"\nHe stopped, shut his eyes, moved his head on the pillow, and felt\nabout over his rug with the blind groping hands of a delirious,\nalmost of a dying man.  Laura gathered them up and held them to\nher heart.  \"That's better,\" said Bernard, his voice gaining\nstrength as he opened his eyes on the beautiful still face bent\nover him.  \"Just now and again, in my lucid moments, I do--I do\nbelieve in you, old girl.  You are just the one thing I have\nleft.  You won't forsake me, will you, ever? not whatever I do to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Never, my darling.\"\n\n\"Seems a bit one-sided, that bargain,\" said Bernard.\n\nHe lay perfectly still for a little while, his great hands softly\npressed against his wife's firm breast.\n\n\"And now get your hat and trot up to the village with Lawrence.\nYes, I should like you to go tonight.  It'll do you good.  Give\nyou a breath of fresh air after your extra dose of sulphur.  Yes,\nyou shall take Isabel.  Then you'll be safe: I can't insult you\nif you and Lawrence weren't alone.   Now run along, I've had\nenough emotions.  But don't forget.  Laura,\" he spoke thickly and\nwith effort, turning his head away as he pushed her from him\n\"yes, get out, I've had enough of you for the present--but don't\nforget all the same that you're the one thing on earth that ever\nis real to me.\"\n\nIsabel was up a ladder in the orchard picking plums.  Waving her\nhand to Laura and Lawrence Hyde, she called out to them to look\nthe other way while she came down.  It must be owned that neither\nLaura nor Lawrence obeyed her, and they were rewarded, while she\nfelt about for the top rung, with an unimpeded view of two very\npretty legs.  Lawrence really thought she was going to fall out\nof the tree, but eventually she came safe to earth, and\napproached holding out a basket full of glowing fruit.  \"Though\nyou don't deserve them,\" she said reproachfully, \"because I could\nfeel you looking at me.  I did think I should be safe at this\nhour in the morning!\"\n\n\"Do I see Val?\" said Laura, screwing up her eyes to peer in\nthrough the slats of the green jalousies.  \"I'll go and talk him\nround, while you break the news to Miss Stafford.  Such do's,\nIsabel! You don't know what dissipations are in store for you, if\nonly Val will say yes.\"  She like every one else elevated Val to\nthe parental dignity vice Mr. Stafford deposed.\n\n\n\"He's come in for some lunch.  He'll love to have you watch him\neat,\" said Isabel.  \"What's it to be, Captain Hyde?  A picnic?\"\n\nIsabel's imagination had never soared beyond a picnic.  When\nLawrence unfolded the London scheme her eyes grew round with\nastonishment and an awed silence fell on her.  \"Oh, it won't\nhappen,\" she said, when she had recovered sufficiently to reply\nat all.  \"Nothing so angelically wonderful ever would happen to\nme.  I'm perfectly certain Val will say no.  Now we've settled\nthat, you can tell me all about it, because of course you and\nLaura will go in any case.\"\n\n\"But that's precisely what we can't do.\" Gently and imperceptibly\nLawrence impelled her through the rose archway into the kitchen\ngarden, where they were partly sheltered behind the walls of\nlilacs, a little thinner than they had been in June but still an\neffective screen.  He had not found himself alone with Isabel for\nten days. Since Val was with Laura, Lawrence drew the rather\ncynical conclusion that he could count on a breathing space, and\nhe wondered if Isabel too were glad of it. She was in a brown\ncotton dress, her right sleeve still tucked up high on her bare\narm: a rounded slender arm not much tanned even at the wrist, for\nher skin was almost impervious to sunburn.  Above the elbow it\nwas milk-white with a faint bloom on it, in texture not like\nivory, which is a dead, cold, and polished material, but like a\nflower petal, one of those flowers that have a downy sheen on\nthem,  white hyacinths or tall lilies. Lawrence fixed his eyes on\nit unconsciously but so steadily that Isabel became aware of his\nadmiration.  She blushed and was going to pull down her sleeve,\nbut checked herself, and turning a little away, so that she could\npretend not to know that he was looking at her, raised her arm to\nsmooth her hair, lifting it and pushing a loosened hairpin into\nplace. After all . . . This was Isabel's first venture into\ncoquetry.  But it was half unconscious.\n\n\"Why can't you? oh, I suppose people would be silly.  Major\nClowes himself is silly enough for anything.  Oh, I'm so sorry,\nI always forget he's your cousin!  Is that why you want me to\ngo?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"Never mind, you'll soon find some one else.  What\nplay is it?\"\n\n\"'She Promised to Marry.'\"\n\n\"Oh ah, yes: that's by Moore, who wrote 'The Milkmaid' and\n'Sheddon, M.P.' I've read some of his things.  I liked them so, I\nmade Rowsley give me them for my last birthday.  They're quite\ncheap in brown paper. O! dear, I should love to see one of them\non the stage!\" Isabel gave a great sigh.  \"A London stage too!\nI've never been to a theatre except in Salisbury.  And Hadow's is\nthe one to go to, isn't it?  Where they play the clever plays\nthat aren't tiresome.  Who's acting tonight?\"\n\n\"Madeleine Wild and Peter Sennet.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen them?\"\n\n Lawrence laughed outright.  \"I was at their wedding.  Madeleine\nis half French: I knew her first when she was singing in a cafe\nchantant on the Champs Elysees.  She is dark and pretty and Peter\nis fair and pretty, and Peter is the deadliest poker player that\never scored off an American train crook.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Isabel with a second sigh that nearly blew her away,\n\"how I should love to know actors and actresses and people who\nplay poker!  It must make Life so intensely interesting!\"\n\nBehind her badinage was she half in earnest?  Lawrence's eye\nranged over the old pale walls of the vicarage, on which the\nclimbing roses were already beginning to redden their leaves:\nover the lavender borders: over the dry pale turf underfoot and\nthe silver and brown of the Plain, burnt by a hot summer.  The\nfruit that had been green in June was ripe now, and down the\nPainted-Lady apple-trees fell such a cascade of ruby and\ncoral-coloured apples, from high sprig to heavy bole, that they\nlooked like trees in a Kate Greenaway drawing.  But there was no\nother change.  Life at Chilmark flowed on uneventful from day to\nday.  He did not admonish Isabel to be content with it.  \"Should\nyou like to live in Chelsea?\"\n\nIsabel shut her eyes.  \"I should like fifteen thousand a year and\na yacht.  Don't tell Jimmy, it would break his heart.  He says\nmoney is a curse. But he's not much of a judge, dear angel,\nbecause he's never had any.  What's your opinion--you're rich,\naren't you?  Has it done you any harm?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am a fairly decent sort of fellow as men go.\"\n\n\"But would you be a nobler character if you were poor?\" Isabel\nasked, pillowing her round chin on her palm and examining\nLawrence apparently in a spirit of scientific enquiry.  \"Because\nthat is Jimmy's theory, and merely to say that you're noble now\ndoesn't meet the case.  Do you do good with your money?\"\n\n\"No fear! I encourage trade.  I've never touched second rate\nstuff in my life.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are different!\" Isabel exclaimed.  They had been using\nwords for counters, to mean at once less and more than they said,\nbut under his irony she penetrated to a hard material egoism, as\nswiftly as he had detected in her the eternal unrest of youth.\n\"Val was right.\"\n\n\"What saith the Gospel according to St. Val?\"\n\n\"That you were only a bird of passage.\"\n\n Lawrence waited a moment before replying.  \"Birds of passage\nhave their mating seasons.\"  Once more Isabel, not knowing what\nto make of this remark, let it alone.  \"But I should like to\npossess Val's good opinion.  What have I done to offend him?\nCan't you give me any tips?\"\n\n\"It isn't so much what you do as what you are. Val's very, very\nEnglish.\"\n\n\"But what am I?\"\n\n\"Foreign,\" said Isabel simply.\n\n\"A Jew?  Yes, I knew I should have that prejudice to live down.\nBut I'm not a hall-marked Israelite, am I? After all I'm half\nEnglish by birth and wholly so by breeding.\" Isabel was betrayed\ninto an involuntary and fleeting smile.  \"Hallo! what's this?\"\n\n\"Oh, Captain Hyde--\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"No: it's the tiniest trifle, and besides I've no right.\"\n\n\"Ask me anything you like, I give you the right.\"\n\nIsabel blushed.  \"You must be descended from Jephthah!--  O! dear,\nI didn't mean that!\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Lawrence, unable to help laughing.  \"My\nfeelings are not sensitive.  But do finish--you fill me with\ncuriosity.  What shibboleth do I fail in?\"\n\nFaithful are the wounds of a friend.  \"Englishmen don't wear\njewellery,\" murmured Isabel apologetic.\n\n\"Sac a papier!\" said Lawrence.  \"My rings?\"\n\n He stretched out his hand, a characteristic hand, strong and\nflexible, but soft from idleness and white from Gaston's daily\nattentions: a diamond richly set in a cluster of diamonds and\nemeralds sparkled on the second finger, and a royal turquoise\nfrom Iran, an immense stone the colour of the Mediterranean in\nApril, on the third.  \"Does Val object to them?  Certainly Val\nis very English.  My pocket editions of beauty!  That diamond was\npresented by one of the Rothschilds in gratitude for the help old\nHyde-and-seek gave him in getting together his collection of\nearly English watercolours: as for the other, it never ought to\nhave left the Persian treasury, and there'd have been trouble in\nthe royal house if my father had worn it at the Court.   Have you\never seen such a blue?  On a dull railway journey I can sit and\nwatch those stones by the hour together.  But Val would rather\nread the Daily Mail\"\n\n\"Every one laughs at them: Jack and Lord Grantchester, and even\nJimmy.\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Lawrence, taking off the rings:--not visibly\nnettled, but a trifle regretful.\n\nIsabel knit her brows.  \"Can a thing be very beautiful and\nhistoric, and yet not in good taste?--  It can if it's out of\nharmony: that's what the Greeks never forgot.  Men ought not to\nlook effeminate--  Oh! O Captain Hyde, don't!\"\n\nLawrence, standing up, had with one powerful smooth drive of the\narm sent both rings skimming over the borders, under the apple\ntrees, over the garden wall, to scatter and drop on the open\nmoor. \"And here comes Mrs. Clowes, so now I shall learn my fate.\nI thought Val would not leave us long together.--  Well, Val, what\nis it to be?  May the young lady come?\"\n\nIsabel also sprang up, changing from woman to child as Lawrence\nchanged from deference to patronage.  Their manner to each other\nwhen alone was always different from their manner before an\naudience.  But this change, deliberate in Lawrence, had hitherto\nbeen instinctive and almost unconscious in Isabel.  It was not so\nnow, she fled to Val and to her younger self for refuge.  What a\nfanfaronade!  Why couldn't Captain Hyde have put the rings in his\npocket?  But no, it must all be done with an air--and what an\nair!  Rings worth thousands--historic mementoes--stripped off\nand tossed away to please--!  And at that Isabel, enchanted and\nterrified, bundled the entire dialogue into the cellars of her\nmind and locked the doors on it.  Later,--later,--when one was\nalone!  \"Oh, Val, say I may go!\" she cried, clasping her hands on\nVal's arm, so cool and firm amid a spinning world.\n\n[Footnote]\n\nWhat actually happened later that afternoon was that Isabel, who\nhad a practical mind, spent three-quarters of an hour on the moor\nhunting for the rings.  The turquoise she found, conspicuous on a\npatch of smooth turf: the other was never recovered.\n\n[End of Footnote]\n\n\"You may,\" said Val laughing.  He disliked the scheme, but was\nincapable of refusing Laura Clowes: he gave her Isabel as he would\nhave given her the last drops of his blood, if she had asked for them\nin that low voice of hers, and with those sweet eyes that never\nseemed to anticipate refusal.  There are women--not necessarily the\nmost beautiful of their sex--to whom men find it hard to refuse\nanything.  And, consenting, it was not in Val to consent with an ill\ngrace.  \"Certainly you may, if Captain Hyde is kind enough to take\nyou!\"  Stafford's lips, finely cut and sensitive, betrayed the\nsarcastic sense of humour which he ruled out of his voice: perhaps\nthe less said about kindness the better!  \"But do look over her\nwardrobe first, Laura: I'm never sure whether Isabel is grown up or\nnot, but she could hardly figure at Hadow's in her present easy-going\nkit--\"\n\nHe stopped, because Isabel was trying to waltz him round the\nlawn. In her reaction from a deeper excitement, she was as\nexcited as a child.  She released Val soon and hugged Laura\nClowes instead, while Lawrence, looking on with his wintry smile,\nwondered whether she would have extended the same civility to him\nif she had known how much he desired it. . . . There were moments\nwhen he hated Isabel.  Was she never going to grow up?\n\nNot at present, apparently.  \"What must I wear, Laura?  Do people\nwear evening dress?  Where shall we sit?  What time shall we get\nback?  How are you going?  What time must I be ready?  Will you\nhave dinner before you go or take sandwiches with you?\"--how\nlong the patter of questions would have run on it is hard to say,\nif the extreme naivete of the last one had not drowned them in\nuniversal laughter, and Isabel in crimson.\n\nMrs. Jack Bendish rode up while they were talking, slipped from\nher saddle, and threw the reins to Val without apology, though\nshe knew there was no one but Val to take the mare to the stable.\nYvonne was the only member of the Castle household who presumed\non Val's subordinate position.  She treated him like a superior\nservant.  When she heard what was in the wind her eyes were as\ngreen as a cat's.  \"How kind of Captain Hyde!\" she drawled, as\nLawrence, irritated by her manner, went to help Val, while Isabel\nwas called indoors by Fanny to listen to a tale of distress,\nunravel a grievance, and prescribe for anemia.  \"Some one ought\nto warn the child.\"\n\n\"Warn her of what?\"\n\n\"Has it never struck you that Isabel is a pretty girl and\nLawrence a good looking man?\"\n\n\"But Isabel is too intelligent to have her head turned by the\nfirst handsome man she meets!\"  Yvonne looked as though she found\nher sister rather hopeless.  \"Dear, you really must be sensible!\"\nLaura pleaded.  \"It's not as if poor Lawrence had tried to flirt\nwith her.  He never even thought of asking her for tonight till I\nsuggested it!\" This was the impression left on Laura's memory.\n\"She isn't the sort of woman to attract him.\"\n\n\"What sort of woman would attract him, I wonder?\" said Mrs. Jack,\nblowing rings of smoke delicately down her thin nostrils.\n\n\"Oh, when he marries it will be some one older than Isabel, more\nsophisticated, more a woman of the world. I like Lawrence\nimmensely, but there is just that in him: he's one of the men who\nexpect their wives to do them credit.\"\n\n\"Some one more like me,\" suggested Yvonne. \"Or you.\" Her face was\na study in untroubled innocence.  Laura eyed her rather sharply.\n\"But Lawrence isn't a marrying man.  He won't marry till some\nwoman raises the price on him.\"\n\n\"You speak as if between men and women life were always a duel.\"\n\n\"So It is.\"  Laura made a small inarticulate sound of dissent.\n\"Sex is a duel.  Don't you know\"--an infinitesimal hesitation\nmarked the conscious forcing of a barrier: cynically frank as she\nwas on most points, Mrs. Bendish had always left her sister's\nmarried life alone:--\"that--that's what's wrong with Bernard?  Oh!\nLaura!  Simpleton that you are. . .  I'm often frightfully sorry\nfor Bernard.  It has thrown him clean off the rails.  One can't\nwonder that he's consumed with jealousy.\"\n\nIn the stillness that followed Yvonne occupied herself with her\ncigarette.  Mrs. Clowes was formidable even to her sister in her\ndelicately inaccessible dignity.\n\n\"Had you any special motive in saying this to me now, Yvonne?\"\n\n\"This theatre business.\"\n\n\"I don't contemplate running away with Lawrence, if that is what\nyou mean.\"\n\n\"Wish you would!\" confessed Mrs. Bendish frankly.  \"Then Bernard\ncould divorce you and you could start fair again.  I'm fed up\nwith Bernard.  I'm sorry for him, poor devil, but he never was\nmuch of a joy as a husband, and he's going from bad to worse.\nThink I'm blind?  Of course he's jealous.  High dresses and lace\ncuffs aren't the fashion now, Lal.\"\n\nHer sister slowly turned back the frill from her wrist and\nexamined the scarlet stain of Bernard's finger-print.  \"Does it\nshow so plainly?  I hope other people haven't noticed.  Bernard\ndoesn't remember how strong his hands still are.\"\n\n\"Doesn't care, you mean.\"\n\n\"Do you want me quite naked?\" said Laura. \"Well, doesn't care,\nthen.\"\n\nYvonne was not accustomed to the smart of pity.  She winced under\nit, and her tongue, an edge-tool of intelligence or passion, but\nnot naturally prone to express tenderness, became more than ever\narticulate.  \"Sorry!\" she said with difficulty, and then, \"Didn't\nwant to rake all this up.  But I'm fond of you.  We've always\nbeen pals, you and I, Lulu.\"\n\n\"Say whatever you like.\"\n\n\"Then--\" she sat up, throwing away her cigarette-\"I'm going to\nwarn you.  All Chilmark believes Lawrence is your lover.\"\n\n\"And do you?\"\n\n\"No.  I know you wouldn't run an intrigue.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But Jack and I both think, if you don't want to cut and run with\nhim, you ought to pack him off.  Mind, if you do want to, you can\ncount me in, and Jack too.  I'm not religious: Jack is, but he's\nnot narrow.  As for the social bother of it--marriage is a\nuseful institution and all that, but it's perfectly obvious that\none can get--over the rails and back again if one has money.\nThere aren't twenty houses (worth going to) in London that would\ncut you if you turned up properly remarried to a rich man.\"\n\n\"Are you . . . recommending this course?\"\n\n\"I'd like you to be happy.\"\n\n\"And what about Bernard?\"\n\n\"Put in a couple of good trained nurses who wouldn't give him his\nhead as you do, and he'd be a different man by the spring.\"\n\n\"He certainly would,\" said Laura drily.  \"He would be dead.\"\n\n\"Not he.  He's far too strong to die of being made uncomfortable.\nAs a matter of fact it would do him all the good in the world,\"\npursued Yvonne calmly.  \"He cries out to be bullied.  What's so\nirritating in the present situation is that though you let him\nrack you to pieces you never give him what he wants!  You don't\nshine as a wife, my dear.\"\n\n\"It will end in my sending Lawrence away,\" said Laura with a subdued\nsigh.  \"I didn't want to because in many ways he has done Bernard so\nmuch good; no one else has ever had the same influence over him;\nbesides, I liked having him at Wanhope for my own sake--he freshened\nus up and gave us different things to talk about, outside interests,\nnew ideas.  And after all, so far as Bernard himself is concerned,\none is as good as another.  He always has been jealous and always\nwill be.   But if all Chilmark credits us with the rather ignominious\nfeat of betraying him, Lawrence will have to go.\"\n\n\"Lawrence may have something to say to that.\"\n\n\"He's not in love with me.\" Yvonne's eyes widened in genuine\nscepticism.--\"Oh dear, as if I shouldn't know!\" Laura broke out\npetulantly.  Might not Yvonne have remembered that, in the days\nwhen they were living together in a French appartement, Laura's\nexperience had been pretty nearly as wide as her own?  \"He is\nnot, I tell you! nor I with him.  But, if we were, I shouldn't\ndesert Bernard. I do not believe in your two highly trained\nnurses. I don't think you much believe in them yourself.  They\nmight break him in, because nurses are drilled to deal with\ntiresome and unmanageable patients, but it would be worse for\nhim, not better.  He rebels fiercely enough now, but if I weren't\nthere he would rebel still more fiercely, and all the rage and\nhumiliation would have no outlet.  You want me to be happy?  We\nSelincourts are so quick to seize happiness!  Father did it . . .\nand Lucian does it:  dear Lulu!  We both love him, but it's\ndifficult to be proud of him.  Yet he has good qualities, good\nabilities.  He's far cleverer than I am, and so are you,\" Laura's\ntone was diffident, \"but oh, you are wrong in thinking so much of\nmere happiness.  There is an immense amount of pain in the world,\nand if one doesn't bear one's own share it falls on some one\nelse.  My life with Bernard isn't--always easy,\" she found a\nmomentary difficulty in controlling her voice, \"but he's my\nhusband and I shall stick to him.  The more so for being deeply\nconscious that a different woman might manage him better.  No I\ndon't mind your saying it.  Oh, how often I've felt the truth of\nit!  But, such as I am, I'm all he has.\"\n\n\"You're a thousand times too good for him.  Why are you so good?\"\n\n\"I'm not good and no more is Lulu.\"  Mrs. Bendish sighed,\nimpressed perhaps by Laura's alien moralities, certainly by her\ndetermination.  \"However, if you won't you won't, and in a way\nI'm glad, selfishly that is, because of Jack's people.  But in\nthat case, dear girl, do get rid of Lawrence!  The situation\nstrikes me as fraught with danger.  One of those situations where\nevery one says something's sure to happen, and then they're all\nflabbergasted when it does.\"\n\n\"Bernard is not a formidable enemy,\" said Mrs. Clowes drily.\n\"But, yes, Lawrence must go.  I'll speak to him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Why not today?\"\n\n\"It would spoil our evening.\"\n\n\"Give it up.\"\n\n\"And disappoint Isabel?\"\n\n\"I don't like it.\"\n\n\"Nor I. But I was forced into it, and I can't break my word to\nLawrence and the child.  After all, there's no great odds between\ntoday and tomorrow.  What can happen in twenty-four hours?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nIn after life, when Isabel was destined to look back on that day\nas the last day of her youth, she recalled no part of it more\nclearly than wandering up to her own room after an early tea to\ndress, and flinging herself down on her bed instead of dressing.\nShe slept next to Val.  But while Val's room, sailor-like in\nits neatness, was bare as any garret and got no sun at all,\nIsabel's was comfortable in a shabby way and faced south and west\nover the garden: an autumn garden now, bathed in westering\nsunshine, fortified from the valley by a carved gold height of\nbeech trees, open on every other side over sunburnt moorland pale\nand rough as a stubble-field in its autumn feathering of light\nbrown grasses and seedling flowers aflicker in a west wind.\nTonight however Isabel saw nothing of it, she lay as if asleep,\nher face hidden in her pillow: she, the most active person in the\nhouse, who was never tired like Val nor lazy like Rowsley!\nConscience pricked her, but she was muffled so thick in happiness\nthat she scarcely felt it: the fancies that floated into her mind\nfrightened her, and yet they were too sweet to banish: and then\nafter all were they wrong?\n\nAlways on clear evenings the sun flung a great ray across her\nwall, turning the faded pale green paper into a liquid gold-green\nlike sunlit water, evoking a dusty gleam from her mirror, and\ndeepening the shadows in an old mezzo tint of Botticelli's Spring\nwhich was pinned up where she could gaze at it while she brushed\nher hair.  The room thus illumined was that of a young girl with\nlittle time to spare and less money, and an ungrown individual\ntaste not yet critical enough to throw off early loyalties.\nThere were no other pictures, except an engraving of \"The Light\nof the World,\" given her by Val, who admired it.  There was a\ntall bookcase, the top shelves devoted to Sweet's \"Anglo-Saxon\nReader,\" Lanson's \"Histoire de la litterature Francaise,\" and\nother textbooks that she was reading for her examination in\nOctober, the lower a ragged regiment of novels and verse--\"The\nThree Musketeers,\" \"Typhoon,\" \"Many Inventions,\" Landor's\n\"Hellenics,\" \"with fondest love from Laura,\" \"Une Vie\" and \"Fort\ncomme la Mort\" in yellow and initialled \"Y.B.\" There were also a big\ntable strewn with papers and books, and a chintz covered box-ottoman\ninto which Isabel bundled all those rubbishing treasures that people\nwho love their past can never make up their weak minds to throw away.\nShe examined them all in the stream of gold sunlight as if she had\nnever seen them before.  It was time to get up and arrange her hair\nand change into her lace petticoats. If she did not get up at once\nshe would be late and they would lose their train.  And it seemed to\nher that she would die if they lost their train, that she never could\nsurvive such a disappointment: and yet she could not bring herself to\nget up and give over dreaming.\n\nAnd what dreams they were, oh! what would Val say to them?--And\nyet again after all were they so wicked?--They were incredibly\nnaif and innocent, and so dim that within twenty-four hours\nIsabel was to look back on them as a woman looks back on her\nchildhood.  She was not ignorant of the mysteries of birth and\ndeath.  She had lived all her life among the poor, and knew many\nthings which are not included in school curricula, such as the\ngentle art of keeping children's hair clean, how to divide a\nfour-roomed cottage between a man and wife and six children and a\nlodger, and what to say when shown \"a beautiful corpse\": but she\nhad never had a lover of her own.  There were no marriageable men\nin Chilmark--there never are in an English village--and she was\ntoo young for Rowsley's brother officers, or they were too young\nfor her.  She had dreamed of fairy princes (blases-men-of-the-world,\nmostly in the Guards or the diplomatic service), but it was never\nprecisely Isabel Stafford whom they clasped to their hearts--no, it\nwas LaSignora Isabella, the star of Covent Garden, or the Lady Isabel\nde Stafford, a Duke's daughter in disguise.  And Lawrence came to her\nin the mantle of these patrician ghosts.\n\nBut--and at this point Isabel hid her face on her arm--he was no\nghost: he knew what he wanted and he meant to have it: and it was a\nfar cry from visionary Heroes to Lawrence Hyde in the flesh, son of a\nJew, smelling of cigar-smoke, and taking hold of her with his large,\nfair, overmanicured hands.  A far cry even from Val or Jack Bendish:\nfrom the cool, mannered Englishman to the hot Oriental blood.  When\npeople were engaged they often kissed each other . . . but when it\ncame to imagining oneself . . . one's head against that thick\ntweed . . . no . . . it must be one of the things that are safe to do\nbut dangerous to dream of doing.  Oh, never, never!--But she had been\ntrained in sincerity: and was this cry sincere?  Her mind was chaos.\n\nAnd yet after all why dangerous?  Even Laura, Val's adored Laura,\nhad been engaged twice before she married Major Clowes: as for\nYvonne, Isabel felt sure she had been kissed many times, and not\nby Jack Bendish only.  Such things happen, then! in real life,\nnot only in books.  As for the cigars and the valet . . . and\nVal's warnings . . . one can't have all one wants in this world!\nIt contains no ideal heroes: what was it Yvonne had once said?\n\"Every marriage is either a delusion or a compromise.\" And Isabel\nhad shortcomings enough of her own: she was irritable, lazy,\nselfish: read novels when she ought to have been at her lessons:\nleft household jobs undone in the certainty that Val, however\ntired he was, would do them for her: small sins, but then her\ntemptations were small!  Take it by and large, she was probably\nno better than Captain Hyde except for want of opportunity.  And\nhow he would laugh if he heard her say so!\n\nShe liked him for laughing.  She had been brought up in an\natmosphere of scruple.  Her father overworked his conscience,\ntreating a question of taste as a moral issue, and drawing no\nline between great and small--like the man who gave a penny to a\nbeggar and implored him not to spend it on debauchery.  Charity\nand a sense of fun saved Val, but if more lenient to others he\nwas ruthlessly stern to himself.  Lawrence blew on Isabel like a\nbreath of sea air.  In her reaction she liked his external\ncharacteristics, his manner to servants, his expensive clothes\nand boots, all the signs of money spent freely on himself.\n\nShe even liked his politics.  Isabel had been brought up all her\nlife to talk politics.  Mr. Stafford was a Christian Socialist, a\ncreed which in her private opinion was nicely calculated to\nproduce the maximum of human discomfort: and from a conversation\nbetween Hyde and Jack Bendish she had learnt that Hyde was all of\nher own view.  There was no nonsense about him--none of that\nsweet blind altruism which, as Isabel saw it, only made the\naltruist and his family so bitterly uncomfortable without doing\nany good to the poor. The poor?  She knew intuitively that\nservants and porters and waiters would far rather serve Hyde than\nher father.  Mr. Stafford longed to uplift the working classes,\nbut Isabel had never got herself thoroughly convinced that they\nstood in need of uplifting.  Her practical common sense rose in\narms against Movements that tried to get them to go to picture\ngalleries instead of picture palaces. Why shouldn't they do as\nthey liked?   Does one reform one's friends?  Captain Hyde would\nlive and let live.\n\nAnd he was rich.  Few girls as cramped as Isabel could have\nremained blind to that wide horizon, and she made no pretence of\ndoing so: she was honest with herself and owned that she had\nalways longed to be rich.  No one could call her discontented!\nher happy sunny temper took life as it came and enjoyed every\nminute of it, but her tastes were not really simple, though Val\nthought they were.  She had long felt a clear though perfectly\ngood-humoured and philosophic impatience of her narrow scope.\nHyde could give her all and more than all she had ever desired--\nforeign countries and fine clothes, books and paintings, and\npower apparently and the admiration of men . . . Isabel Hyde\n. . . Mrs. Lawrence Hyde . . . .smiling she tried his name under\nher breath . . .and suddenly she found herself standing before\nthe mirror, examining her face in its dusky shallows and asking\nof it the question that has perplexed many a young girl as\nbeautiful as she--\"Am I pretty?\" She pulled the pins out of her\nhair and ran a comb through it till it fell this way and that\nlike an Indian veil, darkly burnished and sunset-shot with\nthreads of bronze.  \"Lawrence has never seen it loose,\" she\nreflected: \"surely I am rather pretty?\" and then \"Oh, oh, I shall\nbe late!\" and Isabel's dreams were drenched and scattered under\nthe shock of cold water.\n\nDreamlike the run through the warm September landscape: dreamlike\nthe slip of country platform, where, while Lawrence took their\ntickets, she and Laura walked up and down and fingered the tall\nhollyhocks flowering upward in quilled rosettes of lemon-yellow\nand coral red, like paper lanterns lit by a fairy lamplighter on\na spiral stair: and most dreamlike of all the discovery that the\nExeter express had been flagged for them and that she was\nexpected to precede Laura into a reserved first class carriage.\nIt was not more than once or twice in a year that Isabel went by\ntrain, and she had never travelled but third class in her life.\nHow smoothly life runs for those who have great possessions!  How\npolite the railway staff were!  The station master himself held\nopen the door for the Wanhope party.  Now she knew Mr. Chivers\nvery well, but in all previous intercourse one finger to his cap\nhad been enough for young Miss Isabel.  Certainly it was\nagreeable, this hothouse atmosphere.  \"Shall you feel cold?\"\nLawrence asked, and Isabel, murmuring \"No, thank you,\" blushed in\nresponse to the touch of formality in his manner.  She felt what\nwomen often feel in the early stages of a love affair, that he\nhad been nearer to her when he was not there, than now when they\nwere together in the presence of a third person.  She had grown\nshy and strange before this careless composed man lounging\nopposite her with his light overcoat thrown open and his crush\nhat on his knees, conventionally polite, his long legs stretched\nout sideways to give her and Laura plenty of room.\n\nAnd Lawrence on the journey neither spoke to her nor watched her,\nthough Isabel shone in borrowed plumes.  There had been no time\nto buy clothes, and so Val, though grudgingly, had allowed Laura\nand Yvonne to ransack their shelves and presses for Cinderella's\nadornment.  But one glance had painted her portrait for him, tall\nand slender in a long sealskin coat of Yvonne's which was rulled\nand collared and flounced with fur, her glossy hair parted on one\nside and drawn back into what she called a soup-plate of plaits.\nOnce only he directly addressed her, when Laura loosened her own\nsables.  \"Do undo your coat, won't you?  It's hot tonight for\nSeptember.\"\n\n\"I'm not hot, thank you,\" said Isabel stiffly: but slowly, as if\nagainst her will, she opened the collar of her coat and pushed it\nback from her young neck and the crossed folds of her lace gown.\nThe gown was very old, it had indeed belonged to Laura Selincourt: it\nwas because Laura loved its soft, graceful, dateless lines that it\nhad survived so long. She had seized on it with her unerring tact:\nthis was right for Isabel, this dim transparency of rosepoint\nmodelling itself over the immature slenderness of nineteen: and she\nand her maid Catherine and Mrs. Bendish had spent patient hours\ntrying it on and modifying it to suit the fashion of the day.  Laura\nhad refused to impose upon Isabel either her own modish elegance or\nYvonne's effect of the arresting and bizarre.  \"Isn't she almost too\nslight for it?\"  Yvonne had asked, and Laura for all answer had\nhummed a little French song--\n\n          'Mignonne allons voir si la rose\n           Qui ce matin avoit desclose\n           Sa robe de pourpre au soleil\n           A point perdu ceste vespree\n           I as plis de sa robe pourpree\n           Et son teint au votre pareil . . .'\n\nShe discerned in Isabel that quality of beauty, noble, spirited,\nand yet wistful, which requires a most expensive setting of\nsimplicity.  And that was why Isabel opened her coat.  If Captain\nHyde had admired her in her Chilmark muslin, what would he think\nof flounce and fold of rose-point of Alencon under Yvonne's\nperfumed furs?  And then she blushed again because the yearning\nin his eyes made her wonder if he cared after all whether she\nwore lace or cotton.  Everything was so strange!\n\nStrangest of all it was, to the brink of unreality, that Laura\nevidently remained blind.  But Laura was always blind.  \"Why, she\nnever even sees Val!\" reflected Isabel scornfully.  And yet--\nsuppose Isabel were deceiving herself?  What if Captain Hyde were\nnot in earnest?  But her older self comforted her child's self:\ncareless was he, and composed?  \"You were not always so composed,\nLawrence,\" in her own mind the elder Isabel mocked him with her\nsparkling eyes.\n\nWaterloo, lamplit and resonant: the pulsing of many lamps, the\nhurry of many steps, the flitting by of many faces under an arch\nof gloom: dark quiet and the scent of violets in a waiting car.\n\n\"What a jolly taxi!\" Isabel exclaimed.  \"I never was in a taxi\nlike this before.  Is it a more expensive kind?\"\n\n\"My dear Lawrence, you certainly have the art of making your life\nrun on wheels!\" said Laura smiling.  \"How many telegrams have you\nsent today?\"\n\n\"If you do a thing at all you may as well do it in decent\ncomfort,\" Lawrence replied sententiously. \"Half past seven;\nthat'll give us easy time!  I booked a table at Malvani's, I\nthought you would prefer it to one of the big crowded shows.\"\n\n\"Are we going to have supper--dinner I mean--at a restaurant?\"\nasked Isabel awestruck.\n\nLaurance smiled at her with irrepressible tenderness.  \"Did you\nthink you weren't going to get anything to eat at all?\" He\nforbore to remind her of her unfortunate allusion to sandwiches--\nfor which Isabel was grateful to him.  \"Aren't you hungry?\"\n\n\"Oh yes: but then I often am.  Is Malvani's a very quiet place?\"\n\nLawrence looked at Laura with a comical expression.  \"What an ass\nI was!  Wouldn't the Ritz have been more to the point?\"\n\n\"Never mind, sweetheart,\" said Laura.  \"Malvani's isn't dowdily\nquiet.  It's the smartest of the smart, and there are always a\nlot of distinguished people in it.  Dear me, how long it is since\nI've dined in town!  Really it's great fun, I feel as if I had\ncome out of a tomb--\" she checked herself: but she might have\nbeen as indiscreet as she liked, for her companions were not\nlistening.  Laura was faintly, very faintly startled by their\nattitude--Hyde leaning forward in the half-light of the brougham\nto button Isabel's glove--but she was soon smiling at her own\nfancy. \"Poor Isabel, poor simple Isabel!\" She was only a child\nafter all.\n\nA child, but a very gay and winning child, when she came into\nMalvani's with her long swaying step, direct glance, and joyous\nmouth.  A spirit of excitement sparkled in Isabel tonight, and\nevery movement was a separate and conscious pleasure to her: the\nphysical sensation of walking delicately, the ripple of her skirt\nover her ankles, the poise of her shoulders under their\ntransparent veil. . . . Laura saw a dozen men turn to look after\nthe Wanhope party, and took no credit for it, though not long ago\nshe had been accustomed to be watched when she moved through a\npublic room.  But now she was better pleased to see Isabel\nadmired than to be admired herself.\n\nAs they neared their reserved table a man who had been sitting at\nit rose with an amused smile. \"Have you forgotten who I am,\nLaura?\"\n\n\"One might as well be even numbers,\" Lawrence explained.  \"So, as\nI knew Selincourt was in town, I wired to him to join us.\"\n\nA worn, fatigued-looking, but not ungentle rake of forty,\nSelincourt had stayed once at Wanhope, but the visit had not been\na success: indeed Laura had been thankful when it ended before\nhost and guest threw the decanters at each other's heads. That\nshe was pleased to see him now there could be no doubt: she had\ntaken him by both hands and was smiling at him as if she would\nhave liked to fling decorum to the winds and kiss him.  Lawrence\nalso smiled but with a touch of finesse.  His plan was working.\nLaura was going to enjoy herself: bon! he was truly fond of Laura\nand delighted to give her pleasure.  But by it he would be left\nfree to devote himself to Isabel.\n\nIt was to this end that he had planned the entire expedition.  At\nChilmark they met continually in the same setting, and he had no\nmeans of printing a fresh image of himself on her mind, but here\nhe was free of country customs, a rich man among his equals, an\nexpert in the art of \"doing oneself well\"--one of those who rule\nover modern civilization by divine right of a chequebook and a\ntrained manner.  Isabel had been brought up by High Churchmen,\nhad she?  Let them test what hold they had of her!  Every aspect\nof their journey and of the supper-table at Malvani's, with its\nheady music and smell of rich food and wines, had been calculated\nto produce a certain effect--an intoxication of excitement and\npleasure.  And he set himself to stamp his own impression on\nIsabel, naming to her, in his soft, isolating undertones, the\nnotable men and women in the room, describing their careers,\ntheir finances, even their scandals--it amused him to watch her\nrepress a start.  It amused him still more to stand up and shake\nhands when the immense body and Hebraic nose of an international\nfinancier went by with two great ladies and a cabinet minister in\ntow.  \"One of my countrymen,\" Hyde turned to Isabel with a\nmocking smile. \"I am a citizen of no mean city.  Those--\" with an\nimperceptible jerk of the head--\"would lick the dust off his\nboots to find out what line the Jew bankers mean to take in the\nSyrian question.  They might as well lick mine.\"\n\n\"Why, do you know?\" breathed Isabel.\n\n\"Verily, O Gentile maiden.\" Lawrence grinned at her over his\nchampagne.  \"I lunched Raphael last time I was in town and he\ntold me all about it. But I shouldn't tell them.  It isn't good\nfor Gentiles to know too much about Weltpotitik. That's our\nshow.\" He leant back in his chair and his hot eyes challenged her\nto call him a dirty Jew.\n\nSelincourt caught his last remark and looked him up and down with\na twinkling glance.  He no longer wondered why Lawrence had spent\nhis summer in the tents of Kedar--so differently do brothers\nlook on their own and other men's sisters.  But he knew men and\nthings pretty well, and at a moment when Laura was speaking to\nIsabel he looked straight at Lawrence and touched his glass with\na murmured, \"Go slow, old man.\" The elder man had seen instantly\nwhat neither Mrs. Clowes nor Isabel had any notion of, that under\nhis easy manner Hyde's nerves were all on edge.  Lawrence started\nand stared at him, half offended: but after a moment his good\nsense extorted a grudging \"Thanks.\" It warned him to be grateful\nfor the hint, and he took it: a second glass of champagne that\nnight would infallibly have gone to his head.\n\nA darkened theatre, fantastically decorated in scarlet and\nsilver: a French orchestra already playing a delicate prelude: a\nlively audience--a typical \"Moor\" audience--agreeably ready to\nbe piqued and scandalized as well as amused.\n\nAll the plays Isabel had ever seen were Salisbury matinees of\n\"As You Like It\" and \"Julius Caesar.\" It was not by chance that\nHyde introduced her tonight to this filigree comedy, so cynical\nunder its glittering dialogue.  He could find no swifter way to\npresent to her le monde ou l'on s'amuse in all its refined and\ndefiant charm.  He liked to watch her laugh, he laughed himself\nand gave a languid clap or two when Madeleine Wild made one of\nher famous entries, but his main interest was in his plan of\ncampaign.\n\nYet chance can never he counted out.  When the lights went up\nafter the first act Lawrence found himself looking directly\nacross the rather small and narrow proscenium at a lady in the\nopposite box.  Who the devil was it?--The devil, with a\nvengeance!  It was Mrs. Cleve.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nConscious to his fingertips that Selincourt was watching him with\nan amused smile, Lawrence returned Mrs. Cleve's nod with less\nthan his usual ease.  Her eye ranged on from Selincourt, to whom\nshe waved a butterfly salute, over the rather faded elegance of\nLaura Clowes and the extremely youthful charms of Isabel:\napparently she did not admire Lawrence's ladies: she spoke to her\ncavalier, an elderly, foreign-looking man with a copper complexion\nand curly dark hair, and they laughed together.  What ensued between\nthem was not difficult to follow.  She made him a request, he rolled\nplaintive eyeballs at her, the lady carried her point, the gentleman\nleft the box.  Then--one saw it coming--she leaned forward till the\ndiamonds in her plenitude of fair hair sparkled like a crown of\nflame, and beckoned Lawrence to join her.\n\nHe cursed her impertinence.  Apart from leaving Isabel, he did\nnot want to talk to Mrs. Cleve: he had forgotten her existence,\nand it was a shock to him to meet her again.  Good heavens, had\nhe ever admired her?  That white blanc-mange of a woman in her\nruby-red French gown, cut open lower than one of Yvonne's without\nthe saying of Yvonne's wiry slimness?  Remembering the summerhouse at\nBingley Lawrence blushed with shame, not for his morals but for his\ntaste:  he was thankful to have gone no further and wondered why he\nhad gone so far.--He had not yet realized that during three months\namong women of a different stamp his taste had imperceptibly modified\nitself from day to day.\n\nBut she had been his hostess.  Impossible to refuse: and with a\nvexed word of apology to Laura he went out.  \"Dear me, what an\nopulent lady!\" said Laura with lifted eyebrows.  \"Who's your\nfriend, Lulu?\"\n\nLucian drily named her.  \"Queen's Gate, and Sundays at the\nMetropole.  They're shipping people, which is where the diamond\nta-ra-ras come from.  Oh yes, there's a husband, quite a nice\nfellow, crocked in the Flying Corps. No, I don't know who the\nchap is she's got with her.  Some dusky brother.  Not Cleve.\" He\nfell silent as Lawrence appeared in the opposite box.\n\nIt was an odd scene to watch in dumbshow.  Mrs. Cleve shook\nhands, and Lawrence was held for more than the conventional\nmoment. He remained standing till she pointed to her cavalier's\nempty chair: then dropped into it, but sat forward leaning his\naim along the balcony, while she, drawn back behind her curtain,\nwas almost drowned in shadow except for an occasional flash of\ndiamonds, or an opaque gleam of white and dimpled neck.  An\ninterlude entirely decorous, and yet, so crude was the force of\nPhilippa's personality, one would have had to be very young, or\nvery innocent, to overlook her drift.\n\n\"Well, my darling,\" said Laura, \"and what do you think of\nMadeleine Wild?\" She did not wish Isabel to watch Mrs. Cleve.\n\"Is she as nice as your Salisbury Rosalind?\"\n\n\"Angelical!\" said Isabel.  \"And isn't it luck for me, Royalty\ncoming tonight?  I've never seen any one Royal before.  It's one\nof those evenings when nothing goes wrong.\"\n\nWas not Isabel a trifle too guileless for this wicked world?  She\nprattled on, Selincourt and Laura lending an indulgent ear,\nSelincourt, like any other man of his type, touched by her\ninnocence, Laura faintly irritated: and meanwhile Isabel through\nher black lashes watched, not the Duchess of Cumberland's rubies,\nbut those two in the opposite box.  Between it and her stretched\na beautiful woodland drop-scene, the glitter of the stalls, and\nthe murmur of violins humming through the rising flames of the\nFeuerzauber . . . presently the Fire Charm eddied away and the\nlights went down, yet still Lawrence sat on though the interval\nwas over.  Across the semi-dark of a \"Courtyard by Moonlight\" it\nwas hard to distinguish anything but the silhouette of his hand\nand arm, and Mrs. Cleve's fair hair and immense jewelled fan.\nWhat were they saying to each other in this public isolation\nwhere anything might be said so long as decorum was preserved?\n\nSelincourt gave a little laugh as the curtain rose. \"An old\nflame,\" he whispered to Laura, not dreaming that Isabel would\nunderstand even if she heard.\n\n\"What's an old flame?\" asked Isabel, examining him with her\nbrilliant eyes.\n\n\"Feuerzauber,\" said Selincourt readily.  \"It means fire spell.\nIt's often played between the acts.\"\n\n\"Lucian, Lucian!\" said his sister laughing.\n\n\"I don't know much about music,\" said Isabel. \"Was it well\nplayed?\"\n\n\"Ah! I know a lot about music,\" said Selincourt, looking at her\nvery kindly.  \"No, it was rottenly played.  But some fellers\ncan't tell a good tune from a bad one.\"\n\nLawrence did not return till the middle of the third act, and\noffered no apology.  He looked fierce and jaded and his eyes were\nstrained.  \"Past eleven,\" he said, hurrying Laura into her coat\nwhile the orchestra played through the National Anthem, for which\nSelincourt stood stiffly to attention.  \"No time for supper, our\ntrain goes at 11:59, I hate first nights, the waits between the\nacts are so infernally long.\" Laura's eyebrows, faintly arched,\nhinted at derision.  \"Oh, it dragged,\" said Lawrence impatiently.\n\"Let's get out of this.\"\n\nIt was a clear autumn night: the air was mild, and stars were\nburning overhead almost as brightly as the lamps in Shaftesbury\nAvenue.  What a chase of lamps, high and low, like fireflies in a\nwood: green as grass, red as blood, or yellow as a naked flame!\nWhat a sombre city, and what a fleeting crowd!  Isabel had never\nseen midnight London before.  Coming out into the hurrying street\nroofed with stars, she was seized by an impression of a solitude\nlonelier than any desert, and dark, like the terror of an eerie\nsunset or a dry storm on the moor.\n\n\"These taxis are waiting for us,\" Lawrence had come up behind her\nand his hand was on her arm. \"Will you bring your sister,\nSelincourt?--  Miss Isabel, will you come with me?\"\n\n\"Oh but--!\" said Laura, startled. She was responsible to Val for\nIsabel, and she was not sure that either Val or Isabel would\nwelcome this arrangement.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Isabel, obediently getting into the second cab.\n\n\"Better come, dear,\" said Selincourt with a shrug, and Laura\nyielded, for it would have been tiresome to make Isabel get out\nagain, and after all what signified a twenty minutes' run?  Yet\nafter the Cleve incident she did not quite like it.  Nor did\nSelincourt; Hyde's overbearing manner set his teeth on edge; but\nthe gentle Lucian would sooner have faced a loaded rifle than a\ndispute.   He agreed with Laura, however, that her fair Arcadian\nwas a trifle too innocent for her years.\n\nAlone with Isabel, Lawrence took off his hat and ran his fingers\nthrough his thick fair hair, so thick that it might have been\ngrey, while the deep lines round his mouth began to soften as\nthough fatigue and irritation were being wiped away.  \"Thank\nheaven that's over.\"\n\n\"I've enjoyed every minute of it,\" said Isabel smiling.  \"Thank\nyou, Captain Hyde, for giving me such a delightful treat!  If I\nweren't sleepy I should like to begin again.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't get sleepy yet,\" said Lawrence.  He pulled up the fur\ncollar of her coat and buttoned it under her chin.  \"I can't have\nyou catching cold, or what will Val say?  You aren't used to\ndriving about in evening dress and we've a long run before us.\nAnd how I have been longing for it all the evening, haven't you?\nI didn't know how to sit through that confounded play.  Yes, you\ncan take in Selincourt and Laura but you can't take me in. I know\nyou must have hated it as much as I did. But it's all right now.\"\nSitting sideways with one knee crossed over the other, his face\nturned towards Isabel, without warning he put his arm round her\nwaist.  He had determined not to ask her to marry him till he was\nsure of her answer, but he was sure of it now, intuitively sure\nof it . . . the truth being that under his impassive manner\nimpulse was driving him along like a leaf in the wind.  \"I love\nyou, Isabel, and you love me.  Don't deny it.\"\n\n\"Don't do that,\" said Isabel: \"don't hold me.\"\n\n\"Why not? no one can see us.\"\n\n\"Take your arm away.  I won't have you hold me. No, Captain Hyde,\nI will not.  I am not Mrs. Cleve.\"\n\n\"Isabel!\" said Lawrence, turning grey under his bronze.\n\n\"O! I oughtn't to have said that,\" Isabel murmured.  She hid her\nface in her hands.  \"Oh Val--  I wish Val were here!\"\n\n\"My darling,\" they were among the dark streets now that border\nthe river, and he leant forward making no effort to conceal his\ntenderness, \"what is there you can't say to me or I to you?\nYou're so strange, my Isabel, a child one minute and a woman the\nnext, I never know where to have you, but I love the woman more\nthan the child, and there's nothing on earth you need be ashamed\nto ask me.  Naturally you want to be sure. . . . But there was\nnothing in it except that I hated leaving you, there never has\nbeen; I can't discuss it, but there's no tie, no--do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then, dearest darling of the world, what are you crying for?\"\n\n\"I'm not crying.\" She tried to face him, but he was too old for\nher, and mingling in his love she discerned indulgence, the\nseasoned judgment and the fixed view.  Struggling in imperfect\napprehensions of life, she was not yet master of her forces--\nthey came near to mastering her.  In his eyes it was natural for\nher to be jealous.  But she was not jealous.  That passion can\nhardly coexist with such sincere and cool contempt as she had\nfelt for Mrs. Cleve.  What had pierced her heart and killed her\nchildhood in her was terror lest Lawrence should turn out to have\nlowered himself to the same level.  She knew now that she loved\nhim, and too much to care whether he was Saxon or Jew or rich or\npoor, but he must--he must be what in her child's vocabulary she\ncalled \"good,\" or if not that he must at least see good and bad\nwith clear eyes: sins one can pardon, but the idea of any\nessential inferiority of taste was torture to her.  And meanwhile\nLawrence wide of the mark began to coax her. . \"My own,\" his arm\nstole inside her coat again, \"there's nothing to get so red\nabout! Come, you do like me--confess now--you like me better\nthan Val?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Isabel murmured, and slowly, though she had not\nstrength to free herself, she turned her head away.  \"If you kiss\nme now I never shall forgive you.\"\n\n\"I won't, but why are you so shy?  My Isabel, what is there to be\nafraid of?\"\n\n\"You,\" Isabel sighed out.  He was gratified, and betrayed it.  \"No,\nLawrence, you misunderstand. I am not--not shy of you . . .\"  Under\nhis mocking eyes she gave it up and tried again.  \"Well, I am, but\nif that were all I shouldn't refuse . . . I should like you to be\nhappy.  Oh! yes, I love you, and I'd so far rather not fight, I'd\nrather--\" she waited a moment like a swimmer on the sand's edge, but\nhis deep need of her carried her away and with a little sigh she\nflung herself into the open sea--\"let you kiss me, because I don't\nwant anything so much as to make you happy, and I believe you would\nbe, and besides I--I should like it myself.  But I must know more.\nI must know the truth.  She--Mrs. Cleve--\"\n\n\"I've already given you my word: do you think I would lie to\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, I don't; they say men do, but I'm sure you wouldn't.  I\ndon't believe you ever would deceive me. But there have been\nother women, haven't there, since your wife left you?\" Lawrence\nassented briefly.  At that moment he would have liked to see Mrs.\nCleve hanged and drawn and quartered.  \"Other women who were--\nwho--with whom--\"\n\n\"Must you distress yourself like this?  Wouldn't it do if I\npromised to lay my record before Val, and let him be judge?\"\n\n\"Would you do that?\"\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you hate it?\"\n\nLawrence smiled.\n\n\"And I should hate it for you,\", said Isabel. \"No: no one can\njudge you for me and no one shall try.  I know you better than\nVal ever would. No, if you're to be humiliated it shall be before\nme and me only.\"  She brought the colour into his face.  \"There\nhave been others, Lawrence?\"\n\n\"My dear, I've lived the life of other men.\"\n\n\"Do all men live so?\"\n\n\"Pretty well all.\"\n\n\"Does Val?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \"His facilities are limited!\"\n\n\"He did once--might again?\"\n\n\"Couldn't we confine the issue to ourselves?\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of my misjudging Val? I never should: my dearest\ndarling Val is a fixed standard for me, and nothing could alter\nthe way I think of him.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge luck,\" Lawrence muttered.\n\n\"I'm not, it's true.  I'm surer of Val than I am of myself, or\nyou, or the sun's rising tomorrow.  All I want is to cheek you by\nhim.\"\n\n\"Val is genuinely religious and a bit of an ascetic.  I have no\ndoubt that his life is now and will continue to be spotless.  But\nthat it was always so is most unlikely.  Army subalterns during\nthe war were given no end of a good time.  And quite right too,\nit was the least that could be done for us: and the most, in nine\ncases out of ten: personally I had no use for munition workers in\nmud-coloured overalls, but I still remember with gratitude the\nnymphs who decorated my week end leaves.\"\n\nIsabel shivered: the hand that he was holding had grown icy cold.\n\n\"There, you see!\" said Hyde with his saddened cynicism.  \"You\nwill have it all out but you can't stand it when it comes.  You\nhad better have left it to Val: not but what I'd rather talk to\nyou, but I hate to distress you, and you're not old enough yet,\nmy darling, to see these trivial things--yes, trivial to nine-tenths\nof the world: it's only the clergy, and unmarried women, and a small\nnumber of hyper-sensitives like Val, who attach an importance to them\nthat they don't deserve.  But you're too young to see them in\nperspective.  Try to do it for my sake.  Try to see me as I am.\"\n\n\"Well, show me then.\"\n\nBut what he showed her was not himself but the aspect of himself\nthat he wished her to see--a very different matter.  \"I'm too\nold for you.  I'm the son of a Jew, and a Houndsditch Jew at\nthat.  But I'm rich--what's called rich in my set--and when I\nmarry I shan't keep my wife dependent on me.  Ah! don't\nmisunderstand me--yours is a rich manysided nature, and you're\ntoo intelligent to underrate the value of money.  It means a wide\nlife and lots of interests, books, pictures, music, travel,\nmixing with the men and women best worth knowing.  You're\nambitious, my dear, and as my wife you can build yourself up any\nsocial position you like.  Farringay's not as big as Wharton, but\non my soul it's more perfect in its way.  I've never seen such\npanelling in my life, and the gardens are admittedly the most\nbeautiful in Dorsetshire.  There are Sevres services more\nprecious than gold plate, and if you come to that there's gold\nplate into the bargain.  Can't I see you there as chatelaine,\nentertaining the county!  You'll wear the sapphires my mother\nwore; the old man couldn't have been more happily inspired,\nthey're the very colour of your eyes.  And there'll be no price\nto pay, for since I'm a Jew and a cosmopolitan, and not a country\nsquire, you'll keep your personal freedom inviolate.  You'll give\nwhat you will, when you will, as you will.  Any other terms are\nto my mind unthinkable--a brutalizing of what ought to be the\nmost delicate of things.  Heavens, how I hate a middleclass\nEnglish marriage!  Ah! but I'm not so accommodating as I sound,\nfor you won't be a grudging giver; you're not an ascetic like\nVal, there's passion in you though you've been trained to repress\nit, you'll soon learn what love means as we understand it in the\nsunny countries. . . . Isabel, my Isabel, when we get away from\nthese grey English skies you won't refuse to let me kiss\nyou. . .\"\n\nIsabel had ceased to listen.  Without her own will a scene had sprung\nup before her eyes: an imaginary scene, like one of those romantic\nadventures that she had invented a thousand times before--but this\nwas not romantic nor was she precisely the heroine. A foreign hotel\nwith long corridors and many rooms: a door thoughtlessly left ajar:\nand through it a glimpse of Lawrence--her husband--holding another\nwoman in his arms.  It was lifelike, she could have counted the buds\nembroidered on the girl's blouse, their rose-pink reflected in the\nhot flush on Hyde's cheek and the glow in his eyes as he stooped over\nher.  And then the imaginary Isabel with a pain at her heart like the\nstab of a knife, and a smile of inexpressible self-contempt on her\nlips, noiselessly closed the door so that no one else might see what\nshe had seen, and left him. . . . It would all happen one day, if not\nthat way, some other way; and he would come to her by and by without\nexplanation--she was convinced that he would not lie to her--smiling,\nthe hot glow still on his face, a subdued air of well-being diffused\nover him from head to foot--and then?  The vision faded; her\nclairvoyance, which had already carried her far beyond her\nexperience, broke down in sheer anguish.  But reason took it up and\ntold her that she would speak to him, and that he would apologize and\nshe would forgive him--and that it would all happen again the next\ntime temptation met him in a weak hour.\n\nFaithful? it was not in him to be faithful: with so much that was\ngenerous and gallant, there was this vice of taste in him which\nhad offended her that first morning on the moor and again at\nnight in Laura's garden, and which now led him to make love to\nher when she was under his protection and while the scent of Mrs.\nCleve's flowers still clung to his coat.  And what love! if he\nhad simply spoken to her out of his need of her, one would not\nhave known how to resist, but it was he who was to be the giver,\nand what he offered was the measure of what he desired--a lesson\nin passion and a liberal allowance. . . .\n\n\"O no, no, no, I can't!\" Isabel cried out, turning from him.\n\"Yes, I love you, but I don't trust you, and I won't marry you.\nI'm too much afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid of me?\"\n\n\"Afraid of the pain.\"\n\n\"What pain?\"\n\n\"And the--wickedness of it.\" Lawrence, frozen with astonishment--he\nhad foreseen resistance,  but not of this quality--let fall her hand.\n\"Yes, we'll part now.  We can part now.  I love you, but not too much\nto get over it in a year or so; and you?  you'll forget sooner,\nbecause I'm not worth remembering.\"\n\n\"Forget you?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, it's not as if you really cared for me; you wouldn't\ntalk to me of money if you did.  But I suppose you've known so\nmany. . . . Val warned me long ago that you had not a good name\nwith women.\"\n\n\"Val said that?  Val!\"\n\n\"And now you're angry with Val; I repeat what I oughtn't to\nrepeat, and make mischief.  Lawrence, this isn't Val's doing; it\nisn't even Mrs. Cleve's: it's my own cowardice.  I daren't marry\nyou.\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"You're not trying to be good.\"\n\n\"The language of the nursery defeats me, Isabel.\"\n\nShe flushed.  \"That means I've hurt you.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"I can't help it.\" That was truer than he realized, for she could\nhardly help crying. She could not soften her refusal, because she\nwas so shaken and exhausted by the strain of it that she dared\nnot venture on more than one sentence at a time.\n\n\"I'm very sorry.\"\n\n\"But as my wife you could be as 'good' as you liked?\"\n\n\"You would not leave me strength for it.\"\n\n\"I should corrupt you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you would deliberately tempt me. . . . I think you\nhave tonight.\"\n\n\"Do you care for no one but yourself?\" he flung at her in his\nvertigo of humiliation and anger.\n\n\"No: I care for God.\"\n\n\"For God!\" Lawrence repeated stupidly: \"what has that to do with\nyour marrying me?\"\n\nHe heard his own betise as it left his lips, and felt the\nimmeasurable depth of it, but he had not time to retract before\nevery personal consideration was wiped from his mind by a cry\nfrom Isabel in a very different accent--\"Lawrence! oh! look at\nthe time!\"\n\nShe pointed to the dial of an illuminated clock, hanging high in\nthe soft September night.  It was eight minutes to twelve.  \"What\ntime did you say our train went?\"\n\nThey were in Whitehall.  Lawrence caught up the speaking tube.\n\"Waterloo main entrance--and drive like the devil, please, we're\nlate.\"\n\n\"I thought we had plenty of time?\"\n\n\"So we had: so much so that I told the man to drive round and\nround for a bit.\"\n\n\"And have we still time?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We shan't lose the train?\"\n\n\"Unless it's delayed in starting, which isn't likely.\"\n\n\"Will the others go on and leave us?\"\n\n\"Hardly!\"\n\n\"You don't mean that Laura won't get home till tomorrow?  Oh!\"\n\n\"No.  But don't look so frightened, no one will blame you--the\nresponsibility is mine entirely.\"\n\nIsabel's lip curled.  It was for Laura that she felt afraid and\nnot for herself, and surely he might have guessed as much as\nthat!  \"Did you do it on purpose?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.  That was stupid of me.\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Lawrence with his keen sarcastic smile.\n\nAt Waterloo he sprang out, tossed a sovereign to the driver, and\nmade Isabel catch up her skirts and run like a deer.  But before\nthey reached the platform it was after twelve and the rails\nbeyond were empty.  Selincourt and Laura were waiting by the\nbarrier, Selincourt red with impatience, Laura very pale.\n\n\"Are you aware you've lost the last train down?\" said the elder\nman with ill-concealed anger, as Lawrence, shortening his step,\nstrolled up in apparent tranquillity with Isabel on his arm.\n\"What on earth has become of you?  We've been waiting here for\nhalf an hour!\"\n\n\"We were held up in the traffic,\" said Lawrence deliberately.\nIsabel turned scarlet.  The truth would have been insupportable,\nbut so was the lie.  \"Although it was no fault of mine, Laura,\nI'm more sorry than I can say.  Will you let me telephone for my\nown car and motor you down? I could get you to Chilmark in the\nsmall hours--long before the first morning train.\"\n\nLaura hesitated: but Selincourt's brow was dark. The streets that\nnight had not been unusually crowded, ample time had been allowed\nto cover any ordinary delay, and Isabel was cruelly confused. In\nhis simple code Hyde had committed at least one if not two\nunpardonable sins--he had neglected one of the ladies in his\ncare if he had not affronted the other.\n\n\"That wouldn't do at all,\" he said with decision. \"You've been\neither careless or unlucky once, Lawrence.  It might happen\nagain.\"\n\nIt was a direct challenge, and cost him an effort, but it was not\nresented.  \"It would not.  From my soul I regret this contretemps,\nLucian.  Do you settle what's to be done: you're Laura's brother, I\nput myself unreservedly in your hands.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow!\" the gentle Lucian was instantly disarmed.\n\"After all we needn't make a mountain out of a molehill--they'll\nknow we're all right, four of us together!\"\n\n\"At all events it can't be helped,\" said Mrs. Clowes, smiling at\nLawrence with her kind trustful eyes, \"so don't distress\nyourself.  My sweet Isabel too, so tired!\" she took Isabel's cold\nhand. \"Never mind, Val won't let your father worry, and we shall\nbe home by ten or eleven in the morning. It is only to go to an\nhotel for a few hours.  Come, dear Lawrence, don't look so\nsubdued! It wasn't your fault, so you mustn't trouble even if--\"\n\n\"Even if what?\"\n\n\"Even if Bernard locks the door in my face,\" she finished\nlaughing.  \"He'll be fearfully cross! but I dare say Val will go\ndown and smooth his ruffled plumage.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n\"I do not like all this running about to places of amusement,\"\nsaid Mr. Stafford, rumpling up his curls till they stood on end\nin a plume.  \"If you or Rowsley were to visit a theatre I should\nsay nothing.  You're men and must judge for yourselves.  But\nIsabel is different. I have a good mind to put my foot down once\nand for all.  An atmosphere of luxury is not good for a young\ngirl.\"\n\nHe stretched himself out in his shabby chair; a shabby, slight\nman, whose delicate foot, the toes poking out of a shabby\nslipper, looked as if it were too small to make much impression\nhowever firmly put down.  Val, smoking his temperate pipe on the\nother side of the diningroom hearth, temperately suggested that\nthe amount of luxury in Isabel's life wouldn't hurt a fly.\n\n\"One grain of strychnine will destroy a life: and one hour of\ntemptation may destroy a soul for ever.\"  Val bowed his head in\nassent.  \"Why are we all so fond of Isabel?  Because she hasn't a\nparticle of self-consciousness in her.  A single evening's\nflattery may infect her with that detestable vice.\"\n\n\"She must grow up some time.\"\n\n\"More's the pity,\" retorted the vicar.  \"Another point: I'm not\nby any means sure I approve of that fellow Hyde.  I doubt if he's\na religious man.\"  Val brushed away a smile.  \"He comes to church\nwith Laura pretty regularly, but would he come if her influence\nwere removed?  I greatly doubt it.\"  So did Val, therefore he\nprudently held his tongue. \"I hate to be uncharitable,\" continued\nMr. Stafford \"but I doubt if he is even what one narrowly calls a\nmoral man.  Take Jack Bendish, now one can see at a glance that\nhe's a good fellow, right-living and clean-minded.  But Hyde\ndoesn't inspire me with any such confidence. I know nothing of\nhis private life--\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" said Val rather wearily.  \"But what does any man know\nof another man's private life?  If you come to that, Jim, what do\nyou know of Rowsley's--or mine?\"\n\n\"Pouf, nonsense!\" said Mr. Stafford.\n\nAt his feet lay a small black cat, curled up in the attitude of a\ncomma.  Before going on he inserted one toe under her waist,\nrapidly turned her upside down, and chucked her under her ruffled\nand indignant chin.\n\n\"Val, my boy, has any one repeated to you a nasty bit of gossip\nthat's going about the village?\"\n\n\"This violence to a lady!\" Val held out his hand and made small\ncoaxing noises with his lips.  But Amelia after a cold stare\nwalked away and sat down in the middle of the floor, turning\nher back and sticking out a refined but implacable tail.  \"There\nnow! you've hurt her feelings.\"\n\n\"Of course there's nothing in it--on one side at least.  But I\ncan't help wondering whether Hyde . . . . our dear Laura would\nnaturally be the last to hear of it.  But Hyde's a man of the\nworld and knows how quickly tongues begin to wag.  In Laura's\nunprotected position he ought to be doubly careful.\"\n\n\"He ought.\"\n\n\"But he is not.  Now is that designed or accidental?  We'll allow\nhim the benefit of the doubt and call it an error of judgment.\nThen some one ought to give him a hint.\"\n\n\"Some one would be knocked down for his pains.\"\n\n\"D'you think he'd knock me down?\" asked Mr. Stafford, casting a\ncomical glance over his slender elderly frame.\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Val laughing.  \"But--no, Jim, it wouldn't do.\nToo formal, too official.\"  His real objection was that Mr.\nStafford would base his appeal on ethical and spiritual grounds,\nwhich were not likely to influence Lawrence, as Val read him.\n\"But if you like I'll give him a hint myself.  I can do it\ninformally; and I very nearly did it as long ago as last June.\nHyde is amenable to treatment if he's taken quietly.\"\n\nMr. Stafford, by temperament and training a member of the Church\nMilitant, clearly felt a trifle disappointed, but he had little\npetty vanity and accepted Val's amendment without a murmur. \"Very\nwell, if you think you can do it better!  I don't care who does\nit so long as it's done.\" The clock struck.  \"Half past eleven is\nthat?  Isabel can't be home before four.  Dear me, how I hate\nthese ridiculous hours, turning night into day!\"  As some\ncorrespondents put the point of a letter into a postscript, so\nthe vicar in returning to his Church Times revealed the peculiar\nsting that was working in his mind.  \"And I don't--  I do not like\nIsabel to make one of that trio--in view of what's being said.\"\n\n\"She is with Mrs. Clowes,\" said Val shortly, and colouring all\nover his face.  Fling enough mud and some of it is sure to stick!\nIf his unworldly father could think Laura, though innocent, so\nfar compromised that Isabel was not safe in her care, what were\nother people saying?  Val got up.  \"I shall walk down and smoke a\npipe with Clowes.  He won't go to bed till they come in.\"\n\nThe beechen way was dark and steep; roosting birds blundered out\nfrom overhead with a sleepy clamour of alarm-notes and a great\nrustle of leaf-brushed wings; one could have tracked Val's course\nby the commotion they made.  On the footbridge dark in alder-shadow\nhe lingered to enjoy the cool woodland air and lulling ripple\nunderfoot.  Not a star pierced to that black water, it might have\nbeen unfathomably deep; and though the village street was only a\nquarter of a mile away the night was intensely quiet, for all\nChilmark went to bed after closing time.  It was not often that Val,\noverworked and popular, tasted such a profound solitude.  Not a leaf\nstirred: no one was near: under golden stars it was chilling towards\none of the first faint frosts of the year: and insensibly Val relaxed\nhis guard: a heavy sigh broke from him, and he moved restlessly,\nindulging himself in recollection as a man who habitually endures\npain without wincing will now and then allow himself the relief of\ndefeat.\n\nFor it is a relief not to pretend any more nor fight: to let pain\ntake its way, like a slow tide invading every nerve and flooding\nevery recess of thought, till one is pierced and penetrated by\nit, married to it, indifferent so long as one can drop the mask\nof that cruel courage which exacts so many sacrifices.  Val was\nstill only twenty-nine.  Forty years more of a life like\nthis! . . . Lawrence had once compared him to a man on the rack.\nBut, though Lawrence knew all, Val had never relaxed the strain\nbefore him: was incapable of relaxing it before any spectator.\nHe needed to be not only alone, but in the dark, hidden even from\nhimself: and even so no open expression was possible to him, not\na movement after the first deep sigh: it was relief enough for\nhim to be sincere with himself and own that he was unhappy.  But\nwhy specially unhappy now?\n\nMidnight: the church clock had begun to strike in a deep whirring\nchime, muffled among the million leaves of the wood.\n\nThat trio were in the train now, Isabel probably fast falling\nasleep, Hyde and Laura virtually alone for the run from Waterloo\nto Chilmark.\n\nA handsome man, Hyde, and attractive to women, or so rumour and\nYvonne Bendish affirmed. If even Yvonne, who was Laura's own\nsister, was afraid of Hyde! ... Well, Hyde was to be given the\nhint to take himself off, and surely no more than such a hint\nwould be necessary?  Val smiled, the prospect was not without a\nwry humour.  If he had been Hyde's brother, what he had to say\nwould not have said itself easily.  \"Let us hope he won't knock\nme down,\" Val reflected, \"or the situation will really become\nstrained; but he won't--that's not his way.\"  What was his way?\nThe worst of it was that Val was not at all sure what way Hyde\nwould take, nor whether he would consent to go alone.  A handsome\nman, confound him, and a picked specimen of his type: one of\nthose high-geared and smoothly running physical machines that are\nall grace in a lady's drawingroom and all steel under their\nskins.  What a contrast between him and poor Bernard! the one so\nimpotent and devil-ridden, the other so virile, unscrupulous, and\nserene.\n\nVal stirred restlessly and gripped the rail of the bridge between\nhis clenched hands.  His mind was a chaos of loose ends and he\ndared not follow any one of them to its logical conclusion.  What\nwas he letting himself think of Laura?  Such fears were an insult\nto her clear chastity and strength of will.  Or, in any event,\nwhat was it to him?  He was Bernard's friend, and Laura's but he\nwas not the keeper of Bernard's honour. . . . But Hyde and\nLaura . . . alone . . . the train with its plume of fire rushing\non through the dark sleeping night. . . .\n\n\"In manus tuas . . .\"  Val raised his head, and shivered, the\nwind struck chill: he was tired out.  Yet only a second or so had\ngone by while he was indulging himself in useless regrets for\nwhat could never be undone, and still more useless anxiety for a\nfuture which was not only beyond his control but outside his\nprovince as Bernard's agent.  That after all was his status at\nWanhope, he had no other.  It was still striking twelve: the last\necho of the last chime trembled away on a faint, fresh sough of\nwind. . . . A lolloping splash off the bank into the water--what\nwas that?  A dark blot among ripples on a flat and steely\nglimmer, the sketch of a whiskered feline mask . . . Val made a\nmental note to speak to Jack Bendish about it: otters are bad\nhousekeepers in a trout stream.\n\n\"Hallo!  Good man!\" Major Clowes was on his back in the\ndrawingroom, in evening dress, and playing patience.  \"I've tried\nKings, Queens and Knaves, and Little Demon, and Fair Lucy, and\nbrought every one of 'em out first round.  Something must be\ngoing to happen.\" With a sweep of his arm he flung all the cards\non the floor. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"A pipe,\" said Val, going on one knee to pick up the scattered\npack.  \"I looked in to see how you were getting on.  Aren't you\ngoing to bed?\"\n\n\"Not before they come in.\"\n\n\"Nor will Jimmy, I left him sitting up for Isabel.  You're both\nof you very silly, you'll be dead tired tomorrow, and what's the\nobject of it?\"\n\n\"To make sure they do come in,\" Bernard explained with a broad\ngrin.  Val sprang up: intolerable, this reflection of his own\nfear in Bernard's distorting mirror!  \"Ha ha!  Suppose they\ndidn't?  Laura was rather fond of larks before she married me.\nShe was, I give you my word--she and the other girl.  You\nwouldn't think it of Laura, would you?  Butter wouldn't melt in\nher mouth.  But she might like a fling for a change.  Who'd blame\nher?  I'm no good as a husband, and Lawrence is a picked\nspecimen.  Quelle type, eh?\"\n\n\"Very good-looking.\"\n\n\"'Very good-looking!'\" Bernard mocked at him. \"You and your Army\nvocabulary!  And I'm a nice chap, and Laura's quite a pretty\nwoman, and this is a topping knife, isn't it, and life's a jolly\nold beano--  Pity I can't get out of it, by the by: if physiology\nis the basis of marriage, those two would run well in harness.\"\n\n\"There's an otter in the river,\" remarked Val, examining the\nlittle dagger, the same that Lawrence had given Bernard.  \"I\nheard him from the bridge.  They come down from the upper\nreaches.  Remind me to tell Jack, he's always charmed to get a\nday's sport with his hounds.\" He laid the dagger on a side-table.\n\n\"Have one of my cigars?  You can't afford cigars, can you? poor\ndevil!  They're on that shelf.  Not those: they're Hyde's.\" Val\nput back the box as if it had burnt his fingers.  \"Leaves his\nthings about as if the place were a hotel!\" grumbled Major\nClowes. \"That's one of his books.  Pick it up. What is it?\" Val\nread out the title.  \"Poetry?  Good Lord deliver us!  Do you read\npoetry, Val?\"\n\n\"I occasionally dip into Tennyson,\" Val replied, settling himself\nin an easy chair.  \"I can't understand modern verse as a rule,\nit's too clever for me, and the fellows who write it always seem\nto go in for such gloomy subjects.  I don't like gloomy books, I\nlike stuff that rests and refreshes you.  There are enough sad\nthings in life without writing stories about them. I can read the\n'Idylls of the King,' but I can't read Bernard Shaw.\"\n\n\"Nor anybody else,\" said Bernard.  He fixed his eyes on Val: eyes\nlike his cousin's in form and colour, large, and so black under\ntheir black lashes that the pupil was almost indistinguishable\nfrom the iris, but smouldering in a perpetual glow, while Hyde's\nwere clear and indifferent.  \"You're a good sort to have come\ndown to look after me.  I don't feel very brash tonight.  Oh Val!\noh Val! I know I'm a brute, a coarse-minded, foul-mouthed brute.\nI usedn't to be.  When I was twenty-five, if any man had said\nbefore me what I say of Laura, I'd have kicked him out of his own\nhouse.  Why don't you kick me?\"\n\n\"I am not violent.\"\n\n\"Ain't you?  I am.\" He flung out his arm. \"Give me your hand.\"\nVal complied, amused or touched: as often happened when they were\nalone,  he remained on the borderline.  But it was taken in no\naffectionate clasp.  Bernard's grip closed on him, tighter and\ntighter, till the nails were driven into his palm.  \"Is that\npainful?\" Clowes asked with his Satanic grin.  \"Glad of it.  I'm\nin pain too.  I've got neuritis in my spine and I can't sleep for\nit.  I haven't had any proper sleep for a week.--Oh my God, my\nGod, my God! do you think I'd grumble if that were all?  I can't,\nI can't lie on my back all my life playing patience or fiddling\nover secondhand penknives!  I was born for action.  Action, Val!\nI'm not a curate.  I'd like to smash something--crush it to a\njelly.\"  Val mincingly pointed out that such a consummation was\nnot far off, but he was ignored.  \"Oh damn the war! and damn\nEngland too--what did we go to fight for?  What asses we were!\nDid we ever believe in a reason?  Give me these ten years over\nagain and I wouldn't be such a fool.  Who cares whether we lick\nGermany or Germany licks England?  I don't.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nBernard stared at him, incredulous.  \"What--'freedom and\nhonour' and all the rest of it?\"\n\n\"In a defensive war--\"\n\n\"Oh for God's sake!  I've just had my supper.\"\n\n\"--any man who won't fight for his country deserves to be shot.\"\n\n\"You combine the brains of a rabbit with the morals of a eunuch.\"\n\nVal crossed his legs and withdrew his cigar to laugh.\n\n\"Ah! I apologize.\" Clowes shrugged his shoulders. \"'Eunuch' is\nthe wrong word for you--as a breed they're a cowardly lot.  But\nI used the term in the sense of a Palace favourite who swallows\nall the slop that's pumped into him.  'Lloyd George for ever and\nBritannia rules the waves.' Dare say I should sing it myself if\nI'd come out covered with glory like you did.\"\n\n\"I met Gainsford today.  He says the longacre fences ought to be\nrenewed before winter.  Parts of them are so rotten that the\nfirst gale will bring them down.\"\n\n\"Damn Gainsford and damn the fences and damn you.\"\n\n\"Really, really!\" Val stretched himself out and put his feet up.\n\"You're very monotonous tonight.\"\n\n\"And you, you're tired: I wear you both out, you and Laura--and\nyet you're the only people on earth. . . . Why can't I die?\nSometimes I wonder if it's anything but cowardice that prevents\nme from cutting my throat.  But my life is infernally strong in\nme, I don't want to die: what I want is to get on my legs again\nand kick that fellow Hyde down the steps.  What does he stop on\nhere for?\"\n\n\"Well, you're always pressing him to stay, aren't you?  Why do\nyou do it, if this is the way you feel towards him?\"\n\n\"Because I've always sworn I'd give Laura all the rope she\nwanted,\" said Clowes between his teeth.  \"If she wants to hang\nherself, let her.  I should score in the long run.  Hyde would\nchuck her away like an old shoe when he got sick of her.\"   There\nwas a fire not far from madness burning now in the wide, dilated\neyes.  \"Afterwards she'd have to come back, because those\nSelincourts haven't got twopence between the lot of them, and if\nshe did she'd be mine for good and all.  Hyde would break her in\nfor me.\"\n\n\"You don't realize what you're saying, Berns, old man.  You\ncan't,\" said Val gently, \"or you wouldn't say it.  It is too\nunutterably beastly.\"\n\n\"Ah! perhaps the point of view is a bit warped,\" Bernard returned\ncarelessly to sanity.  \"It shocks you, does it?  But the fact is\nLaura has the whip hand of me and I can't forgive her for it.\nShe's the saint and I'm the sinner.  She's a bit too good. If\nHyde broke her in and sent her home on her knees, I should have\nthe whip hand of her, and I'd like to reverse the positions.  Can\nyou follow that?  Yes! A bit warped, I own. But I am warped--\nbound to be.  Give the body such a wrench as the Saxons gave mine\nand you're bound to get some corresponding wrench in the mind.\"\n\n\"That's rank materialism.\"\n\n\"Bosh! it's common sense.  Look at your own case!  Do you never\nanalyze your own behaviour?  You would if you lay on your back\nyear in year out like me.  You're maimed too.\"\n\n\"No, am I?\" Val reached for a fourth cushion. \"Think o' that,\nnow.\"\n\n\"Or you wouldn't be content to hang on in Chilmark, riding over\nanother man's property and squiring another man's wife.  The shot\nthat broke your arm broke your life.  You had the makings of a\nfine soldier in you, but you were knocked out of your profession\nand you don't care for any other.  With all your ability you'll\nnever be worth more than six or seven hundred a year, for you've\nno initiative and you're as nervous as a cat.  You're not married\nand you'll never marry: you're too passive, too continent, too\nmuch of a monk to attract a healthy woman.  No: don't you flatter\nyourself that you've escaped any more than I have. The only\ndifference is that the Saxons mucked up my life and you've mucked\nup your own.  You fool! you high-minded, over-scrupulous\nfool! . . . You and I are wreckage of war, Val: cursed, senseless\ndevilry of war.--  Go and play a tune, I'm sick of talking.\"\n\nVal was not any less sick of listening.  He went to the piano,\nbut not to play a tune.  Impossible to insult that crippled\ntempest on the sofa with the sweet eternal placidities of Mozart\nor Bach.  His fingers wandered over the lower register,\nimprovising, modulating from one minor key to another in a cobweb\nof silver harmony spun pale and low from a minimum of technical\nattention.  For once Bernard had struck home.  \"The shot that\nbroke your arm broke your life.\" Stripped of Bernard's rhetoric,\nwas it true?\n\nVal could not remember the time when his ambition had not been\nset on soldiering: regiments of Hussars and Dragoons had deployed\non his earliest Land of Counterpane: he had never cared for any\nother toys.  But as soon as war was over he had resigned his\ncommission, a high sense of duty driving him from a field in\nwhich he felt unfit to serve.  He had pitilessly executed his own\njudgment: no man can do more.  But what if in judgement itself\nhad been unhinged--warped--deflected by the interaction of\nsplintered bone and cut sinew and dazed, ghost-ridden mind?  Have\nnot psychologists said that few fighting men were strictly normal\nin or for some time after the war?\n\nIf that were true, Val had wasted the best years of his life on a\ndelusion.  It was a disturbing thought, but it brought a sparkle\nto his eyes and an electric force to his fingertips: he raised\nhis head and looked out into the September night as if there was\nstirring in him the restless sap of spring.  After all he was\nstill a young man.  Forty years more!  If these grey ten years\nsince the war could be taken as finite, not endless: if after\nthem one were to break the chain, tear off the hair shirt, come\nout of one's cell into the warm sun--then, oh then--Val's\nshoulders remembered their military set--life might be life\nagain and not life in death.\n\n\"What the devil are you strumming now?\"\n\n\"Tipperary.\"\n\n\"That's not much in your line.\"\n\n\"Oh! I was in the Army once,\" said Val. \"You go to sleep.\"\n\nHe had his wish.  The heavy eyelids closed, the great chest rose\nand fell evenly, and some--not all--of the deep lines of pain\nwere smoothed away from Bernard's lips.  Even in sleep it was a\nrestless, suffering head, but it was no longer so devil-ridden as\nwhen he was talking of his wife.  Val played on softly: once when\nhe desisted Bernard stirred and muttered something which sounded\nlike \"Go on, damn you,\" a proof that his mind was not far from\nhis body, only the thinnest of veils lying over its terrible\nactivity.  David would have played the clock round, if Saul would\nhave slept on.\n\nSaul did not. He woke--with a tremendous start, sure sign of\nbroken nerves: a start that shook him like a fall and shook the\ncouch too.  \"Hallo!\" he came instantly into full possession of\nhis faculties: \"you still here?  What's the time? I feel as if\nI'd been asleep for years.  Why, it's daylight!\" He dragged out\nhis watch.  \"What the devil is the time?\"\n\nVal rose and pulled back a curtain.  The morning sky was full of\ngrey light, and long pale shadows fell over frost-silvered turf:\nmists were steaming up like pale smoke from the river, over whose\nsurface they swept in fantastic shapes like ghosts taking hands\nin an evanescent arabesque: the clouds, the birds, the flowers\nwere all awake.  The house was awake too, and in fact it was the\nclatter of a housemaid's brush on the staircase that had roused\nBernard. \"It's nearly six o'clock,\" said Val.  \"You've had a long\nsleep, Berns.  I'm afraid the others have missed their train.\"\n\n\"Missed their train!\"\n\n\"First night performances are often slow, and they mayn't have\nbeen able to get a cab at once.  It's tiresome, but there's no\ncause for anxiety.\"\n\n\"Missed their train!\"\n\n\"Well, they can't all have been swallowed up by an earthquake!\nOf course fire or a railway smash is on the cards, but the less\nthrilling explanation is more probable, don't you think, old\nman?\"\n\n\"Missed the last train and were obliged to stay in town?\"\n\n\"And a rotten time they'll have of it.  It's no joke, trying to\nget rooms in a London hotel when you've ladies with you and no\nluggage.\"\n\n\"You think Laura would let Hyde take her to an hotel?\"\n\n\"Well, Berns, what else are they to do?\" said Val impatiently.\n\"They can't very well sit in a Waterloo waitingroom!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Clowes.  \"Much better pass the night at an hotel.\nIs that what you call a rotten time?  If I were Lawrence I should\ncall it a jolly one.\"\n\nVal turned round from the window.  \"If I were Hyde,\" he said\nstiffly, \"I should take the ladies to some decent place and go to\na club myself.  You might give your cousin credit for common\nsense if not for common decency!  You seem to forget the\nexistence of Isabel.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Bernard after a moment.  \"I was only\njoking.  No offence to your sister, Val, I'm sure Laura will look\nafter her all right.  But it is a bit awkward in a gossippy hole\nlike Chilmark. When does the next train get in?\"\n\nNo man knows offhand the trains that leave London in the small\nhours, but Val hunted up a timetable--its date of eighteen\nmouths ago a pregnant commentary on life at Wanhope--and came\nback with the information that if they left at seven-fifteen they\ncould be at Countisford by ten.  \"Too late to keep it quiet,\" he\nowned.  \"The servants are a nuisance.  But thank heaven Isabel's\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven indeed,\" Bernard assented.  \"Not that I care two\nstraws for gossip myself, but Laura would hate to be talked\nabout.  Well, well!  Here's a pretty kettle of fish.  How would\nit be if you were to meet them at the station?  I suppose they're\nsafe to come by that train?  Or will they wait for a second one?\nGetting up early is not Laura's strong point at the best of\ntimes, and she'll be extra tired after the varied excitements of\nthe night.\"\n\nVal examined him narrowly.  His manner was natural if a trifle\nsubdued; the unhealthy glow had died down and his black eyes were\nfrank and clear.  Nevertheless Val was not at ease, this natural\nway of taking the mishap was for Bernard Clowes so unnatural and\nextraordinary: if he had stormed and sworn Val would have felt\nmore tranquil.  But perhaps after the fireworks of last night the\ndevil had gone out of him for a season?  Yet Val knew from\npainful experience that Bernard's devil was tenacious and wiry,\nnot soon tired.\n\n\"They might,\" he said cautiously, \"but I shouldn't think they\nwill.  Laura knows you, old fellow.  She'll be prepared for a\nterrific wigging, and she'll want to get home and get it over.\"\nA dim gleam of mirth relieved Val's mind a trifle: when the devil\nof jealousy was in possession he always cast out Bernard's sense\nof humour, a subordinate imp at the best of times and not of a\nhealthy breed.  \"Besides, there's Isabel to consider.  She'll be\nin a great state of mind, poor child, though it probably isn't in\nthe least her fault.  By the bye, if there's no more I can do for\nyou, I ought to go home and see after Jim.  He expressed his\nintention of sitting up for Isabel, and I only wonder he hasn't\nbeen down here before now.  Probably he went to sleep over his\nChurch Times, or else buried himself in some venerable volume of\npatristic literature and forgot about her.  But when Fanny gets\ndown he'll be tearing his hair.\"\n\n\"Go by all means,\" said Bernard.  \"You must be fagged out, Val;\nhave you been at the piano all these hours?  How you spoil me,\nyou and Laura!  Get some breakfast, lie down for a nap, and after\nthat you can go on to Countisford and meet them in the car.\"\n\n\"All right!\" In face of Bernard's thoughtful and practical good\nhumour Val's suspicions had faded.  \"Shall I come back or will\nyou send the car up for me?\" Neither he nor Clowes saw anything\nunusual in these demands on his time and energy: it was\nunderstood that the duties of the agency comprised doing anything\nBernard wanted done at any hour of day or night.\n\n\"I'll send her up.  Stop a bit.\" Clowes knit his brows and looked\ndown, evidently deep in thought.  \"Yes, that's the ticket.  You\ntake Isabel home and send Lawrence and Laura on alone.  Drop them\nat the lodge before you drive her up.  She'll be tired out and\nit's a good step up the hill.  And you must apologize for me to\nyour father for giving him so much anxiety.  Lawrence must have\nbeen abominably careless to let them lose their train: they ought\nto have had half an hour to spare.\"\n\n\"He is casual.\"\n\n\"Oh very: thinks of nothing but himself.  Pity you and he can't\nstrike a balance!  Good-bye.  Mind you take your sister straight\nhome and apologize to your father for Hyde's antics.  Say I'm\nsorry, very sorry to mix her up in such a pickle, and I wouldn't\nhave let her in for it if it could have been avoided.  Touch the\nbell for me before you go, will you?  I want Barry.\"\n\nVal let himself out by the window and the impassive valet\nentered.  But it was some time before Bernard spoke to him.\n\n\"Is that you, Barry? I didn't hear you come in.\"\n\n\"Now what's in the wind?\" speculated Barry behind his\nprofessional mask.  \"Up all night and civil in the morning?  Oh\nno, I don't think.\"\n\n\"Shall I wheel you to your room, sir?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Clowes.  He waited to collect his strength.\n\"Shut all those windows.\" Barry obeyed.  \"Turn on the electric\nlight . . . .Put up the shutters and fasten them securely . . . .\nNow I want you to go all over the house and shut and fasten all\nthe other ground floor windows: then come back to me.\"\n\n\"Am I to turn on the electric light everywhere, sir?\" Barry asked\nafter a pause.\n\n\"Where necessary.  Not in the billiard room; nor in Mrs. Clowes'\nparlour.\"   Barry had executed too many equally singular orders\nto raise any demur.  He came back in ten minutes with the news\nthat it was done.\n\n\"Now wheel me into the hall,\" said Clowes. Barry obeyed.  \"Shut\nthe front doors. . . . Lock them and put up the chain.\"\n\nThis time Barry did hesitate.  \"Sir, if I do that no one won't be\nable to get in or out except by the back way: and it's close on\nseven o'clock.\"\n\n\"You do what you're told.\"\n\nBarry obeyed.\n\n\"Now wheel my couch in front of the doors.\"\n\n\"Mad as a March hare!\" was Barry's private comment.  \"Lord, I\nwish Mr. Stafford was here.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Clowes.\n\nHe settled his great shoulders square and comfortable on his\npillow and folded his arms over his breast.\n\n\"I want you to take an important message from me to the other\nservants.  Tell them that if Mrs. Clowes or Captain Hyde come to\nthe house they're not to be let in.  Mrs. Clowes has left me and\nI do not intend her to return.  If they force their way in I'll\ndeal with them, but any one who opens the door will leave my\nservice today.  Now get me some breakfast.  I'll have some coffee\nand eggs and bacon.  Tell Fryar to see that the boiled milk's\nproperly hot.\"\n\nBarry, stupefied, went out without a word, leaving the big couch,\nand the big helpless body stretched out upon it, drawn like a bar\nacross the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nIt was a fatigued and jaded party that got out on the platform at\nCountisford.  The mere wearing of evening dress when other people\nare at breakfast will damp the spirits of the most hardened, and\neven Lawrence had an up-all-night expression which reddened his\neyelids and brought out the lines about his mouth.  Isabel's hair\nwas rumpled and her fresh bloom all dimmed.  Laura Clowes had\nsuffered least: there was not a thread astray in her satin waves,\nand the finished grace of her aspect had survived a night in a\nchair.  But even she was very pale, though she contrived to smile\nat Val.\n\n\"How's Bernard?\" were her first words.\n\n\"All serene. He slept most of the time. I was with him, luckily.\nWe guessed what had happened.  You missed your train?\" In this\nquestion Val included Lawrence.\n\n\"It was my fault,\" said Lawrence shortly.  It was what he would\nhave said if it had not been his fault.\n\n\"It was nobody's fault!\" cried Laura.  \"We were held up in the\ntraffic.  But Lawrence is one of those people who will feel\nresponsible if they have ladies with them on the Day of Judgment,\nwon't you, Lawrence?\"\n\n\"I ought to have left more time,\" said Lawrence impatiently.\n\"Let's get home.\"\n\nIn the car Val heard from Laura the details of their\nmisadventure.  Selincourt had waited with the women while\nLawrence secured rooms for them in a Waterloo hotel: when they\nwere safe, Lawrence had gone to Lucian's rooms in Victoria\nStreet, where the men had passed what remained of the night in a\nmild game of cards.  They had all breakfasted together by\nlamplight at the hotel, and Selincourt had seen his sister into\nthe Chilmark train.  Nothing could have been more circumspect--\ncomically circumspect! between Selincourt and Isabel and the\nchambermaid, malice itself was put to silence. But Lawrence was\nfever-fretted by the secret sense of guilt.\n\nAt the lodge gates Val drew up.  \"It's preposterous, but I'm\nunder Bernard's express orders to drive Isabel straight home. I\ndon't know how to apologize for turning you and Hyde out of your\nown car, Laura!\"  No apology was needed, Laura and Lawrence knew\ntoo well how direct Bernard's orders commonly were to Val.\nLawrence silently offered his hand to Mrs. Clowes.  The morning\nair was fresh, fog was still hanging over the river, and the sun\nhad not yet thrown off an autumn quilting of cloud.  Touched by\nthe chill of dawn, some leaves had fallen and lay in the dust,\ntheir ribs beaded with dark dew: others, yellow and shrivelling,\nwhere shaken down by the wind of the car and fluttered slowly in\nthe eddying air. Laura drew her sable scarf close over her bare\nneck.\n\n\"What I should like best, Lawrence, would be for you to go home\nwith Isabel and make our excuses to Mr. Stafford.  Would you\nmind?  Or is it too much to ask before you get out of your\nevening dress?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted,\" said Lawrence, feeling and indeed\nlooking entirely the reverse.  \"But Miss Isabel has her brother\nto take care of her, she doesn't want me.\" Isabel gave that\nindefinable start which is the prelude of candour, but remained\ndumb.  \"I don't like to leave you to walk up to Wanhope alone.\"\nThis, was as near as in civilized life he could go to saying\n\"to face Clowes alone.\"\n\n\"The length of the drive?\" said Laura smiling. \"I should prefer\nit.  You know what Berns is.\"  This was what Lawrence had never\nknown. \"If he's put out I'd rather you weren't there.\"\n\n\"Why, you can't imagine I should care what Bernard said?\"\n\nLaura struck her hands together.-\"There! There!\" she turned to\nVal, \"can you wonder Bernard feels it?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Lawrence from his heart.\n\n\"No, the contrast is poignant,'' said Val coldly.\n\n\"Dear Val, you always agree with me,\" said Laura.  \"Take Captain\nHyde home and give him some breakfast.  I'd rather go alone,\nLawrence: it will be easier that way, believe me.\"\n\nIt was impossible to argue with her.  But while Val wheeled and\nturned in the wide cross, before they took their upward bend\nunder the climbing beechwood, Lawrence glanced over his shoulder\nand saw Mrs. Clowes still standing by the gate of Wanhope,\nsolitary, a wan gleam of sunlight striking down over her gold\nembroideries and ivory coat, a russet leaf or two whirling slowly\nround her drooping head: like a butterfly in winter, delicate,\nfantastic, and astray.\n\nBreakfast at the vicarage was not a genial meal.  Val was anxious\nand preoccupied, Isabel in eclipse, even Mr. Stafford out of\nhumour--vexed with Lawrence, and with Val for bringing Lawrence\nin under the immunities of a guest.  Lawrence himself was in a\nfrozen mood.  As soon as they had finished he rose: \"If you'll\nexcuse my rushing off I'll go down to Wanhope now.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" said Mr. Stafford drily.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Isabel, casting about for a form of consolation,\nand evolving one which, in the circumstances, was possibly\nunique:  \"You'll feel better when you've had a bath.\"\n\n\"I'll walk down with you to Wanhope\" said Val.\n\n\"You?  Oh! no, don't bother,\" said Lawrence very curtly.  \"I can\nmanage my cousin, thanks.\"\n\nBut Val's only reply was to open the door for him and stroll with\nhim across the lawn.  At the wicket gate Hyde turned: \"Excuse my\nsaying so, but I prefer to go alone.\"\n\n\"I'm not coming in at Wanhope.  But I've ten words to say to you\nbefore you go there.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Lawrence.  He swung through leaving Val to follow or\nnot as he liked.\n\n\"Stop, Hyde, you must listen.  You're going into a house full of\nthe materials for an explosion.  You don't know your own danger.\"\n\n\"I dislike hints.  What are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Laura.\"\n\n\"Mrs.  Clowes?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Val with a faint smile.  \"You know as well as I\ndo how pointless that correction is.  You imply by it that as I'm\nnot her brother I've no right to meddle.  But I told you in June\nthat I should interfere if it became necessary to protect\nothers.\"\n\n\"And since when, my dear Val, has it become necessary?  Last\nnight?\"\n\n\"Well, not that only: all Chilmark has been talking for weeks and\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Chilmark--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Val interrupted, flinging out his delicate hands, \"what's\nthe good of that?  Who would ever suggest that you care what\nChilmark says?  But she has to live in it.\"\n\nThe scene had to be faced, and a secret vein of cruelty in\nLawrence was not averse from facing it. This storm had been\nbrewing all summer.--They were alone, for the beechen way was\nused only as a short cut to the vicarage.  Above them the garden\nwall lifted its feathery fringe of grass into great golden boughs\nthat drooped over it: all round them the beech forest ran down\ninto the valley, the eye losing itself among clear glades at the\nend of which perhaps a thicket of hollies twinkled darkly or a\nmarbled gleam of blue shone in from overhead; the steep dark path\nwas illumined by the golden lamplight of millions on millions of\npointed leaves, hanging motionless in the sunny autumnal morning\nair which smelt of dry moss and wood smoke.\n\n\"And what's the rumour?  That I'm going to prevail or that I've\nprevailed already?\"\n\n\"The worst of it is,\" Val kept his point and his temper, \"that\nit's not only Chilmark.  One could afford to ignore village\ngossip, but this has reached Wharton, my father--Mrs. Clowes\nherself.  You wouldn't willingly do anything to make her unhappy:\nindeed it's because of your consistent and delicate kindness both\nto her and to Bernard that I've refrained from giving you a hint\nbefore.  You've done Bernard an immense amount of good.  But the\ngood doesn't any longer counterbalance the involuntary mischief:\nhasn't for some time past: can't you see it for yourself?  One\nhas only to watch the change coming over her, to look into her\neyes--\"\n\n\"Really, if you'll excuse my saying so, you seem to have looked\ninto them a little too often yourself.\"\n\nVal waited to take out his case and light a cigarette.  He\noffered one to Hyde--\"Won't you?\"\n\n\"No, thanks: if you've done I'll be moving on.\"\n\n\"Why I haven't really begun yet.  You make me nervous--it's a\nrotten thing to say to any man, and doubly difficult from me to\nyou--and I express myself badly, But I must chance being called\nimpertinent.  The trouble is with your cousin.  If you had heard\nhim last night. . . .  He's madly jealous.\"\n\n\"Of me?  Last night?\" Lawrence gave a short laugh: this time he\nreally was amused.\n\n\"Dangerously jealous.\"\n\n\"There's not room for a shadow of suspicion.  Go and interview\nSelincourt's servant if you like,  or nose around the Continental.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Val, coaxing a lucifer between his cupped palms,\n\"I dare say it'll come to that.  I've done a good deal of\nBernard's dirty work.  Some one has to do it for the sake of a\nquiet life.  His suspicions aren't rational, you know.\"\n\n\"I should think you put them into his head.\"\n\n\"I?\" the serene eyes widened slightly, irritating Lawrence by\ntheir effect of a delicacy too fastidious for contempt.  For this\ncourtesy, of finer grain than his own sarcasm, made him itch to\nviolate and soil it, as mobs will destroy what they never can\npossess.  \"Need we drag in personalities?  He was jealous of you\nbefore you came to Wanhope.  He fancies or pretends to fancy that\nyou were in love with Mrs. Clowes when you were boy and girl.\nWe're not dealing with a sane or normal nature:  he was\npractically mad last night--he frightened me.  May I give you,\nword for word, what he said?  That he let you stay on because he\nmeant to give his wife rope enough to hang herself.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" said Lawrence after a pause.\n\n\"To leave Wanhope.\"\n\nMore at his ease than Val, in spite of the disadvantage of his\nevening dress, Lawrence stood looking down at him with brilliant\ninexpressive eyes.  \"Is it your own idea that I stayed on at\nWanhope to make love to Laura?\"\n\n\"If I answer that, you'll tell me that I'm meddling with what is\nnone of my business, and this time you'll be right.\"\n\n\"No: after going so far, you owe me a reply.\"\n\n\"Well then, I've never been able to see any other reason.\"\n\n\"Oh?  Bernard's my cousin.\"\n\n\"Since you will have it, Hyde, I can't see you burying yourself\nin a country village out of cousinly affection.  You said you'd\nstay as long as you were comfortable.  Well, it won't be\ncomfortable now!  I'm not presuming to judge you.  I've no idea\nwhat your ethical or social standards are.  Quite likely you\nwould consider yourself justified in taking away your cousin's\nwife.  Some modern professors and people who write about social\nquestions would say, wouldn't they, that she ought to be able to\ndivorce him: that a marriage which can't be fruitful ought not to\nbe a binding tie?  I've never got up the subject because for me\nit's settled out of hand on religious grounds, but they may not\ninfluence you, nor perhaps would the other possible deterrent,\npity for the weak--if one can call Bernard weak.  It would be an\nimpertinence for me to judge you by my code, when perhaps your\nown is pure social expediency--which would certainly be better\nserved if Mrs. Clowes went to you.\"\n\n\"Assuming that you've correctly defined my standard--why should\nI go?\"\n\nVal shrugged his shoulders.  \"You know well enough.  Because Mrs.\nClowes is old-fashioned; her duty to Bernard is the ruling force\nin her life, and you could never make her give him up.  Or if you\ndid she wouldn't live long enough for you to grow tired of her--\nit would break her heart.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Lawrence.  \"Before I grew tired of her?\"\n\nHe had never been so angry in his life.  To be brought to book at\nall was bad enough, but what rankled worst was the nature of the\ncharge.  Sometimes it takes a false accusation to make a man\nrealize the esteem in which he is held, the opinions which others\nattribute to him and which perhaps, without examining them too\nclosely, he has allowed to pass for his own.  Lawrence had\nindulged in plenty of loose talk about Nietzschean ethics and the\ndanger of altruism and the social inexpediency of sacrificing the\nstrong for the weak, but when it came to his own honour not Val\nhimself could have held a more conservative view.  He, take\nadvantage of a cripple?  He commit a breach of hospitality?  He\nsneak into Wanhope as his cousin's friend to corrupt his cousin's\nwife?  What has been called the pickpocket form of adultery had\nnever been to his taste.  Had Bernard been on his feet, a strong\nman armed, Lawrence might, if he had fallen in love with Laura,\nhave gloried in carrying her off openly; but of the baseness of\nwhich Val accused him he knew himself to be incapable.\n\n\"Really?\" he said, looking down at Val out of his wide black\neyes, so like Bernard's except that they concealed all that\nBernard revealed.  \"So now we understand each other.  I know why\nyou want me to go and you know why I want to stay.\"\n\n\"If I've done you an injustice I'm sorry for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't apologize,\" said Lawrence laughing. His manner\nbewildered Val, who could make nothing of it except that it was\nincompatible with any sense of guilt.\n\n\"But, then,\" the question broke from Val involuntarily, \"why did\nyou stay?\"\n\n\"Why do you?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.  Did it never strike you that I might retort with a tu\nquoque?\"\n\n\"How on earth--?\"\n\n\"You were perhaps a little preoccupied,\" said Lawrence with his\ndeadly smile. \"I suggest, Val, that whether Clowes was jealous or\nnot--you were.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear fellow:\" the Jew laughed: it gave him precisely the\nsame satisfaction to violate Val's reticence, as it might have\ngiven one of his ancestors to cut Christian flesh to ribbons in\nthe markets of the East: \"and who's to blame you?  Thrown so much\ninto the society of a very pretty and very unhappy woman, what\nmore natural than for you to--how shall I put it?--constitute\nyourself her protector?  Set your mind at rest.  You have only\none rival, Val--her husband.\"\n\nHe enjoyed his triumph for a few moments, during which Stafford\nwas slowly taking account with himself.\n\n\"I'm not such a cautious moralist as you are,\" Lawrence pursued,\n\"and so I don't hold a pistol to your head and give you ten\nminutes to clear out of Wanhope, as you did to mine.  On the\ncontrary, I hope you'll long continue to act as Bernard's agent.\nI'm sure he'll never get a better one.  As for Laura, she won't\ndiscover your passion unless you proclaim it, which I'm sure\nyou'll never do.  She looks on you as a brother--an affectionate\nyounger brother invaluable for running errands.  And you'll\ncontinue to fetch and carry, enduring all things from her and\nBernard much as you do from me.  When I do go--which won't be\njust yet--I shan't feel the faintest compunction about leaving\nyou behind.  I'm sure Bernard's honour will be as safe in your\nhands as it is in mine.\"\n\nAnd thus one paved the way to pleasant relations with ones\nbrother-in-law.  The civilized second self, always a dismayed and\ncynical spectator of Hyde's lapses into savagery, raised its\nvoice in vain.\n\n\"You seem a little confused, Val--you always were a modest chap.\nBut surely you of all men can trust my discretion--?\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" said Val.  He touched Hyde's coat with his\nfinger-tips, an airy movement, almost a caress, which seemed to\ncome from a long way off.  \"Lawrence, you're hurting yourself\nmore than me.\"\n\nIt was enough and more than enough: an arrest instant and final.\nLater Lawrence wondered whether Val knew what he had done, or\nwhether it was only a thought unconsciously made visible; it was\nso unlike all he had seen of Val, so like much that he had felt.\n\nIt put him to silence.  Not only so, but it flung a light cloud\nof mystery over what had seemed noonday clear.  Since that first\nnight when he had watched in a mirror the disentangling of\nLaura's scarf, Lawrence had entertained no doubt of Val's\nsentiments, but now he was left uncertain.  Val had translated\nhimself into a country to which Lawrence could not follow him,\nand the light of an unknown sun was on his way.\n\nLawrence drew back with an impatient gesture.  \"Oh, let's drop\nall this!\" The civilized second self was in revolt alike against\nhis own morbid cruelty and Val's escape into heaven: he would\nadmit nothing except that he had gone through one trying scene\nafter another in the last eighteen hours, and that Val had paid\nfor the irritation produced successively by Mrs. Cleve, Isabel, a\nwhite night, and a distressed anxious consciousness of unavowed\nguilt.  \"We shall be at each other's throats in a minute, which\nwouldn't suit either your book or mine--you've no idea, Val, how\nlittle it would suit mine!  I'm sorry I was so offensive.  But\nyou wrong me, you do indeed; I'm not in love with Laura, and, if\nI were, the notion of picking poor Bernard's pocket is absolutely\nrepugnant to me.  Social expediency be hanged!  What! as his\nguest?--  But let's drop recrimination; I had no right to resent\nwhat you said after forcing you to say it, nor, in any case, to\ntaunt you . . . I beg your pardon: there! for heaven's sake let's\nleave it at that.\"\n\n\"Will you release me from my parole?\"\n\n\"Yes, and wish to heaven I'd never extracted it. I had no right\nto impose it on you or to hold you to it.  But don't give\nyourself away, Val, I can't bear to think of what you'll have to\nface.  It will be what you once called it--crucifixion.\"\n\n\"No, freedom,\" said Val.  \"After all these years in prison.\" He\nput up his hand to his head. \"The brand--the--What's the\nmatter?\" Lawrence had seized his arm.  \"Am I--am I talking\nrubbish?  I feel half asleep.  But one night's sitting up\naughtn't to--  Oh, this is absurd! . . .\"\n\nLawrence waited in the patience of dismay.  It was no excuse to\nplead that till then he had not known all the harm he had done;\nmen should not set racks to work in ignorance of their effect on\ntrembling human nerves.\n\n\"That's over,\" said Val, wiping his forehead.  \"Sorry to make a\nfuss, but it came rather suddenly.  Things always happen so\nsimply when they do happen.\"\n\n\"Are you going to confess?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  I ought to have done it long ago.  In fact last night I\nmade up my mind to break my parole if you wouldn't let me off,\nbut I'd rather have it this way.  Remains only to choose time and\nplace: that'll need care, for I mustn't hurt others more than I\ncan help.  But I wouldn't mind betting it'll all be as simple as\nshelling peas.  The odds are that people won't believe half I\nsay.  They'll have forgotten all about the war by now, and\nthey'll make far too much allowance for my being only nineteen.\"\n\n\"And for a voluntary confession: that always carries great\nweight. They would judge you very differently if it had come out\nby chance.  Rightly, too: if you're going to make such a\nconfession at your time of life, it will be difficult for any one\nto call you a coward.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Val shrugged his shoulders with the old indolent\nirony.  \"But moral courage was always my long suit.\"\n\n\"How young you still are!\" said Lawrence smiling at him, \"young\nenough to be bitter.  But you're under a delusion.  No, let me\nfinish--  I'm an older man than you are, I've seen a good deal of\nlife, and I had four years out there instead of six weeks like\nyou.  So far as I can judge you never were a coward.  Thousands\nand hundreds of thousands of men broke down like you, but they\nwere lucky and it wasn't known, or at all events it wasn't\ncritical.  Their failure of nerve didn't coincide with the\nspecial call to action.  You would have redeemed yourself if you\nhad been able to stick to your profession.  You have redeemed\nyourself: and you'd prove it fast enough if you got the chance,\nonly of course in these piping times of peace unluckily you\nwon't.\" He coloured suddenly to his temples.  \"Good God, Val! if\nthere were any weakness left in you, could you have mastered me\nlike this?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThe quickest way to Wanhope was by High Street and field path.\nBut Lawrence to avoid the village entered the drive by the lodge,\nthrough iron gates over which Bernard had set up the arms and\nmotto of his family: FORTIS ET FIDELIS, faithful and strong.\nWinding between dense shrubs of rhododendron under darker\ndeodars, the road was long and gloomy, but Lawrence was thankful\nto be out of sight of Chilmark.  He hurried on with his light\nswinging step--light for his build--his tired mind vacant or\nintent only on a bath and a change of clothes, till in the last\nbend, within a hundred yards of Wanhope he came on Mrs. Clowes.\n\nHe never could clearly remember his first sight of her, the shock\nwas too great, but as he came up she put out her hands to him and\nhe took them in his own.  She was still in her evening dress but\nwithout cloak or fur, which had probably slipped off her\nshoulders: they were bare, and her beautiful bodice was torn.\n\"Oh, here you are,\" she said with her faint smile.  \"I was afraid\nyou would come by the field.\" She looked down at herself and made\na weak and ineffective effort to gather her loosened laces\ntogether.  \"I'm--I'm not very tidy, am I?\"\n\nLawrence was carrying an overcoat on his arm.  He put her into\nit, and, as she did not seem able to cope with it, buttoned it\nfor her.  \"What has happened, dear?\"\n\n\"Bernard has turned me out,\" said Laura with the same piteous,\nbewildered smile.  \"Indeed he never let me in.  I went home soon\nafter you left me. The door was shut, I tried the window, but\nthat was shut too, so I had to go back to the door.  I couldn't\nopen it and I rang.  He answered me through the door, 'Who's\nthere?'\"  She ended as if the motive power of speech had died\ndown in her.\n\n\"And you--?\"\n\n\"Oh, I said, 'It's I--Laura.'\"\n\n\"Go on, dear,\" Lawrence gently prompted her.\n\n\"I said 'I'm your wife.' He said 'I have no wife.' And he called\nme--coarse names, words I couldn't repeat to any one. I couldn't\nanswer him.  Then he said 'Where's Hyde?  Are you there, Hyde?'\nand that you were a coward or you wouldn't stand by and hear him\ncalling me a--what he had called me. So I told him you weren't\nthere, that you had gone back with Isabel and Val.  He said:\nafter you had had all you wanted out of me--I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  Go on, dear: tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"But ought I to?\" said Laura, raising her dimmed eyes to his\nface.  \"It's such a horrible story to tell a man, especially the\nvery man who--I feel so queer, Lawrence: don't let me say\nanything I ought not!\"\n\n\"Laura dear, whatever you say is sacred to me. Besides, I'm your\ncousin by marriage, and it's my business to think and act for\nyou: let me help you into this alley.\" A little further on there\nwas a by-path through the shrubberies, and Lawrence drew her\ntowards it, but her limbs were giving way under her, and after a\nmomentary hesitation he carried her into it in his arms.  \"There:\nsit on this bank.  Lean on me,\" he sat down by her.  \"Is that\nbetter?\"\n\n\"Oh yes: thank you: I'm so glad to be out of the drive,\" said\nLaura, letting her head fall, like a child, on his shoulder.  \"I\nseem to have been there such a long while. I didn't know where to\ngo.  Once a tradesman's cart drove by, the butcher's it was: you\nknow Bernard gets so cross because they will drive this way to\nsave the long round by the stables.  He stared at me, but I\ndidn't know what to do.\"  Lawrence repressed a groan: it would be\nall over the village then, there was no help for it.  \"Where was\nI to go in these clothes?  I did wish you would come, I always\nfeel so safe with you.\"\n\nLawrence silently stroked her hair.  His heart was riven.  \"So\nsafe?\" and this was all his doing.\n\n\"Was the door locked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he refused to open it?\"\n\n\"No, he did open it.\"\n\n\"He did open it, do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, because--oh, my head.\"\n\n\"You aren't hurt anywhere, are you?\" asked Lawrence, feeling cold\nto his fingertips.\n\n\"No, no,\" she roused herself, dimly sensible of his anxiety,\n\"it's only that I feel faint, but it's passing off.  No, I don't\nwant any water!  I'd far rather you stayed with me.  It's such a\ncomfort to have you here.\" Lawrence was speechless.  Her hands\nwent to her hair.  \"Oh dear, I wish I weren't so untidy!  Never\nmind, I shall be all right directly: it does me more good than\nanything else just to tell you about it.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me then.\"\n\n\"The door was locked,\" she continued languidly but a thought more\nclearly, \"and the chain was up and Bernard's couch was drawn\nacross inside.  He must have got Barry to wheel it over.  When I\nbegged him to let me in he unlocked the door but left it on the\nchain so that it would only open a few inches. I tried to push my\nway in, but he held me back.\"\n\n\"Laura, did he strike you?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Laura with greater energy than she had yet shown.\nLawrence drew a breath of relief.  He had felt a horrible fear\nthat her faintness might be the result of a blow or a fall.  \"Oh,\nhow could you think that?  All he did was to put his hand out\nflat against my chest and push me back.\"\n\n\"But your dress is torn\" said Lawrence, sickening over the\nquestion yet feeling that he must know all.\n\n\"His ring caught in it.  These crepe de chine dresses tear if you\nlook at them.\"\n\n\"Well, did you give it up after that?\"\n\n\"No, oh no: I never can be angry with Berns because it--it isn't\nBerns really,\" she glanced up at Lawrence with her pleading eyes.\n\"It's a possession of the devil.  He suffers so frightfully,\nLawrence: he never ceases to rebel, and no one can soothe him but\nme.  So that I hadn't the heart to leave him.  You'll think it\npoor-spirited of me, but I--I can't help loving the real\nBernard, a Bernard you've never seen.  So I waited because--I\nnever can make Yvonne understand--I am so sorry for him: he\nhurts himself more than me--\"\n\nLawrence started.  The echo struck strangely on his ear. \"I\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"You always understand.  So I tried again; I said: would he at\nleast let me go to my room and change my clothes and get some\nmoney.  But he said it was your turn to buy my clothes now.  When\nI'd convinced myself that he was unapproachable, I thought of\ntrying to get in by a side door or through the kitchen.  It would\nhave been ignominious, but anything was better than standing on\nthe steps; Bernard was talking at the top of his voice, and the\nmaids were at the bedroom windows overhead.  I didn't look up but\nI saw the curtains flutter.\"\n\n\"Servants don't matter much.  But you did quite right.  What\nhappened?\"\n\n\"He held me by the arm as I turned to go, and told me that all\nthe doors and windows were locked and that he had given orders\nnot to admit me: not to admit either of us.\"\n\n\"Either you or--?\"\n\n\"Yourself.  If we liked to stay out all night together we could\nstay out for ever.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me.\" She shuddered and drooped, and the colour came up\ninto her face, a rose-pink patch of fever.  \"I can't remember any\nmore.\"\n\n\"He must have gone raving mad.\"\n\n\"He is not mad, Lawrence.  But he has indulged his imagination\ntoo long and now it has the mastery of him,\" said Laura slowly.\n\"It's fatal to do that.  'Withstand the beginning: after-remedies\ncome too late.' Ever since you came he's been nursing an\nimaginary jealousy of you: though he knew it was imaginary, he\nindulged it as though it were genuine: and now it has turned on\nhim and got him by the throat.  Oh, he is so unhappy?  But what\ncan I do?\"\n\nWhat, indeed?  Lawrence, recalling Val's warning, subdued a curse\nor a groan.  \"A house full of the materials for an explosion.\"\nAnd he had lived in that house--blind fool!--week after week\nand had noticed nothing!  \"Why--why did no one warn me before?\"\nhe stammered.  \"My poor Laura!  Why didn't you send me away?\"\n\n\"But if it hadn't been you it would have been someone else!\" said\nMrs. Clowes simply.  \"At one time it was Val: then it was Dr.\nVerney's junior partner, who attended me for influenza while Dr.\nVerney was away: and once it was a young chauffeur we had, who\nhappened to be a University man.  I did get rid of him, because\nhe found out, and that made everything so awkward.  But I\ncouldn't get rid of Val, and in many ways I was most unwilling to\nlet you go,--you did him so much good.  But I'd made up my mind\nto turn you out: Yvonne was at me--\" she paused--\"yes, it\nreally was only yesterday!  I promised her to speak to you this\nmorning.  Well, I've done it!\"\n\n\"Did you explain to Bernard that Selincourt and Isabel were with\nus all the time?\"\n\n\"He talked me down.\"\n\n\"He must be made to listen to reason.\"\n\n\"He won't: not yet.  Later, perhaps, but not in time to save the\nsituation.  Never mind, you're not married, and if he does\ndivorce me people will only say 'Another Selincourt gone wrong.'\"\nA dreary and rather cynical gleam of humour played over Laura's\nlips. \"I'm sorry mainly for Yvonne, Jack's people are so\nparticular; they hated the marriage, and now, when she's lived it\nall down and made them fond of her, I must needs go and\ncompromise myself and drag our wretched family into the mud\nagain!\"\n\n\"Good heavens! he can't propose to divorce you?\"\n\n\"He said he would.\"\n\nBit by bit it was all coming out, the cruel and sordid drama\nplayed before an audience of housemaids, as one admission led to\nanother and her strength revived for the ordeal.  Lawrence\nshuddered and sat silent, trying to gauge the extent of the\nmischief.  \"What can I do?\" said Laura.  She looked down at\nherself and blushed again.  \"I do feel so--so disreputable in\nthese clothes. I haven't even been able to wash my face and hands\nor tidy my hair since I left the hotel.\"\n\n\"Have you been wandering about in the drive all this time?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.  I was afraid to go into the road in such a\npickle.\"\n\n\"These infernal clothes!\" Lawrence burst out exasperated.  Their\nwretched plight was reduced to farce by the fact that they were\nlocked out of their bedrooms, unable to get at their wardrobes,\ntheir soaps and sponges and brushes, his collars, her hairpins,\nall those trifles of the toilette without which civilized man can\nscarcely feel himself civilized.  Most of these wants the\nvicarage could supply; but to reach the vicarage they had to\ncross the road.  Lawrence got up and stood looking down at Laura.\n\"Can you trust your maid?\"\n\n\"Trust her? I can't trust her not to gossip.  She's a nice girl\nand a very good maid, but I've only had her a year.\"\n\n\"Silly question!  One doesn't trust servants nowadays.  My man's\na scamp, but I can depend on him up to a certain point because I\npay him well.  Anyhow we must make the best of a bad job.  If I\ncut straight down from here I shall get into the tradesmen's\ndrive, shan't I?\"\n\n\"But you can't go to the back door!\"\n\n\"Apparently I can't go to the front,\" said Lawrence with his\nwintry smile.  He promised himself to go to the front by and by,\nbut not while Laura was shivering in torn clothes under a bush.\n\n\"But what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Simply to get us a few necessaries of life.  You can't be seen\nlike this, and you can't stand here forever, catching cold with\nnext to nothing on: besides, you've had no food since five\no'clock this morning--and not much then.\"\n\n\"But the servants--if they have orders--\"\n\n\"Servants!\" He laughed.\n\n\"But you don't mean to force your way in?\"\n\n\"Not past Bernard, dear.  Don't be afraid: I shall skulk in by\nthe rear.\"\n\nIt was easy to say \"Don't be afraid\": doubly easy for Lawrence,\nwho had never known Bernard's darker temper.  But there was no\ncoward blood in Mrs. Clowes, and she steadied herself under the\nrallying influence of Hyde's firm look and tone.\n\n\"Go, then, but don't be long.  And, Lawrence promise me. . .\"\n\n\"Anything, dear.\"\n\n\"You won't touch Bernard, will you?\"  Lawrence was dumb, from wonder,\nnot from indecision.  \"No one can do that,\" said Laura under her\nbreath.  \"Oh, I know you wouldn't dream of it.  But yet--if he\ninsulted you, if he struck you . . . if he insulted me. . . ?\"\n\n\"No, on my honour.\"\n\nHe touched her hand with his lips--a ceremony performed by\nLawrence only once beforehand in what different circumstances!--\nand left her: more like a winter butterfly than ever, with her\nshining hair, pale face, and gallant eyes, and the silver threads\nof her embroidered skirt flowing round her over the sunburnt\nturf.\n\nWanhope was an old-fashioned house, and the domestic premises\nwere much the same as they had been in the eighteenth century, except\nthat Clowes had turned one wing of the stables into a garage and\nrooms for the chauffeur.  He kept no indoor menservants except Barry,\nthe groom and gardener living in the village, while three or four\nmaids were ample to wait on that quiet family.  Pursuing the\ntradesman's drive between coach-house, tool shed, coal shed, and\nmiscellaneous outbuildings, Lawrence emerged on a brick yard, ducked\nunder a clothes-line, made for an open doorway, and found himself in\nthe scullery.  It was empty, and he went on into a big old-fashioned\nkitchen, draughty enough with its high roof and blue plastered walls.\nHere, too, there was not a soul to be seen: a kettle was furiously\nboiling over on the hob, a gas ring was running to waste near by,\nturned on but left unlit and volleying evil fumes.  His next\nresearches carried him into a flagged passage, on his right a sunlit\npantry, on his left a dingy alcove evidently dedicated to the\ntrimming of lamps and the cleaning of boots.  He began to wonder if\nevery one had run away.  But no: a sharp turn, a couple of steps, and\nhe came on an inner door, comfortably covered with green baize,\nthrough which issued a perfect hubbub of voices all talking at once.\nHe listened long enough to hear himself characterized by a baritone\nas a stinking Jew, and by a treble as not her style and a bit too gay\nbut quite the gentleman, before he raised the latch and stepped in.\n\nHis appearance produced a perfect hush.  Except Barry and his own\nvalet they were all there, the entire domestic staff of Wanhope:\nand to face them was not the least courageous act that Lawrence\nhad ever performed.  It was a large, comfortable room, lit by\nlarge windows overlooking the kitchen garden; a cheerful fire\nburnt in the grate this autumn morning, and in a big chair before\nit sat a cheerful, comely person in a print gown, in whom he\nrecognized Mrs. Fryar the cook.  Gordon the chauffeur, a\npragmatic young man from the Clyde, in this levelling hour was\nsitting on the edge of the table with a glass of beer in his\nhand.  Caroline, the Baptist housemaid, held the floor: she was\ndeclaiming, when Lawrence entered, that it was a shame of Major\nClowes and she didn't care who heard her say so, but apparently\nLawrence was an exception, for like all the rest she was\ninstantly stricken dumb as the grave.\n\nLawrence remained standing in the open doorway.  He would have\ngiven a thousand pounds to be in morning attire, but no\nconstraint was perceptible in the big, careless, impassive figure\nframed against the sunlit yard.\n\n\"Are you Mrs. Clowes's maid?\" he singled out a tall, rather\nstiff, quiet-looking girl in the plain black dress of her\ncalling.  \"Is your name Catherine? I want to speak to you.\"\n\nShe stood up--they were all standing by now except Gordon--but\nshe looked at him very oddly, as if she were half frightened and\nhalf inclined to be familiar. \"I suppose you can tell me where\nmy lady is, sir?\"\n\n\"She is waiting for you,\" said Lawrence. \"I say that I want to\nspeak to you by yourself.  Come in here, please.\" Catherine\ncontinued to look as if she felt inclined to flounce and toss her\nhead, but under his cold and steady eyes she thought better of it\nand followed him into the pantry. Lawrence shut the door.\n\n\"I'd have gone to my lady, sir, if I'd known where she was.\"\n\n\"You're going to her now,\" said Lawrence.  \"I want you, please,\nto run up to her room and fetch some clothes, the sort of clothes\nshe would wear to go out walking: you understand what I mean?  A\njacket and dress and hat, walking boots, a veil--\" Catherine\nintimated that she did understand: much better than any\ngentleman, her smile implied.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she suggested, \"what you would like is for me to pack\na small box for her, sir?  My lady will want a lot of things that\ngentlemen don't think of: underskirts and--\"\n\n\"Good God, what do I care?\" said Lawrence impatiently.  \"No,\nnothing of that sort: take just what she wants to change out of\nevening dress into morning dress.  It'll be only for a few hours.\nGo and get them, and be as quick and quiet as you can.  Say\nnothing to Major Clowes.\" He laid his hand on her shoulder.\n\"Are you a decent girl, I wonder?\"\n\nShe drew up and for the first time looked him straight in the\neyes. \"If you mean, sir, that you're going to take my poor lady\naway, why, I think it's high time too.  I was always brought up\nrespectable, but when it comes to a gentleman calling his own\nmarried wife such names, why, it's time some one did interfere.\nI heard him with my own ears call her a--\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" said Lawrence.\n\n\"And struck her, that he did, which you ought to know,\" Catherine\npersisted eagerly: \"put his arm out through the door and gave her\na great blow! and it's not the first time neither.  Many's the\nnight when I've undressed my lady but perhaps you've seen for\nyourself--\"\n\nShe stopped short and put her hand over her mouth.\n\n\"Go and get the things,\" said Lawrence, \"then wait for me in the\nyard.\"\n\nCatherine retired in disorder and Lawrence followed her out.  He\nfound Barry waiting to speak to him.  \"Where's my man?\" Lawrence\nasked. \"Send him to me, will you?\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir, but are you going to speak to Major Clowes?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nBarry looked down.  \"His orders was that you weren't to be\nadmitted, sir.\"\n\n\"How is Major Clowes?\"\n\n\"Very queer.  I took it on myself to send for the doctor, but he\nwas out: but they sent word that he'd step round as soon as he\ncame in.  I'd have liked to catch Mr. Val, but he slipped off\nwhile I was waiting on the Major.\"\n\n\"But Major Clowes isn't ill?\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir.  But I don't care for so much responsibility.\"\n\n\"Shall I have a look at him?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" a much more decided negative. \"I wouldn't go near the\nMajor, sir, not if I was you.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with him?\" Lawrence asked curiously.  But\nBarry refused to commit himself beyond repeating that the Major\nwas very queer, and after promising to send Val to the rescue\nLawrence dismissed him, as Gaston came hurrying up.  Something\nsuspiciously like a grin twinkled over the little Frenchman's\nface when he found his master waiting for him on the sill of\nCaroline's pantry, silhouetted against row on row of shining\nglass and silver, and wearing at noon-day the purple and fine\nlinen, the white waistcoat and thin boots of last night.  But his\nFrench breeding triumphed and he remained, except for that one\nfurtive twinkle, the conscientious valet, nescient and urbane.\nLawrence did not give him even so much explanation as he had\ngiven Catherine.  \"Is there a back staircase?\" he asked, and\nthen, \"Take me up by it.  I'm going to my room.\"\n\nGaston led the way through the servants' hall. Lawrence,\nfollowing, had to fight down a nausea of humiliation that was\nalmost physical: he had never before done anything that so\nsickened him as this sneaking progress through the kitchen\nquarters in another man's house.  At length Gaston, holding up a\nfinger to enjoin silence, brought him out on the main landing\noverlooking the hall.\n\nThere was no carpet on the polished floor but Lawrence when he\nchose could tread like a cat.  He stepped to the balustrade.  It\nwas as dark as a dark evening, for the great doors were still\nfast shut, and what scanty light filtered through the painted\npanes was absorbed, not reflected, by raftered roof, panelled\nwalls, and Jacobean stair.  But as he grew used to the gloom he\ncould distinguish Bernard's couch and the powerful prostrate\nfigure stretched out on it like a living bar.  Bernard's arms\nwere crossed over his breast: his features were the colour of\nstone: he might have been dead.\n\nLawrence was startled.  But he could do no good now, and the\nFrenchman was fidgeting at his bedroom door.  Later . . .\n\nSecure of privacy Gaston's decorum relaxed a trifle, for it was\nclear to him that confidences must be at least tacitly exchanged:\nM'sieur le captaine could not hope to keep him in the dark, there\nnever was an elopement yet of which valet and lady's maid were\nnot cognizant. Like Catherine, \"You wish I pack for you, Sare?\"\nhe asked in his lively imperfect English.  He was naturally a\nchatterbox and brimful of a Parisian's salted malice, even after\nsix years in the service of Captain Hyde, who did not encourage\nhis attendants to be communicative.\n\nLawrence was tearing off his accursed evening clothes. (All day\nit had been the one drop of sweetness in his bitter cup that he\nhad borrowed Lucian's razor and shaved in Lucian's rooms.) \"Get\nme a tweed suit and boots.\"\n\nGaston frowned, wrinkling his nose: if M'sieur imagined that that\nnose had no scent for an affair of gallantry--!  But still he\npersisted, even he, though the snub was a bitter pill: himself a\ngallant man, could allow for jaded nerves.  \"You wish I pack,\nyes?\" he deprecated reticence by his insinuatingly sympathetic\ntone.\n\n\"No,\" said Lawrence, tying his tie before a mirror.  \"I'm coming\nback.\"\n\n\"'Ere?  Back--so--'ere, m'sieur?\"\n\n\"Yes, before tonight.\"\n\nIt was more than flesh and blood could stand. \"Sir Clowes 'e say\nno,\" remarked Gaston in a detached and nonchalant tone, as he\ngathered up the garments which his master had strewn over the\nfloor. \"'E verree angree.  'E say 'Zut! m'sieur le captaine est\nparti!--il ne revient plus.'\"\n\n\"Gaston.\" The Frenchman turned from the press in which he was\nhanging up Lawrence's coat.  \"You're a perfect scamp, my man,\"\nLawrence spoke over his shoulder as he ran through the contents\nof a pocketbook, \"and I should be sorry to think you were\nattached to me.  But your billet is comfortable, I believe: I pay\nyou jolly good wages, you steal pretty much what you like, and\nyou have the additional pleasure of reading all my letters.  Now\nlisten: I'm coming back to Wanhope before tonight and so is Mrs.\nClowes.  I'm not going to run away with her, as Major Clowes gave\nyou all to understand.  What you think is of no importance\nwhatever to any one, what you say is equally trilling, but I\ndon't choose to have my servant say it: so, if you continue to\ndrop these interesting hints, I shall not only boot you out, but\"\n--he turned \"I shall give you such a thrashing in the rear,\nGaston--in this direction, Gaston--that you won't be able to\nsit down comfortably for a month.\"\n\n\"M'sieur is so droll,\" murmured Gaston, removing himself with\ndignified agility and an unabashed grimace.\n\nLawrence let himself out by the back stairs again and the kitchen\n--now in a state of great activity, the gas ring lit and\npreparations for lunch going on apace--and forth into the yard.\nOut in the open air he drew a long breath: safe in tweeds and a\nfelt hat, he was his own man again, but he felt as though he had\nbeen wading in mud.  The mystified Catherine followed him at a\nsign into the drive. There Hyde stood still.  \"Take that path to\nthe left.  You'll find your mistress waiting for you.  Help her\nto dress, and tell her I shall be at the lodge gates when she's\nready.  And, Catherine--\"\n\nHe paused, feeling an almost insuperable distaste for his job.\nBut it had to be done, the girl must not find him tight with his\nmoney: that she would hold her tongue was beyond expectation, but\nif well tipped at least she might not invent lies.  It went\nagainst the grain of his temper to bribe one of Bernard's maids,\nbut fate was not now consulting his likes or dislikes.  He thrust\nhis hand into his pocket--\"Look after your mistress, will you?\"\n\nThe respectably brought up Catherine turned scarlet. She put her\nhand behind her back. \"I'm sure, sir, I don't want your money to\nmake me do that!\"\n\n\"If you prick us shall we not bleed?\" It was the first time that\nLawrence had ever discovered a servant to be a human being: and\nhis philosophical musings were chequered, till he moved out of\nearshot, by the clamour of Catherine's irrepressible dismay.\n\"Oh madam!\"  he heard, and, \"Well, if I ever-!\" and then in a\ntone suddenly softened from horror to sympathy, \"there now,\nthere, let me get your dress off . . . .\"  From Mrs. Clowes came\nno answer, or none audible to him.\n\nLaura joined him in ten minutes' time, neatly dressed, gloved,\nand veiled, her hair smoothed--it had never been rough so far as\nLawrence could observe--her complexion regulated by Catherine's\npowder puff.  \"Are you better?\" said Lawrence, examining her\nanxiously: \"able to walk as far as the vicarage?\"\n\n\"The vicarage?\"\n\n\"Wharton's too far off.  You're dead tired:  You'll have to lie\ndown and keep quiet.  Isabel will look after you.\" It speaks to\nthe complete overthrow of Lawrence's ideas that for the last hour\nhe had not recollected Isabel's existence. \"And we shall have to\nwait till Bernard raises the siege: one can't bawl explanations\nthrough a keyhole.  Besides, I must wire to Lucian.\" He slipped\nhis hand under her arm.  \"Would you like this good girl of yours\nto come with you?\"\n\n\"I will come, madam, directly I've fetched my hat,\" said\nCatherine eagerly.  \"You must have some one to look after you,\nand your hair never brushed and all.\"\n\nBut Laura shook her head, Catherine must not defy her master.\n\"If you want to please me,\" she said not without humour \"--I\ncan't help it, Lawrence--try to look after Major Clowes.  You\nhad better not go near him yourself, because as you know he isn't\nvery pleased with me just now, but see that Mrs. Fryar sends him\nin a nice lunch and ask Barry to try to get him to eat it. I\nordered some oysters to come this morning, and Major Clowes will\nenjoy those when he won't touch anything else.\"\n\nCatherine watched her lady up the road with a disappointed eye.\nIt was a tame conclusion to a promising adventure.  Although\nrespectably brought up, her sympathies were all with Captain Hyde:\nshe had foreseen herself, the image of regretful discretion,\nsacrificing her lifelong principles to escort Mrs. Clowes to\nBrighton, or Switzerland, or that place where they had the little\nhorses that Mr. Duval made such a 'mysterious joke about--it would\nhave been amusing to do foreign parts with Mr. Duval.  But when Laura\ntook the turning to the vicarage Catherine was invaded by a creeping\nchill of doubt.  Was it possible that Captain Hyde was not Mrs.\nClowes's lover after all?\n\n\"I know which I'd choose,\" she said to Gordon. \"I've no patience\nwith the Major.  Such a way to behave! and my poor lady with the\npatience of an angel, putting up and putting up--  No man's worth\nit, that's what I say.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a bit thick,\" said Gordon: \"calling his own wife a--\"\n\n\"Mr.  Gordon!\"\n\nThe son of the Clyde was a contentious young man, and a jealous\none.  \"You didn't seem to mind when the French chap was talking\nabout a fille de joy.  What d'ye suppose a fille de joy is in\nEnglish? but there's some of us can do no wrong.\"\n\n\"French sounds so much more refined,\" said Catherine firmly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nInaction was hard on Lawrence.  He hated it: and he was not used\nto it: his impulse was to go direct to Wanhope and break down the\ndoor: but it was not to be done.  When he reached the vicarage\nMr. Stafford had gone out after an early lunch to take a wedding\nin Countisford, while Val had been obliged to ride over to a\nneighbouring farm.  Leaving Laura to Isabel, who startled him by\nher cool \"So Major Clowes has done it at last?\" he hurried down\nto the post office to telephone to Selincourt (aware on his way\nthat every eye was staring at him: no doubt the tale was already\non every lip), but Selincourt too was out, and he had to be\ncontent with despatching colourless duplicate telegrams to his\nrooms and club.  From a hint let fall during the night he was\naware that no more than the most laconic wire would be needed,\nbut he fretted under the delay, which meant that Selincourt could\nnot arrive before six o'clock.  After that he would have liked to\ngo to Wharton, but dared not, for, though Jack's grandfather was\nwhat Yvonne called a Romantic, the Grantchesters were old-fashioned\nstraightlaced people who had better not hear of the scandal till it\nwas over.  No, till Selincourt and Val appeared there was no more to\nbe done, and Lawrence, returned to the vicarage and flung himself\ninto a chair to wait. He dreaded inaction: inaction meant thought:\nand thought meant such bitter realities as he knew not how to stand\nup against: but what he liked or disliked was no longer to the point.\n\nIn that easy-going household, where comfort was obtained at the\nexpense of appearances, there was always a diningroom fire in\ncold weather, and on this September morning the glow of the\nflames had a lulling effect.  Dead tired, he dropped asleep, to\nbe roused by the feeling that there was some one in the room.\nThere was, it was Isabel; and in the drugged heaviness that\nfollows daylight slumber Hyde simply held out his arms to her in\noblivion of last night.  \"Oh, oh!\" said Isabel smiling at him\nand touching his palms with the tips of her fingers, \"were you\ndreaming of me?\"  Hyde drew back, a deep flush covering his face.\nWhat had changed Isabel? she was pure fascination.  \"I've been\nwatching you a long time while you were asleep. I thought you\nwould never wake.  You're so, so tired!  Here's a cup of coffee\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lawrence, entirely subdued.\n\nHe still felt half dazed: confused and shy, emotions the harder\nto disguise because they were so unfamiliar: and restless under\nIsabel's merry eyes.  How near she was to him, the leaping flames\nflinging a dance of light and shadow over her silk shirt, and the\nbloom on her cheek, and the dark hair parted on one side (a\nboyish fashion which he had always disliked) and waved over her\nhead! So near that without rising he could have pressed his lips\nto that white throat of hers. . . . Last night it had been beauty\nclouded, beauty averse, but this morning it was beauty in the\nmost delicate and derisive and fleeting sunlight of pleasure; and\nthe temperament of his race delivered Lawrence hand and foot into\nits power.  The deep waters went over him and he ceased to\nstruggle--\"Isabel,\" he heard himself saying in a level voice but\nwithout his own volition, \"should you mind if I were to kiss\nyou?\"\n\nWhat a banality to ask of a woman, his second self scoffed at\nhim: a woman who should be kissed or left alone, but never asked\nfor a kiss!\n\n\"Not very much,\" said Isabel, presenting her smooth cheek.  \"Not\nif it would do you any good.\"\n\nOh irony, oh disenchantment!  \"Thank you.\"  He curbed his passion\nand sat still.  \"I am not Val.\"\n\n\"Shut your eyes then.\"\n\nHe held his breath: the thick beating of his heart was like a\nmuffled hammer.\n\n\"This isn't the way I kiss Val.\"\n\n\"Isabel!\" exclaimed Lawrence.  He held out his arms again but\nthey closed on the empty firelight: she had gone dancing off, the\nmost fugitive, the most insubstantial of mistresses, nothing left\nof her to him but the memory of that moth's wing touch.\n\n\"Isabel,  come here!\" He, sprang to his feet.  From the other end\nof the room Isabel turned round, wistful, her head bent, glancing\nup at him under her eyelashes.\n\n\"Oh must you have me?--all of me?  Oh Lawrence!--well then--\"\n\nShe advanced step by step, slowly.  Lawrence waited, convinced\nthat if he tried to seize her she would be gone, such a vague\nthistledown grace there was in her slender immaturity.  He waited\nand Isabel came to him, drifted into his arms, was lying for a\nmoment on his breast, and then, \"Let me go: dearest, don't hold\nme!\"\n\nHe kept her long enough to ask \"But are you mine?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Isabel, sighing.\n\n\"This is a grudging gift, Isabel.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" she whispered, \"not grudging.  All my heart: all of me.\nOnly don't hold me, I'm still afraid.\"\n\n\"Of me?\"\n\n\"Yes: now are you triumphant?\" She escaped.\n\n\"Will you sit down in a chair, you sprite, and let me kneel at\nyour ladyship's feet?\"\n\n\"No--yes--No, you too sit down.\" Then as Lawrence, enchained,\nrelapsed into the deep easy chair by the fire, she came behind\nand leant over him, wreathing her arms over his shoulders.\n\"There: now lie still: so: is that cosy for you?  Now will you go\nto sleep?\"\n\n\"Circe . . .\"\n\n\"You don't feel as though you were going to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" Lawrence murmured under his breath.\n\n\"Don't say that,\" her voice was so soft that it was like the\nvoice of his own heart speaking to him, \"it isn't a proper reply\nto make when a lady says she loves you.\"\n\n\"Oh! provided that you do love me--!\"\n\nShe took his temples between her fingertips and again her\nenchanting caress brushed his lips. Lawrence lay helpless.  It\nwas like receiving the caresses of a fairy: a delight and a\ntorment, a serenity and a flame.  \"I love you.  I will marry you.\nI shall be a most exacting wife, 'December when I wed.' Very soon\nyou'll wish you had never set eyes on me.  You'll have to marry\nVal too and all the family.\" Her long lashes were fluttering\nagainst his cheek. \"As you're thirty-six and I'm only nineteen,\nyou'll have to be very docile or I shall tell you you're\nungenerous.\"\n\n\"Presuming on my income, as you said--was it last night?\"\n\n\"When you were free.  Does it seem so long ago?\" She gave a\nlittle laugh, airy and sweet. \"Oh poor Benedict!  Would you like\nto cry off?  Let me see: you may scratch any time before I tell\nVal, which will be when he comes in at five o'clock.  Now then?\"\n\nThis mention of Val was like a dash of cold water, and Lawrence\ntried to rouse himself.  \"Will you be serious for half a second,\nyou incarnation of mischief?\"\n\n\"No--yes--no, I don't want to be serious,\" she turned in his\narms and the Isabel of last night pierced him with her dark,\nhumid, brilliant eyes.  \"I want to forget.  Make me forget!\"\n\n\"Forget what?\"\n\n\"Other women.\"\n\n\"There are no other women, Isabel.\"\n\n\"There have been.--Lawrence!\" the scent of the honeysuckle\npinned into her blouse seemed to narcotize all his senses with\nits irresistible sweetness, \"you will be true to me, won't you?\nYou won't love other women now?  Say you never wanted to kiss any\nof them so much as--  Oh!\" Drunk with her Circean cup, Hyde was\nmore than willing to convince her, but in a fashion of his own.\nIsabel gave a little sigh and faded out of his clasp: he tried to\nseize her but she was gone, leaving only the scent of bruised\npetals and the memory of a silken contact.  \"You're so--so\nstormy,\" the gossamer voice mocked him with its magic of youth\nand gaiety. \"Val says--\"\n\n\"Isabel, I'm sick of that formula.  You're going to marry me, not\nVal.\"\n\n\"--You're not one-third English.\"\n\n\"I've lived in countries where they knew how to manage women,\"\nLawrence muttered.\n\n\"With a whip?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What a pity!\"\n\n\"No, the other method is more effective.\"\n\n\"You terrify me,\" her eyes were sparkling now like a diamond.\n\"Don't fling any more of those dark threats at me or I shall\nnever marry you at all.  Some day you'll be madly jealous of me like\nMajor Clowes--you are like him: you could be just as brutal: and I'm\nnot like Laura--and you'll lure me out of England and wreak a\nmysterious vengeance.\"\n\n\"I wish we were out of England now.\"\n\n\"So do I.  Oh Lawrence, I'd sell my soul to go to Egypt!\"\n\n\"Red-hot days and blue sands in the moonlight.  Shall I take you\nthere for our honeymoon?\"\n\n\"Or Spain: or Sicily: or what about Majorea?--  Let's slip off\nalone in a nom de plume and an aeroplane to some place where no\none ever goes, all roses and lemon thyme and honey-coloured\ncliffs and a bay of blue sea--\"\n\n\"Should you like to be alone with me?\"\n\n\"Yes ... why not?\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Hyde laughing.  \"I see no reason if you don't.\" He\nput his hand before his eyes, which were throbbing as though he\nhad looked too long at a bright light.  But Isabel pulled down\nhis wrist.  \"Don't do that.  I like to watch your eyes.  I allow\nno reserves, Lawrence.  And isn't it rather too late to lock the\ndoor?  I've seen you--\"\n\n\"Isabel!\" He freed himself and stood up. \"I beg your pardon, but\nyou must not--  I can't stand--\" His face was burning.  Isabel had\nnot realized--it is difficult for a young girl to realize,\nconvinced of her own insignificance--how deeply his pride had\nbeen cut overnight, but she was under no delusion now.  He was\nhot with shame and anger, and had to wait to fight them down\nbefore he could go on.  \"Nineteen are you--or nine?  I can't\nplay with you today.  Make allowance for me, dearest!  I'm in a\nmost difficult position.  I've done incalculable mischief, and,\nto tell you the truth, I shouldn't have chosen to raise this\nsubject again till I'm clear of it.  Your people may very fairly\nobject.  My cousin is threatening a divorce action.  He's mad:\nand no decent lawyer would take his case into court: but the fact\nremains that poor Laura has been turned out of doors, and for\nthat I am, in myself-centred carelessness, to blame.  You won't\nmisunderstand me, will you, if I say that while this abominable\nbusiness is hanging over me we can't be formally engaged?  Val\nmust be told--nothing would induce me to keep him in the dark\nfor an hour.  But for all that I shan't know how to face him.\nWhat! ask him for you, and in the same breath tell him that Laura\nhas been turned adrift because I've compromised her?  If I were Val\nthere'd be the devil and all to pay.  In the meantime I must--I\nmust be sure of you.  But you change like the wind: last night you\nrefused me, and to-day . . .\"  He walked over to the window and stood\nlooking out into the garden, fighting down one of those tremendous\nstorms of memory which swept over him from time to time and made the\npresent seem absolutely one with the past.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\nHe turned, but his voice was thick.  \"Last time I trusted a woman\nshe betrayed me.\"\n\n\"You're thinking of your wife.\"\n\n\"I often think of her,\" Hyde said savagely, \"and wonder if all\nwomen are tarred with the same brush.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is brutal,\" said Isabel, paling: \"but you're tired\nout.\"\n\nIt was true, he was too tired to rest: heartsick and ashamed,\npainfully aware of the immense harm he had done and uncertain how\nto mend it.  This sense of guilt was the more harassing because\nhe was not in the habit of regretting his actions, good or bad:\nbut now he could no longer fling off responsibility: it was\nriveted on him by all the other emotions which Wanhope had\nevoked, pity for Bernard, and affection for Laura, and humility\nbefore Val.\n\nAmong the lilacs a robin was singing his delicate and bold\nwelcome to autumn, and over the window a branch of red roses\nnodded persistently and rhythmically in a draught of wind.\nLawrence stood looking out into the garden of which he saw\nnothing, and Isabel, watching him, felt tears coming into her own\neyes, the tears of that unnerving pity which a woman feels for\nthe man she loves, when she has never before seen him in defeat\nor depression.  No wonder he thought her fickle!  How could he\nread what was dark to her?\n\nIsabel had not deliberately altered her mind in the night.  She\nhad lain down free and risen up bond, waking from sound sleep,\nthe sleep of a child, to find that the silent inner Court of\nAppeal had reversed her verdict while she slept.  Her first\nthought had been, \"I'm going to marry Lawrence!\" For he needed\nher: that was what she had forgotten last night: by his parade of\nwealth he had defeated his own ends, but, her first anger over,\nshe had realized that one should no more refuse a man for being\nrich, than accept him.  Far other were the grounds on which that\ndecision had to be made.  It had been pity that carried Isabel\naway.  Perhaps in any case she could not have held out for long.\n\nDid she expect to be happy?  Scarcely, for she did not trust him\nenough to be frank with him.  Sophisticated men soon tire of candid\nwomen: it was in this faith that Isabel had clouded herself in such\nan iridescence of mystery and coquetry, laughing when she felt more\ninclined to cry, eluding Lawrence when she would rather have rested\nin his arms.  Roses and steel: innocence in a saffron scarf:\nascendancy won and held only by surrender: such was to be the life of\nthe woman who married Lawrence Hyde, as she had seen it long ago on a\nJune evening, and as, with some necessary failings for human\nweakness, she carried it out to the end. If any moralities at all\nwere to be fulfilled in their union, it was for her to impose them,\nfor Hyde had none.  Within the limits of his code of honour he would\nsimply do as he liked.  And with nine-tenths of her nature Isabel\nwould have liked nothing better than to shut her eyes and yield to\nhim as all her life she had yielded to Val, for she too loved red\nroses and sunshine and the pleasure of the senses: but her innermost\nself, the warder of her will, would rather have died than yield, she\nthe child of an ascetic and trained in Val's simple code of duty.\n\nBut there should be compromise: one must not--one need not--cheat\nhim of the pride of his manhood.  Isabel's heart ached for\nher lover.  She could not defend herself against him any longer,\nand in her yielding the warder of her will whispered, \"You may\nyield now.  Not to be frank with him now would be unfair as well\nas unkind.\"\n\nShe came softly to him in the window, and instantly by some\nchange of tension Lawrence discovered to his delight that Circe\nhad vanished.  His mistress was his own now, a girl of nineteen\nwho had promised to be his wife, and he was carried beyond doubt\nor anger by the rush of tenderness which went over him when he\nbegan to taste the sweetness of his victory.  \"Have I won you?\"\nhe whispered, his voice as unsteady as a boy's in his first\npassion. \"You won't fail me?\"\n\n\"Oh never! never!\"\n\n\"You have the most beautiful eyes in the world.  I believe one\nreason why I always secretly liked Val was that his eyes reminded\nme of yours.  I can't stand it when he looks at me under your\neyelashes.  I always want to say 'Here take it Val.'\"\n\n\"Take what?\"\n\n\"Anything he wants.  I'm going to extend a protecting wing over\nmy young brother-in-law.  He shall not, no, I swear he shall not\ncome to grief. I can't stand it, he's too like you.  When did you\nfirst fall in love with me?\"\n\n\"When did you?\"\n\n\"The night you went to sleep in the garden at Wanhope.\"\n\n\"Oh! when you kissed me?\"\n\n\"When I--?\"\n\nIsabel was speechless.\n\n\"How do you know I kissed you, Isabel? I thought you were\nasleep.\"\n\n\"So I was,\" said Isabel, blushing deeply. \"Oh! Captain Hyde, I\nwasn't pretending!  But I woke up directly after, and heard a\nrustling in the wood, and I--I knew, don't ask me: I could feel\n-\"\n\n\"This?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Isabel murmured, resigning herself.\n\n\"How strange!\" said Lawrence under his breath. \"You were asleep\nand you felt me kiss you?\"\n\nShe looked up at him through her eyelashes. \"Is that so strange?\"\n\n\"Rather: because I never did kiss you.\"\n\n\"Not?\"\n\n\"No: I bent over you to do it, but you were so defenceless and so\nyoung, I didn't dare.--  Isabel! my darling! what have I done?\"\n\nThe first days of love are supposed to be blind days, but too\noften they are days of overstrained criticism, when from very\nfear each sees slips and imperfections even where they do not\nexist.  The discovery that she had misjudged Hyde was an\nexquisite joy to Isabel.  This trivial, crucial scruple, of\nmorality or taste, whichever one liked to call it, was the sign\nof a chastity of mind which could coexist, it seemed, with the\ncoarse and careless sins that he had never denied.  After all no\nmarriage on earth is perfect, and husbands as well as wives have\nto make allowances; but as years go on, and affection does its\ndaily work, the rubs are less and less felt, till the time comes\nwhen deeper wisdom can look back smiling on the fears of youth.\nIsabel at nineteen did not possess this wisdom but she had youth\nitself.\n\nThe flames crackled low on the hearth: the wind, a small autumn\nwind, piped weakly round white wall and high chimneypot: outside\nin the garden late roses were shedding their petals loosened by a\ntouch of frost in the night.  \"Tears because you mistrusted me?\"\nsaid Hyde in his soft voice.  \"But why should the Gentile maiden\ntrust a Jew?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nRiding back from Liddiard St. Agnes in the low September\nsunshine, Val became aware of something pleasantly pictorial in\nthe landscape.  It was a day when the hills looked higher than\nusual, the tilt of the Plain sharper, the shadows a darker umber,\nthe light clearer under a softly-quilted autumn sky.  When he\ncrossed a reaped cornfield, the pale golden stalks of stubble to\nwestward were tipped each with a spark of light, so that all the\nupland flashed away from him toward the declining sun.\n\nIn his own mind there was a lull which corresponded with this\nclear quietness of Nature: a pleasant vacancy and a suspension of\npersonal interest, so that even his anxiety about Laura was put\nat a little distance, and he could see her and Bernard, and\nLawrence himself, like figures in a picture, hazed over by a kind\nof moral sunlight--the Grace of God, say, which from Val's point\nof view shapes all our ends:\n\n          I do not ask to see\n          The distant scene: one step enough for me,\n\nthis courage came to Val now without effort, and not for himself\nonly, which would have been easy at any time, but for Laura in\nher difficult married life, and for those other beloved heads on\nwhich he was fated to bring disgrace--his father, Rowsley,\nIsabel: come what might, sorrow could not harm them, nor fear\nannoy.  How quiet it was! the quieter for the wrangling of rooks\nin the border elms, and for the low autumn wind that rustled in\nthe hedgerows: and how full of light the sky, in spite of the\nsoft bloomy clouds that had hung about all day, imbrowning the\nsunshine! far off in the valley doves were grieving, and over the\nreaped and glittering cornstalks curlews were flying and calling\nwith their melancholy--shrill wail, an echo from the sea, while\nsmall birds in flocks flew away twittering as he rode up, and\nsettled again further on, and rose and settled again, always with\na clatter of tiny wings.  Evening coming on: and winter coming\non: and light, light everywhere, and calm, over the harvest\nfields and the darkened copses, and the far blue headlands that\nseemed to lift themselves up into immeasurable serenities of sky.\n\nIt was lucky for Val that he was able to enjoy this quiet hour,\nfor it was soon over.  When he crossed the turf to the diningroom\nwindow, the fire had burnt down into red embers and not much\nlight came in from out of doors under that low ceiling, but there\nwas enough to show him Isabel in Lawrence's arms.  Fatality!  He\nhad not foreseen it, not for a moment: and yet directly he saw it\nhe seemed to have known it all along.  After a momentary\nsuspension of his faculties, during which his ideas shifted much\nas they do when an unfamiliar turns into a familiar road, Val\ntapped on the glass and strolled in, giving his young sister one\nof his light teasing smiles.  \"Am I to bestow my consent,\nIsabel?\"\n\n\"Oh Val!--  Don't be angry, or not with Lawrence anyhow, it wasn't\nhis fault.\"\n\nIsabel disengaged herself but without confusion. Her brother\nwatched her in increasing surprise. Rosy and sparkling, she\nseemed to have grown from child to woman in an hour, as after a\nlate spring the first hot day brings a million buds into leaf.\n\n\"Are you startled?\" she asked, holding up her cheek for a kiss.\n\n\"Not so much so as I should have been twenty-four hours ago.  No,\nI didn't guess--not a bit; I suppose brothers never expect\npeople to want to marry their sisters.  We know too much about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Better run off to the nursery, Isabel,\" said Lawrence.  Isabel\nmade him a little smiling curtsey eloquent of her disdain--it\nwas so like Captain Hyde to be saucy before Val!--and slipped\naway. When Lawrence returned after holding open the door for her,\nhe found a certain difficulty in meeting Val's eyes.\n\n\"And this then is the mysterious attraction that has kept you at\nWanhope all the summer?  Wonderful!  What will Mrs. Jack say?\nBut I suppose nineteen, for forty, has a charm of its own.\"\n\nLawrence was not forty.  But he refused to be drawn.  \"She is\nvery beautiful.\"\n\n\"Oh, very,\" Val was nothing if not cordial.  \"But her face is her\nfortune. I needn't ask if you can keep her in the state to which\nshe's accustomed,\" his eye wandered over the dilapidated vicarage\nfurniture, \"or whether your attentions are disinterested.\nEvidently you're one of those men who like their wives to be\ndependent on them--  Dear me!\"\n\n\"Damn the money!\" said Lawrence at white heat.  \"Jew I may be,\nbut it's you and Isabel that harp on it, not I.\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" Val arched his eyebrows.  \"So sorry to ruffle you,\nbut these questions are in all the etiquette books and some one\nhas to ask them.  If you could look on me as Isabel's father--?\"\n\nIt was too much.  Angry as he was, Lawrence began to laugh.  \"No,\nI won't look on you as Isabel's father,\" he had regained the\nadvantage of age and position, neutralized till now by Val's\ncooler self-restraint. \"I won't look on you as anything but a\nbrother-in-law; a younger brother of my own, Val, if you can\nsupport the relation.  Won't you start fresh with me?  I've not\ngiven you much cause to think well of me up to now, but I love\nIsabel, and I'll do my best to make her happy.  I might find\nforgiveness difficult if I were you, but then,\" for his life he\ncould not have said whether he was in earnest or chaffing Val,\n\"I'm a Jew of Shylock's breed and you're a Christian.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, what is there to forgive?  We're only too\ndelighted and grateful for the honour done us: it's a brilliant\nmatch, of course, far better than she could expect to make.\" A\nduller man than Lawrence could not have missed the secret silken\nmischief.  \"And to me, to all of us, you're more than kind; it's\nnice to feel that instead of losing a sister I shall gain a\nbrother.\"\n\n\"You are an infernal prig, Val!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Val, this time without irony, \"It's easy for you to\ncome with an apology in one hand and a cheque in the other.\"\n\nHe turned away and stood looking out into the garden.  In the\nlilac bushes over the lawn Isabel's robin was still singing his\nwinter carol, and the atmosphere was saturated with the smell of\nwet, dead leaves, the poignant, fatal smell of autumn. \"There's\nwinter in the air tonight,\" said Val half aloud.\n\n\"What?\" said Lawrence startled.\n\n\"I say that life's too short for quarrelling.\" He held out his\nhand.  \"But be gentle with her, she is very young.--  Yes, what is\nit, Fanny?\"\n\n\"Major Clowes's compliments, sir, and he would be glad to see\nCaptain Hyde as soon as convenient.\"\n\nAt Wanhope half an hour later the sun had gone down behind a bank\nof purple fog, and cloud after cloud had put off its vermilion\nglow and faded into a vague dimness of twilight: house and garden\nwere quiet, except for the silver rippling of the river which\nwent on and on, ceaselessly fleeting over shallows or washing\nalong through faded sedge.  These river murmurs haunted Wanhope\nall day and night, and so did the low river-mists: in autumn by\nsix o'clock the grass was already ankle deep and white as a field\nof lilies.\n\nThe tall doors were wide open now: no lamps were lit, but a big\nlog fire blazed on the hearth, and through the empurpled evening\nair the house streamed with flame-light, flinging a ruddy glow\nover leafless acacia and misty turf.  Stretched on his couch in a\nwarm and dark angle by the staircase, Clowes was busy with his\ncollection, examining and sorting a number of small objects which\nwere laid out on his tray: sparks of light winked between his\nfingers as iron or gold or steel turned up a reflecting edge. His\nface as white as his hands, the wide eyes blackened by the\nexpansion of their pupils, he looked like a ghost, but a ghost of\nnormal habits, washed and shaved and dressed in ordinary tweeds.\n\n\"Hullo, Bernard.\"\n\n\"Good evening, Lawrence.  Oh, you've brought Val and--\nSelincourt, is it?  What years since we've met, Selincourt!  Very\ngood of you to come down, and I'm delighted to see you, one can't\nhave too many witnesses.  Mild evening, isn't it?  Leave the\ndoors open, Val, Barry has made up an immense fire, big enough\nfor January.  Now sit down all of you, will you?  I shan't keep\nyou long.\"\n\nPropped high on cushions, he lay like a statue, his huge\nshoulders squared against them as boldly as if he were in the\nsaddle.  Lawrence, so like him in frame and colouring, stood with\nhis back to the hearth: Selincourt with his tired eyes and grey\nhair sat near the door, one hand slipped between his crossed\nknees: Val preferred to stay in the background, a spectator,\ninterested and deeply sympathetic, but a trifle shadowy.  They\nwere three to one, but the dominant personality was that of the\ncripple.\n\n\"It's with you, Lawrence, that I have to do business.  You passed\nlast night with my wife.\"\n\nThe heavy voice was deadened out of all heat except grossness.\nHow had Clowes spent the last twelve hours?  In reliving over and\nover again his wife's fall: defiling her image and poisoning his\nown soul with emanations of a diseased mind, from which\nSelincourt, a straightforward sinner, would have turned in\ndisgust.  Men of strong passions like Bernard need greater\ncontrol than Bernard possessed to curb what they cannot indulge:\nand a mind full of gross imagery was nature's revenge on him for\na love that had been to him \"hungry, and barren, and sharp as the\nsea.\" But for the friend, the brother, and the lover it was\ndifficult to grant him such allowances as would have been made by\na physician.\n\n\"That'll do,\" said Lawrence, raising his hand.  \"Your wife is\ninnocent.  Send any one you like to the hotel--private detective\nif you like--and find out what rooms Miss Stafford and Laura\nhad, or whether Selincourt and I stayed five minutes in the place\nafter the ladies went upstairs.\"\n\n\"So Laura said this morning.\"\n\n\"There's no loophole for suspicion. I went back with Selincourt\nto his rooms and we sat up the rest of the night smoking and\nplaying auction piquet.  He won about five pounds off me.  Ask\nhim: he'll confirm it.\"\n\n\"That's what he came for, isn't it?\" Bernard smiled.  \"My good\nchap, think I don't know that if you gave him a five pound note\nto do it Selincourt would hold the door for you?\"\n\nSelincourt's pale face was scarlet.  \"I say she shall not return\nto him!\" he broke out loudly.  \"If this is a specimen of what\nhe'll say to us, what does he say to her?\"\n\n\"No offence, no offence,'' Bernard bore him down, insolent and\njovial. \"'The Lord commended the unjust steward.' I foresaw that\nLawrence would lie through thick and thin, and if I'd given it a\nthought either way I should have known you'd be brought down to\nback him up.  And quite right too to stand by your sister--the\nmore so that all you Selincourts are as poor as Church rats and\nnaturally don't want your damaged goods back on your hands.  But\ndon't get huffy, keep calm like me.  You deny everything,\nLawrence. Quite right: a man's not worth his salt if he won't lie\nto protect a woman.  Laura also denies everything.  Quite right\nagain: a woman's bound to lie to save her reputation.  But the\nhusband also has his natural function, which is to exercise a\ndecent incredulity.  Perhaps it's a bit difficult for you to\nenter into my feelings.  You're none of you married men and you\ndon't know how it stings a man up when his wife makes him a--\nHallo!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Lawrence, flinging himself into a chair: \"if you\nhave a point, come to it.  I'm pretty well sick of this.\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" said Bernard staring at him.  \"Is it the good\nold-fashioned English word that you can't stomach?  All right, after\ntonight I shan't offend again.  That's my point and I'm coming to\nit as fast as I can.  I won't have any one of the lot of you near\nme again except Val: I acquit him of complicity: he probably\nbelieves Laura innocent.  Don't you, Val?\"\n\n\"There's no evidence whatever against her, outside your\nimagination, old man.\"\n\n\"You're in love with her yourself,\" Bernard retorted brutally.\nVal started, it was the second time in twelve hours.  \"Oh! think\nI haven't seen that?  There's not much I don't see, that goes on\naround me.  Cheer up, I'm not really jealous of you.  Laura never\ncared that for you.  She was my wife for ten days, after all: it\ntakes a man to master her.\"\n\n\"What he wants is a medical man,\" said Lawrence to Selincourt in\na low voice.  He dared not look at Val.\n\n\"After tonight neither Selincourt nor you, Lawrence nor your lady\nfriend will darken my doors again.  Try it on and I'll have you\nwarned off by the police.\"\n\n\"Bernard, you over-rate the attractions of your society.\"\n\n\"Pass to my second point. I don't propose to divorce Laura.\"\n\n\"You couldn't get a divorce, you ass: you've no case.\"\n\n\"But equally I don't propose to take her back. If she lives alone\nand conducts herself decently I'll make her an allowance--say\nfour or five hundred a year.  If she lives with a lover or tries\nto force her way in here I won't give her a stiver.  Now,\nSelincourt, you had better use your influence or you'll have her\nplanted on you directly Lawrence gets sick of her.  If she goes\nfrom me to Lawrence she can go from Lawrence on the streets for\nall I--shut that door, Val!--Keep her out!\"\n\n\"Laura! go away!\" cried Selincourt. The scene was rising into a\nnightmare and his nerves shivered under it.  But he was too late.\nThe wide doorway had filled with people: Laura with her satin\nhair, her flying veil, her ineffaceable French grace of air and\ndress: Isabel bare-headed, very pale and reluctant: and Mr.\nStafford, who had come down to exercise a moderating influence in\nthe direction of compromise.  Isabel edged round towards\nLawrence, while Mr. Stafford stood glancing from one to another\nwith keen authoritative eyes, waiting a chance to strike in.  But\nLaura after her long sleep had recovered her fighting temper and\nwas no longer content to remain a cipher in her own house.  She\nsmiled and shook her head at Lucian, reddening under her dark\nskin.\n\n\"Bernard, have they told you the truth yet?  No, I thought not,\nLawrence was too shy.\" High spirited, for all her sensitiveness,\nshe laid her slight hand on her husband's wrist.  \"Did you think\nif Lawrence stayed on at Wanhope it must be because he admired\nme?  You forget that there are younger and prettier women in\nChilmark than I am.  Lawrence is going to marry Isabel.  It's a\nromantic tale,\" was there a touch of pique in Laura's charming\nvoice? \"and I'm afraid they both of them took some pains to throw\ndust in our eyes.  I've only this moment learnt it from Isabel.\"\nYes, undeniably a trace of pique.  Women like Laura, used to the\nadmiration of men however innocent, cannot forego it without a\nsigh.  She did not grudge Isabel her happiness or even envy it,\nand she had never believed Lawrence to be in love with herself,\nand yet this courtship that had gone on under her blind eyes\nproduced in her a faint sense of irritation, of male defection\nthat had made her look a little silly.  She was aware of it\nherself and faintly amused and faintly ashamed.  \"My time for\nromantic adventure has gone by.  Oh my poor Berns, you forget\nthat I'm thirty-six!\"\n\nHere was the authentic accent of truth.  Clowes heard it, but he\nhad got beyond the point where a man is capable of saying \"I was\nwrong, forgive me.\"  At that moment he no longer desired Laura to\nbe innocent, he would have preferred to justify himself by\nproving her guilty.  \"Take your damned face out of this,\" he\nsaid, enveloping her in an intensity of hate before which Laura's\ndelicate personality seemed to shrivel like a scorched leaf.\n\"Take it away before I kill you.\" He struck her hand from his\nwrist and dashed himself down on the pillow, his great arms and\nshoulders writhing above the marble waist like some fierce animal\ntrapped by the loins.  \"Oh, I can't stand it, I can't stand\nit . . .\"\n\n\"Oh dear, this is awful,\" said Selincourt weakly.  He got up and\nstood in the doorway.  Despair is a terrible thing to watch.  Not\neven Lawrence dared go near Bernard.  It was the priest, inured\nto scenes of grief and rebellion, who came forward with the cold\nstrong common sense of the Christian stoic.  \"But you will have\nto stand it,\" said Mr. Stafford sternly, \"it is the Will of God\nand rebellion only makes it worse.  After all, thousands of men\nof all ranks have had to bear the same trial and with much less\nalleviation.  You know now that your wife is innocent and is\nprepared to forgive you.\" It did not strike Mr. Stafford that men\nlike Bernard Clowes do not care to be forgiven by their wives.\nThere was no confessional box in Chilmark church.  \"You have\nplenty of interests left and plenty of friends: so long as you\ndon't alienate them by behaving in such an unmanly way.  Lift\nhim, Val.--  Come, Major Clowes, you're torturing your wife.  This\nis cowardice--\"\n\n\"Like Val's, eh?\"\n\n\"Like--?\"\n\n\"Like your precious Val behaved ten years ago.\"   Clowes raised\nhimself on his elbows.  \"Aha! how's that for a smack in the eye?\"\n\n\"Val, my darling lad,\" said Mr. Stafford, stumbling a little in\nhis speech, \"what--what is this?\"\n\n\"Poor chap!\" Clowes gave his curt \"Ha ha!\" as he reached out a\nlong arm to turn on all the lights.  \"Who was that chap, Hercules\nwas it, that pulled the temple on his own head?  By God, if my\nlife's gone to pieces, I'll take some of you with me.  You, Val,\nI was always fond of you: tell your daddy, or shall I, what you\ndid in the Great War?\"\n\n\"Bernard. . . .\"\n\n\"Can't stand it, eh?  But, like me, you'll have to stand it.\nCome, come, Val, this is cowardice--\"\n\n\"Lawrence, don't touch him: let it come.\"\n\nBut no one dared touch Clowes.  \"Before his sister!\" Selincourt\nmuttered.  He had no idea what was coming but Val's grey pallor\nfrightened him.  \"And the old man!\" Lawrence added with clenched\nhands.  Clowes ignored them both.  He held the entire group in\nsubjection by sheer savage force of personality.\n\n\"Simple little anecdote of war.  Dale, you remember, was a\nbrother officer of mine.  He was shot in a raid and left hanging\non the German wire. In the night when he was dying another chap\nin our regiment, that had been lying up all day between the lines\nwith a bullet in his ribs, crawled across for him.  The Boches\nopened fire but he got Dale off and started back.  Three quarters\nof the way over they found a third casualty, a subaltern in the\nDorchesters.  This chap wasn't hurt but he was weeping with fear.\nHe had gone to ground in a shellhole during the advance and\nstayed there too frightened to move.  The Winchester man was by\nnow done to the world.  He kicked the Dorchester to his feet and\nordered him to carry on with Dale.  The Dorchester pointed out\nthat if he turned up without a scratch on him, he would probably\nbe shot by court martial, so the other fellow by way of pretext\nput a shot through his arm. 'Now you can tell 'em it was you who\nfetched Dale.' 'Oh I can't, I'm frightened,' says the Dorchester\nboy.  'By God you shall,' says the other, 'or I'll put a second\nbullet through your brains.' Now, Val, you finish telling us how\nyou did the return trip in tears with Dale on your shoulders and\nLawrence at your heels chivying you with a revolver.\"\n\n\"You unutterable devil,\" said Lawrence under his breath, \"who\ntold you that?\"\n\nBernard grinned at him almost amicably.  He had got one blow home\nat last and felt better. \"Why, I've always known it.  Dale told\nme himself.  He lived twenty minutes after you got him in.\"\n\n\"Val,\" said Mr. Stafford, \"this isn't true?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, sir.\"\n\nUndefended, unreserved, stripped even of pride, Val stood up\nbefore them all as if before a firing party, for the others had\ninvoluntarily fallen back leaving him alone. . . . To Lawrence\nthe silence seemed endless, it went on and on, while through the\nopen doorway grey shadows crept in, the leafy smell of night and\nthe liquid river-murmur so much louder than it could have been\nheard by day.  Suddenly, as if he could not stand the strain any\nlonger, Val covered his eyes with his hands.  The movement, full\nof shame galvanized Lawrence into activity.  But he had not the\ncourage to approach Val.  He had but one desire which was to get\nout of the house.\n\n\"Bernard, if you weren't a cripple I'd put the fear of God into\nyou with a stick\"  He stood near the door eyeing his cousin with\na cold dislike more cutting than anger.  \"You're as safe as a\nwoman. But I'm through with you.  I'll never forgive you this,\nnever.  I'm going: and I shall take your wife with me.\" He\nturned.  \"Come, Laura--\"\n\n\"Take care, Lawrence!\" cried Isabel.\n\nShe spoke too late.  Bernard's hand was already raised and a\nglint of steel shone between his fingers.  No one was near enough\nto disarm him.  Unable to move without exposing Laura, Lawrence\nmechanically threw up his wrist on guard, but the trick of\nBernard's left-handed throw was difficult to counter, and\nLawrence was bracing himself for a shock when Val stepped into\nthe line of fire.  Selincourt uttered an exclamation of horror,\nand Val reeled heavily.  \"For me!\" said Lawrence under his\nbreath.  He was by Val in a moment, bending over him, tender and\nprotecting, an arm round his shoulders.  \"Are you hurt, Val?\nWhat is it, old man?\"\n\nStafford had one hand pressed to his side.  \"He meant it for\nyou,\" he said, grimacing over the words as if he had not perfect\ncontrol of his facial muscles.  \"Take care.  Ah! that's better.\"\nSelincourt with a sweep of his arm had sent the remaining\ncontents of the swing-tray flying across the floor.  There was no\nneed of such violence, however, for the devil had gone out of\nBernard Clowes now.  Deathly pale, his eyes blank with startled\nfear, his great frame seemed to break and collapse and he turned\nlike a lost child to his wife: Laura--Laura . . .\"\n\n\"I'm here, my darling.\" In panic, as if the police were already\nat the door, Laura fell on her knees by the low couch.  Come what\nmight he was still her husband, still the man she loved, to be\ndefended against the consequences of his own acts irrespective of\nhis deserts.  There was much of the wife but more of the mother\nin the way she covered him with her arms and breast.  \"No one\nshall touch you, no one.  It was only an accident, you never\nmeant it, and besides Val's only a little hurt--\"\n\nVal, still with that wrenched grimace of pain, turned round and\nleant against Lawrence.  \"Get me out of this,\" he said weakly.\n\"Invent some story.  Anything, but spare her.  Get me out, I'm\ngoing to faint.\"\n\nBetween them, Lawrence and Selincourt carried him out and laid\nhim on the steps.  No one else paid any attention.  Laura was\ntaken up with Bernard.  Mr. Stafford had shuffled over to the\nfire and was stooping down to warm his fingers while Isabel tried\nbrokenly to soothe the anguish from which old and tired hearts\nrarely recover.  She was more frightened for him than for Val,\nand the grief she felt for him was a grief outside herself, which\ncould be pitied and comforted, whereas the blow that had fallen\non Val seemed to have fallen on her own life also, withering\nwhere it struck.  She suffered for her father but with Val, and\nthis intensity of communion hardened her into steel, for it\nseemed as weak and vain to pity him as it would have been to pity\nherself if she like him had fallen under the stress of war.  The\nweak must first be served--later, later there would be time to\npity the strong.\n\nShe did not realize that for Val, whom instinctively she still\nclassed among the strong, time and opportunity were over.  He\nfainted before they got him out into the air, and his hand fell\naway from his side, and then they saw what was wrong.  He had\nbeen stabbed: stabbed with the Persian dagger that Lawrence\nhimself had given Bernard.  Val had taken it under his left\nbreast, and it was buried to its delicate hilt.  When Lawrence\nopened his coat and shirt there was scarcely any blood flowing:\nscarcely any sign of mischief except his leaden pallor and the\nall-but-cessation of his pulse.  \"Internal haemorrhage,\" said\nLawrence.  He drew out the weapon, which came forth with a slow\nsidelong wrench of its curved blade: a gush of blood followed,\nrunning down over Val's shirt, over his shabby coat, over the\nsteps of Wanhope and the dry autumn turf.  Lawrence held the lips\nof the wound together with his hand.  \"Go and find Verney, will\nyou?  Mind, it was an accident.  Don't be drawn into giving any\ndetails.  We must all stick to the same story.\"\n\n\"But--but\" Selincourt could not frame a coherent question with\nhis pale frightened lips: \"you don't--you can't think--\"\n\n\"That he's dying?  He won't see another sun rise.\"\n\n\"But do they--do they--in there--understand?\"\n\n\"Oh for them,\" said Lawrence with his bitter ironical smile, \"he\ndied five minutes ago.\"\n\nThis then was the end.  Waiting in the autumn twilight with Val's\nhead on his arm Lawrence tried to retrace the steps by which it\nhad been reached.  Bernard's revenge had struck blind and wild as\nrevenge is apt to strike, but it had helped to bring the wheel\nfull circle.  Val's expiation was complete.  In his heart\nLawrence knew that his own was complete also.  In breaking Val's\nlife he had permanently scarred his own.\n\nAnd the night when it had all begun came back to him, a March\nnight, quiet and dark but for the periodical fanbeam of an enemy\nsearchlight from the slope of an opposite hill: a mild rain had\nbeen falling, falling, ceaselessly, plashingly, over muddy\nploughland or sere grass, over the intricacy of trenchwork behind\nthe firing lines and the dreary expanse of no man's land between\nthem: falling over wire entanglements from which dangled rags of\nuniform and rags of flesh: falling on faces of the unburied dead\nthat it was helping to dissolve into, their primal pulp of clay.\nWar! always war! and no theatre of scarlet and gold and cavalry\ncharges, but a rat's war of mud and cold and fleas and unutterable,\nnerve-dissolving fatigue.  Not far off occasionally the rustle of\nclothes or the tinkle of an entrenching tool, as a sleeper turned\nover or the group sentry shifted arms on the parapet; and always in a\nlulling undertone the plash of rain on grass or wire, and the heavy\nbreathing of tired men.  For four years these nocturnal sounds of war\nhad been familiar in the ears of Lawrence Hyde.  He could hear them\nnow, the river-murmur repeated them.  And then as now he had taken\nyoung Stafford's head on his arm, the boy lying as he had lain for\neighteen hours, immovable, the rain running down over his face and\nthrough his short fair hair.\n\nHe had failed . . . Lawrence recalled his own first near glimpse\nof death, a fellow subaltern hideously killed at his side: he had\nturned faint as the nightmare shape fell and rose and fell again,\nspouting blood over his clothes: contact with elder men had\nsteadied him.  By night and alone?  Well: even by night and alone\nLawrence knew that he would have recovered himself and gone on.\nIt was no more than they all had to fight through, thousands of\nofficers, millions of men.  Val had failed. . . . Yet how vast\nthe disproportion between the crime and the punishment!  Endurance\nis at a low ebb at nineteen when one's eyelids are dropping and one's\nhead nodding with fatigue.  Oh to sleep--sleep for twelve hours on a\nbed between clean sheets, and wake with a mind wiped clear of bloody\nmemories! . . . memories above all . . . incommunicable things that\neven years later, even to men who have shared them, cannot be\nrecalled except by a half-averted glance and a low \"Do you\nremember--?\" like frightened children holding hands in the dark of\nthe world. . . . Had any one of them kept sane that night--those\nmany nights? . . . But how should a civilian understand?\n\nHe felt Val's heart.  It was beating slower and slower.  If one\ncould only have one's life over again! but the gods themselves\ncannot recall their gifts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIt was one March evening six mouths later, one of those warm,\nstill, sunshot-and-grey March evenings when elm-root are blue\nwith violets and the air is full of the faint indeterminate scent\nof tree flowers, that Lawrence brought his bride home to\nFarringay.  March weather is uncertain, and he preferred to go\nwhere he could be sure of comfort, while Isabel, having once\nconsented to be married, left all arrangements to him.  It was\neight o'clock before they reached the house, and Isabel never\nforgot the impression which it made on her when she came in out\nof the bloomy twilight; warm and dim and smelling of violets that\nwere set about in bowls on bookcase and cabinet, while the flames\nof an immense wood fire on an open hearth flickered over the blue\nand rose of porcelain or the oakleaf and gold of morocco.  She\nstood in the middle of an ocean of polished floor and looked\nround her as if she had lost her way in it, till Lawrence came to\nher and kissed her hands.  \"Isabel, do you like the look of your\nnew home?\"\n\n\"Very much.  Thank you.\"\n\n\"May I take off your furs for you?\" Getting no answer he took\nthem off.  Framed in the sable cap and scarf that Yvonne had\ngiven her Isabel still parted her hair on one side, a fashion\nwhich Lawrence had grown to admire immensely, but her young\nthroat and the fine straight masque of her features were thin and\nshe had lost much of her colour since the autumn.  Lawrence held\nher by the wrists and stood looking down at her, compelling her\nto raise her eyes, though they soon fell again with a flutter of\nthe sensitive eyelids.  \"Are you tired, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"Oh no, thank you.\"\n\n\"Cold?\"\n\n\"Not now.\"\n\n\"Frightened?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't rather I left you for a little while?\"\n\nIsabel almost imperceptibly shook her head, but with a shade of\nmockery in her smile which prevented Lawrence from taking her in\nhis arms.  \"Am I an unsatisfactory wife?  Will you soon be tired\nof me?  No, not yet,\" she said, moving away from him to put down\nher gloves and muff.  \"I've hardly had time to thank you for my\npresents yet.  Oh Lawrence, how you spoil me!\"  She held up her\nwatch to admire the lettering on its Roman enamel.  \"'I.H.' Does\nthat stand for me--am I really Isabel Hyde?  And are those\nsapphires mine, and can I drink my tea out of this roseleaf\nDresden cup?  It does seem strange that saying a few words and\nwriting one's name in a book should make so much difference.\"\n\n\"Regretful?\"\n\n\"A little oppressed, that's all.  I shall soon get used to it.\nIf you were not you I should hate it.  But there's something\nessentially generous and careless in you, Lawrence, that makes it\neasy to take from you.  Come here.\" He came to her.  \"Oh, I've\nmade you blush!\" said Isabel, naively surprised.  Under her rare\nand unexpected praise he had coloured against his will.  \"Oh\nfoolish one!\"  She kissed him sweetly.  \"Lawrence, are you sorry\nVal died?\"  Lawrence freed himself and turned away.  It was six\nmonths since Val's death, but he still could not bear to think of\nit and he had scarcely spoken of it to Isabel.\n\nThere had been no protracted farewell for Val.  He had died in\nLawrence's arms on the steps of Wanhope without recovering\nconsciousness, while Verney stood by helpless, and Isabel, by a\nstroke of irony, tried to convince poor agonized Laura Clowes\nthat the law should not touch her husband.  It had not done so.\nHe had been saved mainly by the unscrupulous concerted perjury of\nLawrence and Selincourt, who swore that Val had stumbled and\nfallen by accident with the dagger in his hand, while Verney\nconfined himself to drily agreeing that the wound might have been\nself-inflicted. In the absence of any contrary evidence the lie\nwas allowed to pass, but perhaps it would hardly have done so if\nit had not been universally taken for a half-truth.  The day\nbefore the inquest there appeared in the Gazette a laconic notice\nthat Second Lieutenant Valentine Ormsby Stafford, late of the\nDorchester Regiment, had been deprived of his distinction on\naccount of circumstances recently brought to light.  After that,\nno need to ask why Val should have had a dagger in his hand!  A\njury who had known Val and his father before him were not anxious\nto press the case; and perhaps even the coroner was secretly\ngrateful for evidence which spared him the pain of calling Mr.\nStafford.\n\nExcept in Chilmark, the scandal scarcely ran its nine days, but\nthere of course it raged like a fire, and no one was much\nsurprised when the vicar resigned his living and crept away to a\nbed-sittingroom in Museum Street, a broken old man, to spend the\nbrief remainder of his life among black letter texts and\nincunabula.  He could have borne any sin in the Decalogue less\nhardly than a breach of the military oath.  He stopped Isabel,\nRowsley, Lawrence himself when they tried to plead for Val. \"I\nam not angry,\" he said feebly.  \"If my son were alive I wouldn't\nshut my door on him.  But it's better as it is.\" He even tried to\npersuade Isabel to break with Lawrence.  \"Captain Hyde is an\nhonourable man and no doubt considers himself bound to you, so\nyou mustn't wait for him to release himself.  It is very sad for\nyou, my dear, but you belong to a disgraced family now and you\nmust suffer with the rest of us.\"  Isabel agreed, and returned\nher engagement ring.  Followed a rather fiery scene, in which\nLawrence lost his temper, and Isabel wept: and finally Mr.\nStafford, finding Lawrence obdurate, broke down and owned that\nhis one last wish was to see his daughter happily married.  He\nrefused to take her to Bloomsbury.  She stayed with Rowsley or at\nthe Castle till Lawrence brought her to Farringay.\n\nSo there were changes at Chilmark, for the parish went to a\nhot-tempered Welshman with a wife and six children, and Wanhope was\nlet to an American steel magnate, and Mrs. Jack Bendish, always\nmischievous when she was unhappy, embroiled them with each other\nfirst and then quarrelled with both.  Yes, Wanhope was let: a\nfortnight after Val's death Major Clowes went by car to Cornwall\nwith his wife for a change of air after the shock. He was\nreported to have stood the journey very well, but Laura's letters\nwere not expansive.\n\nNor was Isabel: nor any other of those who had been eyewitnesses\nof the tragedy at Wanhope.  The memory of it cast a shadow and a\nsilence.  Lawrence had never discussed it with Isabel; nor with\nSelincourt, except in a hurried whispered interchange of notes to\navoid discrepancy in their evidence; nor with Bernard . . . the\nmurderer.  Since the night when he carried Val dead over the\nvicarage threshold Lawrence had not seen his cousin.  He had seen\nLaura and tried to comfort her, but what could one say?  It was\nmurder.  Had it not been for Laura he would have left Clowes to\nstand his trial.  Even for her sake he would not have kept the\nsecret if Rowsley, to whom alone it was revealed, had not given\nhis leave, in the dim blinded room where revenge and anger seemed\nsmall things, and Val's last words, almost unremarked at the\ntime, took on the solemn force of a dying injunction.  The grey\nplacidity of Val's closed eyelids and crossed hands was the last\nmemory that Lawrence would have chosen to evoke on his wedding\nnight.\n\n\"Come and get warm,\" said Isabel.  She saw that she had startled\nand distressed her husband, and she drew him down into an immense\narmchair by the fire, a man's chair, spacious and soft.  \"Is\nthere room for me too?\"  She slipped into it beside him and threw\nher arms round his neck.  Lawrence held her lightly and\npassively. Not once during their engagement had she so\nsurrendered herself to him for more than a moment, and he dared\nnot take advantage of his opportunities for fear of losing her\nagain.  But Isabel smiled at him with shut eyes.  \"All my heart,\"\nshe murmured; \"don't be afraid, I'm not going to slip through\nyour fingers now . . . I love you too, too much . . . Val would\nsay it was wrong to care so much for any one.\"\n\nVal again!  Lawrence lifted her eyelashes with his finger.\n\"Isabel, why are you haunted by Val now?  I don't want you to\nthink of any one but me.\"\n\n\"Are you jealous of the dead?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" his voice rang out harsh with passion: \"with you in my\narms why should I be jealous of any one in heaven or earth?\"\n\n\"Val would say that was wrong too. . . . Lawrence, do you\nremember your first wedding night?\"\n\n\"Well enough.\"\n\n\"Was Lizzie beautiful?\"\n\n\"I thought so then. She was a tall, well-made piece: black hair,\nblue eyes, buxom and plenty of colour. I was shy of her because--\nit's a curious fact--she was my first experience of your sex:\nbut she was not shy with me, though I believe she too was--\ntechnically--innocent.  Even at the time I was conscious of\nsomething wanting--some grace, some reserve, some economy of\neffect.  She was of a coming-on disposition, very amorous and\ntowardly.\"\n\n\"Val would call that coarse.\"\n\n\"Probably.  Do you object?  You asked for it.\"\n\n\"Not a bit.  I don't mind your telling me any thing that's a\nfact.  Bad thoughts are different, but facts, good or bad, coarse\nor refined, are the stuff the world's made of, and why should we\nshut our eyes to them? I like to take life as it comes without\nexpurgation.  Lawrence, Lizzie never had any children, did she?\"\n\n\"By me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No, our married life didn't last long. I should have warned you,\nmy dear, if I had had any responsibilities of that description.\"\n\n\"So you would--I forgot that.\" Isabel lay silent a moment,\nnestling her closed eyelids against his throat.  \"Lawrence, my\ndarling, I don't want to hurt you; but tell me, did she have any\nchildren after she left you?\"\n\n\"Yes--one, a boy: Rendell's.\"\n\n\"What became of him after Rendell died?\"\n\n\"When it became impossible to leave him with Lizzie I sent him to\nschool.  He spends his holidays with my agent here at Farringay.\nHe's quite a nice little chap, and good looking, like Arther, and\nby the gossip of the neighbourhood I'm supposed to be his father.\nDo you mind leaving it at that?  It's no worse for him and less\nignominious for me.\"\n\n\"Nothing in what I've heard of your married life is ignominious\nfor you.  So you brought up Rendell's child?  Essentially generous\n. . . . Kiss me.\"  Isabel's pale beauty glowed like a flame.  A\nChristian malagre lui and very much ashamed of it, Lawrence gave\nher the lightest of butterfly kisses, one on either eyelid.  \"Oh,\nI suppose you'll say I am--what was it?--towardly too,\"\nmurmured Isabel.  \"Don't you want to kiss me?\" He shook his head.\nIsabel, a trifle startled, opened her eyes, but was apparently\nsatisfied, for she shut them again hurriedly and let her arm fall\nacross them.  \"We'll go and see Rendell's boy tomorrow.  You\nshall take me. I can say what I like to you now, can't I? . . .\nShall you like to have one of our own?\"\n\n\"Isabel, Isabel!\"\n\n\"But it's perfectly proper now we're married!  Oh Lawrence, it'll\nso soon come to seem commonplace--  I want to taste the\nstrangeness of it while I'm still near enough to Isabel Stafford\nto realize what a miracle it'll be.  Our own! it seems so strange\nto say 'ours.'\"\n\n\"I don't want any brats to come between you and me.\"\n\n\"Aren't you always in your secret soul afraid of life?\"\n\n\"Afraid of life--I?\"\n\n\"You have no faith . . . Everything we possess--your happiness,\nour love, the children you'll give me--don't you hold it all at\nthe sword's point?  You're afraid of death or change?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How frank you are!\" Isabel smiled fleetingly. \"Aren't there any\nlocked doors?--no?--I may go wherever I like ?--Lawrence, are\nyou sorry Val's dead?\"\n\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake, not Val again!\"\n\n\"One locked door after all?\"\n\n\"I was fond of him,\" said Lawrence with difficult passion.  \"He\ntold me once that I broke his life, it was no one's doing but\nmine that he had to go through the crucifixion of that last hour\nat Wanhope, and he was killed for me.\" He left her and went to\nthe window, flung it up and stood looking out into the night.\n\"I'd have given my life to save him.  I'd give it now--now.\"\n\n\"I heard from Laura this morning.\"\n\n\"I wonder she dared write to you.\"\n\n\"Major Clowes is wonderfully better.  He drives out with her\nevery day and mixes with other people in the sanatorium and makes\nfriends with them.  He's been sleeping better than he has ever\ndone since his accident.\"\n\n\"Good God!\"\n\n\"He has been having a new massage treatment, and there's just a\nfaint hope that some day he may be able to get about on\ncrutches.\"\n\nLawrence had an inclination to laugh.  \"That's enough,\" he said,\nshuddering.  \"I don't want to hear any more.\"\n\n\"She sent a message to you.\"\n\n\"Well, give it to me, then.\"\n\n\"'Don't let Lawrence suppose that Bernard has gone unpunished.'\"\n\n\"He should have stood his trial,\" said Lawrence thickly.  \"It was\nmurder.\"\n\nHe understood all that Laura's laconic message implied.  Bernard\nreformed was Bernard broken by remorse: if he had shot himself--\nwhich was what Lawrence had anticipated--he would have deserved\nless pity.  Yet Lawrence would have liked some swifter and less\nsubtle form of punishment.\n\nOut of doors in the garden an owl was hooting and the night air\nbreathed on him its perfume of lilac and violets.  How quiet it\nwas and how fragrant and dim! one could scarcely distinguish\nbetween the dewy glimmer of turf and the dark island-like\nthickets of guelder-rose and other flowering shrubs.  It was one\nof those late spring nights that are full of the promise of\nsummer; but for Val there were no summers to come.  His death had\nbeen as quiet as his life and without any struggle; his head on\nLawrence's arm, he had stretched himself out with a little sigh,\nand was gone.  Lawrence with his keen physical memory could still\nfeel that light burden leaning on him.  Isabel too had memories\nshe was afraid of, the watch ticking on the dead man's wrist was\none of them.  Many tears had been shed for Val, some very bitter\nones by Yvonne Bendish, but none by Lawrence or by Isabel.  It\nwas murder: a flash of devil's lightning, that withered where it\nstruck.\n\nIsabel turned in her chair to watch her husband.  He had brought\nher straight into the drawingroom without staying to remove his\nleathern driving coat, which set off his big frame and the\ndrilled flatness of his shoulders; everything he wore or used was\nexpensive and fashionable.  There came on her suddenly the\nimpression of being shut up alone with a stranger, a man of whom\nshe knew nothing except that in upbringing and outlook he was\nentirely different from her and her family.  The room seemed\nimmense and Hyde was at the other end of it.  Suddenly he turned\nand came striding back to Isabel.  Her instinct was to defend\nherself.  She checked it and kept still, her arms and hands\nthrown out motionless along the arms of the chair in which her\nslight figure was lying in perfect repose.  Lawrence tenderly\ntook her head between his finger-tips and kissed her mouth.\n\"Why did you raise a ghost you can't lay?\" he said.  \"My cousin\nkilled your brother.\" Isabel smiled at him without moving.  Her\neyes were mysteriously full of light.  Lawrence knelt down and\nthrew his arms round her waist and let his head fall against her\nbosom.  What strength there was in this immature personality\nneither yielded nor withdrawn!  Lawrence was entirely disarmed\nand subdued.  He uttered a deep sigh and gave up to Isabel with\nthe simplicity of a child the secret of his tormented restlessness.\n\"I am unhappy, Isabel.\"\n\n\"I know you are, my darling, and that's why I raised the ghost.\nWhat is it troubles you?\"\n\n\"My own guilt.  I never knew what remorse meant before, but your\nChristian ethics have mastered me this time. I had no right to\nextract that promise from Val.\"\n\n\"No.  Why did you?  It seems so motiveless.\"\n\n\"Because it amused me to get a man into my power.\" Isabel felt\nhim shuddering.  \"Is this what you call the sense of sin?  I used\nto hear it described as a theological fiction.  But it tears\none's heart out.  Bernard killed him: but who put the weapon into\nBernard's hand?\"\n\n\"Val did.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you.\"\n\n\"The original fault was Val's, and you and Major Clowes were\nentangled in the consequences of it. Let us two face the truth\nonce and for all!  Val can stand it--can't you, Val? . . . He\nbroke his military oath.  He deserved a sharp stinging punishment,\nand if you had reported him he would have had it; perhaps a worse one\nthan you exacted, except for that last awful hour at Wanhope, and for\nthat Major Clowes, not you, was responsible.  Oh, I won't say he\ndeserved precisely what he got! because judgment ought to be\ndispassionate, and in yours there was an element of cruelty for\ncruelty's sake; wasn't there?  You half enjoyed it and half shivered\nunder it . . .\"\n\n\"More than half enjoyed it,\" said Hyde under his breath.\n\n\"But I do not believe that was your only motive.  I think you\nwere sorry for Val.  Haven't I seen you watching him at Wanhope?\nwith such a strange half-unwilling pity, as if you hated yourself\nfor it.  Oh Lawrence, it's for that I love you!\"  Lawrence shook\nhis head. He had never been able to analyse the complex of\nfeelings that had determined his attitude to Val.  \"Well, in any\ncase it was not your fault only.  A coward is an irresistible\ntemptation to a bully.\"\n\n\"Do you call Val a coward?  Nervous collapses were not so\nuncommon as you may have gathered from the Daily Mail.\"\n\n\"Did Major Clowes describe the scene truthfully?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you ever break down like Val?\"\n\n\"I was older.\"\n\n\"There were plenty of boys of nineteen, officers and men.  Did\nyou ever know such another case so complete, so prolonged?\"\n\n\"I've commanded a firing party.\"\n\n\"For cowardice?\"\n\n\"For cowardice.\"\n\n\"A worse exhibition than Val's?\"\n\n\"Isabel, you are pitiless!\"\n\n\"Because Val deserves justice not mercy.  It's his due: he died\nto earn it.\"\n\nHyde was silent, not thoroughly understanding her.\n\n\"He wasn't a coward when he died,\" said Isabel with her sweet\nhalf melancholy smile.  \"He fought under a heavy handicap, and\nwon: he paid his debt, paid it to the last farthing; and now do\nyou grudge him his sleep?  'He hates him, that would upon the\nrack of this tough world stretch him out longer. . . .'\"  Her\nbeautiful voice dropped to a murmur which was almost lost in the\nrustling of flames on the hearth and the stir of wind among\nbudded branches in the garden.\n\nThe clock struck ten and Lawrence raised his head.  \"It's growing\nlate, Isabel.  Aren't you tired?\"\n\n\"A little. I got up at five to say good-bye to all the animals.\"\n\n\"All the--?\"\n\n\"My cocks and hens and Val's mare and Dodor and Zou-zou and\nRowsley's old rabbits.  They're at the Castle, don't you\nremember?  Jack Bendish offered to take charge of them when we\nturned out of the vicarage.\"\n\n\"I hope you put your pinafore on,\" said her husband.\n\nHe took her by the hands and raised her to her feet, and Isabel\nwith irreproachable docility began to collect her scattered\nbelongings, her sable scarf and mull and veil.  Lawrence\nforestalled her. \"Mayn't I even carry my own gloves?\" Isabel\npleaded.  \"No, you're so slow,\" said Lawrence laughing down at\nher. Isabel's cheeks flew their scarlet flag before the invading\nenemy.  \"Isabel,\" Lawrence murmured, \"are you shy of me?\"\n\n\"A little.  I'm only twenty,\" Isabel excused herself.\n\n\"And I'm not gentle. I shall brush the bloom off. . . . Yet I\nlove the bloom.\"\n\nHe went to close the window.  A breath of night wind shook\nthrough the bushes on the lawn and blew off a snow of petals\nthrough the soft air.  He was not a believer in the immortality\nof the soul, but tonight he would have given much to know that\nVal was near him, a spirit of smiling tenderness.  But no: the\nnight was empty of everything except moonlight and petals and the\nsighing of wind over diapered turf. Youth passes, and beauty, and\nbloom: it is of the essence of their sweetness that they cannot\nlast.  Yet, while they last, how sweet they are!\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NIGHTFALL***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 14489.txt or 14489.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/4\/4\/8\/14489\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":580,"split":"train"}
