{"ori_id":"3e87eee49ffe1cbcc871f2310489775ffcaccbb2","title":"The Kids Are All Right (film)","context":"The Kids Are All Right (film)\n Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married lesbian couple living in the Los Angeles area. Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor.\nThe younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea.\nWhile working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair.\nJules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle\u00e2\u0080\u0094which Nic has forbidden\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair. Nic is devastated, but Jules assures she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. Joni and Laser have overheard the arguments and are also upset at Jules. The household becomes tense and Jules is forced to sleep on the couch. Paul thinks he has fallen in love with Jules and suggests she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him. Jules declines, disgusted with Paul's lack of understanding about their relationship. The children are angry at the both of them.\nThe night before Joni leaves home to go to college, Paul turns up at the house. Nic angrily confronts him, calling him an interloper, and tells him that if he wants a family, he should make one of his own. Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser ignores him. Later that night, Jules tearfully admits her errors to her family and begs their forgiveness. The next morning, the family takes Joni off to college. While Nic and Jules together hug Joni to say goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other. During the ride home, Laser tells his mothers that they should not break up because they are too old. Jules and Nic giggle, and the film ends with them smiling at each other and holding hands.\n<html>\n<head><title>Kids Are All Right, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Kids Are All Right, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Kids Are All Right, The script, Kids Are All Right, The movie script, Kids Are All Right, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

She\n      goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts\n      making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out\n      toward the hallway.\n\n      Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out.    She realizes\n      her family isn't there.\n\n<b>      EXT.

She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she\n      makes her way down a hill toward the road.\n      Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her.\n\n      The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out.   Joni\n      looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.\n<b>                          JONI\n<\/b>                Where'd you go?!\n\n<b>                          NIC\n<\/b>                We had to move the car.\n\n<b>                          JONI\n<\/b>                I thought you left.\n<b>                          JULES\n<\/b>                We wouldn't leave without saying\n                goodbye.\n\n<b>                          NIC\n<\/b>                Give us some credit.\n\n      And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to\n      say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.\n<b>                          LASER\n<\/b>                It's gonna be weird not having you\n                at home.\n\n<b>                          JONI\n<\/b>                Sorry to leave you alone with them.\n\n<b>                             LASER\n<\/b>                It's okay.     I can handle it.\n      Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,\n      tears streaming down their faces.\n<b>                                                               97.\n<\/b>\n<b>                           JONI\n<\/b>                Guys, come on...\n                    (beat)\n                Look, I'll talk to you soon.\n\n      Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let\n      go. They keep holding her and crying.\n\n      Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.\n\n      Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,\n      unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.\n\n      The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.\n\n      Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,\n      resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.\n\n      Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.   They hold her\n      tight to comfort her.\n      They keep holding her until a calm sets in.\n\n      The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.\n      Joni gives her moms one last smile.\n      Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands\n      watching as they drive off and her new life begins.\n\n\n<b>      INT.

Nic's in the\n      passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.\n\n      No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.   Finally\n      Laser breaks the spell.\n\n<b>                          LASER\n<\/b>                I don't think you guys should break\n                up.\n      A long beat.\n\n<b>                           NIC\n<\/b>                No?

But then his words have an unexpected gravity.\n<b>                                                            98.\n<\/b>\n<b>                     NIC\n<\/b>           Thanks, Laser.\n\nJules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts\nher hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and\ndoesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.\n\nNic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and\nJules look at each other, and then away.\n\nLaser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.\nTheir small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,\ngrateful for a sign.\n\n<b>FADE OUT\n<\/b><b>THE END\n<\/b><\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Kids-Are-All-Right,-The.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Kids Are All Right, The<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Lisa Cholodenko\" title=\"Scripts by Lisa Cholodenko\">Lisa Cholodenko<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Stuart Blumberg\" title=\"Scripts by Stuart Blumberg\">Stuart Blumberg<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Kids Are All Right, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Kids Are All Right, The comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":266,"split":"train"}
