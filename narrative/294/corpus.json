Born in 1913, he emigrated from New Zealand when he was a young man and was instrumental in building the new republic as one of a group of similar-minded men which included his best friend John Neverbend, ten years his junior, who is now serving his term as President of Britannula. Whereas decades ago Crasweller also voted in favour of the law which introduced the \"Fixed Period,\" he gradually becomes more pensive as the day of his deposition is approaching. Neverbend has long been planning that day and envisaging it as a day of triumph, believing that mankind and civilisation will move an enormous step forward towards perfection. As the originator of the idea, Neverbend also hopes that his name will go down in the annals of history as one of the great reformers. He considers it unfortunate that his friend Crasweller, as the first one to go, does not show any of the signs of old age for which \"the Law\" was made in the first place: Crasweller is healthy and vigorous, his mental abilities have not started to deteriorate in any way, and accordingly he is more than capable of managing his own affairs and of earning his living.\nWhen all of a sudden Crasweller starts lying about his age and claiming that he was in fact born a year later, Neverbend realises that measures must be taken to ensure the smooth execution of the Law. However, he soon finds out that it has dawned on other elderly citizens as well what the state has in store for them, and that various individuals have come up with all kinds of excuses and plans as to how they are going to oppose their deposition and, eventually, departure. He finds a supporter in Abraham Grundle, one of the young Senators, but is shocked when he realises that Grundle, who is engaged to Crasweller's daughter Eva, only wants to inherit his friend's fortune as soon as possible. But despite this setback, and although both his own son Jack and his wife Sarah turn against him, Neverbend, who has long since passed the point of no return, considers it his duty as President and law-abiding citizen to have Crasweller deposited.\nAs a man of honour, Crasweller finally yields to Neverbend's arguments and stoically accepts his fate. However, on the very day of his deposition the carriage that is to transport the two men to the College is held up in the streets of Gladstonopolis by British armed forces. They have arrived on a warship of enormous dimensions and, by threatening to destroy the whole city with their \"250-lb swivel gun,\" compel Neverbend to release Crasweller and eventually to step down as President. Britannula is re-annexed by Great Britain, a Governor is installed, and John Neverbend is forced to return to England with them.\nDuring the passage Neverbend commits to paper the recent history of Britannula, finishing it only two days before his arrival in England. He plans to write another, more theoretical book on the \"Fixed Period\" and to preach to the English about this necessary step in the progress of mankind. However, he realises that he does not really know whether he will be treated with respect in the old country or not, or whether he will ever be able to return to Britannula.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Fixed Period, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

But it had its period of separation from the mother\ncountry, though never of rebellion,--like its elder sister New\nZealand. Indeed, in that respect it simply followed the lead given\nher by the Australias, which, when they set up for themselves, did so\nwith the full co-operation of England. There was, no doubt, a special\ncause with us which did not exist in Australia, and which was only,\nin part, understood by the British Government when we Britannulists\nwere allowed to stand by ourselves. The great doctrine of a \"Fixed\nPeriod\" was received by them at first with ridicule, and then\nwith dismay; but it was undoubtedly the strong faith which we of\nBritannula had in that doctrine which induced our separation. Nothing\ncould have been more successful than our efforts to live alone during\nthe thirty years that we remained our own masters. We repudiated no\ndebt,--as have done some of our neighbours; and no attempts have\nbeen made towards communism,--as has been the case with others.\nWe have been laborious, contented, and prosperous; and if we have\nbeen reabsorbed by the mother country, in accordance with what I\ncannot but call the pusillanimous conduct of certain of our elder\nBritannulists, it has not been from any failure on the part of the\nisland, but from the opposition with which the Fixed Period has been\nregarded.\n\nI think I must begin my story by explaining in moderate language a\nfew of the manifest advantages which would attend the adoption of the\nFixed Period in all countries. As far as the law went it was adopted\nin Britannula. Its adoption was the first thing discussed by our\nyoung Assembly, when we found ourselves alone; and though there were\ndisputes on the subject, in none of them was opposition made to the\nsystem. I myself, at the age of thirty, had been elected Speaker of\nthat Parliament. But I was, nevertheless, able to discuss the merits\nof the bills in committee, and I did so with some enthusiasm. Thirty\nyears have passed since, and my \"period\" is drawing nigh. But I am\nstill as energetic as ever, and as assured that the doctrine will\nultimately prevail over the face of the civilised world, though I\nwill acknowledge that men are not as yet ripe for it.\n\nThe Fixed Period has been so far discussed as to make it almost\nunnecessary for me to explain its tenets, though its advantages may\nrequire a few words of argument in a world that is at present dead to\nits charms. It consists altogether of the abolition of the miseries,\nweakness, and _fain\u00c3\u00a9ant_ imbecility of old age, by the prearranged\nceasing to live of those who would otherwise become old. Need I\nexplain to the inhabitants of England, for whom I chiefly write, how\nextreme are those sufferings, and how great the costliness of that\nold age which is unable in any degree to supply its own wants? Such\nold age should not, we Britannulists maintain, be allowed to be. This\nshould be prevented, in the interests both of the young and of those\nwho do become old when obliged to linger on after their \"period\" of\nwork is over. Two mistakes have been made by mankind in reference to\ntheir own race,--first, in allowing the world to be burdened with the\ncontinued maintenance of those whose cares should have been made to\ncease, and whose troubles should be at an end. Does not the Psalmist\nsay the same?--\"If by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet\nis their strength labour and sorrow.\" And the second, in requiring\nthose who remain to live a useless and painful life. Both these\nerrors have come from an ill-judged and a thoughtless tenderness,--a\ntenderness to the young in not calling upon them to provide for\nthe decent and comfortable departure of their progenitors; and a\ntenderness to the old lest the man, when uninstructed and unconscious\nof good and evil, should be unwilling to leave the world for which\nhe is not fitted. But such tenderness is no better than unpardonable\nweakness. Statistics have told us that the sufficient sustenance of\nan old man is more costly than the feeding of a young one,--as is\nalso the care, nourishment, and education of the as yet unprofitable\nchild. Statistics also have told us that the unprofitable young and\nthe no less unprofitable old form a third of the population. Let the\nreader think of the burden with which the labour of the world is thus\nsaddled. To these are to be added all who, because of illness cannot\nwork, and because of idleness will not. How are a people to thrive\nwhen so weighted? And for what good? As for the children, they are\nclearly necessary. They have to be nourished in order that they may\ndo good work as their time shall come. But for whose good are the old\nand effete to be maintained amid all these troubles and miseries? Had\nthere been any one in our Parliament capable of showing that they\ncould reasonably desire it, the bill would not have been passed.\nThough to me the politico-economical view of the subject was always\nvery strong, the relief to be brought to the aged was the one\nargument to which no reply could be given.\n\nIt was put forward by some who opposed the movement, that the old\nthemselves would not like it. I never felt sure of that, nor do I\nnow. When the colony had become used to the Fixed Period system,\nthe old would become accustomed as well as the young. It is to be\nunderstood that a euthanasia was to be prepared for them;--and how\nmany, as men now are, does a euthanasia await? And they would depart\nwith the full respect of all their fellow-citizens. To how many does\nthat lot now fall? During the last years of their lives they were to\nbe saved from any of the horrors of poverty. How many now lack the\ncomforts they cannot earn for themselves? And to them there would be\nno degraded feeling that they were the recipients of charity. They\nwould be prepared for their departure, for the benefit of their\ncountry, surrounded by all the comforts to which, at their time of\nlife, they would be susceptible, in a college maintained at the\npublic expense; and each, as he drew nearer to the happy day, would\nbe treated with still increasing honour. I myself had gone most\nclosely into the question of expense, and had found that by the use\nof machinery the college could almost be made self-supporting. But\nwe should save on an average \u00c2\u00a350 for each man and woman who had\ndeparted. When our population should have become a million, presuming\nthat one only in fifty would have reached the desired age, the sum\nactually saved to the colony would amount to \u00c2\u00a31,000,000 a-year. It\nwould keep us out of debt, make for us our railways, render all our\nrivers navigable, construct our bridges, and leave us shortly the\nrichest people on God's earth! And this would be effected by a\nmeasure doing more good to the aged than to any other class of the\ncommunity!\n\nMany arguments were used against us, but were vain and futile in\ntheir conception. In it religion was brought to bear; and in talking\nof this the terrible word \"murder\" was brought into common use. I\nremember startling the House by forbidding any member to use a phrase\nso revolting to the majesty of the people. Murder! Did any one who\nattempted to deter us by the use of foul language, bethink himself\nthat murder, to be murder, must be opposed to the law? This thing was\nto be done by the law. There can be no other murder. If a murderer\nbe hanged,--in England, I mean, for in Britannula we have no capital\npunishment,--is that murder? It is not so, only because the law\nenacts it. I and a few others did succeed at last in stopping the use\nof that word. Then they talked to us of Methuselah, and endeavoured\nto draw an argument from the age of the patriarchs. I asked them in\ncommittee whether they were prepared to prove that the 969 years, as\nspoken of in Genesis, were the same measure of time as 969 years now,\nand told them that if the sanitary arrangements of the world would\nagain permit men to live as long as the patriarchs, we would gladly\nchange the Fixed Period.\n\nIn fact, there was not a word to be said against us except that\nwhich referred to the feelings of the young and old. Feelings are\nchangeable, I told them at that great and glorious meeting which\nwe had at Gladstonopolis, and though naturally governed only by\ninstinct, would be taught at last to comply with reason. I had lately\nread how feelings had been allowed in England to stand in the way of\nthe great work of cremation. A son will not like, you say, to lead\nhis father into the college. But ought he not to like to do so? and\nif so, will not reason teach him to like to do what he ought? I can\nconceive with rapture the pride, the honour, the affection with\nwhich, when the Fixed Period had come, I could have led my father\ninto the college, there to enjoy for twelve months that preparation\nfor euthanasia which no cares for this world would be allowed to\ndisturb. All the existing ideas of the grave would be absent. There\nwould be no further struggles to prolong the time of misery which\nnature had herself produced. That temptation to the young to begrudge\nto the old the costly comforts which they could not earn would be no\nlonger fostered. It would be a pride for the young man to feel that\nhis parent's name had been enrolled to all coming time in the bright\nbooks of the college which was to be established for the Fixed\nPeriod. I have a son of my own, and I have carefully educated him to\nlook forward to the day in which he shall deposit me there as the\nproudest of his life. Circumstances, as I shall relate in this story,\nhave somewhat interfered with him; but he will, I trust, yet come\nback to the right way of thinking. That I shall never spend that last\nhappy year within the walls of the college, is to me, from a selfish\npoint of view, the saddest part of England's reassuming our island as\na colony.\n\nMy readers will perceive that I am an enthusiast. But there are\nreforms so great that a man cannot but be enthusiastic when he has\nreceived into his very soul the truth of any human improvement. Alas\nme! I shall never live to see carried out the glory of this measure\nto which I have devoted the best years of my existence. The college,\nwhich has been built under my auspices as a preparation for the happy\ndeparture, is to be made a Chamber of Commerce. Those aged men who\nwere awaiting, as I verily believe, in impatience the coming day of\ntheir perfected dignity, have been turned loose in the world, and\nallowed to grovel again with mundane thoughts amidst the idleness of\nyears that are useless. Our bridges, our railways, our Government are\nnot provided for. Our young men are again becoming torpid beneath\nthe weight imposed upon them. I was, in truth, wrong to think that\nso great a reform could be brought to perfection within the days of\nthe first reformers. A divine idea has to be made common to men's\nminds by frequent ventilation before it will be seen to be fit\nfor humanity. Did not the first Christians all suffer affliction,\npoverty, and martyrdom? How many centuries has it taken in the\nhistory of the world to induce it to denounce the not yet abolished\ntheory of slavery? A throne, a lord, and a bishop still remain to\nencumber the earth! What right had I, then, as the first of the\nFixed-Periodists, to hope that I might live to see my scheme carried\nout, or that I might be allowed to depart as among the first glorious\nrecipients of its advantages?\n\nIt would appear absurd to say that had there been such a law in\nforce in England, England would not have prevented its adoption in\nBritannula. That is a matter of course. But it has been because the\nold men are still alive in England that the young in Britannula are\nto be afflicted,--the young and the old as well. The Prime Minister\nin Downing Street was seventy-two when we were debarred from carrying\nout our project, and the Secretary for the Colonies was sixty-nine.\nHad they been among us, and had we been allowed to use our wisdom\nwithout interference from effete old age, where would they have been?\nI wish to speak with all respect of Sir William Gladstone. When we\nnamed our metropolis after him, we were aware of his good qualities.\nHe has not the eloquence of his great-grandfather, but he is, they\ntell us, a safe man. As to the Minister for the Crown Colonies,--of\nwhich, alas! Britannula has again become one,--I do not, I own, look\nupon him as a great statesman. The present Duke of Hatfield has none\nof the dash, if he has more than the prudence, of his grandfather.\nHe was elected to the present Upper Chamber as a strong anti-Church\nLiberal, but he never has had the spirit to be a true reformer. It is\nnow due to the \"feelings\" which fill no doubt the bosoms of these two\nanti-Fixed-Period seniors, that the doctrine of the Fixed Period has\nfor a time been quenched in Britannula. It is sad to think that the\nstrength and intellect and spirit of manhood should thus be conquered\nby that very imbecility which it is their desire to banish from the\nworld.\n\nTwo years since I had become the President of that which we gloried\nto call the rising Empire of the South Pacific. And in spite of all\ninternal opposition, the college of the Fixed Period was already\ncompleted. I then received violent notice from the British Government\nthat Britannula had ceased to be independent, and had again been\nabsorbed by the mother country among the Crown Colonies. How that\ninformation was received, and with what weakness on the part of the\nBritannulists, I now proceed to tell.\n\nI confess that I for one was not at first prepared to obey. We were\nsmall, but we were independent, and owed no more of submission to\nGreat Britain than we do to the Salomon Islands or to Otaheite.\nIt was for us to make our own laws, and we had hitherto made them\nin conformity with the institutions, and, I must say, with the\nprejudices of so-called civilisation. We had now made a first attempt\nat progress beyond these limits, and we were immediately stopped by\nthe fatuous darkness of the old men whom, had Great Britain known\nher own interest, she would already have silenced by a Fixed Period\nlaw on her own account. No greater instance of uncalled-for tyranny\nis told of in the history of the world as already written. But my\nbrother Britannulists did not agree with me that, in the interest of\nthe coming races, it was our duty rather to die at our posts than\nyield to the menaces of the Duke of Hatfield. One British gunboat,\nthey declared, in the harbour of Gladstonopolis, would reduce us--to\norder. What order? A 250-ton steam-swiveller could no doubt crush\nus, and bring our Fixed Period college in premature ruin about our\nears. But, as was said, the captain of the gunboat would never dare\nto touch the wire that should commit so wide a destruction. An\nEnglishman would hesitate to fire a shot that would send perhaps five\nthousand of his fellow-creatures to destruction before their Fixed\nPeriod. But even in Britannula fear still remains. It was decided, I\nwill confess by the common voice of the island, that we should admit\nthis Governor, and swear fealty again to the British Crown. Sir\nFerdinando Brown was allowed to land, and by the rejoicing made at\nthe first Government House ball, as I have already learned since I\nleft the island, it appeared that the Britannulists rejoiced rather\nthan otherwise at their thraldom.\n\nTwo months have passed since that time, and I, being a worn-out old\nman, and fitted only for the glory of the college, have nothing left\nme but to write this story, so that coming ages may see how noble\nwere our efforts. But in truth, the difficulties which lay in our\nway were very stern. The philosophical truth on which the system is\nfounded was too strong, too mighty, too divine, to be adopted by man\nin the immediate age of its first appearance. But it has appeared;\nand I perhaps should be contented and gratified, during the years\nwhich I am doomed to linger through impotent imbecility, to think\nthat I have been the first reformer of my time, though I shall be\ndoomed to perish without having enjoyed its fruits.\n\nI must now explain before I begin my story certain details of our\nplan, which created much schism among ourselves. In the first place,\nwhat should be the Fixed Period? When a party of us, three or four\nhundred in number, first emigrated from New Zealand to Britannula,\nwe were, almost all of us, young people. We would not consent to\nmeasures in regard to their public debt which the Houses in New\nZealand threatened to take; and as this island had been discovered,\nand a part of it cultivated, thither we determined to go. Our\nresolution was very popular, not only with certain parties in New\nZealand, but also in the mother country. Others followed us, and we\nsettled ourselves with great prosperity. But we were essentially\na young community. There were not above ten among us who had then\nreached any Fixed Period; and not above twenty others who could be\nsaid to be approaching it. There never could arrive a time or a\npeople when, or among whom, the system could be tried with so good a\nhope of success. It was so long before we had been allowed to stand\non our bottom, that the Fixed Period became a matter of common\nconversation in Britannula. There were many who looked forward to\nit as the creator of a new idea of wealth and comfort; and it was\nin those days that the calculation was made as to the rivers and\nrailways. I think that in England they thought that a few, and but\na few, among us were dreamers of a dream. Had they believed that\nthe Fixed Period would ever have become law, they would not have\npermitted us to be law-makers. I acknowledge that. But when we were\nonce independent, then again to reduce us to submission by a 250-ton\nsteam-swiveller was an act of gross tyranny.\n\nWhat should be the Fixed Period? That was the first question which\ndemanded an immediate answer. Years were named absurd in their\nintended leniency;--eighty and even eighty-five! Let us say a\nhundred, said I, aloud, turning upon them all the battery of my\nridicule. I suggested sixty; but the term was received with silence.\nI pointed out that the few old men now on the island might be\nexempted, and that even those above fifty-five might be allowed to\ndrag out their existences if they were weak enough to select for\nthemselves so degrading a position. This latter proposition was\naccepted at once, and the exempt showed no repugnance even when it\nwas proved to them that they would be left alone in the community and\nentitled to no honour, and never allowed even to enter the pleasant\ngardens of the college. I think now that sixty was too early an age,\nand that sixty-five, to which I gracefully yielded, is the proper\nFixed Period for the human race. Let any man look among his friends\nand see whether men of sixty-five are not in the way of those who are\nstill aspiring to rise in the world. A judge shall be deaf on the\nbench when younger men below him can hear with accuracy. His voice\nshall have descended to a poor treble, or his eyesight shall be dim\nand failing. At any rate, his limbs will have lost all that robust\nagility which is needed for the adequate performance of the work of\nthe world. It is self-evident that at sixty-five a man has done all\nthat he is fit to do. He should be troubled no longer with labour,\nand therefore should be troubled no longer with life. \"It is all\nvanity and vexation of spirit,\" such a one would say, if still brave,\nand still desirous of honour. \"Lead me into the college, and there\nlet me prepare myself for that brighter life which will require\nno mortal strength.\" My words did avail with many, and then they\ndemanded that seventy should be the Fixed Period.\n\nHow long we fought over this point need not now be told. But we\ndecided at last to divide the interval. Sixty-seven and a half was\nnamed by a majority of the Assembly as the Fixed Period. Surely the\ncolony was determined to grow in truth old before it could go into\nthe college. But then there came a further dispute. On which side\nof the Fixed Period should the year of grace be taken? Our debates\neven on this subject were long and animated. It was said that the\nseclusion within the college would be tantamount to penal departure,\nand that the old men should thus have the last lingering drops of\nbreath allowed them, without, in the world at large. It was at last\ndecided that men and women should be brought into the college at\nsixty-seven, and that before their sixty-eighth birthday they should\nhave departed. Then the bells were rung, and the whole community\nrejoiced, and banquets were eaten, and the young men and women called\neach other brother and sister, and it was felt that a great reform\nhad been inaugurated among us for the benefit of mankind at large.\n\nLittle was thought about it at home in England when the bill was\npassed. There was, I suppose, in the estimation of Englishmen, time\nenough to think about it. The idea was so strange to them that it\nwas considered impossible that we should carry it out. They heard of\nthe bill, no doubt; but I maintain that, as we had been allowed to\nseparate ourselves and stand alone, it was no more their concern than\nif it had been done in Arizona or Idaho, or any of those Western\nStates of America which have lately formed themselves into a new\nunion. It was from them, no doubt, that we chiefly expected that\nsympathy which, however, we did not receive. The world was clearly\nnot yet alive to the grand things in store for it. We received,\nindeed, a violent remonstrance from the old-fashioned Government at\nWashington; but in answer to that we stated that we were prepared\nto stand and fall by the new system--that we expected glory rather\nthan ignominy, and to be followed by mankind rather than repudiated.\nWe had a lengthened correspondence also with New Zealand and with\nAustralia; but England at first did not believe us; and when she was\ngiven to understand that we were in earnest, she brought to bear upon\nus the one argument that could have force, and sent to our harbour\nher 250-ton steam-swiveller. The 250-ton swiveller, no doubt, was\nunanswerable--unless we were prepared to die for our system. I was\nprepared, but I could not carry the people of my country with me.\n\nI have now given the necessary prelude to the story which I have to\ntell. I cannot but think that, in spite of the isolated manners of\nGreat Britain, readers in that country generally must have become\nacquainted with the views of the Fixed-Periodists. It cannot but\nbe that a scheme with such power to change,--and, I may say, to\nimprove,--the manners and habits of mankind, should be known in a\ncountry in which a portion of the inhabitants do, at any rate, read\nand write. They boast, indeed, that not a man or a woman in the\nBritish Islands is now ignorant of his letters; but I am informed\nthat the knowledge seldom approaches to any literary taste. It may be\nthat a portion of the masses should have been ignorant of what was\nbeing done within the empire of the South Pacific. I have therefore\nwritten this preliminary chapter to explain to them what was the\ncondition of Britannula in regard to the Fixed Period just twelve\nmonths before England had taken possession of us, and once more\nmade us her own. Sir Ferdinando Brown now rules us, I must say, not\nwith a rod of iron, but very much after his own good will. He makes\nus flowery speeches, and thinks that they will stand in lieu of\nindependence. He collects his revenue, and informs us that to be\ntaxed is the highest privilege of an ornate civilisation. He pointed\nto the gunboat in the bay when it came, and called it the divine\ndepository of beneficent power. For a time, no doubt, British\n\"tenderness\" will prevail. But I shall have wasted my thoughts, and\nin vain poured out my eloquence as to the Fixed Period, if, in the\ncourse of years, it does not again spring to the front, and prove\nitself to be necessary before man can accomplish all that he is\ndestined to achieve.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGABRIEL CRASWELLER.\n\n\nI will now begin my tale. It is above thirty years since I commenced\nmy agitation in Britannula. We were a small people, and had not\nthen been blessed by separation; but we were, I think, peculiarly\nintelligent. We were the very cream, as it were, that had been\nskimmed from the milk-pail of the people of a wider colony,\nthemselves gifted with more than ordinary intelligence. We were the\n_\u00c3\u00a9lite_ of the selected population of New Zealand. I think I may say\nthat no race so well informed ever before set itself down to form a\nnew nation. I am now nearly sixty years old,--very nearly fit for the\ncollege which, alas! will never be open for me,--and I was nearly\nthirty when I began to be in earnest as to the Fixed Period. At\nthat time my dearest friend and most trusted coadjutor was Gabriel\nCrasweller. He was ten years my senior then, and is now therefore\nfit for deposition in the college were the college there to receive\nhim. He was one of those who brought with them merino sheep into the\ncolony. At great labour and expense he exported from New Zealand a\nsmall flock of choice animals, with which he was successful from the\nfirst. He took possession of the lands of Little Christchurch, five\nor six miles from Gladstonopolis, and showed great judgment in the\nselection. A prettier spot, as it turned out, for the fattening of\nboth beef and mutton and for the growth of wool, it would have been\nimpossible to have found. Everything that human nature wants was\nthere at Little Christchurch. The streams which watered the land were\nbright and rapid, and always running. The grasses were peculiarly\nrich, and the old English fruit-trees, which we had brought with\nus from New Zealand, throve there with an exuberant fertility, of\nwhich the mother country, I am told, knows nothing. He had imported\npheasants' eggs, and salmon-spawn, and young deer, and black-cock\nand grouse, and those beautiful little Alderney cows no bigger than\ngood-sized dogs, which, when milked, give nothing but cream. All\nthese things throve with him uncommonly, so that it may be declared\nof him that his lines had fallen in pleasant places. But he had\nno son; and therefore in discussing with him, as I did daily, the\nquestion of the Fixed Period, I promised him that it should be my lot\nto deposit him in the sacred college when the day of his withdrawal\nshould have come. He had been married before we left New Zealand, and\nwas childless when he made for himself and his wife his homestead at\nLittle Christchurch. But there, after a few years, a daughter was\nborn to him, and I ought to have remembered, when I promised to him\nthat last act of friendship, that it might become the duty of that\nchild's husband to do for him with filial reverence the loving work\nwhich I had undertaken to perform.\n\nMany and most interesting were the conversations held between\nCrasweller and myself on the great subject which filled our hearts.\nHe undoubtedly was sympathetic, and took delight in expatiating on\nall those benefits that would come to the world from the race of\nmankind which knew nothing of the debility of old age. He saw the\nbeauty of the theory as well as did I myself, and would speak often\nof the weakness of that pretended tenderness which would fear to\ncommence a new operation in regard to the feelings of the men and\nwomen of the old world. \"Can any man love another better than I do\nyou?\" I would say to him with energy; \"and yet would I scruple for a\nmoment to deposit you in the college when the day had come? I should\nlead you in with that perfect reverence which it is impossible\nthat the young should feel for the old when they become feeble and\nincapable.\" I doubt now whether he relished these allusions to his\nown seclusion. He would run away from his own individual case, and\ngeneralise widely about some future time. And when the time for\nvoting came, he certainly did vote for seventy-five. But I took no\noffence at his vote. Gabriel Crasweller was almost my dearest friend,\nand as his girl grew up it was a matter of regret to me that my only\nson was not quite old enough to be her husband.\n\nEva Crasweller was, I think, the most perfect piece I ever beheld of\nyouthful feminine beauty. I have not yet seen those English beauties\nof which so much is said in their own romances, but whom the\nyoung men from New York and San Francisco who make their way to\nGladstonopolis do not seem to admire very much. Eva was perfect in\nsymmetry, in features, in complexion, and in simplicity of manners.\nAll languages are the same to her; but that accomplishment has become\nso common in Britannula that but little is thought of it. I do not\nknow whether she ravished our ears most with the old-fashioned piano\nand the nearly obsolete violin, or with the modern mousometor, or the\nmore perfect melpomeneon. It was wonderful to hear the way with which\nshe expressed herself at the meeting held about the rising buildings\nof the college when she was only sixteen. But I think she touched me\nmost with just a roly-poly pudding which she made with her own fair\nhands for our dinner one Sunday at Little Christchurch. And once when\nI saw her by chance take a kiss from her lover behind the door, I\nfelt that it was a pity indeed that a man should ever become old.\nPerhaps, however, in the eyes of some her brightest charm lay in the\nwealth which her father possessed. His sheep had greatly increased in\nnumber; the valleys were filled with his cattle; and he could always\nsell his salmon for half-a-crown a pound and his pheasants for\nseven-and-sixpence a brace. Everything had thriven with Crasweller,\nand everything must belong to Eva as soon as he should have been led\ninto the college. Eva's mother was now dead, and no other child had\nbeen born. Crasweller had also embarked his money largely in the wool\ntrade, and had become a sleeping-partner in the house of Grundle &\nGrabbe. He was an older man by ten years than either of his partners,\nbut yet Grundle's eldest son Abraham was older than Eva when\nCrasweller lent his money to the firm. It was soon known who was to\nbe the happiest man in the empire. It was young Abraham, by whom Eva\nwas kissed behind the door that Sunday when we ate the roly-poly\npudding. Then she came into the room, and, with her eyes raised to\nheaven, and with a halo of glory almost round her head as she poured\nforth her voice, she touched the mousometor, and gave us the Old\nHundredth psalm.\n\nShe was a fine girl at all points, and had been quite alive to the\ndawn of the Fixed Period system. But at this time, on the memorable\noccasion of the eating of that dinner, it first began to strike me\nthat my friend Crasweller was getting very near his Fixed Period, and\nit occurred to me to ask myself questions as to what might be the\ndaughter's wishes. It was the state of her feelings rather that would\npush itself into my mind. Quite lately he had said nothing about\nit,--nor had she. On that Sunday morning when he and his girl were\nat church,--for Crasweller had stuck to the old habit of saying his\nprayers in a special place on a special day,--I had discussed the\nmatter with young Grundle. Nobody had been into the college as yet.\nThree or four had died naturally, but Crasweller was about to be\nthe first. We were arranging that he should be attended by pleasant\nvisitors till within the last week or two, and I was making special\nallusion to the law which required that he should abandon all control\nof his property immediately on his entering the college. \"I suppose\nhe would do that,\" said Grundle, expressing considerable interest by\nthe tone of his voice.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said I; \"he must do that in accordance with the\nlaw. But he can make his will up to the very moment in which he is\ndeposited.\" He had then about twelve months to run. I suppose there\nwas not a man or woman in the community who was not accurately aware\nof the very day of Crasweller's birth. We had already introduced the\nhabit of tattooing on the backs of the babies the day on which they\nwere born; and we had succeeded in operating also on many of the\nchildren who had come into the world before the great law. Some there\nwere who would not submit on behalf of themselves or their children;\nand we did look forward to some little confusion in this matter. A\nregister had of course been commenced, and there were already those\nwho refused to state their exact ages; but I had been long on the\nlookout for this, and had a little book of my own in which were\ninscribed the \"periods\" of all those who had come to Britannula with\nus; and since I had first thought of the Fixed Period I had been very\ncareful to note faithfully the births as they occurred. The reader\nwill see how important, as time went on, it would become to have an\naccurate record, and I already then feared that there might be some\nwant of fidelity after I myself had been deposited. But my friend\nCrasweller was the first on the list, and there was no doubt in the\nempire as to the exact day on which he was born. All Britannula knew\nthat he would be the first, and that he was to be deposited on the\n13th of June 1980. In conversation with my friend I had frequently\nalluded to the very day,--to the happy day, as I used to call it\nbefore I became acquainted with his actual feelings,--and he never\nventured to deny that on that day he would become sixty-seven.\n\nI have attempted to describe his daughter Eva, and I must say a word\nas to the personal qualities of her father. He too was a remarkably\nhandsome man, and though his hair was beautifully white, had fewer of\nthe symptoms of age than any old man I had before known. He was tall,\nrobust, and broad, and there was no beginning even of a stoop about\nhim. He spoke always clearly and audibly, and he was known for the\nfirm voice with which he would perform occasionally at some of our\ndecimal readings. We had fixed our price at a decimal in order that\nthe sum so raised might be used for the ornamentation of the college.\nOur population at Gladstonopolis was so thriving that we found it\nas easy to collect ten pennies as one. At these readings Gabriel\nCrasweller was the favourite performer, and it had begun to be\nwhispered by some caitiffs who would willingly disarrange the whole\nstarry system for their own immediate gratification, that Crasweller\nshould not be deposited because of the beauty of his voice. And then\nthe difficulty was somewhat increased by the care and precision with\nwhich he attended to his own business. He was as careful as ever\nabout his flocks, and at shearing-time would stand all day in the\nwool-shed to see to the packing of his wool and the marking of his\nbales.\n\n\"It would be a pity,\" said to me a Britannulist one day,--a man\nyounger than myself,--\"to lock up old Crasweller, and let the\nbusiness go into the hands of young Grundle. Young Grundle will\nnever know half as much about sheep, in spite of his conceit; and\nCrasweller is a deal fitter for his work than for living idle in the\ncollege till you shall put an end to him.\"\n\nThere was much in these words which made me very angry. According to\nthis man's feelings, the whole system was to be made to suit itself\nto the peculiarities of one individual constitution. A man who so\nspoke could have known nothing of the general beauty of the Fixed\nPeriod. And he had alluded to the manner of depositing in most\ndisrespectful terms. I had felt it to be essentially necessary so to\nmaintain the dignity of the ceremony as to make it appear as unlike\nan execution as possible. And this depositing of Crasweller was to be\nthe first, and should--according to my own intentions--be attended\nwith a peculiar grace and reverence. \"I don't know what you call\nlocking up,\" said I, angrily. \"Had Mr Crasweller been about to be\ndragged to a felon's prison, you could not have used more opprobrious\nlanguage; and as to putting an end to him, you must, I think, be\nignorant of the method proposed for adding honour and glory to the\nlast moments in this world of those dear friends whose happy lot it\nwill be to be withdrawn from the world's troubles amidst the love\nand veneration of their fellow-subjects.\" As to the actual mode of\ntransition, there had been many discussions held by the executive in\nPresident Square, and it had at last been decided that certain veins\nshould be opened while the departing one should, under the influence\nof morphine, be gently entranced within a warm bath. I, as president\nof the empire, had agreed to use the lancet in the first two or three\ncases, thereby intending to increase the honours conferred. Under\nthese circumstances I did feel the sting bitterly when he spoke of my\nputting \"an end\" to him. \"But you have not,\" I said, \"at all realised\nthe feeling of the ceremony. A few ill-spoken words, such as these\nyou have just uttered, will do us more harm in the minds of many than\nall your voting will have done good.\" In answer to this he merely\nrepeated his observation that Crasweller was a very bad specimen to\nbegin with. \"He has got ten years of work in him,\" said my friend,\n\"and yet you intend to make away with him without the slightest\ncompunction.\"\n\nMake away with him! What an expression to use,--and this from the\nmouth of one who had been a determined Fixed-Periodist! It angered\nme to think that men should be so little reasonable as to draw\ndeductions as to an entire system from a single instance. Crasweller\nmight in truth be strong and hearty at the Fixed Period. But that\nperiod had been chosen with reference to the community at large; and\nwhat though he might have to depart a year or two before he was worn\nout, still he would do so with everything around him to make him\nhappy, and would depart before he had ever known the agony of a\nheadache. Looking at the entire question with the eyes of reason,\nI could not but tell myself that a better example of a triumphant\nbeginning to our system could not have been found. But yet there\nwas in it something unfortunate. Had our first hero been compelled\nto abandon his business by old age--had he become doting over its\ndetails--parsimonious, or extravagant, or even short-sighted in his\nspeculations--public feeling, than which nothing is more ignorant,\nwould have risen in favour of the Fixed Period. \"How true is the\npresident's reasoning,\" the people would have said. \"Look at\nCrasweller; he would have ruined Little Christchurch had he stayed\nthere much longer.\" But everything he did seemed to prosper; and\nit occurred to me at last that he forced himself into abnormal\nsprightliness, with a view of bringing disgrace upon the law of\nthe Fixed Period. If there were any such feeling, I regard it as\ncertainly mean.\n\nOn the day after the dinner at which Eva's pudding was eaten, Abraham\nGrundle came to me at the Executive Hall, and said that he had a few\nthings to discuss with me of importance. Abraham was a good-looking\nyoung man, with black hair and bright eyes, and a remarkably handsome\nmoustache; and he was one well inclined to business, in whose hands\nthe firm of Grundle, Grabbe, & Crasweller was likely to thrive; but\nI myself had never liked him much. I had thought him to be a little\nwanting in that reverence which he owed to his elders, and to be,\nmoreover, somewhat over-fond of money. It had leaked out that though\nhe was no doubt attached to Eva Crasweller, he had thought quite as\nmuch of Little Christchurch; and though he could kiss Eva behind\nthe door, after the ways of young men, still he was more intent\non the fleeces than on her lips. \"I want to say a word to you, Mr\nPresident,\" he began, \"upon a subject that disturbs my conscience\nvery much.\"\n\n\"Your conscience?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, Mr President. I believe you're aware that I am engaged to marry\nMiss Crasweller?\"\n\nIt may be as well to explain here that my own eldest son, as fine a\nboy as ever delighted a mother's eye, was only two years younger than\nEva, and that my wife, Mrs Neverbend, had of late got it into her\nhead that he was quite old enough to marry the girl. It was in vain\nthat I told her that all that had been settled while Jack was still\nat the didascalion. He had been Colonel of the Curriculum, as they\nnow call the head boy; but Eva had not then cared for Colonels of\nCurriculums, but had thought more of young Grundle's moustache. My\nwife declared that all that was altered,--that Jack was, in fact,\na much more manly fellow than Abraham with his shiny bit of beard;\nand that if one could get at a maiden's heart, we should find that\nEva thought so. In answer to this I bade her hold her tongue, and\nremember that in Britannula a promise was always held to be as good\nas a bond. \"I suppose a young woman may change her mind in Britannula\nas well as elsewhere,\" said my wife. I turned all this over in my\nmind, because the slopes of Little Christchurch are very alluring,\nand they would all belong to Eva so soon. And then it would be well,\nas I was about to perform for Crasweller so important a portion of\nhis final ceremony, our close intimacy should be drawn still nearer\nby a family connection. I did think of it; but then it occurred to\nme that the girl's engagement to young Grundle was an established\nfact, and it did not behove me to sanction the breach of a contract.\n\"Oh yes,\" said I to the young man, \"I am aware that there is an\nunderstanding to that effect between you and Eva's father.\"\n\n\"And between me and Eva, I can assure you.\"\n\nHaving observed the kiss behind the door on the previous day, I could\nnot deny the truth of this assertion.\n\n\"It is quite understood,\" continued Abraham, \"and I had always\nthought that it was to take place at once, so that Eva might get used\nto her new life before her papa was deposited.\"\n\nTo this I merely bowed my head, as though to signify that it was a\nmatter with which I was not personally concerned. \"I had taken it for\ngranted that my old friend would like to see his daughter settled,\nand Little Christchurch put into his daughter's hands before he\nshould bid adieu to his own sublunary affairs,\" I remarked, when I\nfound that he paused.\n\n\"We all thought so up at the warehouse,\" said he,--\"I and father,\nand Grabbe, and Postlecott, our chief clerk. Postlecott is the next\nbut three on the books, and is getting very melancholy. But he is\nespecially anxious just at present to see how Crasweller bears it.\"\n\n\"What has all that to do with Eva's marriage?\"\n\n\"I suppose I might marry her. But he hasn't made any will.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? There is nobody to interfere with Eva.\"\n\n\"But he might go off, Mr Neverbend,\" whispered Grundle; \"and where\nshould I be then? If he was to get across to Auckland, or to Sydney,\nand to leave some one to manage the property for him, what could\nyou do? That's what I want to know. The law says that he shall be\ndeposited on a certain day.\"\n\n\"He will become as nobody in the eye of the law,\" said I, with all\nthe authority of a President.\n\n\"But if he and his daughter have understood each other; and if some\ndeed be forthcoming by which Little Christchurch shall have been left\nto trustees; and if he goes on living at Sydney, let us say, on the\nfat of the land,--drawing all the income, and leaving the trustees as\nlegal owners,--where should I be then?\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said I, having taken two or three minutes for\nconsideration,--\"in that case, I presume the property would be\nconfiscated by law, and would go to his natural heir. Now if his\nnatural heir be then your wife, it will be just the same as though\nthe property were yours.\" Young Grundle shook his head. \"I don't know\nwhat more you would want. At any rate, there is no more for you to\nget.\" I confess that at that moment the idea of my boy's chance of\nsucceeding with the heiress did present itself to my mind. According\nto what my wife had said, Jack would have jumped at the girl with\njust what she stood up in; and had sworn to his mother, when he had\nbeen told that morning about the kiss behind the door, that he would\nknock that brute's head off his shoulders before many days were gone\nby. Looking at the matter merely on behalf of Jack, it appeared to\nme that Little Christchurch would, in that case, be quite safe, let\nCrasweller be deposited,--or run away to Sydney.\n\n\"You do not know for certain about the confiscation of the property,\"\nsaid Abraham.\n\n\"I've told you as much, Mr Grundle, as it is fit that you should\nknow,\" I replied, with severity. \"For the absolute condition of the\nlaw you must look in the statute-book, and not come to the President\nof the empire.\"\n\nAbraham Grundle then departed. I had assumed an angry air, as though\nI were offended with him, for troubling me on a matter by referring\nsimply to an individual. But he had in truth given rise to very\nserious and solemn thoughts. Could it be that Crasweller, my own\nconfidential friend--the man to whom I had trusted the very secrets\nof my soul on this important matter,--could it be that he should be\nunwilling to be deposited when the day had come? Could it be that\nhe should be anxious to fly from his country and her laws, just as\nthe time had arrived when those laws might operate upon him for the\nbenefit of that country? I could not think that he was so vain, so\ngreedy, so selfish, and so unpatriotic. But this was not all. Should\nhe attempt to fly, could we prevent his flying? And if he did fly,\nwhat step should we take next? The Government of New South Wales was\nhostile to us on the very matter of the Fixed Period, and certainly\nwould not surrender him in obedience to any law of extradition. And\nhe might leave his property to trustees who would manage it on his\nbehalf; although, as far as Britannula was concerned, he would be\nbeyond the reach of law, and regarded even as being without the pale\nof life. And if he, the first of the Fixed-Periodists, were to run\naway, the fashion of so running would become common. We should thus\nbe rid of our old men, and our object would be so far attained. But\nlooking forward, I could see at a glance that if one or two wealthy\nmembers of our community were thus to escape, it would be almost\nimpossible to carry out the law with reference to those who should\nhave no such means. But that which vexed me most was that Gabriel\nCrasweller should desire to escape,--that he should be anxious to\nthrow over the whole system to preserve the poor remnant of his life.\nIf he would do so, who could be expected to abstain? If he should\nprove false when the moment came, who would prove true? And he, the\nfirst, the very first on our list! Young Grundle had now left me,\nand as I sat thinking of it I was for a moment tempted to abandon\nthe Fixed Period altogether. But as I remained there in silent\nmeditation, better thoughts came to me. Had I dared to regard myself\nas the foremost spirit of my age, and should I thus be turned back\nby the human weakness of one poor creature who had not sufficiently\ncollected the strength of his heart to be able to look death in the\nface and to laugh him down. It was a difficulty--a difficulty the\nmore. It might be the crushing difficulty which would put an end to\nthe system as far as my existence was concerned. But I bethought\nme how many early reformers had perished in their efforts, and how\nseldom it had been given to the first man to scale the walls of\nprejudice, and force himself into the citadel of reason. But they had\nnot yielded when things had gone against them; and though they had\nnot brought their visions down to the palpable touch of humanity,\nstill they had persevered, and their efforts had not been altogether\nlost to the world.\n\n\"So it shall be with me,\" said I. \"Though I may never live to deposit\na human being within that sanctuary, and though I may be doomed by\nthe foolish prejudice of men to drag out a miserable existence amidst\nthe sorrows and weakness of old age; though it may never be given to\nme to feel the ineffable comforts of a triumphant deposition,--still\nmy name will be handed down to coming ages, and I shall be spoken of\nas the first who endeavoured to save grey hairs from being brought\nwith sorrow to the grave.\"\n\nI am now writing on board H.M. gunboat John Bright,--for the\ntyrannical slaves of a modern monarch have taken me in the flesh\nand are carrying me off to England, so that, as they say, all\nthat nonsense of a Fixed Period may die away in Britannula. They\nthink,--poor ignorant fighting men,--that such a theory can be made\nto perish because one individual shall have been mastered. But no!\nThe idea will still live, and in ages to come men will prosper and be\nstrong, and thrive, unpolluted by the greed and cowardice of second\nchildhood, because John Neverbend was at one time President of\nBritannula.\n\nIt occurred to me then, as I sat meditating over the tidings conveyed\nto me by Abraham Grundle, that it would be well that I should see\nCrasweller, and talk to him freely on the subject. It had sometimes\nbeen that by my strength I had reinvigorated his halting courage.\nThis suggestion that he might run away as the day of his deposition\ndrew nigh,--or rather, that others might run away,--had been the\nsubject of some conversation between him and me. \"How will it be,\" he\nhad said, \"if they mizzle?\" He had intended to allude to the possible\npremature departure of those who were about to be deposited.\n\n\"Men will never be so weak,\" I said.\n\n\"I suppose you'd take all their property?\"\n\n\"Every stick of it.\"\n\n\"But property is a thing which can be conveyed away.\"\n\n\"We should keep a sharp look-out upon themselves. There might be a\nwrit, you know, _ne exeant regno_. If we are driven to a pinch, that\nwill be the last thing to do. But I should be sorry to be driven to\nexpress my fear of human weakness by any general measure of that\nkind. It would be tantamount to an accusation of cowardice against\nthe whole empire.\"\n\nCrasweller had only shaken his head. But I had understood him to\nshake it on the part of the human race generally, and not on his own\nbehalf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE FIRST BREAK-DOWN.\n\n\nIt was now mid-winter, and it wanted just twelve months to that 30th\nof June on which, in accordance with all our plans, Crasweller was to\nbe deposited. A full year would, no doubt, suffice for him to arrange\nhis worldly affairs, and to see his daughter married; but it would\nnot more than suffice. He still went about his business with an\nalacrity marvellous in one who was so soon about to withdraw himself\nfrom the world. The fleeces for bearing which he was preparing his\nflocks, though they might be shorn by him, would never return their\nprices to his account. They would do so for his daughter and his\nson-in-law; but in these circumstances, it would have been well for\nhim to have left the flocks to his son-in-law, and to have turned\nhis mind to the consideration of other matters. \"There should be a\nyear devoted to that final year to be passed within the college, so\nthat, by degrees, the mind may be weaned from the ignoble art of\nmoney-making.\" I had once so spoken to him; but there he was, as\nintent as ever, with his mind fixed on the records of the price of\nwool as they came back to him from the English and American markets.\n\"It is all for his daughter,\" I had said to myself. \"Had he been\nblessed with a son, it would have been otherwise with him.\" So I\ngot on to my steam-tricycle, and in a few minutes I was at Little\nChristchurch. He was coming in after a hard day's work among the\nflocks, and seemed to be triumphant and careful at the same time.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Neverbend,\" said he; \"we shall have the fluke\nover here if we don't look after ourselves.\"\n\n\"Have you found symptoms of it?\"\n\n\"Well; not exactly among my own sheep; but I know the signs of it so\nwell. My grasses are peculiarly dry, and my flocks are remarkably\nwell looked after; but I can see indications of it. Only fancy where\nwe should all be if fluke showed itself in Britannula! If it once got\nahead we should be no better off than the Australians.\"\n\nThis might be anxiety for his daughter; but it looked strangely like\nthat personal feeling which would have been expected in him twenty\nyears ago. \"Crasweller,\" said I, \"do you mind coming into the house,\nand having a little chat?\" and so I got off my tricycle.\n\n\"I was going to be very busy,\" he said, showing an unwillingness. \"I\nhave fifty young foals in that meadow there; and I like to see that\nthey get their suppers served to them warm.\"\n\n\"Bother the young foals!\" said I. \"As if you had not men enough about\nthe place to see to feeding your stock without troubling yourself.\nI have come out from Gladstonopolis, because I want to see you;\nand now I am to be sent back in order that you might attend to the\nadministration of hot mashes! Come into the house.\" Then I entered\nin under the verandah, and he followed. \"You certainly have got the\nbest-furnished house in the empire,\" said I, as I threw myself on to\na double arm-chair, and lighted my cigar in the inner verandah.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he; \"it is pretty comfortable.\"\n\nHe was evidently melancholy, and knew the purpose for which I had\ncome. \"I don't suppose any girl in the old country was ever better\nprovided for than will be Eva.\" This I said wishing to comfort him,\nand at the same time to prepare for what was to be said.\n\n\"Eva is a good girl,--a dear girl. But I am not at all so sure about\nthat young fellow Abraham Grundle. It's a pity, President, your son\nhad not been born a few years sooner.\" At this moment my boy was half\na head taller than young Grundle, and a much better specimen of a\nBritannulist. \"But it is too late now, I suppose, to talk of that. It\nseems to me that Jack never even thinks of looking at Eva.\"\n\nThis was a view of the case which certainly was strange to me, and\nseemed to indicate that Crasweller was gradually becoming fit for\nthe college. If he could not see that Jack was madly in love with\nEva, he could see nothing at all. But I had not come out to Little\nChristchurch at the present moment to talk to him about the love\nmatters of the two children. I was intent on something of infinitely\ngreater importance. \"Crasweller,\" said I, \"you and I have always\nagreed to the letter on this great matter of the Fixed Period.\"\nHe looked into my face with supplicating, weak eyes, but he said\nnothing. \"Your period now will soon have been reached, and I think\nit well that we, as dear loving friends, should learn to discuss the\nmatter closely as it draws nearer. I do not think that it becomes\neither of us to be afraid of it.\"\n\n\"That's all very well for you,\" he replied. \"I am your senior.\"\n\n\"Ten years, I believe.\"\n\n\"About nine, I think.\"\n\nThis might have come from a mistake of his as to my exact age; and\nthough I was surprised at the error, I did not notice it on this\noccasion. \"You have no objection to the law as it stands now?\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"It might have been seventy.\"\n\n\"That has all been discussed fully, and you have given your assent.\nLook round on the men whom you can remember, and tell me, on how many\nof them life has not sat as a burden at seventy years of age?\"\n\n\"Men are so different,\" said he. \"As far as one can judge of his own\ncapacities, I was never better able to manage my business than I am\nat present. It is more than I can say for that young fellow Grundle,\nwho is so anxious to step into my shoes.\"\n\n\"My dear Crasweller,\" I rejoined, \"it was out of the question so to\narrange the law as to vary the term to suit the peculiarities of one\nman or another.\"\n\n\"But in a change of such terrible severity you should have suited the\neldest.\"\n\nThis was dreadful to me,--that he, the first to receive at the hands\nof his country the great honour intended for him,--that he should\nhave already allowed his mind to have rebelled against it! If he, who\nhad once been so keen a supporter of the Fixed Period, now turned\nround and opposed it, how could others who should follow be expected\nto yield themselves up in a fitting frame of mind? And then I\nspoke my thoughts freely to him. \"Are you afraid of departure?\" I\nsaid,--\"afraid of that which must come; afraid to meet as a friend\nthat which you must meet so soon as friend or enemy?\" I paused; but\nhe sat looking at me without reply. \"To fear departure;--must it not\nbe the greatest evil of all our life, if it be necessary? Can God\nhave brought us into the world, intending us so to leave it that the\nvery act of doing so shall be regarded by us as a curse so terrible\nas to neutralise all the blessings of our existence? Can it be that\nHe who created us should have intended that we should so regard our\ndismissal from the world? The teachers of religion have endeavoured\nto reconcile us to it, and have, in their vain zeal, endeavoured to\neffect it by picturing to our imaginations a hell-fire into which\nninety-nine must fall; while one shall be allowed to escape to a\nheaven, which is hardly made more alluring to us! Is that the way to\nmake a man comfortable at the prospect of leaving this world? But it\nis necessary to our dignity as men that we shall find the mode of\ndoing so. To lie quivering and quaking on my bed at the expectation\nof the Black Angel of Death, does not suit my manhood,--which would\nfear nothing;--which does not, and shall not, stand in awe of aught\nbut my own sins. How best shall we prepare ourselves for the day\nwhich we know cannot be avoided? That is the question which I have\never been asking myself,--which you and I have asked ourselves, and\nwhich I thought we had answered. Let us turn the inevitable into\nthat which shall in itself be esteemed a glory to us. Let us teach\nthe world so to look forward with longing eyes, and not with a faint\nheart. I had thought to have touched some few, not by the eloquence\nof my words, but by the energy of my thoughts; and you, oh my friend,\nhave ever been he whom it has been my greatest joy to have had with\nme as the sharer of my aspirations.\"\n\n\"But I am nine years older than you are.\"\n\nI again passed by the one year added to my age. There was nothing\nnow in so trifling an error. \"But you still agree with me as to the\nfundamental truth of our doctrine.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Crasweller.\n\n\"I suppose so!\" repeated I. \"Is that all that can be said for the\nphilosophy to which we have devoted ourselves, and in which nothing\nfalse can be found?\"\n\n\"It won't teach any one to think it better to live than to die while\nhe is fit to perform all the functions of life. It might be very well\nif you could arrange that a man should be deposited as soon as he\nbecomes absolutely infirm.\"\n\n\"Some men are infirm at forty.\"\n\n\"Then deposit them,\" said Crasweller.\n\n\"Yes; but they will not own that they are infirm. If a man be weak\nat that age, he thinks that with advancing years he will resume the\nstrength of his youth. There must, in fact, be a Fixed Period. We\nhave discussed that fifty times, and have always arrived at the same\nconclusion.\"\n\nHe sat still, silent, unhappy, and confused. I saw that there was\nsomething on his mind to which he hardly dared to give words. Wishing\nto encourage him, I went on. \"After all, you have a full twelve\nmonths yet before the day shall have come.\"\n\n\"Two years,\" he said, doggedly.\n\n\"Exactly; two years before your departure, but twelve months before\ndeposition.\"\n\n\"Two years before deposition,\" said Crasweller.\n\nAt this I own I was astonished. Nothing was better known in the\nempire than the ages of the two or three first inhabitants to be\ndeposited. I would have undertaken to declare that not a man or a\nwoman in Britannula was in doubt as to Mr Crasweller's exact age. It\nhad been written in the records, and upon the stones belonging to the\ncollege. There was no doubt that within twelve months of the present\ndate he was due to be detained there as the first inhabitant. And now\nI was astounded to hear him claim another year, which could not be\nallowed him.\n\n\"That impudent fellow Grundle has been with me,\" he continued, \"and\nwishes to make me believe that he can get rid of me in one year. I\nhave, at any rate, two years left of my out-of-door existence, and I\ndo not mean to give up a day of it for Grundle or any one else.\"\n\nIt was something to see that he still recognised the law, though he\nwas so meanly anxious to evade it. There had been some whisperings in\nthe empire among the elderly men and women of a desire to obtain the\nassistance of Great Britain in setting it aside. Peter Grundle, for\ninstance, Crasweller's senior partner, had been heard to say that\nEngland would not allow a deposited man to be slaughtered. There was\nmuch in that which had angered me. The word slaughter was in itself\npeculiarly objectionable to my ears,--to me who had undertaken to\nperform the first ceremony as an act of grace. And what had England\nto do with our laws? It was as though Russia were to turn upon the\nUnited States and declare that their Congress should be put down.\nWhat would avail the loudest voice of Great Britain against the\nsmallest spark of a law passed by our Assembly?--unless, indeed,\nGreat Britain should condescend to avail herself of her great power,\nand thus to crush the free voice of those whom she had already\nrecognised as independent. As I now write, this is what she has\nalready done, and history will have to tell the story. But it was\nespecially sad to have to think that there should be a Britannulist\nso base, such a coward, such a traitor, as himself to propose this\nexpedient for adding a few years to his own wretched life.\n\nBut Crasweller did not, as it seemed, intend to avail himself of\nthese whispers. His mind was intent on devising some falsehood by\nwhich he should obtain for himself just one other year of life, and\nhis expectant son-in-law purposed to prevent him. I hardly knew as I\nturned it all in my mind, which of the two was the more sordid; but I\nthink that my sympathies were rather in accord with the cowardice of\nthe old man than with the greed of the young. After all, I had known\nfrom the beginning that the fear of death was a human weakness. To\nobliterate that fear from the human heart, and to build up a perfect\nmanhood that should be liberated from so vile a thraldom, had been\none of the chief objects of my scheme. I had no right to be angry\nwith Crasweller, because Crasweller, when tried, proved himself to\nbe no stronger than the world at large. It was a matter to me of\ninfinite regret that it should be so. He was the very man, the very\nfriend, on whom I had relied with confidence! But his weakness was\nonly a proof that I myself had been mistaken. In all that Assembly\nby which the law had been passed, consisting chiefly of young men,\nwas there one on whom I could rest with confidence to carry out the\npurpose of the law when his own time should come? Ought I not so to\nhave arranged matters that I myself should have been the first,--to\nhave postponed the use of the college till such time as I might\nmyself have been deposited? This had occurred to me often throughout\nthe whole agitation; but then it had occurred also that none might\nperhaps follow me, when under such circumstances I should have\ndeparted!\n\nBut in my heart I could forgive Crasweller. For Grundle I felt\nnothing but personal dislike. He was anxious to hurry on the\ndeposition of his father-in-law, in order that the entire possession\nof Little Christchurch might come into his own hands just one year\nthe earlier! No doubt he knew the exact age of the man as well as\nI did, but it was not for him to have hastened his deposition. And\nthen I could not but think, even in this moment of public misery, how\nwilling Jack would have been to have assisted old Crasweller in his\nlittle fraud, so that Eva might have been the reward. My belief is\nthat he would have sworn against his own father, perjured himself\nin the very teeth of truth, to have obtained from Eva that little\nprivilege which I had once seen Grundle enjoying.\n\nI was sitting there silent in Crasweller's verandah as all this\npassed through my mind. But before I spoke again I was enabled to see\nclearly what duty required of me. Eva and Little Christchurch, with\nJack's feelings and interests, and all my wife's longings, must be\nlaid on one side, and my whole energy must be devoted to the literal\ncarrying out of the law. It was a great world's movement that had\nbeen projected, and if it were to fail now, just at its commencement,\nwhen everything had been arranged for the work, when again would\nthere be hope? It was a matter which required legislative sanction in\nwhatever country might adopt it. No despot could attempt it, let his\npower be ever so confirmed. The whole country would rise against him\nwhen informed, in its ignorance, of the contemplated intention. Nor\ncould it be effected by any congress of which the large majority were\nnot at any rate under forty years of age. I had seen enough of human\nnature to understand its weakness in this respect. All circumstances\nhad combined to make it practicable in Britannula, but all these\ncircumstances might never be combined again. And it seemed to me to\ndepend now entirely on the power which I might exert in creating\ncourage in the heart of the poor timid creature who sat before me.\nI did know that were Britannula to appeal aloud to England, England,\nwith that desire for interference which has always characterised her,\nwould interfere. But if the empire allowed the working of the law\nto be commenced in silence, then the Fixed Period might perhaps be\nregarded as a thing settled. How much, then, depended on the words\nwhich I might use!\n\n\"Crasweller,\" I said, \"my friend, my brother!\"\n\n\"I don't know much about that. A man ought not to be so anxious to\nkill his brother.\"\n\n\"If I could take your place, as God will be my judge, I would do so\nwith as ready a step as a young man to the arms of his beloved. And\nif for myself, why not for my brother?\"\n\n\"You do not know,\" he said. \"You have not, in truth, been tried.\"\n\n\"Would that you could try me!\"\n\n\"And we are not all made of such stuff as you. You have talked about\nthis till you have come to be in love with deposition and departure.\nBut such is not the natural condition of a man. Look back upon all\nthe centuries, and you will perceive that life has ever been dear\nto the best of men. And you will perceive also that they who have\nbrought themselves to suicide have encountered the contempt of their\nfellow-creatures.\"\n\nI would not tell him of Cato and Brutus, feeling that I could not\nstir him to grandeur of heart by Roman instances. He would have told\nme that in those days, as far as the Romans knew,\n\n\n      \"the Everlasting had not fixed\n   His canon 'gainst self-slaughter.\"\n\n\nI must reach him by other methods than these, if at all. \"Who can be\nmore alive than you,\" I said, \"to the fact that man, by the fear of\ndeath, is degraded below the level of the brutes?\"\n\n\"If so, he is degraded,\" said Crasweller. \"It is his condition.\"\n\n\"But need he remain so? Is it not for you and me to raise him to a\nhigher level?\"\n\n\"Not for me--not for me, certainly. I own that I am no more than\nman. Little Christchurch is so pleasant to me, and Eva's smiles and\nhappiness; and the lowing of my flocks and the bleating of my sheep\nare so gracious in my ears, and it is so sweet to my eyes to see how\nfairly I have turned this wilderness into a paradise, that I own that\nI would fain stay here a little longer.\"\n\n\"But the law, my friend, the law,--the law which you yourself have\nbeen so active in creating.\"\n\n\"The law allows me two years yet,\" said he; that look of stubbornness\nwhich I had before observed again spreading itself over his face.\n\nNow this was a lie; an absolute, undoubted, demonstrable lie. And\nyet it was a lie which, by its mere telling, might be made available\nfor its intended purpose. If it were known through the capital that\nCrasweller was anxious to obtain a year's grace by means of so foul a\nlie, the year's grace would be accorded to him. And then the Fixed\nPeriod would be at an end.\n\n\"I will tell you what it is,\" said he, anxious to represent his\nwishes to me in another light. \"Grundle wants to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"Grundle, I fear, has truth on his side,\" said I, determined to show\nhim that I, at any rate, would not consent to lend myself to the\nfurtherance of a falsehood.\n\n\"Grundle wants to get rid of me,\" he repeated in the same tone. \"But\nhe shan't find that I am so easy to deal with. Eva already does\nnot above half like him. Eva thinks that this depositing plan is\nabominable. She says that no good Christians ever thought of it.\"\n\n\"A child--a sweet child--but still only a child; and brought up by\nher mother with all the old prejudices.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about that. I never knew a decent woman who wasn't\nan Episcopalian. Eva is at any rate a good girl, to endeavour to save\nher father; and I'll tell you what--it is not too late yet. As far as\nmy opinion goes, Jack Neverbend is ten to one a better sort of fellow\nthan Abraham Grundle. Of course a promise has been made; but promises\nare like pie-crusts. Don't you think that Jack Neverbend is quite old\nenough to marry a wife, and that he only needs be told to make up\nhis mind to do it? Little Christchurch would do just as well for him\nas for Grundle. If he don't think much of the girl he must think\nsomething of the sheep.\"\n\nNot think much of the girl! Just at this time Jack was talking to\nhis mother, morning, noon, and night, about Eva, and threatening\nyoung Grundle with all kinds of schoolboy punishments if he should\npersevere in his suit. Only yesterday he had insulted Abraham\ngrossly, and, as I had reason to suspect, had been more than once\nout to Christchurch on some clandestine object, as to which it was\nnecessary, he thought, to keep old Crasweller in the dark. And then\nto be told in this manner that Jack didn't think much of Eva, and\nshould be encouraged in preference to look after the sheep! He would\nhave sacrificed every sheep on the place for the sake of half an hour\nwith Eva alone in the woods. But he was afraid of Crasweller, whom he\nknew to have sanctioned an engagement with Abraham Grundle.\n\n\"I don't think that we need bring Jack and his love into this\ndispute,\" said I.\n\n\"Only that it isn't too late, you know. Do you think that Jack could\nbe brought to lend an ear to it?\"\n\nPerish Jack! perish Eva! perish Jack's mother, before I would allow\nmyself to be bribed in this manner, to abandon the great object\nof all my life! This was evidently Crasweller's purpose. He was\nendeavouring to tempt me with his flocks and herds. The temptation,\nhad he known it, would have been with Eva,--with Eva and the genuine,\ndownright, honest love of my gallant boy. I knew, too, that at home\nI should not dare to tell my wife that the offer had been made to\nme and had been refused. My wife could not understand,--Crasweller\ncould not understand,--how strong may be the passion founded on the\nconviction of a life. And honesty, simple honesty, would forbid\nit. For me to strike a bargain with one already destined for\ndeposition,--that he should be withdrawn from his glorious, his\nalmost immortal state, on the payment of a bribe to me and my family!\nI had called this man my friend and brother, but how little had the\nman known me! Could I have saved all Gladstonopolis from imminent\nflames by yielding an inch in my convictions, I would not have\ndone so in my then frame of mind; and yet this man,--my friend and\nbrother,--had supposed that I could be bought to change my purpose by\nthe pretty slopes and fat flocks of Little Christchurch!\n\n\"Crasweller,\" said I, \"let us keep these two things separate; or\nrather, in discussing the momentous question of the Fixed Period, let\nus forget the loves of a boy and a girl.\"\n\n\"But the sheep, and the oxen, and the pastures! I can still make my\nwill.\"\n\n\"The sheep, and the oxen, and the pastures must also be forgotten.\nThey can have nothing to do with the settlement of this matter. My\nboy is dear to me, and Eva is dear also, but not to save even their\nyoung lives could I consent to a falsehood in this matter.\"\n\n\"Falsehood! There is no falsehood intended.\"\n\n\"Then there need be no bargain as to Eva, and no need for discussing\nthe flocks and herds on this occasion. Crasweller, you are sixty-six\nnow, and will be sixty-seven this time next year. Then the period of\nyour deposition will have arrived, and in the year following,--two\nyears hence, mind,--the Fixed Period of your departure will have\ncome.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is not such the truth?\"\n\n\"No; you put it all on a year too far. I was never more than nine\nyears older than you. I remember it all as well as though it were\nyesterday when we first agreed to come away from New Zealand. When\nwill you have to be deposited?\"\n\n\"In 1989,\" I said carefully. \"My Fixed Period is 1990.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and mine is nine years earlier. It always was nine years\nearlier.\"\n\nIt was all manifestly untrue. He knew it to be untrue. For the sake\nof one poor year he was imploring my assent to a base falsehood, and\nwas endeavouring to add strength to his prayer by a bribe. How could\nI talk to a man who would so far descend from the dignity of manhood?\nThe law was there to support me, and the definition of the law was\nin this instance supported by ample evidence. I need only go before\nthe executive of which I myself was the chief, desire that the\nestablished documents should be searched, and demand the body of\nGabriel Crasweller to be deposited in accordance with the law\nas enacted. But there was no one else to whom I could leave the\nperformance of this invidious task, as a matter of course. There\nwere aldermen in Gladstonopolis and magistrates in the country\nwhose duty it would no doubt be to see that the law was carried out.\nArrangements to this effect had been studiously made by myself. Such\narrangements would no doubt be carried out when the working of the\nFixed Period had become a thing established. But I had long foreseen\nthat the first deposition should be effected with some _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of\nvoluntary glory. It would be very detrimental to the cause to see my\nspecial friend Crasweller hauled away to the college by constables\nthrough the streets of Gladstonopolis, protesting that he was forced\nto his doom twelve months before the appointed time. Crasweller was\na popular man in Britannula, and the people around would not be so\nconversant with the fact as was I, nor would they have the same\nreasons to be anxious that the law should be accurately followed.\nAnd yet how much depended upon the accuracy of following the law! A\nwilling obedience was especially desired in the first instance, and a\nwilling obedience I had expected from my friend Crasweller.\n\n\"Crasweller,\" I said, addressing him with great solemnity; \"it is not\nso.\"\n\n\"It is--it is; I say it is.\"\n\n\"It is not so. The books that have been printed and sworn to, which\nhave had your own assent with that of others, are all against you.\"\n\n\"It was a mistake. I have got a letter from my old aunt in Hampshire,\nwritten to my mother when I was born, which proves the mistake.\"\n\n\"I remember the letter well,\" I said,--for we had all gone through\nsuch documents in performing the important task of settling the\nPeriod. \"You were born in New South Wales, and the old lady in\nEngland did not write till the following year.\"\n\n\"Who says so? How can you prove it? She wasn't at all the woman to\nlet a year go by before she congratulated her sister.\"\n\n\"We have your own signature affirming the date.\"\n\n\"How was I to know when I was born? All that goes for nothing.\"\n\n\"And unfortunately,\" said I, as though clenching the matter, \"the\nBible exists in which your father entered the date with his usual\nexemplary accuracy.\" Then he was silent for a moment as though having\nno further evidence to offer. \"Crasweller,\" said I, \"are you not man\nenough to do this thing in a straightforward, manly manner?\"\n\n\"One year!\" he exclaimed. \"I only ask for one year. I do think that,\nas the first victim, I have a right to expect that one year should be\ngranted me. Then Jack Neverbend shall have Little Christchurch, and\nthe sheep, and the cattle, and Eva also, as his own for ever and\never,--or at any rate till he too shall be led away to execution!\"\n\nA victim; and execution! What language in which to speak of the great\nsystem! For myself I was determined that though I would be gentle\nwith him I would not yield an inch. The law at any rate was with me,\nand I did not think as yet that Crasweller would lend himself to\nthose who spoke of inviting the interference of England. The law was\non my side, and so must still be all those who in the Assembly had\nvoted for the Fixed Period. There had been enthusiasm then, and the\ndifferent clauses had been carried by large majorities. A dozen\ndifferent clauses had been carried, each referring to various\nbranches of the question. Not only had the period been fixed, but\nmoney had been voted for the college; and the mode of life at the\ncollege had been settled; the very amusements of the old men had been\nsanctioned; and last, but not least, the very manner of departure had\nbeen fixed. There was the college now, a graceful building surrounded\nby growing shrubs and broad pleasant walks for the old men, endowed\nwith a kitchen in which their taste should be consulted, and with a\nchapel for such of those who would require to pray in public; and all\nthis would be made a laughing-stock to Britannula, if this old man\nCrasweller declined to enter the gates. \"It must be done,\" I said in\na tone of firm decision.\n\n\"No!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Crasweller, it must be done. The law demands it.\"\n\n\"No, no; not by me. You and young Grundle together are in a\nconspiracy to get rid of me. I am not going to be shut up a whole\nyear before my time.\"\n\nWith that he stalked into the inner house, leaving me alone on the\nverandah. I had nothing for it but to turn on the electric lamp of my\ntricycle and steam back to Government House at Gladstonopolis with a\nsad heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nJACK NEVERBEND.\n\n\nSix months passed away, which, I must own to me was a period of great\ndoubt and unhappiness, though it was relieved by certain moments\nof triumph. Of course, as the time drew nearer, the question of\nCrasweller's deposition became generally discussed by the public of\nGladstonopolis. And so also did the loves of Abraham Grundle and Eva\nCrasweller. There were \"Evaites\" and \"Abrahamites\" in the community;\nfor though the match had not yet been altogether broken, it was known\nthat the two young people differed altogether on the question of the\nold man's deposition. It was said by the defendents of Grundle, who\nwere to be found for the most part among the young men and young\nwomen, that Abraham was simply anxious to carry out the laws of his\ncountry. It happened that, during this period, he was elected to a\nvacant seat in the Assembly, so that, when the matter came on for\ndiscussion there, he was able to explain publicly his motives; and\nit must be owned that he did so with good words and with a certain\namount of youthful eloquence. As for Eva, she was simply intent on\npreserving the lees of her father's life, and had been heard to\nexpress an opinion that the college was \"all humbug,\" and that people\nought to be allowed to live as long as it pleased God to let them.\nOf course she had with her the elderly ladies of the community, and\namong them my own wife as the foremost. Mrs Neverbend had never made\nherself prominent before in any public question; but on this she\nseemed to entertain a very warm opinion. Whether this arose entirely\nfrom her desire to promote Jack's welfare, or from a reflection that\nher own period of deposition was gradually becoming nearer, I never\ncould quite make up my mind. She had, at any rate, ten years to run,\nand I never heard from her any expressed fear of,--departure. She\nwas,--and is,--a brave, good woman, attached to her household duties,\nanxious for her husband's comfort, but beyond measure solicitous for\nall good things to befall that scapegrace Jack Neverbend, for whom\nshe thinks that nothing is sufficiently rich or sufficiently grand.\nJack is a handsome boy, I grant, but that is about all that can be\nsaid of him; and in this matter he has been diametrically opposed to\nhis father from first to last.\n\nIt will be seen that, in such circumstances, none of these moments\nof triumph to which I have alluded can have come to me within my\nown home. There Mrs Neverbend and Jack, and after a while Eva, sat\ntogether in perpetual council against me. When these meetings first\nbegan, Eva still acknowledged herself to be the promised bride of\nAbraham Grundle. There were her own vows, and her parent's assent,\nand something perhaps of remaining love. But presently she whispered\nto my wife that she could not but feel horror for the man who was\nanxious to \"murder her father;\" and by-and-by she began to own that\nshe thought Jack a fine fellow. We had a wonderful cricket club in\nGladstonopolis, and Britannula had challenged the English cricketers\nto come and play on the Little Christchurch ground, which they\ndeclared to be the only cricket ground as yet prepared on the face\nof the earth which had all the accomplishments possible for the due\nprosecution of the game. Now Jack, though very young, was captain\nof the club, and devoted much more of his time to that occupation\nthan to his more legitimate business as a merchant. Eva, who had\nnot hitherto paid much attention to cricket, became on a sudden\npassionately devoted to it; whereas Abraham Grundle, with a\nsteadiness beyond his years, gave himself up more than ever to the\nbusiness of the Assembly, and expressed some contempt for the game,\nthough he was no mean player.\n\nIt had become necessary during this period to bring forward in the\nAssembly the whole question of the Fixed Period, as it was felt that,\nin the present state of public opinion, it would not be expedient to\ncarry out the established law without the increased sanction which\nwould be given to it by a further vote in the House. Public opinion\nwould have forbidden us to deposit Crasweller without some such\nfurther authority. Therefore it was deemed necessary that a question\nshould be asked, in which Crasweller's name was not mentioned, but\nwhich might lead to some general debate. Young Grundle demanded one\nmorning whether it was the intention of the Government to see that\nthe different clauses as to the new law respecting depositions were\nat once carried out. \"The House is aware, I believe,\" he said, \"that\nthe first operation will soon be needed.\" I may as well state here\nthat this was repeated to Eva, and that she pretended to take huff at\nsuch a question from her lover. It was most indecent, she said; and\nshe, after such words, must drop him for ever. It was not for some\nmonths after that, that she allowed Jack's name to be mentioned\nwith her own; but I was aware that it was partly settled between\nher and Jack and Mrs Neverbend. Grundle declared his intention of\nproceeding against old Crasweller in reference to the breach of\ncontract, according to the laws of Britannula; but that Jack's party\ndisregarded altogether. In telling this, however, I am advancing a\nlittle beyond the point in my story to which I have as yet carried my\nreader.\n\nThen there arose a debate upon the whole principle of the measure,\nwhich was carried on with great warmth. I, as President, of course\ntook no part in it; but, in accordance with our constitution, I heard\nit all from the chair which I usually occupied at the Speaker's right\nhand. The arguments on which the greatest stress was laid tended to\nshow that the Fixed Period had been carried chiefly with a view to\nrelieving the miseries of the old. And it was conclusively shown\nthat, in a very great majority of cases, life beyond sixty-eight was\nall vanity and vexation of spirit. That other argument as to the\ncostliness of old men to the state was for the present dropped. Had\nyou listened to young Grundle, insisting with all the vehemence\nof youth on the absolute wretchedness to which the aged had been\ncondemned by the absence of any such law,--had you heard the miseries\nof rheumatism, gout, stone, and general debility pictured in the\neloquent words of five-and-twenty,--you would have felt that all\nwho could lend themselves to perpetuate such a state of things must\nbe guilty of fiendish cruelty. He really rose to a great height\nof parliamentary excellence, and altogether carried with him the\nyounger, and luckily the greater, part of the House. There was really\nnothing to be said on the other side, except a repetition of the\nprejudices of the Old World. But, alas! so strong are the weaknesses\nof the world, that prejudice can always vanquish truth by the mere\nstrength of its battalions. Not till it had been proved and re-proved\nten times over, was it understood that the sun could not have stood\nstill upon Gideon. Crasweller, who was a member, and who took\nhis seat during these debates without venturing to speak, merely\nwhispered to his neighbour that the heartless greedy fellow was\nunwilling to wait for the wools of Little Christchurch.\n\nThree divisions were made on the debate, and thrice did the\nFixed-Periodists beat the old party by a majority of fifteen in a\nHouse consisting of eighty-five members. So strong was the feeling\nin the empire, that only two members were absent, and the number\nremained the same during the whole week of the debate. This, I did\nthink, was a triumph; and I felt that the old country, which had\nreally nothing on earth to do with the matter, could not interfere\nwith an opinion expressed so strongly. My heart throbbed with\npleasureable emotion as I heard that old age, which I was myself\napproaching, depicted in terms which made its impotence truly\nconspicuous,--till I felt that, had it been proposed to deposit all\nof us who had reached the age of fifty-eight, I really think that\nI should joyfully have given my assent to such a measure, and have\nwalked off at once and deposited myself in the college.\n\nBut it was only at such moments that I was allowed to experience this\nfeeling of triumph. I was encountered not only in my own house but in\nsociety generally, and on the very streets of Gladstonopolis, by the\nexpression of an opinion that Crasweller would not be made to retire\nto the college at his Fixed Period. \"What on earth is there to hinder\nit?\" I said once to my old friend Ruggles. Ruggles was now somewhat\nover sixty, and was an agent in the town for country wool-growers.\nHe took no part in politics; and though he had never agreed to\nthe principle of the Fixed Period, had not interested himself in\nopposition to it. He was a man whom I regarded as indifferent to\nlength of life, but one who would, upon the whole, rather face such\nlot as Nature might intend for him, than seek to improve it by any\nnew reform.\n\n\"Eva Crasweller will hinder it,\" said Ruggles.\n\n\"Eva is a mere child. Do you suppose that her opinion will be allowed\nto interrupt the laws of the whole community, and oppose the progress\nof civilisation?\"\n\n\"Her feelings will,\" said Ruggles. \"Who's to stand a daughter\ninterceding for the life of her father?\"\n\n\"One man cannot, but eighty-five can do so.\"\n\n\"The eighty-five will be to the community just what the one would be\nto the eighty-five. I am not saying anything about your law. I am\nnot expressing an opinion whether it would be good or bad. I should\nlike to live out my own time, though I acknowledge that you Assembly\nmen have on your shoulders the responsibility of deciding whether I\nshall do so or not. You could lead me away and deposit me without any\ntrouble, because I am not popular. But the people are beginning to\ntalk about Eva Crasweller and Abraham Grundle, and I tell you that\nall the volunteers you have in Britannula will not suffice to take\nthe old man to the college, and to keep him there till you have\npolished him off. He would be deposited again at Little Christchurch\nin triumph, and the college would be left a wreck behind him.\"\n\nThis view of the case was peculiarly distressing to me. As the\nchief magistrate of the community, nothing is so abhorrent to me as\nrebellion. Of a populace that are not law-abiding, nothing but evil\ncan be predicted; whereas a people who will obey the laws cannot but\nbe prosperous. It grieved me greatly to be told that the inhabitants\nof Gladstonopolis would rise in tumult and destroy the college merely\nto favour the views of a pretty girl. Was there any honour, or worse\nagain, could there be any utility, in being the President of a\nrepublic in which such things could happen? I left my friend Ruggles\nin the street, and passed on to the executive hall in a very painful\nframe of mind.\n\nWhen there, tidings reached me of a much sadder nature. At the very\nmoment at which I had been talking with Ruggles in the street on the\nsubject, a meeting had been held in the market-place with the express\npurpose of putting down the Fixed Period; and who had been the chief\norator on the occasion but Jack Neverbend! My own son had taken upon\nhimself this new work of public speechifying in direct opposition to\nhis own father! And I had reason to believe that he was instigated\nto do so by my own wife! \"Your son, sir, has been addressing the\nmultitude about the Fixed Period, and they say that it has been quite\nbeautiful to hear him.\" It was thus that the matter was told me by\none of the clerks in my office, and I own that I did receive some\nslight pleasure at finding that Jack could do something beyond\ncricket. But it became immediately necessary to take steps to\nstop the evil, and I was the more bound to do so because the only\ndelinquent named to me was my own son.\n\n\"If it be so,\" I said aloud in the office, \"Jack Neverbend shall\nsleep this night in prison.\" But it did not occur to me at the moment\nthat it would be necessary I should have formal evidence that Jack\nwas conspiring against the laws before I could send him to jail. I\nhad no more power over him in that respect than on any one else. Had\nI declared that he should be sent to bed without his supper, I should\nhave expressed myself better both as a father and a magistrate.\n\nI went home, and on entering the house the first person that I saw\nwas Eva. Now, as this matter went on, I became full of wrath with\nmy son, and with my wife, and with poor old Crasweller; but I never\ncould bring myself to be angry with Eva. There was a coaxing, sweet,\nfeminine way with her which overcame all opposition. And I had\nalready begun to regard her as my daughter-in-law, and to love\nher dearly in that position, although there were moments in which\nJack's impudence and new spirit of opposition almost tempted me to\ndisinherit him.\n\n\"Eva,\" I said, \"what is this that I hear of a public meeting in the\nstreets?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Neverbend,\" she said, taking me by the arm, \"there are only\na few boys who are talking about papa.\" Through all the noises and\ntumults of these times there was an evident determination to speak\nof Jack as a boy. Everything that he did and all that he said were\nmerely the efflux of his high spirits as a schoolboy. Eva always\nspoke of him as a kind of younger brother. And yet I soon found that\nthe one opponent whom I had most to fear in Britannula was my own\nson.\n\n\"But why,\" I asked, \"should these foolish boys discuss the serious\nquestion respecting your dear father in the public street?\"\n\n\"They don't want to have him--deposited,\" she said, almost sobbing as\nshe spoke.\n\n\"But, my dear,\" I began, determined to teach her the whole theory of\nthe Fixed Period with all its advantages from first to last.\n\nBut she interrupted me at once. \"Oh, Mr Neverbend, I know what a good\nthing it is--to talk about. I have no doubt the world will be a great\ndeal the better for it. And if all the papas had been deposited for\nthe last five hundred years, I don't suppose that I should care so\nmuch about it. But to be the first that ever it happened to in all\nthe world! Why should papa be the first? You ought to begin with some\nweak, crotchety, poor old cripple, who would be a great deal better\nout of the way. But papa is in excellent health, and has all his wits\nabout him a great deal better than Mr Grundle. He manages everything\nat Little Christchurch, and manages it very well.\"\n\n\"But, my dear--\" I was going to explain to her that in a question\nof such enormous public interest as this of the Fixed Period it\nwas impossible to consider the merits of individual cases. But she\ninterrupted me again before I could get out a word.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Neverbend, they'll never be able to do it, and I'm afraid\nthat then you'll be vexed.\"\n\n\"My dear, if the law be--\"\n\n\"Oh yes, the law is a very beautiful thing; but what's the good of\nlaws if they cannot be carried out? There's Jack there;--of course\nhe is only a boy, but he swears that all the executive, and all the\nAssembly, and all the volunteers in Britannula, shan't lead my papa\ninto that beastly college.\"\n\n\"Beastly! My dear, you cannot have seen the college. It is perfectly\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"That's only what Jack says. It's Jack that calls it beastly. Of\ncourse he's not much of a man as yet, but he is your own son. And I\ndo think, that for an earnest spirit about a thing, Jack is a very\nfine fellow.\"\n\n\"Abraham Grundle, you know, is just as warm on the other side.\"\n\n\"I hate Abraham Grundle. I don't want ever to hear his name again.\nI understand very well what it is that Abraham Grundle is after. He\nnever cared a straw for me; nor I much for him, if you come to that.\"\n\n\"But you are contracted.\"\n\n\"If you think that I am going to marry a man because our names have\nbeen written down in a book together, you are very much mistaken. He\nis a nasty mean fellow, and I will never speak to him again as long\nas I live. He would deposit papa this very moment if he had the\npower. Whereas Jack is determined to stand up for him as long as he\nhas got a tongue to shout or hands to fight.\" These were terrible\nwords, but I had heard the same sentiment myself from Jack's own\nlips. \"Of course Jack is nothing to me,\" she continued, with that\nhalf sob which had become habitual to her whenever she was forced to\nspeak of her father's deposition. \"He is only a boy, but we all know\nthat he could thrash Abraham Grundle at once. And to my thinking he\nis much more fit to be a member of the Assembly.\"\n\nAs she would not hear a word that I said to her, and was only intent\non expressing the warmth of her own feelings, I allowed her to go\nher way, and retired to the privacy of my own library. There I\nendeavoured to console myself as best I might by thinking of the\nbrilliant nature of Jack's prospects. He himself was over head and\nears in love with Eva, and it was clear to me that Eva was nearly\nas fond of him. And then the sly rogue had found the certain way to\nobtain old Crasweller's consent. Grundle had thought that if he could\nonce see his father-in-law deposited, he would have nothing to do but\nto walk into Little Christchurch as master. That was the accusation\ngenerally made against him in Gladstonopolis. But Jack, who did not,\nas far as I could see, care a straw for humanity in the matter, had\nvehemently taken the side of the Anti-Fixed-Periodists as the safest\nway to get the father's consent. There was a contract of marriage,\nno doubt, and Grundle would be entitled to take a quarter of the\nfather's possessions if he could prove that the contract had been\nbroken. Such was the law of Britannula on the subject. But not a\nshilling had as yet been claimed by any man under that law. And\nCrasweller no doubt concluded that Grundle would be unwilling to bear\nthe odium of being the first. And there were clauses in the law which\nwould make it very difficult for him to prove the validity of the\ncontract. It had been already asserted by many that a girl could\nnot be expected to marry the man who had endeavoured to destroy her\nfather; and although in my mind there could be no doubt that Abraham\nGrundle had only done his duty as a senator, there was no knowing\nwhat view of the case a jury might take in Gladstonopolis. And then,\nif the worst came to the worst, Crasweller would resign a fourth of\nhis property almost without a pang, and Jack would content himself in\nmaking the meanness of Grundle conspicuous to his fellow-citizens.\n\nAnd now I must confess that, as I sat alone in my library, I did\nhesitate for an hour as to my future conduct. Might it not be better\nfor me to abandon altogether the Fixed Period and all its glories?\nEven in Britannula the world might be too strong for me. Should I\nnot take the good things that were offered, and allow Jack to marry\nhis wife and be happy in his own way? In my very heart I loved him\nquite as well as did his mother, and thought that he was the finest\nyoung fellow that Britannula had produced. And if this kind of thing\nwent on, it might be that I should be driven to quarrel with him\naltogether, and to have him punished under the law, like some old\nRoman of old. And I must confess that my relations with Mrs Neverbend\nmade me very unfit to ape the Roman _paterfamilias_. She never\ninterfered with public business, but she had a way of talking about\nhousehold matters in which she was always victorious. Looking back as\nI did at this moment on the past, it seemed to me that she and Jack,\nwho were the two persons I loved best in the world, had been the\nenemies who had always successfully conspired against me. \"Do have\ndone with your Fixed Period and nonsense,\" she had said to me only\nyesterday. \"It's all very well for the Assembly; but when you come\nto killing poor Mr Crasweller in real life, it is quite out of the\nquestion.\" And then, when I began to explain to her at length the\nimmense importance of the subject, she only remarked that that would\ndo very well for the Assembly. Should I abandon it all, take the good\nthings with which God had provided me, and retire into private life?\nI had two sides to my character, and could see myself sitting in\nluxurious comfort amidst the furniture of Crasweller's verandah\nwhile Eva and her children were around, and Jack was standing with\na cigar in his mouth outside laying down the law for the cricketers\nat Gladstonopolis. \"Were not better done as others use,\" I said to\nmyself over and over again as I sat there wearied with this contest,\nand thinking of the much more frightful agony I should be called upon\nto endure when the time had actually come for the departure of old\nCrasweller.\n\nAnd then again if I should fail! For half an hour or so I did fear\nthat I should fail. I had been always a most popular magistrate, but\nnow, it seemed, had come the time in which all my popularity must be\nabandoned. Jack, who was quick enough at understanding the aspect of\nthings, had already begun to ask the people whether they would see\ntheir old friend Crasweller murdered in cold blood. It was a dreadful\nword, but I was assured that he had used it. How would it be when the\ntime even for depositing had come, and an attempt was made to lead\nthe old man up through the streets of Gladstonopolis? Should I have\nstrength of character to perform the task in opposition to the loudly\nexpressed wishes of the inhabitants, and to march him along protected\nby a strong body of volunteers? And how would it be if the volunteers\nthemselves refused to act on the side of law and order? Should I not\nabsolutely fail; and would it not afterwards be told of me that, as\nPresident, I had broken down in an attempt to carry out the project\nwith which my name had been so long associated?\n\nAs I sat there alone I had almost determined to yield. But suddenly\nthere came upon me a memory of Socrates, of Galileo, of Hampden, and\nof Washington. What great things had these men done by constancy,\nin opposition to the wills and prejudices of the outside world! How\ntriumphant they now appeared to have been in fighting against the\nenormous odds which power had brought against them! And how pleasant\nnow were the very sounds of their names to all who loved their\nfellow-creatures! In some moments of private thought, anxious as\nwere now my own, they too must have doubted. They must have asked\nthemselves the question, whether they were strong enough to carry\ntheir great reforms against the world. But in these very moments the\nnecessary strength had been given to them. It must have been that,\nwhen almost despairing, they had been comforted by an inner truth,\nand had been all but inspired to trust with confidence in their\ncause. They, too, had been weak, and had trembled, and had almost\nfeared. But they had found in their own hearts that on which they\ncould rely. Had they been less sorely pressed than was I now at this\npresent moment? Had not they believed and trusted and been confident?\nAs I thought of it, I became aware that it was not only necessary for\na man to imagine new truths, but to be able to endure, and to suffer,\nand to bring them to maturity. And how often before a truth was\nbrought to maturity must it be necessary that he who had imagined\nit, and seen it, and planned it, must give his very life for it,\nand all in vain? But not perhaps all in vain as far as the world\nwas concerned; but only in vain in regard to the feelings and\nknowledge of the man himself. In struggling for the welfare of his\nfellow-creatures, a man must dare to endure to be obliterated,--must\nbe content to go down unheard of,--or, worse still, ridiculed, and\nperhaps abused by all,--in order that something afterwards may remain\nof those changes which he has been enabled to see, but not to carry\nout. How many things are requisite to true greatness! But, first\nof all, is required that self-negation which is able to plan new\nblessings, although certain that those blessings will be accounted as\ncurses by the world at large.\n\nThen I got up, and as I walked about the room I declared to myself\naloud my purpose. Though I might perish in the attempt, I would\ncertainly endeavour to carry out the doctrine of the Fixed Period.\nThough the people might be against me, and regard me as their\nenemy,--that people for whose welfare I had done it all,--still\nI would persevere, even though I might be destined to fall in the\nattempt. Though the wife of my bosom and the son of my loins should\nturn against me, and embitter my last moments by their enmity, still\nwould I persevere. When they came to speak of the vices and the\nvirtues of President Neverbend,--to tell of his weakness and his\nstrength,--it should never be said of him that he had been deterred\nby fear of the people from carrying out the great measure which he\nhad projected solely for their benefit.\n\nComforted by this resolve, I went into Mrs Neverbend's parlour,\nwhere I found her son Jack sitting with her. They had evidently been\ntalking about Jack's speech in the market-place; and I could see that\nthe young orator's brow was still flushed with the triumph of the\nmoment. \"Father,\" said he, immediately, \"you will never be able to\ndeposit old Crasweller. People won't let you do it.\"\n\n\"The people of Britannula,\" I said, \"will never interfere to prevent\ntheir magistrate from acting in accordance with the law.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" said Mrs Neverbend. When my wife said \"bother,\" it was, I\nwas aware, of no use to argue with her. Indeed, Mrs Neverbend is a\nlady upon whom argument is for the most part thrown away. She forms\nher opinion from the things around her, and is, in regard to domestic\nlife, and to her neighbours, and to the conduct of people with whom\nshe lives, almost invariably right. She has a quick insight, and an\naffectionate heart, which together keep her from going astray. She\nknows how to do good, and when to do it. But to abstract argument,\nand to political truth, she is wilfully blind. I felt it to be\nnecessary that I should select this opportunity for making Jack\nunderstand that I would not fear his opposition; but I own that I\ncould have wished that Mrs Neverbend had not been present on the\noccasion.\n\n\"Won't they?\" said Jack. \"That's just what I fancy they will do.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that it is what you wish them to do,--that you\nthink it right that they should do it?\"\n\n\"I don't think Crasweller ought to be deposited, if you mean that,\nfather.\"\n\n\"Not though the law requires it?\" This I said in a tone of authority.\n\"Have you formed any idea in your own mind of the subjection to the\nlaw which is demanded from all good citizens? Have you ever bethought\nyourself that the law should be in all things--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr President, pray do not make a speech here,\" said my wife. \"I\nshall never understand it, and I do not think that Jack is much wiser\nthan I am.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean by a speech, Sarah.\" My wife's name is\nSarah. \"But it is necessary that Jack should be instructed that he,\nat any rate, must obey the law. He is my son, and, as such, it is\nessentially necessary that he should be amenable to it. The law\ndemands--\"\n\n\"You can't do it, and there's an end of it,\" said Mrs Neverbend.\n\"You and all your laws will never be able to put an end to poor Mr\nCrasweller,--and it would be a great shame if you did. You don't see\nit; but the feeling here in the city is becoming very strong. The\npeople won't have it; and I must say that it is only rational that\nJack should be on the same side. He is a man now, and has a right to\nhis own opinion as well as another.\"\n\n\"Jack,\" said I, with much solemnity, \"do you value your father's\nblessing?\"\n\n\"Well; sir, yes,\" said he. \"A blessing, I suppose, means something of\nan allowance paid quarterly.\"\n\nI turned away my face that he might not see the smile which I felt\nwas involuntarily creeping across it. \"Sir,\" said I, \"a father's\nblessing has much more than a pecuniary value. It includes that kind\nof relation between a parent and his son without which life would be\na burden to me, and, I should think, very grievous to you also.\"\n\n\"Of course I hope that you and I may always be on good terms.\"\n\nI was obliged to take this admission for what it was worth. \"If you\nwish to remain on good terms with me,\" said I, \"you must not oppose\nme in public when I am acting as a public magistrate.\"\n\n\"Is he to see Mr Crasweller murdered before his very eyes, and to say\nnothing about it?\" said Mrs Neverbend.\n\nOf all terms in the language there was none so offensive to me as\nthat odious word when used in reference to the ceremony which I had\nintended to be so gracious and alluring. \"Sarah,\" said I, turning\nupon her in my anger, \"that is a very improper word, and one which\nyou should not tempt the boy to use, especially in my presence.\"\n\n\"English is English, Mr President,\" she said. She always called me\n\"Mr President\" when she intended to oppose me.\n\n\"You might as well say that a man was murdered when he is--is--killed\nin battle.\" I had been about to say \"executed,\" but I stopped myself.\nMen are not executed in Britannula.\n\n\"No. He is fighting his country's battle and dies gloriously.\"\n\n\"He has his leg shot off, or his arm, and is too frequently left to\nperish miserably on the ground. Here every comfort will be provided\nfor him, so that he may depart from this world without a pang, when,\nin the course of years, he shall have lived beyond the period at\nwhich he can work and be useful.\"\n\n\"But look at Mr Crasweller, father. Who is more useful than he is?\"\n\nNothing had been more unlucky to me as the promoter of the Fixed\nPeriod than the peculiar healthiness and general sanity of him who\nwas by chance to be our first martyr. It might have been possible\nto make Jack understand that a rule which had been found to be\napplicable to the world at large was not fitted for some peculiar\nindividual, but it was quite impossible to bring this home to the\nmind of Mrs Neverbend. I must, I felt, choose some other opportunity\nfor expounding that side of the argument. I would at the present\nmoment take a leaf out of my wife's book and go straight to my\npurpose. \"I tell you what it is, young man,\" said I; \"I do not intend\nto be thwarted by you in carrying on the great reform to which I\nhave devoted my life. If you cannot hold your tongue at the present\nmoment, and abstain from making public addresses in the market-place,\nyou shall go out of Britannula. It is well that you should travel and\nsee something of the world before you commence the trade of public\norator. Now I think of it, the Alpine Club from Sydney are to be in\nNew Zealand this summer, and it will suit you very well to go and\nclimb up Mount Earnshawe and see all the beauties of nature instead\nof talking nonsense here in Gladstonopolis.\"\n\n\"Oh, father, I should like nothing better,\" cried Jack,\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mrs Neverbend; \"are you going to send the poor boy\nto break his neck among the glaciers? Don't you remember that Dick\nArdwinkle was lost there a year or two ago, and came to his death in\na most frightful manner?\"\n\n\"That was before I was born,\" said Jack, \"or at any rate very shortly\nafterwards. And they hadn't then invented the new patent steel\nclimbing arms. Since they came up, no one has ever been lost among\nthe glaciers.\"\n\n\"You had better prepare then to go,\" said I, thinking that the idea\nof getting rid of Jack in this manner was very happy.\n\n\"But, father,\" said he, \"of course I can't stir a step till after the\ngreat cricket-match.\"\n\n\"You must give up cricket for this time. So good an opportunity for\nvisiting the New Zealand mountains may never come again.\"\n\n\"Give up the match!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, the English sixteen are\ncoming here on purpose to play us, and swear that they'll beat us by\nmeans of the new catapult. But I know that our steam-bowler will beat\ntheir catapult hollow. At any rate I cannot stir from here till after\nthe match is over. I've got to arrange everything myself. Besides,\nthey do count something on my spring-batting. I should be regarded\nas absolutely a traitor to my country if I were to leave Britannula\nwhile this is going on. The young Marquis of Marylebone, their\nleader, is to stay at our house; and the vessel bringing them will be\ndue here about eleven o'clock next Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Eleven o'clock next Wednesday,\" said I, in surprise. I had not\nas yet heard of this match, nor of the coming of our aristocratic\nvisitor.\n\n\"They won't be above thirty minutes late at the outside. They left\nthe Land's End three weeks ago last Tuesday at two, and London at\nhalf-past ten. We have had three or four water telegrams from them\nsince they started, and they hadn't then lost ten minutes on the\njourney. Of course I must be at home to receive the Marquis of\nMarylebone.\"\n\nAll this set me thinking about many things. It was true that at such\na moment I could not use my parental authority to send Jack out of\nthe island. To such an extent had the childish amusements of youth\nbeen carried, as to give to them all the importance of politics and\nsocial science. What I had heard about this cricket-match had gone\nin at one ear and come out at the other; but now that it was brought\nhome to me, I was aware that all my authority would not serve to\nbanish Jack till it was over. Not only would he not obey me, but he\nwould be supported in his disobedience by even the elders of the\ncommunity. But perhaps the worst feature of it all was the arrival\njust now at Gladstonopolis of a crowd of educated Englishmen. When\nI say educated I mean prejudiced. They would be Englishmen with\nno ideas beyond those current in the last century, and would be\naltogether deaf to the wisdom of the Fixed Period. I saw at a glance\nthat I must wait till they should have taken their departure, and\npostpone all further discussion on the subject as far as might be\npossible till Gladstonopolis should have been left to her natural\nquiescence after the disturbance of the cricket. \"Very well,\" said\nI, leaving the room. \"Then it may come to pass that you will never be\nable to visit the wonderful glories of Mount Earnshawe.\"\n\n\"Plenty of time for that,\" said Jack, as I shut the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE CRICKET-MATCH.\n\n\nI had been of late so absorbed in the affairs of the Fixed Period,\nthat I had altogether forgotten the cricket-match and the noble\nstrangers who were about to come to our shores. Of course I had heard\nof it before, and had been informed that Lord Marylebone was to be\nour guest. I had probably also been told that Sir Lords Longstop and\nSir Kennington Oval were to be entertained at Little Christchurch.\nBut when I was reminded of this by Jack a few days later, it had\nquite gone out of my head. But I now at once began to recognise the\nimportance of the occasion, and to see that for the next two months\nCrasweller, the college, and the Fixed Period must be banished, if\nnot from my thoughts, at any rate from my tongue. Better could not be\ndone in the matter than to have them banished from the tongue of all\nthe world, as I certainly should not be anxious to have the subject\nventilated within hearing and speaking of the crowd of thoroughly\nold-fashioned, prejudiced, aristocratic young Englishmen who were\ncoming to us. The cricket-match sprang to the front so suddenly, that\nJack seemed to have forgotten all his energy respecting the college,\nand to have transferred his entire attention to the various weapons,\noffensive and defensive, wherewith the London club was, if possible,\nto be beaten. We are never short of money in Britannula; but it\nseemed, as I watched the various preparations made for carrying\non two or three days' play at Little Christchurch, that England\nmust be sending out another army to take another Sebastopol. More\nparaphernalia were required to enable these thirty-two lads to\nplay their game with propriety than would have been needed for the\ndepositing of half Gladstonopolis. Every man from England had his\nattendant to look after his bats and balls, and shoes and greaves;\nand it was necessary, of course, that our boys should be equally well\nserved. Each of them had two bicycles for his own use, and as they\nwere all constructed with the new double-acting levers, they passed\nbackwards and forwards along the bicycle track between the city and\nCrasweller's house with astonishing rapidity. I used to hear that\nthe six miles had been done in fifteen minutes. Then there came\na struggle with the English and the Britannulists, as to which\nwould get the nearest to fourteen minutes; till it seemed that\nbicycle-racing and not cricket had been the purpose for which the\nEnglish had sent out the 4000-ton steam-yacht at the expense of all\nthe cricketers of the nation. It was on this occasion that the track\nwas first divided for comers and goers, and that volunteers were set\nto prevent stragglers from crossing except by the regular bridges. I\nfound that I, the President of the Republic, was actually forbidden\nto go down in my tricycle to my old friend's house, unless I would\ndo so before noon. \"You'd be run over and made mince-meat of,\" said\nJack, speaking of such a catastrophe with less horror than I thought\nit ought to have engendered in his youthful mind. Poor Sir Lords was\nrun down by our Jack,--collided as Jack called it. \"He hadn't quite\nimpetus enough on to make the turning sharp as he ought,\" said Jack,\nwithout the slightest apparent regret at what had occurred. \"Another\ninch and a half would have saved him. If he can touch a ball from our\nsteam-bowler when I send it, I shall think more of his arms than I\ndo of his legs, and more of his eyes than I do of his lungs. What a\nfellow to send out! Why, he's thirty, and has been eating soup, they\ntell me, all through the journey.\" These young men had brought a\ndoctor with them, Dr MacNuffery, to prescribe to them what to eat and\ndrink at each meal; and the unfortunate baronet whom Jack had nearly\nslaughtered, had encountered the ill-will of the entire club because\nhe had called for mutton-broth when he was sea-sick.\n\nThey were to be a month in Britannula before they would begin the\nmatch, so necessary was it that each man should be in the best\npossible physical condition. They had brought their Dr MacNuffery,\nand our lads immediately found the need of having a doctor of their\nown. There was, I think, a little pretence in this, as though Dr\nBobbs had been a long-established officer of the Southern Cross\ncricket club, they had not in truth thought of it, and Bobbs was only\nappointed the night after MacNuffery's position and duties had been\nmade known. Bobbs was a young man just getting into practice in\nGladstonopolis, and understood measles, I fancy, better than the\ntraining of athletes. MacNuffery was the most disagreeable man of\nthe English party, and soon began to turn up his nose at Bobbs. But\nBobbs, I think, got the better of him. \"Do you allow coffee to your\nclub;--coffee?\" asked MacNuffery, in a voice mingling ridicule and\nreproof with a touch of satire, as he had begun to guess that Bobbs\nhad not been long attending to his present work. \"You'll find,\" said\nBobbs, \"that young men in our air do not need the restraints which\nare necessary to you English. Their fathers and mothers were not soft\nand flabby before them, as was the case with yours, I think.\" Lord\nMarylebone looked across the table, I am told, at Sir Kennington\nOval, and nothing afterwards was said about diet.\n\nBut a great trouble arose, which, however, rather assisted Jack in\nhis own prospects in the long-run,--though for a time it seemed to\nhave another effect. Sir Kennington Oval was much struck by Eva's\nbeauty, and, living as he did in Crasweller's house, soon had an\nopportunity of so telling her. Abraham Grundle was one of the\ncricketers, and, as such, was frequently on the ground at Little\nChristchurch; but he did not at present go into Crasweller's house,\nand the whole fashionable community of Gladstonopolis was beginning\nto entertain the opinion that that match was off. Grundle had\nbeen heard to declare most authoritatively that when the day came\nCrasweller should be deposited, and had given it as his opinion that\nthe power did not exist which could withstand the law of Britannula.\nWhether in this he preferred the law to Eva, or acted in anger\nagainst Crasweller for interfering with his prospects, or had an idea\nthat it would not be worth his while to marry the girl while the\ngirl's father should be left alive, or had gradually fallen into this\nbitterness of spirit from the opposition shown to him, I could not\nquite tell. And he was quite as hostile to Jack as to Crasweller. But\nhe seemed to entertain no aversion at all to Sir Kennington Oval;\nnor, I was informed, did Eva. I had known that for the last month\nJack's mother had been instant with him to induce him to speak out\nto Eva; but he, who hardly allowed me, his father, to open my mouth\nwithout contradicting me, and who in our house ordered everything\nabout just as though he were the master, was so bashful in the girl's\npresence that he had never as yet asked her to be his wife. Now\nSir Kennington had come in his way, and he by no means carried\nhis modesty so far as to abstain from quarrelling with him. Sir\nKennington was a good-looking young aristocrat, with plenty of words,\nbut nothing special to say for himself. He was conspicuous for his\ncricketing finery, and when got up to take his place at the wicket,\nlooked like a diver with his diving-armour all on; but Jack said that\nhe was very little good at the game. Indeed, for mere cricket Jack\nswore that the English would be \"nowhere\" but for eight professional\nplayers whom they had brought out with them. It must be explained\nthat our club had no professionals. We had not come to that\nyet,--that a man should earn his bread by playing cricket. Lord\nMarylebone and his friend had brought with them eight professional\n\"slaves,\" as our young men came to call them,--most ungraciously.\nBut each \"slave\" required as much looking after as did the masters,\nand they thought a great deal more of themselves than did the\nnon-professionals.\n\nJack had in truth been attempting to pass Sir Kennington on the\nbicycle track when he had upset poor Sir Lords Longstop; and,\naccording to his own showing, he had more than once allowed Sir\nKennington to start in advance, and had run into Little Christchurch\nbicycle quay before him. This had not given rise to the best feeling,\nand I feared lest there might be an absolute quarrel before the match\nshould have been played. \"I'll punch that fellow's head some of\nthese days,\" Jack said one evening when he came back from Little\nChristchurch.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Impudent puppy! He thinks because he has got an unmeaning handle to\nhis name, that everybody is to come to his whistle. They tell me that\nhis father was made what they call a baronet because he set a broken\narm for one of those twenty royal dukes that England has to pay for.\"\n\n\"Who has had to come to his whistle now?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"He went over with his steam curricle, and sent to ask Eva whether\nshe would not take a drive with him on the cliffs.\"\n\n\"She needn't have gone unless she wished it,\" I said.\n\n\"But she did go; and there she was with him for a couple of hours.\nHe's the most unmeaning upstart of a puppy I ever met. He has not\nthree ideas in the world. I shall tell Eva what I think about him.\"\n\nThe quarrel went on during the whole period of preparation, till it\nseemed as though Gladstonopolis had nothing else to talk about. Eva's\nname was in every one's mouth, till my wife was nearly beside herself\nwith anger. \"A girl,\" said she, \"shouldn't get herself talked about\nin that way by every one all round. I don't suppose the man intends\nto marry her.\"\n\n\"I can't see why he shouldn't,\" I replied.\n\n\"She's nothing more to him than a pretty provincial lass. What would\nshe be in London?\"\n\n\"Why should not Mr Crasweller's daughter be as much admired in London\nas here?\" I answered. \"Beauty is the same all the world over, and her\nmoney will be thought of quite as much there as here.\"\n\n\"But she will have such a spot upon her.\"\n\n\"Spot! What spot?\"\n\n\"As the daughter of the first deposited of the Fixed Period\npeople,--if ever that comes off. Or if it don't, she'll be talked\nabout as her who was to be. I don't suppose any Englishman will think\nof marrying her.\"\n\nThis made me very angry. \"What!\" I said. \"Do you, a Britannulist\nand my wife, intend to turn the special glory of Britannula to the\ndisgrace of her people? That which we should be ready to claim as\nthe highest honour,--as being an advance in progress and general\ncivilisation never hitherto even thought of among other people,--to\nhave conceived that, and to have prepared it, in every detail for\nperfect consummation,--that is to be accounted as an opprobrium to\nour children, by you, the Lady President of the Republic! Have you\nno love of country, no patriotism, no feeling at any rate of what\nhas been done for the world's welfare by your own family?\" I own\nI did feel vexed when she spoke of Eva as having been as it were\ncontaminated by being a Britannulist, because of the law enacting the\nFixed Period.\n\n\"She'd better face it out at home than go across the world to hear\nwhat other people say of us. It may be all very well as far as state\nwisdom goes; but the world isn't ripe for it, and we shall only be\nlaughed at.\"\n\nThere was truth in this, and a certain amount of concession had also\nbeen made. I can fancy that an easy-going butterfly should laugh\nat the painful industry of the ant; and I should think much of the\nbutterfly who should own that he was only a butterfly because it was\nthe age of butterflies. \"The few wise,\" said I, \"have ever been the\nlaughing-stock of silly crowds.\"\n\n\"But Eva isn't one of the wise,\" she replied, \"and would be laughed\nat without having any of your philosophy to support her. However, I\ndon't suppose the man is thinking of it.\"\n\nBut the young man was thinking of it; and had so far made up his mind\nbefore he went as to ask Eva to marry him out of hand and return with\nhim to England. We heard of it when the time came, and heard also\nthat Eva had declared that she could not make up her mind so quickly.\nThat was what was said when the time drew near for the departure\nof the yacht. But we did not hear it direct from Eva, nor yet from\nCrasweller. All these tidings came to us from Jack, and Jack was in\nthis instance somewhat led astray.\n\nTime passed on, and the practice on the Little Christchurch ground\nwas continued. Several accidents happened, but the cricketers took\nvery little account of these. Jack had his cheek cut open by a ball\nrunning off his bat on to his face; and Eva, who saw the accident,\nwas carried fainting into the house. Sir Kennington behaved\nadmirably, and himself brought him home in his curricle. We were\ntold afterwards that this was done at Eva's directions, because old\nCrasweller would have been uncomfortable with the boy in his house,\nseeing that he could not in his present circumstances receive me or\nmy wife. Mrs Neverbend swore a solemn oath that Jack should be made\nto abandon his cricket; but Jack was playing again the next day, with\nhis face strapped up athwart and across with republican black-silk\nadhesive. When I saw Bobbs at work over him I thought that one side\nof his face was gone, and that his eye would be dreadfully out of\nplace. \"All his chance of marrying Eva is gone,\" said I to my wife.\n\"The nasty little selfish slut!\" said Mrs Neverbend. But at two\nthe next day Jack had been patched up, and nothing could keep him\nfrom Little Christchurch. Bobbs was with him the whole morning, and\nassured his mother that if he could go out and take exercise his\neye would be all right. His mother offered to take a walk with him\nin the city park; but Bobbs declared that violent exercise would\nbe necessary to keep the eye in its right place, and Jack was at\nLittle Christchurch manipulating his steam-bowler in the afternoon.\nAfterwards Littlebat, one of the English professionals, had his leg\nbroken, and was necessarily laid on one side; and young Grundle was\nhurt on the lower part of the back, and never showed himself again\non the scene of danger. \"My life is too precious in the Assembly\njust at present,\" he said to me, excusing himself. He alluded to\nthe Fixed Period debate, which he knew would be renewed as soon as\nthe cricketers were gone. I no doubt depended very much on Abraham\nGrundle, and assented. The match was afterwards carried on with\nfifteen on each side; for though each party had spare players, they\ncould not agree as to the use of them. Our next man was better than\ntheirs, they said, and they were anxious that we should take our\nsecond best, to which our men would not agree. Therefore the game was\nultimately played with thirty combatants.\n\n\"So one of our lot is to come back for a wife, almost immediately,\"\nsaid Lord Marylebone at our table the day before the match was to be\nplayed.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, my lord!\" said Mrs Neverbend. \"I am glad to find that a\nBritannulan young lady has been so effective. Who is the gentleman?\"\nIt was easy to see by my wife's face, and to know by her tone of\nvoice, that she was much disturbed by the news.\n\n\"Sir Kennington,\" said Lord Marylebone. \"I supposed you had all heard\nof it.\" Of course we had all heard of it; but Lord Marylebone did not\nknow what had been Mrs Neverbend's wishes for her own son.\n\n\"We did know that Sir Kennington had been very attentive, but there\nis no knowing what that means from you foreign gentlemen. It's a pity\nthat poor Eva, who is a good girl in her way, should have her head\nturned.\" This came from my wife.\n\n\"It's Oval's head that is turned,\" continued his lordship; \"I never\nsaw a man so bowled over in my life. He's awfully in love with her.\"\n\n\"What will his friends say at home?\" asked Mrs Neverbend.\n\n\"We understand that Miss Crasweller is to have a large fortune;\neight or ten thousand a-year at the least. I should imagine that\nshe will be received with open arms by all the Ovals; and as for a\nforeigner,--we don't call you foreigners.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said I, rather anxious to prove that we were foreigners.\n\"What makes a foreigner but a different allegiance? Do we not call\nthe Americans foreigners?\" Great Britain and France had been for\nyears engaged in the great maritime contest with the united fleets\nof Russia and America, and had only just made that glorious peace by\nwhich, as politicians said, all the world was to be governed for the\nfuture; and after that, it need not be doubted but that the Americans\nwere foreign to the English;--and if the Americans, why not the\nBritannulists? We had separated ourselves from Great Britain, without\ncoming to blows indeed; but still our own flag, the Southern Cross,\nflew as proudly to our gentle breezes as ever had done the Union-jack\namidst the inclemency of a British winter. It was the flag of\nBritannula, with which Great Britain had no concern. At the present\nmoment I was specially anxious to hear a distinguished Englishman\nlike Lord Marylebone acknowledge that we were foreigners. \"If we be\nnot foreigners, what are we, my lord?\"\n\n\"Englishmen, of course,\" said he. \"What else? Don't you talk\nEnglish?\"\n\n\"So do the Americans, my lord,\" said I, with a smile that was\nintended to be gracious. \"Our language is spreading itself over the\nworld, and is no sign of nationality.\"\n\n\"What laws do you obey?\"\n\n\"English,--till we choose to repeal them. You are aware that we have\nalready freed ourselves from the stain of capital punishment.\"\n\n\"Those coins pass in your market-places?\" Then he brought out a gold\npiece from his waistcoat-pocket, and slapped it down on the table.\nIt was one of those pounds which the people will continue to call\nsovereigns, although the name has been made actually illegal for the\nrendering of all accounts. \"Whose is this image and superscription?\"\nhe asked. \"And yet this was paid to me to-day at one of your banks,\nand the lady cashier asked me whether I would take sovereigns. How\nwill you get over that, Mr President?\"\n\nA small people,--numerically small,--cannot of course do everything\nat once. We have been a little slack perhaps in instituting a\nnational mint. In fact there was a difficulty about the utensil by\nwhich we would have clapped a Southern Cross over the British arms,\nand put the portrait of the Britannulan President of the day,--mine\nfor instance,--in the place where the face of the British monarch has\nhitherto held its own. I have never pushed the question much, lest\nI should seem, as have done some presidents, over anxious to exhibit\nmyself. I have ever thought more of the glory of our race than of\nputting forward my own individual self,--as may be seen by the whole\nhistory of the college. \"I will not attempt to get over it,\" I said;\n\"but according to my ideas, a nation does not depend on the small\nexternal accidents of its coin or its language.\"\n\n\"But on the flag which it flies. After all, a bit of bunting is\neasy.\"\n\n\"Nor on its flag, Lord Marylebone, but on the hearts of its people.\nWe separated from the old mother country with no quarrel, with no\nill-will; but with the mutual friendly wishes of both. If there be\na trace of the feeling of antagonism in the word foreigners, I will\nnot use it; but British subjects we are not, and never can be again.\"\nThis I said because I felt that there was creeping up, as it were in\nthe very atmosphere, a feeling that England should be again asked\nto annex us, so as to save our old people from the wise decision to\nwhich our own Assembly had come. Oh for an adamantine law to protect\nthe human race from the imbecility, the weakness, the discontent,\nand the extravagance of old age! Lord Marylebone, who saw that I\nwas in earnest, and who was the most courteous of gentlemen, changed\nthe conversation. I had already observed that he never spoke about\nthe Fixed Period in our house, though, in the condition in which the\ncommunity then was, he must have heard it discussed elsewhere.\n\nThe day for the match had come. Jack's face was so nearly healed that\nMrs Neverbend had been brought to believe entirely in the efficacy of\nviolent exercise for cuts and bruises. Grundle's back was still bad,\nand the poor fellow with the broken leg could only be wheeled out in\nfront of the verandah to look at the proceedings through one of those\nwonderful little glasses which enable the critic to see every motion\nof the players at half-a-mile's distance. He assured me that the\nprecision with which Jack set his steam-bowler was equal to that of\none of those Shoeburyness gunners who can hit a sparrow as far as\nthey can see him, on condition only that they know the precise age of\nthe bird. I gave Jack great credit in my own mind, because I felt\nthat at the moment he was much down at heart. On the preceding day\nSir Kennington had been driving Eva about in his curricle, and Jack\nhad returned home tearing his hair. \"They do it on purpose to put him\noff his play,\" said his mother. But if so, they hadn't known Jack.\nNor indeed had I quite known him up to this time.\n\nI was bound myself to see the game, because a special tent and a\nspecial glass had been prepared for the President. Crasweller walked\nby as I took my place, but he only shook his head sadly and was\nsilent. It now wanted but four months to his deposition. Though there\nwas a strong party in his favour, I do not know that he meddled much\nwith it. I did hear from different sources that he still continued to\nassert that he was only nine years my senior, by which he intended to\ngain the favour of a postponement of his term by twelve poor months;\nbut I do not think that he ever lent himself to the other party.\nUnder my auspices he had always voted for the Fixed Period, and he\ncould hardly oppose it now in theory. They tossed for the first\ninnings, and the English club won it. It was all England against\nBritannula! Think of the population of the two countries. We had,\nhowever, been taught to believe that no community ever played cricket\nas did the Britannulans. The English went in first, with the two\nbaronets at the wickets. They looked like two stout Minervas with\nhuge wicker helmets. I know a picture of the goddess, all helmet,\nspear, and petticoats, carrying her spear over her shoulder as she\nflies through the air over the cities of the earth. Sir Kennington\ndid not fly, but in other respects he was very like the goddess,\nso completely enveloped was he in his india-rubber guards, and so\nwonderful was the machine upon his head, by which his brain and\nfeatures were to be protected.\n\nAs he took his place upon the ground there was great cheering. Then\nthe steam-bowler was ridden into its place by the attendant engineer,\nand Jack began his work. I could see the colour come and go in his\nface as he carefully placed the ball and peeped down to get its\nbearing. It seemed to me as though he were taking infinite care to\nlevel it straight and even at Sir Kennington's head. I was told\nafterwards that he never looked at Sir Kennington, but that, having\ncalculated his distance by means of a quicksilver levelling-glass,\nhis object was to throw the ball on a certain inch of turf, from\nwhich it might shoot into the wicket at such a degree as to make\nit very difficult for Sir Kennington to know what to do with it.\nIt seemed to me to take a long time, during which the fourteen men\naround all looked as though each man were intending to hop off to\nsome other spot than that on which he was standing. There used, I am\ntold, to be only eleven of these men; but now, in a great match, the\nlong-offs, and the long-ons, and the rest of them, are all doubled.\nThe double long-off was at such a distance that, he being a small\nman, I could only just see him through the field-glass which I kept\nin my waistcoat-pocket. When I had been looking hard at them for\nwhat seemed to be a quarter of an hour, and the men were apparently\nbecoming tired of their continual hop, and when Jack had stooped\nand kneeled and sprawled, with one eye shut, in every conceivable\nattitude, on a sudden there came a sharp snap, a little smoke, and\nlo, Sir Kennington Oval was--out!\n\nThere was no doubt about it. I myself saw the two bails fly away\ninto infinite space, and at once there was a sound of kettle-drums,\ntrumpets, fifes, and clarionets. It seemed as though all the loud\nmusic of the town band had struck up at the moment with their\nshrillest notes. And a huge gun was let off.\n\n\n   \"And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\n    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,\n    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth.\n    Now drinks the king to Hamlet.\"\n\n\nI could not but fancy, at these great signs of success, that I was\nHamlet's father.\n\nSir Kennington Oval was out,--out at the very first ball. There\ncould be no doubt about it, and Jack's triumph was complete. It was\nmelancholy to see the English Minerva, as he again shouldered his\nspear and walked back to his tent. In spite of Jack's good play, and\nthe success on the part of my own countrymen, I could not but be\nsorry to think that the young baronet had come half round the world\nto be put out at the first ball. There was a cruelty in it,--an\ninhospitality,--which, in spite of the exigencies of the game, went\nagainst the grain. Then, when the shouting, and the holloaing, and\nthe flinging up of the ball were still going on, I remembered that,\nafter it, he would have his consolation with Eva. And poor Jack,\nwhen his short triumph was over, would have to reflect that, though\nfortunate in his cricket, he was unhappy in his love. As this\noccurred to me, I looked back towards the house, and there, from a\nlittle lattice window at the end of the verandah, I saw a lady's\nhandkerchief waving. Could it be that Eva was waving it so as to\ncomfort her vanquished British lover? In the meantime Minerva went\nto his tent, and hid himself among sympathetic friends; and I was\ntold afterwards that he was allowed half a pint of bitter beer by\nDr MacNuffery.\n\nAfter twenty minutes spent in what seemed to me the very ostentation\nof success, another man was got to the wickets. This was Stumps,\none of the professionals, who was not quite so much like a Minerva,\nthough he, too, was prodigiously greaved. Jack again set his ball,\nsnap went the machine, and Stumps wriggled his bat. He touched the\nball, and away it flew behind the wicket. Five republican Minervas\nran after it as fast as their legs could carry them; and I was told\nby a gentleman who sat next to me scoring, that a dozen runs had been\nmade. He spent a great deal of time in explaining how, in the old\ntimes, more than six at a time were never scored. Now all this was\naltered. A slight tip counted ever so much more than a good forward\nblow, because the ball went behind the wicket. Up flew on all sides\nof the ground figures to show that Stumps had made a dozen, and two\nBritish clarionets were blown with a great deal of vigour. Stumps was\na thick-set, solid, solemn-looking man, who had been ridiculed by our\nside as being much too old for the game; but he seemed to think very\nlittle of Jack's precise machine. He kept chopping at the ball, which\nalways went behind, till he had made a great score. It was two hours\nbefore Jack had sorely lamed him in the hip, and the umpire had given\nit leg-before-wicket. Indeed it was leg-before-wicket, as the poor\nman felt when he was assisted back to his tent. However, he had\nscored 150. Sir Lords Longstop, too, had run up a good score before\nhe was caught out by the middle long-off,--a marvellous catch they\nall said it was,--and our trumpets were blown for fully five minutes.\nBut the big gun was only fired when a ball was hurled from the\nmachine directly into the wicket.\n\nAt the end of three days the Britishers were all out, and the runs\nwere numbered in four figures. I had my doubts, as I looked at the\ncontest, whether any of them would be left to play out the match. I\nwas informed that I was expected to take the President's seat every\nday; but when I heard that there were to be two innings for each set,\nI positively declined. But Crasweller took my place; and I was told\nthat a gleam of joy shot across his worn, sorrowful face when Sir\nKennington began the second innings with ten runs. Could he really\nwish, in his condition, to send his daughter away to England simply\nthat she might be a baronet's wife?\n\nWhen the Britannulists went in for the second time, they had 1500\nruns to get; and it was said afterwards that Grundle had bet four to\none against his own side. This was thought to be very shabby on his\npart, though if such was the betting, I don't see why he should lose\nhis money by backing his friends. Jack declared in my hearing that\nhe would not put a shilling on. He did not wish either to lose his\nmoney or to bet against himself. But he was considerably disheartened\nwhen he told me that he was not going in on the first day of their\nsecond innings. He had not done much when the Britannulists were in\nbefore,--had only made some thirty or forty runs; and, worse than\nthat, Sir Kennington Oval had scored up to 300. They told me that\nhis Pallas helmet was shaken with tremendous energy as he made his\nrunning. And again, that man Stumps had seemed to be invincible,\nthough still lame, and had carried out his bat with a tremendous\nscore. He trudged away without any sign of triumph; but Jack said\nthat the professional was the best man they had.\n\nOn the second day of our party's second innings,--the last day but\none of the match,--Jack went in. They had only made 150 runs on the\nprevious day, and three wickets were down. Our kettle-drums had had\nbut little opportunity for making themselves heard. Jack was very\ndespondent, and had had some tiff with Eva. He had asked Eva whether\nshe were not going to England, and Eva had said that perhaps she\nmight do so if some Britannulists did not do their duty. Jack had\nchosen to take this as a bit of genuine impertinence, and had been\nvery sore about it. Stumps was bowling from the British catapult,\nand very nearly gave Jack his quietus during the first over. He hit\nwildly, and four balls passed him without touching his wicket. Then\ncame his turn again, and he caught the first ball with his Neverbend\nspring-bat,--for he had invented it himself,--such a swipe, as he\ncalled it, that nobody has ever yet been able to find the ball. The\nstory goes that it went right up to the verandah, and that Eva picked\nit up, and has treasured it ever since.\n\nBe that as it may, during the whole of that day, and the next,\nnobody was able to get him out. There was a continual banging of the\nkettle-drum, which seemed to give him renewed spirits. Every ball as\nit came to him was sent away into infinite space. All the Englishmen\nwere made to retire to further distances from the wickets, and to\nstand about almost at the extremity of the ground. The management of\nthe catapults was intrusted to one man after another,--but in vain.\nThen they sent the catapults away, and tried the old-fashioned slow\nbowling. It was all the same to Jack. He would not be tempted out of\nhis ground, but stood there awaiting the ball, let it come ever so\nslowly. Through the first of the two days he stood before his wicket,\nhitting to the right and the left, till hope seemed to spring up\nagain in the bosom of the Britannulists. And I could see that the\nEnglishmen were becoming nervous and uneasy, although the odds were\nstill much in their favour.\n\nAt the end of the first day Jack had scored above 500;--but eleven\nwickets had gone down, and only three of the most inferior players\nwere left to stand up with him. It was considered that Jack must\nstill make another 500 before the game would be won. This would allow\nonly twenty each to the other three players. \"But,\" said Eva to me\nthat evening, \"they'll never get the twenty each.\"\n\n\"And on which side are you, Eva?\" I inquired with a smile. For in\ntruth I did believe at that moment that she was engaged to the\nbaronet.\n\n\"How dare you ask, Mr Neverbend?\" she demanded, with indignation. \"Am\nnot I a Britannulist as well as you?\" And as she walked away I could\nsee that there was a tear in her eye.\n\nOn the last day feelings were carried to a pitch which was more\nbefitting the last battle of a great war,--some Waterloo of other\nages,--than the finishing of a prolonged game of cricket. Men looked,\nand moved, and talked as though their all were at stake. I cannot\nsay that the Englishmen seemed to hate us, or we them; but that the\naffair was too serious to admit of playful words between the parties.\nAnd those unfortunates who had to stand up with Jack were so afraid\nof themselves that they were like young country orators about to make\ntheir first speeches. Jack was silent, determined, and yet inwardly\nproud of himself, feeling that the whole future success of the\nrepublic was on his shoulders. He ordered himself to be called at a\ncertain hour, and the assistants in our household listened to his\nwords as though feeling that everything depended on their obedience.\nHe would not go out on his bicycle, as fearing that some accident\nmight occur. \"Although, ought I not to wish that I might be struck\ndead?\" he said; \"as then all the world would know that though\nbeaten, it had been by the hand of God, and not by our default.\"\nIt astonished me to find that the boy was quite as eager about his\ncricket as I was about my Fixed Period.\n\nAt eleven o'clock I was in my seat, and on looking round, I could\nsee that all the rank and fashion of Britannula were at the ground.\nBut all the rank and fashion were there for nothing, unless they had\ncome armed with glasses. The spaces required by the cricketers were\nso enormous that otherwise they could not see anything of the play.\nUnder my canopy there was room for five, of which I was supposed\nto be able to fill the middle thrones. On the two others sat those\nwho officially scored the game. One seat had been demanded for Mrs\nNeverbend. \"I will see his fate,--whether it be his glory or his\nfall,\"--said his mother, with true Roman feeling. For the other Eva\nhad asked, and of course it had been awarded to her. When the play\nbegan, Sir Kennington was at the catapult and Jack at the opposite\nwicket, and I could hardly say for which she felt the extreme\ninterest which she certainly did exhibit. I, as the day went on,\nfound myself worked up to such excitement that I could hardly keep my\nhat on my head or behave myself with becoming presidential dignity.\nAt one period, as I shall have to tell, I altogether disgraced\nmyself.\n\nThere seemed to be an opinion that Jack would either show himself\nat once unequal to the occasion, and immediately be put out,--which\nopinion I think that all Gladstonopolis was inclined to hold,--or\nelse that he would get his \"eye in\" as he called it, and go on as\nlong as the three others could keep their bats. I know that his own\nopinion was the same as that general in the city, and I feared that\nhis very caution at the outset would be detrimental to him. The great\nobject on our side was that Jack should, as nearly as possible, be\nalways opposite to the bowler. He was to take the four first balls,\nmaking but one run off the last, and then beginning another over at\nthe opposite end do the same thing again. It was impossible to manage\nthis exactly; but something might be done towards effecting it.\nThere were the three men with whom to work during the day. The first\nunfortunately was soon made to retire; but Jack, who had walked up to\nmy chair during the time allowed for fetching down the next man, told\nme that he had \"got his eye,\" and I could see a settled look of fixed\npurpose in his face. He bowed most gracefully to Eva, who was so\nstirred by emotion that she could not allow herself to speak a word.\n\"Oh Jack, I pray for you; I pray for you,\" said his mother. Jack, I\nfancy, thought more of Eva's silence than of his mother's prayer.\n\nJack went back to his place, and hit the first ball with such energy\nthat he drove it into the other stumps and smashed them to pieces.\nEverybody declared that such a thing had never been before achieved\nat cricket,--and the ball passed on, and eight or ten runs were\nscored. After that Jack seemed to be mad with cricketing power. He\ntook off his greaves, declaring that they impeded his running, and\nthrew away altogether his helmet. \"Oh, Eva, is he not handsome?\"\nsaid his mother, in ecstasy, hanging across my chair. Eva sat quiet\nwithout a sign. It did not become me to say a word, but I did think\nthat he was very handsome;--and I thought also how uncommonly hard\nit would be to hold him if he should chance to win the game. Let\nhim make what orations he might against the Fixed Period, all\nGladstonopolis would follow him if he won this game of cricket for\nthem.\n\nI cannot pretend to describe all the scenes of that day, nor the\ngrowing anxiety of the Englishmen as Jack went on with one hundred\nafter another. He had already scored nearly 1000 when young Grabbe\nwas caught out. Young Grabbe was very popular, because he was so\naltogether unlike his partner Grundle. He was a fine frank fellow,\nand was Jack's great friend. \"I don't mean to say that he can really\nplay cricket,\" Jack had said that morning, speaking with great\nauthority; \"but he is the best fellow in the world, and will do\nexactly what you ask him.\" But he was out now; and Jack, with over\n200 still to make, declared that he gave up the battle almost as\nlost.\n\n\"Don't say that, Mr Neverbend,\" whispered Eva.\n\n\"Ah yes; we're gone coons. Even your sympathy cannot bring us round\nnow. If anything could do it that would!\"\n\n\"In my opinion,\" continued Eva, \"Britannula will never be beaten as\nlong as Mr Neverbend is at the wicket.\"\n\n\"Sir Kennington has been too much for us, I fear,\" said Jack, with a\nforced smile, as he retired.\n\nThere was now but the one hope left. Mr Brittlereed remained, but\nhe was all. Mr Brittlereed was a gentleman who had advanced nearer\nto his Fixed Period than any other of the cricketers. He was nearly\nthirty-five years of age, and was regarded by them all as quite an\nold man. He was supposed to know all the rules of the game, and to\nbe rather quick in keeping the wicket. But Jack had declared that\nmorning that he could not hit a ball in a week of Sundays, \"He\noughtn't to be here,\" Jack had whispered; \"but you know how those\nthings are managed.\" I did not know how those things were managed,\nbut I was sorry that he should be there, as Jack did not seem to want\nhim.\n\nMr Brittlereed now went to his wicket, and was bound to receive the\nfirst ball. This he did; made one run, whereas he might have made\ntwo, and then had to begin the war over. It certainly seemed as\nthough he had done it on purpose. Jack in his passion broke the\nhandle of his spring-bat, and then had half-a-dozen brought to him in\norder that he might choose another. \"It was his favourite bat,\" said\nhis mother, and buried her face in her handkerchief.\n\nI never understood how it was that Mr Brittlereed lived through that\nover; but he did live, although he never once touched the ball. Then\nit came to be Jack's turn, and he at once scored thirty-nine during\nthe over, leaving himself at the proper wicket for re-commencing\nthe operation. I think that this gave him new life. It added, at\nany rate, new fire to every Britannulist on the ground, and I must\nsay that after that Mr Brittlereed managed the matter altogether to\nJack's satisfaction. Over after over Jack went on, and received every\nball that was bowled. They tried their catapult with single, double,\nand even treble action. Sir Kennington did his best, flinging the\nball with his most tremendous impetus, and then just rolling it up\nwith what seemed to me the most provoking languor. It was all the\nsame to Jack. He had in truth got his \"eye in,\" and as surely as the\nball came to him, it was sent away to some most distant part of the\nground. The Britishers were mad with dismay as Jack worked his way on\nthrough the last hundred. It was piteous to see the exertions which\npoor Mr Brittlereed made in running backwards and forwards across the\nground. They tried, I think, to bustle him by the rapid succession of\ntheir bowling. But the only result was that the ball was sent still\nfurther off when it reached Jack's wicket. At last, just as every\nclock upon the ground struck six with that wonderful unanimity which\nour clocks have attained since they were all regulated by wires\nfrom Greenwich, Jack sent a ball flying up into the air, perfectly\nregardless whether it might be caught or not, knowing well that the\none now needed would be scored before it could come down from the\nheavens into the hands of any Englishman. It did come down, and was\ncaught by Stumps, but by that time Britannula had won her victory.\nJack's total score during that innings was 1275. I doubt whether in\nthe annals of cricket any record is made of a better innings than\nthat. Then it was that, with an absence of that presence of mind\nwhich the President of a republic should always remember, I took off\nmy hat and flung it into the air.\n\nJack's triumph would have been complete, only that it was ludicrous\nto those who could not but think, as I did, of the very little matter\nas to which the contest had been raised;--just a game of cricket\nwhich two sets of boys had been playing, and which should have been\nregarded as no more than an amusement,--as a pastime, by which to\nrefresh themselves between their work. But they regarded it as though\na great national combat had been fought, and the Britannulists looked\nupon themselves as though they had been victorious against England.\nIt was absurd to see Jack as he was carried back to Gladstonopolis as\nthe hero of the occasion, and to hear him, as he made his speeches\nat the dinner which was given on the day, and at which he was called\nupon to take the chair. I was glad to see, however, that he was not\nquite so glib with his tongue as he had been when addressing the\npeople. He hesitated a good deal, nay, almost broke down, when he\ngave the health of Sir Kennington Oval and the British sixteen; and I\nwas quite pleased to hear Lord Marylebone declare to his mother that\nhe was \"a wonderfully nice boy.\" I think the English did try to turn\nit off a little, as though they had only come out there just for the\namusement of the voyage. But Grundle, who had now become quite proud\nof his country, and who lamented loudly that he should have received\nso severe an injury in preparing for the game, would not let this\npass. \"My lord,\" he said, \"what is your population?\" Lord Marylebone\nnamed sixty million. \"We are but two hundred and fifty thousand,\"\nsaid Grundle, \"and see what we have done.\" \"We are cocks fighting\non our own dunghill,\" said Jack, \"and that does make a deal of\ndifference.\"\n\nBut I was told that Jack had spoken a word to Eva in quite a\ndifferent spirit before he had left Little Christchurch. \"After all,\nEva, Sir Kennington has not quite trampled us under his feet,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Who thought that he would?\" said Eva. \"My heart has never fainted,\nwhatever some others may have done.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE COLLEGE.\n\n\nI was surprised to see that Jack, who was so bold in playing his\nmatch, and who had been so well able to hold his own against the\nEnglishmen,--who had been made a hero, and had carried off his\nheroism so well,--should have been so shamefaced and bashful in\nregard to Eva. He was like a silly boy, hardly daring to look her\nin the face, instead of the gallant captain of the band who had\ntriumphed over all obstacles. But I perceived, though it seemed that\nhe did not, that she was quite prepared to give herself to him, and\nthat there was no real obstacle between him and all the flocks and\nherds of Little Christchurch. Not much had been seen or heard of\nGrundle during the match, and as far as Eva was concerned, he had\nsuccumbed as soon as Sir Kennington Oval had appeared upon the scene.\nHe had thought so much of the English baronet as to have been cowed\nand quenched by his grandeur. And Sir Kennington himself had, I\nthink, been in earnest before the days of the cricket-match. But\nI could see now that Eva had merely played him off against Jack,\nthinking thereby to induce the younger swain to speak his mind. This\nhad made Jack more than ever intent on beating Sir Kennington, but\nhad not as yet had the effect which Eva had intended. \"It will all\ncome right,\" I said to myself, \"as soon as these Englishmen have left\nthe island.\" But then my mind reverted to the Fixed Period, and to\nthe fast-approaching time for Crasweller's deposition. We were now\nnearly through March, and the thirtieth of June was the day on which\nhe ought to be led to the college. It was my first anxiety to get rid\nof these Englishmen before the subject should be again ventilated.\nI own I was anxious that they should not return to their country\nwith their prejudices strengthened by what they might hear at\nGladstonopolis. If I could only get them to go before the matter was\nagain debated, it might be that no strong public feeling would be\nexcited in England till it was too late. That was my first desire;\nbut then I was also anxious to get rid of Jack for a short time. The\nmore I thought of Eva and the flocks, the more determined was I not\nto allow the personal interests of my boy,--and therefore my own,--to\nclash in any way with the performance of my public duties.\n\nI heard that the Englishmen were not to go till another week had\nelapsed. A week was necessary to recruit their strength and to enable\nthem to pack up their bats and bicycles. Neither, however, were\npacked up till the day before they started; for the track down to\nLittle Christchurch was crowded with them, and they were still\npractising as though another match were contemplated. I was very glad\nto have Lord Marylebone as an inmate in our house, but I acknowledge\nthat I was anxious for him to say something as to his departure. \"We\nhave been very proud to have you here, my lord,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I cannot say that we are very proud,\" he replied, \"because we have\nbeen so awfully licked. Barring that, I never spent a pleasanter two\nmonths in my life, and should not be at all unwilling to stay for\nanother. Your mode of life here seems to me to be quite delightful,\nand we have been thinking so much of our cricket, that I have hardly\nas yet had a moment to look at your institutions. What is all this\nabout the Fixed Period?\" Jack, who was present, put on a serious\nface, and assumed that air of determination which I was beginning\nto fear. Mrs Neverbend pursed up her lips, and said nothing; but\nI knew what was passing through her mind. I managed to turn the\nconversation, but I was aware that I did it very lamely.\n\n\"Jack,\" I said to my son, \"I got a post-card from New Zealand\nyesterday.\" The boats had just begun to run between the two islands\nsix days a-week, and as their regular contract pace was twenty-five\nmiles an hour, it was just an easy day's journey.\n\n\"What said the post-card?\"\n\n\"There's plenty of time for Mount Earnshawe yet. They all say the\nautumn is the best. The snow is now disappearing in great\nquantities.\"\n\nBut an old bird is not to be caught with chaff. Jack was determined\nnot to go to the Eastern Alps this year; and indeed, as I found, not\nto go till this question of the Fixed Period should be settled. I\ntold him that he was a fool. Although he would have been wrong to\nassist in depositing his father-in-law for the sake of getting the\nherd and flocks himself, as Grundle would have done, nevertheless he\nwas hardly bound by any feelings of honour or conscience to keep old\nCrasweller at Little Christchurch in direct opposition to the laws of\nthe land. But all this I could not explain to him, and was obliged\nsimply to take it as a fact that he would not join an Alpine party\nfor Mount Earnshawe this year. As I thought of all this, I almost\nfeared Jack's presence in Gladstonopolis more than that of the young\nEnglishmen.\n\nIt was clear, however, that nothing could be done till the Englishmen\nwere gone, and as I had a day at my disposal I determined to walk up\nto the college and meditate there on the conduct which it would be my\nduty to follow during the next two months. The college was about five\nmiles from the town, at the side opposite to you as you enter the\ntown from Little Christchurch, and I had some time since made up my\nmind how, in the bright genial days of our pleasant winter, I would\nmyself accompany Mr Crasweller through the city in an open barouche\nas I took him to be deposited, through admiring crowds of his\nfellow-citizens. I had not then thought that he would be a recreant,\nor that he would be deterred by the fear of departure from enjoying\nthe honours which would be paid to him. But how different now was\nhis frame of mind from that glorious condition to which I had looked\nforward in my sanguine hopes! Had it been I, I myself, how proud\nshould I have been of my country and its wisdom, had I been led along\nas a first hero, to anticipate the euthanasia prepared for me! As\nit was, I hired an inside cab, and hiding myself in the corner, was\ncarried away to the college unseen by any.\n\nThe place was called Necropolis. The name had always been distasteful\nto me, as I had never wished to join with it the feeling of death.\nVarious names had been proposed for the site. Young Grundle had\nsuggested Cremation Hall, because such was the ultimate end to which\nthe mere husks and hulls of the citizens were destined. But there was\nsomething undignified in the sound,--as though we were talking of a\ndancing saloon or a music hall,--and I would have none of it. My idea\nwas to give to the mind some notion of an approach to good things to\ncome, and I proposed to call the place \"Aditus.\" But men said that\nit was unmeaning, and declared that Britannulists should never be\nashamed to own the truth. Necropolis sounded well, they said, and\nargued that though no actual remains of the body might be left there,\nstill the tablets would remain. Therefore Necropolis it was called. I\nhad hoped that a smiling hamlet might grow up at the gate, inhabited\nby those who would administer to the wants of the deposited; but I\nhad forgot that the deposited must come first. The hamlet had not\nyet built itself, and round the handsome gates there was nothing at\npresent but a desert. While land in Britannula was plenty, no one had\ncared to select ground so near to those awful furnaces by which the\nmortal clay should be transported into the air. From the gates up to\nthe temple which stood in the middle of the grounds,--that temple\nin which the last scene of life was to be encountered,--there ran a\nbroad gravel path, which was intended to become a beautiful avenue.\nIt was at present planted alternately with eucalypti and ilexes--the\ngum-trees for the present generation, and the green-oaks for those\nto come; but even the gum-trees had not as yet done much to give a\nfurnished appearance to the place. Some had demanded that cedars and\nyew-trees should be placed there, and I had been at great pains to\nexplain to them that our object should be to make the spot cheerful,\nrather than sad. Round the temple, at the back of it, were the sets\nof chambers in which were to live the deposited during their year of\nprobation. Some of these were very handsome, and were made so, no\ndoubt, with a view of alluring the first comers. In preparing wisdom\nfor babes, it is necessary to wrap up its precepts in candied sweets.\nBut, though handsome, they were at present anything but pleasant\nabodes. Not one of them had as yet been inhabited. As I looked at\nthem, knowing Crasweller as well as I did, I almost ceased to wonder\nat his timidity. A hero was wanted; but Crasweller was no hero. Then\nfurther off, but still in the circle round the temple, there were\nsmaller abodes, less luxurious, but still comfortable, all of which\nwould in a few short years be inhabited,--if the Fixed Period could\nbe carried out in accordance with my project. And foundations had\nbeen made for others still smaller,--for a whole township of old men\nand women, as in the course of the next thirty years they might come\nhurrying on to find their last abode in the college. I had already\nselected one, not by any means the finest or the largest, for myself\nand my wife, in which we might prepare ourselves for the grand\ndeparture. But as for Mrs Neverbend, nothing would bring her to\nset foot within the precincts of the college ground. \"Before those\nnext ten years are gone,\" she would say, \"common-sense will have\ninterfered to let folks live out their lives properly.\" It had been\nquite useless for me to attempt to make her understand how unfitting\nwas such a speech for the wife of the President of the Republic. My\nwife's opposition had been an annoyance to me from the first, but I\nhad consoled myself by thinking how impossible it always is to imbue\na woman's mind with a logical idea. And though, in all respects of\ndomestic life, Mrs Neverbend is the best of women, even among women\nshe is the most illogical.\n\nI now inspected the buildings in a sad frame of mind, asking myself\nwhether it would ever come to pass that they should be inhabited for\ntheir intended purpose. When the Assembly, in compliance with my\nadvice, had first enacted the law of the Fixed Period, a large sum\nhad been voted for these buildings. As the enthusiasm had worn off,\nmen had asked themselves whether the money had not been wasted, and\nhad said that for so small a community the college had been planned\non an absurdly grand scale. Still I had gone on, and had watched\nthem as they grew from day to day, and had allowed no shilling to\nbe spared in perfecting them. In my earlier years I had been very\nsuccessful in the wool trade, and had amassed what men called a large\nfortune. During the last two or three years I had devoted a great\nportion of this to the external adornment of the college, not without\nmany words on the matter from Mrs Neverbend. \"Jack is to be ruined,\"\nshe had said, \"in order that all the old men and women may be killed\nartistically.\" This and other remarks of the kind I was doomed to\nbear. It was a part of the difficulty which, as a great reformer, I\nmust endure. But now, as I walked mournfully among the disconsolate\nand half-finished buildings, I could not but ask myself as to the\npurpose to which my money had been devoted. And I could not but\ntell myself that if in coming years these tenements should be left\ntenantless, my country would look back upon me as one who had wasted\nthe produce of her young energies. But again I bethought me of\nColumbus and Galileo, and swore that I would go on or perish in the\nattempt.\n\nAs these painful thoughts were agitating my mind, a slow decrepit old\ngentleman came up to me and greeted me as Mr President. He linked his\narm familiarly through mine, and remarked that the time seemed to be\nvery long before the college received any of its inhabitants. This\nwas Mr Graybody, the curator, who had been specially appointed to\noccupy a certain residence, to look after the grounds, and to keep\nthe books of the establishment. Graybody and I had come as young men\nto Britannula together, and whereas I had succeeded in all my own\nindividual attempts, he had unfortunately failed. He was exactly of\nmy age, as was also his wife. But under the stress of misfortune they\nhad both become unnaturally old, and had at last been left ruined\nand hopeless, without a shilling on which to depend. I had always\nbeen a sincere friend to Graybody, though he was, indeed, a man very\ndifficult to befriend. On most subjects he thought as I did, if he\ncan be said to have thought at all. At any rate he had agreed with me\nas to the Fixed Period, saying how good it would be if he could be\ndeposited at fifty-eight, and had always declared how blessed must\nbe the time when it should have come for himself and his old wife.\nI do not think that he ever looked much to the principle which I had\nin view. He had no great ideas as to the imbecility and weakness of\nhuman life when protracted beyond its fitting limits. He only felt\nthat it would be good to give up; and that if he did so, others might\nbe made to do so too. As soon as a residence at the college was\ncompleted, I asked him to fill it; and now he had been living there,\nhe and his wife together, with an attendant, and drawing his salary\nas curator for the last three years. I thought that it would be the\nvery place for him. He was usually melancholy, disheartened, and\nimpoverished; but he was always glad to see me, and I was accustomed\nto go frequently to the college, in order to find a sympathetic soul\nwith whom to converse about the future of the establishment. \"Well,\nGraybody,\" I said, \"I suppose we are nearly ready for the first\ncomer.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; we're always ready; but then the first comer is not.\" I\nhad not said much to him during the latter months as to Crasweller,\nin particular. His name used formerly to be very ready in all my\nconversations with Graybody, but of late I had talked to him in\na more general tone. \"You can't tell me yet when it's to be, Mr\nPresident? We do find it a little dull here.\"\n\nNow he knew as well as I did the day and the year of Crasweller's\nbirth. I had intended to speak to him about Crasweller, but I wished\nour friend's name to come first from him. \"I suppose it will be some\ntime about mid-winter,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know whether it might not have been postponed.\"\n\n\"How can it be postponed? As years creep on, you cannot postpone\ntheir step. If there might be postponement such as that, I doubt\nwhether we should ever find the time for our inhabitants to come. No,\nGraybody; there can be no postponement for the Fixed Period.\"\n\n\"It might have been made sixty-nine or seventy,\" said he.\n\n\"Originally, no doubt. But the wisdom of the Assembly has settled all\nthat. The Assembly has declared that they in Britannula who are left\nalive at sixty-seven shall on that day be brought into the college.\nYou yourself have, I think, ten years to run, and you will not be\nmuch longer left to pass them in solitude.\"\n\n\"It is weary being here all alone, I must confess. Mrs G. says that\nshe could not bear it for another twelve months. The girl we have has\ngiven us notice, and she is the ninth within a year. No followers\nwill come after them here, because they say they'll smell the dead\nbodies.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" I exclaimed, angrily; \"positive rubbish! The actual clay\nwill evaporate into the air, without leaving a trace either for the\neye to see or the nose to smell.\"\n\n\"They all say that when you tried the furnaces there was a savour of\nburnt pork.\" Now great trouble was taken in that matter of cremation;\nand having obtained from Europe and the States all the best machinery\nfor the purpose, I had supplied four immense hogs, in order that\nthe system might be fairly tested, and I had fattened them for the\npurpose, as old men are not unusually very stout. These we consumed\nin the furnaces all at the same time, and the four bodies had been\ndissolved into their original atoms without leaving a trace behind\nthem by which their former condition of life might be recognised.\nBut a trap-door in certain of the chimneys had been left open by\naccident,--either that or by an enemy on purpose,--and undoubtedly\nsome slight flavour of the pig had been allowed to escape. I had been\nthere on the spot, knowing that I could trust only my own senses,\nand was able to declare that the scent which had escaped was very\nslight, and by no means disagreeable. And I was able to show that\nthe trap-door had been left open either by chance or by design,--the\nvery trap-door which was intended to prevent any such escape during\nthe moments of full cremation,--so that there need be no fear of a\nrepetition of the accident. I ought, indeed, to have supplied four\nother hogs, and to have tried the experiment again. But the theme was\ndisagreeable, and I thought that the trial had been so far successful\nas to make it unnecessary that the expense should be again incurred.\n\"They say that men and women would not have quite the same smell,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"How do they know that?\" I exclaimed, in my anger. \"How do they know\nwhat men and women will smell like? They haven't tried. There won't\nbe any smell at all--not the least; and the smoke will all consume\nitself, so that even you, living just where you are, will not know\nwhen cremation is going on. We might consume all Gladstonopolis, as\nI hope we shall some day, and not a living soul would know anything\nabout it. But the prejudices of the citizens are ever the\nstumbling-blocks of civilisation.\"\n\n\"At any rate, Mrs G. tells me that Jemima is going, because none of\nthe young men will come up and see her.\"\n\nThis was another difficulty, but a small one, and I made up my mind\nthat it should be overcome. \"The shrubs seem to grow very well,\" I\nsaid, resolved to appear as cheerful as possible.\n\n\"They're pretty nearly all alive,\" said Graybody; \"and they do give\nthe place just an appearance like the cemetery at Old Christchurch.\"\nHe meant the capital in the province of Canterbury.\n\n\"In the course of a few years you will be quite--cheerful here.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about that, Mr President. I'm not sure that for\nmyself I want to be cheerful anywhere. If I've only got somebody just\nto speak to sometimes, that will be quite enough for me. I suppose\nold Crasweller will be the first?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"It will be a gruesome time when I have to go to bed early, so as not\nto see the smoke come out of his chimney.\"\n\n\"I tell you there will be nothing of the kind. I don't suppose you\nwill even know when they're going to cremate him.\"\n\n\"He will be the first, Mr President; and no doubt he will be looked\nclosely after. Old Barnes will be here by that time, won't he, sir?\"\n\n\"Barnes is the second, and he will come just three months before\nCrasweller's departure. But Tallowax, the grocer in High Street, will\nbe up here by that time. And then they will come so quickly, that\nwe must soon see to get other lodgings finished. Exors, the lawyer,\nwill be the fourth; but he will not come in till a day or two after\nCrasweller's departure.\"\n\n\"They all will come; won't they, sir?\" asked Graybody.\n\n\"Will come! Why, they must. It is the law.\"\n\n\"Tallowax swears he'll have himself strapped to his own kitchen\ntable, and defend himself to the last gasp with a carving-knife.\nExors says that the law is bad, and you can't touch him. As for\nBarnes, he has gone out of what little wits he ever had with the\nfright of it, and people seem to think that you couldn't touch a\nlunatic.\"\n\n\"Barnes is no more a lunatic than I am.\"\n\n\"I only tell you what folk tell me. I suppose you'll try it on by\nforce, if necessary. You never expected that people would come and\ndeposit themselves of their own accord.\"\n\n\"The National Assembly expects that the citizens of Britannula will\nobey the law.\"\n\n\"But there was one question I was going to ask, Mr President. Of\ncourse I am altogether on your side, and do not wish to raise\ndifficulties. But what shall I do suppose they take to running away\nafter they have been deposited? If old Crasweller goes off in his\nsteam-carriage, how am I to go after him, and whom am I to ask to\nhelp to bring him back again?\"\n\nI was puzzled, but I did not care to show it. No doubt a hundred\nlittle arrangements would be necessary before the affairs of the\ninstitution could be got into a groove so as to run steadily. But our\nfirst object must be to deposit Crasweller and Barnes and Tallowax,\nso that the citizens should be accustomed to the fashion of\ndepositing the aged. There were, as I knew, two or three old women\nliving in various parts of the island, who would, in due course, come\nin towards the end of Crasweller's year. But it had been rumoured\nthat they had already begun to invent falsehoods as to their age,\nand I was aware that we might be led astray by them. This I had been\nprepared to accept as being unavoidable; but now, as the time grew\nnearer, I could not but see how difficult it would be to enforce the\nlaw against well-known men, and how easy to allow the women to escape\nby the help of falsehood. Exors, the lawyer, would say at once that\nwe did not even attempt to carry out the law; and Barnes, lunatic as\nhe pretended to be, would be very hard to manage. My mind misgave me\nas I thought of all these obstructions, and I felt that I could so\nwillingly deposit myself at once, and then depart without waiting\nfor my year of probation. But it was necessary that I should show a\ndetermined front to old Graybody, and make him feel that I at any\nrate was determined to remain firm to my purpose. \"Mr Crasweller will\ngive you no such trouble as you suggest,\" said I.\n\n\"Perhaps he has come round.\"\n\n\"He is a gentleman whom we have both known intimately for many years,\nand he has always been a friend to the Fixed Period. I believe that\nhe is so still, although there is some little hitch as to the exact\ntime at which he should be deposited.\"\n\n\"Just twelve months, he says.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, \"the difference would be sure to be that of\none year. He seems to think that there are only nine years between\nhim and me.\"\n\n\"Ten, Mr President; ten. I know the time well.\"\n\n\"I had always thought so; but I should be willing to abandon a year\nif I could make things run smooth by doing so. But all that is a\ndetail with which up here we need not, perhaps, concern ourselves.\"\n\n\"Only the time is getting very short, Mr President, and my old woman\nwill break down altogether if she's told that she's to live another\nyear all alone. Crasweller won't be a bit readier next year than he\nis this; and of course if he is let off, you must let off Barnes and\nTallowax. And there are a lot of old women about who are beginning\nto tell terrible lies about their ages. Do think of it all, Mr\nPresident.\"\n\nI never thought of anything else, so full was my mind of the subject.\nWhen I woke in the morning, before I could face the light of day, it\nwas necessary that I should fortify myself with Columbus and Galileo.\nI began to fancy, as the danger became nearer and still nearer, that\nneither of those great men had been surrounded by obstructions such\nas encompassed me. To plough on across the waves, and either to be\ndrowned or succeed; to tell a new truth about the heavens, and either\nto perish or become great for ever!--either was within the compass\nof a man who had only his own life to risk. My life,--how willingly\ncould I run any risk, did but the question arise of risking it! How\noften I felt, in these days, that there is a fortitude needed by\nman much greater than that of jeopardising his life! Life! what\nis it? Here was that poor Crasweller, belying himself and all his\nconvictions just to gain one year more of it, and then when the year\nwas gone he would still have his deposition before him! Is it not so\nwith us all? For me I feel,--have felt for years,--tempted to rush\non, and pass through the gates of death. That man should shudder at\nthe thought of it does not appear amiss to me. The unknown future\nis always awful; and the unknown future of another world, to be\napproached by so great a change of circumstances,--by the loss of our\nvery flesh and blood and body itself,--has in it something so fearful\nto the imagination that the man who thinks of it cannot but be struck\nwith horror as he acknowledges that by himself too it has to be\nencountered. But it has to be encountered; and though the change be\nawful, it should not therefore, by the sane judgment, be taken as a\nchange necessarily for the worst. Knowing the great goodness of the\nAlmighty, should we not be prepared to accept it as a change probably\nfor the better; as an alteration of our circumstances, by which our\ncondition may be immeasurably improved? Then one is driven back to\nconsider the circumstances by which such change may be effected.\nTo me it seems rational to suppose that as we leave this body so\nshall we enter that new phase of life in which we are destined to\nlive;--but with all our higher resolves somewhat sharpened, and with\nour lower passions, alas! made stronger also. That theory by which a\nhuman being shall jump at once to a perfection of bliss, or fall to\nan eternity of evil and misery, has never found credence with me. For\nmyself, I have to say that, while acknowledging my many drawbacks,\nI have so lived as to endeavour to do good to others, rather than\nevil, and that therefore I look to my departure from this world with\nawe indeed, but still with satisfaction. But I cannot look with\nsatisfaction to a condition of life in which, from my own imbecility,\nI must necessarily retrograde into selfishness. It may be that He who\njudges of us with a wisdom which I cannot approach, shall take all\nthis into account, and that He shall so mould my future being as\nto fit it to the best at which I had arrived in this world; still\nI cannot but fear that a taint of that selfishness which I have\nhitherto avoided, but which will come if I allow myself to become\nold, may remain, and that it will be better for me that I should go\nhence while as yet my own poor wants are not altogether uppermost in\nmy mind. But then, in arranging this matter, I am arranging it for\nmy fellow-citizens, and not for myself. I have to endeavour to think\nhow Crasweller's mind may be affected rather than my own. He dreads\nhis departure with a trembling, currish fear; and I should hardly be\ndoing good to him were I to force him to depart in a frame of mind\nso poor and piteous. But then, again, neither is it altogether\nof Crasweller that I must think,--not of Crasweller or of myself.\nHow will the coming ages of men be affected by such a change as I\npropose, should such a change become the normal condition of Death?\nCan it not be brought about that men should arrange for their own\ndeparture, so as to fall into no senile weakness, no slippered\nselfishness, no ugly whinings of undefined want, before they shall\ngo hence, and be no more thought of? These are the ideas that have\nactuated me, and to them I have been brought by seeing the conduct\nof those around me. Not for Crasweller, or Barnes, or Tallowax, will\nthis thing be good,--nor for those old women who are already lying\nabout their ages in their cottages,--nor for myself, who am, I know,\ntoo apt to boast of myself, that even though old age should come upon\nme, I may be able to avoid the worst of its effects; but for those\nuntold generations to come, whose lives may be modelled for them\nunder the knowledge that at a certain Fixed Period they shall depart\nhence with all circumstances of honour and glory.\n\nI was, however, quite aware that it would be useless to spend my\nenergy in dilating on this to Mr Graybody. He simply was willing to\nshuffle off his mortal coil, because he found it uncomfortable in\nthe wearing. In all likelihood, had his time come as nigh as that of\nCrasweller, he too, like Crasweller, would impotently implore the\ngrace of another year. He would ape madness like Barnes, or arm\nhimself with a carving-knife like Tallowax, or swear that there\nwas a flaw in the law, as Exors was disposed to do. He too would\nclamorously swear that he was much younger, as did the old women.\nWas not the world peopled by Craswellers, Tallowaxes, Exorses, and\nold women? Had I a right to hope to alter the feelings which nature\nherself had implanted in the minds of men? But still it might be done\nby practice,--by practice; if only we could arrive at the time in\nwhich practice should have become practice. Then, as I was about to\ndepart from the door of Graybody's house, I whispered to myself again\nthe names of Galileo and Columbus.\n\n\"You think that he will come on the thirtieth?\" said Graybody, as he\ntook my hand at parting.\n\n\"I think,\" replied I, \"that you and I, as loyal citizens of the\nRepublic, are bound to suppose that he will do his duty as a\ncitizen.\" Then I went, leaving him standing in doubt at his door.\n\n\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nCOLUMBUS AND GALILEO.\n\n\nI had left Graybody with a lie on my tongue. I said that I was bound\nto suppose that Crasweller would do his duty as a citizen,--by which\nI had meant Graybody to understand that I expected my old friend to\nsubmit to deposition. Now I expected nothing of the kind, and it\ngrieved me to think that I should be driven to such false excuses.\nI began to doubt whether my mind would hold its proper bent under\nthe strain thus laid upon it, and to ask myself whether I was in all\nrespects sane in entertaining the ideas which filled my mind. Galileo\nand Columbus,--Galileo and Columbus! I endeavoured to comfort myself\nwith these names,--but in a vain, delusive manner; and though I used\nthem constantly, I was beginning absolutely to hate them. Why could\nI not return to my wool-shed, and be contented among my bales, and\nmy ships, and my credits, as I was of yore, before this theory took\ntotal possession of me? I was doing good then. I robbed no one. I\nassisted very many in their walks of life. I was happy in the praises\nof all my fellow-citizens. My health was good, and I had ample scope\nfor my energies then, even as now. But there came on me a day of\nsuccess,--a day, shall I say, of glory or of wretchedness? or shall\nI not most truly say of both?--and I persuaded my fellow-citizens to\nundertake this sad work of the Fixed Period. From that moment all\nquiet had left me, and all happiness. Still, it is not necessary that\na man should be happy. I doubt whether C\u00c3\u00a6sar was happy with all those\nenemies around him,--Gauls, and Britons, and Romans. If a man be\ndoing his duty, let him not think too much of that condition of mind\nwhich he calls happiness. Let him despise happiness and do his duty,\nand he will in one sense be happy. But if there creep upon him a\ndoubt as to his duty, if he once begin to feel that he may perhaps\nbe wrong, then farewell all peace of mind,--then will come that\ncondition in which a man is tempted to ask himself whether he be in\ntruth of sane mind.\n\nWhat should I do next? The cricketing Englishmen, I knew, were going.\nTwo or three days more would see their gallant ship steam out of the\nharbour. As I returned in my cab to the city, I could see the English\ncolours fluttering from her topmast, and the flag of the English\ncricket-club waving from her stern. But I knew well that they had\ndiscussed the question of the Fixed Period among them, and that\nthere was still time for them to go home and send back some English\nmandate which ought to be inoperative, but which we should be\nunable to disobey. And letters might have been written before\nthis,--treacherous letters, calling for the assistance of another\ncountry in opposition to the councils of their own.\n\nBut what should I do next? I could not enforce the law _vi et armis_\nagainst Crasweller. I had sadly but surely acknowledged so much as\nthat to myself. But I thought that I had seen signs of relenting\nabout the man,--some symptoms of sadness which seemed to bespeak a\nyielding spirit. He only asked for a year. He was still in theory\na supporter of the Fixed Period,--pleading his own little cause,\nhowever, by a direct falsehood. Could I not talk him into a generous\nassent? There would still be a year for him. And in old days there\nhad been a spice of manliness in his bosom, to which it might be\npossible that I should bring him back. Though the hope was poor, it\nseemed at present to be my only hope.\n\nAs I returned, I came round by the quays, dropping my cab at the\ncorner of the street. There was the crowd of Englishmen, all going\noff to the vessel to see their bats and bicycles disposed of, and\namong them was Jack the hero. They were standing at the water's-edge,\nwhile three long-boats were being prepared to take them off. \"Here's\nthe President,\" said Sir Kennington Oval; \"he has not seen our yacht\nyet: let him come on board with us.\" They were very gracious; so I\ngot into one boat, and Jack into another, and old Crasweller, who had\ncome with his guests from Little Christchurch, into the third; and we\nwere pulled off to the yacht. Jack, I perceived, was quite at home\nthere. He had dined there frequently, and had slept on board; but to\nme and Crasweller it was altogether new. \"Yes,\" said Lord Marylebone;\n\"if a fellow is to make his home for a month upon the seas, it is as\nwell to make it as comfortable as possible. Each of us has his own\ncrib, with a bath to himself, and all the et-ceteras. This is where\nwe feed. It is not altogether a bad shop for grubbing.\" As I looked\nround I thought that I had never seen anything more palatial and\nbeautiful. \"This is where we pretend to sit,\" continued the lord;\n\"where we are supposed to write our letters and read our books. And\nthis,\" he said, opening another door, \"is where we really sit, and\nsmoke our pipes, and drink our brandy-and-water. We came out under\nthe rule of that tyrant King MacNuffery. We mean to go back as\na republic. And I, as being the only lord, mean to elect myself\npresident. You couldn't give me any wrinkles as to a pleasant mode of\ngoverning? Everybody is to be allowed to do exactly what he pleases,\nand nobody is to be interfered with unless he interferes with\nsomebody else. We mean to take a wrinkle from you fellows in\nBritannula, where everybody seems, under your presidency, to be as\nhappy as the day is long.\"\n\n\"We have no Upper House with us, my lord,\" said I.\n\n\"You have got rid, at any rate, of one terrible bother. I daresay\nwe shall drop it before long in England. I don't see why we should\ncontinue to sit merely to register the edicts of the House of\nCommons, and be told that we're a pack of fools when we hesitate.\" I\ntold him that it was the unfortunate destiny of a House of Lords to\nbe made to see her own unfitness for legislative work.\n\n\"But if we were abolished,\" continued he, \"then I might get into\nthe other place and do something. You have to be elected a Peer of\nParliament, or you can sit nowhere. A ship can only be a ship, after\nall; but if we must live in a ship, we are not so bad here. Come and\ntake some tiffin.\" An Englishman, when he comes to our side of the\nglobe, always calls his lunch tiffin.\n\nI went back to the other room with Lord Marylebone; and as I took my\nplace at the table, I heard that the assembled cricketers were all\ndiscussing the Fixed Period.\n\n\"I'd be shot,\" said Mr Puddlebrane, \"if they should deposit me, and\nbleed me to death, and cremate me like a big pig.\" Then he perceived\nthat I had entered the saloon, and there came a sudden silence across\nthe table.\n\n\"What sort of wind will be blowing next Friday at two o'clock?\" asked\nSir Lords Longstop.\n\nIt was evident that Sir Lords had only endeavoured to change the\nconversation because of my presence; and it did not suit me to allow\nthem to think that I was afraid to talk of the Fixed Period. \"Why\nshould you object to be cremated, Mr Puddlebrane,\" said I, \"whether\nlike a big pig or otherwise? It has not been suggested that any one\nshall cremate you while alive.\"\n\n\"Because my father and mother were buried. And all the Puddlebranes\nwere always buried. There are they, all to be seen in Puddlebrane\nChurch, and I should like to appear among them.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's only their names that appear, and not their bodies,\nMr Puddlebrane. And a cremated man may have as big a tombstone as\nthough he had been allowed to become rotten in the orthodox fashion.\"\n\n\"What Puddlebrane means is,\" said another, \"that he'd like to have\nthe same chance of living as his ancestors.\"\n\n\"If he will look back to his family records he will find that they\nvery generally died before sixty-eight. But we have no idea of\ninvading your Parliament and forcing our laws upon you.\"\n\n\"Take a glass of wine, Mr President,\" said Lord Marylebone, \"and\nleave Puddlebrane to his ancestors. He's a very good Slip, though he\ndidn't catch Jack when he got a chance. Allow me to recommend you a\nbit of ice-pudding. The mangoes came from Jamaica, and are as fresh\nas the day they were picked.\" I ate my mango-pudding, but I did\nnot enjoy it, for I was sure that the whole crew were returning to\nEngland laden with prejudices against the Fixed Period. As soon as I\ncould escape, I got back to the shore, leaving Jack among my enemies.\nIt was impossible not to feel that they were my enemies, as I was\nsure that they were about to oppose the cherished conviction of my\nvery heart and soul. Crasweller had sat there perfectly silent while\nMr Puddlebrane had spoken of his own possible cremation. And yet\nCrasweller was a declared Fixed-Periodist.\n\nOn the Friday, at two o'clock, the vessel sailed amidst all the\nplaudits which could be given by mingled kettle-drums and trumpets,\nand by a salvo of artillery. They were as good a set of fellows as\never wore pink-flannel clothing, and as generous as any that there\nare born to live upon _p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9_ and champagne. I doubt whether there was\none among them who could have earned his bread in a counting-house,\nunless it was Stumps the professional. When we had paid all honour\nto the departing vessel, I went at once to Little Christchurch, and\nthere I found my friend in the verandah with Eva. During the last\nmonth or two he seemed to be much older than I had ever before known\nhim, and was now seated with his daughter's hand within his own. I\nhad not seen him since the day on board the yacht, and he now seemed\nto be greyer and more haggard than he was then. \"Crasweller,\" said\nI, taking him by the hand, \"it is a sad thing that you and I should\nquarrel after so many years of perfect friendship.\"\n\n\"So it is; so it is. I don't want to quarrel, Mr President.\"\n\n\"There shall be no quarrel. Well, Eva, how do you bear the loss of\nall your English friends?\"\n\n\"The loss of my English friends won't hurt me if I can only keep\nthose which I used to have in Britannula.\" I doubted whether she\nalluded to me or to Jack. It might be only to me, but I thought she\nlooked as if she were thinking of Jack.\n\n\"Eva, my dear,\" said Mr Crasweller, \"you had better leave us. The\nPresident, I think, wishes to speak to me on business.\" Then she\ncame up and looked me in the face, and pressed my hand, and I knew\nthat she was asking for mercy for her father. The feeling was not\npleasant, seeing that I was bound by the strongest oath which the\nmind can conceive not to show him mercy.\n\nI sat for a few minutes in silence, thinking that as Mr Crasweller\nhad banished Eva, he would begin. But he said nothing, and would have\nremained silent had I allowed him to do so. \"Crasweller,\" I said, \"it\nis certainly not well that you and I should quarrel on this matter.\nIn your company I first learned to entertain this project, and for\nyears we have agreed that in it is to be found the best means for\nremedying the condition of mankind.\"\n\n\"I had not felt then what it is to be treated as one who was already\ndead.\"\n\n\"Does Eva treat you so?\"\n\n\"Yes; with all her tenderness and all her sweet love, Eva feels that\nmy days are numbered unless I will boldly declare myself opposed to\nyour theory. She already regards me as though I were a visitant from\nthe other world. Her very gentleness is intolerable.\"\n\n\"But, Crasweller, the convictions of your mind cannot be changed.\"\n\n\"I do not know. I will not say that any change has taken place. But\nit is certain that convictions become vague when they operate against\none's self. The desire to live is human, and therefore God-like. When\nthe hand of God is felt to have struck one with coming death, the\nsufferer, knowing the blow to be inevitable, can reconcile himself;\nbut it is very hard to walk away to one's long rest while health, and\nwork, and means of happiness yet remain.\"\n\nThere was something in this which seemed to me to imply that he had\nabandoned the weak assertion as to his age, and no longer intended\nto ask for a year of grace by the use of that falsehood. But it was\nnecessary that I should be sure of this. \"As to your exact age, I've\nbeen looking at the records,\" I began.\n\n\"The records are right enough,\" he said; \"you need trouble yourself\nno longer about the records. Eva and I have discussed all that.\" From\nthis I became aware that Eva had convinced him of the baseness of the\nfalsehood.\n\n\"Then there is the law,\" said I, with, as I felt, unflinching\nhardness.\n\n\"Yes, there is the law,--if it be a law. Mr Exors is prepared to\ndispute it, and says that he will ask permission to argue the case\nout with the executive.\"\n\n\"He would argue about anything. You know what Exors is.\"\n\n\"And there is that poor man Barnes has gone altogether out of his\nmind, and has become a drivelling idiot.\"\n\n\"They told me yesterday that he was a raging lunatic; but I learn\nfrom really good authority that whether he takes one part or the\nother, he is only acting.\"\n\n\"And Tallowax is prepared to run amuck against those who come to\nfetch him. He swears that no one shall lead him up to the college.\"\n\n\"And you?\" Then there was a pause, and Crasweller sat silent with\nhis face buried in his hands. He was, at any rate, in a far better\ncondition of mind for persuasion than that in which I had last found\nhim. He had given up the fictitious year, and had acknowledged that\nhe had assented to the doctrine with which he was now asked to\ncomply. But it was a hard task that of having to press him under such\ncircumstances. I thought of Eva and her despair, and of himself with\nall that natural desire for life eager at his heart. I looked round\nand saw the beauty of the scenery, and thought how much worse to\nsuch a man would be the melancholy shades of the college than even\ndeparture itself. And I am not by nature hard-hearted. I have none of\nthat steel and fibre which will enable a really strong man to stand\nfirm by convictions even when opposed by his affections. To have\nliberated Crasweller at this moment, I would have walked off myself,\noh, so willingly, to the college! I was tearing my own heart to\npieces;--but I remembered Columbus and Galileo. Neither of them was\nsurely ever tried as I was at this moment. But it had to be done, or\nI must yield, and for ever. If I could not be strong to prevail with\nmy own friend and fellow-labourer,--with Crasweller, who was the\nfirst to come, and who should have entered the college with an heroic\ngrandeur,--how could I even desire any other to immure himself? how\npersuade such men as Barnes, or Tallowax, or that pettifogger Exors,\nto be led quietly up through the streets of the city? \"And you?\" I\nasked again.\n\n\"It is for you to decide.\"\n\nThe agony of that moment! But I think that I did right. Though my\nvery heart was bleeding, I know that I did right. \"For the sake\nof the benefits which are to accrue to unknown thousands of your\nfellow-creatures, it is your duty to obey the law.\" This I said in\na low voice, still holding him by the hand. I felt at the moment a\ngreat love for him,--and in a certain sense admiration, because he\nhad so far conquered his fear of an unknown future as to promise to\ndo this thing simply because he had said that he would do it. There\nwas no high feeling as to future generations of his fellow-creatures,\nno grand idea that he was about to perform a great duty for the\nbenefit of mankind in general, but simply the notion that as he had\nalways advocated my theory as my friend, he would not now depart from\nit, let the cost to himself be what it might. He answered me only by\ndrawing away his hand. But I felt that in his heart he accused me\nof cruelty, and of mad adherence to a theory. \"Should it not be so,\nCrasweller?\"\n\n\"As you please, President.\"\n\n\"But should it not be so?\" Then, at great length, I went over once\nagain all my favourite arguments, and endeavoured with the whole\nstrength of my eloquence to reach his mind. But I knew, as I was\ndoing so, that that was all in vain. I had succeeded,--or perhaps Eva\nhad done so,--in inducing him to repudiate the falsehood by which he\nhad endeavoured to escape. But I had not in the least succeeded in\nmaking him see the good which would come from his deposition. He was\nready to become a martyr, because in years back he had said that he\nwould do so. He had now left it for me to decide whether he should\nbe called upon to perform his promise; and I, with an unfeeling\npertinacity, had given the case against him. That was the light in\nwhich Mr Crasweller looked at it. \"You do not think that I am cruel?\"\nI asked.\n\n\"I do,\" said Crasweller. \"You ask the question, and I answer you. I\ndo think that you are cruel. It concerns life and death,--that is a\nmatter of course,--and it is the life and death of your most intimate\nfriend, of Eva's father, of him who years since came hither with\nyou from another country, and has lived with you through all the\nstruggles and all the successes of a long career. But you have my\nword, and I will not depart from it, even to save my life. In a\nmoment of weakness I was tempted to a weak lie. I will not lie. I\nwill not demean myself to claim a poor year of life by such means,\nthough I do not lack evidence to support the statement. I am ready\nto go with you;\" and he rose up from his seat as though intending to\nwalk away and be deposited at once.\n\n\"Not now, Crasweller.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready when you may come for me. I shall not again leave\nmy home till I have to leave it for the last time. Days and weeks\nmean nothing with me now. The bitterness of death has fallen upon\nme.\"\n\n\"Crasweller, I will come and live with you, and be a brother to you,\nduring the entire twelve months.\"\n\n\"No; it will not be needed. Eva will be with me, and perhaps Jack may\ncome and see me,--though I must not allow Jack to express the warmth\nof his indignation in Eva's hearing. Jack had perhaps better leave\nBritannula for a time, and not come back till all shall be over. Then\nhe may enjoy the lawns of Little Christchurch in peace,--unless,\nperchance, an idea should disturb him, that he has been put into\ntheir immediate possession by his father's act.\" Then he got up from\nhis chair and went from the verandah back into the house.\n\nAs I rose and returned to the city, I almost repented myself of what\nI had done. I had it in my heart to go back and yield, and to tell\nhim that I would assent to the abandonment of my whole project. It\nwas not for me to say that I would spare my own friend, and execute\nthe law against Barnes and Tallowax; nor was it for me to declare\nthat the victims of the first year should be forgiven. I could easily\nlet the law die away, but it was not in my power to decide that it\nshould fall into partial abeyance. This I almost did. But when I had\nturned on my road to Little Christchurch, and was prepared to throw\nmyself into Crasweller's arms, the idea of Galileo and Columbus, and\ntheir ultimate success, again filled my bosom. The moment had now\ncome in which I might succeed. The first man was ready to go to the\nstake, and I had felt all along that the great difficulty would be\nin obtaining the willing assent of the first martyr. It might well\nbe that these accusations of cruelty were a part of the suffering\nwithout which my great reform could not be carried to success. Though\nI should live to be accounted as cruel as C\u00c3\u00a6sar, what would that be\nif I too could reduce my Gaul to civilisation? \"Dear Crasweller,\"\nI murmured to myself as I turned again towards Gladstonopolis, and\nhurrying back, buried myself in the obscurity of the executive\nchambers.\n\nThe following day occurred a most disagreeable scene in my own house\nat dinner. Jack came in and took his chair at the table in grim\nsilence. It might be that he was lamenting for his English friends\nwho were gone, and therefore would not speak. Mrs Neverbend, too,\nate her dinner without a word. I began to fear that presently there\nwould be something to be said,--some cause for a quarrel; and as\nis customary on such occasions, I endeavoured to become specially\ngracious and communicative. I talked about the ship that had started\non its homeward journey, and praised Lord Marylebone, and laughed at\nMr Puddlebrane; but it was to no effect. Neither would Jack nor Mrs\nNeverbend say anything, and they ate their dinner gloomily till the\nattendant left the room. Then Jack began. \"I think it right to tell\nyou, sir, that there's going to be a public meeting on the Town Flags\nthe day after to-morrow.\" The Town Flags was an open unenclosed\nplace, over which, supported by arches, was erected the Town Hall.\nIt was here that the people were accustomed to hold those outside\nassemblies which too often guided the responsible Assembly in the\nSenate-house.\n\n\"And what are you all going to talk about there?\"\n\n\"There is only one subject,\" said Jack, \"which at present occupies\nthe mind of Gladstonopolis. The people don't intend to allow you to\ndeposit Mr Crasweller.\"\n\n\"Considering your age and experience, Jack, don't you think that\nyou're taking too much upon yourself to say whether people will allow\nor will not allow the executive of the country to perform their\nduty?\"\n\n\"If Jack isn't old,\" said Mrs Neverbend, \"I, at any rate, am older,\nand I say the same thing.\"\n\n\"Of course I only said what I thought,\" continued Jack. \"What I want\nto explain is, that I shall be there myself, and shall do all that I\ncan to support the meeting.\"\n\n\"In opposition to your father?\" said I.\n\n\"Well;--yes, I am afraid so. You see it's a public subject on a\npublic matter, and I don't see that father and son have anything to\ndo with it. If I were in the Assembly, I don't suppose I should be\nbound to support my father.\"\n\n\"But you're not in the Assembly.\"\n\n\"I have my own convictions all the same, and I find myself called\nupon to take a part.\"\n\n\"Good gracious--yes! and to save poor old Mr Crasweller's life from\nthis most inhuman law. He's just as fit to live as are you and I.\"\n\n\"The only question is, whether he be fit to die,--or rather to be\ndeposited, I mean. But I'm not going to argue the subject here. It\nhas been decided by the law; and that should be enough for you two,\nas it is enough for me. As for Jack, I will not have him attend any\nsuch meeting. Were he to do so, he would incur my grave\ndispleasure,--and consequent punishment.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to do to the boy?\" asked Mrs Neverbend.\n\n\"If he ceases to behave to me like a son, I shall cease to treat him\nlike a father. If he attends this meeting he must leave my house, and\nI shall see him no more.\"\n\n\"Leave the house!\" shrieked Mrs Neverbend.\n\n\"Jack,\" said I, with the kindest voice which I was able to assume,\n\"you will pack up your portmanteau and go to New Zealand the day\nafter to-morrow. I have business for you to transact with Macmurdo\nand Brown of some importance. I will give you the particulars when I\nsee you in the office.\"\n\n\"Of course he won't go, Mr Neverbend,\" cried my wife. But, though the\nwords were determined, there was a certain vacillation in the tone of\nher voice which did not escape me.\n\n\"We shall see. If Jack intends to remain as my son, he must obey his\nfather. I have been kind, and perhaps too indulgent, to him. I now\nrequire that he shall proceed to New Zealand the day after to-morrow.\nThe boat sails at eight. I shall be happy to go down with him and see\nhim on board.\"\n\nJack only shook his head,--by which I understood that he meant\nrebellion. I had been a most generous father to him, and loved him as\nthe very apple of my eye; but I was determined that I would be stern.\n\"You have heard my order,\" I said, \"and you can have to-morrow to\nthink about it. I advise you not to throw over, and for ever, the\naffection, the fostering care, and all the comforts, pecuniary\nas well as others, which you have hitherto had from an indulgent\nfather.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say that you will disinherit the boy?\" said Mrs\nNeverbend.\n\nI knew that it was utterly out of my power to do so. I could not\ndisinherit him. I could not even rob him of a single luxury without\nan amount of suffering much greater than he would feel. Was I not\nthinking of him day and night as I arranged my worldly affairs? That\nmoment when he knocked down Sir Kennington Oval's wicket, had I not\nbeen as proud as he was? When the trumpet sounded, did not I feel\nthe honour more than he? When he made his last triumphant run, and\nI threw my hat in the air, was it not to me sweeter than if I had\ndone it myself? Did I not even love him the better for swearing that\nhe would make this fight for Crasweller? But yet it was necessary\nthat I should command obedience, and, if possible, frighten him into\nsubservience. We talk of a father's power, and know that the old\nRomans could punish filial disobedience by death; but a Britannulan\nfather has a heart in his bosom which is more powerful than law or\neven custom, and I believe that the Roman was much the same. \"My\ndear, I will not discuss my future intentions before the boy. It\nwould be unseemly. I command him to start for New Zealand the day\nafter to-morrow, and I shall see whether he will obey me. I strongly\nadvise him to be governed in this matter by his father.\" Jack only\nshook his head, and left the room. I became aware afterwards that he\nslept that night at Little Christchurch.\n\nThat night I received such a lecture from Mrs Neverbend in our\nbedroom as might have shamed that Mrs Caudle of whom we read in\nEnglish history. I hate these lectures, not as thinking them\nunbecoming, but as being peculiarly disagreeable. I always find\nmyself absolutely impotent during their progress. I am aware that\nit is quite useless to speak a word, and that I can only allow the\nclock to run itself down. What Mrs Neverbend says at such moments has\nalways in it a great deal of good sense; but it is altogether wasted,\nbecause I knew it all beforehand, and with pen and ink could have\nwritten down the lecture which she delivered at that peculiar moment.\nAnd I fear no evil results from her anger for the future, because her\nconduct to me will, I know by experience, be as careful and as kind\nas ever. Were another to use harsh language to me, she would rise in\nwrath to defend me. And she does not, in truth, mean a tenth of what\nshe says. But I am for the time as though I were within the clapper\nof a mill; and her passion goes on increasing because she can never\nget a word from me. \"Mr Neverbend, I tell you this,--you are going to\nmake a fool of yourself. I think it my duty to tell you so, as your\nwife. Everybody else will think it. Who are you, to liken yourself\nto Galileo?--an old fellow of that kind who lived a thousand years\nago, before Christianity had ever been invented. You have got nasty\nmurderous thoughts in your mind, and want to kill poor Mr Crasweller,\njust out of pride, because you have said you would. Now, Jack is\ndetermined that you shan't, and I say that he is right. There is no\nreason why Jack shouldn't obey me as well as you. You will never\nbe able to deposit Mr Crasweller,--not if you try it for a hundred\nyears. The city won't let you do it; and if you have a grain of sense\nleft in your head, you won't attempt it. Jack is determined to meet\nthe men on the Town Flags the day after to-morrow, and I say that he\nis right. As for your disinheriting him, and spending all your money\non machinery to roast pigs,--I say you can't do it. There will be a\ncommission to inquire into you if you do not mind yourself, and then\nyou will remember what I told you. Poor Mr Crasweller, whom you have\nknown for forty years! I wonder how you can bring yourself to think\nof killing the poor man, whose bread you have so often eaten! And if\nyou think you are going to frighten Jack, you are very much mistaken.\nJack would do twice more for Eva Crasweller than for you or me, and\nit's natural he should. You may be sure he will not give up; and\nthe end will be, that he will get Eva for his own. I do believe\nhe has gone to sleep.\" Then I gave myself infinite credit for the\npertinacity of my silence, and for the manner in which I had put\non an appearance of somnolency without overacting the part. Mrs\nNeverbend did in truth go to sleep, but I lay awake during the whole\nnight thinking of the troubles before me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE \"JOHN BRIGHT.\"\n\n\nJack, of course, did not go to New Zealand, and I was bound to\nquarrel with him,--temporarily. They held the meeting on the Town\nFlags, and many eloquent words were, no doubt, spoken. I did not go,\nof course, nor did I think it well to read the reports. Mrs Neverbend\ntook it into her head at this time to speak to me only respecting the\nmaterial wants of life. \"Will you have another lump of sugar in your\ntea, Mr President?\" Or, \"If you want a second blanket on your bed,\nMr Neverbend, and will say the word, it shall be supplied.\" I took\nher in the same mood, and was dignified, cautious, and silent. With\nJack I was supposed to have quarrelled altogether, and very grievous\nit was to me not to be able to speak to the lad of a morning or an\nevening. But he did not seem to be much the worse for it. As for\nturning him out of the house or stopping his pocket-money, that would\nbe carrying the joke further than I could do it. Indeed it seemed to\nme that he was peculiarly happy at this time, for he did not go to\nhis office. He spent his mornings in making speeches, and then went\ndown in the afternoon on his bicycle to Little Christchurch.\n\nSo the time passed on, and the day absolutely came on which\nCrasweller was to be deposited. I had seen him constantly during the\nlast few weeks, but he had not spoken to me on the subject. He had\nsaid that he would not leave Little Christchurch, and he did not do\nso. I do not think that he had been outside his own grounds once\nduring these six weeks. He was always courteous to me, and would\noffer me tea and toast when I came, with a stately civility, as\nthough there had been no subject of burning discord between us. Eva I\nrarely saw. That she was there I was aware,--but she never came into\nmy presence till the evening before the appointed day, as I shall\npresently have to tell. Once or twice I did endeavour to lead him\non to the subject; but he showed a disinclination to discuss it so\ninvincible, that I was silenced. As I left him on the day before that\non which he was to be deposited, I assured him that I would call for\nhim on the morrow.\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself,\" he said, repeating the words twice over.\n\"It will be just the same whether you are here or not.\" Then I shook\nmy head by way of showing him that I would come, and I took my leave.\n\nI must explain that during these last few weeks things had not gone\nquietly in Gladstonopolis, but there had been nothing like a serious\nriot. I was glad to find that, in spite of Jack's speechifying,\nthe younger part of the population was still true to me, and I did\nnot doubt that I should still have got the majority of votes in\nthe Assembly. A rumour was spread abroad that the twelve months of\nCrasweller's period of probation were to be devoted to discussing the\nquestion, and I was told that my theory as to the Fixed Period would\nnot in truth have been carried out merely because Mr Crasweller had\nchanged his residence from Little Christchurch to the college. I had\nordered an open barouche to be prepared for the occasion, and had got\na pair of splendid horses fit for a triumphal march. With these I\nintended to call at Little Christchurch at noon, and to accompany Mr\nCrasweller up to the college, sitting on his left hand. On all other\noccasions, the President of the Republic sat in his carriage on the\nright side, and I had ever stood up for the dignities of my position.\nBut this occasion was to be an exception to all rule.\n\nOn the evening before, as I was sitting in my library at home\nmournfully thinking of the occasion, telling myself that after all\nI could not devote my friend to what some might think a premature\ndeath, the door was opened, and Eva Crasweller was announced. She\nhad on one of those round, close-fitting men's hats which ladies now\nwear, but under it was a veil which quite hid her face. \"I am taking\na liberty, Mr Neverbend,\" she said, \"in troubling you at the present\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Eva, my dear, how can anything you do be called a liberty?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Mr Neverbend. I have come to you because I am very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"I thought you had shunned me of late.\"\n\n\"So I have. How could I help it, when you have been so anxious to\ndeposit poor papa in that horrid place?\"\n\n\"He was equally anxious a few years since.\"\n\n\"Never! He agreed to it because you told him, and because you were\na man able to persuade. It was not that he ever had his heart in it,\neven when it was not near enough to alarm himself. And he is not a\nman fearful of death in the ordinary way. Papa is a brave man.\"\n\n\"My darling child, it is beautiful to hear you say so of him.\"\n\n\"He is going with you to-morrow simply because he has made you a\npromise, and does not choose to have it said of him that he broke his\nword even to save his own life. Is not that courage? It is not with\nhim as it is with you, who have your heart in the matter, because you\nthink of some great thing that you will do, so that your name may be\nremembered to future generations.\"\n\n\"It is not for that, Eva. I care not at all whether my name be\nremembered. It is for the good of many that I act.\"\n\n\"He believes in no good, but is willing to go because of his promise.\nIs it fair to keep him to such a promise under such circumstances?\"\n\n\"But the law--\"\n\n\"I will hear nothing of the law. The law means you and your\ninfluences. Papa is to be sacrificed to the law to suit your\npleasure. Papa is to be destroyed, not because the law wishes it, but\nto suit the taste of Mr Neverbend.\"\n\n\"Oh, Eva!\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\"To suit my taste?\"\n\n\"Well--what else? You have got the idea into your head, and you will\nnot drop it. And you have persuaded him because he is your friend.\nOh, a most fatal friendship! He is to be sacrificed because, when\nthinking of other things, he did not care to differ with you.\" Then\nshe paused, as though to see whether I might not yield to her words.\nAnd if the words of any one would have availed to make me yield, I\nthink it would have been hers as now spoken. \"Do you know what people\nwill say of you, Mr Neverbend?\" she continued.\n\n\"What will they say?\"\n\n\"If I only knew how best I could tell you! Your son has asked me--to\nbe his wife.\"\n\n\"I have long known that he has loved you well.\"\n\n\"But it can never be,\" she said, \"if my father is to be carried away\nto this fearful place. People would say that you had hurried him off\nin order that Jack--\"\n\n\"Would you believe it, Eva?\" said I, with indignation.\n\n\"It does not matter what I would believe. Mr Grundle is saying\nit already, and is accusing me too. And Mr Exors, the lawyer,\nis spreading it about. It has become quite the common report in\nGladstonopolis that Jack is to become at once the owner of Little\nChristchurch.\"\n\n\"Perish Little Christchurch!\" I exclaimed. \"My son would marry no\nman's daughter for his money.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it of Jack,\" she said, \"for I know that he is\ngenerous and good. There! I do love him better than any one in the\nworld. But as things are, I can never marry him if papa is to be shut\nup in that wretched City of the Dead.\"\n\n\"Not City of the Dead, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I cannot bear to think of it!--all alone with no one but me with\nhim to watch him as day after day passes away, as the ghastly hour\ncomes nearer and still nearer, when he is to be burned in those\nfearful furnaces!\"\n\n\"The cremation, my dear, has nothing in truth to do with the Fixed\nPeriod.\"\n\n\"To wait till the fatal day shall have arrived, and then to know that\nat a fixed hour he will be destroyed just because you have said so!\nCan you imagine what my feelings will be when that moment shall have\ncome?\"\n\nI had not in truth thought of it. But now, when the idea was\nrepresented to my mind's eye, I acknowledged to myself that it would\nbe impossible that she should be left there for the occasion. How or\nwhen she should be taken away, or whither, I could not at the moment\nthink. These would form questions which it would be very hard to\nanswer. After some score of years, say, when the community would be\nused to the Fixed Period, I could understand that a daughter or a\nwife might leave the college, and go away into such solitudes as\nthe occasion required, a week perhaps before the hour arranged for\ndeparture had come. Custom would make it comparatively easy; as\ncustom has arranged such a period of mourning for a widow, and such\nanother for a widower, a son, or a daughter. But here, with Eva,\nthere would be no custom. She would have nothing to guide her,\nand might remain there till the last fatal moment. I had hoped\nthat she might have married Jack, or perhaps Grundle, during the\ninterval,--not having foreseen that the year, which was intended to\nbe one of honour and glory, should become a time of mourning and\ntribulation. \"Yes, my dear, it is very sad.\"\n\n\"Sad! Was there ever a position in life so melancholy, so mournful,\nso unutterably miserable?\" I remained there opposite, gazing into\nvacancy, but I could say nothing. \"What do you intend to do, Mr\nNeverbend?\" she asked. \"It is altogether in your bosom. My father's\nlife or death is in your hands. What is your decision?\" I could only\nremain steadfast; but it seemed to be impossible to say so. \"Well, Mr\nNeverbend, will you speak?\"\n\n\"It is not for me to decide. It is for the country.\"\n\n\"The country!\" she exclaimed, rising up; \"it is your own pride,--your\nvanity and cruelty combined. You will not yield in this matter to me,\nyour friend's daughter, because your vanity tells you that when you\nhave once said a thing, that thing shall come to pass.\" Then she put\nthe veil down over her face, and went out of the room.\n\nI sat for some time motionless, trying to turn over in my mind all\nthat she had said to me; but it seemed as though my faculties were\nutterly obliterated in despair. Eva had been to me almost as a\ndaughter, and yet I was compelled to refuse her request for her\nfather's life. And when she had told me that it was my pride and\nvanity which had made me do so, I could not explain to her that they\nwere not the cause. And, indeed, was I sure of myself that it was not\nso? I had flattered myself that I did it for the public good; but\nwas I sure that obduracy did not come from my anxiety to be counted\nwith Columbus and Galileo? or if not that, was there not something\npersonal to myself in my desire that I should be known as one who had\nbenefited my species? In considering such matters, it is so hard to\nseparate the motives,--to say how much springs from some glorious\nlonging to assist others in their struggle upwards in humanity, and\nhow much again from mean personal ambition. I had thought that I had\ndone it all in order that the failing strength of old age might be\nrelieved, and that the race might from age to age be improved. But\nI now doubted myself, and feared lest that vanity of which Eva had\nspoken to me had overcome me. With my wife and son I could still be\nbrave,--even with Crasweller I could be constant and hard; but to be\nobdurate with Eva was indeed a struggle. And when she told me that\nI did so through pride, I found it very hard to bear. And yet it was\nnot that I was angry with the child. I became more and more attached\nto her the more loudly she spoke on behalf of her father. Her very\nindignation endeared me to her, and made me feel how excellent she\nwas, how noble a wife she would be for my son. But was I to give way\nafter all? Having brought the matter to such a pitch, was I to give\nup everything to the prayers of a girl? I was well aware even then\nthat my theory was true. The old and effete should go, in order that\nthe strong and manlike might rise in their places and do the work of\nthe world with the wealth of the world at their command. Take the\naverage of mankind all round, and there would be but the lessening of\na year or two from the life of them all. Even taking those men who\nhad arrived at twenty-five, to how few are allotted more than forty\nyears of life! But yet how large a proportion of the wealth of the\nworld remains in the hands of those who have passed that age, and are\nunable from senile imbecility to employ that wealth as it should be\nused! As I thought of this, I said to myself that Eva's prayers might\nnot avail, and I did take some comfort to myself in thinking that all\nwas done for the sake of posterity. And then, again, when I thought\nof her prayers, and of those stern words which had followed her\nprayers,--of that charge of pride and vanity,--I did tell myself that\npride and vanity were not absent.\n\nShe was gone now, and I felt that she must say and think evil things\nof me through all my future life. The time might perhaps come, when\nI too should have been taken away, and when her father should long\nsince have been at rest, that softer thoughts would come across her\nmind. If it were only possible that I might go, so that Jack might\nbe married to the girl he loved, that might be well. Then I wiped my\neyes, and went forth to make arrangements for the morrow.\n\nThe morning came,--the 30th of June,--a bright, clear, winter\nmorning, cold but still genial and pleasant as I got into the\nbarouche and had myself driven to Little Christchurch. To say that\nmy heart was sad within me would give no fair record of my condition.\nI was so crushed by grief, so obliterated by the agony of the hour,\nthat I hardly saw what passed before my eyes. I only knew that the\nday had come, the terrible day for which in my ignorance I had\nyearned, and that I was totally unable to go through its ceremonies\nwith dignity, or even with composure. But I observed as I was driven\ndown the street, lying out at sea many miles to the left, a small\nspot of smoke on the horizon, as though it might be of some passing\nvessel. It did not in the least awaken my attention; but there it\nwas, and I remembered to have thought as I passed on how blessed were\nthey who steamed by unconscious of that terrible ordeal of the Fixed\nPeriod which I was bound to encounter.\n\nI went to Little Christchurch, and there I found Mr Crasweller\nwaiting for me in the hall. I came in and took his limp hand in\nmine, and congratulated him. Oh how vain, how wretched, sounded that\ncongratulation in my own ears!\n\nAnd it was spoken, I was aware, in a piteous tone of voice, and with\nmeagre, bated breath. He merely shook his head, and attempted to pass\non. \"Will you not take your greatcoat?\" said I, seeing that he was\ngoing out into the open air without protection.\n\n\"No; why should I? It will not be wanted up there.\"\n\n\"You do not know the place,\" I replied. \"There are twenty acres of\npleasure-ground for you to wander over.\" Then he turned upon me\na look,--oh, such a look!--and went on and took his place in the\ncarriage. But Eva followed him, and spread a rug across his knees,\nand threw a cloak over his shoulders.\n\n\"Will not Eva come with us?\" I said.\n\n\"No; my daughter will hide her face on such a day as this. It is for\nyou and me to be carried through the city,--you because you are proud\nof the pageant, and me because I do not fear it.\" This, too, added\nsomething to my sorrow. Then I looked and saw that Eva got into a\nsmall closed carriage in the rear, and was driven off by a circuitous\nroute, to meet us, no doubt, at the college.\n\nAs we were driven away,--Crasweller and I,--I had not a word to say\nto him. And he seemed to collect himself in his fierceness, and to\nremain obdurately silent in his anger. In this way we drove on, till,\ncoming to a turn of the road, the expanse of the sea appeared before\nus. Here again I observed a small cloud of smoke which had grown out\nof the spot I had before seen, and I was aware that some large ship\nwas making its way into the harbour of Gladstonopolis. I turned my\nface towards it and gazed, and then a sudden thought struck me. How\nwould it be with me if this were some great English vessel coming\ninto our harbour on the very day of Crasweller's deposition? A year\nsince I would have rejoiced on such an occasion, and would have\nassured myself that I would show to the strangers the grandeur of\nthis ceremony, which must have been new to them. But now a creeping\nterror took possession of me, and I felt my heart give way within me.\nI wanted no Englishman, nor American, to come and see the first day\nof our Fixed Period.\n\nIt was evident that Crasweller did not see the smoke; but to my eyes,\nas we progressed, it became nearer, till at last the hull of the\nvast vessel became manifest. Then as the carriage passed on into the\nstreet of Gladstonopolis at the spot where one side of the street\nforms the quay, the vessel with extreme rapidity steamed in, and I\ncould see across the harbour that she was a ship of war. A certain\nsense of relief came upon my mind just then, because I felt sure that\nshe had come to interfere with the work which I had in hand; but how\nbase must be my condition when I could take delight in thinking that\nit had been interrupted!\n\nBy this time we had been joined by some eight or ten carriages,\nwhich formed, as it were, a funeral _cort\u00c3\u00a8ge_ behind us. But I could\nperceive that these carriages were filled for the most part by young\nmen, and that there was no contemporary of Crasweller to be seen at\nall. As we went up the town hill, I could espy Barnes gibbering on\nthe doorstep of his house, and Tallowax brandishing a large knife in\nhis hand, and Exors waving a paper over his head, which I well knew\nto be a copy of the Act of our Assembly; but I could only pretend not\nto see them as our carriage passed on.\n\nThe chief street of Gladstonopolis, running through the centre of\nthe city, descends a hill to the level of the harbour. As the vessel\ncame in we began to ascend the hill, but the horses progressed very\nslowly. Crasweller sat perfectly speechless by my side. I went on\nwith a forced smile upon my face, speaking occasionally to this or\nthe other neighbour as we met them. I was forced to be in a certain\ndegree cheerful, but grave and solemn in my cheerfulness. I was\ntaking this man home for that last glorious year which he was about\nto pass in joyful anticipation of a happier life; and therefore I\nmust be cheerful. But this was only the thing to be acted, the play\nto be played, by me the player. I must be solemn too,--silent as the\nchurchyard, mournful as the grave,--because of the truth. Why was I\nthus driven to act a part that was false? On the brow of the hill we\nmet a concourse of people both young and old, and I was glad to see\nthat the latter had come out to greet us. But by degrees the crowd\nbecame so numerous that the carriage was stopped in its progress; and\nrising up, I motioned to those around us to let us pass. We became,\nhowever, more firmly enveloped in the masses, and at last I had to\nask aloud that they would open and let us go on. \"Mr President,\" said\none old gentleman to me, a tanner in the city, \"there's an English\nship of war come into the harbour. I think they've got something to\nsay to you.\"\n\n\"Something to say to me! What can they have to say to me?\" I replied,\nwith all the dignity I could command.\n\n\"We'll just stay and see;--we'll just wait a few minutes,\" said\nanother elder. He was a bar-keeper with a red nose, and as he spoke\nhe took up a place in front of the horses. It was in vain for me to\npress the coachman. It would have been indecent to do so at such\na moment, and something at any rate was due to the position of\nCrasweller. He remained speechless in the carriage; but I thought\nthat I could see, as I glanced at his face, that he took a strong\ninterest in the proceedings. \"They're going to begin to come up the\nhill, Mr Bunnit,\" said the bar-keeper to the tanner, \"as soon as ever\nthey're out of their boats.\"\n\n\"God bless the old flag for ever and ever!\" said Mr Bunnit. \"I knew\nthey wouldn't let us deposit any one.\"\n\nThus their secret was declared. These old men,--the tanner and\nwhisky-dealer, and the like,--had sent home to England to get\nassistance against their own Government! There had always been a\nscum of the population,--the dirty, frothy, meaningless foam at\nthe top,--men like the drunken old bar-keeper, who had still clung\nsubmissive to the old country,--men who knew nothing of progress\nand civilisation,--who were content with what they ate and drank,\nand chiefly with the latter. \"Here they come. God bless their gold\nbands!\" said he of the red nose. Yes;--up the hill they came, three\ngilded British naval officers surrounded by a crowd of Britannulans.\n\nCrasweller heard it all, but did not move from his place. But he\nleaned forward, and he bit his lip, and I saw that his right hand\nshook as it grasped the arm of the carriage. There was nothing for me\nbut to throw myself back and remain tranquil. I was, however, well\naware that an hour of despair and opposition, and of defeat, was\ncoming upon me. Up they came, and were received with three deafening\ncheers by the crowd immediately round the carriage. \"I beg your\npardon, sir,\" said one of the three, whom I afterwards learned to be\nthe second lieutenant; \"are you the President of this Republic?\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied I; \"and what may you be?\"\n\n\"I am the second lieutenant on board H.M.'s gunboat, the John\nBright.\" I had heard of this vessel, which had been named from a\ngallant officer, who, in the beginning of the century, had seated\nhimself on a barrel of gunpowder, and had, single-handed, quelled a\nmutiny. He had been made Earl Bright for what he had done on that\noccasion, but the vessel was still called J. B. throughout the\nservice.\n\n\"And what may be your business with me, Mr Second Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Our captain, Captain Battleax's compliments, and he hopes you won't\nobject to postpone this interesting ceremony for a day or two till he\nmay come and see. He is sure that Mr Crasweller won't mind.\" Then he\ntook off his hat to my old friend. \"The captain would have come up\nhimself, but he can't leave the ship before he sees his big gun laid\non and made safe. He is very sorry to be so unceremonious, but the\n250-ton steam-swiveller requires a great deal of care.\"\n\n\"Laid on?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Well--yes. It is always necessary, when the ship lets go her anchor,\nto point the gun in the most effective manner.\"\n\n\"She won't go off, will she?\" asked Bunnit.\n\n\"Not without provocation, I think. The captain has the exploding wire\nunder double lock and key in his own state-room. If he only touched\nthe spring, we about the locality here would be knocked into little\nbits in less time than it will take you to think about it. Indeed the\nwhole of this side of the hill would become an instantaneous ruin\nwithout the sign of a human being anywhere.\"\n\nThere was a threat in this which I could not endure. And indeed, for\nmyself, I did not care how soon I might be annihilated. England,\nwith unsurpassed tyranny, had sent out one of her brutal modern\ninventions, and threatened us all with blood and gore and murder\nif we did not give up our beneficent modern theory. It was the\nmalevolent influence of the intellect applied to brute force,\ndominating its benevolent influence as applied to philanthropy. What\nwas the John Bright to me that it should come there prepared to send\nme into eternity by its bloodthirsty mechanism? It is an evil sign of\nthe times,--of the times that are in so many respects hopeful,--that\nthe greatest inventions of the day should always take the shape of\nengines of destruction! But what could I do in the agony of the\nmoment? I could but show the coolness of my courage by desiring the\ncoachman to drive on.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't!\" said Crasweller, jumping up.\n\n\"He shan't stir a step,\" said Bunnit to the bar-keeper.\n\n\"He can't move an inch,\" replied the other. \"We know what our\nprecious lives are worth; don't we, Mr Bunnit?\"\n\nWhat could I do? \"Mr Second Lieutenant, I must hold you responsible\nfor this interruption,\" said I.\n\n\"Exactly so. I am responsible,--as far as stopping this carriage\ngoes. Had all the town turned out in your favour, and had this\ngentleman insisted on being carried away to be buried--\"\n\n\"Nothing of that kind,\" said Crasweller.\n\n\"Then I think I may assume that Captain Battleax will not fire his\ngun. But if you will allow me, I will ask him a question.\" Then he\nput a minute whistle up to his mouth, and I could see, for the first\ntime, that there hung from this the thinnest possible metal wire,--a\nthread of silk, I would have said, only that it was much less\npalpable,--which had been dropped from the whistle as the lieutenant\nhad come along, and which now communicated with the vessel. I had,\nof course, heard of this hair telephone, but I had never before\nseen it used in such perfection. I was assured afterwards that one\nof the ship's officers could go ten miles inland and still hold\ncommunication with his captain. He put the instrument alternately to\nhis mouth and to his ear, and then informed me that Captain Battleax\nwas desirous that we should all go home to our own houses.\n\n\"I decline to go to my own house,\" I said. The lieutenant shrugged\nhis shoulders. \"Coachman, as soon as the crowd has dispersed itself,\nyou will drive on.\" The coachman, who was an old assistant in my\nestablishment, turned round and looked at me aghast. But he was soon\nput out of his trouble. Bunnit and the bar-keeper took out the horses\nand proceeded to lead them down the hill. Crasweller, as soon as he\nsaw this, said that he presumed he might go back, as he could not\npossibly go on. \"It is but three miles for us to walk,\" I said.\n\n\"I am forbidden to permit this gentleman to proceed either on foot or\nwith the carriage,\" said the lieutenant. \"I am to ask if he will do\nCaptain Battleax the honour to come on board and take tiffin with\nhim. If I could only prevail on you, Mr President.\" On this I shook\nmy head in eager denial. \"Exactly so; but he will hope to see you on\nanother occasion soon.\" I little thought then, how many long days I\nshould have to pass with Captain Battleax and his officers, or how\npleasant companions I should find them when the remembrance of the\npresent indignity had been somewhat softened by time.\n\nCrasweller turned upon his heel and walked down the hill with the\nofficers,--all the crowd accompanying them; while Bunnit and the\nbar-keeper had gone off with the horses. I had not descended from\nthe carriage; but there I was, planted alone,--the President of the\nRepublic left on the top of the hill in his carriage without means of\nlocomotion! On looking round I saw Jack, and with Jack I saw also a\nlady, shrouded from head to foot in black garments, with a veil over\nher face, whom I knew, from the little round hat upon her head, to be\nEva. Jack came up to me, but where Eva went I could not see. \"Shall\nwe walk down to the house?\" he said. I felt that his coming to me at\nsuch a moment was kind, because I had been, as it were, deserted by\nall the world. Then he opened the door of the carriage, and I came\nout. \"It was very odd that those fellows should have turned up just\nat this moment,\" said Jack.\n\n\"When things happen very oddly, as you call it, they seem to have\nbeen premeditated.\"\n\n\"Not their coming to-day. That has not been premeditated; at least\nnot to my knowledge. Indeed I did not in the least know what the\nEnglish were likely to do.\"\n\n\"Do you think it right to send to the enemies of your country for aid\nagainst your country?\" This I asked with much indignation, and I had\nrefused as yet to take his arm.\n\n\"Oh but, sir, England isn't our enemy.\"\n\n\"Not when she comes and interrupts the quiet execution of our laws\nby threats of blowing us and our city and our citizens to instant\ndestruction!\"\n\n\"She would never have done it. I don't suppose that big gun is even\nloaded.\"\n\n\"The more contemptible is her position. She threatens us with a lie\nin her mouth.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it, sir. The gun may be there all right, and\nthe gunpowder, and the twenty tons of iron shot. But I'm sure she'll\nnot fire it off in our harbour. They say that each shot costs two\nthousand five hundred pounds, and that the wear and tear to the\nvessel is two thousand more. There are things so terrible, that if\nyou will only create a belief in them, that will suffice without\nanything else. I suppose we may walk down. Crasweller has gone, and\nyou can do nothing without him.\"\n\nThis was true, and I therefore prepared to descend the hill. My\nposition as President of the Republic did demand a certain amount\nof personal dignity; and how was I to uphold that in my present\ncircumstances? \"Jack,\" said I, \"it is the sign of a noble mind to\nbear contumely without petulance. Since our horses have gone before\nus, and Crasweller and the crowd have gone, we will follow them.\"\nThen I put my arm within his, and as I walked down the hill, I almost\ntook joy in thinking that Crasweller had been spared.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Jack, as we walked on, \"I want to tell you something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Something of most extreme importance to me! I never thought that I\nshould have been so fortunate as to announce to you what I've now got\nto say. I hardly know whether I am standing on my head or my heels.\nEva Crasweller has promised to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"If you will make us happy by giving us your permission.\"\n\n\"I should not have thought that she would have asked for that.\"\n\n\"She has to ask her father, and he's all right. He did say, when I\nspoke to him this morning, that his permission would go for nothing,\nas he was about to be led away and deposited. Of course I told him\nthat all that would amount to nothing.\"\n\n\"To nothing! What right had you to say so?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,--you see that a party of us were quite determined. Eva\nhad said that she would never let me even speak to her as long as her\nfather's life was in danger. She altogether hated that wretch Grundle\nfor wanting to get rid of him. I swore to her that I would do the\nbest I could, and she said that if I could succeed, then--she thought\nshe could love me. What was a fellow to do?\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I had it all out with Sir Kennington Oval, who is the prince of\ngood fellows; and he telegraphed to his uncle, who is Secretary for\nBenevolence, or some such thing, at home.\"\n\n\"England is not your home,\" said I.\n\n\"It's the way we all speak of it.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"Well, he went to work, and the John Bright was sent out here. But it\nwas only an accident that it should come on this very day.\"\n\nAnd this was the way in which things are to be managed in Britannula!\nBecause a young boy had fallen in love with a pretty girl, the whole\nwealth of England was to be used for a most nefarious purpose, and a\ngreat nation was to exercise its tyranny over a small one, in which\nher own language was spoken and her own customs followed! In every\nway England had had reason to be proud of her youngest child. We\nBritannulans had become noted for intellect, morals, health, and\nprosperity. We had advanced a step upwards, and had adopted the Fixed\nPeriod. Then, at the instance of this lad, a leviathan of war was\nto be sent out to crush us unless we would consent to put down the\ncherished conviction of our hearts! As I thought of all, walking\ndown the street hanging on Jack's arm, I had to ask myself whether\nthe Fixed Period was the cherished conviction of our hearts. It was\nso of some, no doubt; and I had been able, by the intensity of my\nwill,--and something, too, by the covetousness and hurry of the\nyounger men,--to cause my wishes to prevail in the community. I did\nnot find that I had reconciled myself to the use of this covetousness\nwith the object of achieving a purpose which I believed to be\nthoroughly good. But the heartfelt conviction had not been strong\nwith the people. I was forced to confess as much. Had it indeed been\nreally strong with any but myself? Was I not in the position of a\nshepherd driving sheep into a pasture which was distasteful to them?\nEat, O sheep, and you will love the food in good time,--you or the\nlambs that are coming after you! What sheep will go into unsavoury\npastures, with no hopes but such as these held out to them? And yet I\nhad been right. The pasture had been the best which the ingenuity of\nman had found for the maintenance of sheep.\n\n\"Jack,\" said I, \"what a poor, stupid, lovelorn boy you are!\"\n\n\"I daresay I am,\" said Jack, meekly.\n\n\"You put the kisses of a pretty girl, who may perhaps make you a good\nwife,--and, again, may make you a bad one,--against all the world in\narms.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure about that,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Sure about what?\"\n\n\"That there is not a fellow in all Britannula will have such a wife\nas Eva.\"\n\n\"That means that you are in love. And because you are in love, you\nare to throw over--not merely your father, because in such an affair\nthat goes for nothing--\"\n\n\"Oh, but it does; I have thought so much about it.\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you. But you are to put yourself in opposition\nto the greatest movement made on behalf of the human race for\ncenturies; you are to set yourself up against--\"\n\n\"Galileo and Columbus,\" he suggested, quoting my words with great\ncruelty.\n\n\"The modern Galileo, sir; the Columbus of this age. And you are to\nconquer them! I, the father, have to submit to you the son; I the\nPresident of fifty-seven, to you the schoolboy of twenty-one; I the\nthoughtful man, to you the thoughtless boy! I congratulate you; but I\ndo not congratulate the world on the extreme folly which still guides\nits actions.\" Then I left him, and going into the executive chambers,\nsat myself down and cried in the very agony of a broken heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE NEW GOVERNOR.\n\n\n\"So,\" said I to myself, \"because of Jack and his love, all the\naspirations of my life are to be crushed! The whole dream of my\nexistence, which has come so near to the fruition of a waking moment,\nis to be violently dispelled because my own son and Sir Kennington\nOval have settled between them that a pretty girl is to have her own\nway.\" As I thought of it, there seemed to be a monstrous cruelty\nand potency in Fortune, which she never could have been allowed to\nexercise in a world which was not altogether given over to injustice.\nIt was for that that I wept. I wept to think that a spirit of honesty\nshould as yet have prevailed so little in the world. Here, in our\nwaters, was lying a terrible engine of British power, sent out by a\nBritish Cabinet Minister,--the so-called Minister of Benevolence, by\na bitter chance,--at the instance of that Minister's nephew, to put\ndown by brute force the most absolutely benevolent project for the\ngovernance of the world which the mind of man had ever projected. It\nwas in that that lay the agony of the blow.\n\nI remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge\nthat before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to\nlook at the matter in another light. Had Eva Crasweller not been\ngood-looking, had Jack been still at college, had Sir Kennington Oval\nremained in England, had Mr Bunnit and the bar-keeper not succeeded\nin stopping my carriage on the hill,--should I have succeeded in\narranging for the final departure of my old friend? That was the\nquestion which I ought to ask myself. And even had I succeeded in\ncarrying my success so far as that, should I not have appeared a\nmurderer to my fellow-citizens had not his departure been followed in\nregular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn?\nHad Crasweller departed, and had the system then been stopped, should\nI not have appeared a murderer even to myself? And what hope had\nthere been, what reasonable expectation, that the system should have\nbeen allowed fair-play?\n\nIt must be understood that I, I myself, have never for a moment\nswerved. But though I have been strong enough to originate the idea,\nI have not been strong enough to bear the terrible harshness of the\nopinions of those around me when I should have exercised against\nthose dear to me the mandates of the new law. If I could, in the\nspirit, have leaped over a space of thirty years and been myself\ndeposited in due order, I could see that my memory would have\nbeen embalmed with those who had done great things for their\nfellow-citizens. Columbus, and Galileo, and Newton, and Harvey, and\nWilberforce, and Cobden, and that great Banting who has preserved us\nall so completely from the horrors of obesity, would not have been\nnamed with honour more resplendent than that paid to the name of\nNeverbend. Such had been my ambition, such had been my hope. But it\nis necessary that a whole age should be carried up to some proximity\nto the reformer before there is a space sufficiently large for his\noperations. Had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient\nRome, would the Romans have accepted it, or have stoned Wheatstone?\nSo thinking, I resolved that I was before my age, and that I must pay\nthe allotted penalty.\n\nOn arriving at home at my own residence, I found that our _salon_ was\nfilled with a brilliant company. We did not usually use the room;\nbut on entering the house I heard the clatter of conversation, and\nwent in. There was Captain Battleax seated there, beautiful with a\ncocked-hat, and an epaulet, and gold braid. He rose to meet me, and\nI saw that he was a handsome tall man about forty, with a determined\nface and a winning smile. \"Mr President,\" said he, \"I am in command\nof her Majesty's gunboat, the John Bright, and I have come to pay my\nrespects to the ladies.\"\n\n\"I am sure the ladies have great pleasure in seeing you.\" I looked\nround the room, and there, with other of our fair citizens, I saw\nEva. As I spoke I made him a gracious bow, and I think I showed\nhim by my mode of address that I did not bear any grudge as to my\nindividual self.\n\n\"I have come to your shores, Mr President, with the purpose of seeing\nhow things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world.\"\n\n\"Things were progressing, Captain Battleax, pretty well before this\nmorning. We have our little struggles here as elsewhere, and all\nthings cannot be done by rose-water. But, on the whole, we are a\nprosperous and well-satisfied people.\"\n\n\"We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleax,\" said my wife.\n\n\"Quite satisfied,\" said Eva.\n\n\"I am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so\npleasant a manner,\" said First-Lieutenant Crosstrees, an officer with\nwhom I have since become particularly intimate.\n\nThen there was a little pause in the conversation, and I felt myself\nbound to say something as to the violent interruption to which I had\nthis morning been subjected. And yet that something must be playful\nin its nature. I must by no means show in such company as was now\npresent the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind. \"You will\nperceive, Captain Battleax, that there is a little difference of\nopinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have\nbeen accomplished this morning. The ladies, in compliance with that\nsoftness of heart which is their characteristic, are on one side; and\nthe men, by whom the world has to be managed, are on the other. No\ndoubt, in process of time the ladies will follow--\"\n\n\"Their masters,\" said Mrs Neverbend. \"No doubt we shall do so when\nit is only ourselves that we have to sacrifice, but never when the\nquestion concerns our husbands, our fathers, and our sons.\"\n\nThis was a pretty little speech enough, and received the eager\ncompliments of the officers of the John Bright. \"I did not mean,\"\nsaid Captain Battleax, \"to touch upon public subjects at such a\nmoment as this. I am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from\nGreat Britain to Britannula, to congratulate you all on your late\nvictory at cricket, and to say how loud are the praises bestowed\non Mr John Neverbend, junior, for his skill and gallantry. The\npower of his arm is already the subject discussed at all clubs and\ndrawing-rooms at home. We had received details of the whole affair\nby water-telegram before the John Bright started. Mrs Neverbend, you\nmust indeed be proud of your son.\"\n\nJack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva,\nand was now reduced to silence by his praises.\n\n\"Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player,\" said my wife.\n\n\"And my Lord Marylebone behaves himself quite like a British peer,\"\nsaid the wife of the Mayor of Gladstonopolis,--a lady whom he had\nmarried in England, and who had not moved there in quite the highest\ncircles.\n\nThen we began to think of the hospitality of the island, and the\nofficers of the John Bright were asked to dine with us on the\nfollowing day. I and my wife and son, and the two Craswellers, and\nthree or four others, agreed to dine on board the ship on the next.\nTo me personally an extreme of courtesy was shown. It seemed as\nthough I were treated with almost royal honour. This, I felt, was\npaid to me as being President of the republic, and I endeavoured to\nbehave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit\nthe occasion; but I could not but feel that something was wanting\nto the simplicity of my ordinary life. My wife, on the spur of the\nmoment, managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner. Including\nthe chaplain and the surgeon, there were twelve of them, and she\nasked twelve of the prettiest girls in Gladstonopolis to meet them.\nThis, she said, was true hospitality; and I am not sure that I did\nnot agree with her. Then there were three or four leading men of the\ncommunity, with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers\nand mothers of the young ladies. We sat down thirty-six to dinner;\nand I think that we showed a great divergence from those usual\ncolonial banquets, at which the elders are only invited to meet\ndistinguished guests. The officers were chiefly young men; and a\ngreater babel of voices was, I'll undertake to say, never heard from\na banqueting-hall than came from our dinner-table. Eva Crasweller was\nthe queen of the evening, and was as joyous, as beautiful, and as\nhigh-spirited as a queen should ever be. I did once or twice during\nthe festivity glance round at old Crasweller. He was quiet, and I\nmight almost say silent, during the whole evening; but I could see\nfrom the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the\npassion for life that dwells in the human breast.\n\n\"Your promised bride seems to have it all her own way,\" said Captain\nBattleax to Jack, when at last the ladies had withdrawn.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Jack, \"and I'm nowhere. But I mean to have my innings\nbefore long.\"\n\nOf what Mrs Neverbend had gone through in providing birds, beasts,\nand fishes, not to talk of tarts and jellies, for the dinner of that\nday, no one but myself can have any idea; but it must be admitted\nthat she accomplished her task with thorough success. I was told,\ntoo, that after the invitations had been written, no milliner in\nBritannula was allowed to sleep a single moment till half an hour\nbefore the ladies were assembled in our drawing-room; but their\nefforts, too, were conspicuously successful.\n\nOn the next day some of us went on board the John Bright for a return\ndinner; and very pleasant the officers made it. The living on board\nthe John Bright is exceedingly good, as I have had occasion to learn\nfrom many dinners eaten there since that day. I little thought when I\nsat down at the right hand of Captain Battleax as being the President\nof the republic, with my wife on his left, I should ever spend more\nthan a month on board the ship, or write on board it this account of\nall my thoughts and all my troubles in regard to the Fixed Period.\nAfter dinner Captain Battleax simply proposed my health, paying to\nme many unmeaning compliments, in which, however, I observed that no\nreference was made to the special doings of my presidency; and he\nended by saying, that though he had, as a matter of courtesy, and\nwith the greatest possible alacrity, proposed my health, he would\nnot call upon me for any reply. And immediately on his sitting down,\nthere got up a gentleman to whom I had not been introduced before\nthis day, and gave the health of Mrs Neverbend and the ladies of\nBritannula. Now in spite of what the captain said, I undoubtedly had\nintended to make a speech. When the President of the republic has\nhis health drunk, it is, I conceive, his duty to do so. But here the\ngentleman rose with a rapidity which did at the moment seem to have\nbeen premeditated. At any rate, my eloquence was altogether stopped.\nThe gentleman was named Sir Ferdinando Brown. He was dressed in\nsimple black, and was clearly not one of the ship's officers; but\nI could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special\nmeasure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent.\nHe sat on Mrs Neverbend's left hand, and did seem in some respect\nto be the chief man on that occasion. However, he proposed Mrs\nNeverbend's health and the ladies, and the captain instantly called\nupon the band to play some favourite tune. After that there was\nno attempt at speaking. We sat with the officers some little time\nafter dinner, and then went ashore. \"Sir Ferdinando and I,\" said the\ncaptain, as we shook hands with him, \"will do ourselves the honour of\ncalling on you at the executive chambers to-morrow morning.\"\n\nI went home to bed with a presentiment of evil running across my\nheart. A presentiment indeed! How much of evil,--of real accomplished\nevil,--had there not occurred to me during the last few days! Every\nhope for which I had lived, as I then told myself, had been brought\nto sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom I had been so\npleasant, and who, in their turn, had been so pleasant to me! What\ncould I do now but just lay myself down and die? And the death of\nwhich I dreamt could not, alas! be that true benumbing death which\nwe think may put an end, or at any rate give a change, to all our\nthoughts. To die would be as nothing; but to live as the late\nPresident of the republic who had fixed his aspirations so high,\nwould indeed be very melancholy. As President I had still two\nyears to run, but it occurred to me now that I could not possibly\nendure those two years of prolonged nominal power. I should be the\nlaughing-stock of the people; and as such, it would become me to hide\nmy head. When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel\nback to England, I would retire to a small farm which I possessed at\nthe farthest side of the island, and there in seclusion would I end\nmy days. Mrs Neverbend should come with me, or stay, if it so pleased\nher, in Gladstonopolis. Jack would become Eva's happy husband,\nand would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world.\nCrasweller, the triumphant, would live, and at last die, amidst the\nflocks and herds of Little Christchurch. I, too, would have a small\nherd, a little flock of my own, surrounded by no such glories as\nthose of Little Christchurch,--owing nothing to wealth, or scenery,\nor neighbourhood,--and there, till God should take me, I would spend\nthe evening of my day. Thinking of all this, I went to sleep.\n\nOn the next morning Sir Ferdinando Brown and Captain Battleax were\nannounced at the executive chambers. I had already been there at my\nwork for a couple of hours; but Sir Ferdinando apologised for the\nearliness of his visit. It seemed to me as he entered the room and\ntook the chair that was offered to him, that he was the greater man\nof the two on the occasion,--or perhaps I should say of the three.\nAnd yet he had not before come on shore to visit me, nor had he\nmade one at our little dinner-party. \"Mr Neverbend,\" began the\ncaptain,--and I observed that up to that moment he had generally\naddressed me as President,--\"it cannot be denied that we have come\nhere on an unpleasant mission. You have received us with all that\ncourtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands\nso high. But you must be aware that it has been our intention to\ninterfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a\nduty.\"\n\n\"It is a duty,\" said I. \"But your power is so superior to any that\nI can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in\nyielding to it. Therefore we can be courteous while we submit. Not a\ndoubt but had your force been only double or treble our own, I should\nhave found it my duty to struggle with you. But how can a little\nState, but a few years old, situated on a small island, far removed\nfrom all the centres of civilisation, contend on any point with the\nowner of the great 250-ton swiveller-gun?\"\n\n\"That is all quite true, Mr Neverbend,\" said Sir Ferdinando Brown.\n\n\"I can afford to smile, because I am absolutely powerless before you;\nbut I do not the less feel that, in a matter in which the progress of\nthe world is concerned, I, or rather we, have been put down by brute\nforce. You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.\nWhether your gun be loaded or not matters little.\"\n\n\"It is certainly loaded,\" said Captain Battleax.\n\n\"Then you have wasted your powder and shot. Like a highwayman, it\nwould have sufficed for you merely to tell the weak and cowardly that\nyour pistol would be made to go off when wanted. To speak the truth,\nCaptain Battleax, I do not think that you excel us more in courage\nthan you do in thought and practical wisdom. Therefore, I feel myself\nquite able, as President of this republic, to receive you with a\ncourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.\"\n\n\"Very well put,\" said Sir Ferdinando. I simply bowed to him. \"And\nnow,\" he continued, \"will you answer me one question?\"\n\n\"A dozen if it suits you to ask them.\"\n\n\"Captain Battleax cannot remain here long with that expensive toy\nwhich he keeps locked up somewhere among his cocked-hats and white\ngloves. I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the\ntrigger since I have been on board. But 250-ton swivellers do cost\nmoney, and the John Bright must steam away, and play its part in\nother quarters of the globe. What do you intend to do when he shall\nhave taken his pocket-pistol away?\"\n\nI thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give\nto this question, but I paused only for a moment or two. \"I shall\nproceed at once to carry out the Fixed Period.\" I felt that my honour\ndemanded that to such a question I should make no other reply.\n\n\"And that in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of a large\nproportion of your fellow-citizens?\"\n\n\"The wishes of our fellow-citizens have been declared by repeated\nmajorities in the Assembly.\"\n\n\"You have only one House in your Constitution,\" said Sir Ferdinando.\n\n\"One House I hold to be quite sufficient.\"\n\nI was proceeding to explain the theory on which the Britannulan\nConstitution had been formed, when Sir Ferdinando interrupted me. \"At\nany rate, you will admit that a second Chamber is not there to guard\nagainst the sudden action of the first. But we need not discuss all\nthis now. It is your purpose to carry out your Fixed Period as soon\nas the John Bright shall have departed?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here\nto enable you to do so?\"\n\n\"I think I am,\" I said, with a modest acquiescence in an assertion\nwhich I felt to be so much to my credit. But I blushed for its\nuntruth.\n\n\"Then,\" said Sir Ferdinando, \"there is nothing for it but that he\nmust take you with him.\"\n\nThere came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words, which\nexceeded anything which I had yet felt. Me, the President of a\nforeign nation, the first officer of a people with whom Great Britain\nwas at peace,--the captain of one of her gunboats must carry me off,\nhurry me away a prisoner, whither I knew not, and leave the country\nungoverned, with no President as yet elected to supply my place! And\nI, looking at the matter from my own point of view, was a husband,\nthe head of a family, a man largely concerned in business,--I was to\nbe carried away in bondage--I, who had done no wrong, had disobeyed\nno law, who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my\nduties! No opposition ever shown to Columbus and Galileo had come\nnear to this in audacity and oppression. I, the President of a free\nrepublic, the elected of all its people, the chosen depository of its\nofficial life,--I was to be kidnapped and carried off in a ship of\nwar, because, forsooth, I was deemed too popular to rule the country!\nAnd this was told to me in my own room in the executive chambers, in\nthe very sanctum of public life, by a stout florid gentleman in a\nblack coat, of whom I hitherto knew nothing except that his name was\nBrown!\n\n\"Sir,\" I said, after a pause, and turning to Captain Battleax and\naddressing him, \"I cannot believe that you, as an officer in the\nBritish navy, will commit any act of tyranny so oppressive, and of\ninjustice so gross, as that which this gentleman has named.\"\n\n\"You hear what Sir Ferdinando Brown has said,\" replied Captain\nBattleax.\n\n\"I do not know the gentleman,--except as having been introduced to\nhim at your hospitable table. Sir Ferdinando Brown is to me--simply\nSir Ferdinando Brown.\"\n\n\"Sir Ferdinando has lately been our British Governor in Ashantee,\nwhere he has, as I may truly say, 'bought golden opinions from all\nsorts of people.' He has now been sent here on this delicate mission,\nand to no one could it be intrusted by whom it would be performed\nwith more scrupulous honour.\" This was simply the opinion of Captain\nBattleax, and expressed in the presence of the gentleman himself whom\nhe so lauded.\n\n\"But what is the delicate mission?\" I asked.\n\nThen Sir Ferdinando told his whole story, which I think should have\nbeen declared before I had been asked to sit down to dinner with him\nin company with the captain on board the ship. I was to be taken away\nand carried to England or elsewhere,--or drowned upon the voyage,\nit mattered not which. That was the first step to be taken towards\ncarrying out the tyrannical, illegal, and altogether injurious\nintention of the British Government. Then the republic of Britannula\nwas to be declared as non-existent, and the British flag was to be\nexalted, and a British Governor installed in the executive chambers!\nThat Governor was to be Sir Ferdinando Brown.\n\nI was lost in a maze of wonderment as I attempted to look at the\nproceeding all round. Now, at the close of the twentieth century,\ncould oppression be carried to such a height as this? \"Gentlemen,\" I\nsaid, \"you are powerful. That little instrument which you have hidden\nin your cabin makes you the master of us all. It has been prepared\nby the ingenuity of men, able to dominate matter though altogether\npowerless over mind. On myself, I need hardly say that it would be\ninoperative. Though you should reduce me to atoms, from them would\nspring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your\nartillery. But the dread of it is to the generality much more\npowerful than the fact of its possession.\"\n\n\"You may be quite sure it's there,\" said Captain Battleax, \"and that\nI can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of\nmy return on board.\"\n\n\"You propose to kidnap me,\" I said. \"What would become of your gun\nwere I to kidnap you?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Crosstrees has sealed orders, and is practically\nacquainted with the mechanism of the gun. Lieutenant Crosstrees is\na very gallant officer. One of us always remains on board while the\nother is on shore. He would think nothing of blowing me up, so long\nas he obeyed orders.\"\n\n\"I was going on to observe,\" I continued, \"that though this power\nis in your hands, and in that of your country, the exercise of it\nbetrays not only tyranny of disposition, but poorness and meanness\nof spirit.\" I here bowed first to the one gentleman, and then to the\nother. \"It is simply a contest between brute strength and mental\nenergy.\"\n\n\"If you will look at the contests throughout the world,\" said Sir\nFerdinando, \"you will generally find that the highest respect is paid\nto the greatest battalions.\"\n\n\"What world-wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses!\" said I,\nstill turning myself to the captain; for though I would have crushed\nthem both by my words had it been possible, my dislike centred itself\non Sir Ferdinando. He was a man who looked as though everything were\nto yield to his meagre philosophy; and it seemed to me as though he\nenjoyed the exercise of the tyranny which chance had put into his\npower.\n\n\"You will allow me to suggest,\" said he, \"that that is a matter of\nopinion. In the meantime, my friend Captain Battleax has below a\nguard of fifty marines, who will pay you the respect of escorting you\non board with two of the ship's cutters. Everything that can be there\ndone for your accommodation and comfort,--every luxury which can be\nprovided to solace the President of this late republic,--shall be\nafforded. But, Mr Neverbend, it is necessary that you should go to\nEngland; and allow me to assure you, that your departure can neither\nbe prevented nor delayed by uncivil words spoken to the future\nGovernor of this prosperous colony.\"\n\n\"My words are, at any rate, less uncivil than Captain Battleax's\nmarines; and they have, I submit, been made necessary by the conduct\nof your country in this matter. Were I to comply with your orders\nwithout expressing my own opinion, I should seem to have done so\nwillingly hereafter. I say that the English Government is a tyrant,\nand that you are the instruments of its tyranny. Now you can proceed\nto do your work.\"\n\n\"That having all been pleasantly settled,\" said Sir Ferdinando, with\na smile, \"I will ask you to read the document by which this duty has\nbeen placed in my hands.\" He then took out of his pocket a letter\naddressed to him by the Duke of Hatfield, as Minister for the Crown\nColonies, and gave it to me to read. The letter ran as follows:--\n\n\n   COLONIAL OFFICE, CROWN COLONIES,\n   15th May 1980.\n\n   SIR,--I have it in command to inform your Excellency that\n   you have been appointed Governor of the Crown colony which\n   is called Britannula. The peculiar circumstances of the\n   colony are within your Excellency's knowledge. Some years\n   since, after the separation of New Zealand, the inhabitants\n   of Britannula requested to be allowed to manage their own\n   affairs, and H.M. Minister of the day thought it expedient\n   to grant their request. The country has since undoubtedly\n   prospered, and in a material point of view has given\n   us no grounds for regret. But in their selection of a\n   Constitution the Britannulists have unfortunately allowed\n   themselves but one deliberative assembly, and hence have\n   sprung their present difficulties. It must be, that in\n   such circumstances crude councils should be passed as laws\n   without the safeguard coming from further discussion and\n   thought. At the present moment a law has been passed which,\n   if carried into action, would become abhorrent to mankind\n   at large. It is contemplated to destroy all those who shall\n   have reached a certain fixed age. The arguments put forward\n   to justify so strange a measure I need not here explain at\n   length. It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those\n   who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.\n   This terrible doctrine has been adopted at the advice of\n   an eloquent citizen of the republic, who is at present\n   its President, and whose general popularity seems to be\n   so great, that, in compliance with his views, even this\n   measure will be carried out unless Great Britain shall\n   interfere.\n\n   You are desired to proceed at once to Britannula, to\n   reannex the island, and to assume the duties of the\n   Governor of a Crown colony. It is understood that a year of\n   probation is to be allowed to those victims who have agreed\n   to their own immolation. You will therefore arrive there\n   in ample time to prevent the first bloodshed. But it is\n   surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your\n   entering at once upon your government. So great is the\n   popularity of their President, Mr Neverbend, that, if he be\n   left on the island, your Excellency will find a dangerous\n   rival. It is therefore desired that you should endeavour\n   to obtain information as to his intentions; and that, if\n   the Fixed Period be not abandoned altogether, with a clear\n   conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants\n   generally, you should cause him to be carried away and\n   brought to England.\n\n   To enable you to effect this, Captain Battleax, of H.M.\n   gunboat the John Bright, has been instructed to carry\n   you out. The John Bright is armed with a weapon of great\n   power, against which it is impossible that the people of\n   Britannula should prevail. You will carry out with you 100\n   men of the North-north-west Birmingham regiment, which will\n   probably suffice for your own security, as it is thought\n   that if Mr Neverbend be withdrawn, the people will revert\n   easily to their old habits of obedience.\n\n   In regard to Mr Neverbend himself, it is the especial\n   wish of H.M. Government that he shall be treated with all\n   respect, and that those honours shall be paid to him which\n   are due to the President of a friendly republic. It is to\n   be expected that he should not allow himself to make an\n   enforced visit to England without some opposition; but\n   it is considered in the interests of humanity to be so\n   essential that this scheme of the Fixed Period shall not be\n   carried out, that H.M. Government consider that his absence\n   from Britannula shall be for a time insured. You will\n   therefore insure it; but will take care that, as far as\n   lies in your Excellency's power, he be treated with all\n   that respect and hospitality which would be due to him were\n   he still the President of an allied republic.\n\n   Captain Battleax, of the John Bright, will have received\n   a letter to the same effect from the First Lord of the\n   Admiralty, and you will find him ready to co-operate with\n   your Excellency in every respect.--I have the honour to be,\n   sir, your Excellency's most obedient servant,\n\n   HATFIELD.\n\n\nThis I read with great attention, while they sat silent. \"I\nunderstand it; and that is all, I suppose, that I need say upon the\nsubject. When do you intend that the John Bright shall start?\"\n\n\"We have already lighted our fires, and our sailors are weighing the\nanchors. Will twelve o'clock suit you?\"\n\n\"To-day!\" I shouted.\n\n\"I rather think we must move to-day,\" said the captain.\n\n\"If so, you must be content to take my dead body. It is now nearly\neleven.\"\n\n\"Half-past ten,\" said the captain, looking at his watch.\n\n\"And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the\nGovernment.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to take charge of them,\" said Sir Ferdinando.\n\n\"No doubt,--knowing nothing of the forms of our government, or--\"\n\n\"They, of course, must all be altered.\"\n\n\"Or of the habits of our people. It is quite impossible. I, too, have\nthe complicated affairs of my entire life to arrange, and my wife and\nson to leave though I would not for a moment be supposed to put these\nprivate matters forward when the public service is concerned. But the\ntime you name is so unreasonable as to create a feeling of horror at\nyour tyranny.\"\n\n\"A feeling of horror would be created on the other side of the\nwater,\" said Sir Ferdinando, \"at the idea of what you may do if\nyou escape us. I should not consider my head to be safe on my own\nshoulders were it to come to pass that while I am on the island an\nold man were executed in compliance with your system.\"\n\nAlas! I could not but feel how little he knew of the sentiment which\nprevailed in Britannula; how false was his idea of my power; and how\npotent was that love of life which had been evinced in the city when\nthe hour for deposition had become nigh. All this I could hardly\nexplain to him, as I should thus be giving to him the strongest\nevidence against my own philosophy. And yet it was necessary that\nI should say something to make him understand that this sudden\ndeportation was not necessary. And then during that moment there came\nto me suddenly an idea that it might be well that I should take this\njourney to England, and there begin again my career,--as Columbus,\nafter various obstructions, had recommenced his,--and that I should\nendeavour to carry with me the people of Great Britain, as I\nhad already carried the more quickly intelligent inhabitants of\nBritannula. And in order that I may do so, I have now prepared these\npages, writing them on board H.M. gunboat, the John Bright.\n\n\"Your power is sufficient,\" I said.\n\n\"We are not sure of that,\" said Sir Ferdinando. \"It is always well to\nbe on the safe side.\"\n\n\"Are you so afraid of what a single old man can do,--you with\nyour 250-ton swivellers, and your guard of marines, and your\nNorth-north-west Birmingham soldiery?\"\n\n\"That depends on who and what the old man may be.\" This was the\nfirst complimentary speech which Sir Ferdinando had made, and I\nmust confess that it was efficacious. I did not after that feel so\nstrong a dislike to the man as I had done before. \"We do not wish\nto make ourselves disagreeable to you, Mr Neverbend.\" I shrugged my\nshoulders. \"Unnecessarily disagreeable, I should have said. You are\na man of your word.\" Here I bowed to him. \"If you will give us your\npromise to meet Captain Battleax here at this time to-morrow, we\nwill stretch a point and delay the departure of the John Bright for\ntwenty-four hours.\" To this again I objected violently; and at last,\nas an extreme favour, two entire days were allowed for my departure.\n\nThe craft of men versed in the affairs of the old Eastern world\nis notorious. I afterwards learned that the stokers on board the\nship were only pretending to get up their fires, and the sailors\npretending to weigh their anchors, in order that their operations\nmight be visible, and that I might suppose that I had received a\ngreat favour from my enemies' hands. And this plan was adopted, too,\nin order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.\nAt any rate, I did make the promise, and gave these two gentlemen my\nword that I would be present there in my own room in the executive\nchambers at the same hour on the day but one following.\n\n\"And now,\" said Sir Ferdinando, \"that this matter is settled between\nus, allow me most cordially to shake you by the hand, and to express\nmy great admiration for your character. I cannot say that I agree\nwith you in theory as to the Fixed Period,--my wife and children\ncould not, I am sure, endure to see me led away when a certain day\nshould come,--but I can understand that much may be said on the\npoint, and I admire greatly the eloquence and energy which you have\ndevoted to the matter. I shall be happy to meet you here at any hour\nto-morrow, and to receive the Britannulan archives from your hands.\nYou, Mr Neverbend, will always be regarded as the father of your\ncountry--\n\n\n   'Roma patrem patri\u00c3\u00a6 Ciceronem libera dixit.'\"\n\n\nWith this the two gentlemen left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE TOWN-HALL.\n\n\nWhen I went home and told them what was to be done, they were of\ncourse surprised, but apparently not very unhappy. Mrs Neverbend\nsuggested that she should accompany me, so as to look after my linen\nand other personal comforts. But I told her, whether truly or not I\nhardly then knew, that there would be no room for her on board a ship\nof war such as the John Bright. Since I have lived on board her, I\nhave become aware that they would willingly have accommodated, at my\nrequest, a very much larger family than my own. Mrs Neverbend at once\nwent to work to provide for my enforced absence, and in the course of\nthe day Eva Crasweller came in to help her. Eva's manner to myself\nhad become perfectly altered since the previous morning. Nothing\ncould be more affectionate, more gracious, or more winning, than she\nwas now; and I envied Jack the short moments of _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ retreat\nwhich seemed from time to time to be necessary for carrying out the\narrangements of the day.\n\nI may as well state here, that from this time Abraham Grundle\nshowed himself to be a declared enemy, and that the partnership was\ndissolved between Crasweller and himself. He at once brought an\naction against my old friend for the recovery of that proportion of\nhis property to which he was held to be entitled under our marriage\nlaws. This Mr Crasweller immediately offered to pay him; but some\nof our more respectable lawyers interfered, and persuaded him not\nto make the sacrifice. There then came on a long action, with an\nappeal,--all which was given against Grundle, and nearly ruined the\nGrundles. It seemed to me, as far as I could go into the matter, that\nGrundle had all the law on his side. But there arose certain quibbles\nand questions, all of which Jack had at his fingers'-ends, by the\nstrength of which the unfortunate young man was trounced. As I\nlearned by the letters which Eva wrote to me, Crasweller was all\nthrough most anxious to pay him; but the lawyers would not have it\nso, and therefore so much of the property of Little Christchurch was\nsaved for the ultimate benefit of that happy fellow Jack Neverbend.\n\nOn the afternoon of the one day which, as a matter of grace, had\nbeen allowed to me, Sir Ferdinando declared his intention of making\na speech to the people of Gladstonopolis. \"He was desirous,\" he\nsaid, \"of explaining to the community at large the objects of H.M.\nGovernment in sending him to Britannula, and in requesting the\ninhabitants to revert to their old form of government.\" \"Request\nindeed,\" I said to Crasweller, throwing all possible scorn into the\ntone of my voice,--\"request! with the North-north-west Birmingham\nregiment, and his 250-ton steam-swiveller in the harbour! That\nFerdinando Brown knows how to conceal his claws beneath a velvet\nglove. We are to be slaves,--slaves because England so wills it. We\nare robbed of our constitution, our freedom of action is taken from\nus, and we are reduced to the lamentable condition of a British Crown\ncolony! And all this is to be done because we had striven to rise\nabove the prejudices of the day.\" Crasweller smiled, and said not a\nword to oppose me, and accepted all my indignation with assent; but\nhe certainly did not show any enthusiasm. A happier old gentleman,\nor one more active for his years, I had never known. It was but\nyesterday that I had seen him so absolutely cowed as to be hardly\nable to speak a word. And all this change had occurred simply because\nhe was to be allowed to die out in the open world, instead of\nenjoying the honour of having been the first to depart in conformity\nwith the new theory. He and I, however, spent thus one day longer\nin sweet friendship; and I do not doubt but that, when I return\nto Britannula, I shall find him living in great comfort at Little\nChristchurch.\n\nAt three o'clock we all went into our great town-hall to hear what\nSir Ferdinando had to say to us. The chamber is a very spacious one,\nfitted up with a large organ, and all the arrangements necessary for\na music-hall; but I had never seen a greater crowd than was collected\nthere on this occasion. There was not a vacant corner to be found;\nand I heard that very many of the inhabitants went away greatly\ndispleased in that they could not be accommodated. Sir Ferdinando had\nbeen very particular in asking the attendance of Captain Battleax,\nand as many of the ship's officers as could be spared. This, I was\ntold, he did in order that something of the _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of his oration\nmight be taken back to England. Sir Ferdinando was a man who thought\nmuch of his own eloquence,--and much also of the advantage which he\nmight reap from it in the opinion of his fellow-countrymen generally.\nI found that a place of honour had been reserved for me too at his\nright hand, and also one for my wife at his left. I must confess that\nin these last moments of my sojourn among the people over whom I had\nruled, I was treated with the most distinguished courtesy. But, as\nI continued to say to myself, I was to be banished in a few hours\nas one whose intended cruelties were too abominable to allow of my\nremaining in my own country. On the first seat behind the chair sat\nCaptain Battleax, with four or five of his officers behind him. \"So\nyou have left Lieutenant Crosstrees in charge of your little toy,\" I\nwhispered to Captain Battleax.\n\n\"With a glass,\" he replied, \"by which he will be able to see whether\nyou leave the building. In that case, he will blow us all into\natoms.\"\n\nThen Sir Ferdinando rose to his legs, and began his speech. I had\nnever before heard a specimen of that special oratory to which the\nepithet flowery may be most appropriately applied. It has all the\nfinished polish of England, joined to the fervid imagination of\nIreland. It streams on without a pause, and without any necessary end\nbut that which the convenience of time may dictate. It comes without\nthe slightest effort, and it goes without producing any great effect.\nIt is sweet at the moment. It pleases many, and can offend none. But\nit is hardly afterwards much remembered, and is efficacious only in\nsmoothing somewhat the rough ways of this harsh world. But I have\nobserved that in what I have read of British debates, those who have\nbeen eloquent after this fashion are generally firm to some purpose\nof self-interest. Sir Ferdinando had on this occasion dressed himself\nwith minute care; and though he had for the hour before been very\nsedulous in manipulating certain notes, he now was careful to show\nnot a scrap of paper; and I must do him the justice to declare that\nhe spun out the words from the reel of his memory as though they all\ncame spontaneous and pat to his tongue.\n\n\"Mr Neverbend,\" he said, \"ladies and gentlemen,--I have to-day for\nthe first time the great pleasure of addressing an intelligent\nconcourse of citizens in Britannula. I trust that before my\nacquaintance with this prosperous community may be brought to an end,\nI may have many another opportunity afforded me of addressing you. It\nhas been my lot in life to serve my Sovereign in various parts of the\nworld, and humbly to represent the throne of England in every quarter\nof the globe. But by the admitted testimony of all people,--my\nfellow-countrymen at home in England, and those who are equally my\nfellow-countrymen in the colonies to which I have been sent,--it is\nacknowledged that in prosperity, intelligence, and civilisation, you\nare excelled by no English-speaking section of the world. And if by\nnone who speak English, who shall then aspire to excel you? Such,\nas I have learned, has been the common verdict given; and as I look\nround this vast room, on a spot which fifty years ago the marsupial\nraces had under their own dominion, and see the feminine beauty and\nmanly grace which greet me on every side, I can well believe that\nsome peculiarly kind freak of nature has been at work, and has tended\nto produce a people as strong as it is beautiful, and as clever in\nits wit as it is graceful in its actions.\" Here the speaker paused,\nand the audience all clapped their hands and stamped their feet,\nwhich seemed to me to be a very improper mode of testifying their\nassent to their own praises. But Sir Ferdinando took it all in good\npart, and went on with his speech.\n\n\"I have been sent here, ladies and gentlemen, on a peculiar\nmission,--on a duty as to which, though I am desirous of explaining\nit to all of you in every detail, I feel a difficulty of saying a\nsingle word.\" \"Fixed Period,\" was shouted from one of the balconies\nin a voice which I recognised as that of Mr Tallowax. \"My friend\nin the gallery,\" continued Sir Ferdinando, \"reminds me of the very\nword for which I should in vain have cudgelled my brain. The Fixed\nPeriod is the subject on which I am called upon to say to you a few\nwords;--the Fixed Period, and the man who has, I believe, been among\nyou the chief author of that system of living,--and if I may be\npermitted to say so, of dying also.\" Here the orator allowed his\nvoice to fade away in a melancholy cadence, while he turned his face\ntowards me, and with a gentle motion laid his right hand upon my\nshoulder. \"Oh, my friends, it is, to say the least of it, a startling\nproject.\" \"Uncommon, if it was your turn next,\" said Tallowax in the\ngallery. \"Yes, indeed,\" continued Sir Ferdinando, \"if it were my\nturn next! I must own, that though I should consider myself to be\naffronted if I were told that I were faint-hearted,--though I should\nknow myself to be maligned if it were said of me that I have a\ncoward's fear of death,--still I should feel far from comfortable if\nthat age came upon me which this system has defined, and were I to\nlive in a country in which it has prevailed. Though I trust that I\nmay be able to meet death like a brave man when it may come, still I\nshould wish that it might come by God's hand, and not by the wisdom\nof a man.\n\n\"I have nothing to say against the wisdom of that man,\" continued\nhe, turning to me again. \"I know all the arguments with which he\nhas fortified himself. They have travelled even as far as my ears;\nbut I venture to use the experience which I have gathered in many\ncountries, and to tell him that in accordance with God's purposes the\nworld is not as yet ripe for his wisdom.\" I could not help thinking\nas he spoke thus, that he was not perhaps acquainted with all the\narguments on which my system of the Fixed Period was founded; and\nthat if he would do me the honour to listen to a few words which I\nproposed to speak to the people of Britannula before I left them,\nhe would have clearer ideas about it than had ever yet entered into\nhis mind. \"Oh, my friends,\" said he, rising to the altitudes of his\neloquence, \"it is fitting for us that we should leave these things in\nthe hands of the Almighty. It is fitting for us, at any rate, that we\nshould do so till we have been brought by Him to a state of god-like\nknowledge infinitely superior to that which we at present possess.\"\nHere I could perceive that Sir Ferdinando was revelling in the sounds\nof his own words, and that he had prepared and learnt by heart the\ntones of his voice, and even the motion of his hands. \"We all know\nthat it is not allowed to us to rush into His presence by any deed of\nour own. You all remember what the poet says,--\n\n\n   'Or that the Everlasting had not fixed\n    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!'\n\n\nIs not this self-slaughter, this theory in accordance with which a\nman shall devote himself to death at a certain period? And if a man\nmay not slay himself, how shall he then, in the exercise of his poor\nhuman wit, devote a fellow-creature to certain death?\" \"And he as\nwell as ever he was in his life,\" said Tallowax in the gallery.\n\n\"My friend does well to remind me. Though Mr Neverbend has named a\nFixed Period for human life, and has perhaps chosen that at which its\nenergies may usually be found to diminish, who can say that he has\neven approached the certainty of that death which the Lord sends\nupon us all at His own period? The poor fellow to whom nature has\nbeen unkind, departs from us decrepit and worn out at forty; whereas\nanother at seventy is still hale and strong in performing the daily\nwork of his life.\"\n\n\"I am strong enough to do a'most anything for myself, and I was to\nbe the next to go,--the very next.\" This in a treble voice came from\nthat poor fellow Barnes, who had suffered nearly the pangs of death\nitself from the Fixed Period.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; in answer to such an appeal as that, who shall venture\nto say that the Fixed Period shall be carried out with all its\nstartling audacity? The tenacity of purpose which distinguishes our\nfriend here is known to us all. The fame of his character in that\nrespect had reached my ears even among the thick-lipped inhabitants\nof Central Africa.\" I own I did wonder whether this could be true.\n\"'Justum et tenacem propositi virum!' Nothing can turn him from his\npurpose, or induce him to change his inflexible will. You know him,\nand I know him, and he is well known throughout England. Persuasion\ncan never touch him; fear has no power over him. He, as one unit, is\nstrong against a million. He is invincible, imperturbable, and ever\nself-assured.\"\n\nI, as I sat there listening to this character of myself, heroic\nsomewhat, but utterly unlike the person for whom it was intended,\nfelt that England knew very little about me, and cared less; and\nI could not but be angry that my name should be used in this\nway to adorn the sentences of Sir Ferdinando's speech. Here in\nGladstonopolis I was well known,--and well known to be neither\nimperturbable nor self-assured. But all the people seemed to accept\nwhat he said, and I could not very well interrupt him. He had his\nopportunity now, and I perhaps might have mine by-and-by.\n\n\"My friends,\" continued Sir Ferdinando, \"at home in England, where,\nthough we are powerful by reason of our wealth and numbers--\" \"Just\nso,\" said I. \"Where we are powerful, I repeat, by reason of our\nwealth and numbers, though perhaps less advanced than you are in\nthe philosophical arrangements of life, it has seemed to us to be\nimpossible that the theory should be allowed to be carried to its\nlegitimate end. The whole country would be horrified were one life\nsacrificed to this theory.\" \"We knew that,--we knew that,\" said the\nvoice of Tallowax. \"And yet your Assembly had gone so far as to give\nto the system all the stability of law. Had not the John Bright\nsteamed into your harbour yesterday, one of your most valued citizens\nwould have been already--deposited.\" When he had so spoken, he turned\nround to Mr Crasweller, who was sitting on my right hand, and bowed\nto him. Crasweller looked straight before him, and took no notice of\nSir Ferdinando. He was at the present moment rather on my side of the\nquestion, and having had his freedom secured to him, did not care for\nSir Ferdinando.\n\n\"But that has been prevented, thanks to the extraordinary rapidity\nwith which my excellent friend Captain Battleax has made his way\nacross the ocean. And I must say that every one of these excellent\nfellows, his officers, has done his best to place H.M. ship the John\nBright in her commanding position with the least possible delay.\"\nHere he turned round and bowed to the officers, and by keen eyes\nmight have been observed to bow through the windows also to the\nvessel, which lay a mile off in the harbour. \"There will not, at\nany rate for the present, be any Fixed Period for human life in\nBritannula. That dream has been dreamed,--at any rate for the\npresent. Whether in future ages such a philosophy may prevail, who\nshall say? At present we must all await our death from the hands of\nthe Almighty. 'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.'\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, I have to request your attention for a few\nmoments to another matter, and one which is very different from this\nwhich we have discussed. I am to say a few words of the past and\nthe present,--of your past constitution, and of that which it is my\npurpose to inaugurate.\" Here there arose a murmur through the room\nvery audible, and threatening by its sounds to disturb the orator. \"I\nwill ask your favour for a few minutes; and when you shall have heard\nme to-day, I will in my turn hear you to-morrow. Great Britain at\nyour request surrendered to you the power of self-government. To\nso small an English-speaking community has this never before been\ngranted. And I am bound to say that you have in many respects shown\nyourselves fit for the responsibility imposed upon you. You have been\nintelligent, industrious, and prudent. Ignorance has been expelled\nfrom your shores, and poverty has been forced to hide her diminished\nhead.\" Here the orator paused to receive that applause which he\nconceived to be richly his due; but the occupants of the benches\nbefore him sat sternly silent. There were many there who had been\nglad to see a ship of war come in to stop the Fixed Period, but\nhardly one who was pleased to lose his own independence. \"But though\nthat is so,\" said Sir Ferdinando, a little nettled at the want of\nadmiration with which his words had been received, \"H.M. Government\nis under the necessity of putting an end to the constitution under\nwhich the Fixed Period can be allowed to prevail. While you have made\nlaws for yourselves, any laws so made must have all the force of\nlaw.\" \"That's not so certain,\" said a voice from a distance, which I\nshrewdly suspect to have been that of my hopeful son, Jack Neverbend.\n\"As Great Britain cannot and will not permit the Fixed Period to be\ncarried out among any English-speaking race of people--\"\n\n\"How about the United States?\" said a voice.\n\n\"The United States have made no such attempt; but I will proceed. It\nhas therefore sent me out to assume the reins, and to undertake the\npower, and to bear the responsibility of being your governor during a\nshort term of years. Who shall say what the future may disclose? For\nthe present I shall rule here. But I shall rule by the aid of your\nlaws.\"\n\n\"Not the Fixed Period law,\" said Exors, who was seated on the floor\nof the chamber immediately under the orator.\n\n\"No; that law will be specially wiped out from your statute-book. In\nother respects, your laws and those of Great Britain are nearly the\nsame. There may be divergences, as in reference to the non-infliction\nof capital punishment. In such matters I shall endeavour to follow\nyour wishes, and so to govern you that you may still feel that you\nare living under the rule of a president of your own selection.\" Here\nI cannot but think that Sir Ferdinando was a little rash. He did not\nquite know the extent of my popularity, nor had he gauged the dislike\nwhich he himself would certainly encounter. He had heard a few voices\nin the hall, which, under fear of death, had expressed their dislike\nto the Fixed Period; but he had no idea of the love which the people\nfelt for their own independence, or,--I believe I may say,--for their\nown president. There arose in the hall a certain amount of clamour,\nin the midst of which Sir Ferdinando sat down.\n\nThen there was a shuffling of feet as of a crowd going away. Sir\nFerdinando having sat down, got up again and shook me warmly by the\nhand. I returned his greeting with my pleasantest smile; and then,\nwhile the people were moving, I spoke to them two or three words. I\ntold them that I should start to-morrow at noon for England, under\na promise made by me to their new governor, and that I purposed to\nexplain to them, before I went, under what circumstances I had given\nthat promise, and what it was that I intended to do when I should\nreach England. Would they meet me there, in that hall, at eight\no'clock that evening, and hear the last words which I should have\nto address to them? Then the hall was filled with a mighty shout,\nand there arose a great fury of exclamation. There was a waving of\nhandkerchiefs, and a holding up of hats, and all those signs of\nenthusiasm which are wont to greet the popular man of the hour. And\nin the midst of them, Sir Ferdinando Brown stood up upon his legs,\nand continued to bow without cessation.\n\nAt eight, the hall was again full to overflowing. I had been busy,\nand came down a little late, and found a difficulty in making my way\nto the chair which Sir Ferdinando had occupied in the morning. I\nhad had no time to prepare my words, though the thoughts had rushed\nquickly,--too quickly,--into my mind. It was as though they would\ntumble out from my own mouth in precipitate energy. On my right hand\nsat the governor, as I must now call him; and in the chair on my left\nwas placed my wife. The officers of the gunboat were not present,\nhaving occupied themselves, no doubt, in banking up their fires.\n\n\"My fellow-citizens,\" I said, \"a sudden end has been brought to\nthat self-government of which we have been proud, and by which Sir\nFerdinando has told you that 'ignorance has been expelled from your\nshores, and poverty has been forced to hide her diminished head.' I\ntrust that, under his experience, which he tells us as a governor has\nbeen very extensive, those evils may not now fall upon you. We are,\nhowever, painfully aware that they do prevail wherever the concrete\npower of Great Britain is found to be in full force. A man ruling\nus,--us and many other millions of subjects,--from the other side of\nthe globe, cannot see our wants and watch our progress as we can\ndo ourselves. And even Sir Ferdinando coming upon us with all his\nexperience, can hardly be able to ascertain how we may be made happy\nand prosperous. He has with him, however, a company of a celebrated\nEnglish regiment, with its attendant officers, who, by their red\ncoats and long swords, will no doubt add to the cheerfulness of your\nsocial gatherings. I hope that you may not find that they shall ever\ninterfere with you after a rougher fashion.\n\n\"But upon me, my fellow-citizens, has fallen the great disgrace of\nhaving robbed you of your independence.\" Here a murmur ran through\nthe hall, declaring that this was not so. \"So your new Governor\nhas told you, but he has not told you the exact truth. With whom\nthe doctrine of the Fixed Period first originated, I will not now\ninquire. All the responsibility I will take upon myself, though the\nhonour and glory I must share with my fellow-countrymen.\n\n\"Your Governor has told you that he is aware of all the arguments by\nwhich the Fixed Period is maintained; but I think that he must be\nmistaken here, as he has not ventured to attack one of them. He has\ntold us that it is fitting that we should leave the question of life\nand death in the hands of the Almighty. If so, why is all Europe\nbristling at this moment with arms,--prepared, as we must suppose,\nfor shortening life,--and why is there a hangman attached to the\nthrone of Great Britain as one of its necessary executive officers?\nWhy in the Old Testament was Joshua commanded to slay mighty kings?\nAnd why was Pharaoh and his hosts drowned in the Red Sea? Because the\nAlmighty so willed it, our Governor will say, taking it for granted\nthat He willed everything of which a record is given in the Old\nTestament. In those battles which have ravished the North-west of\nIndia during the last half-century, did the Almighty wish that men\nshould perish miserably by ten thousands and twenty thousands? Till\nany of us can learn more than we know at present of the will of the\nAlmighty, I would, if he will allow me, advise our Governor to be\nsilent on that head.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it would be a long task, and one not to be\naccomplished before your bedtime, were I to recount to you, for his\nadvantage, a few of the arguments which have been used in favour of\nthe Fixed Period,--and it would be useless, as you are all acquainted\nwith them. But Sir Ferdinando is evidently not aware that the\ngeneral prolongation of life on an average, is one of the effects\nto be gained, and that, though he himself might not therefore live\nthe longer if doomed to remain here in Britannula, yet would his\ndescendants do so, and would live a life more healthy, more useful,\nand more sufficient for human purposes.\n\n\"As far as I can read the will of the Almighty, or rather the\nprogress of the ways of human nature, it is for man to endeavour to\nimprove the conditions of mankind. It would be as well to say that we\nwould admit no fires into our establishments because a life had now\nand again been lost by fire, as to use such an argument as that now\nput forward against the Fixed Period. If you will think of the line\nof reasoning used by Sir Ferdinando, you will remember that he has,\nafter all, only thrown you back upon the old prejudices of mankind.\nIf he will tell me that he is not as yet prepared to discard them,\nand that I am in error in thinking that the world is so prepared,\nI may perhaps agree with him. The John Bright in our harbour is\nthe strongest possible proof that such prejudices still exist. Sir\nFerdinando Brown is now your Governor, a fact which in itself is\nstrong evidence. In opposition to these witnesses I have nothing to\nsay. The ignorance which we are told that we had expelled from our\nshores, has come back to us; and the poverty is about, I fear, to\nshow its head.\" Sir Ferdinando here arose and expostulated. But the\npeople hardly heard him, and at my request he again sat down.\n\n\"I do think that I have endeavoured in this matter to advance too\nquickly, and that Sir Ferdinando has been sent here as the necessary\nreprimand for that folly. He has required that I shall be banished\nto England; and as his order is backed by a double file of\nred-coats,--an instrument which in Britannula we do not possess,--I\npurpose to obey him. I shall go to England, and I shall there use\nwhat little strength remains to me in my endeavour to put forward\nthose arguments for conquering the prejudices of the people which\nhave prevailed here, but which I am very sure would have no effect\nupon Sir Ferdinando Brown.\n\n\"I cannot but think that Sir Ferdinando gave himself unnecessary\ntrouble in endeavouring to prove to us that the Fixed Period is a\nwicked arrangement. He was not likely to succeed in that attempt. But\nhe was sure to succeed in telling us that he would make it impossible\nby means of the double file of armed men by whom he is accompanied,\nand the 250-ton steam-swiveller with which, as he informed me, he is\nable to blow us all into atoms, unless I would be ready to start with\nCaptain Battleax to-morrow. It is not his religion but his strength\nthat has prevailed. That Great Britain is much stronger than\nBritannula none of us can doubt. Till yesterday I did doubt whether\nshe would use her strength to perpetuate her own prejudices and to\nput down the progress made by another people.\n\n\"But, fellow-citizens, we must look the truth in the face. In this\ngeneration probably, the Fixed Period must be allowed to be in\nabeyance.\" When I had uttered these words there came much cheering\nand a loud sound of triumph, which was indorsed probably by the\npostponement of the system, which had its terrors; but I was enabled\nto accept these friendly noises as having been awarded to the system\nitself. \"Well, as you all love the Fixed Period, it must be delayed\ntill Sir Ferdinando and the English have--been converted.\"\n\n\"Never, never!\" shouted Sir Ferdinando; \"so godless an idea shall\nnever find a harbour in this bosom,\" and he struck his chest\nviolently.\n\n\"Sir Ferdinando is probably not aware to what ideas that bosom may\nsome day give a shelter. If he will look back thirty years, he will\nfind that he had hardly contemplated even the weather-watch which he\nnow wears constantly in his waistcoat-pocket. At the command of his\nSovereign he may still live to carry out the Fixed Period somewhere\nin the centre of Africa.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"In what college among the negroes he may be deposited, it may be\ntoo curious to inquire. I, my friends, shall leave these shores\nto-morrow; and you may be sure of this, that while the power of\nlabour remains to me, I shall never desist to work for the purpose\nthat I have at heart. I trust that I may yet live to return among\nyou, and to render you an account of what I have done for you and\nfor the cause in Europe.\" Here I sat down, and was greeted by the\ndeafening applause of the audience; and I did feel at the moment that\nI had somewhat got the better of Sir Ferdinando.\n\nI have been able to give the exact words of these two speeches, as\nthey were both taken down by the reporting telephone-apparatus, which\non the occasion was found to work with great accuracy. The words as\nthey fell from the mouth of the speakers were composed by machinery,\nand my speech appeared in the London morning newspapers within an\nhour of the time of its utterance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nFAREWELL!\n\n\nI went home to my house in triumph; but I had much to do before noon\non the following day, but very little time in which to do it. I had\nspent the morning of that day in preparing for my departure, and\nin so arranging matters with my clerks that the entrance of Sir\nFerdinando on his new duties might be easy. I had said nothing, and\nhad endeavoured to think as little as possible, of the Fixed Period.\nAn old secretary of mine,--old in years of work, though not as yet in\nage,--had endeavoured to comfort me by saying that the college up the\nhill might still be used before long. But I had told him frankly that\nwe in Britannula had all been too much in a hurry, and had foolishly\nendeavoured to carry out a system in opposition to the world's\nprejudices, which system, when successful, must pervade the entire\nworld. \"And is nothing to be done with those beautiful buildings?\"\nsaid the secretary, putting in the word beautiful by way of flattery\nto myself. \"The chimneys and the furnaces may perhaps be used,\"\nI replied. \"Cremation is no part of the Fixed Period. But as for\nthe residences, the less we think about them the better.\" And so I\ndetermined to trouble my thoughts no further with the college. And\nI felt that there might be some consolation to me in going away to\nEngland, so that I might escape from the great vexation and eyesore\nwhich the empty college would have produced.\n\nBut I had to bid farewell to my wife and my son, and to Eva and\nCrasweller. The first task would be the easier, because there would\nbe no necessity for any painful allusion to my own want of success.\nIn what little I might say to Mrs Neverbend on the subject, I could\ncontinue that tone of sarcastic triumph in which I had replied to\nSir Ferdinando. What was pathetic in the matter I might altogether\nignore. And Jack was himself so happy in his nature, and so little\nlikely to look at anything on its sorrowful side, that all would\nsurely go well with him. But with Eva, and with Eva's father, things\nwould be different. Words must be spoken which would be painful in\nthe speaking, and regrets must be uttered by me which could not\ncertainly be shared by him. \"I am broken down and trampled upon, and\nall the glory is departed from my name, and I have become a byword\nand a reproach rather than a term of honour in which future ages may\nrejoice, because I have been unable to carry out my long-cherished\npurpose by--depositing you, and insuring at least your departure!\"\nAnd then Crasweller would answer me with his general kindly feeling,\nand I should feel at the moment of my leaving him the hollowness of\nhis words. I had loved him the better because I had endeavoured to\ncommence my experiment on his body. I had felt a vicarious regard\nfor the honour which would have been done him, almost regarding it\nas though I myself were to go in his place. All this had received a\ncheck when he in his weakness had pleaded for another year. But he\nhad yielded; and though he had yielded without fortitude, he had done\nso to comply with my wishes, and I could not but feel for the man an\nextraordinary affection. I was going to England, and might probably\nnever see him again; and I was going with aspirations in my heart so\nvery different from those which he entertained!\n\nFrom the hours intended for slumber, a few minutes could be taken for\nsaying adieu to my wife. \"My dear,\" said I, \"this is all very sudden.\nBut a man engaged in public life has to fit himself to the public\ndemands. Had I not promised to go to-day, I might have been taken\naway yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n\"Oh, John,\" said she, \"I think that everything has been put up to\nmake you comfortable.\"\n\n\"Thanks; yes, I'm sure of it. When you hear my name mentioned after\nI am gone, I hope that they'll say of me that I did my duty as\nPresident of the republic.\"\n\n\"Of course they will. Every day you have been at these nasty\nexecutive chambers from nine till five, unless when you've been\nsitting in that wretched Assembly.\"\n\n\"I shall have a holiday now, at any rate,\" said I, laughing gently\nunder the bedclothes.\n\n\"Yes; and I am sure it will do you good, if you only take your meals\nregular. I sometimes think that you have been encouraged to dwell\nupon this horrid Fixed Period by the melancholy of an empty stomach.\"\n\nIt was sad to hear such words from her lips after the two speeches to\nwhich she had listened, and to feel that no trace had been left on\nher mind of the triumph which I had achieved over Sir Ferdinando; but\nI put up with that, and determined to answer her after her own heart.\n\"You have always provided a sandwich for me to take to the chambers.\"\n\n\"Sandwiches are nothing. Do remember that. At your time of life you\nshould always have something warm,--a frizzle or a cutlet, and you\nshouldn't eat it without thinking of it. What has made me hate the\nFixed Period worse than anything is, that you have never thought of\nyour victuals. You gave more attention to the burning of these pigs\nthan to the cooking of any food in your own kitchen.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I'm going to England now,\" said I, beginning to feel\nweary of her reminiscences.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I know you are; and do remember that as you get nearer\nand nearer to that chilly country the weather will always be colder\nand colder. I have put you up four pairs of flannel drawers, and a\nlittle bag which you must wear upon your chest. I observed that Sir\nFerdinando, when he was preparing himself for his speech, showed that\nhe had just such a little bag on. And all the time I endeavoured to\nspy how it was that he wore it. When I came home I immediately went\nto work, and I shall insist on your putting it on the first thing\nin the morning, in order that I may see that it sits flat. Sir\nFerdinando's did not sit flat, and it looked bulgy. I thought to\nmyself that Lady Brown did not do her duty properly by him. If you\nwould allow me to come with you, I could see that you always put it\non rightly. As it is, I know that people will say that it is all my\nfault when it hangs out and shows itself.\" Then I went to sleep, and\nthe parting words between me and my wife had been spoken.\n\nEarly on the following morning I had Jack into my dressing-room, and\nsaid good-bye to him. \"Jack,\" said I, \"in this little contest which\nthere has been between us, you have got the better in everything.\"\n\n\"Nobody thought so when they heard your answer to Sir Ferdinando last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I think I managed to answer him. But I haven't got the\nbetter of you.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean anything,\" said Jack, in a melancholy tone of voice.\n\"It was all Eva's doing. I never cared twopence whether the old\nfellows were deposited or not, but I do think that if your own time\nhad come near, I shouldn't have liked it much.\"\n\n\"Why not? why not? If you will only think of the matter all round,\nyou will find that it is all a false sentiment.\"\n\n\"I should not like it,\" said Jack, with determination.\n\n\"Yes, you would, after you had got used to it.\" Here he looked very\nincredulous. \"What I mean is, Jack, that when sons were accustomed\nto see their fathers deposited at a certain age, and were aware that\nthey were treated with every respect, that kind of feeling which\nyou describe would wear off. You would have the idea that a kind of\nhonour was done to your parents.\"\n\n\"When I knew that somebody was going to kill him on the next day, how\nwould it be then?\"\n\n\"You might retire for a few hours to your thoughts,--going into\nmourning, as it were.\" Jack shook his head. \"But, at any rate, in\nthis matter of Mr Crasweller you have got the better of me.\"\n\n\"That was for Eva's sake.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. But I wish to make you understand, now that I am going\nto England, and may possibly never return to these shores again--\"\n\n\"Don't say that, father.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I shall have much to do there, and of course it may be\nthat I shall not come back, and I wish you to understand that I do\nnot part from you in the least in anger. What you have done shows a\nhigh spirit, and great devotion to the girl.\"\n\n\"It was not quite altogether for Eva either.\"\n\n\"What then?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Well, I don't know. The two things went together, as it were. If\nthere had been no question about the Fixed Period, I do think I could\nhave cut out Abraham Grundle. And as for Sir Kennington Oval, I am\nbeginning to believe that that was all Eva's pretence. I like Sir\nKennington, but Eva never cared a button for him. She had taken to\nme because I had shown myself an anti-Fixed-Period man. I did it at\nfirst simply because I hated Grundle. Grundle wanted to fix-period\nold Crasweller for the sake of the property; and therefore I belonged\nnaturally to the other side. It wasn't that I liked opposing you. If\nit had been Tallowax that you were to begin with, or Exors, you might\nhave burnt 'em up without a word from me.\"\n\n\"I am gratified at hearing that.\"\n\n\"Though the Fixed Period does seem to be horrible, I would have\nswallowed all that at your bidding. But you can see how I tumbled\ninto it, and how Eva egged me on, and how the nearer the thing came\nthe more I was bound to fight. Will you believe it?--Eva swore a most\nsolemn oath, that if her father was put into that college she would\nnever marry a human being. And up to that moment when the lieutenant\nmet us at the top of the hill, she was always as cold as snow.\"\n\n\"And now the snow is melted?\"\n\n\"Yes,--that is to say, it is beginning to thaw!\" As he said this I\nremembered the kiss behind the parlour-door which had been given to\nher by another suitor before these troubles began, and my impression\nthat Jack had seen it also; but on that subject I said nothing. \"Of\ncourse it has all been very happy for me,\" Jack continued; \"but I\nwish to say to you before you go, how unhappy it makes me to think\nthat I have opposed you.\"\n\n\"All right, Jack; all right. I will not say that I should not have\ndone the same at your age, if Eva had asked me. I wish you always to\nremember that we parted as friends. It will not be long before you\nare married now.\"\n\n\"Three months,\" said Jack, in a melancholy tone.\n\n\"In an affair of importance of this kind, that is the same as\nto-morrow. I shall not be here to wish you joy at your wedding.\"\n\n\"Why are you to go if you don't wish it?\"\n\n\"I promised that I would go when Captain Battleax talked of carrying\nme off the day before yesterday. With a hundred soldiers, no doubt he\ncould get me on board.\"\n\n\"There are a great many more than a hundred men in Britannula as good\nas their soldiers. To take a man away by force, and he the President\nof the republic! Such a thing was never heard of. I would not stir if\nI were you. Say the word to me, and I will undertake that not one of\nthese men shall touch you.\"\n\nI thought of his proposition; and the more I thought of it, the more\nunreasonable it did appear that I, who had committed no offence\nagainst any law, should be forced on board the John Bright. And I\nhad no doubt that Jack would be as good as his word. But there were\ntwo causes which persuaded me that I had better go. I had pledged\nmy word. When it had been suggested that I should at the moment be\ncarried on board,--which might no doubt then have been done by the\nsoldiers,--I had said that if a certain time were allowed me I would\nagain be found in the same place. If I were simply there, and were\nsurrounded by a crowd of Britannulans ready to fight for me, I should\nhardly have kept my promise. But a stronger reason than this perhaps\nactuated me. It would be better for me for a while to be in England\nthan in Britannula. Here in Britannula I should be the ex-President\nof an abolished republic, and as such subject to the notice of all\nmen; whereas in England I should be nobody, and should escape the\nconstant mortification of seeing Sir Ferdinando Brown. And then\nin England I could do more for the Fixed Period than at home in\nBritannula. Here the battle was over, and I had been beaten. I began\nto perceive that the place was too small for making the primary\nefforts in so great a cause. The very facility which had existed for\nthe passing of the law through the Assembly had made it impossible\nfor us to carry out the law; and therefore, with the sense of\nfailure strong upon me, I should be better elsewhere than at home.\nAnd the desire of publishing a book in which I should declare\nmy theory,--this very book which I have so nearly brought to a\nclose,--made me desire to go. What could I do by publishing anything\nin Britannula? And though the manuscript might have been sent home,\nwho would see it through the press with any chance of success? Now\nI have my hopes, which I own seem high, and I shall be able to watch\nfrom day to day the way in which my arguments in favour of the Fixed\nPeriod are received by the British public. Therefore it was that I\nrejected Jack's kind offer. \"No, my boy,\" said I, after a pause, \"I\ndo not know but that on the whole I shall prefer to go.\"\n\n\"Of course if you wish it.\"\n\n\"I shall be taken there at the expense of the British public, which\nis in itself a triumph, and shall, I presume, be sent back in the\nsame way. If not, I shall have a grievance in their parsimony, which\nin itself will be a comfort to me; and I am sure that I shall be\ntreated well on board. Sir Ferdinando with his eloquence will not be\nthere, and the officers are, all of them, good fellows. I have made\nup my mind, and I will go. The next that you will hear of your father\nwill be the publication of a little book that I shall write on the\njourney, advocating the Fixed Period. The matter has never been\nexplained to them in England, and perhaps my words may prevail.\"\nJack, by shaking his head mournfully, seemed to indicate his idea\nthat this would not be the case; but Jack is resolute, and will never\nyield on any point. Had he been in my place, and had entertained my\nconvictions, I believe that he would have deposited Crasweller in\nspite of Sir Ferdinando Brown and Captain Battleax. \"You will come\nand see me on board, Jack, when I start.\"\n\n\"They won't take me off, will they?\"\n\n\"I should have thought you would have liked to have seen England.\"\n\n\"And leave Eva! They'd have to look very sharp before they could do\nthat. But of course I'll come.\" Then I gave him my blessing, told\nhim what arrangements I had made for his income, and went down to my\nbreakfast, which was to be my last meal in Britannula.\n\nWhen that was over, I was told that Eva was in my study waiting to\nsee me. I had intended to have gone out to Little Christchurch, and\nshould still do so, to bid farewell to her father. But I was not\nsorry to have Eva here in my own house, as she was about to become my\ndaughter-in-law. \"Eva has come to bid you good-bye,\" said Jack, who\nwas already in the room, as I entered it.\n\n\"Eva, my dear,\" said I.\n\n\"I'll leave you,\" said Jack. \"But I've told her that she must be very\nfond of you. Bygones have to be bygones,--particularly as no harm has\nbeen done.\" Then he left the room.\n\nShe still had on the little round hat, but as Jack went she laid it\naside. \"Oh, Mr Neverbend,\" she said, \"I hope you do not think that I\nhave been unkind.\"\n\n\"It is I, my dear, who should express that hope.\"\n\n\"I have always known how well you have loved my dear father. I have\nbeen quite sure of it. And he has always said so. But--\"\n\n\"Well, Eva, it is all over now.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, and I am so happy! I have got to tell you how happy I am.\"\n\n\"I hope you love Jack.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, and in a moment she was in my arms and I was\nkissing her. \"If you knew how I hate that Mr Grundle; and Jack is\nall,--all that he ought to be. One of the things that makes me like\nhim best is his great affection for you. There is nothing that he\nwould not do for you.\"\n\n\"He is a very good young man,\" said I, thinking of the manner in\nwhich he had spoken against me on the Town Flags.\n\n\"Nothing!\" said Eva.\n\n\"And nothing that he would not do for you, my dear. But that is all\nas it should be. He is a high-spirited, good boy; and if he will\nthink a little more of the business and a little less of cricket, he\nwill make an excellent husband.\"\n\n\"Of course he had to think a little of the match when the Englishmen\nwere here; and he did play well, did he not? He beat them all there.\"\nI could perceive that Eva was quite as intent upon cricket as was her\nlover, and probably thought just as little about the business. \"But,\nMr Neverbend, must you really go?\"\n\n\"I think so. It is not only that they are determined to take me, but\nthat I am myself anxious to be in England.\"\n\n\"You wish to--to preach the Fixed Period?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I have got my own notions, which at my time of life I\ncannot lay aside. I shall endeavour to ventilate them in England, and\nsee what the people there may say about them.\"\n\n\"You are not angry with me?\"\n\n\"My child, how could I be angry with you? What you did, you did for\nyour father's sake.\"\n\n\"And papa? You will not be angry with papa because he didn't want to\ngive up Little Christchurch, and to leave the pretty place which he\nhas made himself, and to go into the college,--and be killed!\"\n\nI could not quite answer her at the moment, because in truth I was\nsomewhat angry with him. I thought that he should have understood\nthat there was something higher to be achieved than an extra year or\ntwo among the prettinesses of Little Christchurch. I could not but\nbe grieved because he had proved himself to be less of a man than I\nhad expected. But as I remained silent for a few moments, Eva held\nmy hand in hers, and looked up into my face with beseeching eyes.\nThen my anger went, and I remembered that I had no reason to expect\nheroism from Crasweller, simply because he had been my friend. \"No,\ndear, no; all feeling of anger is at an end. It was natural that he\nshould wish to remain at Little Christchurch; and it was better than\nnatural, it was beautiful, that you should wish to save him by the\nuse of the only feminine weapon at your command.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I did love Jack,\" she said.\n\n\"I have still an hour or two before I depart, and I shall run down to\nLittle Christchurch to take your father by the hand once more. You\nmay be sure that what I shall say to him will not be ill-natured. And\nnow good-bye, my darling child. My time here in Britannula is but\nshort, and I cannot give up more of it even to my chosen daughter.\"\nThen again she kissed me, and putting on her little hat, went away to\nMrs Neverbend,--or to Jack.\n\nIt was now nearly ten o'clock, and I had out my tricycle in order to\ngo down as quickly as possible to Little Christchurch. At the door of\nmy house I found a dozen of the English soldiers with a sergeant. He\ntouched his hat, and asked me very civilly where I was going. When I\ntold him that it was but five or six miles out of town, he requested\nmy permission to accompany me. I told him that he certainly might\nif he had a vehicle ready, and was ready to use it. But as at that\nmoment my luggage was brought out of the house with the view of being\ntaken on board ship, the man thought that it would be as well and\nmuch easier to follow the luggage; and the twelve soldiers marched\noff to see my portmanteaus put safely on board the John Bright.\n\nAnd I was again,--and I could not but say to myself, probably for the\nlast time,--once again on the road to Little Christchurch. During\nthe twenty minutes which were taken in going down there, I could\nnot but think of the walks I had had up and down with Crasweller in\nold times, talking as we went of the glories of a Fixed Period, and\nof the absolute need which the human race had for such a step in\ncivilisation. Probably on such occasions the majority of the words\nspoken had come from my own mouth; but it had seemed to me then that\nCrasweller had been as energetic as myself. The period which we\nhad then contemplated at a distance had come round, and Crasweller\nhad seceded wofully. I could not but feel that had he been stanch\nto me, and allowed himself to be deposited not only willingly but\njoyfully, he would have set an example which could not but have been\nefficacious. Barnes and Tallowax would probably have followed as a\nmatter of course, and the thing would have been done. My name would\nhave gone down to posterity with those of Columbus and Galileo,\nand Britannula would have been noted as the most prominent among\nthe nations of the earth, instead of having become a by-word among\ncountries as a deprived republic and reannexed Crown colony. But all\nthat on the present occasion had to be forgotten, and I was to greet\nmy old friend with true affection, as though I had received from his\nhands no such ruthless ruin of all my hopes.\n\n\"Oh, Mr President,\" he said, as he met me coming up the drive towards\nthe house, \"this is kind of you. And you who must be so busy just\nbefore your departure!\"\n\n\"I could not go without a word of farewell to you.\" I had not spoken\nwith him since we had parted on the top of the hill on our way out to\nthe college, when the horses had been taken from the carriage, and he\nhad walked back to life and Little Christchurch instead of making his\nway to his last home, and to find deposition with all the glory of a\ngreat name.\n\n\"It is very kind of you. Come in. Eva is not at home.\"\n\n\"I have just parted with her at my own house. So she and Jack are to\nmake a match of it. I need not tell you how more than contented I\nshall be that my son should have such a wife. Eva to me has been\nalways dear, almost as a daughter. Now she is like my own child.\"\n\n\"I am sure that I can say the same of Jack.\"\n\n\"Yes; Jack is a good lad too. I hope he will stick to the business.\"\n\n\"He need not trouble himself about that. He will have Little\nChristchurch and all that belongs to it as soon as I am gone. I had\nmade up my mind only to allow Eva an income out of it while she was\nthinking of that fellow Grundle. That man is a knave.\"\n\nI could not but remember that Grundle had been a Fixed-Periodist, and\nthat it would not become me to abuse him; and I was aware that though\nCrasweller was my sincere friend, he had come to entertain of late an\nabsolute hatred of all those, beyond myself, who had advocated his\nown deposition.\n\n\"Jack, at any rate, is happy,\" said I, \"and Eva. You and I,\nCrasweller have had our little troubles to imbitter the evenings of\nour life.\"\n\n\"You are yet in the full daylight.\"\n\n\"My ambition has been disappointed. I cannot conceal the fact from\nmyself,--nor from you. It has come to pass that during the last year\nor two we have lived with different hopes. And these hopes have been\nfounded altogether on the position which you might occupy.\"\n\n\"I should have gone mad up in that college, Neverbend.\"\n\n\"I would have been with you.\"\n\n\"I should have gone mad all the same. I should have committed\nsuicide.\"\n\n\"To save yourself from an honourable--deposition!\"\n\n\"The fixed day, coming at a certain known hour; the feeling that it\nmust come, though it came at the same time so slowly and yet so fast;\nevery day growing shorter day by day, and every season month by\nmonth; the sight of these chimneys--\"\n\n\"That was a mistake, Crasweller; that was a mistake. The cremation\nshould have been elsewhere.\"\n\n\"A man should have been an angel to endure it,--or so much less than\na man. I struggled,--for your sake. Who else would have struggled as\nI did to oblige a friend in such a matter?\"\n\n\"I know it--I know it.\"\n\n\"But life under such a weight became impossible to me. You do not\nknow what I endured even for the last year. Believe me that man is\nnot so constituted as to be able to make such efforts.\"\n\n\"He would get used to it. Mankind would get used to it.\"\n\n\"The first man will never get used to it. That college will become\na madhouse. You must think of some other mode of letting them pass\ntheir last year. Make them drunk, so that they shall not know what\nthey are doing. Drug them and make them senseless; or, better still,\ncome down upon them with absolute power, and carry them away to\ninstant death. Let the veil of annihilation fall upon them before\nthey know where they are. The Fixed Period, with all its damnable\ncertainty, is a mistake. I have tried it and I know it. When I look\nback at the last year, which was to be the last, not of my absolute\nlife but of my true existence, I shudder as I think what I went\nthrough. I am astonished at the strength of my own mind in that I did\nnot go mad. No one would have made such an effort for you as I made.\nThose other men had determined to rebel since the feeling of the\nFixed Period came near to them. It is impossible that human nature\nshould endure such a struggle and not rebel. I have been saved now by\nthese Englishmen, who have come here in their horror, and have used\ntheir strength to prevent the barbarity of your benevolence. But I\ncan hardly keep myself quiet as I think of the sufferings which I\nhave endured during the last month.\"\n\n\"But, Crasweller, you had assented.\"\n\n\"True; I did assent. But it was before the feeling of my fate had\ncome near to me. You may be strong enough to bear it. There is\nnothing so hard but that enthusiasm will make it tolerable. But you\nwill hardly find another who will not succumb. Who would do more\nfor you than I have done? Who would make a greater struggle? What\nhonester man is there whom you know in this community of ours? And\nyet even me you drove to be a liar. Think how strong must have\nbeen the facts against you when they have had this effect. To have\ndied at your behest at the instant would have been as nothing. Any\ndanger,--any immediate certainty,--would have been child's-play;\nbut to have gone up into that frightful college, and there to have\nremained through that year, which would have wasted itself so slowly,\nand yet so fast,--that would have required a heroism which, as I\nthink, no Greek, no Roman, no Englishman ever possessed.\"\n\nThen he paused, and I was aware that I had overstayed my time. \"Think\nof it,\" he continued; \"think of it on board that vessel, and try\nto bring home to yourself what such a phase of living would mean.\"\nThen he grasped me by the hand, and taking me out, put me upon my\ntricycle, and returned into the house.\n\nAs I went back to Gladstonopolis, I did think of it, and for a moment\nor two my mind wavered. He had convinced me that there was something\nwrong in the details of my system; but not,--when I came to argue the\nmatter with myself,--that the system itself was at fault. But now\nat the present moment I had hardly time for meditation. I had been\nsurprised at Crasweller's earnestness, and also at his eloquence, and\nI was in truth more full of his words than of his reasons. But the\ntime would soon come when I should be able to devote tranquil hours\nto the consideration of the points which he had raised. The long\nhours of enforced idleness on board ship would suffice to enable\nme to sift his objections, which seemed at the spur of the moment\nto resolve themselves into the impatience necessary to a year's\nquiescence. Crasweller had declared that human nature could\nnot endure it. Was it not the case that human nature had never\nendeavoured to train itself? As I got back to Gladstonopolis, I had\nalready a glimmering of an idea that we must begin with human nature\nsomewhat earlier, and teach men from their very infancy to prepare\nthemselves for the undoubted blessings of the Fixed Period. But\ncertain aids must be given, and the cremating furnace must be\nremoved, so as to be seen by no eye and smelt by no nose.\n\nAs I rode up to my house there was that eternal guard of soldiers,--a\ndozen men, with abominable guns and ungainly military hats or helmets\non their heads. I was so angered by their watchfulness, that I was\nhalf minded to turn my tricycle, and allow them to pursue me about\nthe island. They could never have caught me had I chosen to avoid\nthem; but such an escape would have been below my dignity. And\nmoreover, I certainly did wish to go. I therefore took no notice of\nthem when they shouldered their arms, but went into the house to give\nmy wife her last kiss. \"Now, Neverbend, remember you wear the flannel\ndrawers I put up for you, as soon as ever you get out of the opposite\ntropics. Remember it becomes frightfully cold almost at once; and\nwhatever you do, don't forget the little bag.\" These were Mrs\nNeverbend's last words to me. I there found Jack waiting for me, and\nwe together walked down to the quay. \"Mother would like to have gone\ntoo,\" said Jack.\n\n\"It would not have suited. There are so many things here that will\nwant her eye.\"\n\n\"All the same, she would like to have gone.\" I had felt that it was\nso, but yet she had never pressed her request.\n\nOn board I found Sir Ferdinando, and all the ship's officers with\nhim, in full dress. He had come, as I supposed, to see that I really\nwent; but he assured me, taking off his hat as he addressed me, that\nhis object had been to pay his last respects to the late President of\nthe republic. Nothing could now be more courteous than his conduct,\nor less like the bully that he had appeared to be when he had first\nclaimed to represent the British sovereign in Britannula. And I must\nconfess that there was absent all that tone of domineering ascendancy\nwhich had marked his speech as to the Fixed Period. The Fixed Period\nwas not again mentioned while he was on board; but he devoted himself\nto assuring me that I should be received in England with every\ndistinction, and that I should certainly be invited to Windsor\nCastle. I did not myself care very much about Windsor Castle; but\nto such civil speeches I could do no other than make civil replies;\nand there I stood for half an hour grimacing and paying compliments,\nanxious for the moment when Sir Ferdinando would get into the\nsix-oared gig which was waiting for him, and return to the shore.\nTo me it was of all half-hours the weariest, but to him it seemed\nas though to grimace and to pay compliments were his second nature.\nAt last the moment came when one of the junior officers came up to\nCaptain Battleax and told him that the vessel was ready to start.\n\"Now, Sir Ferdinando,\" said the captain, \"I am afraid that the John\nBright must leave you to the kindness of the Britannulists.\"\n\n\"I could not be left in more generous hands,\" said Sir Ferdinando,\n\"nor in those of warmer friends. The Britannulists speak English as\nwell as I do, and will, I am sure, admit that we boast of a common\ncountry.\"\n\n\"But not a common Government,\" said I, determined to fire a parting\nshot. \"But Sir Ferdinando is quite right in expecting that he\npersonally will receive every courtesy from the Britannulists. Nor\nwill his rule be in any respect disobeyed until the island shall,\nwith the agreement of England, again have resumed its own republican\nposition.\" Here I bowed, and he bowed, and we all bowed. Then he\ndeparted, taking Jack with him, leaning on whose arm he stepped down\ninto the boat; and as the men put their oars into the water, I jumped\nwith a sudden start at the sudden explosion of a subsidiary cannon,\nwhich went on firing some dozens of times till the proper number had\nbeen completed supposed to be due to an officer of such magnitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nOUR VOYAGE TO ENGLAND.\n\n\nThe boat had gone ashore and returned before the John Bright had\nsteamed out of the harbour. Then everything seemed to change, and\nCaptain Battleax bade me make myself quite at home. \"He trusted,\"\nhe said, \"that I should always dine with him during the voyage, but\nthat I should be left undisturbed during all other periods of the\nday. He dined at seven o'clock, but I could give my own orders as to\nbreakfast and tiffin. He was sure that Lieutenant Crosstrees would\nhave pleasure in showing me my cabins, and that if there was anything\non board which I did not feel to be comfortable, it should be at once\naltered. Lieutenant Crosstrees would tell my servant to wait upon\nme, and would show me all the comforts,--and discomforts,--of the\nvessel.\" With that I left him, and was taken below under the guidance\nof the lieutenant. As Mr Crosstrees became my personal friend during\nthe voyage,--more peculiarly than any of the other officers, all of\nwhom were my friends,--I will give some short description of him. He\nwas a young man, perhaps eight-and-twenty years old, whose great gift\nin the eyes of all those on board was his personal courage. Stories\nwere told to me by the junior officers of marvellous things which he\nhad done, which, though never mentioned in his own presence, either\nby himself or by others, seemed to constitute for him a special\ncharacter,--so that had it been necessary that any one should jump\noverboard to attack a shark, all on board would have thought that the\nduty as a matter of course belonged to Lieutenant Crosstrees. Indeed,\nas I learnt afterwards, he had quite a peculiar name in the British\nnavy. He was a small fair-haired man, with a pallid face and a bright\neye, whose idiosyncrasy it was to conceive that life afloat was\ninfinitely superior in all its attributes to life on shore. If there\never was a man entirely devoted to his profession, it was Lieutenant\nCrosstrees. For women he seemed to care nothing, nor for bishops, nor\nfor judges, nor for members of Parliament. They were all as children\nskipping about the world in their foolish playful ignorance, whom\nit was the sailor's duty to protect. Next to the sailor came the\nsoldier, as having some kindred employment; but at a very long\ninterval. Among sailors the British sailor,--that is, the British\nfighting sailor,--was the only one really worthy of honour; and among\nBritish sailors the officers on board H.M. gunboat the John Bright\nwere the happy few who had climbed to the top of the tree. Captain\nBattleax he regarded as the sultan of the world; but he was the\nsultan's vizier, and having the discipline of the ship altogether in\nhis own hands, was, to my thinking, its very master. I should have\nsaid beforehand that a man of such sentiments and feelings was not at\nall to my taste. Everything that he loved I have always hated, and\nall that he despised I have revered. Nevertheless I became very fond\nof him, and found in him an opponent to the Fixed Period that has\ndone more to shake my opinion than Crasweller with all his feelings,\nor Sir Ferdinando with all his arguments. And this he effected by a\nfew curt words which I have found almost impossible to resist. \"Come\nthis way, Mr President,\" he said. \"Here is where you are to sleep;\nand considering that it is only a ship, I think you'll find it fairly\ncomfortable.\" Anything more luxurious than the place assigned to me,\nI could not have imagined on board ship. I afterwards learned that\nthe cabins had been designed for the use of a travelling admiral,\nand I gathered from the fact that they were allotted to me an idea\nthat England intended to atone for the injury done to the country by\npersonal respect shown to the late President of the republic.\n\n\"I, at any rate, shall be comfortable while I am here. That in itself\nis something. Nevertheless I have to feel that I am a prisoner.\"\n\n\"Not more so than anybody else on board,\" said the lieutenant.\n\n\"A guard of soldiers came up this morning to look after me. What\nwould that guard of soldiers have done supposing that I had run\naway?\"\n\n\"We should have had to wait till they had caught you. But nobody\nconceived that to be possible. The President of a republic never runs\naway in his own person. There will be a cup of tea in the officers'\nmess-room at five o'clock. I will leave you till then, as you may\nwish to employ yourself.\" I went up immediately afterwards on\ndeck, and looking back over the tafferel, could only just see the\nglittering spires of Gladstonopolis in the distance.\n\nNow was the time for thought. I found an easy seat on the stern of\nthe vessel, and sat myself down to consider all that Crasweller had\nsaid to me. He and I had parted,--perhaps for ever. I had not been in\nEngland since I was a little child, and I could not but feel now that\nI might be detained there by circumstances, or die there, or that\nCrasweller, who was ten years my senior, might be dead before I\nshould have come back. And yet no ordinary farewell had been spoken\nbetween us. In those last words of his he had confined himself to\nthe Fixed Period, so full had his heart been of the subject, and so\nintent had he felt himself to be on convincing me. And what was the\nupshot of what he had said? Not that the doctrine of the Fixed Period\nwas in itself wrong, but that it was impracticable because of the\nhorrors attending its last moments. These were the solitude in which\nshould be passed the one last year; the sight of things which would\nremind the old man of coming death; and the general feeling that the\nbusiness and pleasures of life were over, and that the stillness of\nthe grave had been commenced. To this was to be added a certainty\nthat death would come on some prearranged day. These all referred\nmanifestly to the condition of him who was to go, and in no degree\naffected the welfare of those who were to remain. He had not\nattempted to say that for the benefit of the world at large the\nsystem was a bad system. That these evils would have befallen\nCrasweller himself, there could be no doubt. Though a dozen\ncompanions might have visited him daily, he would have felt the\ncollege to be a solitude, because he would not have been allowed to\nchoose his promiscuous comrades as in the outer world. But custom\nwould no doubt produce a cure for that evil. When a man knew that it\nwas to be so, the dozen visitors would suffice for him. The young\nman of thirty travels over all the world, but the old man of seventy\nis contented with the comparative confinement of his own town, or\nperhaps of his own house. As to the ghastliness of things to be seen,\nthey could no doubt be removed out of sight; but even that would be\ncured by custom. The business and pleasures of life at the prescribed\ntime were in general but a pretence at business and a reminiscence\nof pleasure. The man would know that the fated day was coming, and\nwould prepare for it with infinitely less of the anxious pain of\nuncertainty than in the outer world. The fact that death must come at\nthe settled day, would no doubt have its horror as long as the man\nwere able habitually to contrast his position with that of the few\nfavoured ones who had, within his own memory, lived happily to a more\nadvanced age; but when the time should come that no such old man\nhad so existed, I could not but think that a frame of mind would be\ncreated not indisposed to contentment. Sitting there, and turning it\nall over in my mind, while my eyes rested on the bright expanse of\nthe glass-clear sea, I did perceive that the Fixed Period, with all\nits advantages, was of such a nature that it must necessarily be\npostponed to an age prepared for it. Crasweller's eloquence had had\nthat effect upon me. I did see that it would be impossible to induce,\nin the present generation, a feeling of satisfaction in the system.\nI should have declared that it would not commence but with those\nwho were at present unborn; or, indeed, to allay the natural fears\nof mothers, not with those who should be born for the next dozen\nyears. It might have been well to postpone it for another century. I\nadmitted so much to myself, with the full understanding that a theory\ndelayed so long must be endangered by its own postponement. How was\nI to answer for the zeal of those who were to come so long after me?\nI sometimes thought of a more immediate date in which I myself might\nbe the first to be deposited, and that I might thus be allowed to set\nan example of a happy final year passed within the college. But then,\nhow far would the Tallowaxes, and Barneses, and Exors of the day be\nled by my example?\n\nI must on my arrival in England remodel altogether the Fixed Period,\nand name a day so far removed that even Jack's children would not be\nable to see it. It was with sad grief of heart that I so determined.\nAll my dreams of a personal ambition were at once shivered to the\nground. Nothing would remain of me but the name of the man who had\ncaused the republic of Britannula to be destroyed, and her government\nto be resumed by her old mistress. I must go to work, and with\npen, ink, and paper, with long written arguments and studied logic,\nendeavour to prove to mankind that the world should not allow itself\nto endure the indignities, and weakness, and selfish misery of\nextreme old age. I confess that my belief in the efficacy of spoken\nwords, of words running like an electric spark from the lips of the\nspeaker right into the heart of him who heard them, was stronger far\nthan my trust in written arguments. They must lack a warmth which the\nothers possess; and they enter only on the minds of the studious,\nwhereas the others touch the feelings of the world at large. I had\nalready overcome in the breasts of many listeners the difficulties\nwhich I now myself experienced. I would again attempt to do so with\na British audience. I would again enlarge on the meanness of the man\nwho could not make so small a sacrifice of his latter years for the\nbenefit of the rising generation. But even spoken words would come\ncold to me, and would fall unnoticed on the hearts of others, when it\nwas felt that the doctrine advocated could not possibly affect any\nliving man. Thinking of all this, I was very melancholy when I was\nsummoned down to tea by one of the stewards who attended the\nofficers' mess.\n\n\"Mr President, will you take tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate, or\npreserved dates? There are muffins and crumpets, dry toast, buttered\ntoast, plum-cake, seed-cake, peach-fritters, apple-marmalade, and\nbread and butter. There are put-up fruits of all kinds, of which you\nreally wouldn't know that they hadn't come this moment from graperies\nand orchard-houses; but we don't put them on the table, because we\nthink that we can't eat quite so much dinner after them.\" This was\nthe invitation which came from a young naval lad who seemed to be\nabout fifteen years old.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Percy,\" said an elder officer. \"The fruits are not\nhere because Lord Alfred gorged himself so tremendously that we were\nafraid his mother, the duchess, would withdraw him from the service\nwhen she heard that he had made himself sick.\"\n\n\"There are cura\u00c3\u00a7oa, chartreuse, pepperwick, mangostino, and Russian\nbrandy on the side-board,\" suggested a third.\n\n\"I shall have a glass of madeira--just a thimbleful,\" said another,\nwho seemed to be a few years older than Lord Alfred Percy. Then\none of the stewards brought the madeira, which the young man drank\nwith great satisfaction. \"This wine has been seven times round the\nworld,\" he said, \"and the only time for drinking it is five-o'clock\ntea,--that is, if you understand what good living means.\" I asked\nsimply for a cup of tea, which I found to be peculiarly good, partly\nbecause of the cream which accompanied it. I then went up-stairs to\ntake a constitutional walk with Mr Crosstrees on the deck. \"I saw you\nsitting there for a couple of hours very thoughtful,\" said he, \"and I\nwouldn't disturb you. I hope it doesn't make you unhappy that you are\ncarried away to England?\"\n\n\"Had it done so, I don't know whether I should have gone--alive.\"\n\n\"They said that when it was suggested, you promised to be ready in\ntwo days.\"\n\n\"I did say so--because it suited me. But I can hardly imagine that\nthey would have carried me on board with violence, or that they would\nhave put all Gladstonopolis to the sword because I declined to go on\nboard.\"\n\n\"Brown had told us that we were to bring you off dead or alive; and\ndead or alive, I think we should have had you. If the soldiers had\nnot succeeded, the sailors would have taken you in hand.\" When I\nasked him why there was this great necessity for kidnapping me, he\nassured me that feeling in England had run very high on the matter,\nand that sundry bishops had declared that anything so barbarous could\nnot be permitted in the twentieth century. \"It would be as bad, they\nsaid, as the cannibals of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"That shows the absolute ignorance of the bishops on the subject.\"\n\n\"I daresay; but there is a prejudice about killing an old man, or a\nwoman. Young men don't matter.\"\n\n\"Allow me to assure you, Mr Crosstrees,\" said I, \"that your sentiment\nis carrying you far away from reason. To the State the life of a\nwoman should be just the same as that of a man. The State cannot\nallow itself to indulge in romance.\"\n\n\"You get a sailor, and tell him to strike a woman, and see what he'll\nsay.\"\n\n\"The sailor is irrational. Of course, we are supposing that it\nis for the public benefit that the woman should be struck. It is\nthe same with an old man. The good of the commonwealth,--and his\nown,--requires that, beyond a certain age, he shall not be allowed\nto exist. He does not work, and he cannot enjoy living. He wastes\nmore than his share of the necessaries of life, and becomes, on the\naggregate, an intolerable burden. Read Shakespeare's description of\nman in his last stage--\n\n\n   'Second childishness, and mere oblivion,\n    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything;'\n\n\nand the stage before is merely that of the 'lean and slippered\npantaloon.' For his own sake, would you not save mankind from having\nto encounter such miseries as these?\"\n\n\"You can't do it, Mr President.\"\n\n\"I very nearly did do it. The Britannulist Assembly, in the majesty\nof its wisdom, passed a law to that effect.\" I was sorry afterwards\nthat I had spoken of the majesty of the Assembly's wisdom, because\nit savoured of buncombe. Our Assembly's wisdom was not particularly\nmajestic; but I had intended to allude to the presumed majesty\nattached to the highest council in the State.\n\n\"Your Assembly in the majesty of its wisdom could do nothing of the\nkind. It might pass a law, but the law could be carried out only\nby men. The Parliament in England, which is, I take it, quite as\nmajestic as the Assembly in Britannula--\"\n\n\"I apologise for the word, Mr Crosstrees, which savours of the\nridiculous. I did not quite explain my idea at the moment.\"\n\n\"It is forgotten,\" he said; and I must acknowledge that he never used\nthe word against me again. \"The Parliament in England might order a\nthree-months-old baby to be slain, but could not possibly get the\ndeed done.\"\n\n\"Not if it were for the welfare of Great Britain?\"\n\n\"Not to save Great Britain from destruction. Strength is very strong,\nbut it is not half so powerful as weakness. I could, with the\ngreatest alacrity in the world, fire that big gun in among battalions\nof armed men, so as to scatter them all to the winds, but I could not\npoint it in the direction of a single girl.\" We went on discussing\nthe matter at considerable length, and his convictions were quite as\nstrong as mine. He was sure that under no circumstances would an old\nman ever be deprived of his life under the Fixed Period. I was as\nconfident as he on the other side,--or, at any rate, pretended to\nbe so,--and told him that he made no allowance for the progressive\nwisdom of mankind. But we parted as friends, and soon after went to\ndinner.\n\nI was astonished to find how very little the captain had to do with\nhis officers. On board ship he lived nearly alone, having his first\nlieutenant with him for a quarter of an hour every morning. On the\noccasion of this my first day on board, he had a dinner-party in\nhonour of my coming among them; and two or three days before we\nreached England, he had another. I dined with him regularly every day\nexcept twice, when I was invited to the officers' mess. I breakfasted\nalone in my own cabin, where everything was provided for me that I\ncould desire, and always lunched and took five-o'clock tea with the\nofficers. I remained alone till one o'clock, and spent four hours\nevery morning during our entire journey in composing this volume as\nit is now printed. I have put it into the shape of a story, because\nI think that I may so best depict the feelings of the people around\nme as I made my great endeavour to carry out the Fixed Period in\nBritannula, and because I may so describe the kind of opposition\nwhich was shown by the expression of those sentiments on which\nLieutenant Crosstrees depended. I do not at this minute doubt but\nthat Crasweller would have been deposited had not the John Bright\nappeared. Whether Barnes and Tallowax would have followed peaceably,\nmay be doubted. They, however, are not men of great weight in\nBritannula, and the officers of the law might possibly have\nconstrained them to have followed the example which Crasweller had\nset. But I do confess that I doubt whether I should have been able\nto proceed to carry out the arrangements for the final departure of\nCrasweller. Looking forward, I could see Eva kneeling at my feet,\nand could acknowledge the invincible strength of that weakness to\nwhich Crosstrees had alluded. A godlike heroism would have been\ndemanded,--a heroism which must have submitted to have been called\nbrutal,--and of such I knew myself not to be the owner. Had\nthe British Parliament ordered the three-months-old baby to be\nslaughtered, I was not the man to slaughter it, even though I were\nthe sworn servant of the British Parliament. Upon the whole, I was\nglad that the John Bright had come into our waters, and had taken\nme away on its return to England. It was a way out of my immediate\ntrouble against which I was able to expostulate, and to show with\nsome truth on my side that I was an injured man. All this I am\nwilling to admit in the form of a tale, which I have adopted for my\npresent work, and for which I may hope to obtain some popularity\nin England. Once on shore there, I shall go to work on a volume of\naltogether a different nature, and endeavour to be argumentative and\nstatistical, as I have here been fanciful, though true to details.\n\nDuring the whole course of my journey to England, Captain Battleax\nnever said a word to me about the Fixed Period. He was no doubt\na gallant officer, and possessed of all necessary gifts for the\nmanagement of a 250-ton steam swivel-gun; but he seemed to me to be\nsomewhat heavy. He never even in conversation alluded to Britannula,\nand spoke always of the dockyard at Devonport as though I had been\nfamiliar with its every corner. He was very particular about his\nclothes, and I was told by Lieutenant Crosstrees on the first day\nthat he would resent it as a bitter offence had I come down to dinner\nwithout a white cravat. \"He's right, you know; those things do tell,\"\nCrosstrees had said to me when I had attempted to be jocose about\nthese punctilios. I took care, however, always to put on a white\ncravat both with the captain and with the officers. After dinner with\nthe captain, a cup of coffee was always brought in on a silver tray,\nin a silver coffee-pot. This was leisurely consumed; and then, as I\nsoon understood, the captain expected that I should depart. I learnt\nafterwards that he immediately put his feet up on the sofa and slept\nfor the remainder of the evening. I retired to the lieutenant's\ncabin, and there discussed the whole history of Britannula over many\na prolonged cigar.\n\n\"Did you really mean to kill the old men?\" said Lord Alfred Percy to\nme one day; \"regularly to cut their throats, you know, and carry them\nout and burn them.\"\n\n\"I did not mean it, but the law did.\"\n\n\"Every poor old fellow would have been put an end to without the\nslightest mercy?\"\n\n\"Not without mercy,\" I rejoined.\n\n\"Now, there's my governor's father,\" said Lord Alfred; \"you know who\nhe is?\"\n\n\"The Duke of Northumberland, I'm informed.\"\n\n\"He's a terrible swell. He owns three castles, and half a county, and\nhas half a million a-year. I can hardly tell you what sort of an old\nfellow he is at home. There isn't any one who doesn't pay him the\nmost profound respect, and he's always doing good to everybody. Do\nyou mean to say that some constable or cremator,--some sort of first\nhangman,--would have come to him and taken him by the nape of his\nneck, and cut his throat, just because he was sixty-eight years old?\nI can't believe that anybody would have done it.\"\n\n\"But the duke is a man.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's a man, no doubt.\"\n\n\"If he committed murder, he would be hanged in spite of his dukedom.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that would be,\" said Lord Alfred, hesitating. \"I\ncannot imagine that my grandfather should commit a murder.\"\n\n\"But he would be hanged; I can tell you that. Though it be very\nimprobable,--impossible, as you and I may think it,--the law is the\nsame for him as for others. Why should not all other laws be the same\nalso?\"\n\n\"But it would be murder.\"\n\n\"What is your idea of murder?\"\n\n\"Killing people.\"\n\n\"Then you are murderers who go about with this great gun of yours for\nthe sake of killing many people.\"\n\n\"We've never killed anybody with it yet.\"\n\n\"You are not the less murderers if you have the intent to murder. Are\nsoldiers murderers who kill other soldiers in battle? The murderer is\nthe man who illegally kills. Now, in accordance with us, everything\nwould have been done legally; and I'm afraid that if your grandfather\nwere living among us, he would have to be deposited like the rest.\"\n\n\"Not if Sir Ferdinando were there,\" said the boy. I could not go on\nto explain to him that he thus ran away from his old argument about\nthe duke. But I did feel that a new difficulty would arise from the\nextreme veneration paid to certain characters. In England how would\nit be with the Royal Family? Would it be necessary to exempt them\ndown to the extremest cousins; and if so, how large a body of cousins\nwould be generated! I feared that the Fixed Period could only be good\nfor a republic in which there were no classes violently distinguished\nfrom their inferior brethren. If so, it might be well that I should\ngo to the United States, and there begin to teach my doctrine.\nNo other republic would be strong enough to stand against those\nhydra-headed prejudices with which the ignorance of the world at\nlarge is fortified. \"I don't believe,\" continued the boy, bringing\nthe conversation to an end, \"that all the men in this ship could take\nmy grandfather and kill him in cold blood.\"\n\nI was somewhat annoyed, on my way to England, by finding that the men\non board,--the sailors, the stokers, and stewards,--regarded me as\na most cruel person. The prejudices of people of this class are so\nstrong as to be absolutely invincible. It is necessary that a new\nrace should come up before the prejudices are eradicated. They were\ncivil enough in their demeanour to me personally, but they had all\nbeen taught that I was devoted to the slaughter of old men; and\nthey regarded me with all that horror which the modern nations have\nentertained for cannibalism. I heard a whisper one day between two of\nthe stewards. \"He'd have killed that old fellow that came on board as\nsure as eggs if we hadn't got there just in time to prevent him.\"\n\n\"Not with his own hands,\" said a listening junior.\n\n\"Yes; with his own hands. That was just the thing. He wouldn't allow\nit to be done by anybody else.\" It was thus that they regarded the\nsacrifice that I had thought to make of my own feelings in regard\nto Crasweller. I had no doubt suggested that I myself would use the\nlancet in order to save him from any less friendly touch. I believed\nafterwards, that when the time had come I should have found myself\nincapacitated for the operation. The natural weakness incidental to\nmy feelings would have prevailed. But now that promise,--once so\npainfully made, and since that, as I had thought, forgotten by all\nbut myself,--was remembered against me as a proof of the diabolical\ninhumanity of my disposition.\n\n\"I believe that they think that we mean to eat them,\" I said one day\nto Crosstrees. He had gradually become my confidential friend, and to\nhim I made known all the sorrows which fell upon me during the voyage\nfrom the ignorance of the men around me. I cannot boast that I had in\nthe least affected his opinion by my arguments; but he at any rate\nhad sense enough to perceive that I was not a bloody-minded cannibal,\nbut one actuated by a true feeling of philanthropy. He knew that my\nobject was to do good, though he did not believe in the good to be\ndone.\n\n\"You've got to endure that,\" said he.\n\n\"Do you mean to say, that when I get to England I shall be regarded\nwith personal feelings of the same kind?\"\n\n\"Yes; so I imagine.\" There was an honesty about Crosstrees which\nwould never allow him to soften anything.\n\n\"That will be hard to bear.\"\n\n\"The first reformers had to bear such hardships. I don't exactly\nremember what it was that Socrates wanted to do for his ungrateful\nfellow-mortals; but they thought so badly of him, that they made him\nswallow poison. Your Galileo had a hard time when he said that the\nsun stood still. Why should we go further than Jesus Christ for an\nexample? If you are not able to bear the incidents, you should not\nundertake the business.\"\n\nBut in England I should not have a single disciple! There would not\nbe one to solace or to encourage me! Would it not be well that I\nshould throw myself into the ocean, and have done with a world so\nungrateful? In Britannula they had known my true disposition. There\nI had received the credit due to a tender heart and loving feelings.\nNo one thought there that I wanted to eat up my victims, or that I\nwould take a pleasure in spilling their blood with my own hands. And\ntidings so misrepresenting me would have reached England before me,\nand I should there have no friend. Even Lieutenant Crosstrees would\nbe seen no more after I had gone ashore. Then came upon me for the\nfirst time an idea that I was not wanted in England at all,--that I\nwas simply to be brought away from my own home to avoid the supposed\nmischief I might do there, and that for all British purposes it would\nbe well that I should be dropped into the sea, or left ashore on some\ndesert island. I had been taken from the place where, as governing\nofficer, I had undoubtedly been of use,--and now could be of use no\nlonger. Nobody in England would want me or would care for me, and\nI should be utterly friendless there, and alone. For aught I knew,\nthey might put me in prison and keep me there, so as to be sure that\nI should not return to my own people. If I asked for my liberty, I\nmight be told that because of my bloodthirstiness it would be for the\ngeneral welfare that I should be deprived of it. When Sir Ferdinando\nBrown had told me that I should certainly be asked down to Windsor,\nI had taken his flowery promises as being worth nothing. I had no\nwish to go to Windsor. But what should I do with myself immediately\non my arrival? Would it not be best to return at once to my own\ncountry,--if only I might be allowed to do so. All this made me very\nmelancholy, but especially the feeling that I should be regarded by\nall around as a monster of cruelty. I could not but think of the\nwords which Lieutenant Crosstrees had spoken to me. The Saviour of\nthe world had His disciples who believed in Him, and the one dear\nyouth who loved Him so well. I almost doubted my own energy as a\nteacher of progress to carry me through the misery which I saw in\nstore for me.\n\n\"I shall not have a very bright time when I arrive in England,\" I\nsaid to my friend Crosstrees, two days before our expected arrival.\n\n\"It will be all new, and there will be plenty for you to see.\"\n\n\"You will go upon some other voyage?\"\n\n\"Yes; we shall be wanted up in the Baltic at once. We are very good\nfriends with Russia; but no dog is really respected in this world\nunless he shows that he can bite as well as bark.\"\n\n\"I shall not be respected, because I can neither bark nor bite. What\nwill they do with me?\"\n\n\"We shall put you on shore at Plymouth, and send you up to\nLondon--with a guard of honour.\"\n\n\"And what will the guard of honour do with me?\"\n\n\"Ah! for that I cannot answer. He will treat you with all kind of\nrespect, no doubt.\"\n\n\"It has not occurred to you to think,\" said I, \"where he will deposit\nme? Why should it do so? But to me the question is one of some\nmoment. No one there will want me; nobody knows me. They to whom I\nmust be the cause of some little trouble will simply wish me out\nof the way; and the world at large, if it hears of me at all, will\nsimply have been informed of my cruelty and malignity. I do not mean\nto destroy myself.\"\n\n\"Don't do that,\" said the lieutenant, in a piteous tone.\n\n\"But it would be best, were it not that certain scruples prevent one.\nWhat would you advise me to do with myself, to begin with?\" He paused\nbefore he replied, and looked painfully into my face. \"You will\nexcuse my asking you, because, little as my acquaintance is with you,\nit is with you alone of all Englishmen that I have any acquaintance.\"\n\n\"I thought that you were intent about your book.\"\n\n\"What shall I do with my book? Who will publish it? How shall I\ncreate an interest for it? Is there one who will believe, at any\nrate, that I believe in the Fixed Period?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the lieutenant.\n\n\"That is because you first knew me in Britannula, and have since\npassed a month with me at sea. You are my one and only friend, and\nyou are about to leave me,--and you also disbelieve in me. You must\nacknowledge to yourself that you have never known one whose position\nin the world was more piteous, or whose difficulties were more\ntrying.\" Then I left him, and went down to complete my manuscript.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FIXED PERIOD***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 27067-8.txt or 27067-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/7\/0\/6\/27067\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":294,"split":"train"}
