Now widowed, she resumes contact with Darrow. Darrow desires to continue the relationship he had with Anna but remains concerned about her commitment to the relationship.\nThe novel begins with Darrow preparing to join Anna in France when he receives a telegram ordering him to wait \"til thirtieth\" because of an \"unexpected obstacle\" - one of many such delays Anna has ordered. Deeply humiliated and disappointed, Darrow boards the boat regardless and runs into the young Sophy Viner, a woman he had previously encountered but never gotten to know thoroughly . Sophy, although down on her luck, is an ambitious aspiring actress determined to start a new life in France. Enthralled, Darrow convinces her to spend a few days with him so he can show her around Paris. During their time spent together, the two enter into a romantic affair.\nMonths later, Darrow meets Anna at her French country chateau at Givr\u0102\u0160. They speak of their future and of Anna's stepson Owen, who wishes to marry a woman of which his grandmother, Dowager Marquise de Chantelle, does not approve. Additionally, Darrow informs Anna of his plans for their future together; he hopes to move to South America together for his job. It is revealed that Anna had hired a governess for her young daughter, Effie. That governess is Sophy Viner.\nSophy, embarrassed by the situation, begs Darrow not to say anything that might jeopardize her employment. Darrow tries to convince Sophy not to marry Owen, and Sophy accuses him of jealousy. Darrow admits to Anna that he knew Sophy already. Anna quizzes him about Sophy, out of concern for Owen, who is engaged to Sophy. Darrow agrees with the Marquise that the union would not be wise.\nThe Dowager Marquise requests that an old family friend, Adelaide Painter, talk some sense into the family. However, when Adelaide supports the union, the Marquise concedes to her grandson. The road is clear for Owen and Sophy to marry, which also frees the path for Darrow and Anna.\nSophy unexpectedly breaks off the engagement to Owen. Owen becomes suspicious of Darrow's influence over Sophy. The main characters then attempt to figure out what happened by interrogating each other. This part of the novel shows an increase in dialogue, and an unusually high rate of dialogue for Wharton's novels.\nSophy eventually reveals to Darrow that she has loved him since Paris. The affair between Darrow and Sophy is revealed to Anna. Darrow attempts to explain that the affair was short lived, but Anna cannot live with the knowledge and becomes convinced that the revelation destroyed any potential for a future relationship.\nDespite the fact that Anna believes herself to be well matched with Darrow, she is unable to overcome her jealousy of Sophy. She becomes obsessed with imagining the time they spent together.\nOwen leaves for Spain. Sophy is reemployed by Mrs. Murrett, her previous employer, and moves to India. Anna encounters Sophy's large, slovenly sister and her lover, which gives Anna the perspective that Sophy is not as much of a fallen woman as she originally thought. Anna attempts to convince herself that she should not marry Darrow, but cannot bring herself to do it.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Reef, by Edith Wharton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Please don't come till thirtieth. Anna.\"\n\nAll the way from Charing Cross to Dover the train had hammered the words\nof the telegram into George Darrow's ears, ringing every change of irony\non its commonplace syllables: rattling them out like a discharge of\nmusketry, letting them, one by one, drip slowly and coldly into his\nbrain, or shaking, tossing, transposing them like the dice in some game\nof the gods of malice; and now, as he emerged from his compartment at\nthe pier, and stood facing the wind-swept platform and the angry sea\nbeyond, they leapt out at him as if from the crest of the waves, stung\nand blinded him with a fresh fury of derision.\n\n\"Unexpected obstacle. Please don't come till thirtieth. Anna.\"\n\nShe had put him off at the very last moment, and for the second time:\nput him off with all her sweet reasonableness, and for one of her usual\n\"good\" reasons--he was certain that this reason, like the other, (the\nvisit of her husband's uncle's widow) would be \"good\"! But it was that\nvery certainty which chilled him. The fact of her dealing so reasonably\nwith their case shed an ironic light on the idea that there had been any\nexceptional warmth in the greeting she had given him after their twelve\nyears apart.\n\nThey had found each other again, in London, some three months\npreviously, at a dinner at the American Embassy, and when she had caught\nsight of him her smile had been like a red rose pinned on her widow's\nmourning. He still felt the throb of surprise with which, among\nthe stereotyped faces of the season's diners, he had come upon her\nunexpected face, with the dark hair banded above grave eyes; eyes in\nwhich he had recognized every little curve and shadow as he would have\nrecognized, after half a life-time, the details of a room he had played\nin as a child. And as, in the plumed starred crowd, she had stood out\nfor him, slender, secluded and different, so he had felt, the instant\ntheir glances met, that he as sharply detached himself for her. All that\nand more her smile had said; had said not merely \"I remember,\" but \"I\nremember just what you remember\"; almost, indeed, as though her memory\nhad aided his, her glance flung back on their recaptured moment its\nmorning brightness. Certainly, when their distracted Ambassadress--with\nthe cry: \"Oh, you know Mrs. Leath? That's perfect, for General Farnham\nhas failed me\"--had waved them together for the march to the dining-room,\nDarrow had felt a slight pressure of the arm on his, a pressure faintly\nbut unmistakably emphasizing the exclamation: \"Isn't it wonderful?--In\nLondon--in the season--in a mob?\"\n\nLittle enough, on the part of most women; but it was a sign of Mrs.\nLeath's quality that every movement, every syllable, told with her. Even\nin the old days, as an intent grave-eyed girl, she had seldom misplaced\nher light strokes; and Darrow, on meeting her again, had immediately\nfelt how much finer and surer an instrument of expression she had\nbecome.\n\nTheir evening together had been a long confirmation of this feeling. She\nhad talked to him, shyly yet frankly, of what had happened to her during\nthe years when they had so strangely failed to meet. She had told him\nof her marriage to Fraser Leath, and of her subsequent life in France,\nwhere her husband's mother, left a widow in his youth, had been\nre-married to the Marquis de Chantelle, and where, partly in consequence\nof this second union, the son had permanently settled himself. She had\nspoken also, with an intense eagerness of affection, of her little girl\nEffie, who was now nine years old, and, in a strain hardly less tender,\nof Owen Leath, the charming clever young stepson whom her husband's\ndeath had left to her care...\n\n\nA porter, stumbling against Darrow's bags, roused him to the fact that\nhe still obstructed the platform, inert and encumbering as his luggage.\n\n\"Crossing, sir?\"\n\nWas he crossing? He really didn't know; but for lack of any more\ncompelling impulse he followed the porter to the luggage van, singled\nout his property, and turned to march behind it down the gang-way. As\nthe fierce wind shouldered him, building up a crystal wall against his\nefforts, he felt anew the derision of his case.\n\n\"Nasty weather to cross, sir,\" the porter threw back at him as they beat\ntheir way down the narrow walk to the pier. Nasty weather, indeed; but\nluckily, as it had turned out, there was no earthly reason why Darrow\nshould cross.\n\nWhile he pushed on in the wake of his luggage his thoughts slipped back\ninto the old groove. He had once or twice run across the man whom Anna\nSummers had preferred to him, and since he had met her again he had been\nexercising his imagination on the picture of what her married life must\nhave been. Her husband had struck him as a characteristic specimen of\nthe kind of American as to whom one is not quite clear whether he\nlives in Europe in order to cultivate an art, or cultivates an art as a\npretext for living in Europe. Mr. Leath's art was water-colour painting,\nbut he practised it furtively, almost clandestinely, with the disdain of\na man of the world for anything bordering on the professional, while\nhe devoted himself more openly, and with religious seriousness, to the\ncollection of enamelled snuff-boxes. He was blond and well-dressed, with\nthe physical distinction that comes from having a straight figure, a\nthin nose, and the habit of looking slightly disgusted--as who should\nnot, in a world where authentic snuff-boxes were growing daily harder to\nfind, and the market was flooded with flagrant forgeries?\n\nDarrow had often wondered what possibilities of communion there could\nhave been between Mr. Leath and his wife. Now he concluded that there\nhad probably been none. Mrs. Leath's words gave no hint of her husband's\nhaving failed to justify her choice; but her very reticence betrayed\nher. She spoke of him with a kind of impersonal seriousness, as if he\nhad been a character in a novel or a figure in history; and what she\nsaid sounded as though it had been learned by heart and slightly dulled\nby repetition. This fact immensely increased Darrow's impression that\nhis meeting with her had annihilated the intervening years. She, who was\nalways so elusive and inaccessible, had grown suddenly communicative and\nkind: had opened the doors of her past, and tacitly left him to draw his\nown conclusions. As a result, he had taken leave of her with the\nsense that he was a being singled out and privileged, to whom she had\nentrusted something precious to keep. It was her happiness in their\nmeeting that she had given him, had frankly left him to do with as he\nwilled; and the frankness of the gesture doubled the beauty of the gift.\n\nTheir next meeting had prolonged and deepened the impression. They had\nfound each other again, a few days later, in an old country house full\nof books and pictures, in the soft landscape of southern England.\nThe presence of a large party, with all its aimless and agitated\ndisplacements, had served only to isolate the pair and give them (at\nleast to the young man's fancy) a deeper feeling of communion, and their\ndays there had been like some musical prelude, where the instruments,\nbreathing low, seem to hold back the waves of sound that press against\nthem.\n\nMrs. Leath, on this occasion, was no less kind than before; but she\ncontrived to make him understand that what was so inevitably coming was\nnot to come too soon. It was not that she showed any hesitation as to\nthe issue, but rather that she seemed to wish not to miss any stage in\nthe gradual reflowering of their intimacy.\n\nDarrow, for his part, was content to wait if she wished it. He\nremembered that once, in America, when she was a girl, and he had\ngone to stay with her family in the country, she had been out when he\narrived, and her mother had told him to look for her in the garden. She\nwas not in the garden, but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a\nlong shady path. Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to\nhim to wait; and charmed by the lights and shadows that played upon her\nas she moved, and by the pleasure of watching her slow advance toward\nhim, he had obeyed her and stood still. And so she seemed now to be\nwalking to him down the years, the light and shade of old memories and\nnew hopes playing variously on her, and each step giving him the vision\nof a different grace. She did not waver or turn aside; he knew she would\ncome straight to where he stood; but something in her eyes said \"Wait\",\nand again he obeyed and waited.\n\nOn the fourth day an unexpected event threw out his calculations.\nSummoned to town by the arrival in England of her husband's mother, she\nleft without giving Darrow the chance he had counted on, and he cursed\nhimself for a dilatory blunderer. Still, his disappointment was tempered\nby the certainty of being with her again before she left for France;\nand they did in fact see each other in London. There, however, the\natmosphere had changed with the conditions. He could not say that she\navoided him, or even that she was a shade less glad to see him; but\nshe was beset by family duties and, as he thought, a little too readily\nresigned to them.\n\nThe Marquise de Chantelle, as Darrow soon perceived, had the same\nmild formidableness as the late Mr. Leath: a sort of insistent\nself-effacement before which every one about her gave way. It was\nperhaps the shadow of this lady's presence--pervasive even during her\nactual brief eclipses--that subdued and silenced Mrs. Leath. The latter\nwas, moreover, preoccupied about her stepson, who, soon after receiving\nhis degree at Harvard, had been rescued from a stormy love-affair, and\nfinally, after some months of troubled drifting, had yielded to his\nstep-mother's counsel and gone up to Oxford for a year of supplementary\nstudy. Thither Mrs. Leath went once or twice to visit him, and her\nremaining days were packed with family obligations: getting, as she\nphrased it, \"frocks and governesses\" for her little girl, who had\nbeen left in France, and having to devote the remaining hours to long\nshopping expeditions with her mother-in-law. Nevertheless, during her\nbrief escapes from duty, Darrow had had time to feel her safe in the\ncustody of his devotion, set apart for some inevitable hour; and the\nlast evening, at the theatre, between the overshadowing Marquise and the\nunsuspicious Owen, they had had an almost decisive exchange of words.\n\nNow, in the rattle of the wind about his ears, Darrow continued to\nhear the mocking echo of her message: \"Unexpected obstacle.\" In such an\nexistence as Mrs. Leath's, at once so ordered and so exposed, he knew\nhow small a complication might assume the magnitude of an \"obstacle;\"\nyet, even allowing as impartially as his state of mind permitted for\nthe fact that, with her mother-in-law always, and her stepson\nintermittently, under her roof, her lot involved a hundred small\naccommodations generally foreign to the freedom of widowhood--even so,\nhe could not but think that the very ingenuity bred of such conditions\nmight have helped her to find a way out of them. No, her \"reason\",\nwhatever it was, could, in this case, be nothing but a pretext; unless\nhe leaned to the less flattering alternative that any reason seemed good\nenough for postponing him! Certainly, if her welcome had meant what he\nimagined, she could not, for the second time within a few weeks,\nhave submitted so tamely to the disarrangement of their plans; a\ndisarrangement which--his official duties considered--might, for all she\nknew, result in his not being able to go to her for months.\n\n\"Please don't come till thirtieth.\" The thirtieth--and it was now the\nfifteenth! She flung back the fortnight on his hands as if he had been\nan idler indifferent to dates, instead of an active young diplomatist\nwho, to respond to her call, had had to hew his way through a very\njungle of engagements! \"Please don't come till thirtieth.\" That was all.\nNot the shadow of an excuse or a regret; not even the perfunctory \"have\nwritten\" with which it is usual to soften such blows. She didn't want\nhim, and had taken the shortest way to tell him so. Even in his first\nmoment of exasperation it struck him as characteristic that she should\nnot have padded her postponement with a fib. Certainly her moral angles\nwere not draped!\n\n\"If I asked her to marry me, she'd have refused in the same language.\nBut thank heaven I haven't!\" he reflected.\n\nThese considerations, which had been with him every yard of the way from\nLondon, reached a climax of irony as he was drawn into the crowd on the\npier. It did not soften his feelings to remember that, but for her lack\nof forethought, he might, at this harsh end of the stormy May day, have\nbeen sitting before his club fire in London instead of shivering in the\ndamp human herd on the pier. Admitting the sex's traditional right to\nchange, she might at least have advised him of hers by telegraphing\ndirectly to his rooms. But in spite of their exchange of letters she\nhad apparently failed to note his address, and a breathless emissary had\nrushed from the Embassy to pitch her telegram into his compartment as\nthe train was moving from the station.\n\nYes, he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived; and this\nminor proof of her indifference became, as he jammed his way through the\ncrowd, the main point of his grievance against her and of his derision\nof himself. Half way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his\nexasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining. Instantly\nthe narrow ledge became a battle-ground of thrusting, slanting, parrying\ndomes. The wind rose with the rain, and the harried wretches exposed to\nthis double assault wreaked on their neighbours the vengeance they could\nnot take on the elements.\n\nDarrow, whose healthy enjoyment of life made him in general a good\ntraveller, tolerant of agglutinated humanity, felt himself obscurely\noutraged by these promiscuous contacts. It was as though all the people\nabout him had taken his measure and known his plight; as though they\nwere contemptuously bumping and shoving him like the inconsiderable\nthing he had become. \"She doesn't want you, doesn't want you, doesn't\nwant you,\" their umbrellas and their elbows seemed to say.\n\nHe had rashly vowed, when the telegram was flung into his window: \"At\nany rate I won't turn back\"--as though it might cause the sender a\nmalicious joy to have him retrace his steps rather than keep on to\nParis! Now he perceived the absurdity of the vow, and thanked his stars\nthat he need not plunge, to no purpose, into the fury of waves outside\nthe harbour.\n\nWith this thought in his mind he turned back to look for his porter;\nbut the contiguity of dripping umbrellas made signalling impossible and,\nperceiving that he had lost sight of the man, he scrambled up again to\nthe platform. As he reached it, a descending umbrella caught him in the\ncollar-bone; and the next moment, bent sideways by the wind, it turned\ninside out and soared up, kite-wise, at the end of a helpless female\narm.\n\nDarrow caught the umbrella, lowered its inverted ribs, and looked up at\nthe face it exposed to him.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said; \"you can't stay here.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a surge of the crowd drove the owner of the umbrella\nabruptly down on him. Darrow steadied her with extended arms, and\nregaining her footing she cried out: \"Oh, dear, oh, dear! It's in\nribbons!\"\n\nHer lifted face, fresh and flushed in the driving rain, woke in him\na memory of having seen it at a distant time and in a vaguely\nunsympathetic setting; but it was no moment to follow up such clues, and\nthe face was obviously one to make its way on its own merits.\n\nIts possessor had dropped her bag and bundles to clutch at the tattered\numbrella. \"I bought it only yesterday at the Stores; and--yes--it's\nutterly done for!\" she lamented.\n\nDarrow smiled at the intensity of her distress. It was food for the\nmoralist that, side by side with such catastrophes as his, human nature\nwas still agitating itself over its microscopic woes!\n\n\"Here's mine if you want it!\" he shouted back at her through the\nshouting of the gale.\n\nThe offer caused the young lady to look at him more intently. \"Why,\nit's Mr. Darrow!\" she exclaimed; and then, all radiant recognition: \"Oh,\nthank you! We'll share it, if you will.\"\n\nShe knew him, then; and he knew her; but how and where had they met? He\nput aside the problem for subsequent solution, and drawing her into a\nmore sheltered corner, bade her wait till he could find his porter.\n\nWhen, a few minutes later, he came back with his recovered property,\nand the news that the boat would not leave till the tide had turned, she\nshowed no concern.\n\n\"Not for two hours? How lucky--then I can find my trunk!\"\n\nOrdinarily Darrow would have felt little disposed to involve himself\nin the adventure of a young female who had lost her trunk; but at the\nmoment he was glad of any pretext for activity. Even should he decide to\ntake the next up train from Dover he still had a yawning hour to fill;\nand the obvious remedy was to devote it to the loveliness in distress\nunder his umbrella.\n\n\"You've lost a trunk? Let me see if I can find it.\"\n\nIt pleased him that she did not return the conventional \"Oh, WOULD you?\"\nInstead, she corrected him with a laugh--\"Not a trunk, but my trunk; I've\nno other--\" and then added briskly: \"You'd better first see to getting\nyour own things on the boat.\"\n\nThis made him answer, as if to give substance to his plans by discussing\nthem: \"I don't actually know that I'm going over.\"\n\n\"Not going over?\"\n\n\"Well...perhaps not by this boat.\" Again he felt a stealing indecision.\n\"I may probably have to go back to London. I'm--I'm waiting...expecting\na letter...(She'll think me a defaulter,\" he reflected.) \"But meanwhile\nthere's plenty of time to find your trunk.\"\n\nHe picked up his companion's bundles, and offered her an arm which\nenabled her to press her slight person more closely under his umbrella;\nand as, thus linked, they beat their way back to the platform, pulled\ntogether and apart like marionettes on the wires of the wind, he\ncontinued to wonder where he could have seen her. He had immediately\nclassed her as a compatriot; her small nose, her clear tints, a kind\nof sketchy delicacy in her face, as though she had been brightly but\nlightly washed in with water-colour, all confirmed the evidence of her\nhigh sweet voice and of her quick incessant gestures. She was clearly an\nAmerican, but with the loose native quality strained through a closer\nwoof of manners: the composite product of an enquiring and adaptable\nrace. All this, however, did not help him to fit a name to her, for just\nsuch instances were perpetually pouring through the London Embassy, and\nthe etched and angular American was becoming rarer than the fluid type.\n\nMore puzzling than the fact of his being unable to identify her was\nthe persistent sense connecting her with something uncomfortable and\ndistasteful. So pleasant a vision as that gleaming up at him between\nwet brown hair and wet brown boa should have evoked only associations as\npleasing; but each effort to fit her image into his past resulted in the\nsame memories of boredom and a vague discomfort...\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"Don't you remember me now--at Mrs. Murrett's?\" She threw the question at\nDarrow across a table of the quiet coffee-room to which, after a vainly\nprolonged quest for her trunk, he had suggested taking her for a cup of\ntea.\n\nIn this musty retreat she had removed her dripping hat, hung it on the\nfender to dry, and stretched herself on tiptoe in front of the round\neagle-crowned mirror, above the mantel vases of dyed immortelles, while\nshe ran her fingers comb-wise through her hair. The gesture had acted on\nDarrow's numb feelings as the glow of the fire acted on his circulation;\nand when he had asked: \"Aren't your feet wet, too?\" and, after\nfrank inspection of a stout-shod sole, she had answered cheerfully:\n\"No--luckily I had on my new boots,\" he began to feel that human\nintercourse would still be tolerable if it were always as free from\nformality.\n\nThe removal of his companion's hat, besides provoking this reflection,\ngave him his first full sight of her face; and this was so\nfavourable that the name she now pronounced fell on him with a quite\ndisproportionate shock of dismay.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Murrett's--was it THERE?\"\n\nHe remembered her now, of course: remembered her as one of the shadowy\nsidling presences in the background of that awful house in Chelsea, one\nof the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable Mrs. Murrett, into\nwhose talons he had fallen in the course of his head-long pursuit of\nLady Ulrica Crispin. Oh, the taste of stale follies! How insipid it was,\nyet how it clung!\n\n\"I used to pass you on the stairs,\" she reminded him.\n\nYes: he had seen her slip by--he recalled it now--as he dashed up to\nthe drawing-room in quest of Lady Ulrica. The thought made him steal a\nlonger look. How could such a face have been merged in the Murrett\nmob? Its fugitive slanting lines, that lent themselves to all manner of\ntender tilts and foreshortenings, had the freakish grace of some young\nhead of the Italian comedy. The hair stood up from her forehead in a\nboyish elf-lock, and its colour matched her auburn eyes flecked with\nblack, and the little brown spot on her cheek, between the ear that was\nmeant to have a rose behind it and the chin that should have rested on\na ruff. When she smiled, the left corner of her mouth went up a little\nhigher than the right; and her smile began in her eyes and ran down to\nher lips in two lines of light. He had dashed past that to reach Lady\nUlrica Crispin!\n\n\"But of course you wouldn't remember me,\" she was saying. \"My name is\nViner--Sophy Viner.\"\n\nNot remember her? But of course he DID! He was genuinely sure of it now.\n\"You're Mrs. Murrett's niece,\" he declared.\n\nShe shook her head. \"No; not even that. Only her reader.\"\n\n\"Her reader? Do you mean to say she ever reads?\"\n\nMiss Viner enjoyed his wonder. \"Dear, no! But I wrote notes, and made up\nthe visiting-book, and walked the dogs, and saw bores for her.\"\n\nDarrow groaned. \"That must have been rather bad!\"\n\n\"Yes; but nothing like as bad as being her niece.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe. I'm glad to hear,\" he added, \"that you put it\nall in the past tense.\"\n\nShe seemed to droop a little at the allusion; then she lifted her chin\nwith a jerk of defiance. \"Yes. All is at an end between us. We've just\nparted in tears--but not in silence!\"\n\n\"Just parted? Do you mean to say you've been there all this time?\"\n\n\"Ever since you used to come there to see Lady Ulrica? Does it seem to\nyou so awfully long ago?\"\n\nThe unexpectedness of the thrust--as well as its doubtful taste--chilled\nhis growing enjoyment of her chatter. He had really been getting to\nlike her--had recovered, under the candid approval of her eye, his\nusual sense of being a personable young man, with all the privileges\npertaining to the state, instead of the anonymous rag of humanity he\nhad felt himself in the crowd on the pier. It annoyed him, at that\nparticular moment, to be reminded that naturalness is not always\nconsonant with taste.\n\nShe seemed to guess his thought. \"You don't like my saying that you came\nfor Lady Ulrica?\" she asked, leaning over the table to pour herself a\nsecond cup of tea.\n\nHe liked her quickness, at any rate. \"It's better,\" he laughed, \"than\nyour thinking I came for Mrs. Murrett!\"\n\n\"Oh, we never thought anybody came for Mrs. Murrett! It was always for\nsomething else: the music, or the cook--when there was a good one--or\nthe other people; generally ONE of the other people.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nShe was amusing, and that, in his present mood, was more to his purpose\nthan the exact shade of her taste. It was odd, too, to discover suddenly\nthat the blurred tapestry of Mrs. Murrett's background had all the while\nbeen alive and full of eyes. Now, with a pair of them looking into his,\nhe was conscious of a queer reversal of perspective.\n\n\"Who were the 'we'? Were you a cloud of witnesses?\"\n\n\"There were a good many of us.\" She smiled. \"Let me see--who was there\nin your time? Mrs. Bolt--and Mademoiselle--and Professor Didymus and\nthe Polish Countess. Don't you remember the Polish Countess? She\ncrystal-gazed, and played accompaniments, and Mrs. Murrett chucked her\nbecause Mrs. Didymus accused her of hypnotizing the Professor. But of\ncourse you don't remember. We were all invisible to you; but we could\nsee. And we all used to wonder about you----\"\n\nAgain Darrow felt a redness in the temples. \"What about me?\"\n\n\"Well--whether it was you or she who...\"\n\nHe winced, but hid his disapproval. It made the time pass to listen to\nher.\n\n\"And what, if one may ask, was your conclusion?\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Bolt and Mademoiselle and the Countess naturally thought it\nwas SHE; but Professor Didymus and Jimmy Brance--especially Jimmy----\"\n\n\"Just a moment: who on earth is Jimmy Brance?\"\n\nShe exclaimed in wonder: \"You WERE absorbed--not to remember Jimmy\nBrance! He must have been right about you, after all.\" She let her\namused scrutiny dwell on him. \"But how could you? She was false from\nhead to foot!\"\n\n\"False----?\" In spite of time and satiety, the male instinct of\nownership rose up and repudiated the charge.\n\nMiss Viner caught his look and laughed. \"Oh, I only meant externally!\nYou see, she often used to come to my room after tennis, or to touch\nup in the evenings, when they were going on; and I assure you she took\napart like a puzzle. In fact I used to say to Jimmy--just to make him\nwild--:'I'll bet you anything you like there's nothing wrong, because\nI know she'd never dare un--'\" She broke the word in two, and her quick\nblush made her face like a shallow-petalled rose shading to the deeper\npink of the centre.\n\nThe situation was saved, for Darrow, by an abrupt rush of memories, and\nhe gave way to a mirth which she as frankly echoed. \"Of course,\" she\ngasped through her laughter, \"I only said it to tease Jimmy----\"\n\nHer amusement obscurely annoyed him. \"Oh, you're all alike!\" he\nexclaimed, moved by an unaccountable sense of disappointment.\n\nShe caught him up in a flash--she didn't miss things! \"You say that\nbecause you think I'm spiteful and envious? Yes--I was envious of Lady\nUlrica...Oh, not on account of you or Jimmy Brance! Simply because\nshe had almost all the things I've always wanted: clothes and fun and\nmotors, and admiration and yachting and Paris--why, Paris alone would be\nenough!--And how do you suppose a girl can see that sort of thing about\nher day after day, and never wonder why some women, who don't seem to\nhave any more right to it, have it all tumbled into their laps, while\nothers are writing dinner invitations, and straightening out accounts,\nand copying visiting lists, and finishing golf-stockings, and matching\nribbons, and seeing that the dogs get their sulphur? One looks in one's\nglass, after all!\"\n\nShe launched the closing words at him on a cry that lifted them above\nthe petulance of vanity; but his sense of her words was lost in the\nsurprise of her face. Under the flying clouds of her excitement it was\nno longer a shallow flower-cup but a darkening gleaming mirror that\nmight give back strange depths of feeling. The girl had stuff in her--he\nsaw it; and she seemed to catch the perception in his eyes.\n\n\"That's the kind of education I got at Mrs. Murrett's--and I never had\nany other,\" she said with a shrug.\n\n\"Good Lord--were you there so long?\"\n\n\"Five years. I stuck it out longer than any of the others.\" She spoke as\nthough it were something to be proud of.\n\n\"Well, thank God you're out of it now!\"\n\nAgain a just perceptible shadow crossed her face. \"Yes--I'm out of it\nnow fast enough.\"\n\n\"And what--if I may ask--are you doing next?\"\n\nShe brooded a moment behind drooped lids; then, with a touch of hauteur:\n\"I'm going to Paris: to study for the stage.\"\n\n\"The stage?\" Darrow stared at her, dismayed. All his confused\ncontradictory impressions assumed a new aspect at this announcement; and\nto hide his surprise he added lightly: \"Ah--then you will have Paris,\nafter all!\"\n\n\"Hardly Lady Ulrica's Paris. It s not likely to be roses, roses all the\nway.\"\n\n\"It's not, indeed.\" Real compassion prompted him to continue: \"Have you\nany--any influence you can count on?\"\n\nShe gave a somewhat flippant little laugh. \"None but my own. I've never\nhad any other to count on.\"\n\nHe passed over the obvious reply. \"But have you any idea how the\nprofession is over-crowded? I know I'm trite----\"\n\n\"I've a very clear idea. But I couldn't go on as I was.\"\n\n\"Of course not. But since, as you say, you'd stuck it out longer than\nany of the others, couldn't you at least have held on till you were sure\nof some kind of an opening?\"\n\nShe made no reply for a moment; then she turned a listless glance to the\nrain-beaten window. \"Oughtn't we be starting?\" she asked, with a lofty\nassumption of indifference that might have been Lady Ulrica's.\n\nDarrow, surprised by the change, but accepting her rebuff as a phase of\nwhat he guessed to be a confused and tormented mood, rose from his seat\nand lifted her jacket from the chair-back on which she had hung it to\ndry. As he held it toward her she looked up at him quickly.\n\n\"The truth is, we quarrelled,\" she broke out, \"and I left last night\nwithout my dinner--and without my salary.\"\n\n\"Ah--\" he groaned, with a sharp perception of all the sordid dangers\nthat might attend such a break with Mrs. Murrett.\n\n\"And without a character!\" she added, as she slipped her arms into the\njacket. \"And without a trunk, as it appears--but didn't you say that,\nbefore going, there'd be time for another look at the station?\"\n\nThere was time for another look at the station; but the look again\nresulted in disappointment, since her trunk was nowhere to be found in\nthe huge heap disgorged by the newly-arrived London express. The fact\ncaused Miss Viner a moment's perturbation; but she promptly adjusted\nherself to the necessity of proceeding on her journey, and her decision\nconfirmed Darrow's vague resolve to go to Paris instead of retracing his\nway to London.\n\nMiss Viner seemed cheered at the prospect of his company, and sustained\nby his offer to telegraph to Charing Cross for the missing trunk; and\nhe left her to wait in the fly while he hastened back to the telegraph\noffice. The enquiry despatched, he was turning away from the desk when\nanother thought struck him and he went back and indited a message to his\nservant in London: \"If any letters with French post-mark received since\ndeparture forward immediately to Terminus Hotel Gare du Nord Paris.\"\n\nThen he rejoined Miss Viner, and they drove off through the rain to the\npier.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAlmost as soon as the train left Calais her head had dropped back into\nthe corner, and she had fallen asleep.\n\nSitting opposite, in the compartment from which he had contrived to have\nother travellers excluded, Darrow looked at her curiously. He had never\nseen a face that changed so quickly. A moment since it had danced like\na field of daisies in a summer breeze; now, under the pallid oscillating\nlight of the lamp overhead, it wore the hard stamp of experience, as of\na soft thing chilled into shape before its curves had rounded: and it\nmoved him to see that care already stole upon her when she slept.\n\nThe story she had imparted to him in the wheezing shaking cabin, and at\nthe Calais buffet--where he had insisted on offering her the dinner\nshe had missed at Mrs. Murrett's--had given a distincter outline to\nher figure. From the moment of entering the New York boarding-school to\nwhich a preoccupied guardian had hastily consigned her after the death\nof her parents, she had found herself alone in a busy and indifferent\nworld. Her youthful history might, in fact, have been summed up in\nthe statement that everybody had been too busy to look after her. Her\nguardian, a drudge in a big banking house, was absorbed by \"the office\";\nthe guardian's wife, by her health and her religion; and an elder\nsister, Laura, married, unmarried, remarried, and pursuing, through all\nthese alternating phases, some vaguely \"artistic\" ideal on which the\nguardian and his wife looked askance, had (as Darrow conjectured) taken\ntheir disapproval as a pretext for not troubling herself about\npoor Sophy, to whom--perhaps for this reason--she had remained the\nincarnation of remote romantic possibilities.\n\nIn the course of time a sudden \"stroke\" of the guardian's had thrown his\npersonal affairs into a state of confusion from which--after his widely\nlamented death--it became evident that it would not be possible to\nextricate his ward's inheritance. No one deplored this more sincerely\nthan his widow, who saw in it one more proof of her husband's life\nhaving been sacrificed to the innumerable duties imposed on him, and who\ncould hardly--but for the counsels of religion--have brought herself to\npardon the young girl for her indirect share in hastening his end. Sophy\ndid not resent this point of view. She was really much sorrier for her\nguardian's death than for the loss of her insignificant fortune. The\nlatter had represented only the means of holding her in bondage, and\nits disappearance was the occasion of her immediate plunge into the\nwide bright sea of life surrounding the island-of her captivity. She had\nfirst landed--thanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed\nher education--in a Fifth Avenue school-room where, for a few months,\nshe acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their\nbodyguard of nurses and teachers. The too-pressing attentions of their\nfather's valet had caused her to fly this sheltered spot, against the\nexpress advice of her educational superiors, who implied that, in their\nown case, refinement and self-respect had always sufficed to keep the\nmost ungovernable passions at bay. The experience of the guardian's\nwidow having been precisely similar, and the deplorable precedent of\nLaura's career being present to all their minds, none of these ladies\nfelt any obligation to intervene farther in Sophy's affairs; and she was\naccordingly left to her own resources.\n\nA schoolmate from the Rocky Mountains, who was taking her father and\nmother to Europe, had suggested Sophy's accompanying them, and \"going\nround\" with her while her progenitors, in the care of the courier,\nnursed their ailments at a fashionable bath. Darrow gathered that the\n\"going round\" with Mamie Hoke was a varied and diverting process; but\nthis relatively brilliant phase of Sophy's career was cut short by\nthe elopement of the inconsiderate Mamie with a \"matinee idol\" who had\nfollowed her from New York, and by the precipitate return of her parents\nto negotiate for the repurchase of their child.\n\nIt was then--after an interval of repose with compassionate but\nimpecunious American friends in Paris--that Miss Viner had been drawn\ninto the turbid current of Mrs. Murrett's career. The impecunious\ncompatriots had found Mrs. Murrett for her, and it was partly on\ntheir account (because they were such dears, and so unconscious, poor\nconfiding things, of what they were letting her in for) that Sophy had\nstuck it out so long in the dreadful house in Chelsea. The Farlows, she\nexplained to Darrow, were the best friends she had ever had (and the\nonly ones who had ever \"been decent\" about Laura, whom they had seen\nonce, and intensely admired); but even after twenty years of Paris they\nwere the most incorrigibly inexperienced angels, and quite persuaded\nthat Mrs. Murrett was a woman of great intellectual eminence, and the\nhouse at Chelsea \"the last of the salons\"--Darrow knew what she meant?\nAnd she hadn't liked to undeceive them, knowing that to do so would be\nvirtually to throw herself back on their hands, and feeling, moreover,\nafter her previous experiences, the urgent need of gaining, at any cost,\na name for stability; besides which--she threw it off with a slight\nlaugh--no other chance, in all these years, had happened to come to her.\n\nShe had brushed in this outline of her career with light rapid strokes,\nand in a tone of fatalism oddly untinged by bitterness. Darrow perceived\nthat she classified people according to their greater or less \"luck\" in\nlife, but she appeared to harbour no resentment against the undefined\npower which dispensed the gift in such unequal measure. Things came\none's way or they didn't; and meanwhile one could only look on, and make\nthe most of small compensations, such as watching \"the show\" at Mrs.\nMurrett's, and talking over the Lady Ulricas and other footlight\nfigures. And at any moment, of course, a turn of the kaleidoscope might\nsuddenly toss a bright spangle into the grey pattern of one's days.\n\nThis light-hearted philosophy was not without charm to a young man\naccustomed to more traditional views. George Darrow had had a fairly\nvaried experience of feminine types, but the women he had frequented had\neither been pronouncedly \"ladies\" or they had not. Grateful to both for\nministering to the more complex masculine nature, and disposed to\nassume that they had been evolved, if not designed, to that end, he\nhad instinctively kept the two groups apart in his mind, avoiding that\nintermediate society which attempts to conciliate both theories of life.\n\"Bohemianism\" seemed to him a cheaper convention than the other two, and\nhe liked, above all, people who went as far as they could in their own\nline--liked his \"ladies\" and their rivals to be equally unashamed of\nshowing for exactly what they were. He had not indeed--the fact of Lady\nUlrica was there to remind him--been without his experience of a third\ntype; but that experience had left him with a contemptuous distaste for\nthe woman who uses the privileges of one class to shelter the customs of\nanother.\n\nAs to young girls, he had never thought much about them since his early\nlove for the girl who had become Mrs. Leath. That episode seemed, as\nhe looked back on it, to bear no more relation to reality than a pale\ndecorative design to the confused richness of a summer landscape. He\nno longer understood the violent impulses and dreamy pauses of his own\nyoung heart, or the inscrutable abandonments and reluctances of hers. He\nhad known a moment of anguish at losing her--the mad plunge of youthful\ninstincts against the barrier of fate; but the first wave of stronger\nsensation had swept away all but the outline of their story, and the\nmemory of Anna Summers had made the image of the young girl sacred, but\nthe class uninteresting.\n\nSuch generalisations belonged, however, to an earlier stage of his\nexperience. The more he saw of life the more incalculable he found\nit; and he had learned to yield to his impressions without feeling\nthe youthful need of relating them to others. It was the girl in the\nopposite seat who had roused in him the dormant habit of comparison.\nShe was distinguished from the daughters of wealth by her avowed\nacquaintance with the real business of living, a familiarity as\ndifferent as possible from their theoretical proficiency; yet it seemed\nto Darrow that her experience had made her free without hardness and\nself-assured without assertiveness.\n\n\nThe rush into Amiens, and the flash of the station lights into their\ncompartment, broke Miss Viner's sleep, and without changing her position\nshe lifted her lids and looked at Darrow. There was neither surprise nor\nbewilderment in the look. She seemed instantly conscious, not so much\nof where she was, as of the fact that she was with him; and that fact\nseemed enough to reassure her. She did not even turn her head to look\nout; her eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared\nto light her face from within, while her lips kept their sleepy droop.\n\nShouts and the hurried tread of travellers came to them through the\nconfusing cross-lights of the platform. A head appeared at the window,\nand Darrow threw himself forward to defend their solitude; but the\nintruder was only a train hand going his round of inspection. He passed\non, and the lights and cries of the station dropped away, merged in a\nwider haze and a hollower resonance, as the train gathered itself up\nwith a long shake and rolled out again into the darkness.\n\nMiss Viner's head sank back against the cushion, pushing out a dusky\nwave of hair above her forehead. The swaying of the train loosened a\nlock over her ear, and she shook it back with a movement like a boy's,\nwhile her gaze still rested on her companion.\n\n\"You're not too tired?\"\n\nShe shook her head with a smile.\n\n\"We shall be in before midnight. We're very nearly on time.\" He verified\nthe statement by holding up his watch to the lamp.\n\nShe nodded dreamily. \"It's all right. I telegraphed Mrs. Farlow that\nthey mustn't think of coming to the station; but they'll have told the\nconcierge to look out for me.\"\n\n\"You'll let me drive you there?\"\n\nShe nodded again, and her eyes closed. It was very pleasant to Darrow\nthat she made no effort to talk or to dissemble her sleepiness. He sat\nwatching her till the upper lashes met and mingled with the lower,\nand their blent shadow lay on her cheek; then he stood up and drew the\ncurtain over the lamp, drowning the compartment in a bluish twilight.\n\nAs he sank back into his seat he thought how differently Anna\nSummers--or even Anna Leath--would have behaved. She would not have\ntalked too much; she would not have been either restless or embarrassed;\nbut her adaptability, her appropriateness, would not have been\nnature but \"tact.\" The oddness of the situation would have made sleep\nimpossible, or, if weariness had overcome her for a moment, she would\nhave waked with a start, wondering where she was, and how she had come\nthere, and if her hair were tidy; and nothing short of hairpins and a\nglass would have restored her self-possession...\n\nThe reflection set him wondering whether the \"sheltered\" girl's\nbringing-up might not unfit her for all subsequent contact with life.\nHow much nearer to it had Mrs. Leath been brought by marriage and\nmotherhood, and the passage of fourteen years? What were all her\nreticences and evasions but the result of the deadening process of\nforming a \"lady\"? The freshness he had marvelled at was like the\nunnatural whiteness of flowers forced in the dark.\n\nAs he looked back at their few days together he saw that their\nintercourse had been marked, on her part, by the same hesitations and\nreserves which had chilled their earlier intimacy. Once more they had\nhad their hour together and she had wasted it. As in her girlhood, her\neyes had made promises which her lips were afraid to keep. She was still\nafraid of life, of its ruthlessness, its danger and mystery. She was\nstill the petted little girl who cannot be left alone in the dark...His\nmemory flew back to their youthful story, and long-forgotten details\ntook shape before him. How frail and faint the picture was! They seemed,\nhe and she, like the ghostly lovers of the Grecian Urn, forever pursuing\nwithout ever clasping each other. To this day he did not quite know\nwhat had parted them: the break had been as fortuitous as the fluttering\napart of two seed-vessels on a wave of summer air...\n\nThe very slightness, vagueness, of the memory gave it an added\npoignancy. He felt the mystic pang of the parent for a child which\nhas just breathed and died. Why had it happened thus, when the least\nshifting of influences might have made it all so different? If she had\nbeen given to him then he would have put warmth in her veins and light\nin her eyes: would have made her a woman through and through. Musing\nthus, he had the sense of waste that is the bitterest harvest of\nexperience. A love like his might have given her the divine gift of\nself-renewal; and now he saw her fated to wane into old age repeating\nthe same gestures, echoing the words she had always heard, and\nperhaps never guessing that, just outside her glazed and curtained\nconsciousness, life rolled away, a vast blackness starred with lights,\nlike the night landscape beyond the windows of the train.\n\nThe engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station.\nIn the light of the platform lamp Darrow looked across at his companion.\nHer head had dropped toward one shoulder, and her lips were just far\nenough apart for the reflection of the upper one to deepen the colour\nof the other. The jolting of the train had again shaken loose the lock\nabove her ear. It danced on her cheek like the flit of a brown wing over\nflowers, and Darrow felt an intense desire to lean forward and put it\nback behind her ear.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAs their motor-cab, on the way from the Gare du Nord, turned into the\ncentral glitter of the Boulevard, Darrow had bent over to point out an\nincandescent threshold.\n\n\"There!\"\n\nAbove the doorway, an arch of flame flashed out the name of a great\nactress, whose closing performances in a play of unusual originality\nhad been the theme of long articles in the Paris papers which Darrow had\ntossed into their compartment at Calais.\n\n\"That's what you must see before you're twenty-four hours older!\"\n\nThe girl followed his gesture eagerly. She was all awake and alive now,\nas if the heady rumours of the streets, with their long effervescences\nof light, had passed into her veins like wine.\n\n\"Cerdine? Is that where she acts?\" She put her head out of the window,\nstraining back for a glimpse of the sacred threshold. As they flew past\nit she sank into her seat with a satisfied sigh.\n\n\"It's delicious enough just to KNOW she's there! I've never seen her,\nyou know. When I was here with Mamie Hoke we never went anywhere but to\nthe music halls, because she couldn't understand any French; and when\nI came back afterward to the Farlows' I was dead broke, and couldn't\nafford the play, and neither could they; so the only chance we had was\nwhen friends of theirs invited us--and once it was to see a tragedy by\na Roumanian lady, and the other time it was for 'L'Ami Fritz' at the\nFrancais.\"\n\nDarrow laughed. \"You must do better than that now. 'Le Vertige' is a\nfine thing, and Cerdine gets some wonderful effects out of it. You\nmust come with me tomorrow evening to see it--with your friends, of\ncourse.--That is,\" he added, \"if there's any sort of chance of getting\nseats.\"\n\nThe flash of a street lamp lit up her radiant face. \"Oh, will you really\ntake us? What fun to think that it's tomorrow already!\"\n\nIt was wonderfully pleasant to be able to give such pleasure. Darrow was\nnot rich, but it was almost impossible for him to picture the state of\npersons with tastes and perceptions like his own, to whom an evening at\nthe theatre was an unattainable indulgence. There floated through his\nmind an answer of Mrs. Leath's to his enquiry whether she had seen the\nplay in question. \"No. I meant to, of course, but one is so overwhelmed\nwith things in Paris. And then I'm rather sick of Cerdine--one is always\nbeing dragged to see her.\"\n\nThat, among the people he frequented, was the usual attitude toward such\nopportunities. There were too many, they were a nuisance, one had to\ndefend one's self! He even remembered wondering, at the moment,\nwhether to a really fine taste the exceptional thing could ever become\nindifferent through habit; whether the appetite for beauty was so soon\ndulled that it could be kept alive only by privation. Here, at any rate,\nwas a fine chance to experiment with such a hunger: he almost wished he\nmight stay on in Paris long enough to take the measure of Miss Viner's\nreceptivity.\n\nShe was still dwelling on his promise, \"It's too beautiful of you! Oh,\ndon't you THINK you'll be able to get seats?\" And then, after a pause of\nbrimming appreciation: \"I wonder if you'll think me horrid?--but it may\nbe my only chance; and if you can't get places for us all, wouldn't you\nperhaps just take ME? After all, the Farlows may have seen it!\"\n\nHe had not, of course, thought her horrid, but only the more engaging,\nfor being so natural, and so unashamed of showing the frank greed of her\nfamished youth. \"Oh, you shall go somehow!\" he had gaily promised her;\nand she had dropped back with a sigh of pleasure as their cab passed\ninto the dimly-lit streets of the Farlows' quarter beyond the Seine...\n\n\nThis little passage came back to him the next morning, as he opened his\nhotel window on the early roar of the Northern Terminus.\n\nThe girl was there, in the room next to him. That had been the first\npoint in his waking consciousness. The second was a sense of relief at\nthe obligation imposed on him by this unexpected turn of everts. To\nwake to the necessity of action, to postpone perforce the fruitless\ncontemplation of his private grievance, was cause enough for gratitude,\neven if the small adventure in which he found himself involved had not,\non its own merits, roused an instinctive curiosity to see it through.\n\nWhen he and his companion, the night before, had reached the Farlows'\ndoor in the rue de la Chaise, it was only to find, after repeated\nassaults on its panels, that the Farlows were no longer there. They\nhad moved away the week before, not only from their apartment but from\nParis; and Miss Viner's breach with Mrs. Murrett had been too sudden to\npermit her letter and telegram to overtake them. Both communications,\nno doubt, still reposed in a pigeon-hole of the loge; but its custodian,\nwhen drawn from his lair, sulkily declined to let Miss Viner verify the\nfact, and only flung out, in return for Darrow's bribe, the statement\nthat the Americans had gone to Joigny.\n\nTo pursue them there at that hour was manifestly impossible, and Miss\nViner, disturbed but not disconcerted by this new obstacle, had quite\nsimply acceded to Darrow's suggestion that she should return for what\nremained of the night to the hotel where he had sent his luggage.\n\nThe drive back through the dark hush before dawn, with the nocturnal\nblaze of the Boulevard fading around them like the false lights of\na magician's palace, had so played on her impressionability that she\nseemed to give no farther thought to her own predicament. Darrow noticed\nthat she did not feel the beauty and mystery of the spectacle as much\nas its pressure of human significance, all its hidden implications\nof emotion and adventure. As they passed the shadowy colonnade of the\nFrancais, remote and temple-like in the paling lights, he felt a clutch\non his arm, and heard the cry: \"There are things THERE that I want so\ndesperately to see!\" and all the way back to the hotel she continued to\nquestion him, with shrewd precision and an artless thirst for detail,\nabout the theatrical life of Paris. He was struck afresh, as he\nlistened, by the way in which her naturalness eased the situation of\nconstraint, leaving to it only a pleasant savour of good fellowship. It\nwas the kind of episode that one might, in advance, have characterized\nas \"awkward\", yet that was proving, in the event, as much outside such\ndefinitions as a sunrise stroll with a dryad in a dew-drenched forest;\nand Darrow reflected that mankind would never have needed to invent tact\nif it had not first invented social complications.\n\nIt had been understood, with his good-night to Miss Viner, that the next\nmorning he was to look up the Joigny trains, and see her safely to\nthe station; but, while he breakfasted and waited for a time-table, he\nrecalled again her cry of joy at the prospect of seeing Cerdine. It was\ncertainly a pity, since that most elusive and incalculable of artists\nwas leaving the next week for South America, to miss what might be a\nlast sight of her in her greatest part; and Darrow, having dressed and\nmade the requisite excerpts from the time-table, decided to carry the\nresult of his deliberations to his neighbour's door.\n\nIt instantly opened at his knock, and she came forth looking as if she\nhad been plunged into some sparkling element which had curled up all her\ndrooping tendrils and wrapped her in a shimmer of fresh leaves.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of me?\" she cried; and with a hand at her waist\nshe spun about as if to show off some miracle of Parisian dress-making.\n\n\"I think the missing trunk has come--and that it was worth waiting for!\"\n\n\"You DO like my dress?\"\n\n\"I adore it! I always adore new dresses--why, you don't mean to say it's\nNOT a new one?\"\n\nShe laughed out her triumph.\n\n\"No, no, no! My trunk hasn't come, and this is only my old rag of\nyesterday--but I never knew the trick to fail!\" And, as he stared: \"You\nsee,\" she joyously explained, \"I've always had to dress in all kinds of\ndreary left-overs, and sometimes, when everybody else was smart and\nnew, it used to make me awfully miserable. So one day, when Mrs. Murrett\ndragged me down unexpectedly to fill a place at dinner, I suddenly\nthought I'd try spinning around like that, and say to every one: 'WELL,\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?' And, do you know, they were all taken in,\nincluding Mrs. Murrett, who didn't recognize my old turned and dyed\nrags, and told me afterward it was awfully bad form to dress as if I\nwere somebody that people would expect to know! And ever since, whenever\nI've particularly wanted to look nice, I've just asked people what they\nthought of my new frock; and they're always, always taken in!\"\n\nShe dramatized her explanation so vividly that Darrow felt as if his\npoint were gained.\n\n\"Ah, but this confirms your vocation--of course,\" he cried, \"you must\nsee Cerdine!\" and, seeing her face fall at this reminder of the change\nin her prospects, he hastened to set forth his plan. As he did so, he\nsaw how easy it was to explain things to her. She would either accept\nhis suggestion, or she would not: but at least she would waste no time\nin protestations and objections, or any vain sacrifice to the idols of\nconformity. The conviction that one could, on any given point, almost\npredicate this of her, gave him the sense of having advanced far enough\nin her intimacy to urge his arguments against a hasty pursuit of her\nfriends.\n\nYes, it would certainly be foolish--she at once agreed--in the case\nof such dear indefinite angels as the Farlows, to dash off after them\nwithout more positive proof that they were established at Joigny, and\nso established that they could take her in. She owned it was but too\nprobable that they had gone there to \"cut down\", and might be doing so\nin quarters too contracted to receive her; and it would be unfair, on\nthat chance, to impose herself on them unannounced. The simplest way of\ngetting farther light on the question would be to go back to the rue de\nla Chaise, where, at that more conversable hour, the concierge might be\nless chary of detail; and she could decide on her next step in the light\nof such facts as he imparted.\n\nPoint by point, she fell in with the suggestion, recognizing, in the\nlight of their unexplained flight, that the Farlows might indeed be in a\nsituation on which one could not too rashly intrude. Her concern for her\nfriends seemed to have effaced all thought of herself, and this little\nindication of character gave Darrow a quite disproportionate pleasure.\nShe agreed that it would be well to go at once to the rue de la Chaise,\nbut met his proposal that they should drive by the declaration that it\nwas a \"waste\" not to walk in Paris; so they set off on foot through the\ncheerful tumult of the streets.\n\nThe walk was long enough for him to learn many things about her. The\nstorm of the previous night had cleared the air, and Paris shone in\nmorning beauty under a sky that was all broad wet washes of white and\nblue; but Darrow again noticed that her visual sensitiveness was less\nkeen than her feeling for what he was sure the good Farlows--whom he\nalready seemed to know--would have called \"the human interest.\" She\nseemed hardly conscious of sensations of form and colour, or of any\nimaginative suggestion, and the spectacle before them--always, in\nits scenic splendour, so moving to her companion--broke up, under her\nscrutiny, into a thousand minor points: the things in the shops, the\ntypes of character and manner of occupation shown in the passing faces,\nthe street signs, the names of the hotels they passed, the motley\nbrightness of the flower-carts, the identity of the churches and public\nbuildings that caught her eye. But what she liked best, he divined, was\nthe mere fact of being free to walk abroad in the bright air, her\ntongue rattling on as it pleased, while her feet kept time to the mighty\norchestration of the city's sounds. Her delight in the fresh air, in\nthe freedom, light and sparkle of the morning, gave him a sudden insight\ninto her stifled past; nor was it indifferent to him to perceive\nhow much his presence evidently added to her enjoyment. If only as a\nsympathetic ear, he guessed what he must be worth to her. The girl\nhad been dying for some one to talk to, some one before whom she could\nunfold and shake out to the light her poor little shut-away emotions.\nYears of repression were revealed in her sudden burst of confidence; and\nthe pity she inspired made Darrow long to fill her few free hours to the\nbrim.\n\nShe had the gift of rapid definition, and his questions as to the life\nshe had led with the Farlows, during the interregnum between the Hoke\nand Murrett eras, called up before him a queer little corner of Parisian\nexistence. The Farlows themselves--he a painter, she a \"magazine\nwriter\"--rose before him in all their incorruptible simplicity: an\nelderly New England couple, with vague yearnings for enfranchisement,\nwho lived in Paris as if it were a Massachusetts suburb, and dwelt\nhopefully on the \"higher side\" of the Gallic nature. With equal\nvividness she set before him the component figures of the circle from\nwhich Mrs. Farlow drew the \"Inner Glimpses of French Life\" appearing\nover her name in a leading New England journal: the Roumanian lady who\nhad sent them tickets for her tragedy, an elderly French gentleman\nwho, on the strength of a week's stay at Folkestone, translated English\nfiction for the provincial press, a lady from Wichita, Kansas, who\nadvocated free love and the abolition of the corset, a clergyman's\nwidow from Torquay who had written an \"English Ladies' Guide to Foreign\nGalleries\" and a Russian sculptor who lived on nuts and was \"almost\ncertainly\" an anarchist. It was this nucleus, and its outer ring\nof musical, architectural and other American students, which posed\nsuccessively to Mrs. Farlow's versatile fancy as a centre of \"University\nLife\", a \"Salon of the Faubourg St. Germain\", a group of Parisian\n\"Intellectuals\" or a \"Cross-section of Montmartre\"; but even her faculty\nfor extracting from it the most varied literary effects had not sufficed\nto create a permanent demand for the \"Inner Glimpses\", and there\nwere days when--Mr. Farlow's landscapes being equally unmarketable--a\ntemporary withdrawal to the country (subsequently utilized as \"Peeps\ninto Chateau Life\") became necessary to the courageous couple.\n\nFive years of Mrs. Murrett's world, while increasing Sophy's tenderness\nfor the Farlows, had left her with few illusions as to their power of\nadvancing her fortunes; and she did not conceal from Darrow that\nher theatrical projects were of the vaguest. They hung mainly on the\nproblematical good-will of an ancient comedienne, with whom Mrs. Farlow\nhad a slight acquaintance (extensively utilized in \"Stars of the French\nFootlights\" and \"Behind the Scenes at the Francais\"), and who had once,\nwith signs of approval, heard Miss Viner recite the Nuit de Mai.\n\n\"But of course I know how much that's worth,\" the girl broke off, with\none of her flashes of shrewdness. \"And besides, it isn't likely that a\npoor old fossil like Mme. Dolle could get anybody to listen to her now,\neven if she really thought I had talent. But she might introduce me to\npeople; or at least give me a few tips. If I could manage to earn enough\nto pay for lessons I'd go straight to some of the big people and work\nwith them. I'm rather hoping the Farlows may find me a chance of that\nkind--an engagement with some American family in Paris who would want to\nbe 'gone round' with like the Hokes, and who'd leave me time enough to\nstudy.\"\n\nIn the rue de la Chaise they learned little except the exact address\nof the Farlows, and the fact that they had sub-let their flat before\nleaving. This information obtained, Darrow proposed to Miss Viner that\nthey should stroll along the quays to a little restaurant looking out on\nthe Seine, and there, over the plat du jour, consider the next step\nto be taken. The long walk had given her cheeks a glow indicative of\nwholesome hunger, and she made no difficulty about satisfying it in\nDarrow's company. Regaining the river they walked on in the direction\nof Notre Dame, delayed now and again by the young man's irresistible\ntendency to linger over the bookstalls, and by his ever-fresh response\nto the shifting beauties of the scene. For two years his eyes had been\nsubdued to the atmospheric effects of London, to the mysterious fusion\nof darkly-piled city and low-lying bituminous sky; and the transparency\nof the French air, which left the green gardens and silvery stones so\nclassically clear yet so softly harmonized, struck him as having a kind\nof conscious intelligence. Every line of the architecture, every arch\nof the bridges, the very sweep of the strong bright river between them,\nwhile contributing to this effect, sent forth each a separate appeal\nto some sensitive memory; so that, for Darrow, a walk through the Paris\nstreets was always like the unrolling of a vast tapestry from which\ncountless stored fragrances were shaken out.\n\nIt was a proof of the richness and multiplicity of the spectacle that\nit served, without incongruity, for so different a purpose as the\nbackground of Miss Viner's enjoyment. As a mere drop-scene for her\npersonal adventure it was just as much in its place as in the evocation\nof great perspectives of feeling. For her, as he again perceived when\nthey were seated at their table in a low window above the Seine, Paris\nwas \"Paris\" by virtue of all its entertaining details, its endless\ningenuities of pleasantness. Where else, for instance, could one\nfind the dear little dishes of hors d'oeuvre, the symmetrically-laid\nanchovies and radishes, the thin golden shells of butter, or the wood\nstrawberries and brown jars of cream that gave to their repast the last\nrefinement of rusticity? Hadn't he noticed, she asked, that cooking\nalways expressed the national character, and that French food was\nclever and amusing just because the people were? And in private houses,\neverywhere, how the dishes always resembled the talk--how the very\nsame platitudes seemed to go into people's mouths and come out of them?\nCouldn't he see just what kind of menu it would make, if a fairy waved a\nwand and suddenly turned the conversation at a London dinner into joints\nand puddings? She always thought it a good sign when people liked Irish\nstew; it meant that they enjoyed changes and surprises, and taking life\nas it came; and such a beautiful Parisian version of the dish as the\nnavarin that was just being set before them was like the very best kind\nof talk--the kind when one could never tell before-hand just what was\ngoing to be said!\n\nDarrow, as he watched her enjoyment of their innocent feast, wondered if\nher vividness and vivacity were signs of her calling. She was the kind\nof girl in whom certain people would instantly have recognized the\nhistrionic gift. But experience had led him to think that, except at the\ncreative moment, the divine flame burns low in its possessors. The one\nor two really intelligent actresses he had known had struck him, in\nconversation, as either bovine or primitively \"jolly\". He had a notion\nthat, save in the mind of genius, the creative process absorbs too\nmuch of the whole stuff of being to leave much surplus for personal\nexpression; and the girl before him, with her changing face and flexible\nfancies, seemed destined to work in life itself rather than in any of\nits counterfeits.\n\nThe coffee and liqueurs were already on the table when her mind suddenly\nsprang back to the Farlows. She jumped up with one of her subversive\nmovements and declared that she must telegraph at once. Darrow called\nfor writing materials and room was made at her elbow for the parched\nink-bottle and saturated blotter of the Parisian restaurant; but the\nmere sight of these jaded implements seemed to paralyze Miss Viner's\nfaculties. She hung over the telegraph-form with anxiously-drawn brow,\nthe tip of the pen-handle pressed against her lip; and at length she\nraised her troubled eyes to Darrow's.\n\n\"I simply can't think how to say it.\"\n\n\"What--that you're staying over to see Cerdine?\"\n\n\"But AM I--am I, really?\" The joy of it flamed over her face.\n\nDarrow looked at his watch. \"You could hardly get an answer to your\ntelegram in time to take a train to Joigny this afternoon, even if you\nfound your friends could have you.\"\n\nShe mused for a moment, tapping her lip with the pen. \"But I must let\nthem know I'm here. I must find out as soon as possible if they CAN,\nhave me.\" She laid the pen down despairingly. \"I never COULD write a\ntelegram!\" she sighed.\n\n\"Try a letter, then and tell them you'll arrive tomorrow.\"\n\nThis suggestion produced immediate relief, and she gave an energetic dab\nat the ink-bottle; but after another interval of uncertain scratching\nshe paused again. \"Oh, it's fearful! I don't know what on earth to say. I\nwouldn't for the world have them know how beastly Mrs. Murrett's been.\"\n\nDarrow did not think it necessary to answer. It was no business of his,\nafter all. He lit a cigar and leaned back in his seat, letting his eyes\ntake their fill of indolent pleasure. In the throes of invention she\nhad pushed back her hat, loosening the stray lock which had invited his\ntouch the night before. After looking at it for a while he stood up and\nwandered to the window.\n\nBehind him he heard her pen scrape on.\n\n\"I don't want to worry them--I'm so certain they've got bothers of their\nown.\" The faltering scratches ceased again. \"I wish I weren't such an\nidiot about writing: all the words get frightened and scurry away when\nI try to catch them.\" He glanced back at her with a smile as she bent\nabove her task like a school-girl struggling with a \"composition.\" Her\nflushed cheek and frowning brow showed that her difficulty was genuine\nand not an artless device to draw him to her side. She was really\npowerless to put her thoughts in writing, and the inability seemed\ncharacteristic of her quick impressionable mind, and of the incessant\ncome-and-go of her sensations. He thought of Anna Leath's letters, or\nrather of the few he had received, years ago, from the girl who had been\nAnna Summers. He saw the slender firm strokes of the pen, recalled the\nclear structure of the phrases, and, by an abrupt association of ideas,\nremembered that, at that very hour, just such a document might be\nawaiting him at the hotel.\n\nWhat if it were there, indeed, and had brought him a complete\nexplanation of her telegram? The revulsion of feeling produced by this\nthought made him look at the girl with sudden impatience. She struck him\nas positively stupid, and he wondered how he could have wasted half his\nday with her, when all the while Mrs. Leath's letter might be lying on\nhis table. At that moment, if he could have chosen, he would have left\nhis companion on the spot; but he had her on his hands, and must accept\nthe consequences.\n\nSome odd intuition seemed to make her conscious of his change of mood,\nfor she sprang from her seat, crumpling the letter in her hand.\n\n\"I'm too stupid; but I won't keep you any longer. I'll go back to the\nhotel and write there.\"\n\nHer colour deepened, and for the first time, as their eyes met, he\nnoticed a faint embarrassment in hers. Could it be that his nearness\nwas, after all, the cause of her confusion? The thought turned his vague\nimpatience with her into a definite resentment toward himself. There was\nreally no excuse for his having blundered into such an adventure. Why\nhad he not shipped the girl off to Joigny by the evening train, instead\nof urging her to delay, and using Cerdine as a pretext? Paris was full\nof people he knew, and his annoyance was increased by the thought that\nsome friend of Mrs. Leath's might see him at the play, and report his\npresence there with a suspiciously good-looking companion. The idea was\ndistinctly disagreeable: he did not want the woman he adored to think he\ncould forget her for a moment. And by this time he had fully persuaded\nhimself that a letter from her was awaiting him, and had even gone so\nfar as to imagine that its contents might annul the writer's telegraphed\ninjunction, and call him to her side at once...\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nAt the porter's desk a brief \"Pas de lettres\" fell destructively on the\nfabric of these hopes. Mrs. Leath had not written--she had not taken the\ntrouble to explain her telegram. Darrow turned away with a sharp pang\nof humiliation. Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and\nfears. He had put his question to the porter once before, on returning\nto the hotel after luncheon; and now, coming back again in the late\nafternoon, he was met by the same denial. The second post was in, and\nhad brought him nothing.\n\nA glance at his watch showed that he had barely time to dress before\ntaking Miss Viner out to dine; but as he turned to the lift a new\nthought struck him, and hurrying back into the hall he dashed off\nanother telegram to his servant: \"Have you forwarded any letter with\nFrench postmark today? Telegraph answer Terminus.\"\n\nSome kind of reply would be certain to reach him on his return from the\ntheatre, and he would then know definitely whether Mrs. Leath meant\nto write or not. He hastened up to his room and dressed with a lighter\nheart.\n\nMiss Viner's vagrant trunk had finally found its way to its owner;\nand, clad in such modest splendour as it furnished, she shone at Darrow\nacross their restaurant table. In the reaction of his wounded vanity he\nfound her prettier and more interesting than before. Her dress, sloping\naway from the throat, showed the graceful set of her head on its slender\nneck, and the wide brim of her hat arched above her hair like a dusky\nhalo. Pleasure danced in her eyes and on her lips, and as she shone on\nhim between the candle-shades Darrow felt that he should not be at all\nsorry to be seen with her in public. He even sent a careless glance\nabout him in the vague hope that it might fall on an acquaintance.\n\nAt the theatre her vivacity sank into a breathless hush, and she sat\nintent in her corner of their baignoire, with the gaze of a neophyte\nabout to be initiated into the sacred mysteries. Darrow placed himself\nbehind her, that he might catch her profile between himself and the\nstage. He was touched by the youthful seriousness of her expression. In\nspite of the experiences she must have had, and of the twenty-four\nyears to which she owned, she struck him as intrinsically young; and he\nwondered how so evanescent a quality could have been preserved in the\ndesiccating Murrett air. As the play progressed he noticed that her\nimmobility was traversed by swift flashes of perception. She was not\nmissing anything, and her intensity of attention when Cerdine was on the\nstage drew an anxious line between her brows.\n\nAfter the first act she remained for a few minutes rapt and motionless;\nthen she turned to her companion with a quick patter of questions. He\ngathered from them that she had been less interested in following\nthe general drift of the play than in observing the details of its\ninterpretation. Every gesture and inflection of the great actress's\nhad been marked and analyzed; and Darrow felt a secret gratification in\nbeing appealed to as an authority on the histrionic art. His interest in\nit had hitherto been merely that of the cultivated young man curious of\nall forms of artistic expression; but in reply to her questions he found\nthings to say about it which evidently struck his listener as impressive\nand original, and with which he himself was not, on the whole,\ndissatisfied. Miss Viner was much more concerned to hear his views\nthan to express her own, and the deference with which she received his\ncomments called from him more ideas about the theatre than he had ever\nsupposed himself to possess.\n\nWith the second act she began to give more attention to the development\nof the play, though her interest was excited rather by what she called\n\"the story\" than by the conflict of character producing it. Oddly\ncombined with her sharp apprehension of things theatrical, her knowledge\nof technical \"dodges\" and green-room precedents, her glibness about\n\"lines\" and \"curtains\", was the primitive simplicity of her attitude\ntoward the tale itself, as toward something that was \"really happening\"\nand at which one assisted as at a street-accident or a quarrel overheard\nin the next room. She wanted to know if Darrow thought the lovers\n\"really would\" be involved in the catastrophe that threatened them,\nand when he reminded her that his predictions were disqualified by his\nhaving already seen the play, she exclaimed: \"Oh, then, please don't\ntell me what's going to happen!\" and the next moment was questioning\nhim about Cerdine's theatrical situation and her private history. On the\nlatter point some of her enquiries were of a kind that it is not in\nthe habit of young girls to make, or even to know how to make; but her\napparent unconsciousness of the fact seemed rather to reflect on her\npast associates than on herself.\n\nWhen the second act was over, Darrow suggested their taking a turn\nin the foyer; and seated on one of its cramped red velvet sofas they\nwatched the crowd surge up and down in a glare of lights and gilding.\nThen, as she complained of the heat, he led her through the press to the\ncongested cafe at the foot of the stairs, where orangeades were thrust\nat them between the shoulders of packed consommateurs and Darrow,\nlighting a cigarette while she sucked her straw, knew the primitive\ncomplacency of the man at whose companion other men stare.\n\nOn a corner of their table lay a smeared copy of a theatrical journal.\nIt caught Sophy's eye and after poring over the page she looked up with\nan excited exclamation.\n\n\"They're giving Oedipe tomorrow afternoon at the Francais! I suppose\nyou've seen it heaps and heaps of times?\"\n\nHe smiled back at her. \"You must see it too. We'll go tomorrow.\"\n\nShe sighed at his suggestion, but without discarding it. \"How can I? The\nlast train for Joigny leaves at four.\"\n\n\"But you don't know yet that your friends will want you.\"\n\n\"I shall know tomorrow early. I asked Mrs. Farlow to telegraph as soon\nas she got my letter.\" A twinge of compunction shot through Darrow. Her\nwords recalled to him that on their return to the hotel after luncheon\nshe had given him her letter to post, and that he had never thought of\nit again. No doubt it was still in the pocket of the coat he had taken\noff when he dressed for dinner. In his perturbation he pushed back his\nchair, and the movement made her look up at him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Only--you know I don't fancy that letter can have caught this\nafternoon's post.\"\n\n\"Not caught it? Why not?\"\n\n\"Why, I'm afraid it will have been too late.\" He bent his head to light\nanother cigarette.\n\nShe struck her hands together with a gesture which, to his amusement, he\nnoticed she had caught from Cerdine.\n\n\"Oh, dear, I hadn't thought of that! But surely it will reach them in\nthe morning?\"\n\n\"Some time in the morning, I suppose. You know the French provincial\npost is never in a hurry. I don't believe your letter would have been\ndelivered this evening in any case.\" As this idea occurred to him he\nfelt himself almost absolved.\n\n\"Perhaps, then, I ought to have telegraphed?\"\n\n\"I'll telegraph for you in the morning if you say so.\"\n\nThe bell announcing the close of the entr'-acte shrilled through the\ncafe, and she sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Oh, come, come! We mustn't miss it!\"\n\nInstantly forgetful of the Farlows, she slipped her arm through his and\nturned to push her way back to the theatre.\n\nAs soon as the curtain went up she as promptly forgot her companion.\nWatching her from the corner to which he had returned, Darrow saw that\ngreat waves of sensation were beating deliciously against her brain. It\nwas as though every starved sensibility were throwing out feelers to the\nmounting tide; as though everything she was seeing, hearing, imagining,\nrushed in to fill the void of all she had always been denied.\n\nDarrow, as he observed her, again felt a detached enjoyment in her\npleasure. She was an extraordinary conductor of sensation: she seemed to\ntransmit it physically, in emanations that set the blood dancing in his\nveins. He had not often had the opportunity of studying the effects of a\nperfectly fresh impression on so responsive a temperament, and he felt a\nfleeting desire to make its chords vibrate for his own amusement.\n\nAt the end of the next act she discovered with dismay that in their\ntransit to the cafe she had lost the beautiful pictured programme he\nhad bought for her. She wanted to go back and hunt for it, but Darrow\nassured her that he would have no trouble in getting her another. When\nhe went out in quest of it she followed him protestingly to the door of\nthe box, and he saw that she was distressed at the thought of his having\nto spend an additional franc for her. This frugality smote Darrow by its\ncontrast to her natural bright profusion; and again he felt the desire\nto right so clumsy an injustice.\n\nWhen he returned to the box she was still standing in the doorway,\nand he noticed that his were not the only eyes attracted to her. Then\nanother impression sharply diverted his attention. Above the fagged\nfaces of the Parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance\nof Owen Leath signalling a joyful recognition. The young man, slim and\neager, had detached himself from two companions of his own type, and\nwas seeking to push through the press to his step-mother's friend. The\nencounter, to Darrow, could hardly have been more inopportune; it woke\nin him a confusion of feelings of which only the uppermost was allayed\nby seeing Sophy Viner, as if instinctively warned, melt back into the\nshadow of their box.\n\nA minute later Owen Leath was at his side. \"I was sure it was you! Such\nluck to run across you! Won't you come off with us to supper after it's\nover? Montmartre, or wherever else you please. Those two chaps over\nthere are friends of mine, at the Beaux Arts; both of them rather good\nfellows--and we'd be so glad----\"\n\nFor half a second Darrow read in his hospitable eye the termination \"if\nyou'd bring the lady too\"; then it deflected into: \"We'd all be so glad\nif you'd come.\"\n\nDarrow, excusing himself with thanks, lingered on for a few minutes'\nchat, in which every word, and every tone of his companion's voice, was\nlike a sharp light flashed into aching eyes. He was glad when the bell\ncalled the audience to their seats, and young Leath left him with the\nfriendly question: \"We'll see you at Givre later on?\"\n\nWhen he rejoined Miss Viner, Darrow's first care was to find out, by a\nrapid inspection of the house, whether Owen Leath's seat had given him a\nview of their box. But the young man was not visible from it, and Darrow\nconcluded that he had been recognized in the corridor and not at his\ncompanion's side. He scarcely knew why it seemed to him so important\nthat this point should be settled; certainly his sense of reassurance\nwas less due to regard for Miss Viner than to the persistent vision of\ngrave offended eyes...\n\nDuring the drive back to the hotel this vision was persistently kept\nbefore him by the thought that the evening post might have brought a\nletter from Mrs. Leath. Even if no letter had yet come, his servant\nmight have telegraphed to say that one was on its way; and at the\nthought his interest in the girl at his side again cooled to the\nfraternal, the almost fatherly. She was no more to him, after all, than\nan appealing young creature to whom it was mildly agreeable to have\noffered an evening's diversion; and when, as they rolled into the\nilluminated court of the hotel, she turned with a quick movement which\nbrought her happy face close to his, he leaned away, affecting to be\nabsorbed in opening the door of the cab.\n\nAt the desk the night porter, after a vain search through the\npigeon-holes, was disposed to think that a letter or telegram had in\nfact been sent up for the gentleman; and Darrow, at the announcement,\ncould hardly wait to ascend to his room. Upstairs, he and his companion\nhad the long dimly-lit corridor to themselves, and Sophy paused on her\nthreshold, gathering up in one hand the pale folds of her cloak, while\nshe held the other out to Darrow.\n\n\"If the telegram comes early I shall be off by the first train; so I\nsuppose this is good-bye,\" she said, her eyes dimmed by a little shadow\nof regret.\n\nDarrow, with a renewed start of contrition, perceived that he had again\nforgotten her letter; and as their hands met he vowed to himself that\nthe moment she had left him he would dash down stairs to post it.\n\n\"Oh, I'll see you in the morning, of course!\"\n\nA tremor of pleasure crossed her face as he stood before her, smiling a\nlittle uncertainly.\n\n\"At any rate,\" she said, \"I want to thank you now for my good day.\"\n\nHe felt in her hand the same tremor he had seen in her face. \"But it's\nYOU, on the contrary--\" he began, lifting the hand to his lips.\n\nAs he dropped it, and their eyes met, something passed through hers that\nwas like a light carried rapidly behind a curtained window.\n\n\"Good night; you must be awfully tired,\" he said with a friendly\nabruptness, turning away without even waiting to see her pass into her\nroom. He unlocked his door, and stumbling over the threshold groped in\nthe darkness for the electric button. The light showed him a telegram on\nthe table, and he forgot everything else as he caught it up.\n\n\"No letter from France,\" the message read.\n\nIt fell from Darrow's hand to the floor, and he dropped into a chair\nby the table and sat gazing at the dingy drab and olive pattern of\nthe carpet. She had not written, then; she had not written, and it\nwas manifest now that she did not mean to write. If she had had any\nintention of explaining her telegram she would certainly, within\ntwenty-four hours, have followed it up by a letter. But she evidently\ndid not intend to explain it, and her silence could mean only that she\nhad no explanation to give, or else that she was too indifferent to be\naware that one was needed.\n\nDarrow, face to face with these alternatives, felt a recrudescence of\nboyish misery. It was no longer his hurt vanity that cried out. He told\nhimself that he could have borne an equal amount of pain, if only it had\nleft Mrs. Leath's image untouched; but he could not bear to think of her\nas trivial or insincere. The thought was so intolerable that he felt a\nblind desire to punish some one else for the pain it caused him.\n\nAs he sat moodily staring at the carpet its silly intricacies melted\ninto a blur from which the eyes of Mrs. Leath again looked out at him.\nHe saw the fine sweep of her brows, and the deep look beneath them as\nshe had turned from him on their last evening in London. \"This will be\ngood-bye, then,\" she had said; and it occurred to him that her parting\nphrase had been the same as Sophy Viner's.\n\nAt the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the\ncoat in which he had left Miss Viner's letter. The clock marked the\nthird quarter after midnight, and he knew it would make no difference\nif he went down to the post-box now or early the next morning; but he\nwanted to clear his conscience, and having found the letter he went to\nthe door.\n\nA sound in the next room made him pause. He had become conscious again\nthat, a few feet off, on the other side of a thin partition, a small\nkeen flame of life was quivering and agitating the air. Sophy's face\ncame hack to him insistently. It was as vivid now as Mrs. Leath's had\nbeen a moment earlier. He recalled with a faint smile of retrospective\npleasure the girl's enjoyment of her evening, and the innumerable fine\nfeelers of sensation she had thrown out to its impressions.\n\nIt gave him a curiously close sense of her presence to think that at\nthat moment she was living over her enjoyment as intensely as he was\nliving over his unhappiness. His own case was irremediable, but it was\neasy enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure. And did she not\nperhaps secretly expect it of him? After all, if she had been very\nanxious to join her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching\nParis, instead of writing. He wondered now that he had not been struck\nat the moment by so artless a device to gain more time. The fact of her\nhaving practised it did not make him think less well of her; it merely\nstrengthened the impulse to use his opportunity. She was starving, poor\nchild, for a little amusement, a little personal life--why not give\nher the chance of another day in Paris? If he did so, should he not be\nmerely falling in with her own hopes?\n\nAt the thought his sympathy for her revived. She became of absorbing\ninterest to him as an escape from himself and an object about which his\nthwarted activities could cluster. He felt less drearily alone because\nof her being there, on the other side of the door, and in his gratitude\nto her for giving him this relief he began, with indolent amusement, to\nplan new ways of detaining her. He dropped back into his chair, lit a\ncigar, and smiled a little at the image of her smiling face. He tried to\nimagine what incident of the day she was likely to be recalling at that\nparticular moment, and what part he probably played in it. That it\nwas not a small part he was certain, and the knowledge was undeniably\npleasant.\n\nNow and then a sound from her room brought before him more vividly\nthe reality of the situation and the strangeness of the vast swarming\nsolitude in which he and she were momentarily isolated, amid long lines\nof rooms each holding its separate secret. The nearness of all these\nother mysteries enclosing theirs gave Darrow a more intimate sense of\nthe girl's presence, and through the fumes of his cigar his imagination\ncontinued to follow her to and fro, traced the curve of her slim young\narms as she raised them to undo her hair, pictured the sliding down of\nher dress to the waist and then to the knees, and the whiteness of her\nfeet as she slipped across the floor to bed...\n\nHe stood up and shook himself with a yawn, throwing away the end of\nhis cigar. His glance, in following it, lit on the telegram which had\ndropped to the floor. The sounds in the next room had ceased, and once\nmore he felt alone and unhappy.\n\nOpening the window, he folded his arms on the sill and looked out on the\nvast light-spangled mass of the city, and then up at the dark sky, in\nwhich the morning planet stood.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nAt the Theatre Francais, the next afternoon, Darrow yawned and fidgeted\nin his seat.\n\nThe day was warm, the theatre crowded and airless, and the performance,\nit seemed to him, intolerably bad. He stole a glance at his companion,\nwondering if she shared his feelings. Her rapt profile betrayed no\nunrest, but politeness might have caused her to feign an interest that\nshe did not feel. He leaned back impatiently, stifling another yawn,\nand trying to fix his attention on the stage. Great things were going\nforward there, and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the\nancient drama. But the interpretation of the play seemed to him as\nairless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre. The players were\nthe same whom he had often applauded in those very parts, and perhaps\nthat fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality\nproduced by their performance. Surely it was time to infuse new blood\ninto the veins of the moribund art. He had the impression that the\nghosts of actors were giving a spectral performance on the shores of\nStyx.\n\nCertainly it was not the most profitable way for a young man with a\npretty companion to pass the golden hours of a spring afternoon. The\nfreshness of the face at his side, reflecting the freshness of the\nseason, suggested dapplings of sunlight through new leaves, the sound of\na brook in the grass, the ripple of tree-shadows over breezy meadows...\n\nWhen at length the fateful march of the cothurns was stayed by the\nsingle pause in the play, and Darrow had led Miss Viner out on the\nbalcony overhanging the square before the theatre, he turned to see if\nshe shared his feelings. But the rapturous look she gave him checked the\ndepreciation on his lips.\n\n\"Oh, why did you bring me out here? One ought to creep away and sit in\nthe dark till it begins again!\"\n\n\"Is THAT the way they made you feel?\"\n\n\"Didn't they _YOU?_...As if the gods were there all the while, just behind\nthem, pulling the strings?\" Her hands were pressed against the railing,\nher face shining and darkening under the wing-beats of successive\nimpressions.\n\nDarrow smiled in enjoyment of her pleasure. After all, he had felt all\nthat, long ago; perhaps it was his own fault, rather than that of the\nactors, that the poetry of the play seemed to have evaporated...But no,\nhe had been right in judging the performance to be dull and stale:\nit was simply his companion's inexperience, her lack of occasions to\ncompare and estimate, that made her think it brilliant.\n\n\"I was afraid you were bored and wanted to come away.\"\n\n\"BORED?\" She made a little aggrieved grimace. \"You mean you thought me\ntoo ignorant and stupid to appreciate it?\"\n\n\"No; not that.\" The hand nearest him still lay on the railing of the\nbalcony, and he covered it for a moment with his. As he did so he saw\nthe colour rise and tremble in her cheek.\n\n\"Tell me just what you think,\" he said, bending his head a little, and\nonly half-aware of his words.\n\nShe did not turn her face to his, but began to talk rapidly, trying\nto convey something of what she felt. But she was evidently unused to\nanalyzing her aesthetic emotions, and the tumultuous rush of the drama\nseemed to have left her in a state of panting wonder, as though it had\nbeen a storm or some other natural cataclysm. She had no literary or\nhistoric associations to which to attach her impressions: her education\nhad evidently not comprised a course in Greek literature. But she felt\nwhat would probably have been unperceived by many a young lady who had\ntaken a first in classics: the ineluctable fatality of the tale, the\ndread sway in it of the same mysterious \"luck\" which pulled the threads\nof her own small destiny. It was not literature to her, it was fact: as\nactual, as near by, as what was happening to her at the moment and what\nthe next hour held in store. Seen in this light, the play regained for\nDarrow its supreme and poignant reality. He pierced to the heart of\nits significance through all the artificial accretions with which his\ntheories of art and the conventions of the stage had clothed it, and saw\nit as he had never seen it: as life.\n\nAfter this there could be no question of flight, and he took her back to\nthe theatre, content to receive his own sensations through the medium of\nhers. But with the continuation of the play, and the oppression of the\nheavy air, his attention again began to wander, straying back over the\nincidents of the morning.\n\nHe had been with Sophy Viner all day, and he was surprised to find\nhow quickly the time had gone. She had hardly attempted, as the hours\npassed, to conceal her satisfaction on finding that no telegram came\nfrom the Farlows. \"They'll have written,\" she had simply said; and her\nmind had at once flown on to the golden prospect of an afternoon at the\ntheatre. The intervening hours had been disposed of in a stroll through\nthe lively streets, and a repast, luxuriously lingered over, under\nthe chestnut-boughs of a restaurant in the Champs Elysees. Everything\nentertained and interested her, and Darrow remarked, with an amused\ndetachment, that she was not insensible to the impression her charms\nproduced. Yet there was no hard edge of vanity in her sense of her\nprettiness: she seemed simply to be aware of it as a note in the general\nharmony, and to enjoy sounding the note as a singer enjoys singing.\n\nAfter luncheon, as they sat over their coffee, she had again asked\nan immense number of questions and delivered herself of a remarkable\nvariety of opinions. Her questions testified to a wholesome and\ncomprehensive human curiosity, and her comments showed, like her\nface and her whole attitude, an odd mingling of precocious wisdom and\ndisarming ignorance. When she talked to him about \"life\"--the word was\noften on her lips--she seemed to him like a child playing with a tiger's\ncub; and he said to himself that some day the child would grow up--and\nso would the tiger. Meanwhile, such expertness qualified by such candour\nmade it impossible to guess the extent of her personal experience, or\nto estimate its effect on her character. She might be any one of a dozen\ndefinable types, or she might--more disconcertingly to her companion and\nmore perilously to herself--be a shifting and uncrystallized mixture of\nthem all.\n\nHer talk, as usual, had promptly reverted to the stage. She was eager\nto learn about every form of dramatic expression which the metropolis\nof things theatrical had to offer, and her curiosity ranged from the\nofficial temples of the art to its less hallowed haunts. Her searching\nenquiries about a play whose production, on one of the latter scenes,\nhad provoked a considerable amount of scandal, led Darrow to throw out\nlaughingly: \"To see THAT you'll have to wait till you're married!\" and\nhis answer had sent her off at a tangent.\n\n\"Oh, I never mean to marry,\" she had rejoined in a tone of youthful\nfinality.\n\n\"I seem to have heard that before!\"\n\n\"Yes; from girls who've only got to choose!\" Her eyes had grown suddenly\nalmost old. \"I'd like you to see the only men who've ever wanted to\nmarry me! One was the doctor on the steamer, when I came abroad with the\nHokes: he'd been cashiered from the navy for drunkenness. The other was\na deaf widower with three grown-up daughters, who kept a clock-shop in\nBayswater!--Besides,\" she rambled on, \"I'm not so sure that I believe\nin marriage. You see I'm all for self-development and the chance to live\none's life. I'm awfully modern, you know.\"\n\nIt was just when she proclaimed herself most awfully modern that she\nstruck him as most helplessly backward; yet the moment after, without\nany bravado, or apparent desire to assume an attitude, she would\npropound some social axiom which could have been gathered only in the\nbitter soil of experience.\n\nAll these things came back to him as he sat beside her in the theatre\nand watched her ingenuous absorption. It was on \"the story\" that her\nmind was fixed, and in life also, he suspected, it would always be \"the\nstory\", rather than its remoter imaginative issues, that would hold her.\nHe did not believe there were ever any echoes in her soul...\n\nThere was no question, however, that what she felt was felt with\nintensity: to the actual, the immediate, she spread vibrating strings.\nWhen the play was over, and they came out once more into the sunlight,\nDarrow looked down at her with a smile.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\nShe made no answer. Her dark gaze seemed to rest on him without seeing\nhim. Her cheeks and lips were pale, and the loose hair under her\nhat-brim clung to her forehead in damp rings. She looked like a young\npriestess still dazed by the fumes of the cavern.\n\n\"You poor child--it's been almost too much for you!\"\n\nShe shook her head with a vague smile.\n\n\"Come,\" he went on, putting his hand on her arm, \"let's jump into a taxi\nand get some air and sunshine. Look, there are hours of daylight left;\nand see what a night it's going to be!\"\n\nHe pointed over their heads, to where a white moon hung in the misty\nblue above the roofs of the rue de Rivoli.\n\nShe made no answer, and he signed to a motor-cab, calling out to the\ndriver: \"To the Bois!\"\n\nAs the carriage turned toward the Tuileries she roused herself. \"I must\ngo first to the hotel. There may be a message--at any rate I must decide\non something.\"\n\nDarrow saw that the reality of the situation had suddenly forced itself\nupon her. \"I MUST decide on something,\" she repeated.\n\nHe would have liked to postpone the return, to persuade her to drive\ndirectly to the Bois for dinner. It would have been easy enough to\nremind her that she could not start for Joigny that evening, and that\ntherefore it was of no moment whether she received the Farlows' answer\nthen or a few hours later; but for some reason he hesitated to use this\nargument, which had come so naturally to him the day before. After all,\nhe knew she would find nothing at the hotel--so what did it matter if\nthey went there?\n\nThe porter, interrogated, was not sure. He himself had received nothing\nfor the lady, but in his absence his subordinate might have sent a\nletter upstairs.\n\nDarrow and Sophy mounted together in the lift, and the young man, while\nshe went into her room, unlocked his own door and glanced at the empty\ntable. For him at least no message had come; and on her threshold, a\nmoment later, she met him with the expected: \"No--there's nothing!\"\n\nHe feigned an unregretful surprise. \"So much the better! And now, shall\nwe drive out somewhere? Or would you rather take a boat to Bellevue?\nHave you ever dined there, on the terrace, by moonlight? It's not at all\nbad. And there's no earthly use in sitting here waiting.\"\n\nShe stood before him in perplexity.\n\n\"But when I wrote yesterday I asked them to telegraph. I suppose they're\nhorribly hard up, the poor dears, and they thought a letter would do\nas well as a telegram.\" The colour had risen to her face. \"That's why I\nwrote instead of telegraphing; I haven't a penny to spare myself!\"\n\nNothing she could have said could have filled her listener with a deeper\ncontrition. He felt the red in his own face as he recalled the motive\nwith which he had credited her in his midnight musings. But that motive,\nafter all, had simply been trumped up to justify his own disloyalty: he\nhad never really believed in it. The reflection deepened his confusion,\nand he would have liked to take her hand in his and confess the\ninjustice he had done her.\n\nShe may have interpreted his change of colour as an involuntary protest\nat being initiated into such shabby details, for she went on with a\nlaugh: \"I suppose you can hardly understand what it means to have to\nstop and think whether one can afford a telegram? But I've always had to\nconsider such things. And I mustn't stay here any longer now--I must try\nto get a night train for Joigny. Even if the Farlows can't take me in,\nI can go to the hotel: it will cost less than staying here.\" She paused\nagain and then exclaimed: \"I ought to have thought of that sooner; I\nought to have telegraphed yesterday! But I was sure I should hear from\nthem today; and I wanted--oh, I DID so awfully want to stay!\" She threw\na troubled look at Darrow. \"Do you happen to remember,\" she asked, \"what\ntime it was when you posted my letter?\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nDarrow was still standing on her threshold. As she put the question he\nentered the room and closed the door behind him.\n\nHis heart was beating a little faster than usual and he had no clear\nidea of what he was about to do or say, beyond the definite conviction\nthat, whatever passing impulse of expiation moved him, he would not be\nfool enough to tell her that he had not sent her letter. He knew that\nmost wrongdoing works, on the whole, less mischief than its useless\nconfession; and this was clearly a case where a passing folly might be\nturned, by avowal, into a serious offense.\n\n\"I'm so sorry--so sorry; but you must let me help you...You will let me\nhelp you?\" he said.\n\nHe took her hands and pressed them together between his, counting on a\nfriendly touch to help out the insufficiency of words. He felt her yield\nslightly to his clasp, and hurried on without giving her time to answer.\n\n\"Isn't it a pity to spoil our good time together by regretting anything\nyou might have done to prevent our having it?\"\n\nShe drew back, freeing her hands. Her face, losing its look of appealing\nconfidence, was suddenly sharpened by distrust.\n\n\"You didn't forget to post my letter?\"\n\nDarrow stood before her, constrained and ashamed, and ever more keenly\naware that the betrayal of his distress must be a greater offense than\nits concealment.\n\n\"What an insinuation!\" he cried, throwing out his hands with a laugh.\n\nHer face instantly melted to laughter. \"Well, then--I WON'T be sorry; I\nwon't regret anything except that our good time is over!\"\n\nThe words were so unexpected that they routed all his resolves. If she\nhad gone on doubting him he could probably have gone on deceiving her;\nbut her unhesitating acceptance of his word made him hate the part he\nwas playing. At the same moment a doubt shot up its serpent-head in his\nown bosom. Was it not he rather than she who was childishly trustful?\nWas she not almost too ready to take his word, and dismiss once for all\nthe tiresome question of the letter? Considering what her experiences\nmust have been, such trustfulness seemed open to suspicion. But the\nmoment his eyes fell on her he was ashamed of the thought, and knew it\nfor what it really was: another pretext to lessen his own delinquency.\n\n\"Why should our good time be over?\" he asked. \"Why shouldn't it last a\nlittle longer?\"\n\nShe looked up, her lips parted in surprise; but before she could speak\nhe went on: \"I want you to stay with me--I want you, just for a few\ndays, to have all the things you've never had. It's not always May\nand Paris--why not make the most of them now? You know me--we're not\nstrangers--why shouldn't you treat me like a friend?\"\n\nWhile he spoke she had drawn away a little, but her hand still lay in\nhis. She was pale, and her eyes were fixed on him in a gaze in which\nthere was neither distrust or resentment, but only an ingenuous wonder.\nHe was extraordinarily touched by her expression.\n\n\"Oh, do! You must. Listen: to prove that I'm sincere I'll tell\nyou...I'll tell you I didn't post your letter...I didn't post it because\nI wanted so much to give you a few good hours...and because I couldn't\nbear to have you go.\"\n\nHe had the feeling that the words were being uttered in spite of him by\nsome malicious witness of the scene, and yet that he was not sorry to\nhave them spoken.\n\nThe girl had listened to him in silence. She remained motionless for a\nmoment after he had ceased to speak; then she snatched away her hand.\n\n\"You didn't post my letter? You kept it back on purpose? And you tell\nme so NOW, to prove to me that I'd better put myself under your\nprotection?\" She burst into a laugh that had in it all the piercing\nechoes of her Murrett past, and her face, at the same moment, underwent\nthe same change, shrinking into a small malevolent white mask in which\nthe eyes burned black. \"Thank you--thank you most awfully for\ntelling me! And for all your other kind intentions! The plan's\ndelightful--really quite delightful, and I'm extremely flattered and\nobliged.\"\n\nShe dropped into a seat beside her dressing-table, resting her chin on\nher lifted hands, and laughing out at him under the elf-lock which had\nshaken itself down over her eyes.\n\nHer outburst did not offend the young man; its immediate effect was that\nof allaying his agitation. The theatrical touch in her manner made his\noffense seem more venial than he had thought it a moment before.\n\nHe drew up a chair and sat down beside her. \"After all,\" he said, in a\ntone of good-humoured protest, \"I needn't have told you I'd kept back\nyour letter; and my telling you seems rather strong proof that I hadn't\nany very nefarious designs on you.\"\n\nShe met this with a shrug, but he did not give her time to answer. \"My\ndesigns,\" he continued with a smile, \"were not nefarious. I saw you'd\nbeen through a bad time with Mrs. Murrett, and that there didn't seem\nto be much fun ahead for you; and I didn't see--and I don't yet see--the\nharm of trying to give you a few hours of amusement between a depressing\npast and a not particularly cheerful future.\" He paused again, and then\nwent on, in the same tone of friendly reasonableness: \"The mistake I\nmade was not to tell you this at once--not to ask you straight out to\ngive me a day or two, and let me try to make you forget all the things\nthat are troubling you. I was a fool not to see that if I'd put it to\nyou in that way you'd have accepted or refused, as you chose; but that\nat least you wouldn't have mistaken my intentions.--Intentions!\" He\nstood up, walked the length of the room, and turned back to where she\nstill sat motionless, her elbows propped on the dressing-table, her chin\non her hands. \"What rubbish we talk about intentions! The truth is I\nhadn't any: I just liked being with you. Perhaps you don't know how\nextraordinarily one can like being with you...I was depressed and adrift\nmyself; and you made me forget my bothers; and when I found you were\ngoing--and going back to dreariness, as I was--I didn't see why we\nshouldn't have a few hours together first; so I left your letter in my\npocket.\"\n\nHe saw her face melt as she listened, and suddenly she unclasped her\nhands and leaned to him.\n\n\"But are YOU unhappy too? Oh, I never understood--I never dreamed it! I\nthought you'd always had everything in the world you wanted!\"\n\nDarrow broke into a laugh at this ingenuous picture of his state. He\nwas ashamed of trying to better his case by an appeal to her pity, and\nannoyed with himself for alluding to a subject he would rather have\nkept out of his thoughts. But her look of sympathy had disarmed him; his\nheart was bitter and distracted; she was near him, her eyes were shining\nwith compassion--he bent over her and kissed her hand.\n\n\"Forgive me--do forgive me,\" he said.\n\nShe stood up with a smiling head-shake. \"Oh, it's not so often that\npeople try to give me any pleasure--much less two whole days of it!\nI sha'n't forget how kind you've been. I shall have plenty of time to\nremember. But this IS good-bye, you know. I must telegraph at once to\nsay I'm coming.\"\n\n\"To say you're coming? Then I'm not forgiven?\"\n\n\"Oh, you're forgiven--if that's any comfort.\"\n\n\"It's not, the very least, if your way of proving it is to go away!\"\n\nShe hung her head in meditation. \"But I can't stay.--How CAN I stay?\"\nshe broke out, as if arguing with some unseen monitor.\n\n\"Why can't you? No one knows you're here...No one need ever know.\"\n\nShe looked up, and their eyes exchanged meanings for a rapid minute. Her\ngaze was as clear as a boy's. \"Oh, it's not THAT,\" she exclaimed,\nalmost impatiently; \"it's not people I'm afraid of! They've never put\nthemselves out for me--why on earth should I care about them?\"\n\nHe liked her directness as he had never liked it before. \"Well, then,\nwhat is it? Not ME, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, not you: I like you. It's the money! With me that's always the root\nof the matter. I could never yet afford a treat in my life!\"\n\n\"Is _THAT_ all?\" He laughed, relieved by her naturalness. \"Look here;\nsince we re talking as man to man--can't you trust me about that too?\"\n\n\"Trust you? How do you mean? You'd better not trust ME!\" she laughed\nback sharply. \"I might never be able to pay up!\"\n\nHis gesture brushed aside the allusion. \"Money may be the root of the\nmatter; it can't be the whole of it, between friends. Don't you think\none friend may accept a small service from another without looking too\nfar ahead or weighing too many chances? The question turns entirely on\nwhat you think of me. If you like me well enough to be willing to take\na few days' holiday with me, just for the pleasure of the thing, and the\npleasure you'll be giving me, let's shake hands on it. If you don't like\nme well enough we'll shake hands too; only I shall be sorry,\" he ended.\n\n\"Oh, but I shall be sorry too!\" Her face, as she lifted it to his,\nlooked so small and young that Darrow felt a fugitive twinge of\ncompunction, instantly effaced by the excitement of pursuit.\n\n\"Well, then?\" He stood looking down on her, his eyes persuading her.\nHe was now intensely aware that his nearness was having an effect which\nmade it less and less necessary for him to choose his words, and he went\non, more mindful of the inflections of his voice than of what he was\nactually saying: \"Why on earth should we say good-bye if we're both\nsorry to? Won't you tell me your reason? It's not a bit like you to let\nanything stand in the way of your saying just what you feel. You mustn't\nmind offending me, you know!\"\n\nShe hung before him like a leaf on the meeting of cross-currents, that\nthe next ripple may sweep forward or whirl back. Then she flung up\nher head with the odd boyish movement habitual to her in moments of\nexcitement. \"What I feel? Do you want to know what I feel? That you're\ngiving me the only chance I've ever had!\"\n\nShe turned about on her heel and, dropping into the nearest chair, sank\nforward, her face hidden against the dressing-table.\n\nUnder the folds of her thin summer dress the modelling of her back and\nof her lifted arms, and the slight hollow between her shoulder-blades,\nrecalled the faint curves of a terra-cotta statuette, some young image\nof grace hardly more than sketched in the clay. Darrow, as he stood\nlooking at her, reflected that her character, for all its seeming\nfirmness, its flashing edges of \"opinion\", was probably no less\nimmature. He had not expected her to yield so suddenly to his\nsuggestion, or to confess her yielding in that way. At first he was\nslightly disconcerted; then he saw how her attitude simplified his own.\nHer behaviour had all the indecision and awkwardness of inexperience. It\nshowed that she was a child after all; and all he could do--all he had\never meant to do--was to give her a child's holiday to look back to.\n\nFor a moment he fancied she was crying; but the next she was on her feet\nand had swept round on him a face she must have turned away only to hide\nthe first rush of her pleasure.\n\nFor a while they shone on each other without speaking; then she sprang\nto him and held out both hands.\n\n\"Is it true? Is it really true? Is it really going to happen to ME?\"\n\nHe felt like answering: \"You're the very creature to whom it was bound\nto happen\"; but the words had a double sense that made him wince, and\ninstead he caught her proffered hands and stood looking at her across\nthe length of her arms, without attempting to bend them or to draw\nher closer. He wanted her to know how her words had moved him; but his\nthoughts were blurred by the rush of the same emotion that possessed\nher, and his own words came with an effort.\n\nHe ended by giving her back a laugh as frank as her own, and declaring,\nas he dropped her hands: \"All that and more too--you'll see!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nAll day, since the late reluctant dawn, the rain had come down in\ntorrents. It streamed against Darrow's high-perched windows, reduced\ntheir vast prospect of roofs and chimneys to a black oily huddle, and\nfilled the room with the drab twilight of an underground aquarium.\n\nThe streams descended with the regularity of a third day's rain, when\ntrimming and shuffling are over, and the weather has settled down to do\nits worst. There were no variations of rhythm, no lyrical ups and downs:\nthe grey lines streaking the panes were as dense and uniform as a page\nof unparagraphed narrative.\n\nGeorge Darrow had drawn his armchair to the fire. The time-table he\nhad been studying lay on the floor, and he sat staring with dull\nacquiescence into the boundless blur of rain, which affected him like a\nvast projection of his own state of mind. Then his eyes travelled slowly\nabout the room.\n\nIt was exactly ten days since his hurried unpacking had strewn it with\nthe contents of his portmanteaux. His brushes and razors were spread out\non the blotched marble of the chest of drawers. A stack of newspapers\nhad accumulated on the centre table under the \"electrolier\", and half a\ndozen paper novels lay on the mantelpiece among cigar-cases and toilet\nbottles; but these traces of his passage had made no mark on the\nfeatureless dulness of the room, its look of being the makeshift setting\nof innumerable transient collocations. There was something sardonic,\nalmost sinister, in its appearance of having deliberately \"made up\" for\nits anonymous part, all in noncommittal drabs and browns, with a\ncarpet and paper that nobody would remember, and chairs and tables as\nimpersonal as railway porters.\n\nDarrow picked up the time-table and tossed it on to the table. Then he\nrose to his feet, lit a cigar and went to the window. Through the rain\nhe could just discover the face of a clock in a tall building beyond the\nrailway roofs. He pulled out his watch, compared the two time-pieces,\nand started the hands of his with such a rush that they flew past the\nhour and he had to make them repeat the circuit more deliberately. He\nfelt a quite disproportionate irritation at the trifling blunder. When\nhe had corrected it he went back to his chair and threw himself down,\nleaning back his head against his hands. Presently his cigar went out,\nand he got up, hunted for the matches, lit it again and returned to his\nseat.\n\nThe room was getting on his nerves. During the first few days, while\nthe skies were clear, he had not noticed it, or had felt for it only the\ncontemptuous indifference of the traveller toward a provisional shelter.\nBut now that he was leaving it, was looking at it for the last time,\nit seemed to have taken complete possession of his mind, to be soaking\nitself into him like an ugly indelible blot. Every detail pressed itself\non his notice with the familiarity of an accidental confidant: whichever\nway he turned, he felt the nudge of a transient intimacy...\n\nThe one fixed point in his immediate future was that his leave was over\nand that he must be back at his post in London the next morning. Within\ntwenty-four hours he would again be in a daylight world of recognized\nactivities, himself a busy, responsible, relatively necessary factor in\nthe big whirring social and official machine. That fixed obligation\nwas the fact he could think of with the least discomfort, yet for some\nunaccountable reason it was the one on which he found it most difficult\nto fix his thoughts. Whenever he did so, the room jerked him back into\nthe circle of its insistent associations. It was extraordinary with what\na microscopic minuteness of loathing he hated it all: the grimy carpet\nand wallpaper, the black marble mantel-piece, the clock with a gilt\nallegory under a dusty bell, the high-bolstered brown-counterpaned bed,\nthe framed card of printed rules under the electric light switch, and\nthe door of communication with the next room. He hated the door most of\nall...\n\nAt the outset, he had felt no special sense of responsibility. He was\nsatisfied that he had struck the right note, and convinced of his power\nof sustaining it. The whole incident had somehow seemed, in spite of its\nvulgar setting and its inevitable prosaic propinquities, to be enacting\nitself in some unmapped region outside the pale of the usual. It was not\nlike anything that had ever happened to him before, or in which he had\never pictured himself as likely to be involved; but that, at first, had\nseemed no argument against his fitness to deal with it.\n\nPerhaps but for the three days' rain he might have got away without a\ndoubt as to his adequacy. The rain had made all the difference. It had\nthrown the whole picture out of perspective, blotted out the mystery\nof the remoter planes and the enchantment of the middle distance, and\nthrust into prominence every commonplace fact of the foreground. It was\nthe kind of situation that was not helped by being thought over; and\nby the perversity of circumstance he had been forced into the unwilling\ncontemplation of its every aspect...\n\nHis cigar had gone out again, and he threw it into the fire and vaguely\nmeditated getting up to find another. But the mere act of leaving his\nchair seemed to call for a greater exertion of the will than he was\ncapable of, and he leaned his head back with closed eyes and listened to\nthe drumming of the rain.\n\nA different noise aroused him. It was the opening and closing of\nthe door leading from the corridor into the adjoining room. He sat\nmotionless, without opening his eyes; but now another sight forced\nitself under his lowered lids. It was the precise photographic picture\nof that other room. Everything in it rose before him and pressed itself\nupon his vision with the same acuity of distinctness as the objects\nsurrounding him. A step sounded on the floor, and he knew which way the\nstep was directed, what pieces of furniture it had to skirt, where it\nwould probably pause, and what was likely to arrest it. He heard another\nsound, and recognized it as that of a wet umbrella placed in the black\nmarble jamb of the chimney-piece, against the hearth. He caught the\ncreak of a hinge, and instantly differentiated it as that of the\nwardrobe against the opposite wall. Then he heard the mouse-like squeal\nof a reluctant drawer, and knew it was the upper one in the chest of\ndrawers beside the bed: the clatter which followed was caused by the\nmahogany toilet-glass jumping on its loosened pivots...\n\nThe step crossed the floor again. It was strange how much better he knew\nit than the person to whom it belonged! Now it was drawing near the door\nof communication between the two rooms. He opened his eyes and looked.\nThe step had ceased and for a moment there was silence. Then he heard\na low knock. He made no response, and after an interval he saw that\nthe door handle was being tentatively turned. He closed his eyes once\nmore...\n\nThe door opened, and the step was in the room, coming cautiously toward\nhim. He kept his eyes shut, relaxing his body to feign sleep. There\nwas another pause, then a wavering soft advance, the rustle of a dress\nbehind his chair, the warmth of two hands pressed for a moment on his\nlids. The palms of the hands had the lingering scent of some stuff that\nhe had bought on the Boulevard...He looked up and saw a letter falling\nover his shoulder to his knee...\n\n\"Did I disturb you? I'm so sorry! They gave me this just now when I came\nin.\"\n\nThe letter, before he could catch it, had slipped between his knees to\nthe floor. It lay there, address upward, at his feet, and while he sat\nstaring down at the strong slender characters on the blue-gray envelope\nan arm reached out from behind to pick it up.\n\n\"Oh, don't--DON'T\" broke from him, and he bent over and caught the arm.\nThe face above it was close to his.\n\n\"Don't what?\"\n\n----\"take the trouble,\" he stammered.\n\nHe dropped the arm and stooped down. His grasp closed over the letter,\nhe fingered its thickness and weight and calculated the number of sheets\nit must contain.\n\nSuddenly he felt the pressure of the hand on his shoulder, and became\naware that the face was still leaning over him, and that in a moment he\nwould have to look up and kiss it...\n\nHe bent forward first and threw the unopened letter into the middle of\nthe fire.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe light of the October afternoon lay on an old high-roofed house which\nenclosed in its long expanse of brick and yellowish stone the breadth of\na grassy court filled with the shadow and sound of limes.\n\nFrom the escutcheoned piers at the entrance of the court a level drive,\nalso shaded by limes, extended to a white-barred gate beyond which\nan equally level avenue of grass, cut through a wood, dwindled to a\nblue-green blur against a sky banked with still white slopes of cloud.\n\nIn the court, half-way between house and drive, a lady stood. She held\na parasol above her head, and looked now at the house-front, with its\ndouble flight of steps meeting before a glazed door under sculptured\ntrophies, now down the drive toward the grassy cutting through the wood.\nHer air was less of expectancy than of contemplation: she seemed not so\nmuch to be watching for any one, or listening for an approaching sound,\nas letting the whole aspect of the place sink into her while she held\nherself open to its influence. Yet it was no less apparent that the\nscene was not new to her. There was no eagerness of investigation in her\nsurvey: she seemed rather to be looking about her with eyes to which,\nfor some intimate inward reason, details long since familiar had\nsuddenly acquired an unwonted freshness.\n\nThis was in fact the exact sensation of which Mrs. Leath was conscious\nas she came forth from the house and descended into the sunlit court.\nShe had come to meet her step-son, who was likely to be returning\nat that hour from an afternoon's shooting in one of the more distant\nplantations, and she carried in her hand the letter which had sent her\nin search of him; but with her first step out of the house all thought\nof him had been effaced by another series of impressions.\n\nThe scene about her was known to satiety. She had seen Givre at all\nseasons of the year, and for the greater part of every year, since the\nfar-off day of her marriage; the day when, ostensibly driving through\nits gates at her husband's side, she had actually been carried there on\na cloud of iris-winged visions.\n\nThe possibilities which the place had then represented were still\nvividly present to her. The mere phrase \"a French chateau\" had called\nup to her youthful fancy a throng of romantic associations, poetic,\npictorial and emotional; and the serene face of the old house seated in\nits park among the poplar-bordered meadows of middle France, had\nseemed, on her first sight of it, to hold out to her a fate as noble and\ndignified as its own mien.\n\nThough she could still call up that phase of feeling it had long since\npassed, and the house had for a time become to her the very symbol\nof narrowness and monotony. Then, with the passing of years, it had\ngradually acquired a less inimical character, had become, not again a\ncastle of dreams, evoker of fair images and romantic legend, but the\nshell of a life slowly adjusted to its dwelling: the place one came back\nto, the place where one had one's duties, one's habits and one's books,\nthe place one would naturally live in till one died: a dull house, an\ninconvenient house, of which one knew all the defects, the shabbinesses,\nthe discomforts, but to which one was so used that one could hardly,\nafter so long a time, think one's self away from it without suffering a\ncertain loss of identity.\n\nNow, as it lay before her in the autumn mildness, its mistress was\nsurprised at her own insensibility. She had been trying to see the\nhouse through the eyes of an old friend who, the next morning, would be\ndriving up to it for the first time; and in so doing she seemed to be\nopening her own eyes upon it after a long interval of blindness.\n\nThe court was very still, yet full of a latent life: the wheeling and\nrustling of pigeons about the rectangular yews and across the sunny\ngravel; the sweep of rooks above the lustrous greyish-purple slates of\nthe roof, and the stir of the tree-tops as they met the breeze which\nevery day, at that hour, came punctually up from the river.\n\nJust such a latent animation glowed in Anna Leath. In every nerve and\nvein she was conscious of that equipoise of bliss which the fearful\nhuman heart scarce dares acknowledge. She was not used to strong or\nfull emotions; but she had always known that she should not be afraid of\nthem. She was not afraid now; but she felt a deep inward stillness.\n\nThe immediate effect of the feeling had been to send her forth in quest\nof her step-son. She wanted to stroll back with him and have a quiet\ntalk before they re-entered the house. It was always easy to talk to\nhim, and at this moment he was the one person to whom she could have\nspoken without fear of disturbing her inner stillness. She was glad, for\nall sorts of reasons, that Madame de Chantelle and Effie were still\nat Ouchy with the governess, and that she and Owen had the house to\nthemselves. And she was glad that even he was not yet in sight. She\nwanted to be alone a little longer; not to think, but to let the long\nslow waves of joy break over her one by one.\n\nShe walked out of the court and sat down on one of the benches that\nbordered the drive. From her seat she had a diagonal view of the long\nhouse-front and of the domed chapel terminating one of the wings. Beyond\na gate in the court-yard wall the flower-garden drew its dark-green\nsquares and raised its statues against the yellowing background of the\npark. In the borders only a few late pinks and crimsons smouldered,\nbut a peacock strutting in the sun seemed to have gathered into his\nout-spread fan all the summer glories of the place.\n\nIn Mrs. Leath's hand was the letter which had opened her eyes to these\nthings, and a smile rose to her lips at the mere feeling of the paper\nbetween her fingers. The thrill it sent through her gave a keener edge\nto every sense. She felt, saw, breathed the shining world as though a\nthin impenetrable veil had suddenly been removed from it.\n\nJust such a veil, she now perceived, had always hung between herself and\nlife. It had been like the stage gauze which gives an illusive air of\nreality to the painted scene behind it, yet proves it, after all, to be\nno more than a painted scene.\n\nShe had been hardly aware, in her girlhood, of differing from others in\nthis respect. In the well-regulated well-fed Summers world the unusual\nwas regarded as either immoral or ill-bred, and people with emotions\nwere not visited. Sometimes, with a sense of groping in a topsy-turvy\nuniverse, Anna had wondered why everybody about her seemed to ignore all\nthe passions and sensations which formed the stuff of great poetry and\nmemorable action. In a community composed entirely of people like her\nparents and her parents' friends she did not see how the magnificent\nthings one read about could ever have happened. She was sure that if\nanything of the kind had occurred in her immediate circle her mother\nwould have consulted the family clergyman, and her father perhaps even\nhave rung up the police; and her sense of humour compelled her to own\nthat, in the given conditions, these precautions might not have been\nunjustified.\n\nLittle by little the conditions conquered her, and she learned to regard\nthe substance of life as a mere canvas for the embroideries of poet\nand painter, and its little swept and fenced and tended surface as its\nactual substance. It was in the visioned region of action and emotion\nthat her fullest hours were spent; but it hardly occurred to her that\nthey might be translated into experience, or connected with anything\nlikely to happen to a young lady living in West Fifty-fifth Street.\n\nShe perceived, indeed, that other girls, leading outwardly the same life\nas herself, and seemingly unaware of her world of hidden beauty, were\nyet possessed of some vital secret which escaped her. There seemed to be\na kind of freemasonry between them; they were wider awake than she, more\nalert, and surer of their wants if not of their opinions. She supposed\nthey were \"cleverer\", and accepted her inferiority good-humouredly, half\naware, within herself, of a reserve of unused power which the others\ngave no sign of possessing.\n\nThis partly consoled her for missing so much of what made their \"good\ntime\"; but the resulting sense of exclusion, of being somehow laughingly\nbut firmly debarred from a share of their privileges, threw her back on\nherself and deepened the reserve which made envious mothers cite her as\na model of ladylike repression. Love, she told herself, would one day\nrelease her from this spell of unreality. She was persuaded that the\nsublime passion was the key to the enigma; but it was difficult to\nrelate her conception of love to the forms it wore in her experience.\nTwo or three of the girls she had envied for their superior acquaintance\nwith the arts of life had contracted, in the course of time, what were\nvariously described as \"romantic\" or \"foolish\" marriages; one even made\na runaway match, and languished for a while under a cloud of social\nreprobation. Here, then, was passion in action, romance converted\nto reality; yet the heroines of these exploits returned from them\nuntransfigured, and their husbands were as dull as ever when one had to\nsit next to them at dinner.\n\nHer own case, of course, would be different. Some day she would find the\nmagic bridge between West Fifty-fifth Street and life; once or twice she\nhad even fancied that the clue was in her hand. The first time was\nwhen she had met young Darrow. She recalled even now the stir of the\nencounter. But his passion swept over her like a wind that shakes the\nroof of the forest without reaching its still glades or rippling its\nhidden pools. He was extraordinarily intelligent and agreeable, and her\nheart beat faster when he was with her. He had a tall fair easy presence\nand a mind in which the lights of irony played pleasantly through the\nshades of feeling. She liked to hear his voice almost as much as to\nlisten to what he was saying, and to listen to what he was saying almost\nas much as to feel that he was looking at her; but he wanted to kiss\nher, and she wanted to talk to him about books and pictures, and have\nhim insinuate the eternal theme of their love into every subject they\ndiscussed.\n\nWhenever they were apart a reaction set in. She wondered how she could\nhave been so cold, called herself a prude and an idiot, questioned if\nany man could really care for her, and got up in the dead of night to\ntry new ways of doing her hair. But as soon as he reappeared her head\nstraightened itself on her slim neck and she sped her little shafts of\nirony, or flew her little kites of erudition, while hot and cold waves\nswept over her, and the things she really wanted to say choked in her\nthroat and burned the palms of her hands.\n\nOften she told herself that any silly girl who had waltzed through a\nseason would know better than she how to attract a man and hold him; but\nwhen she said \"a man\" she did not really mean George Darrow.\n\nThen one day, at a dinner, she saw him sitting next to one of the silly\ngirls in question: the heroine of the elopement which had shaken West\nFifty-fifth Street to its base. The young lady had come back from her\nadventure no less silly than when she went; and across the table the\npartner of her flight, a fat young man with eye-glasses, sat stolidly\neating terrapin and talking about polo and investments.\n\nThe young woman was undoubtedly as silly as ever; yet after watching\nher for a few minutes Miss Summers perceived that she had somehow grown\nluminous, perilous, obscurely menacing to nice girls and the young men\nthey intended eventually to accept. Suddenly, at the sight, a rage of\npossessorship awoke in her. She must save Darrow, assert her right\nto him at any price. Pride and reticence went down in a hurricane\nof jealousy. She heard him laugh, and there was something new in his\nlaugh...She watched him talking, talking...He sat slightly sideways, a\nfaint smile beneath his lids, lowering his voice as he lowered it when\nhe talked to her. She caught the same inflections, but his eyes were\ndifferent. It would have offended her once if he had looked at her like\nthat. Now her one thought was that none but she had a right to be so\nlooked at. And that girl of all others! What illusions could he have\nabout a girl who, hardly a year ago, had made a fool of herself over\nthe fat young man stolidly eating terrapin across the table? If that\nwas where romance and passion ended, it was better to take to district\nvisiting or algebra!\n\nAll night she lay awake and wondered: \"What was she saying to him? How\nshall I learn to say such things?\" and she decided that her heart would\ntell her--that the next time they were alone together the irresistible\nword would spring to her lips. He came the next day, and they were\nalone, and all she found was: \"I didn't know that you and Kitty Mayne\nwere such friends.\"\n\nHe answered with indifference that he didn't know it either, and in the\nreaction of relief she declared: \"She's certainly ever so much prettier\nthan she was...\"\n\n\"She's rather good fun,\" he admitted, as though he had not noticed her\nother advantages; and suddenly Anna saw in his eyes the look she had\nseen there the previous evening.\n\nShe felt as if he were leagues and leagues away from her. All her hopes\ndissolved, and she was conscious of sitting rigidly, with high head and\nstraight lips, while the irresistible word fled with a last wing-beat\ninto the golden mist of her illusions...\n\n\nShe was still quivering with the pain and bewilderment of this adventure\nwhen Fraser Leath appeared. She met him first in Italy, where she was\ntravelling with her parents; and the following winter he came to\nNew York. In Italy he had seemed interesting: in New York he became\nremarkable. He seldom spoke of his life in Europe, and let drop but the\nmost incidental allusions to the friends, the tastes, the pursuits which\nfilled his cosmopolitan days; but in the atmosphere of West Fifty-fifth\nStreet he seemed the embodiment of a storied past. He presented Miss\nSummers with a prettily-bound anthology of the old French poets and,\nwhen she showed a discriminating pleasure in the gift, observed with his\ngrave smile: \"I didn't suppose I should find any one here who would feel\nabout these things as I do.\" On another occasion he asked her acceptance\nof a half-effaced eighteenth century pastel which he had surprisingly\npicked up in a New York auction-room. \"I know no one but you who would\nreally appreciate it,\" he explained.\n\nHe permitted himself no other comments, but these conveyed with\nsufficient directness that he thought her worthy of a different setting.\nThat she should be so regarded by a man living in an atmosphere of art\nand beauty, and esteeming them the vital elements of life, made her\nfeel for the first time that she was understood. Here was some one whose\nscale of values was the same as hers, and who thought her opinion\nworth hearing on the very matters which they both considered of supreme\nimportance. The discovery restored her self-confidence, and she revealed\nherself to Mr. Leath as she had never known how to reveal herself to\nDarrow.\n\nAs the courtship progressed, and they grew more confidential, her\nsuitor surprised and delighted her by little explosions of revolutionary\nsentiment. He said: \"Shall you mind, I wonder, if I tell you that you\nlive in a dread-fully conventional atmosphere?\" and, seeing that she\nmanifestly did not mind: \"Of course I shall say things now and then that\nwill horrify your dear delightful parents--I shall shock them awfully, I\nwarn you.\"\n\nIn confirmation of this warning he permitted himself an occasional\nplayful fling at the regular church-going of Mr. and Mrs. Summers, at\nthe innocuous character of the literature in their library, and at their\nguileless appreciations in art. He even ventured to banter Mrs. Summers\non her refusal to receive the irrepressible Kitty Mayne who, after a\nrapid passage with George Darrow, was now involved in another and more\nflagrant adventure.\n\n\"In Europe, you know, the husband is regarded as the only judge in such\nmatters. As long as he accepts the situation--\" Mr. Leath explained\nto Anna, who took his view the more emphatically in order to convince\nherself that, personally, she had none but the most tolerant sentiments\ntoward the lady.\n\nThe subversiveness of Mr. Leath's opinions was enhanced by the\ndistinction of his appearance and the reserve of his manners. He was\nlike the anarchist with a gardenia in his buttonhole who figures in\nthe higher melodrama. Every word, every allusion, every note of his\nagreeably-modulated voice, gave Anna a glimpse of a society at once\nfreer and finer, which observed the traditional forms but had discarded\nthe underlying prejudices; whereas the world she knew had discarded many\nof the forms and kept almost all the prejudices.\n\nIn such an atmosphere as his an eager young woman, curious as to all the\nmanifestations of life, yet instinctively desiring that they should come\nto her in terms of beauty and fine feeling, must surely find the largest\nscope for self-expression. Study, travel, the contact of the world, the\ncomradeship of a polished and enlightened mind, would combine to enrich\nher days and form her character; and it was only in the rare moments\nwhen Mr. Leath's symmetrical blond mask bent over hers, and his kiss\ndropped on her like a cold smooth pebble, that she questioned the\ncompleteness of the joys he offered.\n\nThere had been a time when the walls on which her gaze now rested had\nshed a glare of irony on these early dreams. In the first years of her\nmarriage the sober symmetry of Givre had suggested only her husband's\nneatly-balanced mind. It was a mind, she soon learned, contentedly\nabsorbed in formulating the conventions of the unconventional. West\nFifty-fifth Street was no more conscientiously concerned than Givre with\nthe momentous question of \"what people did\"; it was only the type of\ndeed investigated that was different. Mr. Leath collected his social\ninstances with the same seriousness and patience as his snuff-boxes.\nHe exacted a rigid conformity to his rules of non-conformity and his\nscepticism had the absolute accent of a dogma. He even cherished certain\nexceptions to his rules as the book-collector prizes a \"defective\" first\nedition. The Protestant church-going of Anna's parents had provoked\nhis gentle sarcasm; but he prided himself on his mother's devoutness,\nbecause Madame de Chantelle, in embracing her second husband's creed,\nhad become part of a society which still observes the outward rites of\npiety.\n\nAnna, in fact, had discovered in her amiable and elegant mother-in-law\nan unexpected embodiment of the West Fifty-fifth Street ideal. Mrs.\nSummers and Madame de Chantelle, however strongly they would have\ndisagreed as to the authorized source of Christian dogma, would have\nfound themselves completely in accord on all the momentous minutiae of\ndrawing-room conduct; yet Mr. Leath treated his mother's foibles with a\nrespect which Anna's experience of him forbade her to attribute wholly\nto filial affection.\n\nIn the early days, when she was still questioning the Sphinx instead of\ntrying to find an answer to it, she ventured to tax her husband with his\ninconsistency.\n\n\"You say your mother won't like it if I call on that amusing little\nwoman who came here the other day, and was let in by mistake; but\nMadame de Chantelle tells me she lives with her husband, and when mother\nrefused to visit Kitty Mayne you said----\"\n\nMr. Leath's smile arrested her. \"My dear child, I don't pretend to apply\nthe principles of logic to my poor mother's prejudices.\"\n\n\"But if you admit that they ARE prejudices----?\"\n\n\"There are prejudices and prejudices. My mother, of course, got hers\nfrom Monsieur de Chantelle, and they seem to me as much in their place\nin this house as the pot-pourri in your hawthorn jar. They preserve a\nsocial tradition of which I should be sorry to lose the least perfume.\nOf course I don't expect you, just at first, to feel the difference, to\nsee the nuance. In the case of little Madame de Vireville, for instance:\nyou point out that she's still under her husband's roof. Very true; and\nif she were merely a Paris acquaintance--especially if you had met her,\nas one still might, in the RIGHT KIND of house in Paris--I should be the\nlast to object to your visiting her. But in the country it's different.\nEven the best provincial society is what you would call narrow: I\ndon't deny it; and if some of our friends met Madame de Vireville at\nGivre--well, it would produce a bad impression. You're inclined to\nridicule such considerations, but gradually you'll come to see their\nimportance; and meanwhile, do trust me when I ask you to be guided by\nmy mother. It is always well for a stranger in an old society to err a\nlittle on the side of what you call its prejudices but I should rather\ndescribe as its traditions.\"\n\nAfter that she no longer tried to laugh or argue her husband out of his\nconvictions. They WERE convictions, and therefore unassailable. Nor\nwas any insincerity implied in the fact that they sometimes seemed to\ncoincide with hers. There were occasions when he really did look at\nthings as she did; but for reasons so different as to make the distance\nbetween them all the greater. Life, to Mr. Leath, was like a walk\nthrough a carefully classified museum, where, in moments of doubt, one\nhad only to look at the number and refer to one's catalogue; to his wife\nit was like groping about in a huge dark lumber-room where the exploring\nray of curiosity lit up now some shape of breathing beauty and now a\nmummy's grin.\n\nIn the first bewilderment of her new state these discoveries had had the\neffect of dropping another layer of gauze between herself and reality.\nShe seemed farther than ever removed from the strong joys and pangs for\nwhich she felt herself made. She did not adopt her husband's views, but\ninsensibly she began to live his life. She tried to throw a compensating\nardour into the secret excursions of her spirit, and thus the old\nvicious distinction between romance and reality was re-established for\nher, and she resigned herself again to the belief that \"real life\" was\nneither real nor alive.\n\nThe birth of her little girl swept away this delusion. At last she felt\nherself in contact with the actual business of living: but even this\nimpression was not enduring.\n\nEverything but the irreducible crude fact of child-bearing assumed, in\nthe Leath household, the same ghostly tinge of unreality. Her husband,\nat the time, was all that his own ideal of a husband required. He was\nattentive, and even suitably moved: but as he sat by her bedside, and\nthoughtfully proffered to her the list of people who had \"called to\nenquire\", she looked first at him, and then at the child between them,\nand wondered at the blundering alchemy of Nature...\n\nWith the exception of the little girl herself, everything connected with\nthat time had grown curiously remote and unimportant. The days that had\nmoved so slowly as they passed seemed now to have plunged down head-long\nsteeps of time; and as she sat in the autumn sun, with Darrow's letter\nin her hand, the history of Anna Leath appeared to its heroine like some\ngrey shadowy tale that she might have read in an old book, one night as\nshe was falling asleep...\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nTwo brown blurs emerging from the farther end of the wood-vista\ngradually defined themselves as her step-son and an attendant\ngame-keeper. They grew slowly upon the bluish background, with\noccasional delays and re-effacements, and she sat still, waiting till\nthey should reach the gate at the end of the drive, where the keeper\nwould turn off to his cottage and Owen continue on to the house.\n\nShe watched his approach with a smile. From the first days of her\nmarriage she had been drawn to the boy, but it was not until after\nEffie's birth that she had really begun to know him. The eager\nobservation of her own child had shown her how much she had still to\nlearn about the slight fair boy whom the holidays periodically restored\nto Givre. Owen, even then, both physically and morally, furnished her\nwith the oddest of commentaries on his father's mien and mind. He would\nnever, the family sighingly recognized, be nearly as handsome as Mr.\nLeath; but his rather charmingly unbalanced face, with its brooding\nforehead and petulant boyish smile, suggested to Anna what his father's\ncountenance might have been could one have pictured its neat features\ndisordered by a rattling breeze. She even pushed the analogy farther,\nand descried in her step-son's mind a quaintly-twisted reflection of\nher husband's. With his bursts of door-slamming activity, his fits of\nbookish indolence, his crude revolutionary dogmatizing and his flashes\nof precocious irony, the boy was not unlike a boisterous embodiment of\nhis father's theories. It was as though Fraser Leath's ideas, accustomed\nto hang like marionettes on their pegs, should suddenly come down\nand walk. There were moments, indeed, when Owen's humours must have\nsuggested to his progenitor the gambols of an infant Frankenstein; but\nto Anna they were the voice of her secret rebellions, and her tenderness\nto her step-son was partly based on her severity toward herself. As he\nhad the courage she had lacked, so she meant him to have the chances\nshe had missed; and every effort she made for him helped to keep her own\nhopes alive.\n\nHer interest in Owen led her to think more often of his mother, and\nsometimes she would slip away and stand alone before her predecessor's\nportrait. Since her arrival at Givre the picture--a \"full-length\" by a\nonce fashionable artist--had undergone the successive displacements of\nan exiled consort removed farther and farther from the throne; and\nAnna could not help noting that these stages coincided with the gradual\ndecline of the artist's fame. She had a fancy that if his credit had\nbeen in the ascendant the first Mrs. Leath might have continued to\nthrone over the drawing-room mantel-piece, even to the exclusion of\nher successor's effigy. Instead of this, her peregrinations had finally\nlanded her in the shrouded solitude of the billiard-room, an apartment\nwhich no one ever entered, but where it was understood that \"the light\nwas better,\" or might have been if the shutters had not been always\nclosed.\n\nHere the poor lady, elegantly dressed, and seated in the middle of a\nlarge lonely canvas, in the blank contemplation of a gilt console, had\nalways seemed to Anna to be waiting for visitors who never came.\n\n\"Of course they never came, you poor thing! I wonder how long it\ntook you to find out that they never would?\" Anna had more than once\napostrophized her, with a derision addressed rather to herself than to\nthe dead; but it was only after Effie's birth that it occurred to her to\nstudy more closely the face in the picture, and speculate on the kind of\nvisitors that Owen's mother might have hoped for.\n\n\"She certainly doesn't look as if they would have been the same kind as\nmine: but there's no telling, from a portrait that was so obviously done\n'to please the family', and that leaves Owen so unaccounted for. Well,\nthey never came, the visitors; they never came; and she died of it. She\ndied of it long before they buried her: I'm certain of that. Those are\nstone-dead eyes in the picture...The loneliness must have been awful, if\neven Owen couldn't keep her from dying of it. And to feel it so she must\nhave HAD feelings--real live ones, the kind that twitch and tug. And all\nshe had to look at all her life was a gilt console--yes, that's it, a\ngilt console screwed to the wall! That's exactly and absolutely what he\nis!\"\n\nShe did not mean, if she could help it, that either Effie or Owen should\nknow that loneliness, or let her know it again. They were three, now, to\nkeep each other warm, and she embraced both children in the same passion\nof motherhood, as though one were not enough to shield her from her\npredecessor's fate.\n\nSometimes she fancied that Owen Leath's response was warmer than that\nof her own child. But then Effie was still hardly more than a baby,\nand Owen, from the first, had been almost \"old enough to understand\":\ncertainly DID understand now, in a tacit way that yet perpetually spoke\nto her. This sense of his understanding was the deepest element in their\nfeeling for each other. There were so many things between them that were\nnever spoken of, or even indirectly alluded to, yet that, even in their\noccasional discussions and differences, formed the unadduced arguments\nmaking for final agreement...\n\nMusing on this, she continued to watch his approach; and her heart began\nto beat a little faster at the thought of what she had to say to him.\nBut when he reached the gate she saw him pause, and after a moment he\nturned aside as if to gain a cross-road through the park.\n\nShe started up and waved her sunshade, but he did not see her. No doubt\nhe meant to go back with the gamekeeper, perhaps to the kennels, to see\na retriever who had hurt his leg. Suddenly she was seized by the whim\nto overtake him. She threw down the parasol, thrust her letter into her\nbodice, and catching up her skirts began to run.\n\nShe was slight and light, with a natural ease and quickness of gait, but\nshe could not recall having run a yard since she had romped with Owen in\nhis school-days; nor did she know what impulse moved her now. She only\nknew that run she must, that no other motion, short of flight, would\nhave been buoyant enough for her humour. She seemed to be keeping pace\nwith some inward rhythm, seeking to give bodily expression to the lyric\nrush of her thoughts. The earth always felt elastic under her, and she\nhad a conscious joy in treading it; but never had it been as soft and\nspringy as today. It seemed actually to rise and meet her as she went,\nso that she had the feeling, which sometimes came to her in dreams, of\nskimming miraculously over short bright waves. The air, too, seemed to\nbreak in waves against her, sweeping by on its current all the slanted\nlights and moist sharp perfumes of the failing day. She panted to\nherself: \"This is nonsense!\" her blood hummed back: \"But it's glorious!\"\nand she sped on till she saw that Owen had caught sight of her and was\nstriding back in her direction.\n\nThen she stopped and waited, flushed and laughing, her hands clasped\nagainst the letter in her breast.\n\n\"No, I'm not mad,\" she called out; \"but there's something in the air\ntoday--don't you feel it?--And I wanted to have a little talk with you,\"\nshe added as he came up to her, smiling at him and linking her arm in\nhis.\n\nHe smiled back, but above the smile she saw the shade of anxiety which,\nfor the last two months, had kept its fixed line between his handsome\neyes.\n\n\"Owen, don't look like that! I don't want you to!\" she said imperiously.\n\nHe laughed. \"You said that exactly like Effie. What do you want me to\ndo? To race with you as I do Effie? But I shouldn't have a show!\" he\nprotested, still with the little frown between his eyes.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"To the kennels. But there's not the least need. The vet has seen Garry\nand he's all right. If there's anything you wanted to tell me----\"\n\n\"Did I say there was? I just came out to meet you--I wanted to know if\nyou'd had good sport.\"\n\nThe shadow dropped on him again. \"None at all. The fact is I didn't try.\nJean and I have just been knocking about in the woods. I wasn't in a\nsanguinary mood.\"\n\nThey walked on with the same light gait, so nearly of a height that\nkeeping step came as naturally to them as breathing. Anna stole another\nlook at the young face on a level with her own.\n\n\"You DID say there was something you wanted to tell me,\" her step-son\nbegan after a pause.\n\n\"Well, there is.\" She slackened her pace involuntarily, and they came to\na pause and stood facing each other under the limes.\n\n\"Is Darrow coming?\" he asked.\n\nShe seldom blushed, but at the question a sudden heat suffused her. She\nheld her head high.\n\n\"Yes: he's coming. I've just heard. He arrives to-morrow. But that's\nnot----\" She saw her blunder and tried to rectify it. \"Or rather, yes,\nin a way it is my reason for wanting to speak to you----\"\n\n\"Because he's coming?\"\n\n\"Because he's not yet here.\"\n\n\"It's about him, then?\"\n\nHe looked at her kindly, half-humourously, an almost fraternal wisdom in\nhis smile.\n\n\"About----? No, no: I meant that I wanted to speak today because it's\nour last day alone together.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" He had slipped his hands into the pockets of his tweed\nshooting jacket and lounged along at her side, his eyes bent on the\nmoist ruts of the drive, as though the matter had lost all interest for\nhim.\n\n\"Owen----\"\n\nHe stopped again and faced her. \"Look here, my dear, it's no sort of\nuse.\"\n\n\"What's no use?\"\n\n\"Anything on earth you can any of you say.\"\n\nShe challenged him: \"Am I one of 'any of you'?\"\n\nHe did not yield. \"Well, then--anything on earth that even YOU can say.\"\n\"You don't in the least know what I can say--or what I mean to.\"\n\n\"Don't I, generally?\"\n\nShe gave him this point, but only to make another. \"Yes; but this is\nparticularly. I want to say...Owen, you've been admirable all through.\"\n\nHe broke into a laugh in which the odd elder-brotherly note was once\nmore perceptible.\n\n\"Admirable,\" she emphasized. \"And so has SHE.\"\n\n\"Oh, and so have you to HER!\" His voice broke down to boyishness. \"I've\nnever lost sight of that for a minute. It's been altogether easier for\nher, though,\" he threw off presently.\n\n\"On the whole, I suppose it has. Well----\" she summed up with a laugh,\n\"aren't you all the better pleased to be told you've behaved as well as\nshe?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know, I've not done it for you,\" he tossed back at her, without\nthe least note of hostility in the affected lightness of his tone.\n\n\"Haven't you, though, perhaps--the least bit? Because, after all, you\nknew I understood?\"\n\n\"You've been awfully kind about pretending to.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"You don't believe me? You must remember I had your\ngrandmother to consider.\"\n\n\"Yes: and my father--and Effie, I suppose--and the outraged shades of\nGivre!\" He paused, as if to lay more stress on the boyish sneer: \"Do you\nlikewise include the late Monsieur de Chantelle?\"\n\nHis step-mother did not appear to resent the thrust. She went on, in the\nsame tone of affectionate persuasion: \"Yes: I must have seemed to you\ntoo subject to Givre. Perhaps I have been. But you know that was not my\nreal object in asking you to wait, to say nothing to your grandmother\nbefore her return.\"\n\nHe considered. \"Your real object, of course, was to gain time.\"\n\n\"Yes--but for whom? Why not for YOU?\"\n\n\"For me?\" He flushed up quickly. \"You don't mean----?\"\n\nShe laid her hand on his arm and looked gravely into his handsome eyes.\n\n\"I mean that when your grandmother gets back from Ouchy I shall speak to\nher----\" \"You'll speak to her...?\"\n\n\"Yes; if only you'll promise to give me time----\"\n\n\"Time for her to send for Adelaide Painter?\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll undoubtedly send for Adelaide Painter!\"\n\nThe allusion touched a spring of mirth in both their minds, and they\nexchanged a laughing look.\n\n\"Only you must promise not to rush things. You must give me time to\nprepare Adelaide too,\" Mrs. Leath went on.\n\n\"Prepare her too?\" He drew away for a better look at her. \"Prepare her\nfor what?\"\n\n\"Why, to prepare your grandmother! For your marriage. Yes, that's what I\nmean. I'm going to see you through, you know----\"\n\nHis feint of indifference broke down and he caught her hand. \"Oh, you\ndear divine thing! I didn't dream----\"\n\n\"I know you didn't.\" She dropped her gaze and began to walk on slowly.\n\"I can't say you've convinced me of the wisdom of the step. Only I\nseem to see that other things matter more--and that not missing things\nmatters most. Perhaps I've changed--or YOUR not changing has convinced\nme. I'm certain now that you won't budge. And that was really all I ever\ncared about.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to not budging--I told you so months ago: you might have been\nsure of that! And how can you be any surer today than yesterday?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I suppose one learns something every day----\"\n\n\"Not at Givre!\" he laughed, and shot a half-ironic look at her. \"But you\nhaven't really BEEN at Givre lately--not for months! Don't you suppose\nI've noticed that, my dear?\"\n\nShe echoed his laugh to merge it in an undenying sigh. \"Poor Givre...\"\n\n\"Poor empty Givre! With so many rooms full and yet not a soul in\nit--except of course my grandmother, who is its soul!\"\n\nThey had reached the gateway of the court and stood looking with a\ncommon accord at the long soft-hued facade on which the autumn light was\ndying. \"It looks so made to be happy in----\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yes--today, today!\" He pressed her arm a little. \"Oh, you darling--to\nhave given it that look for me!\" He paused, and then went on in a lower\nvoice: \"Don't you feel we owe it to the poor old place to do what we can\nto give it that look? You, too, I mean? Come, let's make it grin\nfrom wing to wing! I've such a mad desire to say outrageous things to\nit--haven't you? After all, in old times there must have been living\npeople here!\"\n\nLoosening her arm from his she continued to gaze up at the house-front,\nwhich seemed, in the plaintive decline of light, to send her back the\nmute appeal of something doomed.\n\n\"It IS beautiful,\" she said.\n\n\"A beautiful memory! Quite perfect to take out and turn over when I'm\ngrinding at the law in New York, and you're----\" He broke off and looked\nat her with a questioning smile. \"Come! Tell me. You and I don't have\nto say things to talk to each other. When you turn suddenly absentminded\nand mysterious I always feel like saying: 'Come back. All is\ndiscovered'.\"\n\nShe returned his smile. \"You know as much as I know. I promise you\nthat.\"\n\nHe wavered, as if for the first time uncertain how far he might go. \"I\ndon't know Darrow as much as you know him,\" he presently risked.\n\nShe frowned a little. \"You said just now we didn't need to say things\"\n\n\"Was I speaking? I thought it was your eyes----\" He caught her by both\nelbows and spun her halfway round, so that the late sun shed a betraying\ngleam on her face. \"They're such awfully conversational eyes! Don't you\nsuppose they told me long ago why it's just today you've made up your\nmind that people have got to live their own lives--even at Givre?\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\n\"This is the south terrace,\" Anna said. \"Should you like to walk down to\nthe river?\"\n\nShe seemed to listen to herself speaking from a far-off airy height, and\nyet to be wholly gathered into the circle of consciousness which drew\nits glowing ring about herself and Darrow. To the aerial listener her\nwords sounded flat and colourless, but to the self within the ring each\none beat with a separate heart.\n\nIt was the day after Darrow's arrival, and he had come down early, drawn\nby the sweetness of the light on the lawns and gardens below his window.\nAnna had heard the echo of his step on the stairs, his pause in the\nstone-flagged hall, his voice as he asked a servant where to find her.\nShe was at the end of the house, in the brown-panelled sitting-room\nwhich she frequented at that season because it caught the sunlight first\nand kept it longest. She stood near the window, in the pale band of\nbrightness, arranging some salmon-pink geraniums in a shallow porcelain\nbowl. Every sensation of touch and sight was thrice-alive in her. The\ngrey-green fur of the geranium leaves caressed her fingers and the\nsunlight wavering across the irregular surface of the old parquet floor\nmade it seem as bright and shifting as the brown bed of a stream.\n\nDarrow stood framed in the door-way of the farthest drawing-room, a\nlight-grey figure against the black and white flagging of the hall; then\nhe began to move toward her down the empty pale-panelled vista, crossing\none after another the long reflections which a projecting cabinet or\nscreen cast here and there upon the shining floors.\n\nAs he drew nearer, his figure was suddenly displaced by that of her\nhusband, whom, from the same point, she had so often seen advancing down\nthe same perspective. Straight, spare, erect, looking to right and\nleft with quick precise turns of the head, and stopping now and then to\nstraighten a chair or alter the position of a vase, Fraser Leath used\nto march toward her through the double file of furniture like a general\nreviewing a regiment drawn up for his inspection. At a certain point,\nmidway across the second room, he always stopped before the mantel-piece\nof pinkish-yellow marble and looked at himself in the tall garlanded\nglass that surmounted it. She could not remember that he had ever found\nanything to straighten or alter in his own studied attire, but she had\nnever known him to omit the inspection when he passed that particular\nmirror.\n\nWhen it was over he continued more briskly on his way, and the resulting\nexpression of satisfaction was still on his face when he entered the oak\nsitting-room to greet his wife...\n\nThe spectral projection of this little daily scene hung but for a moment\nbefore Anna, but in that moment she had time to fling a wondering glance\nacross the distance between her past and present. Then the footsteps of\nthe present came close, and she had to drop the geraniums to give her\nhand to Darrow...\n\n\"Yes, let us walk down to the river.\"\n\nThey had neither of them, as yet, found much to say to each other.\nDarrow had arrived late on the previous afternoon, and during the\nevening they had had between them Owen Leath and their own thoughts. Now\nthey were alone for the first time and the fact was enough in itself.\nYet Anna was intensely aware that as soon as they began to talk more\nintimately they would feel that they knew each other less well.\n\nThey passed out onto the terrace and down the steps to the gravel walk\nbelow. The delicate frosting of dew gave the grass a bluish shimmer, and\nthe sunlight, sliding in emerald streaks along the tree-boles, gathered\nitself into great luminous blurs at the end of the wood-walks, and hung\nabove the fields a watery glory like the ring about an autumn moon.\n\n\"It's good to be here,\" Darrow said.\n\nThey took a turn to the left and stopped for a moment to look back at\nthe long pink house-front, plainer, friendlier, less adorned than on the\nside toward the court. So prolonged yet delicate had been the friction\nof time upon its bricks that certain expanses had the bloom and texture\nof old red velvet, and the patches of gold lichen spreading over them\nlooked like the last traces of a dim embroidery. The dome of the chapel,\nwith its gilded cross, rose above one wing, and the other ended in a\nconical pigeon-house, above which the birds were flying, lustrous and\nslatey, their breasts merged in the blue of the roof when they dropped\ndown on it.\n\n\"And this is where you've been all these years.\"\n\nThey turned away and began to walk down a long tunnel of yellowing\ntrees. Benches with mossy feet stood against the mossy edges of the\npath, and at its farther end it widened into a circle about a basin\nrimmed with stone, in which the opaque water strewn with leaves looked\nlike a slab of gold-flecked agate. The path, growing narrower, wound on\ncircuitously through the woods, between slender serried trunks twined\nwith ivy. Patches of blue appeared above them through the dwindling\nleaves, and presently the trees drew back and showed the open fields\nalong the river.\n\nThey walked on across the fields to the tow-path. In a curve of the wall\nsome steps led up to a crumbling pavilion with openings choked with ivy.\nAnna and Darrow seated themselves on the bench projecting from the inner\nwall of the pavilion and looked across the river at the slopes divided\ninto blocks of green and fawn-colour, and at the chalk-tinted village\nlifting its squat church-tower and grey roofs against the precisely\ndrawn lines of the landscape. Anna sat silent, so intensely aware of\nDarrow's nearness that there was no surprise in the touch he laid on her\nhand. They looked at each other, and he smiled and said: \"There are to\nbe no more obstacles now.\"\n\n\"Obstacles?\" The word startled her. \"What obstacles?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember the wording of the telegram that turned me back\nlast May? 'Unforeseen obstacle': that was it. What was the earth-shaking\nproblem, by the way? Finding a governess for Effie, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"But I gave you my reason: the reason why it was an obstacle. I wrote\nyou fully about it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you did.\" He lifted her hand and kissed it. \"How far off it\nall seems, and how little it all matters today!\"\n\nShe looked at him quickly. \"Do you feel that? I suppose I'm different. I\nwant to draw all those wasted months into today--to make them a part of\nit.\"\n\n\"But they are, to me. You reach back and take everything--back to the\nfirst days of all.\"\n\nShe frowned a little, as if struggling with an inarticulate perplexity.\n\"It's curious how, in those first days, too, something that I didn't\nunderstand came between us.\"\n\n\"Oh, in those days we neither of us understood, did we? It's part of\nwhat's called the bliss of being young.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought that, too: thought it, I mean, in looking back. But it\ncouldn't, even then, have been as true of you as of me; and now----\"\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"the only thing that matters is that we're sitting here\ntogether.\"\n\nHe dismissed the rest with a lightness that might have seemed conclusive\nevidence of her power over him. But she took no pride in such triumphs.\nIt seemed to her that she wanted his allegiance and his adoration not so\nmuch for herself as for their mutual love, and that in treating lightly\nany past phase of their relation he took something from its present\nbeauty. The colour rose to her face.\n\n\"Between you and me everything matters.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" She felt the unperceiving sweetness of his smile. \"That's\nwhy,\" he went on, \"'everything,' for me, is here and now: on this bench,\nbetween you and me.\"\n\nShe caught at the phrase. \"That's what I meant: it's here and now; we\ncan't get away from it.\"\n\n\"Get away from it? Do you want to? AGAIN?\"\n\nHer heart was beating unsteadily. Something in her, fitfully and with\nreluctance, struggled to free itself, but the warmth of his nearness\npenetrated every sense as the sunlight steeped the landscape. Then,\nsuddenly, she felt that she wanted no less than the whole of her\nhappiness.\n\n\"'Again'? But wasn't it YOU, the last time----?\"\n\nShe paused, the tremor in her of Psyche holding up the lamp. But in the\ninterrogative light of her pause her companion's features underwent no\nchange.\n\n\"The last time? Last spring? But it was you who--for the best of\nreasons, as you've told me--turned me back from your very door last\nspring!\"\n\nShe saw that he was good-humouredly ready to \"thresh out,\" for her\nsentimental satisfaction, a question which, for his own, Time had so\nconclusively dealt with; and the sense of his readiness reassured her.\n\n\"I wrote as soon as I could,\" she rejoined. \"I explained the delay and\nasked you to come. And you never even answered my letter.\"\n\n\"It was impossible to come then. I had to go back to my post.\"\n\n\"And impossible to write and tell me so?\"\n\n\"Your letter was a long time coming. I had waited a week--ten days. I\nhad some excuse for thinking, when it came, that you were in no great\nhurry for an answer.\"\n\n\"You thought that--really--after reading it?\"\n\n\"I thought it.\"\n\nHer heart leaped up to her throat. \"Then why are you here today?\"\n\nHe turned on her with a quick look of wonder. \"God knows--if you can ask\nme that!\"\n\n\"You see I was right to say I didn't understand.\"\n\nHe stood up abruptly and stood facing her, blocking the view over the\nriver and the checkered slopes. \"Perhaps I might say so too.\"\n\n\"No, no: we must neither of us have any reason for saying it again.\"\nShe looked at him gravely. \"Surely you and I needn't arrange the lights\nbefore we show ourselves to each other. I want you to see me just as I\nam, with all my irrational doubts and scruples; the old ones and the new\nones too.\"\n\nHe came back to his seat beside her. \"Never mind the old ones. They were\njustified--I'm willing to admit it. With the governess having suddenly\nto be packed off, and Effie on your hands, and your mother-in-law ill,\nI see the impossibility of your letting me come. I even see that, at the\nmoment, it was difficult to write and explain. But what does all that\nmatter now? The new scruples are the ones I want to tackle.\"\n\nAgain her heart trembled. She felt her happiness so near, so sure, that\nto strain it closer might be like a child's crushing a pet bird in its\ncaress. But her very security urged her on. For so long her doubts had\nbeen knife-edged: now they had turned into bright harmless toys that she\ncould toss and catch without peril!\n\n\"You didn't come, and you didn't answer my letter; and after waiting\nfour months I wrote another.\" \"And I answered that one; and I'm here.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She held his eyes. \"But in my last letter I repeated exactly what\nI'd said in the first--the one I wrote you last June. I told you then\nthat I was ready to give you the answer to what you'd asked me in\nLondon; and in telling you that, I told you what the answer was.\"\n\n\"My dearest! My dearest!\" Darrow murmured.\n\n\"You ignored that letter. All summer you made no sign. And all I ask now\nis, that you should frankly tell me why.\"\n\n\"I can only repeat what I've just said. I was hurt and unhappy and\nI doubted you. I suppose if I'd cared less I should have been more\nconfident. I cared so much that I couldn't risk another failure. For\nyou'd made me feel that I'd miserably failed. So I shut my eyes and set\nmy teeth and turned my back. There's the whole pusillanimous truth of\nit!\"\n\n\"Oh, if it's the WHOLE truth!----\" She let him clasp her. \"There's my\ntorment, you see. I thought that was what your silence meant till I made\nyou break it. Now I want to be sure that I was right.\"\n\n\"What can I tell you to make you sure?\"\n\n\"You can let me tell YOU everything first.\" She drew away, but without\ntaking her hands from him. \"Owen saw you in Paris,\" she began.\n\nShe looked at him and he faced her steadily. The light was full on his\npleasantly-browned face, his grey eyes, his frank white forehead. She\nnoticed for the first time a seal-ring in a setting of twisted silver on\nthe hand he had kept on hers.\n\n\"In Paris? Oh, yes...So he did.\"\n\n\"He came back and told me. I think you talked to him a moment in a\ntheatre. I asked if you'd spoken of my having put you off--or if you'd\nsent me any message. He didn't remember that you had.\"\n\n\"In a crush--in a Paris foyer? My dear!\"\n\n\"It was absurd of me! But Owen and I have always been on odd kind of\nbrother-and-sister terms. I think he guessed about us when he saw you\nwith me in London. So he teased me a little and tried to make me curious\nabout you; and when he saw he'd succeeded he told me he hadn't had time\nto say much to you because you were in such a hurry to get back to the\nlady you were with.\"\n\nHe still held her hands, but she felt no tremor in his, and the blood\ndid not stir in his brown cheek. He seemed to be honestly turning over\nhis memories. \"Yes: and what else did he tell you?\"\n\n\"Oh, not much, except that she was awfully pretty. When I asked him\nto describe her he said you had her tucked away in a baignoire and he\nhadn't actually seen her; but he saw the tail of her cloak, and somehow\nknew from that that she was pretty. One DOES, you know...I think he said\nthe cloak was pink.\"\n\nDarrow broke into a laugh. \"Of course it was--they always are! So that\nwas at the bottom of your doubts?\"\n\n\"Not at first. I only laughed. But afterward, when I wrote you and you\ndidn't answer----Oh, you DO see?\" she appealed to him.\n\nHe was looking at her gently. \"Yes: I see.\"\n\n\"It's not as if this were a light thing between us. I want you to know\nme as I am. If I thought that at that moment...when you were on your way\nhere, almost----\"\n\nHe dropped her hand and stood up. \"Yes, yes--I understand.\"\n\n\"But do you?\" Her look followed him. \"I'm not a goose of a girl. I\nknow...of course I KNOW...but there are things a woman feels...when\nwhat she knows doesn't make any difference. It's not that I want you to\nexplain--I mean about that particular evening. It's only that I want you\nto have the whole of my feeling. I didn't know what it was till I saw\nyou again. I never dreamed I should say such things to you!\"\n\n\"I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!\" He turned back\nand lifting a floating end of her scarf put his lips to it. \"But now\nthat you have, I know--I know,\" he smiled down at her.\n\n\"You know?\"\n\n\"That this is no light thing between us. Now you may ask me anything you\nplease! That was all I wanted to ask YOU.\"\n\nFor a long moment they looked at each other without speaking. She saw\nthe dancing spirit in his eyes turn grave and darken to a passionate\nsternness. He stooped and kissed her, and she sat as if folded in wings.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nIt was in the natural order of things that, on the way back to the\nhouse, their talk should have turned to the future.\n\nAnna was not eager to define it. She had an extraordinary sensitiveness\nto the impalpable elements of happiness, and as she walked at Darrow's\nside her imagination flew back and forth, spinning luminous webs of\nfeeling between herself and the scene about her. Every heightening of\nemotion produced for her a new effusion of beauty in visible things, and\nwith it the sense that such moments should be lingered over and absorbed\nlike some unrenewable miracle. She understood Darrow's impatience to see\ntheir plans take shape. She knew it must be so, she would not have had\nit otherwise; but to reach a point where she could fix her mind on his\nappeal for dates and decisions was like trying to break her way through\nthe silver tangle of an April wood.\n\nDarrow wished to use his diplomatic opportunities as a means of studying\ncertain economic and social problems with which he presently hoped to\ndeal in print; and with this in view he had asked for, and obtained, a\nSouth American appointment. Anna was ready to follow where he led, and\nnot reluctant to put new sights as well as new thoughts between herself\nand her past. She had, in a direct way, only Effie and Effie's education\nto consider; and there seemed, after due reflection, no reason why the\nmost anxious regard for these should not be conciliated with the demands\nof Darrow's career. Effie, it was evident, could be left to Madame de\nChantelle's care till the couple should have organized their life; and\nshe might even, as long as her future step-father's work retained him\nin distant posts, continue to divide her year between Givre and the\nantipodes.\n\nAs for Owen, who had reached his legal majority two years before, and\nwas soon to attain the age fixed for the taking over of his paternal\ninheritance, the arrival of this date would reduce his step-mother's\nresponsibility to a friendly concern for his welfare. This made for the\nprompt realization of Darrow's wishes, and there seemed no reason why\nthe marriage should not take place within the six weeks that remained of\nhis leave.\n\nThey passed out of the wood-walk into the open brightness of the garden.\nThe noon sunlight sheeted with gold the bronze flanks of the polygonal\nyews. Chrysanthemums, russet, saffron and orange, glowed like the\nefflorescence of an enchanted forest; belts of red begonia purpling to\nwine-colour ran like smouldering flame among the borders; and above\nthis outspread tapestry the house extended its harmonious length, the\nsoberness of its lines softened to grace in the luminous misty air.\n\nDarrow stood still, and Anna felt that his glance was travelling from\nher to the scene about them and then back to her face.\n\n\"You're sure you're prepared to give up Givre? You look so made for each\nother!\"\n\n\"Oh, Givre----\" She broke off suddenly, feeling as if her too careless\ntone had delivered all her past into his hands; and with one of her\ninstinctive movements of recoil she added: \"When Owen marries I shall\nhave to give it up.\"\n\n\"When Owen marries? That's looking some distance ahead! I want to be\ntold that meanwhile you'll have no regrets.\"\n\nShe hesitated. Why did he press her to uncover to him her poor starved\npast? A vague feeling of loyalty, a desire to spare what could no\nlonger harm her, made her answer evasively: \"There will probably be no\n'meanwhile.' Owen may marry before long.\"\n\nShe had not meant to touch on the subject, for her step-son had sworn\nher to provisional secrecy; but since the shortness of Darrow's leave\nnecessitated a prompt adjustment of their own plans, it was, after all,\ninevitable that she should give him at least a hint of Owen's.\n\n\"Owen marry? Why, he always seems like a faun in flannels! I hope he's\nfound a dryad. There might easily be one left in these blue-and-gold\nwoods.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you yet where he found his dryad, but she IS one, I\nbelieve: at any rate she'll become the Givre woods better than I do.\nOnly there may be difficulties----\"\n\n\"Well! At that age they're not always to be wished away.\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Owen, at any rate, has made up his mind to overcome\nthem; and I've promised to see him through.\"\n\nShe went on, after a moment's consideration, to explain that her\nstep-son's choice was, for various reasons, not likely to commend itself\nto his grandmother. \"She must be prepared for it, and I've promised to\ndo the preparing. You know I always HAVE seen him through things, and he\nrather counts on me now.\"\n\nShe fancied that Darrow's exclamation had in it a faint note of\nannoyance, and wondered if he again suspected her of seeking a pretext\nfor postponement.\n\n\"But once Owen's future is settled, you won't, surely, for the sake\nof what you call seeing him through, ask that I should go away again\nwithout you?\" He drew her closer as they walked. \"Owen will understand,\nif you don't. Since he's in the same case himself I'll throw myself on\nhis mercy. He'll see that I have the first claim on you; he won't even\nwant you not to see it.\"\n\n\"Owen sees everything: I'm not afraid of that. But his future isn't\nsettled. He's very young to marry--too young, his grandmother is sure to\nthink--and the marriage he wants to make is not likely to convince her\nto the contrary.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that it's like his first choice?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! But it's not what Madame de Chantelle would call a good match;\nit's not even what I call a wise one.\"\n\n\"Yet you're backing him up?\"\n\n\"Yet I'm backing him up.\" She paused. \"I wonder if you'll understand?\nWhat I've most wanted for him, and shall want for Effie, is that\nthey shall always feel free to make their own mistakes, and never, if\npossible, be persuaded to make other people's. Even if Owen's marriage\nis a mistake, and has to be paid for, I believe he'll learn and grow in\nthe paying. Of course I can't make Madame de Chantelle see this; but I\ncan remind her that, with his character--his big rushes of impulse,\nhis odd intervals of ebb and apathy--she may drive him into some worse\nblunder if she thwarts him now.\"\n\n\"And you mean to break the news to her as soon as she comes back from\nOuchy?\"\n\n\"As soon as I see my way to it. She knows the girl and likes her: that's\nour hope. And yet it may, in the end, prove our danger, make it harder\nfor us all, when she learns the truth, than if Owen had chosen a\nstranger. I can't tell you more till I've told her: I've promised Owen\nnot to tell any one. All I ask you is to give me time, to give me a few\ndays at any rate She's been wonderfully 'nice,' as she would call it,\nabout you, and about the fact of my having soon to leave Givre; but\nthat, again, may make it harder for Owen. At any rate, you can see,\ncan't you, how it makes me want to stand by him? You see, I couldn't\nbear it if the least fraction of my happiness seemed to be stolen from\nhis--as if it were a little scrap of happiness that had to be pieced out\nwith other people's!\" She clasped her hands on Darrow's arm. \"I want\nour life to be like a house with all the windows lit: I'd like to string\nlanterns from the roof and chimneys!\"\n\nShe ended with an inward tremor. All through her exposition and her\nappeal she had told herself that the moment could hardly have been less\nwell chosen. In Darrow's place she would have felt, as he doubtless\ndid, that her carefully developed argument was only the disguise of an\nhabitual indecision. It was the hour of all others when she would have\nliked to affirm herself by brushing aside every obstacle to his wishes;\nyet it was only by opposing them that she could show the strength of\ncharacter she wanted him to feel in her.\n\nBut as she talked she began to see that Darrow's face gave back no\nreflection of her words, that he continued to wear the abstracted look\nof a man who is not listening to what is said to him. It caused her a\nslight pang to discover that his thoughts could wander at such a moment;\nthen, with a flush of joy she perceived the reason.\n\nIn some undefinable way she had become aware, without turning her\nhead, that he was steeped in the sense of her nearness, absorbed in\ncontemplating the details of her face and dress; and the discovery\nmade the words throng to her lips. She felt herself speak with ease,\nauthority, conviction. She said to herself: \"He doesn't care what I\nsay--it's enough that I say it--even if it's stupid he'll like me better\nfor it...\" She knew that every inflexion of her voice, every gesture,\nevery characteristic of her person--its very defects, the fact that her\nforehead was too high, that her eyes were not large enough, that her\nhands, though slender, were not small, and that the fingers did not\ntaper--she knew that these deficiencies were so many channels through\nwhich her influence streamed to him; that she pleased him in spite of\nthem, perhaps because of them; that he wanted her as she was, and not as\nshe would have liked to be; and for the first time she felt in her veins\nthe security and lightness of happy love.\n\nThey reached the court and walked under the limes toward the house. The\nhall door stood wide, and through the windows opening on the terrace the\nsun slanted across the black and white floor, the faded tapestry chairs,\nand Darrow's travelling coat and cap, which lay among the cloaks and\nrugs piled on a bench against the wall.\n\nThe sight of these garments, lying among her own wraps, gave her a sense\nof homely intimacy. It was as if her happiness came down from the skies\nand took on the plain dress of daily things. At last she seemed to hold\nit in her hand.\n\nAs they entered the hall her eye lit on an unstamped note conspicuously\nplaced on the table.\n\n\"From Owen! He must have rushed off somewhere in the motor.\"\n\nShe felt a secret stir of pleasure at the immediate inference that she\nand Darrow would probably lunch alone. Then she opened the note and\nstared at it in wonder.\n\n\"Dear,\" Owen wrote, \"after what you said yesterday I can't wait another\nhour, and I'm off to Francheuil, to catch the Dijon express and travel\nback with them. Don't be frightened; I won't speak unless it's safe to.\nTrust me for that--but I had to go.\"\n\nShe looked up slowly.\n\n\"He's gone to Dijon to meet his grandmother. Oh, I hope I haven't made a\nmistake!\"\n\n\"You? Why, what have you to do with his going to Dijon?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"The day before yesterday I told him, for the first time,\nthat I meant to see him through, no matter what happened. And I'm afraid\nhe's lost his head, and will be imprudent and spoil things. You see, I\nhadn't meant to say a word to him till I'd had time to prepare Madame de\nChantelle.\"\n\nShe felt that Darrow was looking at her and reading her thoughts, and\nthe colour flew to her face. \"Yes: it was when I heard you were coming\nthat I told him. I wanted him to feel as I felt...it seemed too unkind\nto make him wait!\" Her hand was in his, and his arm rested for a moment\non her shoulder.\n\n\"It WOULD have been too unkind to make him wait.\"\n\nThey moved side by side toward the stairs. Through the haze of bliss\nenveloping her, Owen's affairs seemed curiously unimportant and remote.\nNothing really mattered but this torrent of light in her veins. She put\nher foot on the lowest step, saying: \"It's nearly luncheon time--I must\ntake off my hat...\" and as she started up the stairs Darrow stood below\nin the hall and watched her. But the distance between them did not make\nhim seem less near: it was as if his thoughts moved with her and touched\nher like endearing hands.\n\nIn her bedroom she shut the door and stood still, looking about her in\na fit of dreamy wonder. Her feelings were unlike any she had ever known:\nricher, deeper, more complete. For the first time everything in her,\nfrom head to foot, seemed to be feeding the same full current of\nsensation.\n\nShe took off her hat and went to the dressing-table to smooth her hair.\nThe pressure of the hat had flattened the dark strands on her forehead;\nher face was paler than usual, with shadows about the eyes. She felt a\npang of regret for the wasted years. \"If I look like this today,\" she\nsaid to herself, \"what will he think of me when I'm ill or worried?\" She\nbegan to run her fingers through her hair, rejoicing in its thickness;\nthen she desisted and sat still, resting her chin on her hands.\n\n\"I want him to see me as I am,\" she thought.\n\nDeeper than the deepest fibre of her vanity was the triumphant sense\nthat AS SHE WAS, with her flattened hair, her tired pallor, her thin\nsleeves a little tumbled by the weight of her jacket, he would like her\neven better, feel her nearer, dearer, more desirable, than in all the\nsplendours she might put on for him. In the light of this discovery she\nstudied her face with a new intentness, seeing its defects as she had\nnever seen them, yet seeing them through a kind of radiance, as though\nlove were a luminous medium into which she had been bodily plunged.\n\nShe was glad now that she had confessed her doubts and her jealousy.\nShe divined that a man in love may be flattered by such involuntary\nbetrayals, that there are moments when respect for his liberty appeals\nto him less than the inability to respect it: moments so propitious\nthat a woman's very mistakes and indiscretions may help to establish her\ndominion. The sense of power she had been aware of in talking to Darrow\ncame back with ten-fold force. She felt like testing him by the most\nfantastic exactions, and at the same moment she longed to humble herself\nbefore him, to make herself the shadow and echo of his mood. She wanted\nto linger with him in a world of fancy and yet to walk at his side in\nthe world of fact. She wanted him to feel her power and yet to love her\nfor her ignorance and humility. She felt like a slave, and a goddess,\nand a girl in her teens...\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nDarrow, late that evening, threw himself into an armchair before his\nfire and mused.\n\nThe room was propitious to meditation. The red-veiled lamp, the corners\nof shadow, the splashes of firelight on the curves of old full-bodied\nwardrobes and cabinets, gave it an air of intimacy increased by its\nfaded hangings, its slightly frayed and threadbare rugs. Everything in\nit was harmoniously shabby, with a subtle sought-for shabbiness in which\nDarrow fancied he discerned the touch of Fraser Leath. But Fraser Leath\nhad grown so unimportant a factor in the scheme of things that these\nmarks of his presence caused the young man no emotion beyond that of a\nfaint retrospective amusement.\n\nThe afternoon and evening had been perfect.\n\nAfter a moment of concern over her step-son's departure, Anna had\nsurrendered herself to her happiness with an impetuosity that Darrow had\nnever suspected in her. Early in the afternoon they had gone out in the\nmotor, traversing miles of sober-tinted landscape in which, here and\nthere, a scarlet vineyard flamed, clattering through the streets of\nstony villages, coming out on low slopes above the river, or winding\nthrough the pale gold of narrow wood-roads with the blue of clear-cut\nhills at their end. Over everything lay a faint sunshine that seemed\ndissolved in the still air, and the smell of wet roots and decaying\nleaves was merged in the pungent scent of burning underbrush. Once, at\nthe turn of a wall, they stopped the motor before a ruined gateway and,\nstumbling along a road full of ruts, stood before a little old deserted\nhouse, fantastically carved and chimneyed, which lay in a moat under the\nshade of ancient trees. They paced the paths between the trees, found\na mouldy Temple of Love on an islet among reeds and plantains, and,\nsitting on a bench in the stable-yard, watched the pigeons circling\nagainst the sunset over their cot of patterned brick. Then the motor\nflew on into the dusk...\n\nWhen they came in they sat beside the fire in the oak drawing-room,\nand Darrow noticed how delicately her head stood out against the sombre\npanelling, and mused on the enjoyment there would always be in the mere\nfact of watching her hands as they moved about among the tea-things...\n\nThey dined late, and facing her across the table, with its low lights\nand flowers, he felt an extraordinary pleasure in seeing her again in\nevening dress, and in letting his eyes dwell on the proud shy set of her\nhead, the way her dark hair clasped it, and the girlish thinness of her\nneck above the slight swell of the breast. His imagination was struck\nby the quality of reticence in her beauty. She suggested a fine portrait\nkept down to a few tones, or a Greek vase on which the play of light is\nthe only pattern.\n\nAfter dinner they went out on the terrace for a look at the moon-misted\npark. Through the crepuscular whiteness the trees hung in blotted\nmasses. Below the terrace, the garden drew its dark diagrams between\nstatues that stood like muffled conspirators on the edge of the shadow.\nFarther off, the meadows unrolled a silver-shot tissue to the mantling\nof mist above the river; and the autumn stars trembled overhead like\ntheir own reflections seen in dim water.\n\nHe lit his cigar, and they walked slowly up and down the flags in the\nlanguid air, till he put an arm about her, saying: \"You mustn't stay\ntill you're chilled\"; then they went back into the room and drew up\ntheir chairs to the fire.\n\nIt seemed only a moment later that she said: \"It must be after eleven,\"\nand stood up and looked down on him, smiling faintly. He sat\nstill, absorbing the look, and thinking: \"There'll be evenings and\nevenings\"--till she came nearer, bent over him, and with a hand on his\nshoulder said: \"Good night.\"\n\nHe got to his feet and put his arms about her.\n\n\"Good night,\" he answered, and held her fast; and they gave each other a\nlong kiss of promise and communion.\n\nThe memory of it glowed in him still as he sat over his crumbling fire;\nbut beneath his physical exultation he felt a certain gravity of mood.\nHis happiness was in some sort the rallying-point of many scattered\npurposes. He summed it up vaguely by saying to himself that to be loved\nby a woman like that made \"all the difference\"...He was a little tired\nof experimenting on life; he wanted to \"take a line\", to follow things\nup, to centralize and concentrate, and produce results. Two or three\nmore years of diplomacy--with her beside him!--and then their real life\nwould begin: study, travel and book-making for him, and for her--well,\nthe joy, at any rate, of getting out of an atmosphere of bric-a-brac and\ncard-leaving into the open air of competing activities.\n\nThe desire for change had for some time been latent in him, and his\nmeeting with Mrs. Leath the previous spring had given it a definite\ndirection. With such a comrade to focus and stimulate his energies he\nfelt modestly but agreeably sure of \"doing something\". And under this\nassurance was the lurking sense that he was somehow worthy of his\nopportunity. His life, on the whole, had been a creditable affair. Out\nof modest chances and middling talents he had built himself a fairly\nmarked personality, known some exceptional people, done a number of\ninteresting and a few rather difficult things, and found himself, at\nthirty-seven, possessed of an intellectual ambition sufficient to occupy\nthe passage to a robust and energetic old age. As for the private and\npersonal side of his life, it had come up to the current standards, and\nif it had dropped, now and then, below a more ideal measure, even these\ndeclines had been brief, parenthetic, incidental. In the recognized\nessentials he had always remained strictly within the limit of his\nscruples.\n\nFrom this reassuring survey of his case he came back to the\ncontemplation of its crowning felicity. His mind turned again to his\nfirst meeting with Anna Summers and took up one by one the threads of\ntheir faintly sketched romance. He dwelt with pardonable pride on\nthe fact that fate had so early marked him for the high privilege of\npossessing her: it seemed to mean that they had really, in the truest\nsense of the ill-used phrase, been made for each other.\n\nDeeper still than all these satisfactions was the mere elemental sense\nof well-being in her presence. That, after all, was what proved her to\nbe the woman for him: the pleasure he took in the set of her head, the\nway her hair grew on her forehead and at the nape, her steady gaze when\nhe spoke, the grave freedom of her gait and gestures. He recalled every\ndetail of her face, the fine veinings of the temples, the bluish-brown\nshadows in her upper lids, and the way the reflections of two stars\nseemed to form and break up in her eyes when he held her close to him...\n\nIf he had had any doubt as to the nature of her feeling for him those\ndissolving stars would have allayed it. She was reserved, she was shy\neven, was what the shallow and effusive would call \"cold\". She was like\na picture so hung that it can be seen only at a certain angle: an angle\nknown to no one but its possessor. The thought flattered his sense\nof possessorship...He felt that the smile on his lips would have been\nfatuous had it had a witness. He was thinking of her look when she had\nquestioned him about his meeting with Owen at the theatre: less of her\nwords than of her look, and of the effort the question cost her: the\nreddening of her cheek, the deepening of the strained line between her\nbrows, the way her eyes sought shelter and then turned and drew on him.\nPride and passion were in the conflict--magnificent qualities in a wife!\nThe sight almost made up for his momentary embarrassment at the rousing\nof a memory which had no place in his present picture of himself.\n\nYes! It was worth a good deal to watch that fight between her instinct\nand her intelligence, and know one's self the object of the struggle...\n\nMingled with these sensations were considerations of another order. He\nreflected with satisfaction that she was the kind of woman with whom\none would like to be seen in public. It would be distinctly agreeable\nto follow her into drawing-rooms, to walk after her down the aisle of a\ntheatre, to get in and out of trains with her, to say \"my wife\" of her\nto all sorts of people. He draped these details in the handsome\nphrase \"She's a woman to be proud of\", and felt that this fact somehow\njustified and ennobled his instinctive boyish satisfaction in loving\nher.\n\nHe stood up, rambled across the room and leaned out for a while into\nthe starry night. Then he dropped again into his armchair with a sigh of\ndeep content.\n\n\"Oh, hang it,\" he suddenly exclaimed, \"it's the best thing that's ever\nhappened to me, anyhow!\"\n\n\nThe next day was even better. He felt, and knew she felt, that they had\nreached a clearer understanding of each other. It was as if, after a\nswim through bright opposing waves, with a dazzle of sun in their eyes,\nthey had gained an inlet in the shades of a cliff, where they could\nfloat on the still surface and gaze far down into the depths.\n\nNow and then, as they walked and talked, he felt a thrill of youthful\nwonder at the coincidence of their views and their experiences, at the\nway their minds leapt to the same point in the same instant.\n\n\"The old delusion, I suppose,\" he smiled to himself. \"Will Nature never\ntire of the trick?\"\n\nBut he knew it was more than that. There were moments in their talk when\nhe felt, distinctly and unmistakably, the solid ground of friendship\nunderneath the whirling dance of his sensations. \"How I should like her\nif I didn't love her!\" he summed it up, wondering at the miracle of such\na union.\n\nIn the course of the morning a telegram had come from Owen Leath,\nannouncing that he, his grandmother and Effie would arrive from Dijon\nthat afternoon at four. The station of the main line was eight or ten\nmiles from Givre, and Anna, soon after three, left in the motor to meet\nthe travellers.\n\nWhen she had gone Darrow started for a walk, planning to get back late,\nin order that the reunited family might have the end of the afternoon\nto themselves. He roamed the country-side till long after dark, and the\nstable-clock of Givre was striking seven as he walked up the avenue to\nthe court.\n\nIn the hall, coming down the stairs, he encountered Anna. Her face was\nserene, and his first glance showed him that Owen had kept his word and\nthat none of her forebodings had been fulfilled.\n\nShe had just come down from the school-room, where Effie and the\ngoverness were having supper; the little girl, she told him, looked\nimmensely better for her Swiss holiday, but was dropping with sleep\nafter the journey, and too tired to make her habitual appearance in the\ndrawing-room before being put to bed. Madame de Chantelle was resting,\nbut would be down for dinner; and as for Owen, Anna supposed he was off\nsomewhere in the park--he had a passion for prowling about the park at\nnightfall...\n\nDarrow followed her into the brown room, where the tea-table had been\nleft for him. He declined her offer of tea, but she lingered a moment\nto tell him that Owen had in fact kept his word, and that Madame de\nChantelle had come back in the best of humours, and unsuspicious of the\nblow about to fall.\n\n\"She has enjoyed her month at Ouchy, and it has given her a lot to talk\nabout--her symptoms, and the rival doctors, and the people at the hotel.\nIt seems she met your Ambassadress there, and Lady Wantley, and\nsome other London friends of yours, and she's heard what she calls\n'delightful things' about you: she told me to tell you so. She attaches\ngreat importance to the fact that your grandmother was an Everard of\nAlbany. She's prepared to open her arms to you. I don't know whether it\nwon't make it harder for poor Owen...the contrast, I mean...There are no\nAmbassadresses or Everards to vouch for HIS choice! But you'll help me,\nwon't you? You'll help me to help him? To-morrow I'll tell you the rest.\nNow I must rush up and tuck in Effie...\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll see, we'll pull it off for him!\" he assured her; \"together,\nwe can't fail to pull it off.\"\n\nHe stood and watched her with a smile as she fled down the half-lit\nvista to the hall.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nIf Darrow, on entering the drawing-room before dinner, examined its new\noccupant with unusual interest, it was more on Owen Leath's account than\nhis own.\n\nAnna's hints had roused his interest in the lad's love affair, and he\nwondered what manner of girl the heroine of the coming conflict might\nbe. He had guessed that Owen's rebellion symbolized for his step-mother\nher own long struggle against the Leath conventions, and he understood\nthat if Anna so passionately abetted him it was partly because, as she\nowned, she wanted his liberation to coincide with hers.\n\nThe lady who was to represent, in the impending struggle, the forces of\norder and tradition was seated by the fire when Darrow entered. Among\nthe flowers and old furniture of the large pale-panelled room, Madame\nde Chantelle had the inanimate elegance of a figure introduced into a\n\"still-life\" to give the scale. And this, Darrow reflected, was exactly\nwhat she doubtless regarded as her chief obligation: he was sure she\nthought a great deal of \"measure\", and approved of most things only\nup to a certain point. She was a woman of sixty, with a figure at once\nyoung and old-fashioned. Her fair faded tints, her quaint corseting,\nthe passementerie on her tight-waisted dress, the velvet band on her\ntapering arm, made her resemble a \"carte de visite\" photograph of the\nmiddle sixties. One saw her, younger but no less invincibly lady-like,\nleaning on a chair with a fringed back, a curl in her neck, a locket\non her tuckered bosom, toward the end of an embossed morocco album\nbeginning with The Beauties of the Second Empire.\n\nShe received her daughter-in-law's suitor with an affability which\nimplied her knowledge and approval of his suit. Darrow had already\nguessed her to be a person who would instinctively oppose any suggested\nchanges, and then, after one had exhausted one's main arguments,\nunexpectedly yield to some small incidental reason, and adhere doggedly\nto her new position. She boasted of her old-fashioned prejudices, talked\na good deal of being a grandmother, and made a show of reaching up to\ntap Owen's shoulder, though his height was little more than hers.\n\nShe was full of a small pale prattle about the people she had seen\nat Ouchy, as to whom she had the minute statistical information of a\ngazetteer, without any apparent sense of personal differences. She said\nto Darrow: \"They tell me things are very much changed in America...Of\ncourse in my youth there WAS a Society\"...She had no desire to return\nthere she was sure the standards must be so different. \"There are\ncharming people everywhere...and one must always look on the best\nside...but when one has lived among Traditions it's difficult to adapt\none's self to the new ideas...These dreadful views of marriage...it's\nso hard to explain them to my French relations...I'm thankful to say I\ndon't pretend to understand them myself! But YOU'RE an Everard--I told\nAnna last spring in London that one sees that instantly\"...\n\nShe wandered off to the cooking and the service of the hotel at Ouchy.\nShe attached great importance to gastronomic details and to the manners\nof hotel servants. There, too, there was a falling off, she said. \"I don\nt know, of course; but people say it's owing to the Americans. Certainly\nmy waiter had a way of slapping down the dishes...they tell me that many\nof them are Anarchists...belong to Unions, you know.\" She appealed\nto Darrow's reported knowledge of economic conditions to confirm this\nominous rumour.\n\nAfter dinner Owen Leath wandered into the next room, where the piano\nstood, and began to play among the shadows. His step-mother presently\njoined him, and Darrow sat alone with Madame de Chantelle.\n\nShe took up the thread of her mild chat and carried it on at the\nsame pace as her knitting. Her conversation resembled the large\nloose-stranded web between her fingers: now and then she dropped a\nstitch, and went on regardless of the gap in the pattern.\n\nDarrow listened with a lazy sense of well-being. In the mental lull of\nthe after-dinner hour, with harmonious memories murmuring through\nhis mind, and the soft tints and shadowy spaces of the fine old room\ncharming his eyes to indolence, Madame de Chantelle's discourse seemed\nnot out of place. He could understand that, in the long run, the\natmosphere of Givre might be suffocating; but in his present mood its\nvery limitations had a grace.\n\nPresently he found the chance to say a word in his own behalf; and\nthereupon measured the advantage, never before particularly apparent to\nhim, of being related to the Everards of Albany. Madame de Chantelle's\nconception of her native country--to which she had not returned since\nher twentieth year--reminded him of an ancient geographer's map of the\nHyperborean regions. It was all a foggy blank, from which only one or\ntwo fixed outlines emerged; and one of these belonged to the Everards of\nAlbany.\n\nThe fact that they offered such firm footing--formed, so to speak,\na friendly territory on which the opposing powers could meet and\ntreat--helped him through the task of explaining and justifying himself\nas the successor of Fraser Leath. Madame de Chantelle could not resist\nsuch incontestable claims. She seemed to feel her son's hovering and\ndiscriminating presence, and she gave Darrow the sense that he was being\ntested and approved as a last addition to the Leath Collection.\n\nShe also made him aware of the immense advantage he possessed in\nbelonging to the diplomatic profession. She spoke of this humdrum\ncalling as a Career, and gave Darrow to understand that she supposed him\nto have been seducing Duchesses when he was not negotiating Treaties.\nHe heard again quaint phrases which romantic old ladies had used in his\nyouth: \"Brilliant diplomatic society...social advantages...the entree\neverywhere...nothing else FORMS a young man in the same way...\" and she\nsighingly added that she could have wished her grandson had chosen the\nsame path to glory.\n\nDarrow prudently suppressed his own view of the profession, as well\nas the fact that he had adopted it provisionally, and for reasons\nless social than sociological; and the talk presently passed on to the\nsubject of his future plans.\n\nHere again, Madame de Chantelle's awe of the Career made her admit\nthe necessity of Anna's consenting to an early marriage. The fact that\nDarrow was \"ordered\" to South America seemed to put him in the romantic\nlight of a young soldier charged to lead a forlorn hope: she sighed and\nsaid: \"At such moments a wife's duty is at her husband's side.\"\n\nThe problem of Effie's future might have disturbed her, she added; but\nsince Anna, for a time, consented to leave the little girl with her,\nthat problem was at any rate deferred. She spoke plaintively of the\nresponsibility of looking after her granddaughter, but Darrow divined\nthat she enjoyed the flavour of the word more than she felt the weight\nof the fact.\n\n\"Effie's a perfect child. She's more like my son, perhaps, than dear\nOwen. She'll never intentionally give me the least trouble. But of\ncourse the responsibility will be great...I'm not sure I should dare\nto undertake it if it were not for her having such a treasure of a\ngoverness. Has Anna told you about our little governess? After all the\nworry we had last year, with one impossible creature after another, it\nseems providential, just now, to have found her. At first we were afraid\nshe was too young; but now we've the greatest confidence in her. So\nclever and amusing--and SUCH a lady! I don't say her education's all it\nmight be...no drawing or singing...but one can't have everything; and\nshe speaks Italian...\"\n\nMadame de Chantelle's fond insistence on the likeness between Effie\nLeath and her father, if not particularly gratifying to Darrow, had at\nleast increased his desire to see the little girl. It gave him an\nodd feeling of discomfort to think that she should have any of the\ncharacteristics of the late Fraser Leath: he had, somehow, fantastically\npictured her as the mystical offspring of the early tenderness between\nhimself and Anna Summers.\n\nHis encounter with Effie took place the next morning, on the lawn below\nthe terrace, where he found her, in the early sunshine, knocking about\ngolf balls with her brother. Almost at once, and with infinite relief,\nhe saw that the resemblance of which Madame de Chantelle boasted was\nmainly external. Even that discovery was slightly distasteful, though\nDarrow was forced to own that Fraser Leath's straight-featured fairness\nhad lent itself to the production of a peculiarly finished image of\nchildish purity. But it was evident that other elements had also gone\nto the making of Effie, and that another spirit sat in her eyes. Her\nserious handshake, her \"pretty\" greeting, were worthy of the Leath\ntradition, and he guessed her to be more malleable than Owen, more\nsubject to the influences of Givre; but the shout with which she\nreturned to her romp had in it the note of her mother's emancipation.\n\nHe had begged a holiday for her, and when Mrs. Leath appeared he and she\nand the little girl went off for a ramble. Anna wished her daughter to\nhave time to make friends with Darrow before learning in what relation\nhe was to stand to her; and the three roamed the woods and fields till\nthe distant chime of the stable-clock made them turn back for luncheon.\n\nEffie, who was attended by a shaggy terrier, had picked up two or three\nsubordinate dogs at the stable; and as she trotted on ahead with her\nyapping escort, Anna hung back to throw a look at Darrow.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered it, \"she's exquisite...Oh, I see what I'm asking of\nyou! But she'll be quite happy here, won't she? And you must remember it\nwon't be for long...\"\n\nAnna sighed her acquiescence. \"Oh, she'll be happy here. It's her nature\nto be happy. She'll apply herself to it, conscientiously, as she does\nto her lessons, and to what she calls 'being good'...In a way, you see,\nthat's just what worries me. Her idea of 'being good' is to please the\nperson she's with--she puts her whole dear little mind on it! And so, if\never she's with the wrong person----\"\n\n\"But surely there's no danger of that just now? Madame de Chantelle\ntells me that you've at last put your hand on a perfect governess----\"\n\nAnna, without answering, glanced away from him toward her daughter.\n\n\"It's lucky, at any rate,\" Darrow continued, \"that Madame de Chantelle\nthinks her so.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think very highly of her too.\"\n\n\"Highly enough to feel quite satisfied to leave her with Effie?\"\n\n\"Yes. She's just the person for Effie. Only, of course, one never\nknows...She's young, and she might take it into her head to leave us...\"\nAfter a pause she added: \"I'm naturally anxious to know what you think\nof her.\"\n\nWhen they entered the house the hands of the hall clock stood within a\nfew minutes of the luncheon hour. Anna led Effie off to have her hair\nsmoothed and Darrow wandered into the oak sitting-room, which he found\nuntenanted. The sun lay pleasantly on its brown walls, on the scattered\nbooks and the flowers in old porcelain vases. In his eyes lingered the\nvision of the dark-haired mother mounting the stairs with her little\nfair daughter. The contrast between them seemed a last touch of grace\nin the complex harmony of things. He stood in the window, looking out at\nthe park, and brooding inwardly upon his happiness...\n\nHe was roused by Effie's voice and the scamper of her feet down the long\nfloors behind him.\n\n\"Here he is! Here he is!\" she cried, flying over the threshold.\n\nHe turned and stooped to her with a smile, and as she caught his hand he\nperceived that she was trying to draw him toward some one who had paused\nbehind her in the doorway, and whom he supposed to be her mother.\n\n\"HERE he is!\" Effie repeated, with her sweet impatience.\n\nThe figure in the doorway came forward and Darrow, looking up, found\nhimself face to face with Sophy Viner. They stood still, a yard or two\napart, and looked at each other without speaking.\n\nAs they paused there, a shadow fell across one of the terrace windows,\nand Owen Leath stepped whistling into the room. In his rough shooting\nclothes, with the glow of exercise under his fair skin, he looked\nextraordinarily light-hearted and happy. Darrow, with a quick\nside-glance, noticed this, and perceived also that the glow on the\nyouth's cheek had deepened suddenly to red. He too stopped short, and\nthe three stood there motionless for a barely perceptible beat of time.\nDuring its lapse, Darrow's eyes had turned back from Owen's face to that\nof the girl between them. He had the sense that, whatever was done, it\nwas he who must do it, and that it must be done immediately. He went\nforward and held out his hand.\n\n\"How do you do, Miss Viner?\"\n\nShe answered: \"How do you do?\" in a voice that sounded clear and\nnatural; and the next moment he again became aware of steps behind him,\nand knew that Mrs. Leath was in the room.\n\nTo his strained senses there seemed to be another just measurable\npause before Anna said, looking gaily about the little group: \"Has Owen\nintroduced you? This is Effie's friend, Miss Viner.\"\n\nEffie, still hanging on her governess's arm, pressed herself closer with\na little gesture of appropriation; and Miss Viner laid her hand on her\npupil's hair.\n\nDarrow felt that Anna's eyes had turned to him.\n\n\"I think Miss Viner and I have met already--several years ago in\nLondon.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Sophy Viner, in the same clear voice.\n\n\"How charming! Then we're all friends. But luncheon must be ready,\" said\nMrs. Leath.\n\nShe turned back to the door, and the little procession moved down the\ntwo long drawing-rooms, with Effie waltzing on ahead.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nMadame de Chantelle and Anna had planned, for the afternoon, a visit to\na remotely situated acquaintance whom the introduction of the motor had\ntransformed into a neighbour. Effie was to pay for her morning's holiday\nby an hour or two in the school-room, and Owen suggested that he and\nDarrow should betake themselves to a distant covert in the desultory\nquest for pheasants.\n\nDarrow was not an ardent sportsman, but any pretext for physical\nactivity would have been acceptable at the moment; and he was glad both\nto get away from the house and not to be left to himself.\n\nWhen he came downstairs the motor was at the door, and Anna stood before\nthe hall mirror, swathing her hat in veils. She turned at the sound of\nhis step and smiled at him for a long full moment.\n\n\"I'd no idea you knew Miss Viner,\" she said, as he helped her into her\nlong coat.\n\n\"It came back to me, luckily, that I'd seen her two or three times in\nLondon, several years ago. She was secretary, or something of the sort,\nin the background of a house where I used to dine.\"\n\nHe loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase, but he had uttered\nit deliberately, had been secretly practising it all through the\ninterminable hour at the luncheon-table. Now that it was spoken, he\nshivered at its note of condescension. In such cases one was almost sure\nto overdo...But Anna seemed to notice nothing unusual.\n\n\"Was she really? You must tell me all about it--tell me exactly how she\nstruck you. I'm so glad it turns out that you know her.\"\n\n\"'Know' is rather exaggerated: we used to pass each other on the\nstairs.\"\n\nMadame de Chantelle and Owen appeared together as he spoke, and Anna,\ngathering up her wraps, said: \"You'll tell me about that, then. Try and\nremember everything you can.\"\n\nAs he tramped through the woods at his young host's side, Darrow felt\nthe partial relief from thought produced by exercise and the obligation\nto talk. Little as he cared for shooting, he had the habit of\nconcentration which makes it natural for a man to throw himself wholly\ninto whatever business he has in hand, and there were moments of the\nafternoon when a sudden whirr in the undergrowth, a vivider gleam\nagainst the hazy browns and greys of the woods, was enough to fill the\nforeground of his attention. But all the while, behind these voluntarily\nemphasized sensations, his secret consciousness continued to revolve on\na loud wheel of thought. For a time it seemed to be sweeping him through\ndeep gulfs of darkness. His sensations were too swift and swarming to be\ndisentangled. He had an almost physical sense of struggling for air,\nof battling helplessly with material obstructions, as though the russet\ncovert through which he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle...\n\nSnatches of his companion's talk drifted to him intermittently through\nthe confusion of his thoughts. He caught eager self-revealing phrases,\nand understood that Owen was saying things about himself, perhaps\nhinting indirectly at the hopes for which Darrow had been prepared by\nAnna's confidences. He had already become aware that the lad liked\nhim, and had meant to take the first opportunity of showing that he\nreciprocated the feeling. But the effort of fixing his attention on\nOwen's words was so great that it left no power for more than the\nbriefest and most inexpressive replies.\n\nYoung Leath, it appeared, felt that he had reached a turning-point in\nhis career, a height from which he could impartially survey his past\nprogress and projected endeavour. At one time he had had musical and\nliterary yearnings, visions of desultory artistic indulgence; but these\nhad of late been superseded by the resolute determination to plunge into\npractical life.\n\n\"I don't want, you see,\" Darrow heard him explaining, \"to drift into\nwhat my grandmother, poor dear, is trying to make of me: an adjunct of\nGivre. I don't want--hang it all!--to slip into collecting sensations\nas my father collected snuff-boxes. I want Effie to have Givre--it's my\ngrandmother's, you know, to do as she likes with; and I've understood\nlately that if it belonged to me it would gradually gobble me up. I want\nto get out of it, into a life that's big and ugly and struggling. If\nI can extract beauty out of THAT, so much the better: that'll prove my\nvocation. But I want to MAKE beauty, not be drowned in the ready-made,\nlike a bee in a pot of honey.\"\n\nDarrow knew that he was being appealed to for corroboration of these\nviews and for encouragement in the course to which they pointed. To his\nown ears his answers sounded now curt, now irrelevant: at one moment he\nseemed chillingly indifferent, at another he heard himself launching out\non a flood of hazy discursiveness. He dared not look at Owen, for fear\nof detecting the lad's surprise at these senseless transitions. And\nthrough the confusion of his inward struggles and outward loquacity he\nheard the ceaseless trip-hammer beat of the question: \"What in God's\nname shall I do?\"...\n\nTo get back to the house before Anna's return seemed his most pressing\nnecessity. He did not clearly know why: he simply felt that he ought to\nbe there. At one moment it occurred to him that Miss Viner might want to\nspeak to him alone--and again, in the same flash, that it would probably\nbe the last thing she would want...At any rate, he felt he ought to try\nto speak to HER; or at least be prepared to do so, if the chance should\noccur...\n\nFinally, toward four, he told his companion that he had some letters\non his mind and must get back to the house and despatch them before the\nladies returned. He left Owen with the beater and walked on to the edge\nof the covert. At the park gates he struck obliquely through the trees,\nfollowing a grass avenue at the end of which he had caught a glimpse\nof the roof of the chapel. A grey haze had blotted out the sun and the\nstill air clung about him tepidly. At length the house-front raised\nbefore him its expanse of damp-silvered brick, and he was struck afresh\nby the high decorum of its calm lines and soberly massed surfaces. It\nmade him feel, in the turbid coil of his fears and passions, like a\nmuddy tramp forcing his way into some pure sequestered shrine...\n\nBy and bye, he knew, he should have to think the complex horror out,\nslowly, systematically, bit by bit; but for the moment it was whirling\nhim about so fast that he could just clutch at its sharp spikes and\nbe tossed off again. Only one definite immediate fact stuck in his\nquivering grasp. He must give the girl every chance--must hold himself\npassive till she had taken them...\n\nIn the court Effie ran up to him with her leaping terrier.\n\n\"I was coming out to meet you--you and Owen. Miss Viner was coming, too,\nand then she couldn't because she's got such a headache. I'm afraid I\ngave it to her because I did my division so disgracefully. It's too bad,\nisn't it? But won't you walk back with me? Nurse won't mind the least\nbit; she'd so much rather go in to tea.\"\n\nDarrow excused himself laughingly, on the plea that he had letters to\nwrite, which was much worse than having a headache, and not infrequently\nresulted in one.\n\n\"Oh, then you can go and write them in Owen's study. That's where\ngentlemen always write their letters.\"\n\nShe flew on with her dog and Darrow pursued his way to the house.\nEffie's suggestion struck him as useful. He had pictured himself\nas vaguely drifting about the drawing-rooms, and had perceived the\ndifficulty of Miss Viner's having to seek him there; but the study,\na small room on the right of the hall, was in easy sight from the\nstaircase, and so situated that there would be nothing marked in his\nbeing found there in talk with her.\n\nHe went in, leaving the door open, and sat down at the writing-table.\nThe room was a friendly heterogeneous place, the one repository, in the\nwell-ordered and amply-servanted house, of all its unclassified odds and\nends: Effie's croquet-box and fishing rods, Owen's guns and golf-sticks\nand racquets, his step-mother's flower-baskets and gardening implements,\neven Madame de Chantelle's embroidery frame, and the back numbers of the\nCatholic Weekly. The early twilight had begun to fall, and presently\na slanting ray across the desk showed Darrow that a servant was coming\nacross the hall with a lamp. He pulled out a sheet of note-paper and\nbegan to write at random, while the man, entering, put the lamp at his\nelbow and vaguely \"straightened\" the heap of newspapers tossed on the\ndivan. Then his steps died away and Darrow sat leaning his head on his\nlocked hands.\n\nPresently another step sounded on the stairs, wavered a moment and then\nmoved past the threshold of the study. Darrow got up and walked into\nthe hall, which was still unlighted. In the dimness he saw Sophy Viner\nstanding by the hall door in her hat and jacket. She stopped at sight\nof him, her hand on the door-bolt, and they stood for a second without\nspeaking.\n\n\"Have you seen Effie?\" she suddenly asked. \"She went out to meet you.\"\n\n\"She DID meet me, just now, in the court. She's gone on to join her\nbrother.\"\n\nDarrow spoke as naturally as he could, but his voice sounded to his own\nears like an amateur actor's in a \"light\" part.\n\nMiss Viner, without answering, drew back the bolt. He watched her in\nsilence as the door swung open; then he said: \"She has her nurse with\nher. She won't be long.\"\n\nShe stood irresolute, and he added: \"I was writing in there--won't you\ncome and have a little talk? Every one's out.\"\n\nThe last words struck him as not well-chosen, but there was no time to\nchoose. She paused a second longer and then crossed the threshold of the\nstudy. At luncheon she had sat with her back to the window, and beyond\nnoting that she had grown a little thinner, and had less colour and\nvivacity, he had seen no change in her; but now, as the lamplight fell\non her face, its whiteness startled him.\n\n\"Poor thing...poor thing...what in heaven's name can she suppose?\" he\nwondered.\n\n\"Do sit down--I want to talk to you,\" he said and pushed a chair toward\nher.\n\nShe did not seem to see it, or, if she did, she deliberately chose\nanother seat. He came back to his own chair and leaned his elbows on the\nblotter. She faced him from the farther side of the table.\n\n\"You promised to let me hear from you now and then,\" he began awkwardly,\nand with a sharp sense of his awkwardness.\n\nA faint smile made her face more tragic. \"Did I? There was nothing to\ntell. I've had no history--like the happy countries...\"\n\nHe waited a moment before asking: \"You ARE happy here?\"\n\n\"I WAS,\" she said with a faint emphasis.\n\n\"Why do you say 'was'? You're surely not thinking of going? There can't\nbe kinder people anywhere.\" Darrow hardly knew what he was saying; but\nher answer came to him with deadly definiteness.\n\n\"I suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay.\"\n\n\"On me?\" He stared at her across Owen's scattered papers. \"Good God!\nWhat can you think of me, to say that?\"\n\nThe mockery of the question flashed back at him from her wretched face.\nShe stood up, wandered away, and leaned an instant in the darkening\nwindow-frame. From there she turned to fling back at him: \"Don't imagine\nI'm the least bit sorry for anything!\"\n\nHe steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands.\nIt was harder, oh, damnably harder, than he had expected! Arguments,\nexpedients, palliations, evasions, all seemed to be slipping away\nfrom him: he was left face to face with the mere graceless fact of his\ninferiority. He lifted his head to ask at random: \"You've been here,\nthen, ever since?\"\n\n\"Since June; yes. It turned out that the Farlows were hunting for\nme--all the while--for this.\"\n\nShe stood facing him, her back to the window, evidently impatient to be\ngone, yet with something still to say, or that she expected to hear him\nsay. The sense of her expectancy benumbed him. What in heaven's name\ncould he say to her that was not an offense or a mockery?\n\n\"Your idea of the theatre--you gave that up at once, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, the theatre!\" She gave a little laugh. \"I couldn't wait for the\ntheatre. I had to take the first thing that offered; I took this.\"\n\nHe pushed on haltingly: \"I'm glad--extremely glad--you're happy\nhere...I'd counted on your letting me know if there was anything I could\ndo...The theatre, now--if you still regret it--if you're not contented\nhere...I know people in that line in London--I'm certain I can manage it\nfor you when I get back----\"\n\nShe moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask, in a voice that was\nhardly above a whisper: \"Then you DO want me to leave? Is that it?\"\n\nHe dropped his arms with a groan. \"Good heavens! How can you think such\nthings? At the time, you know, I begged you to let me do what I could,\nbut you wouldn't hear of it...and ever since I've been wanting to be of\nuse--to do something, anything, to help you...\"\n\nShe heard him through, motionless, without a quiver of the clasped hands\nshe rested on the edge of the table.\n\n\"If you want to help me, then--you can help me to stay here,\" she\nbrought out with low-toned intensity.\n\nThrough the stillness of the pause which followed, the bray of a\nmotor-horn sounded far down the drive. Instantly she turned, with a last\nwhite look at him, and fled from the room and up the stairs. He stood\nmotionless, benumbed by the shock of her last words. She was afraid,\nthen--afraid of him--sick with fear of him! The discovery beat him down\nto a lower depth...\n\nThe motor-horn sounded again, close at hand, and he turned and went\nup to his room. His letter-writing was a sufficient pretext for not\nimmediately joining the party about the tea-table, and he wanted to be\nalone and try to put a little order into his tumultuous thinking.\n\nUpstairs, the room held out the intimate welcome of its lamp and fire.\nEverything in it exhaled the same sense of peace and stability which,\ntwo evenings before, had lulled him to complacent meditation. His\narmchair again invited him from the hearth, but he was too agitated to\nsit still, and with sunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began\nto wander up and down the room.\n\nHis five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lights into the\nshadowy corners of his consciousness. The girl's absolute candour,\nher hard ardent honesty, was for the moment the vividest point in his\nthoughts. He wondered anew, as he had wondered before, at the way in\nwhich the harsh discipline of life had stripped her of false sentiment\nwithout laying the least touch on her pride. When they had parted, five\nmonths before, she had quietly but decidedly rejected all his offers\nof help, even to the suggestion of his trying to further her theatrical\naims: she had made it clear that she wished their brief alliance to\nleave no trace on their lives save that of its own smiling memory. But\nnow that they were unexpectedly confronted in a situation which seemed,\nto her terrified fancy, to put her at his mercy, her first impulse was\nto defend her right to the place she had won, and to learn as quickly\nas possible if he meant to dispute it. While he had pictured her as\nshrinking away from him in a tremor of self-effacement she had watched\nhis movements, made sure of her opportunity, and come straight down to\n\"have it out\" with him. He was so struck by the frankness and energy of\nthe proceeding that for a moment he lost sight of the view of his own\ncharacter implied in it.\n\n\"Poor thing...poor thing!\" he could only go on saying; and with the\nrepetition of the words the picture of himself as she must see him\npitiably took shape again.\n\nHe understood then, for the first time, how vague, in comparison with\nhers, had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief\nepisode of their relation. The incident had left in him a sense of\nexasperation and self-contempt, but that, as he now perceived, was\nchiefly, if not altogether, as it bore on his preconceived ideal of his\nattitude toward another woman. He had fallen below his own standard of\nsentimental loyalty, and if he thought of Sophy Viner it was mainly\nas the chance instrument of his lapse. These considerations were not\nagreeable to his pride, but they were forced on him by the example of\nher valiant common-sense. If he had cut a sorry figure in the business,\nhe owed it to her not to close his eyes to the fact any longer...\n\nBut when he opened them, what did he see? The situation, detestable at\nbest, would yet have been relatively simple if protecting Sophy Viner\nhad been the only duty involved in it. The fact that that duty was\nparamount did not do away with the contingent obligations. It was\nDarrow's instinct, in difficult moments, to go straight to the bottom\nof the difficulty; but he had never before had to take so dark a dive\nas this, and for the minute he shivered on the brink...Well, his first\nduty, at any rate, was to the girl: he must let her see that he meant to\nfulfill it to the last jot, and then try to find out how to square the\nfulfillment with the other problems already in his path...\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nIn the oak room he found Mrs. Leath, her mother-in-law and Effie. The\ngroup, as he came toward it down the long drawing-rooms, composed itself\nprettily about the tea-table. The lamps and the fire crossed their\ngleams on silver and porcelain, on the bright haze of Effie's hair and\non the whiteness of Anna's forehead, as she leaned back in her chair\nbehind the tea-urn.\n\nShe did not move at Darrow's approach, but lifted to him a deep gaze of\npeace and confidence. The look seemed to throw about him the spell of\na divine security: he felt the joy of a convalescent suddenly waking to\nfind the sunlight on his face.\n\nMadame de Chantelle, across her knitting, discoursed of their\nafternoon's excursion, with occasional pauses induced by the hypnotic\neffect of the fresh air; and Effie, kneeling, on the hearth, softly but\ninsistently sought to implant in her terrier's mind some notion of the\nrelation between a vertical attitude and sugar.\n\nDarrow took a chair behind the little girl, so that he might look across\nat her mother. It was almost a necessity for him, at the moment, to\nlet his eyes rest on Anna's face, and to meet, now and then, the proud\nshyness of her gaze.\n\nMadame de Chantelle presently enquired what had become of Owen, and\na moment later the window behind her opened, and her grandson, gun in\nhand, came in from the terrace. As he stood there in the lamp-light,\nwith dead leaves and bits of bramble clinging to his mud-spattered\nclothes, the scent of the night about him and its chill on his pale\nbright face, he really had the look of a young faun strayed in from the\nforest.\n\nEffie abandoned the terrier to fly to him. \"Oh, Owen, where in the world\nhave you been? I walked miles and miles with Nurse and couldn't find\nyou, and we met Jean and he said he didn't know where you'd gone.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows where I go, or what I see when I get there--that's the\nbeauty of it!\" he laughed back at her. \"But if you're good,\" he added,\n\"I'll tell you about it one of these days.\"\n\n\"Oh, now, Owen, now! I don't really believe I'll ever be much better\nthan I am now.\"\n\n\"Let Owen have his tea first,\" her mother suggested; but the young man,\ndeclining the offer, propped his gun against the wall, and, lighting\na cigarette, began to pace up and down the room in a way that reminded\nDarrow of his own caged wanderings. Effie pursued him with her\nblandishments, and for a while he poured out to her a low-voiced stream\nof nonsense; then he sat down beside his step-mother and leaned over to\nhelp himself to tea.\n\n\"Where's Miss Viner?\" he asked, as Effie climbed up on him. \"Why isn't\nshe here to chain up this ungovernable infant?\"\n\n\"Poor Miss Viner has a headache. Effie says she went to her room as soon\nas lessons were over, and sent word that she wouldn't be down for tea.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Owen, abruptly setting down his cup. He stood up, lit another\ncigarette, and wandered away to the piano in the room beyond.\n\nFrom the twilight where he sat a lonely music, borne on fantastic\nchords, floated to the group about the tea-table. Under its influence\nMadame de Chantelle's meditative pauses increased in length and\nfrequency, and Effie stretched herself on the hearth, her drowsy head\nagainst the dog. Presently her nurse appeared, and Anna rose at the same\ntime. \"Stop a minute in my sitting-room on your way up,\" she paused to\nsay to Darrow as she went.\n\nA few hours earlier, her request would have brought him instantly to his\nfeet. She had given him, on the day of his arrival, an inviting glimpse\nof the spacious book-lined room above stairs in which she had gathered\ntogether all the tokens of her personal tastes: the retreat in which,\nas one might fancy, Anna Leath had hidden the restless ghost of Anna\nSummers; and the thought of a talk with her there had been in his mind\never since. But now he sat motionless, as if spell-bound by the play of\nMadame de Chantelle's needles and the pulsations of Owen's fitful music.\n\n\"She will want to ask me about the girl,\" he repeated to himself, with a\nfresh sense of the insidious taint that embittered all his thoughts;\nthe hand of the slender-columned clock on the mantel-piece had spanned\na half-hour before shame at his own indecision finally drew him to his\nfeet.\n\nFrom her writing-table, where she sat over a pile of letters, Anna\nlifted her happy smile. The impulse to press his lips to it made him\ncome close and draw her upward. She threw her head back, as if surprised\nat the abruptness of the gesture; then her face leaned to his with the\nslow droop of a flower. He felt again the sweep of the secret tides, and\nall his fears went down in them.\n\nShe sat down in the sofa-corner by the fire and he drew an armchair\nclose to her. His gaze roamed peacefully about the quiet room.\n\n\"It's just like you--it is you,\" he said, as his eyes came back to her.\n\n\"It's a good place to be alone in--I don't think I've ever before cared\nto talk with any one here.\"\n\n\"Let's be quiet, then: it's the best way of talking.\"\n\n\"Yes; but we must save it up till later. There are things I want to say\nto you now.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair. \"Say them, then, and I'll listen.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I want you to tell me about Miss Viner.\"\n\n\"About Miss Viner?\" He summoned up a look of faint interrogation.\n\nHe thought she seemed surprised at his surprise. \"It's important,\nnaturally,\" she explained, \"that I should find out all I can about her\nbefore I leave.\"\n\n\"Important on Effie's account?\"\n\n\"On Effie's account--of course.\"\n\n\"Of course...But you've every reason to be satisfied, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Every apparent reason. We all like her. Effie's very fond of her, and\nshe seems to have a delightful influence on the child. But we know so\nlittle, after all--about her antecedents, I mean, and her past history.\nThat's why I want you to try and recall everything you heard about her\nwhen you used to see her in London.\"\n\n\"Oh, on that score I'm afraid I sha'n't be of much use. As I told you,\nshe was a mere shadow in the background of the house I saw her in--and\nthat was four or five years ago...\"\n\n\"When she was with a Mrs. Murrett?\"\n\n\"Yes; an appalling woman who runs a roaring dinner-factory that used now\nand then to catch me in its wheels. I escaped from them long ago; but\nin my time there used to be half a dozen fagged 'hands' to tend the\nmachine, and Miss Viner was one of them. I'm glad she's out of it, poor\ngirl!\" \"Then you never really saw anything of her there?\"\n\n\"I never had the chance. Mrs. Murrett discouraged any competition on the\npart of her subordinates.\"\n\n\"Especially such pretty ones, I suppose?\" Darrow made no comment, and\nshe continued: \"And Mrs. Murrett's own opinion--if she'd offered you\none--probably wouldn't have been of much value?\"\n\n\"Only in so far as her disapproval would, on general principles, have\nbeen a good mark for Miss Viner. But surely,\" he went on after a pause,\n\"you could have found out about her from the people through whom you\nfirst heard of her?\"\n\nAnna smiled. \"Oh, we heard of her through Adelaide Painter--;\" and in\nreply to his glance of interrogation she explained that the lady in\nquestion was a spinster of South Braintree, Massachusetts, who, having\ncome to Paris some thirty years earlier, to nurse a brother through an\nillness, had ever since protestingly and provisionally camped there in a\nstate of contemptuous protestation oddly manifested by her never taking\nthe slip-covers off her drawing-room chairs. Her long residence on\nGallic soil had not mitigated her hostility toward the creed and customs\nof the race, but though she always referred to the Catholic Church as\nthe Scarlet Woman and took the darkest views of French private\nlife, Madame de Chantelle placed great reliance on her judgment and\nexperience, and in every domestic crisis the irreducible Adelaide was\nimmediately summoned to Givre.\n\n\"It's all the odder because my mother-in-law, since her second marriage,\nhas lived so much in the country that she's practically lost sight\nof all her other American friends. Besides which, you can see how\ncompletely she has identified herself with Monsieur de Chantelle's\nnationality and adopted French habits and prejudices. Yet when anything\ngoes wrong she always sends for Adelaide Painter, who's more American\nthan the Stars and Stripes, and might have left South Braintree\nyesterday, if she hadn't, rather, brought it over with her in her\ntrunk.\"\n\nDarrow laughed. \"Well, then, if South Braintree vouches for Miss\nViner----\"\n\n\"Oh, but only indirectly. When we had that odious adventure with\nMademoiselle Grumeau, who'd been so highly recommended by Monsieur de\nChantelle's aunt, the Chanoinesse, Adelaide was of course sent for, and\nshe said at once: 'I'm not the least bit surprised. I've always told you\nthat what you wanted for Effie was a sweet American girl, and not one of\nthese nasty foreigners.' Unluckily she couldn't, at the moment, put her\nhand on a sweet American; but she presently heard of Miss Viner through\nthe Farlows, an excellent couple who live in the Quartier Latin and\nwrite about French life for the American papers. I was only too thankful\nto find anyone who was vouched for by decent people; and so far I've had\nno cause to regret my choice. But I know, after all, very little about\nMiss Viner; and there are all kinds of reasons why I want, as soon as\npossible, to find out more--to find out all I can.\"\n\n\"Since you've got to leave Effie I understand your feeling in that way.\nBut is there, in such a case, any recommendation worth half as much as\nyour own direct experience?\"\n\n\"No; and it's been so favourable that I was ready to accept it as\nconclusive. Only, naturally, when I found you'd known her in London I\nwas in hopes you'd give me some more specific reasons for liking her as\nmuch as I do.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can give you nothing more specific than my general vague\nimpression that she seems very plucky and extremely nice.\"\n\n\"You don't, at any rate, know anything specific to the contrary?\"\n\n\"To the contrary? How should I? I'm not conscious of ever having heard\nany one say two words about her. I only infer that she must have pluck\nand character to have stuck it out so long at Mrs. Murrett's.\"\n\n\"Yes, poor thing! She has pluck, certainly; and pride, too; which must\nhave made it all the harder.\" Anna rose to her feet. \"You don't know how\nglad I am that your impression's on the whole so good. I particularly\nwanted you to like her.\"\n\nHe drew her to him with a smile. \"On that condition I'm prepared to love\neven Adelaide Painter.\"\n\n\"I almost hope you wont have the chance to--poor Adelaide! Her\nappearance here always coincides with a catastrophe.\"\n\n\"Oh, then I must manage to meet her elsewhere.\" He held Anna closer,\nsaying to himself, as he smoothed back the hair from her forehead: \"What\ndoes anything matter but just THIS?--Must I go now?\" he added aloud.\n\nShe answered absently: \"It must be time to dress\"; then she drew back a\nlittle and laid her hands on his shoulders. \"My love--oh, my dear love!\"\nshe said.\n\nIt came to him that they were the first words of endearment he had heard\nher speak, and their rareness gave them a magic quality of reassurance,\nas though no danger could strike through such a shield.\n\nA knock on the door made them draw apart. Anna lifted her hand to\nher hair and Darrow stooped to examine a photograph of Effie on the\nwriting-table.\n\n\"Come in!\" Anna said.\n\nThe door opened and Sophy Viner entered. Seeing Darrow, she drew back.\n\n\"Do come in, Miss Viner,\" Anna repeated, looking at her kindly.\n\nThe girl, a quick red in her cheeks, still hesitated on the threshold.\n\n\"I'm so sorry; but Effie has mislaid her Latin grammar, and I thought\nshe might have left it here. I need it to prepare for tomorrow's\nlesson.\"\n\n\"Is this it?\" Darrow asked, picking up a book from the table.\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\"\n\nHe held it out to her and she took it and moved to the door.\n\n\"Wait a minute, please, Miss Viner,\" Anna said; and as the girl turned\nback, she went on with her quiet smile: \"Effie told us you'd gone to\nyour room with a headache. You mustn't sit up over tomorrow's lessons if\nyou don't feel well.\"\n\nSophy's blush deepened. \"But you see I have to. Latin's one of my weak\npoints, and there's generally only one page of this book between me and\nEffie.\" She threw the words off with a half-ironic smile. \"Do excuse my\ndisturbing you,\" she added.\n\n\"You didn't disturb me,\" Anna answered. Darrow perceived that she was\nlooking intently at the girl, as though struck by something tense and\ntremulous in her face, her voice, her whole mien and attitude. \"You DO\nlook tired. You'd much better go straight to bed. Effie won't be sorry\nto skip her Latin.\"\n\n\"Thank you--but I'm really all right,\" murmured Sophy Viner. Her glance,\nmaking a swift circuit of the room, dwelt for an appreciable instant on\nthe intimate propinquity of arm-chair and sofa-corner; then she turned\nback to the door.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nAt dinner that evening Madame de Chantelle's slender monologue was\nthrown out over gulfs of silence. Owen was still in the same state of\nmoody abstraction as when Darrow had left him at the piano; and even\nAnna's face, to her friend's vigilant eye, revealed not, perhaps, a\npersonal preoccupation, but a vague sense of impending disturbance.\n\nShe smiled, she bore a part in the talk, her eyes dwelt on Darrow's with\ntheir usual deep reliance; but beneath the surface of her serenity his\ntense perceptions detected a hidden stir.\n\nHe was sufficiently self-possessed to tell himself that it was doubtless\ndue to causes with which he was not directly concerned. He knew the\nquestion of Owen's marriage was soon to be raised, and the abrupt\nalteration in the young man's mood made it seem probable that he was\nhimself the centre of the atmospheric disturbance, For a moment it\noccurred to Darrow that Anna might have employed her afternoon in\npreparing Madame de Chantelle for her grandson's impending announcement;\nbut a glance at the elder lady's unclouded brow showed that he must seek\nelsewhere the clue to Owen's taciturnity and his step-mother's concern.\nPossibly Anna had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter,\nand had made the change known to Owen. But this, again, was negatived by\nthe fact that, during the afternoon's shooting, young Leath had been in\na mood of almost extravagant expansiveness, and that, from the moment of\nhis late return to the house till just before dinner, there had been,\nto Darrow's certain knowledge, no possibility of a private talk between\nhimself and his step-mother.\n\nThis obscured, if it narrowed, the field of conjecture; and Darrow's\ngropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading\ntoo much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew, and who\nhad been described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour. As to\nAnna's fancied perturbation, it might simply be due to the fact that she\nhad decided to plead Owen's cause the next day, and had perhaps already\nhad a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her. But Darrow knew that he\nwas too deep in his own perplexities to judge the mental state of those\nabout him. It might be, after all, that the variations he felt in the\ncurrents of communication were caused by his own inward tremor.\n\nSuch, at any rate, was the conclusion he had reached when, shortly after\nthe two ladies left the drawing-room, he bade Owen good-night and went\nup to his room. Ever since the rapid self-colloquy which had followed on\nhis first sight of Sophy Viner, he had known there were other questions\nto be faced behind the one immediately confronting him. On the score\nof that one, at least, his mind, if not easy, was relieved. He had\ndone what was possible to reassure the girl, and she had apparently\nrecognized the sincerity of his intention. He had patched up as decent a\nconclusion as he could to an incident that should obviously have had\nno sequel; but he had known all along that with the securing of Miss\nViner's peace of mind only a part of his obligation was discharged, and\nthat with that part his remaining duty was in conflict. It had been his\nfirst business to convince the girl that their secret was safe with\nhim; but it was far from easy to square this with the equally urgent\nobligation of safe-guarding Anna's responsibility toward her child.\nDarrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures. Both he and Sophy\nViner had too much at stake not to be on their guard. The fear that\nbeset him was of another kind, and had a profounder source. He wanted to\ndo all he could for the girl, but the fact of having had to urge Anna\nto confide Effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him. His own ideas\nabout Sophy Viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him not to feel\nthe risk of such an experiment; yet he found himself in the intolerable\nposition of appearing to press it on the woman he desired above all\nothers to protect...\n\nTill late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision.\nHis pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what Sophy Viner had\nbeen to him and what he had thought of her. This discrepancy, which at\nthe time had seemed to simplify the incident, now turned out to be\nits most galling complication. The bare truth, indeed, was that he had\nhardly thought of her at all, either at the time or since, and that he\nwas ashamed to base his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their\nadventure.\n\nThe essential cheapness of the whole affair--as far as his share in it\nwas concerned--came home to him with humiliating distinctness. He would\nhave liked to be able to feel that, at the time at least, he had\nstaked something more on it, and had somehow, in the sequel, had a more\npalpable loss to show. But the plain fact was that he hadn't spent a\npenny on it; which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it\nhad since been rolling up. At any rate, beat about the case as he would,\nit was clear that he owed it to Anna--and incidentally to his own peace\nof mind--to find some way of securing Sophy Viner's future without\nleaving her installed at Givre when he and his wife should depart for\ntheir new post.\n\nThe night brought no aid to the solving of this problem; but it gave\nhim, at any rate, the clear conviction that no time was to be lost. His\nfirst step must be to obtain from Miss Viner the chance of another and\ncalmer talk; and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour.\n\nHe had gathered that Effie's lessons were preceded by an early scamper\nin the park, and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he\nbetook himself the next morning to the terrace, whence he wandered on to\nthe gardens and the walks beyond.\n\nThe atmosphere was still and pale. The muffled sunlight gleamed like\ngold tissue through grey gauze, and the beech alleys tapered away to a\nblue haze blent of sky and forest. It was one of those elusive days\nwhen the familiar forms of things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic\nshimmer.\n\nThe stillness was presently broken by joyful barks, and Darrow, tracking\nthe sound, overtook Effie flying down one of the long alleys at the head\nof her pack. Beyond her he saw Miss Viner seated near the stone-rimmed\nbasin beside which he and Anna had paused on their first walk to the\nriver.\n\nThe girl, coming forward at his approach, returned his greeting almost\ngaily. His first glance showed him that she had regained her composure,\nand the change in her appearance gave him the measure of her fears. For\nthe first time he saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed\nhis eyes in Paris; but he saw it now as in a painted picture.\n\n\"Shall we sit down a minute?\" he asked, as Effie trotted off.\n\nThe girl looked away from him. \"I'm afraid there's not much time; we\nmust be back at lessons at half-past nine.\"\n\n\"But it's barely ten minutes past. Let's at least walk a little way\ntoward the river.\"\n\nShe glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back in the\ndirection of the house. \"If you like,\" she said in a low voice, with one\nof her quick fluctuations of colour; but instead of taking the way he\nproposed she turned toward a narrow path which branched off obliquely\nthrough the trees.\n\nDarrow was struck, and vaguely troubled, by the change in her look\nand tone. There was in them an undefinable appeal, whether for help or\nforbearance he could not tell. Then it occurred to him that there might\nhave been something misleading in his so pointedly seeking her, and he\nfelt a momentary constraint. To ease it he made an abrupt dash at the\ntruth.\n\n\"I came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so\nunsatisfactory. I want to hear more about you--about your plans and\nprospects. I've been wondering ever since why you've so completely given\nup the theatre.\"\n\nHer face instantly sharpened to distrust. \"I had to live,\" she said in\nan off-hand tone.\n\n\"I understand perfectly that you should like it here--for a time.\"\nHis glance strayed down the gold-roofed windings ahead of them. \"It's\ndelightful: you couldn't be better placed. Only I wonder a little at\nyour having so completely given up any idea of a different future.\"\n\nShe waited for a moment before answering: \"I suppose I'm less restless\nthan I used to be.\"\n\n\"It's certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at\nMrs. Murrett's; yet somehow I don't seem to see you permanently given up\nto forming the young.\"\n\n\"What--exactly--DO you seem to see me permanently given up to? You know\nyou warned me rather emphatically against the theatre.\" She threw\noff the statement without impatience, as though they were discussing\ntogether the fate of a third person in whom both were benevolently\ninterested. Darrow considered his reply. \"If I did, it was because you\nso emphatically refused to let me help you to a start.\"\n\nShe stopped short and faced him \"And you think I may let you now?\"\n\nDarrow felt the blood in his cheek. He could not understand her\nattitude--if indeed she had consciously taken one, and her changes of\ntone did not merely reflect the involuntary alternations of her mood. It\nhumbled him to perceive once more how little he had to guide him in his\njudgment of her. He said to himself: \"If I'd ever cared a straw for\nher I should know how to avoid hurting her now\"--and his insensibility\nstruck him as no better than a vulgar obtuseness. But he had a fixed\npurpose ahead and could only push on to it.\n\n\"I hope, at any rate, you'll listen to my reasons. There's been time,\non both sides, to think them over since----\" He caught himself back\nand hung helpless on the \"since\": whatever words he chose, he seemed to\nstumble among reminders of their past.\n\nShe walked on beside him, her eyes on the ground. \"Then I'm to\nunderstand--definitely--that you DO renew your offer?\" she asked\n\n\"With all my heart! If you'll only let me----\"\n\nShe raised a hand, as though to check him. \"It's extremely friendly of\nyou--I DO believe you mean it as a friend--but I don't quite understand\nwhy, finding me, as you say, so well placed here, you should show more\nanxiety about my future than at a time when I was actually, and rather\ndesperately, adrift.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not more!\"\n\n\"If you show any at all, it must, at any rate, be for different\nreasons.--In fact, it can only be,\" she went on, with one of her\ndisconcerting flashes of astuteness, \"for one of two reasons; either\nbecause you feel you ought to help me, or because, for some reason, you\nthink you owe it to Mrs. Leath to let her know what you know of me.\"\n\nDarrow stood still in the path. Behind him he heard Effie's call, and at\nthe child's voice he saw Sophy turn her head with the alertness of one\nwho is obscurely on the watch. The look was so fugitive that he could\nnot have said wherein it differed from her normal professional air of\nhaving her pupil on her mind.\n\nEffie sprang past them, and Darrow took up the girl's challenge.\n\n\"What you suggest about Mrs. Leath is hardly worth answering. As to my\nreasons for wanting to help you, a good deal depends on the words one\nuses to define rather indefinite things. It's true enough that I want to\nhelp you; but the wish isn't due to...to any past kindness on your part,\nbut simply to my own interest in you. Why not put it that our friendship\ngives me the right to intervene for what I believe to be your benefit?\"\n\nShe took a few hesitating steps and then paused again. Darrow noticed\nthat she had grown pale and that there were rings of shade about her\neyes.\n\n\"You've known Mrs. Leath a long time?\" she asked him suddenly.\n\nHe paused with a sense of approaching peril. \"A long time--yes.\"\n\n\"She told me you were friends--great friends\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted, \"we're great friends.\"\n\n\"Then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that\nyou don't think I'm the right person for Effie.\" He uttered a sound of\nprotest, but she disregarded it. \"I don't say you'd LIKE to do it. You\nwouldn't: you'd hate it. And the natural alternative would be to try\nto persuade me that I'd be better off somewhere else than here. But\nsupposing that failed, and you saw I was determined to stay? THEN you\nmight think it your duty to tell Mrs. Leath.\"\n\nShe laid the case before him with a cold lucidity. \"I should, in your\nplace, I believe,\" she ended with a little laugh.\n\n\"I shouldn't feel justified in telling her, behind your back, if\nI thought you unsuited for the place; but I should certainly feel\njustified,\" he rejoined after a pause, \"in telling YOU if I thought the\nplace unsuited to you.\"\n\n\"And that's what you're trying to tell me now?\"\n\n\"Yes; but not for the reasons you imagine.\"\n\n\"What, then, are your reasons, if you please?\"\n\n\"I've already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea\nof the theatre. You're too various, too gifted, too personal, to tie\nyourself down, at your age, to the dismal drudgery of teaching.\"\n\n\"And is THAT what you've told Mrs. Leath?\"\n\nShe rushed the question out at him as if she expected to trip him up\nover it. He was moved by the simplicity of the stratagem.\n\n\"I've told her exactly nothing,\" he replied.\n\n\"And what--exactly--do you mean by 'nothing'? You and she were talking\nabout me when I came into her sitting-room yesterday.\"\n\nDarrow felt his blood rise at the thrust.\n\n\"I've told her, simply, that I'd seen you once or twice at Mrs.\nMurrett's.\"\n\n\"And not that you've ever seen me since?\"\n\n\"And not that I've ever seen you since...\"\n\n\"And she believes you--she completely believes you?\"\n\nHe uttered a protesting exclamation, and his flush reflected itself in\nthe girl's cheek.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon! I didn't mean to ask you that.\" She halted, and\nagain cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of her. Then she held out her\nhand. \"Well, then, thank you--and let me relieve your fears. I sha'n't\nbe Effie's governess much longer.\"\n\nAt the announcement, Darrow tried to merge his look of relief into the\nexpression of friendly interest with which he grasped her hand. \"You\nreally do agree with me, then? And you'll give me a chance to talk\nthings over with you?\"\n\nShe shook her head with a faint smile. \"I'm not thinking of the stage.\nI've had another offer: that's all.\"\n\nThe relief was hardly less great. After all, his personal responsibility\nceased with her departure from Givre.\n\n\"You'll tell me about that, then--won't you?\"\n\nHer smile flickered up. \"Oh, you'll hear about it soon...I must catch\nEffie now and drag her back to the blackboard.\"\n\nShe walked on for a few yards, and then paused again and confronted him.\n\"I've been odious to you--and not quite honest,\" she broke out suddenly.\n\n\"Not quite honest?\" he repeated, caught in a fresh wave of wonder.\n\n\"I mean, in seeming not to trust you. It's come over me again as we\ntalked that, at heart, I've always KNOWN I could...\"\n\nHer colour rose in a bright wave, and her eyes clung to his for a swift\ninstant of reminder and appeal. For the same space of time the past\nsurged up in him confusedly; then a veil dropped between them.\n\n\"Here's Effie now!\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them, her hand in\nOwen Leath's. Even through the stir of his subsiding excitement Darrow\nwas at once aware of the change effected by the young man's approach.\nFor a moment Sophy Viner's cheeks burned redder; then they faded to\nthe paleness of white petals. She lost, however, nothing of the bright\nbravery which it was her way to turn on the unexpected. Perhaps no one\nless familiar with her face than Darrow would have discerned the\ntension of the smile she transferred from himself to Owen Leath, or\nhave remarked that her eyes had hardened from misty grey to a shining\ndarkness. But her observer was less struck by this than by the\ncorresponding change in Owen Leath. The latter, when he came in sight,\nhad been laughing and talking unconcernedly with Effie; but as his eye\nfell on Miss Viner his expression altered as suddenly as hers.\n\nThe change, for Darrow, was less definable; but, perhaps for that\nreason, it struck him as more sharply significant. Only--just what did\nit signify? Owen, like Sophy Viner, had the kind of face which seems\nless the stage on which emotions move than the very stuff they work\nin. In moments of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow\nfluid, to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a\nstream. Darrow, through the rapid flight of the shadows, could not seize\non any specific indication of feeling: he merely perceived that the\nyoung man was unaccountably surprised at finding him with Miss\nViner, and that the extent of his surprise might cover all manner of\nimplications.\n\nDarrow's first idea was that Owen, if he suspected that the conversation\nwas not the result of an accidental encounter, might wonder at his\nstep-mother's suitor being engaged, at such an hour, in private talk\nwith her little girl's governess. The thought was so disturbing that,\nas the three turned back to the house, he was on the point of saying to\nOwen: \"I came out to look for your mother.\" But, in the contingency he\nfeared, even so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at\nexplanation; and he walked on in silence at Miss Viner's side. Presently\nhe was struck by the fact that Owen Leath and the girl were silent also;\nand this gave a new turn to his thoughts. Silence may be as variously\nshaded as speech; and that which enfolded Darrow and his two companions\nseemed to his watchful perceptions to be quivering with cross-threads of\ncommunication. At first he was aware only of those that centred in\nhis own troubled consciousness; then it occurred to him that an equal\nactivity of intercourse was going on outside of it. Something was in\nfact passing mutely and rapidly between young Leath and Sophy Viner; but\nwhat it was, and whither it tended, Darrow, when they reached the house,\nwas but just beginning to divine...\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nAnna Leath, from the terrace, watched the return of the little group.\n\nShe looked down on them, as they advanced across the garden, from the\nserene height of her unassailable happiness. There they were, coming\ntoward her in the mild morning light, her child, her step-son, her\npromised husband: the three beings who filled her life. She smiled a\nlittle at the happy picture they presented, Effie's gambols encircling\nit in a moving frame within which the two men came slowly forward in the\nsilence of friendly understanding. It seemed part of the deep intimacy\nof the scene that they should not be talking to each other, and it did\nnot till afterward strike her as odd that neither of them apparently\nfelt it necessary to address a word to Sophy Viner.\n\nAnna herself, at the moment, was floating in the mid-current of\nfelicity, on a tide so bright and buoyant that she seemed to be one with\nits warm waves. The first rush of bliss had stunned and dazzled her;\nbut now that, each morning, she woke to the calm certainty of its\nrecurrence, she was growing used to the sense of security it gave.\n\n\"I feel as if I could trust my happiness to carry me; as if it had grown\nout of me like wings.\" So she phrased it to Darrow, as, later in the\nmorning, they paced the garden-paths together. His answering look gave\nher the same assurance of safety. The evening before he had seemed\npreoccupied, and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the\ngreat golden orb of their blessedness; but now it was uneclipsed again,\nand hung above them high and bright as the sun at noon.\n\nUpstairs in her sitting-room, that afternoon, she was thinking of\nthese things. The morning mists had turned to rain, compelling the\npostponement of an excursion in which the whole party were to have\njoined. Effie, with her governess, had been despatched in the motor to\ndo some shopping at Francheuil; and Anna had promised Darrow to join\nhim, later in the afternoon, for a quick walk in the rain.\n\nHe had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off\nhis conscience; and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the\nsame place, her hands crossed on her knees, her head slightly bent, in\nan attitude of brooding retrospection. As she looked back at her past\nlife, it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack\ninto each hour enough to fill out its slack folds; but now each moment\nwas like a miser's bag stretched to bursting with pure gold.\n\nShe was roused by the sound of Owen's step in the gallery outside her\nroom. It paused at her door and in answer to his knock she called out\n\"Come in!\"\n\nAs the door closed behind him she was struck by his look of pale\nexcitement, and an impulse of compunction made her say: \"You've come to\nask me why I haven't spoken to your grandmother!\" He sent about him a\nglance vaguely reminding her of the strange look with which Sophy Viner\nhad swept the room the night before; then his brilliant eyes came back\nto her.\n\n\"I've spoken to her myself,\" he said.\n\nAnna started up, incredulous.\n\n\"You've spoken to her? When?\"\n\n\"Just now. I left her to come here.\"\n\nAnna's first feeling was one of annoyance. There was really something\ncomically incongruous in this boyish surrender to impulse on the part of\na young man so eager to assume the responsibilities of life. She looked\nat him with a faintly veiled amusement.\n\n\"You asked me to help you and I promised you I would. It was hardly\nworth while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended\nto take the matter out of my hands without telling me.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't take that tone with me!\" he broke out, almost angrily.\n\n\"That tone? What tone?\" She stared at his quivering face. \"I might,\" she\npursued, still half-laughing, \"more properly make that request of YOU!\"\n\nOwen reddened and his vehemence suddenly subsided.\n\n\"I meant that I HAD to speak--that's all. You don't give me a chance to\nexplain...\"\n\nShe looked at him gently, wondering a little at her own impatience.\n\n\"Owen! Don't I always want to give you every chance? It's because I DO\nthat I wanted to talk to your grandmother first--that I was waiting and\nwatching for the right moment...\"\n\n\"The right moment? So was I. That's why I've spoken.\" His voice rose\nagain and took the sharp edge it had in moments of high pressure.\n\nHis step-mother turned away and seated herself in her sofa-corner. \"Oh,\nmy dear, it's not a privilege to quarrel over! You've taken a load off\nmy shoulders. Sit down and tell me all about it.\"\n\nHe stood before her, irresolute. \"I can't sit down,\" he said.\n\n\"Walk about, then. Only tell me: I'm impatient.\"\n\nHis immediate response was to throw himself into the armchair at her\nside, where he lounged for a moment without speaking, his legs stretched\nout, his arms locked behind his thrown-back head. Anna, her eyes on his\nface, waited quietly for him to speak.\n\n\"Well--of course it was just what one expected.\"\n\n\"She takes it so badly, you mean?\"\n\n\"All the heavy batteries were brought up: my father, Givre, Monsieur de\nChantelle, the throne and the altar. Even my poor mother was dragged out\nof oblivion and armed with imaginary protests.\"\n\nAnna sighed out her sympathy. \"Well--you were prepared for all that?\"\n\n\"I thought I was, till I began to hear her say it. Then it sounded so\nincredibly silly that I told her so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Owen--Owen!\"\n\n\"Yes: I know. I was a fool; but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"And you've mortally offended her, I suppose? That's exactly what I\nwanted to prevent.\" She laid a hand on his shoulder. \"You tiresome boy,\nnot to wait and let me speak for you!\"\n\nHe moved slightly away, so that her hand slipped from its place. \"You\ndon't understand,\" he said, frowning.\n\n\"I don't see how I can, till you explain. If you thought the time had\ncome to tell your grandmother, why not have asked me to do it? I had my\nreasons for waiting; but if you'd told me to speak I should have done\nso, naturally.\"\n\nHe evaded her appeal by a sudden turn. \"What WERE your reasons for\nwaiting?\"\n\nAnna did not immediately answer. Her step-son's eyes were on her face,\nand under his gaze she felt a faint disquietude.\n\n\"I was feeling my way...I wanted to be absolutely sure...\"\n\n\"Absolutely sure of what?\"\n\nShe delayed again for a just perceptible instant. \"Why, simply of OUR\nside of the case.\"\n\n\"But you told me you were, the other day, when we talked it over before\nthey came back from Ouchy.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear--if you think that, in such a complicated matter, every\nday, every hour, doesn't more or less modify one's surest sureness!\"\n\n\"That's just what I'm driving at. I want to know what has modified\nyours.\"\n\nShe made a slight gesture of impatience. \"What does it matter, now the\nthing's done? I don't know that I could give any clear reason...\"\n\nHe got to his feet and stood looking down on her with a tormented brow.\n\"But it's absolutely necessary that you should.\"\n\nAt his tone her impatience flared up. \"It's not necessary that I should\ngive you any explanation whatever, since you've taken the matter out of\nmy hands. All I can say is that I was trying to help you: that no other\nthought ever entered my mind.\" She paused a moment and then added: \"If\nyou doubted it, you were right to do what you've done.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never doubted YOU!\" he retorted, with a fugitive stress on\nthe pronoun. His face had cleared to its old look of trust. \"Don't be\noffended if I've seemed to,\" he went on. \"I can't quite explain myself,\neither...it's all a kind of tangle, isn't it? That's why I thought I'd\nbetter speak at once; or rather why I didn't think at all, but just\nsuddenly blurted the thing out----\"\n\nAnna gave him back his look of conciliation. \"Well, the how and why\ndon't much matter now. The point is how to deal with your grandmother.\nYou've not told me what she means to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, she means to send for Adelaide Painter.\"\n\nThe name drew a faint note of mirth from him and relaxed both their\nfaces to a smile.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Anna added, \"it's really the best thing for us all.\"\n\nOwen shrugged his shoulders. \"It's too preposterous and humiliating.\nDragging that woman into our secrets----!\"\n\n\"This could hardly be a secret much longer.\"\n\nHe had moved to the hearth, where he stood pushing about the small\nornaments on the mantel-shelf; but at her answer he turned back to her.\n\n\"You haven't, of course, spoken of it to any one?\"\n\n\"No; but I intend to now.\"\n\nShe paused for his reply, and as it did not come she continued: \"If\nAdelaide Painter's to be told there's no possible reason why I shouldn't\ntell Mr. Darrow.\" Owen abruptly set down the little statuette between\nhis fingers. \"None whatever: I want every one to know.\"\n\nShe smiled a little at his over-emphasis, and was about to meet it with\na word of banter when he continued, facing her: \"You haven't, as yet,\nsaid a word to him?\"\n\n\"I've told him nothing, except what the discussion of our own plans--his\nand mine--obliged me to: that you were thinking of marrying, and that\nI wasn't willing to leave France till I'd done what I could to see you\nthrough.\"\n\nAt her first words the colour had rushed to his forehead; but as she\ncontinued she saw his face compose itself and his blood subside.\n\n\"You're a brick, my dear!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You had my word, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes; yes--I know.\" His face had clouded again. \"And that's\nall--positively all--you've ever said to him?\"\n\n\"Positively all. But why do you ask?\"\n\nHe had a moment's embarrassed hesitation. \"It was understood, wasn't it,\nthat my grandmother was to be the first to know?\"\n\n\"Well--and so she has been, hasn't she, since you've told her?\"\n\nHe turned back to his restless shifting of the knick-knacks.\n\n\"And you're sure that nothing you've said to Darrow could possibly have\ngiven him a hint----?\"\n\n\"Nothing I've said to him--certainly.\"\n\nHe swung about on her. \"Why do you put it in that way?\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Why--as if you thought some one else might have spoken...\"\n\n\"Some one else? Who else?\" She rose to her feet. \"What on earth, my dear\nboy, can you be driving at?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite.\"\n\n\"Why should I think so? Do YOU?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I want to find out.\"\n\nShe laughed at his obstinate insistence. \"To test my veracity, I\nsuppose?\" At the sound of a step in the gallery she added: \"Here he\nis--you can ask him yourself.\"\n\nShe met Darrow's knock with an invitation to enter, and he came into the\nroom and paused between herself and Owen. She was struck, as he stood\nthere, by the contrast between his happy careless good-looks and her\nstep-son's frowning agitation.\n\nDarrow met her eyes with a smile. \"Am I too soon? Or is our walk given\nup?\"\n\n\"No; I was just going to get ready.\" She continued to linger between\nthe two, looking slowly from one to the other. \"But there's something we\nwant to tell you first: Owen is engaged to Miss Viner.\"\n\nThe sense of an indefinable interrogation in Owen's mind made her, as\nshe spoke, fix her eyes steadily on Darrow.\n\nHe had paused just opposite the window, so that, even in the rainy\nafternoon light, his face was clearly open to her scrutiny. For a\nsecond, immense surprise was alone visible on it: so visible that\nshe half turned to her step-son, with a faint smile for his refuted\nsuspicions. Why, she wondered, should Owen have thought that Darrow had\nalready guessed his secret, and what, after all, could be so disturbing\nto him in this not improbable contingency? At any rate, his doubt\nmust have been dispelled: there was nothing feigned about Darrow's\nastonishment. When her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing\nto Owen with outstretched hand, and she had, through an unaccountable\nfaint flutter of misgiving, a mere confused sense of their exchanging\nthe customary phrases. Her next perception was of Owen's tranquillized\nlook, and of his smiling return of Darrow's congratulatory grasp. She\nhad the eerie feeling of having been overswept by a shadow which there\nhad been no cloud to cast...\n\nA moment later Owen had left the room and she and Darrow were alone. He\nhad turned away to the window and stood staring out into the down-pour.\n\n\"You're surprised at Owen's news?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes: I am surprised,\" he answered.\n\n\"You hadn't thought of its being Miss Viner?\"\n\n\"Why should I have thought of Miss Viner?\"\n\n\"You see now why I wanted so much to find out what you knew about her.\"\nHe made no comment, and she pursued: \"Now that you DO know it's she, if\nthere's anything----\"\n\nHe moved back into the room and went up to her. His face was serious,\nwith a slight shade of annoyance. \"What on earth should there be? As I\ntold you, I've never in my life heard any one say two words about Miss\nViner.\"\n\nAnna made no answer and they continued to face each other without\nmoving. For the moment she had ceased to think about Sophy Viner and\nOwen: the only thought in her mind was that Darrow was alone with her,\nclose to her, and that, for the first time, their hands and lips had not\nmet.\n\nHe glanced back doubtfully at the window. \"It's pouring. Perhaps you'd\nrather not go out?\"\n\nShe hesitated, as if waiting for him to urge her. \"I suppose I'd better\nnot. I ought to go at once to my mother-in-law--Owen's just been telling\nher,\" she said.\n\n\"Ah.\" Darrow hazarded a smile. \"That accounts for my having, on my way\nup, heard some one telephoning for Miss Painter!\"\n\nAt the allusion they laughed together, vaguely, and Anna moved toward\nthe door. He held it open for her and followed her out.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nHe left her at the door of Madame de Chantelle's sitting-room, and\nplunged out alone into the rain.\n\nThe wind flung about the stripped tree-tops of the avenue and dashed the\nstinging streams into his face. He walked to the gate and then turned\ninto the high-road and strode along in the open, buffeted by slanting\ngusts. The evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud, and\nthe russet coverts which he and Owen had shot through the day before\nshivered desolately against a driving sky.\n\nDarrow walked on and on, indifferent to the direction he was taking. His\nthoughts were tossing like the tree-tops. Anna's announcement had not\ncome to him as a complete surprise: that morning, as he strolled back\nto the house with Owen Leath and Miss Viner, he had had a momentary\nintuition of the truth. But it had been no more than an intuition, the\nmerest faint cloud-puff of surmise; and now it was an attested fact,\ndarkening over the whole sky.\n\nIn respect of his own attitude, he saw at once that the discovery made\nno appreciable change. If he had been bound to silence before, he was no\nless bound to it now; the only difference lay in the fact that what he\nhad just learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable. Hitherto\nhe had felt for Sophy Viner's defenseless state a sympathy profoundly\ntinged with compunction. But now he was half-conscious of an obscure\nindignation against her. Superior as he had fancied himself to\nready-made judgments, he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to\nthe disinterestedness of the woman who tries to rise above her past. No\nwonder she had been sick with fear on meeting him! It was in his power\nto do her more harm than he had dreamed...\n\nAssuredly he did not want to harm her; but he did desperately want to\nprevent her marrying Owen Leath. He tried to get away from the feeling,\nto isolate and exteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it\nwas made of; but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood, the\ninstinctive recoil from the thing that no amount of arguing can make\n\"straight.\" His tramp, prolonged as it was, carried him no nearer\nto enlightenment; and after trudging through two or three sallow\nmud-stained villages he turned about and wearily made his way back to\nGivre. As he walked up the black avenue, making for the lights that\ntwinkled through its pitching branches, he had a sudden realisation\nof his utter helplessness. He might think and combine as he would; but\nthere was nothing, absolutely nothing, that he could do...\n\nHe dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mount the stairs\nto his room. But on the landing he was overtaken by a sober-faced maid\nwho, in tones discreetly lowered, begged him to be so kind as to step,\nfor a moment, into the Marquise's sitting-room. Somewhat disconcerted\nby the summons, he followed its bearer to the door at which, a couple of\nhours earlier, he had taken leave of Mrs. Leath. It opened to admit him\nto a large lamp-lit room which he immediately perceived to be empty; and\nthe fact gave him time to note, even through his disturbance of mind,\nthe interesting degree to which Madame de Chantelle's apartment \"dated\"\nand completed her. Its looped and corded curtains, its purple satin\nupholstery, the Sevres jardinieres, the rosewood fire-screen, the little\nvelvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knick-knacks and\nsimpering miniatures, reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the\nblonde beauty of the 'sixties. Darrow wondered that Fraser Leath's\nfilial respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the\nextent of permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century\ngraces of Givre; but a moment's reflection made it clear that, to its\nlate owner, the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of\nthe place.\n\nMadame de Chantelle's emergence from an inner room snatched Darrow from\nthese irrelevant musings. She was already beaded and bugled for the\nevening, and, save for a slight pinkness of the eye-lids, her elaborate\nappearance revealed no mark of agitation; but Darrow noticed that,\nin recognition of the solemnity of the occasion, she pinched a lace\nhandkerchief between her thumb and forefinger.\n\nShe plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty, appealing to him,\nin the name of all the Everards, to descend there with her to the rescue\nof her darling. She wasn't, she was sure, addressing herself in vain to\none whose person, whose \"tone,\" whose traditions so brilliantly declared\nhis indebtedness to the principles she besought him to defend. Her own\nreception of Darrow, the confidence she had at once accorded him,\nmust have shown him that she had instinctively felt their unanimity of\nsentiment on these fundamental questions. She had in fact recognized in\nhim the one person whom, without pain to her maternal piety, she could\nwelcome as her son's successor; and it was almost as to Owen's father\nthat she now appealed to Darrow to aid in rescuing the wretched boy.\n\n\"Don't think, please, that I'm casting the least reflection on Anna,\nor showing any want of sympathy for her, when I say that I consider\nher partly responsible for what's happened. Anna is 'modern'--I believe\nthat's what it's called when you read unsettling books and admire\nhideous pictures. Indeed,\" Madame de Chantelle continued, leaning\nconfidentially forward, \"I myself have always more or less lived in that\natmosphere: my son, you know, was very revolutionary. Only he didn't, of\ncourse, apply his ideas: they were purely intellectual. That's what dear\nAnna has always failed to understand. And I'm afraid she's created the\nsame kind of confusion in Owen's mind--led him to mix up things you read\nabout with things you do...You know, of course, that she sides with him\nin this wretched business?\"\n\nDeveloping at length upon this theme, she finally narrowed down to\nthe point of Darrow's intervention. \"My grandson, Mr. Darrow, calls me\nillogical and uncharitable because my feelings toward Miss Viner have\nchanged since I've heard this news. Well! You've known her, it appears,\nfor some years: Anna tells me you used to see her when she was a\ncompanion, or secretary or something, to a dreadfully vulgar Mrs.\nMurrett. And I ask you as a friend, I ask you as one of US, to tell me\nif you think a girl who has had to knock about the world in that kind\nof position, and at the orders of all kinds of people, is fitted to be\nOwen's wife I'm not implying anything against her! I LIKED the girl, Mr.\nDarrow...But what's that got to do with it? I don't want her to marry\nmy grandson. If I'd been looking for a wife for Owen, I shouldn't\nhave applied to the Farlows to find me one. That's what Anna won't\nunderstand; and what you must help me to make her see.\"\n\nDarrow, to this appeal, could oppose only the repeated assurance of his\ninability to interfere. He tried to make Madame de Chantelle see\nthat the very position he hoped to take in the household made his\nintervention the more hazardous. He brought up the usual arguments, and\nsounded the expected note of sympathy; but Madame de Chantelle's alarm\nhad dispelled her habitual imprecision, and, though she had not many\nreasons to advance, her argument clung to its point like a frightened\nsharp-clawed animal.\n\n\"Well, then,\" she summed up, in response to his repeated assertions that\nhe saw no way of helping her, \"you can, at least, even if you won't\nsay a word to the others, tell me frankly and fairly--and quite between\nourselves--your personal opinion of Miss Viner, since you've known her\nso much longer than we have.\"\n\nHe protested that, if he had known her longer, he had known her much\nless well, and that he had already, on this point, convinced Anna of his\ninability to pronounce an opinion.\n\nMadame de Chantelle drew a deep sigh of intelligence. \"Your opinion of\nMrs. Murrett is enough! I don't suppose you pretend to conceal THAT? And\nheaven knows what other unspeakable people she's been mixed up with. The\nonly friends she can produce are called Hoke...Don't try to reason with\nme, Mr. Darrow. There are feelings that go deeper than facts...And\nI KNOW she thought of studying for the stage...\" Madame de Chantelle\nraised the corner of her lace handkerchief to her eyes. \"I'm\nold-fashioned--like my furniture,\" she murmured. \"And I thought I could\ncount on you, Mr. Darrow...\"\n\n\nWhen Darrow, that night, regained his room, he reflected with a flash\nof irony that each time he entered it he brought a fresh troop of\nperplexities to trouble its serene seclusion. Since the day after his\narrival, only forty-eight hours before, when he had set his window\nopen to the night, and his hopes had seemed as many as its stars,\neach evening had brought its new problem and its renewed distress. But\nnothing, as yet, had approached the blank misery of mind with which he\nnow set himself to face the fresh questions confronting him.\n\nSophy Viner had not shown herself at dinner, so that he had had no\nglimpse of her in her new character, and no means of divining the real\nnature of the tie between herself and Owen Leath. One thing, however,\nwas clear: whatever her real feelings were, and however much or little\nshe had at stake, if she had made up her mind to marry Owen she had more\nthan enough skill and tenacity to defeat any arts that poor Madame de\nChantelle could oppose to her.\n\nDarrow himself was in fact the only person who might possibly turn her\nfrom her purpose: Madame de Chantelle, at haphazard, had hit on the\nsurest means of saving Owen--if to prevent his marriage were to save\nhim! Darrow, on this point, did not pretend to any fixed opinion; one\nfeeling alone was clear and insistent in him: he did not mean, if he\ncould help it, to let the marriage take place.\n\nHow he was to prevent it he did not know: to his tormented imagination\nevery issue seemed closed. For a fantastic instant he was moved to\nfollow Madame de Chantelle's suggestion and urge Anna to withdraw her\napproval. If his reticence, his efforts to avoid the subject, had not\nescaped her, she had doubtless set them down to the fact of his knowing\nmore, and thinking less, of Sophy Viner than he had been willing to\nadmit; and he might take advantage of this to turn her mind gradually\nfrom the project. Yet how do so without betraying his insincerity? If\nhe had had nothing to hide he could easily have said: \"It's one thing to\nknow nothing against the girl, it's another to pretend that I think her\na good match for Owen.\" But could he say even so much without betraying\nmore? It was not Anna's questions, or his answers to them, that he\nfeared, but what might cry aloud in the intervals between them. He\nunderstood now that ever since Sophy Viner's arrival at Givre he had\nfelt in Anna the lurking sense of something unexpressed, and perhaps\ninexpressible, between the girl and himself...When at last he fell\nasleep he had fatalistically committed his next step to the chances of\nthe morrow.\n\nThe first that offered itself was an encounter with Mrs. Leath as he\ndescended the stairs the next morning. She had come down already hatted\nand shod for a dash to the park lodge, where one of the gatekeeper's\nchildren had had an accident. In her compact dark dress she looked more\nthan usually straight and slim, and her face wore the pale glow it took\non at any call on her energy: a kind of warrior brightness that made her\nsmall head, with its strong chin and close-bound hair, like that of an\namazon in a frieze.\n\nIt was their first moment alone since she had left him, the afternoon\nbefore, at her mother-in-law's door; and after a few words about the\ninjured child their talk inevitably reverted to Owen.\n\nAnna spoke with a smile of her \"scene\" with Madame de Chantelle, who\nbelonged, poor dear, to a generation when \"scenes\" (in the ladylike\nand lachrymal sense of the term) were the tribute which sensibility was\nexpected to pay to the unusual. Their conversation had been, in every\ndetail, so exactly what Anna had foreseen that it had clearly not made\nmuch impression on her; but she was eager to know the result of Darrow's\nencounter with her mother-in-law.\n\n\"She told me she'd sent for you: she always 'sends for' people in\nemergencies. That again, I suppose, is de l'epoque. And failing Adelaide\nPainter, who can't get here till this afternoon, there was no one but\npoor you to turn to.\"\n\nShe put it all lightly, with a lightness that seemed to his tight-strung\nnerves slightly, undefinably over-done. But he was so aware of his own\ntension that he wondered, the next moment, whether anything would ever\nagain seem to him quite usual and insignificant and in the common order\nof things.\n\nAs they hastened on through the drizzle in which the storm of the night\nwas weeping itself out, Anna drew close under his umbrella, and at the\npressure of her arm against his he recalled his walk up the Dover\npier with Sophy Viner. The memory gave him a startled vision of the\ninevitable occasions of contact, confidence, familiarity, which his\nfuture relationship to the girl would entail, and the countless chances\nof betrayal that every one of them involved.\n\n\"Do tell me just what you said,\" he heard Anna pleading; and with sudden\nresolution he affirmed: \"I quite understand your mother-in-law's feeling\nas she does.\"\n\nThe words, when uttered, seemed a good deal less significant than they\nhad sounded to his inner ear; and Anna replied without surprise: \"Of\ncourse. It's inevitable that she should. But we shall bring her round\nin time.\" Under the dripping dome she raised her face to his. \"Don't you\nremember what you said the day before yesterday? 'Together we can't\nfail to pull it off for him!' I've told Owen that, so you're pledged and\nthere's no going back.\"\n\nThe day before yesterday! Was it possible that, no longer ago, life\nhad seemed a sufficiently simple business for a sane man to hazard such\nassurances?\n\n\"Anna,\" he questioned her abruptly, \"why are you so anxious for this\nmarriage?\"\n\nShe stopped short to face him. \"Why? But surely I've explained to\nyou--or rather I've hardly had to, you seemed so in sympathy with my\nreasons!\"\n\n\"I didn't know, then, who it was that Owen wanted to marry.\"\n\nThe words were out with a spring and he felt a clearer air in his brain.\nBut her logic hemmed him in.\n\n\"You knew yesterday; and you assured me then that you hadn't a word to\nsay----\"\n\n\"Against Miss Viner?\" The name, once uttered, sounded on and on in his\nears. \"Of course not. But that doesn't necessarily imply that I think\nher a good match for Owen.\"\n\nAnna made no immediate answer. When she spoke it was to question: \"Why\ndon't you think her a good match for Owen?\"\n\n\"Well--Madame de Chantelle's reasons seem to me not quite as negligible\nas you think.\"\n\n\"You mean the fact that she's been Mrs. Murrett's secretary, and that\nthe people who employed her before were called Hoke? For, as far as Owen\nand I can make out, these are the gravest charges against her.\"\n\n\"Still, one can understand that the match is not what Madame de\nChantelle had dreamed of.\"\n\n\"Oh, perfectly--if that's all you mean.\" The lodge was in sight, and she\nhastened her step. He strode on beside her in silence, but at the gate\nshe checked him with the question: \"Is it really all you mean?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he heard himself declare.\n\n\"Oh, then I think I shall convince you--even if I can't, like Madame\nde Chantelle, summon all the Everards to my aid!\" She lifted to him\nthe look of happy laughter that sometimes brushed her with a gleam of\nspring.\n\nDarrow watched her hasten along the path between the dripping\nchrysanthemums and enter the lodge. After she had gone in he paced up\nand down outside in the drizzle, waiting to learn if she had any message\nto send back to the house; and after the lapse of a few minutes she came\nout again.\n\nThe child, she said, was badly, though not dangerously, hurt, and the\nvillage doctor, who was already on hand, had asked that the surgeon,\nalready summoned from Francheuil, should be told to bring with him\ncertain needful appliances. Owen had started by motor to fetch the\nsurgeon, but there was still time to communicate with the latter by\ntelephone. The doctor furthermore begged for an immediate provision of\nsuch bandages and disinfectants as Givre itself could furnish, and Anna\nbade Darrow address himself to Miss Viner, who would know where to find\nthe necessary things, and would direct one of the servants to bicycle\nwith them to the lodge.\n\nDarrow, as he hurried off on this errand, had at once perceived the\nopportunity it offered of a word with Sophy Viner. What that word was to\nbe he did not know; but now, if ever, was the moment to make it urgent\nand conclusive. It was unlikely that he would again have such a chance\nof unobserved talk with her.\n\nHe had supposed he should find her with her pupil in the school-room;\nbut he learned from a servant that Effie had gone to Francheuil with her\nstep-brother, and that Miss Viner was still in her room. Darrow sent her\nword that he was the bearer of a message from the lodge, and a moment\nlater he heard her coming down the stairs.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nFor a second, as she approached him, the quick tremor of her glance\nshowed her all intent on the same thought as himself. He transmitted\nhis instructions with mechanical precision, and she answered in the same\ntone, repeating his words with the intensity of attention of a child not\nquite sure of understanding. Then she disappeared up the stairs.\n\nDarrow lingered on in the hall, not knowing if she meant to return, yet\ninwardly sure she would. At length he saw her coming down in her hat and\njacket. The rain still streaked the window panes, and, in order to say\nsomething, he said: \"You're not going to the lodge yourself?\"\n\n\"I've sent one of the men ahead with the things; but I thought Mrs.\nLeath might need me.\"\n\n\"She didn't ask for you,\" he returned, wondering how he could detain\nher; but she answered decidedly: \"I'd better go.\"\n\nHe held open the door, picked up his umbrella and followed her out. As\nthey went down the steps she glanced back at him. \"You've forgotten your\nmackintosh.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't need it.\"\n\nShe had no umbrella, and he opened his and held it out to her. She\nrejected it with a murmur of thanks and walked on through the thin\ndrizzle, and he kept the umbrella over his own head, without offering to\nshelter her.\n\nRapidly and in silence they crossed the court and began to walk down\nthe avenue. They had traversed a third of its length before Darrow\nsaid abruptly: \"Wouldn't it have been fairer, when we talked together\nyesterday, to tell me what I've just heard from Mrs. Leath?\"\n\n\"Fairer----?\" She stopped short with a startled look.\n\n\"If I'd known that your future was already settled I should have spared\nyou my gratuitous suggestions.\"\n\nShe walked on, more slowly, for a yard or two. \"I couldn't speak\nyesterday. I meant to have told you today.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not reproaching you for your lack of confidence. Only, if you\nHAD told me, I should have been more sure of your really meaning what\nyou said to me yesterday.\"\n\nShe did not ask him to what he referred, and he saw that her parting\nwords to him lived as vividly in her memory as in his.\n\n\"Is it so important that you should be sure?\" she finally questioned.\n\n\"Not to you, naturally,\" he returned with involuntary asperity. It was\nincredible, yet it was a fact, that for the moment his immediate purpose\nin seeking to speak to her was lost under a rush of resentment at\ncounting for so little in her fate. Of what stuff, then, was his feeling\nfor her made? A few hours earlier she had touched his thoughts as little\nas his senses; but now he felt old sleeping instincts stir in him...\nA rush of rain dashed against his face, and, catching Sophy's hat,\nstrained it back from her loosened hair. She put her hands to her head\nwith a familiar gesture...He came closer and held his umbrella over\nher...\n\nAt the lodge he waited while she went in. The rain continued to stream\ndown on him and he shivered in the dampness and stamped his feet on the\nflags. It seemed to him that a long time elapsed before the door opened\nand she reappeared. He glanced into the house for a glimpse of Anna, but\nobtained none; yet the mere sense of her nearness had completely altered\nhis mood.\n\nThe child, Sophy told him, was doing well; but Mrs. Leath had decided to\nwait till the surgeon came. Darrow, as they turned away, looked through\nthe gates, and saw the doctor's old-fashioned carriage by the roadside.\n\n\"Let me tell the doctor's boy to drive you back,\" he suggested; but\nSophy answered: \"No; I'll walk,\" and he moved on toward the house at her\nside. She expressed no surprise at his not remaining at the lodge, and\nagain they walked on in silence through the rain. She had accepted\nthe shelter of his umbrella, but she kept herself at such a carefully\nmeasured distance that even the slight swaying movements produced by\ntheir quick pace did not once bring her arm in touch with his; and,\nnoticing this, he perceived that every drop of her blood must be alive\nto his nearness.\n\n\"What I meant just now,\" he began, \"was that you ought to have been sure\nof my good wishes.\"\n\nShe seemed to weigh the words. \"Sure enough for what?\"\n\n\"To trust me a little farther than you did.\"\n\n\"I've told you that yesterday I wasn't free to speak.\"\n\n\"Well, since you are now, may I say a word to you?\"\n\nShe paused perceptibly, and when she spoke it was in so low a tone that\nhe had to bend his head to catch her answer. \"I can't think what you can\nhave to say.\"\n\n\"It's not easy to say here, at any rate. And indoors I sha'n't know\nwhere to say it.\" He glanced about him in the rain. \"Let's walk over to\nthe spring-house for a minute.\"\n\nTo the right of the drive, under a clump of trees, a little stucco\npavilion crowned by a balustrade rose on arches of mouldering brick over\na flight of steps that led down to a spring. Other steps curved up to a\ndoor above. Darrow mounted these, and opening the door entered a\nsmall circular room hung with loosened strips of painted paper whereon\nspectrally faded Mandarins executed elongated gestures. Some black and\ngold chairs with straw seats and an unsteady table of cracked lacquer\nstood on the floor of red-glazed tile.\n\nSophy had followed him without comment. He closed the door after her,\nand she stood motionless, as though waiting for him to speak.\n\n\"Now we can talk quietly,\" he said, looking at her with a smile into\nwhich he tried to put an intention of the frankest friendliness.\n\nShe merely repeated: \"I can't think what you can have to say.\"\n\nHer voice had lost the note of half-wistful confidence on which their\ntalk of the previous day had closed, and she looked at him with a kind\nof pale hostility. Her tone made it evident that his task would be\ndifficult, but it did not shake his resolve to go on. He sat down, and\nmechanically she followed his example. The table was between them and\nshe rested her arms on its cracked edge and her chin on her interlocked\nhands. He looked at her and she gave him back his look.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say to ME?\" he asked at length.\n\nA faint smile lifted, in the remembered way, the left corner of her\nnarrowed lips.\n\n\"About my marriage?\"\n\n\"About your marriage.\"\n\nShe continued to consider him between half-drawn lids. \"What can I say\nthat Mrs. Leath has not already told you?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Leath has told me nothing whatever but the fact--and her pleasure\nin it.\"\n\n\"Well; aren't those the two essential points?\"\n\n\"The essential points to YOU? I should have thought----\"\n\n\"Oh, to YOU, I meant,\" she put in keenly.\n\nHe flushed at the retort, but steadied himself and rejoined: \"The\nessential point to me is, of course, that you should be doing what's\nreally best for you.\"\n\nShe sat silent, with lowered lashes. At length she stretched out her arm\nand took up from the table a little threadbare Chinese hand-screen. She\nturned its ebony stem once or twice between her fingers, and as she did\nso Darrow was whimsically struck by the way in which their evanescent\nslight romance was symbolized by the fading lines on the frail silk.\n\n\"Do you think my engagement to Mr. Leath not really best for me?\" she\nasked at length.\n\nDarrow, before answering, waited long enough to get his words into the\ntersest shape--not without a sense, as he did so, of his likeness to the\nsurgeon deliberately poising his lancet for a clean incision. \"I'm not\nsure,\" he replied, \"of its being the best thing for either of you.\"\n\nShe took the stroke steadily, but a faint red swept her face like the\nreflection of a blush. She continued to keep her lowered eyes on the\nscreen.\n\n\"From whose point of view do you speak?\"\n\n\"Naturally, that of the persons most concerned.\"\n\n\"From Owen's, then, of course? You don't think me a good match for him?\"\n\n\"From yours, first of all. I don't think him a good match for you.\"\n\nHe brought the answer out abruptly, his eyes on her face. It had grown\nextremely pale, but as the meaning of his words shaped itself in her\nmind he saw a curious inner light dawn through her set look. She lifted\nher lids just far enough for a veiled glance at him, and a smile slipped\nthrough them to her trembling lips. For a moment the change merely\nbewildered him; then it pulled him up with a sharp jerk of apprehension.\n\n\"I don't think him a good match for you,\" he stammered, groping for the\nlost thread of his words.\n\nShe threw a vague look about the chilly rain-dimmed room. \"And you've\nbrought me here to tell me why?\"\n\nThe question roused him to the sense that their minutes were numbered,\nand that if he did not immediately get to his point there might be no\nother chance of making it.\n\n\"My chief reason is that I believe he's too young and inexperienced to\ngive you the kind of support you need.\"\n\nAt his words her face changed again, freezing to a tragic coldness. She\nstared straight ahead of her, perceptibly struggling with the tremor of\nher muscles; and when she had controlled it she flung out a pale-lipped\npleasantry. \"But you see I've always had to support myself!\"\n\n\"He's a boy,\" Darrow pushed on, \"a charming, wonderful boy; but with\nno more notion than a boy how to deal with the inevitable daily\nproblems...the trivial stupid unimportant things that life is chiefly\nmade up of.\" \"I'll deal with them for him,\" she rejoined.\n\n\"They'll be more than ordinarily difficult.\"\n\nShe shot a challenging glance at him. \"You must have some special reason\nfor saying so.\"\n\n\"Only my clear perception of the facts.\"\n\n\"What facts do you mean?\"\n\nDarrow hesitated. \"You must know better than I,\" he returned at length,\n\"that the way won't be made easy to you.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Leath, at any rate, has made it so.\"\n\n\"Madame de Chantelle will not.\"\n\n\"How do YOU know that?\" she flung back.\n\nHe paused again, not sure how far it was prudent to reveal himself\nin the confidence of the household. Then, to avoid involving Anna, he\nanswered: \"Madame de Chantelle sent for me yesterday.\"\n\n\"Sent for you--to talk to you about me?\" The colour rose to her forehead\nand her eyes burned black under lowered brows. \"By what right, I should\nlike to know? What have you to do with me, or with anything in the world\nthat concerns me?\"\n\nDarrow instantly perceived what dread suspicion again possessed her, and\nthe sense that it was not wholly unjustified caused him a passing pang\nof shame. But it did not turn him from his purpose.\n\n\"I'm an old friend of Mrs. Leath's. It's not unnatural that Madame de\nChantelle should talk to me.\"\n\nShe dropped the screen on the table and stood up, turning on him the\nsame small mask of wrath and scorn which had glared at him, in Paris,\nwhen he had confessed to his suppression of her letter. She walked away\na step or two and then came back.\n\n\"May I ask what Madame de Chantelle said to you?\"\n\n\"She made it clear that she should not encourage the marriage.\"\n\n\"And what was her object in making that clear to YOU?\"\n\nDarrow hesitated. \"I suppose she thought----\"\n\n\"That she could persuade you to turn Mrs. Leath against me?\"\n\nHe was silent, and she pressed him: \"Was that it?\" \"That was it.\"\n\n\"But if you don't--if you keep your promise----\"\n\n\"My promise?\"\n\n\"To say nothing...nothing whatever...\" Her strained look threw a haggard\nlight along the pause.\n\nAs she spoke, the whole odiousness of the scene rushed over him. \"Of\ncourse I shall say nothing...you know that...\" He leaned to her and laid\nhis hand on hers. \"You know I wouldn't for the world...\"\n\nShe drew back and hid her face with a sob. Then she sank again into her\nseat, stretched her arms across the table and laid her face upon them.\nHe sat still, overwhelmed with compunction. After a long interval, in\nwhich he had painfully measured the seconds by her hard-drawn breathing,\nshe looked up at him with a face washed clear of bitterness.\n\n\"Don't suppose I don't know what you must have thought of me!\"\n\nThe cry struck him down to a lower depth of self-abasement. \"My poor\nchild,\" he felt like answering, \"the shame of it is that I've never\nthought of you at all!\" But he could only uselessly repeat: \"I'll do\nanything I can to help you.\"\n\nShe sat silent, drumming the table with her hand. He saw that her doubt\nof him was allayed, and the perception made him more ashamed, as if her\ntrust had first revealed to him how near he had come to not deserving\nit. Suddenly she began to speak.\n\n\"You think, then, I've no right to marry him?\"\n\n\"No right? God forbid! I only meant----\"\n\n\"That you'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours.\" She brought\nit out deliberately, not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate\nstatement of fact.\n\nDarrow in turn stood up and wandered away helplessly to the window. He\nstood staring out through its small discoloured panes at the dim brown\ndistances; then he moved back to the table.\n\n\"I'll tell you exactly what I meant. You'll be wretched if you marry a\nman you're not in love with.\"\n\nHe knew the risk of misapprehension that he ran, but he estimated his\nchances of success as precisely in proportion to his peril. If certain\nsigns meant what he thought they did, he might yet--at what cost he\nwould not stop to think--make his past pay for his future.\n\nThe girl, at his words, had lifted her head with a movement of surprise.\nHer eyes slowly reached his face and rested there in a gaze of deep\ninterrogation. He held the look for a moment; then his own eyes dropped\nand he waited.\n\nAt length she began to speak. \"You're mistaken--you're quite mistaken.\"\n\nHe waited a moment longer. \"Mistaken----?\"\n\n\"In thinking what you think. I'm as happy as if I deserved it!\" she\nsuddenly proclaimed with a laugh.\n\nShe stood up and moved toward the door. \"NOW are you satisfied?\" she\nasked, turning her vividest face to him from the threshold.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nDown the avenue there came to them, with the opening of the door, the\nvoice of Owen's motor. It was the signal which had interrupted their\nfirst talk, and again, instinctively, they drew apart at the sound.\nWithout a word Darrow turned back into the room, while Sophy Viner went\ndown the steps and walked back alone toward the court.\n\nAt luncheon the presence of the surgeon, and the non-appearance\nof Madame de Chantelle--who had excused herself on the plea of a\nheadache--combined to shift the conversational centre of gravity; and\nDarrow, under shelter of the necessarily impersonal talk, had time to\nadjust his disguise and to perceive that the others were engaged in the\nsame re-arrangement. It was the first time that he had seen young Leath\nand Sophy Viner together since he had learned of their engagement; but\nneither revealed more emotion than befitted the occasion. It was evident\nthat Owen was deeply under the girl's charm, and that at the least\nsign from her his bliss would have broken bounds; but her reticence\nwas justified by the tacitly recognized fact of Madame de Chantelle's\ndisapproval. This also visibly weighed on Anna's mind, making her manner\nto Sophy, if no less kind, yet a trifle more constrained than if the\nmoment of final understanding had been reached. So Darrow interpreted\nthe tension perceptible under the fluent exchange of commonplaces in\nwhich he was diligently sharing. But he was more and more aware of his\ninability to test the moral atmosphere about him: he was like a man in\nfever testing another's temperature by the touch.\n\nAfter luncheon Anna, who was to motor the surgeon home, suggested to\nDarrow that he should accompany them. Effie was also of the party; and\nDarrow inferred that Anna wished to give her step-son a chance to be\nalone with his betrothed. On the way back, after the surgeon had been\nleft at his door, the little girl sat between her mother and Darrow, and\nher presence kept their talk from taking a personal turn. Darrow knew\nthat Mrs. Leath had not yet told Effie of the relation in which he was\nto stand to her. The premature divulging of Owen's plans had thrown\ntheir own into the background, and by common consent they continued, in\nthe little girl's presence, on terms of an informal friendliness.\n\nThe sky had cleared after luncheon, and to prolong their excursion they\nreturned by way of the ivy-mantled ruin which was to have been the scene\nof the projected picnic. This circuit brought them back to the park\ngates not long before sunset, and as Anna wished to stop at the lodge\nfor news of the injured child Darrow left her there with Effie and\nwalked on alone to the house. He had the impression that she\nwas slightly surprised at his not waiting for her; but his inner\nrestlessness vented itself in an intense desire for bodily movement. He\nwould have liked to walk himself into a state of torpor; to tramp on\nfor hours through the moist winds and the healing darkness and come\nback staggering with fatigue and sleep. But he had no pretext for such\na flight, and he feared that, at such a moment, his prolonged absence\nmight seem singular to Anna.\n\nAs he approached the house, the thought of her nearness produced a swift\nreaction of mood. It was as if an intenser vision of her had scattered\nhis perplexities like morning mists. At this moment, wherever she was,\nhe knew he was safely shut away in her thoughts, and the knowledge made\nevery other fact dwindle away to a shadow. He and she loved each other,\nand their love arched over them open and ample as the day: in all its\nsunlit spaces there was no cranny for a fear to lurk. In a few minutes\nhe would be in her presence and would read his reassurance in her eyes.\nAnd presently, before dinner, she would contrive that they should have\nan hour by themselves in her sitting-room, and he would sit by the\nhearth and watch her quiet movements, and the way the bluish lustre on\nher hair purpled a little as she bent above the fire.\n\nA carriage drove out of the court as he entered it, and in the hall his\nvision was dispelled by the exceedingly substantial presence of a lady\nin a waterproof and a tweed hat, who stood firmly planted in the centre\nof a pile of luggage, as to which she was giving involved but lucid\ndirections to the footman who had just admitted her. She went on with\nthese directions regardless of Darrow's entrance, merely fixing her\nsmall pale eyes on him while she proceeded, in a deep contralto voice,\nand a fluent French pronounced with the purest Boston accent, to specify\nthe destination of her bags; and this enabled Darrow to give her back a\ngaze protracted enough to take in all the details of her plain thick-set\nperson, from the square sallow face beneath bands of grey hair to the\nblunt boot-toes protruding under her wide walking skirt.\n\nShe submitted to this scrutiny with no more evidence of surprise than\na monument examined by a tourist; but when the fate of her luggage had\nbeen settled she turned suddenly to Darrow and, dropping her eyes from\nhis face to his feet, asked in trenchant accents: \"What sort of boots\nhave you got on?\"\n\nBefore he could summon his wits to the consideration of this question\nshe continued in a tone of suppressed indignation: \"Until Americans get\nused to the fact that France is under water for half the year they're\nperpetually risking their lives by not being properly protected. I\nsuppose you've been tramping through all this nasty clammy mud as if\nyou'd been taking a stroll on Boston Common.\"\n\nDarrow, with a laugh, affirmed his previous experience of French\ndampness, and the degree to which he was on his guard against it; but\nthe lady, with a contemptuous snort, rejoined: \"You young men are all\nalike----\"; to which she appended, after another hard look at him:\n\"I suppose you're George Darrow? I used to know one of your mother's\ncousins, who married a Tunstall of Mount Vernon Street. My name is\nAdelaide Painter. Have you been in Boston lately? No? I'm sorry for\nthat. I hear there have been several new houses built at the lower\nend of Commonwealth Avenue and I hoped you could tell me about them. I\nhaven't been there for thirty years myself.\"\n\nMiss Painter's arrival at Givre produced the same effect as the wind's\nhauling around to the north after days of languid weather. When Darrow\njoined the group about the tea-table she had already given a tingle to\nthe air. Madame de Chantelle still remained invisible above stairs;\nbut Darrow had the impression that even through her drawn curtains and\nbolted doors a stimulating whiff must have entered.\n\nAnna was in her usual seat behind the tea-tray, and Sophy Viner\npresently led in her pupil. Owen was also there, seated, as usual,\na little apart from the others, and following Miss Painter's massive\nmovements and equally substantial utterances with a smile of secret\nintelligence which gave Darrow the idea of his having been in\nclandestine parley with the enemy. Darrow further took note that the\ngirl and her suitor perceptibly avoided each other; but this might be a\nnatural result of the tension Miss Painter had been summoned to relieve.\n\nSophy Viner would evidently permit no recognition of the situation save\nthat which it lay with Madame de Chantelle to accord; but meanwhile Miss\nPainter had proclaimed her tacit sense of it by summoning the girl to a\nseat at her side.\n\nDarrow, as he continued to observe the newcomer, who was perched on her\narm-chair like a granite image on the edge of a cliff, was aware\nthat, in a more detached frame of mind, he would have found an extreme\ninterest in studying and classifying Miss Painter. It was not that she\nsaid anything remarkable, or betrayed any of those unspoken perceptions\nwhich give significance to the most commonplace utterances. She talked\nof the lateness of her train, of an impending crisis in international\npolitics, of the difficulty of buying English tea in Paris and of the\nenormities of which French servants were capable; and her views on these\nsubjects were enunciated with a uniformity of emphasis implying complete\nunconsciousness of any difference in their interest and importance. She\nalways applied to the French race the distant epithet of \"those people\",\nbut she betrayed an intimate acquaintance with many of its members,\nand an encyclopaedic knowledge of the domestic habits, financial\ndifficulties and private complications of various persons of social\nimportance. Yet, as she evidently felt no incongruity in her\nattitude, so she revealed no desire to parade her familiarity with the\nfashionable, or indeed any sense of it as a fact to be paraded. It was\nevident that the titled ladies whom she spoke of as Mimi or Simone or\nOdette were as much \"those people\" to her as the bonne who tampered with\nher tea and steamed the stamps off her letters (\"when, by a miracle,\nI don't put them in the box myself.\") Her whole attitude was of a vast\ngrim tolerance of things-as-they-came, as though she had been some\nwonderful automatic machine which recorded facts but had not yet been\nperfected to the point of sorting or labelling them.\n\nAll this, as Darrow was aware, still fell short of accounting for the\ninfluence she obviously exerted on the persons in contact with her.\nIt brought a slight relief to his state of tension to go on wondering,\nwhile he watched and listened, just where the mystery lurked.\nPerhaps, after all, it was in the fact of her blank insensibility,\nan insensibility so devoid of egotism that it had no hardness and no\ngrimaces, but rather the freshness of a simpler mental state. After\nliving, as he had, as they all had, for the last few days, in an\natmosphere perpetually tremulous with echoes and implications, it was\nrestful and fortifying merely to walk into the big blank area of Miss\nPainter's mind, so vacuous for all its accumulated items, so echoless\nfor all its vacuity.\n\nHis hope of a word with Anna before dinner was dispelled by her rising\nto take Miss Painter up to Madame de Chantelle; and he wandered away\nto his own room, leaving Owen and Miss Viner engaged in working out a\npicture-puzzle for Effie.\n\nMadame de Chantelle--possibly as the result of her friend's\nministrations--was able to appear at the dinner-table, rather pale and\npink-nosed, and casting tenderly reproachful glances at her grandson,\nwho faced them with impervious serenity; and the situation was relieved\nby the fact that Miss Viner, as usual, had remained in the school-room\nwith her pupil.\n\nDarrow conjectured that the real clash of arms would not take place till\nthe morrow; and wishing to leave the field open to the contestants he\nset out early on a solitary walk. It was nearly luncheon-time when he\nreturned from it and came upon Anna just emerging from the house. She\nhad on her hat and jacket and was apparently coming forth to seek him,\nfor she said at once: \"Madame de Chantelle wants you to go up to her.\"\n\n\"To go up to her? Now?\"\n\n\"That's the message she sent. She appears to rely on you to do\nsomething.\" She added with a smile: \"Whatever it is, let's have it\nover!\"\n\nDarrow, through his rising sense of apprehension, wondered why, instead\nof merely going for a walk, he had not jumped into the first train and\ngot out of the way till Owen's affairs were finally settled.\n\n\"But what in the name of goodness can I do?\" he protested, following\nAnna back into the hall.\n\n\"I don't know. But Owen seems so to rely on you, too----\"\n\n\"Owen! Is HE to be there?\"\n\n\"No. But you know I told him he could count on you.\"\n\n\"But I've said to your mother-in-law all I could.\"\n\n\"Well, then you can only repeat it.\"\n\nThis did not seem to Darrow to simplify his case as much as she appeared\nto think; and once more he had a movement of recoil. \"There's no\npossible reason for my being mixed up in this affair!\"\n\nAnna gave him a reproachful glance. \"Not the fact that I am?\" she\nreminded him; but even this only stiffened his resistance.\n\n\"Why should you be, either--to this extent?\"\n\nThe question made her pause. She glanced about the hall, as if to be\nsure they had it to themselves; and then, in a lowered voice: \"I don't\nknow,\" she suddenly confessed; \"but, somehow, if THEY'RE not happy I\nfeel as if we shouldn't be.\"\n\n\"Oh, well--\" Darrow acquiesced, in the tone of the man who perforce\nyields to so lovely an unreasonableness. Escape was, after all,\nimpossible, and he could only resign himself to being led to Madame de\nChantelle's door.\n\nWithin, among the bric-a-brac and furbelows, he found Miss Painter\nseated in a redundant purple armchair with the incongruous air of a\nhorseman bestriding a heavy mount. Madame de Chantelle sat opposite,\nstill a little wan and disordered under her elaborate hair, and clasping\nthe handkerchief whose visibility symbolized her distress. On the\nyoung man's entrance she sighed out a plaintive welcome, to which she\nimmediately appended: \"Mr. Darrow, I can't help feeling that at heart\nyou're with me!\"\n\nThe directness of the challenge made it easier for Darrow to protest,\nand he reiterated his inability to give an opinion on either side.\n\n\"But Anna declares you have--on hers!\"\n\nHe could not restrain a smile at this faint flaw in an impartiality so\nscrupulous. Every evidence of feminine inconsequence in Anna seemed to\nattest her deeper subjection to the most inconsequent of passions. He\nhad certainly promised her his help--but before he knew what he was\npromising.\n\nHe met Madame de Chantelle's appeal by replying: \"If there were anything\nI could possibly say I should want it to be in Miss Viner's favour.\"\n\n\"You'd want it to be--yes! But could you make it so?\"\n\n\"As far as facts go, I don't see how I can make it either for or against\nher. I've already said that I know nothing of her except that she's\ncharming.\"\n\n\"As if that weren't enough--weren't all there OUGHT to be!\" Miss Painter\nput in impatiently. She seemed to address herself to Darrow, though her\nsmall eyes were fixed on her friend.\n\n\"Madame de Chantelle seems to imagine,\" she pursued, \"that a young\nAmerican girl ought to have a dossier--a police-record, or whatever you\ncall it: what those awful women in the streets have here. In our country\nit's enough to know that a young girl's pure and lovely: people don't\nimmediately ask her to show her bank-account and her visiting-list.\"\n\nMadame de Chantelle looked plaintively at her sturdy monitress. \"You\ndon't expect me not to ask if she's got a family?\"\n\n\"No; nor to think the worse of her if she hasn't. The fact that she's an\norphan ought, with your ideas, to be a merit. You won't have to invite\nher father and mother to Givre!\"\n\n\"Adelaide--Adelaide!\" the mistress of Givre lamented.\n\n\"Lucretia Mary,\" the other returned--and Darrow spared an instant's\namusement to the quaint incongruity of the name--\"you know you sent for\nMr. Darrow to refute me; and how can he, till he knows what I think?\"\n\n\"You think it's perfectly simple to let Owen marry a girl we know\nnothing about?\"\n\n\"No; but I don't think it's perfectly simple to prevent him.\"\n\nThe shrewdness of the answer increased Darrow's interest in Miss\nPainter. She had not hitherto struck him as being a person of much\npenetration, but he now felt sure that her gimlet gaze might bore to the\nheart of any practical problem.\n\nMadame de Chantelle sighed out her recognition of the difficulty.\n\n\"I haven't a word to say against Miss Viner; but she's knocked about\nso, as it's called, that she must have been mixed up with some rather\ndreadful people. If only Owen could be made to see that--if one could\nget at a few facts, I mean. She says, for instance, that she has a\nsister; but it seems she doesn't even know her address!\"\n\n\"If she does, she may not want to give it to you. I daresay the sister's\none of the dreadful people. I've no doubt that with a little time you\ncould rake up dozens of them: have her 'traced', as they call it in\ndetective stories. I don't think you'd frighten Owen, but you might:\nit's natural enough he should have been corrupted by those foreign\nideas. You might even manage to part him from the girl; but you couldn't\nkeep him from being in love with her. I saw that when I looked them\nover last evening. I said to myself: 'It's a real old-fashioned American\ncase, as sweet and sound as home-made bread.' Well, if you take his loaf\naway from him, what are you going to feed him with instead? Which of\nyour nasty Paris poisons do you think he'll turn to? Supposing you\nsucceed in keeping him out of a really bad mess--and, knowing the young\nman as I do, I rather think that, at this crisis, the only way to do it\nwould be to marry him slap off to somebody else--well, then, who, may I\nask, would you pick out? One of your sweet French ingenues, I suppose?\nWith as much mind as a minnow and as much snap as a soft-boiled egg. You\nmight hustle him into that kind of marriage; I daresay you could--but\nif I know Owen, the natural thing would happen before the first baby was\nweaned.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you insinuate such odious things against Owen!\"\n\n\"Do you think it would be odious of him to return to his real love when\nhe'd been forcibly parted from her? At any rate, it's what your French\nfriends do, every one of them! Only they don't generally have the grace\nto go back to an old love; and I believe, upon my word, Owen would!\"\n\nMadame de Chantelle looked at her with a mixture of awe and exultation.\n\"Of course you realize, Adelaide, that in suggesting this you're\ninsinuating the most shocking things against Miss Viner?\"\n\n\"When I say that if you part two young things who are dying to be happy\nin the lawful way it's ten to one they'll come together in an unlawful\none? I'm insinuating shocking things against YOU, Lucretia Mary, in\nsuggesting for a moment that you'll care to assume such a responsibility\nbefore your Maker. And you wouldn't, if you talked things straight out\nwith him, instead of merely sending him messages through a miserable\nsinner like yourself!\"\n\nDarrow expected this assault on her adopted creed to provoke in Madame\nde Chantelle an explosion of pious indignation; but to his surprise she\nmerely murmured: \"I don't know what Mr. Darrow'll think of you!\"\n\n\"Mr. Darrow probably knows his Bible as well as I do,\" Miss Painter\ncalmly rejoined; adding a moment later, without the least perceptible\nchange of voice or expression: \"I suppose you've heard that Gisele\nde Folembray's husband accuses her of being mixed up with the Duc\nd'Arcachon in that business of trying to sell a lot of imitation pearls\nto Mrs. Homer Pond, the Chicago woman the Duke's engaged to? It seems\nthe jeweller says Gisele brought Mrs. Pond there, and got twenty-five\nper cent--which of course she passed on to d'Arcachon. The poor old\nDuchess is in a fearful state--so afraid her son'll lose Mrs. Pond!\nWhen I think that Gisele is old Bradford Wagstaff's grand-daughter, I'm\nthankful he's safe in Mount Auburn!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nIt was not until late that afternoon that Darrow could claim his\npostponed hour with Anna. When at last he found her alone in her\nsitting-room it was with a sense of liberation so great that he sought\nno logical justification of it. He simply felt that all their destinies\nwere in Miss Painter's grasp, and that, resistance being useless, he\ncould only enjoy the sweets of surrender.\n\nAnna herself seemed as happy, and for more explicable reasons. She had\nassisted, after luncheon, at another debate between Madame de Chantelle\nand her confidant, and had surmised, when she withdrew from it, that\nvictory was permanently perched on Miss Painter's banners.\n\n\"I don't know how she does it, unless it's by the dead weight of her\nconvictions. She detests the French so that she'd back up Owen even if\nshe knew nothing--or knew too much--of Miss Viner. She somehow regards\nthe match as a protest against the corruption of European morals. I told\nOwen that was his great chance, and he's made the most of it.\"\n\n\"What a tactician you are! You make me feel that I hardly know the\nrudiments of diplomacy,\" Darrow smiled at her, abandoning himself to a\nperilous sense of well-being.\n\nShe gave him back his smile. \"I'm afraid I think nothing short of my own\nhappiness is worth wasting any diplomacy on!\"\n\n\"That's why I mean to resign from the service of my country,\" he\nrejoined with a laugh of deep content.\n\nThe feeling that both resistance and apprehension were vain was working\nlike wine in his veins. He had done what he could to deflect the course\nof events: now he could only stand aside and take his chance of safety.\nUnderneath this fatalistic feeling was the deep sense of relief that\nhe had, after all, said and done nothing that could in the least degree\naffect the welfare of Sophy Viner. That fact took a millstone off his\nneck.\n\nMeanwhile he gave himself up once more to the joy of Anna's presence.\nThey had not been alone together for two long days, and he had the\nlover's sense that he had forgotten, or at least underestimated, the\nstrength of the spell she cast. Once more her eyes and her smile seemed\nto bound his world. He felt that their light would always move with him\nas the sunset moves before a ship at sea.\n\n\nThe next day his sense of security was increased by a decisive incident.\nIt became known to the expectant household that Madame de Chantelle had\nyielded to the tremendous impact of Miss Painter's determination and\nthat Sophy Viner had been \"sent for\" to the purple satin sitting-room.\n\nAt luncheon, Owen's radiant countenance proclaimed the happy sequel, and\nDarrow, when the party had moved back to the oak-room for coffee, deemed\nit discreet to wander out alone to the terrace with his cigar. The\nconclusion of Owen's romance brought his own plans once more to the\nfront. Anna had promised that she would consider dates and settle\ndetails as soon as Madame de Chantelle and her grandson had been\nreconciled, and Darrow was eager to go into the question at once,\nsince it was necessary that the preparations for his marriage should\ngo forward as rapidly as possible. Anna, he knew, would not seek any\nfarther pretext for delay; and he strolled up and down contentedly in\nthe sunshine, certain that she would come out and reassure him as soon\nas the reunited family had claimed its due share of her attention.\n\nBut when she finally joined him her first word was for the younger\nlovers.\n\n\"I want to thank you for what you've done for Owen,\" she began, with her\nhappiest smile.\n\n\"Who--I?\" he laughed. \"Are you confusing me with Miss Painter?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to say for ME,\" she corrected herself. \"You've been\neven more of a help to us than Adelaide.\"\n\n\"My dear child! What on earth have I done?\"\n\n\"You've managed to hide from Madame de Chantelle that you don't really\nlike poor Sophy.\"\n\nDarrow felt the pallour in his cheek. \"Not like her? What put such an\nidea into your head?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's more than an idea--it's a feeling. But what difference does\nit make, after all? You saw her in such a different setting that it's\nnatural you should be a little doubtful. But when you know her better\nI'm sure you'll feel about her as I do.\"\n\n\"It's going to be hard for me not to feel about everything as you do.\"\n\n\"Well, then--please begin with my daughter-in-law!\"\n\nHe gave her back in the same tone of banter: \"Agreed: if you ll agree to\nfeel as I do about the pressing necessity of our getting married.\"\n\n\"I want to talk to you about that too. You don't know what a weight is\noff my mind! With Sophy here for good, I shall feel so differently\nabout leaving Effie. I've seen much more accomplished governesses--to\nmy cost!--but I've never seen a young thing more gay and kind and human.\nYou must have noticed, though you've seen them so little together, how\nEffie expands when she's with her. And that, you know, is what I want.\nMadame de Chantelle will provide the necessary restraint.\" She clasped\nher hands on his arm. \"Yes, I'm ready to go with you now. But first of\nall--this very moment!--you must come with me to Effie. She knows, of\ncourse, nothing of what's been happening; and I want her to be told\nfirst about YOU.\"\n\nEffie, sought throughout the house, was presently traced to the\nschool-room, and thither Darrow mounted with Anna. He had never seen\nher so alight with happiness, and he had caught her buoyancy of mood. He\nkept repeating to himself: \"It's over--it's over,\" as if some monstrous\nmidnight hallucination had been routed by the return of day.\n\nAs they approached the school-room door the terrier's barks came to them\nthrough laughing remonstrances.\n\n\"She's giving him his dinner,\" Anna whispered, her hand in Darrow's.\n\n\"Don't forget the gold-fish!\" they heard another voice call out.\n\nDarrow halted on the threshold. \"Oh--not now!\"\n\n\"Not now?\"\n\n\"I mean--she'd rather have you tell her first. I'll wait for you both\ndownstairs.\"\n\nHe was aware that she glanced at him intently. \"As you please. I'll\nbring her down at once.\"\n\nShe opened the door, and as she went in he heard her say: \"No, Sophy,\ndon't go! I want you both.\"\n\n\nThe rest of Darrow's day was a succession of empty and agitating\nscenes. On his way down to Givre, before he had seen Effie Leath, he\nhad pictured somewhat sentimentally the joy of the moment when he should\ntake her in his arms and receive her first filial kiss. Everything\nin him that egotistically craved for rest, stability, a comfortably\norganized middle-age, all the home-building instincts of the man who\nhas sufficiently wooed and wandered, combined to throw a charm about the\nfigure of the child who might--who should--have been his. Effie came to\nhim trailing the cloud of glory of his first romance, giving him\nback the magic hour he had missed and mourned. And how different the\nrealization of his dream had been! The child's radiant welcome, her\nunquestioning acceptance of, this new figure in the family group, had\nbeen all that he had hoped and fancied. If Mother was so awfully happy\nabout it, and Owen and Granny, too, how nice and cosy and comfortable\nit was going to be for all of them, her beaming look seemed to say; and\nthen, suddenly, the small pink fingers he had been kissing were laid\non the one flaw in the circle, on the one point which must be settled\nbefore Effie could, with complete unqualified assurance, admit the\nnew-comer to full equality with the other gods of her Olympus.\n\n\"And is Sophy awfully happy about it too?\" she had asked, loosening her\nhold on Darrow's neck to tilt back her head and include her mother in\nher questioning look.\n\n\"Why, dearest, didn't you see she was?\" Anna had exclaimed, leaning to\nthe group with radiant eyes.\n\n\"I think I should like to ask her,\" the child rejoined, after a minute's\nshy consideration; and as Darrow set her down her mother laughed: \"Do,\ndarling, do! Run off at once, and tell her we expect her to be awfully\nhappy too.\"\n\nThe scene had been succeeded by others less poignant but almost as\ntrying. Darrow cursed his luck in having, at such a moment, to run\nthe gauntlet of a houseful of interested observers. The state of being\n\"engaged\", in itself an absurd enough predicament, even to a man only\nintermittently exposed, became intolerable under the continuous scrutiny\nof a small circle quivering with participation. Darrow was furthermore\naware that, though the case of the other couple ought to have made\nhis own less conspicuous, it was rather they who found a refuge in the\nshadow of his prominence. Madame de Chantelle, though she had\nconsented to Owen's engagement and formally welcomed his betrothed,\nwas nevertheless not sorry to show, by her reception of Darrow, of\nwhat finely-shaded degrees of cordiality she was capable. Miss Painter,\nhaving won the day for Owen, was also free to turn her attention to the\nnewer candidate for her sympathy; and Darrow and Anna found themselves\nimmersed in a warm bath of sentimental curiosity.\n\nIt was a relief to Darrow that he was under a positive obligation to end\nhis visit within the next forty-eight hours. When he left London, his\nAmbassador had accorded him a ten days' leave. His fate being definitely\nsettled and openly published he had no reason for asking to have the\ntime prolonged, and when it was over he was to return to his post till\nthe time fixed for taking up his new duties. Anna and he had therefore\ndecided to be married, in Paris, a day or two before the departure of\nthe steamer which was to take them to South America; and Anna, shortly\nafter his return to England, was to go up to Paris and begin her own\npreparations.\n\nIn honour of the double betrothal Effie and Miss Viner were to appear\nthat evening at dinner; and Darrow, on leaving his room, met the little\ngirl springing down the stairs, her white ruffles and coral-coloured\nbows making her look like a daisy with her yellow hair for its centre.\nSophy Viner was behind her pupil, and as she came into the light Darrow\nnoticed a change in her appearance and wondered vaguely why she looked\nsuddenly younger, more vivid, more like the little luminous ghost of his\nParis memories. Then it occurred to him that it was the first time she\nhad appeared at dinner since his arrival at Givre, and the first time,\nconsequently, that he had seen her in evening dress. She was still at\nthe age when the least adornment embellishes; and no doubt the mere\nuncovering of her young throat and neck had given her back her former\nbrightness. But a second glance showed a more precise reason for his\nimpression. Vaguely though he retained such details, he felt sure she\nwas wearing the dress he had seen her in every evening in Paris. It was\na simple enough dress, black, and transparent on the arms and shoulders,\nand he would probably not have recognized it if she had not called his\nattention to it in Paris by confessing that she hadn't any other. \"The\nsame dress? That proves that she's forgotten!\" was his first half-ironic\nthought; but the next moment, with a pang of compunction, he said to\nhimself that she had probably put it on for the same reason as before:\nsimply because she hadn't any other.\n\nHe looked at her in silence, and for an instant, above Effie's bobbing\nhead, she gave him back his look in a full bright gaze.\n\n\"Oh, there's Owen!\" Effie cried, and whirled away down the gallery to\nthe door from which her step-brother was emerging. As Owen bent to catch\nher, Sophy Viner turned abruptly back to Darrow.\n\n\"You, too?\" she said with a quick laugh. \"I didn't know----\" And as Owen\ncame up to them she added, in a tone that might have been meant to reach\nhis ear: \"I wish you all the luck that we can spare!\"\n\nAbout the dinner-table, which Effie, with Miss Viner's aid, had lavishly\ngarlanded, the little party had an air of somewhat self-conscious\nfestivity. In spite of flowers, champagne and a unanimous attempt at\nease, there were frequent lapses in the talk, and moments of nervous\ngroping for new subjects. Miss Painter alone seemed not only\nunaffected by the general perturbation but as tightly sealed up in\nher unconsciousness of it as a diver in his bell. To Darrow's strained\nattention even Owen's gusts of gaiety seemed to betray an inward sense\nof insecurity. After dinner, however, at the piano, he broke into a mood\nof extravagant hilarity and flooded the room with the splash and ripple\nof his music.\n\nDarrow, sunk in a sofa corner in the lee of Miss Painter's granite\nbulk, smoked and listened in silence, his eyes moving from one figure to\nanother. Madame de Chantelle, in her armchair near the fire, clasped her\nlittle granddaughter to her with the gesture of a drawing-room Niobe,\nand Anna, seated near them, had fallen into one of the attitudes of\nvivid calm which seemed to Darrow to express her inmost quality. Sophy\nViner, after moving uncertainly about the room, had placed herself\nbeyond Mrs. Leath, in a chair near the piano, where she sat with head\nthrown back and eyes attached to the musician, in the same rapt fixity\nof attention with which she had followed the players at the Francais.\nThe accident of her having fallen into the same attitude, and of her\nwearing the same dress, gave Darrow, as he watched her, a strange sense\nof double consciousness. To escape from it, his glance turned back to\nAnna; but from the point at which he was placed his eyes could not\ntake in the one face without the other, and that renewed the disturbing\nduality of the impression. Suddenly Owen broke off with a crash of\nchords and jumped to his feet.\n\n\"What's the use of this, with such a moon to say it for us?\"\n\nBehind the uncurtained window a low golden orb hung like a ripe fruit\nagainst the glass.\n\n\"Yes--let's go out and listen,\" Anna answered. Owen threw open the\nwindow, and with his gesture a fold of the heavy star-sprinkled sky\nseemed to droop into the room like a drawn-in curtain. The air that\nentered with it had a frosty edge, and Anna bade Effie run to the hall\nfor wraps.\n\nDarrow said: \"You must have one too,\" and started toward the door;\nbut Sophy, following her pupil, cried back: \"We'll bring things for\neverybody.\"\n\nOwen had followed her, and in a moment the three reappeared, and the\nparty went out on the terrace. The deep blue purity of the night was\nunveiled by mist, and the moonlight rimmed the edges of the trees with\na silver blur and blanched to unnatural whiteness the statues against\ntheir walls of shade.\n\nDarrow and Anna, with Effie between them, strolled to the farther corner\nof the terrace. Below them, between the fringes of the park, the lawn\nsloped dimly to the fields above the river. For a few minutes they stood\nsilently side by side, touched to peace beneath the trembling beauty of\nthe sky. When they turned back, Darrow saw that Owen and Sophy Viner,\nwho had gone down the steps to the garden, were also walking in the\ndirection of the house. As they advanced, Sophy paused in a patch of\nmoonlight, between the sharp shadows of the yews, and Darrow noticed\nthat she had thrown over her shoulders a long cloak of some light\ncolour, which suddenly evoked her image as she had entered the\nrestaurant at his side on the night of their first dinner in Paris. A\nmoment later they were all together again on the terrace, and when they\nre-entered the drawing-room the older ladies were on their way to bed.\n\nEffie, emboldened by the privileges of the evening, was for coaxing Owen\nto round it off with a game of forfeits or some such reckless climax;\nbut Sophy, resuming her professional role, sounded the summons to bed.\nIn her pupil's wake she made her round of good-nights; but when she\nproffered her hand to Anna, the latter ignoring the gesture held out\nboth arms.\n\n\"Good-night, dear child,\" she said impulsively, and drew the girl to her\nkiss.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nThe next day was Darrow's last at Givre and, foreseeing that the\nafternoon and evening would have to be given to the family, he had asked\nAnna to devote an early hour to the final consideration of their plans.\nHe was to meet her in the brown sitting-room at ten, and they were to\nwalk down to the river and talk over their future in the little pavilion\nabutting on the wall of the park.\n\nIt was just a week since his arrival at Givre, and Anna wished, before\nhe left, to return to the place where they had sat on their first\nafternoon together. Her sensitiveness to the appeal of inanimate things,\nto the colour and texture of whatever wove itself into the substance of\nher emotion, made her want to hear Darrow's voice, and to feel his eyes\non her, in the spot where bliss had first flowed into her heart.\n\nThat bliss, in the interval, had wound itself into every fold of her\nbeing. Passing, in the first days, from a high shy tenderness to the\nrush of a secret surrender, it had gradually widened and deepened, to\nflow on in redoubled beauty. She thought she now knew exactly how and\nwhy she loved Darrow, and she could see her whole sky reflected in the\ndeep and tranquil current of her love.\n\nEarly the next day, in her sitting-room, she was glancing through the\nletters which it was Effie's morning privilege to carry up to her. Effie\nmeanwhile circled inquisitively about the room, where there was always\nsomething new to engage her infant fancy; and Anna, looking up, saw her\nsuddenly arrested before a photograph of Darrow which, the day before,\nhad taken its place on the writing-table.\n\nAnna held out her arms with a faint blush. \"You do like him, don't you,\ndear?\"\n\n\"Oh, most awfully, dearest,\" Effie, against her breast, leaned back\nto assure her with a limpid look. \"And so do Granny and Owen--and I DO\nthink Sophy does too,\" she added, after a moment's earnest pondering.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Anna laughed. She checked the impulse to continue: \"Has she\ntalked to you about him, that you're so sure?\" She did not know what had\nmade the question spring to her lips, but she was glad she had closed\nthem before pronouncing it. Nothing could have been more distasteful to\nher than to clear up such obscurities by turning on them the tiny flame\nof her daughter's observation. And what, after all, now that Owen's\nhappiness was secured, did it matter if there were certain reserves in\nDarrow's approval of his marriage?\n\nA knock on the door made Anna glance at the clock. \"There's Nurse to\ncarry you off.\"\n\n\"It's Sophy's knock,\" the little girl answered, jumping down to open the\ndoor; and Miss Viner in fact stood on the threshold.\n\n\"Come in,\" Anna said with a smile, instantly remarking how pale she\nlooked.\n\n\"May Effie go out for a turn with Nurse?\" the girl asked. \"I should like\nto speak to you a moment.\"\n\n\"Of course. This ought to be YOUR holiday, as yesterday was Effie's. Run\noff, dear,\" she added, stooping to kiss the little girl.\n\nWhen the door had closed she turned back to Sophy Viner with a look that\nsought her confidence. \"I'm so glad you came, my dear. We've got so many\nthings to talk about, just you and I together.\"\n\nThe confused intercourse of the last days had, in fact, left little time\nfor any speech with Sophy but such as related to her marriage and the\nmeans of overcoming Madame de Chantelle's opposition to it. Anna had\nexacted of Owen that no one, not even Sophy Viner, should be given a\nhint of her own projects till all contingent questions had been disposed\nof. She had felt, from the outset, a secret reluctance to intrude her\nsecurer happiness on the doubts and fears of the young pair.\n\nFrom the sofa-corner to which she had dropped back she pointed to\nDarrow's chair. \"Come and sit by me, dear. I wanted to see you alone.\nThere's so much to say that I hardly know where to begin.\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her hands clasped on the arms of the sofa, her eyes\nbent smilingly on Sophy's. As she did so, she noticed that the girl's\nunusual pallour was partly due to the slight veil of powder on her\nface. The discovery was distinctly disagreeable. Anna had never before\nnoticed, on Sophy's part, any recourse to cosmetics, and, much as\nshe wished to think herself exempt from old-fashioned prejudices, she\nsuddenly became aware that she did not like her daughter's governess to\nhave a powdered face. Then she reflected that the girl who sat opposite\nher was no longer Effie's governess, but her own future daughter-in-law;\nand she wondered whether Miss Viner had chosen this odd way of\ncelebrating her independence, and whether, as Mrs. Owen Leath, she would\npresent to the world a bedizened countenance. This idea was scarcely\nless distasteful than the other, and for a moment Anna continued to\nconsider her without speaking. Then, in a flash, the truth came to her:\nMiss Viner had powdered her face because Miss Viner had been crying.\n\nAnna leaned forward impulsively. \"My dear child, what's the matter?\"\nShe saw the girl's blood rush up under the white mask, and hastened on:\n\"Please don't be afraid to tell me. I do so want you to feel that you\ncan trust me as Owen does. And you know you mustn't mind if, just at\nfirst, Madame de Chantelle occasionally relapses.\"\n\nShe spoke eagerly, persuasively, almost on a note of pleading. She had,\nin truth, so many reasons for wanting Sophy to like her: her love for\nOwen, her solicitude for Effie, and her own sense of the girl's fine\nmettle. She had always felt a romantic and almost humble admiration for\nthose members of her sex who, from force of will, or the constraint\nof circumstances, had plunged into the conflict from which fate had\nso persistently excluded her. There were even moments when she fancied\nherself vaguely to blame for her immunity, and felt that she ought\nsomehow to have affronted the perils and hardships which refused to come\nto her. And now, as she sat looking at Sophy Viner, so small, so slight,\nso visibly defenceless and undone, she still felt, through all the\nsuperiority of her worldly advantages and her seeming maturity, the same\nodd sense of ignorance and inexperience. She could not have said what\nthere was in the girl's manner and expression to give her this feeling,\nbut she was reminded, as she looked at Sophy Viner, of the other girls\nshe had known in her youth, the girls who seemed possessed of a secret\nshe had missed. Yes, Sophy Viner had their look--almost the obscurely\nmenacing look of Kitty Mayne...Anna, with an inward smile, brushed aside\nthe image of this forgotten rival. But she had felt, deep down, a\ntwinge of the old pain, and she was sorry that, even for the flash of\na thought, Owen's betrothed should have reminded her of so different a\nwoman...\n\nShe laid her hand on the girl's. \"When his grandmother sees how happy\nOwen is she'll be quite happy herself. If it's only that, don't be\ndistressed. Just trust to Owen--and the future.\"\n\nSophy Viner, with an almost imperceptible recoil of her whole slight\nperson, had drawn her hand from under the palm enclosing it.\n\n\"That's what I wanted to talk to you about--the future.\"\n\n\"Of course! We've all so many plans to make--and to fit into each\nother's. Please let's begin with yours.\"\n\nThe girl paused a moment, her hands clasped on the arms of her chair,\nher lids dropped under Anna's gaze; then she said: \"I should like to\nmake no plans at all...just yet...\"\n\n\"No plans?\"\n\n\"No--I should like to go away...my friends the Farlows would let me go\nto them...\" Her voice grew firmer and she lifted her eyes to add: \"I\nshould like to leave today, if you don't mind.\"\n\nAnna listened with a rising wonder.\n\n\"You want to leave Givre at once?\" She gave the idea a moment's swift\nconsideration. \"You prefer to be with your friends till your marriage?\nI understand that--but surely you needn't rush off today? There are so\nmany details to discuss; and before long, you know, I shall be going\naway too.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\" The girl was evidently trying to steady her voice. \"But I\nshould like to wait a few days--to have a little more time to myself.\"\n\nAnna continued to consider her kindly. It was evident that she did not\ncare to say why she wished to leave Givre so suddenly, but her disturbed\nface and shaken voice betrayed a more pressing motive than the natural\ndesire to spend the weeks before her marriage under her old friends'\nroof. Since she had made no response to the allusion to Madame de\nChantelle, Anna could but conjecture that she had had a passing\ndisagreement with Owen; and if this were so, random interference might\ndo more harm than good.\n\n\"My dear child, if you really want to go at once I sha'n't, of course,\nurge you to stay. I suppose you have spoken to Owen?\"\n\n\"No. Not yet...\"\n\nAnna threw an astonished glance at her. \"You mean to say you haven't\ntold him?\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell you first. I thought I ought to, on account of Effie.\"\nHer look cleared as she put forth this reason.\n\n\"Oh, Effie!--\" Anna's smile brushed away the scruple. \"Owen has a right\nto ask that you should consider him before you think of his sister...Of\ncourse you shall do just as you wish,\" she went on, after another\nthoughtful interval.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" Sophy Viner murmured and rose to her feet.\n\nAnna rose also, vaguely seeking for some word that should break down the\ngirl's resistance. \"You'll tell Owen at once?\" she finally asked.\n\nMiss Viner, instead of replying, stood before her in manifest\nuncertainty, and as she did so there was a light tap on the door, and\nOwen Leath walked into the room.\n\nAnna's first glance told her that his face was unclouded. He met her\ngreeting with his happiest smile and turned to lift Sophy's hand to his\nlips. The perception that he was utterly unconscious of any cause for\nMiss Viner's agitation came to his step-mother with a sharp thrill of\nsurprise.\n\n\"Darrow's looking for you,\" he said to her. \"He asked me to remind you\nthat you'd promised to go for a walk with him.\"\n\nAnna glanced at the clock. \"I'll go down presently.\" She waited and\nlooked again at Sophy Viner, whose troubled eyes seemed to commit their\nmessage to her. \"You'd better tell Owen, my dear.\"\n\nOwen's look also turned on the girl. \"Tell me what? Why, what's\nhappened?\"\n\nAnna summoned a laugh to ease the vague tension of the moment. \"Don't\nlook so startled! Nothing, except that Sophy proposes to desert us for a\nwhile for the Farlows.\"\n\nOwen's brow cleared. \"I was afraid she'd run off before long.\" He\nglanced at Anna. \"Do please keep her here as long as you can!\"\n\nSophy intervened: \"Mrs. Leath's already given me leave to go.\"\n\n\"Already? To go when?\"\n\n\"Today,\" said Sophy in a low tone, her eyes on Anna's.\n\n\"Today? Why on earth should you go today?\" Owen dropped back a step or\ntwo, flushing and paling under his bewildered frown. His eyes seemed to\nsearch the girl more closely. \"Something's happened.\" He too looked at\nhis step-mother. \"I suppose she must have told you what it is?\"\n\nAnna was struck by the suddenness and vehemence of his appeal. It was as\nthough some smouldering apprehension had lain close under the surface of\nhis security.\n\n\"She's told me nothing except that she wishes to be with her friends.\nIt's quite natural that she should want to go to them.\"\n\nOwen visibly controlled himself. \"Of course--quite natural.\" He spoke\nto Sophy. \"But why didn't you tell me so? Why did you come first to my\nstep-mother?\"\n\nAnna intervened with her calm smile. \"That seems to me quite natural,\ntoo. Sophy was considerate enough to tell me first because of Effie.\"\n\nHe weighed it. \"Very well, then: that's quite natural, as you say. And\nof course she must do exactly as she pleases.\" He still kept his eyes on\nthe girl. \"Tomorrow,\" he abruptly announced, \"I shall go up to Paris to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no!\" she protested.\n\nOwen turned back to Anna. \"NOW do you say that nothing's happened?\"\n\nUnder the influence of his agitation Anna felt a vague tightening of\nthe heart. She seemed to herself like some one in a dark room about whom\nunseen presences are groping.\n\n\"If it's anything that Sophy wishes to tell you, no doubt she'll do\nso. I'm going down now, and I'll leave you here to talk it over by\nyourselves.\"\n\nAs she moved to the door the girl caught up with her. \"But there's\nnothing to tell: why should there be? I've explained that I simply want\nto be quiet.\" Her look seemed to detain Mrs. Leath.\n\nOwen broke in: \"Is that why I mayn't go up tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow!\"\n\n\"Then when may I?\"\n\n\"Later...in a little while...a few days...\"\n\n\"In how many days?\" \"Owen!\" his step-mother interposed; but he seemed\nno longer aware of her. \"If you go away today, the day that our\nengagement's made known, it's only fair,\" he persisted, \"that you should\ntell me when I am to see you.\"\n\nSophy's eyes wavered between the two and dropped down wearily. \"It's you\nwho are not fair--when I've said I wanted to be quiet.\"\n\n\"But why should my coming disturb you? I'm not asking now to come\ntomorrow. I only ask you not to leave without telling me when I'm to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Owen, I don't understand you!\" his step-mother exclaimed.\n\n\"You don't understand my asking for some explanation, some assurance,\nwhen I'm left in this way, without a word, without a sign? All I ask her\nto tell me is when she'll see me.\"\n\nAnna turned back to Sophy Viner, who stood straight and tremulous\nbetween the two.\n\n\"After all, my dear, he's not unreasonable!\"\n\n\"I'll write--I'll write,\" the girl repeated.\n\n\"WHAT will you write?\" he pressed her vehemently.\n\n\"Owen,\" Anna exclaimed, \"you are unreasonable!\"\n\nHe turned from Sophy to his step-mother. \"I only want her to say what\nshe means: that she's going to write to break off our engagement. Isn't\nthat what you're going away for?\"\n\nAnna felt the contagion of his excitement. She looked at Sophy, who\nstood motionless, her lips set, her whole face drawn to a silent fixity\nof resistance.\n\n\"You ought to speak, my dear--you ought to answer him.\"\n\n\"I only ask him to wait----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Owen, broke in, \"and you won't say how long!\"\n\nBoth instinctively addressed themselves to Anna, who stood, nearly as\nshaken as themselves, between the double shock of their struggle. She\nlooked again from Sophy's inscrutable eyes to Owen's stormy features;\nthen she said: \"What can I do, when there's clearly something between\nyou that I don't know about?\"\n\n\"Oh, if it WERE between us! Can't you see it's outside of us--outside\nof her, dragging at her, dragging her away from me?\" Owen wheeled round\nagain upon his step-mother.\n\nAnna turned from him to the girl. \"Is it true that you want to break\nyour engagement? If you do, you ought to tell him now.\"\n\nOwen burst into a laugh. \"She doesn't dare to--she's afraid I'll guess\nthe reason!\"\n\nA faint sound escaped from Sophy's lips, but she kept them close on\nwhatever answer she had ready.\n\n\"If she doesn't wish to marry you, why should she be afraid to have you\nknow the reason?\"\n\n\"She's afraid to have YOU know it--not me!\"\n\n\"To have ME know it?\"\n\nHe laughed again, and Anna, at his laugh, felt a sudden rush of\nindignation.\n\n\"Owen, you must explain what you mean!\"\n\nHe looked at her hard before answering; then: \"Ask Darrow!\" he said.\n\n\"Owen--Owen!\" Sophy Viner murmured.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nAnna stood looking from one to the other. It had become apparent to her\nin a flash that Owen's retort, though it startled Sophy, did not take\nher by surprise; and the discovery shot its light along dark distances\nof fear.\n\nThe immediate inference was that Owen had guessed the reason of Darrow's\ndisapproval of his marriage, or that, at least, he suspected Sophy Viner\nof knowing and dreading it. This confirmation of her own obscure\ndoubt sent a tremor of alarm through Anna. For a moment she felt like\nexclaiming: \"All this is really no business of mine, and I refuse to\nhave you mix me up in it--\" but her secret fear held her fast.\n\nSophy Viner was the first to speak.\n\n\"I should like to go now,\" she said in a low voice, taking a few steps\ntoward the door.\n\nHer tone woke Anna to the sense of her own share in the situation.\n\"I quite agree with you, my dear, that it's useless to carry on this\ndiscussion. But since Mr. Darrow's name has been brought into it, for\nreasons which I fail to guess, I want to tell you that you're both\nmistaken if you think he's not in sympathy with your marriage. If that's\nwhat Owen means to imply, the idea's a complete delusion.\"\n\nShe spoke the words deliberately and incisively, as if hoping that the\nsound of their utterance would stifle the whisper in her bosom.\n\nSophy's only answer was a vague murmur, and a movement that brought\nher nearer to the door; but before she could reach it Owen had placed\nhimself in her way.\n\n\"I don't mean to imply what you think,\" he said, addressing his\nstep-mother but keeping his eyes on the girl. \"I don't say Darrow\ndoesn't like our marriage; I say it's Sophy who's hated it since\nDarrow's been here!\"\n\nHe brought out the charge in a tone of forced composure, but his lips\nwere white and he grasped the doorknob to hide the tremor of his hand.\n\nAnna's anger surged up with her fears. \"You're absurd, Owen! I don't\nknow why I listen to you. Why should Sophy dislike Mr. Darrow, and if\nshe does, why should that have anything to do with her wishing to break\nher engagement?\"\n\n\"I don't say she dislikes him! I don't say she likes him; I don't know\nwhat it is they say to each other when they're shut up together alone.\"\n\n\"Shut up together alone?\" Anna stared. Owen seemed like a man in\ndelirium; such an exhibition was degrading to them all. But he pushed on\nwithout seeing her look.\n\n\"Yes--the first evening she came, in the study; the next morning, early,\nin the park; yesterday, again, in the spring-house, when you were at the\nlodge with the doctor...I don't know what they say to each other, but\nthey've taken every chance they could to say it...and to say it when\nthey thought that no one saw them.\"\n\nAnna longed to silence him, but no words came to her. It was as though\nall her confused apprehensions had suddenly taken definite shape. There\nwas \"something\"--yes, there was \"something\"...Darrow's reticences and\nevasions had been more than a figment of her doubts.\n\nThe next instant brought a recoil of pride. She turned indignantly on\nher step-son.\n\n\"I don't half understand what you've been saying; but what you seem to\nhint is so preposterous, and so insulting both to Sophy and to me, that\nI see no reason why we should listen to you any longer.\"\n\nThough her tone steadied Owen, she perceived at once that it would not\ndeflect him from his purpose. He spoke less vehemently, but with all the\nmore precision.\n\n\"How can it be preposterous, since it's true? Or insulting, since I\ndon't know, any more than YOU, the meaning of what I've been seeing?\nIf you'll be patient with me I'll try to put it quietly. What I mean is\nthat Sophy has completely changed since she met Darrow here, and that,\nhaving noticed the change, I'm hardly to blame for having tried to find\nout its cause.\"\n\nAnna made an effort to answer him with the same composure. \"You're to\nblame, at any rate, for so recklessly assuming that you HAVE found it\nout. You seem to forget that, till they met here, Sophy and Mr. Darrow\nhardly knew each other.\"\n\n\"If so, it's all the stranger that they've been so often closeted\ntogether!\"\n\n\"Owen, Owen--\" the girl sighed out.\n\nHe turned his haggard face to her. \"Can I help it, if I've seen and\nknown what I wasn't meant to? For God's sake give me a reason--any\nreason I can decently make out with! Is it my fault if, the day after\nyou arrived, when I came back late through the garden, the curtains of\nthe study hadn't been drawn, and I saw you there alone with Darrow?\"\n\nAnna laughed impatiently. \"Really, Owen, if you make it a grievance\nthat two people who are staying in the same house should be seen talking\ntogether----!\"\n\n\"They were not talking. That's the point----\"\n\n\"Not talking? How do you know? You could hardly hear them from the\ngarden!\"\n\n\"No; but I could see. HE was sitting at my desk, with his face in his\nhands. SHE was standing in the window, looking away from him...\"\n\nHe waited, as if for Sophy Viner's answer; but still she neither stirred\nnor spoke.\n\n\"That was the first time,\" he went on; \"and the second was the next\nmorning in the park. It was natural enough, their meeting there. Sophy\nhad gone out with Effie, and Effie ran back to look for me. She told\nme she'd left Sophy and Darrow in the path that leads to the river, and\npresently we saw them ahead of us. They didn't see us at first, because\nthey were standing looking at each other; and this time they were not\nspeaking either. We came up close before they heard us, and all that\ntime they never spoke, or stopped looking at each other. After that I\nbegan to wonder; and so I watched them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Owen!\" \"Oh, I only had to wait. Yesterday, when I motored you\nand the doctor back from the lodge, I saw Sophy coming out of the\nspring-house. I supposed she'd taken shelter from the rain, and when you\ngot out of the motor I strolled back down the avenue to meet her. But\nshe'd disappeared--she must have taken a short cut and come into the\nhouse by the side door. I don't know why I went on to the spring-house;\nI suppose it was what you'd call spying. I went up the steps and found\nthe room empty; but two chairs had been moved out from the wall and were\nstanding near the table; and one of the Chinese screens that lie on it\nhad dropped to the floor.\"\n\nAnna sounded a faint note of irony. \"Really? Sophy'd gone there for\nshelter, and she dropped a screen and moved a chair?\"\n\n\"I said two chairs----\"\n\n\"Two? What damning evidence--of I don't know what!\"\n\n\"Simply of the fact that Darrow'd been there with her. As I looked out\nof the window I saw him close by, walking away. He must have turned the\ncorner of the spring-house just as I got to the door.\"\n\nThere was another silence, during which Anna paused, not only to collect\nher own words but to wait for Sophy Viner's; then, as the girl made no\nsign, she turned to her.\n\n\"I've absolutely nothing to say to all this; but perhaps you'd like me\nto wait and hear your answer?\"\n\nSophy raised her head with a quick flash of colour. \"I've no answer\neither--except that Owen must be mad.\"\n\nIn the interval since she had last spoken she seemed to have regained\nher self-control, and her voice rang clear, with a cold edge of anger.\n\nAnna looked at her step-son. He had grown extremely pale, and his hand\nfell from the door with a discouraged gesture. \"That's all then? You\nwon't give me any reason?\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose it was necessary to give you or any one else a reason\nfor talking with a friend of Mrs. Leath's under Mrs. Leath's own roof.\"\n\nOwen hardly seemed to feel the retort: he kept his dogged stare on her\nface.\n\n\"I won't ask for one, then. I'll only ask you to give me your assurance\nthat your talks with Darrow have had nothing to do with your suddenly\ndeciding to leave Givre.\"\n\nShe hesitated, not so much with the air of weighing her answer as of\nquestioning his right to exact any. \"I give you my assurance; and now I\nshould like to go,\" she said.\n\nAs she turned away, Anna intervened. \"My dear, I think you ought to\nspeak.\"\n\nThe girl drew herself up with a faint laugh. \"To him--or to YOU?\"\n\n\"To him.\"\n\nShe stiffened. \"I've said all there is to say.\"\n\nAnna drew back, her eyes on her step-son. He had left the threshold and\nwas advancing toward Sophy Viner with a motion of desperate appeal; but\nas he did so there was a knock on the door. A moment's silence fell on\nthe three; then Anna said: \"Come in!\"\n\nDarrow came into the room. Seeing the three together, he looked rapidly\nfrom one to the other; then he turned to Anna with a smile.\n\n\"I came up to see if you were ready; but please send me off if I'm not\nwanted.\"\n\nHis look, his voice, the simple sense of his presence, restored Anna's\nshaken balance. By Owen's side he looked so strong, so urbane, so\nexperienced, that the lad's passionate charges dwindled to mere boyish\nvapourings. A moment ago she had dreaded Darrow's coming; now she was\nglad that he was there.\n\nShe turned to him with sudden decision. \"Come in, please; I want you to\nhear what Owen has been saying.\"\n\nShe caught a murmur from Sophy Viner, but disregarded it. An\nilluminating impulse urged her on. She, habitually so aware of her\nown lack of penetration, her small skill in reading hidden motives and\ndetecting secret signals, now felt herself mysteriously inspired. She\naddressed herself to Sophy Viner. \"It's much better for you both that\nthis absurd question should be cleared up now.\" Then, turning to Darrow,\nshe continued: \"For some reason that I don't pretend to guess, Owen has\ntaken it into his head that you've influenced Miss Viner to break her\nengagement.\"\n\nShe spoke slowly and deliberately, because she wished to give time and\nto gain it; time for Darrow and Sophy to receive the full impact of what\nshe was saying, and time to observe its full effect on them. She had\nsaid to herself: \"If there's nothing between them, they'll look at each\nother; if there IS something, they won't;\" and as she ceased to speak\nshe felt as if all her life were in her eyes.\n\nSophy, after a start of protest, remained motionless, her gaze on the\nground. Darrow, his face grown grave, glanced slowly from Owen Leath to\nAnna. With his eyes on the latter he asked: \"Has Miss Viner broken her\nengagement?\"\n\nA moment's silence followed his question; then the girl looked up and\nsaid: \"Yes!\"\n\nOwen, as she spoke, uttered a smothered exclamation and walked out of\nthe room. She continued to stand in the same place, without appearing\nto notice his departure, and without vouchsafing an additional word of\nexplanation; then, before Anna could find a cry to detain her, she too\nturned and went out.\n\n\"For God's sake, what's happened?\" Darrow asked; but Anna, with a drop\nof the heart, was saying to herself that he and Sophy Viner had not\nlooked at each other.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nAnna stood in the middle of the room, her eyes on the door. Darrow's\nquestioning gaze was still on her, and she said to herself with a\nquick-drawn breath: \"If only he doesn't come near me!\"\n\nIt seemed to her that she had been suddenly endowed with the fatal gift\nof reading the secret sense of every seemingly spontaneous look and\nmovement, and that in his least gesture of affection she would detect a\ncold design.\n\nFor a moment longer he continued to look at her enquiringly; then he\nturned away and took up his habitual stand by the mantel-piece. She drew\na deep breath of relief.\n\n\"Won't you please explain?\" he said.\n\n\"I can't explain: I don't know. I didn't even know--till she told\nyou--that she really meant to break her engagement. All I know is that\nshe came to me just now and said she wished to leave Givre today; and\nthat Owen, when he heard of it--for she hadn't told him--at once accused\nher of going away with the secret intention of throwing him over.\"\n\n\"And you think it's a definite break?\" She perceived, as she spoke, that\nhis brow had cleared.\n\n\"How should I know? Perhaps you can tell me.\"\n\n\"I?\" She fancied his face clouded again, but he did not move from his\ntranquil attitude.\n\n\"As I told you,\" she went on, \"Owen has worked himself up to imagining\nthat for some mysterious reason you've influenced Sophy against him.\"\n\nDarrow still visibly wondered. \"It must indeed be a mysterious reason!\nHe knows how slightly I know Miss Viner. Why should he imagine anything\nso wildly improbable?\"\n\n\"I don't know that either.\"\n\n\"But he must have hinted at some reason.\"\n\n\"No: he admits he doesn't know your reason. He simply says that Sophy's\nmanner to him has changed since she came back to Givre and that he's\nseen you together several times--in the park, the spring-house, I don't\nknow where--talking alone in a way that seemed confidential--almost\nsecret; and he draws the preposterous conclusion that you've used your\ninfluence to turn her against him.\"\n\n\"My influence? What kind of influence?\"\n\n\"He doesn't say.\"\n\nDarrow again seemed to turn over the facts she gave him. His face\nremained grave, but without the least trace of discomposure. \"And what\ndoes Miss Viner say?\"\n\n\"She says it's perfectly natural that she should occasionally talk to\nmy friends when she's under my roof--and refuses to give him any other\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"That at least is perfectly natural!\"\n\nAnna felt her cheeks flush as she answered: \"Yes--but there is\nsomething----\"\n\n\"Something----?\"\n\n\"Some reason for her sudden decision to break her engagement. I can\nunderstand Owen's feeling, sorry as I am for his way of showing it. The\ngirl owes him some sort of explanation, and as long as she refuses to\ngive it his imagination is sure to run wild.\"\n\n\"She would have given it, no doubt, if he'd asked it in a different\ntone.\"\n\n\"I don't defend Owen's tone--but she knew what it was before she\naccepted him. She knows he's excitable and undisciplined.\"\n\n\"Well, she's been disciplining him a little--probably the best thing\nthat could happen. Why not let the matter rest there?\"\n\n\"Leave Owen with the idea that you HAVE been the cause of the break?\"\n\nHe met the question with his easy smile. \"Oh, as to that--leave him with\nany idea of me he chooses! But leave him, at any rate, free.\"\n\n\"Free?\" she echoed in surprise.\n\n\"Simply let things be. You've surely done all you could for him and Miss\nViner. If they don't hit it off it's their own affair. What possible\nmotive can you have for trying to interfere now?\"\n\nHer gaze widened to a deeper wonder. \"Why--naturally, what he says of\nyou!\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw what he says of me! In such a situation a boy in\nlove will snatch at the most far-fetched reason rather than face the\nmortifying fact that the lady may simply be tired of him.\"\n\n\"You don t quite understand Owen. Things go deep with him, and last\nlong. It took him a long time to recover from his other unlucky love\naffair. He's romantic and extravagant: he can't live on the interest\nof his feelings. He worships Sophy and she seemed to be fond of him. If\nshe's changed it's been very sudden. And if they part like this, angrily\nand inarticulately, it will hurt him horribly--hurt his very soul.\nBut that, as you say, is between the two. What concerns me is his\nassociating you with their quarrel. Owen's like my own son--if you'd\nseen him when I first came here you'd know why. We were like two\nprisoners who talk to each other by tapping on the wall. He's never\nforgotten it, nor I. Whether he breaks with Sophy, or whether they make\nit up, I can't let him think you had anything to do with it.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes entreatingly to Darrow's, and read in them the\nforbearance of the man resigned to the discussion of non-existent\nproblems.\n\n\"I'll do whatever you want me to,\" he said; \"but I don't yet know what\nit is.\"\n\nHis smile seemed to charge her with inconsequence, and the prick to her\npride made her continue: \"After all, it's not so unnatural that Owen,\nknowing you and Sophy to be almost strangers, should wonder what you\nwere saying to each other when he saw you talking together.\"\n\nShe felt a warning tremor as she spoke, as though some instinct deeper\nthan reason surged up in defense of its treasure. But Darrow's face was\nunstirred save by the flit of his half-amused smile.\n\n\"Well, my dear--and couldn't you have told him?\" \"I?\" she faltered out\nthrough her blush.\n\n\"You seem to forget, one and all of you, the position you put me in when\nI came down here: your appeal to me to see Owen through, your assurance\nto him that I would, Madame de Chantelle's attempt to win me over; and\nmost of all, my own sense of the fact you've just recalled to me: the\nimportance, for both of us, that Owen should like me. It seemed to me\nthat the first thing to do was to get as much light as I could on the\nwhole situation; and the obvious way of doing it was to try to know Miss\nViner better. Of course I've talked with her alone--I've talked with her\nas often as I could. I've tried my best to find out if you were right in\nencouraging Owen to marry her.\"\n\nShe listened with a growing sense of reassurance, struggling to separate\nthe abstract sense of his words from the persuasion in which his eyes\nand voice enveloped them.\n\n\"I see--I do see,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You must see, also, that I could hardly say this to Owen without\noffending him still more, and perhaps increasing the breach between Miss\nViner and himself. What sort of figure should I cut if I told him I'd\nbeen trying to find out if he'd made a proper choice? In any case, it's\nnone of my business to offer an explanation of what she justly says\ndoesn't need one. If she declines to speak, it's obviously on the ground\nthat Owen's insinuations are absurd; and that surely pledges me to\nsilence.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! I see,\" Anna repeated. \"But I don't want you to explain\nanything to Owen.\"\n\n\"You haven't yet told me what you do want.\"\n\nShe hesitated, conscious of the difficulty of justifying her request;\nthen: \"I want you to speak to Sophy,\" she said.\n\nDarrow broke into an incredulous laugh. \"Considering what my previous\nattempts have resulted in----!\"\n\nShe raised her eyes quickly. \"They haven't, at least, resulted in your\nliking her less, in your thinking less well of her than you've told me?\"\n\nShe fancied he frowned a little. \"I wonder why you go back to that?\"\n\n\"I want to be sure--I owe it to Owen. Won't you tell me the exact\nimpression she's produced on you?\"\n\n\"I have told you--I like Miss Viner.\"\n\n\"Do you still believe she's in love with Owen?\"\n\n\"There was nothing in our short talks to throw any particular light on\nthat.\"\n\n\"You still believe, though, that there's no reason why he shouldn't\nmarry her?\"\n\nAgain he betrayed a restrained impatience. \"How can I answer that\nwithout knowing her reasons for breaking with him?\"\n\n\"That's just what I want you to find out from her.\"\n\n\"And why in the world should she tell me?\"\n\n\"Because, whatever grievance she has against Owen, she can certainly\nhave none against me. She can't want to have Owen connect me in his mind\nwith this wretched quarrel; and she must see that he will until he's\nconvinced you've had no share in it.\"\n\nDarrow's elbow dropped from the mantel-piece and he took a restless step\nor two across the room. Then he halted before her.\n\n\"Why can't you tell her this yourself?\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\"\n\nHe eyed her intently, and she pressed on: \"You must have guessed that\nOwen's jealous of you.\"\n\n\"Jealous of me?\" The blood flew up under his brown skin.\n\n\"Blind with it--what else would drive him to this folly? And I can't\nhave her think me jealous too! I've said all I could, short of making\nher think so; and she's refused a word more to either of us. Our only\nchance now is that she should listen to you--that you should make her\nsee the harm her silence may do.\"\n\nDarrow uttered a protesting exclamation. \"It's all too\npreposterous--what you suggest! I can't, at any rate, appeal to her on\nsuch a ground as that!\"\n\nAnna laid her hand on his arm. \"Appeal to her on the ground that I'm\nalmost Owen's mother, and that any estrangement between you and him\nwould kill me. She knows what he is--she'll understand. Tell her to say\nanything, do anything, she wishes; but not to go away without speaking,\nnot to leave THAT between us when she goes!\"\n\nShe drew back a step and lifted her face to his, trying to look into his\neyes more deeply than she had ever looked; but before she could discern\nwhat they expressed he had taken hold of her hands and bent his head to\nkiss them.\n\n\"You'll see her? You'll see her?\" she entreated; and he answered: \"I'll\ndo anything in the world you want me to.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nDarrow waited alone in the sitting-room.\n\nNo place could have been more distasteful as the scene of the talk that\nlay before him; but he had acceded to Anna's suggestion that it would\nseem more natural for her to summon Sophy Viner than for him to go in\nsearch of her. As his troubled pacings carried him back and forth a\nrelentless hand seemed to be tearing away all the tender fibres of\nassociation that bound him to the peaceful room. Here, in this very\nplace, he had drunk his deepest draughts of happiness, had had his lips\nat the fountain-head of its overflowing rivers; but now that source was\npoisoned and he would taste no more of an untainted cup.\n\nFor a moment he felt an actual physical anguish; then his nerves\nhardened for the coming struggle. He had no notion of what awaited him;\nbut after the first instinctive recoil he had seen in a flash the urgent\nneed of another word with Sophy Viner. He had been insincere in letting\nAnna think that he had consented to speak because she asked it. In\nreality he had been feverishly casting about for the pretext she had\ngiven him; and for some reason this trivial hypocrisy weighed on him\nmore than all his heavy burden of deceit.\n\nAt length he heard a step behind him and Sophy Viner entered. When she\nsaw him she paused on the threshold and half drew back.\n\n\"I was told that Mrs. Leath had sent for me.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Leath DID send for you. She'll be here presently; but I asked her\nto let me see you first.\"\n\nHe spoke very gently, and there was no insincerity in his gentleness. He\nwas profoundly moved by the change in the girl's appearance. At sight\nof him she had forced a smile; but it lit up her wretchedness like a\ncandle-flame held to a dead face.\n\nShe made no reply, and Darrow went on: \"You must understand my wanting\nto speak to you, after what I was told just now.\"\n\nShe interposed, with a gesture of protest: \"I'm not responsible for\nOwen's ravings!\"\n\n\"Of course----\". He broke off and they stood facing each other. She\nlifted a hand and pushed back her loose lock with the gesture that was\nburnt into his memory; then she looked about her and dropped into the\nnearest chair.\n\n\"Well, you've got what you wanted,\" she said.\n\n\"What do you mean by what I wanted?\"\n\n\"My engagement's broken--you heard me say so.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that's what I wanted? All I wished, from the beginning,\nwas to advise you, to help you as best I could----\"\n\n\"That's what you've done,\" she rejoined. \"You've convinced me that it's\nbest I shouldn't marry him.\"\n\nDarrow broke into a despairing laugh. \"At the very moment when you'd\nconvinced me to the contrary!\"\n\n\"Had I?\" Her smile flickered up. \"Well, I really believed it till you\nshowed me...warned me...\"\n\n\"Warned you?\"\n\n\"That I'd be miserable if I married a man I didn't love.\"\n\n\"Don't you love him?\"\n\nShe made no answer, and Darrow started up and walked away to the\nother end of the room. He stopped before the writing-table, where his\nphotograph, well-dressed, handsome, self-sufficient--the portrait of a\nman of the world, confident of his ability to deal adequately with\nthe most delicate situations--offered its huge fatuity to his gaze. He\nturned back to her. \"It's rather hard on Owen, isn't it, that you should\nhave waited until now to tell him?\"\n\nShe reflected a moment before answering. \"I told him as soon as I knew.\"\n\n\"Knew that you couldn't marry him?\"\n\n\"Knew that I could never live here with him.\" She looked about the room,\nas though the very walls must speak for her.\n\nFor a moment Darrow continued to search her face perplexedly; then their\neyes met in a long disastrous gaze.\n\n\"Yes----\" she said, and stood up.\n\nBelow the window they heard Effie whistling for her dogs, and then, from\nthe terrace, her mother calling her.\n\n\"There--THAT for instance,\" Sophy Viner said.\n\nDarrow broke out: \"It's I who ought to go!\"\n\nShe kept her small pale smile. \"What good would that do any of us--now?\"\n\nHe covered his face with his hands. \"Good God!\" he groaned. \"How could I\ntell?\"\n\n\"You couldn't tell. We neither of us could.\" She seemed to turn the\nproblem over critically. \"After all, it might have been YOU instead of\nme!\"\n\nHe took another distracted turn about the room and coming back to her\nsat down in a chair at her side. A mocking hand seemed to dash the words\nfrom his lips. There was nothing on earth that he could say to her that\nwasn't foolish or cruel or contemptible...\n\n\"My dear,\" he began at last, \"oughtn't you, at any rate, to try?\"\n\nHer gaze grew grave. \"Try to forget you?\"\n\nHe flushed to the forehead. \"I meant, try to give Owen more time; to\ngive him a chance. He's madly in love with you; all the good that's in\nhim is in your hands. His step-mother felt that from the first. And she\nthought--she believed----\"\n\n\"She thought I could make him happy. Would she think so now?\"\n\n\"Now...? I don't say now. But later? Time modifies...rubs out...more\nquickly than you think...Go away, but let him hope...I'm going\ntoo--WE'RE going--\" he stumbled on the plural--\"in a very few weeks:\ngoing for a long time, probably. What you're thinking of now may never\nhappen. We may not all be here together again for years.\"\n\nShe heard him out in silence, her hands clasped on her knee, her eyes\nbent on them. \"For me,\" she said, \"you'll always be here.\"\n\n\"Don't say that--oh, don't! Things change...people change...You'll see!\"\n\n\"You don't understand. I don't want anything to change. I don't want to\nforget--to rub out. At first I imagined I did; but that was a foolish\nmistake. As soon as I saw you again I knew it...It's not being here\nwith you that I'm afraid of--in the sense you think. It's being here, or\nanywhere, with Owen.\" She stood up and bent her tragic smile on him. \"I\nwant to keep you all to myself.\"\n\nThe only words that came to him were futile denunciations of his\nfolly; but the sense of their futility checked them on his lips. \"Poor\nchild--you poor child!\" he heard himself vainly repeating.\n\nSuddenly he felt the strong reaction of reality and its impetus brought\nhim to his feet. \"Whatever happens, I intend to go--to go for good,\"\nhe exclaimed. \"I want you to understand that. Oh, don't be afraid--I'll\nfind a reason. But it's perfectly clear that I must go.\"\n\nShe uttered a protesting cry. \"Go away? You? Don't you see that that\nwould tell everything--drag everybody into the horror?\"\n\nHe found no answer, and her voice dropped back to its calmer note. \"What\ngood would your going do? Do you suppose it would change anything for\nme?\" She looked at him with a musing wistfulness. \"I wonder what your\nfeeling for me was? It seems queer that I've never really known--I\nsuppose we DON'T know much about that kind of feeling. Is it like taking\na drink when you're thirsty?...I used to feel as if all of me was in the\npalm of your hand...\"\n\nHe bowed his humbled head, but she went on almost exultantly: \"Don't for\na minute think I'm sorry! It was worth every penny it cost. My mistake\nwas in being ashamed, just at first, of its having cost such a lot.\nI tried to carry it off as a joke--to talk of it to myself as an\n'adventure'. I'd always wanted adventures, and you'd given me one, and\nI tried to take your attitude about it, to 'play the game' and convince\nmyself that I hadn't risked any more on it than you. Then, when I met\nyou again, I suddenly saw that I HAD risked more, but that I'd won more,\ntoo--such worlds! I'd been trying all the while to put everything I\ncould between us; now I want to sweep everything away. I'd been trying\nto forget how you looked; now I want to remember you always. I'd been\ntrying not to hear your voice; now I never want to hear any other. I've\nmade my choice--that's all: I've had you and I mean to keep you.\" Her\nface was shining like her eyes. \"To keep you hidden away here,\" she\nended, and put her hand upon her breast.\n\nAfter she had left him, Darrow continued to sit motionless, staring back\ninto their past. Hitherto it had lingered on the edge of his mind in a\nvague pink blur, like one of the little rose-leaf clouds that a setting\nsun drops from its disk. Now it was a huge looming darkness, through\nwhich his eyes vainly strained. The whole episode was still obscure to\nhim, save where here and there, as they talked, some phrase or gesture\nor intonation of the girl's had lit up a little spot in the night.\n\nShe had said: \"I wonder what your feeling for me was?\" and he found\nhimself wondering too...He remembered distinctly enough that he had not\nmeant the perilous passion--even in its most transient form--to play\na part in their relation. In that respect his attitude had been above\nreproach. She was an unusually original and attractive creature, to whom\nhe had wanted to give a few days of harmless pleasuring, and who was\nalert and expert enough to understand his intention and spare him the\nboredom of hesitations and misinterpretations. That had been his first\nimpression, and her subsequent demeanour had justified it. She had been,\nfrom the outset, just the frank and easy comrade he had expected to find\nher. Was it he, then, who, in the sequel, had grown impatient of the\nbounds he had set himself? Was it his wounded vanity that, seeking\nbalm for its hurt, yearned to dip deeper into the healing pool of her\ncompassion? In his confused memory of the situation he seemed not to\nhave been guiltless of such yearnings...Yet for the first few days\nthe experiment had been perfectly successful. Her enjoyment had been\nunclouded and his pleasure in it undisturbed. It was very gradually--he\nseemed to see--that a shade of lassitude had crept over their\nintercourse. Perhaps it was because, when her light chatter about people\nfailed, he found she had no other fund to draw on, or perhaps simply\nbecause of the sweetness of her laugh, or of the charm of the gesture\nwith which, one day in the woods of Marly, she had tossed off her hat\nand tilted back her head at the call of a cuckoo; or because, whenever\nhe looked at her unexpectedly, he found that she was looking at him and\ndid not want him to know it; or perhaps, in varying degrees, because of\nall these things, that there had come a moment when no word seemed to\nfly high enough or dive deep enough to utter the sense of well-being\neach gave to the other, and the natural substitute for speech had been a\nkiss.\n\nThe kiss, at all events, had come at the precise moment to save their\nventure from disaster. They had reached the point when her amazing\nreminiscences had begun to flag, when her future had been exhaustively\ndiscussed, her theatrical prospects minutely studied, her quarrel with\nMrs. Murrett retold with the last amplification of detail, and when,\nperhaps conscious of her exhausted resources and his dwindling interest,\nshe had committed the fatal error of saying that she could see he was\nunhappy, and entreating him to tell her why...\n\nFrom the brink of estranging confidences, and from the risk of\nunfavourable comparisons, his gesture had snatched her back to safety;\nand as soon as he had kissed her he felt that she would never bore him\nagain. She was one of the elemental creatures whose emotion is all in\ntheir pulses, and who become inexpressive or sentimental when they\ntry to turn sensation into speech. His caress had restored her to her\nnatural place in the scheme of things, and Darrow felt as if he had\nclasped a tree and a nymph had bloomed from it...\n\nThe mere fact of not having to listen to her any longer added immensely\nto her charm. She continued, of course, to talk to him, but it didn't\nmatter, because he no longer made any effort to follow her words, but\nlet her voice run on as a musical undercurrent to his thoughts.\n\nShe hadn't a drop of poetry in her, but she had some of the qualities\nthat create it in others; and in moments of heat the imagination does\nnot always feel the difference...\n\nLying beside her in the shade, Darrow felt her presence as a part of\nthe charmed stillness of the summer woods, as the element of vague\nwell-being that suffused his senses and lulled to sleep the ache of\nwounded pride. All he asked of her, as yet, was a touch on the hand or\non the lips--and that she should let him go on lying there through the\nlong warm hours, while a black-bird's song throbbed like a fountain, and\nthe summer wind stirred in the trees, and close by, between the nearest\nbranches and the brim of his tilted hat, a slight white figure gathered\nup all the floating threads of joy...\n\nHe recalled, too, having noticed, as he lay staring at a break in the\ntree-tops, a stream of mares'-tails coming up the sky. He had said to\nhimself: \"It will rain to-morrow,\" and the thought had made the air seem\nwarmer and the sun more vivid on her hair...Perhaps if the mares'-tails\nhad not come up the sky their adventure might have had no sequel. But\nthe cloud brought rain, and next morning he looked out of his window\ninto a cold grey blur. They had planned an all-day excursion down the\nSeine, to the two Andelys and Rouen, and now, with the long hours on\ntheir hands, they were both a little at a loss...There was the Louvre,\nof course, and the Luxembourg; but he had tried looking at pictures with\nher, she had first so persistently admired the worst things, and then\nso frankly lapsed into indifference, that he had no wish to repeat\nthe experiment. So they went out, aimlessly, and took a cold wet walk,\nturning at length into the deserted arcades of the Palais Royal, and\nfinally drifting into one of its equally deserted restaurants, where\nthey lunched alone and somewhat dolefully, served by a wan old waiter\nwith the look of a castaway who has given up watching for a sail...It\nwas odd how the waiter's face came back to him...\n\nPerhaps but for the rain it might never have happened; but what was\nthe use of thinking of that now? He tried to turn his thoughts to more\nurgent issues; but, by a strange perversity of association, every detail\nof the day was forcing itself on his mind with an insistence from which\nthere was no escape. Reluctantly he relived the long wet walk back\nto the hotel, after a tedious hour at a cinematograph show on the\nBoulevard. It was still raining when they withdrew from this stale\nspectacle, but she had obstinately refused to take a cab, had even,\non the way, insisted on loitering under the dripping awnings of\nshop-windows and poking into draughty passages, and finally, when they\nhad nearly reached their destination, had gone so far as to suggest that\nthey should turn back to hunt up some show she had heard of in a theatre\nat the Batignolles. But at that he had somewhat irritably protested: he\nremembered that, for the first time, they were both rather irritable,\nand vaguely disposed to resist one another's suggestions. His feet\nwere wet, and he was tired of walking, and sick of the smell of stuffy\nunaired theatres, and he had said he must really get back to write some\nletters--and so they had kept on to the hotel...\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nDarrow had no idea how long he had sat there when he heard Anna's hand\non the door. The effort of rising, and of composing his face to meet\nher, gave him a factitious sense of self-control. He said to himself: \"I\nmust decide on something----\" and that lifted him a hair's breadth above\nthe whirling waters.\n\nShe came in with a lighter step, and he instantly perceived that\nsomething unforeseen and reassuring had happened.\n\n\"She's been with me. She came and found me on the terrace. We've had a\nlong talk and she's explained everything. I feel as if I'd never known\nher before!\"\n\nHer voice was so moved and tender that it checked his start of\napprehension.\n\n\"She's explained----?\"\n\n\"It's natural, isn't it, that she should have felt a little sore at the\nkind of inspection she's been subjected to? Oh, not from you--I don't\nmean that! But Madame de Chantelle's opposition--and her sending for\nAdelaide Painter! She told me frankly she didn't care to owe her husband\nto Adelaide Painter...She thinks now that her annoyance at feeling\nherself so talked over and scrutinized may have shown itself in her\nmanner to Owen, and set him imagining the insane things he did...I\nunderstand all she must have felt, and I agree with her that it's best\nshe should go away for a while. She's made me,\" Anna summed up, \"feel as\nif I'd been dreadfully thick-skinned and obtuse!\"\n\n\"YOU?\"\n\n\"Yes. As if I'd treated her like the bric-a-brac that used to be sent\ndown here 'on approval,' to see if it would look well with the other\npieces.\" She added, with a sudden flush of enthusiasm: \"I'm glad she's\ngot it in her to make one feel like that!\"\n\nShe seemed to wait for Darrow to agree with her, or to put some other\nquestion, and he finally found voice to ask: \"Then you think it's not a\nfinal break?\"\n\n\"I hope not--I've never hoped it more! I had a word with Owen, too,\nafter I left her, and I think he understands that he must let her go\nwithout insisting on any positive promise. She's excited...he must let\nher calm down...\"\n\nAgain she waited, and Darrow said: \"Surely you can make him see that.\"\n\n\"She'll help me to--she's to see him, of course, before she goes. She\nstarts immediately, by the way, with Adelaide Painter, who is motoring\nover to Francheuil to catch the one o'clock express--and who, of course,\nknows nothing of all this, and is simply to be told that Sophy has been\nsent for by the Farlows.\"\n\nDarrow mutely signed his comprehension, and she went on: \"Owen is\nparticularly anxious that neither Adelaide nor his grandmother should\nhave the least inkling of what's happened. The need of shielding Sophy\nwill help him to control himself. He's coming to his senses, poor boy;\nhe's ashamed of his wild talk already. He asked me to tell you so; no\ndoubt he'll tell you so himself.\"\n\nDarrow made a movement of protest. \"Oh, as to that--the thing's not\nworth another word.\"\n\n\"Or another thought, either?\" She brightened. \"Promise me you won't even\nthink of it--promise me you won't be hard on him!\"\n\nHe was finding it easier to smile back at her. \"Why should you think it\nnecessary to ask my indulgence for Owen?\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment, her eyes wandering from him. Then they came back\nwith a smile. \"Perhaps because I need it for myself.\"\n\n\"For yourself?\"\n\n\"I mean, because I understand better how one can torture one's self over\nunrealities.\"\n\nAs Darrow listened, the tension of his nerves began to relax. Her gaze,\nso grave and yet so sweet, was like a deep pool into which he could\nplunge and hide himself from the hard glare of his misery. As this\necstatic sense enveloped him he found it more and more difficult to\nfollow her words and to frame an answer; but what did anything matter,\nexcept that her voice should go on, and the syllables fall like soft\ntouches on his tortured brain?\n\n\"Don't you know,\" she continued, \"the bliss of waking from a bad dream\nin one's own quiet room, and going slowly over all the horror without\nbeing afraid of it any more? That's what I'm doing now. And that's why\nI understand Owen...\" She broke off, and he felt her touch on his arm.\n\"BECAUSE I'D DREAMED THE HORROR TOO!\"\n\nHe understood her then, and stammered: \"You?\"\n\n\"Forgive me! And let me tell you!...It will help you to understand\nOwen...There WERE little things...little signs...once I had begun to\nwatch for them: your reluctance to speak about her...her reserve with\nyou...a sort of constraint we'd never seen in her before...\"\n\nShe laughed up at him, and with her hands in his he contrived to say:\n\"NOW you understand why?\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand; of course I understand; and I want you to laugh\nat me--with me! Because there were other things too...crazier things\nstill...There was even--last night on the terrace--her pink cloak...\"\n\n\"Her pink cloak?\" Now he honestly wondered, and as she saw it she\nblushed.\n\n\"You've forgotten about the cloak? The pink cloak that Owen saw you with\nat the play in Paris? Yes...yes...I was mad enough for that!...It does\nme good to laugh about it now! But you ought to know that I'm going\nto be a jealous woman...a ridiculously jealous woman...you ought to be\nwarned of it in time...\"\n\nHe had dropped her hands, and she leaned close and lifted her arms to\nhis neck with one of her rare gestures of surrender.\n\n\"I don't know why it is; but it makes me happier now to have been so\nfoolish!\"\n\nHer lips were parted in a noiseless laugh and the tremor of her lashes\nmade their shadow move on her cheek. He looked at her through a mist of\npain and saw all her offered beauty held up like a cup to his lips; but\nas he stooped to it a darkness seemed to fall between them, her arms\nslipped from his shoulders and she drew away from him abruptly.\n\n\"But she WAS with you, then?\" she exclaimed; and then, as he stared at\nher: \"Oh, don't say no! Only go and look at your eyes!\"\n\nHe stood speechless, and she pressed on: \"Don't deny it--oh, don't deny\nit! What will be left for me to imagine if you do? Don't you see how\nevery single thing cries it out? Owen sees it--he saw it again just now!\nWhen I told him she'd relented, and would see him, he said: 'Is that\nDarrow's doing too?'\"\n\nDarrow took the onslaught in silence. He might have spoken, have\nsummoned up the usual phrases of banter and denial; he was not even\ncertain that they might not, for the moment, have served their purpose\nif he could have uttered them without being seen. But he was as\nconscious of what had happened to his face as if he had obeyed Anna's\nbidding and looked at himself in the glass. He knew he could no more\nhide from her what was written there than he could efface from his soul\nthe fiery record of what he had just lived through. There before him,\nstaring him in the eyes, and reflecting itself in all his lineaments,\nwas the overwhelming fact of Sophy Viner's passion and of the act by\nwhich she had attested it.\n\nAnna was talking again, hurriedly, feverishly, and his soul was wrung\nby the anguish in her voice. \"Do speak at last--you must speak! I don't\nwant to ask you to harm the girl; but you must see that your silence\nis doing her more harm than your answering my questions could. You're\nleaving me only the worst things to think of her...she'd see that\nherself if she were here. What worse injury can you do her than to make\nme hate her--to make me feel she's plotted with you to deceive us?\"\n\n\"Oh, not that!\" Darrow heard his own voice before he was aware that he\nmeant to speak. \"Yes; I did see her in Paris,\" he went on after a pause;\n\"but I was bound to respect her reason for not wanting it known.\"\n\nAnna paled. \"It was she at the theatre that night?\"\n\n\"I was with her at the theatre one night.\"\n\n\"Why should she have asked you not to say so?\"\n\n\"She didn't wish it known that I'd met her.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she have wished it known?\"\n\n\"She had quarrelled with Mrs. Murrett and come over suddenly to Paris,\nand she didn't want the Farlows to hear of it. I came across her by\naccident, and she asked me not to speak of having seen her.\"\n\n\"Because of her quarrel? Because she was ashamed of her part in it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. There was nothing for her to be ashamed of. But the Farlows had\nfound the place for her, and she didn't want them to know how suddenly\nshe'd had to leave, and how badly Mrs. Murrett had behaved. She was in\na terrible plight--the woman had even kept back her month's salary. She\nknew the Farlows would be awfully upset, and she wanted more time to\nprepare them.\"\n\nDarrow heard himself speak as though the words had proceeded from other\nlips. His explanation sounded plausible enough, and he half-fancied\nAnna's look grew lighter. She waited a moment, as though to be sure he\nhad no more to add; then she said: \"But the Farlows DID know; they told\nme all about it when they sent her to me.\"\n\nHe flushed as if she had laid a deliberate trap for him. \"They may know\nNOW; they didn't then----\"\n\n\"That's no reason for her continuing now to make a mystery of having met\nyou.\"\n\n\"It's the only reason I can give you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go and ask her for one myself.\" She turned and took a few\nsteps toward the door.\n\n\"Anna!\" He started to follow her, and then checked himself. \"Don't do\nthat!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It's not like you...not generous...\"\n\nShe stood before him straight and pale, but under her rigid face he saw\nthe tumult of her doubt and misery.\n\n\"I don't want to be ungenerous; I don't want to pry into her secrets.\nBut things can't be left like this. Wouldn't it be better for me to go\nto her? Surely she'll understand--she'll explain...It may be some mere\ntrifle she's concealing: something that would horrify the Farlows, but\nthat I shouldn't see any harm in...\" She paused, her eyes searching his\nface. \"A love affair, I suppose...that's it? You met her with some man\nat the theatre--and she was frightened and begged you to fib about\nit? Those poor young things that have to go about among us like\nmachines--oh, if you knew how I pity them!\"\n\n\"If you pity her, why not let her go?\"\n\nShe stared. \"Let her go--go for good, you mean? Is that the best you can\nsay for her?\"\n\n\"Let things take their course. After all, it's between herself and\nOwen.\"\n\n\"And you and me--and Effie, if Owen marries her, and I leave my child\nwith them! Don't you see the impossibility of what you're asking? We're\nall bound together in this coil.\"\n\nDarrow turned away with a groan. \"Oh, let her go--let her go.\"\n\n\"Then there IS something--something really bad? She WAS with some one\nwhen you met her? Some one with whom she was----\" She broke off, and\nhe saw her struggling with new thoughts. \"If it's THAT, of course...Oh,\ndon't you see,\" she desperately appealed to him, \"that I must find out,\nand that it's too late now for you not to speak? Don't be afraid that\nI'll betray you...I'll never, never let a soul suspect. But I must know\nthe truth, and surely it's best for her that I should find it out from\nyou.\"\n\nDarrow waited a moment; then he said slowly: \"What you imagine's mere\nmadness. She was at the theatre with me.\"\n\n\"With you?\" He saw a tremor pass through her, but she controlled it\ninstantly and faced him straight and motionless as a wounded creature in\nthe moment before it feels its wound. \"Why should you both have made a\nmystery of that?\"\n\n\"I've told you the idea was not mine.\" He cast about. \"She may have been\nafraid that Owen----\"\n\n\"But that was not a reason for her asking you to tell me that you hardly\nknew her--that you hadn't even seen her for years.\" She broke off and\nthe blood rose to her face and forehead. \"Even if SHE had other reasons,\nthere could be only one reason for your obeying her----\" Silence fell\nbetween them, a silence in which the room seemed to become suddenly\nresonant with voices. Darrow's gaze wandered to the window and he\nnoticed that the gale of two days before had nearly stripped the tops\nof the lime-trees in the court. Anna had moved away and was resting her\nelbows against the mantel-piece, her head in her hands. As she stood\nthere he took in with a new intensity of vision little details of her\nappearance that his eyes had often cherished: the branching blue veins\nin the backs of her hands, the warm shadow that her hair cast on\nher ear, and the colour of the hair itself, dull black with a tawny\nunder-surface, like the wings of certain birds. He felt it to be useless\nto speak.\n\nAfter a while she lifted her head and said: \"I shall not see her again\nbefore she goes.\"\n\nHe made no answer, and turning to him she added: \"That is why she's\ngoing, I suppose? Because she loves you and won't give you up?\"\n\nDarrow waited. The paltriness of conventional denial was so apparent to\nhim that even if it could have delayed discovery he could no longer have\nresorted to it. Under all his other fears was the dread of dishonouring\nthe hour.\n\n\"She HAS given me up,\" he said at last.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nWhen he had gone out of the room Anna stood where he had left her. \"I\nmust believe him! I must believe him!\" she said.\n\nA moment before, at the moment when she had lifted her arms to his neck,\nshe had been wrapped in a sense of complete security. All the spirits\nof doubt had been exorcised, and her love was once more the clear\nhabitation in which every thought and feeling could move in blissful\nfreedom. And then, as she raised her face to Darrow's and met his eyes,\nshe had seemed to look into the very ruins of his soul. That was the\nonly way she could express it. It was as though he and she had been\nlooking at two sides of the same thing, and the side she had seen had\nbeen all light and life, and his a place of graves...\n\nShe didn't now recall who had spoken first, or even, very clearly, what\nhad been said. It seemed to her only a moment later that she had found\nherself standing at the other end of the room--the room which had\nsuddenly grown so small that, even with its length between them, she\nfelt as if he touched her--crying out to him \"It IS because of you she's\ngoing!\" and reading the avowal in his face.\n\nThat was his secret, then, THEIR secret: he had met the girl in\nParis and helped her in her straits--lent her money, Anna vaguely\nconjectured--and she had fallen in love with him, and on meeting him\nagain had been suddenly overmastered by her passion. Anna, dropping back\ninto her sofa-corner, sat staring these facts in the face.\n\nThe girl had been in a desperate plight--frightened, penniless, outraged\nby what had happened, and not knowing (with a woman like Mrs. Murrett)\nwhat fresh injury might impend; and Darrow, meeting her in this\ndistracted hour, had pitied, counselled, been kind to her, with the\nfatal, the inevitable result. There were the facts as Anna made them\nout: that, at least, was their external aspect, was as much of them as\nshe had been suffered to see; and into the secret intricacies they might\ncover she dared not yet project her thoughts.\n\n\"I must believe him...I must believe him...\" She kept on repeating the\nwords like a talisman. It was natural, after all, that he should have\nbehaved as he had: defended the girl's piteous secret to the last. She\ntoo began to feel the contagion of his pity--the stir, in her breast, of\nfeelings deeper and more native to her than the pains of jealousy.\nFrom the security of her blessedness she longed to lean over with\ncompassionate hands...But Owen? What was Owen's part to be? She owed\nherself first to him--she was bound to protect him not only from all\nknowledge of the secret she had surprised, but also--and chiefly!--from\nits consequences. Yes: the girl must go--there could be no doubt of\nit--Darrow himself had seen it from the first; and at the thought she\nhad a wild revulsion of relief, as though she had been trying to create\nin her heart the delusion of a generosity she could not feel...\n\nThe one fact on which she could stay her mind was that Sophy was leaving\nimmediately; would be out of the house within an hour. Once she was\ngone, it would be easier to bring Owen to the point of understanding\nthat the break was final; if necessary, to work upon the girl to make\nhim see it. But that, Anna was sure, would not be necessary. It was\nclear that Sophy Viner was leaving Givre with no thought of ever seeing\nit again...\n\nSuddenly, as she tried to put some order in her thoughts, she heard\nOwen's call at the door: \"Mother!----\" a name he seldom gave her. There\nwas a new note in his voice: the note of a joyous impatience. It made\nher turn hastily to the glass to see what face she was about to show\nhim; but before she had had time to compose it he was in the room and\nshe was caught in a school-boy hug.\n\n\"It's all right! It's all right! And it's all your doing! I want to\ndo the worst kind of penance--bell and candle and the rest. I've been\nthrough it with HER, and now she hands me on to you, and you're to call\nme any names you please.\" He freed her with his happy laugh. \"I'm to be\nstood in the corner till next week, and then I'm to go up to see her.\nAnd she says I owe it all to you!\"\n\n\"To me?\" It was the first phrase she found to clutch at as she tried to\nsteady herself in the eddies of his joy.\n\n\"Yes: you were so patient, and so dear to her; and you saw at once what\na damned ass I'd been!\" She tried a smile, and it seemed to pass muster\nwith him, for he sent it back in a broad beam. \"That's not so difficult\nto see? No, I admit it doesn't take a microscope. But you were so wise\nand wonderful--you always are. I've been mad these last days, simply\nmad--you and she might well have washed your hands of me! And instead,\nit's all right--all right!\"\n\nShe drew back a little, trying to keep the smile on her lips and not\nlet him get the least glimpse of what it hid. Now if ever, indeed, it\nbehoved her to be wise and wonderful!\n\n\"I'm so glad, dear; so glad. If only you'll always feel like that about\nme...\" She stopped, hardly knowing what she said, and aghast at the\nidea that her own hands should have retied the knot she imagined to be\nbroken. But she saw he had something more to say; something hard to get\nout, but absolutely necessary to express. He caught her hands, pulled\nher close, and, with his forehead drawn into its whimsical smiling\nwrinkles, \"Look here,\" he cried, \"if Darrow wants to call me a damned\nass too you're not to stop him!\"\n\nIt brought her back to a sharper sense of her central peril: of the\nsecret to be kept from him at whatever cost to her racked nerves.\n\n\"Oh, you know, he doesn't always wait for orders!\" On the whole it\nsounded better than she'd feared.\n\n\"You mean he's called me one already?\" He accepted the fact with his\ngayest laugh. \"Well, that saves a lot of trouble; now we can pass to the\norder of the day----\" he broke off and glanced at the clock--\"which is,\nyou know, dear, that she's starting in about an hour; she and Adelaide\nmust already be snatching a hasty sandwich. You'll come down to bid them\ngood-bye?\"\n\n\"Yes--of course.\"\n\nThere had, in fact, grown upon her while he spoke the urgency of seeing\nSophy Viner again before she left. The thought was deeply distasteful:\nAnna shrank from encountering the girl till she had cleared a way\nthrough her own perplexities. But it was obvious that since they had\nseparated, barely an hour earlier, the situation had taken a new shape.\nSophy Viner had apparently reconsidered her decision to break amicably\nbut definitely with Owen, and stood again in their path, a menace and a\nmystery; and confused impulses of resistance stirred in Anna's mind. She\nfelt Owen's touch on her arm. \"Are you coming?\"\n\n\"Yes...yes...presently.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? You look so strange.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by strange?\"\n\n\"I don't know: startled--surprised.\" She read what her look must be by\nits sudden reflection in his face.\n\n\"Do I? No wonder! You've given us all an exciting morning.\"\n\nHe held to his point. \"You're more excited now that there's no cause for\nit. What on earth has happened since I saw you?\"\n\nHe looked about the room, as if seeking the clue to her agitation, and\nin her dread of what he might guess she answered: \"What has happened is\nsimply that I'm rather tired. Will you ask Sophy to come up and see me\nhere?\"\n\n\nWhile she waited she tried to think what she should say when the girl\nappeared; but she had never been more conscious of her inability to deal\nwith the oblique and the tortuous. She had lacked the hard teachings of\nexperience, and an instinctive disdain for whatever was less clear and\nopen than her own conscience had kept her from learning anything of the\nintricacies and contradictions of other hearts. She said to herself:\n\"I must find out----\" yet everything in her recoiled from the means by\nwhich she felt it must be done...\n\nSophy Viner appeared almost immediately, dressed for departure, her\nlittle bag on her arm. She was still pale to the point of haggardness,\nbut with a light upon her that struck Anna with surprise. Or was it,\nperhaps, that she was looking at the girl with new eyes: seeing her, for\nthe first time, not as Effie's governess, not as Owen's bride, but as\nthe embodiment of that unknown peril lurking in the background of every\nwoman's thoughts about her lover? Anna, at any rate, with a sudden sense\nof estrangement, noted in her graces and snares never before perceived.\nIt was only the flash of a primitive instinct, but it lasted long enough\nto make her ashamed of the darknesses it lit up in her heart...\n\nShe signed to Sophy to sit down on the sofa beside her. \"I asked you to\ncome up to me because I wanted to say good-bye quietly,\" she explained,\nfeeling her lips tremble, but trying to speak in a tone of friendly\nnaturalness.\n\nThe girl's only answer was a faint smile of acquiescence, and Anna,\ndisconcerted by her silence, went on: \"You've decided, then, not to\nbreak your engagement?\"\n\nSophy Viner raised her head with a look of surprise. Evidently the\nquestion, thus abruptly put, must have sounded strangely on the lips\nof so ardent a partisan as Mrs. Leath! \"I thought that was what you\nwished,\" she said.\n\n\"What I wished?\" Anna's heart shook against her side. \"I wish,\nof course, whatever seems best for Owen...It's natural, you must\nunderstand, that that consideration should come first with me...\"\n\nSophy was looking at her steadily. \"I supposed it was the only one that\ncounted with you.\"\n\nThe curtness of retort roused Anna's latent antagonism. \"It is,\" she\nsaid, in a hard voice that startled her as she heard it. Had she ever\nspoken so to any one before? She felt frightened, as though her\nvery nature had changed without her knowing it...Feeling the girl's\nastonished gaze still on her, she continued: \"The suddenness of the\nchange has naturally surprised me. When I left you it was understood\nthat you were to reserve your decision----\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And now----?\" Anna waited for a reply that did not come. She did\nnot understand the girl's attitude, the edge of irony in her short\nsyllables, the plainly premeditated determination to lay the burden\nof proof on her interlocutor. Anna felt the sudden need to lift their\nintercourse above this mean level of defiance and distrust. She looked\nappealingly at Sophy.\n\n\"Isn't it best that we should speak quite frankly? It's this change on\nyour part that perplexes me. You can hardly be surprised at that. It's\ntrue, I asked you not to break with Owen too abruptly--and I asked it,\nbelieve me, as much for your sake as for his: I wanted you to take time\nto think over the difficulty that seems to have arisen between you. The\nfact that you felt it required thinking over seemed to show you wouldn't\ntake the final step lightly--wouldn't, I mean, accept of Owen more\nthan you could give him. But your change of mind obliges me to ask the\nquestion I thought you would have asked yourself. Is there any reason\nwhy you shouldn't marry Owen?\"\n\nShe stopped a little breathlessly, her eyes on Sophy Viner's burning\nface. \"Any reason----? What do you mean by a reason?\"\n\nAnna continued to look at her gravely. \"Do you love some one else?\" she\nasked.\n\nSophy's first look was one of wonder and a faint relief; then she gave\nback the other's scrutiny in a glance of indescribable reproach. \"Ah,\nyou might have waited!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Waited?\"\n\n\"Till I'd gone: till I was out of the house. You might have known...you\nmight have guessed...\" She turned her eyes again on Anna. \"I only meant\nto let him hope a little longer, so that he shouldn't suspect anything;\nof course I can't marry him,\" she said.\n\nAnna stood motionless, silenced by the shock of the avowal. She too\nwas trembling, less with anger than with a confused compassion. But the\nfeeling was so blent with others, less generous and more obscure, that\nshe found no words to express it, and the two women faced each other\nwithout speaking.\n\n\"I'd better go,\" Sophy murmured at length with lowered head.\n\nThe words roused in Anna a latent impulse of compunction. The girl\nlooked so young, so exposed and desolate! And what thoughts must she be\nhiding in her heart! It was impossible that they should part in such a\nspirit.\n\n\"I want you to know that no one said anything...It was I who...\"\n\nSophy looked at her. \"You mean that Mr. Darrow didn't tell you? Of\ncourse not: do you suppose I thought he did? You found it out, that's\nall--I knew you would. In your place I should have guessed it sooner.\"\n\nThe words were spoken simply, without irony or emphasis; but they went\nthrough Anna like a sword. Yes, the girl would have had divinations,\npromptings that she had not had! She felt half envious of such a sad\nprecocity of wisdom.\n\n\"I'm so sorry...so sorry...\" she murmured.\n\n\"Things happen that way. Now I'd better go. I'd like to say good-bye to\nEffie.\"\n\n\"Oh----\" it broke in a cry from Effie's mother. \"Not like this--you\nmustn't! I feel--you make me feel too horribly: as if I were driving you\naway...\" The words had rushed up from the depths of her bewildered pity.\n\n\"No one is driving me away: I had to go,\" she heard the girl reply.\n\nThere was another silence, during which passionate impulses of\nmagnanimity warred in Anna with her doubts and dreads. At length, her\neyes on Sophy's face: \"Yes, you must go now,\" she began; \"but later\non...after a while, when all this is over...if there's no reason why\nyou shouldn't marry Owen----\" she paused a moment on the words-- \"I\nshouldn't want you to think I stood between you...\"\n\n\"You?\" Sophy flushed again, and then grew pale. She seemed to try to\nspeak, but no words came. \"Yes! It was not true when I said just now\nthat I was thinking only of Owen. I'm sorry--oh, so sorry!--for you too.\nYour life--I know how hard it's been; and mine...mine's so full...Happy\nwomen understand best!\" Anna drew near and touched the girl's hand; then\nshe began again, pouring all her soul into the broken phrases: \"It's\nterrible now...you see no future; but if, by and bye...you know\nbest...but you're so young...and at your age things DO pass. If there's\nno reason, no real reason, why you shouldn't marry Owen, I WANT him to\nhope, I'll help him to hope...if you say so...\"\n\nWith the urgency of her pleading her clasp tightened on Sophy's hand,\nbut it warmed to no responsive tremor: the girl seemed numb, and Anna\nwas frightened by the stony silence of her look. \"I suppose I'm not more\nthan half a woman,\" she mused, \"for I don't want my happiness to\nhurt her;\" and aloud she repeated: \"If only you'll tell me there's no\nreason----\"\n\nThe girl did not speak; but suddenly, like a snapped branch, she bent,\nstooped down to the hand that clasped her, and laid her lips upon it in\na stream of weeping. She cried silently, continuously, abundantly, as\nthough Anna's touch had released the waters of some deep spring of pain;\nthen, as Anna, moved and half afraid, leaned over her with a sound of\npity, she stood up and turned away.\n\n\"You're going, then--for good--like this?\" Anna moved toward her and\nstopped. Sophy stopped too, with eyes that shrank from her.\n\n\"Oh----\" Anna cried, and hid her face.\n\nThe girl walked across the room and paused again in the doorway. From\nthere she flung back: \"I wanted it--I chose it. He was good to me--no\none ever was so good!\"\n\nThe door-handle turned, and Anna heard her go.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nHer first thought was: \"He's going too in a few hours--I needn't see him\nagain before he leaves...\" At that moment the possibility of having to\nlook in Darrow's face and hear him speak seemed to her more unendurable\nthan anything else she could imagine. Then, on the next wave of feeling,\ncame the desire to confront him at once and wring from him she knew\nnot what: avowal, denial, justification, anything that should open some\nchannel of escape to the flood of her pent-up anguish.\n\nShe had told Owen she was tired, and this seemed a sufficient reason for\nremaining upstairs when the motor came to the door and Miss Painter and\nSophy Viner were borne off in it; sufficient also for sending word to\nMadame de Chantelle that she would not come down till after luncheon.\nHaving despatched her maid with this message, she lay down on her sofa\nand stared before her into darkness...\n\nShe had been unhappy before, and the vision of old miseries flocked\nlike hungry ghosts about her fresh pain: she recalled her youthful\ndisappointment, the failure of her marriage, the wasted years that\nfollowed; but those were negative sorrows, denials and postponements of\nlife. She seemed in no way related to their shadowy victim, she who\nwas stretched on this fiery rack of the irreparable. She had suffered\nbefore--yes, but lucidly, reflectively, elegiacally: now she was\nsuffering as a hurt animal must, blindly, furiously, with the single\nfierce animal longing that the awful pain should stop...\n\nShe heard her maid knock, and she hid her face and made no answer. The\nknocking continued, and the discipline of habit at length made her lift\nher head, compose her face and hold out her hand to the note the woman\nbrought her. It was a word from Darrow--\"May I see you?\"--and she said\nat once, in a voice that sounded thin and empty: \"Ask Mr. Darrow to come\nup.\"\n\nThe maid enquired if she wished to have her hair smoothed first, and\nshe answered that it didn't matter; but when the door had closed, the\ninstinct of pride drew her to her feet and she looked at herself in the\nglass above the mantelpiece and passed her hands over her hair. Her eyes\nwere burning and her face looked tired and thinner; otherwise she could\nsee no change in her appearance, and she wondered that at such a moment\nher body should seem as unrelated to the self that writhed within her as\nif it had been a statue or a picture.\n\nThe maid reopened the door to show in Darrow, and he paused a moment on\nthe threshold, as if waiting for Anna to speak. He was extremely pale,\nbut he looked neither ashamed nor uncertain, and she said to herself,\nwith a perverse thrill of appreciation: \"He's as proud as I am.\"\n\nAloud she asked: \"You wanted to see me?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" he replied in a grave voice.\n\n\"Don't! It's useless. I know everything. Nothing you can say will help.\"\n\nAt the direct affirmation he turned even paler, and his eyes, which he\nkept resolutely fixed on her, confessed his misery.\n\n\"You allow me no voice in deciding that?\"\n\n\"Deciding what?\"\n\n\"That there's nothing more to be said?\" He waited for her to answer, and\nthen went on: \"I don't even know what you mean by 'everything'.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know what more there is! I know enough. I implored her\nto deny it, and she couldn't...What can you and I have to say to each\nother?\" Her voice broke into a sob. The animal anguish was upon her\nagain--just a blind cry against her pain!\n\nDarrow kept his head high and his eyes steady. \"It must be as you wish;\nand yet it's not like you to be afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\n\"To talk things out--to face them.\"\n\n\"It's for YOU to face this--not me!\"\n\n\"All I ask is to face it--but with you.\" Once more he paused. \"Won't you\ntell me what Miss Viner told you?\"\n\n\"Oh, she's generous--to the utmost!\" The pain caught her like a physical\nthroe. It suddenly came to her how the girl must have loved him to be so\ngenerous--what memories there must be between them!\n\n\"Oh, go, please go. It's too horrible. Why should I have to see you?\"\nshe stammered, lifting her hands to her eyes.\n\nWith her face hidden she waited to hear him move away, to hear the door\nopen and close again, as, a few hours earlier, it had opened and\nclosed on Sophy Viner. But Darrow made no sound or movement: he too was\nwaiting. Anna felt a thrill of resentment: his presence was an outrage\non her sorrow, a humiliation to her pride. It was strange that he should\nwait for her to tell him so!\n\n\"You want me to leave Givre?\" he asked at length. She made no answer,\nand he went on: \"Of course I'll do as you wish; but if I go now am I not\nto see you again?\"\n\nHis voice was firm: his pride was answering her pride!\n\nShe faltered: \"You must see it's useless----\"\n\n\"I might remind you that you're dismissing me without a hearing----\"\n\n\"Without a hearing? I've heard you both!\"\n\n----\"but I won't,\" he continued, \"remind you of that, or of anything or\nany one but Owen.\"\n\n\"Owen?\"\n\n\"Yes; if we could somehow spare him----\"\n\nShe had dropped her hands and turned her startled eyes on him. It seemed\nto her an age since she had thought of Owen!\n\n\"You see, don't you,\" Darrow continued, \"that if you send me away\nnow----\"\n\nShe interrupted: \"Yes, I see----\" and there was a long silence between\nthem. At length she said, very low: \"I don't want any one else to suffer\nas I'm suffering...\"\n\n\"Owen knows I meant to leave tomorrow,\" Darrow went on. \"Any sudden\nchange of plan may make him think...\"\n\nOh, she saw his inevitable logic: the horror of it was on every side of\nher! It had seemed possible to control her grief and face Darrow\ncalmly while she was upheld by the belief that this was their last hour\ntogether, that after he had passed out of the room there would be no\nfear of seeing him again, no fear that his nearness, his look, his\nvoice, and all the unseen influences that flowed from him, would\ndissolve her soul to weakness. But her courage failed at the idea of\nhaving to conspire with him to shield Owen, of keeping up with him, for\nOwen's sake, a feint of union and felicity. To live at Darrow's side in\nseeming intimacy and harmony for another twenty-four hours seemed harder\nthan to live without him for all the rest of her days. Her strength\nfailed her, and she threw herself down and buried her sobs in the\ncushions where she had so often hidden a face aglow with happiness.\n\n\"Anna----\" His voice was close to her. \"Let me talk to you quietly. It's\nnot worthy of either of us to be afraid.\"\n\nWords of endearment would have offended her; but her heart rose at the\ncall to her courage.\n\n\"I've no defense to make,\" he went on. \"The facts are miserable enough;\nbut at least I want you to see them as they are. Above all, I want you\nto know the truth about Miss Viner----\"\n\nThe name sent the blood to Anna's forehead. She raised her head and\nfaced him. \"Why should I know more of her than what she's told me? I\nnever wish to hear her name again!\"\n\n\"It's because you feel about her in that way that I ask you--in the name\nof common charity--to let me give you the facts as they are, and not as\nyou've probably imagined them.\"\n\n\"I've told you I don't think uncharitably of her. I don't want to think\nof her at all!\"\n\n\"That's why I tell you you're afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes. You've always said you wanted, above all, to look at life, at the\nhuman problem, as it is, without fear and without hypocrisy; and it's\nnot always a pleasant thing to look at.\" He broke off, and then began\nagain: \"Don't think this a plea for myself! I don't want to say a word\nto lessen my offense. I don't want to talk of myself at all. Even if I\ndid, I probably couldn't make you understand--I don't, myself, as I look\nback. Be just to me--it's your right; all I ask you is to be generous to\nMiss Viner...\"\n\nShe stood up trembling. \"You're free to be as generous to her as you\nplease!\"\n\n\"Yes: you've made it clear to me that I'm free. But there's nothing I\ncan do for her that will help her half as much as your understanding her\nwould.\"\n\n\"Nothing you can do for her? You can marry her!\"\n\nHis face hardened. \"You certainly couldn't wish her a worse fate!\"\n\n\"It must have been what she expected...relied on...\" He was silent, and\nshe broke out: \"Or what is she? What are you? It's too horrible! On your\nway here...to ME...\" She felt the tears in her throat and stopped.\n\n\"That was it,\" he said bluntly. She stared at him.\n\n\"I was on my way to you--after repeated delays and postponements of your\nown making. At the very last you turned me back with a mere word--and\nwithout explanation. I waited for a letter; and none came. I'm not\nsaying this to justify myself. I'm simply trying to make you understand.\nI felt hurt and bitter and bewildered. I thought you meant to give me\nup. And suddenly, in my way, I found some one to be sorry for, to be\nof use to. That, I swear to you, was the way it began. The rest was a\nmoment's folly...a flash of madness...as such things are. We've never\nseen each other since...\"\n\nAnna was looking at him coldly. \"You sufficiently describe her in saying\nthat!\"\n\n\"Yes, if you measure her by conventional standards--which is what you\nalways declare you never do.\"\n\n\"Conventional standards? A girl who----\" She was checked by a sudden\nrush of almost physical repugnance. Suddenly she broke out: \"I always\nthought her an adventuress!\"\n\n\"Always?\"\n\n\"I don't mean always...but after you came...\"\n\n\"She's not an adventuress.\"\n\n\"You mean that she professes to act on the new theories? The stuff that\nawful women rave about on platforms?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think she pretended to have a theory----\"\n\n\"She hadn't even that excuse?\"\n\n\"She had the excuse of her loneliness, her unhappiness--of miseries and\nhumiliations that a woman like you can't even guess. She had nothing to\nlook back to but indifference or unkindness--nothing to look forward to\nbut anxiety. She saw I was sorry for her and it touched her. She made\ntoo much of it--she exaggerated it. I ought to have seen the danger, but\nI didn't. There's no possible excuse for what I did.\"\n\nAnna listened to him in speechless misery. Every word he spoke threw\nback a disintegrating light on their own past. He had come to her with\nan open face and a clear conscience--come to her from this! If his\nsecurity was the security of falsehood it was horrible; if it meant that\nhe had forgotten, it was worse. She would have liked to stop her ears,\nto close her eyes, to shut out every sight and sound and suggestion of\na world in which such things could be; and at the same time she was\ntormented by the desire to know more, to understand better, to feel\nherself less ignorant and inexpert in matters which made so much of\nthe stuff of human experience. What did he mean by \"a moment's folly, a\nflash of madness\"? How did people enter on such adventures, how pass\nout of them without more visible traces of their havoc? Her imagination\nrecoiled from the vision of a sudden debasing familiarity: it seemed to\nher that her thoughts would never again be pure...\n\n\"I swear to you,\" she heard Darrow saying, \"it was simply that, and\nnothing more.\"\n\nShe wondered at his composure, his competence, at his knowing so exactly\nwhat to say. No doubt men often had to make such explanations: they had\nthe formulas by heart...A leaden lassitude descended on her. She passed\nfrom flame and torment into a colourless cold world where everything\nsurrounding her seemed equally indifferent and remote. For a moment she\nsimply ceased to feel.\n\nShe became aware that Darrow was waiting for her to speak, and she made\nan effort to represent to herself the meaning of what he had just said;\nbut her mind was as blank as a blurred mirror. Finally she brought out:\n\"I don't think I understand what you've told me.\"\n\n\"No; you don't understand,\" he returned with sudden bitterness; and on\nhis lips the charge of incomprehension seemed an offense to her.\n\n\"I don't want to--about such things!\"\n\nHe answered almost harshly: \"Don't be afraid...you never will...\"\nand for an instant they faced each other like enemies. Then the tears\nswelled in her throat at his reproach.\n\n\"You mean I don't feel things--I'm too hard?\"\n\n\"No: you're too high...too fine...such things are too far from you.\"\n\nHe paused, as if conscious of the futility of going on with whatever\nhe had meant to say, and again, for a short space, they confronted\neach other, no longer as enemies--so it seemed to her--but as beings of\ndifferent language who had forgotten the few words they had learned of\neach other's speech.\n\nDarrow broke the silence. \"It's best, on all accounts, that I should\nstay till tomorrow; but I needn't intrude on you; we needn't meet again\nalone. I only want to be sure I know your wishes.\" He spoke the short\nsentences in a level voice, as though he were summing up the results of\na business conference.\n\nAnna looked at him vaguely. \"My wishes?\"\n\n\"As to Owen----\"\n\nAt that she started. \"They must never meet again!\"\n\n\"It's not likely they will. What I meant was, that it depends on you to\nspare him...\"\n\nShe answered steadily: \"He shall never know,\" and after another interval\nDarrow said: \"This is good-bye, then.\"\n\nAt the word she seemed to understand for the first time whither the\nflying moments had been leading them. Resentment and indignation died\ndown, and all her consciousness resolved itself into the mere visual\nsense that he was there before her, near enough for her to lift her\nhand and touch him, and that in another instant the place where he stood\nwould be empty.\n\nShe felt a mortal weakness, a craven impulse to cry out to him to stay,\na longing to throw herself into his arms, and take refuge there from the\nunendurable anguish he had caused her. Then the vision called up another\nthought: \"I shall never know what that girl has known...\" and the recoil\nof pride flung her back on the sharp edges of her anguish.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, in dread lest he should read her face; and she\nstood motionless, her head high, while he walked to the door and went\nout.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nAnna Leath, three days later, sat in Miss Painter's drawing-room in the\nrue de Matignon.\n\nComing up precipitately that morning from the country, she had reached\nParis at one o'clock and Miss Painter's landing some ten minutes later.\nMiss Painter's mouldy little man-servant, dissembling a napkin under his\narm, had mildly attempted to oppose her entrance; but Anna, insisting,\nhad gone straight to the dining-room and surprised her friend--who ate\nas furtively as certain animals--over a strange meal of cold mutton and\nlemonade. Ignoring the embarrassment she caused, she had set forth the\nobject of her journey, and Miss Painter, always hatted and booted for\naction, had immediately hastened out, leaving her to the solitude of\nthe bare fireless drawing-room with its eternal slip-covers and \"bowed\"\nshutters.\n\nIn this inhospitable obscurity Anna had sat alone for close upon two\nhours. Both obscurity and solitude were acceptable to her, and impatient\nas she was to hear the result of the errand on which she had despatched\nher hostess, she desired still more to be alone. During her long\nmeditation in a white-swathed chair before the muffled hearth she had\nbeen able for the first time to clear a way through the darkness and\nconfusion of her thoughts. The way did not go far, and her attempt to\ntrace it was as weak and spasmodic as a convalescent's first efforts\nto pick up the thread of living. She seemed to herself like some one\nstruggling to rise from a long sickness of which it would have been so\nmuch easier to die. At Givre she had fallen into a kind of torpor, a\ndeadness of soul traversed by wild flashes of pain; but whether she\nsuffered or whether she was numb, she seemed equally remote from her\nreal living and doing self.\n\nIt was only the discovery--that very morning--of Owen's unannounced\ndeparture for Paris that had caught her out of her dream and forced her\nback to action. The dread of what this flight might imply, and of the\nconsequences that might result from it, had roused her to the sense of\nher responsibility, and from the moment when she had resolved to follow\nher step-son, and had made her rapid preparations for pursuit, her mind\nhad begun to work again, feverishly, fitfully, but still with something\nof its normal order. In the train she had been too agitated, too\npreoccupied with what might next await her, to give her thoughts to\nanything but the turning over of dread alternatives; but Miss Painter's\nimperviousness had steadied her, and while she waited for the sound of\nthe latch-key she resolutely returned upon herself.\n\nWith respect to her outward course she could at least tell herself that\nshe had held to her purpose. She had, as people said, \"kept up\" during\nthe twenty-four hours preceding George Darrow's departure; had gone\nwith a calm face about her usual business, and even contrived not too\nobviously to avoid him. Then, the next day before dawn, from behind\nthe closed shutters where she had kept for half the night her dry-eyed\nvigil, she had heard him drive off to the train which brought its\npassengers to Paris in time for the Calais express.\n\nThe fact of his taking that train, of his travelling so straight and\nfar away from her, gave to what had happened the implacable outline of\nreality. He was gone; he would not come back; and her life had ended\njust as she had dreamed it was beginning. She had no doubt, at first, as\nto the absolute inevitability of this conclusion. The man who had driven\naway from her house in the autumn dawn was not the man she had loved; he\nwas a stranger with whom she had not a single thought in common. It was\nterrible, indeed, that he wore the face and spoke in the voice of her\nfriend, and that, as long as he was under one roof with her, the mere\nway in which he moved and looked could bridge at a stroke the gulf\nbetween them. That, no doubt, was the fault of her exaggerated\nsensibility to outward things: she was frightened to see how it enslaved\nher. A day or two before she had supposed the sense of honour was her\ndeepest sentiment: if she had smiled at the conventions of others it was\nbecause they were too trivial, not because they were too grave. There\nwere certain dishonours with which she had never dreamed that any pact\ncould be made: she had had an incorruptible passion for good faith and\nfairness.\n\nShe had supposed that, once Darrow was gone, once she was safe from the\ndanger of seeing and hearing him, this high devotion would sustain her.\nShe had believed it would be possible to separate the image of the man\nshe had thought him from that of the man he was. She had even foreseen\nthe hour when she might raise a mournful shrine to the memory of the\nDarrow she had loved, without fear that his double's shadow would\ndesecrate it. But now she had begun to understand that the two men were\nreally one. The Darrow she worshipped was inseparable from the Darrow\nshe abhorred; and the inevitable conclusion was that both must go, and\nshe be left in the desert of a sorrow without memories...\n\nBut if the future was thus void, the present was all too full. Never had\nblow more complex repercussions; and to remember Owen was to cease to\nthink of herself. What impulse, what apprehension, had sent him suddenly\nto Paris? And why had he thought it needful to conceal his going from\nher? When Sophy Viner had left, it had been with the understanding that\nhe was to await her summons; and it seemed improbable that he would\nbreak his pledge, and seek her without leave, unless his lover's\nintuition had warned him of some fresh danger. Anna recalled how\nquickly he had read the alarm in her face when he had rushed back to her\nsitting-room with the news that Miss Viner had promised to see him again\nin Paris. To be so promptly roused, his suspicions must have been but\nhalf-asleep; and since then, no doubt, if she and Darrow had dissembled,\nso had he. To her proud directness it was degrading to think that\nthey had been living together like enemies who spy upon each other's\nmovements: she felt a desperate longing for the days which had seemed so\ndull and narrow, but in which she had walked with her head high and her\neyes unguarded.\n\nShe had come up to Paris hardly knowing what peril she feared, and still\nless how she could avert it. If Owen meant to see Miss Viner--and what\nother object could he have?--they must already be together, and it was\ntoo late to interfere. It had indeed occurred to Anna that Paris might\nnot be his objective point: that his real purpose in leaving Givre\nwithout her knowledge had been to follow Darrow to London and exact\nthe truth of him. But even to her alarmed imagination this seemed\nimprobable. She and Darrow, to the last, had kept up so complete a feint\nof harmony that, whatever Owen had surmised, he could scarcely have\nrisked acting on his suspicions. If he still felt the need of an\nexplanation, it was almost certainly of Sophy Viner that he would ask\nit; and it was in quest of Sophy Viner that Anna had despatched Miss\nPainter.\n\nShe had found a blessed refuge from her perplexities in the stolid\nAdelaide's unawareness. One could so absolutely count on Miss Painter's\nguessing no more than one chose, and yet acting astutely on such hints\nas one vouchsafed her! She was like a well-trained retriever whose\ninterest in his prey ceases when he lays it at his master's feet. Anna,\non arriving, had explained that Owen's unannounced flight had made her\nfear some fresh misunderstanding between himself and Miss Viner. In\nthe interests of peace she had thought it best to follow him; but she\nhastily added that she did not wish to see Sophy, but only, if possible,\nto learn from her where Owen was. With these brief instructions Miss\nPainter had started out; but she was a woman of many occupations, and\nhad given her visitor to understand that before returning she should\nhave to call on a friend who had just arrived from Boston, and afterward\ndespatch to another exiled compatriot a supply of cranberries and\nbrandied peaches from the American grocery in the Champs Elysees.\n\nGradually, as the moments passed, Anna began to feel the reaction which,\nin moments of extreme nervous tension, follows on any effort of the\nwill. She seemed to have gone as far as her courage would carry her,\nand she shrank more and more from the thought of Miss Painter's return,\nsince whatever information the latter brought would necessitate some\nfresh decision. What should she say to Owen if she found him? What could\nshe say that should not betray the one thing she would give her life\nto hide from him? \"Give her life\"--how the phrase derided her! It was a\ngift she would not have bestowed on her worst enemy. She would not have\nhad Sophy Viner live the hours she was living now... She tried again\nto look steadily and calmly at the picture that the image of the girl\nevoked. She had an idea that she ought to accustom herself to its\ncontemplation. If life was like that, why the sooner one got used to it\nthe better...But no! Life was not like that. Her adventure was a hideous\naccident. She dreaded above all the temptation to generalise from her\nown case, to doubt the high things she had lived by and seek a cheap\nsolace in belittling what fate had refused her. There was such love as\nshe had dreamed, and she meant to go on believing in it, and cherishing\nthe thought that she was worthy of it. What had happened to her was\ngrotesque and mean and miserable; but she herself was none of these\nthings, and never, never would she make of herself the mock that fate\nhad made of her...\n\nShe could not, as yet, bear to think deliberately of Darrow; but she\nkept on repeating to herself \"By and bye that will come too.\" Even now\nshe was determined not to let his image be distorted by her suffering.\nAs soon as she could, she would try to single out for remembrance\nthe individual things she had liked in him before she had loved him\naltogether. No \"spiritual exercise\" devised by the discipline of piety\ncould have been more torturing; but its very cruelty attracted her. She\nwanted to wear herself out with new pains...\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nThe sound of Miss Painter's latch-key made her start. She was still a\nbundle of quivering fears to whom each coming moment seemed a menace.\n\nThere was a slight interval, and a sound of voices in the hall; then\nMiss Painter's vigorous hand was on the door.\n\nAnna stood up as she came in. \"You've found him?\"\n\n\"I've found Sophy.\"\n\n\"And Owen?--has she seen him? Is he here?\"\n\n\"SHE'S here: in the hall. She wants to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Here--NOW?\" Anna found no voice for more.\n\n\"She drove back with me,\" Miss Painter continued in the tone of\nimpartial narrative. \"The cabman was impertinent. I've got his number.\"\nShe fumbled in a stout black reticule.\n\n\"Oh, I can't--\" broke from Anna; but she collected herself, remembering\nthat to betray her unwillingness to see the girl was to risk revealing\nmuch more.\n\n\"She thought you might be too tired to see her: she wouldn't come in\ntill I'd found out.\"\n\nAnna drew a quick breath. An instant's thought had told her that\nSophy Viner would hardly have taken such a step unless something more\nimportant had happened. \"Ask her to come, please,\" she said.\n\nMiss Painter, from the threshold, turned back to announce her intention\nof going immediately to the police station to report the cabman's\ndelinquency; then she passed out, and Sophy Viner entered.\n\nThe look in the girl's face showed that she had indeed come unwillingly;\nyet she seemed animated by an eager resoluteness that made Anna ashamed\nof her tremors. For a moment they looked at each other in silence, as\nif the thoughts between them were packed too thick for speech; then Anna\nsaid, in a voice from which she strove to take the edge of hardness:\n\"You know where Owen is, Miss Painter tells me.\"\n\n\"Yes; that was my reason for asking you to see me.\" Sophy spoke simply,\nwithout constraint or hesitation.\n\n\"I thought he'd promised you--\" Anna interposed.\n\n\"He did; but he broke his promise. That's what I thought I ought to tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Anna went on tentatively: \"He left Givre this morning\nwithout a word. I followed him because I was afraid...\"\n\nShe broke off again and the girl took up her phrase. \"You were afraid\nhe'd guessed? He HAS...\"\n\n\"What do you mean--guessed what?\"\n\n\"That you know something he doesn't...something that made you glad to\nhave me go.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Anna moaned. If she had wanted more pain she had it now. \"He's\ntold you this?\" she faltered.\n\n\"He hasn't told me, because I haven't seen him. I kept him off--I made\nMrs. Farlow get rid of him. But he's written me what he came to say; and\nthat was it.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor Owen!\" broke from Anna. Through all the intricacies of her\nsuffering she felt the separate pang of his.\n\n\"And I want to ask you,\" the girl continued, \"to let me see him; for\nof course,\" she added in the same strange voice of energy, \"I wouldn't\nunless you consented.\"\n\n\"To see him?\" Anna tried to gather together her startled thoughts. \"What\nuse would it be? What could you tell him?\"\n\n\"I want to tell him the truth,\" said Sophy Viner.\n\nThe two women looked at each other, and a burning blush rose to Anna's\nforehead. \"I don't understand,\" she faltered.\n\nSophy waited a moment; then she lowered her voice to say: \"I don't want\nhim to think worse of me than he need...\"\n\n\"Worse?\"\n\n\"Yes--to think such things as you're thinking now...I want him to know\nexactly what happened...then I want to bid him good-bye.\"\n\nAnna tried to clear a way through her own wonder and confusion. She felt\nherself obscurely moved.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be worse for him?\"\n\n\"To hear the truth? It would be better, at any rate, for you and Mr.\nDarrow.\"\n\nAt the sound of the name Anna lifted her head quickly. \"I've only my\nstep-son to consider!\"\n\nThe girl threw a startled look at her. \"You don't mean--you're not going\nto give him up?\"\n\nAnna felt her lips harden. \"I don't think it's of any use to talk of\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know! It's my fault for not knowing how to say what I want you to\nhear. Your words are different; you know how to choose them. Mine offend\nyou...and the dread of it makes me blunder. That's why, the other day, I\ncouldn't say anything...couldn't make things clear to you. But now MUST,\neven if you hate it!\" She drew a step nearer, her slender figure swayed\nforward in a passion of entreaty. \"Do listen to me! What you've said is\ndreadful. How can you speak of him in that voice? Don't you see that I\nwent away so that he shouldn't have to lose you?\"\n\nAnna looked at her coldly. \"Are you speaking of Mr. Darrow? I don't\nknow why you think your going or staying can in any way affect our\nrelations.\"\n\n\"You mean that you HAVE given him up--because of me? Oh, how could you?\nYou can't really love him!--And yet,\" the girl suddenly added, \"you\nmust, or you'd be more sorry for me!\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry for you,\" Anna said, feeling as if the iron band about\nher heart pressed on it a little less inexorably.\n\n\"Then why won't you hear me? Why won't you try to understand? It's all\nso different from what you imagine!\"\n\n\"I've never judged you.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of myself. He loves you!\"\n\n\"I thought you'd come to speak of Owen.\"\n\nSophy Viner seemed not to hear her. \"He's never loved any one else. Even\nthose few days...I knew it all the while...he never cared for me.\"\n\n\"Please don't say any more!\" Anna said.\n\n\"I know it must seem strange to you that I should say so much. I shock\nyou, I offend you: you think me a creature without shame. So I am--but\nnot in the sense you think! I'm not ashamed of having loved him; no; and\nI'm not ashamed of telling you so. It's that that justifies me--and him\ntoo...Oh, let me tell you how it happened! He was sorry for me: he saw I\ncared. I KNEW that was all he ever felt. I could see he was thinking of\nsome one else. I knew it was only for a week...He never said a word to\nmislead me...I wanted to be happy just once--and I didn't dream of the\nharm I might be doing him!\"\n\nAnna could not speak. She hardly knew, as yet, what the girl's words\nconveyed to her, save the sense of their tragic fervour; but she was\nconscious of being in the presence of an intenser passion than she had\never felt.\n\n\"I am sorry for you.\" She paused. \"But why do you say this to me?\" After\nanother interval she exclaimed: \"You'd no right to let Owen love you.\"\n\n\"No; that was wrong. At least what's happened since has made it so. If\nthings had been different I think I could have made Owen happy. You were\nall so good to me--I wanted so to stay with you! I suppose you'll say\nthat makes it worse: my daring to dream I had the right...But all that\ndoesn't matter now. I won't see Owen unless you're willing. I should\nhave liked to tell him what I've tried to tell you; but you must know\nbetter; you feel things in a finer way. Only you'll have to help him if\nI can't. He cares a great deal...it's going to hurt him...\"\n\nAnna trembled. \"Oh, I know! What can I do?\"\n\n\"You can go straight back to Givre--now, at once! So that Owen shall\nnever know you've followed him.\" Sophy's clasped hands reached out\nurgently. \"And you can send for Mr. Darrow--bring him back. Owen must\nbe convinced that he's mistaken, and nothing else will convince him.\nAfterward I'll find a pretext--oh, I promise you! But first he must see\nfor himself that nothing's changed for you.\"\n\nAnna stood motionless, subdued and dominated. The girl's ardour swept\nher like a wind.\n\n\"Oh, can't I move you? Some day you'll know!\" Sophy pleaded, her eyes\nfull of tears.\n\nAnna saw them, and felt a fullness in her throat. Again the band about\nher heart seemed loosened. She wanted to find a word, but could not:\nall within her was too dark and violent. She gave the girl a speechless\nlook.\n\n\"I do believe you,\" she said suddenly; then she turned and walked out of\nthe room.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nShe drove from Miss Painter's to her own apartment. The maid-servant who\nhad it in charge had been apprised of her coming, and had opened one or\ntwo of the rooms, and prepared a fire in her bedroom. Anna shut herself\nin, refusing the woman's ministrations. She felt cold and faint, and\nafter she had taken off her hat and cloak she knelt down by the fire and\nstretched her hands to it.\n\nIn one respect, at least, it was clear to her that she would do well\nto follow Sophy Viner's counsel. It had been an act of folly to follow\nOwen, and her first business was to get back to Givre before him. But\nthe only train leaving that evening was a slow one, which did not reach\nFrancheuil till midnight, and she knew that her taking it would excite\nMadame de Chantelle's wonder and lead to interminable talk. She had come\nup to Paris on the pretext of finding a new governess for Effie, and the\nnatural thing was to defer her return till the next morning. She knew\nOwen well enough to be sure that he would make another attempt to see\nMiss Viner, and failing that, would write again and await her answer:\nso that there was no likelihood of his reaching Givre till the following\nevening.\n\nHer sense of relief at not having to start out at once showed her for\nthe first time how tired she was. The bonne had suggested a cup of tea,\nbut the dread of having any one about her had made Anna refuse, and she\nhad eaten nothing since morning but a sandwich bought at a buffet. She\nwas too tired to get up, but stretching out her arm she drew toward her\nthe arm-chair which stood beside the hearth and rested her head against\nits cushions. Gradually the warmth of the fire stole into her veins and\nher heaviness of soul was replaced by a dreamy buoyancy. She seemed to\nbe seated on the hearth in her sitting-room at Givre, and Darrow was\nbeside her, in the chair against which she leaned. He put his arms about\nher shoulders and drawing her head back looked into her eyes. \"Of all\nthe ways you do your hair, that's the way I like best,\" he said...\n\nA log dropped, and she sat up with a start. There was a warmth in her\nheart, and she was smiling. Then she looked about her, and saw where she\nwas, and the glory fell. She hid her face and sobbed.\n\nPresently she perceived that it was growing dark, and getting up\nstiffly she began to undo the things in her bag and spread them on the\ndressing-table. She shrank from lighting the lights, and groped her way\nabout, trying to find what she needed. She seemed immeasurably far\noff from every one, and most of all from herself. It was as if her\nconsciousness had been transmitted to some stranger whose thoughts and\ngestures were indifferent to her...\n\nSuddenly she heard a shrill tinkle, and with a beating heart she\nstood still in the middle of the room. It was the telephone in her\ndressing-room--a call, no doubt, from Adelaide Painter. Or could Owen\nhave learned she was in town? The thought alarmed her and she opened the\ndoor and stumbled across the unlit room to the instrument. She held it\nto her ear, and heard Darrow's voice pronounce her name.\n\n\"Will you let me see you? I've come back--I had to come. Miss Painter\ntold me you were here.\"\n\nShe began to tremble, and feared that he would guess it from her voice.\nShe did not know what she answered: she heard him say: \"I can't\nhear.\" She called \"Yes!\" and laid the telephone down, and caught it up\nagain--but he was gone. She wondered if her \"Yes\" had reached him.\n\nShe sat in her chair and listened. Why had she said that she would see\nhim? What did she mean to say to him when he came? Now and then, as she\nsat there, the sense of his presence enveloped her as in her dream, and\nshe shut her eyes and felt his arms about her. Then she woke to reality\nand shivered. A long time elapsed, and at length she said to herself:\n\"He isn't coming.\"\n\nThe door-bell rang as she said it, and she stood up, cold and trembling.\nShe thought: \"Can he imagine there's any use in coming?\" and moved\nforward to bid the servant say she could not see him.\n\nThe door opened and she saw him standing in the drawing-room. The room\nwas cold and fireless, and a hard glare fell from the wall-lights on the\nshrouded furniture and the white slips covering the curtains. He looked\npale and stern, with a frown of fatigue between his eyes; and she\nremembered that in three days he had travelled from Givre to London and\nback. It seemed incredible that all that had befallen her should have\nbeen compressed within the space of three days!\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said as she came in.\n\nShe answered: \"It's better, I suppose----\"\n\nHe came toward her and took her in his arms. She struggled a little,\nafraid of yielding, but he pressed her to him, not bending to her but\nholding her fast, as though he had found her after a long search: she\nheard his hurried breathing. It seemed to come from her own breast, so\nclose he held her; and it was she who, at last, lifted up her face and\ndrew down his.\n\nShe freed herself and went and sat on a sofa at the other end of the\nroom. A mirror between the shrouded window-curtains showed her crumpled\ntravelling dress and the white face under her disordered hair.\n\nShe found her voice, and asked him how he had been able to leave London.\nHe answered that he had managed--he'd arranged it; and she saw he hardly\nheard what she was saying.\n\n\"I had to see you,\" he went on, and moved nearer, sitting down at her\nside.\n\n\"Yes; we must think of Owen----\"\n\n\"Oh, Owen--!\"\n\nHer mind had flown back to Sophy Viner's plea that she should let Darrow\nreturn to Givre in order that Owen might be persuaded of the folly of\nhis suspicions. The suggestion was absurd, of course. She could not ask\nDarrow to lend himself to such a fraud, even had she had the inhuman\ncourage to play her part in it. She was suddenly overwhelmed by the\nfutility of every attempt to reconstruct her ruined world. No, it was\nuseless; and since it was useless, every moment with Darrow was pure\npain...\n\n\"I've come to talk of myself, not of Owen,\" she heard him saying.\n\"When you sent me away the other day I understood that it couldn't be\notherwise--then. But it's not possible that you and I should part like\nthat. If I'm to lose you, it must be for a better reason.\"\n\n\"A better reason?\"\n\n\"Yes: a deeper one. One that means a fundamental disaccord between us.\nThis one doesn't--in spite of everything it doesn't. That's what I want\nyou to see, and have the courage to acknowledge.\"\n\n\"If I saw it I should have the courage!\"\n\n\"Yes: courage was the wrong word. You have that. That's why I'm here.\"\n\n\"But I don't see it,\" she continued sadly. \"So it's useless, isn't\nit?--and so cruel...\" He was about to speak, but she went on: \"I shall\nnever understand it--never!\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"You will some day: you were made to feel everything\"\n\n\"I should have thought this was a case of not feeling----\"\n\n\"On my part, you mean?\" He faced her resolutely. \"Yes, it was: to my\nshame...What I meant was that when you've lived a little longer\nyou'll see what complex blunderers we all are: how we're struck blind\nsometimes, and mad sometimes--and then, when our sight and our senses\ncome back, how we have to set to work, and build up, little by little,\nbit by bit, the precious things we'd smashed to atoms without knowing\nit. Life's just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits.\"\n\nShe looked up quickly. \"That's what I feel: that you ought to----\"\n\nHe stood up, interrupting her with a gesture. \"Oh, don't--don't say what\nyou're going to! Men don't give their lives away like that. If you won't\nhave mine, it's at least my own, to do the best I can with.\"\n\n\"The best you can--that's what I mean! How can there be a 'best' for you\nthat's made of some one else's worst?\"\n\nHe sat down again with a groan. \"I don't know! It seemed such a slight\nthing--all on the surface--and I've gone aground on it because it was on\nthe surface. I see the horror of it just as you do. But I see, a little\nmore clearly, the extent, and the limits, of my wrong. It's not as black\nas you imagine.\"\n\nShe lowered her voice to say: \"I suppose I shall never understand; but\nshe seems to love you...\"\n\n\"There's my shame! That I didn't guess it, didn't fly from it. You say\nyou'll never understand: but why shouldn't you? Is it anything to be\nproud of, to know so little of the strings that pull us? If you knew a\nlittle more, I could tell you how such things happen without offending\nyou; and perhaps you'd listen without condemning me.\"\n\n\"I don't condemn you.\" She was dizzy with struggling impulses. She\nlonged to cry out: \"I DO understand! I've understood ever since you've\nbeen here!\" For she was aware, in her own bosom, of sensations so\nseparate from her romantic thoughts of him that she saw her body and\nsoul divided against themselves. She recalled having read somewhere that\nin ancient Rome the slaves were not allowed to wear a distinctive dress\nlest they should recognize each other and learn their numbers and their\npower. So, in herself, she discerned for the first time instincts\nand desires, which, mute and unmarked, had gone to and fro in the dim\npassages of her mind, and now hailed each other with a cry of mutiny.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know what to think!\" she broke out. \"You say you didn't\nknow she loved you. But you know it now. Doesn't that show you how you\ncan put the broken bits together?\"\n\n\"Can you seriously think it would be doing so to marry one woman while I\ncare for another?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know...I don't know...\" The sense of her weakness made her\ntry to harden herself against his arguments.\n\n\"You do know! We've often talked of such things: of the monstrousness of\nuseless sacrifices. If I'm to expiate, it's not in that way.\" He added\nabruptly: \"It's in having to say this to you now...\"\n\nShe found no answer.\n\nThrough the silent apartment they heard the sudden peal of the\ndoor-bell, and she rose to her feet. \"Owen!\" she instantly exclaimed.\n\n\"Is Owen in Paris?\"\n\nShe explained in a rapid undertone what she had learned from Sophy\nViner.\n\n\"Shall I leave you?\" Darrow asked.\n\n\"Yes...no...\" She moved to the dining-room door, with the half-formed\npurpose of making him pass out, and then turned back. \"It may be\nAdelaide.\"\n\nThey heard the outer door open, and a moment later Owen walked into the\nroom. He was pale, with excited eyes: as they fell on Darrow, Anna saw\nhis start of wonder. He made a slight sign of recognition, and then went\nup to his step-mother with an air of exaggerated gaiety.\n\n\"You furtive person! I ran across the omniscient Adelaide and heard from\nher that you'd rushed up suddenly and secretly.\" He stood between Anna\nand Darrow, strained, questioning, dangerously on edge.\n\n\"I came up to meet Mr. Darrow,\" Anna answered. \"His leave's been\nprolonged--he's going back with me.\"\n\nThe words seemed to have uttered themselves without her will, yet she\nfelt a great sense of freedom as she spoke them.\n\nThe hard tension of Owen's face changed to incredulous surprise. He\nlooked at Darrow. \"The merest luck...a colleague whose wife was ill...I\ncame straight back,\" she heard the latter tranquilly explaining. His\nself-command helped to steady her, and she smiled at Owen.\n\n\"We'll all go back together tomorrow morning,\" she said as she slipped\nher arm through his.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nOwen Leath did not go back with his step-mother to Givre. In reply to\nher suggestion he announced his intention of staying on a day or two\nlonger in Paris.\n\nAnna left alone by the first train the next morning. Darrow was to\nfollow in the afternoon. When Owen had left them the evening before,\nDarrow waited a moment for her to speak; then, as she said nothing, he\nasked her if she really wished him to return to Givre. She made a mute\nsign of assent, and he added: \"For you know that, much as I'm ready to\ndo for Owen, I can't do that for him--I can't go back to be sent away\nagain.\"\n\n\"No--no!\"\n\nHe came nearer, and looked at her, and she went to him. All her fears\nseemed to fall from her as he held her. It was a different feeling from\nany she had known before: confused and turbid, as if secret shames and\nrancours stirred in it, yet richer, deeper, more enslaving. She leaned\nher head back and shut her eyes beneath his kisses. She knew now that\nshe could never give him up.\n\nNevertheless she asked him, the next morning, to let her go back alone\nto Givre. She wanted time to think. She was convinced that what had\nhappened was inevitable, that she and Darrow belonged to each other, and\nthat he was right in saying no past folly could ever put them asunder.\nIf there was a shade of difference in her feeling for him it was that\nof an added intensity. She felt restless, insecure out of his sight:\nshe had a sense of incompleteness, of passionate dependence, that was\nsomehow at variance with her own conception of her character.\n\nIt was partly the consciousness of this change in herself that made her\nwant to be alone. The solitude of her inner life had given her the habit\nof these hours of self-examination, and she needed them as she needed\nher morning plunge into cold water.\n\nDuring the journey she tried to review what had happened in the light\nof her new decision and of her sudden relief from pain. She seemed to\nherself to have passed through some fiery initiation from which she\nhad emerged seared and quivering, but clutching to her breast a magic\ntalisman. Sophy Viner had cried out to her: \"Some day you'll know!\" and\nDarrow had used the same words. They meant, she supposed, that when\nshe had explored the intricacies and darknesses of her own heart her\njudgment of others would be less absolute. Well, she knew now--knew\nweaknesses and strengths she had not dreamed of, and the deep discord\nand still deeper complicities between what thought in her and what\nblindly wanted...\n\nHer mind turned anxiously to Owen. At least the blow that was to fall on\nhim would not seem to have been inflicted by her hand. He would be left\nwith the impression that his breach with Sophy Viner was due to one of\nthe ordinary causes of such disruptions: though he must lose her, his\nmemory of her would not be poisoned. Anna never for a moment permitted\nherself the delusion that she had renewed her promise to Darrow in order\nto spare her step-son this last refinement of misery. She knew she had\nbeen prompted by the irresistible impulse to hold fast to what was\nmost precious to her, and that Owen's arrival on the scene had been\nthe pretext for her decision, and not its cause; yet she felt herself\nfortified by the thought of what she had spared him. It was as though\na star she had been used to follow had shed its familiar ray on ways\nunknown to her.\n\nAll through these meditations ran the undercurrent of an absolute trust\nin Sophy Viner. She thought of the girl with a mingling of antipathy\nand confidence. It was humiliating to her pride to recognize kindred\nimpulses in a character which she would have liked to feel completely\nalien to her. But what indeed was the girl really like? She seemed to\nhave no scruples and a thousand delicacies. She had given herself to\nDarrow, and concealed the episode from Owen Leath, with no more apparent\nsense of debasement than the vulgarest of adventuresses; yet she had\ninstantly obeyed the voice of her heart when it bade her part from the\none and serve the other.\n\nAnna tried to picture what the girl's life must have been: what\nexperiences, what initiations, had formed her. But her own training had\nbeen too different: there were veils she could not lift. She looked back\nat her married life, and its colourless uniformity took on an air of\nhigh restraint and order. Was it because she had been so incurious that\nit had worn that look to her? It struck her with amazement that she had\nnever given a thought to her husband's past, or wondered what he did and\nwhere he went when he was away from her. If she had been asked what she\nsupposed he thought about when they were apart, she would instantly have\nanswered: his snuff-boxes. It had never occurred to her that he might\nhave passions, interests, preoccupations of which she was absolutely\nignorant. Yet he went up to Paris rather regularly: ostensibly to attend\nsales and exhibitions, or to confer with dealers and collectors. She\ntried to picture him, straight, trim, beautifully brushed and varnished,\nwalking furtively down a quiet street, and looking about him before he\nslipped into a doorway. She understood now that she had been cold to\nhim: what more likely than that he had sought compensations? All men\nwere like that, she supposed--no doubt her simplicity had amused him.\n\nIn the act of transposing Fraser Leath into a Don Juan she was pulled up\nby the ironic perception that she was simply trying to justify Darrow.\nShe wanted to think that all men were \"like that\" because Darrow\nwas \"like that\": she wanted to justify her acceptance of the fact by\npersuading herself that only through such concessions could women like\nherself hope to keep what they could not give up. And suddenly she was\nfilled with anger at her blindness, and then at her disastrous attempt\nto see. Why had she forced the truth out of Darrow? If only she had held\nher tongue nothing need ever have been known. Sophy Viner would have\nbroken her engagement, Owen would have been sent around the world, and\nher own dream would have been unshattered. But she had probed, insisted,\ncross-examined, not rested till she had dragged the secret to the light.\nShe was one of the luckless women who always have the wrong audacities,\nand who always know it...\n\nWas it she, Anna Leath, who was picturing herself to herself in that\nway? She recoiled from her thoughts as if with a sense of demoniac\npossession, and there flashed through her the longing to return to her\nold state of fearless ignorance. If at that moment she could have kept\nDarrow from following her to Givre she would have done so...\n\nBut he came; and with the sight of him the turmoil fell and she felt\nherself reassured, rehabilitated. He arrived toward dusk, and she\nmotored to Francheuil to meet him. She wanted to see him as soon as\npossible, for she had divined, through the new insight that was in her,\nthat only his presence could restore her to a normal view of things.\nIn the motor, as they left the town and turned into the high-road, he\nlifted her hand and kissed it, and she leaned against him, and felt\nthe currents flow between them. She was grateful to him for not saying\nanything, and for not expecting her to speak. She said to herself: \"He\nnever makes a mistake--he always knows what to do\"; and then she thought\nwith a start that it was doubtless because he had so often been in such\nsituations. The idea that his tact was a kind of professional expertness\nfilled her with repugnance, and insensibly she drew away from him. He\nmade no motion to bring her nearer, and she instantly thought that\nthat was calculated too. She sat beside him in frozen misery, wondering\nwhether, henceforth, she would measure in this way his every look and\ngesture. Neither of them spoke again till the motor turned under the\ndark arch of the avenue, and they saw the lights of Givre twinkling at\nits end. Then Darrow laid his hand on hers and said: \"I know, dear--\"\nand the hardness in her melted. \"He's suffering as I am,\" she thought;\nand for a moment the baleful fact between them seemed to draw them\ncloser instead of walling them up in their separate wretchedness.\n\nIt was wonderful to be once more re-entering the doors of Givre with\nhim, and as the old house received them into its mellow silence she had\nagain the sense of passing out of a dreadful dream into the reassurance\nof kindly and familiar things. It did not seem possible that these quiet\nrooms, so full of the slowly-distilled accumulations of a fastidious\ntaste, should have been the scene of tragic dissensions. The memory of\nthem seemed to be shut out into the night with the closing and barring\nof its doors.\n\nAt the tea-table in the oak-room they found Madame de Chantelle and\nEffie. The little girl, catching sight of Darrow, raced down the\ndrawing-rooms to meet him, and returned in triumph on his shoulder. Anna\nlooked at them with a smile. Effie, for all her graces, was chary of\nsuch favours, and her mother knew that in according them to Darrow she\nhad admitted him to the circle where Owen had hitherto ruled.\n\nOver the tea-table Darrow gave Madame de Chantelle the explanation of\nhis sudden return from England. On reaching London, he told her, he had\nfound that the secretary he was to have replaced was detained there by\nthe illness of his wife. The Ambassador, knowing Darrow's urgent reasons\nfor wishing to be in France, had immediately proposed his going back,\nand awaiting at Givre the summons to relieve his colleague; and he had\njumped into the first train, without even waiting to telegraph the news\nof his release. He spoke naturally, easily, in his usual quiet voice,\ntaking his tea from Effie, helping himself to the toast she handed, and\nstooping now and then to stroke the dozing terrier. And suddenly, as\nAnna listened to his explanation, she asked herself if it were true.\n\nThe question, of course, was absurd. There was no possible reason why he\nshould invent a false account of his return, and every probability that\nthe version he gave was the real one. But he had looked and spoken in\nthe same way when he had answered her probing questions about Sophy\nViner, and she reflected with a chill of fear that she would never again\nknow if he were speaking the truth or not. She was sure he loved her,\nand she did not fear his insincerity as much as her own distrust of him.\nFor a moment it seemed to her that this must corrupt the very source of\nlove; then she said to herself: \"By and bye, when I am altogether his,\nwe shall be so near each other that there will be no room for any\ndoubts between us.\" But the doubts were there now, one moment lulled to\nquiescence, the next more torturingly alert. When the nurse appeared to\nsummon Effie, the little girl, after kissing her grandmother, entrenched\nherself on Darrow's knee with the imperious demand to be carried up to\nbed; and Anna, while she laughingly protested, said to herself with a\npang: \"Can I give her a father about whom I think such things?\"\n\nThe thought of Effie, and of what she owed to Effie, had been the\nfundamental reason for her delays and hesitations when she and Darrow\nhad come together again in England. Her own feeling was so clear that\nbut for that scruple she would have put her hand in his at once. But\ntill she had seen him again she had never considered the possibility\nof re-marriage, and when it suddenly confronted her it seemed, for the\nmoment, to disorganize the life she had planned for herself and her\nchild. She had not spoken of this to Darrow because it appeared to her a\nsubject to be debated within her own conscience. The question, then, was\nnot as to his fitness to become the guide and guardian of her child;\nnor did she fear that her love for him would deprive Effie of the least\nfraction of her tenderness, since she did not think of love as something\nmeasured and exhaustible but as a treasure perpetually renewed. What she\nquestioned was her right to introduce into her life any interests\nand duties which might rob Effie of a part of her time, or lessen the\ncloseness of their daily intercourse.\n\nShe had decided this question as it was inevitable that she should; but\nnow another was before her. Assuredly, at her age, there was no possible\nreason why she should cloister herself to bring up her daughter; but\nthere was every reason for not marrying a man in whom her own faith was\nnot complete...\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nWhen she woke the next morning she felt a great lightness of heart. She\nrecalled her last awakening at Givre, three days before, when it had\nseemed as though all her life had gone down in darkness. Now Darrow\nwas once more under the same roof with her, and once more his nearness\nsufficed to make the looming horror drop away. She could almost have\nsmiled at her scruples of the night before: as she looked back on them\nthey seemed to belong to the old ignorant timorous time when she had\nfeared to look life in the face, and had been blind to the mysteries and\ncontradictions of the human heart because her own had not been revealed\nto her. Darrow had said: \"You were made to feel everything\"; and to feel\nwas surely better than to judge.\n\nWhen she came downstairs he was already in the oak-room with Effie and\nMadame de Chantelle, and the sense of reassurance which his presence\ngave her was merged in the relief of not being able to speak of what was\nbetween them. But there it was, inevitably, and whenever they looked at\neach other they saw it. In her dread of giving it a more tangible shape\nshe tried to devise means of keeping the little girl with her, and,\nwhen the latter had been called away by the nurse, found an excuse for\nfollowing Madame de Chantelle upstairs to the purple sitting-room. But\na confidential talk with Madame de Chantelle implied the detailed\ndiscussion of plans of which Anna could hardly yet bear to consider the\nvaguest outline: the date of her marriage, the relative advantages of\nsailing from London or Lisbon, the possibility of hiring a habitable\nhouse at their new post; and, when these problems were exhausted, the\napplication of the same method to the subject of Owen's future.\n\nHis grandmother, having no suspicion of the real reason of Sophy Viner's\ndeparture, had thought it \"extremely suitable\" of the young girl to\nwithdraw to the shelter of her old friends' roof in the hour of bridal\npreparation. This maidenly retreat had in fact impressed Madame de\nChantelle so favourably that she was disposed for the first time to talk\nover Owen's projects; and as every human event translated itself for her\ninto terms of social and domestic detail, Anna had perforce to travel\nthe same round again. She felt a momentary relief when Darrow presently\njoined them; but his coming served only to draw the conversation back to\nthe question of their own future, and Anna felt a new pang as she heard\nhim calmly and lucidly discussing it. Did such self-possession imply\nindifference or insincerity? In that problem her mind perpetually\nrevolved; and she dreaded the one answer as much as the other.\n\nShe was resolved to keep on her course as though nothing had happened:\nto marry Darrow and never let the consciousness of the past intrude\nitself between them; but she was beginning to feel that the only way of\nattaining to this state of detachment from the irreparable was once for\nall to turn back with him to its contemplation. As soon as this desire\nhad germinated it became so strong in her that she regretted having\npromised Effie to take her out for the afternoon. But she could think\nof no pretext for disappointing the little girl, and soon after luncheon\nthe three set forth in the motor to show Darrow a chateau famous in the\nannals of the region. During their excursion Anna found it impossible to\nguess from his demeanour if Effie's presence between them was as much\nof a strain to his composure as to hers. He remained imperturbably\ngood-humoured and appreciative while they went the round of the\nmonument, and she remarked only that when he thought himself unnoticed\nhis face grew grave and his answers came less promptly.\n\nOn the way back, two or three miles from Givre, she suddenly proposed\nthat they should walk home through the forest which skirted that side of\nthe park. Darrow acquiesced, and they got out and sent Effie on in the\nmotor. Their way led through a bit of sober French woodland, flat as a\nfaded tapestry, but with gleams of live emerald lingering here and there\namong its browns and ochres. The luminous grey air gave vividness to its\ndying colours, and veiled the distant glimpses of the landscape in soft\nuncertainty. In such a solitude Anna had fancied it would be easier to\nspeak; but as she walked beside Darrow over the deep soundless flooring\nof brown moss the words on her lips took flight again. It seemed\nimpossible to break the spell of quiet joy which his presence laid on\nher, and when he began to talk of the place they had just visited she\nanswered his questions and then waited for what he should say next...No,\ndecidedly she could not speak; she no longer even knew what she had\nmeant to say...\n\nThe same experience repeated itself several times that day and the\nnext. When she and Darrow were apart she exhausted herself in appeal and\ninterrogation, she formulated with a fervent lucidity every point in\nher imaginary argument. But as soon as she was alone with him something\ndeeper than reason and subtler than shyness laid its benumbing touch\nupon her, and the desire to speak became merely a dim disquietude,\nthrough which his looks, his words, his touch, reached her as through\na mist of bodily pain. Yet this inertia was torn by wild flashes of\nresistance, and when they were apart she began to prepare again what she\nmeant to say to him.\n\nShe knew he could not be with her without being aware of this inner\nturmoil, and she hoped he would break the spell by some releasing word.\nBut she presently understood that he recognized the futility of words,\nand was resolutely bent on holding her to her own purpose of behaving\nas if nothing had happened. Once more she inwardly accused him of\ninsensibility, and her imagination was beset by tormenting visions of\nhis past...Had such things happened to him before? If the episode had\nbeen an isolated accident--\"a moment of folly and madness\", as he had\ncalled it--she could understand, or at least begin to understand (for\nat a certain point her imagination always turned back); but if it were\na mere link in a chain of similar experiments, the thought of it\ndishonoured her whole past...\n\nEffie, in the interregnum between governesses, had been given leave to\ndine downstairs; and Anna, on the evening of Darrow's return, kept the\nlittle girl with her till long after the nurse had signalled from\nthe drawing-room door. When at length she had been carried off, Anna\nproposed a game of cards, and after this diversion had drawn to its\nlanguid close she said good-night to Darrow and followed Madame de\nChantelle upstairs. But Madame de Chantelle never sat up late, and the\nsecond evening, with the amiably implied intention of leaving Anna and\nDarrow to themselves, she took an earlier leave of them than usual.\n\nAnna sat silent, listening to her small stiff steps as they minced down\nthe hall and died out in the distance. Madame de Chantelle had broken\nher wooden embroidery frame, and Darrow, having offered to repair it,\nhad drawn his chair up to a table that held a lamp. Anna watched him\nas he sat with bent head and knitted brows, trying to fit together\nthe disjoined pieces. The sight of him, so tranquilly absorbed in\nthis trifling business, seemed to give to the quiet room a perfume of\nintimacy, to fill it with a sense of sweet familiar habit; and it came\nover her again that she knew nothing of the inner thoughts of this man\nwho was sitting by her as a husband might. The lamplight fell on his\nwhite forehead, on the healthy brown of his cheek, the backs of his thin\nsunburnt hands. As she watched the hands her sense of them became as\nvivid as a touch, and she said to herself: \"That other woman has sat\nand watched him as I am doing. She has known him as I have never known\nhim...Perhaps he is thinking of that now. Or perhaps he has forgotten\nit all as completely as I have forgotten everything that happened to me\nbefore he came...\"\n\nHe looked young, active, stored with strength and energy; not the man\nfor vain repinings or long memories. She wondered what she had to hold\nor satisfy him. He loved her now; she had no doubt of that; but how\ncould she hope to keep him? They were so nearly of an age that already\nshe felt herself his senior. As yet the difference was not visible;\noutwardly at least they were matched; but ill-health or unhappiness\nwould soon do away with this equality. She thought with a pang of\nbitterness: \"He won't grow any older because he doesn't feel things; and\nbecause he doesn't, I SHALL...\"\n\nAnd when she ceased to please him, what then? Had he the tradition of\nfaith to the spoken vow, or the deeper piety of the unspoken dedication?\nWhat was his theory, what his inner conviction in such matters? But what\ndid she care for his convictions or his theories? No doubt he loved her\nnow, and believed he would always go on loving her, and was persuaded\nthat, if he ceased to, his loyalty would be proof against the change.\nWhat she wanted to know was not what he thought about it in advance, but\nwhat would impel or restrain him at the crucial hour. She put no faith\nin her own arts: she was too sure of having none! And if some beneficent\nenchanter had bestowed them on her, she knew now that she would have\nrejected the gift. She could hardly conceive of wanting the kind of love\nthat was a state one could be cozened into...\n\nDarrow, putting away the frame, walked across the room and sat down\nbeside her; and she felt he had something special to say.\n\n\"They're sure to send for me in a day or two now,\" he began.\n\nShe made no answer, and he continued: \"You'll tell me before I go what\nday I'm to come back and get you?\"\n\nIt was the first time since his return to Givre that he had made any\ndirect allusion to the date of their marriage; and instead of answering\nhim she broke out: \"There's something I've been wanting you to know. The\nother day in Paris I saw Miss Viner.\"\n\nShe saw him flush with the intensity of his surprise.\n\n\"You sent for her?\"\n\n\"No; she heard from Adelaide that I was in Paris and she came. She came\nbecause she wanted to urge me to marry you. I thought you ought to know\nwhat she had done.\"\n\nDarrow stood up. \"I'm glad you've told me.\" He spoke with a visible\neffort at composure. Her eyes followed him as he moved away.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked after an interval.\n\n\"It seems to me a great deal.\"\n\n\"It's what she'd already asked me.\" His voice showed her how deeply he\nwas moved, and a throb of jealousy shot through her.\n\n\"Oh, it was for your sake, I know!\" He made no answer, and she added:\n\"She's been exceedingly generous...Why shouldn't we speak of it?\"\n\nShe had lowered her head, but through her dropped lids she seemed to be\nwatching the crowded scene of his face.\n\n\"I've not shrunk from speaking of it.\"\n\n\"Speaking of her, then, I mean. It seems to me that if I could talk to\nyou about her I should know better----\"\n\nShe broke off, confused, and he questioned: \"What is it you want to know\nbetter?\"\n\nThe colour rose to her forehead. How could she tell him what she\nscarcely dared own to herself? There was nothing she did not want to\nknow, no fold or cranny of his secret that her awakened imagination did\nnot strain to penetrate; but she could not expose Sophy Viner to\nthe base fingerings of a retrospective jealousy, nor Darrow to the\ntemptation of belittling her in the effort to better his own case. The\ngirl had been magnificent, and the only worthy return that Anna could\nmake was to take Darrow from her without a question if she took him at\nall...\n\nShe lifted her eyes to his face. \"I think I only wanted to speak her\nname. It's not right that we should seem so afraid of it. If I were\nreally afraid of it I should have to give you up,\" she said.\n\nHe bent over her and caught her to him. \"Ah, you can't give me up now!\"\nhe exclaimed.\n\nShe suffered him to hold her fast without speaking; but the old dread\nwas between them again, and it was on her lips to cry out: \"How can I\nhelp it, when I AM so afraid?\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nThe next morning the dread was still there, and she understood that she\nmust snatch herself out of the torpor of the will into which she had\nbeen gradually sinking, and tell Darrow that she could not be his wife.\n\nThe knowledge came to her in the watches of a sleepless night, when,\nthrough the tears of disenchanted passion, she stared back upon her\npast. There it lay before her, her sole romance, in all its paltry\npoverty, the cheapest of cheap adventures, the most pitiful of\nsentimental blunders. She looked about her room, the room where, for so\nmany years, if her heart had been quiescent her thoughts had been\nalive, and pictured herself henceforth cowering before a throng of mean\nsuspicions, of unavowed compromises and concessions. In that moment of\nself-searching she saw that Sophy Viner had chosen the better part, and\nthat certain renunciations might enrich where possession would have left\na desert.\n\nPassionate reactions of instinct fought against these efforts of her\nwill. Why should past or future coerce her, when the present was so\nsecurely hers? Why insanely surrender what the other would after all\nnever have? Her sense of irony whispered that if she sent away Darrow\nit would not be to Sophy Viner, but to the first woman who crossed his\npath--as, in a similar hour, Sophy Viner herself had crossed it...But\nthe mere fact that she could think such things of him sent her\nshuddering back to the opposite pole. She pictured herself gradually\nsubdued to such a conception of life and love, she pictured\nEffie growing up under the influence of the woman she saw herself\nbecoming--and she hid her eyes from the humiliation of the picture...\n\n\nThey were at luncheon when the summons that Darrow expected was brought\nto him. He handed the telegram to Anna, and she learned that his\nAmbassador, on the way to a German cure, was to be in Paris the next\nevening and wished to confer with him there before he went back to\nLondon. The idea that the decisive moment was at hand was so agitating\nto her that when luncheon was over she slipped away to the terrace and\nthence went down alone to the garden. The day was grey but mild, with\nthe heaviness of decay in the air. She rambled on aimlessly, following\nunder the denuded boughs the path she and Darrow had taken on their\nfirst walk to the river. She was sure he would not try to overtake her:\nsure he would guess why she wished to be alone. There were moments when\nit seemed to double her loneliness to be so certain of his reading her\nheart while she was so desperately ignorant of his...\n\nShe wandered on for more than an hour, and when she returned to the\nhouse she saw, as she entered the hall, that Darrow was seated at the\ndesk in Owen's study. He heard her step, and looking up turned in his\nchair without rising. Their eyes met, and she saw that his were clear\nand smiling. He had a heap of papers at his elbow and was evidently\nengaged in some official correspondence. She wondered that he could\naddress himself so composedly to his task, and then ironically reflected\nthat such detachment was a sign of his superiority. She crossed the\nthreshold and went toward him; but as she advanced she had a sudden\nvision of Owen, standing outside in the cold autumn dusk and watching\nDarrow and Sophy Viner as they faced each other across the lamplit\ndesk...The evocation was so vivid that it caught her breath like a blow,\nand she sank down helplessly on the divan among the piled-up books.\nDistinctly, at the moment, she understood that the end had come. \"When\nhe speaks to me I will tell him!\" she thought...\n\nDarrow, laying aside his pen, looked at her for a moment in silence;\nthen he stood up and shut the door.\n\n\"I must go to-morrow early,\" he said, sitting down beside her. His voice\nwas grave, with a slight tinge of sadness. She said to herself: \"He\nknows what I am feeling...\" and now the thought made her feel less\nalone. The expression of his face was stern and yet tender: for the\nfirst time she understood what he had suffered.\n\nShe had no doubt as to the necessity of giving him up, but it was\nimpossible to tell him so then. She stood up and said: \"I'll leave you\nto your letters.\" He made no protest, but merely answered: \"You'll come\ndown presently for a walk?\" and it occurred to her at once that she\nwould walk down to the river with him, and give herself for the last\ntime the tragic luxury of sitting at his side in the little pavilion.\n\"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"it will be easier to tell him there.\"\n\nIt did not, on the way home from their walk, become any easier to tell\nhim; but her secret decision to do so before he left gave her a kind\nof factitious calm and laid a melancholy ecstasy upon the hour. Still\nskirting the subject that fanned their very faces with its flame, they\nclung persistently to other topics, and it seemed to Anna that their\nminds had never been nearer together than in this hour when their hearts\nwere so separate. In the glow of interchanged love she had grown less\nconscious of that other glow of interchanged thought which had once\nillumined her mind. She had forgotten how Darrow had widened her world\nand lengthened out all her perspectives, and with a pang of double\ndestitution she saw herself alone among her shrunken thoughts.\n\nFor the first time, then, she had a clear vision of what her life would\nbe without him. She imagined herself trying to take up the daily round,\nand all that had lightened and animated it seemed equally lifeless and\nvain. She tried to think of herself as wholly absorbed in her daughter's\ndevelopment, like other mothers she had seen; but she supposed those\nmothers must have had stored memories of happiness to nourish them. She\nhad had nothing, and all her starved youth still claimed its due.\n\nWhen she went up to dress for dinner she said to herself: \"I'll have\nmy last evening with him, and then, before we say good night, I'll tell\nhim.\"\n\nThis postponement did not seem unjustified. Darrow had shown her how\nhe dreaded vain words, how resolved he was to avoid all fruitless\ndiscussion. He must have been intensely aware of what had been going on\nin her mind since his return, yet when she had attempted to reveal it\nto him he had turned from the revelation. She was therefore merely\nfollowing the line he had traced in behaving, till the final moment\ncame, as though there were nothing more to say...\n\nThat moment seemed at last to be at hand when, at her usual hour after\ndinner, Madame de Chantelle rose to go upstairs. She lingered a little\nto bid good-bye to Darrow, whom she was not likely to see in the\nmorning; and her affable allusions to his prompt return sounded in\nAnna's ear like the note of destiny.\n\nA cold rain had fallen all day, and for greater warmth and intimacy they\nhad gone after dinner to the oak-room, shutting out the chilly vista of\nthe farther drawing-rooms. The autumn wind, coming up from the river,\ncried about the house with a voice of loss and separation; and Anna and\nDarrow sat silent, as if they feared to break the hush that shut them\nin. The solitude, the fire-light, the harmony of soft hangings and old\ndim pictures, wove about them a spell of security through which Anna\nfelt, far down in her heart, the muffled beat of an inextinguishable\nbliss. How could she have thought that this last moment would be the\nmoment to speak to him, when it seemed to have gathered up into its\nflight all the scattered splendours of her dream?\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nDarrow continued to stand by the door after it had closed. Anna felt\nthat he was looking at her, and sat still, disdaining to seek refuge in\nany evasive word or movement. For the last time she wanted to let him\ntake from her the fulness of what the sight of her could give.\n\nHe crossed over and sat down on the sofa. For a moment neither of them\nspoke; then he said: \"To-night, dearest, I must have my answer.\"\n\nShe straightened herself under the shock of his seeming to take the very\nwords from her lips.\n\n\"To-night?\" was all that she could falter.\n\n\"I must be off by the early train. There won't be more than a moment in\nthe morning.\"\n\nHe had taken her hand, and she said to herself that she must free it\nbefore she could go on with what she had to say. Then she rejected this\nconcession to a weakness she was resolved to defy. To the end she would\nleave her hand in his hand, her eyes in his eyes: she would not, in\ntheir final hour together, be afraid of any part of her love for him.\n\n\"You'll tell me to-night, dear,\" he insisted gently; and his insistence\ngave her the strength to speak.\n\n\"There's something I must ask you,\" she broke out, perceiving, as she\nheard her words, that they were not in the least what she had meant to\nsay.\n\nHe sat still, waiting, and she pressed on: \"Do such things happen to men\noften?\"\n\nThe quiet room seemed to resound with the long reverberations of her\nquestion. She looked away from him, and he released her and stood up.\n\n\"I don't know what happens to other men. Such a thing never happened to\nme...\"\n\nShe turned her eyes back to his face. She felt like a traveller on a\ngiddy path between a cliff and a precipice: there was nothing for it now\nbut to go on.\n\n\"Had it...had it begun...before you met her in Paris?\"\n\n\"No; a thousand times no! I've told you the facts as they were.\"\n\n\"All the facts?\"\n\nHe turned abruptly. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nHer throat was dry and the loud pulses drummed in her temples.\n\n\"I mean--about her...Perhaps you knew...knew things about\nher...beforehand.\"\n\nShe stopped. The room had grown profoundly still. A log dropped to the\nhearth and broke there in a hissing shower.\n\nDarrow spoke in a clear voice. \"I knew nothing, absolutely nothing,\" he\nsaid.\n\nShe had the answer to her inmost doubt--to her last shameful unavowed\nhope. She sat powerless under her woe.\n\nHe walked to the fireplace and pushed back the broken log with his foot.\nA flame shot out of it, and in the upward glare she saw his pale face,\nstern with misery.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\nShe made a slight sign with her head and he came slowly back to her.\n\"Then is this to be good-bye?\"\n\nAgain she signed a faint assent, and he made no effort to touch her or\ndraw nearer. \"You understand that I sha'n't come back?\"\n\nHe was looking at her, and she tried to return his look, but her eyes\nwere blind with tears, and in dread of his seeing them she got up and\nwalked away. He did not follow her, and she stood with her back to him,\nstaring at a bowl of carnations on a little table strewn with books. Her\ntears magnified everything she looked at, and the streaked petals of the\ncarnations, their fringed edges and frail curled stamens, pressed upon\nher, huge and vivid. She noticed among the books a volume of verse he\nhad sent her from England, and tried to remember whether it was before\nor after...\n\nShe felt that he was waiting for her to speak, and at last she turned to\nhim. \"I shall see you to-morrow before you go...\"\n\nHe made no answer.\n\nShe moved toward the door and he held it open for her. She saw his hand\non the door, and his seal ring in its setting of twisted silver; and the\nsense of the end of all things came to her.\n\nThey walked down the drawing-rooms, between the shadowy reflections of\nscreens and cabinets, and mounted the stairs side by side. At the end of\nthe gallery, a lamp brought out turbid gleams in the smoky battle-piece\nabove it.\n\nOn the landing Darrow stopped; his room was the nearest to the stairs.\n\"Good night,\" he said, holding out his hand.\n\nAs Anna gave him hers the springs of grief broke loose in her. She\nstruggled with her sobs, and subdued them; but her breath came unevenly,\nand to hide her agitation she leaned on him and pressed her face against\nhis arm.\n\n\"Don't--don't,\" he whispered, soothing her.\n\nHer troubled breathing sounded loudly in the silence of the sleeping\nhouse. She pressed her lips tight, but could not stop the nervous\npulsations in her throat, and he put an arm about her and, opening his\ndoor, drew her across the threshold of his room. The door shut\nbehind her and she sat down on the lounge at the foot of the bed. The\npulsations in her throat had ceased, but she knew they would begin again\nif she tried to speak.\n\nDarrow walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece. The red-veiled\nlamp shone on his books and papers, on the arm-chair by the fire, and\nthe scattered objects on his dressing-table. A log glimmered on the\nhearth, and the room was warm and faintly smoke-scented. It was the\nfirst time she had ever been in a room he lived in, among his personal\npossessions and the traces of his daily usage. Every object about her\nseemed to contain a particle of himself: the whole air breathed of him,\nsteeping her in the sense of his intimate presence.\n\nSuddenly she thought: \"This is what Sophy Viner knew\"...and with a\ntorturing precision she pictured them alone in such a scene...Had he\ntaken the girl to an hotel...where did people go in such cases? Wherever\nthey were, the silence of night had been around them, and the things he\nused had been strewn about the room...Anna, ashamed of dwelling on the\ndetested vision, stood up with a confused impulse of flight; then a wave\nof contrary feeling arrested her and she paused with lowered head.\n\nDarrow had come forward as she rose, and she perceived that he was\nwaiting for her to bid him good night. It was clear that no other\npossibility had even brushed his mind; and the fact, for some dim\nreason, humiliated her. \"Why not...why not?\" something whispered in her,\nas though his forbearance, his tacit recognition of her pride, were a\nslight on other qualities she wanted him to feel in her.\n\n\"In the morning, then?\" she heard him say.\n\n\"Yes, in the morning,\" she repeated.\n\nShe continued to stand in the same place, looking vaguely about the\nroom. For once before they parted--since part they must--she longed to\nbe to him all that Sophy Viner had been; but she remained rooted to the\nfloor, unable to find a word or imagine a gesture that should express\nher meaning. Exasperated by her helplessness, she thought: \"Don't I feel\nthings as other women do?\"\n\nHer eye fell on a note-case she had given him. It was worn at the\ncorners with the friction of his pocket and distended with thickly\npacked papers. She wondered if he carried her letters in it, and she put\nher hand out and touched it.\n\nAll that he and she had ever felt or seen, their close encounters\nof word and look, and the closer contact of their silences, trembled\nthrough her at the touch. She remembered things he had said that had\nbeen like new skies above her head: ways he had that seemed a part of\nthe air she breathed. The faint warmth of her girlish love came back\nto her, gathering heat as it passed through her thoughts; and her heart\nrocked like a boat on the surge of its long long memories. \"It's because\nI love him in too many ways,\" she thought; and slowly she turned to the\ndoor.\n\nShe was aware that Darrow was still silently watching her, but he\nneither stirred nor spoke till she had reached the threshold. Then he\nmet her there and caught her in his arms.\n\n\"Not to-night--don't tell me to-night!\" he whispered; and she leaned\naway from him, closing her eyes for an instant, and then slowly opening\nthem to the flood of light in his.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nAnna and Darrow, the next day, sat alone in a compartment of the Paris\ntrain.\n\nAnna, when they entered it, had put herself in the farthest corner\nand placed her bag on the adjoining seat. She had decided suddenly to\naccompany Darrow to Paris, had even persuaded him to wait for a later\ntrain in order that they might travel together. She had an intense\nlonging to be with him, an almost morbid terror of losing sight of him\nfor a moment: when he jumped out of the train and ran back along the\nplatform to buy a newspaper for her she felt as though she should never\nsee him again, and shivered with the cold misery of her last journey\nto Paris, when she had thought herself parted from him forever. Yet she\nwanted to keep him at a distance, on the other side of the compartment,\nand as the train moved out of the station she drew from her bag the\nletters she had thrust in it as she left the house, and began to glance\nover them so that her lowered lids should hide her eyes from him.\n\nShe was his now, his for life: there could never again be any question\nof sacrificing herself to Effie's welfare, or to any other abstract\nconception of duty. Effie of course would not suffer; Anna would pay for\nher bliss as a wife by redoubled devotion as a mother. Her scruples\nwere not overcome; but for the time their voices were drowned in the\ntumultuous rumour of her happiness.\n\nAs she opened her letters she was conscious that Darrow's gaze was fixed\non her, and gradually it drew her eyes upward, and she drank deep of the\npassionate tenderness in his. Then the blood rose to her face and she\nfelt again the desire to shield herself. She turned back to her letters\nand her glance lit on an envelope inscribed in Owen's hand.\n\nHer heart began to beat oppressively: she was in a mood when the\nsimplest things seemed ominous. What could Owen have to say to her? Only\nthe first page was covered, and it contained simply the announcement\nthat, in the company of a young compatriot who was studying at the Beaux\nArts, he had planned to leave for Spain the following evening.\n\n\"He hasn't seen her, then!\" was Anna's instant thought; and her feeling\nwas a strange compound of humiliation and relief. The girl had kept her\nword, lived up to the line of conduct she had set herself; and Anna\nhad failed in the same attempt. She did not reproach herself with\nher failure; but she would have been happier if there had been less\ndiscrepancy between her words to Sophy Viner and the act which had\nfollowed them. It irritated her obscurely that the girl should have been\nso much surer of her power to carry out her purpose...\n\nAnna looked up and saw that Darrow's eyes were on the newspaper. He\nseemed calm and secure, almost indifferent to her presence. \"Will it\nbecome a matter of course to him so soon?\" she wondered with a twinge of\njealousy. She sat motionless, her eyes fixed on him, trying to make him\nfeel the attraction of her gaze as she felt his. It surprised and shamed\nher to detect a new element in her love for him: a sort of suspicious\ntyrannical tenderness that seemed to deprive it of all serenity. Finally\nhe looked up, his smile enveloped her, and she felt herself his in every\nfibre, his so completely and inseparably that she saw the vanity of\nimagining any other fate for herself.\n\nTo give herself a countenance she held out Owen's letter. He took it and\nglanced down the page, his face grown grave. She waited nervously till\nhe looked up.\n\n\"That's a good plan; the best thing that could happen,\" he said, a just\nperceptible shade of constraint in his tone.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she hastily assented. She was aware of a faint current of\nrelief silently circulating between them. They were both glad that Owen\nwas going, that for a while he would be out of their way; and it seemed\nto her horrible that so much of the stuff of their happiness should be\nmade of such unavowed feelings...\n\n\"I shall see him this evening,\" she said, wishing Darrow to feel that\nshe was not afraid of meeting her step-son.\n\n\"Yes, of course; perhaps he might dine with you.\"\n\nThe words struck her as strangely obtuse. Darrow was to meet his\nAmbassador at the station on the latter's arrival, and would in all\nprobability have to spend the evening with him, and Anna knew he had\nbeen concerned at the thought of having to leave her alone. But how\ncould he speak in that careless tone of her dining with Owen? She\nlowered her voice to say: \"I'm afraid he's desperately unhappy.\"\n\nHe answered, with a tinge of impatience: \"It's much the best thing that\nhe should travel.\"\n\n\"Yes--but don't you feel...\" She broke off. She knew how he disliked\nthese idle returns on the irrevocable, and her fear of doing or saying\nwhat he disliked was tinged by a new instinct of subserviency against\nwhich her pride revolted. She thought to herself: \"He will see the\nchange, and grow indifferent to me as he did to HER...\" and for a moment\nit seemed to her that she was reliving the experience of Sophy Viner.\n\nDarrow made no attempt to learn the end of her unfinished sentence. He\nhanded back Owen's letter and returned to his newspaper; and when he\nlooked up from it a few minutes later it was with a clear brow and a\nsmile that irresistibly drew her back to happier thoughts.\n\nThe train was just entering a station, and a moment later their\ncompartment was invaded by a commonplace couple preoccupied with\nthe bestowal of bulging packages. Anna, at their approach, felt the\npossessive pride of the woman in love when strangers are between herself\nand the man she loves. She asked Darrow to open the window, to place her\nbag in the net, to roll her rug into a cushion for her feet; and while\nhe was thus busied with her she was conscious of a new devotion in his\ntone, in his way of bending over her and meeting her eyes. He went back\nto his seat, and they looked at each other like lovers smiling at a\nhappy secret.\n\nAnna, before going back to Givre, had suggested Owen's moving into her\napartment, but he had preferred to remain at the hotel to which he had\nsent his luggage, and on arriving in Paris she decided to drive there at\nonce. She was impatient to have the meeting over, and glad that Darrow\nwas obliged to leave her at the station in order to look up a colleague\nat the Embassy. She dreaded his seeing Owen again, and yet dared not\ntell him so, and to ensure his remaining away she mentioned an urgent\nengagement with her dress-maker and a long list of commissions to be\nexecuted for Madame de Chantelle.\n\n\"I shall see you to-morrow morning,\" she said; but he replied with a\nsmile that he would certainly find time to come to her for a moment on\nhis way back from meeting the Ambassador; and when he had put her in a\ncab he leaned through the window to press his lips to hers.\n\nShe blushed like a girl, thinking, half vexed, half happy: \"Yesterday he\nwould not have done it...\" and a dozen scarcely definable differences\nin his look and manner seemed all at once to be summed up in the boyish\nact. \"After all, I'm engaged to him,\" she reflected, and then smiled\nat the absurdity of the word. The next instant, with a pang of\nself-reproach, she remembered Sophy Viner's cry: \"I knew all the while\nhe didn't care...\" \"Poor thing, oh poor thing!\" Anna murmured...\n\n\nAt Owen's hotel she waited in a tremor while the porter went in search\nof him. Word was presently brought back that he was in his room and\nbegged her to come up, and as she crossed the hall she caught sight of\nhis portmanteaux lying on the floor, already labelled for departure.\n\nOwen sat at a table writing, his back to the door; and when he stood up\nthe window was behind him, so that, in the rainy afternoon light, his\nfeatures were barely discernible.\n\n\"Dearest--so you're really off?\" she said, hesitating a moment on the\nthreshold.\n\nHe pushed a chair forward, and they sat down, each waiting for the\nother to speak. Finally she put some random question about his\ntravelling-companion, a slow shy meditative youth whom he had once or\ntwice brought down to Givre. She reflected that it was natural he should\nhave given this uncommunicative comrade the preference over his livelier\nacquaintances, and aloud she said: \"I'm so glad Fred Rempson can go with\nyou.\"\n\nOwen answered in the same tone, and for a few minutes their talk dragged\nitself on over a dry waste of common-places. Anna noticed that, though\nready enough to impart his own plans, Owen studiously abstained from\nputting any questions about hers. It was evident from his allusions that\nhe meant to be away for some time, and he presently asked her if she\nwould give instructions about packing and sending after him some winter\nclothes he had left at Givre. This gave her the opportunity to say that\nshe expected to go back within a day or two and would attend to the\nmatter as soon as she returned. She added: \"I came up this morning with\nGeorge, who is going on to London to-morrow,\" intending, by the use\nof Darrow's Christian name, to give Owen the chance to speak of her\nmarriage. But he made no comment, and she continued to hear the name\nsounding on unfamiliarly between them.\n\nThe room was almost dark, and she finally stood up and glanced about for\nthe light-switch, saying: \"I can't see you, dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't--I hate the light!\" Owen exclaimed, catching her by the wrist\nand pushing her back into her seat. He gave a nervous laugh and added:\n\"I'm half-blind with neuralgia. I suppose it's this beastly rain.\"\n\n\"Yes; it will do you good to get down to Spain.\"\n\nShe asked if he had the remedies the doctor had given him for a previous\nattack, and on his replying that he didn't know what he'd done with the\nstuff, she sprang up, offering to go to the chemist's. It was a\nrelief to have something to do for him, and she knew from his \"Oh,\nthanks--would you?\" that it was a relief to him to have a pretext for\nnot detaining her. His natural impulse would have been to declare that\nhe didn't want any drugs, and would be all right in no time; and his\nacquiescence showed her how profoundly he felt the uselessness of their\ntrying to prolong their talk. His face was now no more than a white blur\nin the dusk, but she felt its indistinctness as a veil drawn over aching\nintensities of expression. \"He knows...he knows...\" she said to\nherself, and wondered whether the truth had been revealed to him by some\ncorroborative fact or by the sheer force of divination.\n\nHe had risen also, and was clearly waiting for her to go, and she turned\nto the door, saying: \"I'll be back in a moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't come up again, please!\" He paused, embarrassed. \"I mean--I\nmay not be here. I've got to go and pick up Rempson, and see about some\nfinal things with him.\" She stopped on the threshold with a sinking\nheart. He meant this to be their leave-taking, then--and he had not\neven asked her when she was to be married, or spoken of seeing her again\nbefore she set out for the other side of the world.\n\n\"Owen!\" she cried, and turned back.\n\nHe stood mutely before her in the dimness.\n\n\"You haven't told me how long you're to be gone.\"\n\n\"How long? Oh, you see...that's rather vague...I hate definite dates,\nyou know...\"\n\nHe paused and she saw he did not mean to help her out. She tried to say:\n\"You'll be here for my wedding?\" but could not bring the words to her\nlips. Instead she murmured: \"In six weeks I shall be going too...\" and\nhe rejoined, as if he had expected the announcement and prepared his\nanswer: \"Oh, by that time, very likely...\"\n\n\"At any rate, I won't say good-bye,\" she stammered, feeling the tears\nbeneath her veil.\n\n\"No, no; rather not!\" he declared; but he made no movement, and she went\nup and threw her arms about him. \"You'll write me, won't you?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course----\"\n\nHer hands slipped down into his, and for a minute they held each other\ndumbly in the darkness; then he gave a vague laugh and said: \"It's\nreally time to light up.\" He pressed the electric button with one hand\nwhile with the other he opened the door; and she passed out without\ndaring to turn back, lest the light on his face should show her what she\nfeared to see.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nAnna drove to the chemist's for Owen's remedy. On the way she stopped\nher cab at a book-shop, and emerged from it laden with literature. She\nknew what would interest Owen, and what he was likely to have read,\nand she had made her choice among the newest publications with the\npromptness of a discriminating reader. But on the way back to the hotel\nshe was overcome by the irony of adding this mental panacea to the\nother. There was something grotesque and almost mocking in the idea of\noffering a judicious selection of literature to a man setting out on\nsuch a journey. \"He knows...he knows...\" she kept on repeating; and\ngiving the porter the parcel from the chemist's she drove away without\nleaving the books. She went to her apartment, whither her maid had\npreceded her. There was a fire in the drawing-room and the tea-table\nstood ready by the hearth. The stormy rain beat against the uncurtained\nwindows, and she thought of Owen, who would soon be driving through it\nto the station, alone with his bitter thoughts. She had been proud of\nthe fact that he had always sought her help in difficult hours; and now,\nin the most difficult of all, she was the one being to whom he could\nnot turn. Between them, henceforth, there would always be the wall of an\ninsurmountable silence...She strained her aching thoughts to guess how\nthe truth had come to him. Had he seen the girl, and had she told him?\nInstinctively, Anna rejected this conjecture. But what need was there of\nassuming an explicit statement, when every breath they had drawn for the\nlast weeks had been charged with the immanent secret? As she looked back\nover the days since Darrow's first arrival at Givre she perceived\nthat at no time had any one deliberately spoken, or anything been\naccidentally disclosed. The truth had come to light by the force of its\nirresistible pressure; and the perception gave her a startled sense of\nhidden powers, of a chaos of attractions and repulsions far beneath\nthe ordered surfaces of intercourse. She looked back with melancholy\nderision on her old conception of life, as a kind of well-lit and well\npoliced suburb to dark places one need never know about. Here they were,\nthese dark places, in her own bosom, and henceforth she would always\nhave to traverse them to reach the beings she loved best!\n\nShe was still sitting beside the untouched tea-table when she heard\nDarrow's voice in the hall. She started up, saying to herself: \"I must\ntell him that Owen knows...\" but when the door opened and she saw his\nface, still lit by the same smile of boyish triumph, she felt anew the\nuselessness of speaking...Had he ever supposed that Owen would not know?\nProbably, from the height of his greater experience, he had seen long\nsince that all that happened was inevitable; and the thought of it, at\nany rate, was clearly not weighing on him now.\n\nHe was already dressed for the evening, and as he came toward her he\nsaid: \"The Ambassador's booked for an official dinner and I'm free after\nall. Where shall we dine?\"\n\nAnna had pictured herself sitting alone all the evening with her\nwretched thoughts, and the fact of having to put them out of her mind\nfor the next few hours gave her an immediate sensation of relief.\nAlready her pulses were dancing to the tune of Darrow's, and as they\nsmiled at each other she thought: \"Nothing can ever change the fact that\nI belong to him.\"\n\n\"Where shall we dine?\" he repeated gaily, and she named a well-known\nrestaurant for which she had once heard him express a preference. But as\nshe did so she fancied she saw a shadow on his face, and instantly she\nsaid to herself: \"It was THERE he went with her!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not there, after all!\" she interrupted herself; and now she was\nsure his colour deepened.\n\n\"Where shall it be, then?\"\n\nShe noticed that he did not ask the reason of her change, and this\nconvinced her that she had guessed the truth, and that he knew she had\nguessed it. \"He will always know what I am thinking, and he will\nnever dare to ask me,\" she thought; and she saw between them the same\ninsurmountable wall of silence as between herself and Owen, a wall of\nglass through which they could watch each other's faintest motions but\nwhich no sound could ever traverse...\n\nThey drove to a restaurant on the Boulevard, and there, in their\nintimate corner of the serried scene, the sense of what was unspoken\nbetween them gradually ceased to oppress her. He looked so light-hearted\nand handsome, so ingenuously proud of her, so openly happy at being with\nher, that no other fact could seem real in his presence. He had learned\nthat the Ambassador was to spend two days in Paris, and he had reason to\nhope that in consequence his own departure for London would be deferred.\nHe was exhilarated by the prospect of being with Anna for a few hours\nlonger, and she did not ask herself if his exhilaration were a sign of\ninsensibility, for she was too conscious of his power of swaying her\nmoods not to be secretly proud of affecting his.\n\nThey lingered for some time over the fruit and coffee, and when they\nrose to go Darrow suggested that, if she felt disposed for the play,\nthey were not too late for the second part of the programme at one of\nthe smaller theatres.\n\nHis mention of the hour recalled Owen to her thoughts. She saw his train\nrushing southward through the storm, and, in a corner of the swaying\ncompartment, his face, white and indistinct as it had loomed on her in\nthe rainy twilight. It was horrible to be thus perpetually paying for\nher happiness!\n\nDarrow had called for a theatrical journal, and he presently looked up\nfrom it to say: \"I hear the second play at the Athenee is amusing.\"\n\nIt was on Anna's lips to acquiesce; but as she was about to speak she\nwondered if it were not at the Athenee that Owen had seen Darrow with\nSophy Viner. She was not sure he had even mentioned the theatre, but the\nmere possibility was enough to darken her sky. It was hateful to her to\nthink of accompanying Darrow to places where the girl had been with him.\nShe tried to reason away this scruple, she even reminded herself with\na bitter irony that whenever she was in Darrow's arms she was where the\ngirl had been before her--but she could not shake off her superstitious\ndread of being with him in any of the scenes of the Parisian episode.\nShe replied that she was too tired for the play, and they drove back\nto her apartment. At the foot of the stairs she half-turned to wish him\ngood night, but he appeared not to notice her gesture and followed her\nup to her door.\n\n\"This is ever so much better than the theatre,\" he said as they entered\nthe drawing-room.\n\nShe had crossed the room and was bending over the hearth to light the\nfire. She knew he was approaching her, and that in a moment he would\nhave drawn the cloak from her shoulders and laid his lips on her neck,\njust below the gathered-up hair. These privileges were his and, however\ndeferently and tenderly he claimed them, the joyous ease of his manner\nmarked a difference and proclaimed a right.\n\n\"After the theatre they came home like this,\" she thought; and at the\nsame instant she felt his hands on her shoulders and shrank back.\n\n\"Don't--oh, don't!\" she cried, drawing her cloak about her. She saw from\nhis astonished stare that her face must be quivering with pain.\n\n\"Anna! What on earth is the matter?\"\n\n\"Owen knows!\" she broke out, with a confused desire to justify herself.\n\nDarrow's countenance changed. \"Did he tell you so? What did he say?\"\n\n\"Nothing! I knew it from the things he didn't say.\"\n\n\"You had a talk with him this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes: for a few minutes. I could see he didn't want me to stay.\"\n\nShe had dropped into a chair, and sat there huddled, still holding her\ncloak about her shoulders.\n\nDarrow did not dispute her assumption, and she noticed that he expressed\nno surprise. He sat down at a little distance from her, turning about in\nhis fingers the cigar-case he had drawn out as they came in. At length\nhe said: \"Had he seen Miss Viner?\"\n\nShe shrank from the sound of the name. \"No...I don't think so...I'm sure\nhe hadn't...\"\n\nThey remained silent, looking away from one another. Finally Darrow\nstood up and took a few steps across the room. He came back and paused\nbefore her, his eyes on her face.\n\n\"I think you ought to tell me what you mean to do.\" She raised her head\nand gave him back his look. \"Nothing I do can help Owen!\"\n\n\"No; but things can't go on like this.\" He paused, as if to measure his\nwords. \"I fill you with aversion,\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe started up, half-sobbing. \"No--oh, no!\"\n\n\"Poor child--you can't see your face!\"\n\nShe lifted her hands as if to hide it, and turning away from him bowed\nher head upon the mantel-shelf. She felt that he was standing a little\nway behind her, but he made no attempt to touch her or come nearer.\n\n\"I know you've felt as I've felt,\" he said in a low voice--\"that we\nbelong to each other and that nothing can alter that. But other thoughts\ncome, and you can't banish them. Whenever you see me you remember...you\nassociate me with things you abhor...You've been generous--immeasurably.\nYou've given me all the chances a woman could; but if it's only made you\nsuffer, what's the use?\"\n\nShe turned to him with a tear-stained face. \"It hasn't only done that.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I know...There've been moments...\" He took her hand and raised\nit to his lips. \"They'll be with me as long as I live. But I can't see\nyou paying such a price for them. I'm not worth what I'm costing you.\"\n\nShe continued to gaze at him through tear-dilated eyes; and suddenly\nshe flung out the question: \"Wasn't it the Athenee you took her to that\nevening?\"\n\n\"Anna--Anna!\"\n\n\"Yes; I want to know now: to know everything. Perhaps that will make\nme forget. I ought to have made you tell me before. Wherever we go, I\nimagine you've been there with her...I see you together. I want to know\nhow it began, where you went, why you left her...I can't go on in this\ndarkness any longer!\"\n\nShe did not know what had prompted her passionate outburst, but already\nshe felt lighter, freer, as if at last the evil spell were broken. \"I\nwant to know everything,\" she repeated. \"It's the only way to make me\nforget.\"\n\nAfter she had ceased speaking Darrow remained where he was, his arms\nfolded, his eyes lowered, immovable. She waited, her gaze on his face.\n\n\"Aren't you going to tell me?\"\n\n\"No.\" The blood rushed to her temples. \"You won't? Why not?\"\n\n\"If I did, do you suppose you'd forget THAT?\"\n\n\"Oh--\" she moaned, and turned away from him.\n\n\"You see it's impossible,\" he went on. \"I've done a thing I loathe,\nand to atone for it you ask me to do another. What sort of satisfaction\nwould that give you? It would put something irremediable between us.\"\n\nShe leaned her elbow against the mantel-shelf and hid her face in her\nhands. She had the sense that she was vainly throwing away her last hope\nof happiness, yet she could do nothing, think of nothing, to save it.\nThe conjecture flashed through her: \"Should I be at peace if I gave him\nup?\" and she remembered the desolation of the days after she had sent\nhim away, and understood that that hope was vain. The tears welled\nthrough her lids and ran slowly down between her fingers.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she heard him say, and his footsteps turned to the door.\n\nShe tried to raise her head, but the weight of her despair bowed it\ndown. She said to herself: \"This is the end...he won't try to appeal to\nme again...\" and she remained in a sort of tranced rigidity, perceiving\nwithout feeling the fateful lapse of the seconds. Then the cords that\nbound her seemed to snap, and she lifted her head and saw him going.\n\n\"Why, he's mine--he's mine! He's no one else's!\" His face was turned to\nher and the look in his eyes swept away all her terrors. She no longer\nunderstood what had prompted her senseless outcry; and the mortal\nsweetness of loving him became again the one real fact in the world.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nAnna, the next day, woke to a humiliated memory of the previous evening.\n\nDarrow had been right in saying that their sacrifice would benefit no\none; yet she seemed dimly to discern that there were obligations not\nto be tested by that standard. She owed it, at any rate, as much to his\npride as to hers to abstain from the repetition of such scenes; and\nshe had learned that it was beyond her power to do so while they\nwere together. Yet when he had given her the chance to free herself,\neverything had vanished from her mind but the blind fear of losing him;\nand she saw that he and she were as profoundly and inextricably bound\ntogether as two trees with interwoven roots. For a long time she brooded\non her plight, vaguely conscious that the only escape from it must come\nfrom some external chance. And slowly the occasion shaped itself in her\nmind. It was Sophy Viner only who could save her--Sophy Viner only who\ncould give her back her lost serenity. She would seek the girl out and\ntell her that she had given Darrow up; and that step once taken there\nwould be no retracing it, and she would perforce have to go forward\nalone.\n\nAny pretext for action was a kind of anodyne, and she despatched her\nmaid to the Farlows' with a note asking if Miss Viner would receive her.\nThere was a long delay before the maid returned, and when at last she\nappeared it was with a slip of paper on which an address was written,\nand a verbal message to the effect that Miss Viner had left some days\npreviously, and was staying with her sister in a hotel near the Place de\nl'Etoile. The maid added that Mrs. Farlow, on the plea that Miss Viner's\nplans were uncertain, had at first made some difficulty about giving\nthis information; and Anna guessed that the girl had left her friends'\nroof, and instructed them to withhold her address, with the object\nof avoiding Owen. \"She's kept faith with herself and I haven't,\" Anna\nmused; and the thought was a fresh incentive to action.\n\nDarrow had announced his intention of coming soon after luncheon, and\nthe morning was already so far advanced that Anna, still mistrustful of\nher strength, decided to drive immediately to the address Mrs. Farlow\nhad given. On the way there she tried to recall what she had heard of\nSophy Viner's sister, but beyond the girl's enthusiastic report of\nthe absent Laura's loveliness she could remember only certain vague\nallusions of Mrs. Farlow's to her artistic endowments and matrimonial\nvicissitudes. Darrow had mentioned her but once, and in the briefest\nterms, as having apparently very little concern for Sophy's welfare, and\nbeing, at any rate, too geographically remote to give her any practical\nsupport; and Anna wondered what chance had brought her to her sister's\nside at this conjunction. Mrs. Farlow had spoken of her as a celebrity\n(in what line Anna failed to recall); but Mrs. Farlow's celebrities were\nlegion, and the name on the slip of paper--Mrs. McTarvie-Birch--did not\nseem to have any definite association with fame.\n\nWhile Anna waited in the dingy vestibule of the Hotel Chicago she had so\ndistinct a vision of what she meant to say to Sophy Viner that the girl\nseemed already to be before her; and her heart dropped from all the\nheight of its courage when the porter, after a long delay, returned\nwith the announcement that Miss Viner was no longer in the hotel. Anna,\ndoubtful if she understood, asked if he merely meant that the young lady\nwas out at the moment; but he replied that she had gone away the\nday before. Beyond this he had no information to impart, and after a\nmoment's hesitation Anna sent him back to enquire if Mrs. McTarvie-Birch\nwould receive her. She reflected that Sophy had probably pledged her\nsister to the same secrecy as Mrs. Farlow, and that a personal appeal to\nMrs. Birch might lead to less negative results.\n\nThere was another long interval of suspense before the porter reappeared\nwith an affirmative answer; and a third while an exiguous and hesitating\nlift bore her up past a succession of shabby landings.\n\nWhen the last was reached, and her guide had directed her down a winding\npassage that smelt of sea-going luggage, she found herself before a door\nthrough which a strong odour of tobacco reached her simultaneously with\nthe sounds of a suppressed altercation. Her knock was followed by a\nsilence, and after a minute or two the door was opened by a handsome\nyoung man whose ruffled hair and general air of creased disorder led her\nto conclude that he had just risen from a long-limbed sprawl on a sofa\nstrewn with tumbled cushions. This sofa, and a grand piano bearing a\nbasket of faded roses, a biscuit-tin and a devastated breakfast tray,\nalmost filled the narrow sitting-room, in the remaining corner of which\nanother man, short, swarthy and humble, sat examining the lining of his\nhat.\n\nAnna paused in doubt; but on her naming Mrs. Birch the young man\npolitely invited her to enter, at the same time casting an impatient\nglance at the mute spectator in the background.\n\nThe latter, raising his eyes, which were round and bulging, fixed them,\nnot on the young man but on Anna, whom, for a moment, he scrutinized as\nsearchingly as the interior of his hat. Under his gaze she had the sense\nof being minutely catalogued and valued; and the impression, when he\nfinally rose and moved toward the door, of having been accepted as\na better guarantee than he had had any reason to hope for. On the\nthreshold his glance crossed that of the young man in an exchange of\nintelligence as full as it was rapid; and this brief scene left Anna so\noddly enlightened that she felt no surprise when her companion,\npushing an arm-chair forward, sociably asked her if she wouldn't have\na cigarette. Her polite refusal provoked the remark that he would,\nif she'd no objection; and while he groped for matches in his loose\npockets, and behind the photographs and letters crowding the narrow\nmantel-shelf, she ventured another enquiry for Mrs. Birch.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" he smiled; \"I think the masseur's with her.\" He\nspoke in a smooth denationalized English, which, like the look in his\nlong-lashed eyes and the promptness of his charming smile, suggested a\nlong training in all the arts of expediency. Having finally discovered a\nmatch-box on the floor beside the sofa, he lit his cigarette and dropped\nback among the cushions; and on Anna's remarking that she was sorry\nto disturb Mrs. Birch he replied that that was all right, and that she\nalways kept everybody waiting.\n\nAfter this, through the haze of his perpetually renewed cigarettes, they\ncontinued to chat for some time of indifferent topics; but when at last\nAnna again suggested the possibility of her seeing Mrs. Birch he rose\nfrom his corner with a slight shrug, and murmuring: \"She's perfectly\nhopeless,\" lounged off through an inner door.\n\nAnna was still wondering when and in what conjunction of circumstances\nthe much-married Laura had acquired a partner so conspicuous for his\npersonal charms, when the young man returned to announce: \"She says it's\nall right, if you don't mind seeing her in bed.\"\n\nHe drew aside to let Anna pass, and she found herself in a dim untidy\nscented room, with a pink curtain pinned across its single window, and\na lady with a great deal of fair hair and uncovered neck smiling at her\nfrom a pink bed on which an immense powder-puff trailed.\n\n\"You don't mind, do you? He costs such a frightful lot that I\ncan't afford to send him off,\" Mrs. Birch explained, extending a\nthickly-ringed hand to Anna, and leaving her in doubt as to whether the\nperson alluded to were her masseur or her husband. Before a reply was\npossible there was a convulsive stir beneath the pink expanse, and\nsomething that resembled another powder-puff hurled itself at Anna with\na volley of sounds like the popping of Lilliputian champagne corks. Mrs.\nBirch, flinging herself forward, gasped out: \"If you'd just give him\na caramel...there, in that box on the dressing-table...it's the only\nearthly thing to stop him...\" and when Anna had proffered this sop to\nher assailant, and he had withdrawn with it beneath the bedspread, his\nmistress sank back with a laugh.\n\n\"Isn't he a beauty? The Prince gave him to me down at Nice the other\nday--but he's perfectly awful,\" she confessed, beaming intimately on her\nvisitor. In the roseate penumbra of the bed-curtains she presented to\nAnna's startled gaze an odd chromo-like resemblance to Sophy Viner, or\na suggestion, rather, of what Sophy Viner might, with the years and in\nspite of the powder-puff, become. Larger, blonder, heavier-featured,\nshe yet had glances and movements that disturbingly suggested what was\nfreshest and most engaging in the girl; and as she stretched her bare\nplump arm across the bed she seemed to be pulling back the veil from\ndingy distances of family history.\n\n\"Do sit down, if there's a place to sit on,\" she cordially advised;\nadding, as Anna took the edge of a chair hung with miscellaneous\nraiment: \"My singing takes so much time that I don't get a chance to\nwalk the fat off--that's the worst of being an artist.\"\n\nAnna murmured an assent. \"I hope it hasn't inconvenienced you to see me;\nI told Mr. Birch--\"\n\n\"Mr. WHO?\" the recumbent beauty asked; and then: \"Oh, JIMMY!\" she\nfaintly laughed, as if more for her own enlightenment than Anna's.\n\nThe latter continued eagerly: \"I understand from Mrs. Farlow that your\nsister was with you, and I ventured to come up because I wanted to ask\nyou when I should have a chance of finding her.\"\n\nMrs. McTarvie-Birch threw back her head with a long stare. \"Do you\nmean to say the idiot at the door didn't tell you? Sophy went away last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Last night?\" Anna echoed. A sudden terror had possessed her. Could it\nbe that the girl had tricked them all and gone with Owen? The idea was\nincredible, yet it took such hold of her that she could hardly steady\nher lips to say: \"The porter did tell me, but I thought perhaps he was\nmistaken. Mrs. Farlow seemed to think that I should find her here.\"\n\n\"It was all so sudden that I don't suppose she had time to let the\nFarlows know. She didn't get Mrs. Murrett's wire till yesterday, and she\njust pitched her things into a trunk and rushed----\"\n\n\"Mrs. Murrett?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. Sophy's gone to India with Mrs. Murrett; they're to meet at\nBrindisi,\" Sophy's sister said with a calm smile.\n\nAnna sat motionless, gazing at the disordered room, the pink bed, the\ntrivial face among the pillows.\n\nMrs. McTarvie-Birch pursued: \"They had a fearful kick-up last spring--I\ndaresay you knew about it--but I told Sophy she'd better lump it, as\nlong as the old woman was willing to...As an artist, of course, it's\nperfectly impossible for me to have her with me...\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Anna mechanically assented.\n\nThrough the confused pain of her thoughts she was hardly aware that\nMrs. Birch's explanations were still continuing. \"Naturally I didn't\naltogether approve of her going back to that beast of a woman. I said\nall I could...I told her she was a fool to chuck up such a place as\nyours. But Sophy's restless--always was--and she's taken it into her\nhead she'd rather travel...\"\n\nAnna rose from her seat, groping for some formula of leave-taking. The\npushing back of her chair roused the white dog's smouldering animosity,\nand he drowned his mistress's further confidences in another outburst\nof hysterics. Through the tumult Anna signed an inaudible farewell, and\nMrs. Birch, having momentarily succeeded in suppressing her pet under a\npillow, called out: \"Do come again! I'd love to sing to you.\"\n\nAnna murmured a word of thanks and turned to the door. As she opened it\nshe heard her hostess crying after her: \"Jimmy! Do you hear me? Jimmy\nBRANCE!\" and then, there being no response from the person summoned: \"DO\ntell him he must go and call the lift for you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Reef, by Edith Wharton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE REEF ***\n\n***** This file should be named 283.txt or 283.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/283\/\n\nProduced by Gail Jahn, and John Hamm\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1272,"split":"test"}
