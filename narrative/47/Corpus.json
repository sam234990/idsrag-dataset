{"ori_id":"0bb7c49bd644d0a4c0ea9fd6239e84c07013a811","title":"Lightnin' (play)","context":"Lightnin' (play)\n The story takes place in the mythical town of Calivada where Lightnin' Bill Jones, or more correctly his wife, operates a rather seedy hotel that straddles the California-Nevada state line convenient for those looking for a quick Nevada divorce. He is nicknamed Lightnin\u2019 because, as the local postmaster put it, \u201cWe call him Lightnin\u2019 because he ain\u2019t.\u201d\nLightnin\u2019 Bill, a Civil War veteran known to brag that he advised General Ulysses S. Grant, also claims to be a jack of all trades, having been at one time or another, a judge, inventor, detective and bee keeper. Of the latter profession he spins the tale that he once drove a swarm across the prairie in the midst of winter without the loss of a single bee. When pressed Lightnin\u2019 Bill concedes that during the drive he may have been stung once or twice.\nLightnin\u2019 Bill likes to spend his days and nights carousing with cronies rather than being at home with his wife and adopted daughter. When he refuses to go along with the sale of the hotel to group of out-of-town businessmen, his wife becomes furious and files for divorce. In court Lightnin\u2019 Bill, with the help of young John Marvin, is able to prove that the buyers are unscrupulous scoundrels and wins back the love of his wife.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lightnin', by Frank Bacon\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

BILL HESITATED\n\nLIGHTNIN', IN HIS FADED G. A. R. UNIFORM ... LISTENED ATTENTIVELY\n\n...HE TOOK IT FROM HIS POCKET, SAYING, \"MILLIE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU\nSOMETHING\"\n\n\n\n\nLIGHTNIN'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\"Him?\" the local postmaster of Calivada would say, in reply to your\nquestion about the quaint little old man who had just ambled away from\nthe desk with a bundle of letters stuffed in his pocket. \"Why, that's\nLightnin' Bill Jones! We call him Lightnin' because he ain't. Nature\ndidn't give no speed to Bill. No, sir, far as I know, Lightnin' 'ain't\nnever done a day's work in his life--but there ain't none of us ever\nthinks any the less of him for that! Bill's got a way with him, an' he\nkin tell some mighty good yarns. Lightnin's all right!\"\n\nAnd when you met Bill Jones you agreed with the postmaster. You looked\ninto Lightnin's twinkling, shrewdly humorous eyes and you smiled--smiled\nwith him. You thought of the reply he made to a stranger who protested\nagainst his indolence.\n\n\"Well,\" Bill said, with that shrewd glance of his, \"I ain't keepin'\n_you_ from makin' a million dollars, am I?\"\n\nOld Bill was full of remarks like that, and sometimes those about him\nwere not so sure as to his lack of speed, in spite of his aimless,\neasy-going habits. You never can tell from the feet alone. Those closest\nto him were not sure at all; he \"had them guessing.\" There was no doubt\nthat his wife, simple, earnest, hard-working woman that she was, loved\nhim. She mothered him and did not seem to worry much about his shiftless\nways. He was her husband, and that was enough for her. What Mrs. Jones\nthought of her husband's mental acumen would be another question,\nperhaps, but up to the present she had always consulted Bill's wishes\nand sought his advice. Their adopted daughter, Millie, a pretty,\nwholesome, brown-haired girl of nineteen, worshiped Bill. Any one who\nsaid a word against \"daddy\" had Millie to deal with. The third person\nBill had guessing was John Marvin, a young man who owned a tract of land\nand a cabin a few miles down the trail. Marvin had a lot on his mind,\nand was studying law all alone in the cabin at nights into the bargain,\nbut he liked to have Bill drop in, liked to hear him talk. Bill could\ntell some pretty tall yarns, but he told them so well you had to swallow\nthem. There was an odd, friendly, understanding bond between the\nambitious young fellow and the easy-going, humorous old man. They\nconfided in each other a great deal, and--well, like Mrs. Jones and\nMillie, Marvin frequently found himself crediting Bill with a semblance\nof mental speed. But then his mind would picture the ambling, aimless\nfigure of Bill Jones with its shock of disordered gray hair and\nhalf-shut eyes, and Marvin would smile to himself and turn his thoughts\nto something else. But he wondered, nevertheless.\n\nAt the present moment, the afternoon of a late summer's day, Bill Jones\nwas doing a little wondering himself, though no one would have suspected\nit as he ambled lazily up the trail, bound for home. Things were not\ngoing well with the Jones family. Mrs. Jones and Millie were worrying,\nand Bill knew it. Characteristically, he had evaded the issue for\nseveral years, content to let each day take care of itself as best it\ncould, but now matters were reaching a crisis and circumstances were\nforcing Bill to consider it. They had been selling the timber on the\nland, but that did not help much; and now they were taking summer\nboarders--when they could get them, for boarders were scarce. Again,\nthis only made more hard work for Millie and Mrs. Jones.\n\nIt was of this Bill was thinking as he went along. He had been sent to\nget the mail and to meet the morning train from San Francisco for the\npurpose of enticing a few boarders to the Jones establishment if\npossible. He should have been home hours ago with the mail, and there\nwere some odd jobs awaiting him, but he had dallied in the little local\ntown. This was his usual habit, for, like a good many lonely souls, Bill\nwas also a social one. People liked to buy Bill drinks and cigars in the\ntavern and listen to his yarns. But to-day Bill was lingering\nintentionally; he knew that his wife and Millie expected to take him\ninto consultation this afternoon in regard to the critical state of the\nfamily affairs. Naturally Bill dreaded such a proceeding, but there was\nsomething more than that to it to-day. His old heart, usually full of\nhappy-go-lucky sunshine, was harboring shadows, for he knew that he\nought to help and wanted to. But how? As he had turned slowly homeward,\nLightnin' hadn't the faintest idea.\n\nThen suddenly, when about a mile from the house, Bill paused in the\nmiddle of the trail, chuckled, and then sat down on a fallen tree. He\npushed back his battered old hat, drew a bag of tobacco and a Manila\npaper from his pocket, and rolled himself a cigarette. All signs and\nmanifestations indicated that Bill Jones was overwhelmed by an idea. He\nsat puffing the cigarette and grinning to himself for a few minutes;\nthen he arose slowly and ambled on; but now the amble was not so\naimless. It had a suggestion of the walk of a man with a purpose, and\nthere was a gleam of satisfaction and humorous self-importance in his\nhalf-shut eyes.\n\nNearing the house, he observed his wife sitting on the broad veranda,\nrocking to and fro, obviously on the watch for him. From force of habit,\nBill tried to make a detour with the intent of entering unseen through\nthe back door; but, knowing his ways, Mrs. Jones was too quick for him.\nShe called to him, and, with the air of one who had no intention\nwhatever of entering by the back door, he came up on the porch and\ndropped into a chair beside her.\n\n\"Well, mother,\" he said, amiably, \"you look all tuckered out. Glad to\nsee you restin'.\"\n\n\"Where you been all day?\" she asked, ignoring his remark. Her tone was\nnone too tender, but there was a gentle gleam in her motherly, tired\neyes as they sought her husband's, sheepishly hiding behind half-closed\nlids.\n\n\"Just takin' a look at town,\" Bill drawled. \"Just takin' a look.\" He\nsettled himself comfortably in his chair and rolled a cigarette.\n\n\"Don't you know there's some new boarders come?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Bill, easily. \"I sent 'em, didn't I? Told 'em you was the\nbest cook in two states, mother. Guess I ought to know.\"\n\nMillie, an apron over her neat and simple house dress, came out and drew\na chair between her foster-parents. She glanced quickly from one to the\nother, and then her gentle brown eyes came to rest lovingly on old Bill.\nHe returned her smile.\n\n\"What a long time you were, daddy!\" she said. \"I bet you stayed away\njust because you knew mother and I wanted to talk to you to-day--own up,\ndaddy!\"\n\nBill grinned delightedly, despite his knowledge of the rather grave\nsituation the girl's smiling comment covered. \"Well, Millie,\" he\nanswered, \"I'm here now, ain't I? Guess we can have a little talk before\nthem boarders begin to yell for their supper. I kinder wish as you\ndidn't have to cook for 'em, mother--an' Millie waitin' on 'em. 'Tain't\nfair.\"\n\nMrs. Jones's lips twitched; the weight of a hard day was on her.\n\n\"It ain't no use puttin' it off, Bill,\" she said, wearily. \"We got to do\nsomethin'. Mr. Townsend was here this afternoon.\"\n\n\"What o' that?\" asked Bill.\n\n\"Well, he's pretty shrewd, you know, an' he's thinkin' about us, Bill.\nHe seen how much of the timber's gone. He knows we sold another strip o'\nland last month for next to nothin'--\"\n\n\"What's that to him?\" Bill queried, rolling another cigarette and\napparently completely absorbed in the operation.\n\n\"He--he's just worried about us, an' it's nice of him, Bill, him knowin'\nus all these years. He--he thinks as we might move into--into one o'\nthem little cabins down the trail an'--\"\n\n\"Lem Townsend's all right,\" Bill cut in, lazily, \"but we ain't goin' to\nmove, mother. An' it ain't nobody's business, neither--not even Lem\nTownsend's. I hope you told him that.\"\n\n\"Why, Bill!\" Mrs. Jones exclaimed, sharply. \"I told him no such thing!\nAn' I ain't so sure but what I ain't goin' to take his advice!\"\n\nBill looked at her, a hidden smile in his eyes. \"It's your property,\nmother,\" he said, quietly.\n\nTears sprang into the woman's eyes and she made an impulsive gesture.\n\n\"You mustn't think that way, Bill!\" she cried. \"I know you deeded the\nwhole place over to me when we were married--and it was all you had! I\nwasn't thinkin' o' that--'ceptin' as I always think. You must say _our_\nplace, Bill. It's yours an' mine an' Millie's. We'll stick together.\nBut we got to do _somethin'_.\"\n\nBill glanced slyly at the girl, whose brown head was bowed thoughtfully.\n\"What you think, Millie?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" she replied, slowly. \"I could go back to San\nFrancisco and work as I did last year. But maybe we could pull through\nthis winter--if only we could get boarders. I don't mind the work,\nand--and I'd rather stay home here.\"\n\nBill's eyes suddenly twinkled. \"What's the matter?\" he chuckled. \"John\nMarvin come back from the city to stay at his cabin?\"\n\nMillie blushed. \"Daddy!\" she pouted.\n\nMrs. Jones did not seem any too pleased at her husband's remark. \"John\nMarvin 'ain't got nothin' to do with it!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't see\nwhat he comes foolin' around here for, anyway--Millie 'ain't got _him_\non her mind!\"\n\n\"I should say not!\" Millie echoed, though it occurred to Bill that the\nsoftness of her brown eyes belied the petulant toss of her head.\n\"Perhaps, after all, it would be best for me to go back to Mr. Thomas's\noffice!\"\n\nBill turned his half-shut eyes on her quickly, but Millie did not note\nthe expression of genuine concern in them. He sat lost in thought. The\nlast winter had been the most difficult of all for them. Millie, feeling\nthat it was time for her being some help, had studied typewriting and\nstenography and had obtained a position in the office of Raymond Thomas,\na San Francisco lawyer. Presumably on a vacation, Thomas had chanced to\nspend a week at the Jones place the previous summer. Millie had told him\nof her design to help the family, and Thomas had suggested that she take\nthe position open in his office.\n\nBut that had been a dreary and lonely winter for Bill and his wife.\nMillie's pretty face and youthful ways had been missed sorely; the girl\nhad come to be all in all to the old couple, and they could not bear to\nsee her go away again for another long winter.\n\nThen, too, Bill had his own reasons for feeling grave and down in the\nmouth when Millie suggested her returning to work in the office of\nRaymond Thomas. Bill Jones was not one to analyze, or to voice or\nexplain his thoughts--even to himself--unless he took a notion to, or\nconsidered that the right moment had arrived; it was all too much\ntrouble, anyway. Certain thoughts were running through his mind now,\nhowever; running a little at random, to be sure, but they were there.\nHis young friend, John Marvin, had worked in Thomas's office for a\ntime--was working there when Millie entered the office. Indeed, that was\nhow Marvin had met Millie and found, to his delight, that they were\nneighbors up in Nevada--that she was the pretty daughter his friend Bill\nJones was always mentioning.\n\nBut Bill was thinking now especially of the fact that Marvin had left\nRaymond Thomas's office suddenly, and had told Bill precisely why he had\nleft.\n\n\"Don't _you_ think it would be best for me to go back, daddy?\" Millie\nquestioned, interrupting his random musings. \"Maybe mother could manage\nhere, with one or two boarders and the money I shall send her. And there\nwill be your army pension. Mr. Thomas is coming to pay us a visit\nto-morrow, you know, and I'll ask him at once for my old position. I\nknow it will be all right, for he's always been perfectly splendid! He\ntold me the position would always be open to me. You have no idea how\nkind and considerate he is, daddy! Then maybe next summer--\"\n\n\"Next summer we're all goin' to be rich!\" said her odd foster-father,\nunexpectedly. \"Yes, sir, meanin' you an' mother, Millie girl, next\nsummer we're goin' to be awful rich. Leastways, you an' mother is. Bein'\nrich wouldn't mean nothin' to me--I'm above it!\"\n\n\"Why, daddy!\" Millie exclaimed, staring at him. \"How--What do you mean,\ndaddy?\"\n\nSlumped away down in his chair, Bill's eyes were now all but closed\ntight and he was grinning.\n\n\"Nothin' particular,\" he answered, softly. \"'Cept that maybe Bill Jones\nain't called Lightnin' for nothin'.\"\n\n\"Bill,\" said his wife, \"this ain't no time for to be smart! If you have\nanything to say, I wish to goodness you'd say it!\"\n\nBill half opened his eyes and glanced at her. \"Millie ain't goin' back\nto that tailor-made lawyer's office,\" he said.\n\n\"Daddy, please!\" said Millie, flushing.\n\n\"You mustn't make fun of Mr. Thomas when--\"\n\n\"All right, Millie,\" he stopped her, resting his thin hand on her brown\nhair for an instant. \"I wouldn't say nothin' as would hurt you. But you\nwon't have to go back, my dear--not unless you really want to leave us.\nI got an idea, mother--that's why I was late gettin' home. Ideas take\ntime, 'specially when they're good ones! I got a good one what'll fix\nthis whole business!\"\n\nBill stuck his thumbs in his faded old shirt comically. Even slumped\ndown in his chair as he was, the suggestion of a harmless swagger was in\nhis manner--the easy swagger of one who, hitherto unconsidered, has\nastonished the skeptics by giving birth to an idea and solving a\nproblem. There was something about Bill that suppressed the gentle but\nnone the less amused smile that was dimpling Millie's cheeks.\n\n\"Out with it, daddy!\" she demanded, restraining a desire to pull his\near.\n\n\"If Lem Townsend is so anxious to help us,\" he stated, \"he can arrange\nall the details for you, mother. I 'ain't got time for details--that's\nwhat I told Grant once, when we was havin' supper before Petersburg. Got\nenough to do with the idea. Lem can put the ads. in them Reno papers,\nan' hire the maids for you, an' things like that.\" Then Bill suddenly\nstopped, hugely enjoying the mystification of his two listeners.\n\nHis wife sat up. \"Bill Jones,\" she said, \"you been drinking again down\nto town, that's what I think!\"\n\n\"Go on, daddy!\" Millie encouraged, putting her hand on his arm. \"I feel\nthat you've thought of something! Tell us!\"\n\nIgnoring his wife's accusation, Bill gave Millie a grateful glance and\nresumed, in his slow drawl:\n\n\"I got an idea--sure enough, mother an' Millie! It didn't hit me until I\nwas half-way home to-day, but I got it lookin' at the mornin' train what\ngoes on through to Reno. I've looked at a pile o' trains in my time, but\nI never got no idea from 'em before. Look here, don't the state line run\nplumb through the middle o' this house, so's half of it is in California\nan' the other half in Nevada? Well, what's the matter with makin' this\nhouse a hotel temporary for busted hearts what takes six months to cure?\nLots o' them rich folks from the East who goes on down to Reno to git\ndivorced would like to live on the lake, but they can't because they got\nto live in Nevada for six months. They can live on one side o' this\nhouse an' be in Nevada. An' at the same time they gits all the good o'\nlivin' in California! They'd be tickled to death an' they'd be comin' in\nshoals all year, winter an' summer. An' what they pays ain't nothin' to\nthem--the Reno hotels is so rich off them they don't want to take in no\none what 'ain't a busted heart! You better start right away gettin'\nready, mother!\"\n\nMrs. Jones and Millie gasped. Bill, however, having spoken at\nconsiderable length for him, merely reached for his eternal bag of\ntobacco and paper and idly rolled himself a cigarette.\n\nMillie clapped her hands. \"Why, mother!\" she cried, \"daddy's right--it\nis an idea! And so simple!\"\n\n\"All big things is simple,\" Bill remarked, with the air of one who ought\nto know.\n\nMrs. Jones stared from her husband to Millie. \"Oh, Bill,\" she said,\nfinally, \"I really think we can do it! And now I'll tell you somethin'.\nI--I was goin' to suggest this very thing some time ago, but--but I\nthought you wouldn't approve of it on account o' Millie. Lem Townsend\nput the notion in my head when he was talkin' about our sellin' the\ntimber.\"\n\nBill looked up. \"Lem thought of it, eh? Didn't think Lem had that much\nsense. Anyways, I bet I thought of it first--I must 'a' been thinkin' of\nit for a long time without knowin' it. Why shouldn't I approve--on\naccount o' Millie, mother?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" said his wife, uncertainly. \"I hear some of them\ndivorcers is--is--\"\n\n\"Shucks, mother,\" Bill stopped her. \"They're human beings, ain't they?\nAn' them as ain't we needn't take. But they're all right. I seen a lot\no' them on the trains. Right smart lookers, most o' them! They can't\nhelp it if their hearts gets busted, can they? Human beings is human\nbeings. Besides, we gotter look at it from a business point o' view--as\nLincoln said to me about the Civil War. I was a business man once an'--\"\n\nMillie laughed, and Bill, remembering that he was in the bosom of his\nfamily and that there were certain things he couldn't \"get away with\"\nthere, subsided.\n\nEvidently Mrs. Jones had been thinking hard during the past few minutes,\nand now she spoke. \"We'll do it, Millie!\" she said. \"Some o' them Reno\nhotels got started overnight, just like this, an' we can do the same.\nIt'll be kinder queer at first, turning our home into a hotel, but maybe\nwe can soon make enough to--to make it a home again. Shall we try it,\nMillie?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Millie exclaimed. \"I think it will be great fun! You're\nawful clever, daddy, to think of it!\"\n\nBill, who had rolled and lighted another cigarette, arose and stuck his\nhands carelessly in the pockets of his worn, baggy old trousers.\n\"'Tain't nothin',\" he remarked, swaying on his heels and toes. \"Nothin'\nat all! I think o' lots o' things like that, but I don't tell 'em--too\nbusy! Well, mother, as Lem Townsend's comin' over to-night, you better\nhave him fix them details. I got to go an' think some more about the\nidea!\"\n\nHe moved away with elaborate unconcern and started to amble down the\nveranda steps. His wife suddenly remembered several odd jobs he should\nbe attending to, but she did not stop him. Her mind was full of\nplans--and one is naturally timid about asking a Man with a Big Idea to\nperform menial tasks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAfter supper the following evening Bill slipped from the house and\nambled through the woods to the lake border, where a young moon, cradled\nabove the western ridge, sent its shafts of silver light across the\ndarkened waters. It was evident that Bill Jones wanted to be alone. He\nsettled down on the trunk of a fallen tree and absently rolled himself a\ncigarette. When it was satisfactorily lighted he glanced down the shore.\nIt was deserted, but a little way back, on the woodland path, he\nobserved two people strolling in the dim shadows of the pines and\ncedars. He knew that the girl in the white dress was Millie, and he\nguessed that the man with her was John Marvin. Bill was not especially\nromantic, but there was no doubt that the sight of those two together\npleased him. He knew that the pair had not seen much of each other of\nlate, and he wondered why. He himself had not seen John Marvin for\nnearly two weeks. Though he did not indulge in romance personally, he\nunderstood much, and he sighed deeply as he watched the dim figure of\nthe girl strolling along the path. His mind wandered off through a vista\nof past years to the time when Millie had first come to the Tahoe region\nand to the Jones family, a bit of a girl of three. Sinking into a\nreverie, Bill failed to note that the pair had finally parted, Marvin\nstriding off up the trail in the direction of his cabin. A pull at his\near brought him back to earth.\n\n\"Why, daddy! What are you doing out here all alone?\"\n\nMillie sat down beside him, putting an arm around his neck.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Bill, reaching for his bag of tobacco and papers. \"Where's\nJohn?\" he asked, a humorous gleam in his eyes, as he met hers.\n\nMillie seemed to hesitate before answering: \"He's gone back to his\nplace. I told him Mr. Thomas was here and he wouldn't even come in to\nsee him! He says he does not like it. I don't think it is any of his\nbusiness,\" she added, giving Bill a hug.\n\n\"Why ain't it?\" Bill asked.\n\nAgain Millie hesitated, then said, \"Mr. Thomas is just as nice as he can\nbe daddy, and--\"\n\n\"His yaller gloves is nice. So's his cane. Must take him an awful long\ntime to dress.\"\n\nMillie took her arm away and looked at him. She caught the lift of his\neyebrows and the peculiar expression of his half-open mouth and\nhalf-shut eyes, an expression which always decorated Bill's face when he\ngave vent to sentiments which Millie had come to regard as \"Daddy's\nintuitions.\" Bill always used trivial words at such moments, but that\ndid not minimize the effect.\n\n\"But, daddy, it seems so hard to make you understand how good Mr. Thomas\nhas been to me! Mother understands. He took such pains with me. I was a\nperfect greenhorn and didn't know the first thing about office work. No\nmatter what mistakes I made, he was just as patient as he could be. And\nhe says he loves this beautiful country up here! He liked to hear me\ntell about our wonderful waterfall.\"\n\nBill puffed his cigarette, an odd gleam in his eyes, perhaps of\namusement, perhaps of wisdom. Millie glanced back toward the house; then\nher eyes swept the shore and finally came to rest on something barely\nvisible far up on the mountain--John Marvin's cabin. She sighed and\ncontinued to gaze in the same direction. Bill stole a look at her.\n\n\"Liked to hear about our waterfall, eh?\" he remarked. \"I thought so.\"\n\nMillie started. \"Thought what, daddy?\" she asked, her brown eyes trying\nto read his face.\n\n\"Nothin'. Nothin',\" he replied, with a note of finality that she had\nlong learned to know as indicating the futility of further questioning.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, rising, \"I think you'd better come up to the house,\ndaddy. I suppose you left Mr. Thomas all alone there on the veranda,\ndidn't you? You might have stayed and entertained him until I got back.\"\n\n\"Guess he entertains himself pretty well,\" said Bill. \"Besides, mother's\nwith him.\"\n\n\"But you ought to be there, too, daddy; you're the head of the house,\nyou know!\"\n\nHe gave her an amused glance as she cuddled his arm in hers and walked\nhim off. \"All right, Millie, but I kinder keep fergettin' that part of\nit.\"\n\nComing up the veranda steps, they found Mrs. Jones sitting there with a\nhandsome, perfectly groomed young man of possibly twenty-seven. Raymond\nThomas looked actually too good to be true in that backwoods region. He\narose quickly, placed a chair for Millie, and then drew one beside his\nown, urging Bill to occupy it.\n\n\"Please sit right here, Mr. Jones!\" he insisted, with an easy,\nflattering smile. \"Where did you disappear to after supper? I've been\nlooking all over for you. I want to hear some more of those famous\nstories of yours! Tell me how to get him started, Miss Buckley,\" he\nadded, with mock appeal and turning his dazzling smile on Millie.\n\n\"Oh, daddy just starts himself!\" she answered, laughing.\n\nBill dropped into the chair and crossed his legs. Gingerly he took the\ncigar Thomas offered him.\n\n\"I want to hear about some of your experiences in the Civil War,\" Thomas\nurged. \"Why, I have heard that you were in most of the big battles!\"\n\nBill glanced at his smiling questioner with an odd look. With great\ndeliberation he bit off the end of the cigar. \"I was in all them battles\nbut two,\" he said, finally, holding up the cigar and subjecting it to a\nminute inspection.\n\n\"Yes?\" Thomas encouraged. \"Allow me to light the cigar, Mr. Jones!\"\n\nBill gave him a quizzical glance at this unusual attention, a glance\nthat apparently was quite lost on Thomas.\n\n\"Sure. All but two,\" said Bill, taking a long pull at the cigar. \"I was\nin Washington on private business when them two was goin' on. I was\ngreatly disappointed.\"\n\n\"I can imagine so!\" exclaimed Thomas.\n\n\"You can imagine a lot o' things, can't you?\" said Bill, unexpectedly.\n\"I often imagine I never saw some people. It makes you feel better. But\nabout them battles. Ye know Grant 'd never won the battle of Lookout\nMountain if it hadn't been for me--\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried Thomas, in a tone of pleasant surprise.\n\n\"Nope. I was the only man he would let look out.\"\n\nThomas laughed effusively and gently tapped Bill on the back. \"Capital!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"You must tell me some more later on. And you've got to\ncome to town with me some time, Mr. Jones. But\"--and for a moment he\nturned his brilliant smile on Millie and Mrs. Jones--\"I've been\nthinking ever since supper of that great idea of yours about turning\nthis place into a hotel for the broken-hearted. Really, I've given much\nserious thought to it, as I was telling your wife just before you and\nMiss Buckley joined us. I am so interested in you all that I hate to act\nlike a damper, but I have very grave doubts about it being a paying\nproposition. And then I fear none of you have taken into consideration\nthe vast amount of work, preparation, and alteration the scheme will\nentail. Now, as you are doing this to--er--well, to improve the\nfinancial yield of the establishment--you have flattered me by deeming\nme worthy of your confidence, Mrs. Jones, so perhaps I need not hesitate\nover words--it seems to me that we might find some other and easier way\nof accomplishing the desired object--\"\n\n\"Hello, Lem! Come an' set down,\" called Bill, calmly interrupting the\nabove flow of words and addressing a tall, rather impressive and\ndistinguished-looking man of about forty who had come up the veranda\nsteps.\n\n\"How's it goin' Lem?\" Bill asked. He turned his eyes on Thomas. \"Lem's\nrunnin' fer superior judge o' Washoe County at the fall election.\"\n\nMrs. Jones and Millie greeted Townsend cordially and the girl placed a\nchair for him while he turned to shake hands with Thomas, who had\nrecovered his slightly shattered poise and risen gracefully. Townsend\nshook hands genially, but there was a lurking frown in Raymond Thomas's\neyes--more than a suggestion that he was annoyed at the interruption,\nand, for reasons of his own, resented the presence of another person on\nthe veranda. His dazzling smile was at work, however.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to meet the future legal light of Washoe County!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"That's right--better make yourself solid with him now,\" said Bill,\nthrowing away the remains of the cigar and bringing out his tobacco and\npapers. There was something in his voice that somehow did not bring a\nlaugh.\n\n\"Why, daddy!\" cried Millie. \"I don't think that's funny at all!\"\n\nBill merely glanced at her and went on rolling his cigarette. Thomas had\ngiven Bill a keen, puzzled look; but no one could ever tell from\nLightnin's expression whether or not any special meaning lay back of\nhis words.\n\nMrs. Jones created a diversion. Eagerly she imparted Bill's great idea\nto Townsend and their intention of carrying it out at once. Millie\njoined in and asked him if he would help. He declared himself at their\nimmediate disposal.\n\n\"I'm very glad you are going to do it, mother!\" he said. \"In my\njudgment, it is an excellent solution of your problem. You will recall\nthat I suggested this--\"\n\n\"But I beat you to it, Lem!\" Bill cut in quickly. \"Forethought and\nexecution is the whole carnage!\"\n\nRaymond Thomas had been listening closely. If there was disapproval and\nannoyance at the turn things were taking, it did not show in his face.\n\n\"But are you sure this venture will pay these good friends of ours, Mr.\nTownsend?\" he asked, in a tone of grave doubt. \"Those divorce\npeople--they are mostly women, you know--are generally on short rations,\nthough they have been used to having a lot of money to spend. I'm afraid\nthey'll demand comforts and luxuries that will run expenses into big\nfigures, and they won't want to pay enough to make a reasonable margin\nof profit.\"\n\n\"I am certain it will pay splendidly!\" replied Townsend. \"Look at the\nReno hotels! Oh yes, I strongly advise our friends to tackle it!\"\n\nThomas frowned slightly. \"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Townsend. I presume\nyou have investigated the matter. But there is another point to\nconsider. I don't think--well, personally, I do not think it is\naltogether a good plan to--to bring women of that sort into contact with\nwomen like Mrs. Jones and Miss Mildred.\"\n\nHe turned to Millie, his expression one of delicate concern and appeal.\n\n\"It's fine of you to speak like that, Mr. Thomas,\" she said, flushing\nslightly, \"but mother and I have talked over all that. We do not mind.\nAnd, besides, I don't think it right for us to feel that way about it.\nI'm sure most of those women are nice--and maybe they need just the\nsympathy and care we can give them.\"\n\nLemuel Townsend, on hearing Thomas's statement, had sat bolt upright.\n\"Sir,\" he said, in tones of personal injury, adjusting his glasses and\neying Thomas from head to foot, \"I think that a rather broad and\nsweeping statement for you to make. Miss Mildred is perfectly correct\nin her surmise. I must remind you that I am a Nevada attorney. I have\nknown, in my life, many of these young women, and I have found them most\nestimable!\"\n\n\"Ye like 'em, don't you, Lem?\" remarked Bill, chuckling.\n\nTownsend flushed; he looked appealingly at Mrs. Jones and Millie, his\njudicial manner gone. It must be confessed that Millie suppressed\nsomething resembling a giggle.\n\n\"You old fogies up here in the mountains have the wrong idea!\" Townsend\nsaid, turning to Bill. \"Why should two people be hitched together when\nthey are pulling in different directions? That doesn't get them any\nplace.\" He rose and reached for his hat on the veranda rail. \"Well, I\nmust be off. I'll get to work at once, Mrs. Jones. The Reno papers shall\nhave your ad. to-morrow, and I'll get busy on some other things at\nonce.\"\n\nThe two women rose, profuse in their thanks, which he smilingly waved\naside. With a nod to Bill, and a rather formal bow to Thomas, he went\ndown the steps.\n\nThomas resumed his seat and his dazzling smile; there was nothing in his\nmanner to show that he had been thinking quickly. He crossed his legs\neasily and drew out another cigar.\n\n\"Have you ever thought of selling the place, Mrs. Jones?\" he asked,\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Why--why, no! Can't say as we have!\" she answered, evidently surprised.\n\"An' I don't know as we could if we wanted to. Ain't much call for a\nplace like this, Mr. Thomas!\"\n\n\"But you can't always tell about these things, my dear lady,\" said\nThomas, addressing himself exclusively to Mrs. Jones. \"It might not be\nso hard to find a purchaser, and at a good price, too.\"\n\n\"I--I don't think Bill would like to sell,\" she replied, doubtfully.\n\"Would you, Bill?\"\n\nHer husband made no reply. He sat gazing straight ahead, his eyes half\nshut as usual.\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. Jones is indifferent on the subject,\" Thomas resumed. \"Now\nI am sure that if he felt that you and Miss Mildred were well\nprovided--\"\n\n\"Say, you're kinder full of ideas yourself, ain't you?\" Bill\ninterrupted, unexpectedly turning and bringing his thin, unshaven face\nclose to the other man's, quite unwonted force and anger in his manner.\n\n\"Daddy!\" Millie cried, while his wife stared at him.\n\nThe anger left his face and the old, shrewd, humorous light crept back\ninto his eyes.\n\n\"I don't believe in more 'n one idea at a time,\" he said, grinning.\n\"No--I guess mother an' me an' Millie 'll try out that little\nbusted-heart notion o' mine first, afore we tackles any other notions.\nGuess I'll turn in, mother--had a kinder tall day. Look sorter all in\nyourself. Better come along. Tirin' business, havin' ideas. If Mr.\nThomas 'ain't been entertained ernough, maybe Millie 'll stay down an'\nkeep the show goin'.\" And he got up slowly, stuck his hands in his\npockets, and ambled into the house.\n\n\"I think we'd better go in, too, mother,\" said Millie, rising. \"I know\nyou're just fagged out, and it's late, anyway. You won't mind if we\nleave you to finish your cigar, Mr. Thomas, will you?\"\n\n\"Not at all! Not at all!\" Thomas exclaimed, with his smile. \"A thousand\npardons for keeping you up so late--it was thoughtless of me!\"\n\nHe sprang to the screen door, held it open for them, and called a cheery\n\"Good-night!\" as they disappeared up the stairs. Then he sat down again\nand thoughtfully finished his cigar. He appeared to have a lot to think\nabout, to figure out. When finally he went up to his own room a light\nburned there for an hour longer.\n\nIn the morning Bill Jones was up and about unwontedly early. He got\nhimself some breakfast, then went to the little desk where the few\nboarders habitually left the letters they had written the night before\nfor the outgoing mail, which he took to the post-office. He found some\nhalf-dozen letters on the desk this morning, and he examined the\naddresses deliberately. One in particular seemed to interest him\nimmensely. It was in a handwriting he had seen before and recognized as\nthat of Raymond Thomas. He put a finger to his cheek and gazed up at the\nceiling--which is the same as saying that Bill Jones was making a\ncareful mental note of the name and address on that letter. It was\naddressed to one Everett Hammone, the Golden Gate Land Company, San\nFrancisco. It was quite obvious that Bill Jones had a strong desire to\nknow the contents of that letter; but he dropped it carelessly among the\nrest, bundled them up with a string and stuffed them in his pocket as he\nstrolled out of the house on his daily journey.\n\nOut on the trail a bit, his ambling feet came to a pause. He took out\nhis tobacco and papers and rolled a cigarette. Lighting it, he turned\naround and gazed up the mountain, his eyes blinking in the morning\nsunlight as they rested on the dot that was John Marvin's cabin. For a\nmoment it seemed as if Bill had it in mind to change his direction and\ngo up the mountain.\n\n\"I sure would like to have er talk with John,\" he mused. \"Sure would.\n'Ain't had a talk with him for some time. But I guess as John is pretty\nput to it with that there timber proposition--things must be gittin'\nsome excited up there! Maybe I'll go up to-morrer.\"\n\nAnd having characteristically decided to do it to-morrow, Bill continued\nhis morning stroll toward the post-office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nFor reasons obvious and otherwise, Bill Jones did not carry out his\nintention of visiting John Marvin's cabin \"to-morrow.\" In spite of\nhimself, Bill naturally was drawn into the vortex of work and\npreparation necessary to turning his home into the Calivada Hotel. The\nperiod of change was a nightmare to Bill, the only leaven in his misery\nbeing the astonishing fact that he actually evolved quite a number of\nideas--ideas which Mrs. Jones, Millie, and Lem Townsend not only O.K.'d,\nbut put into instant execution--and found exceedingly workable. He made\nmany attempts to disappear from the premises, but his wife, or Millie,\nor Lem always had an eye on him and managed to frustrate his hasty\nsorties or more subtle schemes to take French leave. This went on day\nafter day, and now Bill had endured nearly six weeks of more or less\npleasantly enforced captivity.\n\nIn the mean time the mysterious \"excitement\" up the mountain about\nwhich Bill had mused that morning on the trail had come to a head, and\nJohn Marvin's little cabin seemed to be the center of it.\n\nIt was shortly after sundown one evening that a big, red-headed\nlumberjack, obviously a Swede, put his head in the door of the cabin and\nglanced quickly around the one room. Seeing that there was no one\ninside, he entered, closing the door behind him. Going to the window, he\nlooked out through the thick grove of pines and cedars, but evidently\ncould see no one. He was breathing hard, as if from running, and he sank\ninto a chair.\n\nHis rest was short-lived. There was a rap at the door, which was\ninstantly pushed open, and a lanky, sinewy man in sombrero and\nriding-breeches, with two revolvers at the belt, strode in. The Swede,\non his feet in an instant, recognized the intruder as Nevin Blodgett,\nsheriff of Washoe County.\n\n\"What you want?\" the lumberjack asked, in his heavy voice.\n\nThe sheriff did not answer at once, but took a quick survey of the\ncabin's contents, his eyes lighting up as they rested upon the unwashed\ndishes on the table, telling of a recent meal. There was a\nself-satisfied swagger about the sheriff as he walked up to the Swede.\n\n\"You're John Marvin, ain't you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied the Swede, with a heavy frown.\n\nThe sheriff looked puzzled for a moment; then it seemed to dawn on him\nthat it was just possible that a big, red-headed Swede was not likely to\nbe John Marvin.\n\n\"Well!\" he snapped. \"Then I guess you're working for him, ain't you?\"\n\nThe lumberjack shook his head and went close to Blodgett, emphasizing\nhis words, \"Who I work for bane my business!\" There was no fear in his\nmanner as he stood looking into his interrogator's face with a grin that\nboded ill for any one looking for trouble.\n\nBlodgett backed away, his eyes following the breadth of the Swede's\nhusky shoulders and the line of his powerful arms.\n\n\"None of that!\" he said. \"You're with the gang that's been chopping down\nthat timber out there. You know well enough that Marvin's stealing that\ntimber, don't you?\"\n\n\"Stealing?\"\n\n\"Yes! He's stealing it from the Pacific Railroad Company, and I'm here\nto arrest him for it!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" The Swede shrugged his shoulders and wheeled around, gazing\nanxiously out of the window, where the path through the forest was\nvisible.\n\n\"You know where he is, don't you?\" Blodgett asked.\n\n\"He gone away.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Blodgett stamped his spurred boot.\n\n\"I doan' know.\"\n\n\"When did he go?\"\n\n\"Maybe--yesterday.\"\n\n\"When's he coming back?\"\n\n\"I doan' think he coomin' back.\" The Swede deliberately put a kettle on\nthe stove and whistled indifferently.\n\nBlodgett was evidently torn between a desire to maintain his dignity and\nauthority as sheriff and a rather healthy reluctance to have any trouble\nwith the great, hulking Swede.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for you if you're lying--\"\n\nHe got no farther. The Swede stepped up to him with blazing eyes.\n\n\"You call me liar?\" he yelled. \"I throw you out the door!\"\n\nBlodgett backed quickly away--very quickly. His hand sought the latch\nbehind him. \"If you threaten me, the next thing you know you'll find\nyourself in jail!\" he cried, shaking his fist.\n\nThe Swede's only answer was an ugly grin. Blodgett opened the door,\nslamming it after him as he went away.\n\nThe big lumberjack stood quiet for several minutes, listening to the\nsounds of retreat beaten by the hoofs of Blodgett's horse. Assured that\nthe sheriff was safely out of the way, he crept to the window, thrust\nhis head over the sill, and gave a low whistle.\n\nThere was a stir in the soap-plant outside and Marvin emerged, hurried\naround to the door, and entered the cabin.\n\n\"Good work!\" he exclaimed, laughing and clapping the grinning Swede on\nthe back. \"You got rid of him very well, Oscar! Now I'll go on with my\nsupper!\"\n\nHe took off his coat and went over to the stove, where he began to shake\nthe damper to let out the ashes. Oscar came and stood beside him.\n\n\"He tell me--\"\n\n\"I know what he told you,\" Marvin interrupted, continuing to shake the\nashes.\n\n\"Do that land belong to the railroad?\" There was a slight note of alarm\nin the Swede's voice.\n\n\"It does now, Oscar,\" Marvin replied, throwing some paper and wood into\nthe stove and lighting it; \"but I sold the timber a long time before the\nrailroad got the property, and I'm trying to save the timber for the man\nwho bought it from me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The Swede turned toward the door, as if to go. \"Bane they arrest\nyou for that?\"\n\n\"Not unless they find me!\" Marvin chuckled.\n\n\"An' me an' the boys--can they arrest oos?\"\n\n\"No, Oscar,\" Marvin laughingly reassured him. \"You fellows are working\nfor me and you are not supposed to know anything about my affairs.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The Swede gave a satisfied nod of his head. \"I see--you know that\nfrom--from your books.\" He jerked his thumb toward a table in the corner\non which some law-books stood.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marvin, looking into the coffee-pot. \"Anyhow, you'll be gone\nin the morning. The job's done, thanks to you and the boys.\"\n\nThe lumberjack stood for a moment, nodding his red head; then he turned\nslowly and went out.\n\nMarvin put the coffee-pot on the stove, watched it a minute, and then\nsank thoughtfully into the shabby but comfortable arm-chair at the end\nof his reading-table--which also served as a dining-table. He sat there\nfor several minutes--until the coffee, boiling over on the stove,\nbrought him out of his reverie and to his feet. At the same moment he\ncaught the sound of remote but high words coming from that part of his\nland where the recently cut timber was stacked.\n\n\"I tell you he bane gone away!\" he heard, in Oscar's heavy, threatening\nvoice.\n\nHurriedly pushing the coffee-pot on to the back of the stove, he sprang\nto the door, but before he could reach it it was thrust in against him\nand he was thrown back into the middle of the room, where he stood,\nperforce, facing a tall, athletic-looking man in motor togs. The man's\nstrong, intellectual face, undoubtedly pleasant and agreeable\nordinarily, was now clouded with anger, his jaw set and grim.\n\nAt sight of him, however, Marvin's fists unclenched and he smiled\namiably, despite the other's attitude.\n\n\"Why, hello, Mr. Harper!\" he exclaimed, holding out his hand. \"You're\njust the man I've been looking for! But you seem a bit upset. What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\nIgnoring the outstretched hand, Harper threw off his duster and tossed\nit, with his gloves, on the table.\n\n\"Just a minute, young man,\" he said, with a grim tightening of his jaw\nand his keen eyes boring into Marvin's. \"Just a minute. I came here to\nhave a look for myself and to see precisely where I stand.\" He turned\nand carefully closed the door.\n\nMarvin went to the stove and calmly poured himself a cup of coffee.\n\"Well,\" he remarked, with a laugh, \"won't you have a chair and some\ncoffee first--you can shoot just as easily sitting down.\"\n\nHarper, his hand at his belt, glared at him.\n\n\"You don't think I mean business, do you?\" he said, grimly. \"Or perhaps\nyou think you have beaten me to it, eh? Now what sort of man are you and\nwhat nice little game is this you are playing? Here I buy a grove of\ntimber from you, and while my back is turned you sell the property,\ntimber and all, to the railroad! I want an explanation and I want it\nnow!\"\n\n\"You have the facts a bit mixed up,\" Marvin replied, still smiling and\nnodding toward the chair, at the same time placing the coffee on the\ntable. \"Sit down and we'll talk it over--and I think you'll decide not\nto shoot!\"\n\nHarper, however, was adamant.\n\n\"All right,\" said Marvin. \"In the first place, when I sold you the\ntimber you said you were going to cut it at once--\"\n\n\"Correct--correct! But something came up and I could not attend to\nit--and I don't see how that exculpates you in the least!\"\n\n\"It doesn't,\" replied Marvin, adding, as he took up his coffee, \"if you\nwon't join me, I'll have to go it alone, as this is the first I've had\nsince morning. Well, when I sold you that timber I never thought I would\nsell any of this property. My mother loved every inch of it. It was our\ndream that when I received my diploma and established a practice we\nwould make a home here; but she was taken sick--\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember your telling me about her being in the hospital.\"\nHarper's voice softened a bit.\n\nMarvin was silent a moment. \"I took her to San Francisco. She died\nthere.\"\n\nHarper fumbled with the buckle of his belt. His heart went out to the\nyounger man; yet he felt that right was on his side. He picked up a\npicture of Mrs. Marvin that stood in a small frame on the table. \"I'm\ndeeply sorry,\" he said, softly. \"I did not know.\"\n\n\"There is no need to apologize,\" Marvin answered, quietly. \"You have a\nperfect right to demand an explanation about that timber.\" With a last\nswallow of coffee, he put down his cup and stood squarely facing Harper,\nand his own expression was grim as he continued:\n\n\"When we got to San Francisco--mother and I--a lawyer in whose office I\nhad been a student came to the hospital and got into her good graces. He\nhad taken a great interest in me and I would have taken an oath as to\nhis integrity. But when I came up here to sell you the timber--and\nmother and I needed the money desperately at the time--this man took\nadvantage of my absence to persuade mother to deed him fifty acres,\nnearly the whole of the property! It was to be a pleasant surprise for\nme when I returned! Instead of cash, he gave her a batch of stock in the\nGolden Gate Land Company, stock of which I have been unable to dispose.\nAnd the next day he resold the property to the Pacific Railroad Company\nfor three or four times the price represented by the stock he gave\nmother. I found that out later, of course. Well, after mother's death I\nhurried up here, only to discover that you had not cut the timber I sold\nyou _before_ the property was sold. I got busy at once and have been\nstaying on here until the gang out there finished cutting it and piling\nit on what is left to me of the property. Your timber is ready for you,\nMr. Harper, any time you are ready to haul it away.\"\n\nIt was Harper's turn to put out his hand. \"I'm mighty sorry I\nmisunderstood you, Marvin!\" he exclaimed, as the latter returned the\nclasp. \"But look here! Can't you do anything about this fellow, this\nlawyer? What's the rascal's name?\"\n\n\"Raymond Thomas. He's up in these parts quite frequently of late. Made\nhimself solid with some dear friends of mine, I'm sorry to say, and I'm\nworried about it. I can't help believing that he's up to some new game,\nthough I can't just see what it is. He's a remarkably smooth customer.\nIt's very hard to pin anything on him. I'm going to make him disgorge my\nproperty if I can, but I shall have a difficult legal fight on my\nhands.\"\n\nHarper nodded understandingly. \"I see, I see--covered himself cleverly.\nI don't know the gentleman, but I'll be only too glad to do anything to\nhelp you, Marvin.\" He took a turn about the room, while Marvin leaned\nagainst the table. \"I'll have the timber hauled away at once. I didn't\nhave it cut, myself, because--well, I've had a lot of trouble myself.\nHad a strike at the mill, and--oh, hang it all! It's my wife, Marvin!\nShe's packed up in a hurry and left me!\"\n\nHe flung himself into the chair and stared ruefully, comically, at the\nyounger man, who, not knowing what to say, said nothing.\n\n\"I didn't mind the strike so much, nor this timber mix-up!\" Harper\nrushed on, with the air of a man who must tell some one or explode. \"It\nwas my wife, young man! It's her being so unreasonable that makes me\nsore. I bought her a present when I was East and had it shipped to the\noffice. It happened to arrive about the time Mrs. Harper was to come to\nthe office in the machine to take me home, and she walked in just as I\nwas showing it to my stenographer. Of course my wife thought I bought it\nfor Miss Robbins, and--well, what's the use of talking about it?\"\n\nWith a gesture of dismissal for the subject, he stood up and took out a\nwallet.\n\n\"How much do I owe you?\" he asked. \"I figured it would cost about eight\nhundred dollars to do that job out there--\"\n\nMarvin put up a deprecatory hand. \"I can't take it now, Mr. Harper,\" he\ninterrupted. \"You haven't got that timber yet, and--\"\n\n\"The railroad will have some job on its hands to get it away from me!\"\nsaid Harper. \"And unless they do I owe you eight hundred dollars--do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nA faint noise outside broke into their conversation. With a warning\ngesture, Marvin tiptoed to the door and put his ear against it. Harper,\nthinking that it might be a railroad employee who had come to eavesdrop\nin order to report their plans, stood with his jaw set, his hand on the\nrevolver at his belt. With a quick movement Marvin jerked open the door.\n\nInstead of a railroad employee, or the sheriff, it was only Lightnin'\nBill Jones who stood there, leaning idly against the doorframe, his\nhands in his pockets. He ambled silently into the middle of the room,\nhis half-shut eyes blinking in the sudden light.\n\n\"I guess I must 'a' been out there some time, come to think of it,\" he\nremarked, meditatively, and addressing himself to the ceiling, quite as\nif he were alone. Then he turned carelessly to Marvin.\n\n\"I knocked, too--but I guess maybe you wasn't expectin' me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWith a laugh, Marvin shut the door. \"It's all right,\" he said, winking\nat Harper. Smiling, he went up to Bill and swung him around to face him.\n\n\"Hello, Lightnin'!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm mighty glad to see you. What do\nyou mean by staying away from me all this time? And you were so quiet\nand mysterious outside there that we thought some one was spying on us!\"\n\n\"I was a spy once--with Buffalo Bill,\" said Lightnin', conversationally.\nHe stared interestedly at Harper. \"Friend of yours, John?\"\n\n\"This is Lightnin' Bill Jones, Mr. Harper. This is the gentleman I sold\nthat timber to, Bill.\" The two men acknowledged the introduction.\n\n\"Have you had any supper, Bill?\" Marvin asked, resuming operations at\nthe stove. \"If not, you'd better stop and have it with me.\"\n\nBill shook his head with an air of importance. \"No; can't stop. Got to\nbe home at the hotel at supper-time to see that everythin's goin' right.\nWhat time is it now?\"\n\n\"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nBill shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, meditated, and announced:\n\"Well, maybe they can get along without me. I got everythin'\nsys-sys-matized.\"\n\nMarvin glanced at him quickly. \"Bill, I'm afraid you've been having a\ndrink or two?\"\n\n\"Nope. Nope!\" Bill repeated, with the debonair innocence of a\nmischievous and prevaricating school-boy. \"I was just sayin' good-by to\nthe boys out there.\" He signified with a jerk of his head that the\nlumberjacks were responsible if he seemed in any way elated. \"You see,\nthey're breakin' up camp--an' I didn't want to hurt their feelin's, as\nthey're all friends o' mine.\"\n\nHarper, who had resumed his seat in the chair, glanced at Marvin.\n\n\"Does our friend Bill know--what we were talking about?\"\n\n\"Everything!\" said Marvin, readily. \"Rest easy, Mr. Harper--you'll never\nfind a better friend, nor a more trustworthy one, than Lightnin'. But,\nsurely, you have heard of his hotel, haven't you?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\n\"Then I guess you're the only man what 'ain't!\" said Bill, emphatically,\nand gazing at the ceiling and thoroughly enjoying the fact that he was\nthe subject of the conversation.\n\nRapidly Marvin sketched the conception and success of the Calivada\nHotel. \"It was a real idea--\"\n\n\"It was my idea,\" put in Bill, conversationally.\n\n\"It certainly was, Bill!\" Marvin went on. \"And the new hotel is a big\nsuccess! You see, the state line runs right through the middle of the\nhouse--through the center of the lobby, in fact! There are two separate\ndesks, one on the California side and one on the Nevada side. Women\nbegan to arrive, and they all wanted rooms on the Nevada side--and they\nwanted them for six months!\"\n\nHarper roared with laughter. \"The Reno divorce brigade!\" he exclaimed.\n\nBill fairly beamed at the attention his affairs were drawing. He sat\ndown on the corner of the table and grinned at Harper, while Marvin went\non:\n\n\"Exactly! Everybody knows what a woman goes to Reno for, but at Bill's\nhotel she can get a room on the Nevada side and still make her friends\nbelieve that she is at a California resort!\"\n\nAgain Harper laughed. \"A corking good business idea!\" he said. \"And so\nit was your idea, Mr. Jones? I congratulate you! I suppose you have been\nout West here a long time?\"\n\n\"Sure--came out in the gold excitement,\" replied Bill, calmly.\n\nHarper stole an amused glance at Marvin. \"Why, the gold excitement was\naway back in forty-nine!\"\n\n\"Well, they was still excited when I got here!\" Bill gazed up at the\nceiling, his half-shut eyes hiding their twinkle.\n\n\"It's too bad you didn't happen to be one of the lucky ones,\" Harper\nconsoled him, arising from his chair.\n\n\"Lucky?\" Bill scratched his head under his ragged slouch-hat. \"Say, I\nlocated more claims than any man what ever came out here! I been a civil\nengineer.\"\n\nThe table was not a sufficient throne for Bill, so he slipped down from\nit and went close to Harper, peering up at him.\n\n\"You ought to be a rich man, Mr. Jones!\"\n\n\"Always cheated out of my share.\" Bill shook his head sadly. \"Crooked\npartners was the reason.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you do anything to them?\"\n\n\"I shot some, put all the others in the penitentiary--all but one.\"\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"He died before I got him.\"\n\n\"Died of fright, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\nHarper took his hat from the table, clapped Bill on the back, and said,\nlaughingly, \"I think I'll get out before you tell me any more!\"\n\nMarvin urged him to have a bite of supper, but Harper declined,\nexplaining, as he went to the door, that he had to be in Truckee in two\nhours, and that it would take him fully that time to make it in his car.\nBill, anxious to retain his audience, added his entreaty to Marvin's.\nThat failing, he followed Harper to the door, searching for an excuse to\nhinder his leaving.\n\nHarper paused at the door. \"Well, Marvin,\" he said, \"I'm going to send\nthe trucks down here to-morrow and start hauling. And you might as well\ndisappear from here for a while; then, if there's any kick, no one here\nwill know anything about it. I'll keep you posted. Are you sure you\ndon't want that eight hundred now?\" He took out his wallet and again\ntried to make Marvin take the money, but again Marvin refused.\n\nBill had been listening to every word. Now he seemed to have hit on a\nway to detain Harper and at the same time prove his own personal\nimportance. As Harper shook hands with Marvin, Bill took an envelop from\nhis pocket. Drawing a paper from it, he offered it to Harper.\n\n\"If you want to get rid of some of that money,\" he remarked, easily,\n\"maybe you'd cash that check for me.\"\n\nHarper, examining it, saw that it was a government check. \"Oh, a pension\ncheck! So you were in the war?\"\n\n\"First man to enlist!\"\n\nSmiling, Harper handed him the check to \"indorse\"--which happened to be\na new word on Bill.\n\n\"Write your name on the back of it,\" said Harper.\n\n\"I always do that,\" said Bill, as he complied. Then he held the check up\nto the light, pointing to the signatures on its face. \"See all them\nnames,\" he asked, \"Secretary of the Treasury, and all of 'em?\"\n\nHarper nodded wonderingly.\n\n\"Well, they ain't no good at all--not unless I sign it!\" said Bill,\ntriumphantly.\n\nHarper laughed; handed Bill the money for the check, and, with a final\n\"Good-night!\" hurried out of the door. Bill poked his head out, watching\nhim crank his machine and drive away in the moonlight.\n\nWhen the car was out of sight Bill turned back into the middle of the\nroom and stood watching Marvin, who had sat down and was eating his\ndelayed supper.\n\n\"Better join me, Bill,\" Marvin again invited, and at the same time\nnoting a change in the old man's manner, now that they were alone.\n\n\"No,\" Bill said; \"I had mine with the boys outside, as I told you--but\nI'll have a drink with you, John,\" he added, hesitatingly, knowing\nMarvin's disapproval of his drinking.\n\n\"I haven't anything in the house, Bill,\" said Marvin, as he went on\neating. \"You know that.\"\n\nBill edged slowly toward the table, his hand in the back pocket of his\nbaggy, slouchy trousers. \"Yes, you have,\" he remarked, producing a\nhalf-filled flask.\n\n\"You mean you have,\" Marvin replied, trying not to smile. \"And you've\nhad enough for to-night. Put it away, Bill, and promise me not to drink\nany more to-night.\"\n\n\"All right, John,\" said Bill, unconcernedly, and putting the flask back\nin his pocket. \"I promise--an' I 'ain't never broke a promise yet! I'll\nkeep this for--for emergencies. Say, Oscar told me the railroad had the\nsheriff after you. You remember the last promise what I give you?\"\n\n\"What was that, Lightnin'?\"\n\n\"That if they goes to court, I'll come an' be a witness. I can swear\nthem trees was cut when you sold the property, an' I'll--\"\n\n\"No, Bill!\" said Marvin, putting down his knife and fork and staring at\nthe old man, whose half-shut eyes had the suggestion of a flash in them.\n\"No; I couldn't let you swear to anything like that.\"\n\n\"You can't help yourself--I got a right to swear to anythin' I want!\"\nThere was an unexpected finality in Bill's usually drawling voice.\n\n\"But I haven't got to prove when those trees were cut,\" said Marvin.\n\n\"I know it,\" Bill responded; then, catching the smiling doubt in the\nother's eyes, he added, \"I was a lawyer once.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you practise?\" asked Marvin, inwardly chuckling.\n\n\"Don't need no practice.\" And Bill resorted to his bag of tobacco and\npapers, rolling himself a cigarette. By this time Marvin had finished\nhis meal.\n\n\"Look here, Lightnin',\" he said, as he cleared the table, \"you seem to\nhave something on your mind. How are things going up at your place?\nAnybody at home know that you are here?\"\n\n\"Not unless they're mind-readers.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Well?\"\n\n\"It's a wonder you 'ain't come up to take a look yourself,\" Bill\ncountered. \"You 'ain't even been up to--to see Millie,\" he added,\nthoughtfully.\n\nMarvin flushed. \"That's true, Bill,\" he said, slowly. \"But I've been\nmighty busy with this timber here, as you know; and, besides--well,\nMillie seems to be a bit interested elsewhere.\"\n\n\"That's just the trouble, I guess,\" said Bill, settling himself on the\ncorner of the table.\n\nMarvin looked at him quickly. \"What do you mean, Bill?\" he demanded.\n\nLightnin' crossed his legs, took a final puff of his cigarette, and let\nit drop from his fingers.\n\n\"Oh, there ain't nothin' much to that, John!\" he replied. \"Nothin' to\nworry about. But it's what lays back o' that.\"\n\n\"For the Lord's sake stop talking in riddles, Lightnin'!\" Marvin\nexclaimed. \"What lies back of what?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill, looking up shrewdly, \"this here Thomas has shown his\nhand--an' we gotter admit, John, that he plays a mighty smooth an' slick\ngame! He wants to buy our place, waterfall an' all.\"\n\n\"So that's it!\" Marvin knew that Thomas had been buying up property in\nthe section, and he knew from experience what sort of treatment the\nsellers were likely to get. That old Bill and his family should now be\ninvolved filled him with concern and anger.\n\n\"But surely you're not going to sell, Bill!\"\n\nLightnin' looked up, then down. \"The property belongs to mother, John;\nan' this here Thomas person sure knows how to go after what he wants!\nHe made himself solid with mother an' Millie some time ago, as you know.\nThey think he's Santa Claus, or somethin'. Why, he's got mother an'\nMillie all het up so's they don't know whether they're standin' on their\nhead or feet! Mother's kinder simple about some things, John--but Millie\noughter have more sense! He's been tellin' them that this here hotel\nidea won't pay for long, an' that he's willin' to buy the place at once\nfor a good price. He tells 'em as how they can enjoy themselves an' live\ncomfortable on the proceeds--an' I can have a nice, easy old age! He\n'ain't said much to me, o' course--I don't give him a chance to find me\naround, much. But he's got the womenfolk all fed up, eatin' out o' his\nyaller gloves, an' crazy to sell. An'--an' mother an' Millie is kinder\nsore at me 'cause I ain't takin' much interest in the proposition. Say,\nwhat was the name o' that feller what acted as agent for the railroad\nan' bought your property from Thomas when he done you out of it?\"\n\n\"Hammond, Everett Hammond,\" said Marvin. \"Go on, Bill--I'm listening!\"\n\n\"Hammond, eh? To--be--sure. Well, Mister Everett Hammond is up at the\nhotel now, John, with Thomas--Hammond come up in a hurry, an' they got a\ndeed to the property all ready fer mother an' me to sign. Mother's crazy\nto sign, but I ain't--not yet. An' it seems they gotter have my name on\nit, to make sure.\"\n\n\"What--you mean to say it has gone that far!\" exclaimed Marvin.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" said Bill, rolling another cigarette. \"An' say, I happen\nto think them two--Hammond an' Thomas--has been in cahoots fer some\ntime--got an idea they is actually partners.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"I was a detective once,\" said Bill, with a sudden return to his usual\nmanner, as he lighted the cigarette.\n\nMarvin made an impatient gesture. \"Hang it! This is really too bad,\nBill! Look here, I'll see if I can do anything! I'm going to come up to\nthe hotel to-morrow as soon as I can get away from here! You're not\ngoing to sign that deed, are you, Lightnin'?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Bill, slowly, a little nervously; \"no--but mother an'\nMillie is kinder hot on my trail fer to make me do it. Them two fellers\nhas sure got 'em goin', John! Well, I guess as they'll all be in bed by\nthe time I gets back now, so I'll be gettin' along. You'll be up\nto-morrow, John?\"\n\n\"I'll come--don't worry, Lightnin',\" said Marvin. \"Better go now, Bill;\nyou've got a long walk ahead of you, you know.\"\n\nHe dropped into his chair and reached thoughtfully for one of his\nlaw-books. Bill opened the door; then turned back for a moment.\n\n\"Studyin' them books?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Trying to,\" Marvin remarked, turning a page.\n\n\"That's right--that's how I got _my_ start!\" said Bill, as he went out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThe following morning, rising at dawn, Mrs. Jones again tried to awaken\nher husband to a full sense of his shortcomings anent his foolish\nreluctance to sign the deed to the property. Bill, however, merely\nturned on the pillow, gave her a brief smile, and dropped quickly into a\ngentle snore. After several more attempts to awaken him and impress on\nhim the fact that his absence the day before had kept Thomas and Hammond\non a day longer when they had important business calling them to the\ncity, she gave up in despair and went below to look after breakfast,\ntaking with her the packet of letters that should have been in the hands\nof the guests the afternoon previous.\n\nThe morning was a busy one for Mrs. Jones and Millie. Bill, coming down\nunexpectedly, escaped them, calling through the door, on his way out,\nthat he was going for the mail. When noon came and Bill did not turn up,\nMrs. Jones's anxiety reached fever pitch, and she sought Millie in the\nhope that she could offer some solution of the problem of forcing the\ndeed through Bill's unwilling hands.\n\nAt breakfast, Thomas and Hammond again had painted to her and Millie\ngolden pictures of the ease and even luxury that would be theirs as a\nresult of the sale of the property. Trembling with anticipation, Mrs.\nJones had then and there put her name to the deed which disposed of her\nlast bit of land; and she was determined that, no matter what it cost\nher in seeming coldness and harshness toward him, Bill should be made to\nplace his name directly under hers. She made up her mind that he should\nbe brought to terms as soon as he got back; hence her extreme annoyance\nas the morning went by without his showing up.\n\nAs she went about the house, looking for Millie, her determination took\non a hard and bitter aspect which was only softened when she caught the\nsound of Raymond Thomas's voice. He was speaking softly to Millie in the\nlobby. Mrs. Jones belonged to a generation not so long past when\neavesdropping was not considered a wholly unworthy occupation if it\ntended to place the culprit in a position to know the inner secrets of\nthose bound by the tie of relationship. For some time, so cleverly did\nhe manage her, Mrs. Jones had felt a motherly tenderness for Thomas\nspringing up within her, and she hoped and dreamed that her affection\nwould have a chance to express itself. That Thomas was in love with\nMillie she had fully decided on. It was for this reason that the very\nsight of John Marvin, whom she knew to be a poor young man with no\nparticular prospects, filled her with displeasure. Then, too, she did\nnot approve of her husband's friendship with Marvin, having a strong\nsuspicion that Marvin was influencing Bill against Thomas, and an\nintuition that Bill, in his unworldliness, would stand back of Marvin's\nlove for Millie.\n\nAnd so it was that the sight of Millie smiling up at Thomas as he looked\nearnestly down into the girl's brown eyes set Mrs. Jones's heart beating\nhopefully--and sent her behind a curtain to listen to what was being\nsaid.\n\nThomas had just come in from the veranda, where he had begged to be\nexcused from accompanying two prospective widows on a walk to see the\nwaterfall at the edge of the place. He was smiling with affected\nindifference when he met Mildred, who had just come down one of the\nstairways, of which there were two, one leading to the Nevada side of\nthe house and the other to the California side. \"It's a shame to miss a\nstroll with them!\" belying his words with a sneering toss of the head\nand shrug of the shoulders.\n\nMillie's brow was drawn thoughtfully into wrinkles and there was a\nwistful pucker to her mouth.\n\nAt once he was all attention. \"What is the matter, Millie?\" he asked, a\nnote bordering on tenderness in his voice.\n\n\"It's daddy again. He did not get back until midnight, and he was off\nagain this morning before mother or I could prevent him. I just heard\nthe boarders complaining about the mail service. It's all so hard on\nmother, and yet\"--she hesitated, her mind reverting to her\nfoster-father's kindness to her through all the years of her babyhood\nand girlhood--\"and yet,\" she went on, \"he's really so good and kind at\nheart, he really would feel dreadfully if he understood what he puts us\nthrough.\" She stood by the newel-post, her eyes pleading for advice.\n\nThomas took her hand and looked at it thoughtfully.\n\nFor a moment Millie let it lie in his; then her lids dropped and she\nblushed, withdrawing her hand and walking slowly toward one of the\ndesks, of which there were also two, one on each side of the hall.\n\nThomas followed her, bending down and looking into her face. \"I would\nnot let his absence bother you. I'm going up-stairs to pack my grips. As\nsoon as I finish I'll go after him,\" he said, soothingly, as, one hand\nin pocket, he let the other flip a pack of cards on the table.\n\n\"Oh, you've been too kind already,\" Millie protested, again meeting his\neyes and turning away, her lips quivering.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not so kind as you think!\" He laughed, an honest humor rising\nto infrequent expression. \"I've got to see Lightnin' myself before I go.\nHe hasn't signed the deed yet, and--\"\n\n\"I really can't see what he's got to do with it!\" Millie interrupted.\n\"The place is mother's. Oh, well\"--she sighed and shook her head in\ndespair--\"I suppose to be safe his signature must be obtained. I do hope\nhe'll turn up before you leave. It's too bad--\"\n\n\"Well, if he doesn't, maybe you and Mrs. Jones can make him see the\nlight. I'll leave the papers with you, and when he signs them you can\nsend for me and I'll be up and--\"\n\n\"You don't know how much I appreciate all you've done for us. Now don't\nsay it's nothing.\" Millie turned and put her hand on his arm, her eyes\nresting intently on his.\n\nHe bent over her for a minute, then straightened up as he heard a slight\nmovement in the porti\u00c3\u00a8re, a gleam of wisdom illuminating his face. He\nsmiled with a nonchalant disregard of his former intention and backed\naway from the girl.\n\nMillie's color mounted her forehead. Shyly she withdrew her hand from\nhis arm and fumbled with the bunch of keys about her neck. After an\nawkward silence she continued:\n\n\"You've been so good to us. When mother and I've been in such distress\nthat we did not know where to turn and mother was nearly frantic, you\ncome forward and in no time arrange everything so that mother and daddy\nare going to be better off than they ever dreamed of. For years, you\nknow, mother and I have worried about her and daddy's old age. Piece by\npiece we've sold the land and the timber. Even if this place does pay it\nwill only be running expenses, with nothing saved up, as you said. And\nthen the Nevada divorce laws might change. Oh! You've been so kind,\" she\nbreathed, in deep sincerity.\n\n\"Now don't make me ashamed,\" Thomas coaxed in his soothing way, backing\nslowly toward the stairs on the California side. \"What I've done is just\nthe simplest thing in the world. I grew to be very fond of you when you\nwere in my office, Millie, and I'm glad to be of what service I can.\"\n\nAs he was half-way up the stairs, Mrs. Jones emerged from behind the\nporti\u00c3\u00a8re. He stopped and bent in a nattering bow, a twinkle in his eye.\n\"Why, good morning, Mrs. Jones!\" he called down.\n\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" Mrs. Jones, a guilty conscience bringing his courtly\nsarcasm, which would otherwise have escaped her gullible nature, into\nnotice, stepped back, turning to the kitchen, whence she had come when\nshe stopped to listen. But Millie followed her, and, with arm around her\nwaist, drew her into the room and seated her near the table.\n\n\"You're not going into that hot kitchen again to-day,\" remonstrated\nMillie, planting a daughterly kiss on her cheek. \"You've been out there\nworking like a slave for three mortal hours.\"\n\nMrs. Jones hid her hands awkwardly under her apron and reddened as she\nglanced up at Thomas, who had come back from above-stairs.\n\n\"I don't look presentable,\" she murmured, fidgeting in the chair.\n\n\"Come now, you mustn't mind me,\" said Thomas, Millie adding her word to\nhis: \"Please stay there just for a few minutes, mother. You look ready\nto drop.\"\n\n\"She's always tellin' me that.\" Mrs. Jones showed her pleasure in\nMillie's concern by beaming knowingly from one to the other, an act\nwhich sent Millie to the desk, where she pretended to look at the\nregister.\n\nThomas smiled. \"Millie's right,\" he responded. \"You do work a great deal\ntoo hard; but it won't be long now before you can say good-by to hard\nwork for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thomas!\" Mrs. Jones arose, forgetting the red, hardened hands\nshe had been endeavoring to hide behind the blue and white checked\napron, and hastened to Thomas, holding them toward him in a gesture half\nof gratitude, half of pleading. \"I can scarcely realize that all this is\ngoing to come true and we owe it all to you. I only wish I could tell\nyou how grateful I am.\"\n\nThomas was quite determined to escape further enthusiasm, either on\nMillie's or on Mrs. Jones's part. His game nearly played, he wished to\nwithdraw gracefully and without detriment to a certain lurking decency\nwhich had not quite been swept away. Thwarting Mrs. Jones's attempt to\nwring his hand in gratitude, he took two light bounds up the stairs,\nstopping to laugh back: \"Well, I'm going to get out for fear you'll\nspoil me with a thankfulness I don't deserve. Hang on to her, Millie.\"\nHe directed a gleam toward the young girl as she went up to her mother.\n\"Make her take a rest.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! Do you think I've driven him away?\" There was genuine concern\nin Mrs. Jones's voice as she sank back into the chair and gazed\nanxiously after Thomas.\n\n\"No, you haven't.\" Millie smoothed the brown hair which was fast\nstreaking with gray from her brow, damp with excitement. \"He is going\nup-stairs to pack. He's arranged everything about selling the place, and\nthere's nothing more for him to stay--\"\n\n\"You're here, ain't you?\" Mrs. Jones folded her arms stiffly across her\nchest and assumed a rigid position in her chair as she questioned Millie\nwith eyes suddenly grown fierce with the look of an angry hen when she\nthinks her brood has been disturbed.\n\n\"Oh, mother!\" The girl pursed her lips into a pouting smile as she\nleaned over the back of the chair, an affectionate arm on Mrs. Jones's\nshoulder. \"Please get that foolish idea out of your head. You know--\"\n\n\"Know nothin'.\" Mrs. Jones's head jerked vehemently while she insisted:\n\"Every letter you wrote home all the time you was workin' in his office\nshowed that he cared for you.\"\n\n\"I never wrote anything of the sort!\" Millie drew a surprised breath as\nher mouth was drawn into a tiny O of expostulation. \"Never!\" she\nreiterated, with a slight stamp of her foot, as she went to the\nCalifornia desk and became absorbed in the register.\n\n\"Oh, I could read between the lines! I ain't that stupid. If he isn't\nin love with you, why is he plannin' for us to come and live in San\nFrancisco? Oh, won't it be grand!\" Mrs. Jones, carried away by the\nrecollection of a long-ago visit to the city, and by a dream of what a\npermanent life there would be, resumed her own hearty enthusiasm. \"I\nwant to live in the city real bad, but I'm just skeered to death I won't\nknow how to dress. I want to get a lot o' pretty things 'n' be like the\nwomen I saw when I was at the Palace. Do ye think Bill 'll think I'm\ngetting crazy?\"\n\nAn indulgent smile from Millie met her uneasy but smiling gaze, and she\nwent on: \"I know I've talked about the city ever since I can remember,\nbut now that it's in sight I'm awful afraid I'll be out o' place.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll not,\" answered Millie, going behind the counter to look at\nthe letter-rack, almost empty. \"I'm going to see that you have just as\nnice things as any of the women stopping here.\"\n\nThere was a silence as both of the women smiled in contented\nanticipation. Mrs. Jones was the first to speak, a sudden doubt\nexpressing itself in an anxious frown and a narrowing of the eyes. \"But\nthere's Bill,\" she said, with a start. \"I'm so afraid of the way he'll\nact!\"\n\n\"Daddy 'll be all right, I'm sure.\"\n\nMrs. Jones composed herself and began planning. \"When his pension comes,\nyou must take him to town and buy him some new clothes. Them others we\ngot before didn't fit a bit good.\"\n\nMillie turned quickly at the mention of her father's pension,\nremembering that it was time for it to arrive. She reminded her mother\nof this fact.\n\nMrs. Jones's gaiety had brief life after Millie's remark. \"He ain't back\nwith the mail! I'll bet--\"\n\n\"Oh, mother!\" Millie, deeply concerned, came from behind the desk and\nwent up to the older woman, questioning, \"You don't suppose his pension\nhas come?\"\n\n\"I think it's gone!\" Mrs. Jones bowed emphatically in a rising voice and\nhurried to the desk on the Nevada side, where she took a cursory but\nnone the less exhaustive look at the mail indexes. \"I found him hanging\naround this desk this morning, and when I come in he beat it, sayin',\nbefore I could stop him, that he was goin' after the mail. I wonder--\"\nShe stopped and gave a deep groan of acquiescence. \"Huh! Huh!\" She had\nopened up the top of the desk to find a half-filled flask. \"There!\" she\nexclaimed, holding it to the light. \"He was waiting for a chance to get\nthis when I shooed him away!\"\n\nMillie put her arm around her and drew her into the middle of the room,\ntrying to soothe her. \"Anyway, don't let's blame him for anything until\nwe're sure. He may come home perfectly all right. You know he loves the\nwoods and the lake and the autumn coloring which is so wonderful now. He\nalways lingers like this. Please go up-stairs and have a good rest.\"\nMillie tried to lead her mother toward the stairs, but Mrs. Jones gently\nshook the girl's arm from about her waist and went toward the kitchen.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Millie asked, standing still, a puzzled frown\ngiving place to an understanding laugh as Mrs. Jones hesitated and\nlooked at the floor, answering in a manner half ashamed: \"Why--well--I\nthought--\" she stammered, \"he might come home soon, an' he's used to\nfindin' somethin' good kept warm--though he don't deserve it!\"\n\nShe hesitated, her kindly, better nature shining in her eyes, battling\nfor expression. \"Yes--please set a place for him, Millie!\" And Mrs.\nJones hastily disappeared into the kitchen to avoid the girl's rippling\nlaugh of gentle amusement. Smiling to herself, Millie crossed the lobby\nand went into the dining-room.\n\nThe moment she had left the lobby the street door of the hotel was\npushed open cautiously and an inquiring head thrust itself in. The head\nwas that of Bill Jones. Evidently satisfied that the coast was clear,\nBill came slowly into the lobby. Looking warily up at the stairs on\neither side, and toward the dining-room and kitchen doors, he eased\nhimself softly over to the Nevada desk, raised the top and fumbled\nexpectantly inside.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nAs Bill reached the desk and lifted the top, another gray-haired old\nman, possibly the same age as Lightnin', though larger and huskier in\nbuild, stole in through the street door and stood there doubtfully,\npuffing a cigar. He looked about fearfully, evidently ready to decamp at\nan instant's notice; but his glance, traveling back to the figure at the\ndesk, bespoke a childlike trustfulness in Bill Jones. This gentleman's\nclothes were as disreputable as might be, as was his battered\nslouch-hat. His face was very red and very unshaven, and his expression\nwas a comical mixture of uncertainty as to his welcome on the premises\nand maudlin kindliness toward the world at large. He rejoiced in the\nname of \"Zeb,\" and was a down-and-out prospector, a relic of the past.\nHis only reason for existence these days seemed to be that he was a\ncrony and devout satellite of Bill's--to the great aggravation of Mrs.\nJones. There was a legend in the district that Zeb and Bill had spent\nmany years together in the old days, up and down the trails. There\nseemed to be considerable truth in the story. Anyway, no efforts of Mrs.\nJones's or of anybody else's could make Bill forget his pal. Zeb was\nalways sure of a meal, or a drink and a cigar, provided Lightnin' could\nfind a way of producing those necessities of a broken-down prospector's\nlife.\n\nBill felt around in the desk for a minute, while Zeb watched, fearfully,\nhopefully; then Lightnin' turned around, disappointment in his face. But\nbefore he could break the sad news regarding the strange disappearance\nof a half-filled flask, Zeb held up a warning finger and began to back\nthrough the door. His ear, ever keen for the swish of Mrs. Jones's\nskirts, reported danger.\n\n\"What's the matter, Zeb?\" Bill asked. \"Aw, come back. What ye 'fraid\nof?\" With a disgusted motion he beckoned Zeb into the room again.\n\nBut Zeb, answering the warning that had never failed him, stayed close\nto the door, whispering back to Bill, \"Where's your old woman?\"\n\n\"That's all right. Come on in. She ain't here now.\" Bill, determined in\nhis search, lifted the lid a second time and began to take out the\ncontents of the drawer.\n\nZeb, taking heart, tiptoed up to him and, looking over his shoulder,\nmurmured, contemptuously, \"I don't believe you've got a drop.\"\n\n\"I'll show ye!\" Looking intently under the lid, Bill's voice was half\nsmothered. It stopped short when the kitchen door flew open and Mrs.\nJones burst with emphatic and quick tread into the room.\n\nShe did not pay heed to Bill at once. Zeb received the full force of her\nmood. \"Clear out now!\" she called, in no gentle tone, as she swept up to\nhim--an unnecessary action, as Zeb, catching one glance of the irate\nwoman, made double-quick time in getting out of the door and down the\nsteps of the veranda.\n\nZeb disposed of, Mrs. Jones turned her attention to her errant husband.\nBoth arms akimbo, she stood still in the middle of the floor and\nconcentrated her glare upon him.\n\n\"Bill Jones,\" she asked, in a loud, rasping tone, \"where have you been?\"\n\nBill had put down the lid at the first hint of her entrance. While she\nwas addressing Zeb he had quietly slipped behind the desk and busied\nhimself with the mail which he had drawn from the back pocket of his\ntrousers. Whistling softly to himself, he sorted the letters, placing\nthem in their proper pigeonholes.\n\nHe did not answer Mrs. Jones at once, but went on whistling. After a\nsecond in which he decided that a soft answer might draw the sting from\nher wrath, he stood still and, without looking around, said, gently,\n\"Hello, mother.\" Without waiting for a reply, he went on sorting the\nmail.\n\nThe fire in Mrs. Jones's eye flamed brighter. Nothing exasperated her as\ndid Bill's refusal to take her tempers seriously. It was not easy to do\nall of the fighting--one reason why Bill usually succeeded in carrying\nhis idleness with a high hand. But this time she was not going to be\nignored. The conference with Hammond and Thomas, the knowledge that he\nhad been looking for his flask--that he was looking for it more for\nZeb's sake than his own, this time, made no difference--as well as\ncomplaints by the guests because of Bill's tardiness with the mail, had\nexhausted her patience and whetted her into bringing Bill to quick\norder.\n\n\"Do you know what time it is?\" She took a step closer to Bill, her\nvoice retaining its hard ring.\n\nBill paid no attention to the question, but went on whistling and\nsorting the mail.\n\n\"It's after two o'clock!\" She stamped her foot and glared at him.\n\nHer glare fell on unseeing eyes, her tones on unheeding ears, for the\nuneven tenor of Bill's whistle kept up and the spasmodic sorting of the\nmail went on.\n\n\"Let's see,\" he said, softly, to himself, \"Mrs. Taft's letter--she's in\nNumber Four, ain't she?\" he addressed his wife. Receiving no answer\nhimself this time, he kept on with his soliloquy, changing the letter to\nits proper place. \"There! that's right. This one,\" he said, holding the\nenvelop to the light and studying it, \"is for Mr. Thomas.\" He hesitated\nand looked at it more closely. Placing the other letters on the desk, he\ncame from behind it and went toward Mrs. Jones.\n\nNoting that Mrs. Jones was interested in the letter and that she had\nmade a quick move toward him, he changed his mind and sauntered to the\nother side of the room, still scrutinizing the letter in his hand. As he\npaused, he placed the envelop close to his eyes and read, \"Raymond\nThomas Es-_Q._\"\n\nMrs. Jones, her arms folded across her adamant breast, narrowed her eyes\ninto a quizzical stare. Satisfied that her estimate of Bill's condition\nwas correct, she hastened to verify it. Going close to him, she\ndemanded, \"Bill, have you been drinkin'?\"\n\nFor once in his life Bill could prove his innocence. He was quick to\navail himself of the opportunity, and, much to her surprise, he turned\nand blew his blameless breath at her.\n\nMrs. Jones relaxed, exclaiming, in tones of relief, \"Thank the Lord!\"\n\n\"What's He got to do with it?\" Bill asked, quickly.\n\nMrs. Jones smiled. For the time being her manner was mollified. She\nfollowed him to the desk behind which he had returned to the mail-rack.\n\"You know,\" she explained, \"it's 'way past dinner-time, and if you won't\nwork, the least you can do is to be on time for your meals.\"\n\n\"I been workin',\" Bill chirped, as he placed the last letter in its box\nand went toward the dining-room door.\n\nMrs. Jones placed herself in the middle of the room and in such a way\nthat Bill could not reach his goal without passing her. \"What work have\nyou been doin'?\" The sarcasm in the glance which pierced Bill's shifting\ngaze did not pierce his good humor. He continued to chirp. \"I got the\nmail.\"\n\n\"The mail?\" There was contempt in his wife's question and in the answer\nshe gave to it. \"The mail came at ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"I got it, didn't I?\" Bill registered another cheerful quip.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Jones's mind recurred to the day of the month. Her\ncontempt gave place to anxiety and she stepped close to her husband and\nlooked into his face again. \"Bill, was there a letter for you?\" she\nasked.\n\nBill did not answer her with words. Instead he looked away from her and\nshook his head slowly.\n\n\"Bill Jones,\" his wife persisted, her tones reverting to their former\nclear coldness, \"didn't your pension come to-day?\"\n\n\"To-day?\" Bill smiled a self-congratulatory smile for the word which\ngave him the loophole of escape. Had his wife omitted that one word he\nwould have, for his honor's sake, been forced to admit that he had it.\nFor it was a part of his peculiar code that under no circumstances was\n\"mother\" ever to be lied to. Prevarications, yes, but downright,\nindisputable lies, no. And that with vigorous emphasis. But now she had\nmentioned the day. The pension had not come to-day. It had reposed in\nhis pocket since yesterday, where, true to his promise to John Marvin,\nit should remain until he had made up his mind to hand it over to his\nfamily. So he felt the coins in his pocket and looked up at her with a\nhalf-guilty grin, drawing out his words one by one, in halting tones.\n\"Not--to--day.\"\n\n\"Well, when it does come,\" she said, pleasantly, \"Millie's going to go\nto Truckee with you and buy you some clothes. You gotta have some new\nones for when we goes to the city.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of Bill's tongue to reaffirm, as he had countless\ntimes, that he was never going to the city as long as he lived; but he\nhad begun to realize in the last few days that tact must enter into his\nnegotiations with his dissatisfied spouse. So he responded, mildly, \"I\ngot clothes enough.\"\n\nMrs. Jones made an impatient gesture and tossed her head in dismay. \"I\ndon't know what's got into you, Bill Jones. When you came courtin' me\nyou had good clothes.\"\n\n\"This is the same suit.\" Bill's jest might have brought further nagging\nupon his shoulders, but Millie's entrance from the dining-room turned\nMrs. Jones's attention to her.\n\n\"Oh, daddy, you're back!\" Millie went quickly to her foster-father and\nattempted to put her arms about his neck.\n\nHe drew away from her, asking, quickly, \"What of it?\"\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Her tones were anxious and her gaze not less so.\nWhereupon Bill proved his sobriety just as he had proved it to her\nmother.\n\n\"Now are you satisfied?\" he asked, as she smiled at him.\n\nKissing him, Millie reminded him gently that it was past dinner-time and\nthat he had better go into the dining-room, where something hot awaited\nhim.\n\n\"Please come now, daddy,\" she added. \"The girls want to get their work\ndone.\"\n\nBill hesitated. He glanced surreptitiously over at the Nevada desk,\nwhere, to the best of his knowledge, he had deposited a half-filled\nflask the night previous. His wife's eye, however, was on him. Suddenly\nshe stepped up to him and took him firmly by the arm.\n\n\"Bill Jones,\" she said, \"you're comin' right inside now an' eat!\nWhatever else is on your mind can wait--an' it might be a waste o' time,\nanyway!\"\n\nFinding himself propelled toward the dining-room, Lightnin' cast an\nappealing, whimsical glance at Millie, but she covertly shook her head\nto indicate that even she could not gainsay Mrs. Jones just then.\n\nLeft alone, Millie busied herself at the desk with some accounts which\nshe wanted to finish before the arrival of a fresh contingent of guests,\ndue that afternoon. She put down her pencil after a few minutes of work,\nhowever, and leaned her elbows on the desk, her chin in her hands\nthoughtfully. She had a well-defined suspicion as to where Lightnin' had\nbeen the night previous, and--well, Millie was curious about it.\n\nHer reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Lemuel Townsend.\nThere was an air of importance about him. He was frock-coated and\naltogether spick and span.\n\n\"Hello, Millie!\" he said, walking up to the desk and shaking hands with\nher. \"I've been trying to get around here all week, but I'm mighty\npressed for time these days, you know! How is everything? You're all\nfilled up, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Nevada is full,\" Millie answered, smiling; \"it always is, but the\nCalifornia side is often empty. Oh, it's great fun--I call it the Hotel\nLopside! Sometimes I'm sorry that we're giving it up.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then you've really decided to put through the idea of selling the\nplace!\"\n\n\"Yes. Mother made up her mind this morning, and I more than approve it,\nall things considered. Daddy hasn't--hasn't quite agreed, though, but\nit's for his own good. I don't quite understand daddy's objections. I\nwanted to talk to him this morning about it, but I didn't get a chance.\nThere's been something mysterious in his manner lately.\"\n\n\"Something mysterious--about Lightnin'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Millie, thoughtfully. \"Mother hasn't noticed it, of course,\nbeing so busy and worried--and outwardly daddy is his usual easy-going,\namiable self. But I have a feeling that he has--or thinks he\nhas--something up his sleeve. Daddy can't hide things from me, you know!\nAnother thing, he doesn't seem to like Mr. Thomas at all--is downright\nrude to him at times. I can't understand it, for it isn't like daddy!\"\n\nTownsend frowned in a puzzled way. \"Perhaps you're taking some of dear\nold Lightnin's notions too seriously, Millie,\" he remarked. \"Though I\nmust say that I have a great deal of faith in Bill. I've been a little\nout of touch with the situation lately,\" he went on, judicially, \"but\nfrom what you and mother have told me about the proposed sale, and from\nthe one or two talks I have had with Mr. Thomas, I am inclined to agree\nwith you and mother that this sale is an excellent idea. So far as I can\njudge, it is a sound investment and all for the best.\"\n\n\"Of course it is!\" said Millie. \"But now--how about yourself? How is the\ncampaign going, Mr. Townsend?\"\n\n\"Splendidly! But it's rather trying, as I have to do most of the\ncampaigning myself--even the odd jobs!\"\n\nHe looked down at a bundle of large, printed placards which he carried\nunder his arm. Withdrawing one, he held it up for her inspection. Millie\nread, \"Vote for Lemuel Townsend for Superior Judge of the Second\nJudicial District.\"\n\n\"Would you mind if I tacked up some of these in the lobby?\" he asked,\njoining in her laugh.\n\n\"Not at all!\" Millie exclaimed. \"I've a hammer and tacks right here in\nthe desk. Let me help you--and I do so hope you'll win!\"\n\nChatting, they proceeded to embellish the lobby with Lem Townsend's name\nand ambition. Their operations were brought to a pause by the arrival of\nthe expected new guests.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAs the motor-stage drew up to the door, Millie ran out on the veranda to\ndeliver a few commissions to the driver to execute when he got back to\ntown. She noted that Sheriff Blodgett was a passenger, and that he\njumped down and preceded the guests into the lobby.\n\nThe first of the new arrivals to step out of the stage and enter the\nhotel was a chic little woman of about twenty-four, with big brown eyes\nand auburn hair, dressed in a bright blue outing-flannel coat and skirt\nand a tiny red hat from which hung a heavy veil. It was obvious that she\nwas suffering from great embarrassment, as she walked quickly about the\nlobby, going from one register to the other, while a maid followed her\nwith an armful of bundles. The woman looked helplessly from wall to wall\nand desk to desk. The presence of Blodgett and Townsend seemed to add to\nher embarrassment, a condition still further aggravated by the\nappearance of a third man, Everett Hammond, who chanced to come\nstrolling down from up-stairs at the moment. She fluttered up to Millie\nas the girl came in from the veranda.\n\n\"Would you like to register?\" Millie asked.\n\n\"How do you do,\" was the reply, uttered in a timid treble. \"I am Mrs.\nHarper. I understand--\" Her head turned from side to side as she\nhesitated. She clasped her hands and gazed pleadingly at Millie. \"I've\nbeen told--\" Again she hesitated nervously, tears in her eyes. She\nnoticed Blodgett and Hammond gazing at her. In desperation, her blushes\nshowing under the heavy veil, she whispered, quaveringly, \"Could I speak\nto you privately?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Millie, hiding her amusement. \"Just step into this\nroom,\" and she led the little woman away.\n\nAs they left the room, followed by the faithful maid, another guest\nentered, an attractive woman of thirty. She was highly colored as to\nhair and complexion, and she had about her an air far removed from the\nchic, haughty member of the millionaire divorce colony that centered\nabout the Reno hotels. In type she was not unlike Mrs. Harper, except\nthat she did not show any special evidence of timidity. On the contrary,\nshe seemed perfectly at home. But she came in with the aid of a crutch\nand leaning on the arm of the stage-driver. Her eyes took a calm\ninventory of the lobby--including Townsend, on whom she smiled\ncoquettishly as she sighed with relief and sank into a chair.\n\nTownsend was leaning against the California desk, and he had been\nwatching Blodgett and Hammond, who, conversing in low tones, had\nstrolled out to the veranda. He was surprised to note that the pair had\nmet before and seemed to know each other quite well. His attention,\nhowever, was now drawn to the attractive new guest. Her smile was not\nwithout effect. She turned to the driver.\n\n\"I'm all right now, thank you,\" she drawled, though her voice was soft\nand pleasant. \"Just drop my bag here.\" Fumbling in her purse for change\nthat did not seem to be there, she directed a glance toward Townsend and\nsmiled again. \"Will you change five dollars for me?\" she asked.\n\nTownsend drew out his wallet and examined its contents, but put it back\nagain disappointedly. \"I'm afraid I can't,\" he said, with obvious\nregret.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the attractive woman, with a frown, \"pay the driver,\nplease.\"\n\nTownsend gave a slight start of chagrin, feeling that his standing as a\ncandidate for a judgeship was suffering by her lack of discernment.\nThen, as the truth of the situation dawned on him, he suppressed a\nchuckle. Without a word, he handed some change to the driver.\n\n\"Charge it to my account,\" she ordered, settling herself comfortably in\nthe chair, extending one foot which was bound in a heavy bandage about\nthe ankle and clad in a soft slipper.\n\nTownsend, still smiling, began: \"Well--er--\"\n\n\"I'm Mrs. Davis,\" she interrupted, ignoring his embarrassment. \"Mrs.\nMargaret Davis.\" She turned her wide blue eyes full upon him as she\nswitched in her chair, the movement bringing a twinge of pain to her\nface.\n\nTownsend left the desk and came toward her. \"I'm very glad to meet you.\"\nHe extended an affable hand. \"I'm Lemuel Townsend, and I--\"\n\nMrs. Davis did not offer him her hand at once, but gave him an\ninquisitive glance. \"Will you show me to my room?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know where it is,\" he said, laughing. By this time his ruffled\ndignity was assuaged by the twinkle in Mrs. Davis's eye and the deep\ndimple in her chin.\n\n\"Why, weren't you expecting me?\" she asked, in astonishment, her mind as\nyet refusing to grasp the situation.\n\n\"No, I wasn't.\" He was bending over her, a courtly flattery in his gaze.\n\n\"But I wrote you!\" She turned clear about on her chair, forgetting for\nthe moment the pain in her foot, her eyes and mouth wide open with\nsurprise at the thought that she could be thus forgotten.\n\n\"No, you didn't write me. You see, I'm only a guest, just as you are.\"\n\nHere they both laughed, while Townsend placed a chair close to hers and\nsat down beside her.\n\nMrs. Davis prolonged her giggle and bent her head, her eyes seeking his\nunder her heavily beaded lashes. \"And I said--Oh!\" She put her two hands\nto her mouth and sidled, \"I took you for the clerk.\"\n\nHe nodded indulgently.\n\n\"Oh, and I made you pay the driver! I couldn't allow that. Just as soon\nas somebody comes I'll return it. I hope you'll forgive me.\" By this\ntime her manner was as friendly as Townsend's feminine-loving soul could\nwish. She sidled her chair a little closer to his, still holding him\nwith her eyes, wide as the innocent stare of a baby.\n\n\"I'm glad it happened,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"Will you allow me to introduce myself properly?\"\n\nShe nodded, and he got up and went to the desk, returning with one of\nhis campaign cards and handing it to her. \"Permit me,\" he said, \"my\ncard.\" As she took it from him he explained, \"I'm candidate for judge at\nthe next election.\"\n\nImmediately Mrs. Davis's interest was aroused to fever pitch. With a\nknowing look she leaned forward, placing a hand on his arm, while she\nslowly and attentively dwelt upon the words on the card. \"Oh, really?\"\nshe drawled. \"Where will you be judge?\"\n\n\"If I'm elected--in Reno.\"\n\n\"Will you try divorce cases?\" the question was snapped out.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Oh, I'm awfully glad to meet you!\" she gushed, shaking his arm.\n\n\"The pleasure is mutual, believe me,\" he responded, placing his hand on\ntop of hers. As she withdrew hers with a giggle, he went on, unabashed,\n\"Do you intend remaining here long?\"\n\n\"I'm in for six months.\" She sighed like a hurt baby.\n\nHe was all sympathy as he leaned toward her and apologized: \"Oh, I'm\nvery sorry for you, Mrs. Davis--If--\"\n\n\"Oh, my case doesn't call for sympathy. Congratulations!\nCongratulations!\" she emphasized with a long-drawn-out inflection.\n\n\"Oh!!!\" he shook his head wisely, adding, laughingly, \"It's that way?\"\n\nA twinge from the invalid ankle concentrated Mrs. Davis's full attention\nas she lifted her foot, adjusting it against the crutch, thinking to\nstop the pain. When it had subsided she smiled up at Townsend again,\npointed to it and said, with an ing\u00c3\u00a9nue turn of the head, \"I'd probably\nnever have been able to get a divorce if it had not been for this.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that your husband was brute enough to--\" Townsend was\nshocked at the thought, but was not allowed to deliver himself of his\nfull sympathy. Mrs. Davis was just getting into the lines of her part\nand she was quick to catch her cues.\n\n\"Oh, heavens, no!\" she broke in upon his condolences. \"This was an\naccident. It's a sprain, and it is quite serious, as I'm a dancer.\" She\nbeamed up at him and wriggled in the chair, continuing her explanation.\n\"It's probably all for the best. Of course it'll break into my\nengagements. I'm in vaudeville, you know. I've wanted a divorce for\nyears, but I'm always booked solid and I never stay in one place long\nenough to get one. When this happened I saw my chance to get a good long\nrest, and my freedom in the bargain.\" Her eyes begged his for\nunderstanding and received it.\n\nWhile she had been talking Townsend had been drinking in every word she\nsaid. Her variety of attractiveness was a new one to him. It appealed to\nhis small-town idea of being a gay blade. He had often cast longing eyes\nat the Eastern wives sojourning in Reno for the six months necessary to\nestablish a residence and therefore their right to a quick freedom which\nbrought with it no restrictions in the matter of remarrying. The\nmajority of these prospective divorc\u00c3\u00a9es were of a larger world and\nreckoned in figures of which Lemuel Townsend did not know the simplest\nrules. The only notice he had received for his ambitions being a smile\nto his face and a snicker at his back. But here was some one who not\nonly was taking notice of him, but was actually meeting his advances\nhalf-way. Besides, she was pretty, and he could never withstand a pretty\nwoman. As she finished the first lap of her story he exclaimed, \"That\ncertainly is a scheme!\"\n\n\"It's nice of you to listen to it all,\" she murmured, apologetically,\nmoving her idle crutch up and down as if writing her mood in invisible\nletters on the floor.\n\n\"I'm glad you told it to me. Do you know--\" and he sidled in his chair,\nwhile a sugar-laden approval beamed at her in a steady flow from over\nthe top of his glasses, \"from the minute I saw you enter the door I was\nworried about you--I was afraid--Well, it was a great relief to find\nthat you had two good--\" he halted in hopeless confusion, as his eyes\nsought her ankle. He took his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his\nnose furiously, hoping to hide the real reason for a blush that seemed\nto have come to stay, having settled in a deep crimson even from the\nnape of his neck to the top of a head whose sparse hair refused to hide\nhis embarrassment.\n\nBut Margaret Davis, seeing no reason for shyness, just smiled graciously\nupon him and hastened to standardize her reputation. \"Any one who has\nseen me dance can inform you about--well--about--_them_,\" she said\nseriously, adding by way of flavor to her remark another languishing\ndroop of her eyelids. There was a moment of coy silence for the two of\nthem. Then Mrs. Davis asked, \"Are you stopping here for pleasure or are\nyou doing time?\"\n\n\"I'm a bachelor.\"\n\n\"How nice!\" she replied, in honeyed accents, as she leaned toward him\nand put a soft hand on his arm. Undoubtedly in Lem Townsend she saw the\npossibility of an easy divorce trial. Besides, Townsend was by no means\nwithout personal attractions. Mrs. Davis gazed at him, her languishing\nsmile concealing the feminine appraisal in her eyes. She decided to\ncultivate the possibility, and was about to say something in furtherance\nof her object when she was startled by a gentle voice coming from\ndirectly behind her and inquiring, pleasantly, \"Rheumatism?\"\n\nBill Jones had entered the lobby unobserved by the pair and was leaning\nover the desk idly, looking at his new guest with kindly interest.\nTownsend introduced Bill, and Mrs. Davis, with Lem's assistance, rose\nand took up a pen.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"I have not acquired rheumatism as yet, Mr. Jones. I'll\nregister--you're reserving a room for me.\"\n\n\"How long you here for?\" Bill asked.\n\n\"The usual,\" she sighed, and rolled her eyes toward Townsend.\n\n\"Eh?\" Bill grinned and walked slowly from behind the desk.\n\n\"Six months,\" she drawled, wearily.\n\nPolitely staying her hand and taking the pen from her, Bill pointed to\nthe other desk. \"This is the six months' side--over here,\" he said,\nsauntering to the back of the Nevada desk.\n\nWhen the lady was at last settled in her room, and Townsend had\nleft--having made an arrangement to dine with Mrs. Davis that\nevening--Bill found himself strangely alone for the moment. Instantly he\nseized on the opportunity to make a thorough investigation into the\nmysterious disappearance of a half-filled flask. After turning the\nNevada desk inside out, at last he was convinced that the disappearance\nwas a fact and not a matter of imagination. \"Guess mother has\nseequesterated it,\" he remarked, to himself. \"Not that I'm hankerin'\nafter it so much myself, but I told Zeb I had it, an' when he finds that\nI 'ain't, the moral effect on Zeb will sure be bad.\"\n\nAs Bill, rolling a cigarette, meditated on this, Mrs. Harper, followed\nby her maid and still casting about like a frightened bird in search of\ncover, tiptoed into the lobby, went uncertainly to the California desk\nand took up a pen.\n\nWisdom twitching at the corners of his mouth, Bill was beside her at\nonce.\n\n\"Is either o' you ladies gettin' a divorce?\" he inquired, in a helpful\ntone, his question including the indignant maid. \"'Cause, if you are,\"\nhe explained, \"I just wanted to let you know that you are flockin' round\nthe wrong desk.\"\n\nMrs. Harper fluttered some more. \"Oh, I--er--but--where--\"\n\n\"This way, my dears,\" Bill said, in a gentle, fatherly tone, as he led\nthem to the Nevada desk.\n\nMrs. Harper signed her name. As Bill read it he looked up at her with\nsudden interest. He put a detaining hand on her arm before she could\nflutter away, and at the same time, turning to the maid, he directed her\nto have a chair for a moment--at the other side of the lobby, out of\nearshot.\n\nWhen the maid had complied Bill looked down at the register. \"Mrs.\nHarper, Truckee,\" he repeated. Then, glancing up at the surprised and\nstartled little woman, he asked, \"Does your husband happen to drive a\ngreen automobile, ma'am?\"\n\nMrs. Harper stared at him with the big, frightened eyes of a child.\n\"Why--er--yes. But--why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I met him last night,\" said Bill. \"He's a fast driver, ain't he? Gets\nto Truckee in two hours!\"\n\nThe color rose to the little woman's face. \"I don't see--\"\n\n\"He's a mighty fine feller!\" Bill went on, calmly. \"Got a pile o' money,\ntoo, an' I bet he's some generous with it--specially to them what he\nloves. People is always makin' fool mistakes. Say, you ain't really\ngoin' to git a divorce, are you?\"\n\nNow the astonished little woman's eyes filled with angry tears. \"Oh!\"\nshe gasped. \"Oh! How dare you speak to me like this! It's none of your\nbusiness!\"\n\n\"Sure it is,\" said Lightnin', his voice kindly, confidential. \"I know\nall about it. He didn't git that present for his stenographer.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" she snapped.\n\n\"I heard him tellin' all about it to Marvin, the boy what sold him that\ntimber up yonder. I knocked,\" Bill explained, whimsically, \"but they\ndidn't seem to hear, an' I was kinder forced to listen in from the\noutside. Your husband was all het up an' near committin' suicide 'cause\nyou thought he done what he didn't. He told Marvin he bought that\npresent for you when he was in Noo York. He was just a-showin' it to his\noffice lady when you walked in.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"No, it ain't. It's truth. There's some things I don't go wrong on, an'\nthis is one, Mrs. Harper. Your husband's a mighty fine feller an'--\"\n\nWith a stamp of her foot, the little woman flung away from the desk\nand, followed by the faithful maid, hurried up-stairs, where--and\nperhaps Bill suspected this--she buried her head in a pillow and cried\nand cried.\n\nBill stood at the desk with his head cocked on one side, idly tapping\nhis ear with a pen. He heard the door of Mrs. Harper's room slam and he\ngrinned amiably.\n\n\"Eatin' her heart out for him,\" he mused. \"Just eatin' her heart out,\nbut too spunky to back down!\"\n\nHe gazed thoughtfully at the ceiling for a few minutes; then slowly he\nreached into the drawer and took out a telegram blank. His eyes twinkled\nas he wrote a brief message. He folded up the blank, stuffed it into his\npocket, and was turning away from the desk with the intention of seeking\nthe telegraph-office, when Hammond and Sheriff Blodgett came strolling\nback into the lobby.\n\n\"Oh, so you're actually here, are you?\" exclaimed Hammond, glaring at\nBill. \"Have you signed that deed yet?\"\n\nHammond, direct, bulldozing, totally lacking in Thomas's smooth\ndiplomacy, had lost all patience with Bill Jones. That morning he had\ndecided that the only way to handle Bill was to ride over him\nrough-shod. \"Have you signed that deed?\" he repeated, loudly.\n\n\"Deed?\" remarked Lightnin', carelessly. \"Oh, I'd kinder forgot about\nthat little matter. Nope. 'Ain't had time, old top--nope!\" Ignoring the\nglares of the two men, he started to amble toward the door.\n\n\"Look here,\" Hammond called after him, \"is Mr. Thomas in?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" replied Bill, pausing directly in front of Hammond and\ngazing up at him with a calm, shrewd light in his half-shut eyes. \"He\nseems to stick around pretty close.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hammond, with a heavy frown, \"just be good enough to step\nup and tell him that Sheriff Blodgett and I would like to see him!\"\n\n\"Step up yourself,\" said old Bill, quietly, without shifting either his\ngaze or his position. \"You ain't crippled, be you? An' I don't think as\nyour friend Thomas'll fall off'n his chair with surprise if you drop in\non him unexpected.\"\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, Bill turned away and ambled out of the\nlobby. Hammond swore; then strode angrily up-stairs, followed by\nBlodgett.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nA few minutes after Lightnin' disappeared down the trail, headed for the\nlocal telegraph-office, John Marvin approached the hotel from the\nopposite direction. He paused when some distance away and viewed the\nplace. It was his first visit in many weeks, and naturally his first\nsince the great transformation. It could be surmised, however, that this\nvisit was not one of idle curiosity; neither was his pause due to a mere\ndesire to observe the various changes recently made. He watched the\nestablishment closely for a minute; then came on slowly, keeping a sharp\neye on his surroundings. As he reached the steps Millie came out on the\nveranda. She was engaged in what, these days, had become one of the\nchief occupations of nearly every one in the Hotel Calivada--searching\nfor Lightnin' Bill Jones, whose persistent faculty of being absent when\nmost wanted was fast assuming the dimensions of a public aggravation.\n\n\"Why, hello, stranger!\" Millie exclaimed, with a welcoming smile. \"I\nthought you had forgotten all about us! You haven't been here for ever\nso long!\"\n\nMarvin came up the steps and seized both her hands, which she let him\nhold for a moment.\n\n\"I haven't forgotten _you_, Millie,\" he said, gently, smiling down into\nher brown eyes. \"But--well, you know I went away last time with an idea\nthat you didn't care to see me.\"\n\n\"Silly boy!\" Her tone was gaily impersonal, but her red lips puckered\ninto a pretty pout as she walked to a chair in the corner of the veranda\nand sat down.\n\n\"I thought that maybe you had returned to Mr. Thomas's office,\" he\nremarked, following her and standing beside her chair.\n\n\"No; I'm not going back, not now,\" said Millie, thoughtfully. She did\nnot look up at him, but fixed her gaze on her hands, folded in her lap.\n\"What a tremendous student you were in his office! I never saw any one\nwork so hard as you did.\"\n\n\"Except when you were in the room--then I was looking at you, most of\nthe time!\" Marvin bent over her, but she gave no sign that she read his\nattitude.\n\n\"If you'd been looking at me, I'd have seen you.\" She smiled and raised\nher eyes. \"You've not given up the study of law, have you?\" There was\nconcern in the lift of her brow.\n\n\"Oh no! But I'm not going back into Mr. Thomas's office. Why did you\nleave him, Millie? Was there any trouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble? Of course not! How could any one have trouble with Mr.\nThomas?\" Surprise and annoyance stood in her eyes.\n\nMarvin did not reply at once, but drew up another chair and sat down\nfacing her. He leaned forward, his eyes searching hers as he questioned,\n\"You like Mr. Thomas--like him very much, don't you, Millie?\"\n\n\"I more than like him!\" An angry color suffused her cheeks as she looked\nMarvin up and down. \"I adore him!\" she added. \"You've no idea how fine\nhe is!\"\n\nMarvin started at this--naturally. The situation was going to be more\ndifficult than he had anticipated. Could it be that Millie was really in\nlove with Raymond Thomas? Or had he merely convinced her that his\nbusiness motives were all that they should be? Perhaps it was both!\nAnyway, it was obvious that the girl had Thomas up on some sort of\npedestal; she was in a spunky mood, and Marvin saw that he was going to\nhave his hands full trying to convince her that the feet on the pedestal\nwere made of clay. Marvin flushed himself; he did not relish his\nposition; he shrank from seemingly disparaging another man behind his\nback, especially to a girl. If there had been only himself to consider,\nhe would not have spoken at all. Neither was it altogether for Millie's\nsake. She was young, capable, quick-witted; she would see through Thomas\nof her own accord, soon enough--if she were not actually in love with\nhim! But Marvin was thinking of the old people, of hard-working, simple\nMrs. Jones, and of amiable, careless Bill. Millie was the young, strong\nmember of the Jones household, and it was Millie who must be convinced\nand won over, if possible. Thus ran Marvin's thoughts--but quite\nhonestly he admitted to himself that his love for the girl might be\ncoloring his logic and his motives just a little.\n\n\"I'd like to tell you something I know about Thomas--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\" Millie interrupted, quickly. \"He sold some property for\nyour mother, isn't that it?\"\n\n\"Yes; he sold it to the railroad--for a big price.\"\n\n\"I know--he told me all about it. He's a splendid business man! Why,\nthat's exactly what he is doing for us! Hasn't daddy told you about it?\"\nShe glanced at him quickly, but he gave no sign of having heard this\nwonderful news. \"I should think you'd like to see Mr. Thomas. He's\nup-stairs packing, now. He's leaving this evening. He came all the way\nfrom San Francisco just to help me--to help us all!\"\n\n\"To help you?\" Marvin asked.\n\nMillie clasped her hands over her knees and went on, enthusiastically:\n\"Why, this hotel idea has turned out splendidly, you know. But a week or\ntwo ago, Mr. Thomas wrote to mother, saying that he had heard that the\nrailroad company had got wind of our success and contemplated putting up\na rival hotel just back of us. Mother was nearly crazy at the news, and\nI wrote to Mr. Thomas, asking him his advice. He telegraphed that he\nwould be right out to see us! Wasn't that just like him?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Marvin, dryly. \"And I presume that when Mr. Thomas\narrived he suggested that you let him persuade the railroad to buy this\nplace and erect the new hotel here, instead of next door!\"\n\n\"Why, John--aren't you clever!\" Millie exclaimed. \"How did you guess it?\nThat is exactly what he suggested, and now it's all arranged! And\nthey're going to pay enough to make mother and daddy comfortable for the\nrest of their lives!\"\n\nWith a hopeless gesture, Marvin got to his feet and took a pace or two\nup and down the veranda. The girl watched him, puzzled.\n\n\"Are they going to pay cash?\" Marvin asked, pausing in front of her.\n\n\"It's much better than cash! It's shares of stock that pay ten per cent.\na year! It seems almost too good to be true.\"\n\n\"It does--it certainly does!\" came from Marvin.\n\nThe girl had risen, glowing with enthusiasm. Quite naturally she put her\nhand on his arm and looked up at him happily, intimately, na\u00c3\u00afvely\nseeking his approval.\n\nIn the midst of his perplexity Marvin's heart gave a bound. That na\u00c3\u00afve\ntouch on his arm and the intimate light in the brown eyes told him that,\nin one respect at least, all was not lost--not yet! He was about to take\nher hands and break into a rush of words when the girl suddenly turned\nher attention from him, remarking, eagerly: \"Here comes daddy. We were\nafraid he'd deserted again!\"\n\nMarvin swung around. Much as he wanted to see Lightnin' to-day, he\nwished, just then, that Bill could have seen fit to delay his appearance\na few minutes longer. Bill Jones, however, came serenely up the steps\nand stood with his hands in his pockets, shrewdly and humorously\ninspecting the pair.\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt the billin' an' cooin',\" he remarked. \"But say,\nJohn, ain't you takin' some chances round here? Did you know that\nBlodgett's here? I seen him go up-stairs when I went out.\"\n\nMillie had flushed and turned away at her foster-father's first words,\nbut now she looked curiously from one to the other.\n\n\"What on earth do you mean, daddy?\" she questioned.\n\n\"He's just _helping me_, Millie,\" said Marvin, grinning at Bill. \"Thanks\nfor the tip, Lightnin', but I wanted to see you particularly to-day, so\nI--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, for Bill had raised a warning hand.\n\nMarvin recognized a familiar voice talking in the lobby. Glancing in,\nhe saw Raymond Thomas standing in the center of the room, holding Mrs.\nJones in conversation. Hammond and Blodgett had just come down the\nstairs and were joining the other two.\n\n\"Better beat it, John!\" Lightnin' whispered.\n\nBut Marvin stood there. He was thinking quickly. He had caught a word or\ntwo of what Thomas was saying, and he gathered that matters were coming\nto a climax. Suddenly his expression cleared and he grinned.\n\n\"Never mind about that, Lightnin',\" he said, mechanically opening the\ndoor for Millie, who, seeing that they were ignoring her, tripped in\nwith a petulant toss of her head. \"I think I have a little scheme that\nwill fool our friend Blodgett. But first--Bill, promise me that you\nwon't sign that deed without consulting me!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Lightnin', slowly. \"I promise. But you better be\ncareful, John, an'--\"\n\n\"Come on!\" Marvin interrupted, leading the way himself. \"I've a great\ndesire to be in on these proceedings!\"\n\nSeeing that the young man was not to be stopped, Bill said no more as he\nslid through the door and ambled after him into the lobby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n\"I think it is only fair to tell you, Mrs. Jones,\" Thomas was saying, a\ndelicate, apologetic note creeping into his voice as he caught sight of\nMillie, \"that this Marvin is not a proper person for your daughter to\nsee. I fully believed that he was a fine young man myself once, and you\ncannot imagine my surprise when I discovered that he is the head of a\ngang of thieves who are going all over this part of the country,\nstealing timber.\"\n\n\"Mercy me!\" cried Mrs. Jones. \"A thief, no less!\" Then, seeing Marvin\nunexpectedly present in person, she glared at him. \"Somethin' always\nwarned me against you, John Marvin! Oh, Millie, Millie! How many times\nhave I told you you was makin' a terrible mistake lettin' him annoy\nyou!\"\n\nMillie was evidently too astonished and puzzled to say anything.\nMeanwhile, Thomas had flushed deeply on finding himself confronted by\nthe man he was in the act of damning. Instinctively he took a step back.\nBlodgett made a quick move toward Marvin, but Hammond seized his arm and\nstopped him.\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Blodgett,\" he whispered. \"You can nab him later--he\ncan't very well get away from us now. I want to have a word, first--I'm\ngoing to show this young cub just where he stands!\"\n\nMeanwhile, though the sheriff's move did not escape him, Marvin, a grim\nsmile on his face, was gazing steadily at Thomas.\n\n\"Go on, Thomas,\" he said, quietly. \"I'm interested! What else were you\ngoing to say to Mrs. Jones?\"\n\nIndifferently he strolled over beside Lightnin', who was in front of the\nCalifornia desk, his hands in his pockets, his half-shut eyes roving\nfrom one to another of the group. To look at him, one would not imagine\nthat Bill Jones had any special interest in the proceedings. He drew out\nhis bag of tobacco and papers and idly rolled a cigarette.\n\nThomas, having regained his poise again, turned to Mrs. Jones with his\ndazzling smile. \"I'm really very glad that the young man chanced to\npresent himself at this moment, Mrs. Jones, because--\"\n\n\"That's all right, Thomas!\" Hammond interrupted, suddenly thrusting\nhimself forward and waving the other aside. \"But we have something much\nmore important on hand. Let's get to it! I can't monkey around here any\nlonger.\n\n\"Mrs. Jones,\" he went on, \"I've been trying to get you all together\nbefore I left, but you seem such busy people that it is as if I wouldn't\nhave this opportunity. I wanted to tell you that the company for which I\nam acting has just wired me to close the transaction, and so I am ready\nto take over the property at once!\"\n\nMrs. Jones, bewildered by his briskness and the swift sequence of\nevents, stared at him, then transferred a gaze no less confounded to\nThomas. \"You mean,\" she questioned, \"that--that you want us to leave at\nonce?\"\n\n\"Oh no! That's not necessary. But now that you have put your signature\nto the deed, the transfer will be made at once and we'll take over the\nmanagement, allowing you to remain on until you have made your\narrangements for the future.\"\n\nWith a sharp nod to her and an insolent sneer directed at Bill, Hammond\nswung on his heel and busied himself with a portfolio of papers he had\ndropped on the Nevada desk.\n\n\"I'm sure you can have no objections to these arrangements, Mrs. Jones,\"\nsaid Thomas, his voice as smooth as glass, though there was a slight\nquiver of his eyelids as he avoided Marvin's steady gaze and caught a\nstrange gleam that emanated from Bill's puckered-up eyes.\n\nMrs. Jones had forgotten all about Bill and his part in the signing of\nthe deed. But a multitude of thoughts were running through her mind,\nconfused as it was. All that she could think of now was the simplest\nanswer to Thomas's question. She stepped up to him and put a hand of\nconfidence on his arm.\n\n\"Certainly I do not mind,\" she said. \"I'm delighted and relieved that it\nis all settled!\" Turning to Hammond, she added: \"I want to leave the\nwhole matter in Mr. Thomas's hands. I'll do just as he advises.\"\n\n\"All right, Hammond,\" said Thomas, deliberately turning his back on old\nBill. \"We shall deliver the deed to you at once, and you can take charge\nof the place immediately. I presume you will want to have--\"\n\n\"Hold on there, young feller!\" Lightnin's usual lackadaisical monotone\nwas raised to a degree which bespoke a greater interest than his\ncareless attitude indicated. He stepped forward and stood in front of\nThomas, looking up at him with his shrewd gaze. When he felt that the\nman was ready to give him sufficient attention, Bill returned to his\ncustomary drawl.\n\n\"We ain't goin' to sell this place, my boy,\" he said. \"Not until I\nconsult my lawyer!\"\n\nHis words brought his wife to his side instantly, her eyes blazing.\n\"Bill Jones,\" she cried, \"you just be quiet! What in the world's the\nmatter with you--tryin' to throw away a chance to be nice and\ncomfortable the rest o' your life! Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Nope. I'm the only one that ain't--'cept John, here.\"\n\nBill's steady, quiet grin exasperated Hammond and Thomas to white heat,\nbut they were too near their goal to miss it by a step. They knew that\nunder ordinary conditions Bill, in spite of his many shortcomings, held\nfirst place in Mrs. Jones's affections, and that any show of harshness\ntoward him on their part might rally her unexpectedly to his support. So\nthey smothered their rage. Hammond leaned an elbow on the desk and\nnonchalantly twirled his watch-chain, his mouth drawn into an ugly\nsneer. Thomas continued his air of deference toward Mrs. Jones, leaning\nover her with an appealing smile. Reacting to it, she took Bill by the\narm and shook it roughly.\n\n\"You just got to listen to reason, Bill!\" she said, transfixing him with\nangry eyes. \"I set my heart on sellin' the place an' goin' to the city,\nas you oughter know by now. An', besides, it's 'most all fixed up,\nanyways--all but you signin' that deed. You got to do it, Bill!\"\n\n\"You're all het up, mother,\" replied Bill, gazing at her with kindly\neyes. \"Ease up a bit! Nope. I ain't goin' to sign no deed for them two\nscamps--leastways not until I consult my lawyer!\" And Bill pushed back\nhis battered slouch-hat and stuck his thumbs in his faded vest.\n\n\"Scamps--!\"\n\nBut before Mrs. Jones could complete her sentence Marvin stepped forward\nand put a friendly arm over Bill's shoulder.\n\n\"Bill's right, Mrs. Jones,\" he said, gently, though there was a fighting\nlight in his eyes as he met those of Thomas. \"Lightnin' has no need to\napologize for anything he may say about these two men. This sale is a\nnice little scheme of theirs. They are trying to rob you.\"\n\nMillie, who had been listening to it all, amazed and abashed, now stared\nat Marvin defiantly. \"How dare you say that?\" she blazed. \"What right\nhave you to interfere?\" She rallied to Mrs. Jones's side and placed an\naffectionate arm around her waist.\n\nMrs. Jones was crying by this time. She wiped her eyes on her apron and\nlooked at Marvin. \"So it's you who's been puttin' Bill up to this!\" she\nexclaimed. \"I might have known--it's right in line with what we just\nheard about you! Well, he don't need none o' your advice--you just leave\nBill alone!\"\n\nMarvin held out a deprecating hand. \"But, Mrs. Jones, you don't\nunderstand--\"\n\nBlodgett, at a sign from Hammond, strode up to Marvin and put a hand on\nhis shoulder. Marvin shook him off.\n\n\"Don't interrupt me now!\" he said. \"I've something more important to--\"\n\n\"I'll show you how important it is!\" said Blodgett, jingling a pair of\nhandcuffs in front of Marvin. \"I got a warrant for your arrest for\nstealin' timber! Put out your hands!\"\n\nMrs. Jones and Millie stood by, bewildered, while Thomas, with\nsupercilious satisfaction in his smile, sank into a chair and crossed\nhis legs with an air. Hammond laughed coarsely.\n\nBill, his arm drawn through Marvin's, looked on, his enigmatic grin\nbetween his half-closed eyes and half-open mouth betokening an\nunswerving confidence in the ultimate.\n\n\"I can't be bothered with you now,\" said Marvin, addressing Blodgett.\n\"Bill needs--\"\n\n\"None o' your lip!\" Blodgett grabbed him roughly and attempted to place\na handcuff on one of his wrists, but Marvin flung him off and the\nsheriff went sprawling. Marvin stepped back a pace or two as Blodgett\ngot up and came at him again, bawling, \"Now you're worse off than\never--resisting an officer of the law!\"\n\nMarvin, however, did not seem to be worried. He faced Blodgett with an\namused smile and pointed to the floor, where an uncovered space left\nbetween two rugs indicated the now famous state line.\n\n\"Law?\" Marvin echoed. \"Why, Blodgett, old boy, don't you know any more\nabout law than to try to serve me with a Nevada warrant when I'm in the\nstate of California?\"\n\n\"By jiminy, he's right!\" cried Lightnin', clapping Marvin on the back.\n\"You got 'em where--where the rugs is short, John. Guess I didn't build\nthis house on the state line for nothin'!\"\n\nBlodgett started back with a howl of disgust, while Thomas and Hammond\nlooked at each other, making no effort to hide their chagrin. Millie had\ngiven an exclamation--an exclamation that sounded very much like one of\nrelief, when she saw the sudden turn of the tables; but if it was an\nexpression of her inner and secret feelings, she quickly smothered it.\nMrs. Jones glared at Marvin with keen disgust and disappointment.\n\nLightnin', grinning, evidently was enjoying the scene hugely. Cocking\nhis old hat over one ear, he struck a pose of comic nonchalance against\nthe California desk and looked across the lobby at the furious Hammond.\n\n\"Hello, Hammond, old top!\" he called, airily. \"How's everythin' in\nNevada? Come on over to California, an'--an' have a glass o' water!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThe unexpected d\u00c3\u00a9nouement between Marvin and Sheriff Blodgett brought\nconsternation to those who had contrived toward his apprehension.\nEverett Hammond, in consultation with Thomas, would have taken the young\nman by force--for Hammond was a strapping six feet two or thereabouts,\nand Marvin was but a stripling in strength. But Thomas, cool and\ncontrolled, and always an advocate of keeping within the letter of the\nlaw, counseled him against any such hot-headed procedure, explaining\nthat it might militate against them in a court where outside operators\nin land or mining stocks were not looked upon with any too friendly a\nspirit. Mrs. Jones and Millie, astounded and uncomfortable in a\nsituation far afield from their uneventful lives, were too perplexed to\nspeak, contenting themselves with staring at Marvin in unbridled\ndisgust. Millie felt something of compassion for his predicament, but\nthe thought that any one she knew should be accused of theft filled her\nwith horror. Besides, it was he who was preventing her foster-father\nfrom signing the deed which would place them all in easy circumstances\nas against the difficulties of the present. Whatever of pity she had\nquickly disappeared. With one long look of disdain toward Marvin, she\nled Mrs. Jones up-stairs.\n\nBlodgett, after his first surprise, was overcome with rage at the\nknowledge that a whippersnapper such as he considered Marvin should have\nplaced him in such a ludicrous position. He, too, like Hammond, would\nhave liked to have tried force, but he knew that Marvin stood well among\nthe lumbermen in Washoe County and his attempt at re-election was too\nclose at hand to permit of his taking any chances when those to gain by\nthem were strangers without a voice in the politics of the section.\n\nWith a covert eye he watched Marvin, who stood a few feet from the line\nand smiled down at Bill, the latter grinning up at him, warming to the\naffectionate arm placed about his shoulder. As the two women went up the\nstairs, Marvin watched them, a half-shadow in his eyes as he caught\nMillie's disdainful glance. Giving Bill a good-by pat, Marvin, hat in\nhand, made a sweeping bow which took in Hammond, Thomas, and Blodgett.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" he laughed ironically. Sidling with his back\nto the California desk, he reached the door, where he waved his hand at\nhis astonished persecutors and slid out upon the veranda and down the\nsteps, where he wandered off in the twilight.\n\nBlodgett walked to the door and looked after him. \"Guess I'll stick\n'round a bit,\" he grumbled to Thomas, who had followed him to the door\nand was gazing after Marvin.\n\nHammond remained where he was, leaning up against the desk, watching\nThomas and Blodgett with surly eyes. \"You two are a nice pair of\nmollycoddles,\" he sneered, \"letting him make a get-away like that. If\neither of you had any gumption you'd have knocked him over the line.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" drawled the sheriff. \"'N' be arrested for assault. My\njurisdiction stops on this side of the line.\" He was silent, while he\ntook a piece of tobacco from his pocket and cut off a bite. After a\nminute he grunted: \"Humph! He'ain't gone yet. I'm goin' to stay here\n'til to-morrow mornin'. By that time he'll be home, for he 'ain't got no\nplace else to go. Then I'll nab him good 'n' quick.\"\n\nAll this time Bill had stood in the middle of the floor, listening to\nall that was said, saying never a word himself. Now he went slowly to\none side of the room, took a chair that stood against the California\nwall and placed it in front of the table, close to the dividing line.\nBlodgett, thinking there was reason for his act, so deliberate was it,\ntook a chair from its place near the Nevada wall and placed it parallel\nwith Bill's, seating himself in it.\n\nThe two men contemplated each other in silence. Thomas and Hammond stood\nin short consultation, and then the latter went to his room on the\nCalifornia side of the hotel, Thomas sauntering to a rocking-chair on\nthe veranda. He lighted a cigar and sat looking out over the lake, where\nthe moon was rising over the rim of the bordering Sierras.\n\nThere was scrutiny in the eye with which Blodgett viewed Bill. There was\ndistrust in the steady look which thrust itself between Bill's half-open\nlids and struck straight in the center of Blodgett's pupil. The latter\nopened his mouth to speak, but shut it again, as steps were heard on the\nveranda and Rodney Harper entered the lobby.\n\n\"Do you know where I can find John Marvin?\" he asked of the two men\nwhose backs he faced. Both immediately turned in their chairs, the\nsheriff alert for any news he might obtain of the habits and customs of\nthe man he was pursuing. Bill, when he saw who it was, arose and slowly\nwent toward him, holding out his hand.\n\n\"Oh! Hello, old chap! I got your telegram, also one from Marvin. Where\nis he?\" Harper grasped Bill's hand and gave it a hearty shake, glancing\nanxiously about the lobby.\n\nBill ignored the last question, keeping a slanting eye on Blodgett.\n\"Your wife's up-stairs,\" he whispered, with a nod toward the Nevada\nup-stairs hallway.\n\n\"Where?\" Harper turned in the direction of Bill's nod.\n\n\"In Nevada,\" Bill drawled, with a slow grin.\n\nHarper shrugged his shoulders and smiled at Bill, continuing with his\nsubject, \"What's the number of her room?\"\n\n\"You'd better go slow.\" Bill thrust his hands in his pockets, assuming\nan air of counselor. \"I told her I thought you'd be here.\"\n\n\"What did she say?\" Harper was at the register and going quickly down\nthe list. He came to his wife's name, letting his finger run across the\npage until he came to the number of her room; then he swept past Bill\nand had his foot on the first step when Bill stopped him.\n\n\"Ye'll spoil it all, if ye ain't careful.\" The old man drew the younger\none's head close to his mouth, speaking in low tones.\n\n\"What makes you say that? In your telegram you made me believe\neverything was all right,\" Harper said, as he leaned against the\nnewel-post.\n\n\"So 'twill be if you listen to some one that knows summat 'bout women.\nIf you chase chickens they run like wild-fire 'n' ye can't catch 'em\nunless you get 'em in a corner. But if you holds out your hand with a\nlittle feed, by 'n' by they eat right out of it.\"\n\nHarper laughed. \"That's what you think, is it?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Bill chuckled. \"You oughter heard what she said to me.\" Bill\nloved to think that he knew something the other fellow would like to\nknow. Even his sympathy with Harper and his desire to see all well\nbetween him and his wife could not contain him when it came to holding\nout in a matter of mere curiosity. \"I was goin' to tell you, but I'd\nbetter not,\" he added, with a wise look. \"'Twan't very encouragin',\" he\nadded.\n\nHarper walked away from the stairway, his arm through Bill's. \"Don't you\nthink you'd better tell me?\" There was real concern in Harper's voice\nand Bill knew it was the expression of the anxiety in his heart. Too,\nBill knew that it required tact to approach Mrs. Harper in her present\nhysterical mood.\n\nSo he answered, with a brusk shake of his head, \"Nope.\"\n\n\"Well, of all the damned-fool things!\" Harper stood still, letting go of\nBill's arm.\n\n\"I wouldn't call her that,\" Bill remonstrated, moving away from Harper\nwith a quick look of astonishment.\n\n\"Who's calling her that?\" Harper paced up and down, a scowl on his face.\n\"I mean the whole situation. It's such a silly mistake. And yet she\nwon't believe it.\"\n\n\"Same here.\" There was a warm sense of comradeship in the same sad cause\nin the air with which Bill made his last remark. It brought Harper to a\nstandstill. With a smile he listened to the old man's explanation.\n\"Folks don't believe nothin' I tell 'em. Women never do believe you when\nyou tell 'em the truth, but tell 'em a lie 'n' they swallows it hook 'n'\nbait. Why don't you write her a letter? Ef she knows yer here 'n' ain't\ntoo anxious ye got a good chance.\"\n\n\"I believe I'll do that. It sounds like a good scheme. Give her a chance\nto think things over instead of running in on her all of a sudden. Have\nyou got a room?\" Harper went to the Nevada desk and took up the pen to\nregister, but Bill interrupted him.\n\n\"Come on over here,\" Bill nodded to the California desk, following his\nown gesture to a place back of the counter. \"We always got plenty of\nroom on this side.\"\n\n\"Where's the bar?\"\n\nAt this question put by Harper, Bill's head struck an interesting and\ninquisitive attitude. \"Down to the saloon,\" he said.\n\nBut he was doomed to disappointment. \"Never mind, then,\" was Harper's\ndisheartening reply.\n\nBill's interest slackened, but was quickly revived as Harper, in the\nmiddle of scribbling a note to his wife, looked up long enough to add,\n\"I've got a flask in my bag.\"\n\nIt did not take Bill long to get from behind the desk. That bag was a\nfriend. He had promised Marvin that he would not spend his pension, and\nMrs. Jones had carefully removed the flask from its corner in the Nevada\ndesk. \"I'll show you right up,\" he exclaimed, making an undue and\nunaccustomed haste toward the stairs, bag in hand.\n\nAt the top of the stairs he stood, waiting for Harper to seal the\nenvelop.\n\nHarper came up the stairs, two at a time, and handed the letter to Bill,\noffering to take the bag from Bill as he did so. But Bill shook his hand\nloose. \"I'd better take the bag to the room for you first. Ye must be\npretty tired.\" There was a hidden implication in the monotone in which\nthe last speech was delivered.\n\nRodney Harper was too possessed of his own affairs to feel it, and with\nan impatient gesture he stooped to take his bag from Bill, pleading,\n\"Please, old man, won't you deliver the letter?\"\n\nBut Bill, attuned to a rare occasion, had quickly evaded Harper's\noutstretched hand and was down the hallway with the bag. He opened the\ndoor of Harper's room and went in first, depositing the bag on the\nfloor. Then he went up to the frowning guest, caught hold of his arm,\nand whispered:\n\n\"Marvin's here, but I didn't want them folks down-stairs to know it.\nThey come to git him fer cuttin' down your timber, but he jumped over\nthe California line. He'll be back by 'n' by, I'm thinkin'.\"\n\nHarper was interested in the news and asked Bill to let him know when\nMarvin was about again, but he was not interested enough to make him\nforget what was his present paramount concern. He gave a desperate\nglance toward the letter in Bill's hand.\n\nBut Bill had no intention of leaving until his own possessive intention\nwas fulfilled. He backed away from the bed where he had placed the bag,\nslowly retreating until he came to the door, which Harper had left open\nfor Bill's exit. When he reached the sill he grasped the knob with one\nhand, half closing it, while he stood in front of it on the inside. The\nanxiety in Harper's contracted brow met the slow grin that wrinkled\nabout Bill's eyes and mouth. A question started from Harper's tongue.\n\nBill forestalled it. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, slowly and gently, but with a\nwise twinkle in his blue eyes, \"thet there ain't no bar. Mother she\ndoesn't like drink.\" He paused a moment to see what effect his words\nwere having. As he saw his intention was slowly penetrating through\nHarper's absorption in his own affairs, Bill made his final coup. \"She\nlifted my flask from the desk, or I could be askin' you to have a swig.\"\n\nHarper threw back his head and laughed. \"So that's it!\" he exclaimed,\nhurriedly opening his bag and extracting the flask. \"Well, I tell you\nwhat I'll do. If you'll beat it in quick time with that note I'll treat\nyou to the whole darned flask.\"\n\nBill needed no second bidding. With flask secure in his back pocket he\nlost no time in descending the California stairs and mounting the flight\nto the Nevada half of the hotel and leaving the letter with Mrs. Harper.\nOn the way back to the lobby he slightly diminished the contents of the\nflask.\n\nHe entered the lobby with a smile whose target was the whole world and\nthrew himself whole-heartedly into the pleasure of tormenting Blodgett.\nHe knew that Blodgett was furious at the manner of Marvin's escape as\nmuch as at the fact itself. So he dropped into the chair next to the\nsheriff, drawling, \"You goin' over to Truckee to get a California\nwarrant?\"\n\nBlodgett gave Bill a mean look, sneering, as he sniffed at the air,\n\"Say, you're collecting something, ain't you?\"\n\n\"I didn't get nothin' from you,\" Bill answered, shortly. Which answer\nwas not without its point, Blodgett's reputation as one of the closest\nmen in Washoe County not being unknown to Bill.\n\n\"Don't get sore. I wished I was in your place,\" said Blodgett, as he\nfidgeted about in his chair and looked through the doorway.\n\nThomas, who had been on the veranda all this time, came indoors just as\nBlodgett finished his remark.\n\nBill caught it quickly, his smile flashing into a gleam of humor toward\nThomas.\n\n\"In my place?\" asked Bill, with a twinkle. With a nod toward Thomas, he\nadded, \"You're like that other fellow.\"\n\nThomas flushed, but ignored the innuendo. Taking a paper from his\npocket, he looked through it. At the California desk he stopped to sign\nhis name at the end of it. Then he called to Bill, \"Did you tell your\nwife we were waiting for her?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. I've been up visiting my friend Harper. He's a big\nmillionaire. Havin' trouble with his wife. Patched it up. Told him to\nwrite her a note 'n' I brought it to her. He gimme this fer the idea.\"\nBill produced the flask from his pocket and extended it toward Blodgett,\nbut when it was half-way on its journey he jerked it back, just as Mrs.\nHarper emerged from between the porti\u00c3\u00a8res of the Nevada upper hallway.\n\nClad in a fluffy, silken n\u00c3\u00a9glig\u00c3\u00a9e, she tiptoed half-way down the stairs\nbefore she saw Thomas, who had left the desk and was standing in the\ndoorway with his face toward the moonlit lake. She gave a smothered cry\nand was about to turn back. Bill held up a warning finger toward\nBlodgett, who quickly obeyed the injunction to look straight ahead.\n\nArising from his seat, the old man made a friendly motion toward the\nfrightened little creature on the stairs and she came down to where he\nstood in the middle of the floor, casting bewildered glances to right\nand left and trembling as he whispered in her ear:\n\n\"He's in Number Four. Hurry now, before any one catches on.\"\n\n\"Do they all know he's my husband?\" she flittered as she sped lightly up\nthe California stairs.\n\n\"I won't say nothin' about it.\" Bill could not resist a wink, which met\nwith a toss of Mrs. Harper's pretty head as she glided between the\nporti\u00c3\u00a8res toward her husband's room.\n\nBill went back to his chair again. Everett Hammond came into the room\nfrom the porch outside. Laying his hat on the California desk, he went\naround behind the counter and turned the pages of the register.\n\nBill did not sit down, but wandered over to the desk where Hammond stood\nand gazed at him through half-open eyes. \"Oh, you runnin' the place\nnow?\" he questioned.\n\nHammond did not answer him at once, but kept on running over the names\non the list. But there was a compelling force in the mild gaze of the\nold man which made Hammond stop to reckon with him. \"Yes,\" he said,\nbruskly, while he frowned at Bill. \"I've just settled everything with\nyour wife. All that's needed now is for you to sign that deed.\"\n\nThere was no answer forthcoming from Bill. Instead, he slowly took the\nflask from his pocket and held it in front of him. \"I'll take a drink\nwith you,\" he said, with a slow smile.\n\nHammond did not glance up, but answered, with a half-smile, \"I'm sorry,\nbut I, haven't got anything.\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Bill, shuffling toward him with the flask.\n\nBlodgett twisted about in his chair and called, \"You look and act as if\nyou'd had enough.\"\n\nBill left the desk and seated himself beside Blodgett again. \"I don't\nwant it for myself,\" he said, putting the spurned flask back in his\npocket; \"it's just for social--ability. I don't drink.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me that,\" scoffed the sheriff. \"You're a booze-fighter.\"\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" Bill answered, quickly.\n\nThen seeing a chance for romance, he added, \"I'm an Indian-fighter.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Blodgett drew out his answer in an accent that spoke of\ndisbelief.\n\n\"You bet it's so. Did you ever know Buffalo Bill?\" Bill leaned forward\nso he could see what impression he was making upon the sheriff.\n\nOut of the corner of his eyes Blodgett was watching Bill. \"Yes, I knew\nhim well,\" said the sheriff, gruffly.\n\nBill leaned closer to Blodgett and looked squarely into his eyes, which\nshowed the same doubt as his own. \"I learned him all he knew about\nkilling Indians. Did he ever tell you about the duel I fought with\nSettin' Bull?\"\n\n\"Settin' Bull?\" The sheriff sat up straight and let his glance travel\nthe length of Bill's body and back again to the old man's eyes, which\nwere not quivering a lash.\n\n\"He was standin' when I shot him,\" grinned Bill. \"I never took advantage\nof nobody, not even an Indian.\"\n\nThe sheriff relaxed contemptuously into his chair again. \"You've got a\nbee in your bonnet, 'ain't you?\"\n\n\"What do you know 'bout bees?\" Bill started to roll a cigarette.\n\n\"Not much. Do you?\" was Blodgett's reply as he looked straight ahead.\n\nBill slowly rolled the weed, put it in his mouth, and chewed on the end\nof it. Then he made slow answer, halting between sentences, his eyes\nslanting toward Blodgett to gather the effect of his words:\n\n\"I know all about 'em. I used to be in the bee business. Drove a swarm\nof bees across the plains in the dead of winter once. And never lost a\nbee. Got stung twice.\"\n\nThe sheriff jumped to his feet and directed a scornful glance Bill's way\nas he straightened his coat about his shoulders, twisted his belt, and\nstarted for the door, taking his chair and putting it in its place\nagainst the wall on his way. \"I got enough. I'm going outside.\"\n\nHammond, who had been busy going over the register all this while, now\ncame from behind the desk and walked toward Bill. \"Now look here, Mr.\nJones--\"\n\n\"Won't do no good fer you to talk,\" Bill interrupted him, but did not\neven glance up, remaining seated in the middle of the lobby. \"I ain't\ngoin' to sign nothin'--understand that,\" he said, not ungently.\n\nHammond planted himself squarely in front of Bill, setting his doubled\nfists on his hips. \"Well, if you don't,\" he snarled in a loud voice,\n\"you'll find yourself without a home. You understand that--if you're not\ntoo drunk.\" He delivered the last remark with a sneer that was almost a\nbark.\n\n\"Do you think I'm drunk?\" Bill went close to Hammond, his head thrown\nback the better to look into his opponent's shifting eyes.\n\nBut Hammond made him no answer, for just then Mrs. Jones, dressed in an\nevening gown of the latest cut, appeared on the stairs leading from the\nCalifornia side and walked self-consciously down on the arm of Thomas.\n\nAt first Bill did not recognize her. He thought it was some one of the\nboarders, who often wore evening dress for dinner. He hurried toward the\nNevada desk, asking, as his eyes began at Mrs. Jones's feet incased in\nshining silver slippers and wandered slowly up the folds of handsome\nyellow brocade to the wide expanse of bare neck and shoulder, \"Do you\nwant your key?\"\n\nMrs. Jones blushed, and the tears sprang to her eyes, as she wrapped the\nlace scarf flung over her shoulders closer across her bosom. Turning\ntoward Bill, she did not answer him, but took up the pen and pointed to\nthe paper which Hammond had placed on the desk, ready for them both to\nsign.\n\nBy this time Bill's glance had reached her face. For a moment he stared\nin astonishment. Then he gave a gasp and stood back, his arms limp at\nhis sides. \"Mother, 'tain't you?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Yes, it's me,\" Mrs. Jones replied, angrily, as she gulped to keep back\nthe tears which were forcing themselves to the surface, part in timidity\nand part in rage at her spouse, who she thought was making fun of her.\n\nBill straightened himself and, with a droll nod of his head, replied to\nHammond, \"You're right, I'm drunk.\"\n\nThomas stifled the smile that rose to his lips in spite of himself. He\nwas standing on the other side of Mrs. Jones. Now he came around and\nstood in front of Bill. \"Don't you approve, Lightnin'?\" he asked,\npleasantly. \"She's dressed in the height of fashion.\"\n\n\"Looks higher 'n that to me,\" Bill drawled, as his eyes twinkled at the\neight inches of bare ankle between Mrs. Jones's skirt edge and her\nsilver pumps.\n\nMrs. Jones, with an insulted toss of her head, dropped the pen with\nwhich she had signed the paper and hurried across the lobby to the\ndining-room door. She was crying, but Bill did not see her tears. His\neyes were still fastened upon her ankles. \"The mosquitoes 'll give you\nhell in that this summer,\" he called out as she slammed the door behind\nher.\n\nThomas shrugged his shoulders and smiled indulgently. He had made up his\nmind to leave matters entirely in Hammond's hands now; so he went up the\nCalifornia stairs, calling out to Bill, \"You'll get yourself disliked\naround here, if you don't look out.\"\n\n\"So'll you,\" Bill called back as he shambled to the same stairway.\n\nBut he got no farther than the first step. Hammond laid a detaining hand\non his arm, pulling him around in front of him. \"See here, Jones,\" he\nsaid, harshly, \"I've taken over the management of this place and I don't\npropose to stand any more nonsense from you, and unless you do as your\nwife tells you to, sign this deed, I'll kick you out.\"\n\nBill pulled himself loose from Hammond and stood facing him, a defiant\ngrin antagonizing Hammond to greater fury. \"No, you won't!\" Bill\nlaughed, never flinching in the half-open eyes with which he held\nHammond's eyes.\n\n\"What's the reason I won't?\" Hammond asked, making a threatening move.\n\nStill Bill remained unmoved. \"'Cause you talk too much about it.\"\n\nHammond stood and looked in fury at Bill. But he knew that any harsh\ntreatment on his part might spoil the whole game, which he now felt to\nbe near an end, which meant victory for his plans, so he smothered his\ndesire to lay hands on the old man, and with sudden impulse, born of a\ndesire to end the discussion, he hurried up-stairs to his room, calling\nback, \"You'll see whether I will or not.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nWhen Bill was once more alone he meandered slowly to the Nevada desk and\nleaned against it, looking abstractedly toward the veranda. Outside, the\nmoon was shining in long shafts of silver light through the branches of\nthe tall cedars. Beyond the lake lay, itself a moon of silver on the\nfloor of the valley. He could hear the hoot of a hundred billy owls.\nUnthinkingly he went to the door and stood there, sniffing at the\nfragrance of the pines. Then he went back to the desk again.\n\nAs Mrs. Jones had closed the dining-room door behind her, he had seen\nthat she was crying. Her tears had acted like a knife on his obstinacy.\nIf there was one method of bringing Bill to a realization of his\nshortcomings, it was the knowledge that he had brought his wife to\ntears. No matter what the occasion, through the years of his many\nomissions, he had never failed to awaken to a sense of duty at the\nslightest hint of a sob on her part. And now remorse was gnawing heavily\nat his heart. He knew that she was sorely tried by his laziness. He knew\nthat ever since she had come from the city she had longed for some of\nthe luxuries which she had tasted for the first and only time in those\nfew brief days when Thomas had given her a bit of every woman's\nparadise. And as he looked out he wondered in his slow, but none the\nless logical, way what it mattered, after all, if the place did go, just\nso long as mother was happy. To be sure, the place was worth much more\nthan Hammond was willing to pay them. But it was enough for their humble\nneeds. From the door beyond he could hear the sound of her sobs. He went\nhalf-way across the room. \"Yes,\" he reasoned with himself, \"after all,\nthe property is hers. I gave her my part of it to do as she pleased\nwith.\" And a sudden resolve to do her will possessed him.\n\nBut as he reached the middle of the lobby he heard some one on tiptoe\nbehind him. He turned to see Marvin, crouched down by the desk, so that\nany one coming from up-stairs could not see him.\n\n\"'Sh!\" Bill put up a warning hand. \"Blodgett's outside there some\nplace.\"\n\n\"He's snoring in his buggy,\" Marvin whispered back, with a half-smile.\n\"Bill,\" he added, quickly, \"I've been outside and I've heard every word\nthey've been saying to you. I haven't time to tell you all I want to\njust now. Promise me again that you won't sign that deed until you've\ntalked further with me about it.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SIGN THE DEED.\" ... BILL HESITATED]\n\nBill hesitated. \"Well, mother wants to awful bad,\" he answered, slowly.\n\nFrom the dining-room voices could be heard. \"Ye'd better get out,\" said\nBill.\n\n\"Not until you promise,\" persisted Marvin.\n\nBill wavered an instant. He wanted mother to be happy, and yet, another\nday did not make so much difference--especially when Marvin was in\ndanger. The door in back of him swung open. Leaning quickly down to\nMarvin, as the latter crept toward the outer door, he whispered: \"All\nright. I promise.\"\n\nMrs. Jones walked into the room with a swagger, half of indignation,\nhalf of sorrow. She was still wiping the tears from her eyes. The deed\nand the pen were in her hand.\n\nBill went to her, placing an affectionate hand on her bare arm. \"Mother,\nain't you cold?\" He could not resist another tilt at her unusual\ncostume.\n\n\"No.\" She stamped her foot at him, withdrawing her arm from his hand.\n\"I'm hot all over at you, insulting me before those gentlemen.\" Hurrying\nto the California desk, she buried her head on her crossed arms and\nbegan to cry. \"Makin' fun of me,\" she sobbed, \"because I try to look\npresentable for once in my life.\"\n\nFollowing her to the desk, Bill patted her gently on the back. \"It's\ngettin' late, mother,\" he coaxed. \"You're tired and you've been working\nhard. You're all tuckered out. Now you go up-stairs and put on some\nclothes and go to bed.\"\n\nMrs. Jones shook him from her and went to the other desk, where she\nstood facing him, her face red and swollen from her tears. \"Oh!\" she\nwrung her hands as she looked at him with blazing eyes. \"You ought to be\nashamed of yourself with the gentlemen here to buy the place and you\naround the office drinking liquor.\"\n\n\"No, I ain't.\" Bill answered her outburst mildly, backing away from her\nlest she should discover the flask in his back pocket.\n\nHe was too late. Her eye, accustomed to just such investigations, had\ndetected the lines of the flask as it protruded from his back pocket.\nTaking hold of him, she put her hand in his pocket and produced the\nflask, holding it, half empty, to the light.\n\n\"That belongs to Mr. Harper,\" was Bill's ready excuse, given in the\nmonotone which invariably masked a world of guilt. Seeing the doubt in\nhis wife's eye, he added, \"You can go up-stairs and ask him, if you\ndon't believe it.\"\n\nMrs. Jones did not reply to his last remark. Instead of which she went\nback to the California desk, where she set down the flask, taking up the\ndeed and holding it out to him. \"Now, Bill,\" she said, in a coaxing\nvoice, \"I want you to put your name to this paper.\" She smiled kindly\nupon him for the first time in many hours.\n\nBill wavered before her smile. It was difficult for him to withstand it,\nespecially as he knew how sorely he had tried her. But a promise was a\npromise with Bill, and his one pride was that he had kept intact through\nall the years of his digressions this one principle--he never broke his\nword. He had told Marvin he would not sign the deed without consulting\nhim further, so he turned his eyes from his wife's face and answered, in\na low voice, \"I can't, mother.\"\n\n\"What's the reason you can't?\" Mrs. Jones planted herself in front of\nhim, determined that he should not evade her this time.\n\n\"Because I promised my lawyer I wouldn't,\" he answered, his head turned\naway from her.\n\nMrs. Jones took him by the arm and swung him into line with her gaze.\n\"Now see here, Bill,\" she snapped, \"I've been working my fingers to the\nbone and I'm entitled to a rest and you sha'n't stop my having it. Mr.\nThomas is going to take Millie and me to the city to live. If you sign\nthat you can come with us. If you don't you've got to look out for\nyourself for a while.\"\n\nBill had not paid much heed to Hammond's threat delivered a few minutes\nback. But now something in his wife's tone brought it, recurrent, to his\nmind. He wondered if, after all, there was some truth behind it.\n\nPausing to gather his points together, Bill nodded toward the stairs.\n\"Mother, that fellow, Hammond, said he'd throw me out. Do you want me to\nget out? Is that what you mean?\"\n\nIt was not what Mrs. Jones had meant at all. But the events of the day\nhad strained her nerves to breaking-point. Since daylight Thomas and\nHammond had been after her to force Bill to do as she wished him to. To\ntheir suggestions that she teach him a lesson by leaving him for a while\nshe had turned a deaf ear. But now they came surging back and, in answer\nto her call for a method of persuasion, clamored for recognition. Before\nshe had time to stifle them they had their way. \"I mean just that,\nBill.\" There was silence as she thrust the words from her mouth. Bill\nstood still, gazing steadily at her.\n\nShe lowered her lids.\n\nThen he came closer and looked up under her eyes, in the hope that he\nwould find a relenting gleam there. But she turned away from him.\n\n\"All right, mother--I'll go.\"\n\nWithout another word he turned and walked toward the door. Mrs. Jones\ntook a quick step forward, then paused. \"Where'll you go?\" she asked,\nhalf in surprise, half in defiance, for she had not believed that he\nwould accept her challenge.\n\n\"Oh, 'most anywhere,\" he said, gaily, forcing a whistle, though his lips\nquivered. \"I'll be all right, mother.\"\n\nHis wife stepped forward again, extending a staying hand, but her\nresentment had her in its grip. Her hand fell back to her side.\n\n\"Well,\" she called out to him as suddenly she turned from him and\nhurried up the stairs, \"I mean every word I've said! It's one thing or\nthe other! Either you make up your mind to sign this,\" and she tapped\nthe paper in her hand, \"or I'm through with you!\" Without a backward\nglance--fearing, perhaps, that she might weaken--she disappeared along\nthe upper hallway.\n\nBill took his hand from the door and came slowly back into the room. He\nstrolled to the California desk, pushed back his old hat, and stood\nthere with his hands in his pockets, thoughtfully. Of a sudden his\nabsent eyes lighted on the flask resting on the desk, where Mrs. Jones\nhad put it down. Bill stroked his stubbled chin and gazed at the flask.\nIt seemed to suggest an idea to him. Satisfying himself that there was\nno one around at the moment, he strolled to the door, poked his head\nout, and gave a peculiar whistle; then he walked back to the desk and\nleaned against it, waiting.\n\nIn a few minutes Zeb's unkempt visage silently framed itself in the\nsoftly opened door. Lightnin' jerked his head as a sign to enter.\nStealthily, with many a wary glance to right and left, his disreputable\npartner of the past eased himself across the lobby and stood before\nBill, childlike, trustful inquiry in his eyes.\n\n\"What's the idee, Lightnin'?\" he rumbled, puffing at the frayed remains\nof a cigar.\n\nWith a gesture of calm triumph Bill pointed to the flask on the desk.\n\n\"I said I had it, Zeb,\" he remarked, in the tone one uses when\nconfronting and confounding a skeptic with ocular proof, \"an' there it\nis!\"\n\n\"Why, so it be!\" said Zeb, reaching out for the prize.\n\nBut Lightnin' stopped him. \"Hold on a minute, partner. The evidence\nain't to be absorbed just yet. In fact, brother, we better keep it\nintact for future use, 'cause you're goin' on a long journey, Zeb. You\nan' me is goin' to hit the trail again, old-timer!\"\n\n\"Gosh! You mean it, Lightnin'?\" Zeb showed almost human delight and\nanticipation. \"But for why? You had a row with your old woman?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Bill replied. \"Can't call it that, exactly. You needn't worry\nthem brains o' yours about why we're goin', Zeb. It's just that I got a\nnotion to teach some people 'round here a lesson, an'--an' maybe I can\nbring poor mother to her senses,\" he added, gently.\n\n\"When we goin'?\" Zeb questioned, his eyes on the flask.\n\n\"Right away--this here minute, in fact,\" said Bill.\n\nZeb looked at him dazedly. \"Just as we is? Where 're we hittin' fer?\"\n\n\"I ain't telling that just yet,\" said Bill, slowly. \"Where we are goin'\nis a secret.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zeb answered, with a nod of wisdom. \"I--see. You ain't tellin' 'em\nyou be goin'--not even your old woman, eh?\"\n\n\"Them brains o' yours is pickin' up a bit, ain't they, Zeb?\" Bill\ncommented, with encouraging approval. \"Well, you hit it, all right!\nNope, we ain't tellin' nobody. We're goin' to kinder disappear\ncompletely for a pretty good space. Mother ain't to be able to locate me\na-tall. There's some others as 'll likely find out, but I ain't worryin'\nabout them--they want to get rid o' me, an' they ain't likely to exhaust\nthemselves any tryin' to find me. I got a object, Zeb. It ain't none o'\nyour business what that object is--by which I merely mean to say,\nold-timer, that you wouldn't have no particular interest in it. Come\non--let's get out now, afore they begins to gather 'round me again!\"\n\nPicking up the flask and sliding it into his coat pocket, Lightnin'\nwalked away toward the door. Nodding wisely, Zeb followed, eyes\nhopefully on the pleasant bulge in his old partner's coat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\"Well!\" Millie, appearing with a tray of late supper to take up-stairs\nto one of the guests' rooms along about ten o'clock that evening, almost\nran into Marvin, who had returned to the hotel in the hope of seeing\nBill and giving him the full reason for his not being a party to the\nsale of the place. The lights in the lobby were turned low and he had\nmanaged to evade the sheriff, who was sitting in his buck-board outside,\nwaiting for Lemuel Townsend, who was to return to Reno with him.\n\nMillie's exclamation, because of her surprise in seeing Marvin again,\nescaped her in pleasant tones, but her memory asserted itself and the\nsmile rapidly faded from her face and she gave a haughty toss of her\nhead, saying, as he stepped in front of her when she started for the\nstairs, \"Will you please let me pass?\"\n\nBut Marvin had wanted to see her quite as much as he did Bill, the\nimpression she had given him of her liking for Thomas having cut deeper\nthan the events of the earlier part of the day had given him time to\nrealize. Ignoring her request, he removed his hat and said, as he\nsearched her eyes for some play of the old light that had often\ngladdened his heart in the days when they were together in Thomas's\noffice in San Francisco, \"I suppose you are surprised to find me here\nstill?\"\n\nMillie swayed toward the Nevada desk, depositing her tray upon it. She\nfaced him, her eyes flashing, her cheeks flushed. Her first impulse was\nnot to answer him. She could not understand his interference in the\nmatter of the deed. Neither did she believe one word he had uttered\nagainst Hammond and Thomas. On the contrary, Thomas's apparent interest\nin her and her mother and his constant flattery and attentions had\nattained their end. She believed in him implicitly and therefore had\ngiven credence to every word he had said against Marvin. Nevertheless,\nthe charge that he was not honest could not quite overcome the\nquickening of her interest which had manifested itself lately in a heart\nthat ran far ahead of itself at his approach.\n\nAfter a silence in which she stared at him steadily, his eyes answering\nhers with an unflinching candor mixed with a vague wistfulness, she\nanswered him. \"I don't think anything you could do would surprise me,\nafter all that has happened to-day and all that I've been told about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Millie!\" Marvin awkwardly rolled his hat in his hands, while his speech\nfaltered. \"I've been waiting around here now for two hours in the hope\nthat I could explain to you why I wanted to stop that sale. And I cannot\nbear to have you believe that I am a thief and--\"\n\nMillie was touched by his attitude. Her hand left her hip and started\ntoward his arm in friendly contact. But again returned the whole picture\nof the afternoon's events and she coolly turned from him and went to\ntake up her tray again.\n\n\"Will you please let me pass?\" she asked a second time, as he tried to\nprevail upon her by taking the tray from her and setting it down again.\n\"I wish to have nothing to say to you. I do not believe your excuses.\nMr. Thomas is the best friend I have in the world. I won't listen to a\nword against him, and I am sure he is too fine a gentleman to say\nanything about any one unless he were sure that it was true.\" As she\ncame to the last words she swallowed to keep back the tears, for\nalthough they were uttered in perfect faith, her words burned into her\nown heart with as much bitterness as they were directed toward Marvin.\n\nHe was too filled with his mission and too sure that Millie's interest\nin him was gone to notice the catch in her voice or to attribute it to\nany sense of affection for him, had he noticed it. He took her hands in\nhis and shook them gently in an endeavor to get her to look into his\neyes again. \"Millie, please listen to me! I know what I'm talking about\nwhen I say that Mrs. Jones is being cheated and robbed--\"\n\nShe broke away from him, and stood glaring at him, as she stamped her\nfoot. \"Don't you dare to say another word about Raymond Thomas to me!\nAnyway, it is none of your business if he is cheating us!\"\n\n\"Millie, Millie.\" Marvin's voice was full of pleading as he persisted,\ngoing close to her again and shaking his head sadly. \"Why do you allow\nyourself to be taken in this way? Don't you know that the only reason I\nam concerned is because I care--Oh, well.\" He turned away with a sigh\nand went over to the Nevada desk and took up the tray. \"I won't say any\nmore. Will you let me carry the tray up-stairs for you? I'll go then,\nand you won't be bothered with me any more.\"\n\nThe glare in her eyes melted and she made a gesture as if she would\ncall him to her side again. But she could not forget so easily, and she\nsaid, without turning to look at him, in tones less sharp, \"Why didn't\nyou tell me before that you suspected him?\"\n\n\"How could I? You told me how much you thought of Raymond Thomas. I\nhadn't realized that before--\" He put the tray down and came to her side\nonce more.\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" Millie was again angered, \"that I told you I loved\nMr. Thomas?\"\n\n\"That's what I understood,\" Marvin replied.\n\nThe two stood there, Millie glancing at him in contempt, while his whole\nheart went out to her from his eyes.\n\nHe was the first to break the silence. Almost touching her hand with\nhis, he said, softly, \"You mean you don't love him?\"\n\nMillie snatched her hand away and went back to the desk. \"You're always\nwrong! I told you he was my best friend and he is. I never said I loved\nhim.\"\n\nIf Marvin had not been attracted by the arabesque of the faded\nrose-garlanded rug at that moment, he would have found some solace in\nthe lowered lids and half-smile which Millie vouchsafed him. But he did\nnot see it. Slowly he followed her back to the desk, this time standing\naside as she made her way toward the stairs. \"Well, say it now--I\nmean\"--he hesitated, embarrassed, then went on--\"I mean--say you don't\ncare for him. And then if you'll only give me time I'll find out what\ntheir game is.\"\n\nMillie stood at the newel-post, steadying the tray against it. Looking\ndown at him, the hard gleam returned to her eyes as she replied,\nemphatically: \"Oh, I don't want you to find out anything about it! I\nknow you're mistaken and you're not going to prevent mother's selling\nthe place, because it's already sold. As soon as daddy's name is signed\nto it we get the money.\"\n\n\"Well, you sha'n't have that, Millie.\" Marvin swung his hat against the\npost without looking up at her. Through the window he traced the\nmoonbeams as they filtered through the pines outside. Above the hoot of\nan owl the swish of the lake came in to them. They both stood there,\ngazing out to where so few weeks ago they had walked in the happiness of\nan unconscious awakening.\n\nIt was within Millie's heart to relax as she saw him sigh. From above\njust then came the sound of Mrs. Jones's voice. It brought back her\nconcern for the tired woman above-stairs. With it returned her anger at\nMarvin. \"You're trying to prevent this sale just to hurt Mr. Thomas in\nmy eyes!\" she snapped.\n\nHe turned and met her with the question, \"Thomas told you that, didn't\nhe?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Just the same, Millie,\" and here Marvin mounted the step and stood\nclose to her as he looked squarely in her eyes, \"I'll never let Bill\nsign that deed. Some day you'll thank me for it.\"\n\nThis was more than her patience could stand. In her anger she almost\ndropped the tray, but she managed to hold it taut against the balustrade\nas she frowned at him and stamped her foot.\n\n\"Thank you?\" she asked, in no gentle voice. \"I shall always hate and\ndespise you for it. Always! I hope I shall never see you again, and if I\ndo I shall never notice you--nor speak to you the longest day I live!\"\nExhausted with her temper, she turned to mount the stairs, when she\nlooked out toward the veranda and saw a figure slowly and stealthily\ncoming up the steps. She recognized it at once and shrieked out, just as\nthe sheriff entered the door, \"John, look out!\"\n\nBut Marvin had been watching her, and the fear in her eyes as she saw\nBlodgett had been warning enough for him. He gave three quick skips to\nthe other side of the lobby, making mock obeisance toward her, laughter\nin his voice because of her betrayal of her solicitude in spite of all\nthat she had said.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Buckley,\" he called as he went up the California stairs\nto the hall above, just as the sheriff had reached out for him, \"thank\nyou, Miss Buckley! I shall be grateful to you--always!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nBill's disappearance brought quick changes to the little hotel at\nCalivada. His ready acceptance of Mrs. Jones's alternative was a\ncomplete surprise, and it was several days before she and Millie\nrealized that he had taken her at her word. Even then they thought he\nhad gone off on one of his temporary jaunts in the hills. When the days\ngrew into a fortnight and he did not return they instituted a search\namong the near-by villages and mining-camps. Everett Hammond and Raymond\nThomas were solicitous aids in the inquiry, not for the two women they\nwere defrauding, nor because they felt any concern for Bill's welfare.\nRather was their full attention turned toward securing a deed which the\nPacific Railroad would consider law-proof. Had the property been\nentirely within the state of Nevada, Bill's signature would not have\nbeen imperative, but the California laws regarding the sale of property\nwere evadable by numerous small technicalities, and shrewd counsel\ndemanded that bona-fide deeds must appear as freewill transfers from\nboth the husband and wife. It was for this reason that Bill's\ndisappearance was a matter of deep satisfaction to both Hammond and\nThomas. They had begun to despair of his putting his name to the deed.\nNow, should he not return within six months, they evolved a new scheme\nand one which would be law-proof if it could be carried through.\n\nIf Mrs. Jones could be persuaded into a divorce, and the decree obtained\nwith full rights to the property, the deed would be legal without Bill's\nname. It was for this reason that Hammond and Thomas put themselves at\nMrs. Jones's service and did everything in their power to discover\nBill's whereabouts. It was several weeks before they traced him to\nSacramento and from there to the veterans' home at Yountville. By this\ntime Mrs. Jones was quite beside herself, for, in spite of Bill's\nshiftlessness, which was quite enough to wear away the patience of the\naverage woman, she felt a deep affection for the generous-hearted,\nwhimsical old creature and his companionship through fifteen years, and\nat a time when her father's death had left her desolate had relieved the\nmonotony of a life which had had little else but hard work. Millie, too,\nmissed her foster-father, whose frequent sallies kept humor alive when\nwork and poverty pressed hard. In reverent and grateful memory she held\nthe thought of his care for her when she had been left a waif by her own\nfather's death. And so, together, Millie and Mrs. Jones pressed Thomas\nfor news of Bill.\n\nHe knew that if they learned his whereabouts they would not rest until\nthey had brought him home again. Mrs. Jones's persistent melancholy\nsince Bill's departure told Thomas that in order to get Bill back, the\ndeed itself would be abrogated by her, should that be one of his\nconditions of return. Therefore both he and Hammond determined that they\nwould not let the two women know of Bill's whereabouts. Instead, they\nsaid they had traced him as far as Placerville, known to old-timers as\nthe Hangtown of the gold days, and that from there he had taken the\ntrail up over the Georgetown Divide, where he said he was going to find\nwork in the mines. Search throughout the entire district, Hammond and\nThomas informed her, had failed to locate him, and they assured her and\nMillie that inquiry should be kept up until he was found.\n\nWinter came, bringing with it no news from Bill, and Mrs. Jones settled\ninto a melancholy resignation wherein she seldom smiled and where she\nspent most of her time in the rocking-chair by the front window, gazing\ndown the path up which Bill had usually zigzagged his recalcitrant way.\nThomas was quick to recognize her symptoms and he resolved upon his\nmaster-stroke.\n\nOne day toward the end of March when a heavy storm had blown up from the\nlake and the entire forest was torn and twisted by a wind in high and\nangry mood, Mrs. Jones sat crying in front of the window, wondering\nwhere Bill was and beset with the fear that some place beyond the ridge\nin that vast ocean of mountain billows Bill might be homeless and cold\nand without food. A sudden gust shook the hillside, bringing down a\ngrizzled pine that had stood close to the house. The crash of its\nfalling resounded down the slope and Mrs. Jones, keyed to high pitch by\nher vigil of three months, was brought to a sudden burst of despair just\nas Thomas, who had come to Calivada to superintend the wiring of the\nhouse which was now to be put on modern basis, came down the stairs. It\nwas his chance and he took it.\n\n\"Mrs. Jones!\" There was a surcharge of pity in his voice as he glided\nacross the room and stood over her chair, placing a gentle hand upon\nher shoulder. \"I hate to see you upset. We've done everything in our\npower to find Mr. Jones and we will leave no stone unturned until we\nsucceed. In the mean time you must think of yourself and Millie.\"\n\n\"It was thinking of myself and Millie that drove him out of his home.\"\nMrs. Jones buried her head on her hand and leaned against the\nwindow-sill. The wind, with renewed shock, beat the sleet against the\nwindow-pane. \"He may be out this minute wandering the hills with no\nplace to go,\" she sobbed, \"and he ain't young no more, neither.\n\n\"Of course, I thought all along,\" she went on, \"that by selling the\nplace I could take care of him in his old age, and now he ain't here and\nthe place can't be sold.\"\n\n\"The place can be sold, Mrs. Jones, and you will then have enough money\nto institute a real search for Mr. Jones.\" Thomas's emphasis of the\npossibility of a sale without Bill's signature relaxed Mrs. Jones's mood\nand she sat up straight in her chair, lifting questioning eyes toward\nhim.\n\n\"There is a way.\" He answered her unspoken inquiry with calm\ndeliberation, while he scrutinized her for the least sign of\nencouragement or of antagonism as his plan unfolded. \"It is a difficult\nway and one which you may balk at pursuing, but it will justify itself\nin the end.\"\n\n\"Oh, what is it, Mr. Thomas?\" Mrs. Jones's brown eyes widened and hope\nreturned to them as she smoothed out an imaginary wrinkle in her gingham\napron and folded her arms across her waist, rocking expectantly back and\nforth. \"I'd do 'most anything if I thought it'd bring Bill back,\" she\nexclaimed, raising her voice to an enthusiastic pitch.\n\nThomas brought an arm-chair from the center-table and sat down beside\nher. Clasping his hands, he leaned forward, \"You can get a divorce,\nand--\"\n\n\"Oh, I could never do that!\" Mrs. Jones protested and stopped rocking as\nshe lifted up her hands in horror. \"He 'ain't never done anything; and\nbesides--\"\n\n\"That's not the question.\" Thomas was quick to interrupt her flow of\nexcuses. \"I know he has done nothing, Mrs. Jones. But as things stand at\npresent you have neither Bill nor the money for the place. You can't\ngive a clear title to the place while you are married to Mr. Jones\nunless it bears his signature. You have not the money to find him. A\ndivorce will straighten all this out. You can sell the place for enough\nmoney to find Bill. You can remarry him and you will both have a\ncomfortable old age.\"\n\n\"Oh!!!\" Mrs. Jones drew the word out with a long inflection of surprise,\nand she shook her head in the wisdom of a new light. \"I see what ye\nmean.\" After a moment's abstraction in which she pondered Thomas's\nsuggestion, she continued, \"Some way or 'nuther it don't seem straight\nby Bill.\"\n\n\"It's the only way I see to settle matters. But I sha'n't try to\npersuade you against your will, Mrs. Jones.\" Thomas brought to bear on\nthe situation his finest modulations, both in voice and manner, as he\nsat nonchalantly in his chair, one knee cocked over the other and his\nfoot swinging listlessly back and forth, portraying a personal\nindifference which Mrs. Jones's simple mind could not penetrate.\n\n\"It does seem a good way,\" she mused aloud, adding, in little spurts,\n\"but I guess--maybe--Well--I think I'll talk it over with Millie.\"\n\nMrs. Jones did talk it over with Millie. Also, she had several prolonged\ninterviews with Thomas on the subject, and three days later she put her\nname to the petition which asked for a divorce from Bill Jones without\nso much as giving the document a thorough reading. Whatever Thomas\nproposed was to her, by the very fact of its being his idea, a thing\nworthy to be done. Millie, being of the same turn of mind, aided her in\naccepting his decision. And it was only when the first publication of\nsummons appeared in the Reno papers that her heart sank at the words\nwhich characterized Bill as a drunkard and a man who was cruel to his\nwife--lies which Thomas justified as necessary to strengthen the one\ntruthful ground for the divorce--that of failure to provide. Even that\nMrs. Jones felt was beside the truth, for although Bill had never\nexerted himself needlessly, he had performed the chores, gone after the\nmail, made beds, and, by his gift to her on their marriage day of his\nthree hundred and twenty acres, which were far the better portion of the\nproperty, he had made some slight concession to his responsibilities.\nBill's digressions had been those of omission rather than those of\ncommission, and Mrs. Jones's misgivings were frequent during the three\nmonths that followed.\n\nIn the mean time, Thomas and Hammond were quick to inaugurate a new\nregime at the hotel. Mrs. Jones and Millie remained on in the capacity\nof guests, while a clerk and a housekeeper were brought from the city to\ntake over the management. Modern improvements and equipment soon turned\nit into a hostelry that verged on the fashionable. With the early spring\nfreshet augmenting the waterfall and the stream into a cataract whose\npotential horse-power did not escape Everett Hammond, he made a hurried\ntrip from San Francisco with an official of the Pacific Railroad and\nsucceeded in persuading the company to advance a comfortable sum of\nmoney for an option on the Jones property. Mrs. Jones and Millie,\nfretting under the suspense and without funds, were given a small amount\nto tide them over until the sale should be consummated, when they were\nto receive a large block of certificates in the Golden Gate Land\nCompany.\n\nAll would have been well with Thomas, who saw life spreading before him\nin a panorama of ease and elegance, had it not been for two\npeople--Lemuel Townsend and John Marvin. Lemuel Townsend had been placed\nby the November elections on the list of Superior Court judges, where he\nimmediately came into his own as presiding judge in the majority of\ndivorce cases in Reno. Thomas, unable to withstand the r\u00c3\u00b4le of popular\nand irresistible Beau Brummell among the prospective divorc\u00c3\u00a9es at the\nhotel, had run against Townsend's displeasure two days before the\nelection, when he had dared to play interloper in Lemuel Townsend's\nattentions to Mrs. Margaret Davis. With Townsend, it had been love at\nfirst sight. With Mrs. Davis it was something less, her only idea at\nthat time being a quick snatch at freedom and a hurried trip back to\nBroadway, where she hoped to sign up for the summer circuit. Lem\nTownsend did well enough to pass the time, and it was her own diversion\nrather than any feeling for him which bade her accept his attentions.\nThomas on frequent trips had scattered his flatteries between Millie and\nthe various divorc\u00c3\u00a9es. Mrs. Davis came in for her full share and several\ntimes there had been clashes between the two men, Thomas invariably\nstepping aside, but only after verbal skirmishes with Townsend.\n\nMarvin had not been seen in the neighborhood since a few days after Bill\nJones had disappeared. He had returned to his cabin, after having\nestablished himself in an office in San Francisco with the intention of\ntaking Bill back with him. During the days spent on the trails in search\nof the old man he had successfully evaded Sheriff Blodgett and had gone\nback to his office, where he had received a forwarded letter from Bill\nat the veterans' home at Yountville. He had taken one trip to the home\nwith the purpose of persuading Bill to return with him to the city. But\nwhen he saw how comfortable Bill was there in the hillside country,\nsurrounded by the old veterans who vied with one another in recounting\ntheir past prowess, he decided to let him alone until such time as he\ncould effect a reconciliation between Bill and Mrs. Jones.\n\nThis, he trusted, would be at the termination of the case brought\nagainst him by the Pacific Railroad to recover the timber which he had\nsold to Rodney Harper previous to the sale of his timber-land to the\nGolden Gate Land Company by Mrs. Marvin. Then, too, he hoped the way\nwould be made straight for him and Millie, although he had half lost\nhope under his realization of Thomas's superior eligibility.\n\nThese things, known to the latter, destroyed his composure and made the\nlapse between the filing of Mrs. Jones's divorce suit and the\ntermination of its three months' summons by publication, required by\nlaw, a period of anxiety. He knew that if Marvin were vindicated before\nMrs. Jones could secure her divorce his whole framework would collapse,\nas Millie and Mrs. Jones, straightforward as they were, would brook no\nhint of dishonesty on his part. Once discovered as unworthy of trust,\ntheir confidence in him would be broken and Marvin would be restored to\nfull standing, not only in Millie's affections, but in Mrs. Jones's\napproval.\n\nIn the latter part of March he took a hurried trip to Reno, where, in\nconference with Blodgett, who had never been able to forgive Marvin's\nevasion of arrest, maneuvers to have the two suits tried at the same\ntime sent him back to San Francisco rejoicing in the anticipation that\nhis days of discomfort would soon be over and he could return to his\nown world again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nMid-April came with its arabesquan days of sunlight and shadow and its\nfragile broidery of new leaf and timid blossom. It was as if its coming\nhad stirred anew the life in Reno's divorce colony. All winter the\ncourts had been dull, most of the men and women seeking divorces\narriving in the early fall and biding their time of six months by\nhibernating through the long, cold season. But now there was a renewed\nactivity in divorce circles. The court calendars were full and there was\na steady stream of gaily clad applicants making their way in and out of\nthe Washoe County court-house, going in with nervous, hasty, anxious\ntread and coming out with a gait which spoke of a new freedom and a\nsmile that bespoke life as once again worth living.\n\nIt was one morning just after the flux of spring divorces had begun that\nSheriff Blodgett stood looking over the calendar in Judge Lemuel\nTownsend's court-room. He scowled as he read the words announcing that\nthe first case was that of the Railroad Company versus John Marvin. He\npatted the warrant which still occupied the waiting list in his pocket.\nPlacing a chair close to the court-room door, he waited for the crowd to\nbegin to file in. He knew that he could not arrest a man in the\ncourt-room, but he intended to keep his eye on the corridor, and to that\nend had propped one of the doors open with a chair so that he could see\nclear to the swinging doors that led in from the street. If Marvin put\nin an appearance, he intended to arrest him at once. The thought gave\nhim satisfaction and he sat twirling his long, drooping mustache with\none hand and fondling the handcuffs in his coat pocket with the other.\nRevenge at last would play its part to-day, for, even if Marvin failed\nto appear and therefore balked him again, the railroad company would get\njudgment, anyway.\n\nIt was at this point in his reverie that Thomas entered the court-room,\ngreeting the sheriff with a genial, \"Oh, hello there, Blodgett! I guess\nour day's come.\"\n\nWith a patronizing pat on Blodgett's shoulder, Thomas passed and went to\nthe clerk, where he procured a list of the day's cases. He, too, nodded\nin satisfaction, as he saw that the Pacific Railroad case, in which he\nwas attorney, was to come up first. Running his finger down the line, he\nstopped at another close to the end, smiled again, and turned to the\nsheriff.\n\n\"The Marvin case is first,\" he observed.\n\nThe sheriff nodded and a frown slowly puckered his brow. He walked\nslowly up to Thomas, who stood at the clerk's desk just within the\nrailing. He hesitated, clearing his throat, and found the courage to\nask, with a slight timidity in his voice and manner, \"You ain't a-goin'\nto bring up the old story of my serving the warrant at Calivada, are\nyou?\"\n\nThomas laughed. \"No,\" he replied; \"I don't think I'll have to go into\nthat. But I will ask you about the time you went to Marvin's camp.\"\n\nBlodgett heaved his shoulders in relief, and, with hands in his pockets,\nwent back to his station at the door. \"That's all right!\" He exhaled a\nfull breath once again.\n\nThomas turned the leaves of the calendar, looked ahead for a day or two,\nwithout noticing much that he saw, then turned the leaves back again to\nthe day's list. He went to the court-room window and looked out upon the\nvalley that ran from Reno up toward the foothills. He sniffed the keen,\ncool air that was blown up to him. He stood contemplating the rushing\nwaters of the Truckee River below. After several minutes' thought he\nfaced Blodgett again.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you what time you were at Marvin's camp, for I want to\nshow he was taking down the timber,\" he announced.\n\n\"I didn't get out where the timber was,\" the sheriff replied.\n\n\"But you know he had a gang of lumbermen there?\" In Thomas's tone and in\nthe gleam on his cold, blue eyes the sheriff caught the message of\npersuasion.\n\n\"Oh, sure.\" He nodded with the air of a man who understood what was\nwanted of him.\n\n\"And they drove you off by force?\"\n\nBlodgett nodded again.\n\n\"And you remember the date?\"\n\n\"I guess I won't fergit it.\" There was emphasis in Blodgett's answer and\nhe arose impatiently from his chair and stood, his arms akimbo, peering\ndown the corridor. \"Do you think Marvin'll be here to-day?\" This time he\nwas interlocutor. \"I got a notion he won't,\" he added, fathering his\ndisappointment by admitting the possibility of frustration in the one\ndesire that had held him ever since Marvin had foiled him by the\ntechnicality of the state boundary-line. He was bound, however, that\nthere should be no opportunity for escape this time.\n\n\"I don't care whether he turns up or not,\" Thomas answered, going to the\nlawyers' table, opening his brief-case, and setting them out before him\nas he swung gracefully into a chair. \"The case is a cinch,\" he\nemphasized, with a grin that found reflection in Blodgett's eyes.\n\nWith a warning to the clerk to keep an eye on things until he should\nreturn, Blodgett left the court-room and swaggered up the corridor,\nstopping at the door of the other rooms and taking a frowning survey of\nthe occupants, hoping that Marvin had entered one of them by mistake. If\nJohn Marvin was in Reno he was not going to escape arrest this day. With\nthis comforting conclusion in mind, he took up his stand just outside of\nthe court-house door at the top of the steps.\n\nIn the mean time Everett Hammond, escorting Mrs. Jones and Millie\nBuckley, entered Judge Townsend's court-room and were greeted effusively\nby Thomas.\n\n\"Oh, good morning!\" He bowed low over Mrs. Jones's hand, which he held\nin his. \"I'm glad to see you.\" Staring at Millie, who looked very\nfetching in a trim blue serge tailor suit, he beamed. \"How fine you look\nthis morning; quite irresistible, I assure you!\"\n\nMillie blushed and looked with frightened glance from the judge's bench\nto the lawyers' table, and from there to the witness-stand and back\ntoward the door, for all the world as if she were contemplating a rapid\nescape. She took a deep breath. \"I don't feel irresistible,\" she said.\n\"I feel just as if I wanted to cry and run away.\" She pouted at Thomas,\nwith entreaty in her pretty eyes.\n\nThomas laughed, put his hand on her arm in deprecation, and shrugged her\nfears away. \"Oh, the trial won't amount to anything, little lady. What\ndo you say to that, Mrs. Jones?\"\n\nThe older woman's brown eyes were staring straight ahead, as if she saw\na real horror and was without power to controvert it. \"All I can say,\"\nshe replied, in a high-pitched, high-strung voice, \"is that I'm here.\"\nShe waited for a moment, casting furtive glances at Hammond and Thomas,\nwho stood one on each side of her. Having found the courage to assert\nherself, she burst out, \"And I wish I wasn't!\"\n\n\"Now, now, Mrs. Jones!\" There was banter in Hammond's voice, but there\nwas concern in the wise direction of his eyes toward Thomas. \"You're a\nmighty brave woman and I know you're going through with this, for it\nmeans that you'll be in a much better position to find your husband and\nlook out for your old age after you get the money for the place.\"\n\nMrs. Jones made no response, but cast anxious eyes about the room, and\nshe folded her hands in resignation across her ample waist-line.\n\n\"It's like going to the dentist. The worst part is making up your mind\nto it.\" Thomas leaned over Mrs. Jones and smiled his most engaging\nsmile. He received no answer to it, so he turned to Millie, who stood at\nthe other side of him.\n\nBefore he could speak, the girl rid herself of the question that had\nbeen ever present in her mind now for six months, and one which she had\nnever failed to ask him every time she saw him or wrote to him.\n\n\"Have you heard anything of daddy?\"\n\nThomas's smile disappeared. He left the little group of four in the\nmiddle of the space inside of the rails and sat down again at the table,\nannoyance in the slump with which he threw himself into his chair. \"No,\nwe haven't been able to locate him.\" He would have been sullen had he\ndared, but his game was too nearly played and he did not wish to foozle\nat the last, so he controlled his mood and forced a smile as he thought\nof a method of getting away from his client's importunity for awhile.\n\n\"It must be distasteful for you two women to remain in here any longer\nthan possible,\" he said, rising from his chair again and pointing to a\ndoor at one side of the court-room. \"Lennon,\" he called to the clerk,\n\"my clients can wait in there, can't they?\"\n\nThe clerk acquiescing, he and Hammond courteously escorted Mrs. Jones\nand Millie to the door and showed them into a small room which had been\nfitted up for hysterical women overcome with the proceeding in their\ncases, or for those who, like Mrs. Jones and Millie, wished to avoid the\nembarrassment of a long wait in the court-room.\n\nAs the two women went through the door, Thomas turned to Hammond and\nadvised, in a low voice: \"You better go, too, Hammond. Keep them\ncheered up.\"\n\nWith bad grace in his shrug and in his eyes, he followed Thomas's\nsuggestion, first murmuring in his partner's ear: \"I'll be damn glad\nwhen this day is over. All I've been doing this last week is to keep\nthese darned women from backing out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nBy this time the court-room was filling up with its usual motley crowd\nof interested parties and spectators. There were the seekers after\nfreedom, a heterogeneous collection of them, in all sorts and conditions\nof clothes, of all ages and of all kinds of faces and figures. There\nwere the women from the millionaire colonies of the East, chic, sleek,\nand composed. They retired into a far corner with their attorneys,\nconferring in low tones, or else sitting, apparently unperturbed, while\nwaiting for their cases to be called. There were always the adventuress\ntypes, chic, too, but made up with an eye to future conquest, their\nskirts always tighter or wider or shorter or longer than the style\ndecreed, their hair a little more so-so, their lips redder, their cheeks\nrosier, and their faces whiter than their more conservative sisters of a\nnarrower way. There were tired women from far states not allowing\ndivorces for cruelty or desertion. They sat, in nondescript clothes,\nmost of them, with eyes heavy-lidded, as if they were too weary to care\nmuch what happened to them. There were gay young creatures, dancers and\nsmall-time vaudeville actresses, who refused to take life seriously and\nwho availed themselves of a dull season to make themselves free for\nanother venture. There was a sprinkling of men, one of them a lumber\nmagnate from an Eastern state, another a noted cabaret entertainer. They\nsat around, restlessly out of place, but at the same time taking an\ninterest in those about them.\n\nSupplementing these were the spectators. Among them were tourists who\ncame to Reno for the express purpose of attending the divorce trials.\nInquisitive folk, regular residents of the town, dropped in to pass an\nhour's time and to gather gossip for the afternoon tea-table.\nClub-women, anxious to find food for reform, took up their seats close\nto the railing, determined that no word of the testimony or proceedings\nshould escape them. And there were the usual hangers-on, old men and\nwomen with nothing to do, who found entertainment in listening to the\nhuman dramas unfolded from the witness-stand.\n\nRaymond Thomas, before taking his seat at the lawyers' table, took a\ncomprehensive view of his audience. Lifting the skirt of his frock-coat,\nhe sat down, viewing the world and himself complacently. He heard the\ncourt-room door swing to, and, looking up, he saw the sheriff coming\ntoward him with Mrs. Margaret Davis by his side.\n\nMrs. Davis's six months' residence in Nevada had been established and\nshe had come over from Calivada, where she had become quite one of the\nJones family, to get her decree. She had expected to meet Mrs. Jones at\nthe Riverside Hotel, but she had been late and had hurried over, her\neffort flushing her cheeks even beyond the heavy coat of peach-bloom\nwith which she hid the natural roses of her cheeks. She had been\nscurrying like a chicken around the corridors when she had caught sight\nof Sheriff Blodgett and importuned him to see her safely to a seat in\nthe court-room.\n\nAs soon as she saw Thomas she dismissed the sheriff summarily, while\nThomas arose and went forward, opening the swinging gates that admitted\nthe lawyers and witnesses behind the railing. Their greeting was\neffusive, and Thomas held Mrs. Davis's hand for a moment. She blushed\nvigorously and simpered:\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thomas, my case comes up to-day, and I'm just worried sick\nabout it. Do you think I could see Lem--\" she stopped, hung her head,\nand looked coquettishly up at Thomas as she bit her lip, correcting\nherself, \"I mean Judge Townsend?\"\n\nThomas looked around to see if any one were listening. \"I'm afraid you\ncan't see him just now,\" he replied, leading her to a chair just under\nthe judge's desk, which was set upon a high platform. \"Is there anything\nI can do?\" he asked, in his smooth, bland voice.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Mrs. Davis whined and twisted in her chair. \"My lawyer's\nsick. I telephoned his doctor, who was just as mean as could be and said\nhe couldn't come to court to-day. If I could only tell the judge--\" She\ngave Thomas a look laden with understanding.\n\n\"There shouldn't be any trouble about that,\" laughed Thomas, dropping\neasily into the chair beside her. \"You can explain the circumstances to\nthe judge when your case is called, and--\"\n\n\"But I don't want it postponed! A court-room scares me just half to\ndeath. I'll die if I have to put it off and go through screwing up my\ncourage again. I just will!\" She nodded her head emphatically until the\nbright blue plumes that fell from the back of her enormous picture-hat\nthreatened Thomas's eyes.\n\nHe moved away from them, offering, after a moment's thought: \"Well, I'll\nbe very glad to represent you if you care to have me. There's nothing to\nyour case, anyhow. The judge is a friend of yours, isn't he?\"\n\nMrs. Davis hesitated and rolled her baby-blue eyes at him from under her\nheavily beaded lashes as she giggled. \"Oh yes--he's a friend,\" and then,\nthinking better of her confidence, she ended, with a sigh, \"that is, I\nknow him--slightly.\"\n\nThomas smiled to himself, reassuring her. \"Then don't give it a thought.\nJust leave everything to me.\"\n\nA grateful hand was laid upon his arm and she looked up at him with\nfervid admiration. \"You are so smart and so kind, Mr. Thomas. You've\ntaken such a load off my mind. If anything went wrong after waiting all\nthese months I'd just die--that's all there is about it.\"\n\nAt this moment the door of the judge's chambers opened and Lemuel\nTownsend appeared, clad in a Prince Albert suit and beaming on Mrs.\nDavis, who arose and walked well into the middle of the floor so that\nshe should not escape his immediate attention.\n\nThis was a moment of great satisfaction for Thomas, who looked about the\ncourt-room, scrutinizing every man in it, his face brightening as he saw\nthat John Marvin had not put in an appearance. When the sheriff had\nfinished opening court he arose from his place at the lawyers' table,\nfor he knew that the case of the railroad against John Marvin was the\nfirst upon the day's calendar. He pulled his revers together with a\npompous gesture and opened his mouth to speak. Before he could do so\nJudge Townsend called to the clerk, whose desk was at one side of the\nbench, and suggested in low tones:\n\n\"I think this first case can go over--\"\n\nThomas caught the words and disappointment drove the self-satisfaction\nfrom his face. He ventured to address the court: \"If it please your\nHonor, this is an action for the wrongful taking of timber, and I've\ncome a long way and I would like to get home--\"\n\nTownsend had not been listening to a word, his attention being\nconcentrated on the tip of an upstanding feather on Mrs. Davis's hat,\nwhich could barely be seen over the top of his desk. \"Eh? What's that?\"\nhe asked, sharply, not too pleased to be interrupted in his endeavor to\ncatch further sight of Mrs. Davis.\n\nMarvin not having put in an appearance, Thomas's hopes of winning the\ncase for the railroad by default were high. He did not think Marvin\nwould appear, but every delay might be fatal and it took an effort on\nhis part to appear unperturbed. However, he managed to answer in urbane\ntones, \"I was saying, your Honor, that--\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\" Townsend bent his head and looked down with severe eyes over\nthe top of his glasses. \"Just a moment, please,\" he added, as Thomas\nwould have finished his plea. Turning to the clerk, he ordered, \"Let me\nsee the list.\"\n\nThe list was handed to him and he ran down it, finally remarking to the\nclerk, \"I think I will dispose of these short cases first.\" Half rising\nin his chair, he looked over the top of his desk to where Mrs. Davis was\ntwisting and turning in her chair in an effort to get a look at him.\n\n\"Mrs. Davis,\" he called in gentle tones, \"are you ready?\"\n\nShe hurriedly precipitated herself into the middle of the space in front\nof the platform. \"Why, yes,\" she answered, looking about as if she did\nnot know where to turn and gathering her sealskin cape about her.\n\n\"I'll take your case at two o'clock,\" the judge said to Thomas, who\nshrugged his shoulders, but did not sit down as Townsend had expected\nhim to do.\n\nAs the clerk called the case, \"Davis _versus_ Davis,\" Thomas moved close\nto the bench, exclaiming, \"If it please your Honor--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a glower from Townsend, who said, \"This case is\nDavis _versus_ Davis, Mr. Thomas,\" his eyes wrinkling into a broad smile\nas he again turned his attention to Mrs. Davis, who stood, bewildered,\nnot knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\n\"I am quite aware that it is the Davis case, your Honor,\" Thomas\nanswered, not without a note of triumph in his voice and demeanor. \"I am\nthe attorney for Mrs. Davis.\"\n\nThomas's announcement shocked Townsend into dropping a document he held\nin his hand. It fell on the desk and was blown by the strong east wind\nthat came in from the window clear across the room. \"_You_ are?\" he\nasked, with a mouth fallen half open from surprise and annoyance, his\nspectacles tilting to the end of his nose.\n\nThomas did not answer at once, but flushed, turning, for the sake of a\nfew moments in which to think, toward the clerk, who was scrambling\nafter the paper. His glance on its way back to the judge met that of\nBlodgett, which had both a warning and an \"I-told-you-so\" quality in it.\n\n\"Well?\" The judge's question was drawn into a length which further\nembarrassed Thomas. Being a young man of poise, however, he straightened\nthe revers of his coat and settled them with a shake upon his shoulder,\nreplying, graciously, \"Mrs. Davis has appointed me in the place of Mr.\nAdams.\"\n\nTownsend continued to stare most ungraciously at the young man in front\nof him, but Thomas, unabashed, went on: \"Your Honor, I believe, is\nfamiliar with the complaint and has gone over the depositions submitted\nby the plaintiff. As the defendant has neither entered a denial, put in\nan appearance, nor been represented in court, I move that the plaintiff\nbe granted an absolute separation from the defendant.\"\n\nSwift shafts of indignation bolted from Townsend's eyes back and forth\nbetween Thomas and Margaret Davis. He saw that consternation was plainly\nwritten on the latter's baby face and that tears were gathering in her\nbig blue eyes now pleadingly uplifted to his. His jaw relaxed and a\nsmile played at the corners of his mouth. But Thomas' complacency at the\nsoftening in the judge's attitude was too much, and Townsend snapped\nout, \"The motion is denied.\"\n\nFrom her chair directly in front of the judge's desk Margaret Davis\nimmediately jumped up, her eyes opening into large, round, moist orbs\nwhich threatened to grow moister as she asked, in a voice that fear had\nrobbed of its ingenuousness, \"Does that mean I can't get a divorce?\"\n\nThomas was about to reassure her, when he was again interrupted by the\njudge, whose voice flattened as he looked away from her, afraid to trust\nthe melting effect of her coy glances. \"It means that the motion of your\ncounsel is unusual and that I have good and sufficient reasons for\ndenying it,\" he said, with emphasis.\n\nMargaret put her handkerchief to her eyes to stem the threatening tide,\nwhile Thomas hastened to forestall the avalanche by informing her, as he\nplaced a comforting hand on her arm, that he would be able, at least, to\ntry the case.\n\nHad Lem Townsend been able to prevent the latter, he would have done so,\nbut he was too young as a jurist to allow criticism of his knowledge of\npoints of law, and he reluctantly gave consent to the trial of the case.\n\nIt was with a beating heart and a jaw set against the impending quiver\nof a not too slender frame that she held up her hand for the oath and\ntook her place upon the stand, looking about with a terror that was new\nborn in eyes heretofore ungiven to everything but treacle. Her lips\ntrembled an almost inaudible reply to the clerk's question.\n\nShe was still standing, and Thomas, noticing this, motioned her to be\nseated, beginning at the same time her examination.\n\n\"Mrs. Davis, where do you live?\" he asked. His own tones were of no\ncertain quality, for the firm pressure of Townsend's white lips and his\nobvious intention of steering clear of any attempt at honeyed coercion\non Margaret Davis's part were not encouraging.\n\nIn vain she cast her eyes about in an effort to inveigle the sympathy of\nLem Townsend. He stared straight ahead at the paper in front of him,\nalthough he saw not a word. Her answer to Thomas's question came with a\ngasp. \"New York.\" Then realizing that her case was lost and her entire\nsix months' sojourn at Calivada was as nothing unless she immediately\ncorrected her mistake, she gasped a second time as she drew the folds of\nher blue-velvet cape about her. \"Oh no! I don't mean that at all. I live\nhere--I live here in Nevada and I've lived here long enough to get a\ndivorce. The judge--\" and here she stopped for breath, making another\nattempt to corral his stubborn favor--\"his Honor--\" she jerked, with a\nquick breath, \"can tell--you that.\"\n\nBut the judge did not smile and his eyes remained rigid in their sockets\nas they glared at the paper in his hand.\n\n\"Just answer the questions, please, Mrs. Davis,\" Thomas cautioned her\npleasantly, although as a witness she was disconcerting.\n\n\"Well,\" she drawled, fidgeting in her chair, \"that's not easy when\nyou're sworn to tell the truth.\"\n\nA titter ran through the court-room and was brought to an abrupt end by\nthe sheriff's gavel.\n\nThomas resumed his examination. \"You are the wife of Gerald Davis, are\nyou not?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"And when and where were you married to him?\"\n\n\"Seven years ago, October fifth--in Peoria.\" She glanced about at the\nsea of smiling faces, again seeking sympathy from the judge.\n\nAgain he was adamant.\n\n\"You were living in Peoria?\"\n\nThe insinuation that anything less than a metropolis should be her\nabiding-place was more than she could bear and in turbulent leaps,\nbroken by her gasps for breath, she blurted, her lips quivering and her\neyes filling with tears: \"I should--say--not! My husband and I were\nplaying there. We were partners doing a dancing act--\"\n\nThomas tried to interrupt her and succeeded with half a question. \"When\ndid your husband first show signs of not loving you and--\"\n\nHe got no farther, for she went on, determined to get over the\ndisagreeable business of being truthful. \"He stopped loving me about a\nyear before we were married.\"\n\nThis time a storm of laughter surged through the court-room and it took\nseveral taps of Blodgett's gavel to regain quiet. Undaunted, she\nfinished her story. \"It's really hard to explain why we were married.\nYou see\"--she hesitated and resumed jerkily--\"we were in Peoria--and we\nwere partners--and--and--it rained all week--Well, somehow it seemed a\ngood idea at the time.\"\n\nAt this point it became necessary for Townsend, in order to maintain the\ndignity of the bench, to caution the spectators that if there were any\nmore such outbursts of joy he would have the court-room cleared.\n\nThomas still maintained his control, although cold perspiration was\nwilting his highly polished collar. \"But after you were married he was\ncruel to you, was he not?\" he asked.\n\n\"I should say he was!\" The answer was accompanied by an emphatic nod of\nthe head and again she flew onward, over his head, determined that she\nshould tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n\"Why,\" she opened her left hand and enumerated the said Gerald Davis's\nshortcomings by pressing its fingers with the thumb and forefinger of\nher right hand, \"he put his name on the bill in larger type than mine.\nHe tried to strike me once--but he was a poor judge of distance.\nAnd--and--\" she stopped. This time her appeal was directed to Thomas.\n\n\"He deserted you, did he not?\" Thomas eagerly took up the thread, hoping\nto unravel the snarl she had worked with it.\n\n\"Well, we parted--\"\n\n\"After he deserted you?\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Davis could answer the last question, Townsend straightened\nthe spectacles on his nose and entered the case. Slowly welling within\nhim was a jealousy now overwhelming. His political ambitions alone had\nstood in the way of his descending from the bench and throwing Thomas\nout of the court-room. It was only by remaining silent that he had\ncurbed his temper. Now it broke away from him, and he turned,\nthundering, \"So far, Mr. Thomas, the witness has not testified that her\nhusband deserted her!\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Margaret Davis turned squarely in her chair, pursing her carmine\nlips into an irresistible moue. \"Of course he deserted me! We were\nplaying in Chicago, and I went West and he stayed there and--\"\n\n\"That looks to me, madam, as if you deserted him. So far, your testimony\nhas not brought out anything to substantiate your complaint.\"\n\nTears unrestrained burst forth at this moment. The thought that not only\nhad she lost all chance of securing her freedom, but that Lemuel\nTownsend, whose attentions had helped to while away a six months which\nwould otherwise have been dull to one accustomed to a barrage of suitors\nat the stage door, was more than she could bear. Pointing to Thomas, she\nsobbed into a purple silk handkerchief that smelled not faintly of\npatchouli. \"That's because he told me to do nothing but answer his\nquestions, and then he asked me all the wrong things--\" Her emotion, out\nof bounds, spent itself in a cataract of tears. Unable to go on, she sat\nthere, trying to stem the tears with a handkerchief inadequate for their\nvolume.\n\nThomas tried to save his case. \"Your Honor--I--\"\n\nHe hesitated, Margaret Davis coming to his rescue. \"Oh, I don't mean to\nblame you,\" she said to him, addressing the last of her remark to the\njudge. \"He doesn't know anything about my case!\"\n\nWhat Lemuel Townsend would have liked to do at that moment was to have\ntaken her in his arms and reassure her, as old fools are apt to do with\nna\u00c3\u00afve young creatures. But her apparent friendliness with Thomas and her\ndeceitfulness in employing him for her attorney was more than he could\ncondone. He would not relax his stern exterior, although his interior\nwas softening. \"Then, why,\" he asked, in measured tones, \"is he\nappearing for you if he does not understand your case?\"\n\nRecognizing the opportunity for explanation, Margaret wiped her eyes,\nsniffed, and, went on: \"My lawyer's sick, you see. And I wanted to tell\nyou all about it, but Mr. Thomas explained that I couldn't see you. And\nhe said he'd do everything for me, and you'd give me a divorce without\nany trouble at all.\"\n\nThomas whitened and turned to the table, where he fingered his\nbrief-case nervously. He could not brave the glare which he knew\nTownsend was directing at him, nor the tirade he feared would follow.\n\n\"When did he tell you all that?\" the judge asked, his nostrils quivering\nwith rage, his voice strained to a tenor.\n\n\"Just now.\" Margaret grew happily voluble and she nodded her head back\nand forth like a child of six as she ogled the judge. \"When I came into\ncourt he was here and I told him the trouble I was in. It's the only\ntime I've seen him since you asked me not to.\"\n\nTownsend was so relieved that he did not hear the last of her remark and\nthe noisy delight of the spectators also escaped him. He was bent upon\none purpose, that of chastising Thomas. \"Why didn't you tell me this\nbefore?\" he asked Margaret, in tender tones, forgetting, in his ardor,\nthat there was such a thing as a court-room. He leaned far over the desk\nand beamed upon her. \"There, there, don't let it upset you.\" He offered\nher a glass of water.\n\nAs she took it, Thomas stepped up to the bench again and tried to\npalliate the judge's wounded sensibilities. \"If your Honor please, I\nwas simply acting from a friendly standpoint and I thought--\"\n\n\"No matter what your motives were, sir, you presumed when you told the\nplaintiff what the court's rulings would be.\" He turned abruptly from\nThomas and leaned graciously toward the plaintiff. \"Now, Mrs. Davis,\" he\nresumed, \"let me question you. Why did you leave your husband in\nChicago?\"\n\nReassured, Margaret bridled coyly and answered, lifting her lids to the\njudge: \"Because he didn't show up for a performance and I had to go on\nalone--and afterward the manager told him the act was better without\nhim. And he sulked and stayed away from the theater all the rest of the\nweek and on our next jump he refused to go with me.\" Her last words\ndwindled into a plaintive whine.\n\n\"And you were obliged to go without him?\" Lem Townsend subtly gave a\nslight nod of his head which Margaret caught and interpreted into a\nvigorous acquiescence with her own curly blond head.\n\n\"Did you try to have him go with you?\" Again the hint and again\nMargaret scored her point.\n\n\"Of course I did!\" she responded. \"I mean, yes--your Honor. But he said\nhe'd show me how long I could go it on my own; but I showed _him_, for\nI've never seen him since. I only heard from him once and that was when\nI sent him money.\"\n\n\"Have you tried to see him?\" Lem Townsend asked the last question\ngrudgingly, but he felt that his own honor in the case was in danger of\nimpeachment, and he was sure that his slight nod would be followed as it\nhad before. He was right.\n\n\"Of course I did. Mr. Blackmore--he was our manager--gave me his sworn\nstatement.\"\n\nTownsend for the first time really saw the paper in front of him. He\nread it carefully, answering in tones of quick delight. \"Yes, here it is\nand a deposition dated Chicago stating that Davis left you without\nwarning and refused to dance with you again.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Honor,\" she cooed.\n\nThere was silence while Townsend scrutinized the papers in front of him.\nMargaret sat with her eyes anxiously fastened on him. With a nod of\nsatisfaction he shoved the papers aside and, smiling down at her,\nannounced in kindly tones, \"Your decree is granted.\"\n\n\"Your Honor!\" She arose from her chair and sat down in it again, a\ncopious flow of tears making it impossible for her to leave the stand.\n\nTownsend reached for the glass of water and held it toward her once\nagain. \"Please, please, Mrs. Davis,\" he endeavored to calm her, but his\ncompassion only served to bring on another storm. \"I'm _so_ emotional,\"\nshe sobbed, \"I can't stop it!\"\n\nTownsend looked about helplessly. A sudden awakening to his own\nprerogative solved the dilemma. \"Mr. Sheriff, announce a recess,\" he\nordered. And leaving the bench, he went to Mrs. Davis and guided her\ninto his chambers.\n\nThe crowd filed out of the court-room, while Thomas, weak with shame and\ndisappointment, took his seat at the table again, impatiently toying\nwith a paper-knife that had fallen from his pin-seal brief-case.\n\nBlodgett went to him and leaned over with the intention of reassuring\nhim, when there was a disturbance at the window which opened from a\nbalcony a few feet above the street. Both of the men turned just in time\nto see John Marvin climb through the window and pull his suit-case in\nafter him.\n\nThe sheriff stepped forward, hesitating as he realized his powers were\nnegative in a court-room.\n\n\"Here, what you doing?\" the clerk called out, getting up from his desk.\n\nThe sheriff glared and handled the manacles in his pocket with an\nintemperate disgust.\n\nMarvin looked at him and laughed, answering the clerk. \"I've got\nbusiness in this court. I'm John Marvin and I'm appearing in the case\nthe Pacific Railroad has brought against me.\" He did not deign to glance\nat Thomas, who had arisen, facing him, white from the blow to his hope\nof obtaining a judgment by default.\n\nMarvin went calmly to the other end of the attorneys' table and opened\nup his shabby brown-canvas brief-case. He whistled to himself softly as\nhe did so and glanced at Thomas, whose pallid mouth was drawn into a\ndogged sneer.\n\nBlodgett went back to his seat just within the swinging gates that gave\nentrance behind the railing and sat glaring at Marvin. Quiet reigned in\nthe court; then a faint shuffle of feet was heard beyond the door.\n\nAs Blodgett looked around, the door of the court-room opened gently and\nBill Jones, clad in a Civil War veteran's uniform, faded from the sun,\nits brass buttons tarnished, and wearing his soldier's black soft hat\nwith its gold cord cocked jauntily over one eye, sauntered down the\naisle, holding out his hand to Marvin, who had jumped from his seat and\nbounded around the table to greet him.\n\n\"Hello, John!\" Lightnin' drawled, grinning. \"How's tricks? You look\nkinder legal this morning?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAs Bill made his way through the swinging gates, Blodgett put out a\ndetaining arm, asking, with a scowl, \"Here, what do _you_ want?\"\n\n\"Been arrestin' any one in California lately?\" Bill slid past Blodgett,\nignoring his attempt to stop him, the old twinkle in his eye as he\ntouched what he knew to be the sheriff's sensitive spot.\n\n\"Well, Lightnin',\" Marvin exclaimed, \"how did you get here and what in\nthe world have you come for?\"\n\n\"Yer case ain't over yet, is it?\"\n\nMarvin shook his head, repeating his first question.\n\nBill did not reply at once. Not wanting Marvin to know that he and Zeb\nhad been nearly two weeks getting there, and that they had come in much\nthe same way they had gone, riding when they could get a lift on a train\nor a wagon, walking when they could not, he pretended to forget the\nyoung man's questions, asking one himself instead, \"What time your case\ncomin' up?\"\n\n\"Two o'clock.\"\n\nThe sheriff sauntered up to them. Bill knew the purpose of his approach\nwas to catch the drift of their conversation, so he turned abruptly,\nhis hands in his back pockets, and grinned at Blodgett. Nodding toward\nMarvin, he drawled, \"I'm a witness for him. I got to testify how you\nserved a warrant on him.\"\n\nThe sheriff glared and slouched over to his chair, throwing himself into\nit as he pulled his black sombrero down over his eyes.\n\nMarvin, his arm about Bill's shoulders, leaned over him, guiding him\ngently to the attorneys' table. \"Well, Lightnin',\" he questioned, in an\nindulgent voice, \"how did you happen to show up here?\"\n\n\"I promised you, didn't I?\"\n\n\"But that was a long time ago. I supposed you'd forgotten all about it.\"\n\nBill glanced quickly at him and smiled. \"I ain't never forgotten nothin'\nsince I was four years old.\"\n\nMarvin, happy to see the old Lightnin' behind the boast, smiled, asking\nhim, \"How did you know the trial was to-day?\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" Bill replied, as he sat against the edge of the table,\nsteadying himself with his hands. \"I seen it in a Reno paper at the\nHome.\"\n\n\"But I told you the time I came to see you that you needn't bother\nabout coming. I wouldn't have had you come all this long way for the\nworld if I had known it.\" There was concern in Marvin's voice as he\nslowly dropped into a chair in front of Bill.\n\n\"That's why I didn't say nothin'.\"\n\n\"Where did the money come from?\"\n\n\"I saved my pension.\" Bill glanced slyly at him. Catching his\nquestioning eye, he stopped and looked through the window into the\ndistance.\n\n\"You told me you sent your pension money to your wife!\"\n\n\"I did--some of it. I sent mother six dollars, but I didn't get no\nanswer.\" The laughter went from Bill and he leaned over, looking toward\nthe far hills, strange, unreal purple against the clear, cold blue of\nthe April sky.\n\nMarvin watched him, asking, \"Did you tell her you were in the Soldiers'\nHome?\"\n\n\"No.\" Bill's voice was devoid of inflection.\n\n\"Then she probably didn't know where you were.\"\n\n\"Where else could I be?\" His lips were puckered into a whistle, although\nthey were quivering and no tune came. It was always this way when he\nthought of mother, so he straightened himself and stood by Marvin's\nchair, forcing a smile to his lips and jerking out, \"And six dollars is\nsix dollars.\"\n\nThe court-room was filling again, five minutes having elapsed since\nrecess was declared. A side door opened and Townsend came into court.\nBlodgett stood up, pounded the desk with his gavel and announced the\nopening of the session. Bill and Marvin, rising to order, started and\nlooked at each other as Thomas entered the room just behind the judge.\nFollowing him was Everett Hammond, who, when he saw Bill and Marvin\ntogether at the attorneys' table, began vigorous and anxious whispering\nin Thomas's ear as he took his place next to him on the other side of\nthe table.\n\nMargaret Davis entered from the judge's chambers. She was accompanied by\nMrs. Jones and Millie.\n\nBill did not see them. His eyes were fastened on Hammond and Thomas in\nclose conference.\n\nBut suddenly, as he turned to take in the rest of the people in the\nroom, his eyes alighted on his wife. He arose and wandered toward her,\nexclaiming, as she came to meet him, \"Why, mother, what are you doing\nhere?\" He stared at her and held out his hand.\n\nMrs. Jones was so surprised to see him that she could not speak and\nstood still, her hands in the air half-way between her waist and\nshoulder.\n\nMillie was the first to answer him. \"Oh, daddy--\" She was going to put\nher arms around him, when Blodgett rapped upon the table for order.\n\nTears sprang to Mrs. Jones's eyes and Margaret Davis arose and led her\nto a chair next to hers and just at the foot of the platform, from which\nTownsend smiled happily upon them.\n\n\"Come along, Mr. Clerk!\" There was cheer in Townsend's voice as he\ndirected another saccharine shaft toward Margaret. \"I've got an\nimportant engagement and I want to get through. Call the next case.\"\n\nBill, his eyes still on his wife, walked slowly to the table and sat\ndown just behind Marvin.\n\n\"Jones _versus_ Jones,\" read the clerk, standing at one side of the\nplatform and unfolding the document he held in his hand.\n\nBill did not hear him. He was gazing at Mrs. Jones, an old tenderness\nin his eyes, a bitter longing in his heart. Drifting, living only for\nthe hour, as was his nature, but one scar had remained unobliterated\nupon his memory, one hope alone flickered in the lonely sanctuary of a\nsoul that had known no conflicts. His affection for his wife had been\nsomething deeper than emotion, something lighter than passion. It had\nbeen the lasting quantity in a life of fleeting concepts, and his six\nmonths at the Home had subdued it into a dull ache which found relief\nonly when a faint optimism brought vague dreams of a remote reunion.\n\nHer presence in court puzzled him. He felt that it must have something\nto do with the sale of the place, or, perhaps, with Marvin's case. And\nyet he was sure she knew nothing of the transaction between Mrs. Marvin\nand Thomas, or between Rodney Harper and Marvin. Whatever it was, it had\nbrought a ray of expectancy to Bill, and he jumped as he was brought out\nof his reverie by Marvin's perplexed whisper: \"Jones _versus_ Jones. By\nJove, Lightnin', I believe that's you!\"\n\n\"Me?\" Bill glanced around as if he were half awake and leaned far\nforward in his chair, putting his hand to his ear and straining to catch\nevery word as the clerk read the complaint:\n\n\"To the people of the State of Nevada, Mary Jones, Plaintiff _versus_\nWilliam Jones, Defendant. A civil action wherein the said plaintiff\ndeposes and says she was lawfully married to the said defendant on the\n14th day of June, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, in the state of\nNevada. The said plaintiff prays this court for a permanent annulment of\nher marriage vows, the defendant, William Jones, having disregarded and\nbroken all obligations of the marriage contract, thereby causing the\nplaintiff great suffering and mental agony and the said Mary Jones\nclaims a final separation and divorce from the said William Jones on the\ngrounds of failure to provide, habitual intoxication, and intolerable\ncruelty. Subscribed and sworn to me on the fifth day of April, nineteen\nhundred and seventeen. Alexander Bradshaw, Notary: Raymond Thomas,\nAttorney for the plaintiff.\"\n\nWhen the clerk had finished Bill sent a beseeching glance toward his\nwife. Each word of the document had entered far into a mind little given\nto taking account. One by one he had tolled off the record against him,\nplacing the accusations in two files--the true and the false. That his\nwife had cause for anger against him he now, for the first time, fully\nrealized. But he was bewildered, and when Bill was bewildered it was his\nhabit to seek enlightenment.\n\nAfter a moment, in which Mrs. Jones darted swift glances from beneath a\nbrow bowed with regret, he turned to Marvin, who had arisen and was\nstanding back of his chair, bending over him, and asked, simply, \"Is\nthat all about me?\"\n\nBlodgett tapped his sheriff's gavel.\n\nTownsend caught Bill's question and asked, \"What did you say?\"\n\nMarvin, knowing that Bill was inadequate to the test placed upon him,\ncame quickly to the rescue. Standing in front of the judge, he\nexplained: \"Your Honor, Mr. Jones is the unconscious defendant in this\ncase. It just happened that he came to court to-day to be a witness in\nanother case. He has had no previous knowledge of this action.\"\n\nBefore he could go farther Raymond Thomas, upon whom the entire\nsituation was reacting in swift, powerful threats to his cause, arose,\nhis face drawn with the agony of frustration, his voice high pitched\nfrom the effort to subdue the feelings fast getting beyond his control.\n\"The defendant's whereabouts were unknown to us, your Honor, and the\ncourt allowed us to serve notice by publication.\"\n\n\"Publication in what?\" Marvin demanded, as he darted contempt at Thomas.\n\nTownsend answered him. \"Proper service was given, if the defendant could\nnot be located.\" To Bill he addressed the next question, \"Is that what\nyou asked about?\"\n\nStill confused, and not yet quite getting the trend of the whole matter,\nhe asked, in his quiet, disinterested way, \"Who, me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the judge. \"You made some remark after the complaint was\nread.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure I'd got it straight,\" Bill said, looking ahead of him,\nmouth half open.\n\n\"You mean the grounds on which the action is based?\" the judge\npersisted.\n\nThere was a pause, in which Bill looked first at Thomas, whose lids\ndrooped under the old man's scrutiny, and then at his wife, who hung her\nhead. \"I guess so,\" he jerked, drumming his fingers softly on the table.\n\nTownsend ordered the clerk to repeat that part of the complaint wherein\nthe grounds for the suit were mentioned. The clerk repeated, \"Failure to\nprovide, habitual intoxication, and intolerable cruelty.\"\n\nBill listened attentively. As the clerk sat down, Bill looked up at the\njudge, asking, \"Is that all?\"\n\n[Illustration: LIGHTNIN', IN HIS FADED G. A. R. UNIFORM ... LISTENED\nATTENTIVELY]\n\n\"Don't you think it's enough?\" There was admonition in his manner, but\nthere was a certain gentleness in his voice and a smile of sympathy\nlurked at the corners of his mouth. It was difficult for Lemuel\nTownsend, who knew the lovable side of the careless old man, but he was\ndetermined to maintain the dignity and the integrity of the law, and he\nknew that he must remain unbiased, no matter how strong his feeling was\nthat here there had been sad tampering with truth and the finer essences\nof happiness.\n\nHis severity did not touch Bill. His sense of humor, always close to the\nsurface, asserted itself. A gleam that was half derision, half\namusement, lighted his eyes as he grinned up at the judge. \"Sounded as\nif there was more the first time.\"\n\nMarvin again stood before the judge. He knew that Bill had no one to\ndefend him and he had not felt the necessity of offering himself. He\njust took it for granted that Bill would turn to him in the dilemma and\nso he took the case in his hands. \"I am counsel for the defendant, your\nHonor,\" he said, \"and he is entering a general denial.\"\n\n\"Are you counsel for the defense?\" Townsend's astonishment was evident\nin his long-drawn inflection. He had not heard of Marvin's admission to\nthe bar. Neither had he seen the young man about lately, and the whole\nsituation puzzled him.\n\nBefore Marvin could answer him, Bill was out of his seat, replying for\nhim, \"Yes, sir, he is my lawyer.\"\n\nIt was not the judge's way to admit himself baffled. Turning to Thomas,\nhe instructed him to call his witnesses.\n\nMarvin took a seat in front of Bill at the attorneys' table, while Bill\non the edge of his chair leaned forward expectantly, his eyes fastened\nnot on Thomas, but upon his wife, who sat with her head bowed and her\neyes staring into her lap.\n\nThomas beckoned to Mrs. Jones, calling her name.\n\nAs she arose, Hammond, who sat next to Thomas on the other side of the\ntable from Marvin and Bill, and who had appeared indifferent and bored\nso far in the proceedings, jumped to his feet, dismay written on every\nfeature, and hastened to whisper in his partner's ear: \"Are you crazy?\nThe most dangerous thing you can do, now that old Jones is in court, is\nto call her to the stand.\"\n\nThomas in his vaunted shrewdness had overlooked this possibility, but\nnow that Hammond mentioned it to him he saw what disastrous\ncomplications Mrs. Jones's presence on the witness-stand might lead to.\nNodding in answer to Hammond's counsel, he again turned to Mrs. Jones,\nsaying, \"I don't think it will be necessary for you to testify at all,\nMrs. Jones.\" As she sat down, he smiled at Millie, addressing her, \"Miss\nBuckley, will you take the stand, please?\"\n\nMillie had not expected to be called, and as she arose at his summons\nher face flushed with embarrassment. She stood still momentarily and her\neyes met Marvin's for the first time since he had appeared in court.\nWith an angry flash they quickly sought the witness-chair, and, although\ntrembling at the ordeal before her, she made an effort to trip lightly\nto the stand. As she took her place and was sworn in by the clerk her\nreplies were scarcely audible. Casting frightened glances up through her\nlong lashes at Thomas, she was reassured by a smile. After the\npreliminary examination as to her adoption by Bill and Mrs. Jones and\nher residence with them since she was three years old, he began upon the\nintimate questions which he hoped would weave a web of incriminating\nevidence against Bill, evidence which would redound to his justification\nin the part he had played in bringing about the divorce.\n\n\"Miss Buckley,\" he asked, pulling nervously at his cuffs and bringing\nthem down two or three inches below his sleeves, \"Mrs. Jones has toiled\nearly and late to provide for the family ever since you can remember,\nhas she not?\"\n\nMillie nodded, gazing anxiously at Bill, who, far forward on his chair,\nwas drinking in every word she said. There was a pitiful accusation\nbehind the sadness in the eyes with which he returned her gaze.\n\nAs Thomas continued she, like her mother, concentrated her attention on\nher hands folded tight in her lap.\n\n\"Why did you leave home three years ago, Miss Buckley?\"\n\n\"To earn my living, of course,\" was the reply, in low, reluctant tones.\n\n\"What did you do with your wages?\"\n\nMillie hesitated. After taking out barely enough to live on in meager\nfashion she had sent most of the remainder home, not because either Mrs.\nJones or Bill had asked for help, but because she knew how difficult was\ntheir living during the long winter months when their only source of\nincome was Bill's pension and the few mountain people who dropped in\nwhen passing back and forth and remain overnight and for a meal or so.\nHad she known that she was to be called as a witness she might even have\nrefused to accompany Mrs. Jones to court, for Bill's derelictions could\nnever outweigh the knowledge that it was he who had saved her from an\norphanage. She swallowed the lump in her throat, but even this did not\nkeep back her tears at the thought that her answer might be the betrayal\nof the old man who had been a father to her through all the years.\n\nThomas saw her disinclination and understood the condition of mind which\nprompted it. He knew he must call his persuasive powers to his aid, so\nhe went very close to the witness-stand, and, leaning over her, spoke\nin his softest tones.\n\n\"I am sorry to have to ask these questions, Miss Buckley, because I know\nhow you dread to testify in this case, but it is unavoidable. Will you\nanswer my question? You sent the greater part of your wages home, did\nyou not?\" He spoke as if he, too, were distressed.\n\nMillie, falling into the trap, sighed, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you really left home to earn money in order to help support the\nJones family, didn't you?\"\n\nAgain, overcome by the complications of the situation in which she found\nherself, she was unable to answer except with a reluctant nod.\n\n\"Did you ever see Mrs. Jones's husband drunk?\"\n\nAs Thomas asked this question he looked toward Bill. Millie did not\nanswer. The tears gathered in her eyes and she wiped them away, burying\nher face in the handkerchief she held in one of her hands.\n\nThomas insisted. \"You have seen him in that condition hundreds of\ntimes, have you not?\"\n\nThere was a malicious note in his voice this time, as well as in the\nlook he directed at the old man at the table.\n\nMillie caught it, and a slight antagonism crept into her voice as she\nstraightened in her chair, answering, in surprise, \"Why, I never\ncounted.\"\n\nThomas was deriving a long-desired satisfaction in his prodding of Bill,\nand it threatened his shrewder self-control. \"But he was in the habit of\ncoming home drunk, wasn't he?\" There was real glee in the question, but\nit escaped Millie this time. With a beseeching glance at Thomas, and one\nwhich pleaded for forgiveness toward Bill, she said, slowly,\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"And because of the poverty brought about by those bad habits you were\nobliged to leave--\"\n\nHere Millie broke in. Forgetting her embarrassment and the crowded\ncourt-room in the realization that words were being put into her mouth,\nwords which fell far short of the truth, she burst out, indignantly:\n\"Why, I never said any such thing! I went away to work because there was\nno opportunity in Calivada to earn any money, and I thought as long as I\nwas going at all I might just as well go to San Francisco where I could\nmake a salary large enough to take care of myself and to help Mr. and\nMrs. Jones, who have been very good to me.\"\n\nThomas saw that he had overstepped himself and he groped in his mind for\nnew questions, until a scowl from Hammond reminded him that it might be\nbetter to stop rather than to bring out evidence which might turn\nagainst them and in favor of Bill. So he dismissed Millie from the\nstand.\n\nShe stood up while Thomas took his place next to Hammond at the table.\nBut Marvin, after a few whispered words with Bill, took Thomas's place\nby the witness-chair, holding up a detaining hand and calling, \"Miss\nBuckley!\"\n\nMillie glared at him, blushed deeply, and walked off the stand. She had\nnot been able to forgive him for his advice to Bill and still held him\nresponsible for Bill's leaving home, as she had felt that if Bill had\nnot been prejudiced against Thomas and Hammond the place would have been\nsold and they would have all been living together in comfort.\n\nBut she did not get very far. As she left the platform Townsend motioned\nher to return and, submerging his personal friendship for her beneath\nhis judicial duties he exclaimed, severely:\n\n\"One moment, Miss Buckley. The counsel for the defense has asked you a\nquestion.\"\n\nMillie turned her back on Marvin as she dropped into the chair again. A\nsmile played on Marvin's lips, but it was a rueful one. To come thus\nface to face with her in a situation where he was compelled to be her\nantagonist in order to see that justice was done to his old friend was\nnot a happy ordeal for him.\n\nTownsend knew what was going on between the young people and he felt\nkeenly for them, but it was a part of him to hold to his duty always and\nnot to his own personal biases. His severity did not relax even when\nMillie pouted: \"I don't want to answer _his_ questions! Must I?\"\n\nThe people in the court-room, interested and amused at the unusual\nd\u00c3\u00a9nouement, went into a peal of laughter which received swift check from\nthe sheriff's gavel. She flushed violently and obeyed Judge Townsend's\nadmonishment that she must answer all of Marvin's questions.\n\nMarvin's first inquiry did not tend to make things any easier for her.\n\n\"Who employed you as a stenographer?\" he asked. His back was turned to\nThomas, but he could feel the latter shifting in his chair.\n\nFinding no mercy in Townsend's manner, she succumbed to the inevitable,\nsnapping, with a toss of her head, \"Mr. Thomas!\"\n\n\"_This_ Mr. Thomas?\" Marvin asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Millie. There had been nothing in her heart but deepest\nmisery and shame at having to testify against Bill during her\nexamination by Thomas. Now she was fired by a resentment against Marvin,\nBill being forced out of the equation. Her answers came in a swift\ndefiance that bespoke a determination to make it as difficult for him as\npossible. Marvin, seeing at once that she and Mrs. Jones were still\nplastic in the hands of Thomas and Hammond, was tempted into battle.\n\n\"Did Mr. Thomas,\" he asked, \"give you this position because you told him\nyou wanted to be of financial assistance to the Jones family?\"\n\nMillie opened her mouth to reply, but Thomas was on his feet at once,\nobjecting to the question.\n\nFacing the judge, Marvin ignored Thomas, saying, \"I am quite willing to\nwithdraw it if it is found objectionable, your Honor.\"\n\nThomas stepped quickly to Marvin's side. He was a few inches the taller\nand he glared down at Marvin, who stared back, his jaw set in the\nresolution to stand firm against the man he knew to be a fraud.\n\nThat he was standing on thin ice Thomas knew, and he knew also that\nbluff was the only feasible strategy to employ against the unforeseen\ncrisis wrought by Bill's sudden and unexpected arrival. \"Don't flatter\nyourself that I mind any question you might ask,\" he emphasized, \"only\nthis one has no bearing on the case.\"\n\nAt this, Townsend sustained the objection. Marvin, resorting to a legal\ntrick, changed the form of the question, for he was bound to prove his\npoint. \"Well, Miss Buckley,\" he asked, \"Mr. Thomas has taken an interest\nin your affairs and given you advice?\"\n\nThe insinuation was more than Millie could bear calmly. She turned\nquickly, meeting his eyes in anger as she flashed a significant smile\ntoward Thomas.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas has been more than kind to me always. He has given me advice\nwhen I had no one else to turn to.\"\n\n\"And you have always followed his advice?\"\n\nFollowing his key, Millie replied, \"Always, implicitly, in spite of what\n_others_--\" and she paused long enough to send a pointed shaft Marvin's\nway--\"have said against him.\"\n\nMarvin grinned and continued, \"Miss Buckley, you have never known Mr.\nJones to be cruel or even unkind to his wife, have you?\"\n\nAn objection from Thomas was overruled, the judge contending that\ncruelty was one of the grounds in the complaint. As he had forgotten how\nthe question read, he asked the stenographer to repeat it. Millie\nanswered in the negative and Marvin prodded her further, \"You have never\nseen him unkind to any one or anything, have you?\"\n\nGentleness had always been such an ever-present quality in Bill's\ntreatment of Millie that she forgot her anger for the moment and\nhastened to reply, as she smiled sweetly at Bill, \"Daddy has always been\nmost kind to me and every one else.\"\n\nThis was an opportunity to lead her into an admission which might\nimmediately quash all of the grounds of the complaint. Marvin saw it at\nonce and took advantage of it. \"Now, Miss Buckley,\" he argued, \"the\ncomplaint asks for a divorce on the grounds of drunkenness, failure to\nprovide and cruelty. In all honesty you know that not one of these is\nthe real reason that Mrs. Jones has asked for a divorce, don't you?\"\n\nUnused to the ways of the law and its peculiar methods of arriving at\nconclusions, Millie was perplexed. The only excuse in her mind for the\ndivorce had been that it would bring about the sale of the property and\nthat Mrs. Jones would thereby have sufficient money with which to find\nBill, which would mean happiness for the three of them. Had Thomas not\nintervened with an objection which the judge sustained, she would have\ngiven her answer, but as it was she remained silent.\n\nMarvin, determined to prove Bill Jones's simple sweetness, so that he\nwould at least be understood by the world, went to his purpose again.\n\n\"Miss Buckley, you know that Mr. Jones loved his wife, loved her\ndevotedly, don't you?\" he asked.\n\nTownsend beamed in judicial humor upon Marvin and laughed. \"How can she\nknow that? That's not an astute question for a lawyer to ask, and I\ndon't sanction such methods.\"\n\nThe question, however, had brought back a certain softness in Millie's\nattitude. Forgetting for the moment her dislike of Marvin, she smiled,\nbut to regret it and to efface the smile with a frown.\n\nHis examination of Millie had been difficult for Marvin. Into his mind\nhad crowded old memories--happy walks along the cliff in San Francisco,\nafternoons in Golden Gate Park, and days in the office when he had dared\nto hope that some day she might learn to care. His heart leaped at the\nthought of moonlight strolls in the mountain woods and along the shores\nof the lake. Those were days when she had interested herself in his\nplans and it all came back to him with desperate force as her\nunintentional smile awakened a poignant longing within him. A whirlwind\nof reminiscent emotion caught him in its teeth.\n\n\"If it please your Honor,\" he said, his eyes shining, \"there is one\nthing that a woman does know, and that is whether a man loves her or\nnot! She may believe a man to be a contemptible liar. She may say that\nshe will hate and despise him always, but somehow down in her heart, if\nhe really loves her, she knows it!\"\n\nForgetting that there was such a place as a court-room, or that he was\ndefending a divorce suit against Bill Jones, all he saw was the scorn in\nthe eyes of the girl he loved. All he felt was that he was fighting\nsingle-handed against overwhelming odds for his own happiness. He leaned\nclose to the witness-chair and looked into the girl's eyes, and she,\nseeing in his eyes the thing that she had tried to forget through all\nthe long and sorrowful months, turned away from him, lest she should\nbetray the longing that lurked in her own heart. But Marvin's fervid\nplea flamed higher and higher and he went on:\n\n\"If a woman is a man's ideal--if he would gladly lay down his life for\nher--she knows it and no matter what she says about him or what anybody\nelse says about him the knowledge that he cares more for her than for\nanything else in the entire universe must count for something, and I\ncontend, your Honor--\"\n\nHe got no farther. The whole court-room was in roars of laughter and the\nsheriff's gavel was knocking loudly on his table. Millie, unable to bear\nthe situation any longer, was sobbing aloud. Townsend arose quickly and,\nleaning over his desk, shook a warning finger at Marvin.\n\n\"Hold on there!\" he called, half in humor and half in anger. \"Are you\ntrying a divorce case or are you making love?\"\n\nThe laughter in the court-room began again, but subsided, for there was\nsomething in the situation that struck deep into the hearts of the\nspectators and they knew that, grotesque as it might appear, shattered\nromance was stalking before them.\n\nMarvin, himself once again, lowered his voice and pleaded,\napologetically: \"I beg your pardon, your Honor. I did not mean to go so\nfar.\" Smiling sadly at Millie, he added, \"That is all, Miss Buckley.\"\n\n\"I should say it is quite enough!\" satirized the judge. \"I think we had\nbetter get back to business.\"\n\nWithout looking at Marvin, Millie left the stand and took her seat\nbeside her mother. Thomas called Everett Hammond as the next witness.\n\nHammond, although outwardly nonchalant, was inwardly ill at ease.\nMarvin's appearance in court followed so closely by Bill's arrival was a\ncontact that puzzled him. Millie's hesitancy as a witness was another\nfeature which he felt was not altogether in favor of the cause of the\nGolden Gate Land Company. During her testimony he had kept close watch\nof her mother, who several times wept audibly, burying her face in her\nhandkerchief. He knew that he and Thomas were playing a close game and\nthat the slightest contradiction in his testimony might set Mrs. Jones\nto thinking in the wrong direction; especially with Bill Jones in the\ncourt-room, his eyes divided between the witness-stand and his wife. He\nassumed an air of bravado as he took the stand, glaring down at Marvin,\nwho was seated not far from him and who was smiling blandly upon him.\n\nPreliminaries over, Thomas launched into Hammond's direct examination.\n\"How long have you known Mr. and Mrs. Jones?\" he asked.\n\n\"I met them first,\" Hammond answered, pausing to think, \"about seven\nmonths ago.\"\n\n\"Kindly tell the court how you happened to meet them.\"\n\nHammond, looking at the judge, answered: \"I was asked to consider the\npurchase of a piece of property belonging to Mrs. Jones. I had some\nother business near by and stopped off at the Joneses' place.\"\n\n\"What was the other business?\" was Thomas's next question. He glanced at\nMarvin, who met his look with straightforward, unswerving eyes, which\nturned Thomas's attention to his witness.\n\n\"The Pacific Railroad,\" said Hammond, scowling at Marvin, \"was being\nrobbed of timber in that locality and they sent me with the sheriff,\" he\nnodded toward Blodgett, who flushed at the memory of that embarrassing\nincident, \"to arrest the thief.\"\n\n\"Who was the thief?\" There was triumph in Thomas's voice as he asked the\nquestion.\n\n\"His name is John Marvin.\"\n\n\"Since that time, you have had dealings with Mrs. Jones, have you not?\"\n\n\"I have, and I have always found her to be an honest and splendid\nwoman.\" Hammond smiled over at her.\n\n\"And Mr. Jones was a source of trouble and great embarrassment to her,\nwasn't he?\"\n\nThis time Hammond made Bill the goal of his insulting focus. \"Yes, sir,\nhe was! He was shiftless and drinking, cruel and untruthful.\" With a\nmalicious sneer he added, \"Why, to my knowledge, he's the biggest liar\nin the county!\"\n\nAll this time, without a word, Bill had been sitting on the edge of his\nchair, accepting the testimony against him in the same indifferent\nmanner in which he met most of life's difficulties. Hammond's last\nremark proved to be the first telling blow at his equanimity. It was too\nmuch! This Hammond person had called him, Bill Jones, a liar! In\nLightnin's code, shrunken and old though he was, there could be but one\nanswer. Calmly and quietly Bill stood up and began to draw his faded\nblue coat from his bent old shoulders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nEvery eye in the court-room was on Bill. There was even a cheer, which\nthe judge, half out of his chair, failed to reprove. Townsend knew that\nBill was sore tried and had been brought to the point where his temper\nwas not an impulse, but a last resort. His personal sympathies were with\nLightnin's fistic intent. However, the order of his court must be\nobserved and he signed to Blodgett, who raised his gavel. Before it was\nnecessary to bring it down upon the table Marvin was quickly on his\nfeet. He put a restraining hand on Bill's arm and with the other hand\ndrew the coat back into its place on the bent shoulders.\n\nIn amused contempt, Thomas continued his examination.\n\n\"Did you ever see Mr. Jones drunk?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I never saw him any other way.\" Hammond laughed lightly.\n\n\"And you saw him abuse his wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You heard him tell lies?\"\n\n\"I did indeed. Why, he broke the law by harboring a fugitive from\njustice in his house.\"\n\nThomas, having brought skilfully to the attention of the court the\nnumerous charges that he hoped would result in securing Mrs. Jones a\ndivorce, dismissed Hammond from the stand.\n\nHis experience as a witness had not been a joyous one to Hammond, and he\nprepared to take quick action on his dismissal, but Marvin had other\nintentions.\n\nStanding between Hammond and his way of escape, Marvin exclaimed: \"I am\nnot through with the witness, Mr. Thomas! I also have some questions to\nask him.\" With a scowl Hammond threw himself back into the chair.\n\n\"You say, Mr. Hammond, that you had business dealings with Mrs. Jones?\nDo you mind telling the court what that business was?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Hammond, defiantly. \"I purchased three hundred and\ntwenty-nine acres of land, including buildings, from Mrs. Jones for some\nclients of mine.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you consult Mr. Jones?\" asked Marvin.\n\n\"Because Mrs. Jones was the sole owner,\" sneered Hammond.\n\nMarvin looked him in the eye and said, slowly:\n\n\"You had seen the records?\"\n\nHammond grunted in acquiescence and Marvin went on, each question\nbringing his victim nearer to an outburst of temper, which he hoped\nwould lead to the self-contradictions he was sparring for.\n\n\"Now you testified that you first met Mr. and Mrs. Jones about seven\nmonths ago. Do you remember the exact date?\"\n\n\"No, I don't recall the exact date. Perhaps you can,\" he emphasized,\nwith a contemptuous twist of his black mustache. \"It was the day I\nbrought the sheriff there with a warrant for your arrest.\"\n\nMarvin, undaunted by this attempt to slander him, took occasion to give\na thrust at Blodgett, who had been glaring at him all through the case.\n\"Possibly the sheriff will remember the date,\" he said, with a smile,\nwhile Blodgett squirmed in his chair. \"And you also met Mr. Thomas on\nthat same day, did you not?\"\n\nHammond made no reply. It was his desire to make the court think that he\nand Thomas had never known each other previous to this transaction. He\ndirected an imploring and searching squint toward Thomas. Receiving no\nhelp and seeing trouble in the gray pallor that had spread over Thomas's\nface, he floundered on, \"Yes, I think that was the day I met Raymond\nThomas--and Miss Buckley was there, too.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you had never met Miss Buckley or Mr. Thomas before? In\nhis office in San Francisco, for instance?\"\n\nHammond hesitated. He had been in Thomas's office several times while\nMillie was employed there, and, though he had not met her, it was more\nthan likely that she had seen him. The moment was dangerous.\n\n\"No, I don't think I had ever met them before,\" he said, slowly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Marvin, nodding his head complacently and going closer\nto the witness-stand.\n\n\"Mr. Hammond,\" he went on, \"you have told the court that Mr. Jones was a\nlawbreaker.\"\n\nHammond fairly jumped to this question. \"Yes,\" he flared. \"You were a\nfugitive from justice and Jones was harboring you in his house.\"\n\nMarvin smiled. \"Didn't you just testify that Mrs. Jones was the sole\nowner of that house? That being so, how could Mr. Jones harbor a\nfugitive in his house, if he didn't own a house?\"\n\nCaught in his own net, Hammond twisted angrily in his chair, reddening\nas the spectators laughed and the sheriff pounded for order.\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose he could,\" he blurted.\n\n\"Then you will withdraw the statement that he broke the law?\"\n\n\"Yes, I withdraw it,\" Hammond drawled.\n\nBill got up smiling from his chair and went over to Marvin, patting him\nproudly on the shoulder; but a look from the judge and a snarl from\nBlodgett sent him back again.\n\nMarvin continued. \"Now, up to the time you met Mr. Jones you did not\nknow anything about him, did you?\"\n\nHammond shrugged, drawing his mouth into an angry curve. \"Of course not,\nbut it didn't take me long to find out about him.\"\n\nMarvin gave the arm of the witness-chair two angry thumps. \"I agree with\nyou there, Mr. Hammond,\" he said. \"Eight hours after you first saw Mr.\nJones he was driven from his house and you have never set eyes on him\nsince. Yet you have testified that he is a drunkard, a loafer, a liar,\nand a lawbreaker!\"\n\nHammond, startled at the swiftness with which Marvin had turned his\ntestimony to profit, shrugged himself into a straight position. \"Well,\nit didn't take me one hour to see what Jones was,\" he said.\n\nMarvin nodded with half-closed eyes at Hammond and smiled reassuringly\nat Bill. \"You also said he was cruel to his wife?\"\n\nHammond nodded.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\nHammond hesitated, moving uneasily from side to side. \"Well,\" he\nsnarled, \"his manner was insulting. He criticized the dress she was\nwearing before the other guests.\"\n\nThis amused the court-room, which in turn had to be quieted. \"And do you\nthink the claim of intolerable cruelty is substantiated by a husband's\ncriticizing his wife's dress?\" asked Marvin, smiling.\n\nThomas arose at once. \"I object to that question,\" he said, his lips\ntwitching and his face livid from disappointment and fear of what was\ncoming next.\n\n\"I should think you would!\" Marvin said, laughing.\n\nThe objection sustained, he went at his witness again. \"You testified\nthat Mr. Jones was a drunkard and that you had never seen him sober?\"\n\n\"I never have,\" emphasized Hammond, insolently.\n\nGoing to the table, Marvin took Bill by the arm, assisted him to his\nfeet and guided him into the middle of the court-room until he stood\nbefore the witness-stand. Then he asked of Hammond, motioning with his\nhead toward Bill, \"Is he drunk now?\"\n\nBill stood quietly, a quizzical smile half closing his eyes, half\nopening his mouth.\n\nHammond, infuriated, swallowed in order to control himself, and then\nblurted with a disgusted shrug of his shoulders, \"I don't know.\"\n\nHaving fulfilled Marvin's intention, Bill took his seat again and the\ncross-examination was resumed.\n\n\"If you don't know whether he is drunk or not now, how did you know the\nother time when you saw him?\"\n\nHammond gazed fiercely into space, replying, finally, \"Oh, it was plain\nenough then!\"\n\nSeeing that Hammond was ruffled and that he was also confused, Marvin\nfelt that the time was now right to bring forth by a few swift,\nwell-put questions the full purpose of Hammond and Thomas in bringing\nabout the divorce between Bill and Mrs. Jones.\n\n\"It was not possible for you to get a good title to the property unless\nMr. Jones signed the deed?\" he asked.\n\nAt once Thomas was on his feet, objecting.\n\nOn Marvin's explanation that the complaint charged intoxication and that\nhis question had a direct bearing on that point, the judge overruled the\nobjection and Thomas took his seat again.\n\nNot discerning the trap that Marvin had set for him, Hammond turned to\nthe judge and said, in more even tones: \"I don't mind answering in the\nleast. The property belonged entirely to Mrs. Jones, but the husband's\nsignature was wanted on the deed.\"\n\n\"And he refused to sign it?\" Marvin's question came back.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hammond sneered, \"after you told him not to.\"\n\nMarvin once more challenged Hammond's soul with the searchlight of his\nown straightforward eye. \"Was he drunk then?\" he asked.\n\nHammond paused, then shrugged his shoulders. \"Yes, I think he was.\"\n\n\"I am not asking you what you think,\" Marvin remarked. \"You said under\noath that you never saw him sober. Was he drunk when he refused to sign\nthat deed?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was!\" Hammond reiterated, quickly.\n\n\"And you tried to induce him to sign such an important document as that\nwhen he was drunk?\" Marvin asked the question in a slow, concise tone\nand looked up at the judge to gather the impression made by Hammond's\nevident duplicity.\n\nThe deep water into which Hammond had walked was making itself felt and\nhe tried to wade toward shore.\n\n\"I never tried to get him to sign! He didn't sign it!\" he snapped.\n\n\"No, he wasn't drunk enough for that! He wasn't drunk at all. He was as\nsober as he is at this moment!\"\n\n\"You mean to call me a liar?\" Hammond, his red neck swelling over the\ntop of his collar, and his small, close-together black eyes flashing\nangrily, got up and made a threatening move toward his questioner.\n\nMarvin, although much smaller, did not flinch. \"No, I mean to _prove_\nit,\" he answered.\n\nJudge Townsend made a quieting gesture to Hammond, who sat down in the\nwitness-chair again as Marvin went on with his rapid-fire.\n\n\"Now you called Mr. Jones a liar, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was Hammond's gruff reply. \"And everybody who knows him says the\nsame thing!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Marvin, with a shake of his head. \"So you testified that he\nwas a liar because you heard others say so?\"\n\n\"No,\" jerked Hammond, \"he lied to me.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you that was untrue?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" said Hammond.\n\n\"Can you repeat one lie that Mr. Jones told you?\"\n\n\"Oh, he told me so many,\" was the impatient reply, \"I can't recall them.\nOh yes,\" after a pause, \"he said he drove a swarm of bees across the\nplains in the dead of winter.\"\n\nBill, who was facing him, and who had not taken his eyes from him, burst\ninto a loud laugh, the whole court-room, even to the judge, following\nsuit, while Marvin raised his voice above the uproar to ask, \"Now, how\ndo you know that is a lie?\"\n\n\"Why, I know the thing is impossible!\" Hammond said, contemptuously.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It's all nonsense,\" sneered Hammond, with an angry gesture.\n\n\"That is precisely what it is, Mr. Hammond, and that is just what Mr.\nJones meant it to be! What else did he say?\"\n\n\"What's the difference?\" asked Hammond. \"You admit it's all nonsense.\"\n\n\"Not all, Mr. Hammond.\" Marvin raised his voice and he looked\nsearchingly at the judge. \"He said at least one thing that was not\nnonsense. He said to his wife, 'Mother, these two men are trying to rob\nyou.' Do you remember that, Mr. Hammond? You were all there. Do you\nremember that he said you and Mr. Thomas were trying to rob Mrs. Jones?\"\n\nIn order to make his question more impressive, Marvin nodded at Hammond\nand pointed to Mr. Thomas, and then directed a glance toward Mrs. Jones.\nHer hands were still folded in her lap and her head bent toward them.\n\nEverett Hammond, his face purple with rage, shouted at Marvin, \"I don't\npropose to sit here and be insulted by a criminal like you!\"\n\nThomas, too, had risen and come forward. Standing on the other side of\nMarvin and looking down upon him, he exclaimed, with quivering, blue\nlips: \"This is insufferable, your Honor! This gentleman has come here to\ngive disinterested testimony, as a favor, and he is subjected to the\ninsults--\"\n\nJudge Townsend interrupted him calmly: \"I think the defense has brought\nout quite clearly that this witness's testimony is not disinterested.\nThis divorce has got to be obtained to give him a deed to the Jones\nproperty, hasn't it?\"\n\nThomas grew conciliatory, endeavoring to impress upon the judge that the\nproperty sale had nothing to do, at all, with the testimony of Hammond.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't call him exactly disinterested,\" responded Townsend,\nwith a wise glance.\n\n\"Nevertheless, your Honor, I protest against this man's insulting\nmanner,\" Thomas shouted. \"How it is possible for such a person, a person\nwho even now ought to be serving a jail sentence, to be admitted to the\nbar, I can't see!\" He backed to his chair and sat down, taking up a\nbook and slamming it back on the table.\n\nUntil now Marvin had been complete master of the situation, but Thomas's\nlast words drove the blood from his face and he grew troubled as he\nlooked up at the judge and then away and out through the window into\nspace. There had been something on his mind, but he had been able to\nkeep it in the background because of Bill's predicament. And now it came\nto the surface again.\n\nTownsend studied Marvin intently for several moments and then he asked,\nquietly, \"You are an attorney in good standing, are you not?\"\n\nAt the judge's question, Thomas got up and looked down upon Marvin, in\ninsolent inquiry.\n\nMarvin did not answer at once; then he walked over to the judge's bench\nand with his head bowed said, \"No, your Honor, I am not.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you are not a member of the bar?\" There was\nsurprise and injured dignity and at the same time a strong savor of pity\nin Lem Townsend's voice.\n\nThomas and Hammond exchanged smiles of triumph, the former advancing to\na place by Marvin's side in front of the judge.\n\nThe horror in Millie's face told Marvin that her last shred of\nconsideration for him had been torn away.\n\nBill alone held faith, smiling encouragement at the lad who had been his\nonly friend when his hour was at its worst.\n\nWith eyes on the ground, slowly, and in low voice, Marvin explained,\n\"No, I have never been admitted to the bar, your Honor. But Mr. Jones\nhad taken a long journey from the Soldiers' Home, on his own account and\nat his own expense, to testify in my case. When, without warning, this\naction for divorce was called, I knew it was a conspiracy.\" The\ninjustice accorded Bill drew Marvin from himself again. Pointing at\nHammond and Thomas, he raised his voice. \"I knew that these two\nconspirators--\"\n\nThomas interrupted him by jumping from his seat and making a menace with\nhis right arm.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Thomas,\" Townsend commanded. \"I will attend to this. You\nare making a very serious charge, Mr. Marvin, and if you believe you can\nsubstantiate it you will find the courts open to you. In the mean time\nyou must be aware that you had no right whatever to undertake the trial\nof this case under the guise of being an attorney. You are guilty of a\nreprehensible act, and if I did not believe there were mitigating\ncircumstances I would punish you most severely for contempt of court.\"\nHe ordered the stenographer to strike out all of the cross-examination.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas,\" he asked, \"have you finished with your witness?\"\n\n\"If the cross-examination is to be stricken out, I will not take up the\ncourt's time with any redirect testimony. We have had enough,\" Thomas\nsaid.\n\nHammond got up and shook himself as if he were rid of a heavy burden;\nbut as he walked from the stand Marvin made one more plea. \"One moment,\nplease, your Honor,\" he asked. \"Before the witness is excused--\"\n\nTownsend interrupted him. \"You have no standing in this court, young\nman. If you wish to remain, you may take a seat on the visitors' bench,\"\nand he pointed to a vacant seat just outside of the railing.\n\nIf there was one person in the court-room who was pleased at that\nmoment, it was Blodgett. He arose, caressing his mustache, and opened\nthe gate.\n\n\"This way,\" he called out, giving an overbearing wave of his hand.\n\nAs he came to the gate, Marvin stopped. He was thinking hard. It did not\nseem right that Bill should be left alone to fight his way with those\ntwo keen schemers. He knew that Lem Townsend would look after Lightnin'\nin so far as he could justifiably do so, but the figure of the lonely\nold man, smiling complacently in the midst of his trouble, touched\nMarvin deeply, and he delved into his mind in an effort to find a way to\nhelp him.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, Lightnin' solved the problem. Getting to his feet,\nhe stood quietly before the bench, looking up at Townsend with an odd\nexcitement in his eyes.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he asked, in his usual drawl, \"a defendant has the right\nto plead his own case, ain't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has,\" Townsend replied, with a nod.\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill, \"I guess I'll plead this case myself!\"\n\nMarvin hesitated. He had thought of this himself, of course, but had\ndismissed the idea, not feeling quite sure as to the advisability of it.\nNow, however, the deed was done. Quickly he put an arm over Bill's\nshoulder and led him beside the witness-stand, where Hammond still sat.\nBill looked up at Townsend and smiled.\n\n\"It's all right, Judge,\" he remarked, with his humorous twinkle. \"I was\na lawyer once!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThe court-room fairly seethed with interest. The crowd was smiling,\namused; but, under the surface smile, every face reflected a strong\nsympathy for the quaint old figure standing there, about to fight his\nown battle. As Bill turned to conduct his case, Blodgett took Marvin by\nthe arm.\n\n\"You come out here!\" he commanded, roughly.\n\nMarvin pulled his arm free and appealed to the judge.\n\n\"I am a witness for the defense, your Honor,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you may remain where you are,\" replied Townsend, with a nod. He\nlooked at Lightnin'. \"Examine your witness,\" he directed.\n\nFor a moment Lightnin' stood in front of the frowning man in the chair\nand silently inspected him with humorous interest, from the top of his\nsleek, pomaded head to the gleaming toes of his immaculate boots.\n\n\"Looks kinder all polished up, don't he?\" Bill remarked.\n\nThe noise of the general laughter and the pounding of the sheriff's\ngavel seemed to distract Townsend's attention; anyway, he uttered no\nobjection when Marvin slipped from his place among the witnesses and\ndropped into his former chair directly behind Bill. Looking up at\nTownsend, Lightnin' resumed:\n\n\"The things Marvin asked him were all right, your Honor,\" he said. Then,\nwith a terse but rather humorous shrug, he addressed Hammond, \"Answer\n'em!\"\n\n\"You mean the testimony he has already given will stand?\" asked the\njudge.\n\n\"I got a right to ask 'em again, 'ain't I?\" questioned Bill.\n\nTownsend nodded. Hammond could much better stand the young and impatient\nmanner of John Marvin than he could the wise humor of Bill. He grew red\nand shifted in his chair angrily, asking the judge:\n\n\"Do I have to go all over that, your Honor?\"\n\n\"Would your replies be the same?\" Townsend's eyes as well as his\nquestion begged Hammond for the answer and he was not comfortable. But\nthere was nothing else for him to do, and after a moment's hesitation,\nin which he lowered his lids to avoid the judge's scrutiny, he replied:\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nThe cross-examination reinstated, Hammond for the fourth time started to\nleave the stand. Bill held up his hand and snapped in a determined tone,\nbut with a smile playing among the wrinkles of his face:\n\n\"Hold on! I got some more for you!\"\n\nHis victim threw himself back into the chair with a shrug and a sneer as\nhe gave his head an irate shake.\n\n\"Mr. Hammond,\" Bill went on, \"when you went after Mr. Marvin with the\nsheriff, what was the charge against him?\"\n\nHammond answered, with a ready enthusiasm, \"Trespassing on the property\nof the Pacific Railroad Company.\"\n\nBill nodded his head and said:\n\n\"Uh, ha.\"\n\nHe assumed an air of wisdom and raised his voice to the pitch that it\nseldom knew, but to have the floor again after so many months was having\nits effect upon him and he was taking the task in the same way and with\nthe same glee as if it were the opportunity for telling a good story.\n\n\"If he was on their property,\" he began--then he seemed to forget what\nit was he was going to ask. He turned to Marvin in whispered conference.\nThe unusual character of his procedure did not affect Lemuel Townsend,\nwho was anxious to give the old man his full chance.\n\nHis way evidently made clearer by Marvin's advice, Bill sauntered slowly\nback to Hammond.\n\n\"If he was on the railroad's property, what did you have to do with it?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Oh, that's easy enough!\" said Hammond, nonchalantly crossing one leg\nover the other. \"I went at the request of the president of the road.\"\n\nBill grinned. \"You sold the railroad the land he was trespassing on,\ndidn't you?\"\n\nThomas broke in with an endeavor to show that the question was\nirrelevant, but Townsend, knowing Bill's natural acumen, felt that the\nquestion did have some real connection with the case.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas,\" he said, \"you and your witness have been accused of\nconspiracy. If I were you, I would allow him to answer Mr. Jones.\"\n\nThomas knew that he was sparring for his life and he didn't intend to\nlet the question get by if he could help it, so he tried another\nsubterfuge.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he deplored, his voice hoarse with anger, \"I don't propose\nto defend the witness and myself from such a ridiculous charge at this\ntime. We are not on trial. This is a divorce action.\" He glared at\nMarvin, pulling his cuffs angrily, in a way that he had, down over his\nwrists.\n\nBut the judge's opinion was unchanged. \"If there is any conspiracy about\nthis action, the court wants to know it. Answer the question.\"\n\nWith an insulting drawl, Hammond did as he was bid.\n\n\"I purchased the property for the railroad, acting as their agent.\"\n\n\"Who did you buy it from?\" Bill snapped.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas.\"\n\n\"When did you buy it?\" asked Bill.\n\n\"About ten months ago.\"\n\nBill's shoulders straightened at Hammond's reply and he drew himself\ntogether with a quick shrug, taking a swift step forward and peering\ninto Hammond's face.\n\n\"That was three months before you bought mother's place?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" jerked Hammond, sulkily.\n\n\"Then, why did you say you had never met him until you met him at the\nhotel?\"\n\nHammond started, alarm in the quick glance that traveled from Bill to\nRaymond Thomas. He realized he had overstepped himself. Thinking the\nbetter plan would be to brave it out, he bellowed:\n\n\"Because I never did!\"\n\nBill smiled at him and said, in his slow, gentle monotone:\n\n\"You bought all that land of him and never saw him about it?\" He looked\nup at the judge and laughed. \"And he called _me_ a liar!\"\n\nHammond got up, but Bill detained him. \"Don't go away,\" he admonished,\nwith a jaunty toss of his head. \"We got some more for you, 'ain't we?\"\nand he looked at Marvin, who smiled in approval. \"I've got a good one\nfor him!\" Bill went on.\n\n\"You know the railroad company leased the waterfall on mother's place\nand put a power-plant there?\"\n\n\"I believe they have,\" said Hammond, impatiently.\n\n\"And you know that the railroad pays you more for that lease in a month\nthan you agreed to give mother in a year?\"\n\nIt was a surprise to Hammond, and evidently to Marvin, too, that Bill\nshould know anything of the details of either the lease of the railroad\ncompany or of what payment had been promised to Mrs. Jones. A great\nlight flashed on Marvin--obviously Bill Jones had not been altogether\nwasting his time during his prolonged disappearance! Hammond, beginning\nto suspect that Bill knew more than he had been given credit for,\ndecided that ignorance was the best stand to take.\n\n\"How should I know the petty details of the railroad's lease?\" he said.\n\n\"How should _you_ know?\" echoed Bill, his voice raised, unwontedly clear\nand ringing. \"Didn't the railroad lease the waterfall from a bum concern\ncalled the Golden Gate Land Company? Didn't you, actin' for the Golden\nGate Company, put through the deal? Don't you know that the Golden Gate\nLand Company is controlled by yourself and Raymond Thomas--ain't you and\nThomas the whole works o' that--\"\n\nThomas was on his feet with an objection, but the judge had no\nopportunity to overrule it, for Bill had something to say and he was\ngoing to say it. He lifted his voice above that of Thomas, calling out\nand waving his arms violently in an excitement he had never known\nbefore.\n\n\"And all your stocks in the name of rummies?\"\n\nHis eyes twinkled as Marvin came up to him and whispered. Again waving\nhis arms, Bill shouted:\n\n\"Dummies, I mean--dummies!\"\n\nThomas had been tried to the point of despair. There was a lump in his\nthroat as he beseeched the judge:\n\n\"I protest against this!\"\n\nThe judge interrupted him. \"I am beginning to believe in this plot\nstory.\"\n\n\"Then let him go on,\" was Bill's agreeable reply.\n\nHammond jumped up out of his chair and descended from the witness-stand.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he said, in an angry tone, \"I absolutely refuse to submit\nto this any longer--to stand here and be made to look like a criminal!\"\n\nBill could not withstand the chance for another quip and he smiled at\nhis antagonist. \"Well, you look natural,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Do you expect me to stand for this?\" Hammond stormed.\n\n\"Sit down, if you want to,\" said Bill, restored to his old nonchalance.\n\"I'm through with you,\" and he turned his back on Hammond and went over\nto Marvin.\n\nThomas, keyed to a high pitch, knew that something must be done at once,\nfor he saw that not only the Jones case was crumbling, but he sensed\ntrouble ahead in his afternoon's venture, so he resorted to Everett\nHammond's tactics of placing the matter in an absurd light.\n\n\"All this ridiculous testimony,\" he argued, \"has no possible connection\nwith the case in point, but I propose to prove that all the accusations\nagainst the witness and myself are not only groundless but absolutely\nmalicious, and I shall do this at the first opportunity.\"\n\nUnable to stand the situation any longer, he went back and took his\nseat.\n\nMarvin had sat quiet all through this controversy. Now he forgot the\njudge's admonition as to his place in the case. He got up, stating to\nthe judge:\n\n\"Your Honor, Mr. Thomas will have that opportunity at two o'clock this\nafternoon, when the Pacific Railroad's action against me comes before\nthe court. At that time I will submit documentary proof that these men\ncontrol the Golden Gate Land Company and have been buying up all the\nland wanted by the Pacific Railroad. I will submit to the court twenty\ncases where the Golden Gate Land Company has swindled innocent farmers\nout of their property and paid them with worthless stock. I will prove\nto the court--\"\n\n\"Just a moment, Mr. Marvin,\" Townsend stopped him. \"It will be most\ninteresting for you to prove your statements at two o'clock; but in the\nmean time I must warn you again that you are not a party to this divorce\naction and have no standing as an attorney in this court.\"\n\nMarvin bowed to the ruling and retired quietly to his seat. He stared\ncalmly at Thomas, seeming to have no fear that he had prematurely\nrevealed his own case and that his opponents might have an opportunity\nto take advantage of his statements.\n\n\"If the defense wishes you for a witness, Mr. Marvin,\" said Townsend,\n\"you may be sworn.\"\n\nBill was on his feet again and, turning to the judge, said: \"I don't\nneed no witness! I didn't know nothing about it at all until I got here,\nbut I've been thinking it over ever since and I have made up my mind\nthat mother's right. If mother can prove them things they read,\" and he\nnodded toward the clerk, \"she could get a divorce, couldn't she?\"\n\nTownsend replied in the affirmative. Bill smiled sadly and, glancing at\nMrs. Jones, who was crying as if her heart would break, he went on,\n\"Well, I can prove them for her.\"\n\n\"You can prove them?\" Townsend asked, in surprise.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Bill, with a flash of humor. \"I used to be a judge.\"\n\nHe stood still in the middle of the floor and looked into space for a\nmoment. He was a dejected figure as the humor that was his habit left\nhim and he stood there deserted by all but Marvin. But it was not his\nway to remain an object of pity, either to himself or to anybody else,\nand with a slight shrug he straightened and looked the judge in the eye.\nPlacing his hand in front of him, he tolled off the first count on the\nthumb of his right hand.\n\n\"Now, first it said,\" he began didactically, \"that I got drunk,\" and he\npaused and thought about it, adding, with a nod, \"Well, I can prove\nthat! And then it said I was cruel to mother.\" He took a step forward\nand bent his shoulders a bit, as if he would look under the brim of his\nwife's hat and search her soul for the answer to his plea. \"Well, I\ncan--no, I can't prove that, 'cause it ain't true, judge, an' I don't\nbelieve mother ever said it.\"\n\nA dramatic hush fell in the court-room. It was suddenly, pathetically\nclear to Marvin and to many others that, despite his unexpected\nknowledge on other counts, Bill did not fathom the real reason behind\nhis wife's action for divorce. Plainly he thought she really wanted a\ndivorce, and, in Lightnin's sensitive code, if mother wanted it she\nshould have it.\n\n\"An' then it said that I failed to provide,\" he went on, while the\ncourt-room breathed softly, feeling the tug at the old man's\nheartstrings. \"Well, that what's on my mind, judge. I have failed. I\nnever thought anything about it before, and I don't see any chance of\nproviding, now that I do think about it. Mother an' Millie could get\nalong better without me. So you see, mother should get a divorce,\njudge--\" and here Bill for the first time in his life broke down. Tears\ncame into his eyes and he swallowed to keep them back. He hesitated and,\nwith a last brave effort, he dashed in to complete his testimony against\nhimself.\n\n\"I'm all right, judge. I can go back to the Home and stay there\nuntil\"--he hesitated--\"until--\" and turning quickly away, \"that's all,\njudge.\"\n\nBefore he could get to his seat Mrs. Jones had jumped up from hers and\nwas standing before the judge's desk, wiping the tears from her eyes and\nsobbing loudly.\n\n\"No, please, judge, don't give me a divorce! I don't want one, judge! I\ncan take care of Bill in our old age. They were just telling me lies,\njudge, and I was a fool not to have seen through it!\"\n\nTears were in Townsend's eyes; also, Margaret Davis was sniffing\naudibly, and the spectators in the court-room were deeply touched.\nThomas and Hammond gave one glance at each other and groaned, while Mrs.\nJones rushed to Bill and held one of his hands in both of hers,\npleading:\n\n\"Bill, I have done you a wrong--a great wrong, and I cannot blame you if\nyou never look at me again, but I didn't mean to, Bill, I didn't mean\nto! And if you will forgive me and take me back I will try all my life\nto make up for it! Will you?\"\n\nBill took her hands in his and patted them. His eyes were moist, and\nthey blinked for a moment; then a slow, happy grin spread over his\nstubbled face.\n\n\"That's all right, mother,\" he said, easily. \"Say, did you ever get the\nsix dollars I sent you?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nLate that afternoon John Marvin and Bill Jones came out of the Reno\ncourt-house together and sauntered down the street. There was a gleam of\ntriumph in Marvin's eyes and a deep satisfaction in his manner.\nLightnin's grin was equally expressive.\n\n\"You better come right back to Calivada with me, John!\" he urged.\n\nThe triumph left Marvin's eyes and was replaced by a troubled\nexpression.\n\n\"No, Bill,\" he said, quietly, \"I don't think it is time for me to go\nthere yet. Mother and Millie may still feel that my part in the whole\nscheme was not as kindly as it might have been, so I'll just drive over\nto my cabin and maybe later, perhaps to-morrow morning, come over and\njoin you for a visit of an hour or two. It's a long time, old chap,\" he\nsaid, as he patted Bill on the shoulder, \"since you have been home, and\nI think it is about time you were running along.\"\n\nBill knew what was deterring him. Tactfully he said nothing, but smiled.\nThey walked along in silence for a block or two, until in a jeweler's\nwindow Bill saw something that appealed to his imagination. He put his\nhand in his pocket and withdrew it before it touched bottom, realizing\nthat his last dime had gone for a cup of coffee for himself and Zeb at a\nlunch-counter early that morning. Zeb was waiting for him at the G. A.\nR. Hall up the street a ways, but he had a duty to perform and it\nseemed to him that that duty could best be done by the help of the\nobject in the jeweler's window.\n\n\"John, will you lend me two dollars?\" he asked.\n\n\"At your old tricks, Lightnin'? You bet I can lend you two dollars! You\nsure that's all you want?\" Marvin laughed, taking the money from his\npocket.\n\n\"Plenty,\" was Bill's brief reply, pocketing the two dollars. They walked\nto the corner of the street, where they said good-by to each other.\n\nWhen Bill was satisfied that Marvin's back was well turned he sauntered\ninto the jewelry-shop and up to the counter, where he purchased a\nsterling-silver ring, washed in gold, with a bright, shining piece of\nglass set in it.\n\nThe clerk in the store smiled at the old man as he pocketed the\nmonstrosity and went happily out of the store.\n\nHow to get to Calivada from Reno had not entered his mind. It was a good\nseventy-five miles, but he knew that some way or other he would get\nhome that night. With his mind made up to that issue, he wandered up the\nstreet and joined Zeb, who had been waiting for him all afternoon. The\ntwo old men, arm in arm, stood on the street corner and looked about.\nAnd just then Rodney Harper and his wife, who were interested spectators\nin the court-room during the afternoon trial, turned the corner in their\nmachine and stopped to say a good word to Bill.\n\n\"What you going to do, Lightnin'?\" asked Harper, while his wife beamed\nat the two odd old souls.\n\n\"What _you_ going to do?\" was Bill's evasive answer.\n\n\"Why, we are motoring back to Calivada, where we have a room at the\nhotel,\" said Mrs. Harper.\n\n\"Well, then, I guess,\" said Bill, putting his foot on the step of the\nautomobile, \"that's just what me and Zeb is goin' to do.\"\n\nThe Harpers laughed and looked at each other. They were both agreed.\nBill and Zeb climbed in and made a strange couple on the back seat of\nthe car as it whirled through the streets of Reno and on up into the\nhills.\n\nIn the mean time the hotel at Calivada, true to its nature, was the\nscene of a new sensation.\n\nAfter court that afternoon Margaret Davis and Judge Townsend, leaving\nMrs. Jones and Millie to take the train home, went their own way. About\neight o'clock that evening they arrived at the hotel, going to the desk\nwhere the sleek and dapper new clerk awaited them and came forward to\nwelcome them. \"Hello, Mrs. Davis!\" he said, extending his hand.\n\n\"Good evening,\" Margaret replied, giggling and looking coyly back at the\njudge. \"Will you give me my key, Mr. Peters?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said, taking the key from the rack and handing it to her with\na smirk.\n\n\"I didn't expect you back to-night.\" He smiled.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't expecting it myself.\" The annoyance evidenced by the\nfrown on Lemuel Townsend's face immediately changed her tone. With a\n\"Thank you\" she turned to go, but the clerk had other plans.\n\n\"This has been a wonderful day, Mrs. Davis,\" he said, as he cast\nlanguishing glances at her. Townsend was not at all pleased with the\nattention Peters was showing her and he turned, asking, unctuously, \"See\nhere, have you got a suite?\"\n\nPeters stepped back and looked in surprise from one to the other.\n\n\"Got what?\"\n\n\"Got a--?\" repeated Townsend, but his question was broken into by\nMargaret, who exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Peters, we would like to see Miss Buckley and Mrs. Jones.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said; \"I will go up and tell them you are here,\" and he\ndisappeared up the Nevada stairs.\n\n\"But, young man,\" Townsend was insisting as he put his foot on the first\nstair, \"I want to get a--\" he reiterated, but Margaret again placed a\nrestraining hand on his arm. \"Wait until he comes down,\" she simpered.\n\nAs the clerk disappeared behind the porti\u00c3\u00a8res at the top of the stairs,\nTownsend turned to Margaret, putting his arm about her waist. \"What's\nthe matter, dear? Don't you want the clerk to know we are married?\" he\nasked, in injured tones.\n\n\"I didn't want you to tell him right before me.\"\n\nHe looked into her eyes. \"You are not ashamed of it, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she drawled, in her usual giggle, \"but it is embarrassing to leave\nhere this morning to get rid of number one and come back this evening\nwith number two.\" Townsend started, removing his arm from her waist.\nPutting it back, she pouted, \"You are not angry, are you, dear?\"\n\nIndulgently, but not enthusiastically, he answered, \"It is a little\njarring to be referred to as number two.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that!\" she exclaimed, leaning coquettishly on his\nshoulder. \"But I can't bear to have every one staring at us.\"\n\n\"But this isn't a secret marriage, Maggie,\" said the judge.\n\nAt this Margaret drew herself away from him, horror in her opened mouth\nand widening eyes. \"Oh, don't say that!\" she protested. \"My name is\nMargaret,\" adding, sweetly, \"I don't mind if they find out about it\nafter we are gone, dear, but let's try to keep them from finding it out\nto-night.\"\n\n\"All right, my darling, just as you say,\" and he drew her to him again.\nPeters reappeared at the stairs.\n\n\"Mrs. Jones will be down in a minute,\" he announced, and was going to\nsay more, but the sight of Margaret locked close in Lemuel Townsend's\ndignified arms permitted him no further expression than a prolonged and\nastonished \"Oh!\" which wrought a quick parting of the loving couple,\nwhile Margaret, blushing furiously, hastened to explain: \"Judge Townsend\nis my husband, Mr. Peters. We were married this afternoon.\"\n\nPeters had been having much of his own way since Mrs. Jones and Millie\nhad retired from the actual management of the hotel, and his authority\nran away with him at times, thrusting him into situations in which his\nassumption brought him quick rebuke. This was one of them. Obsequiously\nand with an easy laugh he extended a congratulatory hand to Townsend,\nwhile he remarked, \"Quick work, eh, judge?\"\n\nTownsend stood back and withered Peters with a glance that did its full\nduty from head to foot.\n\nMargaret, kind-hearted, and seeing Peters's embarrassment, hastened to\nbe friendly. \"We don't want you to say a word about it to anybody!\"\n\n\"Oh, I can keep a secret. My congratulations. I hope this one turns out\nbetter than the other one did,\" Peters effused.\n\nMargaret sighed. The judge shuddered. It was the fourth time since they\nwere married that he had been reminded that he was number two.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" he ordered, severely, \"we won't discuss that\nquestion.\"\n\nMargaret, anxious to prevent further repartee on the subject, went\nup-stairs, calling back, \"When Mrs. Jones comes down, will you tell her\nI will be back in five minutes?\"\n\nWhen she had disappeared Townsend ordered Peters to get up a special\nsupper for four, suggesting that the champagne he had brought with him,\nand which was in the basket on the floor, be put on ice. Peters\ndisappeared to do his duty, but Townsend followed close behind him,\ndesirous of directing the spreading of a good wedding supper for Mrs.\nTownsend, Mrs. Jones, and Millie.\n\nHe had been gone but a few minutes when Mrs. Jones came down the stairs.\nShe looked around, expecting to find Margaret Davis awaiting her. Not\nseeing her, she returned to the floor above, when Mr. and Mrs. Harper\ncame bursting in.\n\n\"How do you do? Don't you remember us?\" Harper called out, as he held\nforth a welcoming hand.\n\n\"Surely!\" cried Mrs. Jones. She came quickly down the stairs and shook\nhands with Harper, kissing his pretty wife.\n\n\"We just brought your husband and a friend of his over from Reno,\" said\nHarper.\n\n\"Oh, where are they?\" Mrs. Jones asked, excitedly. She had been waiting\nall afternoon for Bill and was beginning to fear lest he had decided not\nto return home.\n\n\"Oh, Bill's out there telling his experiences as a lawyer,\" Harper\nlaughed, and Mrs. Jones joined him, happy to know that Bill was back,\nthe same lovable old boaster as before.\n\nMargaret Townsend, hearing the voices, hurried to join the group,\nthrowing her arms wildly around Mrs. Jones's neck and giggling like a\nschool-girl.\n\n\"Who do you think drove me over?\" she asked Mrs. Jones, answering\nherself. \"Judge Townsend.\"\n\n\"My, but that was romantic!\" exclaimed Mrs. Jones.\n\n\"Why, what do you know about it?\" Margaret simpered, putting Mrs. Jones\nfrom her and looking into her eyes.\n\nThe dining-room door opened and Townsend burst in, going to his wife and\nexercising his new proprietorship by putting his arm about her. She drew\naway, blushing, and hastened to introduce the Harpers.\n\nTownsend acknowledged the introduction; then he turned to Mrs. Jones.\n\"I'm very glad to see you under more pleasant circumstances, mother,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Thank you, Lem!\" she answered, tears gathering in her eyes. \"Oh, what a\nmean fool I was! But, Lem, I 'ain't heard a word yet about how that fine\nyoung man made out--I'm just dyin' to know if John Marvin won his case!\"\n\n\"Oh, you really haven't heard?\" exclaimed Margaret. \"I should say he\ncertainly did win his case, my dear!\"\n\n\"Thomas and Hammond were lucky to keep out of jail,\" said Townsend.\n\"They gave up this place without a murmur.\"\n\n\"What?\" Mrs. Jones gasped.\n\n\"Surely you know that the place is yours again?\" Harper asked, while\nthey all nodded eager confirmation.\n\n\"Ours again?\" Mrs. Jones repeated, excitedly.\n\n\"Absolutely, my dear!\" Margaret hastened to explain. \"And the judge and\nI were married this afternoon!\" Irrespective of Mrs. Jones's bewildered\ngasp, Margaret rushed on: \"And, mother, you are to get all the money the\nrailroad pays for the waterfall, and it's an awful lot! The Golden Gate\nLand Company is a fake concern! To keep out of jail, where they belong,\nthose two sharpers are making restitution at once to Mr. Marvin and to\neverybody else they can! And now you're going to have supper with us,\nmother! Mr. and Mrs. Harper are going to join us--and you, too, Millie\ndear,\" she added, turning to the girl, who had joined the group and\nstood there listening, her cheeks flushed with a conflict of emotions.\n\n\"Oh!\" Millie gasped. \"Oh--then what--\"\n\nWhat Millie was going to say was lost in a general chorus of delighted\nexclamations.\n\n\"Oh, Lem,\" cried Mrs. Jones, \"won't you let me do the cooking? I'm just\ndyin' to get back into that kitchen again!\"\n\n\"Well, I know what your cooking is like, mother,\" replied Townsend,\nsmiling; \"and if you really want to go out there and cook that supper, I\nsay it would be a crime to stop you!\"\n\n\"Let's all help!\" exclaimed little Mrs. Harper, who looked as if she\nwould not have the faintest idea what to do in a kitchen.\n\n\"Fine!\" echoed her amused husband. \"Come on, folks!\"\n\nMrs. Jones led the way, and they all went out through the dining-room\nand into the kitchen, bent on making a home of the place for the first\ntime since the new regime went into effect.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThe dapper Peters was left alone at his desk, but not for long. In a\nfew minutes the street door opened and Bill Jones, with a certain air\nabout him--one might even say with a certain flourish in his\nmanner--sauntered in. He ambled up to the desk.\n\n\"Who might you be?\" he asked, casually, his half-shut eyes making an\ninventory of Peters.\n\n\"I'm the manager!\" Peters snapped.\n\n\"No, you ain't,\" said Bill, grinning.\n\n\"What's the reason I ain't?\" inquired Peters.\n\n\"Because you're fired,\" said Bill, calmly, turning his back and putting\nhis hands in his pockets. He gazed slowly around from floor to ceiling,\nand then at the walls. Peters came from behind the desk and stood close\nto him.\n\n\"Say, Mrs. Jones pulled something like that on me,\" he said, \"but I\nain't taking no orders from you people! I take my orders from Mr.\nHammond!\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" asked Bill, nonchalantly. Drawing a letter from his\npocket, he handed it to the clerk. \"Well, here they are!\" he said.\n\nPeters opened the letter and read it.\n\n\"Well, if I'm fired,\" he sighed, \"I suppose I can go back to my old\njob.\"\n\nA stealthy foot on the floor made Bill turn around to greet Zeb, who had\nput his head in the door.\n\n\"Got a segar for me, Bill?\" Zeb whispered.\n\nBill went over to the drawer in the California desk, where he knew there\nwas a box of cigars. He took one, extending it to Zeb. But the latter,\nlooking toward the dining-room, saw Millie coming, and in spite of the\nfact that he wanted that cigar as desperately as he had ever wanted\nanything, force of habit sent him scuttling out of the room as he warned\nBill, hoarsely, \"Look out!\"\n\nBill called him back. \"What you 'fraid of? It's only Millie.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Zeb, intrepid enough to grab the cigar, but not brave\nenough to stay, \"I'll see you to-morrow, when the women-folks is\nworking. It's safer then.\"\n\nMillie rushed over and took Bill in her arms, kissing him again and\nagain, while Bill, unused to such demonstration, tried to disengage\nhimself.\n\n\"Did you just get here, daddy?\" she asked, gazing fondly at him.\n\n\"Yes,\" was his reply, as he sat down in the chair in front of the\ntable.\n\n\"Have you seen mother?\" she asked, standing very close to him.\n\nBill, remembering the old days when his return home meant a searching\nexamination as to soberness, grinned, and then he breathed deeply toward\nher. \"I 'ain't had a drink in a month,\" he informed her.\n\nShe laughed and was silent for a moment. Looking down at the floor, she\nasked, \"Did you come alone, daddy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, slowly scrutinizing her. \"Why didn't you speak to\nJohn before you left the court to-day?\" he asked, after a moment in\nwhich he gazed at her intently.\n\nTears came into her eyes and she leaned her head on his shoulder. \"I\njust couldn't, daddy, that was all.\"\n\nBill placed a reassuring hand on her hair.\n\n\"Well, it's all right. I fixed it for you,\" he said, slowly. Millie\nstepped back aghast, blushing violently. \"You did _what_?\"\n\nBut Bill was unabashed. \"I got him to promise he would come over here\nand see you.\" Bill had done no such thing, but the one flaw to a perfect\nhappiness for him was the thought that John Marvin and Millie might not\nmake up.\n\n\"You asked him to come over and see me?\" Millie asked, in dismay.\n\n\"No,\" said Bill, with a quiet grin; \"I just told him you were crazy to\nsee him. You would have lost him if it hadn't been for me. Every girl in\nReno is crazy about John, but I got him so he's willing to marry you.\"\n\n\"Oh, daddy, I don't know what I am going to do with you!\" Millie was\nalmost in tears and leaned dejectedly on a shoulder indifferent through\nhabit and not will.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you asked John Marvin to marry me?\" she pouted.\n\n\"Sure I did,\" said Bill, untouched by any thought of having done what\nwas not right. \"It was a tough job after the way you treated him,\" he\nadmonished, dropping into the chair and tipping it back while he clasped\nhis hands behind his head and whistled. \"I told him,\" he went on, \"that\nyou had made a fool of yourself, but that most women did that now and\nthen, and not to mind it. After he's been married awhile he'll get used\nto it. I asked him, if you would own up that you were wrong like mother\ndid, would he give you another chance?\" Bill looked up at her, adding,\ncomplacently, \"'Ain't I done a good piece of business?\"\n\nMillie gave one shriek and ran up the stairs. Bill, unmoved by any sense\nof his own iniquity, followed her to the foot of the staircase, calling\nafter her, \"Now, if you beg his pardon when he comes--\"\n\nShe stopped at the top step and looked back. \"Beg his pardon!\" she\nexclaimed, defiantly. \"I don't even intend to _see_ him when he comes!\"\n\nBill held out one hand toward her in a deprecating gesture.\n\n\"Oh, come along down-stairs again.\" Taking a little square box from his\npocket, he opened it and held it up to view, saying, \"If you don't see\nhim, what is he going to do with this?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, her curiosity getting the better of her anger\nas she came slowly back down the stairs. Bill showed her his prize in\nits nest of bright purple velvet. \"He got it for you. He sent me out to\nbuy it while he was in court!\"\n\nMildred looked at the thing, and with one long \"Oh!\" of disgust she\nturned and went through the door into the dining-room.\n\nAlone once more, Bill walked slowly, going to the desk and looking at\nthe register. Then he went back of the desk, examining familiar\nobjects. Suddenly his eyes rested on the electric-light switchboard. He\nplayed with the lights for several seconds, turning them out finally.\nWith a start he grunted, \"Now I broke 'em.\" Pushing the button again,\nthe lights came on, revealing Mrs. Jones, who had tiptoed in from the\ndining-room when Millie told her Bill was there. When he saw her he came\nout from behind the desk and she hurried toward him with outstretched\narms.\n\n\"Are you all right, Bill?\" she asked, tenderly. And Bill, smiling,\nleaned over her and breathed so that she could see that he was all\nright. But she had been through so much lately and where Bill was\nconcerned there was more tenderness than humor in her attitude.\n\n\"Aren't you all tired out, dear?\" she asked.\n\nBill grinned sheepishly. It was a long time since his wife had shown\nsuch affection for him. \"No,\" was his quick reply.\n\nBut her conscience bade her make sure that he was comfortable. She drew\na big arm-chair from the corner and placed it in the center of the\nroom, taking a pillow from the sofa and putting it on the back of the\nchair. Gently she sat Bill down in it.\n\nHe didn't know what to make of it all and he looked up at her, asking,\nwith a chuckle:\n\n\"What's the matter, mother, you sick?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"No, Bill, I ain't sick. I'm just thinkin'.\"\n\nBill looked straight ahead of him.\n\nShe took her rocking-chair and placed it next to him. Clasping one of\nhis hands, she leaned forward.\n\n\"You've forgiven me, 'ain't you, Bill?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" chirped Bill, without so much as a glance.\n\nHer attempt to make love to Bill was not meeting with the success she\nhad hoped, but she was bound to make up to him for all the sorrow of the\nlast few months, and so she did not notice his apparent indifference.\n\n\"Just think,\" she exclaimed, enthusiastically, \"the place is ours\nagain!\"\n\n\"You mean it's yours again,\" said Bill, slowly.\n\n\"No,\" She shook her head emphatically. \"_Ours_, after this, Bill.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Bill replied, again not moving.\n\nMrs. Jones, seeing that her attempts to be affectionate were falling\nupon unfertile ground, dropped his hand.\n\n\"How did Mr. Marvin manage to get it away from them?\" she asked.\n\nFor the first time Bill took interest.\n\n\"I fixed it,\" he said, sitting up straight in his chair. \"Do you want me\nto tell you how much money you get out of the waterfall?\"\n\n\"Yes, Bill. But please say _we_ get it.\"\n\n\"You mean I get half of it?\"\n\nMrs. Jones nodded.\n\n\"And you're going to keep it for me?\" he went on.\n\nShe smiled at him and nodded again.\n\n\"How did you know about my getting the place back?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lem Townsend told me,\" she informed him. \"Did you know that he and Mrs.\nDavis were married to-day?\"\n\nBill didn't know it, but he didn't intend that his wife should know\nthis. Playing up to form, he smiled indulgently upon her as he stated,\nglibly, \"Yes, I fixed it!\"\n\nThey smiled wisely upon each other and Mrs. Jones once again took her\nhusband's hand.\n\n\"We won't have any more divorce people here, will we, Bill?\"\n\n\"Then you will have to close up,\" was his answer.\n\n\"I want to close up, Bill.\" Her voice was full of deep tenderness. \"I\nwant to have a home again.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Bill said, getting up from the chair. Display of affection\nalways embarrassed him. His attitude amused and at the same time hurt\nMrs. Jones, so she changed her subject to one that she felt might\ninterest him.\n\n\"We are all going to have some supper soon, Bill. I have been cooking\nit,\" she said.\n\nBill patted her tenderly on the hand. \"Mother, I found out one thing\nwhen I was at the Home. I found that you were a good cook.\"\n\nShe smiled happily, put her arms around his neck, and kissed him. Bill\nlooked at her a moment in surprise; then he laughed.\n\nA shadow crossed her face and she gazed into his eyes. \"You don't mind\nmy doing that, do you, Bill?\" she asked.\n\nThere was a pause for a moment. Bill shifted awkwardly from side to side\nas he stood up.\n\n\"No, I guess I don't,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Jones walked toward the dining-room, pausing half-way across the\nroom.\n\n\"Bill,\" she said, glancing down at the floor, \"would you kiss me?\"\n\nBill gaped at her in surprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, slowly walking to her. Mrs. Jones saw his hesitation,\nand, realizing the humor of the situation, laughed heartily.\n\n\"Oh, never mind, Bill! You can kiss me later.\"\n\n\"Now, mother, I was going to.\" He grinned and followed her to the door,\nbut she was through it before he could reach her. He stood still and was\nabout to reopen the door when Marvin burst in, out of breath, but a new\nradiance in his eyes.\n\n\"Why, John,\" Bill remarked, \"I thought you were going over to the\ncabin!\"\n\n\"Well, I was,\" said Marvin. \"But I heard about Lem and Mrs. Davis being\nmarried, and I knew that everybody would be over there having a good\ntime. I didn't mean to be out of it. Where's your wife?\"\n\n\"Oh, she's all right. She's cooking supper,\" Bill replied.\n\nMarvin hesitated a moment. He went to a window and looked out; then he\ncame back, putting his arm through Bill's.\n\n\"Is Millie--?\"\n\nHe could get no farther, for Bill interrupted him.\n\n\"Oh yes, she's waiting for you. She's afraid you're not going to forgive\nher.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I can convince her of my forgiveness,\" said Marvin.\n\nDelving into his pocket Bill brought forth the ring.\n\n\"When you see her just give her this,\" he said.\n\nMarvin smiled. \"Now I know why you borrowed that two dollars this\nafternoon!\"\n\n\"Sure! You can find her. She's around some place. After you give it to\nher come in to the party.\"\n\n\"What party?\"\n\nBill nodded toward the dining-room door. \"Lem and his wife are giving a\nparty and we want you to come. But you can't come until you get Millie,\"\nsaid Bill.\n\nMarvin turned and walked toward the stairs, wondering where Millie was.\nHis thought brought his wish, for she parted the curtains and came\nslowly down. She stopped when she saw him, but there was a look in his\neyes that she could not mistake and her heart was beating as it had not\ndone for many months, ever since she and Marvin had walked on the shores\nof Lake Tahoe many months ago.\n\n\"Daddy has told you what I should say to you, hasn't he?\" she asked,\ncoming slowly down the stairs. Marvin went half-way up.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, I have made a fool of myself and I am ashamed of myself and I beg\nyou to forgive me!\"\n\nPausing on the stairs, she lowered her eyes, coloring deeply. Marvin\ncould not help laughing, and there was a dimple of amusement in Millie's\ncheek. He put an arm around her and led her down into the lobby.\n\n\"I could tell you something better than that to say,\" he stated, seeing\nthat her eyes were at last answering his, \"you might say, for example,\n'John, dearest, I know that you love me always,' because that is\nsomething a woman must know!\"\n\nThey both laughed delightedly at this repetition of the words he had\nused in the court-room.\n\n\"And I suppose I should say\"--but here Millie turned her head\naway--\"please marry me!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Marvin cried. \"And my answer is, Yes, Millie--if you will\nhave me!\"\n\nSuddenly he remembered the horrible ring Bill had bought. He took it\nfrom his pocket, saying, with mock tenderness, \"Millie, I want to show\nyou something, and--\"\n\n[Illustration: ... HE TOOK IT FROM HIS POCKET, SAYING, \"MILLIE, I WANT\nTO SHOW YOU SOMETHING\"]\n\n\"I have seen it!\" she interrupted, laughing softly, glancing down at the\nobject in its gaudy setting.\n\n\"Well, we mustn't disappoint Lightnin',\" said Marvin. \"Put it on your\nfinger, dear, for the old fellow's sake and let him see it. It will show\nhim that his efforts were not in vain--no ring could be more beautiful\nin thought than this one!\"\n\n\"You're right, John!\" she said, with shining eyes, as she slipped the\nthing on her finger and raised her face for a kiss.\n\nAt that psychological moment Bill stuck his head in the door. He\nwithdrew, of course, but only to return in an instant with the whole\nparty at his heels.\n\nBill was leading his wife by the hand. Gesturing toward Marvin and\nMillie, his shrewd old eyes fairly snapping with whimsical happiness,\nLightnin' exclaimed:\n\n\"Mother--look! I fixed that!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nBOOTH TARKINGTON'S NOVELS\n\n\n_SEVENTEEN._ Illustrated by Arthur William Brown.\n\nNo one but the creator of Penrod could have portrayed the immortal young\npeople of this story.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":47,"split":"train"}
