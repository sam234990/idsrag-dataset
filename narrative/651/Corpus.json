This king's father and predecessor, the ruler of Southern Italy (the Kingdom of Naples), had conquered the island of Sicily and displaced the native royal house; but the heir of that house, and rightful king of Sicily, is Philaster, who lives as a nobleman in the royal court. The king fears him, but cannot kill him, because of the passionate loyalty of the people. The king has a plan, however: with no son of his own, he will marry his daughter Arethusa to a Spanish prince named Pharamond, and make the Spaniard his heir.\nArethusa, however, is in love with Philaster, and disdains the Spaniard. Philaster reciprocates the princess's affections, and sends his page Bellario to serve her and to be their intermediary. Arethusa is able to frustrate her father's plan by exposing Pharamond's affair with Megra, a loose gentlewoman of the court; but the Spaniard seeks revenge, by spreading reports that Arethusa is having an affair with Bellario. The passionate Philaster is deceived by the slander, and accepts it as true. During a hunt, Philaster confronts Arethusa; the overwrought protagonist stabs the princess (the incident that gives the play its subtitle). Philaster is interrupted by a passing countryman; they fight, and both men are wounded. Philaster crawls off, and Arethusa is discovered by nobles of the court.\nArethusa's and Philaster's wounds are not fatal; both recover. Philaster is found, arrested, and sentenced to death. The king places Philaster in Arethusa's custody; she quickly marries him, which causes the king to decree her death as well. The executions are frustrated when the rebellious citizens capture Pharamond and hold him hostage. The falsehood of Pharamond's accusation against Arethusa is exposed when Bellario is revealed to be a disguised female (she is Eufrasia, a courtier's daughter, infatuated with Philaster). Pharamond retreats to Spain. Since the rightful ruler of Sicily is now the king's son and no alternative presents itself, Philaster is restored to his crown.\nIn creating the play, Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by the works of Sir Philip Sidney, especially the Arcadia. The play bears relationships with a range of contemporaneous works, including The Faithful Shepherdess and Cymbeline.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Philaster, by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Credit me Gentlemen, I wonder at it.\n                They receiv'd strict charge from the King to attend here:\n                Besides it was boldly published, that no Officer should\n                forbid any Gentlemen that desire to attend and hear.\n\n_Cle_.      Can you guess the cause?\n\n_Di_.        Sir, it is plain about the _Spanish_ Prince, that's come\n                to marry our Kingdoms Heir, and be our Soveraign.\n\n_Thra_.     Many (that will seem to know much) say, she looks\n                not on him like a Maid in Love.\n\n_Di_.        O Sir, the multitude (that seldom know any thing\n                but their own opinions) speak that they would have; but\n                the Prince, before his own approach, receiv'd so many\n                confident messages from the State, that I think she's\n                resolv'd to be rul'd.\n\n_Cle_.      Sir, it is thought, with her he shall enjoy both these\n                Kingdoms of _Cicilie_ and _Calabria_.\n\n_Di_.        Sir, it is (without controversie) so meant. But 'twill\n                be a troublesome labour for him to enjoy both these\n                Kingdoms, with safetie, the right Heir to one of them\n                living, and living so vertuously, especially the people\n                admiring the bravery of his mind, and lamenting his\n                injuries.\n\n_Cle_.       Who, Philaster?\n\n_Di_.        Yes, whose Father we all know, was by our late\n                King of _Calabria_, unrighteously deposed from his\n                fruitful _Cicilie_. My self drew some blood in those\n               Wars, which I would give my hand to be washed from.\n\n_Cle_.       Sir, my ignorance in State-policy, will not let me\n                know why _Philaster_ being Heir to one of these Kingdoms,\n                the King should suffer him to walk abroad with such free\n                liberty.\n\n_Di_.        Sir, it seems your nature is more constant than to\n                enquire after State news. But the King (of late) made a\n                hazard of both the Kingdoms, of _Cicilie_ and his own,\n                with offering but to imprison _Philaster_. At which the City\n                was in arms, not to be charm'd down by any State-order or\n                Proclamation, till they saw _Philaster_ ride through the\n                streets pleas'd, and without a guard; at which they threw\n                their Hats, and their arms from them; some to make\n                bonefires, some to drink, all for his deliverance. Which\n                (wise men say) is the cause, the King labours to bring in\n                the power of a Foreign Nation to aw his own with.\n\n                           [ _Enter_ Galatea, Megra, _and a Lady_.\n\n_Thra_.     See, the Ladies, what's the first?\n\n_Di_.        A wise and modest Gentlwoman that attends the Princess.\n\n_Cle_.      The second?\n\n_Di_.        She is one that may stand still discreetly enough, and\n                ill favour'dly Dance her Measure; simper when she is\n                Courted by her Friend, and slight her Husband.\n\n_Cle_.       The last?\n\n_Di_.        Marry I think she is one whom the State keeps for\n                the Agents of our confederate Princes: she'll cog and lie\n                with a whole army before the League shall break: her\n                name is common through the Kingdom, and the Trophies\n                of her dishonour, advanced beyond _Hercules_-pillars.\n                She loves to try the several constitutions of mens bodies;\n                and indeed has destroyed the worth of her own body, by\n                making experiment upon it, for the good of the\n                Common-wealth.\n\n_Cle_.       She's a profitable member.\n\n_La_.        Peace, if you love me: you shall see these Gentlemen\n                stand their ground, and not Court us.\n\n_Gal_.      What if they should?\n\n_Meg_.     What if they should?\n\n_La_.        Nay, let her alone; what if they should? why, if\n                they should, I say, they were never abroad: what\n                Foreigner would do so? it writes them directly\n                untravel'd.\n\n_Gal_.      Why, what if they be?\n\n_Meg_.     What if they be?\n\n_La_.        Good Madam let her go on; what if they be? Why\n                if they be I will justifie, they cannot maintain\n                discourse with a judicious Lady, nor make a Leg,\n                nor say Excuse me.\n\n_Gal_.      Ha, ha, ha.\n\n_La_.       Do you laugh Madam?\n\n_Di_.        Your desires upon you Ladies.\n\n_La_.        Then you must sit beside us.\n\n_Di_.        I shall sit near you then Lady.\n\n_La_.        Near me perhaps: But there's a Lady indures no\n                stranger; and to me you appear a very strange fellow.\n\n_Meg_.     Me thinks he's not so strange, he would quickly be\n                acquainted.\n\n_Thra_.     Peace, the King.\n\n                       [ _Enter_ King, Pharamond, Arethusa, _and Train_.\n\n_King_.     To give a stronger testimony of love\n                Than sickly promises (which commonly\n                In Princes find both birth and burial\n                In one breath) we have drawn you worthy Sir,\n                To make your fair indearments to [our] daughter,\n                And worthy services known to our subjects,\n                Now lov'd and wondered at.

Every man\n                in this age, has not a soul of Crystal for all men to\n                read their actions through: mens hearts and faces are\n                so far asunder, that they hold no intelligence. Do but\n                view yon stranger well, and you shall see a Feaver\n                through all his bravery, and feel him shake like a true\n                Tenant; if he give not back his Crown again, upon the\n                report of an Elder Gun, I have no augury.\n\n_King_.

In that small time that I have seen the world,\n                I never knew a man hasty to part\n                With a servant he thought trusty; I remember\n                My Father would prefer the boys he kept\n                To greater men than he, but did it not,\n                Till they were grown too sawcy for himself.\n\n_Phi_.

Good morrow to your honour,\n                We have spent some time in seeking you.\n\n_Phi_.       My worthy friends,\n                You that can keep your memories to know\n                Your friend in miseries, and cannot frown\n                On men disgrac'd for vertue: A good day\n                Attend you all. What service may I do worthy your\n                acceptation?\n\n_Di_.        My good Lord,\n                We come to urge that vertue which we know\n                Lives in your breast, forth, rise, and make a head,\n                The Nobles, and the people are all dull'd\n                With this usurping King: and not a man\n                That ever heard the word, or knew such a thing\n                As vertue, but will second your attempts.\n\n_Phi_.       How honourable is this love in you\n                To me that have deserv'd none? Know my friends\n                (You that were born to shame your poor _Philaster_,\n                With too much courtesie) I could afford\n                To melt my self in thanks; but my designs\n                Are not yet ripe, suffice it, that ere long\n                I shall imploy your loves: but yet the time is short of\n                what I would.\n\n_Di_.        The time is fuller Sir, than you expect;\n                That which hereafter will not perhaps be reach'd\n                By violence, may now be caught; As for the King,\n                You know the people have long hated him;\n                But now the Princess, whom they lov'd.\n\n_Phi_.      Why, what of her?\n\n_Di_.        Is loath'd as much as he.\n\n_Phi_.      By what strange means?\n\n_Di_.        She's known a Whore.\n\n_Phi_.       Thou lyest.\n\n_Di_.         My Lord--\n\n_Phi_.

Why, she was taken at it.\n\n_Phi_.       'Tis false, O Heaven 'tis false: it cannot be,\n                Can it?

And she was taken with her boy.\n\n_Phi_.      What boy?\n\n_Di_.        A Page, a boy that serves her.\n\n_Phi_.      Oh good gods, a little boy?\n\n_Di_.        I, know you him my Lord?\n\n_Phi_.      Hell and sin know him?

How you my Lord?\n\n_Phi_.      Why all the world's abus'd\n                In an unjust report.\n\n_Di_.        Oh noble Sir your vertues\n                Cannot look into the subtil thoughts of woman.\n                In short my Lord, I took them: I my self.\n\n_Phi_.       Now all the Devils thou didst flie from my rage,\n                Would thou hadst ta'ne devils ingendring plagues:\n                When thou didst take them, hide thee from my eyes,\n                Would thou hadst taken Thunder on thy breast,\n                When thou didst take them, or been strucken dumb\n                For ever: that this foul deed might have slept in\n                silence.\n\n_Thra_.

What friend bears a sword\n                To run me through?\n\n_Di_.        Why, my Lord, are you so mov'd at this?\n\n_Phi_.      When any falls from vertue I am distract,\n                I have an interest in't.\n\n_Di_.        But good my Lord recal your self,\n                And think what's best to be done.\n\n_Phi_.       I thank you.

I, now I see why my disturbed thoughts\n                Were so perplext.

Thou think'st I will be angry with thee; Come\n                Thou shalt know all my drift, I hate her more,\n                Than I love happiness, and plac'd thee there,\n                To pry with narrow eyes into her deeds;\n                Hast thou discover'd? Is she fain to lust,\n                As I would wish her? Speak some comfort to me.\n\n_Bell_.     My Lord, you did mistake the boy you sent:\n                Had she the lust of Sparrows, or of Goats;\n                Had she a sin that way, hid from the world,\n                Beyond the name of lust, I would not aid\n                Her base desires; but what I came to know\n                As servant to her, I would not reveal, to make\n                my life last ages.\n\n_Phi_.      Oh my heart; this is a salve worse than the main disease.\n                Tell me thy thoughts; for I will know the least\n                That dwells within thee, or will rip thy heart\n                To know it; I will see thy thoughts as plain,\n                As I do know thy face.\n\n_Bell_.     Why, so you do.\n                She is (for ought I know) by all the gods,\n                As chaste as Ice; but were she foul as Hell\n                And I did know it, thus; the breath of Kings,\n                The points of Swords, Tortures nor Bulls of Brass,\n                Should draw it from me.\n\n_Phi_.      Then 'tis no time to dally with thee;\n                I will take thy life, for I do hate thee; I could curse\n                thee now.\n\n_Bell_.      If you do hate you could not curse me worse;\n                The gods have not a punishment in store\n                Greater for me, than is your hate.\n\n_Phi_.       Fie, fie, so young and so dissembling;\n                Tell me when and where thou di[d]st enjoy her,\n                Or let plagues fall on me, if I destroy thee not.\n\n_Bell_.      Heaven knows I never did: and when I lie\n                To save my life, may I live long and loath'd.\n                Hew me asunder, and whilst I can think\n                I'le love those pieces you have cut away,\n                Better than those that grow: and kiss these limbs,\n                Because you made 'em so.\n\n_Phi_.       Fearest thou not death?\n                Can boys contemn that?\n\n_Bell_.      Oh, what boy is he\n                Can be content to live to be a man\n                That sees the best of men thus passionate, thus\n                without reason?\n\n_Phi_.      Oh, but thou dost not know what 'tis to die.\n\n_Bell_.     Yes, I do know my Lord;\n                'Tis less than to be born; a lasting sleep,\n                A quiet resting from all jealousie;\n                A thing we all pursue; I know besides,\n                It is but giving over of a game that must be lost.\n\n_Phi_.      But there are pains, false boy,\n                For perjur'd souls; think but on these, and then\n                Thy heart will melt, and thou wilt utter all.\n\n_Bell_.      May they fall all upon me whilst I live,\n                If I be perjur'd, or have ever thought\n                Of that you charge me with; if I be false,\n                Send me to suffer in those punishments you speak of;\n                kill me.\n\n_Phi_.      Oh, what should I do?\n                Why, who can but believe him? He does swear\n                So earnestly, that if it were not true,\n                The gods would not endure him.  Rise _Bellario_,\n                Thy protestations are so deep; and thou\n                Dost look so truly, when thou utterest them,\n                That though I [know] 'em false, as were my hopes,\n                I cannot urge thee further; but thou wert\n                To blame to injure me, for I must love\n                Thy honest looks, and take no revenge upon\n                Thy tender youth; A love from me to thee\n                Is firm, what ere thou dost: It troubles me\n                That I have call'd the blood out of thy cheeks,\n                That did so well become thee: but good boy\n                Let me not see thee more; something is done,\n                That will distract me, that will make me mad,\n                If I behold thee: if thou tender'st me,\n                Let me not see thee.\n\n_Bell_.

Pardon me that must\n                Break thy last commandment; For I must speak;\n                You that are griev'd can pity; hear my Lord.\n\n_Phi_.      Is there a Creature yet so miserable,\n                That I can pity?\n\n_Bell_.     Oh my Noble Lord,\n                View my strange fortune, and bestow on me,\n                According to your bounty (if my service\n                Can merit nothing) so much as may serve\n                To keep that little piece I hold of life\n                From cold and hunger.\n\n_Phi_.       Is it thou? be gone:\n                Go sell those misbeseeming Cloaths thou wear'st,\n                And feed thy self with them.\n\n_Bell_.      Alas! my Lord, I can get nothing for them:\n                The silly Country people think 'tis Treason\n                To touch such gay things.\n\n_Phi_.       Now by my life this is\n                Unkindly done, to vex me with thy sight,\n                Th'art fain again to thy dissembling trade:\n                How should'st thou think to cozen me again?\n                Remains there yet a plague untri'd for me?\n                Even so thou wept'st and spok'st when first\n                I took thee up; curse on the time. If thy\n                Commanding tears can work on any other,\n                Use thy art, I'le not betray it. Which way\n                Wilt thou take, that I may shun thee;\n                For thine eyes are poyson to mine; and I\n                Am loth to grow in rage. This way, or that way?\n\n_Bell_.      Any will serve. But I will chuse to have\n                That path in chase that leads unto my grave.\n\n                             [_Exeunt_ Phil. _and_ Bell. _severally_.\n\n     _Enter_ Dion _and the_ Woodmen.\n\n_Di_.         This is the strangest sudden change! You _Woodman_.\n\n_1 Wood_. My Lord _Dion_.\n\n_Di_.        Saw you a Lady come this way on a Sable-horse\n                stubbed with stars of white?\n\n_2 Wood_. Was she not young and tall?\n\n_Di_.        Yes; Rode she to the wood, or to the plain?\n\n_2 Wood_. Faith my Lord we saw none.\n\n                                                     [_Exeunt_ Wood.\n\n   _Enter_ Cleremont.\n\n_Di_.        Pox of your questions then. What, is she found?\n\n_Cle_.      Nor will be I think.\n\n_Di_.        Let him seek his Daughter himself; she cannot stray\n                about a little necessary natural business, but the\n                whole Court must be in Arms; when she has done, we\n                shall have peace.\n\n_Cle_.       There's already a thousand fatherless tales amongst\n                us; some say her Horse run away with her; some a Wolf\n                pursued her; others, it was a plot to kill her; and that\n                Armed men were seen in the Wood: but questionless, she\n                rode away willingly.\n\n   _Enter_ King, _and_ Thrasiline.\n\n_King_.    Where is she?\n\n_Cle_.      Sir, I cannot tell.\n\n_King_.    How is that? Answer me so again.\n\n_Cle_.      Sir, shall I lie?\n\n_King_.    Yes, lie and damn, rather than tell me that;\n                I say again, where is she? Mutter not;\n                Sir, speak you where is she?\n\n_Di_.        Sir, I do not know.\n\n_King_.    Speak that again so boldly, and by Heaven\n                It is thy last. You fellows answer me,\n                Where is she? Mark me all, I am your King.\n                I wish to see my Daughter, shew her me;\n                I do command you all, as you are subjects,\n                To shew her me, what am I not your King?\n                If I, then am I not to be obeyed?\n\n_Di_.        Yes, if you command things possible and honest.\n\n_King_.    Things possible and honest! Hear me, thou,\n                Thou Traytor, that darest confine thy King to things\n                Possible and honest; shew her me,\n                Or let me perish, if I cover not all _Cicily_ with bloud.\n\n_Di_.        Indeed I cannot, unless you tell me where she is.\n\n_King_.    You have betray'd me, y'have, let me lose\n                The Jewel of my life, go; bring her me,\n                And set her before me; 'tis the King\n                Will have it so, whose breath can still the winds,\n                Uncloud the Sun, charm down the swelling Sea,\n                And stop the Flouds of Heaven; speak, can it not?\n\n_Di_.        No.\n\n_King_.    No, cannot the breath of Kings do this?\n\n_Di_.        No; nor smell sweet it self, if once the Lungs\n                Be but corrupted.\n\n_King_.     Is it so? Take heed.\n\n_Di_.        Sir, take you heed; how you dare the powers\n                That must be just.\n\n_King_.    Alas! what are we Kings?\n                Why do you gods place us above the rest;\n                To be serv'd, flatter'd, and ador'd till we\n                Believe we hold within our hands your Thunder,\n                And when we come to try the power we have,\n                There's not a leaf shakes at our threatnings.\n                I have sin'd 'tis true, and here stand to be punish'd;\n                Yet would not thus be punish'd; let me chuse\n                My way, and lay it on.\n\n_Di_.        He Articles with the gods; would some body would\n                draw bonds, for the performance of Covenants\n                betwixt them.\n\n   _Enter_ Pha. Galatea, _and_ Megra.\n\n_King_.     What, is she found?\n\n_Pha_.      No, we have ta'ne her Horse.\n                He gallopt empty by: there's some Treason;\n                You _Galatea_ rode with her into the wood; why left\n                you her?\n\n_Gal_.      She did command me.\n\n_King_.    Command! you should not.\n\n_Gal_.       'Twould ill become my Fortunes and my Birth\n                To disobey the Daughter of my King.\n\n_King_.     Y'are all cunning to obey us for our hurt,\n                But I will have her.\n\n_Pha_.      If I have her not,\n                By this hand there shall be no more _Cicily_.\n\n_Di_.        What will he carry it to _Spain_ in's pocket?\n\n_Pha_.      I will not leave one man alive, but the King,\n                A Cook and a Taylor.\n\n_Di_.        Yet you may do well to spare your Ladies Bed-fellow,\n                and her you may keep for a Spawner.\n\n_King_.     I see the injuries I have done must be reveng'd.\n\n_Di_.        Sir, this is not the way to find her out.\n\n_King_.    Run all, disperse your selves: the man that finds her,\n               Or (if she be kill'd) the Traytor; I'le [make] him great.\n\n_Di_.        I know some would give five thousand pounds to find her.\n\n_Pha_.     Come let us seek.\n\n_King_.    Each man a several way, here I my self.\n\n_Di_.        Come Gentlemen we here.\n\n_Cle_.       Lady you must go search too.\n\n_Meg_.      I had rather be search'd my self.\n\n                                        [_Exeunt omnes_.\n\n    _Enter_ Arethusa.\n\n_Are_.      Where am I now?

My Lord, help the Princess.\n\n_Are_.       I am well, forbear.\n\n_Phi_.       Let me love lightning, let me be embrac'd\n                And kist by Scorpions, or adore the eyes\n                Of Basilisks, rather than trust to tongues,\n                And shrink these veins up; stick me here a stone\n                Lasting to ages in the memory\n                Of this damn'd act.

I have done;\n                Forgive my passion, not the calm'd sea,\n                When _\u00c3\u0086olus_ locks up his windy brood,\n                Is less disturb'd than I, I'le make you know it.\n                Dear _Arethusa_, do but take this sword,\n                And search how temperate a heart I have;\n                Then you and this your boy, may live and raign\n                In lust without control; Wilt thou _Bellario_?\n                I prethee kill me; thou art poor, and maist\n                Nourish ambitious thoughts, when I am dead:\n                This way were freer; Am I raging now?\n                If I were mad I should desire to live;\n                Sirs, feel my pulse; whether have you known\n                A man in a more equal tune to die?\n\n_Bel_.

I'le see the King if he be in the Forest, I have hunted\n                him these two hours; if I should come home and not\n                see him my Sisters would laugh at me; I can see nothing\n                but people better horst than my self, that outride\n                me; I can hear nothing but shouting. These Kings had\n                need of good brains, this whooping is able to put a mean\n                man out of his wits. There's a Courtier with his sword\n                drawn, by this hand upon a woman, I think.\n\n_Phi_.      Are you at peace?\n\n_Are_.      With Heavens and Earth.\n\n_Phi_.

I hear the tread of people: I am hurt.\n                The gods take part against me, could this Boor\n                Have held me thus else? I must shift for life,\n                Though I do loath it.

Almost kil'd I am for a foolish woman; a knave\n                has hurt her.\n\n_Pha_.      The Princess Gentlemen! Where's the wound Madam?\n                Is it dangerous?\n\n_Are_.      He has not hurt me.\n\n_Coun_.   I'faith she lies, has hurt her in the breast, look else.\n\n_Pha_.     O sacred spring of innocent blood!\n\n_Di_.        'Tis above wonder! who should dare this?\n\n_Are_.       I felt it not.\n\n_Pha_.      Speak villain, who has hurt the Princess?\n\n_Coun_.    Is it the Princess?\n\n_Di_.         I.\n\n_Coun_.    Then I have seen something yet.\n\n_Pha_.       But who has hurt her?\n\n_Coun_.     I told you a Rogue I ne're saw him before, I.\n\n_Pha_.       Madam who did it?\n\n_Are_.        Some dishonest wretch, Alas I know him not,\n                 And do forgive him.\n\n_Coun_.   He's hurt too, he cannot go far, I made my Fathers\n                old Fox flie about his ears.\n\n_Pha_.      How will you have me kill him?\n\n_Are_.       Not at all, 'tis some distracted fellow.\n\n_Pha_.      By this hand, I'le leave ne'er a piece of him bigger\n                than a Nut, and bring him all in my Hat.\n\n_Are_.       Nay, good Sir;\n                If you do take him, bring him quick to me,\n                And I will study for a punishment,\n                Great as his fault.\n\n_Pha_.

My Son!\n                Blest be the time that I have leave to call\n                Such vertue mine; now thou art in mine arms,\n                Me thinks I have a salve unto my breast\n                For all the stings that dwell there, streams of grief\n                That I have wrought thee, and as much of joy\n                That I repent it, issue from mine eyes:\n                Let them appease thee, take thy right; take her,\n                She is thy right too, and forget to urge\n                My vexed soul with that I did before.\n\n_Phi_.       Sir, [it is] blotted from my memory,\n                Past and forgotten: For you Prince of _Spain_,\n                Whom I have thus redeem'd, you have full leave\n                To make an honourable voyage home.\n                And if you would go furnish'd to your Realm\n                With fair provision, I do see a Lady\n                Me thinks would gladly bear you company:\n                How like you this piece?\n\n_Meg_.     Sir, he likes it well,\n                For he hath tried it, and found it worth\n                His princely liking; we were ta'ne a bed,\n                I know your meaning, I am not the first\n                That Nature taught to seek a fellow forth:\n                Can shame remain perpetually in me,\n                And not in others? or have Princes salves\n                To cure ill names that meaner people want?\n\n_Phi_.      What mean you?\n\n_Meg_.     You must get another ship\n                To clear the Princess and the boy together.\n\n_Di_.        How now!\n\n_Meg_.     Others took me, and I took her and him\n                At that all women may be ta'ne sometimes:\n                Ship us all four my Lord, we can endure\n                Weather and wind alike.\n\n_King_.    Clear thou thy self, or know not me for Father.\n\n_Are_.      This earth, How false it is? what means is left for me\n                To clear my self? It lies in your belief,\n                My Lords believe me, and let all things else\n                Struggle together to dishonour me.\n\n_Bell_.      O stop your ears great King, that I may speak\n                As freedom would, then I will call this Lady\n                As base as be her actions, hear me Sir,\n                Believe [y]our hated bloud when it rebels\n                Against your reason sooner than this Lady.\n\n_Meg_.     By this good light he bears it hansomely.\n\n_Phi_.       This Lady? I will sooner trust the wind\n                With Feathers, or the troubled Sea with Pearl,\n                Than her with any thing; believe her not!\n                Why think you, if I did believe her words;\n                I would outlive 'em: honour cannot take\n                Revenge on you, then what were to be known\n                But death?\n\n_King_.     Forget her Sir, since all is knit\n                Between us: but I must request of you\n                One favour, and will sadly be denied.\n\n_Phi_.      Command what ere it be.\n\n_King_.    Swear to be true to what you promise.\n\n_Phi_.      By the powers above,\n                Let it not be the death of her or him,\n                And it is granted.\n\n_King_.    Bear away the boy\n                To Torture, I will have her clear'd or buried.\n\n_Phi_.      O let me call my words back, worthy Sir,\n                Ask something else, bury my life and right\n                In one poor grave, but do not take away my\n                                                     life and fame at once.\n_King_.    Away with him, it stands irrevocable.\n\n_Phi_.       Turn all your eyes on me, here stands a man\n                The falsest and the basest of this world:\n                Set swords against this breast some honest man,\n                For I have liv'd till I am pitied,\n                My former deeds are hateful, but this last\n                Is pitifull, for I unwillingly\n                Have given the dear preserver of my life\n\n                                 [_Offers to kill himself_.]\n\n                Unto his Torture: is it in the power\n                Of flesh and blood, to carry this and live?\n\n_Are_.       Dear Sir be patient yet, or stay that hand.\n\n_King_.     Sirs, strip that boy.\n\n_Di_.        Come Sir, your tender flesh will try your\n                constancie.\n\n_Bell_.     O kill me gentlemen.\n\n_Di_.        No, help Sirs.\n\n_Bell_.     Will you Torture me?\n\n_King_.    Hast there, why stay you?\n\n_Bell_.     Then I shall not break my vow,\n                You know just gods, though I discover all.\n\n_King_.    How's that? Will he confess?\n\n_Di_.        Sir, so he says.\n\n_King_.    Speak then.\n\n_Bell_.     Great King if you command\n                This Lord to talk with me alone, my tongue\n                Urg'd by my heart, shall utter all the thoughts\n                My youth hath known, and stranger things than these\n                You hear not often.\n\n_King_.    Walk aside with him.\n\n_Di_.        Why speak'st thou not?\n\n_Bell_.     Know you this face my Lord?\n\n_Di_.        No.\n\n_Bell_.     Have you not seen it, nor the like?\n\n_Di_.        Yes, I have seen the like, but readily\n                I know not where.\n\n_Bell_.      I have been often told\n                In Court, of one _Euphrasia,_ a Lady\n                And Daughter to you; betwixt whom and me\n                (They that would flatter my bad face would swear)\n                There was such strange resemblance, that we two\n                Could not be known asunder, drest alike.\n\n_Di_.        By Heaven and so there is.\n\n_Bell_.      For her fair sake,\n                Who now doth spend the spring time of her life\n                In holy Pilgrimage, move to the King,\n                That I may scape this Torture.\n\n_Di_.        But thou speak'st\n                As like _Euphrasia_ as thou dost look,\n                How came it to thy knowledge that she\n                lives in Pilgrimage?\n\n_Bell_.      I know it not my Lord,\n                But I have heard it, and do scarce believe it.\n\n_Di_.        Oh my shame, is't possible? Draw near,\n                That I may gaze upon thee, art thou she?\n                Or else her Murderer? where wert thou born?\n\n_Bell_.      In _Siracusa_.\n\n_Di_.        What's thy name?\n\n_Bell.       Euphrasia_.\n\n _Di_.       O 'tis just, 'tis she now, I do know thee, Oh\n                that thou hadst died\n                And I had never seen thee nor my shame,\n                How shall I own thee? shall this tongue of mine\n                E're call thee Daughter more?\n\n_Bell_.      Would I had died indeed, I wish it too,\n                And so I must have done by vow, e're published\n                What I have told, but that there was no means\n                To hide it longer, yet I joy in this,\n                The Princess is all clear.\n\n_King_.      What have you done?\n\n_Di_.          All is discovered.\n\n_Phi_.        Why then hold you me?\n\n_Di_.         All is discovered, pray you let me go.\n                             [He offers to stab himself_.]\n\n_King_.     Stay him.\n\n_Are_.       What is discovered?\n\n_Di_.         Why my shame, it is a woman, let her speak the rest.\n\n_Phi_.       How! that again.\n\n_Di_.         It is a woman.\n\n_Phi_.       Blest be you powers that favour innocence.\n\n_King_.     Lay hold upon that Lady.\n\n_Phi_.       It is a woman Sir, hark Gentlemen!\n                It is a woman. _Arethusa_ take\n                My soul into thy breast, that would be gone\n                With joy: it is a woman, thou art fair,\n\n                And vertuous still to ages, in despight of malice.\n\n_King_.    Speak you, where lies his shame?\n\n_Bell_.     I am his Daughter.\n\n_Phi_.      The Gods are just.\n\n_Di_.        I dare accuse none, but before you two\n                The vertue of our age, I bend my knee\n                For mercy.\n\n_Phi_.      Take it freely; for I know,\n                Though what thou didst were undiscreetly done,\n                'Twas meant well.\n\n_Are_.      And for me,\n                I have a power to pardon sins as oft\n                As any man has power to wrong me.\n\n_Cle_.       Noble and worthy.\n\n_Phi_.       But _Bellario_,\n                (For I must call thee still so) tell me why\n                Thou didst conceal thy Sex, it was a fault,\n                A fault _Bellario_, though thy other deeds\n                Of truth outweigh'd it: All these Jealousies\n                Had flown to nothing, if thou hadst discovered,\n                What now we know.\n\n_Bell_.     My Father would oft speak\n                Your worth and vertue, and as I did grow\n                More and more apprehensive, I did thirst\n                To see the man so rais'd, but yet all this\n                Was but a Maiden longing to be lost\n                As soon as found, till sitting in my window,\n                Printing my thoughts in Lawne, I saw a God\n                I thought (but it was you) enter our Gates,\n                My bloud flew out, and back again as fast\n                As I had puft it forth, and suck't it in\n                Like breath, then was I call'd away in hast\n                To entertain you. Never was a man\n                Heav'd from a Sheep-coat to a Scepter rais'd\n                So high in thoughts as I, you left a kiss\n                Upon these lips then, which I mean to keep\n                From you for ever, I did hear you talk\n                Far above singing; after you were gone,\n                I grew acquainted with my heart, and search'd\n                What stir'd it so, Alas I found it love,\n                Yet far from lust, for could I have but liv'd\n                In presence of you, I had had my end,\n                For this I did delude my noble Father\n                With a feign'd Pilgrimage, and drest my self\n                In habit of a boy, and, for I knew\n                My birth no match for you, I was past hope\n                Of having you. And understanding well\n                That when I made discovery of my Sex,\n                I could not stay with you, I made a vow\n                By all the most religious things a Maid\n                Could call together, never to be known,\n                Whilst there was hope to hide me from mens eyes,\n                For other than I seem'd; that I might ever\n                Abide with you, then sate I by the Fount\n                Where first you took me up.\n\n_King_.    Search out a match\n                Within our Kingdom where and when thou wilt,\n                And I will pay thy Dowry, and thy self\n                Wilt well deserve him.\n\n_Bell_.      Never Sir will I\n                Marry, it is a thing within my vow,\n                But if I may have leave to serve the Princess,\n                To see the vertues of her Lord and her,\n                I shall have hope to live.\n\n_Are_.       I _Philaster_,\n                Cannot be jealous, though you had a Lady\n                Drest like a Page to serve you, nor will I\n                Suspect her living here: come live with me,\n                Live free, as I do, she that loves my Lord,\n                Curst be the wife that hates her.\n\n_Phi_.       I grieve such vertues should be laid in earth\n                Without an Heir; hear me my Royal Father,\n                Wrong not the freedom of our souls so much,\n                To think to take revenge of that base woman,\n                Her malice cannot hurt us: set her free\n                As she was born, saving from shame and sin.\n\n_King_.     Set her at liberty, but leave the Court,\n                This is no place for such: you _Pharamond_\n                Shall have free passage, and a conduct home\n                Worthy so great a Prince, when you come there,\n                Remember 'twas your faults that lost you her,\n                And not my purpos'd will.\n\n_Pha_.      I do confess,\n                Renowned Sir.\n\n_King_.    Last joyn your hands in one, enjoy _Philaster_\n                This Kingdom which is yours, and after me\n                What ever I call mine, my blessing on you,\n                All happy hours be at your Marriage joyes,\n                That you may grow your selves over all Lands,\n                And live to see your plenteous branches spring\n                Where ever there is Sun. Let Princes learn\n                By this to rule the passions of their blood,\n                For what Heaven wills, can never be withstood.\n\n                [_Exeunt Omnes_.\n\n\n\nPHILASTER.\n\n(A) Phylaster. | Or, | Love lyes a Bleeding. | Acted at the Globe\nby his Majesties Servants. | Written by Francis Baymont and John\nFletcher.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":651,"split":"train"}
