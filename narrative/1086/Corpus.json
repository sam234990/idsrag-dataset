{"ori_id":"fbbfafdd97567ddaadc565e18ac617703e1fed66","title":"Cavalleria rusticana","context":"Cavalleria rusticana\n Place: A 19th-century Sicilian village\nTime: Easter morning\nBefore the action takes place, the young villager Turiddu had returned from military service to find that his fianc\u00e9e Lola had married the carter Alfio while Turiddu was away. In revenge, Turiddu had seduced Santuzza, a young woman in the village. As the opera begins, Lola, overcome by her jealousy of Santuzza, has begun an adulterous affair with Turiddu.\nThe main square of the village\nOffstage, Turiddu is heard singing The Siciliana \u2013 \"O Lola, lovely as the spring\u2019s bright blooms\" (O Lola c'hai di latti la cammisa). To one side is the church; to the other is Lucia's wine shop and the house where she lives with her son, Turiddu. The villagers move about the square, singing of the beautiful spring day (Gli aranci olezzano sui verdi margini \u2013 \"The air is sweet with orange blossoms\") and a hymn to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Some villagers enter the church, and others wander off still singing.\nSantuzza, having slept with Turiddu and suspecting that he has betrayed her for Lola, is distraught and approaches Lucia as she comes out of her house. Santuzza asks for Turiddu, but Lucia replies that he has gone to another town to fetch some wine. Santuzza tells her that he was seen during the night in the village. Lucia asks her inside to talk, but just at that moment Alfio arrives on his wagon, accompanied by the villagers. He praises the joys of a teamster's life and the beauty of his bride. Alfio asks Lucia for some of her fine old wine. She tells him it has run out and Turiddu has gone away to buy more. Alfio replies that he had seen Turiddu early that morning near his cottage. Lucia starts to express surprise, but Santuzza stops her.\nAlfio leaves. The choir inside the church is heard singing the Regina Coeli. Outside, the villagers sing an Easter Hymn, joined by Santuzza. The villagers enter the church, while Santuzza and Lucia remain outside. Lucia asks Santuzza why she signalled her to remain silent when Alfio said that he had seen Turiddu that morning. Santuzza exclaims, Voi lo sapete \u2013 \"Now you shall know\"), and tells Lucia the story of her seduction by Turiddu and his affair with Lola. Lucia pities Santuzza, whom the villagers are considering excommunicating for her seduction. Santuzza cannot enter the church, but begs Lucia to go inside and pray for her.\nTuriddu arrives. Santuzza upbraids him for pretending to have gone away, when he was actually seeing Lola. Lola enters the square singing. She mocks Santuzza and goes inside the church. Turiddu turns to follow Lola, but Santuzza begs him to stay. Turiddu pushes her away. She clings to him. He loosens her hands, throws her to the ground, and enters the church. Alfio arrives looking for Lola. Santuzza tells him that his wife has betrayed him with Turiddu. Alfio swears to take vendetta (revenge) which causes Santuzza to repent for having disclosed the affair and begs Alfio to stop to no avail.\nThe square is empty as the orchestra plays the famous Intermezzo.\nThe villagers come out of the church. Turiddu is in high spirits because he is with Lola and Santuzza appears to have gone. He invites his friends to his mother\u2019s wine shop where he sings a drinking song, Viva, il vino spumeggiante \u2013 \"Hail to the bubbling wine!\". Alfio joins them. Turiddu offers him wine, but he refuses it. All understand that trouble is in the air. The women leave, taking Lola with them. In a brief exchange of words, Alfio challenges Turiddu to a duel. Following Sicilian custom, the two men embrace, and Turiddu, in a token of acceptance, bites Alfio\u2019s ear, drawing blood which signifies a fight to the death. Alfio leaves and Turiddu calls Lucia back. He tells her that he is going outside to get some air and asks that she be a kindly mother to Santuzza if he should not return: Un bacio, mamma! Un altro bacio!\u2014Addio! \u2013 \"One kiss, mother! One more kiss! \u2013 Farewell!\".\nTuriddu rushes out. Lucia, weeping, wanders aimlessly around outside her house. Santuzza approaches and throws her arms around her. The villagers start to crowd around. Voices are heard in the distance and a woman cries, \"They have murdered Turiddu!\" Santuzza faints and Lucia collapses in the arms of the women villagers.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Rustic Chivalry (Cavalleria Rusticana), by \nPietro Mascagni\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

The names of the distinguished editors are a guarantee of the\nhigh quality of the book. Care has been taken to avoid music of more\nthan average difficulty, or of extreme vocal range.\n\nEvery number was chosen because of its intrinsic beauty as well as\nsingableness.

More than half are made available in _a cappella_ form for the\nfirst time.\n\nAs the best possible preparation for acquiring independent movement\nof voices accustomed only to part-songs that move solidly together,\nthe book opens with fifteen canons, rounds, and catches by Byrd,\nHayes, Haydn, Hilton, Purcell, and others. These are followed by two\ncanzonets of Morley (two-part) and three-part (S. A. B.) choruses by\nShield and Ford and arrangements of folksongs. The body of the book\nconsists of four-part madrigals, folksongs, two Negro spirituals, and\nother choruses. Several five-part songs are included. Morley, Weelkes,\nPilkington, Bennet, Gevaert, Lully, Praetorius, Mozart, Bortniansky,\nArchangelsky, Sibelius, and others are represented.\n\nWhile the musical standard of the editors is high, pains have been taken\nto selectmusic that not only is suitable in range and text for junior\nchoruses, but is hearty, joyous, and singable.\n\nThis truly significant volume will fill a great need, and be the\nhappiest possible introduction to the art of unaccompanied chorus\nsinging.\n\n_Each number is also issued separately_\n\n\n\n\nNEW CHORAL WORKS\n\nWRITTEN FOR SCHOOLS\n\n\n=BIZET, GEORGES=\n\n =Choral Fantasia from Carmen= (Arranged by N.

CLIPPINGER\n\nAn altogether sane, balanced and practical text book by one of America's\neminent authorities on the voice. It contains 132 pages of instructive\ntext, technical exercises, melodic studies, and carefully chosen songs\nand duets.\n\nThe author's deep study of the voice together with his long experience\nin solving difficult vocal problems in the studio has enabled him to\nrid the subject of vagary, mystery, and uncertainty, and state the\nprinciples of voice-training so clearly and simply that they may be\nunderstood by anyone.\n\n\nA FEW BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\nA tone is _something to hear_. Therefore, to be right it must satisfy\nthe trained ear.\n\nA good tone is _easily produced_. It is the bad tone that is difficult.\n\nA considerable part of voice-training must be devoted to _getting rid of\nresistance_, that is, effort at the wrong point.\n\nGood voice-production is based on the _right idea_ of tone and right\nconditions of the instrument.\n\nThe study of singing should be _an invigorating and inspiring form_ of\nexercise.\n\nTo sing _well_ is an accomplishment _well_ worth the time and effort\ninvolved.\n\n\nAIM OF THE BOOK\n\nAn adequate treatment of breath-control, vowel-formation, vowel-color,\ntone-quality, resonance, consonants, phonetic spelling, diction, the\nhead voice.\n\nAmple exercises for flexibility.\n\nAn illuminating discussion of interpretation, and how to study a song.\n\nAn outline of the principles of interpretation as a basis of criticism.\n\nPurchase of outside material unnecessary.\n\nThe book is COMPLETE in itself, with ample text, nearly 150 exercises\nand studies, 25 songs and 7 duets.\n\n PRICE, $1.25\n\n\nFor Additional Teaching Material\n\n_Art Songs for School and Studio_ (FIRST YEAR)\n\nEDITED BY MABELLE GLENN and ALFRED SPOUSE\n\n Issued in Two Editions--Medium High--Medium Low--$1.00 each\n\n\n_Art Songs for School and Studio_ (SECOND YEAR)\n\n_Edited by_ MABELLE GLENN and ALFRED SPOUSE\n\n Issued in two editions--Medium High--Medium Low--$1.00 _each_\n\nBecause of the success of the _First Year_ book and the demand for a\nsecond book, a step in advance, this collection has been issued. It\ncontains twenty-three second-year songs, including two duets, from the\nworks of Brahms, Densmore, Franz, Fisher, Grieg, Henschel, Jensen,\nManney, Schubert, Schumann, Sinding, Strickland, Tchaikovsky and Watts.\n\nThe editors have added helpful notes to each of the songs and the volume\nincludes hints on Teaching Procedure, Diction, and the Principles of\nSinging.\n\n\n\n\nMUSIC APPRECIATION\n\nBased on Methods of Literary Criticism\n\nBy CLARENCE G.

Aiken=, _Director of Music_, Cincinnati, Ohio:\n\n\"One of the best, in my opinion, of anything thus far in print leading\nto music appreciation through music analysis: telling the pupil what to\nstudy and how.\"\n\n=Arthur Foote=, Boston, Mass.\n\n\"The scheme is a new one and seems to me of much practical value. The\nanalyses are lucid and just the thing to teach the pupil how to think\nand work out such matters for himself.\"\n\n=H. D.

The music selected as a basis of study is such as\nthe student would be expected to be acquainted with. The scheme avoids\non the one side mechanical dryness and on the other vague and valueless\nrhapsody. With this book sterile study is well-nigh impossible.\"\n\n=Mrs. Frank A. Seiberling=, _President_ National Federation of Music\nClubs:\n\n\"The book will be invaluable to use in music clubs as a means of getting\na fundamental understanding of the history of music and the various\nforms of compositions.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1086,"split":"train"}
