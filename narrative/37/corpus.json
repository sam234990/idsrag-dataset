They find the blue jacket and brown shoes on a scarecrow, but Peter is apprehensive about lingering in the garden because of his previous experience. Benjamin delays their departure by gathering onions, which he wraps in Peter's handkerchief, hoping to give them to his aunt, Peter's mother. He then takes a casual stroll around the garden, followed by an increasingly nervous Peter.\nRounding a corner, they see a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits on top of the basket for hours, trapping the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He drives the cat from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tale Of Benjamin Bunny, by Beatrix Potter\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

BUNNY\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOne morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.\n\nHe pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.\n\nA gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside\nhim sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.\n\nAs soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road,\nand set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who\nlived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThat wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of\nall lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and\nPeter.\n\nOld Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool\nmittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold\nherbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call\nlavender).\n\nLittle Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.\n\nHe came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of\nhis Cousin Peter.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPeter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red\ncotton pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"Peter,\" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, \"who has got your clothes?\"\n\nPeter replied, \"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\" and described how\nhe had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.\n\nLittle Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr.\nMcGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for\nthe day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPeter said he hoped that it would rain.\n\nAt this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole,\ncalling: \"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"\n\nPeter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.\n\nThey went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the\nbottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.\nPeter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped\nwith an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLittle Benjamin said: \"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate;\nthe proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.\"\n\nPeter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below\nwas newly raked and quite soft.\n\nIt had been sown with lettuces.\n\nThey left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially\nlittle Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLittle Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back\nPeter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the\npocket-handkerchief.\n\nThey took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;\nthere was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.\n\nBenjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.\n\nThen he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with\nonions, as a little present for his Aunt.\n\nPeter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nBenjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.\nHe said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father\nto get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.\n\n(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)\n\nThe lettuces certainly were very fine.\n\nPeter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently\nhe dropped half the onions.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLittle Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree\nwith a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of\nthe garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red\nbrick wall.\n\nThe mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at\nPeter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.\n\nPresently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises\nworse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!\n\nHe was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.\n\nThis is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!\n\nLittle Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no\ntime, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large\nbasket....\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.\n\nPerhaps she liked the smell of onions!\n\nAnyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.\n\nShe sat there for _five hours_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,\nbecause it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it\nmade Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.\n\nThe sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon;\nbut still the cat sat upon the basket.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of\nmortar fell from the wall above.\n\nThe cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of\nthe wall of the upper terrace.\n\nHe was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his\nhand.\n\nHe was looking for his son.\n\nOld Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.\n\nHe took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the\ncat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse,\nscratching off a handful of fur.\n\nThe cat was too much surprised to scratch back.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the\ndoor.\n\nThen he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears,\nand whipped him with the little switch.\n\nThen he took out his nephew Peter.\n\nThen he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the\ngarden.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several\nthings which perplexed him.\n\nIt looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a\npair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!\n\nAlso he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut\nherself up _inside_ the greenhouse, locking the door upon the _outside_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see\nthat he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the\npocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung\nthem from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the\nrabbit-tobacco.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Tale Of Benjamin Bunny, by Beatrix Potter\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF BENJAMIN BUNNY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14407.txt or 14407.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/4\/4\/0\/14407\/\n\nProduced by Robert Cicconetti and the PG Online Distributed\nProofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":37,"split":"train"}
