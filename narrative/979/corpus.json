{"ori_id":"e1a5be12e8c521868c2f4c7485797ffa7e0acd9d","title":"The Little French Lawyer","context":"The Little French Lawyer\n The play is set in Paris, and opens with two Frenchmen, the friends Dinant and Cleremont, discussing the ethics and manners of duelling. Dinant is disconsolate, because the woman he loves, Lamira, is marrying a rich old man named Champernell. Champernell won fame and fortune fighting at sea; but now he is crippled in an arm and a leg. Dinant and Cleremont confront the wedding party as they leave the church; the two mock and insult the new-made man and wife. Champernell tries to fight back, but his injuries prevent him; both groom and bride are reduced to tears of frustration (him) and embarrassment (her). They are not without defenders, however: afterward, Lamira's brother Beaupre and Champernell's nephew Verdone meet Dinant and Cleremont, and challenge them to meet on the \"field of honor\".\nThe challenge is spied upon, by Lamira's old Nurse; Lamira foresaw this event, and is terrified that her brother will be killed by Dinant. To avoid this, Lamira summons Dinant, and complains that her honor has been insulted. Dinant agrees to meet her slanderer and defend her, even though he will miss his appointment with Beaupre and Verdone. Cleremont makes that appointment in a cold dawn, and is distressed to find himself alone against two potential combatants. To avoid fighting both or yielding his sword, he must obtain a second. He solicits passers-by but finds no one, until he encounters a diminutive lawyer named La-Writ, who is poring over his court documents as he walks toward the city. Cleremont manages to bully, cajole, and persuade the attorney to second him in the duel, even though La-Writ has never drawn his sword in anger in his life. Through a stroke of beginner's luck, La-Writ manages to disarm Beaupre, and then rescue Cleremont by disarming Verdone too. The two losers have to return to the city without their swords, and a buoyant-spirited La-Writ resumes his way.\nMeanwhile, Dinant has wasted two hours, waiting to encounter a person who does not exist. As he suspects he's been fooled, he meets a swaggering and wild-talking La-Writ, and believes he's found the man he means to fight. Before they can duel, Cleremont breaks in upon them, and informs Dinant that the little lawyer is the man who saved his honor by taking his place in the morning's duel. La-Writ is now so transported with exaltation that he neglects his law practice to devote his time to quarreling with the town bravos.\nWhen Champernell learns that Verdone and Beaupre have been defeated, he is irate and disgusted. Verdone explains that Dinant did not appear that morning, but that his place was taken by \"a Devil hir'd from some Magician,\/ I'th' shape of an Attorney\". Verdone accuses Dinant of cowardice \u2014 and Lamira surprises everyone by defending her former suitor's reputation. Champernell is distressed and angered by this; but Lamira takes the upper hand by threatening to run away if he doubts her virtue. Her husband backs down, and Lamira decides to teach Dinant a lesson for hoping to make her an adulteress.\nLamira summons Dinant to a tryst; Cleremont comes with him. To complete their tryst, Lamira tells Cleremont that he must take her place in bed with her husband: the old man has a habit of reaching out to feel if she's still in bed, and if he feels no one, he'll be alarmed. Cleremont is humiliated to be put in this position \u2014 but his friendship for Dinant leads him to agree. Dinant thinks that he will finally enjoy Lamira; but she talks loudly, lights the lights, and has music played, spoiling the secrecy of the moment. It turns out that Cleremont has been lying in bed not with the old man, but with his sixteen-year-old niece Anabel. Champernell, Beaupre, and Verdone laugh at the discomfiture of their two rivals.\nLa-Writ is now so passionate about quarreling that he fails to appear in court, and his cases are dismissed by the judge Vertaigne (who is also Lamira's father). La-Writ writes a challenge to the judge, and asks Cleremont to deliver it. This presents Cleremont with a dilemma: the code of duelling will not allow him to refuse to deliver the challenge \u2014 but delivering it to a judge will quickly land him in jail. He handles the matter by pretending that the challenge is a joke. Vertaigne takes it so, and sends his kinsman Sampson, another lawyer, to meet La-Writ in his place. When the two meet, their seconds, in pretending to observe the punctillios of the duelling code, deprive them of their swords and doublets \u2014 and then run off, leaving the two would-be duellists without swords, horses, or coats in the cold morning air.\nDinant and Cleremont plan to gain revenge on those who have embarrassed them. As Champernell, Vertaigne and their party are travelling to a country house, they are waylaid by a group of pretended bandits. Dinant and Cleremont appear to come to their rescue, and in the tumult and confusion the party is separated and the two old men are left alone in the woods. Champernell and Vertaigne soon stumble into La-Writ and Sampson. La-Writ is still talking big, full of his fictitious prowess; an irritated Champernell finally knocks him to the ground. Sampson is driven off, and Champernell beats La-Writ until the repentant attorney agrees to give up fighting and return to lawyering once again.\nIn the clutches of the feigned bandits, Lamira is frightened, but Anabel is determined to fight to preserve her honor. Cleremont, pretending to be a rescuer, absconds with Anabel to a waiting priest. Dinant confronts Lamira, who is repentant for tricking him, but still determined to preserve her virtue; and Dinant reconciles with her. At the end of the play, hard feelings are dispelled with a new understanding and tolerance, and a new couple in Cleremont and Anabel.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Little French Lawyer, by \nFrancis Beaumont and John Fletcher\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

'tis a new one,\nNo more on't, burn't, give it to some Orator,\nTo help him to enlarge his exercise,\nWith such a one it might do well, and profit\nThe Curat of the Parish, but for _Cleremont_,\nThe bold, and undertaking _Cleremont_,\nTo talk thus to his friend, his friend that knows him,\n_Dinant_ that knows his _Cleremont_, is absurd,\nAnd meer Apocrypha.\n\n_Cler._ Why, what know you of me?\n\n_Din._ Why if thou hast forgot thy self, I'le tell thee,\nAnd not look back, to speak of what thou wert\nAt fifteen, for at those years I have heard\nThou wast flesh'd, and enter'd bravely.\n\n_Cler._ Well Sir, well.\n\n_Din._ But yesterday, thou wast the common second,\nOf all that only knew thee, thou hadst bills\nSet up on every post, to give thee notice\nWhere any difference was, and who were parties;\nAnd as to save the charges of the Law\nPoor men seek arbitrators, thou wert chosen\nBy such as knew thee not, to compound quarrels:\nBut thou wert so delighted with the sport,\nThat if there were no just cause, thou wouldst make one,\nOr be engag'd thy self: This goodly calling\nThou hast followed five and twenty years, and studied\nThe Criticismes of contentions, and art thou\nIn so few hours transform'd? certain this night\nThou hast had strange dreams, or rather visions.\n\n_Clere._ Yes, Sir,\nI have seen fools, and fighters, chain'd together,\nAnd the Fighters had the upper hand, and whipt first,\nThe poor Sots laughing at 'em. What I have been\nIt skils not, what I will be is resolv'd on.\n\n_Din._ Why then you'l fight no more?\n\n_Cler._ Such is my purpose.\n\n_Din._ On no occasion?\n\n_Cler._ There you stagger me.\nSome kind of wrongs there are which flesh and blood\nCannot endure.\n\n_Din._ Thou wouldst not willingly\nLive a protested coward, or be call'd one?\n\n_Cler._ Words are but words.\n\n_Din._ Nor wouldst thou take a blow?\n\n_Cler._ Not from my friend, though drunk, and from an enemy\nI think much less.\n\n_Din._ There's some hope of thee left then,\nWouldst thou hear me behind my back disgrac'd?\n\n_Cler._ Do you think I am a rogue? they that should do it\nHad better been born dumb.\n\n_Din._ Or in thy presence\nSee me o'recharg'd with odds?\n\n_Cler._ I'd fall my self first.\n\n_Din._ Would'st thou endure thy Mistris be taken from thee,\nAnd thou sit quiet?\n\n_Cler._ There you touch my honour,\nNo French-man can endure that.\n\n_Di[n]._ Pl---- upon thee,\nWhy dost thou talk of Peace then? that dar'st suffer\nNothing, or in thy self, or in thy friend\nThat is unmanly?\n\n_Cler._ That I grant, I cannot:\nBut I'le not quarrel with this Gentleman\nFor wearing stammel Breeches, or this Gamester\nFor playing a thousand pounds, that owes me nothing;\nFor this mans taking up a common Wench\nIn raggs, and lowsie, then maintaining her\nCaroach'd in cloth of Tissue, nor five hundred\nOf such like toyes, that at no part concern me;\nMarry, where my honour, or my friend is questioned,\nI have a Sword, and I think I may use it\nTo the cutting of a Rascals throat, or so,\nLike a good Christian.\n\n_Din._ Thou art of a fine Religion,\nAnd rather than we'l make a Schism in friendship\nI will be of it: But to be serious,\nThou art acquainted with my tedious love-suit\nTo fair _Lamira_?\n\n_Cler._ Too well Sir, and remember\nYour presents, courtship, that's too good a name,\nYour slave-like services, your morning musique;\nYour walking three hours in the rain at midnight,\nTo see her at her window, sometimes laugh'd at,\nSometimes admitted, and vouchsaf'd to kiss\nHer glove, her skirt, nay, I have heard, her slippers,\nHow then you triumph'd?\nHere was love forsooth.\n\n_Din._ These follies I deny not,\nSuch a contemptible thing my dotage made me,\nBut my reward for this--\n\n_Cler._ As you deserv'd,\nFor he that makes a goddess of a Puppet,\nMerits no other recompence.\n\n_Din._ This day friend,\nFor thou art so--\n\n_Cler._ I am no flatterer.\n\n_Din._ This proud, ingratefull she, is married to\nLame _Champernel_.\n\n_Cler._ I know him, he has been\nAs tall a Sea-man, and has thriv'd as well by't,\nThe loss of a legg and an arm deducted, as any\nThat ever put from _Marseilles_: you are tame,\nPl---- on't, it mads me; if it were my case,\nI should kill all the family.\n\n_Din._ Yet but now\nYou did preach patience.\n\n_Cler._ I then came from confession,\nAnd 'twas enjoyn'd me three hours for a penance,\nTo be a peaceable man, and to talk like one,\nBut now, all else being pardon'd, I begin\nOn a new Tally, Foot do any thing,\nI'le second you.\n\n_Din._ I would not willingly\nMake red, my yet white conscience, yet I purpose\nIn the open street, as they come from the Temple,\n(For this way they must pass,) to speak my wrongs,\nAnd do it boldly.                             [_Musick playes._\n\n_Cler._ Were thy tongue a Cannon,\nI would stand by thee, boy, they come, upon 'em.\n\n_Din._ Observe a little first.\n\n_Cler._ This is fine fidling.\n\n   _Enter_ Vertaign, Champernel, Lamira, _Nurse_, Beaupre,\n   Verdone. _An Epithalamium._\n\n    SONG at the Wedding.\n\n    _Come away, bring on the Bride\n    And place her by her Lovers side:\n    You fair troop of Maids attend her,\n    Pure and holy thoughts befriend her.\n    Blush, and wish, you Virgins all,\n    Many such fair nights may fall._\n\n    Chorus.\n\n    _Hymen, fill the house with joy,\n    All thy sacred fires employ:\n    Bless the Bed with holy love,\n    Now fair orb of Beauty move._\n\n_Din._ Stand by, for I'le be heard.\n\n_Verta._ This is strange rudeness.\n\n_Din._ 'Tis courtship, ballanced with injuries,\nYou all look pale with guilt, but I will dy\nYour cheeks with blushes, if in your sear'd veins\nThere yet remain so much of honest blood\nTo make the colour; first to ye my Lord,\nThe Father of this Bride, whom you have sent\nAlive into her grave.\n\n_Champ._ How? to her grave?\n\n_Dina._ Be patient Sir, I'le speak of you anon\nYou that allow'd me liberal access,\nTo make my way with service, and approv'd of\nMy birth, my person, years, and no base fortune:\nYou that are rich, and but in this held wise too,\nThat as a Father should have look'd upon\nYour Daughter in a husband, and aim'd more\nAt what her youth, and heat of blood requir'd\nIn lawfull pleasures, than the parting from\nYour Crowns to pay her dowr: you that already\nHave one foot in the grave, yet study profit,\nAs if you were assur'd to live here ever;\nWhat poor end had you, in this choice? in what\nDeserve I your contempt? my house, and honours\nAt all parts equal yours, my fame as fair,\nAnd not to praise my self, the City ranks me\nIn the first file of her most hopefull Gentry:\nBut _Champernel_ is rich, and needs a nurse,\nAnd not your gold: and add to that, he's old too,\nHis whole estate in likelihood to descend\nUpon your Family; Here was providence,\nI grant, but in a Nobleman base thrift:\nNo Merchants, nay, no Pirats, sell for Bondmen\nTheir Country-men, but you, a Gentleman,\nTo save a little gold, have sold your Daughter\nTo worse than slaverie.\n\n_Cler._ This was spoke home indeed.\n\n_Beau._ Sir, I shall take some other time to tell you,\nThat this harsh language was delivered to\nAn old man, but my Father.\n\n_Din._ At your pleasure.\n\n_Cler._ Proceed in your design, let me alone,\nTo answer him, or any man.\n\n_Verd._ You presume\nToo much upon your name, but may be couzen'd.\n\n_Din._ But for you, most unmindfull of my service,\nFor now I may upbraid you, and with honour,\nSince all is lost, and yet I am a gainer,\nIn being deliver'd from a torment in you,\nFor such you must have been, you to whom nature\nGave with a liberal hand most excellent form,\nYour education, language, and discourse,\nAnd judgement to distinguish, when you shall\nWith feeling sorrow understand how wretched\nAnd miserable you have made your self,\nAnd but your self have nothing to accuse,\nCan you with hope from any beg compassion?\nBut you will say, you serv'd your Fathers pleasure,\nForgetting that unjust commands of Parents\nAre not to be obey'd, or that you are rich,\nAnd that to wealth all pleasure else are servants,\nYet but consider, how this wealth was purchas'd,\n'Twill trouble the possession.\n\n_Champ._ You Sir know\nI got it, and with honour.\n\n_Din._ But from whom?\nRemember that, and how: you'l come indeed\nTo houses bravely furnish'd, but demanding\nWhere it was bought, this Souldier will not lie,\nBut answer truly, this rich cloth of Arras\nI made my prize in such a Ship, this Plate\nWas my share in another; these fair Jewels,\nComing a shore, I got in such a Village,\nThe Maid, or Matron kill'd, from whom they were ravish'd,\nThe Wines you drink are guilty too, for this,\nThis _Candie_ Wine, three Merchants were undone,\nThese Suckets break as many more: in brief,\nAll you shall wear, or touch, or see, is purchas'd\nBy lawless force, and you but revel in\nThe tears, and grones of such as were the owners.\n\n_Champ._ 'Tis false, most basely false.\n\n_Verta._ Let losers talk.\n\n_Din._ Lastly, those joyes, those best of joyes, which _Hymen_\nFreely bestows on such, that come to tye\nThe sacred knot be blesses, won unto it\nBy equal love, and mutual affection,\nNot blindly led with the desire of riches,\nMost miserable you shall never taste of.\nThis Marriage night you'l meet a Widows bed,\nOr failing of those pleasures all Brides look for,\nSin in your wish it were so.\n\n_Champ._ Thou art a Villain,\nA base, malitious slanderer.\n\n_Cler._ Strike him.\n\n_Din._ No, he is not worth a blow.\n\n_Champ._ O that I had thee\nIn some close vault, that only would yield room\nTo me to use my Sword, to thee no hope\nTo run away, I would make thee on thy knees,\nBite out the tongue that wrong'd me.\n\n_Verta._ Pray you have patience.\n\n_Lamira._ This day I am to be your Soveraign,\nLet me command you.\n\n_Champ._ I am lost with rage,\nAnd know not what I am my self, nor you:\nAway, dare such as you, that love the smoke\nOf peace more than the fire of glorious War,\nAnd like unprofitable drones, feed on\nYour grandsires labours, that, as I am now,\nWere gathering Bees, and fill'd their Hive, this Country\nWith brave triumphant spoils, censure our actions?\nYou object my prizes to me, had you seen\nThe horrour of a Sea-fight, with what danger\nI made them mine; the fire I fearless fought in,\nAnd quench'd it in mine enemies blood, which straight\nLike oyle pour'd out on't, made it burn anew;\nMy Deck blown up, with noise enough to mock\nThe lowdest thunder, and the desperate fools\nThat Boorded me, sent, to defie the tempests\nThat were against me, to the angrie Sea,\nFrighted with men thrown o're; no victory,\nBut in despight of the four Elements,\nThe Fire, the Air, the Sea, and sands hid in it\nTo be atchiev'd, you would confess poor men,\n(Though hopeless, such an honourable way\nTo get or wealth, or honour) in your selves\nHe that through all these dreadfull passages\nPursued and overtook them, unaffrighted,\nDeserves reward, and not to have it stil'd\nBy the base name of theft.\n\n_Din._ This is the Courtship,\nThat you must look for, Madam.\n\n_Cler._ 'Twill do well,\nWhen nothing can be done, to spend the night with:\nYour tongue is sound good Lord, and I could wish\nFor this young Ladyes sake this leg, this arm,\nAnd there is something else, I will not name,\n(Though 'tis the only thing that must content her)\nHad the same vigour.\n\n_Champ._ You shall buy these scoffs\nWith your best blood: help me once noble anger,\n(Nay stir not, I alone must right my self)\nAnd with one leg transport me, to correct\nThese scandalous praters: O that noble wounds      [_Falls._\nShould hinder just revenge! D'ye jear me too?\nI got these, not as you do, your diseases\nIn Brothels, or with riotous abuse\nOf wine in Taverns; I have one leg shot,\nOne arm disabled, and am honour'd more,\nBy losing them, as I did, in the face\nOf a brave enemy, than if they were\nAs when I put to Sea; you are _French-men_ only,\nIn that you have been laied, and cur'd, goe to:\nYou mock my leg, but every bone about you,\nMakes you good Almanack-makers, to foretell\nWhat weather we shall have.\n\n_Din._ Put up your Sword.\n\n_Cler._ Or turn it to a Crutch, there't may b[e] usefull,\nAnd live on the relation to your Wife\nOf what a brave man you were once.\n\n_Din._ And tell her,\nWhat a fine vertue 'tis in a young Lady\nTo give an old man pap.\n\n_Cler._ Or hire a Surgeon\nTo teach her to roul up your broken limbs.\n\n_Din._ To make a Pultess, and endure the scent\nOf oils, and nasty Plasters.\n\n_Verta._ Fie Sir, fie,\nYou that have stood all dangers of all kinds, to\nYield to a Rivalls scoffe?\n\n_Lamira._ Shed tears upon\nYour Wedding day? this is unmanly Gentlemen.\n\n_Champ._ They are tears of anger: O that I should live\nTo play the woman thus! All powerfull heaven,\nRestore me, but one hour, that strength again,\nThat I had once, to chastise in these men\nTheir folies, and ill manners, and that done,\nWhen you please, I'le yield up the fort of life,\nAnd do it gladly.\n\n_Cler._ We ha' the better of him,\nWe ha' made him cry.\n\n_Verdo._ You shall have satisfaction.\nAnd I will do it nobly, or disclaim me.\n\n_Beaup._ I say no more, you have a Brother, Sister,\nThis is your wedding day, we are in the street,\nAnd howsoever they forget their honour,\n'Tis fit I lose not mine, by their example.\n\n_Vert._ If there be Laws in _Paris_, look to answer\nThis insolent affront.\n\n_Cler._ You that live by them,\nStudy 'em for heavens sake; for my part I know not\nNor care not what they are. Is the[re] ought else\nThat you would say;\n\n_Din._ Nothing, I have my ends.\n_Lamira_ weeps, I have said too much I fear;\nSo dearly once I lov'd her, that I cannot\nEndure to see her tears.      [_Exeunt_ Dinant, _and_ Cleremont.\n\n_Champ._ See you perform it,\nAnd do it like my Nephew.\n\n_Verdo._ If I fail in't\nNe'r know me more, Cousin _Beaupre_.\n\n_Champ._ Repent not\nWhat thou hast done, my life, thou shalt not find\nI am decrepit; in my love and service,\nI will be young, and constant, and believe me,\nFor thou shalt find it true, in scorn of all\nThe scandals these rude men have thrown upon me\nI'le meet thy pleasures with a young mans ardour,\nAnd in all circumstances of a Husband,\nPerform my part.\n\n_Lamira._ Good Sir, I am your servant,\nAnd 'tis too late now, if I did repent,\n(Which as I am a virgin yet, I do not)\nTo undoe the knot, that by the Church is tyed.\nOnly I would beseech ye, as you have\nA good opinion of me, and my vertues,\nFor so you have pleas'd to stile my innocent weakness,\nThat what hath pass'd be[t]ween _Dinant_ and me,\nOr what now in your hearing he hath spoken,\nBeget not doubts, or fears.\n\n_Champ._ I apprehend you,\nYou think I will be jealous; as I live\nThou art mistaken sweet; and to confirm it\nDiscourse with whom thou wilt, ride where thou wilt,\nFeast whom thou wilt, as often as thou wilt,\nFor I will have no other guards upon thee\nThan thine own thoughts.\n\n_Lamira._ I'le use this liberty\nWith moderation Sir.\n\n_Beaup._ I am resolv'd.\nSteal off, I'le follow you.\n\n_Champ._ Come Sir, you droop;\nTill you find cause, which I shall never give,\nDislike not of your Son in Law.\n\n_Verta._ Sir, you teach me\nThe language I should use; I am most happy\nIn being so near you.      [_Exeunt_ Verdone, _and_ Beaupre.\n\n_Lamira._ O my fears! good nurse\nFollow my Brother unobserv'd, and learn\nWhich way he takes.\n\n_Nurs._ I will be carefull Madam.      [_Exit_ Nurse.\n\n_Champ._ Between us complements are superfluous,\nOn Gentlemen, th' affront we have met here\nWe'l think upon hereafter, 'twere unfit\nTo cherish any thought to breed unrest,\nOr to our selves, or to our Nuptial feast.      [_Exeunt._\n\n    _Enter_ Dinant, _and_ Cleremont.\n\n_Cler._ We shall have sport, ne'r fear't.\n\n_Din._ What sport I prethee?\n\n_Cler._ Why we must fight, I know it, and I long for't,\nIt was apparent in the fiery eye\nOf young _Verdone_, _Beaupre_ look'd pale and shook too,\nFamiliar signs of anger. They are both brave fellows\nTri'd and approv'd, and I am proud to encounter\nWith men, from whom no honour can be lost;\nThey will play up to a man, and set him off.\nWhen e're I go to the field, heaven keep me from\nThe meeting of an unflesh'd youth or, Coward,\nThe first, to get a name, comes on too hot,\nThe Coward is so swift in giving ground,\nThere is no overtaking him without\nA hunting Nag, well breath'd too.\n\n_Din._ All this while,\nYou ne'r think on the danger.\n\n_Cler._ Why 'tis no more\nThan meeting of a dozen friends at Supper,\nAnd drinking hard; mischief comes there unlook'd for,\nI am sure as suddain, and strikes home as often,\nFor this we are prepar'd.\n\n_Din._ _Lamira_ Loves\nHer Brother _Beaupre_ dearly.\n\n_Cler._ What of that?\n\n_Din._ And should he call me to account for what\nBut now I spake, nor can I with mine honour\nRecant my words, that little hope is left me,\nE're to enjoy what (next to Heaven) I long for,\nIs taken from me.\n\n_Cer._ Why what can you hope for,\nShe being now married?\n\n_Din._ Oh my _Cleremont_,\nTo you all secrets of my heart lye open,\nAnd I rest most secure that whatsoe're\nI lock up there, is as a private thought,\nAnd will no farther wrong me. I am a _French-man_,\nAnd for the greater part we are born Courtiers,\nShe is a woman, and however yet,\nNo heat of service had the power to melt\nHer frozen Chastity, time and opportunitie\nMay work her to my ends, I confess ill ones,\nAnd yet I must pursue 'em: now her marriage,\nIn probabilitie, will no way hurt,\nBut rather help me.\n\n_Cler._ Sits the wind there? pray you tell me\nHow far off dwells your love from lust?\n\n_Din._ Too near,\nBut prethee chide me not.\n\n_Cler._ Not I, goe on boy,\nI have faults my self, and will not reprehend\nA crime I am not free from: for her Marriage,\nI do esteem it (and most batchellors are\nOf my opinion) as a fair protection,\nTo play the wanton without loss of honour.\n\n_Din._ Would she make use of't so, I were most happy.\n\n_Cler._ No more of this. Judge now,\nWhether I have the gift of prophecie.\n\n    _Enter_ Beaupre, _and_ Verdone.\n\n_Beaup._ Monsieur _Dinant_,\nI am glad to find you, Sir.\n\n_Din._ I am at your service.\n\n_Verd._ Good Monsieur _Cleremont_, I have long wish'd\nTo be known better to you.\n\n_Cler._ My desires\nEmbrace your wishes Sir.\n\n_Beaup._ Sir, I have ever\nEsteem'd you truly noble, and profess\nI should have been most proud, to have had the honour\nTo call you Brother, but my Fathers pleasure\nDenied that happiness. I know no man lives,\nThat can command his passions, and therefore\nDare not condemn the late intemperate language\nYou were pleas'd to use to my Father and my Sister,\nHe's old and she a woman, I most sorrie\nMy honour does compel me to entreat you,\nTo do me the favour, with your sword to meet me\nA mile without the Citie.\n\n_Din._ You much honour me.\nIn the demand, I'le gladly wait upon you.\n\n_Beaup._ O Sir you teach me what to say: the time?\n\n_Din._ With the next Sun, if you think fit.\n\n_Beaup._ The place?\n\n_Din._ Near to the vineyard eastward from the Citie.\n\n_Beaup._ I like it well, this Gentleman if you please\nWill keep me company.\n\n_Cler._ That is agreed on;\nAnd in my friends behalf I will attend him.\n\n_Verd._ You shall not miss my service.\n\n_Beaup._ Good day Gentlemen.      [_Ex._ Beaup. _and_ Verd.\n\n_Din._ At your Commandment.\n\n_Cler._ Proud to be your servants.\nI think there is no Nation under Heaven\nThat cut their enemies throats with complement,\nAnd such fine tricks as we do: If you have\nAny few Prayers to say, this night you may\nCall 'em to mind and use 'em, for my self,\nAs I have little to lose, my care is less,\nSo till to morrow morning I bequeath you\nTo your devotions; and those paid, but use\nThat noble courage I have seen, and we\nShall fight, as in a Castle.\n\n_Din._ Thou art all honour,\nThy resolution would steel a Coward,\nAnd I most fortunate in such a Friend;\nAll tenderness and nice respect of woman\nBe now far from me, reputation take\nA full possession of my heart, and prove\nHonour the first place holds, the second Love.

Lady._ I am sorry, I have troubled you,\nMore sorrie, that my Lady has adventur'd\nSo great a favour in so weak a mind:\nThis hour you have refus'd that when you come to know it,\nWill run you mad, and make you curse that fellow,\nShe is not fair, nor handsom, so I leave you.\n\n_Cler._ Stay Lady, stay, but is there such a business?\n\n_O. Lady._ You would break your neck 'twere yours.\n\n_Cler._ My back, you would say.\n\n_O. La._ But play the friends part still, Sir, and undoe him,\n'Tis a fair office.\n\n_Din._ I have spoke too liberally.\n\n_O. Lady._ I shall deliver what you say.\n\n_Cler._ You shall be hang'd first,\nYou would fain be prating now; take the man with you.\n\n_O.

Lady._ 'Tis in's own will, I had no further charge, Sir,\nThan to tell him what I did, which if I had thought\nIt should have been receiv'd so--\n\n_Cler._ 'Faith you may,\nYou do not know how far it may concern you.\nIf I perceiv'd any trick in't.\n\n_Din._ 'Twill end there.\n\n_Cler._ 'Tis my fault then, there is an hour in fortune,\nThat must be still observ'd: you think I'le chide you,\nWhen things must be, nay see, an he will hold his head up?\nWould such a Lady send, with such a charge too?\nSay she has plaid the fool, play the fool with her again,\nThe great fool, the greater still the better.\nHe shall goe with you woman.\n\n_Old Lady._ As it please him,\nI know the way alone else.\n\n_Din._ Where is your Lady?\n\n_O. Lady._ I shall direct you quickly.\n\n_Din._ Well, I'le goe,\nBut what her wrongs will give me leave to say.\n\n_Cler._ We'll leave that to your selves: I shall hear from you.\n\n_Din._ As soon as I come off--\n\n_Cler._ Come on then bravely;\nFarewel till then, and play the man.\n\n_Din._ You are merry;\nAll I expect is scorn: I'le lead you Lady.

In contempt of you\nI love _Dinant_, mine enemy, nay admire him,\nHis valour claims it from me, and with justice,\nHe that could fight thus, in a cause not honest,\nHis sword edg'd with defence of right and honour,\nWould pierce as deep as lightning, with that speed too,\nAnd kill as deadly.\n\n_Verd._ You are as far from justice\nIn him you praise, as equitie in the censure\nYou load me with.\n\n_Beaup._ _Dinant?_ he durst not meet us.\n\n_Lam._ How? durst not, Brother?\n\n_Beaup._ Durst not, I repeat it.\n\n_Verd._ Nor was it _Cleremont_'s valour that disarm'd us,\nI had the better of him; for _Dinant_,\nIf that might make my peace with you, I dare\nWrite him a Coward upon every post,\nAnd with the hazard of my life defend it.\n\n_Lam._ If 'twere laid at the stake you'd lose it, Nephew.\n\n_Cham._ Came he not, say you?\n\n_Verd._ No, but in his room,\nThere was a Devil, hir'd from some Magician\nI'th' shape of an Atturney.\n\n_Beau._ 'Twas he did it.\n\n_Verd._ And his the honour.\n\n_Beau._ I could wish _Dinant_--\nBut what talk I of one that stept aside,\nAnd durst not come?\n\n_Lam._ I am such a friend to truth,\nI cannot hear this: why do you detract\nThus poorly (I should say to others basely)\nFrom one of such approv'd worth?\n\n_Cham._ Ha! how's this?\n\n_Lam._ From one so excellent in all that's noble,\nWhose only weakness is excess of courage?\nThat knows no enemies, that he cannot master,\nBut his affections, and in them, the worst\nHis love to me.\n\n_Cham._ To you?\n\n_Lam._ Yes, Sir, to me,\nI dare (for what is that which Innocence dares not)\nTo you profess it: and he shun'd not the Combat\nFor fear or doubt of these: blush and repent,\nThat you in thought e're did that wrong to valour.\n\n_Beaup._ Why, this is rare.\n\n_Cham._ 'Fore heaven, exceeding rare;\nWhy modest Lady, you that sing such Encomiums\nOf your first Suiter--\n\n_Verd._ How can ye convince us\nIn your reports?\n\n_Lam._ With what you cannot answer,\n'Twas my command that staid him.\n\n_Cham._ Your command?\n\n_Lam._ Mine, Sir, and had my will rank'd with my power,\nAnd his obedience, I could have sent him\nWith more ease, weaponless to you, and bound,\nThan have kept him back, so well he loves his honour\nBeyond his life.\n\n_Cham._ Better, and better still.\n\n_Lam._ I wrought with him in private to divert him\nFrom your assur'd destruction, had he met you.\n\n_Cham._ In private?\n\n_Lam._ Yes, and us'd all Arts, all Charms\nOf one that knew her self the absolute Mistris\nOf all his faculties.\n\n_Cham._ Gave all rewards too\nHis service could deserve; did not he take\nThe measure of my sheets?\n\n_Lam._ Do not look yellow,\nI have cause to speak; frowns cannot fright me,\nBy all my hopes, as I am spotless to you,\nIf I rest once assur'd you do but doubt me,\nOr curb me of that freedom you once gave me--\n\n_Cham._ What then?\n\n_Lam._ I'le not alone abuse your bed, that's nothing,\nBut to your more vexation, 'tis resolv'd on,\nI'le run away, and then try if _Dinant_\nHave courage to defend me.\n\n_Champ._ Impudent!\n\n_Verd._ And on the sudden--\n\n_Beau._ How are ye transform'd\nFrom what you were?\n\n_Lam._ I was an innocent Virgin,\nAnd I can truly swear, a Wife as pure\nAs ever lay by Husband, and will dy so,\nLet me live unsuspected, I am no servant,\nNor will be us'd like one: If you desire\nTo keep me constant as I would be, let\nTrust and belief in you beget and nurse it;\nUnnecessary jealousies make more whores\nThan all baits else laid to entrap our frailties.\n\n_Beau._ There's no contesting with her, from a child\nOnce mov'd, she hardly was to be appeas'd,\nYet I dare swear her honest.\n\n_Cham._ So I think too,\nOn better judgement: I am no Italian\nTo lock her up; nor would I be a Dutchman,\nTo have my Wife, my soveraign, to command me:\nI'le try the gentler way, but if that fail,\nBelieve it, Sir, there's nothing but extreams\nWhich she must feel from me.\n\n_Beau._ That, as you please, Sir.\n\n_Charl._ You have won the breeches, Madam, look up sweetly,\nMy Lord limps toward you.\n\n_Lam._ You will learn more manners.\n\n_Charl._ This is a fee, for counsel that's unask'd for.\n\n_Cham._ Come, I mistook thee sweet, prethee forgive me,\nI never will be jealous: e're I cherish\nSuch a mechanick humour, I'le be nothing;\nI'le say, _Dinant_ is all that thou wouldst have him,\nWill that suffice?\n\n_Lam._ 'Tis well, Sir.\n\n_Cham._ Use thy freedom\nUncheck'd, and unobserv'd, if thou wilt have it,\nThese shall forget their honour, I my wrongs.\nWe'll all dote on him, hell be my reward\nIf I dissemble.\n\n_Lam._ And that hell take me\nIf I affect him, he's a lustfull villain,\n(But yet no coward) and sollicites me\nTo my dishonour, that's indeed a quarrel,\nAnd truly mine, which I will so revenge,\nAs it shall fright such as dare only think\nTo be adulterers.\n\n_Cham._ Use thine own waies,\nI give up all to thee.\n\n_Beau._ O women, women!\nWhen you are pleas'd you are the least of evils.\n\n_Verd._ I'le rime to't, but provokt, the worst of Devils.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":979,"split":"train"}
