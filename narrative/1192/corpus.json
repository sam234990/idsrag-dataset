{"ori_id":"3988c295053fe9eb18747b735259fe78a7e760fd","title":"Indiscretions of Archie","context":"Indiscretions of Archie\n The novel tells the story of impoverished, embarrassment-prone Archibald \"Archie\" Moffam (pronounced \"Moom\") and his difficult relationship with his art-collecting, hotel-owning, millionaire father-in-law Daniel Brewster, who is the father of Archie's new bride Lucille. Archie's attempts to ingratiate himself with Brewster only get him further into trouble. The story takes place in New York City.Archie Moffam is an Englishman in New York. Like Bertie Wooster he\u2019s kind hearted but mentally limited, if not negligible. Unlike Bertie he has no private income. He\u2019s a veteran of the First World War.\nDuring a stay in New York he bitterly criticises the service at the Cosmopolis Hotel, thus making an enemy of its owner, Daniel Brewster. On a subsequent trip to Miami he meets, falls in love with and marries Brewster\u2019s daughter Lucille. Brewster is not delighted. Archie\u2019s attempts to make amends by finding employment and by purchasing a valuable objet d\u2019art for Brewster end in disaster. Further indiscretions follow for Archie: he upsets Lucille by apparently paying too much attention to an actress; he bets $1000 on the Giants (then a New York baseball team), but gets into a fight with their star pitcher and injures his arm. He advises Lucille\u2019s brother, Bill, who has a habit of getting into relationships with girls of whom his father disapproves, and lends a hand to an old comrade from the war, \u201cThe Sausage Chappie\u201d, who\u2019s lost his memory and forgotten his own name. He upsets Mrs Cora Bates McCall, a vegetarian and healthy food campaigner, by persuading her son to take part in a pie-eating contest. Then there\u2019s an incident with a painting which further upsets Brewster. Eventually he pacifies the old curmudgeon by telling him he\u2019s about to become a grandfather.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Indiscretions of Archie, by P. G.

DISTRESSING SCENE\n\n\n\"I say, laddie!\" said Archie.\n\n\"Sir?\" replied the desk-clerk alertly. All the employes of the Hotel\nCosmopolis were alert. It was one of the things on which Mr. Daniel\nBrewster, the proprietor, insisted. And as he was always wandering about\nthe lobby of the hotel keeping a personal eye on affairs, it was never\nsafe to relax.\n\n\"I want to see the manager.\"\n\n\"Is there anything I could do, sir?\"\n\nArchie looked at him doubtfully.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, my dear old desk-clerk,\" he said, \"I want to\nkick up a fearful row, and it hardly seems fair to lug you into it. Why\nyou, I mean to say? The blighter whose head I want on a charger is the\nbally manager.\"\n\nAt this point a massive, grey-haired man, who had been standing close\nby, gazing on the lobby with an air of restrained severity, as if daring\nit to start anything, joined in the conversation.\n\n\"I am the manager,\" he said.\n\nHis eye was cold and hostile. Others, it seemed to say, might like\nArchie Moffam, but not he. Daniel Brewster was bristling for combat.\nWhat he had overheard had shocked him to the core of his being. The\nHotel Cosmopolis was his own private, personal property, and the thing\ndearest to him in the world, after his daughter Lucille. He prided\nhimself on the fact that his hotel was not like other New York hotels,\nwhich were run by impersonal companies and shareholders and boards of\ndirectors, and consequently lacked the paternal touch which made the\nCosmopolis what it was. At other hotels things went wrong, and clients\ncomplained. At the Cosmopolis things never went wrong, because he was\non the spot to see that they didn't, and as a result clients never\ncomplained. Yet here was this long, thin, string-bean of an Englishman\nactually registering annoyance and dissatisfaction before his very eyes.\n\n\"What is your complaint?\" he enquired frigidly.\n\nArchie attached himself to the top button of Mr. Brewster's coat,\nand was immediately dislodged by an irritable jerk of the other's\nsubstantial body.\n\n\"Listen, old thing! I came over to this country to nose about in search\nof a job, because there doesn't seem what you might call a general\ndemand for my services in England. Directly I was demobbed, the family\nstarted talking about the Land of Opportunity and shot me on to a liner.\nThe idea was that I might get hold of something in America--\"\n\nHe got hold of Mr. Brewster's coat-button, and was again shaken off.\n\n\"Between ourselves, I've never done anything much in England, and I\nfancy the family were getting a bit fed. At any rate, they sent me over\nhere--\"\n\nMr. Brewster disentangled himself for the third time.\n\n\"I would prefer to postpone the story of your life,\" he said coldly,\n\"and be informed what is your specific complaint against the Hotel\nCosmopolis.\"\n\n\"Of course, yes. The jolly old hotel. I'm coming to that. Well, it was\nlike this. A chappie on the boat told me that this was the best place to\nstop at in New York--\"\n\n\"He was quite right,\" said Mr. Brewster.\n\n\"Was he, by Jove! Well, all I can say, then, is that the other New York\nhotels must be pretty mouldy, if this is the best of the lot! I took a\nroom here last night,\" said Archie quivering with self-pity, \"and there\nwas a beastly tap outside somewhere which went drip-drip-drip all night\nand kept me awake.\"\n\nMr. Brewster's annoyance deepened. He felt that a chink had been found\nin his armour. Not even the most paternal hotel-proprietor can keep an\neye on every tap in his establishment.\n\n\"Drip-drip-drip!\" repeated Archie firmly. \"And I put my boots outside\nthe door when I went to bed, and this morning they hadn't been touched.\nI give you my solemn word! Not touched.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Mr. Brewster. \"My employes are honest\"\n\n\"But I wanted them cleaned, dash it!\"\n\n\"There is a shoe-shining parlour in the basement. At the Cosmopolis\nshoes left outside bedroom doors are not cleaned.\"\n\n\"Then I think the Cosmopolis is a bally rotten hotel!\"\n\nMr. Brewster's compact frame quivered. The unforgivable insult had been\noffered. Question the legitimacy of Mr. Brewster's parentage, knock Mr.\nBrewster down and walk on his face with spiked shoes, and you did not\nirremediably close all avenues to a peaceful settlement. But make a\nremark like that about his hotel, and war was definitely declared.\n\n\"In that case,\" he said, stiffening, \"I must ask you to give up your\nroom.\"\n\n\"I'm going to give it up! I wouldn't stay in the bally place another\nminute.\"\n\nMr. Brewster walked away, and Archie charged round to the cashier's\ndesk to get his bill. It had been his intention in any case, though for\ndramatic purposes he concealed it from his adversary, to leave the hotel\nthat morning. One of the letters of introduction which he had brought\nover from England had resulted in an invitation from a Mrs. van Tuyl to\nher house-party at Miami, and he had decided to go there at once.\n\n\"Well,\" mused Archie, on his way to the station, \"one thing's certain.\nI'll never set foot in THAT bally place again!\"\n\nBut nothing in this world is certain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A SHOCK FOR MR. BREWSTER\n\n\nMr. Daniel Brewster sat in his luxurious suite at the Cosmopolis,\nsmoking one of his admirable cigars and chatting with his old friend,\nProfessor Binstead. A stranger who had only encountered Mr. Brewster in\nthe lobby of the hotel would have been surprised at the appearance of\nhis sitting-room, for it had none of the rugged simplicity which was the\nkeynote of its owner's personal appearance. Daniel Brewster was a man\nwith a hobby. He was what Parker, his valet, termed a connoozer. His\neducated taste in Art was one of the things which went to make the\nCosmopolis different from and superior to other New York hotels. He had\npersonally selected the tapestries in the dining-room and the various\npaintings throughout the building. And in his private capacity he was an\nenthusiastic collector of things which Professor Binstead, whose\ntastes lay in the same direction, would have stolen without a twinge of\nconscience if he could have got the chance.\n\nThe professor, a small man of middle age who wore tortoiseshell-rimmed\nspectacles, flitted covetously about the room, inspecting its treasures\nwith a glistening eye. In a corner, Parker, a grave, lean individual,\nbent over the chafing-dish, in which he was preparing for his employer\nand his guest their simple lunch.\n\n\"Brewster,\" said Professor Binstead, pausing at the mantelpiece.\n\nMr. Brewster looked up amiably. He was in placid mood to-day. Two\nweeks and more had passed since the meeting with Archie recorded in the\nprevious chapter, and he had been able to dismiss that disturbing affair\nfrom his mind. Since then, everything had gone splendidly with Daniel\nBrewster, for he had just accomplished his ambition of the moment\nby completing the negotiations for the purchase of a site further\ndown-town, on which he proposed to erect a new hotel. He liked building\nhotels. He had the Cosmopolis, his first-born, a summer hotel in the\nmountains, purchased in the previous year, and he was toying with the\nidea of running over to England and putting up another in London, That,\nhowever, would have to wait. Meanwhile, he would concentrate on this new\none down-town. It had kept him busy and worried, arranging for securing\nthe site; but his troubles were over now.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nProfessor Binstead had picked up a small china figure of delicate\nworkmanship. It represented a warrior of pre-khaki days advancing with a\nspear upon some adversary who, judging from the contented expression on\nthe warrior's face, was smaller than himself.\n\n\"Where did you get this?\"\n\n\"That? Mawson, my agent, found it in a little shop on the east side.\"\n\n\"Where's the other? There ought to be another. These things go in pairs.\nThey're valueless alone.\"\n\nMr. Brewster's brow clouded.\n\n\"I know that,\" he said shortly. \"Mawson's looking for the other one\neverywhere. If you happen across it, I give you carte blanche to buy it\nfor me.\"\n\n\"It must be somewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes. If you find it, don't worry about the expense. I'll settle up, no\nmatter what it is.\"\n\n\"I'll bear it in mind,\" said Professor Binstead. \"It may cost you a lot\nof money. I suppose you know that.\"\n\n\"I told you I don't care what it costs.\"\n\n\"It's nice to be a millionaire,\" sighed Professor Binstead.\n\n\"Luncheon is served, sir,\" said Parker.\n\nHe had stationed himself in a statutesque pose behind Mr. Brewster's\nchair, when there was a knock at the door. He went to the door, and\nreturned with a telegram.\n\n\"Telegram for you, sir.\"\n\nMr. Brewster nodded carelessly. The contents of the chafing-dish had\njustified the advance advertising of their odour, and he was too busy to\nbe interrupted.\n\n\"Put it down. And you needn't wait, Parker.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nThe valet withdrew, and Mr. Brewster resumed his lunch.\n\n\"Aren't you going to open it?\" asked Professor Binstead, to whom a\ntelegram was a telegram.\n\n\"It can wait. I get them all day long. I expect it's from Lucille,\nsaying what train she's making.\"\n\n\"She returns to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, Been at Miami.\" Mr. Brewster, having dwelt at adequate length on\nthe contents of the chafing-dish, adjusted his glasses and took up the\nenvelope. \"I shall be glad--Great Godfrey!\"\n\nHe sat staring at the telegram, his mouth open. His friend eyed him\nsolicitously.\n\n\"No bad news, I hope?\"\n\nMr. Brewster gurgled in a strangled way.\n\n\"Bad news? Bad--? Here, read it for yourself.\"\n\nProfessor Binstead, one of the three most inquisitive men in New York,\ntook the slip of paper with gratitude.\n\n\"'Returning New York to-day with darling Archie,'\" he read. \"'Lots of\nlove from us both. Lucille.'\" He gaped at his host. \"Who is Archie?\" he\nenquired.\n\n\"Who is Archie?\" echoed Mr. Brewster helplessly. \"Who is--? That's just\nwhat I would like to know.\"\n\n\"'Darling Archie,'\" murmured the professor, musing over the telegram.\n\"'Returning to-day with darling Archie.' Strange!\"\n\nMr. Brewster continued to stare before him. When you send your only\ndaughter on a visit to Miami minus any entanglements and she mentions\nin a telegram that she has acquired a darling Archie, you are naturally\nstartled. He rose from the table with a bound. It had occurred to him\nthat by neglecting a careful study of his mail during the past week,\nas was his bad habit when busy, he had lost an opportunity of keeping\nabreast with current happenings. He recollected now that a letter had\narrived from Lucille some time ago, and that he had put it away unopened\ntill he should have leisure to read it. Lucille was a dear girl, he had\nfelt, but her letters when on a vacation seldom contained anything that\ncouldn't wait a few days for a reading. He sprang for his desk, rummaged\namong his papers, and found what he was seeking.\n\nIt was a long letter, and there was silence in the room for some\nmoments while he mastered its contents. Then he turned to the professor,\nbreathing heavily.\n\n\"Good heavens!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Professor Binstead eagerly. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded the professor in an agony.\n\nMr. Brewster sat down again with a thud.\n\n\"She's married!\"\n\n\"Married!\"\n\n\"Married! To an Englishman!\"\n\n\"Bless my soul!\"\n\n\"She says,\" proceeded Mr. Brewster, referring to the letter again, \"that\nthey were both so much in love that they simply had to slip off and get\nmarried, and she hopes I won't be cross. Cross!\" gasped Mr. Brewster,\ngazing wildly at his friend.\n\n\"Very disturbing!\"\n\n\"Disturbing! You bet it's disturbing! I don't know anything about\nthe fellow. Never heard of him in my life. She says he wanted a quiet\nwedding because he thought a fellow looked such a chump getting married!\nAnd I must love him, because he's all set to love me very much!\"\n\n\"Extraordinary!\"\n\nMr. Brewster put the letter down.\n\n\"An Englishman!\"\n\n\"I have met some very agreeable Englishmen,\" said Professor Binstead.\n\n\"I don't like Englishmen,\" growled Mr. Brewster. \"Parker's an\nEnglishman.\"\n\n\"Your valet?\"\n\n\"Yes. I believe he wears my shirts on the sly,'\" said Mr. Brewster\nbroodingly, \"If I catch him--! What would you do about this, Binstead?\"\n\n\"Do?\" The professor considered the point judiciary. \"Well, really,\nBrewster, I do not see that there is anything you can do. You must\nsimply wait and meet the man. Perhaps he will turn out an admirable\nson-in-law.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" Mr. Brewster declined to take an optimistic view. \"But an\nEnglishman, Binstead!\" he said with pathos. \"Why,\" he went on, memory\nsuddenly stirring, \"there was an Englishman at this hotel only a week or\ntwo ago who went about knocking it in a way that would have amazed you!\nSaid it was a rotten place! MY hotel!\"\n\nProfessor Binstead clicked his tongue sympathetically. He understood his\nfriend's warmth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. MR. BREWSTER DELIVERS SENTENCE\n\n\nAt about the same moment that Professor Binstead was clicking his tongue\nin Mr. Brewster's sitting-room, Archie Moffam sat contemplating his\nbride in a drawing-room on the express from Miami. He was thinking that\nthis was too good to be true. His brain had been in something of a\nwhirl these last few days, but this was one thought that never failed to\nemerge clearly from the welter.\n\nMrs. Archie Moffam, nee Lucille Brewster, was small and slender. She\nhad a little animated face, set in a cloud of dark hair. She was so\naltogether perfect that Archie had frequently found himself compelled\nto take the marriage-certificate out of his inside pocket and study it\nfurtively, to make himself realise that this miracle of good fortune had\nactually happened to him.\n\n\"Honestly, old bean--I mean, dear old thing,--I mean, darling,\" said\nArchie, \"I can't believe it!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What I mean is, I can't understand why you should have married a\nblighter like me.\"\n\nLucille's eyes opened. She squeezed his hand.\n\n\"Why, you're the most wonderful thing in the world, precious!--Surely\nyou know that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely escaped my notice. Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure! You wonder-child! Nobody could see you without\nloving you!\"\n\nArchie heaved an ecstatic sigh. Then a thought crossed his mind. It was\na thought which frequently came to mar his bliss.\n\n\"I say, I wonder if your father will think that!\"\n\n\"Of course he will!\"\n\n\"We rather sprung this, as it were, on the old lad,\" said Archie\ndubiously. \"What sort of a man IS your father?\"\n\n\"Father's a darling, too.\"\n\n\"Rummy thing he should own that hotel,\" said Archie. \"I had a frightful\nrow with a blighter of a manager there just before I left for Miami.\nYour father ought to sack that chap. He was a blot on the landscape!\"\n\nIt had been settled by Lucille during the journey that Archie should be\nbroken gently to his father-in-law. That is to say, instead of bounding\nblithely into Mr. Brewster's presence hand in hand, the happy pair\nshould separate for half an hour or so, Archie hanging around in the\noffing while Lucille saw her father and told him the whole story, or\nthose chapters of it which she had omitted from her letter for want of\nspace. Then, having impressed Mr. Brewster sufficiently with his luck in\nhaving acquired Archie for a son-in-law, she would lead him to where his\nbit of good fortune awaited him.\n\nThe programme worked out admirably in its earlier stages. When the two\nemerged from Mr. Brewster's room to meet Archie, Mr. Brewster's general\nidea was that fortune had smiled upon him in an almost unbelievable\nfashion and had presented him with a son-in-law who combined in almost\nequal parts the more admirable characteristics of Apollo, Sir Galahad,\nand Marcus Aurelius. True, he had gathered in the course of the\nconversation that dear Archie had no occupation and no private means;\nbut Mr. Brewster felt that a great-souled man like Archie didn't need\nthem. You can't have everything, and Archie, according to Lucille's\naccount, was practically a hundred per cent man in soul, looks, manners,\namiability, and breeding. These are the things that count. Mr. Brewster\nproceeded to the lobby in a glow of optimism and geniality.\n\nConsequently, when he perceived Archie, he got a bit of a shock.\n\n\"Hullo--ullo--ullo!\" said Archie, advancing happily.\n\n\"Archie, darling, this is father,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Archie.\n\nThere was one of those silences. Mr. Brewster looked at Archie. Archie\ngazed at Mr. Brewster. Lucille, perceiving without understanding why\nthat the big introduction scene had stubbed its toe on some unlooked-for\nobstacle, waited anxiously for enlightenment. Meanwhile, Archie\ncontinued to inspect Mr. Brewster, and Mr. Brewster continued to drink\nin Archie.\n\nAfter an awkward pause of about three and a quarter minutes, Mr.\nBrewster swallowed once or twice, and finally spoke.\n\n\"Lu!\"\n\n\"Yes, father?\"\n\n\"Is this true?\"\n\nLucille's grey eyes clouded over with perplexity and apprehension.\n\n\"True?\"\n\n\"Have you really inflicted this--THIS on me for a son-in-law?\" Mr.\nBrewster swallowed a few more times, Archie the while watching with\na frozen fascination the rapid shimmying of his new relative's\nAdam's-apple. \"Go away! I want to have a few words alone with\nthis--This--WASSYOURDAMNAME?\" he demanded, in an overwrought manner,\naddressing Archie for the first time.\n\n\"I told you, father. It's Moom.\"\n\n\"Moom?\"\n\n\"It's spelt M-o-f-f-a-m, but pronounced Moom.\"\n\n\"To rhyme,\" said Archie, helpfully, \"with Bluffinghame.\"\n\n\"Lu,\" said Mr. Brewster, \"run away! I want to speak to-to-to--\"\n\n\"You called me THIS before,\" said Archie.\n\n\"You aren't angry, father, dear?\" said Lucilla.\n\n\"Oh no! Oh no! I'm tickled to death!\"\n\nWhen his daughter had withdrawn, Mr. Brewster drew a long breath.\n\n\"Now then!\" he said.\n\n\"Bit embarrassing, all this, what!\" said Archie, chattily. \"I mean\nto say, having met before in less happy circs. and what not. Rum\ncoincidence and so forth! How would it be to bury the jolly old\nhatchet--start a new life--forgive and forget--learn to love each\nother--and all that sort of rot? I'm game if you are. How do we go? Is\nit a bet?\"\n\nMr. Brewster remained entirely unsoftened by this manly appeal to his\nbetter feelings.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean by marrying my daughter?\"\n\nArchie reflected.\n\n\"Well, it sort of happened, don't you know! You know how these things\nARE! Young yourself once, and all that. I was most frightfully in love,\nand Lu seemed to think it wouldn't be a bad scheme, and one thing led to\nanother, and--well, there you are, don't you know!\"\n\n\"And I suppose you think you've done pretty well for yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely! As far as I'm concerned, everything's topping! I've\nnever felt so braced in my life!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Mr. Brewster, with bitterness, \"I suppose, from your\nview-point, everything IS 'topping.' You haven't a cent to your name,\nand you've managed to fool a rich man's daughter into marrying you. I\nsuppose you looked me up in Bradstreet before committing yourself?\"\n\nThis aspect of the matter had not struck Archie until this moment.\n\n\"I say!\" he observed, with dismay. \"I never looked at it like that\nbefore! I can see that, from your point of view, this must look like a\nbit of a wash-out!\"\n\n\"How do you propose to support Lucille, anyway?\"\n\nArchie ran a finger round the inside of his collar. He felt embarrassed,\nHis father-in-law was opening up all kinds of new lines of thought.\n\n\"Well, there, old bean,\" he admitted, frankly, \"you rather have me!\"\nHe turned the matter over for a moment. \"I had a sort of idea of, as it\nwere, working, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Working at what?\"\n\n\"Now, there again you stump me somewhat! The general scheme was that I\nshould kind of look round, you know, and nose about and buzz to and fro\ntill something turned up. That was, broadly speaking, the notion!\"\n\n\"And how did you suppose my daughter was to live while you were doing\nall this?\"\n\n\"Well, I think,\" said Archie, \"I THINK we rather expected YOU to rally\nround a bit for the nonce!\"\n\n\"I see! You expected to live on me?\"\n\n\"Well, you put it a bit crudely, but--as far as I had mapped anything\nout--that WAS what you might call the general scheme of procedure. You\ndon't think much of it, what? Yes? No?\"\n\nMr. Brewster exploded.\n\n\"No! I do not think much of it! Good God! You go out of my hotel--MY\nhotel--calling it all the names you could think of--roasting it to beat\nthe band--\"\n\n\"Trifle hasty!\" murmured Archie, apologetically. \"Spoke without\nthinking. Dashed tap had gone DRIP-DRIP-DRIP all night--kept me\nawake--hadn't had breakfast--bygones be bygones--!\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt! I say, you go out of my hotel, knocking it as no one\nhas ever knocked it since it was built, and you sneak straight off and\nmarry my daughter without my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Did think of wiring for blessing. Slipped the old bean, somehow. You\nknow how one forgets things!\"\n\n\"And now you come back and calmly expect me to fling my arms round you\nand kiss you, and support you for the rest of your life!\"\n\n\"Only while I'm nosing about and buzzing to and fro.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose I've got to support you. There seems no way out of\nit. I'll tell you exactly what I propose to do. You think my hotel is\na pretty poor hotel, eh? Well, you'll have plenty of opportunity of\njudging, because you're coming to live here. I'll let you have a suite\nand I'll let you have your meals, but outside of that--nothing doing!\nNothing doing! Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! You mean, 'Napoo!'\"\n\n\"You can sign bills for a reasonable amount in my restaurant, and the\nhotel will look after your laundry. But not a cent do you get out me.\nAnd, if you want your shoes shined, you can pay for it yourself in\nthe basement. If you leave them outside your door, I'll instruct the\nfloor-waiter to throw them down the air-shaft. Do you understand? Good!\nNow, is there anything more you want to ask?\"\n\nArchie smiled a propitiatory smile.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I was going to ask if you would stagger\nalong and have a bite with us in the grill-room?\"\n\n\"I will not!\"\n\n\"I'll sign the bill,\" said Archie, ingratiatingly. \"You don't think much\nof it? Oh, right-o!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. WORK WANTED\n\n\nIt seemed to Archie, as he surveyed his position at the end of the first\nmonth of his married life, that all was for the best in the best of all\npossible worlds. In their attitude towards America, visiting Englishmen\nalmost invariably incline to extremes, either detesting all that therein\nis or else becoming enthusiasts on the subject of the country, its\nclimate, and its institutions. Archie belonged to the second class. He\nliked America and got on splendidly with Americans from the start. He\nwas a friendly soul, a mixer; and in New York, that city of mixers,\nhe found himself at home. The atmosphere of good-fellowship and the\nopen-hearted hospitality of everybody he met appealed to him. There were\nmoments when it seemed to him as though New York had simply been waiting\nfor him to arrive before giving the word to let the revels commence.\n\nNothing, of course, in this world is perfect; and, rosy as were the\nglasses through which Archie looked on his new surroundings, he had to\nadmit that there was one flaw, one fly in the ointment, one individual\ncaterpillar in the salad. Mr. Daniel Brewster, his father-in-law,\nremained consistently unfriendly. Indeed, his manner towards his new\nrelative became daily more and more a manner which would have caused\ngossip on the plantation if Simon Legree had exhibited it in his\nrelations with Uncle Tom. And this in spite of the fact that Archie, as\nearly as the third morning of his stay, had gone to him and in the\nmost frank and manly way, had withdrawn his criticism of the Hotel\nCosmopolis, giving it as his considered opinion that the Hotel\nCosmopolis on closer inspection appeared to be a good egg, one of the\nbest and brightest, and a bit of all right.\n\n\"A credit to you, old thing,\" said Archie cordially.\n\n\"Don't call me old thing!\" growled Mr. Brewster.\n\n\"Right-o, old companion!\" said Archie amiably.\n\nArchie, a true philosopher, bore this hostility with fortitude, but it\nworried Lucille.\n\n\"I do wish father understood you better,\" was her wistful comment when\nArchie had related the conversation.\n\n\"Well, you know,\" said Archie, \"I'm open for being understood any time\nhe cares to take a stab at it.\"\n\n\"You must try and make him fond of you.\"\n\n\"But how? I smile winsomely at him and what not, but he doesn't\nrespond.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall have to think of something. I want him to realise what\nan angel you are. You ARE an angel, you know.\"\n\n\"No, really?\"\n\n\"Of course you are.\"\n\n\"It's a rummy thing,\" said Archie, pursuing a train of thought which was\nconstantly with him, \"the more I see of you, the more I wonder how you\ncan have a father like--I mean to say, what I mean to say is, I wish I\nhad known your mother; she must have been frightfully attractive.\"\n\n\"What would really please him, I know,\" said Lucille, \"would be if you\ngot some work to do. He loves people who work.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Archie doubtfully. \"Well, you know, I heard him interviewing\nthat chappie behind the desk this morning, who works like the dickens\nfrom early morn to dewy eve, on the subject of a mistake in his figures;\nand, if he loved him, he dissembled it all right. Of course, I admit\nthat so far I haven't been one of the toilers, but the dashed difficult\nthing is to know how to start. I'm nosing round, but the openings for a\nbright young man seem so scarce.\"\n\n\"Well, keep on trying. I feel sure that, if you could only find\nsomething to do, it doesn't matter what, father would be quite\ndifferent.\"\n\nIt was possibly the dazzling prospect of making Mr. Brewster quite\ndifferent that stimulated Archie. He was strongly of the opinion that\nany change in his father-in-law must inevitably be for the better. A\nchance meeting with James B. Wheeler, the artist, at the Pen-and-Ink\nClub seemed to open the way.\n\nTo a visitor to New York who has the ability to make himself liked\nit almost appears as though the leading industry in that city was\nthe issuing of two-weeks' invitation-cards to clubs. Archie since\nhis arrival had been showered with these pleasant evidences of his\npopularity; and he was now an honorary member of so many clubs of\nvarious kinds that he had not time to go to them all. There were the\nfashionable clubs along Fifth Avenue to which his friend Reggie van\nTuyl, son of his Florida hostess, had introduced him. There were the\nbusinessmen's clubs of which he was made free by more solid citizens.\nAnd, best of all, there were the Lambs', the Players', the Friars', the\nCoffee-House, the Pen-and-Ink,--and the other resorts of the artist, the\nauthor, the actor, and the Bohemian. It was in these that Archie spent\nmost of his time, and it was here that he made the acquaintance of J. B.\nWheeler, the popular illustrator.\n\nTo Mr. Wheeler, over a friendly lunch, Archie had been confiding\nsome of his ambitions to qualify as the hero of one of the\nGet-on-or-get-out-young-man-step-lively-books.\n\n\"You want a job?\" said Mr. Wheeler.\n\n\"I want a job,\" said Archie.\n\nMr. Wheeler consumed eight fried potatoes in quick succession. He was an\nable trencherman.\n\n\"I always looked on you as one of our leading lilies of the field,\" he\nsaid. \"Why this anxiety to toil and spin?\"\n\n\"Well, my wife, you know, seems to think it might put me one-up with the\njolly old dad if I did something.\"\n\n\"And you're not particular what you do, so long as it has the outer\naspect of work?\"\n\n\"Anything in the world, laddie, anything in the world.\"\n\n\"Then come and pose for a picture I'm doing,\" said J. B. Wheeler. \"It's\nfor a magazine cover. You're just the model I want, and I'll pay you at\nthe usual rates. Is it a go?\"\n\n\"Pose?\"\n\n\"You've only got to stand still and look like a chunk of wood. You can\ndo that, surely?\"\n\n\"I can do that,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Then come along down to my studio to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Right-o!\" said Archie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. STRANGE EXPERIENCES OF AN ARTIST'S MODEL\n\n\n\"I say, old thing!\"\n\nArchie spoke plaintively. Already he was looking back ruefully to the\ntime when he had supposed that an artist's model had a soft job. In the\nfirst five minutes muscles which he had not been aware that he possessed\nhad started to ache like neglected teeth. His respect for the toughness\nand durability of artists' models was now solid. How they acquired the\nstamina to go through this sort of thing all day and then bound off to\nBohemian revels at night was more than he could understand.\n\n\"Don't wobble, confound you!\" snorted Mr. Wheeler.\n\n\"Yes, but, my dear old artist,\" said Archie, \"what you don't seem to\ngrasp--what you appear not to realise--is that I'm getting a crick in\nthe back.\"\n\n\"You weakling! You miserable, invertebrate worm. Move an inch and\nI'll murder you, and come and dance on your grave every Wednesday and\nSaturday. I'm just getting it.\"\n\n\"It's in the spine that it seems to catch me principally.\"\n\n\"Be a man, you faint-hearted string-bean!\" urged J. B. Wheeler. \"You\nought to be ashamed of yourself. Why, a girl who was posing for me last\nweek stood for a solid hour on one leg, holding a tennis racket over her\nhead and smiling brightly withal.\"\n\n\"The female of the species is more india-rubbery than the male,\" argued\nArchie.\n\n\"Well, I'll be through in a few minutes. Don't weaken. Think how proud\nyou'll be when you see yourself on all the bookstalls.\"\n\nArchie sighed, and braced himself to the task once more. He wished he\nhad never taken on this binge. In addition to his physical discomfort,\nhe was feeling a most awful chump. The cover on which Mr. Wheeler was\nengaged was for the August number of the magazine, and it had been\nnecessary for Archie to drape his reluctant form in a two-piece bathing\nsuit of a vivid lemon colour; for he was supposed to be representing one\nof those jolly dogs belonging to the best families who dive off floats\nat exclusive seashore resorts. J. B. Wheeler, a stickler for accuracy,\nhad wanted him to remove his socks and shoes; but there Archie had stood\nfirm. He was willing to make an ass of himself, but not a silly ass.\n\n\"All right,\" said J. B. Wheeler, laying down his brush. \"That will do\nfor to-day. Though, speaking without prejudice and with no wish to be\noffensive, if I had had a model who wasn't a weak-kneed, jelly-backboned\nson of Belial, I could have got the darned thing finished without having\nto have another sitting.\"\n\n\"I wonder why you chappies call this sort of thing 'sitting,'\" said\nArchie, pensively, as he conducted tentative experiments in osteopathy\non his aching back. \"I say, old thing, I could do with a restorative, if\nyou have one handy. But, of course, you haven't, I suppose,\" he added,\nresignedly. Abstemious as a rule, there were moments when Archie found\nthe Eighteenth Amendment somewhat trying.\n\nJ. B. Wheeler shook his head.\n\n\"You're a little previous,\" he said. \"But come round in another day or\nso, and I may be able to do something for you.\" He moved with a certain\nconspirator-like caution to a corner of the room, and, lifting to one\nside a pile of canvases, revealed a stout barrel, which, he regarded\nwith a fatherly and benignant eye. \"I don't mind telling you that, in\nthe fullness of time, I believe this is going to spread a good deal of\nsweetness and light.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah,\" said Archie, interested. \"Home-brew, what?\"\n\n\"Made with these hands. I added a few more raisins yesterday, to speed\nthings up a bit. There is much virtue in your raisin. And, talking of\nspeeding things up, for goodness' sake try to be a bit more punctual\nto-morrow. We lost an hour of good daylight to-day.\"\n\n\"I like that! I was here on the absolute minute. I had to hang about on\nthe landing waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Well, well, that doesn't matter,\" said J. B. Wheeler, impatiently, for\nthe artist soul is always annoyed by petty details. \"The point is that\nwe were an hour late in getting to work. Mind you're here to-morrow at\neleven sharp.\"\n\nIt was, therefore, with a feeling of guilt and trepidation that Archie\nmounted the stairs on the following morning; for in spite of his good\nresolutions he was half an hour behind time. He was relieved to find\nthat his friend had also lagged by the wayside. The door of the studio\nwas ajar, and he went in, to discover the place occupied by a lady of\nmature years, who was scrubbing the floor with a mop. He went into the\nbedroom and donned his bathing suit. When he emerged, ten minutes later,\nthe charwoman had gone, but J. B. Wheeler was still absent. Rather glad\nof the respite, he sat down to kill time by reading the morning paper,\nwhose sporting page alone he had managed to master at the breakfast\ntable.\n\nThere was not a great deal in the paper to interest him. The usual\nbond-robbery had taken place on the previous day, and the police were\nreported hot on the trail of the Master-Mind who was alleged to be at\nthe back of these financial operations. A messenger named Henry Babcock\nhad been arrested and was expected to become confidential. To one who,\nlike Archie, had never owned a bond, the story made little appeal. He\nturned with more interest to a cheery half-column on the activities of a\ngentleman in Minnesota who, with what seemed to Archie, as he thought\nof Mr. Daniel Brewster, a good deal of resource and public spirit, had\nrecently beaned his father-in-law with the family meat-axe. It was only\nafter he had read this through twice in a spirit of gentle approval that\nit occurred to him that J. B. Wheeler was uncommonly late at the\ntryst. He looked at his watch, and found that he had been in the studio\nthree-quarters of an hour.\n\nArchie became restless. Long-suffering old bean though he was, he\nconsidered this a bit thick. He got up and went out on to the landing,\nto see if there were any signs of the blighter. There were none. He\nbegan to understand now what had happened. For some reason or other the\nbally artist was not coming to the studio at all that day. Probably he\nhad called up the hotel and left a message to this effect, and Archie\nhad just missed it. Another man might have waited to make certain that\nhis message had reached its destination, but not woollen-headed Wheeler,\nthe most casual individual in New York.\n\nThoroughly aggrieved, Archie turned back to the studio to dress and go\naway.\n\nHis progress was stayed by a solid, forbidding slab of oak. Somehow or\nother, since he had left the room, the door had managed to get itself\nshut.\n\n\"Oh, dash it!\" said Archie.\n\nThe mildness of the expletive was proof that the full horror of the\nsituation had not immediately come home to him. His mind in the first\nfew moments was occupied with the problem of how the door had got\nthat way. He could not remember shutting it. Probably he had done it\nunconsciously. As a child, he had been taught by sedulous elders that\nthe little gentleman always closed doors behind him, and presumably his\nsubconscious self was still under the influence. And then, suddenly, he\nrealised that this infernal, officious ass of a subconscious self had\ndeposited him right in the gumbo. Behind that closed door, unattainable\nas youthful ambition, lay his gent's heather-mixture with the green\ntwill, and here he was, out in the world, alone, in a lemon-coloured\nbathing suit.\n\nIn all crises of human affairs there are two broad courses open to a\nman. He can stay where he is or he can go elsewhere. Archie, leaning on\nthe banisters, examined these alternatives narrowly. If he stayed where\nhe was he would have to spend the night on this dashed landing. If he\nlegged it, in this kit, he would be gathered up by the constabulary\nbefore he had gone a hundred yards. He was no pessimist, but he was\nreluctantly forced to the conclusion that he was up against it.\n\nIt was while he was musing with a certain tenseness on these things that\nthe sound of footsteps came to him from below. But almost in the first\ninstant the hope that this might be J. B. Wheeler, the curse of the\nhuman race, died away. Whoever was coming up the stairs was running, and\nJ. B. Wheeler never ran upstairs. He was not one of your lean, haggard,\nspiritual-looking geniuses. He made a large income with his brush and\npencil, and spent most of it in creature comforts. This couldn't be J.\nB. Wheeler.\n\nIt was not. It was a tall, thin man whom he had never seen before. He\nappeared to be in a considerable hurry. He let himself into the studio\non the floor below, and vanished without even waiting to shut the door.\n\nHe had come and disappeared in almost record time, but, brief though\nhis passing had been, it had been long enough to bring consolation to\nArchie. A sudden bright light had been vouchsafed to Archie, and he now\nsaw an admirably ripe and fruity scheme for ending his troubles. What\ncould be simpler than to toddle down one flight of stairs and in an easy\nand debonair manner ask the chappie's permission to use his telephone?\nAnd what could be simpler, once he was at the 'phone, than to get in\ntouch with somebody at the Cosmopolis who would send down a few trousers\nand what not in a kit bag. It was a priceless solution, thought Archie,\nas he made his way downstairs. Not even embarrassing, he meant to say.\nThis chappie, living in a place like this, wouldn't bat an eyelid at the\nspectacle of a fellow trickling about the place in a bathing suit. They\nwould have a good laugh about the whole thing.\n\n\"I say, I hate to bother you--dare say you're busy and all that sort of\nthing--but would you mind if I popped in for half a second and used your\n'phone?\"\n\nThat was the speech, the extremely gentlemanly and well-phrased speech,\nwhich Archie had prepared to deliver the moment the man appeared.\nThe reason he did not deliver it was that the man did not appear. He\nknocked, but nothing stirred.\n\n\"I say!\"\n\nArchie now perceived that the door was ajar, and that on an envelope\nattached with a tack to one of the panels was the name \"Elmer M. Moon\"\nHe pushed the door a little farther open and tried again.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Moon! Mr. Moon!\" He waited a moment. \"Oh, Mr. Moon! Mr. Moon!\nAre you there, Mr. Moon?\"\n\nHe blushed hotly. To his sensitive ear the words had sounded exactly\nlike the opening line of the refrain of a vaudeville song-hit. He\ndecided to waste no further speech on a man with such an unfortunate\nsurname until he could see him face to face and get a chance of lowering\nhis voice a bit. Absolutely absurd to stand outside a chappie's door\nsinging song-hits in a lemon-coloured bathing suit. He pushed the door\nopen and walked in; and his subconscious self, always the gentleman,\nclosed it gently behind him.\n\n\"Up!\" said a low, sinister, harsh, unfriendly, and unpleasant voice.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Archie, revolving sharply on his axis.\n\nHe found himself confronting the hurried gentleman who had run upstairs.\nThis sprinter had produced an automatic pistol, and was pointing it in\na truculent manner at his head. Archie stared at his host, and his host\nstared at him.\n\n\"Put your hands up,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, right-o! Absolutely!\" said Archie. \"But I mean to say--\"\n\nThe other was drinking him in with considerable astonishment. Archie's\ncostume seemed to have made a powerful impression upon him.\n\n\"Who the devil are you?\" he enquired.\n\n\"Me? Oh, my name's--\"\n\n\"Never mind your name. What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I popped in to ask if I might use your\n'phone. You see--\"\n\nA certain relief seemed to temper the austerity of the other's gaze. As\na visitor, Archie, though surprising, seemed to be better than he had\nexpected.\n\n\"I don't know what to do with you,\" he said, meditatively.\n\n\"If you'd just let me toddle to the 'phone--\"\n\n\"Likely!\" said the man. He appeared to reach a decision. \"Here, go into\nthat room.\"\n\nHe indicated with a jerk of his head the open door of what was\napparently a bedroom at the farther end of the studio.\n\n\"I take it,\" said Archie, chattily, \"that all this may seem to you not a\nlittle rummy.\"\n\n\"Get on!\"\n\n\"I was only saying--\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't time to listen. Get a move on!\"\n\nThe bedroom was in a state of untidiness which eclipsed anything which\nArchie had ever witnessed. The other appeared to be moving house. Bed,\nfurniture, and floor were covered with articles of clothing. A silk\nshirt wreathed itself about Archie's ankles as he stood gaping, and,\nas he moved farther into the room, his path was paved with ties and\ncollars.\n\n\"Sit down!\" said Elmer M. Moon, abruptly.\n\n\"Right-o! Thanks,\" said Archie, \"I suppose you wouldn't like me to\nexplain, and what not, what?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mr. Moon. \"I haven't got your spare time. Put your hands\nbehind that chair.\"\n\nArchie did so, and found them immediately secured by what felt like a\nsilk tie. His assiduous host then proceeded to fasten his ankles in a\nlike manner. This done, he seemed to feel that he had done all that\nwas required of him, and he returned to the packing of a large suitcase\nwhich stood by the window.\n\n\"I say!\" said Archie.\n\nMr. Moon, with the air of a man who has remembered something which\nhe had overlooked, shoved a sock in his guest's mouth and resumed his\npacking. He was what might be called an impressionist packer. His aim\nappeared to be speed rather than neatness. He bundled his belongings in,\nclosed the bag with some difficulty, and, stepping to the window, opened\nit. Then he climbed out on to the fire-escape, dragged the suit-case\nafter him, and was gone.\n\nArchie, left alone, addressed himself to the task of freeing his\nprisoned limbs. The job proved much easier than he had expected. Mr.\nMoon, that hustler, had wrought for the moment, not for all time. A\npractical man, he had been content to keep his visitor shackled merely\nfor such a period as would permit him to make his escape unhindered. In\nless than ten minutes Archie, after a good deal of snake-like writhing,\nwas pleased to discover that the thingummy attached to his wrists had\nloosened sufficiently to enable him to use his hands. He untied himself\nand got up.\n\nHe now began to tell himself that out of evil cometh good. His encounter\nwith the elusive Mr. Moon had not been an agreeable one, but it had\nhad this solid advantage, that it had left him right in the middle of\na great many clothes. And Mr. Moon, whatever his moral defects, had the\none excellent quality of taking about the same size as himself. Archie,\ncasting a covetous eye upon a tweed suit which lay on the bed, was on\nthe point of climbing into the trousers when on the outer door of the\nstudio there sounded a forceful knocking.\n\n\"Open up here!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE BOMB\n\n\nArchie bounded silently out into the other room and stood listening\ntensely. He was not a naturally querulous man, but he did feel at this\npoint that Fate was picking on him with a somewhat undue severity.\n\n\"In th' name av th' Law!\"\n\nThere are times when the best of us lose our heads. At this juncture\nArchie should undoubtedly have gone to the door, opened it, explained\nhis presence in a few well-chosen words, and generally have passed the\nwhole thing off with ready tact. But the thought of confronting a posse\nof police in his present costume caused him to look earnestly about him\nfor a hiding-place.\n\nUp against the farther wall was a settee with a high, arching back,\nwhich might have been put there for that special purpose. He inserted\nhimself behind this, just as a splintering crash announced that the Law,\nhaving gone through the formality of knocking with its knuckles, was now\ngetting busy with an axe. A moment later the door had given way, and the\nroom was full of trampling feet. Archie wedged himself against the wall\nwith the quiet concentration of a clam nestling in its shell, and hoped\nfor the best.\n\nIt seemed to him that his immediate future depended for better or for\nworse entirely on the native intelligence of the Force. If they were the\nbright, alert men he hoped they were, they would see all that junk in\nthe bedroom and, deducing from it that their quarry had stood not\nupon the order of his going but had hopped it, would not waste time in\nsearching a presumably empty apartment. If, on the other hand, they were\nthe obtuse, flat-footed persons who occasionally find their way into\nthe ranks of even the most enlightened constabularies, they would\nundoubtedly shift the settee and drag him into a publicity from which\nhis modest soul shrank. He was enchanted, therefore, a few moments\nlater, to hear a gruff voice state that th' mutt had beaten it down\nth' fire-escape. His opinion of the detective abilities of the New York\npolice force rose with a bound.\n\nThere followed a brief council of war, which, as it took place in the\nbedroom, was inaudible to Archie except as a distant growling noise.\nHe could distinguish no words, but, as it was succeeded by a general\ntrampling of large boots in the direction of the door and then by\nsilence, he gathered that the pack, having drawn the studio and found\nit empty, had decided to return to other and more profitable duties. He\ngave them a reasonable interval for removing themselves, and then poked\nhis head cautiously over the settee.\n\nAll was peace. The place was empty. No sound disturbed the stillness.\n\nArchie emerged. For the first time in this morning of disturbing\noccurrences he began to feel that God was in his heaven and all right\nwith the world. At last things were beginning to brighten up a bit, and\nlife might be said to have taken on some of the aspects of a good egg.\nHe stretched himself, for it is cramping work lying under settees, and,\nproceeding to the bedroom, picked up the tweed trousers again.\n\nClothes had a fascination for Archie. Another man, in similar\ncircumstances, might have hurried over his toilet; but Archie, faced by\na difficult choice of ties, rather strung the thing out. He selected a\nspecimen which did great credit to the taste of Mr. Moon, evidently\none of our snappiest dressers, found that it did not harmonise with the\ndeeper meaning of the tweed suit, removed it, chose another, and was\nadjusting the bow and admiring the effect, when his attention was\ndiverted by a slight sound which was half a cough and half a sniff; and,\nturning, found himself gazing into the clear blue eyes of a large man\nin uniform, who had stepped into the room from the fire-escape. He was\nswinging a substantial club in a negligent sort of way, and he looked at\nArchie with a total absence of bonhomie.\n\n\"Ah!\" he observed.\n\n\"Oh, THERE you are!\" said Archie, subsiding weakly against the chest\nof drawers. He gulped. \"Of course, I can see you're thinking all this\npretty tolerably weird and all that,\" he proceeded, in a propitiatory\nvoice.\n\nThe policeman attempted no analysis of his emotions, He opened a mouth\nwhich a moment before had looked incapable of being opened except with\nthe assistance of powerful machinery, and shouted a single word.\n\n\"Cassidy!\"\n\nA distant voice gave tongue in answer. It was like alligators roaring to\ntheir mates across lonely swamps.\n\nThere was a rumble of footsteps in the region of the stairs, and\npresently there entered an even larger guardian of the Law than the\nfirst exhibit. He, too, swung a massive club, and, like his colleague,\nhe gazed frostily at Archie.\n\n\"God save Ireland!\" he remarked.\n\nThe words appeared to be more in the nature of an expletive than a\npractical comment on the situation. Having uttered them, he draped\nhimself in the doorway like a colossus, and chewed gum.\n\n\"Where ja get him?\" he enquired, after a pause.\n\n\"Found him in here attimpting to disguise himself.\"\n\n\"I told Cap. he was hiding somewheres, but he would have it that he'd\nbeat it down th' escape,\" said the gum-chewer, with the sombre triumph\nof the underling whose sound advice has been overruled by those above\nhim. He shifted his wholesome (or, as some say, unwholesome) morsel to\nthe other side of his mouth, and for the first time addressed Archie\ndirectly. \"Ye're pinched!\" he observed.\n\nArchie started violently. The bleak directness of the speech roused him\nwith a jerk from the dream-like state into which he had fallen. He had\nnot anticipated this. He had assumed that there would be a period of\ntedious explanations to be gone through before he was at liberty to\ndepart to the cosy little lunch for which his interior had been sighing\nwistfully this long time past; but that he should be arrested had been\noutside his calculations. Of course, he could put everything right\neventually; he could call witnesses to his character and the purity of\nhis intentions; but in the meantime the whole dashed business would be\nin all the papers, embellished with all those unpleasant flippancies to\nwhich your newspaper reporter is so prone to stoop when he sees half a\nchance. He would feel a frightful chump. Chappies would rot him about it\nto the most fearful extent. Old Brewster's name would come into it, and\nhe could not disguise it from himself that his father-in-law, who liked\nhis name in the papers as little as possible, would be sorer than a\nsunburned neck.\n\n\"No, I say, you know! I mean, I mean to say!\"\n\n\"Pinched!\" repeated the rather larger policeman.\n\n\"And annything ye say,\" added his slightly smaller colleague, \"will be\nused agenst ya 't the trial.\"\n\n\"And if ya try t'escape,\" said the first speaker, twiddling his club,\n\"ya'll getja block knocked off.\"\n\nAnd, having sketched out this admirably clear and neatly-constructed\nscenario, the two relapsed into silence. Officer Cassidy restored his\ngum to circulation. Officer Donahue frowned sternly at his boots.\n\n\"But, I say,\" said Archie, \"it's all a mistake, you know. Absolutely a\nfrightful error, my dear old constables. I'm not the lad you're after\nat all. The chappie you want is a different sort of fellow altogether.\nAnother blighter entirely.\"\n\nNew York policemen never laugh when on duty. There is probably something\nin the regulations against it. But Officer Donahue permitted the left\ncorner of his mouth to twitch slightly, and a momentary muscular spasm\ndisturbed the calm of Officer Cassidy's granite features, as a passing\nbreeze ruffles the surface of some bottomless lake.\n\n\"That's what they all say!\" observed Officer Donahue.\n\n\"It's no use tryin' that line of talk,\" said Officer Cassidy. \"Babcock's\nsquealed.\"\n\n\"Sure. Squealed 's morning,\" said Officer Donahue.\n\nArchie's memory stirred vaguely.\n\n\"Babcock?\" he said. \"Do you know, that name seems familiar to me,\nsomehow. I'm almost sure I've read it in the paper or something.\"\n\n\"Ah, cut it out!\" said Officer Cassidy, disgustedly. The two constables\nexchanged a glance of austere disapproval. This hypocrisy pained them.\n\"Read it in th' paper or something!\"\n\n\"By Jove! I remember now. He's the chappie who was arrested in that\nbond business. For goodness' sake, my dear, merry old constables,\" said\nArchie, astounded, \"you surely aren't labouring under the impression\nthat I'm the Master-Mind they were talking about in the paper? Why, what\nan absolutely priceless notion! I mean to say, I ask you, what! Frankly,\nladdies, do I look like a Master-Mind?\"\n\nOfficer Cassidy heaved a deep sigh, which rumbled up from his interior\nlike the first muttering of a cyclone.\n\n\"If I'd known,\" he said, regretfully, \"that this guy was going to turn\nout a ruddy Englishman, I'd have taken a slap at him with m' stick and\nchanced it!\"\n\nOfficer Donahue considered the point well taken.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, understandingly. He regarded Archie with an unfriendly\neye. \"I know th' sort well! Trampling on th' face av th' poor!\"\n\n\"Ya c'n trample on the poor man's face,\" said Officer Cassidy, severely;\n\"but don't be surprised if one day he bites you in the leg!\"\n\n\"But, my dear old sir,\" protested Archie, \"I've never trampled--\"\n\n\"One of these days,\" said Officer Donahue, moodily, \"the Shannon will\nflow in blood to the sea!\"\n\n\"Absolutely! But--\"\n\nOfficer Cassidy uttered a glad cry.\n\n\"Why couldn't we hit him a lick,\" he suggested, brightly, \"an' tell th'\nCap. he resisted us in th' exercise of our jooty?\"\n\nAn instant gleam of approval and enthusiasm came into Officer Donahue's\neyes. Officer Donahue was not a man who got these luminous inspirations\nhimself, but that did not prevent him appreciating them in others and\nbestowing commendation in the right quarter. There was nothing petty or\ngrudging about Officer Donahue.\n\n\"Ye're the lad with the head, Tim!\" he exclaimed admiringly.\n\n\"It just sorta came to me,\" said Mr. Cassidy, modestly.\n\n\"It's a great idea, Timmy!\"\n\n\"Just happened to think of it,\" said Mr. Cassidy, with a coy gesture of\nself-effacement.\n\nArchie had listened to the dialogue with growing uneasiness. Not for the\nfirst time since he had made their acquaintance, he became vividly aware\nof the exceptional physical gifts of these two men. The New York police\nforce demands from those who would join its ranks an extremely high\nstandard of stature and sinew, but it was obvious that jolly old Donahue\nand Cassidy must have passed in first shot without any difficulty\nwhatever.\n\n\"I say, you know,\" he observed, apprehensively.\n\nAnd then a sharp and commanding voice spoke from the outer room.\n\n\"Donahue! Cassidy! What the devil does this mean?\"\n\nArchie had a momentary impression that an angel had fluttered down to\nhis rescue. If this was the case, the angel had assumed an effective\ndisguise--that of a police captain. The new arrival was a far smaller\nman than his subordinates--so much smaller that it did Archie good to\nlook at him. For a long time he had been wishing that it were possible\nto rest his eyes with the spectacle of something of a slightly less\nout-size nature than his two companions.\n\n\"Why have you left your posts?\"\n\nThe effect of the interruption on the Messrs. Cassidy and Donahue\nwas pleasingly instantaneous. They seemed to shrink to almost normal\nproportions, and their manner took on an attractive deference.\n\nOfficer Donahue saluted.\n\n\"If ye plaze, sorr--\"\n\nOfficer Cassidy also saluted, simultaneously.\n\n\"'Twas like this, sorr--\"\n\nThe captain froze Officer Cassidy with a glance and, leaving him\ncongealed, turned to Officer Donahue.\n\n\"Oi wuz standing on th' fire-escape, sorr,\" said Officer Donahue, in\na tone of obsequious respect which not only delighted, but astounded\nArchie, who hadn't known he could talk like that, \"accordin' to\ninstructions, when I heard a suspicious noise. I crope in, sorr, and\nfound this duck--found the accused, sorr--in front of the mirror,\nexaminin' himself. I then called to Officer Cassidy for assistance. We\npinched--arrested um, sorr.\"\n\nThe captain looked at Archie. It seemed to Archie that he looked at him\ncoldly and with contempt.\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"The Master-Mind, sorr.\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"The accused, sorr. The man that's wanted.\"\n\n\"You may want him. I don't,\" said the captain. Archie, though relieved,\nthought he might have put it more nicely. \"This isn't Moon. It's not a\nbit like him.\"\n\n\"Absolutely not!\" agreed Archie, cordially. \"It's all a mistake, old\ncompanion, as I was trying to--\"\n\n\"Cut it out!\"\n\n\"Oh, right-o!\"\n\n\"You've seen the photographs at the station. Do you mean to tell me you\nsee any resemblance?\"\n\n\"If ye plaze, sorr,\" said Officer Cassidy, coming to life.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"We thought he'd bin disguising himself, the way he wouldn't be\nrecognised.\"\n\n\"You're a fool!\" said the captain.\n\n\"Yes, sorr,\" said Officer Cassidy, meekly.\n\n\"So are you, Donahue.\"\n\n\"Yes, sorr.\"\n\nArchie's respect for this chappie was going up all the time. He seemed\nto be able to take years off the lives of these massive blighters with a\nword. It was like the stories you read about lion-tamers. Archie did\nnot despair of seeing Officer Donahue and his old college chum Cassidy\neventually jumping through hoops.\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the captain, turning to Archie.\n\n\"Well, my name is--\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Well, it's rather a longish story, you know. Don't want to bore you,\nand all that.\"\n\n\"I'm here to listen. You can't bore ME.\"\n\n\"Dashed nice of you to put it like that,\" said Archie, gratefully. \"I\nmean to say, makes it easier and so forth. What I mean is, you know how\nrotten you feel telling the deuce of a long yarn and wondering if the\nparty of the second part is wishing you would turn off the tap and go\nhome. I mean--\"\n\n\"If,\" said the captain, \"you're reciting something, stop. If you're\ntrying to tell me what you're doing here, make it shorter and easier.\"\n\nArchie saw his point. Of course, time was money--the modern spirit of\nhustle--all that sort of thing.\n\n\"Well, it was this bathing suit, you know,\" he said.\n\n\"What bathing suit?\"\n\n\"Mine, don't you know, A lemon-coloured contrivance. Rather bright and\nso forth, but in its proper place not altogether a bad egg. Well, the\nwhole thing started, you know, with my standing on a bally pedestal sort\nof arrangement in a diving attitude--for the cover, you know. I don't\nknow if you have ever done anything of that kind yourself, but it gives\nyou a most fearful crick in the spine. However, that's rather beside the\npoint, I suppose--don't know why I mentioned it. Well, this morning he\nwas dashed late, so I went out--\"\n\n\"What the devil are you talking about?\"\n\nArchie looked at him, surprised.\n\n\"Aren't I making it clear?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, you understand about the bathing suit, don't you? The jolly old\nbathing suit, you've grasped that, what?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" said Archie. \"That's rather a nuisance. I mean to say,\nthe bathing suit's what you might call the good old pivot of the whole\ndashed affair, you see. Well, you understand about the cover, what?\nYou're pretty clear on the subject of the cover?\"\n\n\"What cover?\"\n\n\"Why, for the magazine.\"\n\n\"What magazine?\"\n\n\"Now there you rather have me. One of these bright little periodicals,\nyou know, that you see popping to and fro on the bookstalls.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said the captain. He looked at\nArchie with an expression of distrust and hostility. \"And I'll tell you\nstraight out I don't like the looks of you. I believe you're a pal of\nhis.\"\n\n\"No longer,\" said Archie, firmly. \"I mean to say, a chappie who makes\nyou stand on a bally pedestal sort of arrangement and get a crick in\nthe spine, and then doesn't turn up and leaves you biffing all over the\ncountryside in a bathing suit--\"\n\nThe reintroduction of the bathing suit motive seemed to have the worst\neffect on the captain. He flushed darkly.\n\n\"Are you trying to josh me? I've a mind to soak you!\"\n\n\"If ye plaze, sorr,\" cried Officer Donahue and Officer Cassidy in\nchorus. In the course of their professional career they did not often\nhear their superior make many suggestions with which they saw eye to\neye, but he had certainly, in their opinion, spoken a mouthful now.\n\n\"No, honestly, my dear old thing, nothing was farther from my\nthoughts--\"\n\nHe would have spoken further, but at this moment the world came to\nan end. At least, that was how it sounded. Somewhere in the immediate\nneighbourhood something went off with a vast explosion, shattering the\nglass in the window, peeling the plaster from the ceiling, and sending\nhim staggering into the inhospitable arms of Officer Donahue.\n\nThe three guardians of the Law stared at one another.\n\n\"If ye plaze, sorr,\" said. Officer Cassidy, saluting.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"May I spake, sorr?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Something's exploded, sorr!\"\n\nThe information, kindly meant though it was, seemed to annoy the\ncaptain.\n\n\"What the devil did you think I thought had happened?\" he demanded, with\nnot a little irritation, \"It was a bomb!\"\n\nArchie could have corrected this diagnosis, for already a faint but\nappealing aroma of an alcoholic nature was creeping into the room\nthrough a hole in the ceiling, and there had risen before his eyes the\npicture of J. B. Wheeler affectionately regarding that barrel of his on\nthe previous morning in the studio upstairs. J. B. Wheeler had wanted\nquick results, and he had got them. Archie had long since ceased to\nregard J. B. Wheeler as anything but a tumour on the social system, but\nhe was bound to admit that he had certainly done him a good turn now.\nAlready these honest men, diverted by the superior attraction of this\nlatest happening, appeared to have forgotten his existence.\n\n\"Sorr!\" said Officer Donahue.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It came from upstairs, sorr.\"\n\n\"Of course it came from upstairs. Cassidy!\"\n\n\"Sorr?\"\n\n\"Get down into the street, call up the reserves, and stand at the front\nentrance to keep the crowd back. We'll have the whole city here in five\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Right, sorr.\"\n\n\"Don't let anyone in.\"\n\n\"No, sorr.\"\n\n\"Well, see that you don't. Come along, Donahue, now. Look slippy.\"\n\n\"On the spot, sorr!\" said Officer Donahue.\n\nA moment later Archie had the studio to himself. Two minutes later he\nwas picking his way cautiously down the fire-escape after the manner of\nthe recent Mr. Moon. Archie had not seen much of Mr. Moon, but he had\nseen enough to know that in certain crises his methods were sound and\nshould be followed. Elmer Moon was not a good man; his ethics were poor\nand his moral code shaky; but in the matter of legging it away from a\nsituation of peril and discomfort he had no superior.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. MR. ROSCOE SHERRIFF HAS AN IDEA\n\n\nArchie inserted a fresh cigarette in his long holder and began to smoke\na little moodily. It was about a week after his disturbing adventures in\nJ. B. Wheeler's studio, and life had ceased for the moment to be a thing\nof careless enjoyment. Mr. Wheeler, mourning over his lost home-brew and\nrefusing, like Niobe, to be comforted, has suspended the sittings for\nthe magazine cover, thus robbing Archie of his life-work. Mr. Brewster\nhad not been in genial mood of late. And, in addition to all this,\nLucille was away on a visit to a school-friend. And when Lucille went\naway, she took with her the sunshine. Archie was not surprised at her\nbeing popular and in demand among her friends, but that did not help him\nto become reconciled to her absence.\n\nHe gazed rather wistfully across the table at his friend, Roscoe\nSherriff, the Press-agent, another of his Pen-and-Ink Club\nacquaintances. They had just finished lunch, and during the meal\nSherriff, who, like most men of action, was fond of hearing the sound\nof his own voice and liked exercising it on the subject of himself, had\nbeen telling Archie a few anecdotes about his professional past. From\nthese the latter had conceived a picture of Roscoe Sherriff's life as a\nprismatic thing of energy and adventure and well-paid withal--just the\nsort of life, in fact, which he would have enjoyed leading himself.\nHe wished that he, too, like the Press-agent, could go about the place\n\"slipping things over\" and \"putting things across.\" Daniel Brewster, he\nfelt, would have beamed upon a son-in-law like Roscoe Sherriff.\n\n\"The more I see of America,\" sighed Archie, \"the more it amazes me. All\nyou birds seem to have been doing things from the cradle upwards. I wish\nI could do things!\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you?\"\n\nArchie flicked the ash from his cigarette into the finger-bowl.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, you know,\" he said, \"Somehow, none of our family ever\nhave. I don't know why it is, but whenever a Moffam starts out to do\nthings he infallibly makes a bloomer. There was a Moffam in the Middle\nAges who had a sudden spasm of energy and set out to make a pilgrimage\nto Jerusalem, dressed as a wandering friar. Rum ideas they had in those\ndays.\"\n\n\"Did he get there?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not! Just as he was leaving the front door his favourite\nhound mistook him for a tramp--or a varlet, or a scurvy knave, or\nwhatever they used to call them at that time--and bit him in the fleshy\npart of the leg.\"\n\n\"Well, at least he started.\"\n\n\"Enough to make a chappie start, what?\"\n\nRoscoe Sherriff sipped his coffee thoughtfully. He was an apostle of\nEnergy, and it seemed to him that he could make a convert of Archie and\nincidentally do himself a bit of good. For several days he had been,\nlooking for someone like Archie to help him in a small matter which he\nhad in mind.\n\n\"If you're really keen on doing things,\" he said, \"there's something you\ncan do for me right away.\"\n\nArchie beamed. Action was what his soul demanded.\n\n\"Anything, dear boy, anything! State your case!\"\n\n\"Would you have any objection to putting up a snake for me?\"\n\n\"Putting up a snake?\"\n\n\"Just for a day or two.\"\n\n\"But how do you mean, old soul? Put him up where?\"\n\n\"Wherever you live. Where do you live? The Cosmopolis, isn't it? Of\ncourse! You married old Brewster's daughter. I remember reading about\nit.\"\n\n\"But, I say, laddie, I don't want to spoil your day and disappoint you\nand so forth, but my jolly old father-in-law would never let me keep a\nsnake. Why, it's as much as I can do to make him let me stop on in the\nplace.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"There's not much that goes on in the hotel that he doesn't know,\" said\nArchie, doubtfully.\n\n\"He mustn't know. The whole point of the thing is that it must be a dead\nsecret.\"\n\nArchie flicked some more ash into the finger-bowl.\n\n\"I don't seem absolutely to have grasped the affair in all its aspects,\nif you know what I mean,\" he said. \"I mean to say--in the first\nplace--why would it brighten your young existence if I entertained this\nsnake of yours?\"\n\n\"It's not mine. It belongs to Mme. Brudowska. You've heard of her, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. She's some sort of performing snake female in vaudeville or\nsomething, isn't she, or something of that species or order?\"\n\n\"You're near it, but not quite right. She is the leading exponent of\nhigh-brow tragedy on any stage in the civilized world.\"\n\n\"Absolutely! I remember now. My wife lugged me to see her perform one\nnight. It all comes back to me. She had me wedged in an orchestra-stall\nbefore I knew what I was up against, and then it was too late. I\nremember reading in some journal or other that she had a pet snake,\ngiven her by some Russian prince or other, what?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Sherriff, \"was the impression I intended to convey when I\nsent the story to the papers. I'm her Press-agent. As a matter of fact,\nI bought Peter-its name's Peter-myself down on the East Side. I always\nbelieve in animals for Press-agent stunts. I've nearly always had good\nresults. But with Her Nibs I'm handicapped. Shackled, so to speak. You\nmight almost say my genius is stifled. Or strangled, if you prefer it.\"\n\n\"Anything you say,\" agreed Archie, courteously, \"But how? Why is your\nwhat-d'you-call-it what's-its-named?\"\n\n\"She keeps me on a leash. She won't let me do anything with a kick in\nit. If I've suggested one rip-snorting stunt, I've suggested twenty, and\nevery time she turns them down on the ground that that sort of thing\nis beneath the dignity of an artist in her position. It doesn't give a\nfellow a chance. So now I've made up my mind to do her good by stealth.\nI'm going to steal her snake.\"\n\n\"Steal it? Pinch it, as it were?\"\n\n\"Yes. Big story for the papers, you see. She's grown very much attached\nto Peter. He's her mascot. I believe she's practically kidded herself\ninto believing that Russian prince story. If I can sneak it away and\nkeep it away for a day or two, she'll do the rest. She'll make such a\nfuss that the papers will be full of it.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"Wow, any ordinary woman would work in with me. But not Her Nibs. She\nwould call it cheap and degrading and a lot of other things. It's got to\nbe a genuine steal, and, if I'm caught at it, I lose my job. So that's\nwhere you come in.\"\n\n\"But where am I to keep the jolly old reptile?\"\n\n\"Oh, anywhere. Punch a few holes in a hat-box, and make it up a\nshakedown inside. It'll be company for you.\"\n\n\"Something in that. My wife's away just now and it's a bit lonely in the\nevenings.\"\n\n\"You'll never be lonely with Peter around. He's a great scout. Always\nmerry and bright.\"\n\n\"He doesn't bite, I suppose, or sting or what-not?\"\n\n\"He may what-not occasionally. It depends on the weather. But, outside\nof that, he's as harmless as a canary.\"\n\n\"Dashed dangerous things, canaries,\" said Archie, thoughtfully. \"They\npeck at you.\"\n\n\"Don't weaken!\" pleaded the Press-agent\n\n\"Oh, all right. I'll take him. By the way, touching the matter of\nbrowsing and sluicing. What do I feed him on?\"\n\n\"Oh, anything. Bread-and-milk or fruit or soft-boiled egg or dog-biscuit\nor ants'-eggs. You know--anything you have yourself. Well, I'm much\nobliged for your hospitality. I'll do the same for you another time. Now\nI must be getting along to see to the practical end of the thing. By the\nway, Her Nibs lives at the Cosmopolis, too. Very convenient. Well, so\nlong. See you later.\"\n\nArchie, left alone, began for the first time to have serious doubts. He\nhad allowed himself to be swayed by Mr. Sherriff's magnetic personality,\nbut now that the other had removed himself he began to wonder if he had\nbeen entirely wise to lend his sympathy and co-operation to the scheme.\nHe had never had intimate dealings with a snake before, but he had kept\nsilkworms as a child, and there had been the deuce of a lot of fuss and\nunpleasantness over them. Getting into the salad and what-not. Something\nseemed to tell him that he was asking for trouble with a loud voice, but\nhe had given his word and he supposed he would have to go through with\nit.\n\nHe lit another cigarette and wandered out into Fifth Avenue. His usually\nsmooth brow was ruffled with care. Despite the eulogies which Sherriff\nhad uttered concerning Peter, he found his doubts increasing. Peter\nmight, as the Press-agent had stated, be a great scout, but was his\nlittle Garden of Eden on the fifth floor of the Cosmopolis Hotel likely\nto be improved by the advent of even the most amiable and winsome of\nserpents? However--\n\n\"Moffam! My dear fellow!\"\n\nThe voice, speaking suddenly in his ear from behind, roused Archie from\nhis reflections. Indeed, it roused him so effectually that he jumped a\nclear inch off the ground and bit his tongue. Revolving on his axis, he\nfound himself confronting a middle-aged man with a face like a horse.\nThe man was dressed in something of an old-world style. His clothes had\nan English cut. He had a drooping grey moustache. He also wore a grey\nbowler hat flattened at the crown--but who are we to judge him?\n\n\"Archie Moffam! I have been trying to find you all the morning.\"\n\nArchie had placed him now. He had not seen General Mannister for several\nyears--not, indeed, since the days when he used to meet him at the home\nof young Lord Seacliff, his nephew. Archie had been at Eton and Oxford\nwith Seacliff, and had often visited him in the Long Vacation.\n\n\"Halloa, General! What ho, what ho! What on earth are you doing over\nhere?\"\n\n\"Let's get out of this crush, my boy.\" General Mannister steered Archie\ninto a side-street, \"That's better.\" He cleared his throat once or\ntwice, as if embarrassed. \"I've brought Seacliff over,\" he said,\nfinally.\n\n\"Dear old Squiffy here? Oh, I say! Great work!\"\n\nGeneral Mannister did not seem to share his enthusiasm. He looked like a\nhorse with a secret sorrow. He coughed three times, like a horse who, in\naddition to a secret sorrow, had contracted asthma.\n\n\"You will find Seacliff changed,\" he said. \"Let me see, how long is it\nsince you and he met?\"\n\nArchie reflected.\n\n\"I was demobbed just about a year ago. I saw him in Paris about a year\nbefore that. The old egg got a bit of shrapnel in his foot or something,\ndidn't he? Anyhow, I remember he was sent home.\"\n\n\"His foot is perfectly well again now. But, unfortunately, the enforced\ninaction led to disastrous results. You recollect, no doubt, that\nSeacliff always had a--a tendency;--a--a weakness--it was a family\nfailing--\"\n\n\"Mopping it up, do you mean? Shifting it? Looking on the jolly old stuff\nwhen it was red and what not, what?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nArchie nodded.\n\n\"Dear old Squiffy was always rather-a lad for the wassail-bowl. When I\nmet him in Paris, I remember, he was quite tolerably blotto.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And the failing has, I regret to say, grown on him since he\nreturned from the war. My poor sister was extremely worried. In fact, to\ncut a long story short, I induced him to accompany me to America. I am\nattached to the British Legation in Washington now, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\n\"I wished Seacliff to come with me to Washington, but he insists on\nremaining in New York. He stated specifically that the thought of living\nin Washington gave him the--what was the expression he used?\"\n\n\"The pip?\"\n\n\"The pip. Precisely.\"\n\n\"But what was the idea of bringing him to America?\"\n\n\"This admirable Prohibition enactment has rendered America--to my\nmind--the ideal place for a young man of his views.\" The General looked\nat his watch. \"It is most fortunate that I happened to run into you, my\ndear fellow. My train for Washington leaves in another hour, and I have\npacking to do. I want to leave poor Seacliff in your charge while I am\ngone.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say! What!\"\n\n\"You can look after him. I am credibly informed that even now there\nare places in New York where a determined young man may obtain\nthe--er--stuff, and I should be infinitely obliged--and my poor sister\nwould be infinitely grateful--if you would keep an eye on him.\" He\nhailed a taxi-cab. \"I am sending Seacliff round to the Cosmopolis\nto-night. I am sure you, will do everything you can. Good-bye, my boy,\ngood-bye.\"\n\nArchie continued his walk. This, he felt, was beginning to be a bit\nthick. He smiled a bitter, mirthless smile as he recalled the fact that\nless than half an hour had elapsed since he had expressed a regret that\nhe did not belong to the ranks of those who do things. Fate since then\nhad certainly supplied him with jobs with a lavish hand. By bed-time he\nwould be an active accomplice to a theft, valet and companion to a snake\nhe had never met, and--as far as could gather the scope of his duties--a\ncombination of nursemaid and private detective to dear old Squiffy.\n\nIt was past four o'clock when he returned to the Cosmopolis. Roscoe\nSherriff was pacing the lobby of the hotel nervously, carrying a small\nhand-bag.\n\n\"Here you are at last! Good heavens, man, I've been waiting two hours.\"\n\n\"Sorry, old bean. I was musing a bit and lost track of the time.\"\n\nThe Press-agent looked cautiously round. There was nobody within\nearshot.\n\n\"Here he is!\" he said.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Peter.\"\n\n\"Where?\" said Archie, staring blankly.\n\n\"In this bag. Did you expect to find him strolling arm-in-arm with me\nround the lobby? Here you are! Take him!\"\n\nHe was gone. And Archie, holding the bag, made his way to the lift. The\nbag squirmed gently in his grip.\n\nThe only other occupant of the lift was a striking-looking woman of\nforeign appearance, dressed in a way that made Archie feel that she\nmust be somebody or she couldn't look like that. Her face, too, seemed\nvaguely familiar. She entered the lift at the second floor where the\ntea-room is, and she had the contented expression of one who had tea'd\nto her satisfaction. She got off at the same floor as Archie, and walked\nswiftly, in a lithe, pantherist way, round the bend in the corridor.\nArchie followed more slowly. When he reached the door of his room, the\npassage was empty. He inserted the key in his door, turned it, pushed\nthe door open, and pocketed the key. He was about to enter when the bag\nagain squirmed gently in his grip.\n\nFrom the days of Pandora, through the epoch of Bluebeard's wife, down\nto the present time, one of the chief failings of humanity has been the\ndisposition to open things that were better closed. It would have been\nsimple for Archie to have taken another step and put a door between\nhimself and the world, but there came to him the irresistible desire to\npeep into the bag now--not three seconds later, but now. All the way\nup in the lift he had been battling with the temptation, and now he\nsuccumbed.\n\nThe bag was one of those simple bags with a thingummy which you press.\nArchie pressed it. And, as it opened, out popped the head of Peter. His\neyes met Archie's. Over his head there seemed to be an invisible mark\nof interrogation. His gaze was curious, but kindly. He appeared to be\nsaying to himself, \"Have I found a friend?\"\n\nSerpents, or Snakes, says the Encyclopaedia, are reptiles of the saurian\nclass Ophidia, characterised by an elongated, cylindrical, limbless,\nscaly form, and distinguished from lizards by the fact that the halves\n(RAMI) of the lower jaw are not solidly united at the chin, but movably\nconnected by an elastic ligament. The vertebra are very numerous,\ngastrocentrous, and procoelous. And, of course, when they put it like\nthat, you can see at once that a man might spend hours with combined\nentertainment and profit just looking at a snake.\n\nArchie would no doubt have done this; but long before he had time really\nto inspect the halves (RAMI) of his new friend's lower jaw and to admire\nits elastic fittings, and long before the gastrocentrous and procoelous\ncharacter of the other's vertebrae had made any real impression on\nhim, a piercing scream almost at his elbow--startled him out of his\nscientific reverie. A door opposite had opened, and the woman of the\nelevator was standing staring at him with an expression of horror and\nfury that went through, him like a knife. It was the expression\nwhich, more than anything else, had made Mme. Brudowska what she was\nprofessionally. Combined with a deep voice and a sinuous walk, it\nenabled her to draw down a matter of a thousand dollars per week.\n\nIndeed, though the fact gave him little pleasure, Archie, as a matter of\nfact, was at this moment getting about--including war-tax--two dollars\nand seventy-five cents worth of the great emotional star for nothing.\nFor, having treated him gratis to the look of horror and fury, she now\nmoved towards him with the sinuous walk and spoke in the tone which she\nseldom permitted herself to use before the curtain of act two, unless\nthere was a whale of a situation that called for it in act one.\n\n\"Thief!\"\n\nIt was the way she said it.\n\nArchie staggered backwards as though he had been hit between the eyes,\nfell through the open door of his room, kicked it to with a flying foot,\nand collapsed on the bed. Peter, the snake, who had fallen on the floor\nwith a squashy sound, looked surprised and pained for a moment; then,\nbeing a philosopher at heart, cheered up and began hunting for flies\nunder the bureau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. A DISTURBED NIGHT FOR DEAR OLD SQUIFFY\n\n\nPeril sharpens the intellect. Archie's mind as a rule worked in rather a\nlanguid and restful sort of way, but now it got going with a rush and\na whir. He glared round the room. He had never seen a room so devoid\nof satisfactory cover. And then there came to him a scheme, a ruse. It\noffered a chance of escape. It was, indeed, a bit of all right.\n\nPeter, the snake, loafing contentedly about the carpet, found himself\nseized by what the Encyclopaedia calls the \"distensible gullet\" and\nlooked up reproachfully. The next moment he was in his bag again; and\nArchie, bounding silently into the bathroom, was tearing the cord off\nhis dressing-gown.\n\nThere came a banging at the door. A voice spoke sternly. A masculine\nvoice this time.\n\n\"Say! Open this door!\"\n\nArchie rapidly attached the dressing-gown cord to the handle of the bag,\nleaped to the window, opened it, tied the cord to a projecting piece of\niron on the sill, lowered Peter and the bag into the depths, and closed\nthe window again. The whole affair took but a few seconds. Generals have\nreceived the thanks of their nations for displaying less resource on the\nfield of battle.\n\nHe opened the-door. Outside stood the bereaved woman, and beside her a\nbullet-headed gentleman with a bowler hat on the back of his head, in\nwhom Archie recognised the hotel detective.\n\nThe hotel detective also recognised Archie, and the stern cast of his\nfeatures relaxed. He even smiled a rusty but propitiatory smile. He\nimagined--erroneously--that Archie, being the son-in-law of the owner\nof the hotel, had a pull with that gentleman; and he resolved to proceed\nwarily lest he jeopardise his job.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Moffam!\" he said, apologetically. \"I didn't know it was you I\nwas disturbing.\"\n\n\"Always glad to have a chat,\" said Archie, cordially. \"What seems to be\nthe trouble?\"\n\n\"My snake!\" cried the queen of tragedy. \"Where is my snake?\"\n\nArchie, looked at the detective. The detective looked at Archie.\n\n\"This lady,\" said the detective, with a dry little cough, \"thinks her\nsnake is in your room, Mr. Moffam.\"\n\n\"Snake?\"\n\n\"Snake's what the lady said.\"\n\n\"My snake! My Peter!\" Mme. Brudowska's voice shook with emotion. \"He is\nhere--here in this room.\"\n\nArchie shook his head.\n\n\"No snakes here! Absolutely not! I remember noticing when I came in.\"\n\n\"The snake is here--here in this room. This man had it in a bag! I saw\nhim! He is a thief!\"\n\n\"Easy, ma'am!\" protested the detective. \"Go easy! This gentleman is the\nboss's son-in-law.\"\n\n\"I care not who he is! He has my snake! Here--' here in this room!\"\n\n\"Mr. Moffam wouldn't go round stealing snakes.\"\n\n\"Rather not,\" said Archie. \"Never stole a snake in my life. None of the\nMoffams have ever gone about stealing snakes. Regular family tradition!\nThough I once had an uncle who kept gold-fish.\"\n\n\"Here he is! Here! My Peter!\"\n\nArchie looked at the detective. The detective looked at Archie. \"We must\nhumour her!\" their glances said.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Archie, \"if you'd like to search the room, what? What\nI mean to say is, this is Liberty Hall. Everybody welcome! Bring the\nkiddies!\"\n\n\"I will search the room!\" said Mme. Brudowska.\n\nThe detective glanced apologetically at Archie.\n\n\"Don't blame me for this, Mr. Moffam,\" he urged.\n\n\"Rather not! Only too glad you've dropped in!\"\n\nHe took up an easy attitude against the window, and watched the empress\nof the emotional drama explore. Presently she desisted, baffled. For an\ninstant she paused, as though about to speak, then swept from the room.\nA moment later a door banged across the passage.\n\n\"How do they get that way?\" queried the detective, \"Well, g'bye, Mr.\nMoffam. Sorry to have butted in.\"\n\nThe door closed. Archie waited a few moments, then went to the window\nand hauled in the slack. Presently the bag appeared over the edge of the\nwindow-sill.\n\n\"Good God!\" said Archie.\n\nIn the rush and swirl of recent events he must have omitted to see that\nthe clasp that fastened the bag was properly closed; for the bag, as\nit jumped on to the window-sill, gaped at him like a yawning face. And\ninside it there was nothing.\n\nArchie leaned as far out of the window as he could manage without\ncommitting suicide. Far below him, the traffic took its usual course\nand the pedestrians moved to and fro upon the pavements. There was no\ncrowding, no excitement. Yet only a few moments before a long green\nsnake with three hundred ribs, a distensible gullet, and gastrocentrous\nvertebras must have descended on that street like the gentle rain from\nHeaven upon the place beneath. And nobody seemed even interested. Not\nfor the first time since he had arrived in America, Archie marvelled\nat the cynical detachment of the New Yorker, who permits himself to be\nsurprised at nothing.\n\nHe shut the window and moved away with a heavy Heart. He had not had\nthe pleasure of an extended acquaintanceship with Peter, but he had\nseen enough of him to realise his sterling qualities. Somewhere beneath\nPeter's three hundred ribs there had lain a heart of gold, and Archie\nmourned for his loss.\n\nArchie had a dinner and theatre engagement that night, and it was late\nwhen he returned to the hotel. He found his father-in-law prowling\nrestlessly about the lobby. There seemed to be something on Mr.\nBrewster's mind. He came up to Archie with a brooding frown on his\nsquare face.\n\n\"Who's this man Seacliff?\" he demanded, without preamble. \"I hear he's a\nfriend of yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, you've met him, what?\" said Archie. \"Had a nice little chat\ntogether, yes? Talked of this and that, no!\"\n\n\"We have not said a word to each other.\"\n\n\"Really? Oh, well, dear old Squiffy is one of those strong, silent\nfellers you know. You mustn't mind if he's a bit dumb. He never says\nmuch, but it's whispered round the clubs that he thinks a lot. It was\nrumoured in the spring of nineteen-thirteen that Squiffy was on the\npoint of making a bright remark, but it never came to anything.\"\n\nMr. Brewster struggled with his feelings.\n\n\"Who is he? You seem to know him.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Great pal of mine, Squiffy. We went through Eton, Oxford, and\nthe Bankruptcy Court together. And here's a rummy coincidence. When they\nexamined ME, I had no assets. And, when they examined Squiffy, HE had no\nassets! Rather extraordinary, what?\"\n\nMr. Brewster seemed to be in no mood for discussing coincidences.\n\n\"I might have known he was a friend of yours!\" he said, bitterly. \"Well,\nif you want to see him, you'll have to do it outside my hotel.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought he was stopping here.\"\n\n\"He is--to-night. To-morrow he can look for some other hotel to break\nup.\"\n\n\"Great Scot! Has dear old Squiffy been breaking the place up?\"\n\nMr. Brewster snorted.\n\n\"I am informed that this precious friend of yours entered my grill-room\nat eight o'clock. He must have been completely intoxicated, though the\nhead waiter tells me he noticed nothing at the time.\"\n\nArchie nodded approvingly.\n\n\"Dear old Squiffy was always like that. It's a gift. However woozled he\nmight be, it was impossible to detect it with the naked eye. I've seen\nthe dear old chap many a time whiffled to the eyebrows, and looking as\nsober as a bishop. Soberer! When did it begin to dawn on the lads in the\ngrill-room that the old egg had been pushing the boat out?\"\n\n\"The head waiter,\" said Mr. Brewster, with cold fury, \"tells me that he\ngot a hint of the man's condition when he suddenly got up from his table\nand went the round of the room, pulling off all the table-cloths, and\nbreaking everything that was on them. He then threw a number of rolls at\nthe diners, and left. He seems to have gone straight to bed.\"\n\n\"Dashed sensible of him, what? Sound, practical chap, Squiffy. But where\non earth did he get the--er--materials?\"\n\n\"From his room. I made enquiries. He has six large cases in his room.\"\n\n\"Squiffy always was a chap of infinite resource! Well, I'm dashed sorry\nthis should have happened, don't you know.\"\n\n\"If it hadn't been for you, the man would never have come here.\" Mr.\nBrewster brooded coldly. \"I don't know why it is, but ever since you\ncame to this hotel I've had nothing but trouble.\"\n\n\"Dashed sorry!\" said Archie, sympathetically.\n\n\"Grrh!\" said Mr. Brewster.\n\nArchie made his way meditatively to the lift. The injustice of his\nfather-in-law's attitude pained him. It was absolutely rotten and\nall that to be blamed for everything that went wrong in the Hotel\nCosmopolis.\n\nWhile this conversation was in progress, Lord Seacliff was enjoying a\nrefreshing sleep in his room on the fourth floor. Two hours passed. The\nnoise of the traffic in the street below faded away. Only the rattle of\nan occasional belated cab broke the silence. In the hotel all was still.\nMr. Brewster had gone to bed. Archie, in his room, smoked meditatively.\nPeace may have been said to reign.\n\nAt half-past two Lord Seacliff awoke. His hours of slumber were\nalways irregular. He sat up in bed and switched the light on. He was a\nshock-headed young man with a red face and a hot brown eye. He yawned\nand stretched himself. His head was aching a little. The room seemed to\nhim a trifle close. He got out of bed and threw open the window.\nThen, returning to bed, he picked up a book and began to read. He was\nconscious of feeling a little jumpy, and reading generally sent him to\nsleep.\n\nMuch has been written on the subject of bed-books. The general consensus\nof opinion is that a gentle, slow-moving story makes the best opiate.\nIf this be so, dear old Squiffy's choice of literature had been rather\ninjudicious. His book was The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and the\nparticular story, which he selected for perusal was the one entitled,\n\"The Speckled Band.\" He was not a great reader, but, when he read, he\nliked something with a bit of zip to it.\n\nSquiffy became absorbed. He had read the story before, but a long time\nback, and its complications were fresh to him. The tale, it may be\nremembered, deals with the activities of an ingenious gentleman who kept\na snake, and used to loose it into people's bedrooms as a preliminary to\ncollecting on their insurance. It gave Squiffy pleasant thrills, for he\nhad always had a particular horror of snakes. As a child, he had shrunk\nfrom visiting the serpent house at the Zoo; and, later, when he had come\nto man's estate and had put off childish things, and settled down\nin real earnest to his self-appointed mission of drinking up all the\nalcoholic fluid in England, the distaste for Ophidia had lingered. To\na dislike for real snakes had been added a maturer shrinking from\nthose which existed only in his imagination. He could still recall his\nemotions on the occasion, scarcely three months before, when he had seen\na long, green serpent which a majority of his contemporaries had assured\nhim wasn't there.\n\nSquiffy read on:--\n\n\"Suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound,\nlike that of a small jet of steam escaping continuously from a kettle.\"\n\nLord Seacliff looked up from his book with a start Imagination was\nbeginning to play him tricks. He could have sworn that he had actually\nheard that identical sound. It had seemed to come from the window. He\nlistened again. No! All was still. He returned to his book and went on\nreading.\n\n\"It was a singular sight that met our eyes. Beside the table, on a\nwooden chair, sat Doctor Grimesby Rylott, clad in a long dressing-gown.\nHis chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid\nstare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar\nyellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\nround his head.\"\n\n\"I took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat,\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent...\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" said Squiffy.\n\nHe closed the book and put it down. His head was aching worse than ever.\nHe wished now that he had read something else. No fellow could read\nhimself to sleep with this sort of thing. People ought not to write this\nsort of thing.\n\nHis heart gave a bound. There it was again, that hissing sound. And this\ntime he was sure it came from the window.\n\nHe looked at the window, and remained staring, frozen. Over the sill,\nwith a graceful, leisurely movement, a green snake was crawling. As\nit crawled, it raised its head and peered from side to side, like a\nshortsighted man looking for his spectacles. It hesitated a moment on\nthe edge of the sill, then wriggled to the floor and began to cross the\nroom. Squiffy stared on.\n\nIt would have pained Peter deeply, for he was a snake of great\nsensibility, if he had known how much his entrance had disturbed the\noccupant of the room. He himself had no feeling but gratitude for the\nman who had opened the window and so enabled him to get in out of the\nrather nippy night air. Ever since the bag had swung open and shot him\nout onto the sill of the window below Archie's, he had been waiting\npatiently for something of the kind to happen. He was a snake who took\nthings as they came, and was prepared to rough it a bit if necessary;\nbut for the last hour or two he had been hoping that somebody would do\nsomething practical in the way of getting him in out of the cold. When\nat home, he had an eiderdown quilt to sleep on, and the stone of the\nwindow-sill was a little trying to a snake of regular habits. He crawled\nthankfully across the floor under Squiffy's bed. There was a pair of\ntrousers there, for his host had undressed when not in a frame of mind\nto fold his clothes neatly and place them upon a chair. Peter looked the\ntrousers over. They were not an eiderdown quilt, but they would serve.\nHe curled up in them and went to sleep. He had had an exciting day, and\nwas glad to turn in.\n\nAfter about ten minutes, the tension of Squiffy's attitude relaxed. His\nheart, which had seemed to suspend its operations, began beating again.\nReason reasserted itself. He peeped cautiously under the bed. He could\nsee nothing.\n\nSquiffy was convinced. He told himself that he had never really believed\nin Peter as a living thing. It stood to reason that there couldn't\nreally be a snake in his room. The window looked out on emptiness.\nHis room was several stories above the ground. There was a stern,\nset expression on Squiffy's face as he climbed out of bed. It was the\nexpression of a man who is turning over a new leaf, starting a new life.\nHe looked about the room for some implement which would carry out the\ndeed he had to do, and finally pulled out one of the curtain-rods. Using\nthis as a lever, he broke open the topmost of the six cases which stood\nin the corner. The soft wood cracked and split. Squiffy drew out a\nstraw-covered bottle. For a moment he stood looking at it, as a man\nmight gaze at a friend on the point of death. Then, with a sudden\ndetermination, he went into the bathroom. There was a crash of glass and\na gurgling sound.\n\nHalf an hour later the telephone in Archie's room rang. \"I say, Archie,\nold top,\" said the voice of Squiffy.\n\n\"Halloa, old bean! Is that you?\"\n\n\"I say, could you pop down here for a second? I'm rather upset.\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Which room?\"\n\n\"Four-forty-one.\"\n\n\"I'll be with you eftsoons or right speedily.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old man.\"\n\n\"What appears to be the difficulty?\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I thought I saw a snake!\"\n\n\"A snake!\"\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it when you come down.\"\n\nArchie found Lord Seacliff seated on his bed. An arresting aroma of\nmixed drinks pervaded the atmosphere.\n\n\"I say! What?\" said Archie, inhaling.\n\n\"That's all right. I've been pouring my stock away. Just finished the\nlast bottle.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I told you. I thought I saw a snake!\"\n\n\"Green?\"\n\nSquiffy shivered slightly.\n\n\"Frightfully green!\"\n\nArchie hesitated. He perceived that there are moments when silence is\nthe best policy. He had been worrying himself over the unfortunate case\nof his friend, and now that Fate seemed to have provided a solution,\nit would be rash to interfere merely to ease the old bean's mind. If\nSquiffy was going to reform because he thought he had seen an imaginary\nsnake, better not to let him know that the snake was a real one.\n\n\"Dashed serious!\" he said.\n\n\"Bally dashed serious!\" agreed Squiffy. \"I'm going to cut it out!\"\n\n\"Great scheme!\"\n\n\"You don't think,\" asked Squiffy, with a touch of hopefulness, \"that it\ncould have been a real snake?\"\n\n\"Never heard of the management supplying them.\"\n\n\"I thought it went under the bed.\"\n\n\"Well, take a look.\"\n\nSquiffy shuddered.\n\n\"Not me! I say, old top, you know, I simply can't sleep in this room\nnow. I was wondering if you could give me a doss somewhere in yours.\"\n\n\"Rather! I'm in five-forty-one. Just above. Trot along up. Here's the\nkey. I'll tidy up a bit here, and join you in a minute.\"\n\nSquiffy put on a dressing-gown and disappeared. Archie looked under\nthe bed. From the trousers the head of Peter popped up with its usual\nexpression of amiable enquiry. Archie nodded pleasantly, and sat down\non the bed. The problem of his little friend's immediate future wanted\nthinking over.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and remained for a while in thought. Then he rose. An\nadmirable solution had presented itself. He picked Peter up and placed\nhim in the pocket of his dressing-gown. Then, leaving the room, he\nmounted the stairs till he reached the seventh floor. Outside a room\nhalf-way down the corridor he paused.\n\nFrom within, through the open transom, came the rhythmical snoring of a\ngood man taking his rest after the labours of the day. Mr. Brewster was\nalways a heavy sleeper.\n\n\"There's always a way,\" thought Archie, philosophically, \"if a chappie\nonly thinks of it.\"\n\nHis father-in-law's snoring took on a deeper note. Archie extracted\nPeter from his pocket and dropped him gently through the transom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. A LETTER FROM PARKER\n\n\nAs the days went by and he settled down at the Hotel Cosmopolis, Archie,\nlooking about him and revising earlier judgments, was inclined to think\nthat of all his immediate circle he most admired Parker, the lean, grave\nvalet of Mr. Daniel Brewster. Here was a man who, living in the closest\ncontact with one of the most difficult persons in New York, contrived\nall the while to maintain an unbowed head, and, as far as one could\ngather from appearances, a tolerably cheerful disposition. A great man,\njudge him by what standard you pleased. Anxious as he was to earn an\nhonest living, Archie would not have changed places with Parker for the\nsalary of a movie-star.\n\nIt was Parker who first directed Archie's attention to the hidden merits\nof Pongo. Archie had drifted into his father-in-law's suite one morning,\nas he sometimes did in the effort to establish more amicable relations,\nand had found it occupied only by the valet, who was dusting the\nfurniture and bric-a-brac with a feather broom rather in the style of a\nman-servant at the rise of the curtain of an old-fashioned farce. After\na courteous exchange of greetings, Archie sat down and lit a cigarette.\nParker went on dusting.\n\n\"The guv'nor,\" said Parker, breaking the silence, \"has some nice little\nobjay dar, sir.\"\n\n\"Little what?\"\n\n\"Objay dar, sir.\"\n\nLight dawned upon Archie.\n\n\"Of course, yes. French for junk. I see what you mean now. Dare say\nyou're right, old friend. Don't know much about these things myself.\"\n\nParker gave an appreciative flick at a vase on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Very valuable, some of the guv'nor's things.\" He had picked up the\nsmall china figure of the warrior with the spear, and was grooming it\nwith the ostentatious care of one brushing flies off a sleeping Venus.\nHe regarded this figure with a look of affectionate esteem which\nseemed to Archie absolutely uncalled-for. Archie's taste in Art was not\nprecious. To his untutored eye the thing was only one degree less foul\nthan his father-in-law's Japanese prints, which he had always observed\nwith silent loathing. \"This one, now,\" continued Parker. \"Worth a lot of\nmoney. Oh, a lot of money.\"\n\n\"What, Pongo?\" said Archie incredulously.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I always call that rummy-looking what-not Pongo. Don't know what else\nyou could call him, what!\"\n\nThe valet seemed to disapprove of this levity. He shook his head and\nreplaced the figure on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Worth a lot of money,\" he repeated. \"Not by itself, no.\"\n\n\"Oh, not by itself?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Things like this come in pairs. Somewhere or other there's the\ncompanion-piece to this here, and if the guv'nor could get hold of it,\nhe'd have something worth having. Something that connoozers would give a\nlot of money for. But one's no good without the other. You have to have\nboth, if you understand my meaning, sir.\"\n\n\"I see. Like filling a straight flush, what?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\nArchie gazed at Pongo again, with the dim hope of discovering virtues\nnot immediately apparent to the casual observer. But without success.\nPongo left him cold--even chilly. He would not have taken Pongo as a\ngift, to oblige a dying friend.\n\n\"How much would the pair be worth?\" he asked. \"Ten dollars?\"\n\nParker smiled a gravely superior smile. \"A leetle more than that, sir.\nSeveral thousand dollars, more like it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" said Archie, with honest amazement, \"that there\nare chumps going about loose--absolutely loose--who would pay that for a\nweird little object like Pongo?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, sir. These antique china figures are in great demand among\ncollectors.\"\n\nArchie looked at Pongo once more, and shook his head.\n\n\"Well, well, well! It takes all sorts to make a world, what!\"\n\nWhat might be called the revival of Pongo, the restoration of Pongo to\nthe ranks of the things that matter, took place several weeks later,\nwhen Archie was making holiday at the house which his father-in-law had\ntaken for the summer at Brookport. The curtain of the second act may be\nsaid to rise on Archie strolling back from the golf-links in the cool of\nan August evening. From time to time he sang slightly, and wondered\nidly if Lucille would put the finishing touch upon the all-rightness of\neverything by coming to meet him and sharing his homeward walk.\n\nShe came in view at this moment, a trim little figure in a white skirt\nand a pale blue sweater. She waved to Archie; and Archie, as always\nat the sight of her, was conscious of that jumpy, fluttering sensation\nabout the heart, which, translated into words, would have formed the\nquestion, \"What on earth could have made a girl like that fall in love\nwith a chump like me?\" It was a question which he was continually asking\nhimself, and one which was perpetually in the mind also of Mr. Brewster,\nhis father-in-law. The matter of Archie's unworthiness to be the husband\nof Lucille was practically the only one on which the two men saw eye to\neye.\n\n\"Hallo--allo--allo!\" said Archie. \"Here we are, what! I was just hoping\nyou would drift over the horizon.\"\n\nLucille kissed him.\n\n\"You're a darling,\" she said. \"And you look like a Greek god in that\nsuit.\"\n\n\"Glad you like it.\" Archie squinted with some complacency down his\nchest. \"I always say it doesn't matter what you pay for a suit, so long\nas it's right. I hope your jolly old father will feel that way when he\nsettles up for it.\"\n\n\"Where is father? Why didn't he come back with you?\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, he didn't seem any too keen on my company.\nI left him in the locker-room chewing a cigar. Gave me the impression of\nhaving something on his mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, Archie! You didn't beat him AGAIN?\"\n\nArchie looked uncomfortable. He gazed out to sea with something of\nembarrassment.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, old thing, to be absolutely frank, I, as it\nwere, did!\"\n\n\"Not badly?\"\n\n\"Well, yes! I rather fancy I put it across him with some vim and not\na little emphasis. To be perfectly accurate, I licked him by ten and\neight.\"\n\n\"But you promised me you would let him beat you to-day. You know how\npleased it would have made him.\"\n\n\"I know. But, light of my soul, have you any idea how dashed difficult\nit is to get beaten by your festive parent at golf?\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" Lucille sighed. \"It can't be helped, I suppose.\" She felt in\nthe pocket of her sweater. \"Oh, there's a letter for you. I've just\nbeen to fetch the mail. I don't know who it can be from. The handwriting\nlooks like a vampire's. Kind of scrawly.\"\n\nArchie inspected the envelope. It provided no solution.\n\n\"That's rummy! Who could be writing to me?\"\n\n\"Open it and see.\"\n\n\"Dashed bright scheme! I will, Herbert Parker. Who the deuce is Herbert\nParker?\"\n\n\"Parker? Father's valet's name was Parker. The one he dismissed when he\nfound he was wearing his shirts.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say any reasonable chappie would willingly wear the\nsort of shirts your father--? I mean to say, there must have been some\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Do read the letter. I expect he wants to use your influence with father\nto have him taken back.\"\n\n\"MY influence? With your FATHER? Well, I'm dashed. Sanguine sort of\nJohnny, if he does. Well, here's what he says. Of course, I remember\njolly old Parker now--great pal of mine.\"\n\n     Dear Sir,--It is some time since the undersigned had the\n     honour of conversing with you, but I am respectfully trusting\n     that you may recall me to mind when I mention that until\n     recently I served Mr. Brewster, your father-in-law, in the\n     capacity of valet. Owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding,\n     I was dismissed from that position and am now temporarily out\n     of a job. \"How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of\n     the morning?\" (Isaiah xiv. 12.)\n\n\"You know,\" said Archie, admiringly, \"this bird is hot stuff! I mean to\nsay he writes dashed well.\"\n\n     It is not, however, with my own affairs that I desire to\n     trouble you, dear sir. I have little doubt that all will be\n     well with me and that I shall not fall like a sparrow to the\n     ground. \"I have been young and now am old; yet have I not\n     seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread\"\n     (Psalms xxxvii. 25). My object in writing to you is as\n     follows. You may recall that I had the pleasure of meeting\n     you one morning in Mr. Brewster's suite, when we had an\n     interesting talk on the subject of Mr. B.'s objets d'art.\n     You may recall being particularly interested in a small\n     china figure. To assist your memory, the figure to which I\n     allude is the one which you whimsically referred to as Pongo.\n     I informed you, if you remember, that, could the accompanying\n     figure be secured, the pair would be extremely valuable.\n\n     I am glad to say, dear sir, that this has now transpired, and\n     is on view at Beale's Art Galleries on West Forty-Fifty Street,\n     where it will be sold to-morrow at auction, the sale commencing\n     at two-thirty sharp. If Mr. Brewster cares to attend, he will,\n     I fancy, have little trouble in securing it at a reasonable price.\n     I confess that I had thought of refraining from apprising my late\n     employer of this matter, but more Christian feelings have\n     prevailed. \"If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give\n     him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his\n     head\" (Romans xii. 20). Nor, I must confess, am I altogether\n     uninfluenced by the thought that my action in this matter may\n     conceivably lead to Mr. B. consenting to forget the past and to\n     reinstate me in my former position. However, I am confident that\n     I can leave this to his good feeling.\n\n                             I remain, respectfully yours,\n                             Herbert Parker.\n\nLucille clapped her hands.\n\n\"How splendid! Father will be pleased!\"\n\n\"Yes. Friend Parker has certainly found a way to make the old dad fond\nof him. Wish I could!\"\n\n\"But you can, silly! He'll be delighted when you show him that letter.\"\n\n\"Yes, with Parker. Old Herb. Parker's is the neck he'll fall on--not\nmine.\"\n\nLucille reflected.\n\n\"I wish--\" she began. She stopped. Her eyes lit up. \"Oh, Archie,\ndarling, I've got an idea!\"\n\n\"Decant it.\"\n\n\"Why don't you slip up to New York to-morrow and buy the thing, and give\nit to father as a surprise?\"\n\nArchie patted her hand kindly. He hated to spoil her girlish day-dreams.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"But reflect, queen of my heart! I have at the moment of\ngoing to press just two dollars fifty in specie, which I took off your\nfather this after-noon. We were playing twenty-five cents a Hole.\nHe coughed it up without enthusiasm--in fact, with a nasty hacking\nsound--but I've got it. But that's all I have got.\"\n\n\"That's all right. You can pawn that ring and that bracelet of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, what! Pop the family jewels?\"\n\n\"Only for a day or two. Of course, once you've got the thing, father\nwill pay us back. He would give you all the money we asked him for, if\nhe knew what it was for. But I want to surprise him. And if you were to\ngo to him and ask him for a thousand dollars without telling him what it\nwas for, he might refuse.\"\n\n\"He might!\" said Archie. \"He might!\"\n\n\"It all works out splendidly. To-morrow's the Invitation Handicap, and\nfather's been looking forward to it for weeks. He'd hate to have to go\nup to town himself and not play in it. But you can slip up and slip back\nwithout his knowing anything about it.\"\n\nArchie pondered.\n\n\"It sounds a ripe scheme. Yes, it has all the ear-marks of a somewhat\nfruity wheeze! By Jove, it IS a fruity wheeze! It's an egg!\"\n\n\"An egg?\"\n\n\"Good egg, you know. Halloa, here's a postscript. I didn't see it.\"\n\n     P.S.--I should be glad if you would convey my most\n     cordial respects to Mrs. Moffam. Will you also inform\n     her that I chanced to meet Mr. William this morning on\n     Broadway, just off the boat. He desired me to send his\n     regards and to say that he would be joining you at\n     Brookport in the course of a day or so. Mr. B. will be\n     pleased to have him back. \"A wise son maketh a glad\n     father\" (Proverbs x. 1).\n\n\"Who's Mr. William?\" asked Archie.\n\n\"My brother Bill, of course. I've told you all about him.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course. Your brother Bill. Rummy to think I've got a\nbrother-in-law I've never seen.\"\n\n\"You see, we married so suddenly. When we married, Bill was in Yale.\"\n\n\"Good God! What for?\"\n\n\"Not jail, silly. Yale. The university.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes.\"\n\n\"Then he went over to Europe for a trip to broaden his mind. You must\nlook him up to-morrow when you get back to New York. He's sure to be at\nhis club.\"\n\n\"I'll make a point of it. Well, vote of thanks to good old Parker! This\nreally does begin to look like the point in my career where I start to\nhave your forbidding old parent eating out of my hand.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's an egg, isn't it!\"\n\n\"Queen of my soul,\" said Archie enthusiastically, \"it's an omelette!\"\n\nThe business negotiations in connection with the bracelet and the ring\noccupied Archie on his arrival in New York to an extent which made it\nimpossible for him to call on Brother Bill before lunch. He decided to\npostpone the affecting meeting of brothers-in-law to a more convenient\nseason, and made his way to his favourite table at the Cosmopolis\ngrill-room for a bite of lunch preliminary to the fatigues of the sale.\nHe found Salvatore hovering about as usual, and instructed him to come\nto the rescue with a minute steak.\n\nSalvatore was the dark, sinister-looking waiter who attended, among\nother tables, to the one at the far end of the grill-room at which\nArchie usually sat. For several weeks Archie's conversations with the\nother had dealt exclusively with the bill of fare and its contents; but\ngradually he had found himself becoming more personal. Even before the\nwar and its democratising influences, Archie had always lacked that\nreserve which characterises many Britons; and since the war he had\nlooked on nearly everyone he met as a brother. Long since, through the\nmedium of a series of friendly chats, he had heard all about Salvatore's\nhome in Italy, the little newspaper and tobacco shop which his mother\nowned down on Seventh Avenue, and a hundred other personal details.\nArchie had an insatiable curiosity about his fellow-man.\n\n\"Well done,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Sare?\"\n\n\"The steak. Not too rare, you know.\"\n\n\"Very good, sare.\"\n\nArchie looked at the waiter closely. His tone had been subdued and sad.\nOf course, you don't expect a waiter to beam all over his face and give\nthree rousing cheers simply because you have asked him to bring you a\nminute steak, but still there was something about Salvatore's manner\nthat disturbed Archie. The man appeared to have the pip. Whether he was\nmerely homesick and brooding on the lost delights of his sunny\nnative land, or whether his trouble was more definite, could only be\nascertained by enquiry. So Archie enquired.\n\n\"What's the matter, laddie?\" he said sympathetically. \"Something on your\nmind?\"\n\n\"Sare?\"\n\n\"I say, there seems to be something on your mind. What's the trouble?\"\n\nThe waiter shrugged his shoulders, as if indicating an unwillingness to\ninflict his grievances on one of the tipping classes.\n\n\"Come on!\" persisted Archie encouragingly. \"All pals here. Barge along,\nold thing, and let's have it.\"\n\nSalvatore, thus admonished, proceeded in a hurried undertone--with one\neye on the headwaiter--to lay bare his soul. What he said was not very\ncoherent, but Archie could make out enough of it to gather that it was a\nsad story of excessive hours and insufficient pay. He mused awhile. The\nwaiter's hard case touched him.\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" he said at last. \"When jolly old Brewster conies\nback to town--he's away just now--I'll take you along to him and we'll\nbeard the old boy in his den. I'll introduce you, and you get that\nextract from Italian opera-off your chest which you've just been singing\nto me, and you'll find it'll be all right. He isn't what you might call\none of my greatest admirers, but everybody says he's a square sort of\ncove and he'll see you aren't snootered. And now, laddie, touching the\nmatter of that steak.\"\n\nThe waiter disappeared, greatly cheered, and Archie, turning, perceived\nthat his friend Reggie van Tuyl was entering the room. He waved to him\nto join his table. He liked Reggie, and it also occurred to him that a\nman of the world like the heir of the van Tuyls, who had been popping\nabout New York for years, might be able to give him some much-needed\ninformation on the procedure at an auction sale, a matter on which he\nhimself was profoundly ignorant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. DOING FATHER A BIT OF GOOD\n\n\nReggie Van Tuyl approached the table languidly, and sank down into a\nchair. He was a long youth with a rather subdued and deflated look,\nas though the burden of the van Tuyl millions was more than his frail\nstrength could support. Most things tired him.\n\n\"I say, Reggie, old top,\" said Archie, \"you're just the lad I wanted to\nsee. I require the assistance of a blighter of ripe intellect. Tell me,\nladdie, do you know anything about sales?\"\n\nReggie eyed him sleepily.\n\n\"Sales?\"\n\n\"Auction sales.\"\n\nReggie considered.\n\n\"Well, they're sales, you know.\" He checked a yawn. \"Auction sales, you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Archie encouragingly. \"Something--the name or\nsomething--seemed to tell me that.\"\n\n\"Fellows put things up for sale you know, and other fellows--other\nfellows go in and--and buy 'em, if you follow me.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what's the procedure? I mean, what do I do? That's what I'm\nafter. I've got to buy something at Beale's this afternoon. How do I set\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Reggie, drowsily, \"there are several ways of bidding, you\nknow. You can shout, or you can nod, or you can twiddle your fingers--\"\nThe effort of concentration was too much for him. He leaned back limply\nin his chair. \"I'll tell you what. I've nothing to do this afternoon.\nI'll come with you and show you.\"\n\nWhen he entered the Art Galleries a few minutes later, Archie was glad\nof the moral support of even such a wobbly reed as Reggie van Tuyl.\nThere is something about an auction room which weighs heavily upon the\nnovice. The hushed interior was bathed in a dim, religious light; and\nthe congregation, seated on small wooden chairs, gazed in reverent\nsilence at the pulpit, where a gentleman of commanding presence and\nsparkling pince-nez was delivering a species of chant. Behind a gold\ncurtain at the end of the room mysterious forms flitted to and fro.\nArchie, who had been expecting something on the lines of the New York\nStock Exchange, which he had once been privileged to visit when it was\nin a more than usually feverish mood, found the atmosphere oppressively\necclesiastical. He sat down and looked about him. The presiding priest\nwent on with his chant.\n\n\"Sixteen-sixteen-sixteen-sixteen-sixteen--worth three\nhundred--sixteen-sixteen-sixteen-sixteen-sixteen--ought to bring five\nhundred--sixteen-sixteen-seventeen-seventeen-eighteen-eighteen\nnineteen-nineteen-nineteen.\"\n\nHe stopped and eyed the worshippers with a glittering and reproachful\neye. They had, it seemed, disappointed him. His lips curled, and he\nwaved a hand towards a grimly uncomfortable-looking chair with insecure\nlegs and a good deal of gold paint about it. \"Gentlemen! Ladies and\ngentlemen! You are not here to waste my time; I am not here to\nwaste yours. Am I seriously offered nineteen dollars for this\neighteenth-century chair, acknowledged to be the finest piece sold\nin New York for months and months? Am I--twenty? I thank you.\nTwenty-twenty-twenty-twenty. YOUR opportunity! Priceless. Very few\nextant. Twenty-five-five-five-five-thirty-thirty. Just what\nyou are looking for. The only one in the City of New York.\nThirty-five-five-five-five. Forty-forty-forty-forty-forty. Look at those\nlegs! Back it into the light, Willie. Let the light fall on those legs!\"\n\nWillie, a sort of acolyte, manoeuvred the chair as directed. Reggie van\nTuyl, who had been yawning in a hopeless sort of way, showed his first\nflicker of interest.\n\n\"Willie,\" he observed, eyeing that youth more with pity than reproach,\n\"has a face like Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy, don't you think so?\"\n\nArchie nodded briefly. Precisely the same criticism had occurred to him.\n\n\"Forty-five-five-five-five-five,\" chanted the high-priest. \"Once\nforty-five. Twice forty-five. Third and last call, forty-five. Sold at\nforty-five. Gentleman in the fifth row.\"\n\nArchie looked up and down the row with a keen eye. He was anxious to\nsee who had been chump enough to give forty-five dollars for such\na frightful object. He became aware of the dog-faced Willie leaning\ntowards him.\n\n\"Name, please?\" said the canine one.\n\n\"Eh, what?\" said Archie. \"Oh, my name's Moffam, don't you know.\" The\neyes of the multitude made him feel a little nervous \"Er--glad to meet\nyou and all that sort of rot.\"\n\n\"Ten dollars deposit, please,\" said Willie.\n\n\"I don't absolutely follow you, old bean. What is the big thought at the\nback of all this?\"\n\n\"Ten dollars deposit on the chair.\"\n\n\"What chair?\"\n\n\"You bid forty-five dollars for the chair.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"You nodded,\" said Willie, accusingly. \"If,\" he went on, reasoning\nclosely, \"you didn't want to bid, why did you nod?\"\n\nArchie was embarrassed. He could, of course, have pointed out that he\nhad merely nodded in adhesion to the statement that the other had a face\nlike Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy; but something seemed to tell him that\na purist might consider the excuse deficient in tact. He hesitated\na moment, then handed over a ten-dollar bill, the price of Willie's\nfeelings. Willie withdrew like a tiger slinking from the body of its\nvictim.\n\n\"I say, old thing,\" said Archie to Reggie, \"this is a bit thick, you\nknow. No purse will stand this drain.\"\n\nReggie considered the matter. His face seemed drawn under the mental\nstrain.\n\n\"Don't nod again,\" he advised. \"If you aren't careful, you get into\nthe habit of it. When you want to bid, just twiddle your fingers. Yes,\nthat's the thing. Twiddle!\"\n\nHe sighed drowsily. The atmosphere of the auction room was close; you\nweren't allowed to smoke; and altogether he was beginning to regret that\nhe had come. The service continued. Objects of varying unattractiveness\ncame and went, eulogised by the officiating priest, but coldly received\nby the congregation. Relations between the former and the latter were\ngrowing more and more distant. The congregation seemed to suspect the\npriest of having an ulterior motive in his eulogies, and the priest\nseemed to suspect the congregation of a frivolous desire to waste his\ntime. He had begun to speculate openly as to why they were there at all.\nOnce, when a particularly repellent statuette of a nude female with an\nunwholesome green skin had been offered at two dollars and had found no\nbidders--the congregation appearing silently grateful for his statement\nthat it was the only specimen of its kind on the continent--he had\nspecifically accused them of having come into the auction room merely\nwith the purpose of sitting down and taking the weight off their feet.\n\n\"If your thing--your whatever-it-is, doesn't come up soon, Archie,\" said\nReggie, fighting off with an effort the mists of sleep, \"I rather think\nI shall be toddling along. What was it you came to get?\"\n\n\"It's rather difficult to describe. It's a rummy-looking sort of\nwhat-not, made of china or something. I call it Pongo. At least, this\none isn't Pongo, don't you know--it's his little brother, but presumably\nequally foul in every respect. It's all rather complicated, I know,\nbut--hallo!\" He pointed excitedly. \"By Jove! We're off! There it is!\nLook! Willie's unleashing it now!\"\n\nWillie, who had disappeared through the gold curtain, had now returned,\nand was placing on a pedestal a small china figure of delicate\nworkmanship. It was the figure of a warrior in a suit of armour\nadvancing with raised spear upon an adversary. A thrill permeated\nArchie's frame. Parker had not been mistaken. This was undoubtedly the\ncompanion-figure to the redoubtable Pongo. The two were identical. Even\nfrom where he sat Archie could detect on the features of the figure on\nthe pedestal the same expression of insufferable complacency which had\nalienated his sympathies from the original Pongo.\n\nThe high-priest, undaunted by previous rebuffs, regarded the figure\nwith a gloating enthusiasm wholly unshared by the congregation, who were\nplainly looking upon Pongo's little brother as just another of those\nthings.\n\n\"This,\" he said, with a shake in his voice, \"is something very special.\nChina figure, said to date back to the Ming Dynasty. Unique. Nothing\nlike it on either side of the Atlantic. If I were selling this at\nChristie's in London, where people,\" he said, nastily, \"have an educated\nappreciation of the beautiful, the rare, and the exquisite, I should\nstart the bidding at a thousand dollars. This afternoon's experience has\ntaught me that that might possibly be too high.\" His pince-nez sparkled\nmilitantly, as he gazed upon the stolid throng. \"Will anyone offer me a\ndollar for this unique figure?\"\n\n\"Leap at it, old top,\" said Reggie van Tuyl. \"Twiddle, dear boy,\ntwiddle! A dollar's reasonable.\"\n\nArchie twiddled.\n\n\"One dollar I am offered,\" said the high-priest, bitterly. \"One\ngentleman here is not afraid to take a chance. One gentleman here knows\na good thing when he sees one.\" He abandoned the gently sarcastic manner\nfor one of crisp and direct reproach. \"Come, come, gentlemen, we are not\nhere to waste time. Will anyone offer me one hundred dollars for\nthis superb piece of--\" He broke off, and seemed for a moment almost\nunnerved. He stared at someone in one of the seats in front of Archie.\n\"Thank you,\" he said, with a sort of gulp. \"One hundred dollars I am\noffered! One hundred--one hundred--one hundred--\"\n\nArchie was startled. This sudden, tremendous jump, this wholly\nunforeseen boom in Pongos, if one might so describe it, was more than\na little disturbing. He could not see who his rival was, but it was\nevident that at least one among those present did not intend to allow\nPongo's brother to slip by without a fight. He looked helplessly at\nReggie for counsel, but Reggie had now definitely given up the struggle.\nExhausted nature had done its utmost, and now he was leaning back\nwith closed eyes, breathing softly through his nose. Thrown on his own\nresources, Archie could think of no better course than to twiddle his\nfingers again. He did so, and the high-priest's chant took on a note of\npositive exuberance.\n\n\"Two hundred I am offered. Much better! Turn the pedestal round,\nWillie, and let them look at it. Slowly! Slowly! You aren't spinning a\nroulette-wheel. Two hundred. Two-two-two-two-two.\" He became suddenly\nlyrical. \"Two-two-two--There was a young lady named Lou, who was\ncatching a train at two-two. Said the porter, 'Don't worry or hurry or\nscurry. It's a minute or two to two-two!' Two-two-two-two-two!\"\n\nArchie's concern increased. He seemed to be twiddling at this voluble\nman across seas of misunderstanding. Nothing is harder to interpret to a\nnicety than a twiddle, and Archie's idea of the language of twiddles\nand the high-priest's idea did not coincide by a mile. The high-priest\nappeared to consider that, when Archie twiddled, it was his intention\nto bid in hundreds, whereas in fact Archie had meant to signify that he\nraised the previous bid by just one dollar. Archie felt that, if given\ntime, he could make this clear to the high-priest, but the latter gave\nhim no time. He had got his audience, so to speak, on the run, and he\nproposed to hustle them before they could rally.\n\n\"Two hundred--two hundred--two--three--thank you,\nsir--three-three-three-four-four-five-five-six-six-seven-seven-seven--\"\n\nArchie sat limply in his wooden chair. He was conscious of a feeling\nwhich he had only experienced twice in his life--once when he had taken\nhis first lesson in driving a motor and had trodden on the accelerator\ninstead of the brake; the second time more recently, when he had made\nhis first down-trip on an express lift. He had now precisely the same\nsensation of being run away with by an uncontrollable machine, and of\nhaving left most of his internal organs at some little distance from the\nrest of his body. Emerging from this welter of emotion, stood out the\none clear fact that, be the opposition bidding what it might, he\nmust nevertheless secure the prize. Lucille had sent him to New York\nexpressly to do so. She had sacrificed her jewellery for the cause. She\nrelied on him. The enterprise had become for Archie something almost\nsacred. He felt dimly like a knight of old hot on the track of the Holy\nGrail.\n\nHe twiddled again. The ring and the bracelet had fetched nearly twelve\nhundred dollars. Up to that figure his hat was in the ring.\n\n\"Eight hundred I am offered. Eight hundred. Eight-eight-eight-eight--\"\n\nA voice spoke from somewhere at the back of the room. A quiet, cold,\nnasty, determined voice.\n\n\"Nine!\"\n\nArchie rose from his seat and spun round. This mean attack from the rear\nstung his fighting spirit. As he rose, a young man sitting immediately\nin front of him rose too and stared likewise. He was a square-built\nresolute-looking young man, who reminded Archie vaguely of somebody he\nhad seen before. But Archie was too busy trying to locate the man at the\nback to pay much attention to him. He detected him at last, owing to the\nfact that the eyes of everybody in that part of the room were fixed\nupon him. He was a small man of middle age, with tortoise-shell-rimmed\nspectacles. He might have been a professor or something of the kind.\nWhatever he was, he was obviously a man to be reckoned with. He had a\nrich sort of look, and his demeanour was the demeanour of a man who is\nprepared to fight it out on these lines if it takes all the summer.\n\n\"Nine hundred I am offered. Nine-nine-nine-nine--\"\n\nArchie glared defiantly at the spectacled man.\n\n\"A thousand!\" he cried.\n\nThe irruption of high finance into the placid course of the afternoon's\nproceedings had stirred the congregation out of its lethargy. There\nwere excited murmurs. Necks were craned, feet shuffled. As for the\nhigh-priest, his cheerfulness was now more than restored, and his faith\nin his fellow-man had soared from the depths to a very lofty altitude.\nHe beamed with approval. Despite the warmth of his praise he would have\nbeen quite satisfied to see Pongo's little brother go at twenty dollars,\nand the reflection that the bidding had already reached one thousand and\nthat his commission was twenty per cent, had engendered a mood of sunny\nhappiness.\n\n\"One thousand is bid!\" he carolled. \"Now, gentlemen, I don't want to\nhurry you over this. You are all connoisseurs here, and you don't want\nto see a priceless china figure of the Ming Dynasty get away from you\nat a sacrifice price. Perhaps you can't all see the figure where it\nis. Willie, take it round and show it to 'em. We'll take a little\nintermission while you look carefully at this wonderful figure. Get a\nmove on, Willie! Pick up your feet!\"\n\nArchie, sitting dazedly, was aware that Reggie van Tuyl had finished his\nbeauty sleep and was addressing the young man in the seat in front.\n\n\"Why, hallo,\" said Reggie. \"I didn't know you were back. You remember\nme, don't you? Reggie van Tuyl. I know your sister very well. Archie,\nold man, I want you to meet my friend, Bill Brewster. Why, dash it!\" He\nchuckled sleepily. \"I was forgetting. Of course! He's your--\"\n\n\"How are you?\" said the young man. \"Talking of my sister,\" he said to\nReggie, \"I suppose you haven't met her husband by any chance? I suppose\nyou know she married some awful chump?\"\n\n\"Me,\" said Archie.\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"I married your sister. My name's Moffam.\"\n\nThe young man seemed a trifle taken aback.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Archie.\n\n\"I was only going by what my father said in his letters,\" he explained,\nin extenuation.\n\nArchie nodded.\n\n\"I'm afraid your jolly old father doesn't appreciate me. But I'm hoping\nfor the best. If I can rope in that rummy-looking little china thing\nthat Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy is showing the customers, he will be all\nover me. I mean to say, you know, he's got another like it, and, if\nhe can get a full house, as it were, I'm given to understand he'll be\nbucked, cheered, and even braced.\"\n\nThe young man stared.\n\n\"Are YOU the fellow who's been bidding against me?\"\n\n\"Eh, what? Were you bidding against ME?\"\n\n\"I wanted to buy the thing for my father. I've a special reason for\nwanting to get in right with him just now. Are you buying it for him,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. As a surprise. It was Lucille's idea. His valet, a chappie\nnamed Parker, tipped us off that the thing was to be sold.\"\n\n\"Parker? Great Scot! It was Parker who tipped ME off. I met him on\nBroadway, and he told me about it.\"\n\n\"Rummy he never mentioned it in his letter to me. Why, dash it, we could\nhave got the thing for about two dollars if we had pooled our bids.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better pool them now, and extinguish that pill at the back\nthere. I can't go above eleven hundred. That's all I've got.\"\n\n\"I can't go above eleven hundred myself.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing. I wish you'd let me be the one to hand the\nthing over to Father. I've a special reason for wanting to make a hit\nwith him.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said Archie, magnanimously. \"It's all the same to me. I\nonly wanted to get him generally braced, as it were, if you know what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"That's awfully good of you.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, laddie, no, no, and far from it. Only too glad.\"\n\nWillie had returned from his rambles among the connoisseurs, and Pongo's\nbrother was back on his pedestal. The high-priest cleared his throat and\nresumed his discourse.\n\n\"Now that you have all seen this superb figure we will--I was offered\none thousand--one thousand-one-one-one-one--eleven hundred. Thank you,\nsir. Eleven hundred I am offered.\"\n\nThe high-priest was now exuberant. You could see him doing figures in\nhis head.\n\n\"You do the bidding,\" said Brother Bill.\n\n\"Right-o!\" said Archie.\n\nHe waved a defiant hand.\n\n\"Thirteen,\" said the man at the back.\n\n\"Fourteen, dash it!\"\n\n\"Fifteen!\"\n\n\"Sixteen!\"\n\n\"Seventeen!\"\n\n\"Eighteen!\"\n\n\"Nineteen!\"\n\n\"Two thousand!\"\n\nThe high-priest did everything but sing. He radiated good will and\nbonhomie.\n\n\"Two thousand I am offered. Is there any advance on two thousand? Come,\ngentlemen, I don't want to give this superb figure away. Twenty-one\nhundred. Twenty-one-one-one-one. This is more the sort of thing I have\nbeen accustomed to. When I was at Sotheby's Rooms in London, this kind\nof bidding was a common-place. Twenty-two-two-two-two-two. One hardly\nnoticed it. Three-three-three. Twenty-three-three-three. Twenty-three\nhundred dollars I am offered.\"\n\nHe gazed expectantly at Archie, as a man gazes at some favourite dog\nwhom he calls upon to perform a trick. But Archie had reached the end of\nhis tether. The hand that had twiddled so often and so bravely lay inert\nbeside his trouser-leg, twitching feebly. Archie was through.\n\n\"Twenty-three hundred,\" said the high-priest, ingratiatingly.\n\nArchie made no movement. There was a tense pause. The high-priest gave a\nlittle sigh, like one waking from a beautiful dream.\n\n\"Twenty-three hundred,\" he said. \"Once twenty-three. Twice twenty-three.\nThird, last, and final call, twenty-three. Sold at twenty-three hundred.\nI congratulate you, sir, on a genuine bargain!\"\n\nReggie van Tuyl had dozed off again. Archie tapped his brother-in-law on\nthe shoulder.\n\n\"May as well be popping, what?\"\n\nThey threaded their way sadly together through the crowd, and made for\nthe street. They passed into Fifth Avenue without breaking the silence.\n\n\"Bally nuisance,\" said Archie, at last.\n\n\"Rotten!\"\n\n\"Wonder who that chappie was?\"\n\n\"Some collector, probably.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be helped,\" said Archie.\n\nBrother Bill attached himself to Archie's arm, and became communicative.\n\n\"I didn't want to mention it in front of van Tuyl,\" he said, \"because\nhe's such a talking-machine, and it would have been all over New York\nbefore dinner-time. But you're one of the family, and you can keep a\nsecret.\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Silent tomb and what not.\"\n\n\"The reason I wanted that darned thing was because I've just got engaged\nto a girl over in England, and I thought that, if I could hand my father\nthat china figure-thing with one hand and break the news with the other,\nit might help a bit. She's the most wonderful girl!\"\n\n\"I'll bet she is,\" said Archie, cordially.\n\n\"The trouble is she's in the chorus of one of the revues over there,\nand Father is apt to kick. So I thought--oh, well, it's no good worrying\nnow. Come along where it's quiet, and I'll tell you all about her.\"\n\n\"That'll be jolly,\" said Archie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. SALVATORE CHOOSES THE WRONG MOMENT\n\n\nArchie reclaimed the family jewellery from its temporary home next\nmorning; and, having done so, sauntered back to the Cosmopolis. He\nwas surprised, on entering the lobby, to meet his father-in-law. More\nsurprising still, Mr. Brewster was manifestly in a mood of extraordinary\ngeniality. Archie could hardly believe his eyes when the other waved\ncheerily to him--nor his ears a moment later when Mr. Brewster,\naddressing him as \"my boy,\" asked him how he was and mentioned that the\nday was a warm one.\n\nObviously this jovial frame of mind must be taken advantage of; and\nArchie's first thought was of the downtrodden Salvatore, to the tale of\nwhose wrongs he had listened so sympathetically on the previous day. Now\nwas plainly the moment for the waiter to submit his grievance, before\nsome ebb-tide caused the milk of human kindness to flow out of Daniel\nBrewster. With a swift \"Cheerio!\" in his father-in-law's direction,\nArchie bounded into the grill-room. Salvatore, the hour for luncheon\nbeing imminent but not yet having arrived, was standing against the far\nwall in an attitude of thought.\n\n\"Laddie!\" cried Archie.\n\n\"Sare?\"\n\n\"A most extraordinary thing has happened. Good old Brewster has suddenly\npopped up through a trap and is out in the lobby now. And what's still\nmore weird, he's apparently bucked.\"\n\n\"Sare?\"\n\n\"Braced, you know. In the pink. Pleased about something. If you go to\nhim now with that yarn of yours, you can't fail. He'll kiss you on both\ncheeks and give you his bank-roll and collar-stud. Charge along and ask\nthe head-waiter if you can have ten minutes off.\"\n\nSalvatore vanished in search of the potentate named, and Archie returned\nto the lobby to bask in the unwonted sunshine.\n\n\"Well, well, well, what!\" he said. \"I thought you were at Brookport.\"\n\n\"I came up this morning to meet a friend of mine,\" replied Mr. Brewster\ngenially. \"Professor Binstead.\"\n\n\"Don't think I know him.\"\n\n\"Very interesting man,\" said Mr. Brewster, still with the same uncanny\namiability. \"He's a dabbler in a good many things--science, phrenology,\nantiques. I asked him to bid for me at a sale yesterday. There was a\nlittle china figure--\"\n\nArchie's jaw fell.\n\n\"China figure?\" he stammered feebly.\n\n\"Yes. The companion to one you may have noticed on my mantelpiece\nupstairs. I have been trying to get the pair of them for years. I should\nnever have heard of this one if it had not been for that valet of mine,\nParker. Very good of him to let me know of it, considering I had fired\nhim. Ah, here is Binstead.\"-He moved to greet the small, middle-aged\nman with the tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles who was bustling across the\nlobby. \"Well, Binstead, so you got it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose the price wasn't particularly stiff?\"\n\n\"Twenty-three hundred.\"\n\n\"Twenty-three hundred!\" Mr. Brewster seemed to reel in his tracks.\n\"Twenty-three HUNDRED!\"\n\n\"You gave me carte blanche.\"\n\n\"Yes, but twenty-three hundred!\"\n\n\"I could have got it for a few dollars, but unfortunately I was a little\nlate, and, when I arrived, some young fool had bid it up to a thousand,\nand he stuck to me till I finally shook him off at twenty-three hundred.\nWhy, this is the very man! Is he a friend of yours?\"\n\nArchie coughed.\n\n\"More a relation than a friend, what? Son-in-law, don't you know!\"\n\nMr. Brewster's amiability had vanished.\n\n\"What damned foolery have you been up to NOW?\" he demanded. \"Can't I\nmove a step without stubbing my toe on you? Why the devil did you bid?\"\n\n\"We thought it would be rather a fruity scheme. We talked it over and\ncame to the conclusion that it was an egg. Wanted to get hold of the\nrummy little object, don't you know, and surprise you.\"\n\n\"Who's we?\"\n\n\"Lucille and I.\"\n\n\"But how did you hear of it at all?\"\n\n\"Parker, the valet-chappie, you know, wrote me a letter about it.\"\n\n\"Parker! Didn't he tell you that he had told me the figure was to be\nsold?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not!\" A sudden suspicion came to Archie. He was normally a\nguileless young man, but even to him the extreme fishiness of the part\nplayed by Herbert Parker had become apparent. \"I say, you know, it looks\nto me as if friend Parker had been having us all on a bit, what? I\nmean to say it was jolly old Herb, who tipped your son off--Bill, you\nknow--to go and bid for the thing.\"\n\n\"Bill! Was Bill there?\"\n\n\"Absolutely in person! We were bidding against each other like the\ndickens till we managed to get together and get acquainted. And then\nthis bird--this gentleman--sailed in and started to slip it across us.\"\n\nProfessor Binstead chuckled--the care-free chuckle of a man who sees\nall those around him smitten in the pocket, while he himself remains\nuntouched.\n\n\"A very ingenious rogue, this Parker of yours, Brewster. His method\nseems to have been simple but masterly. I have no doubt that either he\nor a confederate obtained the figure and placed it with the auctioneer,\nand then he ensured a good price for it by getting us all to bid against\neach other. Very ingenious!\"\n\nMr. Brewster struggled with his feelings. Then he seemed to overcome\nthem and to force himself to look on the bright side.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" he said. \"I've got the pair of figures, and that's what\nI wanted. Is that it in that parcel?\"\n\n\"This is it. I wouldn't trust an express company to deliver it. Suppose\nwe go up to your room and see how the two look side by side.\"\n\nThey crossed the lobby to the lift.-The cloud was still on Mr.\nBrewster's brow as they stepped out and made their way to his suite.\nLike most men who have risen from poverty to wealth by their\nown exertions, Mr. Brewster objected to parting with his money\nunnecessarily, and it was plain that that twenty-three hundred dollars\nstill rankled.\n\nMr. Brewster unlocked the door and crossed the room. Then, suddenly, he\nhalted, stared, and stared again. He sprang to the bell and pressed it,\nthen stood gurgling wordlessly.\n\n\"Anything wrong, old bean?\" queried Archie, solicitously.\n\n\"Wrong! Wrong! It's gone!\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"The figure!\"\n\nThe floor-waiter had manifested himself silently in answer to the bell,\nand was standing in the doorway.\n\n\"Simmons!\" Mr. Brewster turned to him wildly. \"Has anyone been in this\nsuite since I went away?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Nobody?\"\n\n\"Nobody except your valet, sir--Parker. He said he had come to\nfetch some things away. I supposed he had come from you, sir, with\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"Get out!\"\n\nProfessor Binstead had unwrapped his parcel, and had placed the Pongo\non the table. There was a weighty silence. Archie picked up the little\nchina figure and balanced it on the palm of his hand. It was a small\nthing, he reflected philosophically, but it had made quite a stir in the\nworld.\n\nMr. Brewster fermented for a while without speaking.\n\n\"So,\" he said, at last, in a voice trembling with self-pity, \"I have\nbeen to all this trouble--\"\n\n\"And expense,\" put in Professor Binstead, gently.\n\n\"Merely to buy back something which had been stolen from me! And, owing\nto your damned officiousness,\" he cried, turning on Archie, \"I have had\nto pay twenty-three hundred dollars for it! I don't know why they make\nsuch a fuss about Job. Job never had anything like you around!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" argued Archie, \"he had one or two boils.\"\n\n\"Boils! What are boils?\"\n\n\"Dashed sorry,\" murmured Archie. \"Acted for the best. Meant well. And\nall that sort of rot!\"\n\nProfessor Binstead's mind seemed occupied to the exclusion of all other\naspects of the affair, with the ingenuity of the absent Parker.\n\n\"A cunning scheme!\" he said. \"A very cunning scheme! This man Parker\nmust have a brain of no low order. I should like to feel his bumps!\"\n\n\"I should like to give him some!\" said the stricken Mr. Brewster. He\nbreathed a deep breath. \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"situated as I am, with a\ncrook valet and an imbecile son-in-law, I suppose I ought to be\nthankful that I've still got my own property, even if I have had to\npay twenty-three hundred dollars for the privilege of keeping it.\" He\nrounded on Archie, who was in a reverie. The thought of the unfortunate\nBill had just crossed Archie's mind. It would be many moons, many\nweary moons, before Mr. Brewster would be in a suitable mood to listen\nsympathetically to the story of love's young dream. \"Give me that\nfigure!\"\n\nArchie continued to toy absently with Pongo. He was wondering now\nhow best to break this sad occurrence to Lucille. It would be a\ndisappointment for the poor girl.\n\n\"GIVE ME THAT FIGURE!\"\n\nArchie started violently. There was an instant in which Pongo seemed to\nhang suspended, like Mohammed's coffin, between heaven and earth, then\nthe force of gravity asserted itself. Pongo fell with a sharp crack and\ndisintegrated. And as it did so there was a knock at the door, and in\nwalked a dark, furtive person, who to the inflamed vision of Mr. Daniel\nBrewster looked like something connected with the executive staff of the\nBlack Hand. With all time at his disposal, the unfortunate Salvatore had\nselected this moment for stating his case.\n\n\"Get out!\" bellowed Mr. Brewster. \"I didn't ring for a waiter.\"\n\nArchie, his mind reeling beneath the catastrophe, recovered himself\nsufficiently to do the honours. It was at his instigation that Salvatore\nwas there, and, greatly as he wished that he could have seen fit to\nchoose a more auspicious moment for his business chat, he felt compelled\nto do his best to see him through.\n\n\"Oh, I say, half a second,\" he said. \"You don't quite understand. As\na matter of fact, this chappie is by way of being downtrodden and\noppressed and what not, and I suggested that he should get hold of you\nand speak a few well-chosen words. Of course, if you'd rather--some\nother time--\"\n\nBut Mr. Brewster was not permitted to postpone the interview. Before\nhe could get his breath, Salvatore had begun to talk. He was a strong,\nambidextrous talker, whom it was hard to interrupt; and it was not for\nsome moments that Mr. Brewster succeeded in getting a word in. When he\ndid, he spoke to the point. Though not a linguist, he had been able\nto follow the discourse closely enough to realise that the waiter was\ndissatisfied with conditions in his hotel; and Mr. Brewster, as has been\nindicated, had a short way with people who criticised the Cosmopolis.\n\n\"You're fired!\" said Mr. Brewster.\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" protested Archie.\n\nSalvatore muttered what sounded like a passage from Dante.\n\n\"Fired!\" repeated Mr. Brewster resolutely. \"And I wish to heaven,\" he\nadded, eyeing his son-in-law malignantly, \"I could fire you!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Professor Binstead cheerfully, breaking the grim silence\nwhich followed this outburst, \"if you will give me your cheque,\nBrewster, I think I will be going. Two thousand three hundred dollars.\nMake it open, if you will, and then I can run round the corner and cash\nit before lunch. That will be capital!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. BRIGHT EYES--AND A FLY\n\n\nThe Hermitage (unrivalled scenery, superb cuisine, Daniel Brewster,\nproprietor) was a picturesque summer hotel in the green heart of the\nmountains, built by Archie's father-in-law shortly after he assumed\ncontrol of the Cosmopolis. Mr. Brewster himself seldom went there,\npreferring to concentrate his attention on his New York establishment;\nand Archie and Lucille, breakfasting in the airy dining-room some ten\ndays after the incidents recorded in the last chapter, had consequently\nto be content with two out of the three advertised attractions of the\nplace. Through the window at their side quite a slab of the unrivalled\nscenery was visible; some of the superb cuisine was already on the\ntable; and the fact that the eye searched in vain for Daniel Brewster,\nproprietor, filled Archie, at any rate, with no sense of aching loss. He\nbore it with equanimity and even with positive enthusiasm. In Archie's\nopinion, practically all a place needed to make it an earthly Paradise\nwas for Mr. Daniel Brewster to be about forty-seven miles away from it.\n\nIt was at Lucille's suggestion that they had come to the Hermitage.\nNever a human sunbeam, Mr. Brewster had shown such a bleak front to the\nworld, and particularly to his son-in-law, in the days following the\nPongo incident, that Lucille had thought that he and Archie would for a\ntime at least be better apart--a view with which her husband cordially\nagreed. He had enjoyed his stay at the Hermitage, and now he regarded\nthe eternal hills with the comfortable affection of a healthy man who is\nbreakfasting well.\n\n\"It's going to be another perfectly topping day,\" he observed, eyeing\nthe shimmering landscape, from which the morning mists were swiftly\nshredding away like faint puffs of smoke. \"Just the day you ought to\nhave been here.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's too bad I've got to go. New York will be like an oven.\"\n\n\"Put it off.\"\n\n\"I can't, I'm afraid. I've a fitting.\"\n\nArchie argued no further. He was a married man of old enough standing to\nknow the importance of fittings.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Lucille, \"I want to see father.\" Archie repressed an\nexclamation of astonishment. \"I'll be back to-morrow evening. You will\nbe perfectly happy.\"\n\n\"Queen of my soul, you know I can't be happy with you away. You know--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" murmured Lucille, appreciatively. She never tired of hearing\nArchie say this sort of thing.\n\nArchie's voice had trailed off. He was looking across the room.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"What an awfully pretty woman!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Over there. Just coming in, I say, what wonderful eyes! I don't think\nI ever saw such eyes. Did you notice her eyes? Sort of flashing! Awfully\npretty woman!\"\n\nWarm though the morning was, a suspicion of chill descended upon the\nbreakfast-table. A certain coldness seemed to come into Lucille's face.\nShe could not always share Archie's fresh young enthusiasms.\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Wonderful figure, too!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, what I mean to say, fair to medium,\" said Archie, recovering a\ncertain amount of that intelligence which raises man above the level\nof the beasts of the field. \"Not the sort of type I admire myself, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"You know her, don't you?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not and far from it,\" said Archie, hastily. \"Never met her\nin my life.\"\n\n\"You've seen her on the stage. Her name's Vera Silverton. We saw her\nin--\"\n\n\"Of course, yes. So we did. I say, I wonder what she's doing here?\nShe ought to be in New York, rehearsing. I remember meeting\nwhat's-his-name--you know--chappie who writes plays and what not--George\nBenham--I remember meeting George Benham, and he told me she was\nrehearsing in a piece of his called--I forget the name, but I know it\nwas called something or other. Well, why isn't she?\"\n\n\"She probably lost her temper and broke her contract and came away.\nShe's always doing that sort of thing. She's known for it. She must be a\nhorrid woman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about her. She used to be married to someone,\nand she divorced him. And then she was married to someone else, and he\ndivorced her. And I'm certain her hair wasn't that colour two years ago,\nand I don't think a woman ought to make up like that, and her dress is\nall wrong for the country, and those pearls can't be genuine, and I hate\nthe way she rolls her eyes about, and pink doesn't suit her a bit. I\nthink she's an awful woman, and I wish you wouldn't keep on talking\nabout her.\"\n\n\"Right-o!\" said Archie, dutifully.\n\nThey finished breakfast, and Lucille went up to pack her bag. Archie\nstrolled out on to the terrace outside the hotel, where he smoked,\ncommuned with nature, and thought of Lucille. He always thought of\nLucille when he was alone, especially when he chanced to find himself\nin poetic surroundings like those provided by the unrivalled scenery\nencircling the Hotel Hermitage. The longer he was married to her the\nmore did the sacred institution seem to him a good egg. Mr. Brewster\nmight regard their marriage as one of the world's most unfortunate\nincidents, but to Archie it was, and always had been, a bit of all\nright. The more he thought of it the more did he marvel that a girl like\nLucille should have been content to link her lot with that of a Class C\nspecimen like himself. His meditations were, in fact, precisely what a\nhappily-married man's meditations ought to be.\n\nHe was roused from them by a species of exclamation or cry almost at\nhis elbow, and turned to find that the spectacular Miss Silverton was\nstanding beside him. Her dubious hair gleamed in the sunlight, and one\nof the criticised eyes was screwed up. The other gazed at Archie with an\nexpression of appeal.\n\n\"There's something in my eye,\" she said.\n\n\"No, really!\"\n\n\"I wonder if you would mind? It would be so kind of you!\"\n\nArchie would have preferred to remove himself, but no man worthy of\nthe name can decline to come to the rescue of womanhood in distress. To\ntwist the lady's upper lid back and peer into it and jab at it with the\ncorner of his handkerchief was the only course open to him. His conduct\nmay be classed as not merely blameless but definitely praiseworthy. King\nArthur's knights used to do this sort of thing all the time, and look\nwhat people think of them. Lucille, therefore, coming out of the\nhotel just as the operation was concluded, ought not to have felt\nthe annoyance she did. But, of course, there is a certain superficial\nintimacy about the attitude of a man who is taking a fly out of a\nwoman's eye which may excusably jar upon the sensibilities of his wife.\nIt is an attitude which suggests a sort of rapprochement or camaraderie\nor, as Archie would have put it, what not.\n\n\"Thanks so much!\" said Miss Silverton.\n\n\"Oh no, rather not,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Such a nuisance getting things in your eye.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\n\"I'm always doing it!\"\n\n\"Rotten luck!\"\n\n\"But I don't often find anyone as clever as you to help me.\"\n\nLucille felt called upon to break in on this feast of reason and flow of\nsoul.\n\n\"Archie,\" she said, \"if you go and get your clubs now, I shall just have\ntime to walk round with you before my train goes.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah!\" said Archie, perceiving her for the first time. \"Oh, ah, yes,\nright-o, yes, yes, yes!\"\n\nOn the way to the first tee it seemed to Archie that Lucille was\ndistrait and abstracted in her manner; and it occurred to him, not for\nthe first time in his life, what a poor support a clear conscience is\nin moments of crisis. Dash it all, he didn't see what else he could have\ndone. Couldn't leave the poor female staggering about the place with\nsquads of flies wedged in her eyeball. Nevertheless--\n\n\"Rotten thing getting a fly in your eye,\" he hazarded at length. \"Dashed\nawkward, I mean.\"\n\n\"Or convenient.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Well, it's a very good way of dispensing with an introduction.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say! You don't mean you think--\"\n\n\"She's a horrid woman!\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Can't think what people see in her.\"\n\n\"Well, you seemed to enjoy fussing over her!\"\n\n\"No, no! Nothing of the kind! She inspired me with absolute\nwhat-d'you-call-it--the sort of thing chappies do get inspired with, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"You were beaming all over your face.\"\n\n\"I wasn't. I was just screwing up my face because the sun was in my\neye.\"\n\n\"All sorts of things seem to be in people's eyes this morning!\"\n\n Archie was saddened. That this sort of misunderstanding should have\noccurred on such a topping day and at a moment when they were to be torn\nasunder for about thirty-six hours made him feel--well, it gave him the\npip. He had an idea that there were words which would have straightened\neverything out, but he was not an eloquent young man and could not find\nthem. He felt aggrieved. Lucille, he considered, ought to have\nknown that he was immune as regarded females with flashing eyes and\nexperimentally-coloured hair. Why, dash it, he could have extracted\nflies from the eyes of Cleopatra with one hand and Helen of Troy with\nthe other, simultaneously, without giving them a second thought. It was\nin depressed mood that he played a listless nine holes; nor had life\nbrightened for him when he came back to the hotel two hours later, after\nseeing Lucille off in the train to New York. Never till now had they had\nanything remotely resembling a quarrel. Life, Archie felt, was a bit of\na wash-out. He was disturbed and jumpy, and the sight of Miss Silverton,\ntalking to somebody on a settee in the corner of the hotel lobby, sent\nhim shooting off at right angles and brought him up with a bump against\nthe desk behind which the room-clerk sat.\n\nThe room-clerk, always of a chatty disposition, was saying something to\nhim, but Archie did not listen. He nodded mechanically. It was something\nabout his room. He caught the word \"satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Oh, rather, quite!\" said Archie.\n\nA fussy devil, the room-clerk! He knew perfectly well that Archie found\nhis room satisfactory. These chappies gassed on like this so as to try\nto make you feel that the management took a personal interest in you.\nIt was part of their job. Archie beamed absently and went in to lunch.\nLucille's empty seat stared at him mournfully, increasing his sense of\ndesolation.\n\nHe was half-way through his lunch, when the chair opposite ceased to\nbe vacant. Archie, transferring his gaze from the scenery outside the\nwindow, perceived that his friend, George Benham, the playwright, had\nmaterialised from nowhere and was now in his midst.\n\n\"Hallo!\" he said.\n\nGeorge Benham was a grave young man whose spectacles gave him the look\nof a mournful owl. He seemed to have something on his mind besides the\nartistically straggling mop of black hair which swept down over his\nbrow. He sighed wearily, and ordered fish-pie.\n\n\"I thought I saw you come through the lobby just now,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, was that you on the settee, talking to Miss Silverton?\"\n\n\"She was talking to ME,\" said the playwright, moodily.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Archie. He could have wished Mr. Benham\nelsewhere, for he intruded on his gloom, but, the chappie being amongst\nthose present, it was only civil to talk to him. \"I thought you were in\nNew York, watching the rehearsals of your jolly old drama.\"\n\n\"The rehearsals are hung up. And it looks as though there wasn't going\nto be any drama. Good Lord!\" cried George Benham, with honest warmth,\n\"with opportunities opening out before one on every side--with life\nextending prizes to one with both hands--when you see coal-heavers\nmaking fifty dollars a week and the fellows who clean out the sewers\ngoing happy and singing about their work--why does a man deliberately\nchoose a job like writing plays? Job was the only man that ever lived\nwho was really qualified to write a play, and he would have found\nit pretty tough going if his leading woman had been anyone like Vera\nSilverton!\"\n\nArchie--and it was this fact, no doubt, which accounted for his\npossession of such a large and varied circle of friends--was always\nable to shelve his own troubles in order to listen to other people's\nhard-luck stories.\n\n\"Tell me all, laddie,\" he said. \"Release the film! Has she walked out on\nyou?\"\n\n\"Left us flat! How did you hear about it? Oh, she told you, of course?\"\n\nArchie hastened to try to dispel the idea that he was on any such terms\nof intimacy with Miss Silverton.\n\n\"No, no! My wife said she thought it must be something of that nature or\norder when we saw her come in to breakfast. I mean to say,\" said\nArchie, reasoning closely, \"woman can't come into breakfast here and\nbe rehearsing in New York at the same time. Why did she administer the\nraspberry, old friend?\"\n\nMr. Benham helped himself to fish-pie, and spoke dully through the\nsteam.\n\n\"Well, what happened was this. Knowing her as intimately as you do--\"\n\n\"I DON'T know her!\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, it was like this. As you know, she has a dog--\"\n\n\"I didn't know she had a dog,\" protested Archie. It seemed to him that\nthe world was in conspiracy to link him with this woman.\n\n\"Well, she has a dog. A beastly great whacking brute of a bulldog. And\nshe brings it to rehearsal.\" Mr. Benham's eyes filled with tears, as\nin his emotion he swallowed a mouthful of fish-pie some eighty-three\ndegrees Fahrenheit hotter than it looked. In the intermission caused by\nthis disaster his agile mind skipped a few chapters of the story, and,\nwhen he was able to speak again, he said, \"So then there was a lot of\ntrouble. Everything broke loose!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Archie was puzzled. \"Did the management object to her bringing\nthe dog to rehearsal?\"\n\n\"A lot of good that would have done! She does what she likes in the\ntheatre.\"\n\n\"Then why was there trouble?\"\n\n\"You weren't listening,\" said Mr. Benham, reproachfully. \"I told you.\nThis dog came snuffling up to where I was sitting--it was quite dark in\nthe body of the theatre, you know--and I got up to say something about\nsomething that was happening on the stage, and somehow I must have given\nit a push with my foot.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Archie, beginning to get the run of the plot. \"You kicked\nher dog.\"\n\n\"Pushed it. Accidentally. With my foot.\"\n\n\"I understand. And when you brought off this kick--\"\n\n\"Push,\" said Mr. Benham, austerely.\n\n\"This kick or push. When you administered this kick or push--\"\n\n\"It was more a sort of light shove.\"\n\n\"Well, when you did whatever you did, the trouble started?\"\n\nMr. Benham gave a slight shiver.\n\n\"She talked for a while, and then walked out, taking the dog with her.\nYou see, this wasn't the first time it had happened.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Do you spend your whole time doing that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"It wasn't me the first time. It was the stage-manager. He didn't know\nwhose dog it was, and it came waddling on to the stage, and he gave it a\nsort of pat, a kind of flick--\"\n\n\"A slosh?\"\n\n\"NOT a slosh,\" corrected Mr. Benham, firmly. \"You might call it a\ntap--with the promptscript. Well, we had a lot of difficulty smoothing\nher over that time. Still, we managed to do it, but she said that if\nanything of the sort occurred again she would chuck up her part.\"\n\n\"She must be fond of the dog,\" said Archie, for the first time feeling a\ntouch of goodwill and sympathy towards the lady.\n\n\"She's crazy about, it. That's what made it so awkward when I\nhappened--quite inadvertently--to give it this sort of accidental shove.\nWell, we spent the rest of the day trying to get her on the 'phone at\nher apartment, and finally we heard that she had come here. So I took\nthe next train, and tried to persuade her to come back. She wouldn't\nlisten. And that's how matters stand.\"\n\n\"Pretty rotten!\" said Archie, sympathetically.\n\n\"You can bet it's pretty rotten--for me. There's nobody else who can\nplay the part. Like a chump, I wrote the thing specially for her. It\nmeans the play won't be produced at all, if she doesn't do it. So you're\nmy last hope!\"\n\nArchie, who was lighting a cigarette, nearly swallowed it.\n\n\"_I_ am?\"\n\n\"I thought you might persuade her. Point out to her what a lot hangs on\nher coming back. Jolly her along, YOU know the sort of thing!\"\n\n\"But, my dear old friend, I tell you I don't know her!\"\n\nMr. Benham's eyes opened behind their zareba of glass.\n\n\"Well, she knows YOU. When you came through the lobby just now she said\nthat you were the only real human being she had ever met.\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I did take a fly out of her eye. But--\"\n\n\"You did? Well, then, the whole thing's simple. All you have to do is to\nask her how her eye is, and tell her she has the most beautiful eyes you\never saw, and coo a bit.\"\n\n\"But, my dear old son!\" The frightful programme which his friend had\nmapped out stunned Archie. \"I simply can't! Anything to oblige and all\nthat sort of thing, but when it comes to cooing, distinctly Napoo!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! It isn't hard to coo.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, laddie. You're not a married man. I mean to say,\nwhatever you say for or against marriage--personally I'm all for it and\nconsider it a ripe egg--the fact remains that it practically makes a\nchappie a spent force as a cooer. I don't want to dish you in any way,\nold bean, but I must firmly and resolutely decline to coo.\"\n\nMr. Benham rose and looked at his watch.\n\n\"I'll have to be moving,\" he said. \"I've got to get back to New York and\nreport. I'll tell them that I haven't been able to do anything myself,\nbut that I've left the matter in good hands. I know you will do your\nbest.\"\n\n\"But, laddie!\"\n\n\"Think,\" said Mr. Benham, solemnly, \"of all that depends on it! The\nother actors! The small-part people thrown out of a job! Myself--but no!\nPerhaps you had better touch very lightly or not at all on my connection\nwith the thing. Well, you know how to handle it. I feel I can leave\nit to you. Pitch it strong! Good-bye, my dear old man, and a thousand\nthanks. I'll do the same for you another time.\" He moved towards the\ndoor, leaving Archie transfixed. Half-way there he turned and came back.\n\"Oh, by the way,\" he said, \"my lunch. Have it put on your bill, will\nyou? I haven't time to stay and settle. Good-bye! Good-bye!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. RALLYING ROUND PERCY\n\n\nIt amazed Archie through the whole of a long afternoon to reflect how\nswiftly and unexpectedly the blue and brilliant sky of life can cloud\nover and with what abruptness a man who fancies that his feet are on\nsolid ground can find himself immersed in Fate's gumbo. He recalled,\nwith the bitterness with which one does recall such things, that that\nmorning he had risen from his bed without a care in the world, his\nhappiness unruffled even by the thought that Lucille would be leaving\nhim for a short space. He had sung in his bath. Yes, he had chirruped\nlike a bally linnet. And now--\n\nSome men would have dismissed the unfortunate affairs of Mr. George\nBenham from their mind as having nothing to do with themselves, but\nArchie had never been made of this stern stuff. The fact that Mr.\nBenham, apart from being an agreeable companion with whom he had lunched\noccasionally in New York, had no claims upon him affected him little. He\nhated to see his fellowman in trouble. On the other hand, what could\nhe do? To seek Miss Silverton out and plead with her--even if he did\nit without cooing--would undoubtedly establish an intimacy between them\nwhich, instinct told him, might tinge her manner after Lucille's return\nwith just that suggestion of Auld Lang Syne which makes things so\nawkward.\n\nHis whole being shrank from extending to Miss Silverton that inch which\nthe female artistic temperament is so apt to turn into an ell; and when,\njust as he was about to go in to dinner, he met her in the lobby and she\nsmiled brightly at him and informed him that her eye was now completely\nrecovered, he shied away like a startled mustang of the prairie, and,\nabandoning his intention of worrying the table d'hote in the same room\nwith the amiable creature, tottered off to the smoking-room, where he\ndid the best he could with sandwiches and coffee.\n\nHaving got through the time as best he could till eleven o'clock, he\nwent up to bed.\n\nThe room to which he and Lucille had been assigned by the management was\non the second floor, pleasantly sunny by day and at night filled with\ncool and heartening fragrance of the pines. Hitherto Archie had always\nenjoyed taking a final smoke on the balcony overlooking the woods,\nbut, to-night such was his mental stress that he prepared to go to bed\ndirectly he had closed the door. He turned to the cupboard to get his\npyjamas.\n\nHis first thought, when even after a second scrutiny no pyjamas were\nvisible, was that this was merely another of those things which happen\non days when life goes wrong. He raked the cupboard for a third time\nwith an annoyed eye. From every hook hung various garments of Lucille's,\nbut no pyjamas. He was breathing a soft malediction preparatory to\nembarking on a point-to-point hunt for his missing property, when\nsomething in the cupboard caught his eye and held him for a moment\npuzzled.\n\nHe could have sworn that Lucille did not possess a mauve neglige. Why,\nshe had told him a dozen times that mauve was a colour which she did\nnot like. He frowned perplexedly; and as he did so, from near the window\ncame a soft cough.\n\nArchie spun round and subjected the room to as close a scrutiny as that\nwhich he had bestowed upon the cupboard. Nothing was visible. The window\nopening on to the balcony gaped wide. The balcony was manifestly empty.\n\n\"URRF!\"\n\nThis time there was no possibility of error. The cough had come from the\nimmediate neighbourhood of the window.\n\nArchie was conscious of a pringly sensation about the roots of his\nclosely-cropped back-hair, as he moved cautiously across the room. The\naffair was becoming uncanny; and, as he tip-toed towards the window, old\nghost stories, read in lighter moments before cheerful fires with\nplenty of light in the room, flitted through his mind. He had the\nfeeling--precisely as every chappie in those stories had had--that he\nwas not alone.\n\nNor was he. In a basket behind an arm-chair, curled up, with his massive\nchin resting on the edge of the wicker-work, lay a fine bulldog.\n\n\"Urrf!\" said the bulldog.\n\n\"Good God!\" said Archie.\n\nThere was a lengthy pause in which the bulldog looked earnestly at\nArchie and Archie looked earnestly at the bulldog.\n\nNormally, Archie was a dog-lover. His hurry was never so great as to\nprevent him stopping, when in the street, and introducing himself to any\ndog he met. In a strange house, his first act was to assemble the canine\npopulation, roll it on its back or backs, and punch it in the ribs. As a\nboy, his earliest ambition had been to become a veterinary surgeon; and,\nthough the years had cheated him of his career, he knew all about dogs,\ntheir points, their manners, their customs, and their treatment in\nsickness and in health. In short, he loved dogs, and, had they met under\nhappier conditions, he would undoubtedly have been on excellent terms\nwith this one within the space of a minute. But, as things were, he\nabstained from fraternising and continued to goggle dumbly.\n\nAnd then his eye, wandering aside, collided with the following objects:\na fluffy pink dressing-gown, hung over the back of a chair, an entirely\nstrange suit-case, and, on the bureau, a photograph in a silver frame of\na stout gentleman in evening-dress whom he had never seen before in his\nlife.\n\nMuch has been written of the emotions of the wanderer who, returning to\nhis childhood home, finds it altered out of all recognition; but poets\nhave neglected the theme--far more poignant--of the man who goes up to\nhis room in an hotel and finds it full of somebody else's dressing-gowns\nand bulldogs.\n\nBulldogs! Archie's heart jumped sideways and upwards with a wiggling\nmovement, turning two somersaults, and stopped beating. The hideous\ntruth, working its way slowly through the concrete, had at last\npenetrated to his brain. He was not only in somebody else's room, and a\nwoman's at that. He was in the room belonging to Miss Vera Silverton.\n\nHe could not understand it. He would have been prepared to stake the\nlast cent he could borrow from his father-in-law on the fact that he had\nmade no error in the number over the door. Yet, nevertheless, such was\nthe case, and, below par though his faculties were at the moment, he was\nsufficiently alert to perceive that it behoved him to withdraw.\n\nHe leaped to the door, and, as he did so, the handle began to turn.\n\nThe cloud which had settled on Archie's mind lifted abruptly. For an\ninstant he was enabled to think about a hundred times more quickly than\nwas his leisurely wont. Good fortune had brought him to within easy\nreach of the electric-light switch. He snapped it back, and was in\ndarkness. Then, diving silently and swiftly to the floor, he wriggled\nunder the bed. The thud of his head against what appeared to be some\nsort of joist or support, unless it had been placed there by the maker\nas a practical joke, on the chance of this kind of thing happening some\nday, coincided with the creak of the opening door. Then the light\nwas switched on again, and the bulldog in the corner gave a welcoming\nwoofle.\n\n\"And how is mamma's precious angel?\"\n\nRightly concluding that the remark had not been addressed to himself\nand that no social obligation demanded that he reply, Archie pressed\nhis cheek against the boards and said nothing. The question was not\nrepeated, but from the other side of the room came the sound of a patted\ndog.\n\n\"Did he think his muzzer had fallen down dead and was never coming up?\"\n\nThe beautiful picture which these words conjured up filled Archie with\nthat yearning for the might-have-been which is always so painful. He was\nfinding his position physically as well as mentally distressing. It was\ncramped under the bed, and the boards were harder than anything he had\never encountered. Also, it appeared to be the practice of the housemaids\nat the Hotel Hermitage to use the space below the beds as a depository\nfor all the dust which they swept off the carpet, and much of this was\ninsinuating itself into his nose and mouth. The two things which Archie\nwould have liked most to do at that moment were first to kill Miss\nSilverton--if possible, painfully--and then to spend the remainder of\nhis life sneezing.\n\nAfter a prolonged period he heard a drawer open, and noted the fact as\npromising. As the old married man, he presumed that it signified the\nputting away of hair-pins. About now the dashed woman would be looking\nat herself in the glass with her hair down. Then she would brush it.\nThen she would twiddle it up into thingummies. Say, ten minutes for\nthis. And after that she would go to bed and turn out the light, and he\nwould be able, after giving her a bit of time to go to sleep, to creep\nout and leg it. Allowing at a conservative estimate three-quarters of--\n\n\"Come out!\"\n\nArchie stiffened. For an instant a feeble hope came to him that this\nremark, like the others, might be addressed to the dog.\n\n\"Come out from under that bed!\" said a stern voice. \"And mind how you\ncome! I've got a pistol!\"\n\n\"Well, I mean to say, you know,\" said Archie, in a propitiatory voice,\nemerging from his lair like a tortoise and smiling as winningly as a man\ncan who has just bumped his head against the leg of a bed, \"I suppose\nall this seems fairly rummy, but--\"\n\n\"For the love of Mike!\" said Miss Silverton.\n\nThe point seemed to Archie well taken and the comment on the situation\nneatly expressed.\n\n\"What are you doing in my room?\"\n\n\"Well, if it comes to that, you know--shouldn't have mentioned it if you\nhadn't brought the subject up in the course of general chit-chat--what\nare you doing in mine?\"\n\n\"Yours?\"\n\n\"Well, apparently there's been a bloomer of some species somewhere, but\nthis was the room I had last night,\" said Archie.\n\n\"But the desk-clerk said that he had asked you if it would be quite\nsatisfactory to you giving it up to me, and you said yes. I come here\nevery summer, when I'm not working, and I always have this room.\"\n\n\"By Jove! I remember now. The chappie did say something to me about the\nroom, but I was thinking of something else and it rather went over the\ntop. So that's what he was talking about, was it?\"\n\nMiss Silverton was frowning. A moving-picture director, scanning her\nface, would have perceived that she was registering disappointment.\n\n\"Nothing breaks right for me in this darned world,\" she said,\nregretfully. \"When I caught sight of your leg sticking out from under\nthe bed, I did think that everything was all lined up for a real find\nand, at last, I could close my eyes and see the thing in the papers.\nOn the front page, with photographs: 'Plucky Actress Captures Burglar.'\nDarn it!\"\n\n\"Fearfully sorry, you know!\"\n\n\"I just needed something like that. I've got a Press-agent, and I\nwill say for him that he eats well and sleeps well and has just enough\nintelligence to cash his monthly cheque without forgetting what he went\ninto the bank for, but outside of that you can take it from me he's not\none of the world's workers! He's about as much solid use to a girl with\naspirations as a pain in the lower ribs. It's three weeks since he got\nme into print at all, and then the brightest thing he could think up was\nthat my favourite breakfast-fruit was an apple. Well, I ask you!\"\n\n\"Rotten!\" said Archie.\n\n\"I did think that for once my guardian angel had gone back to work\nand was doing something for me. 'Stage Star and Midnight Marauder,'\"\nmurmured Miss Silverton, wistfully. \"'Footlight Favourite Foils Felon.'\"\n\n\"Bit thick!\" agreed Archie, sympathetically. \"Well, you'll probably\nbe wanting to get to bed and all that sort of rot, so I may as well be\npopping, what! Cheerio!\"\n\nA sudden gleam came into Miss Silverton's compelling eyes.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Wait! I've got an idea!\" The wistful sadness had gone from her manner.\nShe was bright and alert. \"Sit down!\"\n\n\"Sit down?\"\n\n\"Sure. Sit down and take the chill off the arm-chair. I've thought of\nsomething.\"\n\nArchie sat down as directed. At his elbow the bulldog eyed him gravely\nfrom the basket.\n\n\"Do they know you in this hotel?\"\n\n\"Know me? Well, I've been here about a week.\"\n\n\"I mean, do they know who you are? Do they know you're a good citizen?\"\n\n\"Well, if it comes to that, I suppose they don't. But--\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Miss Silverton, appreciatively. \"Then it's all right. We\ncan carry on!\"\n\n\"Carry on!\"\n\n\"Why, sure! All I want is to get the thing into the papers. It doesn't\nmatter to me if it turns out later that there was a mistake and that you\nweren't a burglar trying for my jewels after all. It makes just as good\na story either way. I can't think why that never struck me before. Here\nhave I been kicking because you weren't a real burglar, when it doesn't\namount to a hill of beans whether you are or not. All I've got to do\nis to rush out and yell and rouse the hotel, and they come in and pinch\nyou, and I give the story to the papers, and everything's fine!\"\n\nArchie leaped from his chair.\n\n\"I say! What!\"\n\n\"What's on your mind?\" enquired Miss Silverton, considerately. \"Don't\nyou think it's a nifty scheme?\"\n\n\"Nifty! My dear old soul! It's frightful!\"\n\n\"Can't see what's wrong with it,\" grumbled Miss Silverton. \"After I've\nhad someone get New York on the long-distance 'phone and give the\nstory to the papers you can explain, and they'll let you out. Surely to\ngoodness you don't object, as a personal favour to me, to spending an\nhour or two in a cell? Why, probably they haven't got a prison at all\nout in these parts, and you'll simply be locked in a room. A child of\nten could do it on his head,\" said Miss Silverton. \"A child of six,\" she\nemended.\n\n\"But, dash it--I mean--what I mean to say--I'm married!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Miss Silverton, with the politeness of faint interest. \"I've\nbeen married myself. I wouldn't say it's altogether a bad thing, mind\nyou, for those that like it, but a little of it goes a long way. My\nfirst husband,\" she proceeded, reminiscently, \"was a travelling man. I\ngave him a two-weeks' try-out, and then I told him to go on travelling.\nMy second husband--now, HE wasn't a gentleman in any sense of the word.\nI remember once--\"\n\n\"You don't grasp the point. The jolly old point! You fail to grasp it.\nIf this bally thing comes out, my wife will be most frightfully sick!\"\n\nMiss Silverton regarded him with pained surprise.\n\n\"Do you mean to say you would let a little thing like that stand in the\nway of my getting on the front page of all the papers--WITH photographs?\nWhere's your chivalry?\"\n\n\"Never mind my dashed chivalry!\"\n\n\"Besides, what does it matter if she does get a little sore? She'll soon\nget over it. You can put that right. Buy her a box of candy. Not that\nI'm strong for candy myself. What I always say is, it may taste good,\nbut look what it does to your hips! I give you my honest word that, when\nI gave up eating candy, I lost eleven ounces the first week. My second\nhusband--no, I'm a liar, it was my third--my third husband said--Say,\nwhat's the big idea? Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Out!\" said Archie, firmly. \"Bally out!\"\n\nA dangerous light flickered in Miss Silverton's eyes.\n\n\"That'll be all of that!\" she said, raising the pistol. \"You stay right\nwhere you are, or I'll fire!\"\n\n\"Right-o!\"\n\n\"I mean it!\"\n\n\"My dear old soul,\" said Archie, \"in the recent unpleasantness in France\nI had chappies popping off things like that at me all day and every day\nfor close on five years, and here I am, what! I mean to say, if I've\ngot to choose between staying here and being pinched in your room by the\nlocal constabulary and having the dashed thing get into the papers and\nall sorts of trouble happening, and my wife getting the wind up and--I\nsay, if I've got to choose--\"\n\n\"Suck a lozenge and start again!\" said Miss Silverton.\n\n\"Well, what I mean to say is, I'd much rather take a chance of getting a\nbullet in the old bean than that. So loose it off and the best o' luck!\"\n\nMiss Silverton lowered the pistol, sank into a chair, and burst into\ntears.\n\n\"I think you're the meanest man I ever met!\" she sobbed. \"You know\nperfectly well the bang would send me into a fit!\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Archie, relieved, \"cheerio, good luck, pip-pip,\ntoodle-oo, and good-bye-ee! I'll be shifting!\"\n\n\"Yes, you will!\" cried Miss Silverton, energetically, recovering with\namazing swiftness from her collapse. \"Yes, you will, I by no means\nsuppose! You think, just because I'm no champion with a pistol, I'm\nhelpless. You wait! Percy!\"\n\n\"My name is not Percy.\"\n\n\"I never said it was. Percy! Percy, come to muzzer!\"\n\nThere was a creaking rustle from behind the arm-chair. A heavy body\nflopped on the carpet. Out into the room, heaving himself along as\nthough sleep had stiffened his joints, and breathing stertorously\nthrough his tilted nose, moved the fine bulldog. Seen in the open, he\nlooked even more formidable than he had done in his basket.\n\n\"Guard him, Percy! Good dog, guard him! Oh, heavens! What's the matter\nwith him?\"\n\nAnd with these words the emotional woman, uttering a wail of anguish,\nflung herself on the floor beside the animal.\n\nPercy was, indeed, in manifestly bad shape. He seemed quite unable to\ndrag his limbs across the room. There was a curious arch in his back,\nand, as his mistress touched him, he cried out plaintively,\n\n\"Percy! Oh, what IS the matter with him? His nose is burning!\"\n\nNow was the time, with both sections of the enemy's forces occupied, for\nArchie to have departed softly from the room. But never, since the\nday when at the age of eleven he had carried a large, damp, and muddy\nterrier with a sore foot three miles and deposited him on the best sofa\nin his mother's drawing-room, had he been able to ignore the spectacle\nof a dog in trouble.\n\n\"He does look bad, what!\"\n\n\"He's dying! Oh, he's dying! Is it distemper? He's never had distemper.\"\n\nArchie regarded the sufferer with the grave eye of the expert. He shook\nhis head.\n\n\"It's not that,\" he said. \"Dogs with distemper make a sort of snifting\nnoise.\"\n\n\"But he IS making a snifting noise!\"\n\n\"No, he's making a snuffling noise. Great difference between snuffling\nand snifting. Not the same thing at all. I mean to say, when they snift\nthey snift, and when they snuffle they--as it were--snuffle. That's how\nyou can tell. If you ask ME\"--he passed his hand over the dog's back.\nPercy uttered another cry. \"I know what's the matter with him.\"\n\n\"A brute of a man kicked him at rehearsal. Do you think he's injured\ninternally?\"\n\n\"It's rheumatism,\" said Archie. \"Jolly old rheumatism. That's all that's\nthe trouble.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\"\n\n\"Give him a good hot bath, and mind and dry him well. He'll have a good\nsleep then, and won't have any pain. Then, first thing to-morrow, you\nwant to give him salicylate of soda.\"\n\n\"I'll never remember that.\"-\"I'll write it down for you. You ought to\ngive him from ten to twenty grains three times a day in an ounce of\nwater. And rub him with any good embrocation.\"\n\n\"And he won't die?\"\n\n\"Die! He'll live to be as old as you are!-I mean to say--\"\n\n\"I could kiss you!\" said Miss Silverton, emotionally.\n\nArchie backed hastily.\n\n\"No, no, absolutely not! Nothing like that required, really!\"\n\n\"You're a darling!\"\n\n\"Yes. I mean no. No, no, really!\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say. What can I say?\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said Archie.\n\n\"I wish there was something I could do! If you hadn't been here, I\nshould have gone off my head!\"\n\nA great idea flashed across Archie's brain.\n\n\"Do you really want to do something?\"\n\n\"Anything!\"\n\n\"Then I do wish, like a dear sweet soul, you would pop straight back to\nNew York to-morrow and go on with those rehearsals.\"\n\nMiss Silverton shook her head.\n\n\"I can't do that!\"\n\n\"Oh, right-o! But it isn't much to ask, what!\"\n\n\"Not much to ask! I'll never forgive that man for kicking Percy!\"\n\n\"Now listen, dear old soul. You've got the story all wrong. As a matter\nof fact, jolly old Benham told me himself that he has the greatest\nesteem and respect for Percy, and wouldn't have kicked him for the\nworld. And, you know it was more a sort of push than a kick. You might\nalmost call it a light shove. The fact is, it was beastly dark in the\ntheatre, and he was legging it sideways for some reason or other, no\ndoubt with the best motives, and unfortunately he happened to stub his\ntoe on the poor old bean.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't he say so?\"\n\n\"As far as I could make out, you didn't give him a chance.\"\n\nMiss Silverton wavered.\n\n\"I always hate going back after I've walked out on a show,\" she said.\n\"It seems so weak!\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it! They'll give three hearty cheers and think you a\ntopper. Besides, you've got to go to New York in any case. To take Percy\nto a vet., you know, what!\"\n\n\"Of course. How right you always are!\" Miss Silverton hesitated again.\n\"Would you really be glad if I went back to the show?\"\n\n\"I'd go singing about the hotel! Great pal of mine, Benham. A thoroughly\ncheery old bean, and very cut up about the whole affair. Besides, think\nof all the coves thrown out of work--the thingummabobs and the poor\nwhat-d'you-call-'ems!\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"You'll do it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I say, you really are one of the best! Absolutely like mother made!\nThat's fine! Well, I think I'll be saying good night.\"\n\n\"Good night. And thank you so much!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, rather not!\"\n\nArchie moved to the door.\n\n\"Oh, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If I were you, I think I should catch the very first train you can get\nto New York. You see--er--you ought to take Percy to the vet. as soon as\never you can.\"\n\n\"You really do think of everything,\" said Miss Silverton.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Archie, meditatively.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE SAD CASE OF LOONEY BIDDLE\n\n\nArchie was a simple soul, and, as is the case with most simple souls,\ngratitude came easily to him. He appreciated kind treatment. And when,\non the following day, Lucille returned to the Hermitage, all smiles and\naffection, and made no further reference to Beauty's Eyes and the flies\nthat got into them, he was conscious of a keen desire to show some solid\nrecognition of this magnanimity. Few wives, he was aware, could have\nhad the nobility and what not to refrain from occasionally turning the\nconversation in the direction of the above-mentioned topics. It had not\nneeded this behaviour on her part to convince him that Lucille was a\ntopper and a corker and one of the very best, for he had been cognisant\nof these facts since the first moment he had met her: but what he did\nfeel was that she deserved to be rewarded in no uncertain manner. And\nit seemed a happy coincidence to him that her birthday should be coming\nalong in the next week or so. Surely, felt Archie, he could whack up\nsome sort of a not unjuicy gift for that occasion--something pretty ripe\nthat would make a substantial hit with the dear girl. Surely something\nwould come along to relieve his chronic impecuniosity for just\nsufficient length of time to enable him to spread himself on this great\noccasion.\n\nAnd, as if in direct answer to prayer, an almost forgotten aunt in\nEngland suddenly, out of an absolutely blue sky, shot no less a sum than\nfive hundred dollars across the ocean. The present was so lavish and\nunexpected that Archie had the awed feeling of one who participates in\na miracle. He felt, like Herbert Parker, that the righteous was not\nforsaken. It was the sort of thing that restored a fellow's faith in\nhuman nature. For nearly a week he went about in a happy trance: and\nwhen, by thrift and enterprise--that is to say, by betting Reggie van\nTuyl that the New York Giants would win the opening game of the series\nagainst the Pittsburg baseball team--he contrived to double his capital,\nwhat it amounted to was simply that life had nothing more to offer. He\nwas actually in a position to go to a thousand dollars for Lucille's\nbirthday present. He gathered in Mr. van Tuyl, of whose taste in these\nmatters he had a high opinion, and dragged him off to a jeweller's on\nBroadway.\n\nThe jeweller, a stout, comfortable man, leaned on the counter and\nfingered lovingly the bracelet which he had lifted out of its nest of\nblue plush. Archie, leaning on the other side of the counter, inspected\nthe bracelet searchingly, wishing that he knew more about these things;\nfor he had rather a sort of idea that the merchant was scheming to do\nhim in the eyeball. In a chair by his side, Reggie van Tuyl, half asleep\nas usual, yawned despondently. He had permitted Archie to lug him into\nthis shop; and he wanted to buy something and go. Any form of sustained\nconcentration fatigued Reggie.\n\n\"Now this,\" said the jeweller, \"I could do at eight hundred and fifty\ndollars.\"\n\n\"Grab it!\" murmured Mr. van Tuyl.\n\nThe jeweller eyed him approvingly, a man after his own heart; but Archie\nlooked doubtful. It was all very well for Reggie to tell him to grab\nit in that careless way. Reggie was a dashed millionaire, and no doubt\nbought bracelets by the pound or the gross or what not; but he himself\nwas in an entirely different position.\n\n\"Eight hundred and fifty dollars!\" he said, hesitating.\n\n\"Worth it,\" mumbled Reggie van Tuyl.\n\n\"More than worth it,\" amended the jeweller. \"I can assure you that it is\nbetter value than you could get anywhere on Fifth Avenue.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Archie. He took the bracelet and twiddled it thoughtfully.\n\"Well, my dear old jeweller, one can't say fairer than that, can one--or\ntwo, as the case may be!\" He frowned. \"Oh, well, all right! But it's\nrummy that women are so fearfully keen on these little thingummies,\nisn't it? I mean to say, can't see what they see in them. Stones, and\nall that. Still, there, it is, of course!\"\n\n\"There,\" said the jeweller, \"as you say, it is, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, there it is!\"\n\n\"Yes, there it is,\" said the jeweller, \"fortunately for people in my\nline of business. Will you take it with you, sir?\"\n\nArchie reflected.\n\n\"No. No, not take it with me. The fact is, you know, my wife's coming\nback from the country to-night, and it's her birthday to-morrow, and the\nthing's for her, and, if it was popping about the place to-night, she\nmight see it, and it would sort of spoil the surprise. I mean to say,\nshe doesn't know I'm giving it her, and all that!\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Reggie, achieving a certain animation now that the\ntedious business interview was concluded, \"going to the ball-game this\nafternoon--might get pocket picked--yes, better have it sent.\"\n\n\"Where shall I send it, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh, shoot it along to Mrs. Archibald Moffam, at the Cosmopolis. Not\nto-day, you know. Buzz it in first thing to-morrow.\"\n\nHaving completed the satisfactory deal, the jeweller threw off the\nbusiness manner and became chatty.\n\n\"So you are going to the ball-game? It should be an interesting\ncontest.\"\n\nReggie van Tuyl, now--by his own standards--completely awake, took\nexception to this remark.\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" he said, decidedly. \"No contest! Can't call it a\ncontest! Walkover for the Pirates!\"\n\nArchie was stung to the quick. There is that about baseball which\narouses enthusiasm and the partisan spirit in the unlikeliest bosoms. It\nis almost impossible for a man to live in America and not become gripped\nby the game; and Archie had long been one of its warmest adherents.\nHe was a whole-hearted supporter of the Giants, and his only grievance\nagainst Reggie, in other respects an estimable young man, was that the\nlatter, whose money had been inherited from steel-mills in that city,\nhad an absurd regard for the Pirates of Pittsburg.\n\n\"What absolute bally rot!\" he exclaimed. \"Look what the Giants did to\nthem yesterday!\"\n\n\"Yesterday isn't to-day,\" said Reggie.\n\n\"No, it'll be a jolly sight worse,\" said Archie. \"Looney Biddle'll be\npitching for the Giants to-day.\"\n\n\"That's just what I mean. The Pirates have got him rattled. Look what\nhappened last time.\"\n\nArchie understood, and his generous nature chafed at the innuendo.\nLooney Biddle--so-called by an affectionately admiring public as the\nresult of certain marked eccentricities--was beyond dispute the greatest\nleft-handed pitcher New York had possessed in the last decade. But there\nwas one blot on Mr. Biddle's otherwise stainless scutcheon. Five weeks\nbefore, on the occasion of the Giants' invasion of Pittsburg, he had\ngone mysteriously to pieces. Few native-born partisans, brought up to\nbaseball from the cradle, had been plunged into a profounder gloom on\nthat occasion than Archie; but his soul revolted at the thought that\nthat sort of thing could ever happen again.\n\n\"I'm not saying,\" continued Reggie, \"that Biddle isn't a very fair\npitcher, but it's cruel to send him against the Pirates, and somebody\nought to stop it. His best friends should interfere. Once a team gets\na pitcher rattled, he's never any good against them again. He loses his\nnerve.\"\n\nThe jeweller nodded approval of this sentiment.\n\n\"They never come back,\" he said, sententiously.\n\nThe fighting blood of the Moffams was now thoroughly stirred. Archie\neyed his friend sternly. Reggie was a good chap--in many respects an\nextremely sound egg--but he must not be allowed to talk rot of this\ndescription about the greatest left-handed pitcher of the age.\n\n\"It seems to me, old companion,\" he said, \"that a small bet is indicated\nat this juncture. How about it?\"\n\n\"Don't want to take your money.\"\n\n\"You won't have to! In the cool twilight of the merry old summer\nevening I, friend of my youth and companion of my riper years, shall be\ntrousering yours.\"\n\nReggie yawned. The day was very hot, and this argument was making him\nfeel sleepy again.\n\n\"Well, just as you like, of course. Double or quits on yesterday's bet,\nif that suits you.\"\n\nFor a moment Archie hesitated. Firm as his faith was in Mr. Biddle's\nstout left arm, he had not intended to do the thing on quite this\nscale. That thousand dollars of his was earmarked for Lucille's birthday\npresent, and he doubted whether he ought to risk it. Then the thought\nthat the honour of New York was in his hands decided him. Besides, the\nrisk was negligible. Betting on Looney Biddle was like betting on the\nprobable rise of the sun in the east. The thing began to seem to Archie\na rather unusually sound and conservative investment. He remembered that\nthe jeweller, until he drew him firmly but kindly to earth and urged\nhim to curb his exuberance and talk business on a reasonable plane, had\nstarted brandishing bracelets that cost about two thousand. There would\nbe time to pop in at the shop this evening after the game and change the\none he had selected for one of those. Nothing was too good for Lucille\non her birthday.\n\n\"Right-o!\" he said. \"Make it so, old friend!\"\n\nArchie walked back to the Cosmopolis. No misgivings came to mar his\nperfect contentment. He felt no qualms about separating Reggie from\nanother thousand dollars. Except for a little small change in the\npossession of the Messrs. Rockefeller and Vincent Astor, Reggie had all\nthe money in the world and could afford to lose. He hummed a gay air\nas he entered the lobby and crossed to the cigar-stand to buy a few\ncigarettes to see him through the afternoon.\n\nThe girl behind the cigar counter welcomed him with a bright smile.\nArchie was popular with all the employes of the Cosmopolis.\n\n\"'S a great day, Mr. Moffam!\"\n\n\"One of the brightest and best,\" Agreed Archie. \"Could you dig me out\ntwo, or possibly three, cigarettes of the usual description? I shall\nwant something to smoke at the ball-game.\"\n\n\"You going to the ball-game?\"\n\n\"Rather! Wouldn't miss it for a fortune.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Absolutely no! Not with jolly old Biddle pitching.\"\n\nThe cigar-stand girl laughed amusedly.\n\n\"Is he pitching this afternoon? Say, that feller's a nut? D'you know\nhim?\"\n\n\"Know him? Well, I've seen him pitch and so forth.\"\n\n\"I've got a girl friend who's engaged to him!\"\n\nArchie looked at her with positive respect. It would have been more\ndramatic, of course, if she had been engaged to the great man herself,\nbut still the mere fact that she had a girl friend in that astounding\nposition gave her a sort of halo.\n\n\"No, really!\" he said. \"I say, by Jove, really! Fancy that!\"\n\n\"Yes, she's engaged to him all right. Been engaged close on a coupla\nmonths now.\"\n\n\"I say! That's frightfully interesting! Fearfully interesting, really!\"\n\n\"It's funny about that guy,\" said the cigar-stand girl. \"He's a nut!\nThe fellow who said there's plenty of room at the top must have been\nthinking of Gus Biddle's head! He's crazy about m' girl friend, y' know,\nand, whenever they have a fuss, it seems like he sort of flies right off\nthe handle.\"\n\n\"Goes in off the deep end, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, SIR! Loses what little sense he's got. Why, the last time him and\nm' girl friend got to scrapping was when he was going on to Pittsburg\nto play, about a month ago. He'd been out with her the day he left for\nthere, and he had a grouch or something, and he started making low,\nsneaky cracks about her Uncle Sigsbee. Well, m' girl friend's got a nice\ndisposition, but she c'n get mad, and she just left him flat and told\nhim all was over. And he went off to Pittsburg, and, when he started in\nto pitch the opening game, he just couldn't keep his mind on his\njob, and look what them assassins done to him! Five runs in the first\ninnings! Yessir, he's a nut all right!\"\n\nArchie was deeply concerned. So this was the explanation of that\nmysterious disaster, that weird tragedy which had puzzled the sporting\npress from coast to coast.\n\n\"Good God! Is he often taken like that?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's all right when he hasn't had a fuss with m' girl friend,\" said\nthe cigar-stand girl, indifferently. Her interest in baseball was tepid.\nWomen are too often like this--mere butterflies, with no concern for the\ndeeper side of life.\n\n\"Yes, but I say! What I mean to say, you know! Are they pretty pally\nnow? The good old Dove of Peace flapping its little wings fairly briskly\nand all that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess everything's nice and smooth just now. I seen m' girl\nfriend yesterday, and Gus was taking her to the movies last night, so I\nguess everything's nice and smooth.\"\n\nArchie breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Took her to the movies, did he? Stout fellow!\"\n\n\"I was at the funniest picture last week,\" said the cigar-stand girl.\n\"Honest, it was a scream! It was like this--\"\n\nArchie listened politely; then went in to get a bite of lunch. His\nequanimity, shaken by the discovery of the rift in the peerless one's\narmour, was restored. Good old Biddle had taken the girl to the movies\nlast night. Probably he had squeezed her hand a goodish bit in the dark.\nWith what result? Why, the fellow would be feeling like one of those\nchappies who used to joust for the smiles of females in the Middle Ages.\nWhat he meant to say, presumably the girl would be at the game this\nafternoon, whooping him on, and good old Biddle would be so full of\nbeans and buck that there would be no holding him.\n\nEncouraged by these thoughts, Archie lunched with an untroubled mind.\nLuncheon concluded, he proceeded to the lobby to buy back his hat and\nstick from the boy brigand with whom he had left them. It was while he\nwas conducting this financial operation that he observed that at the\ncigar-stand, which adjoined the coat-and-hat alcove, his friend behind\nthe counter had become engaged in conversation with another girl.\n\nThis was a determined looking young woman in a blue dress and a large\nhat of a bold and flowery species, Archie happening to attract her\nattention, she gave him a glance out of a pair of fine brown eyes, then,\nas if she did not think much of him, turned to her companion and resumed\ntheir conversation--which, being of an essentially private and intimate\nnature, she conducted, after the manner of her kind, in a ringing\nsoprano which penetrated into every corner of the lobby. Archie,\nwaiting while the brigand reluctantly made change for a dollar bill, was\nprivileged to hear every word.\n\n\"Right from the start I seen he was in a ugly mood. YOU know how he\ngets, dearie! Chewing his upper lip and looking at you as if you were\nso much dirt beneath his feet! How was _I_ to know he'd lost fifteen\ndollars fifty-five playing poker, and anyway, I don't see where he gets\na licence to work off his grouches on me. And I told him so. I said to\nhim, 'Gus,' I said, 'if you can't be bright and smiling and cheerful\nwhen you take me out, why do you come round at all? Was I wrong or\nright, dearie?\"\n\nThe girl behind the counter heartily endorsed her conduct. \"Once you let\na man think he could use you as a door-mat, where were you?\"\n\n\"What happened then, honey?\"\n\n\"Well, after that we went to the movies.\"\n\nArchie started convulsively. The change from his dollar-bill leaped in\nhis hand. Some of it sprang overboard and tinkled across the floor, with\nthe brigand in pursuit. A monstrous suspicion had begun, to take root in\nhis mind.\n\n\"Well, we got good seats, but--well, you know how it is, once things\nstart going wrong. You know that hat of mine, the one with the daisies\nand cherries and the feather--I'd taken it off and given it him to hold\nwhen we went in, and what do you think that fell'r'd done? Put it on the\nfloor and crammed it under the seat, just to save himself the trouble of\nholding it on his lap! And, when I showed him I was upset, all he said\nwas that he was a pitcher and not a hatstand!\"\n\nArchie was paralysed. He paid no attention to the hat-check boy, who\nwas trying to induce him to accept treasure-trove to the amount of\nforty-five cents. His whole being was concentrated on this frightful\ntragedy which had burst upon him like a tidal wave. No possible room for\ndoubt remained. \"Gus\" was the only Gus in New York that mattered, and\nthis resolute and injured female before him was the Girl Friend, in\nwhose slim hands rested the happiness of New York's baseball followers,\nthe destiny of the unconscious Giants, and the fate of his thousand\ndollars. A strangled croak proceeded from his parched lips.\n\n\"Well, I didn't say anything at the moment. It just shows how them\nmovies can work on a girl's feelings. It was a Bryant Washburn film, and\nsomehow, whenever I see him on the screen, nothing else seems to matter.\nI just get that goo-ey feeling, and couldn't start a fight if you asked\nme to. So we go off to have a soda, and I said to him, 'That sure was a\nlovely film, Gus!' and would you believe me, he says straight out that\nhe didn't think it was such a much, and he thought Bryant Washburn was a\npill! A pill!\" The Girl Friend's penetrating voice shook with emotion.\n\n\"He never!\" exclaimed the shocked cigar-stand girl.\n\n\"He did, if I die the next moment! I wasn't more than half-way through\nmy vanilla and maple, but I got up without a word and left him. And I\nain't seen a sight of him since. So there you are, dearie! Was I right\nor wrong?\"\n\nThe cigar-stand girl gave unqualified approval. What men like Gus Biddle\nneeded for the salvation of their souls was an occasional good jolt\nright where it would do most good.\n\n\"I'm glad you think I acted right, dearie,\" said the Girl Friend. \"I\nguess I've been too weak with Gus, and he's took advantage of it. I\ns'pose I'll have to forgive him one of these old days, but, believe me,\nit won't be for a week.\"\n\nThe cigar-stand girl was in favour of a fortnight.\n\n\"No,\" said the Girl Friend, regretfully. \"I don't believe I could hold\nout that long. But, if I speak to him inside a week, well--! Well, I\ngotta be going. Goodbye, honey.\"\n\nThe cigar-stand girl turned to attend to an impatient customer, and the\nGirl Friend, walking with the firm and decisive steps which indicate\ncharacter, made for the swing-door leading to the street. And as she\nwent, the paralysis which had pipped Archie released its hold. Still\nignoring the forty-five cents which the boy continued to proffer, he\nleaped in her wake like a panther and came upon her just as she was\nstepping into a car. The car was full, but not too full for Archie. He\ndropped his five cents into the box and reached for a vacant strap.\nHe looked down upon the flowered hat. There she was. And there he was.\nArchie rested his left ear against the forearm of a long, strongly-built\nyoung man in a grey suit who had followed him into the car and was\nsharing his strap, and pondered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. SUMMER STORMS\n\n\nOf course, in a way, the thing was simple. The wheeze was, in a sense,\nstraightforward and uncomplicated. What he wanted to do was to point out\nto the injured girl all that hung on her. He wished to touch her\nheart, to plead with her, to desire her to restate her war-aims, and to\npersuade her--before three o'clock when that stricken gentleman would be\nstepping into the pitcher's box to loose off the first ball against\nthe Pittsburg Pirates--to let bygones be bygones and forgive Augustus\nBiddle. But the blighted problem was, how the deuce to find the\nopportunity to start. He couldn't yell at the girl in a crowded\nstreet-car; and, if he let go of his strap and bent over her, somebody\nwould step on his neck.\n\nThe Girl Friend, who for the first five minutes had remained entirely\nconcealed beneath her hat, now sought diversion by looking up and\nexamining the faces of the upper strata of passengers. Her eye caught\nArchie's in a glance of recognition, and he smiled feebly, endeavouring\nto register bonhomie and good-will. He was surprised to see a startled\nexpression come into her brown eyes. Her face turned pink. At least, it\nwas pink already, but it turned pinker. The next moment, the car having\nstopped to pick up more passengers, she jumped off and started to hurry\nacross the street.\n\nArchie was momentarily taken aback. When embarking on this business\nhe had never intended it to become a blend of otter-hunting and a\nmoving-picture chase. He followed her off the car with a sense that his\ngrip on the affair was slipping. Preoccupied with these thoughts, he\ndid not perceive that the long young man who had shared his strap had\nalighted too. His eyes were fixed on the vanishing figure of the Girl\nFriend, who, having buzzed at a smart pace into Sixth Avenue, was now\nlegging it in the direction of the staircase leading to one of the\nstations of the Elevated Railroad. Dashing up the stairs after her,\nhe shortly afterwards found himself suspended as before from a strap,\ngazing upon the now familiar flowers on top of her hat. From another\nstrap farther down the carriage swayed the long young man in the grey\nsuit.\n\nThe train rattled on. Once or twice, when it stopped, the girl seemed\nundecided whether to leave or remain. She half rose, then sank back\nagain. Finally she walked resolutely out of the car, and Archie,\nfollowing, found himself in a part of New York strange to him. The\ninhabitants of this district appeared to eke out a precarious existence,\nnot by taking in one another's washing, but by selling one another\nsecond-hand clothes.\n\nArchie glanced at his watch. He had lunched early, but so crowded with\nemotions had been the period following lunch that he was surprised to\nfind that the hour was only just two. The discovery was a pleasant one.\nWith a full hour before the scheduled start of the game, much might be\nachieved. He hurried after the girl, and came up with her just as she\nturned the corner into one of those forlorn New York side-streets which\nare populated chiefly by children, cats, desultory loafers, and empty\nmeat-tins.\n\nThe girl stopped and turned. Archie smiled a winning smile.\n\n\"I say, my dear sweet creature!\" he said. \"I say, my dear old thing, one\nmoment!\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" said the Girl Friend.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\nArchie began to feel certain tremors. Her eyes were gleaming, and her\ndetermined mouth had become a perfectly straight line of scarlet. It was\ngoing to be difficult to be chatty to this girl. She was going to be a\nhard audience. Would mere words be able to touch her heart? The thought\nsuggested itself that, properly speaking, one would need to use a\npick-axe.\n\n\"If you could spare me a couples of minutes of your valuable time--\"\n\n\"Say!\" The lady drew herself up menacingly. \"You tie a can to yourself\nand disappear! Fade away, or I'll call a cop!\"\n\nArchie was horrified at this misinterpretation of his motives. One or\ntwo children, playing close at hand, and a loafer who was trying to\nkeep the wall from falling down, seemed pleased. Theirs was a colourless\nexistence and to the rare purple moments which had enlivened it in the\npast the calling of a cop had been the unfailing preliminary. The loafer\nnudged a fellow-loafer, sunning himself against the same wall. The\nchildren, abandoning the meat-tin round which their game had centred,\ndrew closer.\n\n\"My dear old soul!\" said Archie. \"You don't understand!\"\n\n\"Don't I! I know your sort, you trailing arbutus!\"\n\n\"No, no! My dear old thing, believe me! I wouldn't dream!\"\n\n\"Are you going or aren't you?\"\n\nEleven more children joined the ring of spectators. The loafers stared\nsilently, like awakened crocodiles.\n\n\"But, I say, listen! I only wanted--\"\n\nAt this point another voice spoke.\n\n\"Say!\"\n\nThe word \"Say!\" more almost than any word in the American language, is\ncapable of a variety of shades of expression. It can be genial, it can\nbe jovial, it can be appealing. It can also be truculent The \"Say!\"\nwhich at this juncture smote upon Archie's ear-drum with a suddenness\nwhich made him leap in the air was truculent; and the two loafers and\ntwenty-seven children who now formed the audience were well satisfied\nwith the dramatic development of the performance. To their experienced\nears the word had the right ring.\n\nArchie spun round. At his elbow stood a long, strongly-built young man\nin a grey suit.\n\n\"Well!\" said the young man, nastily. And he extended a large, freckled\nface toward Archie's. It seemed to the latter, as he backed against the\nwall, that the young man's neck must be composed of india-rubber. It\nappeared to be growing longer every moment. His face, besides being\nfreckled, was a dull brick-red in colour; his lips curled back in an\nunpleasant snarl, showing a gold tooth; and beside him, swaying in an\nominous sort of way, hung two clenched red hands about the size of two\nyoung legs of mutton. Archie eyed him with a growing apprehension. There\nare moments in life when, passing idly on our way, we see a strange\nface, look into strange eyes, and with a sudden glow of human warmth\nsay to ourselves, \"We have found a friend!\" This was not one of those\nmoments. The only person Archie had ever seen in his life who looked\nless friendly was the sergeant-major who had trained him in the early\ndays of the war, before he had got his commission.\n\n\"I've had my eye on you!\" said the young man.\n\nHe still had his eye on him. It was a hot, gimlet-like eye, and it\npierced the recesses of Archie's soul. He backed a little farther\nagainst the wall.\n\nArchie was frankly disturbed. He was no poltroon, and had proved the\nfact on many occasions during the days when the entire German army\nseemed to be picking on him personally, but he hated and shrank from\nanything in the nature of a bally public scene.\n\n\"What,\" enquired the young man, still bearing the burden of the\nconversation, and shifting his left hand a little farther behind his\nback, \"do you mean by following this young lady?\"\n\nArchie was glad he had asked him. This was precisely what he wanted to\nexplain.\n\n\"My dear old lad--\" he began.\n\nIn spite of the fact that he had asked a question and presumably desired\na reply, the sound of Archie's voice seemed to be more than the young\nman could endure. It deprived him of the last vestige of restraint. With\na rasping snarl he brought his left fist round in a sweeping semicircle\nin the direction of Archie's head.\n\nArchie was no novice in the art of self-defence. Since his early days at\nschool he had learned much from leather-faced professors of the science.\nHe had been watching this unpleasant young man's eyes with close\nattention, and the latter could not have indicated his scheme of action\nmore clearly if he had sent him a formal note. Archie saw the swing all\nthe way. He stepped nimbly aside, and the fist crashed against the wall.\nThe young man fell back with a yelp of anguish.\n\n\"Gus!\" screamed the Girl Friend, bounding forward.\n\nShe flung her arms round the injured man, who was ruefully examining\na hand which, always of an out-size, was now swelling to still further\ndimensions.\n\n\"Gus, darling!\"\n\nA sudden chill gripped Archie. So engrossed had he been with his mission\nthat it had never occurred to him that the love-lorn pitcher might have\ntaken it into his head to follow the girl as well in the hope of putting\nin a word for himself. Yet such apparently had been the case. Well, this\nhad definitely torn it. Two loving hearts were united again in complete\nreconciliation, but a fat lot of good that was. It would be days before\nthe misguided Looney Biddle would be able to pitch with a hand like\nthat. It looked like a ham already, and was still swelling. Probably the\nwrist was sprained. For at least a week the greatest left-handed pitcher\nof his time would be about as much use to the Giants in any professional\ncapacity as a cold in the head. And on that crippled hand depended the\nfate of all the money Archie had in the world. He wished now that he\nhad not thwarted the fellow's simple enthusiasm. To have had his head\nknocked forcibly through a brick wall would not have been pleasant, but\nthe ultimate outcome would not have been as unpleasant as this. With a\nheavy heart Archie prepared to withdraw, to be alone with his sorrow.\n\nAt this moment, however, the Girl Friend, releasing her wounded lover,\nmade a sudden dash for him, with the plainest intention of blotting him\nfrom the earth.\n\n\"No, I say! Really!\" said Archie, bounding backwards. \"I mean to say!\"\n\nIn a series of events, all of which had been a bit thick, this, in his\nopinion, achieved the maximum of thickness. It was the extreme ragged,\noutside edge of the limit. To brawl with a fellow-man in a public street\nhad been bad, but to be brawled with by a girl--the shot was not on the\nboard. Absolutely not on the board. There was only one thing to be done.\nIt was dashed undignified, no doubt, for a fellow to pick up the old\nwaukeesis and leg it in the face of the enemy, but there was no other\ncourse. Archie started to run; and, as he did so, one of the loafers\nmade the mistake of gripping him by the collar of his coat.\n\n\"I got him!\" observed the loafer.-There is a time for all things. This\nwas essentially not the time for anyone of the male sex to grip the\ncollar of Archie's coat. If a syndicate of Dempsey, Carpentier, and one\nof the Zoo gorillas had endeavoured to stay his progress at that moment,\nthey would have had reason to consider it a rash move. Archie wanted to\nbe elsewhere, and the blood of generations of Moffams, many of whom\nhad swung a wicked axe in the free-for-all mix-ups of the Middle Ages,\nboiled within him at any attempt to revise his plans. There was a\ngood deal of the loafer, but it was all soft. Releasing his hold when\nArchie's heel took him shrewdly on the shin, he received a nasty punch\nin what would have been the middle of his waistcoat if he had worn one,\nuttered a gurgling bleat like a wounded sheep, and collapsed against the\nwall. Archie, with a torn coat, rounded the corner, and sprinted down\nNinth Avenue.\n\nThe suddenness of the move gave him an initial advantage. He was halfway\ndown the first block before the vanguard of the pursuit poured out of\nthe side street. Continuing to travel well, he skimmed past a large dray\nwhich had pulled up across the road, and moved on. The noise of those\nwho pursued was loud and clamorous in the rear, but the dray hid him\nmomentarily from their sight, and it was this fact which led Archie, the\nold campaigner, to take his next step.\n\nIt was perfectly obvious--he was aware of this even in the novel\nexcitement of the chase--that a chappie couldn't hoof it at twenty-five\nmiles an hour indefinitely along a main thoroughfare of a great city\nwithout exciting remark. He must take cover. Cover! That was the wheeze.\nHe looked about him for cover.\n\n\"You want a nice suit?\"\n\nIt takes a great deal to startle your commercial New Yorker. The small\ntailor, standing in his doorway, seemed in no way surprised at the\nspectacle of Archie, whom he had seen pass at a conventional walk some\nfive minutes before, returning like this at top speed. He assumed that\nArchie had suddenly remembered that he wanted to buy something.\n\nThis was exactly what Archie had done. More than anything else in the\nworld, what he wanted to do now was to get into that shop and have a\nlong talk about gents' clothing. Pulling himself up abruptly, he shot\npast the small tailor into the dim interior. A confused aroma of cheap\nclothing greeted him. Except for a small oasis behind a grubby counter,\npractically all the available space was occupied by suits. Stiff suits,\nlooking like the body when discovered by the police, hung from hooks.\nLimp suits, with the appearance of having swooned from exhaustion, lay\nabout on chairs and boxes. The place was a cloth morgue, a Sargasso Sea\nof serge.\n\nArchie would not have had it otherwise. In these quiet groves of\nclothing a regiment could have lain hid.\n\n\"Something nifty in tweeds?\" enquired the business-like proprietor of\nthis haven, following him amiably into the shop, \"Or, maybe, yes, a nice\nserge? Say, mister, I got a sweet thing in blue serge that'll fit you\nlike the paper on the wall!\"\n\nArchie wanted to talk about clothes, but not yet.\n\n\"I say, laddie,\" he said, hurriedly. \"Lend me, your ear for half a\njiffy!\" Outside the baying of the pack had become imminent. \"Stow me\naway for a moment in the undergrowth, and I'll buy anything you want.\"\n\nHe withdrew into the jungle. The noise outside grew in volume. The\npursuit had been delayed for a priceless few instants by the arrival of\nanother dray, moving northwards, which had drawn level with the first\ndray and dexterously bottled up the fairway. This obstacle had now been\novercome, and the original searchers, their ranks swelled by a few dozen\nmore of the leisured classes, were hot on the trail again.\n\n\"You done a murder?\" enquired the voice of the proprietor, mildly\ninterested, filtering through a wall of cloth. \"Well, boys will be\nboys!\" he said, philosophically. \"See anything there that you like?\nThere some sweet things there!\"\n\n\"I'm inspecting them narrowly,\" replied Archie. \"If you don't let those\nchappies find me, I shouldn't be surprised if I bought one.\"\n\n\"One?\" said the proprietor, with a touch of austerity.\n\n\"Two,\" said Archie, quickly. \"Or possibly three or six.\"\n\nThe proprietor's cordiality returned.\n\n\"You can't have too many nice suits,\" he said, approvingly, \"not a young\nfeller like you that wants to look nice. All the nice girls like a\nyoung feller that dresses nice. When you go out of here in a suit I got\nhanging up there at the back, the girls 'll be all over you like flies\nround a honey-pot.\"\n\n\"Would you mind,\" said Archie, \"would you mind, as a personal favour to\nme, old companion, not mentioning that word 'girls'?\"\n\nHe broke off. A heavy foot had crossed the threshold of the shop.\n\n\"Say, uncle,\" said a deep voice, one of those beastly voices that only\nthe most poisonous blighters have, \"you seen a young feller run past\nhere?\"\n\n\"Young feller?\" The proprietor appeared to reflect. \"Do you mean a young\nfeller in blue, with a Homburg hat?\"\n\n\"That's the duck! We lost him. Where did he go?\"\n\n\"Him! Why, he come running past, quick as he could go. I wondered what\nhe was running for, a hot day like this. He went round the corner at the\nbottom of the block.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Well, I guess he's got away,\" said the voice, regretfully.\n\n\"The way he was travelling,\" agreed the proprietor, \"I wouldn't be\nsurprised if he was in Europe by this. You want a nice suit?\"\n\nThe other, curtly expressing a wish that the proprietor would go to\neternal perdition and take his entire stock with him, stumped out.\n\n\"This,\" said the proprietor, tranquilly, burrowing his way to where\nArchie stood and exhibiting a saffron-coloured outrage, which appeared\nto be a poor relation of the flannel family, \"would put you back fifty\ndollars. And cheap!\"\n\n\"Fifty dollars!\"\n\n\"Sixty, I said. I don't speak always distinct.\"\n\nArchie regarded the distressing garment with a shuddering horror. A\nyoung man with an educated taste in clothes, it got right in among his\nnerve centres.\n\n\"But, honestly, old soul, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but that\nisn't a suit, it's just a regrettable incident!\"\n\nThe proprietor turned to the door in a listening attitude.\n\n\"I believe I hear that feller coming back,\" he said.\n\nArchie gulped.\n\n\"How about trying it on?\" he said. \"I'm not sure, after all, it isn't\nfairly ripe.\"\n\n\"That's the way to talk,\" said the proprietor, cordially. \"You try it\non. You can't judge a suit, not a real nice suit like this, by looking\nat it. You want to put it on. There!\" He led the way to a dusty\nmirror at the back of the shop. \"Isn't that a bargain at seventy\ndollars?...Why, say, your mother would be proud if she could see her boy\nnow!\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the proprietor, lovingly kneading a little\nsheaf of currency bills, eyed with a fond look the heap of clothes which\nlay on the counter.\n\n\"As nice a little lot as I've ever had in my shop!\" Archie did not deny\nthis. It was, he thought, probably only too true.\n\n\"I only wish I could see you walking up Fifth Avenue in them!\"\nrhapsodised the proprietor. \"You'll give 'em a treat! What you going\nto do with 'em? Carry 'em under your arm?\" Archie shuddered strongly.\n\"Well, then, I can send 'em for you anywhere you like. It's all the same\nto me. Where'll I send 'em?\"\n\nArchie meditated. The future was black enough as it was. He shrank from\nthe prospect of being confronted next day, at the height of his misery,\nwith these appalling reach-me-downs.\n\nAn idea struck him.\n\n\"Yes, send 'em,\" he said.\n\n\"What's the name and address?\"\n\n\"Daniel Brewster,\" said Archie, \"Hotel Cosmopolis.\"\n\nIt was a long time since he had given his father-in-law a present.\n\nArchie went out into the street, and began to walk pensively down a now\npeaceful Ninth Avenue. Out of the depths that covered him, black as the\npit from pole to pole, no single ray of hope came to cheer him. He could\nnot, like the poet, thank whatever gods there be for his unconquerable\nsoul, for his soul was licked to a splinter. He felt alone and\nfriendless in a rotten world. With the best intentions, he had succeeded\nonly in landing himself squarely amongst the ribstons. Why had he not\nbeen content with his wealth, instead of risking it on that blighted bet\nwith Reggie? Why had he trailed the Girl Friend, dash her! He might have\nknown that he would only make an ass of himself, And, because he had\ndone so, Looney Biddle's left hand, that priceless left hand before\nwhich opposing batters quailed and wilted, was out of action, resting in\na sling, careened like a damaged battleship; and any chance the Giants\nmight have had of beating the Pirates was gone--gone--as surely as\nthat thousand dollars which should have bought a birthday present for\nLucille.\n\nA birthday present for Lucille! He groaned in bitterness of spirit.\nShe would be coming back to-night, dear girl, all smiles and happiness,\nwondering what he was going to give her tomorrow. And when to-morrow\ndawned, all he would be able to give her would be a kind smile. A nice\nstate of things! A jolly situation! A thoroughly good egg, he did NOT\nthink!\n\nIt seemed to Archie that Nature, contrary to her usual custom of\nindifference to human suffering, was mourning with him. The sky\nwas overcast, and the sun had ceased to shine. There was a sort of\nsombreness in the afternoon, which fitted in with his mood. And then\nsomething splashed on his face.\n\nIt says much for Archie's pre-occupation that his first thought, as,\nafter a few scattered drops, as though the clouds were submitting\nsamples for approval, the whole sky suddenly began to stream like a\nshower-bath, was that this was simply an additional infliction which he\nwas called upon to bear, On top of all his other troubles he would get\nsoaked to the skin or have to hang about in some doorway. He cursed\nrichly, and sped for shelter.\n\nThe rain was setting about its work in earnest. The world was full of\nthat rending, swishing sound which accompanies the more violent summer\nstorms. Thunder crashed, and lightning flicked out of the grey heavens.\nOut in the street the raindrops bounded up off the stones like fairy\nfountains. Archie surveyed them morosely from his refuge in the entrance\nof a shop.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, like one of those flashes which were lighting up the\ngloomy sky, a thought lit up his mind.\n\n\"By Jove! If this keeps up, there won't be a ball-game to-day!\"\n\nWith trembling fingers he pulled out his watch. The hands pointed to\nfive minutes to three. A blessed vision came to him of a moist and\ndisappointed crowd receiving rain-checks up at the Polo Grounds.\n\n\"Switch it on, you blighters!\" he cried, addressing the leaden clouds.\n\"Switch it on more and more!\"\n\nIt was shortly before five o'clock that a young man bounded into a\njeweller's shop near the Hotel Cosmopolis--a young man who, in spite of\nthe fact that his coat was torn near the collar and that he oozed\nwater from every inch of his drenched clothes, appeared in the highest\nspirits.. It was only when he spoke that the jeweller recognised in\nthe human sponge the immaculate youth who had looked in that morning to\norder a bracelet.\n\n\"I say, old lad,\" said this young man, \"you remember that jolly little\nwhat-not you showed me before lunch?\"\n\n\"The bracelet, sir?\"\n\n\"As you observe with a manly candour which does you credit, my dear\nold jeweller, the bracelet. Well, produce, exhibit, and bring it forth,\nwould you mind? Trot it out! Slip it across on a lordly dish!\"\n\n\"You wished me, surely, to put it aside and send it to the Cosmopolis\nto-morrow?\"\n\nThe young man tapped the jeweller earnestly on his substantial chest.\n\n\"What I wished and what I wish now are two bally separate and dashed\ndistinct things, friend of my college days! Never put off till to-morrow\nwhat you can do to-day, and all that! I'm not taking any more chances.\nNot for me! For others, yes, but not for Archibald! Here are the\ndoubloons, produce the jolly bracelet Thanks!\"\n\nThe jeweller counted the notes with the same unction which Archie\nhad observed earlier in the day in the proprietor of the second-hand\nclothes-shop. The process made him genial.\n\n\"A nasty, wet day, sir, it's been,\" he observed, chattily.\n\nArchie shook his head.\n\n\"Old friend,\" he said, \"you're all wrong. Far otherwise, and not a bit\nlike it, my dear old trafficker in gems! You've put your finger on\nthe one aspect of this blighted p.m. that really deserves credit and\nrespect. Rarely in the experience of a lifetime have I encountered a day\nso absolutely bally in nearly every shape and form, but there was one\nthing that saved it, and that was its merry old wetness! Toodle-oo,\nladdie!\"\n\n\"Good evening, sir,\" said the jeweller.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. ARCHIE ACCEPTS A SITUATION\n\n\nLucille moved her wrist slowly round, the better to examine the new\nbracelet.\n\n\"You really are an angel, angel!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Like it?\" said Archie complacently.\n\n\"LIKE it! Why, it's gorgeous! It must have cost a fortune.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing to speak of. Just a few hard-earned pieces of eight. Just a\nfew doubloons from the old oak chest.\"\n\n\"But I didn't know there were any doubloons in the old oak chest.\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact,\" admitted Archie, \"at one point in the\nproceedings there weren't. But an aunt of mine in England--peace be\non her head!--happened to send me a chunk of the necessary at what you\nmight call the psychological moment.\"\n\n\"And you spent it all on a birthday present for me! Archie!\" Lucille\ngazed at her husband adoringly. \"Archie, do you know what I think?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You're the perfect man!\"\n\n\"No, really! What ho!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucille firmly. \"I've long suspected it, and now I know. I\ndon't think there's anybody like you in the world.\"\n\nArchie patted her hand.\n\n\"It's a rummy thing,\" he observed, \"but your father said almost exactly\nthat to me only yesterday. Only I don't fancy he meant the same as you.\nTo be absolutely frank, his exact expression was that he thanked God\nthere was only one of me.\"\n\nA troubled look came into Lucille's grey eyes.\n\n\"It's a shame about father. I do wish he appreciated you. But you\nmustn't be too hard on him.\"\n\n\"Me?\" said Archie. \"Hard on your father? Well, dash it all, I don't\nthink I treat him with what you might call actual brutality, what! I\nmean to say, my whole idea is rather to keep out of the old lad's way\nand curl up in a ball if I can't dodge him. I'd just as soon be hard on\na stampeding elephant! I wouldn't for the world say anything derogatory,\nas it were, to your jolly old pater, but there is no getting away from\nthe fact that he's by way of being one of our leading man-eating fishes.\nIt would be idle to deny that he considers that you let down the proud\nold name of Brewster a bit when you brought me in and laid me on the\nmat.\"\n\n\"Anyone would be lucky to get you for a son-in-law, precious.\"\n\n\"I fear me, light of my life, the dad doesn't see eye to eye with you\non that point. No, every time I get hold of a daisy, I give him another\nchance, but it always works out at 'He loves me not!'\"\n\n\"You must make allowances for him, darling.\"\n\n\"Right-o! But I hope devoutly that he doesn't catch me at it. I've a\nsort of idea that if the old dad discovered that I was making allowances\nfor him, he would have from ten to fifteen fits.\"\n\n\"He's worried just now, you know.\"\n\n\"I didn't know. He doesn't confide in me much.\"\n\n\"He's worried about that waiter.\"\n\n\"What waiter, queen of my soul?\"\n\n\"A man called Salvatore. Father dismissed him some time ago.\"\n\n\"Salvatore!\"\n\n\"Probably you don't remember him. He used to wait on this table.\"\n\n\"Why--\"\n\n\"And father dismissed him, apparently, and now there's all sorts of\ntrouble. You see, father wants to build this new hotel of his, and he\nthought he'd got the site and everything and could start building right\naway: and now he finds that this man Salvatore's mother owns a little\nnewspaper and tobacco shop right in the middle of the site, and there's\nno way of getting him out without buying the shop, and he won't sell. At\nleast, he's made his mother promise that she won't sell.\"\n\n\"A boy's best friend is his mother,\" said Archie approvingly. \"I had a\nsort of idea all along--\"\n\n\"So father's in despair.\"\n\nArchie drew at his cigarette meditatively.\n\n\"I remember a chappie--a policeman he was, as a matter of fact, and\nincidentally a fairly pronounced blighter--remarking to me some time\nago that you could trample on the poor man's face but you mustn't be\nsurprised if he bit you in the leg while you were doing it. Apparently\nthis is what has happened to the old dad. I had a sort of idea all along\nthat old friend Salvatore would come out strong in the end if you only\ngave him time. Brainy sort of feller! Great pal of mine.\"-Lucille's\nsmall face lightened. She gazed at Archie with proud affection. She\nfelt that she ought to have known that he was the one to solve this\ndifficulty.\n\n\"You're wonderful, darling! Is he really a friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Many's the time he and I have chatted in this very\ngrill-room.\"\n\n\"Then it's all right. If you went to him and argued with him, he would\nagree to sell the shop, and father would be happy. Think how grateful\nfather would be to you! It would make all the difference.\"\n\nArchie turned this over in his mind.\n\n\"Something in that,\" he agreed.\n\n\"It would make him see what a pet lambkin you really are!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Archie, \"I'm bound to say that any scheme which what you\nmight call culminates in your father regarding me as a pet lambkin ought\nto receive one's best attention. How much did he offer Salvatore for his\nshop?\"\n\n\"I don't know. There is father.--Call him over and ask him.\"\n\nArchie glanced over to where Mr. Brewster had sunk moodily into a chair\nat a neighbouring table. It was plain even at that distance that Daniel\nBrewster had his troubles and was bearing them with an ill grace. He was\nscowling absently at the table-cloth.\n\n\"YOU call him,\" said Archie, having inspected his formidable relative.\n\"You know him better.\"\n\n\"Let's go over to him.\"\n\nThey crossed the room. Lucille sat down opposite her father.-Archie\ndraped himself over a chair in the background.\n\n\"Father, dear,\" said Lucille. \"Archie has got an idea.\"\n\n\"Archie?\" said Mr. Brewster incredulously.\n\n\"This is me,\" said Archie, indicating himself with a spoon. \"The tall,\ndistinguished-looking bird.\"\n\n\"What new fool-thing is he up to now?\"\n\n\"It's a splendid idea, father. He wants to help you over your new\nhotel.\"\n\n\"Wants to run it for me, I suppose?\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" said Archie, reflectively. \"That's not a bad scheme! I never\nthought of running an hotel. I shouldn't mind taking a stab at it.\"\n\n\"He has thought of a way of getting rid of Salvatore and his shop.\"\n\nFor the first time Mr. Brewster's interest in the conversation seemed to\nstir. He looked sharply at his son-in-law.\n\n\"He has, has he?\" he said.\n\nArchie balanced a roll on a fork and inserted a plate underneath. The\nroll bounded away into a corner.\n\n\"Sorry!\" said Archie. \"My fault, absolutely! I owe you a roll. I'll sign\na bill for it. Oh, about this sportsman Salvatore, Well, it's like this,\nyou know. He and I are great pals. I've known him for years and years.\nAt least, it seems like years and years. Lu was suggesting that I\nseek him out in his lair and ensnare him with my diplomatic manner and\nsuperior brain power and what not.\"\n\n\"It was your idea, precious,\" said Lucille.\n\nMr. Brewster was silent.--Much as it went against the grain to have to\nadmit it, there seemed to be something in this.\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"Become a jolly old ambassador. How much did you offer the chappie?\"\n\n\"Three thousand dollars. Twice as much as the place is worth. He's\nholding out on me for revenge.\"\n\n\"Ah, but how did you offer it to him, what? I mean to say, I bet you got\nyour lawyer to write him a letter full of whereases, peradventures, and\nparties of the first part, and so forth. No good, old companion!\"\n\n\"Don't call me old companion!\"\n\n\"All wrong, laddie! Nothing like it, dear heart! No good at all, friend\nof my youth! Take it from your Uncle Archibald! I'm a student of human\nnature, and I know a thing or two.\"\n\n\"That's not much,\" growled Mr. Brewster, who was finding his\nson-in-law's superior manner a little trying.\n\n\"Now, don't interrupt, father,\" said Lucille, severely. \"Can't you see\nthat Archie is going to be tremendously clever in a minute?\"\n\n\"He's got to show me!\"\n\n\"What you ought to do,\" said Archie, \"is to let me go and see him,\ntaking the stuff in crackling bills. I'll roll them about on the\ntable in front of him. That'll fetch him!\" He prodded Mr. Brewster\nencouragingly with a roll. \"I'll tell you what to do. Give me three\nthousand of the best and crispest, and I'll undertake to buy that shop.\nIt can't fail, laddie!\"\n\n\"Don't call me laddie!\" Mr. Brewster pondered. \"Very well,\" he said at\nlast. \"I didn't know you had so much sense,\" he added grudgingly.\n\n\"Oh, positively!\" said Archie. \"Beneath a rugged exterior I hide a brain\nlike a buzz-saw. Sense? I exude it, laddie; I drip with it.\"\n\nThere were moments during the ensuing days when Mr. Brewster permitted\nhimself to hope; but more frequent were the moments when he told himself\nthat a pronounced chump like his son-in-law could not fail somehow to\nmake a mess of the negotiations. His relief, therefore, when Archie\ncurveted into his private room and announced that he had succeeded was\ngreat.\n\n\"You really managed to make that wop sell out?\"\n\nArchie brushed some papers off the desk with a careless gesture, and\nseated himself on the vacant spot.\n\n\"Absolutely! I spoke to him as one old friend to another, sprayed the\nbills all over the place; and he sang a few bars from 'Rigoletto,' and\nsigned on the dotted line.\"\n\n\"You're not such a fool as you look,\" owned Mr. Brewster.\n\nArchie scratched a match on the desk and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"It's a jolly little shop,\" he said. \"I took quite a fancy to it. Full\nof newspapers, don't you know, and cheap novels, and some weird-looking\nsort of chocolates, and cigars with the most fearfully attractive\nlabels. I think I'll make a success of it. It's bang in the middle of a\ndashed good neighbourhood. One of these days somebody will be building\na big hotel round about there, and that'll help trade a lot. I look\nforward to ending my days on the other side of the counter with a\nfull set of white whiskers and a skull-cap, beloved by everybody.\nEverybody'll say, 'Oh, you MUST patronise that quaint, delightful old\nblighter! He's quite a character.'\"\n\nMr. Brewster's air of grim satisfaction had given way to a look of\ndiscomfort, almost of alarm. He presumed his son-in-law was merely\nindulging in badinage; but even so, his words were not soothing.\n\n\"Well, I'm much obliged,\" he said. \"That infernal shop was holding up\neverything. Now I can start building right away.\"\n\nArchie raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"But, my dear old top, I'm sorry to spoil your daydreams and stop you\nchasing rainbows, and all that, but aren't you forgetting that the shop\nbelongs to me? I don't at all know that I want to sell, either!\"\n\n\"I gave you the money to buy that shop!\"\n\n\"And dashed generous of you it was, too!\" admitted Archie, unreservedly.\n\"It was the first money you ever gave me, and I shall always, tell\ninterviewers that it was you who founded my fortunes. Some day, when I'm\nthe Newspaper-and-Tobacco-Shop King, I'll tell the world all about it in\nmy autobiography.\"\n\nMr. Brewster rose dangerously from his seat.\n\n\"Do you think you can hold me up, you--you worm?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Archie, \"the way I look at it is this. Ever since we met,\nyou've been after me to become one of the world's workers, and earn a\nliving for myself, and what not; and now I see a way to repay you for\nyour confidence and encouragement. You'll look me up sometimes at the\ngood old shop, won't you?\" He slid off the table and moved towards the\ndoor. \"There won't be any formalities where you are concerned. You can\nsign bills for any reasonable amount any time you want a cigar or a\nstick of chocolate. Well, toodle-oo!\"\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"How much do you want for that damned shop?\"\n\n\"I don't want money.-I want a job.-If you are going to take my life-work\naway from me, you ought to give me something else to do.\"\n\n\"What job?\"\n\n\"You suggested it yourself the other day. I want to manage your new\nhotel.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool! What do you know about managing an hotel?\"\n\n\"Nothing. It will be your pleasing task to teach me the business while\nthe shanty is being run up.\"\n\nThere was a pause, while Mr. Brewster chewed three inches off a\npen-holder.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Topping!\" said Archie. \"I knew you'd, see it. I'll study your methods,\nwhat! Adding some of my own, of course. You know, I've thought of one\nimprovement on the Cosmopolis already.\"\n\n\"Improvement on the Cosmopolis!\" cried Mr. Brewster, gashed in his\nfinest feelings.\n\n\"Yes. There's one point where the old Cosmop slips up badly, and I'm\ngoing to see that it's corrected at my little shack. Customers will be\nentreated to leave their boots outside their doors at night, and they'll\nfind them cleaned in the morning. Well, pip, pip! I must be popping.\nTime is money, you know, with us business men.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. BROTHER BILL'S ROMANCE\n\n\n\"Her eyes,\" said Bill Brewster, \"are like--like--what's the word I\nwant?\"\n\nHe looked across at Lucille and Archie. Lucille was leaning forward\nwith an eager and interested face; Archie was leaning back with his\nfinger-tips together and his eyes closed. This was not the first time\nsince their meeting in Beale's Auction Rooms that his brother-in-law had\ntouched on the subject of the girl he had become engaged to marry during\nhis trip to England. Indeed, Brother Bill had touched on very little\nelse: and Archie, though of a sympathetic nature and fond of his young\nrelative, was beginning to feel that he had heard all he wished to hear\nabout Mabel Winchester. Lucille, on the other hand, was absorbed. Her\nbrother's recital had thrilled her.\n\n\"Like--\" said Bill. \"Like--\"\n\n\"Stars?\" suggested Lucille.\n\n\"Stars,\" said Bill gratefully. \"Exactly the word. Twin stars shining in\na clear sky on a summer night. Her teeth are like--what shall I say?\"\n\n\"Pearls?\"\n\n\"Pearls. And her hair is a lovely brown, like leaves in autumn. In\nfact,\" concluded Bill, slipping down from the heights with something of\na jerk, \"she's a corker. Isn't she, Archie?\"\n\nArchie opened his eyes.\n\n\"Quite right, old top!\" he said. \"It was the only thing to do.\"\n\n\"What the devil are you talking about?\" demanded Bill coldly. He had\nbeen suspicious all along of Archie's statement that he could listen\nbetter with his eyes shut.\n\n\"Eh? Oh, sorry! Thinking of something else.\"\n\n\"You were asleep.\"\n\n\"No, no, positively and distinctly not. Frightfully interested and rapt\nand all that, only I didn't quite get what you said.\"\n\n\"I said that Mabel was a corker.\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely in every respect.\"\n\n\"There!\" Bill turned to Lucille triumphantly. \"You hear that? And Archie\nhas only seen her photograph. Wait till he sees her in the flesh.\"\n\n\"My dear old chap!\" said Archie, shocked. \"Ladies present! I mean to\nsay, what!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that father will be the one you'll find it hard to\nconvince.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted her brother gloomily.\n\n\"Your Mabel sounds perfectly charming, but--well, you know what father\nis. It IS a pity she sings in the chorus.\"\n\n\"She-hasn't much of a voice,\"-argued Bill-in extenuation.\n\n\"All the same--\"\n\nArchie, the conversation having reached a topic on which he considered\nhimself one of the greatest living authorities--to wit, the unlovable\ndisposition of his father-in-law--addressed the meeting as one who has a\nright to be heard.\n\n\"Lucille's absolutely right, old thing.--Absolutely correct-o! Your\nesteemed progenitor is a pretty tough nut, and it's no good trying to\nget away from it.-And I'm sorry to have to say it, old bird, but, if you\ncome bounding in with part of the personnel of the ensemble on your arm\nand try to dig a father's blessing out of him, he's extremely apt to\nstab you in the gizzard.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Bill, annoyed, \"you wouldn't talk as though Mabel were\nthe ordinary kind of chorus-girl. She's only on the stage because her\nmother's hard-up and she wants to educate her little brother.\"\n\n\"I say,\" said Archie, concerned. \"Take my tip, old top. In chatting the\nmatter over with the pater, don't dwell too much on that aspect of\nthe affair.--I've been watching him closely, and it's about all he\ncan stick, having to support ME. If you ring in a mother and a little\nbrother on him, he'll crack under the strain.\"\n\n\"Well, I've got to do something about it. Mabel will be over here in a\nweek.\"\n\n\"Great Scot! You never told us that.\"\n\n\"Yes. She's going to be in the new Billington show. And, naturally, she\nwill expect to meet my family. I've told her all about you.\"\n\n\"Did you explain father to her?\" asked Lucille.\n\n\"Well, I just said she mustn't mind him, as his bark was worse than his\nbite.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Archie, thoughtfully, \"he hasn't bitten me yet, so you may\nbe right. But you've got to admit that he's a bit of a barker.\"\n\nLucille considered.\n\n\"Really, Bill, I think your best plan would be to go straight to father\nand tell him the whole thing.--You don't want him to hear about it in a\nroundabout way.\"\n\n\"The trouble is that, whenever I'm with father, I can't think of\nanything to say.\"\n\nArchie found himself envying his father-in-law this merciful\ndispensation of Providence; for, where he himself was concerned, there\nhad been no lack of eloquence on Bill's part. In the brief period in\nwhich he had known him, Bill had talked all the time and always on\nthe one topic. As unpromising a subject as the tariff laws was easily\ndiverted by him into a discussion of the absent Mabel.\n\n\"When I'm with father,\" said Bill, \"I sort of lose my nerve, and\nyammer.\"\n\n\"Dashed awkward,\" said Archie, politely. He sat up suddenly. \"I say! By\nJove! I know what you want, old friend! Just thought of it!\"\n\n\"That busy brain is never still,\" explained Lucille.\n\n\"Saw it in the paper this morning. An advertisement of a book, don't you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I've no time for reading.\"\n\n\"You've time for reading this one, laddie, for you can't afford to miss\nit. It's a what-d'you-call-it book. What I mean to say is, if you read\nit and take its tips to heart, it guarantees to make you a convincing\ntalker. The advertisement says so. The advertisement's all about a\nchappie whose name I forget, whom everybody loved because he talked so\nwell. And, mark you, before he got hold of this book--The Personality\nThat Wins was the name of it, if I remember rightly--he was known to\nall the lads in the office as Silent Samuel or something. Or it may have\nbeen Tongue-Tied Thomas. Well, one day he happened by good luck to blow\nin the necessary for the good old P. that W.'s, and now, whenever they\nwant someone to go and talk Rockefeller or someone into lending them a\nmillion or so, they send for Samuel. Only now they call him Sammy the\nSpell-Binder and fawn upon him pretty copiously and all that. How about\nit, old son? How do we go?\"\n\n\"What perfect nonsense,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Bill, plainly impressed. \"There might be something\nin it.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said Archie. \"I remember it said, 'Talk convincingly, and\nno man will ever treat you with cold, unresponsive indifference.' Well,\ncold, unresponsive indifference is just what you don't want the pater to\ntreat you with, isn't it, or is it, or isn't it, what? I mean, what?\"\n\n\"It sounds all right,\" said Bill.\n\n\"It IS all right,\" said Archie. \"It's a scheme! I'll go farther. It's an\negg!\"\n\n\"The idea I had,\" said Bill, \"was to see if I couldn't get Mabel a job\nin some straight comedy. That would take the curse off the thing a bit.\nThen I wouldn't have to dwell on the chorus end of the business, you\nsee.\"\n\n\"Much more sensible,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"But what a-deuce of a sweat\"--argued Archie. \"I mean to say, having to\npop round and nose about and all that.\"\n\n\"Aren't you willing to take a little trouble for your stricken\nbrother-in-law, worm?\" said Lucille severely.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely! My idea was to get this book and coach the dear old\nchap. Rehearse him, don't you know. He could bone up the early chapters\na bit and then drift round and try his convincing talk on me.\"\n\n\"It might be a good idea,\" said Bill reflectively.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you what _I'm_ going to do,\" said Lucille. \"I'm going\nto get Bill to introduce me to his Mabel, and, if she's as nice as he\nsays she is, _I'll_ go to father and talk convincingly to him.\"\n\n\"You're an ace!\" said Bill.\n\n\"Absolutely!\" agreed Archie cordially. \"MY partner, what! All the same,\nwe ought to keep the book as a second string, you know. I mean to say,\nyou are a young and delicately nurtured girl--full of sensibility and\nshrinking what's-its-name and all that--and you know what the jolly old\npater is. He might bark at you and put you out of action in the first\nround. Well, then, if anything like that happened, don't you see, we\ncould unleash old Bill, the trained silver-tongued expert, and let him\nhave a shot. Personally, I'm all for the P. that W.'s.\"-\"Me, too,\" said\nBill.\n\nLucille looked at her watch.\n\n\"Good gracious! It's nearly one o'clock!\"\n\n\"No!\" Archie heaved himself up from his chair. \"Well, it's a shame to\nbreak up this feast of reason and flow of soul and all that, but, if we\ndon't leg it with some speed, we shall be late.\"\n\n\"We're lunching at the Nicholson's!\" explained Lucille to her brother.\n\"I wish you were coming too.\"\n\n\"Lunch!\" Bill shook his head with a kind of tolerant scorn. \"Lunch means\nnothing to me these days. I've other things to think of besides food.\"\nHe looked as spiritual as his rugged features would permit. \"I haven't\nwritten to Her yet to-day.\"\n\n\"But, dash it, old scream, if she's going to be over here in a week,\nwhat's the good of writing? The letter would cross her.\"\n\n\"I'm not mailing my letters to England.\" said Bill. \"I'm keeping them\nfor her to read when she arrives.\"\n\n\"My sainted aunt!\" said Archie.\n\nDevotion like this was something beyond his outlook.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE SAUSAGE CHAPPIE\n\n\nThe personality that wins cost Archie two dollars in cash and a lot of\nembarrassment when he asked for it at the store. To buy a treatise of\nthat name would automatically seem to argue that you haven't a winning\npersonality already, and Archie was at some pains to explain to the girl\nbehind the counter that he wanted it for a friend. The girl seemed more\ninterested in his English accent than in his explanation, and Archie\nwas uncomfortably aware, as he receded, that she was practising it in an\nundertone for the benefit of her colleagues and fellow-workers. However,\nwhat is a little discomfort, if endured in friendship's name?\n\nHe was proceeding up Broadway after leaving the store when he\nencountered Reggie van Tuyl, who was drifting along in somnambulistic\nfashion near Thirty-Ninth Street.\n\n\"Hullo, Reggie old thing!\" said Archie.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Reggie, a man of few words.\n\n\"I've just been buying a book for Bill Brewster,\" went on Archie. \"It\nappears that old Bill--What's the matter?\"\n\nHe broke off his recital abruptly. A sort of spasm had passed across\nhis companion's features. The hand holding Archie's arm had tightened\nconvulsively. One would have said that Reginald had received a shock.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" said Reggie. \"I'm all right now. I caught sight of that\nfellow's clothes rather suddenly. They shook me a bit. I'm all right\nnow,\" he said, bravely.\n\nArchie, following his friend's gaze, understood. Reggie van Tuyl was\nnever at his strongest in the morning, and he had a sensitive eye for\nclothes. He had been known to resign from clubs because members exceeded\nthe bounds in the matter of soft shirts with dinner-jackets. And the\nshort, thick-set man who was standing just in front of them in attitude\nof restful immobility was certainly no dandy. His best friend could\nnot have called him dapper. Take him for all in all and on the hoof, he\nmight have been posing as a model for a sketch of What the Well-Dressed\nMan Should Not Wear.\n\nIn costume, as in most other things, it is best to take a definite line\nand stick to it. This man had obviously vacillated. His neck was swathed\nin a green scarf; he wore an evening-dress coat; and his lower limbs\nwere draped in a pair of tweed trousers built for a larger man. To the\nnorth he was bounded by a straw hat, to the south by brown shoes.\n\nArchie surveyed the man's back carefully.\n\n\"Bit thick!\" he said, sympathetically. \"But of course Broadway isn't\nFifth Avenue. What I mean to say is, Bohemian licence and what not.\nBroadway's crammed with deuced brainy devils who don't care how they\nlook. Probably this bird is a master-mind of some species.\"\n\n\"All the same, man's no right to wear evening-dress coat with tweed\ntrousers.\"\n\n\"Absolutely not! I see what you mean.\"\n\nAt this point the sartorial offender turned. Seen from the front, he was\neven more unnerving. He appeared to possess no shirt, though this defect\nwas offset by the fact that the tweed trousers fitted snugly under the\narms. He was not a handsome man. At his best he could never have been\nthat, and in the recent past he had managed to acquire a scar that ran\nfrom the corner of his mouth half-way across his cheek. Even when his\nface was in repose he had an odd expression; and when, as he chanced\nto do now, he smiled, odd became a mild adjective, quite inadequate\nfor purposes of description. It was not an unpleasant face, however.\nUnquestionably genial, indeed. There was something in it that had a\nquality of humorous appeal.\n\nArchie started. He stared at the man, Memory stirred.\n\n\"Great Scot!\" he cried. \"It's the Sausage Chappie!\"\n\nReginald van Tuyl gave a little moan. He was not used to this sort of\nthing. A sensitive young man as regarded scenes, Archie's behaviour\nunmanned him. For Archie, releasing his arm, had bounded forward and was\nshaking the other's hand warmly.\n\n\"Well, well, well! My dear old chap! You must remember me, what? No?\nYes?\"\n\nThe man with the scar seemed puzzled. He shuffled the brown shoes,\npatted the straw hat, and eyed Archie questioningly.\n\n\"I don't seem to place you,\" he said.\n\nArchie slapped the back of the evening-dress coat. He linked his arm\naffectionately with that of the dress-reformer.\n\n\"We met outside St Mihiel in the war. You gave me a bit of sausage.\nOne of the most sporting events in history. Nobody but a real sportsman\nwould have parted with a bit of sausage at that moment to a stranger.\nNever forgotten it, by Jove. Saved my life, absolutely. Hadn't chewed\na morsel for eight hours. Well, have you got anything on? I mean to say,\nyou aren't booked for lunch or any rot of that species, are you? Fine!\nThen I move we all toddle off and get a bite somewhere.\" He squeezed\nthe other's arm fondly. \"Fancy meeting you again like this! I've often\nwondered what became of you. But, by Jove, I was forgetting. Dashed rude\nof me. My friend, Mr. van Tuyl.\"\n\nReggie gulped. The longer he looked at it, the harder this man's costume\nwas to bear. His eye passed shudderingly from the brown shoes to the\ntweed trousers, to the green scarf, from the green scarf to the straw\nhat.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"Just remembered. Important date. Late already.\nEr--see you some time--\"\n\nHe melted away, a broken man. Archie was not sorry to see him go. Reggie\nwas a good chap, but he would undoubtedly have been de trop at this\nreunion.\n\n\"I vote we go to the Cosmopolis,\" he said, steering his newly-found\nfriend through the crowd. \"The browsing and sluicing isn't bad there,\nand I can sign the bill which is no small consideration nowadays.\"\n\nThe Sausage Chappie chuckled amusedly.\n\n\"I can't go to a place like the Cosmopolis looking like this.\"\n\nArchie, was a little embarrassed.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, you know, don't you know!\" he said. \"Still, since you\nhave brought the topic up, you DID get the good old wardrobe a bit mixed\nthis morning what? I mean to say, you seem absent-mindedly, as it\nwere, to have got hold of samples from a good number of your various\nsuitings.\"\n\n\"Suitings? How do you mean, suitings? I haven't any suitings! Who do you\nthink I am? Vincent Astor? All I have is what I stand up in.\"\n\nArchie was shocked. This tragedy touched him. He himself had never had\nany money in his life, but somehow he had always seemed to manage to\nhave plenty of clothes. How this was he could not say. He had always had\na vague sort of idea that tailors were kindly birds who never failed to\nhave a pair of trousers or something up their sleeve to present to the\ndeserving. There was the drawback, of course, that once they had given\nyou things they were apt to write you rather a lot of letters about it;\nbut you soon managed to recognise their handwriting, and then it was a\nsimple task to extract their communications from your morning mail and\ndrop them in the waste-paper basket. This was the first case he had\nencountered of a man who was really short of clothes.\n\n\"My dear old lad,\" he said, briskly, \"this must be remedied! Oh,\npositively! This must be remedied at once! I suppose my things wouldn't\nfit you? No. Well, I tell you what. We'll wangle something from\nmy father-in-law. Old Brewster, you know, the fellow who runs the\nCosmopolis. His'll fit you like the paper on the wall, because he's\na tubby little blighter, too. What I mean to say is, he's also one of\nthose sturdy, square, fine-looking chappies of about the middle height.\nBy the way, where are you stopping these days?\"\n\n\"Nowhere just at present. I thought of taking one of those\nself-contained Park benches.\"\n\n\"Are you broke?\"\n\n\"Am I!\"\n\nArchie was concerned.\n\n\"You ought to get a job.\"\n\n\"I ought. But somehow I don't seem able to.\"\n\n\"What did you do before the war?\"\n\n\"I've forgotten.\"\n\n\"Forgotten!\"\n\n\"Forgotten.\"\n\n\"How do you mean--forgotten? You can't mean--FORGOTTEN?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's quite gone.\"\n\n\"But I mean to say. You can't have forgotten a thing like that.\"\n\n\"Can't I! I've forgotten all sorts of things. Where I was born. How old\nI am. Whether I'm married or single. What my name is--\"\n\n\"Well, I'm dashed!\" said Archie, staggered. \"But you remembered about\ngiving me a bit of sausage outside St. Mihiel?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. I'm taking your word for it. For all I know you may be\nluring me into some den to rob me of my straw hat. I don't know you\nfrom Adam. But I like your conversation--especially the part about\neating--and I'm taking a chance.\"\n\nArchie was concerned.\n\n\"Listen, old bean. Make an effort. You must remember that sausage\nepisode? It was just outside St. Mihiel, about five in the evening. Your\nlittle lot were lying next to my little lot, and we happened to meet,\nand I said 'What ho!' and you said 'Halloa!' and I said 'What ho! What\nho!' and you said 'Have a bit of sausage?' and I said 'What ho! What ho!\nWhat HO!'\"\n\n\"The dialogue seems to have been darned sparkling but I don't remember\nit. It must have been after that that I stopped one. I don't seem quite\nto have caught up with myself since I got hit.\"\n\n\"Oh! That's how you got that scar?\"\n\n\"No. I got that jumping through a plate-glass window in London on\nArmistice night.\"\n\n\"What on earth did you do that for?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. It seemed a good idea at the time.\"\n\n\"But if you can remember a thing like that, why can't you remember your\nname?\"\n\n\"I remember everything that happened after I came out of hospital. It's\nthe part before that's gone.\"\n\nArchie patted him on the shoulder.\n\n\"I know just what you want. You need a bit of quiet and repose, to think\nthings over and so forth. You mustn't go sleeping on Park benches. Won't\ndo at all. Not a bit like it. You must shift to the Cosmopolis. It isn't\nhalf a bad spot, the old Cosmop. I didn't like it much the first night\nI was there, because there was a dashed tap that went drip-drip-drip all\nnight and kept me awake, but the place has its points.\"\n\n\"Is the Cosmopolis giving free board and lodging these days?\"\n\n\"Rather! That'll be all right. Well, this is the spot. We'll start by\ntrickling up to the old boy's suite and looking over his reach-me-downs.\nI know the waiter on his floor. A very sound chappie. He'll let us in\nwith his pass-key.\"\n\nAnd so it came about that Mr. Daniel Brewster, returning to his suite in\nthe middle of lunch in order to find a paper dealing with the subject he\nwas discussing with his guest, the architect of his new hotel, was aware\nof a murmur of voices behind the closed door of his bedroom. Recognising\nthe accents of his son-in-law, he breathed an oath and charged in. He\nobjected to Archie wandering at large about his suite.\n\nThe sight that met his eyes when he opened the door did nothing to\nsoothe him. The floor was a sea of clothes. There were coats on the\nchairs, trousers on the bed, shirts on the bookshelf. And in the middle\nof his welter stood Archie, with a man who, to Mr. Brewster's heated\neye, looked like a tramp comedian out of a burlesque show.\n\n\"Great Godfrey!\" ejaculated Mr. Brewster.\n\nArchie looked up with a friendly smile.\n\n\"Oh, halloa-halloa!\" he said, affably, \"We were just glancing through\nyour spare scenery to see if we couldn't find something for my pal here.\nThis is Mr. Brewster, my father-in-law, old man.\"\n\nArchie scanned his relative's twisted features. Something in his\nexpression seemed not altogether encouraging. He decided that the\nnegotiations had better be conducted in private. \"One moment, old lad,\"\nhe said to his new friend. \"I just want to have a little talk with my\nfather-in-law in the other room. Just a little friendly business chat.\nYou stay here.\"\n\nIn the other room Mr. Brewster turned on Archie like a wounded lion of\nthe desert.\n\n\"What the--!\"\n\nArchie secured one of his coat-buttons and began to massage it\naffectionately.\n\n\"Ought to have explained!\" said Archie, \"only didn't want to interrupt\nyour lunch. The sportsman on the horizon is a dear old pal of mine--\"\n\nMr. Brewster wrenched himself free.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean, you worm, by bringing tramps into my\nbedroom and messing about with my clothes?\"\n\n\"That's just what I'm trying to explain, if you'll only listen. This\nbird is a bird I met in France during the war. He gave me a bit of\nsausage outside St. Mihiel--\"\n\n\"Damn you and him and the sausage!\"\n\n\"Absolutely. But listen. He can't remember who he is or where he was\nborn or what his name is, and he's broke; so, dash it, I must look after\nhim. You see, he gave me a bit of sausage.\"\n\nMr. Brewster's frenzy gave way to an ominous calm.\n\n\"I'll give him two seconds to clear out of here. If he isn't gone by\nthen I'll have him thrown out.\"\n\nArchie was shocked.\n\n\"You don't mean that?\"\n\n\"I do mean that.\"\n\n\"But where is he to go?\"\n\n\"Outside.\"\n\n\"But you don't understand. This chappie has lost his memory because he\nwas wounded in the war. Keep that fact firmly fixed in the old bean. He\nfought for you. Fought and bled for you. Bled profusely, by Jove. AND he\nsaved my life!\"\n\n\"If I'd got nothing else against him, that would be enough.\"\n\n\"But you can't sling a chappie out into the cold hard world who bled in\ngallons to make the world safe for the Hotel Cosmopolis.\"\n\nMr. Brewster looked ostentatiously at his watch.\n\n\"Two seconds!\" he said.\n\nThere was a silence. Archie appeared to be thinking. \"Right-o!\" he said\nat last. \"No need to get the wind up. I know where he can go. It's just\noccurred to me I'll put him up at my little shop.\"\n\nThe purple ebbed from Mr. Brewster's face. Such was his emotion that he\nhad forgotten that infernal shop. He sat down. There was more silence.\n\n\"Oh, gosh!\" said Mr. Brewster.\n\n\"I knew you would be reasonable about it,\" said Archie, approvingly.\n\"Now, honestly, as man to man, how do we go?\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" growled Mr. Brewster.\n\n\"I thought you might put the chappie up for a while, and give him a\nchance to look round and nose about a bit.\"\n\n\"I absolutely refuse to give any more loafers free board and lodging.\"\n\n\"Any MORE?\"\n\n\"Well, he would be the second, wouldn't he?\"\n\nArchie looked pained.\n\n\"It's true,\" he said, \"that when I first came here I was temporarily\nresting, so to speak; but didn't I go right out and grab the managership\nof your new hotel? Positively!\"\n\n\"I will NOT adopt this tramp.\"\n\n\"Well, find him a job, then.\"\n\n\"What sort of a job?\"\n\n\"Oh, any old sort\"\n\n\"He can be a waiter if he likes.\"\n\n\"All right; I'll put the matter before him.\"\n\nHe returned to the bedroom. The Sausage Chappie was gazing fondly into\nthe mirror with a spotted tie draped round his neck.\n\n\"I say, old top,\" said Archie, apologetically, \"the Emperor of the\nBlighters out yonder says you can have a job here as waiter, and he\nwon't do another dashed thing for you. How about it?\"\n\n\"Do waiters eat?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Though, by Jove, come to think of it, I've never seen one\nat it.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me!\" said the Sausage Chappie. \"When do I\nbegin?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. REGGIE COMES TO LIFE\n\n\nThe advantage of having plenty of time on one's hands is that one has\nleisure to attend to the affairs of all one's circle of friends; and\nArchie, assiduously as he watched over the destinies of the Sausage\nChappie, did not neglect the romantic needs of his brother-in-law Bill.\nA few days later, Lucille, returning one morning to their mutual suite,\nfound her husband seated in an upright chair at the table, an unusually\nstern expression on his amiable face. A large cigar was in the corner\nof his mouth. The fingers of one hand rested in the armhole of his\nwaistcoat: with the other hand he tapped menacingly on the table.\n\nAs she gazed upon him, wondering what could be the matter with him,\nLucille was suddenly aware of Bill's presence. He had emerged sharply\nfrom the bedroom and was walking briskly across the floor. He came to a\nhalt in front of the table.\n\n\"Father!\" said Bill.\n\nArchie looked up sharply, frowning heavily over his cigar.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" he said in a strange, rasping voice. \"What is it? Speak\nup, my boy, speak up! Why the devil can't you speak up? This is my busy\nday!\"\n\n\"What on earth are you doing?\" asked Lucille.\n\nArchie waved her away with the large gesture of a man of blood and iron\ninterrupted while concentrating.\n\n\"Leave us, woman! We would be alone! Retire into the jolly old\nbackground and amuse yourself for a bit. Read a book. Do acrostics.\nCharge ahead, laddie.\"\n\n\"Father!\" said Bill, again.\n\n\"Yes, my boy, yes? What is it?\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\nArchie picked up the red-covered volume that lay on the table.\n\n\"Half a mo', old son. Sorry to stop you, but I knew there was something.\nI've just remembered. Your walk. All wrong!\"\n\n\"All wrong?\"\n\n\"All wrong! Where's the chapter on the Art. of Walking? Here we are.\nListen, dear old soul. Drink this in. 'In walking, one should strive to\nacquire that swinging, easy movement from the hips. The correctly-poised\nwalker seems to float along, as it were.' Now, old bean, you didn't\nfloat a dam' bit. You just galloped in like a chappie charging into\na railway restaurant for a bowl of soup when his train leaves in two\nminutes. Dashed important, this walking business, you know. Get started\nwrong, and where are you? Try it again.... Much better.\" He turned to\nLucille. \"Notice him float along that time? Absolutely skimmed, what?\"\n\nLucille had taken a seat,-and was waiting for enlightenment.\n\n\"Are you and Bill going into vaudeville?\" she asked.\n\nArchie, scrutinising-his-brother-in-law closely, had further criticism\nto make.\n\n\"'The man of self-respect and self-confidence,'\" he read, \"'stands erect\nin an easy, natural, graceful attitude. Heels not too far apart, head\nerect, eyes to the front with a level gaze'--get your gaze level, old\nthing!--'shoulders thrown back, arms hanging naturally at the sides when\nnot otherwise employed'--that means that, if he tries to hit you, it's\nall right to guard--'chest expanded naturally, and abdomen'--this is\nno place for you, Lucille. Leg it out of earshot--'ab--what I said\nbefore--drawn in somewhat and above all not protruded.' Now, have you\ngot all that? Yes, you look all right. Carry on, laddie, carry on. Let's\nhave two-penn'orth of the Dynamic Voice and the Tone of Authority--some\nof the full, rich, round stuff we hear so much about!\"\n\nBill fastened a gimlet eye upon his brother-in-law and drew a deep\nbreath.\n\n\"Father!\" he said. \"Father!\"\n\n\"You'll have to brighten up Bill's dialogue a lot,\" said Lucille,\ncritically, \"or you will never get bookings.\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"I mean, it's all right as far as it goes, but it's sort of monotonous.\nBesides, one of you ought to be asking questions and the other\nanswering. Bill ought to be saying, 'Who was that lady I saw you coming\ndown the street with?' so that you would be able to say, 'That wasn't a\nlady. That was my wife.' I KNOW! I've been to lots of vaudeville shows.\"\n\nBill relaxed his attitude. He deflated his chest, spread his heels, and\nceased to draw in his abdomen.\n\n\"We'd better try this another time, when we're alone,\" he said,\nfrigidly. \"I can't do myself justice.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to do yourself justice?\" asked Lucille.\n\n\"Right-o!\" said Archie, affably, casting off his forbidding expression\nlike a garment. \"Rehearsal postponed. I was just putting old Bill\nthrough it,\" he explained, \"with a view to getting him into mid-season\nform for the jolly old pater.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Lucille's voice was the voice of one who sees light in darkness.\n\"When Bill walked in like a cat on hot bricks and stood there looking\nstuffed, that was just the Personality That Wins!\"\n\n\"That was it.\"\n\n\"Well, you couldn't blame me for not recognising it, could you?\"\n\nArchie patted her head paternally.\n\n\"A little less of the caustic critic stuff,\" he said. \"Bill will be\nall right on the night. If you hadn't come in then and put him off his\nstroke, he'd have shot out some amazing stuff, full of authority and\ndynamic accents and what not. I tell you, light of my soul, old Bill is\nall right! He's got the winning personality up a tree, ready whenever\nhe wants to go and get it. Speaking as his backer and trainer, I think\nhe'll twist your father round his little finger. Absolutely! It wouldn't\nsurprise me if at the end of five minutes the good old dad started\npumping through hoops and sitting up for lumps of sugar.\"\n\n\"It would surprise ME.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's because you haven't seen old Bill in action. You crabbed his\nact before he had begun to spread himself.\"\n\n\"It isn't that at all. The reason why I think that Bill, however winning\nhis personality may be, won't persuade father to let him marry a girl in\nthe chorus is something that happened last night.\"\n\n\"Last night?\"\n\n\"Well, at three o'clock this morning. It's on the front page of the\nearly editions of the evening papers. I brought one in for you to see,\nonly you were so busy. Look! There it is!\"\n\nArchie seized the paper.\n\n\"Oh, Great Scot!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Bill, irritably. \"Don't stand goggling there! What\nthe devil is it?\"\n\n\"Listen to this, old thing!\"\n\n\n                       REVELRY BY NIGHT.\n                SPIRITED BATTLE ROYAL AT HOTEL\n                         COSMOPOLIS.\n             THE HOTEL DETECTIVE HAD A GOOD HEART\n                 BUT PAULINE PACKED THE PUNCH.\n\n\nThe logical contender for Jack Dempsey's championship honours has been\ndiscovered; and, in an age where women are stealing men's jobs all the\ntime, it will not come as a surprise to our readers to learn that she\nbelongs to the sex that is more deadly than the male. Her name is Miss\nPauline Preston, and her wallop is vouched for under oath--under many\noaths--by Mr. Timothy O'Neill, known to his intimates as Pie-Face, who\nholds down the arduous job of detective at the Hotel Cosmopolis.\n\nAt three o'clock this morning, Mr. O'Neill was advised by the\nnight-clerk that the occupants of every room within earshot of number\n618 had 'phoned the desk to complain of a disturbance, a noise, a vocal\nuproar proceeding from the room mentioned. Thither, therefore, marched\nMr. O'Neill, his face full of cheese-sandwich, (for he had been\nindulging in an early breakfast or a late supper) and his heart of\ndevotion to duty. He found there the Misses Pauline Preston and\n\"Bobbie\" St. Clair, of the personnel of the chorus of the Frivolities,\nentertaining a few friends of either sex. A pleasant time was being had\nby all, and at the moment of Mr. O'Neill's entry the entire strength\nof the company was rendering with considerable emphasis that touching\nballad, \"There's a Place For Me In Heaven, For My Baby-Boy Is There.\"\n\nThe able and efficient officer at once suggested that there was a place\nfor them in the street and the patrol-wagon was there; and, being a man\nof action as well as words, proceeded to gather up an armful of assorted\nguests as a preliminary to a personally-conducted tour onto the\ncold night. It was at this point that Miss Preston stepped into the\nlimelight. Mr. O'Neill contends that she hit him with a brick, an iron\ncasing, and the Singer Building. Be that as it may, her efforts were\nsufficiently able to induce him to retire for reinforcements, which,\narriving, arrested the supper-party regardless of age or sex.\n\nAt the police-court this morning Miss Preston maintained that she and\nher friends were merely having a quiet home-evening and that Mr. O'Neill\nwas no gentleman. The male guests gave their names respectively as\nWoodrow Wilson, David Lloyd-George, and William J. Bryan. These,\nhowever, are believed to be incorrect. But the moral is, if you want\nexcitement rather than sleep, stay at the Hotel Cosmopolis.\n\nBill may have quaked inwardly as he listened to this epic but outwardly\nhe was unmoved.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what about it?\"\n\n\"What about it!\" said Lucille.\n\n\"What about it!\" said Archie. \"Why, my dear old friend, it simply means\nthat all the time we've been putting in making your personality winning\nhas been chucked away. Absolutely a dead loss! We might just as well\nhave read a manual on how to knit sweaters.\"\n\n\"I don't see it,\" maintained Bill, stoutly.\n\nLucille turned apologetically to her husband.\n\n\"You mustn't judge me by him, Archie, darling. This sort of thing\ndoesn't run in the family.-We are supposed to be rather bright on the\nwhole. But poor Bill was dropped by his nurse when he was a baby, and\nfell on his head.\"\n\n\"I suppose what you're driving at,\" said the goaded Bill, \"is that what\nhas happened will make father pretty sore against girls who happen to be\nin the chorus?\"\n\n\"That's absolutely it, old thing, I'm sorry to say. The next person who\nmentions the word chorus-girl in the jolly old governor's presence is\ngoing to take his life in his hands. I tell you, as one man to another,\nthat I'd much rather be back in France hopping over the top than do it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"What darned nonsense! Mabel may be in the chorus, but she isn't like\nthose girls.\"\n\n\"Poor old Bill!\" said Lucille. \"I'm awfully sorry, but it's no use not\nfacing facts. You know perfectly well that the reputation of the hotel\nis the thing father cares more about than anything else in the world,\nand that this is going to make him furious with all the chorus-girls in\ncreation. It's no good trying to explain to him that your Mabel is in\nthe chorus but not of the chorus, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Deuced well put!\" said Archie, approvingly. \"You're absolutely right. A\nchorus-girl by the river's brim, so to speak, a simple chorus-girl is to\nhim, as it were, and she is nothing more, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"So now,\" said Lucille, \"having shown you that the imbecile scheme which\nyou concocted with my poor well-meaning husband is no good at all, I\nwill bring you words of cheer. Your own original plan--of getting your\nMabel a part in a comedy--was always the best one. And you can do it.\nI wouldn't have broken the bad news so abruptly if I hadn't had some\nconsolation to give you afterwards. I met Reggie van Tuyl just now,\nwandering about as if the cares of the world were on his shoulders,\nand he told me that he was putting up most of the money for a new play\nthat's going into rehearsal right away. Reggie's an old friend of yours.\nAll you have to do is to go to him and ask him to use his influence to\nget your Mabel a small part. There's sure to be a maid or something with\nonly a line or two that won't matter.\"\n\n\"A ripe scheme!\" said Archie. \"Very sound and fruity!\"\n\nThe cloud did not lift from Bill's corrugated brow.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" he said. \"But you know what a talker Reggie\nis. He's an obliging sort of chump, but his tongue's fastened on at the\nmiddle and waggles at both ends. I don't want the whole of New York to\nknow about my engagement, and have somebody spilling the news to father,\nbefore I'm ready.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Lucille. \"Archie can speak to him. There's no\nneed for him to mention your name at all. He can just say there's a girl\nhe wants to get a part for. You would do it, wouldn't you, angel-face?\"\n\n\"Like a bird, queen of my soul.\"\n\n\"Then that's splendid. You'd better give Archie that photograph of Mabel\nto give to Reggie, Bill.\"\n\n\"Photograph?\" said Bill. \"Which photograph? I have twenty-four!\"\n\nArchie found Reggie van Tuyl brooding in a window of his club that\nlooked over Fifth Avenue. Reggie was a rather melancholy young man who\nsuffered from elephantiasis of the bank-roll and the other evils\nthat arise from that complaint. Gentle and sentimental by nature, his\nsensibilities had been much wounded by contact with a sordid world; and\nthe thing that had first endeared Archie to him was the fact that the\nlatter, though chronically hard-up, had never made any attempt to borrow\nmoney from him. Reggie would have parted with it on demand, but it\nhad delighted him to find that Archie seemed to take a pleasure in his\nsociety without having any ulterior motives. He was fond of Archie,\nand also of Lucille; and their happy marriage was a constant source of\ngratification to him.\n\nFor Reggie was a sentimentalist. He would have liked to live in a world\nof ideally united couples, himself ideally united to some charming and\naffectionate girl. But, as a matter of cold fact, he was a bachelor,\nand most of the couples he knew were veterans of several divorces. In\nReggie's circle, therefore, the home-life of Archie and Lucille shone\nlike a good deed in a naughty world. It inspired him. In moments of\ndepression it restored his waning faith in human nature.\n\nConsequently, when Archie, having greeted him and slipped into a chair\nat his side, suddenly produced from his inside pocket the photograph of\nan extremely pretty girl and asked him to get her a small part in the\nplay which he was financing, he was shocked and disappointed. He was in\na more than usually sentimental mood that afternoon, and had, indeed,\nat the moment of Archie's arrival, been dreaming wistfully of soft arms\nclasped snugly about his collar and the patter of little feet and all\nthat sort of thing.-He gazed reproachfully at Archie.\n\n\"Archie!\" his voice quivered with emotion. \"Is it worth it?, is it worth\nit, old man?-Think of the poor little woman at home!\"\n\nArchie was puzzled.\n\n\"Eh, old top? Which poor little woman?\"\n\n\"Think of her trust in you, her faith--\".\n\n\"I don't absolutely get you, old bean.\"\n\n\"What would Lucille say if she knew about this?\"\n\n\"Oh, she does. She knows all about it.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Reggie.-He was shocked to the core of his\nbeing.-One of the articles of his faith was, that the union of Lucille\nand Archie was different from those loose partnerships which were\nthe custom in his world.-He had not been conscious of such a poignant\nfeeling that the foundations of the universe were cracked and tottering\nand that there was no light and sweetness in life since the morning,\neighteen months back, when a negligent valet had sent him out into Fifth\nAvenue with only one spat on.\n\n\"It was Lucille's idea,\" explained Archie. He was about to mention his\nbrother-in-law's connection with the matter, but checked himself\nin time, remembering Bill's specific objection to having his secret\nrevealed to Reggie. \"It's like this, old thing, I've never met this\nfemale, but she's a pal of Lucille's\"-he comforted his conscience by\nthe reflection that, if she wasn't now, she would be in a few days-\"and\nLucille wants to do her a bit of good. She's been on the stage in\nEngland, you know, supporting a jolly old widowed mother and educating a\nlittle brother and all that kind and species of rot, you understand, and\nnow she's coming over to America, and Lucille wants you to rally round\nand shove her into your show and generally keep the home fires burning\nand so forth. How do we go?\"\n\nReggie beamed with relief. He felt just as he had felt on that other\noccasion at the moment when a taxi-cab had rolled up and enabled him to\nhide his spatless leg from the public gaze.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" he said. \"Why, delighted, old man, quite delighted!\"\n\n\"Any small part would do. Isn't there a maid or something in your\nbob's-worth of refined entertainment who drifts about saying, 'Yes,\nmadam,' and all that sort of thing? Well, then that's just the thing.\nTopping! I knew I could rely on you, old bird. I'll get Lucille to ship\nher round to your address when she arrives. I fancy she's due to totter\nin somewhere in the next few days. Well, I must be popping. Toodle-oo!\"\n\n\"Pip-pip!\" said Reggie.\n\n It was about a week later that Lucille came into the suite at the\nHotel Cosmopolis that was her home, and found Archie lying on the couch,\nsmoking a refreshing pipe after the labours of the day. It seemed to\nArchie that his wife was not in her usual cheerful frame of mind. He\nkissed her, and, having relieved her of her parasol, endeavoured without\nsuccess to balance it on his chin. Having picked it up from the floor\nand placed it on the table, he became aware that Lucille was looking at\nhim in a despondent sort of way. Her grey eyes were clouded.\n\n\"Halloa, old thing,\" said Archie. \"What's up?\"\n\nLucille sighed wearily.\n\n\"Archie, darling, do you know any really good swear-words?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Archie, reflectively, \"let me see. I did pick up a few\ntolerably ripe and breezy expressions out in France. All through my\nmilitary career there was something about me--some subtle magnetism,\ndon't you know, and that sort of thing--that seemed to make colonels and\nblighters of that order rather inventive. I sort of inspired them, don't\nyou know. I remember one brass-hat addressing me for quite ten minutes,\nsaying something new all the time. And even then he seemed to think he\nhad only touched the fringe of the subject. As a matter of fact, he\nsaid straight out in the most frank and confiding way that mere words\ncouldn't do justice to me. But why?\"\n\n\"Because I want to relieve my feelings.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"Everything's wrong. I've just been having tea with Bill and his Mabel.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah!\" said Archie, interested. \"And what's the verdict?\"\n\n\"Guilty!\" said Lucille. \"And the sentence, if I had anything to do\nwith it, would be transportation for life.\" She peeled off her gloves\nirritably. \"What fools men are! Not you, precious! You're the only man\nin the world that isn't, it seems to me. You did marry a nice girl,\ndidn't you? YOU didn't go running round after females with crimson hair,\ngoggling at them with your eyes popping out of your head like a bulldog\nwaiting for a bone.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say! Does old Bill look like that?\"\n\n\"Worse!\"\n\nArchie rose to a point of order.\n\n\"But one moment, old lady. You speak of crimson hair. Surely old\nBill--in the extremely jolly monologues he used to deliver whenever I\ndidn't see him coming and he got me alone--used to allude to her hair as\nbrown.\"\n\n\"It isn't brown now. It's bright scarlet. Good gracious, I ought to\nknow. I've been looking at it all the afternoon. It dazzled me. If I've\ngot to meet her again, I mean to go to the oculist's and get a pair of\nthose smoked glasses you wear at Palm Beach.\" Lucille brooded silently\nfor a while over the tragedy. \"I don't want to say anything against her,\nof course.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not.\"\n\n\"But of all the awful, second-rate girls I ever met, she's the worst!\nShe has vermilion hair and an imitation Oxford manner. She's so horribly\nrefined that it's dreadful to listen to her. She's a sly, creepy,\nslinky, made-up, insincere vampire! She's common! She's awful! She's a\ncat!\"\n\n\"You're quite right not to say anything against her,\" said Archie,\napprovingly. \"It begins to look,\" he went on, \"as if the good old pater\nwas about due for another shock. He has a hard life!\"\n\n\"If Bill DARES to introduce that girl to Father, he's taking his life in\nhis hands.\"\n\n\"But surely that was the idea--the scheme--the wheeze, wasn't it? Or do\nyou think there's any chance of his weakening?\"\n\n\"Weakening! You should have seen him looking at her! It was like a small\nboy flattening his nose against the window of a candy-store.\"\n\n\"Bit thick!\"\n\nLucille kicked the leg of the table.\n\n\"And to think,\" she said, \"that, when I was a little girl, I used to\nlook up to Bill as a monument of wisdom. I used to hug his knees and\ngaze into his face and wonder how anyone could be so magnificent.\" She\ngave the unoffending table another kick. \"If I could have looked into\nthe future,\" she said, with feeling, \"I'd have bitten him in the ankle!\"\n\n In the days which followed, Archie found himself a little out of\ntouch with Bill and his romance. Lucille referred to the matter only\nwhen he brought the subject up, and made it plain that the topic of\nher future sister-in-law was not one which she enjoyed discussing. Mr.\nBrewster, senior, when Archie, by way of delicately preparing his mind\nfor what was about to befall, asked him if he liked red hair, called him\na fool, and told him to go away and bother someone else when they were\nbusy. The only person who could have kept him thoroughly abreast of the\ntrend of affairs was Bill himself; and experience had made Archie wary\nin the matter of meeting Bill. The position of confidant to a young man\nin the early stages of love is no sinecure, and it made Archie sleepy\neven to think of having to talk to his brother-in-law. He sedulously\navoided his love-lorn relative, and it was with a sinking feeling\none day that, looking over his shoulder as he sat in the Cosmopolis\ngrill-room preparatory to ordering lunch, he perceived Bill bearing down\nupon him, obviously resolved upon joining his meal.\n\nTo his surprise, however, Bill did not instantly embark upon his usual\nmonologue. Indeed, he hardly spoke at all. He champed a chop, and seemed\nto Archie to avoid his eye. It was not till lunch was over and they were\nsmoking that he unburdened himself.\n\n\"Archie!\" he said.\n\n\"Hallo, old thing!\" said Archie. \"Still there? I thought you'd died or\nsomething. Talk about our old pals, Tongue-tied Thomas and Silent Sammy!\nYou could beat 'em both on the same evening.\"\n\n\"It's enough to make me silent.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\nBill had relapsed into a sort of waking dream. He sat frowning sombrely,\nlost to the world. Archie, having waited what seemed to him a sufficient\nlength of time for an answer to his question, bent forward and touched\nhis brother-in-law's hand gently with the lighted end of his cigar. Bill\ncame to himself with a howl.\n\n\"What is?\" said Archie.\n\n\"What is what?\" said Bill.\n\n\"Now listen, old thing,\" protested Archie. \"Life is short and time\nis flying. Suppose we cut out the cross-talk. You hinted there was\nsomething on your mind--something worrying the old bean--and I'm waiting\nto hear what it is.\"\n\nBill fiddled a moment with his coffee-spoon.\n\n\"I'm in an awful hole,\" he said at last.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"It's about that darned girl!\"\n\nArchie blinked.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"That darned girl!\"\n\nArchie could scarcely credit his senses. He had been prepared--indeed,\nhe had steeled himself--to hear Bill allude to his affinity in a number\nof ways. But \"that darned girl\" was not one of them.\n\n\"Companion of my riper years,\" he said, \"let's get this thing straight.\nWhen you say 'that darned girl,' do you by any possibility allude to--?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\"\n\n\"But, William, old bird--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know, I know!\" said Bill, irritably. \"You're surprised to\nhear me talk like that about her?\"\n\n\"A trifle, yes. Possibly a trifle. When last heard from, laddie, you\nmust recollect, you were speaking of the lady as your soul-mate, and\nat least once--if I remember rightly--you alluded to her as your little\ndusky-haired lamb.\"\n\nA sharp howl escaped Bill.\n\n\"Don't!\" A strong shudder convulsed his frame. \"Don't remind me of it!\"\n\n\"There's been a species of slump, then, in dusky-haired lambs?\"\n\n\"How,\" demanded Bill, savagely, \"can a girl be a dusky-haired lamb when\nher hair's bright scarlet?\"\n\n\"Dashed difficult!\" admitted Archie.\n\n\"I suppose Lucille told you about that?\"\n\n\"She did touch on it. Lightly, as it were. With a sort of gossamer\ntouch, so to speak.\"\n\nBill threw off the last fragments of reserve.\n\n\"Archie, I'm in the devil of a fix. I don't know why it was, but\ndirectly I saw her--things seemed so different over in England--I mean.\"\nHe swallowed ice-water in gulps. \"I suppose it was seeing her with\nLucille. Old Lu is such a thoroughbred. Seemed to kind of show her\nup. Like seeing imitation pearls by the side of real pearls. And that\ncrimson hair! It sort of put the lid on it.\" Bill brooded morosely. \"It\nought to be a criminal offence for women to dye their hair. Especially\nred. What the devil do women do that sort of thing for?\"\n\n\"Don't blame me, old thing. It's not my fault.\"\n\nBill looked furtive and harassed.\n\n\"It makes me feel such a cad. Here am I, feeling that I would give all\nI've got in the world to get out of the darned thing, and all the time\nthe poor girl seems to be getting fonder of me than ever.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Archie surveyed his brother-in-law critically.\n\"Perhaps her feelings have changed too. Very possibly she may not like\nthe colour of YOUR hair. I don't myself. Now if you were to dye yourself\ncrimson--\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up! Of course a man knows when a girl's fond of him.\"\n\n\"By no means, laddie. When you're my age--\"\n\n\"I AM your age.\"\n\n\"So you are! I forgot that. Well, now, approaching the matter from\nanother angle, let us suppose, old son, that Miss What's-Her-Name--the\nparty of the second part--\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" said Bill suddenly. \"Here comes Reggie!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Here comes Reggie van Tuyl. I don't want him to hear us talking about\nthe darned thing.\"\n\nArchie looked over his shoulder and perceived that it was indeed so.\nReggie was threading his way among the tables.\n\n\"Well, HE looks pleased with things, anyway,\" said Bill, enviously.\n\"Glad somebody's happy.\"\n\nHe was right. Reggie van Tuyl's usual mode of progress through a\nrestaurant was a somnolent slouch. Now he was positively bounding along.\nFurthermore, the usual expression on Reggie's face was a sleepy sadness.\nNow he smiled brightly and with animation. He curveted towards their\ntable, beaming and erect, his head up, his gaze level, and his chest\nexpanded, for all the world as if he had been reading the hints in \"The\nPersonality That Wins.\"\n\nArchie was puzzled. Something had plainly happened to Reggie. But what?\nIt was idle to suppose that somebody had left him money, for he had been\nleft practically all the money there was a matter of ten years before.\n\n\"Hallo, old bean,\" he said, as the new-comer, radiating good will and\nbonhomie, arrived at the table and hung over it like a noon-day sun.\n\"We've finished. But rally round and we'll watch you eat. Dashed\ninteresting, watching old Reggie eat. Why go to the Zoo?\"\n\nReggie shook his head.\n\n\"Sorry, old man. Can't. Just on my way to the Ritz. Stepped in because\nI thought you might be here. I wanted you to be the first to hear the\nnews.\"\n\n\"News?\"\n\n\"I'm the happiest man alive!\"\n\n\"You look it, darn you!\" growled Bill, on whose mood of grey gloom this\nhuman sunbeam was jarring heavily.\n\n\"I'm engaged to be married!\"\n\n\"Congratulations, old egg!\" Archie shook his hand cordially. \"Dash it,\ndon't you know, as an old married man I like to see you young fellows\nsettling down.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you enough, Archie, old man,\" said Reggie,\nfervently.\n\n\"Thank me?\"\n\n\"It was through you that I met her. Don't you remember the girl you sent\nto me? You wanted me to get her a small part--\"\n\nHe stopped, puzzled. Archie had uttered a sound that was half gasp and\nhalf gurgle, but it was swallowed up in the extraordinary noise from the\nother side of the table. Bill Brewster was leaning forward with bulging\neyes and soaring eyebrows.\n\n\"Are you engaged to Mabel Winchester?\"\n\n\"Why, by George!\" said Reggie. \"Do you know her?\"\n\nArchie recovered himself.\n\n\"Slightly,\" he said. \"Slightly. Old Bill knows her slightly, as it were.\nNot very well, don't you know, but--how shall I put it?\"\n\n\"Slightly,\" suggested Bill.\n\n\"Just the word. Slightly.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Reggie van Tuyl. \"Why don't you come along to the Ritz\nand meet her now?\"\n\nBill stammered. Archie came to the rescue again.\n\n\"Bill can't come now. He's got a date.\"\n\n\"A date?\" said Bill.\n\n\"A date,\" said Archie. \"An appointment, don't you know. A--a--in fact, a\ndate.\"\n\n\"But--er--wish her happiness from me,\" said Bill, cordially.\n\n\"Thanks very much, old man,\" said Reggie.\n\n\"And say I'm delighted, will you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"You won't forget the word, will you? Delighted.\"\n\n\"Delighted.\"\n\n\"That's right. Delighted.\"\n\nReggie looked at his watch.\n\n\"Halloa! I must rush!\"\n\nBill and Archie watched him as he bounded out of the restaurant.\n\n\"Poor old Reggie!\" said Bill, with a fleeting compunction.\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Archie. \"What I mean to say is, tastes differ,\ndon't you know. One man's peach is another man's poison, and vice\nversa.\"\n\n\"There's something in that.\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Well,\" said Archie, judicially, \"this would appear to be,\nas it were, the maddest, merriest day in all the glad New Year, yes,\nno?\"\n\nBill drew a deep breath.\n\n\"You bet your sorrowful existence it is!\" he said. \"I'd like to do\nsomething to celebrate it.\"\n\n\"The right spirit!\" said Archie. \"Absolutely the right spirit! Begin by\npaying for my lunch!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE-SAUSAGE-CHAPPIE-CLICKS\n\n\nRendered restless by relief, Bill Brewster did not linger long at the\nluncheon-table. Shortly after Reggie van Tuyl had retired, he got up and\nannounced his intention of going for a bit of a walk to calm his excited\nmind. Archie dismissed him with a courteous wave of the hand; and,\nbeckoning to the Sausage Chappie, who in his role of waiter was hovering\nnear, requested him to bring the best cigar the hotel could supply. The\npadded seat in which he sat was comfortable; he had no engagements; and\nit seemed to him that a pleasant half-hour could be passed in smoking\ndreamily and watching his fellow-men eat.\n\nThe grill-room had filled up. The Sausage Chappie, having brought Archie\nhis cigar, was attending to a table close by, at which a woman with\na small boy in a sailor suit had seated themselves. The woman was\nengrossed with the bill of fare, but the child's attention seemed\nriveted upon the Sausage Chappie. He was drinking him in with wide eyes.\nHe seemed to be brooding on him.\n\nArchie, too, was brooding on the Sausage Chappie, The latter made an\nexcellent waiter: he was brisk and attentive, and did the work as if\nhe liked it; but Archie was not satisfied. Something seemed to tell him\nthat the man was fitted for higher things. Archie was a grateful soul.\nThat sausage, coming at the end of a five-hour hike, had made a\ndeep impression on his plastic nature. Reason told him that only an\nexceptional man could have parted with half a sausage at such a moment;\nand he could not feel that a job as waiter at a New York hotel was an\nadequate job for an exceptional man. Of course, the root of the trouble\nlay in the fact that the fellow could not remember what his real\nlife-work had been before the war. It was exasperating to reflect, as\nthe other moved away to take his order to the kitchen, that there, for\nall one knew, went the dickens of a lawyer or doctor or architect or\nwhat not.\n\nHis meditations were broken by the voice of the child.\n\n\"Mummie,\" asked the child interestedly, following the Sausage Chappie\nwith his eyes as the latter disappeared towards the kitchen, \"why has\nthat man got such a funny face?\"\n\n\"Hush, darling.\"\n\n\"Yes, but why HAS he?\"\n\n\"I don't know, darling.\"\n\nThe child's faith in the maternal omniscience seemed to have received a\nshock. He had the air of a seeker after truth who has been baffled. His\neyes roamed the room discontentedly.\n\n\"He's got a funnier face than that man there,\" he said, pointing to\nArchie.\n\n\"Hush, darling!\"\n\n\"But he has. Much funnier.\"\n\nIn a way it was a sort of compliment, but Archie felt embarrassed. He\nwithdrew coyly into the cushioned recess. Presently the Sausage Chappie\nreturned, attended to the needs of the woman and the child, and came\nover to Archie. His homely face was beaming.\n\n\"Say, I had a big night last night,\" he said, leaning on the table.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Archie. \"Party or something?\"\n\n\"No, I mean I suddenly began to remember things. Something seems to have\nhappened to the works.\"\n\nArchie sat up excitedly. This was great news.\n\n\"No, really? My dear old lad, this is absolutely topping. This is\npriceless.\"\n\n\"Yessir! First thing I remembered was that I was born at Springfield,\nOhio. It was like a mist starting to lift. Springfield, Ohio. That was\nit. It suddenly came back to me.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yessir! Just before I went to sleep I remembered my name as well.\"\n\nArchie was stirred to his depths.\n\n\"Why, the thing's a walk-over!\" he exclaimed. \"Now you've once got\nstarted, nothing can stop you. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Why, it's--That's funny! It's gone again. I have an idea it began with\nan S. What was it? Skeffington? Skillington?\"\n\n\"Sanderson?\"\n\n\"No; I'll get it in a moment. Cunningham? Carrington? Wilberforce?\nDebenham?\"\n\n\"Dennison?\" suggested Archie, helpfully.--\"No, no, no. It's on the\ntip of my tongue. Barrington? Montgomery? Hepplethwaite? I've got it!\nSmith!\"\n\n\"By Jove! Really?\"\n\n\"Certain of it.\"\n\n\"What's the first name?\"\n\nAn anxious expression came into the man's eyes. He hesitated. He lowered\nhis voice.\n\n\"I have a horrible feeling that it's Lancelot!\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Archie.\n\n\"It couldn't really be that, could it?\"\n\nArchie looked grave. He hated to give pain, but he felt he must be\nhonest.\n\n\"It might,\" he said. \"People give their children all sorts of rummy\nnames. My second name's Tracy. And I have a pal in England who was\nchristened Cuthbert de la Hay Horace. Fortunately everyone calls him\nStinker.\"\n\nThe head-waiter began to drift up like a bank of fog, and the Sausage\nChappie returned to his professional duties. When he came back, he was\nbeaming again.\n\n\"Something else I remembered,\" he said, removing the cover. \"I'm\nmarried!\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"At least I was before the war. She had blue eyes and brown hair and a\nPekingese dog.\"\n\n\"What was her name?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, you're coming on,\" said Archie. \"I'll admit that. You've still\ngot a bit of a way to go before you become like one of those blighters\nwho take the Memory Training Courses in the magazine advertisements--I\nmean to say, you know, the lads who meet a fellow once for five minutes,\nand then come across him again ten years later and grasp him by the hand\nand say, 'Surely this is Mr. Watkins of Seattle?' Still, you're doing\nfine. You only need patience. Everything comes to him who waits.\"\nArchie sat up, electrified. \"I say, by Jove, that's rather good, what!\nEverything comes to him who waits, and you're a waiter, what, what. I\nmean to say, what!\"\n\n\"Mummie,\" said the child at the other table, still speculative, \"do you\nthink something trod on his face?\"\n\n\"Hush, darling.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was bitten by something?\"\n\n\"Eat your nice fish, darling,\" said the mother, who seemed to be one\nof those dull-witted persons whom it is impossible to interest in a\ndiscussion on first causes.\n\nArchie felt stimulated. Not even the advent of his father-in-law, who\ncame in a few moments later and sat down at the other end of the room,\ncould depress his spirits.\n\nThe Sausage Chappie came to his table again.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" he said. \"Like waking up after you've been asleep.\nEverything seems to be getting clearer. The dog's name was Marie. My\nwife's dog, you know. And she had a mole on her chin.\"\n\n\"The dog?\"\n\n\"No. My wife. Little beast! She bit me in the leg once.\"\n\n\"Your wife?\"\n\n\"No. The dog. Good Lord!\" said the Sausage Chappie.\n\nArchie looked up and followed his gaze.\n\nA couple of tables away, next to a sideboard on which the management\nexposed for view the cold meats and puddings and pies mentioned in\nvolume two of the bill of fare (\"Buffet Froid\"), a man and a girl had\njust seated themselves. The man was stout and middle-aged. He bulged\nin practically every place in which a man can bulge, and his head was\nalmost entirely free from hair. The girl was young and pretty. Her eyes\nwere blue. Her hair was brown. She had a rather attractive little mole\non the left side of her chin.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said the Sausage Chappie.\n\n\"Now what?\" said Archie.\n\n\"Who's that? Over at the table there?\"\n\nArchie, through long attendance at the Cosmopolis Grill, knew most of\nthe habitues by sight.\n\n\"That's a man named Gossett. James J. Gossett. He's a motion-picture\nman. You must have seen his name around.\"\n\n\"I don't mean him. Who's the girl?\"\n\n\"I've never seen her before.\"\n\n\"It's my wife!\" said the Sausage Chappie.\n\n\"Your wife!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure!\"\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" said Archie. \"Many happy returns of the day!\"\n\nAt the other table, the girl, unconscious of the drama which was about\nto enter her life, was engrossed in conversation with the stout man. And\nat this moment the stout man leaned forward and patted her on the cheek.\n\nIt was a paternal pat, the pat which a genial uncle might bestow on\na favourite niece, but it did not strike the Sausage Chappie in that\nlight. He had been advancing on the table at a fairly rapid pace, and\nnow, stirred to his depths, he bounded forward with a hoarse cry.\n\nArchie was at some pains to explain to his father-in-law later that, if\nthe management left cold pies and things about all over the place, this\nsort of thing was bound to happen sooner or later. He urged that it\nwas putting temptation in people's way, and that Mr. Brewster had only\nhimself to blame. Whatever the rights of the case, the Buffet Froid\nundoubtedly came in remarkably handy at this crisis in the Sausage\nChappie's life. He had almost reached the sideboard when the stout man\npatted the girl's cheek, and to seize a huckleberry pie was with him the\nwork of a moment. The next instant the pie had whizzed past the other's\nhead and burst like a shell against the wall.\n\nThere are, no doubt, restaurants where this sort of thing would\nhave excited little comment, but the Cosmopolis was not one of them.\nEverybody had something to say, but the only one among those present who\nhad anything sensible to say was the child in the sailor suit.\n\n\"Do it again!\" said the child, cordially.\n\nThe Sausage Chappie did it again. He took up a fruit salad, poised it\nfor a moment, then decanted it over Mr. Gossett's bald head. The child's\nhappy laughter rang over the restaurant. Whatever anybody else might\nthink of the affair, this child liked it and was prepared to go on\nrecord to that effect.\n\nEpic events have a stunning quality. They paralyse the faculties. For\na moment there was a pause. The world stood still. Mr. Brewster bubbled\ninarticulately. Mr. Gossett dried himself sketchily with a napkin. The\nSausage Chappie snorted.\n\nThe girl had risen to her feet and was staring wildly.\n\n\"John!\" she cried.\n\nEven at this moment of crisis the Sausage Chappie was able to look\nrelieved.\n\n\"So it is!\" he said. \"And I thought it was Lancelot!\"\n\n\"I thought you were dead!\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" said the Sausage Chappie.\n\nMr. Gossett, speaking thickly through the fruit-salad, was understood\nto say that he regretted this. And then confusion broke loose again.\nEverybody began to talk at once.\n\n\"I say!\" said Archie. \"I say! One moment!\"\n\nOf the first stages of this interesting episode Archie had been a\nparalysed spectator. The thing had numbed him. And then--\n\n     Sudden a thought came, like a full-blown rose.\n     Flushing his brow.\n\nWhen he reached the gesticulating group, he was calm and business-like.\nHe had a constructive policy to suggest.\n\n\"I say,\" he said. \"I've got an idea!\"\n\n\"Go away!\" said Mr. Brewster. \"This is bad enough without you butting\nin.\"\n\nArchie quelled him with a gesture.\n\n\"Leave us,\" he said. \"We would be alone. I want to have a little\nbusiness-talk with Mr. Gossett.\" He turned to the movie-magnate, who\nwas gradually emerging from the fruit-salad rather after the manner of\na stout Venus rising from the sea. \"Can you spare me a moment of your\nvaluable time?\"\n\n\"I'll have him arrested!\"\n\n\"Don't you do it, laddie. Listen!\"\n\n\"The man's mad. Throwing pies!\"\n\nArchie attached himself to his coat-button.\n\n\"Be calm, laddie. Calm and reasonable!\"\n\nFor the first time Mr. Gossett seemed to become aware that what he had\nbeen looking on as a vague annoyance was really an individual.\n\n\"Who the devil are you?\"\n\nArchie drew himself up with dignity.\n\n\"I am this gentleman's representative,\" he replied, indicating the\nSausage Chappie with a motion of the hand. \"His jolly old personal\nrepresentative. I act for him. And on his behalf I have a pretty ripe\nproposition to lay before you. Reflect, dear old bean,\" he proceeded\nearnestly. \"Are you going to let this chance slip? The opportunity of a\nlifetime which will not occur again. By Jove, you ought to rise up and\nembrace this bird. You ought to clasp the chappie to your bosom! He has\nthrown pies at you, hasn't he? Very well. You are a movie-magnate. Your\nwhole fortune is founded on chappies who throw pies. You probably scour\nthe world for chappies who throw pies. Yet, when one comes right to you\nwithout any fuss or trouble and demonstrates before your very eyes the\nfact that he is without a peer as a pie-propeller, you get the wind up\nand talk about having him arrested. Consider! (There's a bit of cherry\njust behind your left ear.) Be sensible. Why let your personal feeling\nstand in the way of doing yourself a bit of good? Give this chappie a\njob and give it him quick, or we go elsewhere. Did you ever see Fatty\nArbuckle handle pastry with a surer touch? Has Charlie Chaplin got this\nfellow's speed and control. Absolutely not. I tell you, old friend,\nyou're in danger of throwing away a good thing!\"\n\nHe paused. The Sausage Chappie beamed.\n\n\"I've aways wanted to go into the movies,\" he said. \"I was an actor\nbefore the war. Just remembered.\"\n\nMr. Brewster attempted to speak. Archie waved him down.\n\n\"How many times have I got to tell you not to butt in?\" he said,\nseverely.\n\nMr. Gossett's militant demeanour had become a trifle modified during\nArchie's harangue. First and foremost a man of business, Mr. Gossett was\nnot insensible to the arguments which had been put forward. He brushed a\nslice of orange from the back of his neck, and mused awhile.\n\n\"How do I know this fellow would screen well?\" he said, at length.\n\n\"Screen well!\" cried Archie. \"Of course he'll screen well. Look at\nhis face. I ask you! The map! I call your attention to it.\" He turned\napologetically to the Sausage Chappie. \"Awfully sorry, old lad, for\ndwelling on this, but it's business, you know.\" He turned to Mr.\nGossett. \"Did you ever see a face like that? Of course not. Why should\nI, as this gentleman's personal representative, let a face like that go\nto waste? There's a fortune in it. By Jove, I'll give you two minutes to\nthink the thing over, and, if you don't talk business then, I'll jolly\nwell take my man straight round to Mack Sennett or someone. We don't\nhave to ask for jobs. We consider offers.\"\n\nThere was a silence. And then the clear voice of the child in the sailor\nsuit made itself heard again.\n\n\"Mummie!\"\n\n\"Yes, darling?\"\n\n\"Is the man with the funny face going to throw any more pies?\"\n\n\"No, darling.\"\n\nThe child uttered a scream of disappointed fury.\n\n\"I want the funny man to throw some more pies! I want the funny man to\nthrow some more pies!\"\n\nA look almost of awe came into Mr. Gossett's face. He had heard the\nvoice of the Public. He had felt the beating of the Public's pulse.\n\n\"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,\" he said, picking a piece of\nbanana off his right eyebrow, \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.\nCome round to my office!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE GROWING BOY\n\n\nThe lobby of the Cosmopolis Hotel was a favourite stamping-ground of Mr.\nDaniel Brewster, its proprietor. He liked to wander about there, keeping\na paternal eye on things, rather in the manner of the Jolly Innkeeper\n(hereinafter to be referred to as Mine Host) of the old-fashioned novel.\nCustomers who, hurrying in to dinner, tripped over Mr. Brewster, were\napt to mistake him for the hotel detective--for his eye was keen and\nhis aspect a trifle austere--but, nevertheless, he was being as jolly an\ninnkeeper as he knew how. His presence in the lobby supplied a personal\ntouch to the Cosmopolis which other New York hotels lacked, and it\nundeniably made the girl at the book-stall extraordinarily civil to her\nclients, which was all to the good.\n\nMost of the time Mr. Brewster stood in one spot and just looked\nthoughtful; but now and again he would wander to the marble slab behind\nwhich he kept the desk-clerk and run his eye over the register, to see\nwho had booked rooms--like a child examining the stocking on Christmas\nmorning to ascertain what Santa Claus had brought him.\n\nAs a rule, Mr. Brewster concluded this performance by shoving the book\nback across the marble slab and resuming his meditations. But one night\na week or two after the Sausage Chappie's sudden restoration to the\nnormal, he varied this procedure by starting rather violently, turning\npurple, and uttering an exclamation which was manifestly an exclamation\nof chagrin. He turned abruptly and cannoned into Archie, who, in company\nwith Lucille, happened to be crossing the lobby at the moment on his way\nto dine in their suite.\n\nMr. Brewster apologised gruffly; then, recognising his victim, seemed to\nregret having done so.\n\n\"Oh, it's you! Why can't you look where you're going?\" he demanded. He\nhad suffered much from his son-in-law.\n\n\"Frightfully sorry,\" said Archie, amiably. \"Never thought you were going\nto fox-trot backwards all over the fairway.\"\n\n\"You mustn't bully Archie,\" said Lucille, severely, attaching herself\nto her father's back hair and giving it a punitive tug, \"because he's an\nangel, and I love him, and you must learn to love him, too.\"\n\n\"Give you lessons at a reasonable rate,\" murmured Archie.\n\nMr. Brewster regarded his young relative with a lowering eye.\n\n\"What's the matter, father darling?\" asked Lucille. \"You seem upset\"\n\n\"I am upset!\" Mr. Brewster snorted. \"Some people have got a nerve!\" He\nglowered forbiddingly at an inoffensive young man in a light overcoat\nwho had just entered, and the young man, though his conscience was quite\nclear and Mr. Brewster an entire stranger to him, stopped dead, blushed,\nand went out again--to dine elsewhere. \"Some people have got the nerve\nof an army mule!\"\n\n\"Why, what's happened?\"\n\n\"Those darned McCalls have registered here!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Bit beyond me, this,\" said Archie, insinuating himself into the\nconversation. \"Deep waters and what not! Who are the McCalls?\"\n\n\"Some people father dislikes,\" said Lucille. \"And they've chosen his\nhotel to stop at. But, father dear, you mustn't mind. It's really a\ncompliment. They've come because they know it's the best hotel in New\nYork.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said Archie. \"Good accommodation for man and beast! All\nthe comforts of home! Look on the bright side, old bean. No good getting\nthe wind up. Cherrio, old companion!\"\n\n\"Don't call me old companion!\"\n\n\"Eh, what? Oh, right-o!\"\n\nLucille steered her husband out of the danger zone, and they entered the\nlift.\n\n\"Poor father!\" she said, as they went to their suite, \"it's a shame.\nThey must have done it to annoy him. This man McCall has a place next to\nsome property father bought in Westchester, and he's bringing a law-suit\nagainst father about a bit of land which he claims belongs to him. He\nmight have had the tact to go to another hotel. But, after all, I don't\nsuppose it was the poor little fellow's fault. He does whatever his wife\ntells him to.\"\n\n\"We all do that,\" said Archie the married man.\n\nLucille eyed him fondly.\n\n\"Isn't it a shame, precious, that all husbands haven't nice wives like\nme?\"\n\n\"When I think of you, by Jove,\" said Archie, fervently, \"I want to\nbabble, absolutely babble!\"\n\n\"Oh, I was telling you about the McCalls. Mr. McCall is one of those\nlittle, meek men, and his wife's one of those big, bullying women. It\nwas she who started all the trouble with father. Father and Mr. McCall\nwere very fond of each other till she made him begin the suit. I feel\nsure she made him come to this hotel just to annoy father. Still,\nthey've probably taken the most expensive suite in the place, which is\nsomething.\"\n\nArchie was at the telephone. His mood was now one of quiet peace. Of\nall the happenings which went to make up existence in New York, he liked\nbest the cosy tete-a-tete dinners with Lucille in their suite, which,\nowing to their engagements--for Lucille was a popular girl, with many\nfriends--occurred all too seldom.\n\n\"Touching now the question of browsing and sluicing,\" he said. \"I'll be\ngetting them to send along a waiter.\"\n\n\"Oh, good gracious!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I've just remembered. I promised faithfully I would go and see Jane\nMurchison to-day. And I clean forgot. I must rush.\"\n\n\"But light of my soul, we are about to eat. Pop around and see her after\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I can't. She's going to a theatre to-night.\"\n\n\"Give her the jolly old miss-in-baulk, then, for the nonce, and spring\nround to-morrow.\"\n\n\"She's sailing for England to-morrow morning, early. No, I must go and\nsee her now. What a shame! She's sure to make me stop to dinner, I tell\nyou what. Order something for me, and, if I'm not back in half an hour,\nstart.\"\n\n\"Jane Murchison,\" said Archie, \"is a bally nuisance.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I've known her since she was eight.\"\n\n\"If her parents had had any proper feeling,\" said Archie, \"they would\nhave drowned her long before that.\"\n\nHe unhooked the receiver, and asked despondently to be connected\nwith Room Service. He thought bitterly of the exigent Jane, whom he\nrecollected dimly as a tall female with teeth. He half thought of going\ndown to the grill-room on the chance of finding a friend there, but the\nwaiter was on his way to the room. He decided that he might as well stay\nwhere he was.\n\nThe waiter arrived, booked the order, and departed. Archie had just\ncompleted his toilet after a shower-bath when a musical clinking without\nannounced the advent of the meal. He opened the door. The waiter was\nthere with a table congested with things under covers, from which\nescaped a savoury and appetising odour. In spite of his depression,\nArchie's soul perked up a trifle.\n\nSuddenly he became aware that he was not the only person present who\nwas deriving enjoyment from the scent of the meal. Standing beside the\nwaiter and gazing wistfully at the foodstuffs was a long, thin boy of\nabout sixteen. He was one of those boys who seem all legs and knuckles.\nHe had pale red hair, sandy eyelashes, and a long neck; and his eyes, as\nhe removed them from the-table and raised them to Archie's, had a hungry\nlook. He reminded Archie of a half-grown, half-starved hound.\n\n\"That smells good!\" said the long boy. He inhaled deeply. \"Yes, sir,\" he\ncontinued, as one whose mind is definitely made up, \"that smells good!\"\n\nBefore Archie could reply, the telephone bell rang. It was Lucille,\nconfirming her prophecy that the pest Jane would insist on her staying\nto dine.\n\n\"Jane,\" said Archie, into the telephone, \"is a pot of poison. The waiter\nis here now, setting out a rich banquet, and I shall have to eat two of\neverything by myself.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver, and, turning, met the pale eye of the long boy,\nwho had propped himself up in the doorway.\n\n\"Were you expecting somebody to dinner?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Why, yes, old friend, I was.\"\n\n\"I wish--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\nThe waiter left. The long boy hitched his back more firmly against the\ndoorpost, and returned to his original theme.\n\n\"That surely does smell good!\" He basked a moment in the aroma. \"Yes,\nsir! I'll tell the world it does!\"\n\nArchie was not an abnormally rapid thinker, but he began at this point\nto get a clearly defined impression that this lad, if invited, would\nwaive the formalities and consent to join his meal. Indeed, the idea\nArchie got was that, if he were not invited pretty soon, he would invite\nhimself.\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"It doesn't smell bad, what!\"\n\n\"It smells GOOD!\" said the boy. \"Oh, doesn't it! Wake me up in the night\nand ask me if it doesn't!\"\n\n\"Poulet en casserole,\" said Archie.\n\n\"Golly!\" said the boy, reverently.\n\nThere was a pause. The situation began to seem to Archie a trifle\ndifficult. He wanted to start his meal, but it began to appear that he\nmust either do so under the penetrating gaze of his new friend or else\neject the latter forcibly. The boy showed no signs of ever wanting to\nleave the doorway.\n\n\"You've dined, I suppose, what?\" said Archie.\n\n\"I never dine.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Not really dine, I mean. I only get vegetables and nuts and things.\"\n\n\"Dieting?\"\n\n\"Mother is.\"\n\n\"I don't absolutely catch the drift, old bean,\" said Archie. The boy\nsniffed with half-closed eyes as a wave of perfume from the poulet en\ncasserole floated past him. He seemed to be anxious to intercept as much\nof it as possible before it got through the door.\n\n\"Mother's a food-reformer,\" he vouchsafed. \"She lectures on it. She\nmakes Pop and me live on vegetables and nuts and things.\"\n\nArchie was shocked. It was like listening to a tale from the abyss.\n\n\"My dear old chap, you must suffer agonies--absolute shooting pains!\"\nHe had no hesitation now. Common humanity pointed out his course. \"Would\nyou care to join me in a bite now?\"\n\n\"Would I!\" The boy smiled a wan smile. \"Would I! Just stop me on the\nstreet and ask me!\"\n\n\"Come on in, then,\" said Archie, rightly taking this peculiar phrase\nfor a formal acceptance. \"And close the door. The fatted calf is getting\ncold.\"\n\nArchie was not a man with a wide visiting-list among people with\nfamilies, and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action\nat the table that he had forgotten what sixteen is capable of doing\nwith a knife and fork, when it really squares its elbows, takes a\ndeep breath, and gets going. The spectacle which he witnessed was\nconsequently at first a little unnerving. The long boy's idea of\ntrifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out\nfor more. He ate like a starving Eskimo. Archie, in the time he had\nspent in the trenches making the world safe for the working-man to\nstrike in, had occasionally been quite peckish, but he sat dazed before\nthis majestic hunger. This was real eating.\n\nThere was little conversation. The growing boy evidently did not believe\nin table-talk when he could use his mouth for more practical purposes.\nIt was not until the final roll had been devoured to its last crumb that\nthe guest found leisure to address his host. Then he leaned back with a\ncontented sigh.\n\n\"Mother,\" said the human python, \"says you ought to chew every mouthful\nthirty-three times....\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! Thirty-three times!\" He sighed again, \"I haven't ever had\nmeal like that.\"\n\n\"All right, was it, what?\"\n\n\"Was it! Was it! Call me up on the 'phone and ask me!-Yes, sir!-Mother's\ntipped off these darned waiters not to serve-me anything but vegetables\nand nuts and things, darn it!\"\n\n\"The mater seems to have drastic ideas about the good old feed-bag,\nwhat!\"\n\n\"I'll say she has! Pop hates it as much as me, but he's scared to kick.\nMother says vegetables contain all the proteins you want. Mother says,\nif you eat meat, your blood-pressure goes all blooey. Do you think it\ndoes?\"\n\n\"Mine seems pretty well in the pink.\"\n\n\"She's great on talking,\" conceded the boy. \"She's out to-night\nsomewhere, giving a lecture on Rational Eating to some ginks. I'll\nhave to be slipping up to our suite before she gets back.\" He rose,\nsluggishly. \"That isn't a bit of roll under that napkin, is it?\" he\nasked, anxiously.\n\nArchie raised the napkin.\n\n\"No. Nothing of that species.\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" said the boy, resignedly. \"Then I believe I'll be going.\nThanks very much for the dinner.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, old top. Come again if you're ever trickling round in this\ndirection.\"\n\nThe long boy removed himself slowly, loath to leave. At the door he cast\nan affectionate glance back at the table.\n\n\"Some meal!\" he said, devoutly. \"Considerable meal!\"\n\nArchie lit a cigarette. He felt like a Boy Scout who has done his day's\nAct of Kindness.\n\nOn the following morning it chanced that Archie needed a fresh supply\nof tobacco. It was his custom, when this happened, to repair to a small\nshop on Sixth Avenue which he had discovered accidentally in the course\nof his rambles about the great city. His relations with Jno. Blake, the\nproprietor, were friendly and intimate. The discovery that Mr. Blake\nwas English and had, indeed, until a few years back maintained an\nestablishment only a dozen doors or so from Archie's London club, had\nserved as a bond.\n\nTo-day he found Mr. Blake in a depressed mood. The tobacconist was a\nhearty, red-faced man, who looked like an English sporting publican--the\nkind of man who wears a fawn-coloured top-coat and drives to the Derby\nin a dog-cart; and usually there seemed to be nothing on his mind\nexcept the vagaries of the weather, concerning which he was a great\nconversationalist. But now moodiness had claimed him for its own.\nAfter a short and melancholy \"Good morning,\" he turned to the task of\nmeasuring out the tobacco in silence.\n\nArchie's sympathetic nature was perturbed.--\"What's the matter, laddie?\"\nhe enquired. \"You would seem to be feeling a bit of an onion this bright\nmorning, what, yes, no? I can see it with the naked eye.\"\n\nMr. Blake grunted sorrowfully.\n\n\"I've had a knock, Mr. Moffam.\"\n\n\"Tell me all, friend of my youth.\"\n\nMr. Blake, with a jerk of his thumb, indicated a poster which hung on\nthe wall behind the counter. Archie had noticed it as he came in, for\nit was designed to attract the eye. It was printed in black letters on a\nyellow ground, and ran as follows:\n\n               CLOVER-LEAF SOCIAL AND OUTING CLUB\n\n                         GRAND CONTEST\n\n            PIE-EATING CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WEST SIDE\n\n                         SPIKE O'DOWD\n                          (Champion)\n\n                              v.\n\n                       BLAKE'S UNKNOWN\n\n                  FOR A PURSE OF $50 AND SIDE-BET\n\nArchie examined this document gravely. It conveyed nothing to him\nexcept--what he had long suspected--that his sporting-looking friend had\nsporting blood as well as that kind of exterior. He expressed a kindly\nhope that the other's Unknown would bring home the bacon.\n\nMr. Blake laughed one of those hollow, mirthless laughs.\n\n\"There ain't any blooming Unknown,\" he said, bitterly. This man had\nplainly suffered. \"Yesterday, yes, but not now.\"\n\nArchie sighed.\n\n\"In the midst of life--Dead?\" he enquired, delicately.\n\n\"As good as,\" replied the stricken tobacconist. He cast aside his\nartificial restraint and became voluble. Archie was one of those\nsympathetic souls in whom even strangers readily confided their most\nintimate troubles. He was to those in travail of spirit very much what\ncatnip is to a cat. \"It's 'ard, sir, it's blooming 'ard! I'd got the\nevent all sewed up in a parcel, and now this young feller-me-lad 'as to\ngive me the knock. This lad of mine--sort of cousin 'e is; comes from\nLondon, like you and me--'as always 'ad, ever since he landed in this\ncountry, a most amazing knack of stowing away grub. 'E'd been a bit\nunderfed these last two or three years over in the old country, what\nwith food restrictions and all, and 'e took to the food over 'ere\namazing. I'd 'ave backed 'im against a ruddy orstridge! Orstridge! I'd\n'ave backed 'im against 'arff a dozen orstridges--take 'em on one\nafter the other in the same ring on the same evening--and given 'em a\nhandicap, too! 'E was a jewel, that boy. I've seen him polish off four\npounds of steak and mealy potatoes and then look round kind of wolfish,\nas much as to ask when dinner was going to begin! That's the kind of a\nlad 'e was till this very morning. 'E would have out-swallowed this 'ere\nO'Dowd without turning a hair, as a relish before 'is tea! I'd got a\ncouple of 'undred dollars on 'im, and thought myself lucky to get the\nodds. And now--\"\n\nMr. Blake relapsed into a tortured silence.\n\n\"But what's the matter with the blighter? Why can't he go over the top?\nHas he got indigestion?\"\n\n\"Indigestion?\" Mr. Blaife laughed another of his hollow laughs. \"You\ncouldn't give that boy indigestion if you fed 'im in on safety-razor\nblades. Religion's more like what 'e's got.\"\n\n\"Religion?\"\n\n\"Well, you can call it that. Seems last night, instead of goin' and\nresting 'is mind at a picture-palace like I told him to, 'e sneaked off\nto some sort of a lecture down on Eighth Avenue. 'E said 'e'd seen a\npiece about it in the papers, and it was about Rational Eating, and that\nkind of attracted 'im. 'E sort of thought 'e might pick up a few hints,\nlike. 'E didn't know what rational eating was, but it sounded to 'im as\nif it must be something to do with food, and 'e didn't want to miss it.\n'E came in here just now,\" said Mr. Blake, dully, \"and 'e was a changed\nlad! Scared to death 'e was! Said the way 'e'd been goin' on in the\npast, it was a wonder 'e'd got any stummick left! It was a lady that\ngive the lecture, and this boy said it was amazing what she told 'em\nabout blood-pressure and things 'e didn't even know 'e 'ad. She showed\n'em pictures, coloured pictures, of what 'appens inside the injudicious\neater's stummick who doesn't chew his food, and it was like a\nbattlefield! 'E said 'e would no more think of eatin' a lot of pie than\n'e would of shootin' 'imself, and anyhow eating pie would be a quicker\ndeath. I reasoned with 'im, Mr. Moffam, with tears in my eyes. I asked\n'im was he goin' to chuck away fame and wealth just because a woman\nwho didn't know what she was talking about had shown him a lot of faked\npictures. But there wasn't any doin' anything with him. 'E give me the\nknock and 'opped it down the street to buy nuts.\" Mr. Blake moaned. \"Two\n'undred dollars and more gone pop, not to talk of the fifty dollars 'e\nwould have won and me to get twenty-five of!\"\n\nArchie took his tobacco and walked pensively back to the hotel. He was\nfond of Jno. Blake, and grieved for the trouble that had come upon him.\nIt was odd, he felt, how things seemed to link themselves up together.\nThe woman who had delivered the fateful lecture to injudicious eaters\ncould not be other than the mother of his young guest of last night. An\nuncomfortable woman! Not content with starving her own family--Archie\nstopped in his tracks. A pedestrian, walking behind him, charged into\nhis back, but Archie paid no attention. He had had one of those sudden,\nluminous ideas, which help a man who does not do much thinking as a rule\nto restore his average. He stood there for a moment, almost dizzy at the\nbrilliance of his thoughts; then hurried on. Napoleon, he mused as he\nwalked, must have felt rather like this after thinking up a hot one to\nspring on the enemy.\n\nAs if Destiny were suiting her plans to his, one of the first persons he\nsaw as he entered the lobby of the Cosmopolis was the long boy. He was\nstanding at the bookstall, reading as much of a morning paper as could\nbe read free under the vigilant eyes of the presiding girl. Both he and\nshe were observing the unwritten rules which govern these affairs--to\nwit, that you may read without interference as much as can be read\nwithout touching the paper. If you touch the paper, you lose, and have\nto buy.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" said Archie. \"Here we are again, what!\" He prodded\nthe boy amiably in the lower ribs. \"You're just the chap I was looking\nfor. Got anything on for the time being?\"\n\nThe boy said he had no engagements.\n\n\"Then I want you to stagger round with me to a chappie I know on Sixth\nAvenue. It's only a couple of blocks away. I think I can do you a bit of\ngood. Put you on to something tolerably ripe, if you know what I mean.\nTrickle along, laddie. You don't need a hat.\"\n\nThey found Mr. Blake brooding over his troubles in an empty shop.\n\n\"Cheer up, old thing!\" said Archie. \"The relief expedition has arrived.\"\nHe directed his companion's gaze to the poster. \"Cast your eye over\nthat. How does that strike you?\"\n\nThe long boy scanned the poster. A gleam appeared in his rather dull\neye.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Some people have all the luck!\" said the long boy, feelingly.\n\n\"Would you like to compete, what?\"\n\nThe boy smiled a sad smile.\n\n\"Would I! Would I! Say!...\"\n\n\"I know,\" interrupted Archie. \"Wake you up in the night and ask you! I\nknew I could rely on you, old thing.\" He turned to Mr. Blake. \"Here's\nthe fellow you've been wanting to meet. The finest left-and-right-hand\neater east of the Rockies! He'll fight the good fight for you.\"\n\nMr. Blake's English training had not been wholly overcome by residence\nin New York. He still retained a nice eye for the distinctions of class.\n\n\"But this is young gentleman's a young gentleman,\" he urged, doubtfully,\nyet with hope shining in his eye. \"He wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"Of course, he would. Don't be ridic, old thing.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't do what?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Why save the old homestead by taking on the champion. Dashed sad case,\nbetween ourselves! This poor egg's nominee has given him the raspberry\nat the eleventh hour, and only you can save him. And you owe it to him\nto do something you know, because it was your jolly old mater's lecture\nlast night that made the nominee quit. You must charge in and take his\nplace. Sort of poetic justice, don't you know, and what not!\" He turned\nto Mr. Blake. \"When is the conflict supposed to start? Two-thirty? You\nhaven't any important engagement for two-thirty, have you?\"\n\n\"No. Mother's lunching at some ladies' club, and giving a lecture\nafterwards. I can slip away.\"\n\nArchie patted his head.\n\n\"Then leg it where glory waits you, old bean!\"\n\nThe long boy was gazing earnestly at the poster. It seemed to fascinate\nhim.\n\n\"Pie!\" he said in a hushed voice.\n\nThe word was like a battle-cry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. WASHY STEPS INTO THE HALL OF FAME\n\n\nAt about nine o'clock next morning, in a suite at the Hotel Cosmopolis,\nMrs. Cora Bates McCall, the eminent lecturer on Rational Eating, was\nseated at breakfast with her family. Before her sat Mr. McCall, a\nlittle hunted-looking man, the natural peculiarities of whose face were\naccentuated by a pair of glasses of semicircular shape, like half-moons\nwith the horns turned up. Behind these, Mr. McCall's eyes played a\nperpetual game of peekaboo, now peering over them, anon ducking down and\nhiding behind them. He was sipping a cup of anti-caffeine. On his right,\ntoying listlessly with a plateful of cereal, sat his son, Washington.\nMrs. McCall herself was eating a slice of Health Bread and nut butter.\nFor she practised as well as preached the doctrines which she had\nstriven for so many years to inculcate in an unthinking populace. Her\nday always began with a light but nutritious breakfast, at which a\npeculiarly uninviting cereal, which looked and tasted like an old straw\nhat that had been run through a meat chopper, competed for first place\nin the dislike of her husband and son with a more than usually offensive\nbrand of imitation coffee. Mr. McCall was inclined to think that he\nloathed the imitation coffee rather more than the cereal, but Washington\nheld strong views on the latter's superior ghastliness. Both Washington\nand his father, however, would have been fair-minded enough to admit\nthat it was a close thing.\n\nMrs. McCall regarded her offspring with grave approval.\n\n\"I am glad to see, Lindsay,\" she said to her husband, whose eyes sprang\ndutifully over the glass fence as he heard his name, \"that Washy has\nrecovered his appetite. When he refused his dinner last night, I was\nafraid that he might be sickening for something. Especially as he had\nquite a flushed look. You noticed his flushed look?\"\n\n\"He did look flushed.\"\n\n\"Very flushed. And his breathing was almost stertorous. And, when he\nsaid that he had no appetite, I am bound to say that I was anxious. But\nhe is evidently perfectly well this morning. You do feel perfectly well\nthis morning, Washy?\"\n\nThe heir of the McCall's looked up from his cereal. He was a long, thin\nboy of about sixteen, with pale red hair, sandy eyelashes, and a long\nneck.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" he said.\n\nMrs. McCall nodded.\n\n\"Surely now you will agree, Lindsay, that a careful and rational diet\nis what a boy needs? Washy's constitution is superb. He has a remarkable\nstamina, and I attribute it entirely to my careful supervision of his\nfood. I shudder when I think of the growing boys who are permitted by\nirresponsible people to devour meat, candy, pie--\" She broke off. \"What\nis the matter, Washy?\"\n\nIt seemed that the habit of shuddering at the thought of pie ran in the\nMcCall family, for at the mention of the word a kind of internal shimmy\nhad convulsed Washington's lean frame, and over his face there had come\nan expression that was almost one of pain. He had been reaching out\nhis hand for a slice of Health Bread, but now he withdrew it rather\nhurriedly and sat back breathing hard.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said, huskily.\n\n\"Pie,\" proceeded Mrs. McCall, in her platform voice. She stopped again\nabruptly. \"Whatever is the matter, Washington? You are making me feel\nnervous.\"\n\n\"I'm all right.\"\n\nMrs. McCall had lost the thread of her remarks. Moreover, having now\nfinished her breakfast, she was inclined for a little light reading. One\nof the subjects allied to the matter of dietary on which she felt deeply\nwas the question of reading at meals. She was of the opinion that the\nstrain on the eye, coinciding with the strain on the digestion, could\nnot fail to give the latter the short end of the contest; and it was a\nrule at her table that the morning paper should not even be glanced at\ntill the conclusion of the meal. She said that it was upsetting to begin\nthe day by reading the paper, and events were to prove that she was\noccasionally right.\n\nAll through breakfast the New York Chronicle had been lying neatly\nfolded beside her plate. She now opened it, and, with a remark about\nlooking for the report of her yesterday's lecture at the Butterfly Club,\ndirected her gaze at the front page, on which she hoped that an editor\nwith the best interests of the public at heart had decided to place her.\n\nMr. McCall, jumping up and down behind his glasses, scrutinised her face\nclosely as she began to read. He always did this on these occasions, for\nnone knew better than he that his comfort for the day depended\nlargely on some unknown reporter whom he had never met. If this unseen\nindividual had done his work properly and as befitted the importance of\nhis subject, Mrs. McCall's mood for the next twelve hours would be\nas uniformly sunny as it was possible for it to be. But sometimes the\nfellows scamped their job disgracefully; and once, on a day which lived\nin Mr. McCall's memory, they had failed to make a report at all.\n\nTo-day, he noted with relief, all seemed to be well. The report\nactually was on the front page, an honour rarely accorded to his wife's\nutterances. Moreover, judging from the time it took her to read the\nthing, she had evidently been reported at length.\n\n\"Good, my dear?\" he ventured. \"Satisfactory?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Mrs. McCall smiled meditatively. \"Oh, yes, excellent. They have\nused my photograph, too. Not at all badly reproduced.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Mr. McCall.\n\nMrs. McCall gave a sharp shriek, and the paper fluttered from her hand.\n\n\"My dear!\" said Mr. McCall, with concern.\n\nHis wife had recovered the paper, and was reading with burning eyes. A\nbright wave of colour had flowed over her masterful features. She was\nbreathing as stertorously as ever her son Washington had done on the\nprevious night.\n\n\"Washington!\"\n\nA basilisk glare shot across the table and turned the long boy to\nstone--all except his mouth, which opened feebly.\n\n\"Washington! Is this true?\"\n\nWashy closed his mouth, then let it slowly open again.\n\n\"My dear!\" Mr. McCall's voice was alarmed. \"What is it?\" His eyes had\nclimbed up over his glasses and remained there. \"What is the matter? Is\nanything wrong?\"\n\n\"Wrong! Read for yourself!\"\n\nMr. McCall was completely mystified. He could not even formulate a\nguess at the cause of the trouble. That it appeared to concern his son\nWashington seemed to be the one solid fact at his disposal, and that\nonly made the matter still more puzzling. Where, Mr. McCall asked\nhimself, did Washington come in?\n\nHe looked at the paper, and received immediate enlightenment. Headlines\nmet his eyes:\n\n                  GOOD STUFF IN THIS BOY.\n                    ABOUT A TON OF IT.\n                 SON OF CORA BATES McCALL\n               FAMOUS FOOD-REFORM LECTURER\n             WINS PIE-EATING CHAMPIONSHIP OF\n                       WEST SIDE.\n\nThere followed a lyrical outburst. So uplifted had the reporter\nevidently felt by the importance of his news that he had been unable to\nconfine himself to prose:--\n\n\n\n     My children, if you fail to shine or triumph in your\n     special line; if, let us say, your hopes are bent on\n     some day being President, and folks ignore your proper\n     worth, and say you've not a chance on earth--Cheer up!\n     for in these stirring days Fame may be won in many ways.\n     Consider, when your spirits fall, the case of Washington\n     McCall.\n\n     Yes, cast your eye on Washy, please! He looks just like\n     a piece of cheese: he's not a brilliant sort of chap: he\n     has a dull and vacant map: his eyes are blank, his face\n     is red, his ears stick out beside his head. In fact, to\n     end these compliments, he would be dear at thirty cents.\n     Yet Fame has welcomed to her Hall this self-same\n     Washington McCall.\n\n     His mother (nee Miss Cora Bates) is one who frequently\n     orates upon the proper kind of food which every menu\n     should include. With eloquence the world she weans from\n     chops and steaks and pork and beans. Such horrid things\n     she'd like to crush, and make us live on milk and mush.\n     But oh! the thing that makes her sigh is when she sees\n     us eating pie. (We heard her lecture last July upon \"The\n     Nation's Menace--Pie.\") Alas, the hit it made was small\n     with Master Washington McCall.\n\n     For yesterday we took a trip to see the great Pie\n     Championship, where men with bulging cheeks and eyes\n     consume vast quantities of pies. A fashionable West Side\n     crowd beheld the champion, Spike O'Dowd, endeavour to\n     defend his throne against an upstart, Blake's Unknown.\n     He wasn't an Unknown at all. He was young Washington\n     McCall.\n\n     We freely own we'd give a leg if we could borrow, steal,\n     or beg the skill old Homer used to show. (He wrote the\n     Iliad, you know.) Old Homer swung a wicked pen, but we\n     are ordinary men, and cannot even start to dream of\n     doing justice to our theme. The subject of that great\n     repast is too magnificent and vast. We can't describe\n     (or even try) the way those rivals wolfed their pie.\n     Enough to say that, when for hours each had extended all\n     his pow'rs, toward the quiet evenfall O'Dowd succumbed\n     to young McCall.\n\n     The champion was a willing lad. He gave the public all\n     he had. His was a genuine fighting soul. He'd lots of\n     speed and much control. No yellow streak did he evince.\n     He tackled apple-pie and mince. This was the motto on\n     his shield--\"O'Dowds may burst. They never yield.\" His\n     eyes began to start and roll. He eased his belt another\n     hole. Poor fellow! With a single glance one saw that he\n     had not a chance. A python would have had to crawl and\n     own defeat from young McCall.\n\n     At last, long last, the finish came. His features\n     overcast with shame, O'Dowd, who'd faltered once or\n     twice, declined to eat another slice. He tottered off,\n     and kindly men rallied around with oxygen. But Washy,\n     Cora Bates's son, seemed disappointed it was done. He\n     somehow made those present feel he'd barely started on\n     his meal. We ask him, \"Aren't you feeling bad?\" \"Me!\"\n     said the lion-hearted lad. \"Lead me\"--he started for the\n     street--\"where I can get a bite to eat!\" Oh, what a\n     lesson does it teach to all of us, that splendid speech!\n     How better can the curtain fall on Master Washington\n     McCall!\n\n\nMr. McCall read this epic through, then he looked at his son. He first\nlooked at him over his glasses, then through his glasses, then over his\nglasses again, then through his glasses once more. A curious expression\nwas in his eyes. If such a thing had not been so impossible, one would\nhave said that his gaze had in it something of respect, of admiration,\neven of reverence.\n\n\"But how did they find out your name?\" he asked, at length.\n\nMrs. McCall exclaimed impatiently.\n\n\"Is THAT all you have to say?\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear, of course not, quite so. But the point struck me as\ncurious.\"\n\n\"Wretched boy,\" cried Mrs. McCall, \"were you insane enough to reveal\nyour name?\"\n\nWashington wriggled uneasily. Unable to endure the piercing stare of\nhis mother, he had withdrawn to the window, and was looking out with his\nback turned. But even there he could feel her eyes on the back of his\nneck.\n\n\"I didn't think it 'ud matter,\" he mumbled. \"A fellow with\ntortoiseshell-rimmed specs asked me, so I told him. How was I to know--\"\n\nHis stumbling defence was cut short by the opening of the door.\n\n\"Hallo-allo-allo! What ho! What ho!\"\n\nArchie was standing in the doorway, beaming ingratiatingly on the\nfamily.\n\nThe apparition of an entire stranger served to divert the lightning\nof Mrs. McCall's gaze from the unfortunate Washy. Archie, catching\nit between the eyes, blinked and held on to the wall. He had begun\nto regret that he had yielded so weakly to Lucille's entreaty that he\nshould look in on the McCalls and use the magnetism of his personality\nupon them in the hope of inducing them to settle the lawsuit. He wished,\ntoo, if the visit had to be paid that he had postponed it till after\nlunch, for he was never at his strongest in the morning. But Lucille had\nurged him to go now and get it over, and here he was.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. McCall, icily, \"that you must have mistaken your\nroom.\"\n\nArchie rallied his shaken forces.\n\n\"Oh, no. Rather not. Better introduce myself, what? My name's Moffam,\nyou know. I'm old Brewster's son-in-law, and all that sort of rot, if\nyou know what I mean.\" He gulped and continued. \"I've come about this\njolly old lawsuit, don't you know.\"\n\nMr. McCall seemed about to speak, but his wife anticipated him.\n\n\"Mr. Brewster's attorneys are in communication with ours. We do not wish\nto discuss the matter.\"\n\nArchie took an uninvited seat, eyed the Health Bread on the breakfast\ntable for a moment with frank curiosity, and resumed his discourse.\n\n\"No, but I say, you know! I'll tell you what happened. I hate to totter\nin where I'm not wanted and all that, but my wife made such a point\nof it. Rightly or wrongly she regards me as a bit of a hound in the\ndiplomacy line, and she begged me to look you up and see whether we\ncouldn't do something about settling the jolly old thing. I mean to\nsay, you know, the old bird--old Brewster, you know--is considerably\nperturbed about the affair--hates the thought of being in a posish where\nhe has either got to bite his old pal McCall in the neck or be bitten\nby him--and--well, and so forth, don't you know! How about it?\" He broke\noff. \"Great Scot! I say, what!\"\n\nSo engrossed had he been in his appeal that he had not observed the\npresence of the pie-eating champion, between whom and himself a large\npotted plant intervened. But now Washington, hearing the familiar voice,\nhad moved from the window and was confronting him with an accusing\nstare.\n\n\"HE made me do it!\" said Washy, with the stern joy a sixteen-year-old\nboy feels when he sees somebody on to whose shoulders he can shift\ntrouble from his own. \"That's the fellow who took me to the place!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Washington?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you! He got me into the thing.\"\n\n\"Do you mean this--this--\" Mrs. McCall shuddered. \"Are you referring to\nthis pie-eating contest?\"\n\n\"You bet I am!\"\n\n\"Is this true?\" Mrs. McCall glared stonily at Archie, \"Was it you who\nlured my poor boy into that--that--\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely. The fact is, don't you know, a dear old pal of mine\nwho runs a tobacco shop on Sixth Avenue was rather in the soup. He had\nbacked a chappie against the champion, and the chappie was converted by\none of your lectures and swore off pie at the eleventh hour. Dashed hard\nluck on the poor chap, don't you know! And then I got the idea that our\nlittle friend here was the one to step in and save the situash, so I\nbroached the matter to him. And I'll tell you one thing,\" said Archie,\nhandsomely, \"I don't know what sort of a capacity the original chappie\nhad, but I'll bet he wasn't in your son's class. Your son has to be seen\nto be believed! Absolutely! You ought to be proud of him!\" He turned in\nfriendly fashion to Washy. \"Rummy we should meet again like this! Never\ndreamed I should find you here. And, by Jove, it's absolutely marvellous\nhow fit you look after yesterday. I had a sort of idea you would be\ngroaning on a bed of sickness and all that.\"\n\nThere was a strange gurgling sound in the background. It resembled\nsomething getting up steam. And this, curiously enough, is precisely\nwhat it was. The thing that was getting up steam was Mr. Lindsay McCall.\n\nThe first effect of the Washy revelations on Mr. McCall had been merely\nto stun him. It was not until the arrival of Archie that he had had\nleisure to think; but since Archie's entrance he had been thinking\nrapidly and deeply.\n\nFor many years Mr. McCall had been in a state of suppressed revolution.\nHe had smouldered, but had not dared to blaze. But this startling\nupheaval of his fellow-sufferer, Washy, had acted upon him like a\nhigh explosive. There was a strange gleam in his eye, a gleam of\ndetermination. He was breathing hard.\n\n\"Washy!\"\n\nHis voice had lost its deprecating mildness. It rang strong and clear.\n\n\"Yes, pop?\"\n\n\"How many pies did you eat yesterday?\"\n\nWashy considered.\n\n\"A good few.\"\n\n\"How many? Twenty?\"\n\n\"More than that. I lost count. A good few.\"\n\n\"And you feel as well as ever?\"\n\n\"I feel fine.\"\n\nMr. McCall dropped his glasses. He glowered for a moment at the\nbreakfast table. His eye took in the Health Bread, the imitation\ncoffee-pot, the cereal, the nut-butter. Then with a swift movement he\nseized the cloth, jerked it forcibly, and brought the entire contents\nrattling and crashing to the floor.\n\n\"Lindsay!\"\n\nMr. McCall met his wife's eye with quiet determination. It was plain\nthat something had happened in the hinterland of Mr. McCall's soul.\n\n\"Cora,\" he said, resolutely, \"I have come to a decision. I've been\nletting you run things your own way a little too long in this family.\nI'm going to assert myself. For one thing, I've had all I want of this\nfood-reform foolery. Look at Washy! Yesterday that boy seems to have\nconsumed anything from a couple of hundredweight to a ton of pie, and\nhe has thriven on it! Thriven! I don't want to hurt your feelings, Cora,\nbut Washington and I have drunk our last cup of anti-caffeine! If you\ncare to go on with the stuff, that's your look-out. But Washy and I are\nthrough.\"\n\nHe silenced his wife with a masterful gesture and turned to Archie. \"And\nthere's another thing. I never liked the idea of that lawsuit, but I let\nyou talk me into it. Now I'm going to do things my way. Mr. Moffam, I'm\nglad you looked in this morning. I'll do just what you want. Take me to\nDan Brewster now, and let's call the thing off, and shake hands on it.\"\n\n\"Are you mad, Lindsay?\"\n\nIt was Cora Bates McCall's last shot. Mr. McCall paid no attention to\nit. He was shaking hands with Archie.\n\n\"I consider you, Mr. Moffam,\" he said, \"the most sensible young man I\nhave ever met!\"\n\nArchie blushed modestly.\n\n\"Awfully good of you, old bean,\" he said. \"I wonder if you'd mind\ntelling my jolly old father-in-law that? It'll be a bit of news for\nhim!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. MOTHER'S KNEE\n\n\nArchie Moffam's connection with that devastatingly popular ballad,\n\"Mother's Knee,\" was one to which he always looked back later with a\ncertain pride. \"Mother's Knee,\" it will be remembered, went through the\nworld like a pestilence. Scots elders hummed it on their way to kirk;\ncannibals crooned it to their offspring in the jungles of Borneo; it was\na best-seller among the Bolshevists. In the United States alone three\nmillion copies were disposed of. For a man who has not accomplished\nanything outstandingly great in his life, it is something to have been\nin a sense responsible for a song like that; and, though there were\nmoments when Archie experienced some of the emotions of a man who has\npunched a hole in the dam of one of the larger reservoirs, he never\nreally regretted his share in the launching of the thing.\n\nIt seems almost bizarre now to think that there was a time when even one\nperson in the world had not heard \"Mother's Knee\"; but it came fresh to\nArchie one afternoon some weeks after the episode of Washy, in his suite\nat the Hotel Cosmopolis, where he was cementing with cigarettes and\npleasant conversation his renewed friendship with Wilson Hymack, whom he\nhad first met in the neighbourhood of Armentieres during the war.\n\n\"What are you doing these days?\" enquired Wilson Hymack.\n\n\"Me?\" said Archie. \"Well, as a matter of fact, there is what you might\ncall a sort of species of lull in my activities at the moment. But my\njolly old father-in-law is bustling about, running up a new hotel a\nbit farther down-town, and the scheme is for me to be manager when it's\nfinished. From what I have seen in this place, it's a simple sort of\njob, and I fancy I shall be somewhat hot stuff. How are you filling in\nthe long hours?\"\n\n\"I'm in my uncle's office, darn it!\"\n\n\"Starting at the bottom and learning the business and all that? A noble\npursuit, no doubt, but I'm bound to say it would give me the pip in no\nuncertain manner.\"\n\n\"It gives me,\" said Wilson Hymack, \"a pain in the thorax. I want to be a\ncomposer.\"\n\n\"A composer, eh?\"\n\nArchie felt that he should have guessed this. The chappie had a\ndistinctly artistic look. He wore a bow-tie and all that sort of thing.\nHis trousers bagged at the knees, and his hair, which during the martial\nepoch of his career had been pruned to the roots, fell about his ears in\nluxuriant disarray.\n\n\"Say! Do you want to hear the best thing I've ever done?\"\n\n\"Indubitably,\" said Archie, politely. \"Carry on, old bird!\"\n\n\"I wrote the lyric as well as the melody,\" said Wilson Hymack, who had\nalready seated himself at the piano. \"It's got the greatest title you\never heard. It's a lallapaloosa! It's called 'It's a Long Way Back to\nMother's Knee.' How's that? Poor, eh?\"\n\nArchie expelled a smoke-ring doubtfully.\n\n\"Isn't it a little stale?\"\n\n\"Stale? What do you mean, stale? There's always room for another song\nboosting Mother.\"\n\n\"Oh, is it boosting Mother?\" Archie's face cleared. \"I thought it was a\nhit at the short skirts. Why, of course, that makes all the difference.\nIn that case, I see no reason why it should not be ripe, fruity, and\npretty well all to the mustard. Let's have it.\"\n\nWilson Hymack pushed as much of his hair out of his eyes as he could\nreach with one hand, cleared his throat, looked dreamily over the top\nof the piano at a photograph of Archie's father-in-law, Mr. Daniel\nBrewster, played a prelude, and began to sing in a weak, high,\ncomposer's voice. All composers sing exactly alike, and they have to be\nheard to be believed.\n\n\"One night a young man wandered through the glitter of Broadway: His\nmoney he had squandered. For a meal he couldn't pay.\"\n\n\"Tough luck!\" murmured Archie, sympathetically.\n\n    \"He thought about the village where his boyhood he had\n     spent, And yearned for all the simple joys with which\n     he'd been content.\"\n\n\"The right spirit!\" said Archie, with approval. \"I'm beginning to like\nthis chappie!\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt!\"\n\n\"Oh, right-o! Carried away and all that!\"\n\n    \"He looked upon the city, so frivolous and gay; And,\n     as he heaved a weary sigh, these words he then did say:\n          It's a long way back to Mother's knee,\n                                  Mother's knee,\n                                  Mother's knee:\n          It's a long way back to Mother's knee,\n               Where I used to stand and prattle\n               With my teddy-bear and rattle:\n          Oh, those childhood days in Tennessee,\n          They sure look good to me!\n     It's a long, long way, but I'm gonna start to-day!\n          I'm going back,\n          Believe me, oh!\n     I'm going back\n          (I want to go!)\n     I'm going back--back--on the seven-three\n     To the dear old shack where I used to be!\n     I'm going back to Mother's knee!\"\n\nWilson Hymack's voice cracked on the final high note, which was of an\naltitude beyond his powers. He turned with a modest cough.\n\n\"That'll give you an idea of it!\"\n\n\"It has, old thing, it has!\"\n\n\"Is it or is it not a ball of fire?\"\n\n\"It has many of the earmarks of a sound egg,\" admitted Archie. \"Of\ncourse--\"\n\n\"Of course, it wants singing.\"\n\n\"Just what I was going to suggest.\"\n\n\"It wants a woman to sing it. A woman who could reach out for that last\nhigh note and teach it to take a joke. The whole refrain is working up\nto that. You need Tetrazzini or someone who would just pick that note\noff the roof and hold it till the janitor came round to lock up the\nbuilding for the night.\"\n\n\"I must buy a copy for my wife. Where can I get it?\"\n\n\"You can't get it! It isn't published. Writing music's the darndest\njob!\" Wilson Hymack snorted fiercely. It was plain that the man was\npouring out the pent-up emotion of many days. \"You write the biggest\nthing in years and you go round trying to get someone to sing it, and\nthey say you're a genius and then shove the song away in a drawer and\nforget about it.\"\n\nArchie lit another cigarette.\n\n\"I'm a jolly old child in these matters, old lad,\" he said, \"but why\ndon't you take it direct to a publisher? As a matter of fact, if it\nwould be any use to you, I was foregathering with a music-publisher only\nthe other day. A bird of the name of Blumenthal. He was lunching in here\nwith a pal of mine, and we got tolerably matey. Why not let me tool you\nround to the office to-morrow and play it to him?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Much obliged, but I'm not going to play that melody in\nany publisher's office with his hired gang of Tin-Pan Alley composers\nlistening at the keyhole and taking notes. I'll have to wait till I can\nfind somebody to sing it. Well, I must be going along. Glad to have seen\nyou again. Sooner or later I'll take you to hear that high note sung by\nsomeone in a way that'll make your spine tie itself in knots round the\nback of your neck.\"\n\n\"I'll count the days,\" said Archie, courteously. \"Pip-pip!\"\n\nHardly had the door closed behind the composer when it opened again to\nadmit Lucille.\n\n\"Hallo, light of my soul!\" said Archie, rising and embracing his wife.\n\"Where have you been all the afternoon? I was expecting you this many an\nhour past. I wanted you to meet--\"\n\n\"I've been having tea with a girl down in Greenwich Village. I couldn't\nget away before. Who was that who went out just as I came along the\npassage?\"\n\n\"Chappie of the name of Hymack. I met him in France. A composer and what\nnot.\"\n\n\"We seem to have been moving in artistic circles this afternoon. The\ngirl I went to see is a singer. At least, she wants to sing, but gets no\nencouragement.\"\n\n\"Precisely the same with my bird. He wants to get his music sung but\nnobody'll sing it. But I didn't know you knew any Greenwich Village\nwarblers, sunshine of my home. How did you meet this female?\"\n\nLucille sat down and gazed forlornly at him with her big grey eyes. She\nwas registering something, but Archie could not gather what it was.\n\n\"Archie, darling, when you married me you undertook to share my sorrows,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! It's all in the book of words. For better or for worse, in\nsickness and in health, all-down-set-'em-up-in-the-other-alley. Regular\niron-clad contract!\"\n\n\"Then share 'em!\" said Lucille. \"Bill's in love again!\"\n\nArchie blinked.\n\n\"Bill? When you say Bill, do you mean Bill? Your brother Bill? My\nbrother-in-law Bill? Jolly old William, the son and heir of the\nBrewsters?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"You say he's in love? Cupid's dart?\"\n\n\"Even so!\"\n\n\"But, I say! Isn't this rather--What I mean to say is, the lad's an\nabsolute scourge! The Great Lover, what! Also ran, Brigham Young, and\nall that sort of thing! Why, it's only a few weeks ago that he was\nmoaning brokenly about that vermilion-haired female who subsequently\nhooked on to old Reggie van Tuyl!\"\n\n\"She's a little better than that girl, thank goodness. All the same, I\ndon't think Father will approve.\"\n\n\"Of what calibre is the latest exhibit?\"\n\n\"Well, she comes from the Middle West, and seems to be trying to be\ntwice as Bohemian as the rest of the girls down in Greenwich Village.\nShe wears her hair bobbed and goes about in a kimono. She's probably\nread magazine stories about Greenwich Village, and has modelled herself\non them. It's so silly, when you can see Hicks Corners sticking out of\nher all the time.\"\n\n\"That one got past me before I could grab it. What did you say she had\nsticking out of her?\"\n\n\"I meant that anybody could see that she came from somewhere out in the\nwilds. As a matter of fact, Bill tells me that she was brought up in\nSnake Bite, Michigan.\"\n\n\"Snake Bite? What rummy names you have in America! Still, I'll admit\nthere's a village in England called Nether Wallop, so who am I to cast\nthe first stone? How is old Bill? Pretty feverish?\"\n\n\"He says this time it is the real thing.\"\n\n\"That's what they all say! I wish I had a dollar for every\ntime--Forgotten what I was going to say!\" broke off Archie, prudently.\n\"So you think,\" he went on, after a pause, \"that William's latest is\ngoing to be one more shock for the old dad?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine Father approving of her.\"\n\n\"I've studied your merry old progenitor pretty closely,\" said Archie,\n\"and, between you and me, I can't imagine him approving of anybody!\"\n\n\"I can't understand why it is that Bill goes out of his way to pick\nthese horrors. I know at least twenty delightful girls, all pretty and\nwith lots of money, who would be just the thing for him; but he sneaks\naway and goes falling in love with someone impossible. And the worst\nof it is that one always feels one's got to do one's best to see him\nthrough.\"\n\n\"Absolutely! One doesn't want to throw a spanner into the works of\nLove's young dream. It behoves us to rally round. Have you heard this\ngirl sing?\"\n\n\"Yes. She sang this afternoon.\"\n\n\"What sort of a voice has she got?\"\n\n\"Well, it's--loud!\"\n\n\"Could she pick a high note off the roof and hold it till the janitor\ncame round to lock up the building for the night?\"\n\n\"What on earth do you mean?\"\n\n\"Answer me this, woman, frankly. How is her high note? Pretty lofty?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"Then say no more,\" said Archie. \"Leave this to me, my dear old better\nfour-fifths! Hand the whole thing over to Archibald, the man who never\nlets you down. I have a scheme!\"\n\n As Archie approached his suite on the following afternoon he heard\nthrough the closed door the drone of a gruff male voice; and, going in,\ndiscovered Lucille in the company of his brother-in-law. Lucille, Archie\nthought, was looking a trifle fatigued. Bill, on the other hand, was in\ngreat shape. His eyes were shining, and his face looked so like that of\na stuffed frog that Archie had no difficulty in gathering that he had\nbeen lecturing on the subject of his latest enslaver.\n\n\"Hallo, Bill, old crumpet!\" he said.\n\n\"Hallo, Archie!\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you've come,\" said Lucille. \"Bill is telling me all about\nSpectatia.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Spectatia. The girl, you know. Her name is Spectatia Huskisson.\"\n\n\"It can't be!\" said Archie, incredulously.\n\n\"Why not?\" growled Bill.\n\n\"Well, how could it?\" said Archie, appealing to him as a reasonable man.\n\"I mean to say! Spectatia Huskisson! I gravely doubt whether there is\nsuch a name.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\" demanded the incensed Bill. \"It's a darned sight\nbetter name than Archibald Moffam.\"\n\n\"Don't fight, you two children!\" intervened Lucille, firmly. \"It's a\ngood old Middle West name. Everybody knows the Huskissons of Snake Bite,\nMichigan. Besides, Bill calls her Tootles.\"\n\n\"Pootles,\" corrected Bill, austerely.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Pootles. He calls her Pootles.\"\n\n\"Young blood! Young blood!\" sighed Archie.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk as if you were my grandfather.\"\n\n\"I look on you as a son, laddie, a favourite son!\"\n\n\"If I had a father like you--!\"-\"Ah, but you haven't,\nyoung-feller-me-lad, and that's the trouble. If you had, everything\nwould be simple. But as your actual father, if you'll allow me to\nsay so, is one of the finest specimens of the human vampire-bat in\ncaptivity, something has got to be done about it, and you're dashed\nlucky to have me in your corner, a guide, philosopher, and friend,\nfull of the fruitiest ideas. Now, if you'll kindly listen to me for a\nmoment--\"\n\n\"I've been listening to you ever since you came in.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't speak in that harsh tone of voice if you knew all!\nWilliam, I have a scheme!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The scheme to which I allude is what Maeterlinck would call a\nlallapaloosa!\"\n\n\"What a little marvel he is!\" said Lucille, regarding her husband\naffectionately. \"He eats a lot of fish, Bill. That's what makes him so\nclever!\"\n\n\"Shrimps!\" diagnosed Bill, churlishly.\n\n\"Do you know the leader of the orchestra in the restaurant downstairs?\"\nasked Archie, ignoring the slur.\n\n\"I know there IS a leader of the orchestra. What about him?\"\n\n\"A sound fellow. Great pal of mine. I've forgotten his name--\"\n\n\"Call him Pootles!\" suggested Lucille.\n\n\"Desist!\" said Archie, as a wordless growl proceeded from his stricken\nbrother-in-law. \"Temper your hilarity with a modicum of reserve. This\ngirlish frivolity is unseemly. Well, I'm going to have a chat with this\nchappie and fix it all up.\"\n\n\"Fix what up?\"\n\n\"The whole jolly business. I'm going to kill two birds with one stone.\nI've a composer chappie popping about in the background whose one\nambish. is to have his pet song sung before a discriminating audience.\nYou have a singer straining at the leash. I'm going to arrange with this\negg who leads the orchestra that your female shall sing my chappie's\nsong downstairs one night during dinner. How about it? Is it or is it\nnot a ball of fire?\"\n\n\"It's not a bad idea,\" admitted Bill, brightening visibly. \"I wouldn't\nhave thought you had it in you.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"It's a capital idea,\" said Lucille. \"Quite out of the question, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't you know that the one thing Father hates more than anything else\nin the world is anything like a cabaret? People are always coming to\nhim, suggesting that it would brighten up the dinner hour if he had\nsingers and things, and he crushes them into little bits. He thinks\nthere's nothing that lowers the tone of a place more. He'll bite you in\nthree places when you suggest it to him!\"\n\n\"Ah! But has it escaped your notice, lighting system of my soul, that\nthe dear old dad is not at present in residence? He went off to fish at\nLake What's-its-name this morning.\"\n\n\"You aren't dreaming of doing this without asking him?\"\n\n\"That was the general idea.\"\n\n\"But he'll be furious when he finds out.\"\n\n\"But will he find out? I ask you, will he?\"\n\n\"Of course he will.\"\n\n\"I don't see why he should,\" said Bill, on whose plastic mind the plan\nhad made a deep impression.\n\n\"He won't,\" said Archie, confidently. \"This wheeze is for one night\nonly. By the time the jolly old guv'nor returns, bitten to the bone by\nmosquitoes, with one small stuffed trout in his suit-case, everything\nwill be over and all quiet once more along the Potomac. The scheme is\nthis. My chappie wants his song heard by a publisher. Your girl wants\nher voice heard by one of the blighters who get up concerts and all that\nsort of thing. No doubt you know such a bird, whom you could invite to\nthe hotel for a bit of dinner?\"\n\n\"I know Carl Steinburg. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of writing\nto him about Spectatia.\"\n\n\"You're absolutely sure that IS her name?\" said Archie, his voice still\ntinged with incredulity. \"Oh, well, I suppose she told you so herself,\nand no doubt she knows best. That will be topping. Rope in your pal\nand hold him down at the table till the finish. Lucille, the beautiful\nvision on the sky-line yonder, and I will be at another table\nentertaining Maxie Blumenthal\"\n\n\"Who on earth is Maxie Blumenthal?\" asked Lucille.\n\n\"One of my boyhood chums. A music-publisher. I'll get him to come along,\nand then we'll all be set. At the conclusion of the performance Miss--\"\nArchie winced--\"Miss Spectatia Huskisson will be signed up for a forty\nweeks' tour, and jovial old Blumenthal will be making all arrangements\nfor publishing the song. Two birds, as I indicated before, with one\nstone! How about it?\"\n\n\"It's a winner,\" said Bill.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Archie, \"I'm not urging you. I merely make the\nsuggestion. If you know a better 'ole go to it!\"\n\n\"It's terrific!\" said Bill.\n\n\"It's absurd!\" said Lucille.\n\n\"My dear old partner of joys and sorrows,\" said Archie, wounded,\n\"we court criticism, but this is mere abuse. What seems to be the\ndifficulty?\"\n\n\"The leader of the orchestra would be afraid to do it.\"\n\n\"Ten dollars--supplied by William here--push it over, Bill, old\nman--will remove his tremors.\"\n\n\"And Father's certain to find out.\"\n\n\"Am I afraid of Father?\" cried Archie, manfully. \"Well, yes, I am!\" he\nadded, after a moment's reflection. \"But I don't see how he can possibly\nget to know.\"\n\n\"Of course he can't,\" said Bill, decidedly. \"Fix it up as soon as you\ncan, Archie. This is what the doctor ordered.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE MELTING OF MR. CONNOLLY\n\n\nThe main dining-room of the Hotel Cosmopolis is a decorous place. The\nlighting is artistically dim, and the genuine old tapestries on the\nwalls seem, with their mediaeval calm, to discourage any essay in the\nriotous. Soft-footed waiters shimmer to and fro over thick, expensive\ncarpets to the music of an orchestra which abstains wholly from the\nnoisy modernity of jazz. To Archie, who during the past few days had\nbeen privileged to hear Miss Huskisson rehearsing, the place had a sort\nof brooding quiet, like the ocean just before the arrival of a cyclone.\nAs Lucille had said, Miss Huskisson's voice was loud. It was a powerful\norgan, and there was no doubt that it would take the cloistered\nstillness of the Cosmopolis dining-room and stand it on one ear. Almost\nunconsciously, Archie found himself bracing his muscles and holding his\nbreath as he had done in France at the approach of the zero hour, when\nawaiting the first roar of a barrage. He listened mechanically to the\nconversation of Mr. Blumenthal.\n\nThe music-publisher was talking with some vehemence on the subject\nof Labour. A recent printers' strike had bitten deeply into Mr.\nBlumenthal's soul. The working man, he considered, was rapidly landing\nGod's Country in the soup, and he had twice upset his glass with the\nvehemence of his gesticulation. He was an energetic right-and-left-hand\ntalker.\n\n\"The more you give 'em the more they want!\" he complained. \"There's no\npleasing 'em! It isn't only in my business. There's your father, Mrs.\nMoffam!\"\n\n\"Good God! Where?\" said Archie, starting.\n\n\"I say, take your father's case. He's doing all he knows to get this new\nhotel of his finished, and what happens? A man gets fired for loafing\non his job, and Connolly calls a strike. And the building operations are\nheld up till the thing's settled! It isn't right!\"\n\n\"It's a great shame,\" agreed Lucille. \"I was reading about it in the\npaper this morning.\"\n\n\"That man Connolly's a tough guy. You'd think, being a personal friend\nof your father, he would--\"\n\n\"I didn't know they were friends.\"\n\n\"Been friends for years. But a lot of difference that makes. Out come\nthe men just the same. It isn't right! I was saying it wasn't right!\"\nrepeated Mr. Blumenthal to Archie, for he was a man who liked the\nattention of every member of his audience.\n\nArchie did not reply. He was staring glassily across the room at two\nmen who had just come in. One was a large, stout, square-faced man of\ncommanding personality. The other was Mr. Daniel Brewster.\n\nMr. Blumenthal followed his gaze.\n\n\"Why, there is Connolly coming in now!\"\n\n\"Father!\" gasped Lucille.\n\nHer eyes met Archie's. Archie took a hasty drink of ice-water.\n\n\"This,\" he murmured, \"has torn it!\"\n\n\"Archie, you must do something!\"\n\n\"I know! But what?\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" enquired Mr. Blumenthal, mystified.\n\n\"Go over to their table and talk to them,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"Me!\" Archie quivered. \"No, I say, old thing, really!\"\n\n\"Get them away!\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I know!\" cried Lucille, inspired, \"Father promised that you should\nbe manager of the new hotel when it was built. Well, then, this strike\naffects you just as much as anybody else. You have a perfect right to\ntalk it over with them. Go and ask them to have dinner up in our suite\nwhere you can discuss it quietly. Say that up there they won't be\ndisturbed by the--the music.\"\n\nAt this moment, while Archie wavered, hesitating like a diver on the\nedge of a spring-board who is trying to summon up the necessary nerve to\nproject himself into the deep, a bell-boy approached the table where\nthe Messrs. Brewster and Connolly had seated themselves. He murmured\nsomething in Mr. Brewster's ear, and the proprietor of the Cosmopolis\nrose and followed him out of the room.\n\n\"Quick! Now's your chance!\" said Lucille, eagerly. \"Father's been called\nto the telephone. Hurry!\"\n\nArchie took another drink of ice-water to steady his shaking\nnerve-centers, pulled down his waistcoat, straightened his tie, and\nthen, with something of the air of a Roman gladiator entering the arena,\ntottered across the room. Lucille turned to entertain the perplexed\nmusic-publisher.\n\nThe nearer Archie got to Mr. Aloysius Connolly the less did he like the\nlooks of him. Even at a distance the Labour leader had had a formidable\naspect. Seen close to, he looked even more uninviting. His face had\nthe appearance of having been carved out of granite, and the eye which\ncollided with Archie's as the latter, with an attempt at an ingratiating\nsmile, pulled up a chair and sat down at the table was hard and frosty.\nMr. Connolly gave the impression that he would be a good man to have on\nyour side during a rough-and-tumble fight down on the water-front or in\nsome lumber-camp, but he did not look chummy.\n\n\"Hallo-allo-allo!\" said Archie.\n\n\"Who the devil,\" inquired Mr. Connolly, \"are you?\"\n\n\"My name's Archibald Moffam.\"\n\n\"That's not my fault.\"\n\n\"I'm jolly old Brewster's son-in-law.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet YOU,\" said Archie, handsomely.\n\n\"Well, good-bye!\" said Mr. Connolly.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Run along and sell your papers. Your father-in-law and I have business\nto discuss.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\n\"Private,\" added Mr. Connolly.\n\n\"Oh, but I'm in on this binge, you know. I'm going to be the manager of\nthe new hotel.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Mr. Connolly, noncommittally.\n\nArchie, pleased with the smoothness with which matters had opened, bent\nforward winsomely.\n\n\"I say, you know! It won't do, you know! Absolutely no! Not a bit like\nit! No, no, far from it! Well, how about it? How do we go? What? Yes?\nNo?\"\n\n\"What on earth are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Call it off, old thing!\"\n\n\"Call what off?\"\n\n\"This festive old strike.\"\n\n\"Not on your--hallo, Dan! Back again?\"\n\nMr. Brewster, looming over the table like a thundercloud, regarded\nArchie with more than his customary hostility. Life was no pleasant\nthing for the proprietor of the Cosmopolis just now. Once a man starts\nbuilding hotels, the thing becomes like dram-drinking. Any hitch, any\nsudden cutting-off of the daily dose, has the worst effects; and the\nstrike which was holding up the construction of his latest effort had\nplunged Mr. Brewster into a restless gloom. In addition to having this\nstrike on his hands, he had had to abandon his annual fishing-trip just\nwhen he had begun to enjoy it; and, as if all this were not enough, here\nwas his son-in-law sitting at his table. Mr. Brewster had a feeling that\nthis was more than man was meant to bear.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Hallo, old thing!\" said Archie. \"Come and join the party!\"\n\n\"Don't call me old thing!\"\n\n\"Right-o, old companion, just as you say. I say, I was just going to\nsuggest to Mr. Connolly that we should all go up to my suite and talk\nthis business over quietly.\"\n\n\"He says he's the manager of your new hotel,\" said Mr. Connolly. \"Is\nthat right?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mr. Brewster, gloomily.\n\n\"Then I'm doing you a kindness,\" said Mr. Connolly, \"in not letting it\nbe built.\"\n\nArchie dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief. The moments were\nflying, and it began to seem impossible to shift these two men. Mr.\nConnolly was as firmly settled in his chair as some primeval rock. As\nfor Mr. Brewster, he, too, had seated himself, and was gazing at Archie\nwith a weary repulsion. Mr. Brewster's glance always made Archie feel as\nthough there were soup on his shirt-front.\n\nAnd suddenly from the orchestra at the other end of the room there came\na familiar sound, the prelude of \"Mother's Knee.\"\n\n\"So you've started a cabaret, Dan?\" said Mr. Connolly, in a satisfied\nvoice. \"I always told you you were behind the times here!\"\n\nMr. Brewster jumped.\n\n\"Cabaret!\"\n\nHe stared unbelievingly at the white-robed figure which had just mounted\nthe orchestra dais, and then concentrated his gaze on Archie.\n\nArchie would not have looked at his father-in-law at this juncture if he\nhad had a free and untrammelled choice; but Mr. Brewster's eye drew his\nwith something of the fascination which a snake's has for a rabbit. Mr.\nBrewster's eye was fiery and intimidating. A basilisk might have gone to\nhim with advantage for a course of lessons. His gaze went right through\nArchie till the latter seemed to feel his back-hair curling crisply in\nthe flames.\n\n\"Is this one of your fool-tricks?\"\n\nEven in this tense moment Archie found time almost unconsciously to\nadmire his father-in-law's penetration and intuition. He seemed to have\na sort of sixth sense. No doubt this was how great fortunes were made.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact--to be absolutely accurate--it was like\nthis--\"\n\n\"Say, cut it out!\" said Mr. Connolly. \"Can the chatter! I want to\nlisten.\"\n\nArchie was only too ready to oblige him. Conversation at the moment was\nthe last thing he himself desired. He managed with a strong effort to\ndisengage himself from Mr. Brewster's eye, and turned to the orchestra\ndais, where Miss Spectatia Huskisson was now beginning the first verse\nof Wilson Hymack's masterpiece.\n\nMiss Huskisson, like so many of the female denizens of the Middle West,\nwas tall and blonde and constructed on substantial lines. She was a girl\nwhose appearance suggested the old homestead and fried pancakes and pop\ncoming home to dinner after the morning's ploughing. Even her bobbed\nhair did not altogether destroy this impression. She looked big and\nstrong and healthy, and her lungs were obviously good. She attacked the\nverse of the song with something of the vigour and breadth of treatment\nwith which in other days she had reasoned with refractory mules. Her\ndiction was the diction of one trained to call the cattle home in the\nteeth of Western hurricanes. Whether you wanted to or not, you heard\nevery word.\n\nThe subdued clatter of knives and forks had ceased. The diners, unused\nto this sort of thing at the Cosmopolis, were trying to adjust their\nfaculties to cope with the outburst. Waiters stood transfixed, frozen,\nin attitudes of service. In the momentary lull between verse and refrain\nArchie could hear the deep breathing of Mr. Brewster. Involuntarily\nhe turned to gaze at him once more, as refugees from Pompeii may have\nturned to gaze upon Vesuvius; and, as he did so, he caught sight of Mr.\nConnolly, and paused in astonishment.\n\nMr. Connolly was an altered man. His whole personality had undergone\na subtle change. His face still looked as though hewn from the living\nrock, but into his eyes had crept an expression which in another man\nmight almost have been called sentimental. Incredible as it seemed\nto Archie, Mr. Connolly's eyes were dreamy. There was even in them a\nsuggestion of unshed tears. And when with a vast culmination of sound\nMiss Huskisson reached the high note at the end of the refrain and,\nafter holding it as some storming-party, spent but victorious, holds the\nsummit of a hard-won redoubt, broke off suddenly, in the stillness which\nfollowed there proceeded from Mr. Connolly a deep sigh.\n\nMiss Huskisson began the second verse. And Mr. Brewster, seeming to\nrecover from some kind of a trance, leaped to his feet.\n\n\"Great Godfrey!\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" said Mr. Connolly, in a broken voice. \"Sit down, Dan!\"\n\n    \"He went back to his mother on the train that very day:\n     He knew there was no other who could make him bright and\n        gay:\n     He kissed her on the forehead and he whispered, 'I've come\n        home!'\n     He told her he was never going any more to roam.\n     And onward through the happy years, till he grew old and\n        grey,\n     He never once regretted those brave words he once did say:\n     It's a long way back to mother's knee--\"\n\nThe last high note screeched across the room like a shell, and the\napplause that followed was like a shell's bursting. One could hardly\nhave recognised the refined interior of the Cosmopolis dining-room. Fair\nwomen were waving napkins; brave men were hammering on the tables with\nthe butt-end of knives, for all the world as if they imagined themselves\nto be in one of those distressing midnight-revue places. Miss Huskisson\nbowed, retired, returned, bowed, and retired again, the tears\nstreaming down her ample face. Over in a corner Archie could see his\nbrother-in-law clapping strenuously. A waiter, with a display of manly\nemotion that did him credit, dropped an order of new peas.\n\n\"Thirty years ago last October,\" said Mr. Connolly, in a shaking voice,\n\"I--\"\n\nMr. Brewster interrupted him violently.\n\n\"I'll fire that orchestra-leader! He goes to-morrow! I'll fire--\" He\nturned on Archie. \"What the devil do you mean by it, you--you--\"\n\n\"Thirty years ago,\" said Mr. Connolly, wiping away a tear with his\nnapkin, \"I left me dear old home in the old country--\"\n\n\"MY hotel a bear-garden!\"\n\n\"Frightfully sorry and all that, old companion--\"\n\n\"Thirty years ago last October! 'Twas a fine autumn evening the finest\nye'd ever wish to see. Me old mother, she came to the station to see me\noff.\"\n\nMr. Brewster, who was not deeply interested in Mr. Connolly's old\nmother, continued to splutter inarticulately, like a firework trying to\ngo off.\n\n\"'Ye'll always be a good boy, Aloysius?' she said to me,\" said Mr.\nConnolly, proceeding with, his autobiography. \"And I said: 'Yes, Mother,\nI will!'\" Mr. Connolly sighed and applied the napkin again. \"'Twas a\nliar I was!\" he observed, remorsefully. \"Many's the dirty I've played\nsince then. 'It's a long way back to Mother's knee.' 'Tis a true word!\"\nHe turned impulsively to Mr. Brewster. \"Dan, there's a deal of trouble\nin this world without me going out of me way to make more. The strike is\nover! I'll send the men back tomorrow! There's me hand on it!\"\n\nMr. Brewster, who had just managed to co-ordinate his views on the\nsituation and was about to express them with the generous strength which\nwas ever his custom when dealing with his son-in-law, checked himself\nabruptly. He stared at his old friend and business enemy, wondering if\nhe could have heard aright. Hope began to creep back into Mr. Brewster's\nheart, like a shamefaced dog that has been away from home hunting for a\nday or two.\n\n\"You'll what!\"\n\n\"I'll send the men back to-morrow! That song was sent to guide me, Dan!\nIt was meant! Thirty years ago last October me dear old mother--\"\n\nMr. Brewster bent forward attentively. His views on Mr. Connolly's dear\nold mother had changed. He wanted to hear all about her.\n\n\"'Twas that last note that girl sang brought it all back to me as if\n'twas yesterday. As we waited on the platform, me old mother and I, out\ncomes the train from the tunnel, and the engine lets off a screech the\nway ye'd hear it ten miles away. 'Twas thirty years ago--\"\n\nArchie stole softly from the table. He felt that his presence, if it had\never been required, was required no longer. Looking back, he could see\nhis father-in-law patting Mr. Connolly affectionately on the shoulder.\n\nArchie and Lucille lingered over their coffee. Mr. Blumenthal was out\nin the telephone-box settling the business end with Wilson Hymack. The\nmusic-publisher had been unstinted in his praise of \"Mother's Knee.\"\nIt was sure-fire, he said. The words, stated Mr. Blumenthal, were gooey\nenough to hurt, and the tune reminded him of every other song-hit he had\never heard. There was, in Mr. Blumenthal's opinion, nothing to stop this\nthing selling a million copies.\n\nArchie smoked contentedly.\n\n\"Not a bad evening's work, old thing,\" he said. \"Talk about birds with\none stone!\" He looked at Lucille reproachfully. \"You don't seem bubbling\nover with joy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am, precious!\" Lucille sighed. \"I was only thinking about Bill.\"\n\n\"What about Bill?\"\n\n\"Well, it's rather awful to think of him tied for life to that-that\nsteam-siren.\"\n\n\"Oh, we mustn't look on the jolly old dark side. Perhaps--Hallo, Bill,\nold top! We were just talking about you.\"\n\n\"Were you?\" said Bill Brewster, in a dispirited voice.\n\n\"I take it that you want congratulations, what?\"\n\n\"I want sympathy!\"\n\n\"Sympathy?\"\n\n\"Sympathy! And lots of it! She's gone!\"\n\n\"Gone! Who?\"\n\n\"Spectatia!\"\n\n\"How do you mean, gone?\"\n\nBill glowered at the tablecloth.\n\n\"Gone home. I've just seen her off in a cab. She's gone back to\nWashington Square to pack. She's catching the ten o'clock train back\nto Snake Bite. It was that damned song!\" muttered Bill, in a stricken\nvoice. \"She says she never realised before she sang it to-night how\nhollow New York was. She said it suddenly came over her. She says she's\ngoing to give up her career and go back to her mother. What the deuce\nare you twiddling your fingers for?\" he broke off, irritably.\n\n\"Sorry, old man. I was just counting.\"\n\n\"Counting? Counting what?\"\n\n\"Birds, old thing. Only birds!\" said Archie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE WIGMORE VENUS\n\n\nThe morning was so brilliantly fine; the populace popped to and fro\nin so active and cheery a manner; and everybody appeared to be so\nabsolutely in the pink, that a casual observer of the city of New York\nwould have said that it was one of those happy days. Yet Archie Moffam,\nas he turned out of the sun-bathed street into the ramshackle building\non the third floor of which was the studio belonging to his artist\nfriend, James B. Wheeler, was faintly oppressed with a sort of a kind\nof feeling that something was wrong. He would not have gone so far as to\nsay that he had the pip--it was more a vague sense of discomfort. And,\nsearching for first causes as he made his way upstairs, he came to the\nconclusion that the person responsible for this nebulous depression was\nhis wife, Lucille. It seemed to Archie that at breakfast that morning\nLucille's manner had been subtly rummy. Nothing you could put your\nfinger on, still--rummy.\n\nMusing thus, he reached the studio, and found the door open and the room\nempty. It had the air of a room whose owner has dashed in to fetch\nhis golf-clubs and biffed off, after the casual fashion of the artist\ntemperament, without bothering to close up behind him. And such, indeed,\nwas the case. The studio had seen the last of J. B. Wheeler for that\nday: but Archie, not realising this and feeling that a chat with Mr.\nWheeler, who was a light-hearted bird, was what he needed this morning,\nsat down to wait. After a few moments, his gaze, straying over the room,\nencountered a handsomely framed picture, and he went across to take a\nlook at it.\n\nJ. B. Wheeler was an artist who made a large annual income as an\nillustrator for the magazines, and it was a surprise to Archie to find\nthat he also went in for this kind of thing. For the picture, dashingly\npainted in oils, represented a comfortably plump young woman who, from\nher rather weak-minded simper and the fact that she wore absolutely\nnothing except a small dove on her left shoulder, was plainly intended\nto be the goddess Venus. Archie was not much of a lad around the\npicture-galleries, but he knew enough about Art to recognise Venus when\nhe saw her; though once or twice, it is true, artists had double-crossed\nhim by ringing in some such title as \"Day Dreams,\" or \"When the Heart is\nYoung.\"\n\nHe inspected this picture for awhile, then, returning to his seat, lit\na cigarette and began to meditate on Lucille once more. \"Yes, the dear\ngirl had been rummy at breakfast. She had not exactly said anything or\ndone anything out of the ordinary; but--well, you know how it is. We\nhusbands, we lads of the for-better-or-for-worse brigade, we learn\nto pierce the mask. There had been in Lucille's manner that curious,\nstrained sweetness which comes to women whose husbands have failed to\nmatch the piece of silk or forgotten to post an important letter. If his\nconscience had not been as clear as crystal, Archie would have said\nthat that was what must have been the matter. But, when Lucille wrote\nletters, she just stepped out of the suite and dropped them in the\nmail-chute attached to the elevator. It couldn't be that. And he\ncouldn't have forgotten anything else, because--\"\n\n\"Oh my sainted aunt!\"\n\nArchie's cigarette smouldered, neglected, between his fingers. His\njaw had fallen and his eyes were staring glassily before him. He was\nappalled. His memory was weak, he knew; but never before had it let him\ndown, so scurvily as this. This was a record. It stood in a class by\nitself, printed in red ink and marked with a star, as the bloomer of a\nlifetime. For a man may forget many things: he may forget his name, his\numbrella, his nationality, his spats, and the friends of his\nyouth: but there is one thing which your married man, your\nin-sickness-and-in-health lizard must not forget: and that is the\nanniversary of his wedding-day.\n\nRemorse swept over Archie like a wave. His heart bled for Lucille. No\nwonder the poor girl had been rummy at breakfast. What girl wouldn't be\nrummy at breakfast, tied for life to a ghastly outsider like himself? He\ngroaned hollowly, and sagged forlornly in his chair: and, as he did so,\nthe Venus caught his eye. For it was an eye-catching picture. You might\nlike it or dislike it, but you could not ignore it.\n\nAs a strong swimmer shoots to the surface after a high dive, Archie's\nsoul rose suddenly from the depths to which it had descended. He did not\noften get inspirations, but he got one now. Hope dawned with a jerk. The\none way out had presented itself to him. A rich present! That was the\nwheeze. If he returned to her bearing a rich present, he might, with the\nhelp of Heaven and a face of brass, succeed in making her believe that\nhe had merely pretended to forget the vital date in order to enhance the\nsurprise.\n\nIt was a scheme. Like some great general forming his plan of campaign on\nthe eve of battle, Archie had the whole binge neatly worked out inside a\nminute. He scribbled a note to Mr. Wheeler, explaining the situation and\npromising reasonable payment on the instalment system; then, placing the\nnote in a conspicuous position on the easel, he leaped to the telephone:\nand presently found himself connected with Lucille's room at the\nCosmopolis.\n\n\"Hullo, darling,\" he cooed.\n\nThere was a slight pause at the other end of the wire.\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Archie!\"\n\nLucille's voice was dull and listless, and Archie's experienced ear\ncould detect that she had been crying. He raised his right foot, and\nkicked himself indignantly on the left ankle.\n\n\"Many happy returns of the day, old thing!\"\n\nA muffled sob floated over the wire.\n\n\"Have you only just remembered?\" said Lucille in a small voice.\n\nArchie, bracing himself up, cackled gleefully into the receiver.\n\n\"Did I take you in, light of my home? Do you mean to say you really\nthought I had forgotten? For Heaven's sake!\"\n\n\"You didn't say a word at breakfast.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that was all part of the devilish cunning. I hadn't got a\npresent for you then. At least, I didn't know whether it was ready.\"\n\n\"Oh, Archie, you darling!\" Lucille's voice had lost its crushed\nmelancholy. She trilled like a thrush, or a linnet, or any bird that\ngoes in largely for trilling. \"Have you really got me a present?\"\n\n\"It's here now. The dickens of a fruity picture. One of J. B. Wheeler's\nthings. You'll like it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know I shall. I love his work. You are an angel. We'll hang it\nover the piano.\"\n\n\"I'll be round with it in something under three ticks, star of my soul.\nI'll take a taxi.\"\n\n\"Yes, do hurry! I want to hug you!\"\n\n\"Right-o!\" said Archie. \"I'll take two taxis.\"\n\nIt is not far from Washington Square to the Hotel Cosmopolis, and Archie\nmade the journey without mishap. There was a little unpleasantness\nwith the cabman before starting--he, on the prudish plea that he was a\nmarried man with a local reputation to keep up, declining at first to be\nseen in company with the masterpiece. But, on Archie giving a promise to\nkeep the front of the picture away from the public gaze, he consented\nto take the job on; and, some ten minutes later, having made his way\nblushfully through the hotel lobby and endured the frank curiosity of\nthe boy who worked the elevator, Archie entered his suite, the picture\nunder his arm.\n\nHe placed it carefully against the wall in order to leave himself more\nscope for embracing Lucille, and when the joyful reunion--or the sacred\nscene, if you prefer so to call it, was concluded, he stepped forward to\nturn it round and exhibit it.\n\n\"Why, it's enormous,\" said Lucille. \"I didn't know Mr. Wheeler ever\npainted pictures that size. When you said it was one of his, I thought\nit must be the original of a magazine drawing or something like--Oh!\"\n\nArchie had moved back and given her an uninterrupted view of the work of\nart, and she had started as if some unkindly disposed person had driven\na bradawl into her.\n\n\"Pretty ripe, what?\" said Archie enthusiastically.\n\nLucille did not speak for a moment. It may have been sudden joy that\nkept her silent. Or, on the other hand, it may not. She stood looking at\nthe picture with wide eyes and parted lips.\n\n\"A bird, eh?\" said Archie.\n\n\"Y--yes,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"I knew you'd like it,\" proceeded Archie with animation, \"You see?\nyou're by way of being a picture-hound--know all about the things,\nand what not--inherit it from the dear old dad, I shouldn't wonder.\nPersonally, I can't tell one picture from another as a rule, but I'm\nbound to say, the moment I set eyes on this, I said to myself 'What\nho!' or words to that effect, I rather think this will add a touch of\ndistinction to the home, yes, no? I'll hang it up, shall I? 'Phone down\nto the office, light of my soul, and tell them to send up a nail, a bit\nof string, and the hotel hammer.\"\n\n\"One moment, darling. I'm not quite sure.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Where it ought to hang, I mean. You see--\"\n\n\"Over the piano, you said. The jolly old piano.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I hadn't seen it then.\"\n\nA monstrous suspicion flitted for an instant into Archie's mind.\n\n\"I say, you do like it, don't you?\" he said anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, Archie, darling! Of course I do!-And it was so sweet of you to give\nit to me. But, what I was trying to say was that this picture is so--so\nstriking that I feel that we ought to wait a little while and decide\nwhere it would have the best effect. The light over the piano is rather\nstrong.\"\n\n\"You think it ought to hang in a dimmish light, what?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. The dimmer the--I mean, yes, in a dim light. Suppose we leave\nit in the corner for the moment--over there--behind the sofa, and--and\nI'll think it over. It wants a lot of thought, you know.\"\n\n\"Right-o! Here?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will do splendidly. Oh, and, Archie.\"\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\n\"I think perhaps... Just turn its face to the wall, will you?\" Lucille\ngave a little gulp. \"It will prevent it getting dusty.\"\n\nIt perplexed Archie a little during the next few days to notice in\nLucille, whom he had always looked on as pre-eminently a girl who knew\nher own mind, a curious streak of vacillation. Quite half a dozen times\nhe suggested various spots on the wall as suitable for the Venus, but\nLucille seemed unable to decide. Archie wished that she would settle on\nsomething definite, for he wanted to invite J. B. Wheeler to the suite\nto see the thing. He had heard nothing from the artist since the day he\nhad removed the picture, and one morning, encountering him on Broadway,\nhe expressed his appreciation of the very decent manner in which the\nother had taken the whole affair.\n\n\"Oh, that!\" said J. B. Wheeler. \"My dear fellow, you're welcome.\" He\npaused for a moment. \"More than welcome,\" he added. \"You aren't much of\nan expert on pictures, are you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Archie, \"I don't know that you'd call me an absolute nib,\ndon't you know, but of course I know enough to see that this particular\nexhibit is not a little fruity. Absolutely one of the best things you've\never done, laddie.\"\n\nA slight purple tinge manifested itself in Mr. Wheeler's round and rosy\nface. His eyes bulged.\n\n\"What are you talking about, you Tishbite? You misguided son of Belial,\nare you under the impression that _I_ painted that thing?\"\n\n\"Didn't you?\"\n\nMr. Wheeler swallowed a little convulsively.\n\n\"My fiancee painted it,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"Your fiancee? My dear old lad, I didn't know you were engaged. Who is\nshe? Do I know her?\"\n\n\"Her name is Alice Wigmore. You don't know her.\"\n\n\"And she painted that picture?\" Archie was perturbed. \"But, I say! Won't\nshe be apt to wonder where the thing has got to?\"\n\n\"I told her it had been stolen. She thought it a great compliment, and\nwas tickled to death. So that's all right.\"\n\n\"And, of course, she'll paint you another.\"\n\n\"Not while I have my strength she won't,\" said J. B. Wheeler firmly.\n\"She's given up painting since I taught her golf, thank goodness, and\nmy best efforts shall be employed in seeing that she doesn't have a\nrelapse.\"\n\n\"But, laddie,\" said Archie, puzzled, \"you talk as though there were\nsomething wrong with the picture. I thought it dashed hot stuff.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" said J. B. Wheeler.\n\nArchie proceeded on his way, still mystified. Then he reflected that\nartists as a class were all pretty weird and rummy and talked more or\nless consistently through their hats. You couldn't ever take an artist's\nopinion on a picture. Nine out of ten of them had views on Art which\nwould have admitted them to any looney-bin, and no questions asked. He\nhad met several of the species who absolutely raved over things which\nany reasonable chappie would decline to be found dead in a ditch with.\nHis admiration for the Wigmore Venus, which had faltered for a moment\nduring his conversation with J. B. Wheeler, returned in all its pristine\nvigour. Absolute rot, he meant to say, to try to make out that it wasn't\none of the ones and just like mother used to make. Look how Lucille had\nliked it!\n\nAt breakfast next morning, Archie once more brought up the question of\nthe hanging of the picture. It was absurd to let a thing like that go on\nwasting its sweetness behind a sofa with its face to the wall.\n\n\"Touching the jolly old masterpiece,\" he said, \"how about it? I think\nit's time we hoisted it up somewhere.\"\n\nLucille fiddled pensively with her coffee-spoon.\n\n\"Archie, dear,\" she said, \"I've been thinking.\"\n\n\"And a very good thing to do,\" said Archie. \"I've often meant to do it\nmyself when I got a bit of time.\"\n\n\"About that picture, I mean. Did you know it was father's birthday\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"Why no, old thing, I didn't, to be absolutely honest. Your revered\nparent doesn't confide in me much these days, as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"Well, it is. And I think we ought to give him a present.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. But how? I'm all for spreading sweetness and light, and\ncheering up the jolly old pater's sorrowful existence, but I haven't a\nbean. And, what is more, things have come to such a pass that I scan the\nhorizon without seeing a single soul I can touch. I suppose I could get\ninto Reggie van Tuyl's ribs for a bit, but--I don't know--touching poor\nold Reggie always seems to me rather like potting a sitting bird.\"\n\n\"Of course, I don't want you to do anything like that. I was\nthinking--Archie, darling, would you be very hurt if I gave father the\npicture?\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\"\n\n\"Well, I can't think of anything else.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't you miss it most frightfully?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I should. But you see--father's birthday--\"\n\nArchie had always thought Lucille the dearest and most unselfish angel\nin the world, but never had the fact come home to him so forcibly as\nnow. He kissed her fondly.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"You really are, you know! This is the biggest\nthing since jolly old Sir Philip What's-his-name gave the drink of water\nto the poor blighter whose need was greater than his, if you recall the\nincident. I had to sweat it up at school, I remember. Sir Philip, poor\nold bean, had a most ghastly thirst on, and he was just going to\nhave one on the house, so to speak, when... but it's all in the\nhistory-books. This is the sort of thing Boy Scouts do! Well, of course,\nit's up to you, queen of my soul. If you feel like making the sacrifice,\nright-o! Shall I bring the pater up here and show him the picture?\"\n\n\"No, I shouldn't do that. Do you think you could get into his suite\nto-morrow morning and hang it up somewhere? You see, if he had the\nchance of--what I mean is, if--yes, I think it would be best to hang it\nup and let him discover it there.\"\n\n\"It would give him a surprise, you mean, what?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLucille sighed inaudibly. She was a girl with a conscience, and that\nconscience was troubling her a little. She agreed with Archie that the\ndiscovery of the Wigmore Venus in his artistically furnished suite\nwould give Mr. Brewster a surprise. Surprise, indeed, was perhaps an\ninadequate word. She was sorry for her father, but the instinct of\nself-preservation is stronger than any other emotion.\n\nArchie whistled merrily on the following morning as, having driven a\nnail into his father-in-law's wallpaper, he adjusted the cord from which\nthe Wigmore Venus was suspended. He was a kind-hearted young man, and,\nthough Mr. Daniel Brewster had on many occasions treated him with a good\ndeal of austerity, his simple soul was pleased at the thought of\ndoing him a good turn, He had just completed his work and was\nstepping cautiously down, when a voice behind him nearly caused him to\noverbalance.\n\n\"What the devil?\"\n\nArchie turned beamingly.\n\n\"Hullo, old thing! Many happy returns of the day!\"\n\nMr. Brewster was standing in a frozen attitude. His strong face was\nslightly flushed.\n\n\"What--what--?\" he gurgled.\n\nMr. Brewster was not in one of his sunniest moods that morning. The\nproprietor of a large hotel has many things to disturb him, and to-day\nthings had been going wrong. He had come up to his suite with the idea\nof restoring his shaken nerve system with a quiet cigar, and the sight\nof his son-in-law had, as so frequently happened, made him feel worse\nthan ever. But, when Archie had descended from the chair and moved aside\nto allow him an uninterrupted view of the picture, Mr. Brewster realised\nthat a worse thing had befallen him than a mere visit from one who\nalways made him feel that the world was a bleak place.\n\nHe stared at the Venus dumbly. Unlike most hotel-proprietors, Daniel\nBrewster was a connoisseur of Art. Connoisseuring was, in fact, his\nhobby. Even the public rooms of the Cosmopolis were decorated with\ntaste, and his own private suite was a shrine of all that was best and\nmost artistic. His tastes were quiet and restrained, and it is not too\nmuch to say that the Wigmore Venus hit him behind the ear like a stuffed\neel-skin.\n\nSo great was the shock that for some moments it kept him silent, and\nbefore he could recover speech Archie had explained.\n\n\"It's a birthday present from Lucille, don't you know.\"\n\nMr. Brewster crushed down the breezy speech he had intended to utter.\n\n\"Lucille gave me--that?\" he muttered.\n\nHe swallowed pathetically. He was suffering, but the iron courage of the\nBrewsters stood him in good stead. This man was no weakling. Presently\nthe rigidity of his face relaxed. He was himself again. Of all things\nin the world he loved his daughter most, and if, in whatever mood of\ntemporary insanity, she had brought herself to suppose that this beastly\ndaub was the sort of thing he would like for a birthday present, he must\naccept the situation like a man. He would on the whole have preferred\ndeath to a life lived in the society of the Wigmore Venus, but even that\ntorment must be endured if the alternative was the hurting of Lucille's\nfeelings.\n\n\"I think I've chosen a pretty likely spot to hang the thing, what?\" said\nArchie cheerfully. \"It looks well alongside those Japanese prints, don't\nyou think? Sort of stands out.\"\n\nMr. Brewster licked his dry lips and grinned a ghastly grin.\n\n\"It does stand out!\" he agreed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. A TALE OF A GRANDFATHER\n\n\nArchie was not a man who readily allowed himself to become worried,\nespecially about people who were not in his own immediate circle of\nfriends, but in the course of the next week he was bound to admit that\nhe was not altogether easy in his mind about his father-in-law's mental\ncondition. He had read all sorts of things in the Sunday papers and\nelsewhere about the constant strain to which captains of industry are\nsubjected, a strain which sooner or later is only too apt to make\nthe victim go all blooey, and it seemed to him that Mr. Brewster\nwas beginning to find the going a trifle too tough for his stamina.\nUndeniably he was behaving in an odd manner, and Archie, though\nno physician, was aware that, when the American business-man, that\nrestless, ever-active human machine, starts behaving in an odd manner,\nthe next thing you know is that two strong men, one attached to each\narm, are hurrying him into the cab bound for Bloomingdale.\n\nHe did not confide his misgivings to Lucille, not wishing to cause her\nanxiety. He hunted up Reggie van Tuyl at the club, and sought advice\nfrom him.\n\n\"I say, Reggie, old thing--present company excepted--have there been any\nloonies in your family?\"\n\nReggie stirred in the slumber which always gripped him in the early\nafternoon.\n\n\"Loonies?\" he mumbled, sleepily. \"Rather! My uncle Edgar thought he was\ntwins.\"\n\n\"Twins, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes. Silly idea! I mean, you'd have thought one of my uncle Edgar would\nhave been enough for any man.\"\n\n\"How did the thing start?\" asked Archie.\n\n\"Start? Well, the first thing we noticed was when he began wanting two\nof everything. Had to set two places for him at dinner and so on. Always\nwanted two seats at the theatre. Ran into money, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"He didn't behave rummily up till then? I mean to say, wasn't sort of\njumpy and all that?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember. Why?\"\n\nArchie's tone became grave.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you, old man, though I don't want it to go any farther,\nthat I'm a bit worried about my jolly old father-in-law. I believe he's\nabout to go in off the deep-end. I think he's cracking under the strain.\nDashed weird his behaviour has been the last few days.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" murmured Mr. van Tuyl.\n\n\"Well, the other morning I happened to be in his suite--incidentally he\nwouldn't go above ten dollars, and I wanted twenty-five-and he suddenly\npicked up a whacking big paper-weight and bunged it for all he was\nworth.\"\n\n\"At you?\"\n\n\"Not at me. That was the rummy part of it. At a mosquito on the wall, he\nsaid. Well, I mean to say, do chappies bung paper-weights at mosquitoes?\nI mean, is it done?\"\n\n\"Smash anything?\"\n\n\"Curiously enough, no. But he only just missed a rather decent picture\nwhich Lucille had given him for his birthday. Another foot to the left\nand it would have been a goner.\"\n\n\"Sounds queer.\"\n\n\"And, talking of that picture, I looked in on him about a couple of\nafternoons later, and he'd taken it down from the wall and laid it on\nthe floor and was staring at it in a dashed marked sort of manner. That\nwas peculiar, what?\"\n\n\"On the floor?\"\n\n\"On the jolly old carpet. When I came in, he was goggling at it in a\nsort of glassy way. Absolutely rapt, don't you know. My coming in gave\nhim a start--seemed to rouse him from a kind of trance, you know--and he\njumped like an antelope; and, if I hadn't happened to grab him, he would\nhave trampled bang on the thing. It was deuced unpleasant, you know. His\nmanner was rummy. He seemed to be brooding on something. What ought I to\ndo about it, do you think? It's not my affair, of course, but it\nseams to me that, if he goes on like this, one of these days he'll be\nstabbing, someone with a pickle-fork.\"\n\nTo Archie's relief, his father-in-law's symptoms showed no signs of\ndevelopment. In fact, his manner reverted to the normal once more, and\na few days later, meeting Archie in the lobby of the hotel, he seemed\nquite cheerful. It was not often that he wasted his time talking to his\nson-in-law, but on this occasion he chatted with him for several minutes\nabout the big picture-robbery which had formed the chief item of news\non the front pages of the morning papers that day. It was Mr. Brewster's\nopinion that the outrage had been the work of a gang and that nobody was\nsafe.\n\nDaniel Brewster had spoken of this matter with strange earnestness, but\nhis words had slipped from Archie's mind when he made his way that night\nto his father-in-law's suite. Archie was in an exalted mood. In the\ncourse of dinner he had had a bit of good news which was occupying his\nthoughts to the exclusion of all other matters. It had left him in a\ncomfortable, if rather dizzy, condition of benevolence to all created\nthings. He had smiled at the room-clerk as he crossed the lobby, and if\nhe had had a dollar, he would have given it to the boy who took him up\nin the elevator.\n\nHe found the door of the Brewster suite unlocked which at any other time\nwould have struck him as unusual; but to-night he was in no frame of\nmind to notice these trivialities. He went in, and, finding the room\ndark and no one at home, sat down, too absorbed in his thoughts to\nswitch on the lights, and gave himself up to dreamy meditation.\n\nThere are certain moods in which one loses count of time, and Archie\ncould not have said how long he had been sitting in the deep arm-chair\nnear the window when he first became aware that he was not alone in the\nroom. He had closed his eyes, the better to meditate, so had not seen\nanyone enter. Nor had he heard the door open. The first intimation\nhe had that somebody had come in was when some hard substance knocked\nagainst some other hard object, producing a sharp sound which brought\nhim back to earth with a jerk.\n\nHe sat up silently. The fact that the room was still in darkness made it\nobvious that something nefarious was afoot. Plainly there was dirty work\nin preparation at the cross-roads. He stared into the blackness, and, as\nhis eyes grew accustomed to it, was presently able to see an indistinct\nform bending over something on the floor. The sound of rather stertorous\nbreathing came to him.\n\nArchie had many defects which prevented him being the perfect man,\nbut lack of courage was not one of them. His somewhat rudimentary\nintelligence had occasionally led his superior officers during the war\nto thank God that Great Britain had a Navy, but even these stern critics\nhad found nothing to complain of in the manner in which he bounded over\nthe top. Some of us are thinkers, others men of action. Archie was a man\nof action, and he was out of his chair and sailing in the direction of\nthe back of the intruder's neck before a wiser man would have completed\nhis plan of campaign. The miscreant collapsed under him with a squashy\nsound, like the wind going out of a pair of bellows, and Archie, taking\na firm seat on his spine, rubbed the other's face in the carpet and\nawaited the progress of events.\n\nAt the end of half a minute it became apparent that there was going\nto be no counter-attack. The dashing swiftness of the assault had\napparently had the effect of depriving the marauder of his entire stock\nof breath. He was gurgling to himself in a pained sort of way and making\nno effort to rise. Archie, feeling that it would be safe to get up\nand switch on the light, did so, and, turning after completing this\nmanoeuvre, was greeted by the spectacle of his father-in-law, seated\non the floor in a breathless and dishevelled condition, blinking at the\nsudden illumination. On the carpet beside Mr. Brewster lay a long knife,\nand beside the knife lay the handsomely framed masterpiece of J. B.\nWheeler's fiancee, Miss Alice Wigmore. Archie stared at this collection\ndumbly.\n\n\"Oh, what-ho!\" he observed at length, feebly.\n\nA distinct chill manifested itself in the region of Archie's spine. This\ncould mean only one thing. His fears had been realised. The strain of\nmodern life, with all its hustle and excitement, had at last proved too\nmuch for Mr. Brewster. Crushed by the thousand and one anxieties and\nworries of a millionaire's existence, Daniel Brewster had gone off his\nonion.\n\nArchie was nonplussed. This was his first experience of this kind of\nthing. What, he asked himself, was the proper procedure in a situation\nof this sort? What was the local rule? Where, in a word, did he go from\nhere? He was still musing in an embarrassed and baffled way, having\ntaken the precaution of kicking the knife under the sofa, when Mr.\nBrewster spoke. And there was in, both the words and the method of\ntheir delivery so much of his old familiar self that Archie felt quite\nrelieved.\n\n\"So it's you, is it, you wretched blight, you miserable weed!\" said\nMr. Brewster, having recovered enough breath to be going on with. He\nglowered at his son-in-law despondently. \"I might have, expected it! If\nI was at the North Pole, I could count on you butting in!\"\n\n\"Shall I get you a drink of water?\" said Archie.\n\n\"What the devil,\" demanded Mr. Brewster, \"do you imagine I want with a\ndrink of water?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Archie hesitated delicately. \"I had a sort of idea that you had\nbeen feeling the strain a bit. I mean to say, rush of modern life and\nall that sort of thing--\"\n\n\"What are you doing in my room?\" said Mr. Brewster, changing the\nsubject.\n\n\"Well, I came to tell you something, and I came in here and was waiting\nfor you, and I saw some chappie biffing about in the dark, and I thought\nit was a burglar or something after some of your things, so, thinking it\nover, I got the idea that it would be a fairly juicy scheme to land on\nhim with both feet. No idea it was you, old thing! Frightfully sorry and\nall that. Meant well!\"\n\nMr. Brewster sighed deeply. He was a just man, and he could not but\nrealise that, in the circumstances, Archie had behaved not unnaturally.\n\n\"Oh, well!\" he said. \"I might have known something would go wrong.\"\n\n\"Awfully sorry!\"\n\n\"It can't be helped. What was it you wanted to tell me?\" He eyed his\nson-in-law piercingly. \"Not a cent over twenty dollars!\" he said coldly.\n\nArchie hastened to dispel the pardonable error.\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything like that,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, I\nthink it's a good egg. It has bucked me up to no inconsiderable\ndegree. I was dining with Lucille just now, and, as we dallied with the\nfood-stuffs, she told me something which--well, I'm bound to say, it\nmade me feel considerably braced. She told me to trot along and ask you\nif you would mind--\"\n\n\"I gave Lucille a hundred dollars only last Tuesday.\"\n\nArchie was pained.\n\n\"Adjust this sordid outlook, old thing!\" he urged. \"You simply aren't\nanywhere near it. Right off the target, absolutely! What Lucille told me\nto ask you was if you would mind--at some tolerably near date--being\na grandfather! Rotten thing to be, of course,\" proceeded Archie\ncommiseratingly, \"for a chappie of your age, but there it is!\"\n\nMr. Brewster gulped.\n\n\"Do you mean to say--?\"\n\n\"I mean, apt to make a fellow feel a bit of a patriarch. Snowy hair and\nwhat not. And, of course, for a chappie in the prime of life like you--\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me--? Is this true?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Of course, speaking for myself, I'm all for it. I don't\nknow when I've felt more bucked. I sang as I came up here--absolutely\nwarbled in the elevator. But you--\"\n\nA curious change had come over Mr. Brewster. He was one of those men who\nhave the appearance of having been hewn out of the solid rock, but now\nin some indescribable way he seemed to have melted. For a moment he\ngazed at Archie, then, moving quickly forward, he grasped his hand in an\niron grip.\n\n\"This is the best news I've ever had!\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Awfully good of you to take it like this,\" said Archie cordially. \"I\nmean, being a grandfather--\"\n\nMr. Brewster smiled. Of a man of his appearance one could hardly say\nthat he smiled playfully; but there was something in his expression that\nremotely suggested playfulness.\n\n\"My dear old bean,\" he said.\n\nArchie started.\n\n\"My dear old bean,\" repeated Mr. Brewster firmly, \"I'm the happiest man\nin America!\" His eye fell on the picture which lay on the floor. He gave\na slight shudder, but recovered himself immediately. \"After this,\" he\nsaid, \"I can reconcile myself to living with that thing for the rest of\nmy life. I feel it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I say,\" said Archie, \"how about that? Wouldn't have brought the thing\nup if you hadn't introduced the topic, but, speaking as man to man, what\nthe dickens WERE you up to when I landed on your spine just now?\"\n\n\"I suppose you thought I had gone off my head?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm bound to say--\"\n\nMr. Brewster cast an unfriendly glance at the picture.\n\n\"Well, I had every excuse, after living with that infernal thing for a\nweek!\"\n\nArchie looked at him, astonished.\n\n\"I say, old thing, I don't know if I have got your meaning exactly, but\nyou somehow give me the impression that you don't like that jolly old\nwork of Art.\"\n\n\"Like it!\" cried Mr. Brewster. \"It's nearly driven me mad! Every time\nit caught my eye, it gave me a pain in the neck. To-night I felt as if I\ncouldn't stand it any longer. I didn't want to hurt Lucille's feelings,\nby telling her, so I made up my mind I would cut the damned thing out of\nits frame and tell her it had been stolen.\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary thing! Why, that's exactly what old Wheeler did.\"\n\n\"Who is old Wheeler?\"\n\n\"Artist chappie. Pal of mine. His fiancee painted the thing, and, when\nI lifted it off him, he told her it had been stolen. HE didn't seem\nfrightfully keen on it, either.\"\n\n\"Your friend Wheeler has evidently good taste.\"\n\nArchie was thinking.\n\n\"Well, all this rather gets past me,\" he said. \"Personally, I've always\nadmired the thing. Dashed ripe bit of work, I've always considered.\nStill, of course, if you feel that way--\"\n\n\"You may take it from me that I do!\"\n\n\"Well, then, in that case--You know what a clumsy devil I am--You can\ntell Lucille it was all my fault--\"\n\nThe Wigmore Venus smiled up at Archie--it seemed to Archie with a\npathetic, pleading smile. For a moment he was conscious of a feeling of\nguilt; then, closing his eyes and hardening his heart, he sprang lightly\nin the air and descended with both feet on the picture. There was a\nsound of rending canvas, and the Venus ceased to smile.\n\n\"Golly!\" said Archie, regarding the wreckage remorsefully.\n\nMr. Brewster did not share his remorse. For the second time that night\nhe gripped him by the hand.\n\n\"My boy!\" he quavered. He stared at Archie as if he were seeing him with\nnew eyes. \"My dear boy, you were through the war, were you not?\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh yes! Right through the jolly old war.\"\n\n\"What was your rank?\"\n\n\"Oh, second lieutenant.\"\n\n\"You ought to have been a general!\" Mr. Brewster clasped his hand once\nmore in a vigorous embrace. \"I only hope,\" he added \"that your son will\nbe like you!\"\n\nThere are certain compliments, or compliments coming from certain\nsources, before which modesty reels, stunned. Archie's did.\n\nHe swallowed convulsively. He had never thought to hear these words from\nDaniel Brewster.\n\n\"How would it be, old thing,\" he said almost brokenly, \"if you and I\ntrickled down to the bar and had a spot of sherbet?\"\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Indiscretions of Archie, by P.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1192,"split":"test"}
