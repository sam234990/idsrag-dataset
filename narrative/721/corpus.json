{"ori_id":"a8a9976abcdea78a876f01bb592a693f4befb419","title":"Auriol (novel)","context":"Auriol (novel)\n Prologue (1599): Auriol Darcy is surprised attempting to remove the heads of two traitors from the Southwark Gateway of Old London Bridge. He is injured by the warder, Baldred, and carried to the house of Dr Lamb, an alchemist and Auriol Darcy's grandfather, who is assisted by his faithful dwarf Flapdragon. Lamb, on the point of discovering the elixir of life, has a seizure and dies as his ungrateful grandson consumes the draught.\nBook the first 'Ebba' (1830): Two varmints, Tinker and Sandman, waylay a gentleman in a fantastical ruined house in the Vauxhall Bridge Road in London, but they are surprised and he is carried unconscious to the house of Mr Thorneycroft, a scrap-iron dealer. While he convalesces and falls in love with Ebba, the iron-dealer's daughter, Tinker and Sandman and their associate Ginger (a 'dog-fancier' who steals dogs and resells them) discover in the gentleman's pocket-book the private diary of a man who has lived for over two hundred years, and has committed nameless crimes. Auriol (for it is he) seeks to dissuade Ebba from her love, for he bears an awful doom. A tall sinister stranger has Auriol in his power, and employs a dwarf (who is Flapdragon) to recover the pocket-book. The stranger confronts Auriol and informs his that Ebba must be surrendered to him according to their contract. Auriol refuses, but Ebba is snatched from him, and he is imprisoned, during a nocturnal assignation at a picturesque ruin near Millbank Street. Tinker, Sandman and Ginger offer their services to Mr Thorneycroft to attempt her rescue. Ebba is conveyed to a mysterious darkened chamber where the stranger demands that she sign a scroll surrendering herself body and soul to him. She calls to heaven for protection: in the darkness a tomb is revealed and opened by menacing cowled figures, and Auriol is brought forth. Ebba hurls herself into the tomb to precede him and save him, but then re-emerges silent and cowled to sign the scroll.\nIntermean (1800): Cyprian Rougemont visits a deserted mansion at Stepney Green, where he finds the portrait of his ancestor (of the same name), a Rosicrucian brother of the 16th century, one of the Illuminati. Satan has appeared to him in a dream and promised him an ancestral treasure, the price for which is his own soul, or that of Auriol Darcy. Cyprian strikes the portrait and a plaque falls away, revealing the access to the ancestral tomb. There in a seven-sided vault lit by the ever-burning lamp and painted with kabbalistic symbols he finds the uncorrupt body with a book of mysteries, a vial of infernal potion, and a series of chests filled with gold, silver and jewels. With use of the potion, he lures Auriol into a compact whereby he is given a magnificent mansion in St James's Square and \u00c2\u0141120,000, in exchange for a female victim whenever Rougemont requires one from him. Thus Auriol can win the woman he loves, Elizabeth Talbot; but Rougemont, once the contract is signed, demands Elizabeth Talbot as his first victim, in a week's time. Auriol seeks to defy him and to marry her within the week, but he is thwarted and Elizabeth is abducted on the seventh night.\nBook the Second, 'Cyprian Rougemont' (1830): Thorneycroft, Sandman and Tinker (with Ginger) continue their pursuit led by another, who is the brother of Rougemont's second victim, Clara Paston. They enter a mysterious mansion, and becoming trapped in a chamber and locked into enchanted or mechanically-contrived chairs three of them are muffled by bell-masks which descend from the ceiling, and then plunged through traps in the floor. Flapdragon appears and attempts to help them find Ebba, while Paston, Ginger and Thorneycroft find Rougemont and confront him with pistols, but Rougemont is impervious to the bullets. Thorneycroft, Tinker and Sandman are trapped in a pit over which an iron roof closes by a giant mechanical contrivance, and Ebba is never found again. Auriol, meanwhile, awakes to find himself in Elizabethan costume, chained in a vaulted dungeon. The voice of Rougemont addresses him, telling him that he has been mad, but that he has given him a potion to heal him, and is his keeper. James I is now the King of England. Old Dr Lamb is still living, and his dwarf Flapdragon, and Auriol is taken to him, where they begin to hope that Auriol's cure has been effected. He becomes convinced that he has lived centuries in a few nights and has awakened from a delusion... but even in the last sentence, addressing Dr Lamb, the author relates what he says to his supposed grandsire.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Auriol, by W.

LAMB_\n\n\nThe Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the last day of the last\nyear, and two hours only were wanting to the birth of another year and\nof another century.\n\nThe night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of stars paved the deep\nvault of heaven; the crescent moon hung like a silver lamp in the midst\nof them; a stream of rosy and quivering light, issuing from the north,\ntraversed the sky, like the tail of some stupendous comet; while from\nits point of effluence broke forth, ever and anon, coruscations\nrivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most brilliant discharge\nof fireworks.\n\nA sharp frost prevailed; but the atmosphere was clear and dry, and\nneither wind nor snow aggravated the wholesome rigour of the season. The\nwater lay in thick congealed masses around the conduits and wells, and\nthe buckets were frozen on their stands. The thoroughfares were sheeted\nwith ice, and dangerous to horsemen and vehicles; but the footways were\nfirm and pleasant to the tread.\n\nHere and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round which ragged\nurchins and mendicants were collected, roasting fragments of meat stuck\nupon iron prongs, or quaffing deep draughts of metheglin and ale out of\nleathern cups. Crowds were collected in the open places, watching the\nwonders in the heavens, and drawing auguries from them, chiefly\nsinister, for most of the beholders thought the signs portended the\nspeedy death of the queen, and the advent of a new monarch from the\nnorth--a safe and easy interpretation, considering the advanced age and\ndeclining health of the illustrious Elizabeth, together with the known\nappointment of her successor, James of Scotland.\n\nNotwithstanding the early habits of the times, few persons had retired\nto rest, an universal wish prevailing among the citizens to see the new\nyear in, and welcome the century accompanying it. Lights glimmered in\nmost windows, revealing the holly-sprigs and laurel-leaves stuck thickly\nin their diamond panes; while, whenever a door was opened, a ruddy gleam\nburst across the street, and a glance inside the dwelling showed its\ninmates either gathered round the glowing hearth, occupied in mirthful\nsports--fox-i'-th'-hole, blind-man's buff, or shoe-the-mare--or seated\nat the ample board groaning with Christmas cheer.\n\nMusic and singing were heard at every corner, and bands of comely\ndamsels, escorted by their sweethearts, went from house to house,\nbearing huge brown bowls dressed with ribands and rosemary, and filled\nwith a drink called \"lamb's-wool,\" composed of sturdy ale, sweetened\nwith sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and having toasts and burnt crabs\nfloating within it--a draught from which seldom brought its pretty\nbearers less than a groat, and occasionally a more valuable coin.\n\nSuch was the vigil of the year sixteen hundred.\n\nOn this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking and venerable\nappearance was seen to emerge upon a small wooden balcony, projecting\nfrom a bay-window near the top of a picturesque structure situated at\nthe southern extremity of London Bridge.\n\nThe old man's beard and hair were as white as snow--the former\ndescending almost to his girdle; so were the thick, overhanging brows\nthat shaded his still piercing eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and\nploughed by innumerable wrinkles. His countenance, despite its\ndeath-like paleness, had a noble and majestic cast; and his figure,\nthough worn to the bone by a life of the severest study, and bent by the\nweight of years, must have been once lofty and commanding. His dress\nconsisted of a doublet and hose of sad-coloured cloth, over which he\nwore a loose gown of black silk. His head was covered by a square black\ncap, from beneath which his silver locks strayed over his shoulders.\n\nKnown by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addicted to alchemical and\nphilosophical pursuits, this venerable personage was esteemed by the\nvulgar as little better than a wizard. Strange tales were reported and\nbelieved of him. Amongst others, it was said that he possessed a\nfamiliar, because he chanced to employ a deformed, crack-brained dwarf,\nwho assisted him in his operations, and whom he appropriately enough\ndenominated Flapdragon.\n\nDoctor Lamb's gaze was fixed intently upon the heavens, and he seamed\nto be noting the position of the moon with reference to some particular\nstar.\n\nAfter remaining in this posture for a few minutes, he was about to\nretire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he turned to see whence it\nproceeded.\n\nImmediately before him stood the Southwark Gateway--a square stone\nbuilding, with a round, embattled turret at each corner, and a flat\nleaden roof, planted with a forest of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet\nhigh, garnished with human heads. To his surprise, the doctor perceived\nthat two of these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who was\nin the act of stripping them of their grisly burdens.\n\nHaving accomplished his object, the mysterious plunderer thrust his\nspoil into a leathern bag with which he was provided, tied its mouth,\nand was about to take his departure by means of a rope-ladder attached\nto the battlements, when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the\ngatekeeper, armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, who issued from\na door opening upon the leads.\n\nThe baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the open window at\nwhich Doctor Lamb was stationed, hurled the sack and its contents\nthrough it. He then tried to gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the\ngatekeeper, who dealt him a severe blow on the head with his halberd.\nThe plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw his sword; but\nbefore he could do so, he received a thrust in the side from his\nopponent. He then fell, and the gatekeeper would have repeated the blow,\nif the doctor had not called to him to desist.\n\n\"Do not kill him, good Baldred,\" he cried. \"The attempt may not be so\ncriminal as it appears. Doubtless, the mutilated remains which the poor\nwretch has attempted to carry off are those of his kindred, and horror\nat their exposure must have led him to commit the offence.\"\n\n\"It may be, doctor,\" replied Baldred; \"and if so I shall be sorry I have\nhurt him. But I am responsible for the safe custody of these traitorous\nrelics, and it is as much as my own head is worth to permit their\nremoval.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" replied Doctor Lamb; \"and you are fully justified in what\nyou have done. It may throw some light upon the matter, to know whose\nmiserable remains have been disturbed.\"\n\n\"They were the heads of two rank papists,\" replied Baldred, \"who were\ndecapitated on Tower Hill, on Saint Nicholas's Day, three weeks ago, for\nconspiring against the queen.\"\n\n\"But their names?\" demanded the doctor. \"How were they called?\"\n\n\"They were father and son,\" replied Baldred--\"Sir Simon Darcy and Master\nReginald Darcy. Perchance they were known to your worship?\"\n\n\"Too well--too well!\" replied Doctor Lamb, in a voice of emotion that\nstartled his hearer. \"They were near kinsmen of mine own. What is he\nlike who has made this strange attempt?\"\n\n\"Of a verity, a fair youth,\" replied Baldred, holding down the lantern.\n\"Heaven grant I have not wounded him to the death! No, his heart still\nbeats. Ha! here are his tablets,\" he added, taking a small book from\nhis doublet; \"these may give the information you seek. You were right\nin your conjecture, doctor. The name herein inscribed is the same as\nthat borne by the others--Auriol Darcy.\"\n\n\"I see it all,\" cried Lamb. \"It was a pious and praiseworthy deed. Bring\nthe unfortunate youth to my dwelling, Baldred, and you shall be well\nrewarded. Use despatch, I pray you.\"\n\nAs the gatekeeper essayed to comply, the wounded man groaned deeply, as\nif in great pain.\n\n\"Fling me the weapon with which you smote him,\" cried Doctor Lamb, in\naccents of commiseration, \"and I will anoint it with the powder of\nsympathy. His anguish will be speedily abated.\"\n\n\"I know your worship can accomplish wonders,\" cried Baldred, throwing\nthe halberd into the balcony. \"I will do my part as gently as I can.\"\n\nAnd as the alchemist took up the weapon, and disappeared through the\nwindow, the gatekeeper lifted the wounded man by the shoulders, and\nconveyed him down a narrow, winding staircase to a lower chamber. Though\nhe proceeded carefully, the sufferer was put to excruciating pain; and\nwhen Baldred placed him on a wooden bench, and held a lamp towards him,\nhe perceived that his features were darkened and distorted.\n\n\"I fear it's all over with him,\" murmured the gatekeeper; \"I shall have\na dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It would be a charity to knock him\non the head, rather than let him suffer thus. The doctor passes for a\ncunning man, but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing him, by\nthe help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe, what\nsome folks avouch, that he has relations with the devil.\"\n\nWhile Baldred was ruminating in this manner, a sudden and extraordinary\nchange took place in the sufferer. As if by magic, the contraction of\nthe muscles subsided; the features assumed a wholesome hue, and the\nrespiration was no longer laborious. Baldred stared as if a miracle had\nbeen wrought.\n\nNow that the countenance of the youth had regained its original\nexpression, the gatekeeper could not help being struck by its extreme\nbeauty. The face was a perfect oval, with regular and delicate features.\nA short silken moustache covered the upper lip, which was short and\nproud, and a pointed beard terminated the chin. The hair was black,\nglossy, and cut short, so as to disclose a highly intellectual expanse\nof brow.\n\nThe youth's figure was slight, but admirably proportioned. His attire\nconsisted of a black satin doublet, slashed with white, hose of black\nsilk, and a short velvet mantle. His eyes were still closed, and it was\ndifficult to say what effect they might give to the face when they\nlighted it up; but notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to\nadmit that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression\npervaded the countenance.\n\nAll at once, and with as much suddenness as his cure had been effected,\nthe young man started, uttering a piercing cry, and placed his hand to\nhis side.\n\n\"Caitiff!\" he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gatekeeper, \"why do\nyou torture me thus? Finish me at once--Oh!\"\n\nAnd overcome by anguish, he sank back again.\n\n\"I have not touched you, sir,\" replied Baldred. \"I brought you here to\nsuccour you. You will be easier anon. Doctor Lamb must have wiped the\nhalberd,\" he added to himself.\n\nAnother sudden change. The pain fled from the sufferer's countenance,\nand he became easy as before.\n\n\"What have you done to me?\" he asked, with a look of gratitude; \"the\ntorture of my wound has suddenly ceased, and I feel as if a balm had\nbeen dropped into it. Let me remain in this state if you have any\npity--or despatch me, for my late agony was almost insupportable.\"\n\n\"You are cared for by one who has greater skill than any chirurgeon in\nLondon,\" replied Baldred. \"If I can manage to transport you to his\nlodgings, he will speedily heal your wounds.\"\n\n\"Do not delay, then,\" replied Auriol faintly; \"for though I am free from\npain, I feel that my life is ebbing fast away.\"\n\n\"Press this handkerchief to your side, and lean on me,\" said Baldred.\n\"Doctor Lamb's dwelling is but a step from the gateway--in fact, the\nfirst house on the bridge. By the way, the doctor declares he is your\nkinsman.\"\n\n\"It is the first I ever heard of him,\" replied Auriol faintly; \"but take\nme to him quickly, or it will be too late.\"\n\nIn another moment they were at the doctor's door. Baldred tapped against\nit, and the summons was instantly answered by a diminutive personage,\nclad in a jerkin of coarse grey serge, and having a leathern apron tied\nround his waist. This was Flapdragon.\n\nBlear-eyed, smoke-begrimed, lantern-jawed, the poor dwarf seemed as if\nhis whole life had been spent over the furnace. And so, in fact, it had\nbeen. He had become little better than a pair of human bellows. In his\nhand he held the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded.\n\n\"So you have been playing the leech, Flapdragon, eh?\" cried Baldred.\n\n\"Ay, marry have I,\" replied the dwarf, with a wild grin, and displaying\na wolfish set of teeth. \"My master ordered me to smear the halberd with\nthe sympathetic ointment. I obeyed him: rubbed the steel point, first on\none side, then on the other; next wiped it; and then smeared it again.\"\n\n\"Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,\" replied Baldred; \"but\nhelp me to transport him to the laboratory.\"\n\n\"I know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed,\" said Flapdragon.\n\"He is busily engaged on a grand operation.\"\n\n\"I will take the risk on myself,\" said Baldred. \"The youth will die if\nhe remains here. See, he has fainted already!\"\n\nThus urged, the dwarf laid down the halberd, and between the two, Auriol\nwas speedily conveyed up a wide oaken staircase to the laboratory.\nDoctor Lamb was plying the bellows at the furnace, on which a large\nalembic was placed, and he was so engrossed by his task that he scarcely\nnoticed the entrance of the others.\n\n\"Place the youth on the ground, and rear his head against the chair,\" he\ncried, hastily, to the dwarf. \"Bathe his brows with the decoction in\nthat crucible. I will attend to him anon. Come to me on the morrow,\nBaldred, and I will repay thee for thy trouble. I am busy now.\"\n\n\"These relics, doctor,\" cried the gatekeeper, glancing at the bag, which\nwas lying on the ground, and from which a bald head protruded--\"I ought\nto take them back with me.\"\n\n\"Heed them not--they will be safe in my keeping,\" cried Doctor Lamb\nimpatiently; \"to-morrow--to-morrow.\"\n\nCasting a furtive glance round the laboratory, and shrugging his\nshoulders, Baldred departed; and Flapdragon having bathed the sufferer's\ntemples with the decoction, in obedience to his master's injunctions,\nturned to inquire what he should do next.\n\n\"Begone!\" cried the doctor, so fiercely that the dwarf darted out of the\nroom, clapping the door after him.\n\nDoctor Lamb then applied himself to his task with renewed ardour, and in\na few seconds became wholly insensible of the presence of a stranger.\n\nRevived by the stimulant, Auriol presently opened his eyes, and gazing\nround the room, thought he must be dreaming, so strange and fantastical\ndid all appear. The floor was covered with the implements used by the\nadept--bolt-heads, crucibles, cucurbites, and retorts, scattered about\nwithout any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a large\nterrestrial sphere: near it was an astrolabe, and near that a\nheap of disused glass vessels. On the other side lay a black,\nmysterious-looking book, fastened with brazen clasps. Around it were a\nram's horn, a pair of forceps, a roll of parchment, a pestle and mortar,\nand a large plate of copper, graven with the mysterious symbols of the\nIsaical table. Near this was the leathern bag containing the two\ndecapitated heads, one of which had burst forth. On a table at the\nfarther end of the room, stood a large open volume, with parchment\nleaves, covered with cabalistical characters, referring to the names of\nspirits. Near it were two parchment scrolls, written in letters,\nrespectively denominated by the Chaldaic sages, \"the Malachim,\" and \"the\nPassing of the River.\" One of these scrolls was kept in its place by a\nskull. An ancient and grotesque-looking brass lamp, with two\nsnake-headed burners, lighted the room. From the ceiling depended a huge\nscaly sea-monster, with outspread fins, open jaws garnished with\ntremendous teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial\nsphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously carved, and projected far\ninto the room, was laden with various implements of hermetic science.\nAbove it were hung dried bats and flitter-mice, interspersed with the\nskulls of birds and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary,\nsculptured in stone, near which hung a large starfish. The fireplace was\noccupied by the furnace, on which, as has been stated, was placed an\nalembic, communicating by means of a long serpentine pipe with a\nreceiver. Within the room were two skeletons, one of which, placed\nbehind a curtain in the deep embrasure of the window, where its polished\nbones glistened in the white moonlight, had a horrible effect. The\nother enjoyed more comfortable quarters near the chimney, its fleshless\nfeet dangling down in the smoke arising from the furnace.\n\nDoctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursued his task, though he ever and\nanon paused, to fling certain roots and drugs upon the charcoal. As he\ndid this, various-coloured flames broke forth--now blue, now green, now\nblood-red.\n\nTinged by these fires, the different objects in the chamber seemed to\ntake other forms, and to become instinct with animation. The\ngourd-shaped cucurbites were transformed into great bloated toads\nbursting with venom; the long-necked bolt-heads became monstrous\nserpents; the worm-like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked\nlike plumed helmets; the characters on the Isaical table, and those on\nthe parchments, seemed traced in fire, and to be ever changing; the\nsea-monster bellowed and roared, and, flapping his fins, tried to burst\nfrom his hook; the skeletons wagged their jaws, and raised their\nfleshless fingers in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless\nsockets; the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with its\nwings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of the archfiend\npresiding over a witches' sabbath.\n\nAuriol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his eyes, to exclude\nthese phantasms from his sight. But even thus they pursued him; and he\nimagined he could hear the infernal riot going on around him.\n\nSuddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, uncovering his eyes,\nhe beheld Doctor Lamb pouring the contents of the matrass--a bright,\ntransparent liquid--into a small phial. Having carefully secured the\nbottle with a glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and\ngazed at it with rapture.\n\n\"At length,\" he exclaimed aloud--\"at length, the great work is achieved.\nWith the birth of the century now expiring I first saw light, and the\ndraught I hold in my hand shall enable me to see the opening of\ncenturies and centuries to come. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar\nstones, and the mercurial stones--prepared according to the instructions\nof the Rabbi Ben Lucca--namely, by the separation of the pure from the\nimpure, the volatilisation of the fixed, and the fixing of the\nvolatile--this elixir shall renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and\ngive me length of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.\"\n\nWhile thus speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid, and gazed at it\nlike a Persian worshipping the sun.\n\n\"To live for ever!\" he cried, after a pause--\"to escape the jaws of\ndeath just when they are opening to devour me!--to be free from all\naccidents!--'tis a glorious thought! Ha! I bethink me, the rabbi said\nthere was _one_ peril against which the elixir could not guard me--_one_\nvulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death might reach\nme! What is it!--where can it lie?\"\n\nAnd he relapsed into deep thought.\n\n\"This uncertainty will poison all my happiness,\" he continued; \"I shall\nlive in constant dread, as of an invisible enemy. But no matter!\nPerpetual life!--perpetual youth!--what more need be desired?\"\n\n\"What more, indeed!\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the wounded man, and\nconcealing the phial beneath his gown.\n\n\"Your caution is vain, doctor,\" said Auriol. \"I have heard what you have\nuttered. You fancy you have discovered the _elixir vit\u00c3\u00a6_.\"\n\n\"Fancy I have discovered it!\" cried Doctor Lamb. \"The matter is past all\ndoubt. I am the possessor of the wondrous secret, which the greatest\nphilosophers of all ages have sought to discover--the miraculous\npreservative of the body against decay.\"\n\n\"The man who brought me hither told me you were my kinsman,\" said\nAuriol. \"Is it so?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied the doctor, \"and you shall now learn the connection\nthat subsists between us. Look at that ghastly relic,\" he added,\npointing to the head protruding from the bag: \"that was once my son\nSimon. His son's head is within the sack--your father's head--so that\nfour generations are brought together.\"\n\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" exclaimed the young man, raising himself on his\nelbow. \"You, then, are my great-grandsire. My father supposed you had\ndied in his infancy. An old tale runs in the family that you were\ncharged with sorcery, and fled to avoid the stake.\"\n\n\"It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at present,\" replied\nthe old man, \"but I need scarcely say that the charge brought against me\nwas false. I have devoted myself to abstrusest science, have held\ncommune with the stars, and have wrested the most hidden secrets from\nNature--but that is all. Two crimes alone have stained my soul; but\nboth, I trust, have been expiated by repentance.\"\n\n\"Were they deeds of blood?\" asked Auriol.\n\n\"One was so,\" replied Darcy, with a shudder. \"It was a cowardly and\ntreacherous deed, aggravated by the basest ingratitude. Listen, and you\nshall hear how it chanced. A Roman rabbi, named Ben Lucca, skilled in\nhermetic science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I sought\nhim out, offering myself as his disciple. For months, I remained with\nhim in his laboratory--working at the furnace, and poring over mystic\nlore. One night he showed me that volume, and, pointing to a page within\nit, said: 'Those characters contain the secret of confecting the elixir\nof life. I will now explain them to you, and afterwards we will proceed\nto the operation.' With this, he unfolded the mystery; but he bade me\nobserve, that the menstruum was defective on one point. Wherefore, he\nsaid, 'there will still be peril from some hidden cause.' Oh, with what\ngreediness I drank in his words! How I gazed at the mystic characters,\nas he explained their import! What visions floated before me of\nperpetual youth and enjoyment. At that moment a demon whispered in my\near, 'This secret must be thine own. No one else must possess it.'\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Auriol, starting.\n\n\"The evil thought was no sooner conceived than acted upon,\" pursued\nDarcy. \"Instantly drawing my poniard, I plunged it to the rabbi's heart.\nBut mark what followed. His blood fell upon the book, and obliterated\nthe characters; nor could I by any effort of memory recall the\ncomposition of the elixir.\"\n\n\"When did you regain the secret?\" asked Auriol curiously.\n\n\"To-night,\" replied Darcy--\"within this hour. For nigh fifty years after\nthat fatal night I have been making fruitless experiments. A film of\nblood has obscured my mental sight. I have proceeded by calcitration,\nsolution, putrefaction--have produced the oils which will fix crude\nmercury, and convert all bodies into sol and luna; but I have ever\nfailed in fermenting the stone into the true elixir. To-night, it came\ninto my head to wash the blood-stained page containing the secret with a\nsubtle liquid. I did so; and doubting the efficacy of the experiment,\nleft it to work, while I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My\neyes were cast upwards, and I was struck with the malignant aspect of my\nstar. How to reconcile this with the good fortune which has just\nbefallen me, I know not--but so it was. At this juncture, your rash but\npious attempt occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined\nthe gatekeeper to bring you hither, I returned to my old laboratory. On\nglancing towards the mystic volume, what was my surprise to see the page\nfree from blood!\"\n\nAuriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the book with\nsuperstitious awe.\n\n\"The sight was so surprising that I dropped the sack I had brought with\nme,\" pursued Darcy. \"Fearful of again losing the secret, I nerved myself\nto the task, and placing fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendant with\nbrief injunctions relative to you. I then set to work. How I have\nsucceeded, you perceive. I hold in my hand the treasure I have so long\nsought--so eagerly coveted. The whole world's wealth should not purchase\nit from me.\"\n\nAuriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said nothing.\n\n\"In a few moments I shall be as full of vigour and activity as\nyourself,\" continued Darcy. \"We shall be no longer the great-grandsire\nand his descendant, but friends--companions--equals,--equals in age,\nstrength, activity, beauty, fortune--for youth _is_ fortune--ha! ha!\nMethinks I am already young again!\"\n\n\"You spoke of two crimes with which your conscience was burdened,\"\nremarked Auriol. \"You have mentioned but one.\"\n\n\"The other was not so foul as that I have described,\" replied Darcy, in\nan altered tone, \"inasmuch as it was unintentional, and occasioned by no\nbase motive. My wife, your ancestress, was a most lovely woman, and so\npassionately was I enamoured of her, that I tried by every art to\nheighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flesh of capons,\nnourished with vipers; caused her to steep her lovely limbs in baths\ndistilled from roses and violets; and had recourse to the most potent\ncosmetics. At last I prepared a draught from poisons--yes,\n_poisons_--the effect of which, I imagined, would be wondrous. She drank\nit, and expired horribly disfigured. Conceive my despair at beholding\nthe fair image of my idolatry destroyed--defaced by my hand. In my\nfrenzy I should have laid violent hands upon myself, if I had not been\nrestrained. Love may again rule my heart--beauty may again dazzle my\neyes, but I shall never more feel the passion I entertained for my lost\nAmice--never more behold charms equal to hers.\"\n\nAnd he pressed his hand to his face.\n\n\"The mistake you then committed should serve as a warning,\" said Auriol.\n\"What if it be poison you have now confected? Try a few drops of it on\nsome animal.\"\n\n\"No--no; it is the true elixir,\" replied Darcy. \"Not a drop must be\nwasted. You will witness its effect anon. Like the snake, I shall cast\nmy slough, and come forth younger than I was at twenty.\"\n\n\"Meantime, I beseech you to render me some assistance,\" groaned Auriol,\n\"or, while you are preparing for immortality, I shall expire before your\neyes.\"\n\n\"Be not afraid,\" replied Darcy; \"you shall take no harm. I will care for\nyou presently; and I understand leechcraft so well, that I will answer\nfor your speedy and perfect recovery.\"\n\n\"Drink, then, to it!\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"I know not what stays my hand,\" said the old man, raising the phial;\n\"but now that immortality is in my reach, I dare not grasp it.\"\n\n\"Give me the potion, then,\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Not for worlds,\" rejoined Darcy, hugging the phial to his breast. \"No;\nI will be young again--rich--happy. I will go forth into the world--I\nwill bask in the smiles of beauty--I will feast, revel, sing--life shall\nbe one perpetual round of enjoyment. Now for the trial--ha!\" and, as he\nraised the potion towards his lips, a sudden pang shot across his heart.\n\"What is this?\" he cried, staggering. \"Can death assail me when I am\njust about to enter upon perpetual life? Help me, good grandson! Place\nthe phial to my lips. Pour its contents down my throat--quick! quick!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Elixir of Long Life.]\n\n\"I am too weak to stir,\" groaned Auriol. \"You have delayed it too long.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens! we shall both perish,\" shrieked Darcy, vainly endeavouring\nto raise his palsied arm,--\"perish with the blissful shore in view.\"\n\nAnd he sank backwards, and would have fallen to the ground if he had not\ncaught at the terrestrial sphere for support.\n\n\"Help me--help me!\" he screamed, fixing a glance of unutterable anguish\non his relative.\n\n\"It is worth the struggle,\" cried Auriol. And, by a great effort, he\nraised himself, and staggered towards the old man.\n\n\"Saved--saved!\" shrieked Darcy. \"Pour it down my throat. An instant, and\nall will be well.\"\n\n\"Think you I have done this for you?\" cried Auriol, snatching the\npotion; \"no--no.\"\n\nAnd, supporting himself against the furnace, he placed the phial to his\nlips, and eagerly drained its contents.\n\nThe old man seemed paralysed by the action, but kept his eye fixed upon\nthe youth till he had drained the elixir to the last drop. He then\nuttered a piercing cry, threw up his arms, and fell heavily backwards.\n\nDead--dead!\n\nFlashes of light passed before Auriol's eyes, and strange noises smote\nhis ears. For a moment he was bewildered as with wine, and laughed and\nsang discordantly like a madman. Every object reeled and danced around\nhim. The glass vessels and jars clashed their brittle sides together,\nyet remained uninjured; the furnace breathed forth flames and mephitic\nvapours; the spiral worm of the alembic became red hot, and seemed\nfilled with molten lead; the pipe of the bolt-head ran blood; the sphere\nof the earth rolled along the floor, and rebounded from the wall as if\nimpelled by a giant hand; the skeletons grinned and gibbered; so did the\ndeath's-head on the table; so did the skulls against the chimney; the\nmonstrous sea-fish belched forth fire and smoke; the bald, decapitated\nhead opened its eyes, and fixed them, with a stony glare, on the young\nman; while the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him.\n\nUnable to bear these accumulated horrors, Auriol became, for a short\nspace, insensible. On recovering, all was still. The lights within the\nlamp had expired; but the bright moonlight, streaming through the\nwindow, fell upon the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist, and\non the cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him.\n\nEager to test the effect of the elixir, Auriol put his hand to his side.\nAll traces of the wound were gone; nor did he experience the slightest\npain in any other part of his body. On the contrary, he seemed endowed\nwith preternatural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and he\nlonged to expand his joy in active motion.\n\nStriding over the body of his aged relative, he threw open the window.\nAs he did so, joyous peals burst from surrounding churches, announcing\nthe arrival of the new year.\n\nWhile listening to this clamour, Auriol gazed at the populous and\npicturesque city stretched out before him, and bathed in the moonlight.\n\n\"A hundred years hence,\" he thought, \"and scarcely one soul of the\nthousands within those houses will be living, save myself. A hundred\nyears after that, and their children's children will be gone to the\ngrave. But I shall live on--shall live through all changes--all\ncustoms--all time. What revelations I shall then have to make, if I\nshould dare to disclose them!\"\n\nAs he ruminated thus, the skeleton hanging near him was swayed by the\nwind, and its bony fingers came in contact with his cheek. A dread idea\nwas suggested by the occurrence.\n\n\"There is one peril to be avoided,\" he thought; \"ONE PERIL!--what is it?\nPshaw! I will think no more of it. It may never arise. I will be gone.\nThis place fevers me.\"\n\nWith this, he left the laboratory, and hastily descending the stairs, at\nthe foot of which he found Flapdragon, passed out of the house.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FIRST\n\n_EBBA_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE RUINED HOUSE IN THE VAUXHALL ROAD\n\n\nLate one night, in the spring of 1830, two men issued from a low,\nobscurely situated public-house, near Millbank, and shaped their course\napparently in the direction of Vauxhall Bridge. Avoiding the footpath\nnear the river, they moved stealthily along the farther side of the\nroad, where the open ground offered them an easy means of flight, in\ncase such a course should be found expedient. So far as it could be\ndiscerned by the glimpses of the moon, which occasionally shone forth\nfrom a rack of heavy clouds, the appearance of these personages was not\nmuch in their favour. Haggard features, stamped deeply with the\ncharacters of crime and debauchery; fierce, restless eyes; beards of\nseveral days' growth; wild, unkempt heads of hair, formed their chief\npersonal characteristics; while sordid and ragged clothes, shoes without\nsoles, and old hats without crowns, constituted the sum of their\napparel.\n\nOne of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and feet; but despite\nhis meagreness, he evidently possessed great strength: the other was\nconsiderably shorter, but broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and\naltogether a most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek-bones,\na long aquiline nose, and a coarse mouth and chin, in which the animal\ngreatly predominated. He had a stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white\nbrows and eyelashes. The countenance of the other was dark and\nrepulsive, and covered with blotches, the result of habitual\nintemperance. His eyes had a leering and malignant look. A handkerchief\nspotted with blood, and tied across his brow, contrasted strongly with\nhis matted black hair, and increased his natural appearance of ferocity.\nThe shorter ruffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder, and his\ncompanion concealed something beneath the breast of his coat, which\nafterwards proved to be a dark lantern.\n\nNot a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant look-out, they\ntrudged on with quick, shambling steps. A few sounds arose from the\nbanks of the river, and there was now and then a plash in the water, or\na distant cry, betokening some passing craft; but generally all was\nprofoundly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the opposite\nbank, the line of coal-barges and lighters moored to the strand, the\ngreat timber-yards and coal-yards, the brewhouses, gasworks, and\nwaterworks, could only be imperfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell\nclear upon the ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring\nchurch. The same glimmer also ran like a silver belt across the stream,\nand revealed the great, stern, fortress-like pile of the\nPenitentiary--perhaps the most dismal-looking structure in the whole\nmetropolis. The world of habitations beyond this melancholy prison was\nburied in darkness. The two men, however, thought nothing of these\nthings, and saw nothing of them; but, on arriving within a couple of\nhundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by previous concert,\nquitted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran across a field, and plunged\ninto a hollow formed by a dried pit, where they came to a momentary\nhalt.\n\n\"You ain't a-been a-gammonin' me in this matter, Tinker?\" observed the\nshorter individual. \"The cove's sure to come?\"\n\n\"Why, you can't expect me to answer for another as I can for myself,\nSandman,\" replied the other; \"but if his own word's to be taken for it,\nhe's sartin to be there. I heerd him say, as plainly as I'm a speakin'\nto you--'I'll be here to-morrow night--at the same hour----'\"\n\n\"And that wos one o'clock?\" said the Sandman.\n\n\"Thereabouts,\" replied the other.\n\n\"And who did he say that to?\" demanded the Sandman.\n\n\"To hisself, I s'pose,\" answered the Tinker; \"for, as I told you afore,\nI could see no one vith him.\"\n\n\"Do you think he's one of our perfession?\" inquired the Sandman.\n\n\"Bless you! no--that he ain't,\" returned the Tinker. \"He's a reg'lar\nslap-up svell.\"\n\n\"That's no reason at all,\" said the Sandman. \"Many a first-rate svell\npractises in our line. But he can't be in his right mind to come to such\na ken as that, and go on as you mentions.\"\n\n\"As to that I can't say,\" replied the Tinker; \"and it don't much matter,\nas far as ve're consarned.\"\n\n\"Devil a bit,\" rejoined the Sandman, \"except--you're sure it worn't a\nsperrit, Tinker. I've heerd say that this crib is haanted, and though I\ndon't fear no livin' man, a ghost's a different sort of customer.\"\n\n\"Vell, you'll find our svell raal flesh and blood, you may depend upon\nit,\" replied the Tinker. \"So come along, and don't let's be frightenin'\nourselves vith ould vimen's tales.\"\n\nWith this they emerged from the pit, crossed the lower part of the\nfield, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted by a few detached\nhouses, which brought them into the Vauxhall Bridge Road.\n\nHere they kept on the side of the street most in shadow, and crossed\nover whenever they came to a lamp. By-and-by, two watchmen were seen\nadvancing from Belvoir Terrace, and, as the guardians of the night drew\nnear, the ruffians crept into an alley to let them pass. As soon as the\ncoast was clear, they ventured forth, and quickening their pace, came to\na row of deserted and dilapidated houses. This was their destination.\n\nThe range of habitations in question, more than a dozen in number, were,\nin all probability, what is vulgarly called \"in Chancery,\" and shared\nthe fate of most property similarly circumstanced. They were in a sad\nruinous state--unroofed, without windows and floors. The bare walls were\nalone left standing, and these were in a very tumble-down condition.\nThese neglected dwellings served as receptacles for old iron, blocks of\nstone and wood, and other ponderous matters. The aspect of the whole\nplace was so dismal and suspicious, that it was generally avoided by\npassengers after nightfall.\n\nSkulking along the blank and dreary walls, the Tinker, who was now a\nlittle in advance, stopped before a door, and pushing it open, entered\nthe dwelling. His companion followed him.\n\nThe extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects which met the\ngaze of the Sandman, coupled with the deserted appearance of the place,\nproduced an effect upon his hardy but superstitious nature.\n\nLooking round, he beheld huge mill-stones, enormous water-wheels,\nboilers of steam-engines, iron vats, cylinders, cranes, iron pumps of\nthe strangest fashion, a gigantic pair of wooden scales, old iron safes,\nold boilers, old gas-pipes, old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old\nbird-cages, old plates of iron, old pulleys, ropes, and rusty chains,\nhuddled and heaped together in the most fantastic disorder. In the midst\nof the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal head of Neptune,\nwhich had once decorated the forepart of a man-of-war. Above it, on a\nsort of framework, lay the prostrate statue of a nymph, together with a\nbust of Fox, the nose of the latter being partly demolished, and the\neyes knocked in. Above these, three garden divinities laid their heads\namicably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian warrior, minus the\nhead and right hand. The whole was surmounted by an immense ventilator,\nstuck on the end of an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor,\nfrom the steam-engine pump.\n\nSeen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects above\nenumerated produced a strange effect upon the beholder's imagination.\nThere was a mixture of the grotesque and terrible about them. Nor was\nthe building itself devoid of a certain influence upon his mind. The\nragged brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the semblance of a\nhuman face, and seemed to keep a wary eye on what was going forward\nbelow.\n\nA means of crossing from one side of the building to the other, without\ndescending into the vault beneath, was afforded by a couple of planks;\nthough as the wall on the farther side was some feet higher than that\nnear at hand, and the planks were considerably bent, the passage\nappeared hazardous.\n\nGlancing round for a moment, the Tinker leaped into the cellar, and,\nunmasking his lantern, showed a sort of hiding-place, between a bulk of\ntimber and a boiler, to which he invited his companion.\n\nThe Sandman jumped down.\n\n\"The ale I drank at the 'Two Fighting Cocks' has made me feel drowsy,\nTinker,\" he remarked, stretching himself on the bulk; \"I'll just take a\nsnooze. Vake me up if I snore--or ven our sperrit appears.\"\n\nThe Tinker replied in the affirmative; and the other had just become\nlost to consciousness, when he received a nudge in the side, and his\ncompanion whispered--\"He's here!\"\n\n\"Vhere--vhere?\" demanded the Sandman, in some trepidation.\n\n\"Look up, and you'll see him,\" replied the other.\n\nSlightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight of a figure\nstanding upon the planks above them. It was that of a young man. His hat\nwas off, and his features, exposed to the full radiance of the moon,\nlooked deathly pale, and though handsome, had a strange sinister\nexpression. He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general\ncut of his attire, the tightly-buttoned, single-breasted coat, together\nwith the moustache upon his lip, gave him a military air.\n\n\"He seems a-valkin' in his sleep,\" muttered the Sandman. \"He's\na-speakin' to some von unwisible.\"\n\n\"Hush--hush!\" whispered the other. \"Let's hear wot he's a-sayin'.\"\n\n\"Why have you brought me here?\" cried the young man, in a voice so\nhollow that it thrilled his auditors. \"What is to be done?\"\n\n\"It makes my blood run cold to hear him,\" whispered the Sandman. \"Vot\nd'ye think he sees?\"\n\n\"Why do you not speak to me?\" cried the young man--\"why do you beckon me\nforward? Well, I obey. I will follow you.\"\n\nAnd he moved slowly across the plank.\n\n\"See, he's a-goin' through that door,\" cried the Tinker. \"Let's foller\nhim.\"\n\n\"I don't half like it,\" replied the Sandman, his teeth chattering with\napprehension. \"We shall see summat as'll take avay our senses.\"\n\n\"Tut!\" cried the Tinker; \"it's only a sleepy-valker. Wot are you afeerd\non?\"\n\nWith this he vaulted upon the planks, and peeping cautiously out of the\nopen door to which they led, saw the object of his scrutiny enter the\nadjoining house through a broken window.\n\nMaking a sign to the Sandman, who was close at his heels, the Tinker\ncrept forward on all fours, and, on reaching the window, raised himself\njust sufficiently to command the interior of the dwelling. Unfortunately\nfor him, the moon was at this moment obscured, and he could distinguish\nnothing except the dusky outline of the various objects with which the\nplace was filled, and which were nearly of the same kind as those of the\nneighbouring habitation. He listened intently, but not the slightest\nsound reached his ears.\n\nAfter some time spent in this way, he began to fear the young man must\nhave departed, when all at once a piercing scream resounded through the\ndwelling. Some heavy matter was dislodged, with a thundering crash, and\nfootsteps were heard approaching the window.\n\nHastily retreating to their former hiding-place, the Tinker and his\ncompanion had scarcely regained it, when the young man again appeared on\nthe plank. His demeanour had undergone a fearful change. He staggered\nrather than walked, and his countenance was even paler than before.\nHaving crossed the plank, he took his way along the top of the broken\nwall towards the door.\n\n\"Now, then, Sandman!\" cried the Tinker; \"now's your time!\"\n\nThe other nodded, and, grasping his mallet with a deadly and determined\npurpose, sprang noiselessly upon the wall, and overtook his intended\nvictim just before he gained the door.\n\nHearing a sound behind him, the young man turned, and only just became\nconscious of the presence of the Sandman, when the mallet descended upon\nhis head, and he fell crushed and senseless to the ground.\n\n[Illustration: The Ruined house in the Vauxhall Road]\n\n\"The vork's done!\" cried the Sandman to his companion, who instantly\ncame up with the dark lantern; \"let's take him below, and strip him.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" replied the Tinker; \"but first let's see wot he has got in his\npockets.\"\n\n\"Vith all my 'art,\" replied the Sandman, searching the clothes of the\nvictim. \"A reader!--I hope it's well lined. Ve'll examine it below. The\nbody 'ud tell awkvard tales if any von should chance to peep in.\"\n\n\"Shall we strip him here?\" said the Tinker. \"Now the darkey shines on\n'em, you see what famous togs the cull has on.\"\n\n\"Do you vant to have us scragged, fool?\" cried the Sandman, springing\ninto the vault. \"Hoist him down here.\"\n\nWith this, he placed the wounded man's legs over his own shoulders, and,\naided by his comrade, was in the act of heaving down the body, when the\nstreet-door suddenly flew open, and a stout individual, attended by a\ncouple of watchmen, appeared at it.\n\n\"There the villains are!\" shouted the new-comer. \"They have been\nmurderin' a gentleman. Seize 'em--seize 'em!\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, he discharged a pistol, the ball from which whistled\npast the ears of the Tinker.\n\nWithout waiting for another salute of the same kind, which might\npossibly be nearer its mark, the ruffian kicked the lantern into the\nvault, and sprang after the Sandman, who had already disappeared.\n\nAcquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker guided his\ncompanion through a hole into an adjoining vault, whence they scaled a\nwall, got into the next house, and passing through an open window, made\ngood their retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for them\nunder every bulk and piece of iron.\n\n\"Here, watchmen!\" cried the stout individual, who had acted as leader;\n\"never mind the villains just now, but help me to convey this poor young\ngentleman to my house, where proper assistance can be rendered him. He\nstill breathes; but he has received a terrible blow on the head. I hope\nhis skull ain't broken.\"\n\n\"It is to be hoped it ain't, Mr. Thorneycroft,\" replied the foremost\nwatchman; \"but them was two desperate characters as ever I see, and\ncapable of any hatterosity.\"\n\n\"What a frightful scream I heard to be sure!\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft. \"I\nwas certain somethin' dreadful was goin' on. It was fortunate I wasn't\ngone to bed; and still more fortunate you happened to be comin' up at\nthe time. But we mustn't stand chatterin' here. Bring the poor young\ngentleman along.\"\n\nPreceded by Mr. Thorneycroft, the watchmen carried the wounded man\nacross the road towards a small house, the door of which was held open\nby a female servant, with a candle in her hand. The poor woman uttered a\ncry of horror as the body was brought in.\n\n\"Don't be cryin' out in that way, Peggy,\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft, \"but\ngo and get me some brandy. Here, watchmen, lay the poor young gentleman\ndown on the sofa--there, gently, gently. And now, one of you run to\nWheeler Street, and fetch Mr. Howell, the surgeon. Less noise,\nPeggy--less noise, or you'll waken Miss Ebba, and I wouldn't have her\ndisturbed for the world.\"\n\nWith this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the maid, filled a\nwine-glass with the spirit, and poured it down the throat of the wounded\nman. A stifling sound followed, and after struggling violently for\nrespiration for a few seconds, the patient opened his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE DOG-FANCIER\n\n\nThe Rookery! Who that has passed Saint Giles's, on the way to the city,\nor coming from it, but has caught a glimpse, through some narrow\nopening, of its squalid habitations, and wretched and ruffianly\noccupants! Who but must have been struck with amazement, that such a\nhuge receptacle of vice and crime should be allowed to exist in the very\nheart of the metropolis, like an ulcerated spot, capable of tainting the\nwhole system! Of late, the progress of improvement has caused its\nremoval; but whether any less cogent motive would have abated the\nnuisance may be questioned. For years the evil was felt and complained\nof, but no effort was made to remedy it, or to cleanse these worse than\nAugean stables. As the place is now partially, if not altogether, swept\naway, and a wide and airy street passes through the midst of its foul\nrecesses, a slight sketch may be given of its former appearance.\n\nEntering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-bars, a few steps\nfrom the crowded thoroughfare brought you into a frightful region, the\nrefuge, it was easy to perceive, of half the lawless characters\ninfesting the metropolis. The coarsest ribaldry assailed your ears, and\nnoisome odours afflicted your sense of smell. As you advanced, picking\nyour way through kennels flowing with filth, or over putrescent heaps of\nrubbish and oyster-shells, all the repulsive and hideous features of the\nplace were displayed before you. There was something savagely\npicturesque in the aspect of the place, but its features were too\nloathsome to be regarded with any other feeling than disgust. The houses\nlooked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the leprosy of vice, as\ntheir tenants. Horrible habitations they were, in truth. Many of them\nwere without windows, and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin\nsupplied the place of glass; some even wanted doors, and no effort was\nmade to conceal the squalor within. On the contrary, it seemed to be\nintruded on observation. Miserable rooms, almost destitute of furniture;\nfloors and walls caked with dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints;\nshameless and abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and\nstockings, and with scarcely a rag to their backs: these were the chief\nobjects that met the view. Of men, few were visible--the majority being\nout on business, it is to be presumed; but where a solitary straggler\nwas seen, his sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping\nwith the spot. So thickly inhabited were these wretched dwellings, that\nevery chamber, from garret to cellar, swarmed with inmates. As to the\ncellars, they looked like dismal caverns, which a wild beast would shun.\nClothes-lines were hung from house to house, festooned with every kind\nof garment. Out of the main street branched several alleys and passages,\nall displaying the same degree of misery, or, if possible, worse, and\nteeming with occupants. Personal security, however, forbade any attempt\nto track these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen afforded,\ncould easily picture them. It was impossible to move a step without\ninsult or annoyance. Every human being seemed brutalised and degraded;\nand the women appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street ring\nwith their cries, their quarrels, and their imprecations. It was a\npositive relief to escape from this hotbed of crime to the world\nwithout, and breathe a purer atmosphere.\n\nSuch being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime, what must it have\nbeen when crowded with its denizens at night! Yet at such an hour it\nwill now be necessary to enter its penetralia.\n\nAfter escaping from the ruined house in the Vauxhall Road, the two\nruffians shaped their course towards Saint Giles's, running the greater\npart of the way, and reaching the Broadway just as the church clock\nstruck two. Darting into a narrow alley, and heedless of any\nobstructions they encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat\nwider cross-street, which they pursued for a short distance, and then\nstruck into an entry, at the bottom of which was a swing-door that\nadmitted them into a small court, where they found a dwarfish person\nwrapped in a tattered watchman's greatcoat, seated on a stool with a\nhorn lantern in his hand and a cutty in his mouth, the glow of which\nlighted up his hard, withered features. This was the deputy-porter of\nthe lodging-house they were about to enter. Addressing him by the name\nof Old Parr, the ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another\ndoor, entered a sort of kitchen, at the farther end of which blazed a\ncheerful fire, with a large copper kettle boiling upon it. On one side\nof the room was a deal table, round which several men of sinister aspect\nand sordid attire were collected, playing, at cards. A smaller table of\nthe same material stood near the fire, and opposite it was a staircase\nleading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and dirty in the\nextreme, the floors could not have been scoured for years, and the walls\nwere begrimed with filth. In one corner, with his head resting on a heap\nof coals and coke, lay a boy almost as black as a chimney-sweep, fast\nasleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was afforded by a candle\nstuck against the wall, with a tin reflector behind it. Before the fire,\nwith his back turned towards it, stood a noticeable individual, clad in\na velveteen jacket with ivory buttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees,\na faded black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and a pair of ancient\nWellingtons ascending half-way up his legs, which looked\ndisproportionately thin when compared with the upper part of his square,\nrobustious, and somewhat pursy frame. His face was broad, jolly, and\ngood-humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light grey\neyes, glistening with cunning and roguery. His hair, which dangled in\nlong flakes over his ears and neck, was of a dunnish red, as were also\nhis whiskers and beard. A superannuated white castor, with a black\nhat-band round it, was cocked knowingly on one side of his head, and\ngave him a flashy and sporting look. His particular vocation was made\nmanifest by the number of dogs he had about him. A beautiful\nblack-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second's breed, popped its short\nsnubby nose and long silken ears out of each coat-pocket. A pug was\nthrust into his breast, and he carried an exquisite Blenheim under\neither arm. At his feet reposed an Isle of Skye terrier, and a partly\ncropped French poodle, of snowy whiteness, with a red worsted riband\nround his throat. This person, it need scarcely be said, was a\ndog-fancier, or, in other words, a dealer in, and a stealer of, dogs, as\nwell as a practiser of all the tricks connected with that nefarious\ntrade. His self-satisfied air made it evident he thought himself a\nsmart, clever fellow,--and adroit and knavish he was, no doubt,--while\nhis droll, plausible, and rather winning manners helped him materially\nto impose upon his customers. His real name was Taylor, but he was known\namong his companions by the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of\nthe Sandman and the Tinker, he nodded familiarly to them, and with a sly\nlook inquired--\"Vell, my 'arties--wot luck?\"\n\n\"Oh, pretty middlin',\" replied the Sandman gruffly.\n\nAnd seating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked up the lad,\nwho was lying fast asleep on the coals, and bade him fetch a pot of\nhalf-and-half. The Tinker took a place beside him, and they waited in\nsilence the arrival of the liquor, which, when it came, was disposed of\nat a couple of pulls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged,\nsauntered towards the card-table, attended by his four-footed\ncompanions.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Sandman, unable to control his curiosity longer, and\ntaking out his pocket-book, \"we'll see what fortun' has given us.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Dog-fancier.]\n\nSo saying, he unclasped the pocket-book, while the Tinker bent over\nhim in eager curiosity. But their search for money was fruitless. Not a\nsingle bank-note was forthcoming. There were several memoranda and slips\nof paper, a few cards, and an almanac for the year--that was all. It was\na great disappointment.\n\n\"So we've had all this trouble for nuffin', and nearly got shot into the\nbargain,\" cried the Sandman, slapping down the book on the table with an\noath. \"I vish I'd never undertaken the job.\"\n\n\"Don't let's give it up in sich an 'urry,\" replied the Tinker; \"summat\nmay be made on it yet. Let's look over them papers.\"\n\n\"Look 'em over yourself,\" rejoined the Sandman, pushing the book towards\nhim. \"I've done wi' 'em. Here, lazy-bones, bring two glasses o'\nrum-and-water--stiff, d'ye hear?\"\n\nWhile the sleepy youth bestirred himself to obey these injunctions, the\nTinker read over every memorandum in the pocket-book, and then proceeded\ncarefully to examine the different scraps of paper with which it was\nfilled. Not content with one perusal, he looked them all over again, and\nthen began to rub his hands with great glee.\n\n\"Wot's the matter?\" cried the Sandman, who had lighted a cutty, and was\nquietly smoking it. \"Wot's the row, eh?\"\n\n\"Vy, this is it,\" replied the Tinker, unable to contain his\nsatisfaction; \"there's secrets contained in this here pocket-book as'll\nbe worth a hundred pound and better to us. We ha'n't had our trouble for\nnuffin'.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it!\" said the Sandman, looking hard at him. \"Wot kind o'\nsecrets are they?\"\n\n\"Vy, _hangin' secrets_,\" replied the Tinker, with mysterious emphasis.\n\"He seems to be a terrible chap, and to have committed murder\nwholesale.\"\n\n\"Wholesale!\" echoed the Sandman, removing the pipe from his lips. \"That\nsounds awful. But what a precious donkey he must be to register his\ncrimes i' that way.\"\n\n\"He didn't expect the pocket-book to fall into our hands,\" said the\nTinker.\n\n\"Werry likely not,\" replied the Sandman; \"but somebody else might see\nit. I repeat, he must be a fool. S'pose we wos to make a entry of\neverythin' we does. Wot a nice balance there'd be agin us ven our\naccounts comed to be wound up!\"\n\n\"Ourn is a different bus'ness altogether,\" replied the Tinker. \"This\nseems a werry mysterious sort o' person. Wot age should you take him to\nbe?\"\n\n\"Vy, five-an'-twenty at the outside,\" replied the Sandman.\n\n\"Five-an'-sixty 'ud be nearer the mark,\" replied the Tinker. \"There's\ndates as far back as that.\"\n\n\"Five-an'-sixty devils!\" cried the Sandman; \"there must be some mistake\ni' the reckonin' there.\"\n\n\"No, it's all clear an' reg'lar,\" rejoined the other; \"and that doesn't\nseem to be the end of it neither. I looked over the papers twice, and\none, dated 1780, refers to some other dokiments.\"\n\n\"They must relate to his granddad, then,\" said the Sandman; \"it's\nimpossible they can refer to him.\"\n\n\"But I tell 'ee they _do_ refer to him,\" said the Tinker, somewhat\nangrily, at having his assertion denied; \"at least, if his own word's to\nbe taken. Anyhow, these papers is waluable to us. If no one else\nbelieves in 'em, it's clear he believes in 'em hisself, and will be glad\nto buy 'em from us.\"\n\n\"That's a view o' the case worthy of an Old Bailey lawyer,\" replied the\nSandman. \"Wot's the gemman's name?\"\n\n\"The name on the card is AURIOL DARCY,\" replied the Tinker.\n\n\"Any address?\" asked the Sandman.\n\nThe Tinker shook his head.\n\n\"That's unlucky agin,\" said the Sandman. \"Ain't there no sort o' clue?\"\n\n\"None votiver, as I can perceive,\" said the Tinker.\n\n\"Vy, zounds, then, ve're jist vere ve started from,\" cried the Sandman.\n\"But it don't matter. There's not much chance o' makin' a bargin vith\nhim. The crack o' the skull I gave him has done his bus'ness.\"\n\n\"Nuffin' o' the kind,\" replied the Tinker. \"He alvays recovers from\nevery kind of accident.\"\n\n\"Alvays recovers!\" exclaimed the Sandman, in amazement. \"Wot a\nconstitootion he must have!\"\n\n\"Surprisin'!\" replied the Tinker; \"he never suffers from injuries--at\nleast, not much; never grows old; and never expects to die; for he\nmentions wot he intends doin' a hundred years hence.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a lu-nattic!\" exclaimed the Sandman, \"a downright lu-nattic;\nand that accounts for his wisitin' that 'ere ruined house, and\na-fancyin' he heerd some one talk to him. He's mad, depend upon it. That\nis, if I ain't cured him.\"\n\n\"I'm of a different opinion,\" said the Tinker.\n\n\"And so am I,\" said Mr. Ginger, who had approached unobserved, and\noverheard the greater part of their discourse.\n\n\"Vy, vot can you know about it, Ginger?\" said the Sandman, looking up,\nevidently rather annoyed.\n\n\"I only know this,\" replied Ginger, \"that you've got a good case, and if\nyou'll let me into it, I'll engage to make summat of it.\"\n\n\"Vell, I'm agreeable,\" said the Sandman.\n\n\"And so am I,\" added the Tinker.\n\n\"Not that I pays much regard to wot you've bin a readin' in his papers,\"\npurused Ginger; \"the gemman's evidently half-cracked, if he ain't\ncracked altogether--but he's jist the person to work upon. He fancies\nhisself immortal--eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied the Tinker.\n\n\"And he also fancies he's committed a lot o' murders?\" perused Ginger.\n\n\"A desperate lot,\" replied the Tinker.\n\n\"Then he'll be glad to buy those papers at any price,\" said Ginger.\n\"Ve'll deal vith him in regard to the pocket-book, as I deals vith\nregard to a dog--ask a price for its restitootion.\"\n\n\"We must find him out first,\" said the Sandman.\n\n\"There's no difficulty in that,\" rejoined Ginger. \"You must be\nconstantly on the look-out. You're sure to meet him some time or other.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" replied the Sandman; \"and there's no fear of his knowin'\nus, for the werry moment he looked round I knocked him on the head.\"\n\n\"Arter all,\" said the Tinker, \"there's no branch o' the perfession so\nsafe as yours, Ginger. The law is favourable to you, and the beaks is\nafeerd to touch you. I think I shall turn dog-fancier myself.\"\n\n\"It's a good business,\" replied Ginger, \"but it requires a hedication.\nAs I wos sayin', we gets a high price sometimes for restorin' a\nfavourite, especially ven ve've a soft-hearted lady to deal vith.\nThere's some vimen as fond o' dogs as o' their own childer, and ven ve\ngets one o' their precious pets, ve makes 'em ransom it as the brigands\nyou see at the Adelphi or the Surrey sarves their prisoners, threatenin'\nto send first an ear, and then a paw, or a tail, and so on. I'll tell\nyou wot happened t'other day. There wos a lady--a Miss Vite--as was\ndesperate fond of her dog. It wos a ugly warmint, but no matter for\nthat--the creater had gained her heart. Vell, she lost it; and, somehow\nor other, I found it. She vos in great trouble, and a friend o' mine\ncalls to say she can have the dog agin, but she must pay eight pound for\nit. She thinks this dear, and a friend o' her own adwises her to wait,\nsayin' better terms will be offered; so I sends vord by my friend that\nif she don't come down at once the poor animal's throat vill be cut that\nwerry night.\"\n\n\"Ha!--ha!--ha!\" laughed the others.\n\n\"Vell, she sent four pound, and I put up with it,\" pursued Ginger; \"but\nabout a month arterwards she loses her favourite agin, and, strange to\nsay, I finds it. The same game is played over agin, and she comes down\nwith another four pound. But she takes care this time that I shan't\nrepeat the trick; for no sooner does she obtain persession of her\nfavourite than she embarks in the steamer for France, in the hope of\nkeeping her dog safe there.\"\n\n\"Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortinate Miss\nBailey!--Fol-de-riddle-tol-ol-lol--unfortinate Miss Bailey!\" sang the\nTinker.\n\n\"But there's dog-fanciers in France, ain't there?\" asked the Sandman.\n\n\"Lor' bless 'ee, yes,\" replied Ginger; \"there's as many fanciers i'\nFrance as here. Vy, ve drives a smartish trade wi' them through them\nforeign steamers. There's scarcely a steamer as leaves the port o'\nLondon but takes out a cargo o' dogs. Ve sells 'em to the stewards,\nstokers, and sailors--cheap--and no questins asked. They goes to Ostend,\nAntverp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and sometimes to Havre. There's a Mounseer\nCoqquilu as comes over to buy dogs, and ve takes 'em to him at a house\nnear Billinsgit market.\"\n\n\"Then you're alvays sure o' a ready market somehow,\" observed the\nSandman.\n\n\"Sartin,\" replied Ginger, \"cos the law's so kind to us. Vy, bless you, a\nperliceman can't detain us, even if he knows ve've a stolen dog in our\npersession, and ve svears it's our own; and yet he'd stop you in a\nminnit if he seed you with a suspicious-lookin' bundle under your arm.\nNow, jist to show you the difference atwixt the two perfessions:--I\nsteals a dog--walue, maybe, fifty pound, or p'raps more. Even if I'm\ncatched i' the fact I may get fined twenty pound, or have six months'\nimprisonment; vile, if you steals an old fogle, walue three fardens,\nyou'll get seven years abroad, to a dead certainty.\"\n\n\"That seems hard on us,\" observed the Sandman reflectively.\n\n\"It's the _law_!\" exclaimed Ginger triumphantly. \"Now, ve generally\nescapes by payin' the fine, 'cos our pals goes and steals more dogs to\nraise the money. Ve alvays stands by each other. There's a reg'lar\nhorganisation among us; so ve can alvays bring vitnesses to svear vot ve\nlikes, and ve so puzzles the beaks, that the case gets dismissed, and\nthe constable says, 'Vich party shall I give the dog to, your vorship?'\nUpon vich, the beak replies, a-shakin' of his vise noddle, 'Give it to\nthe person in whose persession it was found. I have nuffin' more to do\nvith it.' In course the dog is delivered up to us.\"\n\n\"The law seems made for dog-fanciers,\" remarked the Tinker.\n\n\"Wot d'ye think o' this?\" pursued Ginger. \"I wos a-standin' at the\ncorner o' Gray's Inn Lane vith some o' my pals near a coach-stand, ven a\nlady passes by vith this here dog--an' a beauty it is, a real long-eared\nCharley--a follerin' of her. Vell, the moment I spies it, I unties my\napron, whips up the dog, and covers it up in a trice. Vell, the lady\nsees me, an' gives me in charge to a perliceman. But that si'nifies\nnuffin'. I brings six vitnesses to svear the dog vos mine, and I\nactually had it since it vos a blind little puppy; and, wot's more, I\nbrings its _mother_, and that settles the pint. So in course I'm\ndischarged; the dog is given up to me; and the lady goes avay lamentin'.\nI then plays the amiable, an' offers to sell it her for twenty guineas,\nseein' as how she had taken a fancy to it; but she von't bite. So if I\ndon't sell it next week, I shall send it to Mounseer Coqquilu. The only\nvay you can go wrong is to steal a dog wi' a collar on, for if you do,\nyou may get seven years' transportation for a bit o' leather and a brass\nplate vorth a shillin', vile the animal, though vorth a hundred pound,\ncan't hurt you. There's _law_ again--ha, ha!\"\n\n\"Dog-fancier's law!\" laughed the Sandman.\n\n\"Some of the Fancy is given to cruelty,\" pursued Ginger, \"and crops a\ndog's ears, or pulls out his teeth to disguise him; but I'm too fond o'\nthe animal for that. I may frighten old ladies sometimes, as I told you\nafore, but I never seriously hurts their pets. Nor did I ever kill a dog\nfor his skin, as some on 'em does.\"\n\n\"And you're always sure o' gettin' a dog, if you vants it, I s'pose?\"\ninquired the Tinker.\n\n\"Alvays,\" replied Ginger. \"No man's dog is safe. I don't care how he's\nkept, ve're sure to have him at last. Ve feels our vay with the\nsarvents, and finds out from them the walley the master or missis sets\non the dog, and soon after that the animal's gone. Vith a bit o' liver,\nprepared in my partic'lar vay, I can tame the fiercest dog as ever\nbarked, take him off his chain, an' bring him arter me at a gallop.\"\n\n\"And do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowin' they're stolen?\"\ninquired the Tinker.\n\n\"Ay, to be sure,\" replied Ginger; \"sometimes first-rate nobs. They put\nus up to it themselves; they'll say, 'I've jist left my Lord\nSo-and-So's, and there I seed a couple o' the finest pointers I ever\nclapped eyes on. I vant you to get me _jist sich another couple_.'\nVell, ve understands in a minnit, an' in doo time the identicle dogs\nfinds their vay to our customer.\"\n\n\"Oh! that's how it's done?\" remarked the Sandman.\n\n\"Yes, that's the vay,\" replied Ginger. \"Sometimes a party'll vant a\ncouple o' dogs for the shootin' season; and then ve asks, 'Vich vay are\nyou a-goin'--into Surrey or Kent?' And accordin' as the answer is given\nve arranges our plans.\"\n\n\"Vell, yourn appears a profitable and safe employment, I must say,\"\nremarked the Sandman.\n\n\"Perfectly so,\" replied Ginger. \"Nothin' can touch us till dogs is\ndeclared by statute to be property, and stealin' 'em a misdemeanour. And\nthat won't occur in my time.\"\n\n\"Let's hope not,\" rejoined the other two.\n\n\"To come back to the pint from vich we started,\" said the Tinker; \"our\ngemman's case is not so surprisin' as it at first appears. There are\nsome persons as believe they never will die--and I myself am of the same\nopinion. There's our old deputy here--him as ve calls Old Parr--vy, he\ndeclares he lived in Queen Bess's time, recollects King Charles bein'\nbeheaded perfectly vell, and remembers the Great Fire o' London, as if\nit only occurred yesterday.\"\n\n\"Walker!\" exclaimed Ginger, putting his finger to his nose.\n\n\"You may larf, but it's true,\" replied the Tinker. \"I recollect an old\nman tellin' me that he knew the deputy sixty years ago, and he looked\njist the same then as now,--neither older nor younger.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" exclaimed Ginger. \"He don't look so old now.\"\n\n\"That's the cur'ousest part of it,\" said the Tinker. \"He don't like to\ntalk of his age unless you can get him i' the humour; but he once told\nme he didn't know why he lived so long, unless it were owin' to a potion\nhe'd swallowed, vich his master, who was a great conjurer in Queen\nBess's days, had brew'd.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Ginger. \"I thought you too knowin' a cove, Tinker, to\nbe gulled by such an old vife's story as that.\"\n\n\"Let's have the old fellow in and talk to him,\" replied the Tinker.\n\"Here, lazy-bones,\" he added, rousing the sleeping youth, \"go an' tell\nOld Parr ve vants his company over a glass o' rum-an'-vater.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE HAND AND THE CLOAK\n\n\nA furious barking from Mr. Ginger's dogs, shortly after the departure of\nthe drowsy youth, announced the approach of a grotesque-looking little\npersonage, whose shoulders barely reached to a level with the top of the\ntable. This was Old Parr. The dwarfs head was much too large for his\nbody, as is mostly the case with undersized persons, and was covered\nwith a forest of rusty black hair, protected by a strangely shaped\nseal-skin cap. His hands and feet were equally disproportioned to his\nframe, and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles while\nstanding upright. His spine was crookened, and his head appeared buried\nin his breast. The general character of his face seemed to appertain to\nthe middle period of life; but a closer inspection enabled the beholder\nto detect in it marks of extreme old age. The nose was broad and flat,\nlike that of an ourang-outang; the resemblance to which animal was\nheightened by a very long upper lip, projecting jaws, almost total\nabsence of chin, and a retreating forehead. The little old man's\ncomplexion was dull and swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling.\n\nHis attire was as singular as his person. Having recently served as\ndouble to a famous demon-dwarf at the Surrey Theatre, he had become\npossessed of a cast-off pair of tawny tights, an elastic shirt of the\nsame material and complexion, to the arms of which little green bat-like\nwings were attached, while a blood-red tunic with vandyke points was\ngirded round his waist. In this strange apparel his diminutive limbs\nwere encased, while additional warmth was afforded by the greatcoat\nalready mentioned, the tails of which swept the floor after him like a\ntrain.\n\nHaving silenced his dogs with some difficulty, Mr. Ginger burst into a\nroar of laughter, excited by the little old man's grotesque appearance,\nin which he was joined by the Tinker; but the Sandman never relaxed a\nmuscle of his sullen countenance.\n\nTheir hilarity, however, was suddenly checked by an inquiry from the\ndwarf, in a shrill, odd tone, \"Whether they had sent for him only to\nlaugh at him?\"\n\n\"Sartainly not, deputy,\" replied the Tinker. \"Here, lazy-bones, glasses\no' rum-an'-vater, all round.\"\n\nThe drowsy youth bestirred himself to execute the command. The spirit\nwas brought; water was procured from the boiling copper; and the Tinker\nhanded his guest a smoking rummer, accompanied with a polite request to\nmake himself comfortable.\n\nOpposite the table at which the party were seated, it has been said, was\na staircase--old and crazy, and but imperfectly protected by a broken\nhand-rail. Midway up it stood a door equally dilapidated, but secured by\na chain and lock, of which Old Parr, as deputy-chamberlain, kept the\nkey. Beyond this point the staircase branched off on the right, and a\nrow of stout wooden banisters, ranged like the feet of so many cattle,\nwas visible from beneath. Ultimately, the staircase reached a small\ngallery, if such a name can be applied to a narrow passage communicating\nwith the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of needful\nprecaution, were locked outside; and as the windows were grated, no one\ncould leave his chamber without the knowledge of the landlord or his\nrepresentative. No lights were allowed in the bedrooms, nor in the\npassage adjoining them.\n\nConciliated by the Tinker's offering, Old Parr mounted the staircase,\nand planting himself near the door, took off his greatcoat, and sat down\nupon it. His impish garb being thus more fully displayed, he looked so\nunearthly and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl fearfully, and\nGinger had enough to do to quiet them.\n\nSilence being at length restored, the Tinker, winking slyly at his\ncompanions, opened the conversation.\n\n\"I say, deputy,\" he observed, \"ve've bin havin' a bit o' a dispute vich\nyou can settle for us.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see,\" squeaked the dwarf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Vy, it's relative to your age,\" rejoined the Tinker. \"Ven wos you\nborn?\"\n\n\"It's so long ago, I can't recollect,\" returned Old Parr rather sulkily.\n\n\"You must ha' seen some changes in your time?\" resumed the Tinker,\nwaiting till the little old man had made some progress with his grog.\n\n\"I rayther think I have--a few,\" replied Old Parr, whose tongue the\ngenerous liquid had loosened. \"I've seen this great city of London\npulled down, and built up again--if that's anything. I've seen it grow,\nand grow, till it has reached its present size. You'll scarcely believe\nme, when I tell you, that I recollect this Rookery of ours--this foul\nvagabond neighbourhood--an open country field, with hedges round it, and\ntrees. And a lovely spot it was. Broad Saint Giles's, at the time I\nspeak of, was a little country village, consisting of a few straggling\nhouses standing by the roadside, and there wasn't a single habitation\nbetween it and Convent Garden (for so the present market was once\ncalled); while that garden, which was fenced round with pales, like a\npark, extended from Saint Martin's Lane to Drury House, a great mansion\nsituated on the easterly side of Drury Lane, amid a grove of beautiful\ntimber.\"\n\n\"My eyes!\" cried Ginger, with a prolonged whistle; \"the place must be\npreciously transmogrified indeed!\"\n\n\"If I were to describe the changes that have taken place in London since\nI've known it, I might go on talking for a month,\" pursued Old Parr.\n\"The whole aspect of the place is altered. The Thames itself is unlike\nthe Thames of old. Its waters were once as clear and bright above London\nBridge as they are now at Kew or Richmond; and its banks, from\nWhitefriars to Scotland Yard, were edged with gardens. And then the\nthousand gay wherries and gilded barges that covered its bosom--all are\ngone--all are gone!\"\n\n\"Those must ha' been nice times for the jolly young vatermen vich at\nBlack friars wos used for to ply,\" chanted the Tinker; \"but the steamers\nhas put their noses out o' joint.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Old Parr; \"and I, for one, am sorry for it. Remembering,\nas I do, what the river used to be when enlightened by gay craft and\nmerry company, I can't help wishing its waters less muddy, and those\nugly coal-barges, lighters, and steamers away. London is a mighty city,\nwonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its wealth and power;\nbut in point of beauty it is not to be compared with the city of Queen\nBess's days. You should have seen the Strand then--a line of noblemen's\nhouses--and as to Lombard Street and Gracechurch Street, with their\nwealthy goldsmiths' shops--but I don't like to think of 'em.\"\n\n\"Vell, I'm content vith Lunnun as it is,\" replied the Tinker,\n\"'specially as there ain't much chance o' the ould city bein' rewived.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" replied the dwarf, finishing his glass, which was\nreplenished at a sign from the Tinker.\n\n\"I s'pose, my wenerable, you've seen the king as bequeathed his name to\nthese pretty creaters,\" said Ginger, raising his coat-pockets, so as to\nexhibit the heads of the two little black-and-tan spaniels.\n\n\"What! old Rowley?\" cried the dwarf--\"often. I was page to his favourite\nmistress, the Duchess of Cleveland, and I have seen him a hundred times\nwith a pack of dogs of that description at his heels.\"\n\n\"Old Rowley wos a king arter my own 'art,\" said Ginger, rising and\nlighting a pipe at the fire. \"He loved the femi-_nine_ specious as well\nas the ca-_nine_ specious. Can you tell us anythin' more about him?\"\n\n\"Not now,\" replied Old Parr. \"I've seen so much, and heard so much, that\nmy brain is quite addled. My memory sometimes deserts me altogether,\nand my past life appears like a dream. Imagine what my feelings must be,\nto walk through streets, still called by the old names, but in other\nrespects wholly changed. Oh! if you could but have a glimpse of Old\nLondon, you would not be able to endure the modern city. The very\natmosphere was different from that which we now breathe, charged with\nthe smoke of myriads of sea-coal fires; and the old picturesque houses\nhad a charm about them, which the present habitations, however\ncommodious, altogether want.\"\n\n\"You talk like one o' them smart chaps they calls, and werry properly,\npenny-a-liars,\" observed Ginger. \"But you make me long to ha' lived i'\nthose times.\"\n\n\"If you _had_ lived in them, you would have belonged to Paris Garden, or\nthe bull-baiting and bear-baiting houses in Southwark,\" replied Old\nParr. \"I've seen fellows just like you at each of those places. Strange,\nthough times and fashions change, men continue the same. I often meet a\nface that I can remember in James the First's time. But the old places\nare gone--clean gone!\"\n\n\"Accordin' to your own showin', my wenerable friend, you must ha' lived\nuppards o' two hundred and seventy year,\" said Ginger, assuming a\nconsequential manner. \"Now, doorin' all that time, have you never felt\ninclined to kick the bucket?\"\n\n\"Not the least,\" replied Old Parr. \"My bodily health has been excellent.\nBut, as I have just said, my intellects are a little impaired.\"\n\n\"Not a little, I should think,\" replied Ginger, hemming significantly.\n\"I don't know vether you're a deceivin' of us or yourself, my wenerable;\nbut von thing's quite clear--you _can't_ have lived all that time. It's\nnot in nater.\"\n\n\"Very well, then--I haven't,\" said Old Parr.\n\nAnd he finished his rum-and-water, and set down the glass, which was\ninstantly filled again by the drowsy youth.\n\n\"You've seen some picters o' Old Lunnon, and they've haanted you in your\ndreams, till you've begun to fancy you lived in those times,\" said\nGinger.\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied Old Parr--\"very likely.\"\n\nThere was something, however, in his manner calculated to pique the\ndog-fancier's curiosity.\n\n\"How comes it,\" he said, stretching out his legs, and arranging his\nneckcloth,--\"how comes it, if you've lived so long, that you ain't\nhigher up in the stirrups--better off, as folks say?\"\n\nThe dwarf made no reply, but covering his face with his hands, seemed a\nprey to deep emotion. After a few moments' pause, Ginger repeated the\nquestion.\n\n\"If you won't believe what I tell you, it's useless to give an answer,\"\nsaid Old Parr, somewhat gruffly.\n\n\"Oh yes, _I_ believe you, deputy,\" observed the Tinker, \"and so does the\nSandman.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied the dwarf, \"I'll tell you how it comes to pass.\nFate has been against me. I've had plenty of chances, but I never could\nget on. I've been in a hundred different walks of life, but they always\nled down hill. It's my destiny.\"\n\n\"That's hard,\" rejoined the Tinker--\"werry hard. But how d'ye account\nfor livin' so long?\" he added, winking as he spoke to the others.\n\n\"I've already given you an explanation,\" replied the dwarf.\n\n\"Av, but it's a cur'ous story, and I vants my friends to hear it,\" said\nthe Tinker, in a coaxing tone.\n\n\"Well then, to oblige you, I'll go through it again,\" rejoined the\ndwarf. \"You must know I was for some time servant to Doctor Lamb, an old\nalchemist, who lived during the reign of good Queen Bess, and who used\nto pass all his time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead\nand copper into gold.\"\n\n\"I've known several indiwiduals as has found out that secret,\nwenerable,\" observed Ginger. \"And ve calls 'em smashers, nowadays--not\nhalchemists.\"\n\n\"Doctor Lamb's object was actually to turn base metal into gold,\"\nrejoined Old Parr, in a tone of slight contempt. \"But his chief aim was\nto produce the elixir of long life. Night and day he worked at the\noperation;--night and day I laboured with him, until at last we were\nboth brought to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality.\nOne night--I remember it well,--it was the last night of the sixteenth\ncentury,--a young man, severely wounded, was brought to my master's\ndwelling on London Bridge. I helped to convey him to the laboratory,\nwhere I left him with the doctor, who was busy with his experiments. My\ncuriosity being aroused, I listened at the door, and though I could not\ndistinguish much that passed inside, I heard sufficient to convince me\nthat Doctor Lamb had made the grand discovery, and succeeded in\ndistilling the elixir. Having learnt this, I went down-stairs,\nwondering what would next ensue. Half-an-hour elapsed, and while the\nbells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man whom I had\nassisted to carry up-stairs, and whom I supposed at death's door,\nmarched down as firmly as if nothing had happened, passed by me, and\ndisappeared, before I could shake off my astonishment. I saw at once he\nhad drunk the elixir.\"\n\n\"Ah!--ah!\" exclaimed the Tinker, with a knowing glance at his\ncompanions, who returned it with gestures of equal significance.\n\n\"As soon as he was gone,\" pursued the dwarf, \"I flew to the laboratory,\nand there, extended on the floor, I found the dead body of Doctor Lamb.\nI debated with myself what to do--whether to pursue his murderer, for\nsuch I accounted the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the course\nuseless. I next looked round to see whether the precious elixir was\ngone. On the table stood a phial, from which a strong spirituous odour\nexhaled; but it was empty. I then turned my attention to a receiver,\nconnected by a worm with an alembic on the furnace. On examining it, I\nfound it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent liquid,\nwhich, poured forth into a glass, emitted precisely the same odour as\nthe phial. Persuaded this must be the draught of immortality, I raised\nit to my lips; but apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand.\nReassured, however, by the thought of the young man's miraculous\nrecovery, I quaffed the potion. It was as if I had swallowed fire, and\nat first I thought all was over with me. I shrieked out; but there was\nno one to heed my cries, unless it were my dead master, and two or\nthree skeletons with which the walls were garnished. And these, in\ntruth, did seem to hear me; for the dead corpse opened its glassy orbs,\nand eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons shook their fleshless arms and\ngibbered; and the various strange objects, with which the chamber was\nfilled, seemed to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by these\nfantasies, combined with the potency of the draught, took away my\nsenses. When I recovered, I found all tranquil. Doctor Lamb was lying\nstark and stiff at my feet, with an expression of reproach on his fixed\ncountenance; and the skeletons were hanging quietly in their places.\nConvinced that I was proof against death, I went forth. _But a curse\nwent with me!_ From that day to this I have lived, but it has been in\nsuch poverty and distress, that I had better far have died. Besides, I\nam constantly haunted by visions of my old master. He seems to hold\nconverse with me--to lead me into strange places.\"\n\n\"Exactly the case with the t'other,\" whispered the Tinker to the\nSandman. \"Have you ever, in the coorse o' your long life, met the young\nman as drank the 'lixir?\" he inquired of the dwarf.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Do you happen to rekilect his name?\"\n\n\"No; it has quite escaped my memory,\" answered Old Parr.\n\n\"Should you rekilect it, if you heerd it?\" asked the Tinker.\n\n\"Perhaps I might,\" returned the dwarf; \"but I can't say.\"\n\n\"Wos it Auriol Darcy?\" demanded the other.\n\n\"That _was_ the name,\" cried Old Parr, starting up in extreme surprise.\n\"I heard Doctor Lamb call him so. But how, in the name of wonder, do you\ncome to know it?\"\n\n\"Ve've got summat, at last,\" said the Tinker, with a self-applauding\nglance at his friends.\n\n\"How do you come to know it, I say?\" repeated the dwarf, in extreme\nagitation.\n\n\"Never mind,\" rejoined the Tinker, with a cunning look; \"you see I does\nknow some cur'ous matters as veil as you, my old file. Yo'll be good\nevidence, in case ve vishes to prove the fact agin him.\"\n\n\"Prove what?--and against whom?\" cried the dwarf.\n\n\"One more questin, and I've done,\" pursued the Tinker. \"Should you know\nthis young man agin, in case you chanced to come across him?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" replied Old Parr; \"his figure often flits before me in\ndreams.\"\n\n\"Shall ve let him into it?\" said the Tinker, consulting his companions\nin a low tone.\n\n\"Ay--ay,\" replied the Sandman.\n\n\"Better vait a bit,\" remarked Ginger, shaking his head dubiously.\n\"There's no hurry.\"\n\n\"No; ve must decide at vonce,\" said the Tinker. \"Jist examine them\npapers,\" he added, handing the pocket-book to Old Parr, \"and favour us\nvith your opinion on 'em.\"\n\nThe dwarf was about to unclasp the book committed to his charge, when a\nhand was suddenly thrust through the banisters of the upper part of the\nstaircase, which, as has been already stated, was divided from the\nlower by the door. A piece of heavy black drapery next descended like a\ncloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with which the dwarf\nwas suddenly seized by the nape of the neck, lifted up in the air, and,\nnotwithstanding his shrieks and struggles, carried clean off.\n\nGreat confusion attended his disappearance. The dogs set up a prodigious\nbarking, and flew to the rescue--one of the largest of them passing over\nthe body of the drowsy waiter, who had sought his customary couch upon\nthe coals, and rousing him from his slumbers; while the Tinker, uttering\na fierce imprecation, upset his chair in his haste to catch hold of the\ndwarf's legs; but the latter was already out of reach, and the next\nmoment had vanished entirely.\n\n\"My eyes! here's a pretty go!\" cried Ginger, who, with his back to the\nfire, had witnessed the occurrence in open-mouthed astonishment. \"Vy,\ncurse it! if the wenerable ain't a-taken the pocket-book with him! It's\nmy opinion the devil has flown avay with the old feller. His time wos\nnearer at 'and than he expected.\"\n\n\"Devil or not, I'll have him back agin, or at all events the\npocket-book!\" cried the Tinker. And, dashing up the stairs, he caught\nhold of the railing above, and swinging himself up by a powerful effort,\npassed through an opening, occasioned by the removal of one of the\nbanisters.\n\n[Illustration: The Hand and the Cloak.]\n\nGroping along the gallery, which was buried in profound darkness, he\nshouted to the dwarf, but received no answer to his vociferations;\nneither could he discover any one, though he felt on either side of the\npassage with outstretched hands. The occupants of the different\nchambers, alarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going\nforward; but being locked in their rooms, they could render no\nassistance.\n\nWhile the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the dark, venting his\nrage and disappointment in the most dreadful imprecations, the staircase\ndoor was opened by the landlord, who had found the key in the greatcoat\nleft behind by the dwarf. With the landlord came the Sandman and Ginger,\nthe latter of whom was attended by all his dogs, still barking\nfuriously; while the rear of the party was brought up by the drowsy\nwaiter, now wide awake with fright, and carrying a candle.\n\nBut though every nook and corner of the place was visited--though the\nattics were searched, and all the windows examined--not a trace of the\ndwarf could be discovered, nor any clue to his mysterious disappearance\ndetected. Astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance.\n\n\"What the devil can have become of him?\" cried the landlord, with a look\nof dismay.\n\n\"Ay, that's the questin!\" rejoined the Tinker. \"I begin to be of\nGinger's opinion, that the devil himself must have flown avay vith him.\nNo von else could ha' taken a fancy to him.\"\n\n\"I only saw a hand and a black cloak,\" said the Sandman.\n\n\"I thought I seed a pair o' hoofs,\" cried the waiter; \"and I'm quite\nsure I seed a pair o' great glitterin' eyes,\" he added, opening his own\nlacklustre orbs to their widest extent.\n\n\"It's a strange affair,\" observed the landlord gravely. \"It's certain\nthat no one has entered the house wearing a cloak such as you describe;\nnor could any of the lodgers, to my knowledge, get out of their rooms.\nIt was Old Parr's business, as you know, to lock 'em up carefully for\nthe night.\"\n\n\"Vell, all's over vith him now,\" said the Tinker; \"and vith our affair,\ntoo, I'm afeerd.\"\n\n\"Don't say die jist yet,\" rejoined Ginger. \"The wenerable's gone, to be\nsure; and the only thing he has left behind him, barrin' his topcoat, is\nthis here bit o' paper vich dropped out o' the pocket-book as he wos\na-takin' flight, and vich I picked from the floor. It may be o' some use\nto us. But come, let's go down-stairs. There's no good in stayin' here\nany longer.\"\n\nConcurring in which sentiment, they all descended to the lower room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE IRON-MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER\n\n\nA week had elapsed since Auriol Darcy was conveyed to the\niron-merchant's dwelling, after the attack made upon him by the ruffians\nin the ruined house; and though almost recovered from the serious\ninjuries he had received, he still remained the guest of his preserver.\n\nIt was a bright spring morning, when a door leading to the yard in front\nof the house opened, and a young girl, bright and fresh as the morning's\nself, issued from it.\n\nA lovelier creature than Ebba Thorneycroft cannot be imagined. Her\nfigure was perfection--slight, tall, and ravishingly proportioned, with\na slender waist, little limbs, and fairy feet that would have made the\nfortune of an opera-dancer. Her features were almost angelic in\nexpression, with an outline of the utmost delicacy and precision--not\ncold, classical regularity--but that softer and incomparably more lovely\nmould peculiar to our own clime. Ebba's countenance was a type of Saxon\nbeauty. Her complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight bloom. Her\neyes were of a serene summer blue, arched over by brows some shades\ndarker than the radiant tresses that fell on either cheek, and were\nparted over a brow smoother than alabaster. Her attire was simple but\ntasteful, and by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding\nfairness of her skin.\n\nEbba's first care was to feed her favourite linnet, placed in a cage\nover the door. Having next patted the head of a huge bulldog who came\nout of his kennel to greet her, and exchanged a few words with two men\nemployed at a forge in the inner part of the building on the right, she\nadvanced farther into the yard.\n\nThis part of the premises, being strewn with ironwork of every possible\nshape, presented a very singular appearance, and may merit some\ndescription. There were heaps of rusty iron chains flung together like\nfishermen's nets, old iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fenders, old\ngrates, safes, piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron\npans and dishes, a ditto of old ovens, kettles without number,\nsledge-hammers, anvils, braziers, chimney-cowls, and smoke-jacks.\n\nStout upright posts, supporting cross-beams on the top, were placed at\nintervals on either side of the yard, and these were decorated, in the\nmost artistic style, with rat-traps, man-traps, iron lanterns, pulleys,\npadlocks, chains, trivets, triangles, iron rods, disused street lamps,\ndismounted cannon, and anchors. Attached to hooks in the cross-beam\nnearest the house hung a row of old horse-shoes, while from the centre\ndepended a large rusty bell. Near the dog's kennel was a tool-box,\nlikewise garnished with horse-shoes, and containing pincers, files,\nhammers, and other implements proper to the smith. Beyond this was an\nopen doorway leading to the workshop, where the two men before mentioned\nwere busy at the forge.\n\nThough it was still early, the road was astir with passengers; and many\nwaggons and carts, laden with hay, straw, and vegetables, were passing.\nEbba, however, had been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning,\nand she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe the balmy\nair. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt the warm sunshine upon\nher cheek, her thoughts wandered away into the green meadows in which\nshe had strayed as a child, and she longed to ramble amid them again.\nPerhaps she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however this might\nbe, she was too much engrossed by the reverie to notice a tall man,\nwrapped in a long black cloak, who regarded her with the most fixed\nattention, as he passed on the opposite side of the road.\n\nProceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed over, and\nreturned slowly towards the iron-merchant's dwelling. Ebba then, for the\nfirst time, remarked him, and was startled by his strange, sinister\nappearance. His features were handsome, but so malignant and fierce in\nexpression, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin curled his\nthin lips, and his short, crisply curled hair, raven-black in hue,\ncontrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his cadaverous complexion. An\nattraction like that of the snake seemed to reside in his dark blazing\neyes, for Ebba trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and could\nnot remove her gaze from them. A vague presentiment of coming ill smote\nher, and she dreaded lest the mysterious being before her might be\nconnected in some inexplicable way with her future destiny.\n\nOn his part, the stranger was not insensible to the impression he had\nproduced, and suddenly halting, he kept his eyes riveted on those of\nthe girl, who, after remaining spell-bound, as it were, for a few\nmoments, precipitately retreated towards the house.\n\nJust as she reached the door, and was about to pass through it, Auriol\ncame forth. He was pale, as if from recent suffering, and bore his left\narm in a sling.\n\n\"You look agitated,\" he said, noticing Ebba's uneasiness. \"What has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" she replied, a deep blush mantling her cheeks. \"But I have\nbeen somewhat alarmed by the person near the gate.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried Auriol, darting forward. \"Where is he? I see no one.\"\n\n\"Not a tall man, wrapped in a long black cloak?\" rejoined Ebba,\nfollowing him cautiously.\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Auriol. \"Has he been here?\"\n\n\"Then you know the person I allude to?\" she rejoined.\n\n\"I know some one answering his description,\" he replied, with a forced\nsmile.\n\n\"Once beheld, the man I mean is not to be forgotten,\" said Ebba. \"He has\na countenance such as I never saw before. If I could believe in the\n'evil eye,' I should be sure he possessed it.\"\n\n\"'Tis he, there can be no doubt,\" rejoined Auriol, in a sombre tone.\n\n\"Who and what is he, then?\" demanded Ebba.\n\n\"He is a messenger of ill,\" replied Auriol, \"and I am thankful he is\ngone.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Iron-merchant's Daughter.]\n\n\"Are you quite sure of it?\" she asked, glancing timorously up and down\nthe road. But the mysterious individual could no longer be seen.\n\n\"And so, after exciting my curiosity in this manner, you will not\nsatisfy it?\" she said.\n\n\"I cannot,\" rejoined Auriol, somewhat sternly.\n\n\"Nay, then, since you are so ungracious, I shall go and prepare\nbreakfast,\" she replied. \"My father must be down by this time.\"\n\n\"Stay!\" cried Auriol, arresting her, as she was about to pass through\nthe door. \"I wish to have a word with you.\"\n\nEbba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook her cheeks.\n\nBut Auriol seemed unable to proceed. Neither dared to regard the other;\nand a profound silence prevailed between them for a few moments.\n\n\"Ebba,\" said Auriol at length, \"I am about to leave your father's house\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Why so soon?\" she exclaimed, looking up into his face. \"You are not\nentirely recovered yet.\"\n\n\"I dare not stay longer,\" he said.\n\n\"Dare not!\" cried Ebba. And she again cast down her eyes; but Auriol\nmade no reply.\n\nFortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the smiths'\nhammers upon the anvil.\n\n\"If you must really go,\" said Ebba, looking up, after a long pause, \"I\nhope we shall see you again?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" replied Auriol. \"I owe your worthy father a deep debt\nof gratitude--a debt which, I fear, I shall never be able to repay.\"\n\n\"My father is more than repaid in saving your life,\" she replied. \"I am\nsure he will be sorry to learn you are going so soon.\"\n\n\"I have been here a week,\" said Auriol. \"If I remained longer, I might\nnot be able to go at all.\"\n\nThere was another pause, during which a stout old fellow in the workshop\nquitted the anvil for a moment, and, catching a glimpse of the young\ncouple, muttered to his helpmate--\n\n\"I say, Ned, I'm a-thinkin' our master'll soon have a son-in-law.\nThere's pretty plain signs on it at yonder door.\"\n\n\"So there be, John,\" replied Ned, peeping round. \"He's a good-lookin'\nyoung feller that. I wish ve could hear their discoorse.\"\n\n\"No, that ain't fair,\" replied John, raking some small coal upon the\nfire, and working away at the bellows.\n\n\"I would not for the world ask a disagreeable question,\" said Ebba,\nagain raising her eyes, \"but since you are about to quit us, I must\nconfess I should like to know something of your history.\"\n\n\"Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire,\" replied Auriol.\n\"You would not believe me, were I to relate my history. But this I may\nsay, that it is stranger and wilder than any you ever heard. The\nprisoner in his cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than\nthose which bind me to silence.\"\n\nEbba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were wandering.\n\n\"You think me mad,\" said Auriol; \"would I were so! But I shall never\nlose the clear perception of my woes. Hear me, Ebba! Fate has brought me\ninto this house. I have seen you, and experienced your gentle ministry;\nand it is impossible, so circumstanced, to be blind to your\nattractions. I have only been too sensible to them--but I will not dwell\non that theme, nor run the risk of exciting a passion which must destroy\nyou. I will ask you to hate me--to regard me as a monster whom you ought\nto shun rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the\nslightest sympathy.\"\n\n\"You have some motive in saying this to me,\" cried the terrified girl.\n\n\"My motive is to warn you,\" said Auriol. \"If you love me, you are\nlost--utterly lost!\"\n\nShe was so startled, that she could make no reply, but burst into tears.\nAuriol took her hand, which she unresistingly yielded.\n\n\"A terrible fatality attaches to me, in which you must have no share,\"\nhe said, in a solemn tone.\n\n\"Would you had never come to my father's house!\" she exclaimed, in a\nvoice of anguish.\n\n\"Is it, then, too late?\" cried Auriol despairingly.\n\n\"It is--if to love you be fatal,\" she rejoined.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Auriol, striking his forehead with his clenched hand.\n\"Recall your words--Ebba--recall them--but no, once uttered--it is\nimpossible. You are bound to me for ever. I must fulfil my destiny.\"\n\nAt this juncture a low growl broke from the dog, and, guided by the\nsound, the youthful couple beheld, standing near the gate, the tall dark\nman in the black cloak. A fiendish smile sat upon his countenance.\n\n\"That is the man who frightened me!\" cried Ebba.\n\n\"It is the person I supposed!\" ejaculated Auriol. \"I must speak to him.\nLeave me, Ebba. I will join you presently.\"\n\nAnd as the girl, half sinking with apprehension, withdrew, he advanced\nquickly towards the intruder.\n\n\"I have sought you for some days,\" said the tall man, in a stern,\ncommanding voice. \"You have not kept your appointment with me.\"\n\n\"I could not,\" replied Auriol--\"an accident has befallen me.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" rejoined the other. \"I am aware you were assailed by\nruffians in the ruined house over the way. But you are recovered now,\nand can go forth. You ought to have communicated with me.\"\n\n\"It was my intention to do so,\" said Auriol.\n\n\"Our meeting cannot be delayed much longer,\" pursued the stranger. \"I\nwill give you three more days. On the evening of the last day, at the\nhour of seven, I shall look for you at the foot of the statue in Hyde\nPark.\"\n\n\"I will be there,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"That girl must be the next victim,\" said the stranger, with a grim\nsmile.\n\n\"Peace!\" thundered Auriol.\n\n\"Nay, I need not remind you of the tenure by which you maintain your\npower,\" rejoined the stranger. \"But I will not trouble you further now.\"\n\nAnd, wrapping his cloak more closely round him, he disappeared.\n\n\"Fate has once more involved me in its net,\" cried Auriol bitterly. \"But\nI will save Ebba, whatever it may cost me. I will see her no more.\"\n\nAnd instead of returning to the house, he hurried away in the opposite\ndirection of the stranger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE\n\n\nThe evening of the third day arrived, and Auriol entered Hyde Park by\nStanhope Gate. Glancing at his watch, and finding it wanted nearly\nthree-quarters of an hour of the time appointed for his meeting with the\nmysterious stranger, he struck across the park, in the direction of the\nSerpentine River. Apparently he was now perfectly recovered, for his arm\nwas without the support of the sling, and he walked with great\nswiftness. But his countenance was deathly pale, and his looks were so\nwild and disordered, that the few persons he encountered shrank from him\naghast.\n\nA few minutes' rapid walking brought him to the eastern extremity of the\nSerpentine, and advancing close to the edge of the embankment, he gazed\nat the waters beneath his feet.\n\n\"I would plunge into them, if I could find repose,\" he murmured. \"But it\nwould avail nothing. I should only add to my sufferings. No; I must\ncontinue to endure the weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse,\ntill I can find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I dreaded\nthis unknown danger, but now I seek for it in vain.\"\n\nThe current of his thoughts was here interrupted by the sudden\nappearance of a dark object on the surface of the water, which he at\nfirst took to be a huge fish, with a pair of green fins springing from\nits back; but after watching it more closely for a few moments, he\nbecame convinced that it was a human being, tricked out in some\nmasquerade attire, while the slight struggles which it made proved that\nlife was not entirely extinct.\n\nThough, the moment before, he had contemplated self-destruction, and had\nonly been restrained from the attempt by the certainty of failing in his\npurpose, instinct prompted him to rescue the perishing creature before\nhim. Without hesitation, therefore, and without tarrying to divest\nhimself of his clothes, he dashed into the water, and striking out,\ninstantly reached the object of his quest, which still continued to\nfloat, and turning it over, for the face was downwards, he perceived it\nwas an old man, of exceedingly small size, habited in a pantomimic garb.\nHe also remarked that a rope was twisted round the neck of the\nunfortunate being, making it evident that some violent attempt had been\nmade upon his life.\n\nWithout pausing for further investigation, he took firm hold of the\nleathern wings of the dwarf, and with his disengaged hand propelled\nhimself towards the shore, dragging the other after him. The next\ninstant he reached the bank, clambered up the low brickwork, and placed\nhis burden in safety.\n\nThe noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and several persons now\nhurried to the spot. On coming up, and finding Auriol bending over a\nwater-sprite--for such, at first sight, the dwarf appeared--they could\nnot repress their astonishment. Wholly insensible to the presence of\nthose around him, Auriol endeavoured to recall where he had seen the\ndwarf before. All at once, the recollection flashed upon him, and he\ncried aloud, \"Why, it is my poor murdered grandfather's attendant,\nFlapdragon! But no! no!--he must be dead ages ago! Yet the resemblance\nis singularly striking!\"\n\nAuriol's exclamations, coupled with his wild demeanour, surprised the\nbystanders, and they came to the conclusion that he must be a travelling\nshowman, who had attempted to drown his dwarf--the grotesque, impish\ngarb of the latter convincing them that he had been exhibited at a\nbooth. They made signs, therefore, to each other not to let Auriol\nescape, and one of them, raising the dwarf's head on his knee, produced\na flask, and poured some brandy from it down his throat, while others\nchafed his hands. These efforts were attended with much speedier success\nthan might have been anticipated. After a struggle or two for\nrespiration, the dwarf opened his eyes, and gazed at the group around\nhim.\n\n\"It must be Flapdragon!\" exclaimed Auriol.\n\n\"Ah! who calls me?\" cried the dwarf.\n\n\"I!\" rejoined Auriol. \"Do you not recollect me?\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" exclaimed the dwarf, gazing at him fixedly; \"you are----\"\nand he stopped.\n\n\"You have been thrown into the water, Master Flapdragon?\" cried a\nbystander, noticing the cord round the dwarf's throat.\n\n\"I have,\" replied the little old man.\n\n\"By your governor--that is, by this person?\" cried another, laying hold\nof Auriol.\n\n\"By him--no,\" said the dwarf; \"I have not seen that gentleman for nearly\nthree centuries.\"\n\n\"Three centuries, my little patriarch?\" said the man who had given him\nthe brandy. \"That's a long time. Think again.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly true, nevertheless,\" replied the dwarf.\n\n\"His wits have been washed away by the water,\" said the first speaker.\n\"Give him a drop more brandy.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" rejoined the dwarf; \"my senses were never clearer\nthan at this moment. At last we have met,\" he continued, addressing\nAuriol, \"and I hope we shall not speedily part again. We hold life by\nthe same tie.\"\n\n\"How came you in the desperate condition in which I found you?\" demanded\nAuriol evasively.\n\n\"I was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck, like a dog about\nto be drowned,\" replied the dwarf. \"But, as you are aware, I'm not so\neasily disposed of.\"\n\nAgain the bystanders exchanged significant looks.\n\n\"By whom was the attempt made?\" inquired Auriol.\n\n\"I don't know the villain's name,\" rejoined the dwarf, \"but he's a very\ntall, dark man, and is generally wrapped in a long black cloak.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Auriol. \"When was it done?\"\n\n\"Some nights ago, I should fancy,\" replied the dwarf, \"for I've been a\nterrible long time under water. I have only just managed to shake off\nthe stone.\"\n\nAt this speech there was a titter of incredulity among the bystanders.\n\n\"You may laugh, but it's true!\" cried the dwarf angrily.\n\n\"We must speak of this anon,\" said Auriol. \"Will you convey him to the\nnearest tavern?\" he added, placing money in the hands of the man who\nheld the dwarf in his arms.\n\n\"Willingly, sir,\" replied the man. \"I'll take him to the Life Guardsman,\nnear the barracks--that's the nearest public.\"\n\n\"I'll join him there in an hour,\" replied Auriol, moving away.\n\nAnd as he disappeared, the man took up his little burden, and bent his\nsteps towards the barracks.\n\nUtterly disregarding the dripping state of his habiliments, Auriol\nproceeded quickly to the place of rendezvous. Arrived there, he looked\naround, and not seeing any one, flung himself upon a bench at the foot\nof the gentle eminence on which the gigantic statue of Achilles is\nplaced.\n\nIt was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clouds, portending speedy rain,\nincreased the gloom. Auriol's thoughts were sombre as the weather and\nthe hour, and he fell into a deep fit of abstraction, from which he was\nroused by a hand laid on his shoulder.\n\nRecoiling at the touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the stranger\nleaning over him, and gazing at him with a look of diabolical\nexultation. The cloak was thrown partly aside, so as to display the\ntall, gaunt figure of its wearer; while the large collar of sable fur\nwith which it was decorated stood out like the wings of a demon. The\nstranger's hat was off, and his high broad forehead, white as marble,\nwas fully revealed.\n\n\"Our meeting must be brief,\" he said. \"Are you prepared to fulfil the\ncompact?\"\n\n\"What do you require?\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"Possession of the girl I saw three days ago,\" said the other; \"the\niron-merchant's daughter, Ebba. She must be mine.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Auriol firmly--\"never!\"\n\n\"Beware how you tempt me to exert my power,\" said the stranger; \"she\n_must_ be mine--or----\"\n\n\"I defy you!\" rejoined Auriol; \"I will never consent.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" cried the other, seizing him by the arm, and fixing a withering\nglance upon him. \"Bring her to me ere the week be out, or dread my\nvengeance!\"\n\nAnd, enveloping himself in his cloak, he retreated behind the statue,\nand was lost to view.\n\nAs he disappeared, a moaning wind arose, and heavy rain descended. Still\nAuriol did not quit the bench.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CHARLES THE SECOND SPANIEL\n\n\nIt was about two o'clock, on a charming spring day, that a stout\nmiddle-aged man, accompanied by a young person of extraordinary beauty,\ntook up his station in front of Langham Church. Just as the clock struck\nthe hour, a young man issued at a quick pace from a cross-street, and\ncame upon the couple before he was aware of it. He was evidently greatly\nembarrassed, and would have beaten a retreat, but that was impossible.\nHis embarrassment was in some degree shared by the young lady; she\nblushed deeply, but could not conceal her satisfaction at the encounter.\nThe elder individual, who did not appear to notice the confusion of\neither party, immediately extended his hand to the young man, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"What! Mr. Darcy, is it you? Why, we thought we had lost you, sir! What\ntook you off so suddenly? We have been expecting you these four days,\nand were now walking about to try and find you. My daughter has been\nterribly uneasy. Haven't you, Ebba?\"\n\nThe young lady made no answer to this appeal, but cast down her eyes.\n\n\"It was my intention to call, and give you an explanation of my strange\nconduct, to-day,\" replied Auriol. \"I hope you received my letter,\nstating that my sudden departure was unavoidable.\"\n\n\"To be sure; and I also received the valuable snuffbox you were so good\nas to send me,\" replied Mr. Thorneycroft. \"But you neglected to tell me\nhow to acknowledge the gift.\"\n\n\"I could not give an address at the moment,\" said Auriol.\n\n\"Well, I am glad to find you have got the use of your arm again,\"\nobserved the iron-merchant; \"but I can't say you look so well as when\nyou left us. You seem paler--eh? what do you think, Ebba?\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy looks as if he were suffering from mental anxiety rather than\nfrom bodily ailment,\" she replied timidly.\n\n\"I am so,\" replied Auriol, regarding her fixedly. \"A very disastrous\ncircumstance has happened to me. But answer me one question: Has the\nmysterious person in the black cloak troubled you again?\"\n\n\"What mysterious person?\" demanded Mr. Thorneycroft, opening his eyes.\n\n\"Never mind, father,\" replied Ebba. \"I saw him last night,\" she added to\nAuriol. \"I was sitting in the back room alone, wondering what had become\nof you, when I heard a tap against the window, which was partly open,\nand, looking up, I beheld the tall stranger. It was nearly dark, but the\nlight of the fire revealed his malignant countenance. I don't\nexaggerate, when I say his eyes gleamed like those of a tiger. I was\nterribly frightened, but something prevented me from crying out. After\ngazing at me for a few moments, with a look that seemed to fascinate\nwhile it frightened me, he said--'You desire to see Auriol Darcy. I have\njust quitted him. Go to Langham Place to-morrow, and, as the clock\nstrikes two, you will behold him.' Without waiting for any reply on my\npart, he disappeared.\"\n\n\"Ah, you never told me this, you little rogue!\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft.\n\"You persuaded me to come out with you, in the hope of meeting Mr.\nDarcy; but you did not say you were sure to find him. So you sent this\nmysterious gentleman to her, eh?\" he added to Auriol.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" replied the other gloomily.\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the iron-merchant, with a puzzled look.\n\n\"Oh, then I suppose he thought it might relieve her anxiety. However,\nsince we have met, I hope you'll walk home and dine with us.\"\n\nAuriol was about to decline the invitation, but Ebba glanced at him\nentreatingly.\n\n\"I have an engagement, but I will forego it,\" he said, offering his arm\nto her.\n\nAnd they walked along towards Oxford Street, while Mr. Thorneycroft\nfollowed, a few paces behind them.\n\n\"This is very kind of you, Mr. Darcy,\" said Ebba. \"Oh, I have been so\nwretched!\"\n\n\"I grieve to hear it,\" he rejoined. \"I hoped you had forgotten me.\"\n\n\"I am sure you did not think so,\" she cried.\n\nAs she spoke, she felt a shudder pass through Auriol's frame.\n\n\"What ails you?\" she anxiously inquired.\n\n\"I would have shunned you, if I could, Ebba,\" he replied; \"but a fate,\nagainst which it is vain to contend, has brought us together again.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it,\" she replied; \"because, ever since our last interview,\nI have been reflecting on what you then said to me, and am persuaded you\nare labouring under some strange delusion, occasioned by your recent\naccident.\"\n\n\"Be not deceived, Ebba,\" cried Auriol. \"I am under a terrible influence.\nI need not remind you of the mysterious individual who tapped at your\nwindow last night.\"\n\n\"What of him?\" demanded Ebba, with a thrill of apprehension.\n\n\"He it is who controls my destiny,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"But what has he to do with me?\" asked Ebba.\n\n\"Much, much,\" he replied, with a perceptible shudder.\n\n\"You terrify me, Auriol,\" she rejoined. \"Tell me what you mean--in pity,\ntell me?\"\n\nBefore Auriol could reply, Mr. Thorneycroft stepped forward, and turned\nthe conversation into another channel.\n\nSoon after this, they reached the Quadrant, and were passing beneath the\neastern colonnade, when Ebba's attention was attracted towards a man who\nwas leading a couple of dogs by a string, while he had others under his\narm, others again in his pocket, and another in his breast. It was Mr.\nGinger.\n\n\"What a pretty little dog!\" cried Ebba, remarking the Charles the Second\nspaniel.\n\n\"Allow me to present you with it?\" said Auriol.\n\n\"You know I should value it, as coming from you,\" she replied, blushing\ndeeply; \"but I cannot accept it; so I will not look at it again, for\nfear I should be tempted.\"\n\nThe dog-fancier, however, noticing Ebba's admiration, held forward the\nspaniel, and said, \"Do jist look at the pretty little creater, miss. It\nhan't its equil for beauty. Don't be afeerd on it, miss. It's as gentle\nas a lamb.\"\n\n\"Oh you little darling!\" Ebba said, patting its sleek head and long\nsilken ears, while it fixed its large black eyes upon her, as if\nentreating her to become its purchaser.\n\n\"Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you, miss,\" observed Ginger;\n\"and she ain't i' the habit o' fallin' i' love at first sight. I don't\nwonder at it, though, for my part. I should do jist the same, if I wos\nin her place. Vell, now, miss, as she seems to like you, and you seem to\nlike her, I won't copy the manners o' them 'ere fathers as has stony\n'arts, and part two true lovyers. You shall have her a bargin.\"\n\n\"What do you call a bargain, my good man?\" inquired Ebba, smiling.\n\n\"I wish I could afford to give her to you, miss,\" replied Ginger; \"you\nshould have her, and welcome. But I must airn a livelihood, and Fairy is\nthe most wallerable part o' my stock. I'll tell you wot I give for her\nmyself, and you shall have her at a trifle beyond it. I'd scorn to take\nadwantage o' the likes o' you.\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't give too much, then, friend,\" replied Ebba.\n\n\"I didn't give hayf her wally--not hayf,\" said Ginger; \"and if so be you\ndon't like her in a month's time, I'll buy her back again from you.\nYou'll alvays find me here--alvays. Everybody knows Mr. Ginger--that's\nmy name, miss. I'm the only honest man in the dog-fancyin' line. Ask Mr.\nBishop, the great gunmaker o' Bond Street, about me--him as the nobs\ncalls the Bishop o' Bond Street--an' he'll tell you.\"\n\n\"But you haven't answered the lady's question,\" said Auriol. \"What do\nyou ask for the dog?\"\n\n\"Do you want it for yourself, sir, or for her?\" inquired Ginger.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" cried Auriol angrily.\n\n\"A great deal, sir,\" replied Ginger; \"it'll make a mater'al difference\nin the price. To you she'll be five-an'-twenty guineas. To the young\nlady, twenty.\"\n\n\"But suppose I buy her for the young lady?\" said Auriol.\n\n\"Oh, then, in coorse, you'll get her at the lower figure!\" replied\nGinger.\n\n\"I hope you don't mean to buy the dog?\" interposed Mr. Thorneycroft.\n\"The price is monstrous--preposterous.\"\n\n\"It may appear so to you, sir,\" said Ginger, \"because you're ignorant o'\nthe wally of sich a hanimal; but I can tell you, it's cheap--dirt cheap.\nVy, his Excellency the Prooshan Ambassador bought a Charley from me,\nt'other week, to present to a certain duchess of his acquaintance, and\nwot d'ye think he give for it?\"\n\n\"I don't know, and I don't want to know,\" replied Mr. Thorneycroft\ngruffly.\n\n\"Eighty guineas,\" said Ginger. \"Eighty guineas, as I'm a livin' man, and\nmade no bones about it neither. The dog I sold him warn't to be compared\nwi' Fairy.\"\n\n\"Stuff--stuff!\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft; \"I ain't to be gammoned in that\nway.\"\n\n\"It's no gammon,\" said Ginger. \"Look at them ears, miss--vy, they're as\nlong as your own ringlets--and them pads--an' I'm sure you von't say\nshe's dear at twenty pound.\"\n\n\"She's a lovely little creature, indeed,\" returned Ebba, again patting\nthe animal's head.\n\nWhile this was passing, two men of very suspicious mien, ensconced\nbehind a pillar adjoining the group, were reconnoitring Auriol.\n\n\"It's him!\" whispered the taller and darker of the two to his\ncompanion--\"it's the young man ve've been lookin' for--Auriol Darcy.\"\n\n\"It seems like him,\" said the other, edging round the pillar as far as\nhe could without exposure. \"I vish he'd turn his face a leetle more this\nvay.\"\n\n\"It's him, I tell you, Sandman,\" said the Tinker. \"Ve must give the\nsignal to our comrade.\"\n\n\"Vell, I'll tell you wot it is, miss,\" said Ginger coaxingly, \"your\nsveet'art--I'm sure he's your sveet'art--I can tell these things in a\nminnit--your sveet'art, I say, shall give me fifteen pound, and the\ndog's yourn. I shall lose five pound by the transaction; but I don't\nmind it for sich a customer as you. Fairy desarves a kind missus.\"\n\nAuriol, who had fallen into a fit of abstraction, here remarked:\n\n\"What's that you are saying, fellow?\"\n\n\"I vos a-sayin', sir, the young lady shall have the dog for fifteen\npound, and a precious bargin it is,\" replied Ginger.\n\n\"Well, then, I close with you. Here's the money,\" said Auriol, taking\nout his purse.\n\n\"On no account, Auriol,\" cried Ebba quickly. \"It's too much.\"\n\n\"A great deal too much, Mr. Darcy,\" said Thorneycroft.\n\n\"Auriol and Darcy!\" muttered Ginger. \"Can this be the gemman ve're\na-lookin' for. Vere's my two pals, I vonder? Oh, it's all right!\" he\nadded, receiving a signal from behind the pillar. \"They're on the\nlook-out, I see.\"\n\n\"Give the lady the dog, and take the money, man,\" said Auriol sharply.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said Ginger, \"but hadn't I better carry the dog home\nfor the young lady? It might meet vith some accident in the vay.\"\n\n\"Accident!--stuff and nonsense!\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft. \"The rascal\nonly wants to follow you home, that he may know where you live, and\nsteal the dog back again. Take my advice, Mr. Darcy, and don't buy it.\"\n\n\"The bargain's concluded,\" said Ginger, delivering the dog to Ebba, and\ntaking the money from Auriol, which, having counted, he thrust into his\ncapacious breeches pocket.\n\n\"How shall I thank you for this treasure, Auriol?\" exclaimed Ebba, in an\necstasy of delight.\n\n\"By transferring to it all regard you may entertain for me,\" he replied,\nin a low tone.\n\n\"That is impossible,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, I vote we drive away at once,\" said Mr. Thorneycroft. \"Halloa!\njarvey!\" he cried, hailing a coach that was passing; adding, as the\nvehicle stopped, \"Now get in, Ebba. By this means we shall avoid being\nfollowed by the rascal.\"\n\nSo saying, he got into the coach. As Auriol was about to follow him, he\nfelt a slight touch on his arm, and, turning, beheld a tall and very\nforbidding man by his side.\n\n\"Beg pardin, sir,\" said the fellow, touching his hat, \"but ain't your\nname Mr. Auriol Darcy?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Auriol, regarding him fixedly. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I vants a vord or two vith you in private--that's all, sir,\" replied\nthe Tinker.\n\n\"Say what you have to say at once,\" rejoined Auriol. \"I know nothing of\nyou.\"\n\n\"You'll know me better by-and-by, sir,\" said the Tinker, in a\nsignificant tone. \"I _must_ speak to you, and alone.\"\n\n\"If you don't go about your business, fellow, instantly, I'll give you\nin charge of the police,\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"No, you von't, sir--no, you von't,\" replied the Tinker, shaking his\nhead. And then, lowering his voice, he added, \"You'll be glad to\npurchase my silence ven you larns wot secrets o' yourn has come to my\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"Won't you get in, Mr. Darcy?\" cried Thorneycroft, whose back was\ntowards the Tinker.\n\n\"I must speak to this man,\" replied Auriol. \"I'll come to you in the\nevening. Till then, farewell, Ebba.\" And, as the coach drove away, he\nadded to the Tinker, \"Now, rascal, what have you to say?\"\n\n\"Step this vay, sir,\" replied the Tinker. \"There's two friends o' mine\nas vishes to be present at our conference. Ve'd better valk into a back\nstreet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE HAND AGAIN!\n\n\nFollowed by Auriol, who, in his turn, was followed by Ginger and the\nSandman, the Tinker directed his steps to Great Windmill Street, where\nhe entered a public-house, called the Black Lion. Leaving his\nfour-footed attendants with the landlord, with whom he was acquainted,\nGinger caused the party to be shown into a private room, and, on\nentering it, Auriol flung himself into a chair, while the dog-fancier\nstationed himself near the door.\n\n\"Now, what do you want with me?\" demanded Auriol.\n\n\"You shall learn presently,\" replied the Tinker; \"but first, it may be\nas vell to state, that a certain pocket-book has been found.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Auriol. \"You are the villains who beset me in the ruined\nhouse in the Vauxhall Road.\"\n\n\"Your pocket-book has been found, I tell you,\" replied the Tinker, \"and\nfrom it ve have made the most awful diskiveries. Our werry 'air stood on\nend ven ve first read the shockin' particulars. What a bloodthirsty\nruffian you must be! Vy, ve finds you've been i' the habit o' makin'\navay with a young ooman vonce every ten years. Your last wictim wos in\n1820--the last but one, in 1810--and the one before her, in 1800.\"\n\n\"Hangin's too good for you!\" cried the Sandman; \"but if ve peaches\nyou're sartin to sving.\"\n\n\"I hope that pretty creater I jist see ain't to be the next wictim?\"\nsaid Ginger.\n\n\"Peace!\" thundered Auriol. \"What do you require?\"\n\n\"A hundred pound each'll buy our silence,\" replied the Tinker.\n\n\"Ve ought to have double that,\" said the Sandman, \"for screenin' sich\natterocious crimes as he has parpetrated. Ve're not werry partic'lar\nourselves, but ve don't commit murder wholesale.\"\n\n\"Ve don't commit murder at all,\" said Ginger.\n\n\"You may fancy,\" pursued the Tinker, \"that ve ain't perfectly acvainted\nwith your history, but to prove that ve are, I'll just rub up your\nmemory. Did you ever hear tell of a gemman as murdered Doctor Lamb, the\nfamous halchemist o' Queen Bess's time, and, havin' drank the 'lixir\nvich the doctor had made for hisself, has lived ever since? Did you ever\nhear tell of such a person, I say?\"\n\nAuriol gazed at him in astonishment.\n\n\"What idle tale are you inventing?\" he said at length.\n\n\"It is no idle tale,\" replied the Tinker boldly. \"Ve can bring a vitness\nas'll prove the fact--a livin' vitness.\"\n\n\"What witness?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Don't you reckilect the dwarf as used to serve Doctor Lamb?\" rejoined\nthe Tinker. \"He's alive still; and ve calls him Old Parr, on account of\nhis great age.\"\n\n\"Where is he?--what has become of him?\" demanded Auriol.\n\n\"Oh, ve'll perduce him in doo time,\" replied the Tinker cunningly.\n\n\"But tell me where the poor fellow is?\" cried Auriol. \"Have you seen him\nsince last night? I sent him to a public-house at Kensington, but he has\ndisappeared from it, and I can discover no traces of him.\"\n\n\"He'll turn up somewhere--never fear,\" rejoined the Tinker. \"But now,\nsir, that ve fairly understands each other, are you agreeable to our\nterms? You shall give us an order for the money, and ve'll undertake, on\nour parts, not to mislest you more.\"\n\n\"The pocket-book must be delivered up to me if I assent,\" said Auriol,\n\"and the poor dwarf must be found.\"\n\n\"Vy, as to that, I can scarcely promise,\" replied the Tinker; \"there's a\ndifficulty in the case, you see. But the pocket-book'll never be brought\naginst you--you may rest assured o' that.\"\n\n\"I must have it, or you get nothing from me,\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Here's a bit o' paper as come from the pocket-book,\" said Ginger.\n\"Would you like to hear wot's written upon it? Here are the words: 'How\nmany crimes have I to reproach myself with! How many innocents have I\ndestroyed! And all owing to my fatal compact with----'\"\n\n\"Give me that paper,\" cried Auriol, rising, and attempting to snatch it\nfrom the dog-fancier.\n\nJust as this moment, and while Ginger retreated from Auriol, the door\nbehind him was noiselessly opened--a hand was thrust through the\nchink--and the paper was snatched from his grasp. Before Ginger could\nturn round, the door was closed again.\n\n\"Halloa! What's that?\" he cried. \"The paper's gone!\"\n\n\"The hand again!\" cried the Sandman, in alarm. \"See who's in the\npassage--open the door--quick!\"\n\nGinger cautiously complied, and, peeping forth, said--\n\n\"There's no one there. It must be the devil. I'll have nuffin' more to\ndo wi' the matter.\"\n\n\"Poh! poh! don't be so chicken-'arted!\" cried the Tinker. \"But come what\nmay, the gemman shan't stir till he undertakes to pay us three hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"You seek to frighten me in vain, villain,\" cried Auriol, upon whom the\nrecent occurrence had not been lost. \"I have but to stamp my foot, and I\ncan instantly bring assistance that shall overpower you.\"\n\n\"Don't provoke him,\" whispered Ginger, plucking the Tinker's sleeve.\n\"For my part, I shan't stay any longer. I wouldn't take his money.\" And\nhe quitted the room.\n\n\"I'll go and see wot's the matter wi' Ginger,\" said the Sandman,\nslinking after him.\n\nThe Tinker looked nervously round. He was not proof against his\nsuperstitious fears.\n\n\"Here, take this purse, and trouble me no more!\" cried Auriol.\n\nThe Tinker's hands clutched the purse mechanically, but he instantly\nlaid it down again.\n\n\"I'm bad enough--but I won't sell myself to the devil,\" he said.\n\nAnd he followed his companions.\n\nLeft alone, Auriol groaned aloud, and covered his face with his hands.\nWhen he looked up, he found the tall man in the black cloak standing\nbeside him. A demoniacal smile played upon his features.\n\n\"You here?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the stranger. \"I came to watch over your safety.\nYou were in danger from those men. But you need not concern yourself\nmore about them. I have your pocket-book, and the slip of paper that\ndropped from it. Here are both. Now let us talk on other matters. You\nhave just parted from Ebba, and will see her again this evening.\"\n\n\"Perchance,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"You will,\" rejoined the stranger peremptorily. \"Remember, your ten\nyears' limit draws to a close. In a few days it will be at an end; and\nif you renew it not, you will incur the penalty, and you know it to be\nterrible. With the means of renewal in your hands, why hesitate?\"\n\n\"Because I will not sacrifice the girl,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"You cannot help yourself,\" cried the stranger scornfully. \"I command\nyou to bring her to me.\"\n\n\"I persist in my refusal,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"It is useless to brave my power,\" said the stranger. \"A moon is just\nborn. When it has attained its first quarter, Ebba shall be mine. Till\nthen, farewell.\"\n\nAnd as the words were uttered, he passed through the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE BARBER OF LONDON\n\n\nWho has not heard of the Barber of London? His dwelling is in the\nneighbourhood of Lincoln's Inn. It is needless to particularise the\nstreet, for everybody knows the shop; that is to say, every member of\nthe legal profession, high or low. All, to the very judges themselves,\nhave their hair cut, or their wigs dressed, by him. A pleasant fellow is\nMr. Tuffnell Trigge--Figaro himself not pleasanter--and if you do not\nshave yourself--if you want a becoming flow imparted to your stubborn\nlocks, or if you require a wig, I recommend you to the care of Mr.\nTuffnell Trigge. Not only will he treat you well, but he will regale you\nwith all the gossip of the court; he will give you the last funny thing\nof Mr. Serjeant Larkins; he will tell you how many briefs the great Mr.\nSkinner Fyne receives--what the Vice-Chancellor is doing; and you will\nown, on rising, that you have never spent a five minutes more agreeably.\nBesides, you are likely to see some noticeable characters, for Mr.\nTrigge's shop is quite a lounge. Perhaps you may find a young barrister\nwho has just been \"called,\" ordering his \"first wig,\" and you may hear\nthe prognostications of Mr. Trigge as to his future distinction. \"Ah,\nsir,\" he will say, glancing at the stolid features of the young man,\n\"you have quite the face of the Chief Justice--quite the face of the\nchief--I don't recollect him ordering his first wig--that was a little\nbefore my time; but I hope to live to see you chief, sir. Quite within\nyour reach, if you choose to apply. Sure of it, sir--quite sure.\" Or you\nmay see him attending to some grave master in Chancery, and listening\nwith profound attention to his remarks; or screaming with laughter at\nthe jokes of some smart special pleader; or talking of the theatres, the\nactors and actresses, to some young attorneys, or pupils in\nconveyancers' chambers; for those are the sort of customers in whom Mr.\nTrigge chiefly delights; with them, indeed, he _is_ great, for it is by\nthem he has been dubbed the Barber of London. His shop is also\nfrequented by managing clerks, barristers' clerks, engrossing clerks,\nand others; but these are, for the most part, his private friends.\n\nMr. Trigge's shop is none of your spruce West End hair-cutting\nestablishments, with magnificent mirrors on every side, in which you may\nsee the back of your head, the front, and the side, all at once, with\nwalls bedizened with glazed French paper, and with an ante-room full of\nbears'-grease, oils, creams, tooth-powders, and cut glass. No, it is a\nreal barber's and hairdresser's shop, of the good old stamp, where you\nmay get cut and curled for a shilling, and shaved for half the price.\n\nTrue, the floor is not covered with a carpet. But what of that? It bears\nthe imprint of innumerable customers, and is scattered over with their\nhair. In the window, there is an assortment of busts moulded in wax,\nexhibiting the triumphs of Mr. Trigge's art; and above these are\nseveral specimens of legal wigs. On the little counter behind the\nwindow, amid large pots of pomade and bears'-grease, and the irons and\nbrushes in constant use by the barber, are other bustos, done to the\nlife, and for ever glancing amiably into the room. On the block is a\njudge's wig, which Mr. Trigge has just been dressing, and a little\nfarther, on a higher block, is that of a counsel. On either side of the\nfireplace are portraits of Lord Eldon and Lord Lyndhurst. Some other\nportraits of pretty actresses are likewise to be seen. Against the\ncounter rests a board, displaying the playbill of the evening; and near\nit is a large piece of emblematical crockery, indicating that\nbears'-grease may be had on the premises. Amongst Mr. Trigge's\nlive-stock may be enumerated his favourite magpie, placed in a wicker\ncage in the window, which chatters incessantly, and knows everything,\nits master avouches, \"as well as a Christian.\"\n\nAnd now as to Mr. Tuffnell Trigge himself. He is very tall and very\nthin, and holds himself so upright that he loses not an inch of his\nstature. His head is large and his face long, with marked, if not very\nstriking features, charged, it must be admitted, with a very\nself-satisfied expression. One cannot earn the appellation of the Barber\nof London without talent; and it is the consciousness of this talent\nthat lends to Mr. Trigge's features their apparently conceited\nexpression. A fringe of black whisker adorns his cheek and chin, and his\nblack bristly hair is brushed back, so as to exhibit the prodigious\nexpanse of his forehead. His eyebrows are elevated, as if in constant\nscorn.\n\nThe attire in which Mr. Trigge is ordinarily seen, consists of a black\nvelvet waistcoat, and tight black continuations. These are protected by\na white apron tied round his waist, with pockets to hold his scissors\nand combs; over all, he wears a short nankeen jacket, into the pockets\nof which his hands are constantly thrust when not otherwise employed. A\nblack satin stock with a large bow encircles his throat, and his shirt\nis fastened by black enamel studs. Such is Mr. Tuffnell Trigge, yclept\nthe Barber of London.\n\nAt the time of his introduction to the reader, Mr. Trigge had just\nadvertised for an assistant, his present young man, Rutherford Watts,\nbeing about to leave him, and set up for himself in Canterbury. It was\nabout two o'clock, and Mr. Trigge had just withdrawn into an inner room\nto take some refection, when, on returning, he found Watts occupied in\ncutting the hair of a middle-aged, sour-looking gentleman, who was\nseated before the fire. Mr. Trigge bowed to the sour-looking gentleman,\nand appeared ready to enter into conversation with him, but no notice\nbeing taken of his advances, he went and talked to his magpie.\n\nWhile he was chattering to it, the sagacious bird screamed forth:\n\"Pretty dear!--pretty dear!\"\n\n\"Ah! what's that? Who is it?\" cried Trigge.\n\n\"Pretty dear!--pretty dear!\" reiterated the magpie.\n\nUpon this, Trigge looked around, and saw a very singular little man\nenter the shop. He had somewhat the appearance of a groom, being clothed\nin a long grey coat, drab knees, and small top-boots. He had a large and\nremarkably projecting mouth, like that of a baboon, and a great shock\nhead of black hair.\n\n\"Pretty dear!--pretty dear!\" screamed the magpie.\n\n\"I see nothing pretty about him,\" thought Mr. Trigge. \"What a strange\nlittle fellow! It would puzzle the Lord Chancellor himself to say what\nhis age might be.\"\n\nThe little man took off his hat, and making a profound bow to the\nbarber, unfolded the _Times_ newspaper, which he carried under his arm,\nand held it up to Trigge.\n\n\"What do you want, my little friend, eh?\" said the barber.\n\n\"High wages!--high wages!\" screamed the magpie.\n\n\"Is this yours, sir?\" replied the little man, pointing to an\nadvertisement in the newspaper.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's my advertisement, friend,\" replied Mr. Trigge. \"But\nwhat of it?\"\n\nBefore the little man could answer, a slight interruption occurred.\nWhile eyeing the new-comer, Watts neglected to draw forth the hot\ncurling-irons, in consequence of which he burnt the sour-looking\ngentleman's forehead, and singed his hair.\n\n\"Take care, sir!\" cried the gentleman furiously. \"What the devil are you\nabout?\"\n\n\"Yes! take care, sir, as Judge Learmouth observes to a saucy witness,\"\ncried Trigge--\"'take care, or I'll commit you!'\"\n\n\"D--n Judge Learmouth!\" cried the gentleman angrily. \"If I were a judge,\nI'd hang such a careless fellow.\"\n\n\"Sarve him right!\" screamed Mag--\"sarve him right!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Barber of London.]\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" cried Watts. \"I'll rectify you in a minute.\"\n\n\"Well, my little friend,\" observed Trigge, \"and what may be your object\nin coming to me? as the great conveyancer, Mr. Plodwell, observes to his\nclients--what may be your object?\"\n\n\"You want an assistant, don't you, sir?\" rejoined the little man humbly.\n\n\"Do you apply on your own account, or on behalf of a friend?\" asked\nTrigge.\n\n\"On my own,\" replied the little man.\n\n\"What are your qualifications?\" demanded Trigge--\"what are your\nqualifications?\"\n\n\"I fancy I understand something of the business,\" replied the little\nman. \"I was a perruquier myself, when wigs were more in fashion than\nthey are now.\"\n\n\"Ha! indeed!\" said Trigge, laughing. \"That must have been in the last\ncentury--in Queen Anne's time--eh?\"\n\n\"You have hit it exactly, sir,\" replied the little man. \"It _was_ in\nQueen Anne's time.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn, my little Nestor?\"\ncried Mr. Trigge.\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied the little man. \"French periwigs were first worn in\nCharles the Second's time.\"\n\n\"You saw 'em, of course?\" cried the barber, with a sneer.\n\n\"I did,\" replied the little man quietly.\n\n\"Oh, he must be out of his mind,\" cried Trigge. \"We shall have a\ncommission _de lunatico_ to issue here, as the Master of the Rolls would\nobserve.\"\n\n\"I hope I may suit you, sir,\" said the little man.\n\n\"I don't think you will, my friend,\" replied Mr. Trigge; \"I don't think\nyou will. You don't seem to have a hand for hairdressing. Are you aware\nof the talent the art requires? Are you aware what it has cost me to\nearn the enviable title of the Barber of London? I'm as proud of that\ntitle as if I were----\"\n\n\"Lord Chancellor!--Lord Chancellor!\" screamed Mag.\n\n\"Precisely, Mag,\" said Mr. Trigge; \"as if I were Lord Chancellor.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry for it,\" said the little man disconsolately.\n\n\"Pretty dear!\" screamed Mag; \"pretty dear!\"\n\n\"What a wonderful bird you have got!\" said the sour-looking gentleman,\nrising and paying Mr. Trigge. \"I declare its answers are quite\nappropriate.\"\n\n\"Ah! Mag is a clever creature, sir--that she is,\" replied the barber. \"I\ngave a good deal for her.\"\n\n\"Little or nothing!\" screamed Mag--\"little or nothing!\"\n\n\"What is your name, friend?\" said the gentleman, addressing the little\nman, who still lingered in the shop.\n\n\"Why, sir, I've had many names in my time,\" he replied. \"At one time I\nwas called Flapdragon--at another, Old Parr--but my real name, I\nbelieve, is Morse--Gregory Morse.\"\n\n\"An Old Bailey answer,\" cried Mr. Trigge, shaking his head. \"Flapdragon,\nalias Old Parr--alias Gregory Morse--alias----\"\n\n\"Pretty dear!\" screamed Mag.\n\n\"And you want a place?\" demanded the sour-looking gentleman, eyeing him\nnarrowly.\n\n\"Sadly,\" replied Morse.\n\n\"Well, then, follow me,\" said the gentleman, \"and I'll see what can be\ndone for you.\"\n\nAnd they left the shop together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MOON IN THE FIRST QUARTER\n\n\nIn spite of his resolution to the contrary, Auriol found it impossible\nto resist the fascination of Ebba's society, and became a daily visitor\nat her father's house. Mr. Thorneycroft noticed the growing attachment\nbetween them with satisfaction. His great wish was to see his daughter\nunited to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing the\nway, he let Auriol understand that he should give her a considerable\nmarriage portion.\n\nFor the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken place in Auriol's\nmanner, and he seemed to have shaken off altogether the cloud that had\nhitherto sat upon his spirits. Enchanted by the change, Ebba indulged in\nthe most blissful anticipations of the future.\n\nOne evening they walked forth together, and almost unconsciously\ndirected their steps towards the river. Lingering on its banks, they\ngazed on the full tide, admired the glorious sunset, and breathed over\nand over again those tender nothings so eloquent in lovers' ears.\n\n\"Oh! how different you are from what you were a week ago,\" said Ebba\nplayfully. \"Promise me not to indulge in any more of those gloomy\nfancies.\"\n\n\"I will not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured, sweet Ebba,\"\nhe replied. \"But my spirits are not always under my control. I am\nsurprised at my own cheerfulness this evening.\"\n\n\"I never felt so happy,\" she replied; \"and the whole scene is in unison\nwith my feelings. How soothing is the calm river flowing at our\nfeet!--how tender is the warm sky, still flushed with red, though the\nsun has set!--And see, yonder hangs the crescent moon. She is in her\nfirst quarter.\"\n\n\"The moon in her first quarter!\" cried Auriol, in a tone of anguish.\n\"All then is over.\"\n\n\"What means this sudden change?\" cried Ebba, frightened by his looks.\n\n\"Oh, Ebba,\" he replied, \"I must leave you. I have allowed myself to\ndream of happiness too long. I am an accursed being, doomed only to\nbring misery upon those who love me. I warned you on the onset, but you\nwould not believe me. Let me go, and perhaps it may not yet be too late\nto save you.\"\n\n\"Oh no, do not leave me!\" cried Ebba. \"I have no fear while you are with\nme.\"\n\n\"But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to,\" he said. \"This\nis the night when it will be accomplished.\"\n\n\"Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to do, dear Auriol,\"\nshe rejoined, \"because I know them to be the fruit of a diseased\nimagination. Come, let us continue our walk,\" she added, taking his arm\nkindly.\n\n\"Ebba,\" he cried, \"I implore you to let me go! I have not the power to\ntear myself away unless you aid me.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" she rejoined, \"for then I shall hold you fast.\"\n\n\"You know not what you do!\" cried Auriol. \"Release me! oh, release me!\"\n\n\"In a few moments the fit will be passed,\" she rejoined. \"Let us walk\ntowards the abbey.\"\n\n\"It is in vain to struggle against fate,\" ejaculated Auriol\ndespairingly.\n\nAnd he suffered himself to be led in the direction proposed.\n\nEbba continued to talk, but her discourse fell upon a deaf ear, and at\nlast she became silent too. In this way they proceeded along Millbank\nStreet and Abingdon Street, until, turning off on the right, they found\nthemselves before an old and partly-demolished building. By this time it\nhad become quite dark, for the moon was hidden behind a rack of clouds,\nbut a light was seen in the upper storey of the structure, occasioned,\nno doubt, by a fire within it, which gave a very picturesque effect to\nthe broken outline of the walls.\n\nPausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Ebba expressed a wish to\nenter it. Auriol offered no opposition, and passing through an arched\ndoorway, and ascending a short, spiral, stone staircase, they presently\narrived at a roofless chamber, which it was evident, from the implements\nand rubbish lying about, was about to be razed to the ground. On one\nside there was a large arch, partly bricked up, through which opened a\nnarrow doorway, though at some height from the ground. With this a\nplank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of stones, amongst\nwhich were some grotesque carved heads. In the centre of the chamber was\na large square opening, like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the\ntop of a ladder projected, and near it stood a flaming brazier, which\nhad cast forth the glare seen from below. Over the ruinous walls on the\nright hung the crescent moon, now emerged from the cloud, and shedding a\nghostly glimmer on the scene.\n\n\"What a strange place!\" cried Ebba, gazing around with some\napprehension. \"It looks like a spot one reads of in romance. I wonder\nwhere that trap leads to?\"\n\n\"Into the vault beneath, no doubt,\" replied Auriol. \"But why did we come\nhither?\"\n\nAs he spoke, there was a sound like mocking laughter, but whence arising\nit was difficult to say.\n\n\"Did you hear that sound?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the street,\" she replied.\n\"You alarm yourself without reason, Auriol.\"\n\n\"No, not without reason,\" he cried. \"I am in the power of a terrible\nbeing, who seeks to destroy you, and I know that he is at hand. Listen\nto me, Ebba, and however strange my recital may appear, do not suppose\nit the ravings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.\"\n\n\"Beware!\" cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from the depths of the\nvault.\n\n\"Some one spoke,\" cried Ebba. \"I begin to share your apprehensions. Let\nus quit this place.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Auriol.\n\n\"Not so fast,\" cried a deep voice.\n\nAnd they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak barring their\npassage out.\n\n\"Ebba, you are mine,\" cried the stranger. \"Auriol has brought you to\nme.\"\n\n\"It is false!\" cried Auriol. \"I never will yield her to you.\"\n\n\"Remember your compact,\" rejoined the stranger, with a mocking laugh.\n\n\"Oh, Auriol!\" cried Ebba, \"I fear for your soul. You have not made a\ncompact with this fiend?\"\n\n\"He has,\" replied the stranger; \"and by that compact you are surrendered\nto me.\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, he advanced towards her, and enveloping her in his\ncloak, her cries were instantly stifled.\n\n\"You shall not go!\" cried Auriol, seizing him. \"Release her, or I\nrenounce you wholly.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" cried the stranger, \"since you provoke my wrath, take your\ndoom.\"\n\nAnd he stamped on the ground. At this signal an arm was thrust from the\ntrap-door, and Auriol's hand was seized with an iron grasp.\n\nWhile this took place, the stranger bore his lovely burden swiftly up\nthe plank leading to the narrow doorway in the wall, and just as he was\npassing through it he pointed towards the sky, and shouted with a\nmocking smile to Auriol--\"Behold! the moon is in her first quarter. My\nwords are fulfilled!\"\n\nAnd he disappeared.\n\nAuriol tried to disengage himself from the grasp imposed upon him in\nvain. Uttering ejaculations of rage and despair, he was dragged forcibly\nbackwards into the vault.\n\n[Illustration: Seizure of Ebba.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE STATUE AT CHARING CROSS\n\n\nOne morning, two persons took their way along Parliament Street and\nWhitehall, and, chatting as they walked, turned into the entrance of\nSpring Gardens, for the purpose of looking at the statue at Charing\nCross. One of them was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange\nwithered features. The other was a man of middle size, thin, rather\nelderly, and with a sharp countenance, the sourness of which was\nredeemed by a strong expression of benevolence. He was clad in a black\ncoat, rather rusty, but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black\ntights, short drab gaiters, and wore a white neckcloth and spectacles.\n\nMr. Loftus (for so he was called) was a retired merchant, of moderate\nfortune, and lived in Abingdon Street. He was a bachelor, and therefore\npleased himself; and being a bit of an antiquary, rambled about all day\nlong in search of some object of interest. His walk, on the present\noccasion, was taken with that view.\n\n\"By Jove! what a noble statue that is, Morse!\" cried Loftus, gazing at\nit. \"The horse is magnificent--positively magnificent.\"\n\n\"I recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet, and when, in lieu\nof a statue, an effigy of the martyred monarch was placed there,\"\nreplied Morse. \"That was in the time of the Protectorate.\"\n\n\"You cannot get those dreams out of your head, Morse,\" said Loftus,\nsmiling. \"I wish I could persuade myself I had lived for two centuries\nand a half.\"\n\n\"Would you could have seen the ancient cross, which once stood there,\nerected by Edward the First to his beloved wife, 'Eleanor of Castile'!\"\nsaid Morse, heedless of the other's remark. \"It was much mutilated when\nI remember it; some of the pinnacles were broken, and the foliage\ndefaced, but the statues of the queen were still standing in the\nrecesses; and altogether the effect was beautiful.\"\n\n\"It must have been charming,\" observed Loftus, rubbing his hands; \"and,\nthough I like the statue, I would much rather have had the old Gothic\ncross. But how fortunate the former escaped destruction in Oliver\nCromwell's time!\"\n\n\"I can tell you how that came to pass, sir,\" replied Morse, \"for I was\nassistant to John Rivers, the brazier, to whom the statue was sold.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed!\" exclaimed Loftus. \"I have heard something of the story,\nbut should like to have full particulars.\"\n\n\"You shall hear them, then,\" replied Morse. \"Yon statue, which, as you\nknow, was cast by Hubert le Sueur, in 1633, was ordered by Parliament to\nbe sold and broken to pieces. Well, my master, John Rivers, being a\nstanch Royalist, though he did not dare to avow his principles,\ndetermined to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly, he offered a\ngood round sum for it, and was declared the purchaser. But how to\ndispose of it was the difficulty? He could trust none of his men but me,\nwhom he knew to be as hearty a hater of the Roundheads, and as loyal to\nthe memory of our slaughtered sovereign, as himself. Well, we digged a\ngreat pit, secretly, in the cellar, whither the statue had been\nconveyed, and buried it. The job occupied us nearly a month; and during\nthat time, my master collected together all the pieces of old brass he\ncould procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared they were the\nfragments of the statue. But the cream of the jest was to come. He began\nto cast handles of knives and forks in brass, giving it out that they\nwere made from the metal of the statue. And plenty of 'em he sold too,\nfor the Cavaliers bought 'em as memorials of their martyred monarch, and\nthe Roundheads as evidences of his fall. In this way he soon got back\nhis outlay.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Loftus.\n\n\"Well, in due season came the Restoration,\" pursued Morse; \"and my\nmaster made known to King Charles the Second the treasure he had kept\nconcealed for him. It was digged forth, placed in its old position--but\nI forget whether the brazier was rewarded. I rather think not.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" cried Loftus; \"he was sufficiently rewarded by the\nconsciousness of having done a noble action. But let us go and examine\nthe sculpture on the pedestal more closely.\"\n\nWith this he crossed over the road; and, taking off his hat, thrust his\nhead through the iron railing surrounding the pedestal, while Morse, in\norder to point out the beauties of the sculpture with greater\nconvenience, mounted upon a stump beside him.\n\n\"You are aware that this is the work of Grinling Gibbons, sir?\" cried\nthe dwarf.\n\n\"To be sure I am,\" replied Loftus--\"to be sure. What fancy and gusto is\ndisplayed in the treatment of these trophies!\"\n\n\"The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable,\" cried Morse.\n\n\"Never saw anything finer,\" rejoined Loftus--\"never, upon my life.\"\n\nEvery one knows how easily a crowd is collected in London, and it cannot\nbe supposed that our two antiquaries would be allowed to pursue their\ninvestigations unmolested. Several ragged urchins got round them, and\ntried to discover what they were looking at, at the same time cutting\ntheir jokes upon them. These were speedily joined by a street-sweeper,\nrather young in the profession, a ticket-porter, a butcher's apprentice,\nan old Israelitish clothes-man, a coalheaver, and a couple of\ncharity-boys.\n\n\"My eyes!\" cried the street-sweeper, \"only twig these coves. If they\nain't green 'uns, I'm done.\"\n\n\"Old Spectacles thinks he has found it all out,\" remarked the porter;\n\"ve shall hear wot it all means by-and-by.\"\n\n\"Plesh ma 'art,\" cried the Jew, \"vat two funny old genelmen. I vonder\nvat they thinks they sees?\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee, master,\" rejoined the butcher's apprentice; \"they're a\ntryin' vich on 'em can see farthest into a millstone.\"\n\n[Illustration: Antiquaries.]\n\n\"Only think of living all my life in London, and never examining this\nadmirable work of art before!\" cried Loftus, quite unconscious that he\nhad become the object of general curiosity.\n\n\"Look closer at it, old gem'man,\" cried the porter. \"The nearer you get,\nthe more you'll admire it.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" replied Loftus, fancying Morse had spoken; \"it'll bear the\nclosest inspection.\"\n\n\"I say, Ned,\" observed one of the charity-boys to the other, \"do you get\nover the railin'; they must ha' dropped summat inside. See what it is.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid o' spikin' myself, Joe,\" replied the other; \"but just give\nus a lift, and I'll try.\"\n\n\"Wot are you arter there, you young rascals?\" cried the coalheaver;\n\"come down, or I'll send the perlice to you.\"\n\n\"Wot two precious guys these is!\" cried a ragamuffin lad, accompanied by\na bulldog. \"I've a good mind to chuck the little 'un off the post, and\nset Tartar at him. Here, boy, here!\"\n\n\"That 'ud be famous fun, indeed, Spicer!\" cried another rapscallion\nbehind him.\n\n\"Arrah! let 'em alone, will you there, you young divils!\" cried an Irish\nbricklayer; \"don't you see they're only two paiceable antiquaries.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're antiquaries, are they?\" screamed the little street-sweeper.\n\"Vell, I never see the likes on 'em afore; did you, Sam?\"\n\n\"Never,\" replied the porter.\n\n\"Och, murther in Irish! ye're upsettin' me, an' all the fruits of my\nindustry,\" cried an applewoman, against whom the bricklayer had run his\nbarrow. \"Divil seize you for a careless wagabone! Why don't you look\nwhere ye're goin', and not dhrive into people in that way?\"\n\n\"Axes pardon, Molly,\" said the bricklayer; \"but I was so inter_est_ed in\nthem antiquaries, that I didn't obsarve ye.\"\n\n\"Antiquaries be hanged! what's such warmint to me?\" cried the applewoman\nfuriously. \"You've destroyed my day's market, and bad luck to ye!\"\n\n\"Well, never heed, Molly,\" cried the good-natured bricklayer; \"I'll make\nit up t'ye. Pick up your apples, and you shall have a dhrop of the\ncraiter if you'll come along wid me.\"\n\nWhile this was passing, a stout gentleman came from the farther side of\nthe statue, and perceiving Loftus, cried--\"Why, brother-in-law, is that\nyou?\"\n\nBut Loftus was too much engrossed to notice him, and continued to\nexpiate upon the beauty of the trophies.\n\n\"What are you talking about, brother?\" cried the stout gentleman.\n\n\"Grinling Gibbons,\" replied Loftus, without turning round. \"Horace\nWalpole said that no one before him could give to wood the airy\nlightness of a flower, and here he has given it to a stone.\"\n\n\"This may be all very fine, my good fellow,\" said the stout gentleman,\nseizing him by the shoulder; \"but don't you see the crowd you're\ncollecting round you? You'll be mobbed presently.\"\n\n\"Why, how the devil did you come here, brother Thorneycroft?\" cried\nLoftus, at last recognising him.\n\n\"Come along, and I'll tell you,\" replied the iron-merchant, dragging him\naway, while Morse followed closely behind them. \"I'm so glad to have met\nyou,\" pursued Thorneycroft, as soon as they were clear of the mob;\n\"you'll be shocked to hear what has happened to your niece, Ebba.\"\n\n\"Why, what _has_ happened to her?\" demanded Loftus. \"You alarm me. Out\nwith it at once. I hate to be kept in suspense.\"\n\n\"She has left me,\" replied Thorneycroft--\"left her old indulgent\nfather--run away.\"\n\n\"Run away!\" exclaimed Loftus. \"Impossible! I'll not believe it--even\nfrom your lips.\"\n\n\"Would it were not so!--but it is, alas! too true,\" replied Thorneycroft\nmournfully. \"And the thing was so unnecessary, for I would gladly have\ngiven her to the young man. My sole hope is that she has not utterly\ndisgraced herself.\"\n\n\"No, she is too high principled for that,\" cried Loftus. \"Rest easy on\nthat score. But with whom has she run away?\"\n\n\"With a young man named Auriol Darcy,\" replied Thorneycroft. \"He was\nbrought to my house under peculiar circumstances.\"\n\n\"I never heard of him,\" said Loftus.\n\n\"But I have,\" interposed Morse. \"I've known him these two hundred\nyears.\"\n\n\"Eh day! who's this?\" cried Thorneycroft.\n\n\"A crack-brained little fellow, whom I've engaged as valet,\" replied\nLoftus. \"He fancies he was born in Queen Elizabeth's time.\"\n\n\"It's no fancy,\" cried Morse. \"I am perfectly acquainted with Auriol\nDarcy's history. He drank of the same elixir as myself.\"\n\n\"If you know him, can you give us a clue to find him?\" asked\nThorneycroft.\n\n\"I am sorry I cannot,\" replied Morse. \"I only saw him for a few minutes\nthe other night, after I had been thrown into the Serpentine by the tall\nman in the black cloak.\"\n\n\"What's that you say?\" cried Thorneycroft quickly. \"I have heard Ebba\nspeak of a tall man in a black cloak having some mysterious connection\nwith Auriol. I hope that person has nothing to do with her\ndisappearance.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he had,\" replied Morse. \"I believe that black\ngentleman to be----\"\n\n\"What!--who?\" demanded Thorneycroft.\n\n\"Neither more nor less than the devil,\" replied Morse mysteriously.\n\n\"Pshaw! poh!\" cried Loftus. \"I told you the poor fellow was half\ncracked.\"\n\nAt this moment, a roguish-looking fellow, with red whiskers and hair,\nand clad in a velveteen jacket with ivory buttons, who had been watching\nthe iron-merchant at some distance, came up, and touching his hat, said,\n\"Mr. Thorneycroft, I believe?\"\n\n\"My name is Thorneycroft, fellow!\" cried the iron-merchant, eyeing him\naskance. \"And your name, I fancy, is Ginger?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir,\" replied the dog-fancier, again touching his hat,\n\"ex-actly. I didn't think you would rekilect me, sir. I bring you some\nnews of your darter.\"\n\n\"Of Ebba!\" exclaimed Thorneycroft, in a tone of deep emotion. \"I hope\nyour news is good.\"\n\n\"I wish it wos better, for her sake as well as yours, sir,\" replied the\ndog-fancier gravely; \"but I'm afeerd she's in werry bad hands.\"\n\n\"That she is, if she's in the hands o' the black gentleman,\" observed\nMorse.\n\n\"Vy, Old Parr, that ain't you?\" cried Ginger, gazing at him in\nastonishment. \"Vy, 'ow you are transmogrified, to be sure!\"\n\n\"But what of my daughter?\" cried Thorneycroft; \"where is she? Take me to\nher, and you shall be well rewarded.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best to take you to her, and without any reward, sir,\"\nreplied Ginger, \"for my heart bleeds for the poor young creater. As I\nsaid afore, she's in dreadful bad hands.\"\n\n\"Do you allude to Mr. Auriol Darcy?\" cried Thorneycroft.\n\n\"No, he's as much a wictim of this infernal plot as your darter,\"\nreplied Ginger; \"I thought him quite different at first--but I've\naltered my mind entirely since some matters has come to my knowledge.\"\n\n\"You alarm me greatly by these dark hints,\" cried Thorneycroft. \"What is\nto be done?\"\n\n\"I shall know in a few hours,\" replied Ginger. \"I ain't got the exact\nclue yet. But come to me at eleven o'clock to-night, at the Turk's Head,\nat the back o' Shoreditch Church, and I'll put you on the right scent.\nYou must come alone.\"\n\n\"I should wish this gentleman, my brother-in-law, to accompany me,\" said\nThorneycroft.\n\n\"He couldn't help you,\" replied Ginger. \"I'll take care to have plenty\nof assistance. It's a dangerous bus'ness, and can only be managed in a\nsartin way, and by a sartin person, and he'd object to any von but you.\nTo-night, at eleven! Good-bye, Old Parr. Ve shall meet again ere long.\"\n\nAnd without a word more, he hurried away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPREPARATIONS\n\n\nOn that same night, at the appointed hour, Mr. Thorneycroft repaired to\nShoreditch, and entering a narrow street behind the church, speedily\ndiscovered the Turk's Head, at the door of which a hackney-coach was\nstanding. He was shown by the landlord into a small back room, in which\nthree men were seated at a small table, smoking, and drinking gin and\nwater, while a fourth was standing near the fire, with his back towards\nthe door. The latter was a tall, powerfully built man, wrapped in a\nrough greatcoat, and did not turn round on the iron-merchant's entrance.\n\n\"You are punctual, Mr. Thorneycroft,\" said Ginger, who was one of the\ntrio at the table; \"and I'm happy to say, I've arranged everythin' for\nyou, sir. My friends are ready to undertake the job. Only they von't do\nit on quite sich easy terms as mine.\"\n\nThe Tinker and the Sandman coughed slightly, to intimate their entire\nconcurrence in Mr. Ginger's remark.\n\n\"As I said to you this mornin', Mr. Thorneycroft,\" pursued Ginger, \"this\nis a difficult and a dangerous bus'ness, and there's no knowin' wot may\ncome on it. But it's your only chance o' recoverin' your darter.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's your only chance,\" echoed the Tinker.\n\n\"Ve're about to risk our precious lives for you, sir,\" said the Sandman;\n\"so, in coorse, ve expects a perportionate revard.\"\n\n\"If you enable me to regain my daughter, you shall not find me\nungrateful,\" rejoined the iron-merchant.\n\n\"I must have a hundred pounds,\" said the Tinker--\"that's my lowest.\"\n\n\"And mine, too,\" said the Sandman.\n\n\"I shall take nuffin' but the glory, as I said afore,\" remarked Ginger.\n\"I'm sworn champion o' poor distressed young damsils; but my friends\nmust make their own bargins.\"\n\n\"Well, I assent,\" returned Mr. Thorneycroft; \"and the sooner we set out\nthe better.\"\n\n\"Are you armed?\" asked Ginger.\n\n\"I have a brace of pistols in my pocket,\" replied Thorneycroft.\n\n\"All right, then--ve've all got pops and cutlashes,\" said Ginger. \"So\nlet's be off.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Tinker and Sandman arose; and the man in the rough\ngreatcoat, who had hitherto remained with his back to them, turned\nround. To the iron-merchant's surprise, he perceived that the face of\nthis individual was covered with a piece of black crape.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he demanded with some misgiving.\n\n\"A friend,\" replied Ginger. \"Vithout him ve could do nuffin'. His name\nis Reeks, and he is the chief man in our enterprise.\"\n\n\"He claims a reward too, I suppose?\" said Thorneycroft.\n\n\"I will tell you what reward I claim, Mr. Thorneycroft,\" rejoined Reeks,\nin a deep stern tone, \"when all is over. Meantime, give me your solemn\npledge, that whatever you may behold to-night, you will not divulge it.\"\n\n\"I give it,\" replied the iron-merchant, \"provided always----\"\n\n\"No provision, sir,\" interrupted the other quickly. \"You must swear to\nkeep silence unconditionally, or I will not move a footstep with you;\nand I alone can guide you where your daughter is detained.\"\n\n\"Svear, sir; it is your only chance,\" whispered Ginger.\n\n\"Well, if it must be, I do swear to keep silence,\" rejoined Mr.\nThorneycroft; \"but your proceedings appear very mysterious.\"\n\n\"The whole affair is mysterious,\" replied Reeks. \"You must also consent\nto have a bandage passed over your eyes when you get into the coach.\"\n\n\"Anything more?\" asked the iron-merchant.\n\n\"You must engage to obey my orders, without questioning, when we arrive\nat our destination,\" rejoined Reeks. \"Otherwise, there is no chance of\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Be it as you will,\" returned Thorneycroft, \"I must perforce agree.\"\n\n\"All then is clearly understood,\" said Reeks, \"and we can now set out.\"\n\nUpon this, Ginger conducted Mr. Thorneycroft to the coach, and as soon\nas the latter got into it, tied a handkerchief tightly over his eyes. In\nthis state Mr. Thorneycroft heard the Tinker and the Sandman take their\nplaces near him, but not remarking the voice of Reeks, concluded that he\nmust have got outside.\n\nThe next moment, the coach was put in motion, and rattled over the\nstones at a rapid pace. It made many turns; but at length proceeded\nsteadily onwards, while from the profound silence around, and the\ngreater freshness of the air, Mr. Thorneycroft began to fancy they had\ngained the country. Not a word was spoken by any one during the ride.\n\nAfter a while, the coach stopped, the door was opened, and Mr.\nThorneycroft was helped out. The iron-merchant expected his bandage\nwould now be removed, but he was mistaken, for Reeks, taking his arm,\ndrew him along at a quick pace. As they advanced, the iron-merchant's\nconductor whispered him to be cautious, and, at the same time, made him\nkeep close to a wall. A door was presently opened, and as soon as the\nparty had passed through, it closed.\n\nThe bandage was then removed from Thorneycroft's eyes, and he found\nhimself in a large and apparently neglected garden. Though the sky was\ncloudy, there was light enough to enable him to distinguish that they\nwere near an old dilapidated mansion.\n\n\"We are now arrived,\" said Reeks to the iron-merchant, \"and you will\nhave need of all your resolution.\"\n\n\"I will deliver her, or perish in the attempt,\" said Thorneycroft,\ntaking out his pistols.\n\nThe others drew their cutlasses.\n\n\"Now then, follow me,\" said Reeks, \"and act as I direct.\"\n\nWith this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges of privet,\nwhich brought them to the back part of the house. Passing through a\ndoor, he entered the yard, and creeping cautiously along the wall,\nreached a low window, which he contrived to open without noise. He then\npassed through it, and was followed by the others.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE CHAMBER OF MYSTERY\n\n\nWe shall now return to the night of Ebba's seizure by the mysterious\nstranger. Though almost deprived of consciousness by terror, the poor\ngirl could distinguish, from the movements of her captor, that she was\nborne down a flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a\nconsiderable distance along level ground. She was next placed in a\ncarriage, which was driven with great swiftness, and though it was\nimpossible to conjecture in what direction she was conveyed, it seemed\nto her terrified imagination as if she were hurried down a precipice,\nand she expected every moment to be dashed in pieces. At length the\nvehicle stopped, and she was lifted out of it, and carried along a\nwinding passage; after which, the creaking of hinges announced that a\ndoor was opened. Having passed through it, she was deposited on a bench,\nwhen, fright overmastering her, her senses completely forsook her.\n\nOn recovering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil covered with black\nvelvet, in the midst of a gloomy chamber of vast extent, while beside\nher, and supporting her from falling, stood the mysterious and terrible\nstranger. He held a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her\nlips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. The powerful\nstimulant revived her, but, at the same time, produced a strange\nexcitement, against which she struggled with all her power. Her\npersecutor again held the goblet towards her, while a sardonic smile\nplayed upon his features.\n\n\"Drink!\" he cried; \"it will restore you, and you have much to go\nthrough.\"\n\nEbba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her lips, but noticing\nthe stranger's glance of exultation, dashed it to the ground.\n\n\"You have acted foolishly,\" he said sternly; \"the potion would have done\nyou good.\"\n\nWithdrawing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt exercised an\nirresistible influence over her, Ebba gazed fearfully round the chamber.\n\nIt was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of a sepulchre--the\nwalls and ceiling being formed of black marble, while the floor was\npaved with the same material. Not far from where she sat, on an estrade,\napproached by a couple of steps, stood a table covered with black\nvelvet, on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioned like an imp\nsupporting a caldron on his outstretched wings. In this lamp were\nseveral burners, which cast a lurid light throughout the chamber. Over\nit hung a cap equally fantastically fashioned. A dagger, with a richly\nwrought hilt, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely\nshaped mask, an open book, an antique inkstand, and a piece of\nparchment, on which some characters were inscribed. Opposite these stood\na curiously carved ebony chair.\n\nAt the lower end of the room, which was slightly elevated above the\nrest, hung a large black curtain; and on the step, in the front of it,\nwere placed two vases of jet.\n\n\"What is behind that curtain?\" shudderingly demanded Ebba of her\ncompanion.\n\n\"You will see anon,\" he replied. \"Meanwhile, seat yourself on that\nchair, and glance at the writing on the scroll.\"\n\nEbba did not move, but the stranger took her hand, and drew her to the\nseat.\n\n\"Read what is written on that paper,\" he cried imperiously.\n\nEbba glanced at the document, and a shudder passed over her frame. \"By\nthis,\" she cried, \"I surrender myself, soul and body, to you?\"\n\n\"You do,\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"I have committed no crime that can place me within the power of the\nFiend,\" cried Ebba, falling upon her knees. \"I call upon Heaven for\nprotection! Avaunt!\"\n\nAs the words were uttered, the cap suddenly fell upon the lamp, and the\nchamber was buried in profound darkness. Mocking laughter rang in her\nears, succeeded by wailing cries inexpressibly dreadful to hear.\n\nEbba continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance, and for that\nof Auriol. In the midst of her supplications she was aroused by strains\nof music of the most exquisite sweetness, proceeding apparently from\nbehind the curtain, and while listening to these sounds she was startled\nby a deafening crash as if a large gong had been stricken. The cover of\nthe lamp was then slowly raised, and the burners blazed forth as before,\nwhile from the two vases in front of the curtain arose clouds of\nincense, filling the chamber with stupefying fragrance.\n\nAgain the gong was stricken, and Ebba looked round towards the curtain.\nAbove each vase towered a gigantic figure, wrapped in a long black\ncloak, the lower part of which was concealed by the thick vapour. Hoods,\nlike the cowls of monks, were drawn over the heads of these grim and\nmotionless figures; mufflers enveloped their chins, and they wore masks,\nfrom the holes of which gleamed eyes of unearthly brightness. Their\nhands were crossed upon their breasts. Between them squatted two other\nspectral forms, similarly cloaked, hooded, and masked, with their\ngleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skinny fingers pointed\nderisively at her.\n\nBehind the curtain was placed a strong light, which showed a wide\nstaircase of black marble, leading to some upper chamber, and at the\nsame time threw the reflection of a gigantic figure upon the drapery,\nwhile a hand, the finger of which pointed towards her, was thrust from\nan opening between its folds.\n\nForcibly averting her gaze, Ebba covered her eyes with her hands, but\nlooking up again after a brief space, beheld an ebon door at the side\nrevolve upon its hinges, and give entrance to three female figures,\nrobed in black, hooded and veiled, and having their hands folded, in a\nmelancholy manner, across their breasts. Slowly and noiselessly\nadvancing, they halted within a few paces of her.\n\n\"Who and what are ye?\" she cried, wild with terror.\n\n\"The victims of Auriol!\" replied the figure on the right. \"As we are,\nsuch will you be ere long.\"\n\n\"What crime have you committed?\" demanded Ebba.\n\n\"We have loved him,\" replied the second figure.\n\n[Illustration: The Chamber of Mystery.]\n\n\"Is that a crime?\" cried Ebba. \"If so, I am equally culpable with you.\"\n\n\"You will share our doom,\" replied the third figure.\n\n\"Heaven have mercy upon me!\" exclaimed the agonised girl, dropping upon\nher knees.\n\nAt this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain exclaimed,\n\"Sign, or Auriol is lost for ever.\"\n\n\"I cannot yield my soul, even to save him,\" cried Ebba distractedly.\n\n\"Witness his chastisement, then,\" cried the voice.\n\nAnd as the words were uttered, a side door was opened on the opposite\nside, and Auriol was dragged forth from it by two masked personages, who\nlooked like familiars of the Inquisition.\n\n\"Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Ebba!\" cried Auriol, gazing\nat her distractedly.\n\n\"Will you save him before he is cast, living, into the tomb?\" cried the\nvoice.\n\nAnd at the words, a heavy slab of marble rose slowly from the floor near\nwhere Ebba sat, and disclosed a dark pit beneath.\n\nEbba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror.\n\n\"There he will be immured, unless you sign,\" cried the voice; \"and, as\nhe is immortal, he will endure an eternity of torture.\"\n\n\"I cannot save him so, but I may precede him,\" cried Ebba. And throwing\nher hands aloft, she flung herself into the pit.\n\nA fearful cry resounded through the chamber. It broke from Auriol, who\nvainly strove to burst from those who held him, and precipitate himself\nafter Ebba.\n\nSoon after this, and while Auriol was gazing into the abyss, a tongue of\nblue flame arose from it, danced for a moment in the air, and then\nvanished. No sooner was it gone than a figure, shrouded in black\nhabiliments, and hooded and muffled up like the three other female\nforms, slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support, and\nremained motionless at its brink.\n\n\"Ebba!\" exclaimed Auriol, in a voice of despair. \"Is it you?\"\n\nThe figure bowed its head, but spoke not.\n\n\"Sign!\" thundered the voice. \"Your attempt at self-destruction has\nplaced you wholly in my power. Sign!\"\n\nAt this injunction, the figure moved slowly towards the table, and to\nhis unspeakable horror, Auriol beheld it take up the pen and write upon\nthe parchment. He bent forward, and saw that the name inscribed thereon\nwas EBBA THORNEYCROFT.\n\nThe groan to which he gave utterance was echoed by a roar of diabolical\nlaughter.\n\nThe figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself with the other\nveiled forms.\n\n\"All is accomplished,\" cried the voice. \"Away with him!\"\n\nOn this, a terrible clangour was heard; the lights were extinguished;\nand Auriol was dragged through the doorway from which he had been\nbrought forth.\n\n\nEND OF THE FIRST BOOK\n\n\n\n\nINTERMEAN\n\n1800\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN\n\n\nOn the night of the 1st of March 1800, and at a late hour, a man,\nwrapped in a large horseman's cloak, and of strange and sinister\nappearance, entered an old deserted house in the neighbourhood of\nStepney Green. He was tall, carried himself very erect, and seemed in\nthe full vigour of early manhood; but his features had a worn and\nghastly look, as if bearing the stamp of long-indulged and frightful\nexcesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an expression almost\ndiabolical.\n\nThis person had gained the house from a garden behind it, and now stood\nin a large dismantled hall, from which a broad oaken staircase, with\ncuriously-carved banisters, led to a gallery, and thence to the upper\nchambers of the habitation. Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect\nof the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with spiders'\nwebs, and in some places had fallen in heaps upon the floor; the glories\nof the tapestry upon the walls were obliterated by damps; the squares of\nblack and white marble, with which the hall was paved, were loosened,\nand quaked beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace yawned\nlike the mouth of a cavern; the bolts of the closed windows were rusted\nin their sockets; and the heaps of dust before the outer door proved\nthat long years had elapsed since any one had passed through it.\n\nTaking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the individual in question\ngazed for a moment around him, and then, with a sardonic smile playing\nupon his features, directed his steps towards a room on the right, the\ndoor of which stood open.\n\nThis chamber, which was large and cased with oak, was wholly\nunfurnished, like the hall, and in an equally dilapidated condition. The\nonly decoration remaining on its walls was the portrait of a venerable\npersonage in the cap and gown of Henry the Eighth's time, painted\nagainst a panel--a circumstance which had probably saved it from\ndestruction--and beneath it, fixed in another panel, a plate of brass,\ncovered with mystical characters and symbols, and inscribed with the\nname \"Cyprianus de Rougemont, Fra. R.C.\" The same name likewise appeared\nupon a label beneath the portrait, with the date 1550.\n\nPausing before the portrait, the young man threw the light of the\nlantern full upon it, and revealed features somewhat resembling his own\nin form, but of a severe and philosophic cast. In the eyes alone could\nbe discerned the peculiar and terrible glimmer which distinguished his\nown glances.\n\nAfter regarding the portrait for some time fixedly, he thus addressed\nit:\n\n\"Dost hear me, old ancestor?\" he cried. \"I, thy descendant, Cyprian de\nRougemont, call upon thee to point out where thy gold is hidden? I know\nthat thou wert a brother of the Rosy Cross--one of the illuminati--and\ndidst penetrate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region of light.\nI know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a vast treasure;\nbut though I have made diligent search for it, and others have searched\nbefore me, thy grave has never yet been discovered! Listen to me!\nMethought Satan appeared to me in a dream last night, and bade me come\nhither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions he proposed\nwere, that I should either give him my own soul, or win him that of\nAuriol Darcy. I assented. I am here. Where is thy treasure?\"\n\nAfter a pause, he struck the portrait with his clenched hand, exclaiming\nin a loud voice:\n\n\"Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor? I call on thee to give me thy\ntreasure. Dost hear, I say?\"\n\nAnd he repeated the blow with greater violence.\n\nDisturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the picture started from\nits place, and fell to the ground.\n\n\"What is this?\" cried Rougemont, gazing into the aperture left by the\nplate. \"Ha!--my invocation has been heard!\"\n\nAnd, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the bottom of a little\nrecess, about two feet deep, a stone, with an iron ring in the centre of\nit. Uttering a joyful cry, he seized the ring, and drew the stone\nforward without difficulty, disclosing an open space beyond it.\n\n\"This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor's tomb,\" cried Rougemont;\n\"there can be no doubt of it. The old Rosicrucian has kept his secret\nwell; but the devil has helped me to wrest it from him. And now to\nprocure the necessary implements, in case, as is not unlikely, I should\nexperience further difficulty.\"\n\nWith this he hastily quitted the room, but returned almost immediately\nwith a mallet, a lever, and a pitchfork; armed with which and the\nlantern, he crept through the aperture. This done, he found himself at\nthe head of a stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the\narched entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout oak, was\nlocked, but holding up the light towards it, he read the following\ninscription:\n\n    \"POST C.C.L. ANNOS PATEBO, 1550.\"\n\n\"In two hundred and fifty years I shall open!\" cried Rougemont, \"and the\ndate 1550--why, the exact time is arrived. Old Cyprian must have\nforeseen what would happen, and evidently intended to make me his heir.\nThere was no occasion for the devil's interference. And see, the key is\nin the lock. So!\" And he turned it, and pushing against the door with\nsome force, the rusty hinges gave way, and it fell inwards.\n\n[Illustration: The Tomb of the Rosicrucian.]\n\nFrom the aperture left by the fallen door, a soft and silvery light\nstreamed forth, and, stepping forward, Rougemont found himself in a\nspacious vault, from the ceiling of which hung a large globe of crystal,\ncontaining in its heart a little flame, which diffused a radiance,\ngentle as that of the moon, around. This, then, was the ever-burning\nlamp of the Rosicrucians, and Rougemont gazed at it with astonishment.\nTwo hundred and fifty years had elapsed since that wondrous flame had\nbeen lighted, and yet it burnt on brightly as ever. Hooped round the\nglobe was a serpent with its tail in its mouth--an emblem of\neternity--wrought in purest gold; while above it were a pair of silver\nwings, in allusion to the soul. Massive chains of the more costly metal,\nfashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders to the lamp.\n\nBut Rougemont's astonishment at this marvel quickly gave way to other\nfeelings, and he gazed around the vault with greedy eyes.\n\nIt was a septilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built of stone,\nand supported by beautifully groined arches. The surface of the masonry\nwas as smooth and fresh as if the chisel had only just left it.\n\nIn six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented with ironwork\nof the most exquisite workmanship, and these Rougemont's imagination\npictured as filled with inexhaustible treasure; while in the seventh\ncorner, near the door, was a beautiful little piece of monumental\nsculpture in white marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures,\nholding a veil between them, which partly concealed the entrance to a\nsmall recess. On one of the chests opposite the monument just described\nstood a strangely-formed bottle and a cup of antique workmanship, both\nencrusted with gems.\n\nThe walls were covered with circles, squares, and diagrams, and in some\nplaces were ornamented with grotesque carvings. In the centre of the\nvault was a round altar, of black marble, covered with a plate of gold,\non which Rougemont read the following inscription:\n\n    \"Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulcrum feci.\"\n\n\"Here, then, old Cyprian lies,\" he cried.\n\nAnd, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized the altar by the\nupper rim, and overthrew it. The heavy mass of marble fell with a\nthundering crash, breaking asunder the flag beneath it. It might be the\nreverberation of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to reproach\nthe young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by this warning,\nRougemont placed the point of the lever between the interstices of the\nbroken stone, and, exerting all his strength, speedily raised the\nfragments, and laid open the grave.\n\nWithin it, in the garb he wore in life, with his white beard streaming\nto his waist, lay the uncoffined body of his ancestor, Cyprian de\nRougemont. The corpse had evidently been carefully embalmed, and the\nfeatures were unchanged by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed\nover it, lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with\nbrazen clasps. Instantly possessing himself of this mysterious-looking\nvolume, Rougemont knelt upon the nearest chest, and opened it. But he\nwas disappointed in his expectation. All the pages he examined were\nfilled with cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to\ndecipher.\n\nAt length, however, he chanced upon one page the import of which he\ncomprehended, and he remained for some time absorbed in its\ncontemplation, while an almost fiendish smile played upon his features.\n\n\"Aha!\" he exclaimed, closing the volume, \"I see now the cause of my\nextraordinary dream. My ancestor's wondrous power was of infernal\norigin--the result, in fact, of a compact with the Prince of Darkness.\nBut what care I for that? Give me wealth--no matter what source it comes\nfrom!--ha! ha!\"\n\nAnd seizing the lever, he broke open the chest beside him. It was filled\nwith bars of silver. The next he visited in the same way was full of\ngold. The third was laden with pearls and precious stones; and the rest\ncontained treasure to an incalculable amount. Rougemont gazed at them in\ntransports of joy.\n\n\"At length I have my wish,\" he cried. \"Boundless wealth, and therefore\nboundless power, is mine. I can riot in pleasure--riot in vengeance. As\nto my soul, I will run the risk of its perdition; but it shall go hard\nif I destroy not that of Auriol. His love of play and his passion for\nEdith Talbot shall be the means by which I will work. But I must not\nneglect another agent which is offered me. That bottle, I have learnt\nfrom yon volume, contains an infernal potion, which, without destroying\nlife, shatters the brain, and creates maddening fancies. It will well\nserve my purpose; and I thank thee, Satan, for the gift.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE COMPACT\n\n\nAbout two months after this occurrence, and near midnight, a young man\nwas hurrying along Pall Mall, with a look of the wildest despair, when\nhis headlong course was suddenly arrested by a strong grasp, while a\nfamiliar voice sounded in his ear.\n\n\"It is useless to meditate self-destruction, Auriol Darcy,\" cried the\nperson who had checked him. \"If you find life a burden, I can make it\ntolerable to you.\"\n\nTurning round at the appeal, Auriol beheld a tall man, wrapped in a long\nblack cloak, whose sinister features were well known to him.\n\n\"Leave me, Rougemont!\" he cried fiercely. \"I want no society--above all,\nnot yours. You know very well that you have ruined me, and that nothing\nmore is to be got from me. Leave me, I say, or I may do you a mischief.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, Auriol, I am your friend!\" replied Rougemont. \"I purpose to\nrelieve your distress.\"\n\n\"Will you give me back the money you have won from me?\" cried Auriol.\n\"Will you pay my inexorable creditors? Will you save me from a prison?\"\n\n\"I will do all this, and more,\" replied Rougemont. \"I will make you one\nof the richest men in London.\"\n\n\"Spare your insulting jests, sir,\" cried Auriol. \"I am in no mood to\nbear them.\"\n\n\"I am not jesting,\" rejoined Rougemont. \"Come with me, and you shall be\nconvinced of my sincerity.\"\n\nAuriol at length assented, and they turned into Saint James's Square,\nand paused before a magnificent house. Rougemont ascended the steps.\nAuriol, who had accompanied him almost mechanically, gazed at him with\nastonishment.\n\n\"Do you live here?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Ask no questions,\" replied Rougemont, knocking at the door, which was\ninstantly opened by a hall porter, while other servants in rich liveries\nappeared at a distance. Rougemont addressed a few words in an undertone\nto them, and they instantly bowed respectfully to Auriol, while the\nforemost of them led the way up a magnificent staircase.\n\nAll this was a mystery to the young man, but he followed his conductor\nwithout a word, and was presently ushered into a gorgeously-furnished\nand brilliantly-illuminated apartment.\n\nThe servant then left them; and as soon as he was gone Auriol exclaimed,\n\"Is it to mock me that you have brought me hither?\"\n\n\"To mock you--no,\" replied Rougemont. \"I have told you that I mean to\nmake you rich. But you look greatly exhausted. A glass of wine will\nrevive you.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, he stepped towards a small cabinet, and took from it a\ncuriously-shaped bottle and a goblet.\n\n\"Taste this wine--it has been long in our family,\" he added, filling the\ncup.\n\n\"It is a strange, bewildering drink,\" cried Auriol, setting down the\nempty goblet, and passing his hand before his eyes.\n\n\"You have taken it upon an empty stomach--that is all,\" said Rougemont.\n\"You will be better anon.\"\n\n\"I feel as if I were going mad,\" cried Auriol. \"It is some damnable\npotion you have given me.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Rougemont. \"It reminds you of the elixir you once\nquaffed--eh?\"\n\n\"A truce to this raillery!\" cried Auriol angrily. \"I have said I am in\nno mood to bear it.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! I mean no offence,\" rejoined the other, changing his manner.\n\"What think you of this house?\"\n\n\"That it is magnificent,\" replied Auriol, gazing around. \"I envy you its\npossession.\"\n\n\"It shall be yours, if you please,\" replied Rougemont.\n\n\"Mine! you are mocking me again.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. You shall buy it from me, if you please.\"\n\n\"At what price?\" asked Auriol bitterly.\n\n\"At a price you can easily pay,\" replied the other. \"Come this way, and\nwe will conclude the bargain.\"\n\nProceeding towards the farther end of the room, they entered a small\nexquisitely-furnished chamber, surrounded with sofas of the most\nluxurious description. In the midst was a table, on which writing\nmaterials were placed.\n\n\"It were a fruitless boon to give you this house without the means of\nliving in it,\" said Rougemont, carefully closing the door. \"This\npocket-book will furnish you with them.\"\n\n[Illustration: The Compact.]\n\n\"Notes to an immense amount!\" cried Auriol, opening the pocket-book, and\nglancing at its contents.\n\n\"They are yours, together with the house,\" cried Rougemont, \"if you will\nbut sign a compact with me.\"\n\n\"A compact!\" cried Auriol, regarding him with a look of undefinable\nterror. \"Who and what are you?\"\n\n\"Some men would call me the devil!\" replied Rougemont carelessly. \"But\nyou know me too well to suppose that I merit such a designation. I offer\nyou wealth. What more could you require?\"\n\n\"But upon what terms?\" demanded Auriol.\n\n\"The easiest imaginable,\" replied the other. \"You shall judge for\nyourself.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, he opened a writing-desk upon the table, and took from\nit a parchment.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he added, \"and read this.\"\n\nAuriol complied, and as he scanned the writing he became transfixed with\nfear and astonishment, while the pocket-book dropped from his grasp.\n\nAfter a while he looked up at Rougemont, who was leaning over his\nshoulder, and whose features were wrinkled with a derisive smile.\n\n\"Then you _are_ the Fiend?\" he cried.\n\n\"If you will have it so--certainly,\" replied the other.\n\n\"You are Satan in the form of the man I once knew,\" cried Auriol.\n\"Avaunt! I will have no dealings with you.\"\n\n\"I thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears, Darcy,\"\nrejoined the other. \"Granting even your silly notion of me to be\ncorrect, why need you be alarmed? You are immortal.\"\n\n\"True,\" rejoined Auriol thoughtfully; \"but yet----\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" rejoined the other, \"sign, and have done with the matter.\"\n\n\"By this compact I am bound to deliver a victim--a female\nvictim--whenever you shall require it,\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Precisely,\" replied the other; \"you can have no difficulty in\nfulfilling that condition.\"\n\n\"But if I fail in doing so, I am doomed----\"\n\n\"But you will _not_ fail,\" interrupted the other, lighting a taper and\nsealing the parchment. \"Now sign it.\"\n\nAuriol mechanically took the pen, and gazed fixedly on the document.\n\n\"I shall bring eternal destruction on myself if I sign it,\" he muttered.\n\n\"A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin,\" said Rougemont,\nleaning over his shoulder. \"Riches and happiness are yours. You will not\nhave such another chance.\"\n\n\"Tempter!\" cried Auriol, hastily attaching his signature to the paper.\nBut he instantly started back aghast at the fiendish laugh that rang in\nhis ears.\n\n\"I repent--give it me back!\" he cried, endeavouring to snatch the\nparchment, which Rougemont thrust into his bosom.\n\n\"It is too late!\" cried the latter, in a triumphant tone. \"You are\nmine--irredeemably mine.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Auriol, sinking back on the couch.\n\n\"I leave you in possession of your house,\" pursued Rougemont; \"but I\nshall return in a week, when I shall require my first victim.\"\n\n\"Your first victim! oh, Heaven!\" exclaimed Auriol.\n\n\"Ay, and my choice falls on Edith Talbot!\" replied Rougemont.\n\n\"Edith Talbot!\" exclaimed Auriol; \"she your victim! Think you I would\nresign her I love better than life to you?\"\n\n\"It is because she loves you that I have chosen her,\" rejoined\nRougemont, with a bitter laugh. \"And such will ever be the case with\nyou. Seek not to love again, for your passion will be fatal to the\nobject of it. When the week has elapsed, I shall require Edith at your\nhands. Till then, farewell!\"\n\n\"Stay!\" cried Auriol. \"I break the bargain with thee, fiend. I will have\nnone of it. I abjure thee.\"\n\nAnd he rushed wildly after Rougemont, who had already gained the larger\nchamber; but, ere he could reach him, the mysterious individual had\npassed through the outer door, and when Auriol emerged upon the gallery,\nhe was nowhere to be seen.\n\nSeveral servants immediately answered the frantic shouts of the young\nman, and informed him that Mr. Rougemont had quitted the house some\nmoments ago, telling them that their master was perfectly satisfied with\nthe arrangements he had made for him.\n\n\"And we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion, sir?\" said the\nhall porter.\n\n\"You are sure Mr. Rougemont is gone?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Oh, quite sure, sir,\" cried the hall porter. \"I helped him on with his\ncloak myself. He said he should return this day week.\"\n\n\"If he comes I will not see him,\" cried Auriol sharply; \"mind that. Deny\nme to him; and on no account whatever let him enter the house.\"\n\n\"Your orders shall be strictly obeyed,\" replied the porter, staring with\nsurprise.\n\n\"Now leave me,\" cried Auriol.\n\nAnd as they quitted him, he added, in a tone and with a gesture of the\ndeepest despair, \"All precautions are useless. I am indeed lost!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIRRESOLUTION\n\n\nOn returning to the cabinet, where his fatal compact with Rougemont had\nbeen signed, Auriol perceived the pocket-book lying on the floor near\nthe table, and, taking it up, he was about to deposit it in the\nwriting-desk, when an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to\nexamine its contents. Unfolding the roll of notes, he counted them, and\nfound they amounted to more than a hundred thousand pounds. The sight of\nso much wealth, and the thought of the pleasure and the power it would\nprocure him, gradually dispelled his fears, and arising in a transport\nof delight, he exclaimed--\"Yes, yes--all obstacles are now removed! When\nMr. Talbot finds I am become thus wealthy, he will no longer refuse me\nhis daughter. But I am mad,\" he added, suddenly checking himself--\"worse\nthan mad, to indulge such hopes. If it be indeed the Fiend to whom I\nhave sold myself, I have no help from perdition! If it be man, I am\nscarcely less terribly fettered. In either case, I will not remain here\nlonger; nor will I avail myself of this accursed money, which has\ntempted me to my undoing.\"\n\nAnd, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the room, he was\nabout to pass through the door, when a mocking laugh arrested him. He\nlooked round with astonishment and dread, but could see no one. After a\nwhile, he again moved forward, but a voice, which he recognised as that\nof Rougemont, called upon him to stay.\n\n\"It will be in vain to fly,\" said the unseen speaker. \"You cannot escape\nme. Whether you remain here or not--whether you use the wealth I have\ngiven you, or leave it behind you--you cannot annul your bargain. With\nthis knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But remember, on the seventh\nnight from this I shall require Edith Talbot from you!\"\n\n\"Where are you, fiend?\" demanded Auriol, gazing around furiously. \"Show\nyourself, that I may confront you.\"\n\nA mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this injunction.\n\n\"Give me back the compact,\" cried Auriol imploringly. \"It was signed in\nignorance. I knew not the price I was to pay for your assistance. Wealth\nis of no value to me without Edith.\"\n\n\"Without wealth you could not obtain her,\" replied the voice. \"You are\nonly, therefore, where you were. But you will think better of the\nbargain to-morrow. Meanwhile, I counsel you to place the money you have\nso unwisely cast from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose.\nYou will awaken with very different thoughts in the morning.\"\n\n\"How am I to account for my sudden accession of wealth?\" inquired\nAuriol, after a pause.\n\n\"You a gambler, and ask that question!\" returned the unseen stranger,\nwith a bitter laugh. \"But I will make your mind easy on that score. As\nregards the house, you will find a regular conveyance of it within that\nwriting-desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your\naddress, comes from me, and announces the payment of a hundred and\ntwenty thousand pounds to you, as a debt of honour. You see I have\nprovided against every difficulty. And now, farewell!\"\n\nThe voice was then hushed; and though Auriol addressed several other\nquestions to the unseen speaker, no answer was returned him.\n\nAfter some moments of irresolution, Auriol once more took up the\npocket-book, and deposited it in the writing-desk, in which he found, as\nhe had been led to expect, a deed conveying the house to him. He then\nopened the note lying upon the table, and found its contents accorded\nwith what had just been told him. Placing it with the pocket-book, he\nlocked the writing-desk, exclaiming, \"It is useless to struggle\nfurther--I must yield to fate!\"\n\nThis done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting his eyes about,\nremarked the antique bottle and flagon. The latter was filled to the\nbrim--how or with what, Auriol paused not to examine; but seizing the\ncup with desperation, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a\ndraught.\n\nA species of intoxication, but pleasing as that produced by opium,\npresently succeeded. All his fears left him, and in their place the\ngentlest and most delicious fancies arose. Surrendering himself\ndelightedly to their influence, he sank upon a couch, and for some time\nwas wrapped in a dreamy elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith\nTalbot in a lovely garden, redolent of sweets, and vocal with the melody\nof birds. Their path led through a grove, in the midst of which was a\nfountain; and they were hastening towards its marble brink, when all at\nonce Edith uttered a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large\nblack snake lying before her, and upon which she would have trodden the\nnext moment. Auriol sprang forward and tried to crush the reptile with\nhis heel; but, avoiding the blow, it coiled around his leg, and plunged\nits venom teeth into his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary\nwound roused him from his slumber, and looking up, he perceived that a\nservant was in attendance.\n\nBowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had occasion for\nanything.\n\n\"Show me to my bedroom--that is all I require,\" replied Auriol, scarcely\nable to shake off the effect of the vision.\n\nAnd, getting up, he followed the man, almost mechanically, out of the\nroom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nEDITH TALBOT\n\n\nIt was late when Auriol arose on the following morning. At first,\nfinding himself in a large and most luxuriantly-furnished chamber, he\nwas at a loss to conceive how he came there, and it was some time before\nhe could fully recall the mysterious events of the previous night. As\nhad been foretold, however, by Rougemont, his position did not cause him\nso much anxiety as before.\n\nAfter attiring himself, he descended to the lower apartments, in one of\nwhich a sumptuous breakfast awaited him; and having partaken of it, he\ntook a complete survey of the house, and found it larger and more\nmagnificent even than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself from\nthe pocket-book with a certain sum, for which he fancied he might have\noccasion in the course of the day, and sallied forth. His first business\nwas to procure a splendid carriage and horses, and to order some new and\nrich habiliments to be made with the utmost expedition.\n\nHe then proceeded towards May Fair, and knocked at the door of a large\nhouse at the upper end of Curzon Street. His heart beat violently as he\nwas shown into an elegant drawing-room, and his trepidation momentarily\nincreased, until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret that\nhe had misinformed him in stating that Miss Talbot was at home. Both she\nand Mr. Talbot, he said, had gone out about half-an-hour ago. Auriol\nlooked incredulous, but without making any remark, departed. Hurrying\nhome, he wrote a few lines to Mr. Talbot, announcing the sudden and\nextraordinary change in his fortune, and formally demanding the hand of\nEdith. He was about to despatch this letter, when a note was brought him\nby his servant. It was from Edith. Having ascertained his new address\nfrom his card, she wrote to assure him of her constant attachment.\nTransported by this proof of her affection, Auriol half devoured the\nnote with kisses, and instantly sent off his own letter to her\nfather--merely adding a few words to say that he would call for an\nanswer on the morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply. Ere\nan hour had elapsed, Mr. Talbot brought it in person.\n\nMr. Talbot was a man of about sixty--tall, thin, and gentlemanlike in\ndeportment, with grey hair, and black eyebrows, which lent considerable\nexpression to the orbs beneath them. His complexion was a bilious brown,\nand he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter had so\ncaptivated Auriol, and which it is to be presumed, therefore, she\ninherited from her mother.\n\nA thorough man of the world, though not an unamiable person, Mr. Talbot\nwas entirely influenced by selfish considerations. He had hitherto\nlooked with an unfavourable eye upon Auriol's attentions to his\ndaughter, from a notion that the connection would be very undesirable in\na pecuniary point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint\nJames's Square, which fully bore out Auriol's account of his\nnewly-acquired wealth, wrought a complete change in his opinions, and he\nsoon gave the young man to understand that he should be delighted to\nhave him for a son-in-law. Finding him so favourably disposed, Auriol\nentreated him to let the marriage take place--within three days, if\npossible.\n\nMr. Talbot was greatly grieved that he could not comply with his young\nfriend's request, but he was obliged to start the next morning for\nNottingham, and could not possibly return under three days.\n\n\"But we can be married before you go?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Scarcely, I fear,\" replied Mr. Talbot, smiling blandly. \"You must\ncontrol your impatience, my dear young friend. On the sixth day from\nthis--that is, on Wednesday in next week--we are now at Friday--you\nshall be made happy.\"\n\nThe coincidence between this appointment, and the time fixed by\nRougemont for the delivery of his victim, struck Auriol forcibly. His\nemotion, however, escaped Mr. Talbot, who soon after departed, having\nengaged his future son-in-law to dine with him at seven o'clock.\n\nAuriol, it need scarcely be said, was punctual to the hour, or, rather,\nhe anticipated it. He found Edith alone in the drawing-room, and seated\nnear the window, which was filled with choicest flowers. On seeing him,\nshe uttered an exclamation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The young man\npressed his lips fervently to the little hand extended to him.\n\nEdith Talbot was a lovely brunette. Her features were regular, and her\neyes, which were perfectly splendid, were dark, almond-shaped, and of\nalmost Oriental languor. Her hair, which she wore braided over her brow\nand gathered behind in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a raven's\nwing. Her cheeks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and her\nteeth like ranges of pearls. Perfect grace accompanied all her\nmovements, and one only wondered that feet so small as those she\npossessed should have the power of sustaining a form which, though\nlightsome, was yet rounded in its proportions.\n\n\"You have heard, dear Edith, that your father has consented to our\nunion?\" said Auriol, after gazing at her for a few moments in silent\nadmiration.\n\nEdith murmured an affirmative, and blushed deeply.\n\n\"He has fixed Wednesday next,\" pursued Auriol; \"but I wish an earlier\nday could have been named. I have a presentiment that if our marriage is\nso long delayed, it will not take place at all.\"\n\n\"You are full of misgivings, Auriol,\" she replied.\n\n\"I confess it,\" he said; \"and my apprehensions have risen to such a\npoint, that I feel disposed to urge you to a private marriage, during\nyour father's absence.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Auriol; much as I love you, I could never consent to such a\nstep,\" she cried. \"You cannot urge me to it. I would not abuse my dear\nfather's trusting love. I have never deceived him, and that is the best\nassurance I can give you that I shall never deceive you.\"\n\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Talbot, who\nheld out both his hands to Auriol, and professed the greatest delight to\nsee him. And no doubt he was sincere. The dinner passed off most\npleasantly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was in high\nspirits, and his hilarity was communicated to the young couple. When\nAuriol and Mr. Talbot went up-stairs to tea, they found that Edith's\naunt, Mrs. Maitland, had arrived to take charge of her during her\nfather's absence. This lady had always exhibited a partiality for\nAuriol, and had encouraged his suit to her niece; consequently she was\nwell satisfied with the turn affairs had taken. It was near midnight\nbefore Auriol could tear himself away; and when he rose to depart, Mr.\nTalbot, who had yawned frequently, but fruitlessly, to give him a hint,\ntold him he might depend upon seeing him back on the evening of the\nthird day, and in the meantime he committed him to the care of Mrs.\nMaitland and Edith.\n\nThree days flew by rapidly and delightfully; and on the evening of the\nlast, just as the little party were assembled in the drawing-room, after\ndinner, Mr. Talbot returned from this journey.\n\n\"Well, here I am!\" he cried, clasping Edith to his bosom, \"without\nhaving encountered any misadventure. On the contrary, I have completed\nmy business to my entire satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Oh, how delighted I am to see you, dear papa!\" exclaimed Edith. \"Now,\nAuriol, you can have no more apprehensions.\"\n\n\"Apprehensions of what?\" cried Mr. Talbot.\n\n\"Of some accident befalling you, which might have interfered with our\nhappiness, sir,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"Oh, lovers are full of idle fears!\" cried Mr. Talbot. \"They are\nunreasonable beings. However, here I am, as I said before, safe and\nsound. To-morrow we will finish all preliminary arrangements, and the\nday after you shall be made happy--ha! ha!\"\n\n\"Do you know, papa, Auriol intends to give a grand ball on our\nwedding-day, and has invited all his acquaintance to it?\" remarked\nEdith.\n\n\"I hope you have not invited Cyprian Rougemont?\" said Mr. Talbot,\nregarding him fixedly.\n\n\"I have not, sir,\" replied Auriol, turning pale. \"But why do you\nparticularise him?\"\n\n\"Because I have heard some things of him not much to his credit,\"\nreplied Mr. Talbot.\n\n\"What--what have you heard, sir?\" demanded Auriol.\n\n\"Why, one shouldn't believe all the ill one hears of a man; and, indeed,\nI _cannot_ believe all I have heard of Cyprian Rougemont,\" replied Mr.\nTalbot; \"but I should be glad if you dropped his acquaintance\naltogether. And now let us change the subject.\"\n\nMr. Talbot seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and began to give her\nsome account of his journey, which appeared to have been as pleasant as\nit had been rapid.\n\nUnable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him, Auriol took his\nleave, promising to meet Mr. Talbot at his lawyer's in Lincoln's Inn, at\nnoon on the following day. He was there at the time appointed, and, to\nMr. Talbot's great delight, and the no small surprise of the lawyer,\npaid over a hundred thousand pounds, to be settled on his future wife.\n\n\"You are a perfect man of honour, Auriol,\" said Mr. Talbot, clapping him\non the shoulder, \"and I hope Edith will make you an excellent wife.\nIndeed, I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Nor I,--if I ever possess her,\" mentally ejaculated Auriol.\n\nThe morning passed in other preparations. In the evening the lovers met\nas usual, and separated with the full persuasion, on Edith's part at\nleast, that the next day would make them happy. Since the night of the\ncompact, Auriol had neither seen Rougemont, nor heard from him, and he\nneglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE SEVENTH NIGHT\n\n\nIt was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone brightly on\nAuriol's gorgeous equipage, as he drove to St. George's, Hanover Square,\nwhere he was united to Edith. Thus far all seemed auspicious, and he\nthought he could now bill defiance to fate. With the object of his love\nclose beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest ties,\nit seemed impossible she could be snatched from him. Nothing occurred\nduring the morning to give him uneasiness, and he gave orders that a\ncarriage and four should be ready an hour before midnight, to convey him\nand his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their honeymoon.\n\nNight came, and with it began to arrive the guests who were bidden to\nthe ball. No expense had been spared by Auriol to give splendour to his\nfete. It was in all respects magnificent. The amusements of the evening\ncommenced with a concert, which was performed by the first singers from\nthe Italian Opera; after which, the ball was opened by Auriol and his\nlovely bride. As soon as the dance was over, Auriol made a sign to an\nattendant, who instantly disappeared.\n\n\"Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me, Edith?\" he asked, with\na heart swelling with rapture.\n\n[Illustration: The significant whisper.]\n\n\"Quite so,\" she replied, gazing at him with tenderness; \"I long to be\nalone with you.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Auriol.\n\nEdith arose, and passing her arm under that of her husband, they quitted\nthe ball-room, but in place of descending the principal staircase, they\ntook a more private course. The hall, which they were obliged to cross,\nand which they entered from a side-door, was spacious and beautifully\nproportioned, and adorned with numerous statues on pedestals. The\nceiling was decorated with fresco paintings, and supported by two\nstately scagliola pillars. From between these, a broad staircase of\nwhite marble ascended to the upper room. As Auriol had foreseen, the\nstaircase was thronged with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors\nof which being open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and gave forth\nstrains of liveliest music. Anxious to avoid a newly-arrived party in\nthe hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a moment near a pillar.\n\n\"Ha! who is this?\" cried Edith, as a tall man, with a sinister\ncountenance, and habited entirely in black, moved from the farther side\nof the pillar, and planted himself in their path, with his back partly\ntowards them.\n\nA thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol's frame. He looked up and\nbeheld Rougemont, who, glancing over his shoulder, fixed his malignant\ngaze upon him. Retreat was now impossible.\n\n\"You thought to delude me,\" said Rougemont, in a deep whisper, audible\nonly to Auriol; \"but you counted without your host. I am come to claim\nmy victim.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you, that you tremble so, dear Auriol?\" cried\nEdith. \"Who is this strange person?\"\n\nBut her husband returned no answer. Terror had taken away his power of\nutterance.\n\n\"Your carriage waits for you at the door, madam--all is prepared,\" said\nRougemont, advancing towards her, and taking her hand.\n\n\"You are coming, Auriol?\" cried Edith, who scarcely knew whether to draw\nback or go forward.\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" cried Auriol, who fancied he saw a means of escape. \"This is\nmy friend, Mr. Rougemont--go with him.\"\n\n\"Mr. Rougemont!\" cried Edith. \"You told my father he would not be here.\"\n\n\"Your husband did not invite me, madam,\" said Rougemont, with sarcastic\nemphasis; \"but knowing I should be welcome, I came unasked. But let us\navoid those persons.\"\n\nIn another moment they were at the door. The carriage was there with its\nfour horses, and a man-servant, in travelling attire, stood beside the\nsteps. Reassured by the sight, Auriol recovered his courage, and\nsuffered Rougemont to throw a cloak over Edith's shoulders. The next\nmoment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was ensconced\nwithin it. Auriol was about to follow her, when he received a violent\nblow on the chest, which stretched him on the pavement. Before he could\nregain his feet, Rougemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps were\ninstantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box with the utmost\ncelerity, while the postillions, plunging spurs into their horses,\ndashed off with lightning speed. As the carriage turned the corner of\nKing Street, Auriol, who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of a\nlamp, Rougemont's face at the window of the carriage, charged with an\nexpression of the most fiendish triumph.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" cried Mr. Talbot, who had approached Auriol, \"I\ncame to bid you good-bye. Why do I find you here alone? Where is the\ncarriage?--what has become of Edith?\"\n\n\"She is in the power of the Fiend, and I have sold her to him,\" replied\nAuriol gloomily.\n\n\"What mean you, wretch?\" cried Mr. Talbot, in a voice of distraction. \"I\nheard that Cyprian Rougemont was here. Can it be he that has gone off\nwith her?\"\n\n\"You have hit the truth,\" replied Auriol. \"He bought her with the money\nI gave you. I have sold her and myself to perdition!\"\n\n\"Horror!\" exclaimed the old man, falling backwards.\n\n\"Ay, breathe your last--breathe your last!\" cried Auriol wildly. \"Would\nI could yield up my life, likewise!\"\n\nAnd he hurried away, utterly unconscious whither he went.\n\n\nEND OF THE INTERMEAN\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE SECOND\n\n_CYPRIAN ROUGEMONT_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE CELL\n\n\nMr. Thorneycroft and his companions had scarcely gained a passage in the\ndeserted house, which they had entered in the manner described in a\nprevious chapter, when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious\nringing of a bell overhead. The noise brought them instantly to a halt,\nand each man grasped his arms in expectation of an attack, but the peal\nceasing in a few moments, and all continuing quiet, they moved on as\nbefore, and presently reached a large hall with a lofty window over the\ndoor, which, being without shutters, afforded light enough to reveal the\ndilapidated condition of the mansion.\n\nFrom this hall four side doors opened, apparently communicating with\ndifferent chambers, three of which were cautiously tried by Reeks, but\nthey proved to be fastened. The fourth, however, yielded to his touch,\nand admitted them to a chamber, which seemed to have been recently\noccupied, for a lamp was burning within it. The walls were panelled with\ndusky oak, and hung at the lower end with tapestry, representing the\nAssyrian monarch Ninus, and his captive Zoroaster, King of the\nBactrians. The chief furniture consisted of three large high-backed and\ngrotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a powerful\nelectrical machine. Squares and circles were traced upon the floor, and\nhere and there were scattered cups and balls, and other matters\napparently belonging to a conjuring apparatus.\n\nThe room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it might be the\nrepository of a juggler. But whoever its occupant was, and whatsoever\nhis pursuits, the good things of the world were not altogether neglected\nby him, as was proved by a table spread with viands, and furnished with\nglasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles.\n\nWhile glancing upwards, Mr. Thorneycroft remarked that just above each\nchair the ceiling was pierced with a round hole, the meaning of which he\ncould not at the time comprehend, though after circumstances\nsufficiently explained it to him.\n\n\"A singular room,\" he observed to Reeks, on concluding his survey. \"Did\nyou expect to find any one here?\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" replied the other. \"That bell may have given the alarm.\nBut I will soon ascertain the point. Remain here till I return.\"\n\n\"You are not going to leave us?\" rejoined Mr. Thorneycroft uneasily.\n\n\"Only for a moment,\" said Reeks. \"Keep quiet, and no harm will befall\nyou. Whatever you may hear without, do not stir.\"\n\n\"What are we likely to hear?\" asked Thorneycroft with increasing\ntrepidation.\n\n\"That's impossible to say,\" answered Reeks; \"but I warn you not to cry\nout unnecessarily, as such an imprudence would endanger our safety.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure you don't mean to abandon us?\" persisted\nThorneycroft.\n\n\"Make yourself easy; I have no such intention,\" rejoined Reeks sternly.\n\n\"Oh! ve'll take care on you, don't be afeerd, old gent,\" said Ginger.\n\n\"Yes, ve'll take care on you,\" added the Tinker and the Sandman.\n\n\"You may depend upon them as upon me, sir,\" said Reeks. \"Before we\nexplore the subterranean apartments, I wish to see whether any one is\nup-stairs.\"\n\n\"Wot's that you say about subterranean apartments, Mr. Reeks?\"\ninterposed Ginger. \"Ve ain't a-goin' below, eh?\"\n\nBut without paying any attention to the inquiry, Reeks quitted the room,\nand closed the door carefully after him. He next crossed the hall, and\ncautiously ascending a staircase at the farther end of it, reached the\nlanding-place. Beyond it was a gallery, from which several chambers\nopened.\n\nAdvancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing a slight sound\nin an apartment to the right, he stepped softly towards it, and placing\nhis eye to the keyhole, beheld a tall man, dressed in black, pacing to\nand fro with rapid strides, while three other persons, wrapped in sable\ngowns, and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motionless at\na little distance from him. In the tall man he recognised Cyprian\nRougemont. Upon a table in the middle of the room was laid a large open\nvolume, bound in black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which served to\nillumine the scene.\n\nSuddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over several leaves of the\nbook, which were covered with cabalistic characters, appeared in search\nof some magic formula. Before he could find it, however, a startling\ninterruption occurred. An alarum-bell, fixed against the wall, began to\nring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet flew open, and a\nlarge ape (for such it seemed to Reeks), clothed in a woollen shirt and\ndrawers, sprang forth, and bounding upon the table beside Rougemont,\nplaced its mouth to his ear. The communication thus strangely made\nseemed highly displeasing to Rougemont, who knitted his brows, and\ndelivered some instructions in an undertone to the monkey. The animal\nnodded its head in token of obedience, jumped off the table, and bounded\nback to the cabinet, the doors of which closed as before. Rougemont next\ntook up the lamp, with the evident intention of quitting the room,\nseeing which, Reeks hastily retreated to an adjoining chamber, the door\nof which was fortunately open, and had scarcely gained its shelter when\nthe four mysterious personages appeared on the gallery. Reeks heard\ntheir footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping cautiously\nafter them, watched them across the hall, and pause before the chamber\ncontaining Mr. Thorneycroft and his companions. After a moment's\ndeliberation, Rougemont noiselessly locked the door, took out the key,\nand leaving two of his attendants on guard, returned with the third\ntowards the staircase.\n\nWithout tarrying to confront them, Reeks started back, and hurried along\nthe gallery till he came to a back staircase, which conducted him, by\nvarious descents, to the basement floor, where, after traversing one or\ntwo vaults, he entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead, and\nhaving several openings at the sides, apparently communicating with\nother passages. It was lighted at intervals by lamps, which emitted a\nfeeble radiance.\n\nBy the light of one of these, Reeks discovered the door of a cell. It\nwas of iron, and as he struck it with his hand, returned a hollow\nclangour. On repeating the blow, a hoarse voice from within cried,\n\"Leave me in peace!\"\n\n\"Is it Auriol Darcy who speaks?\" demanded Reeks.\n\n\"It is,\" replied the prisoner. \"Who are you that put the question?\"\n\n\"A friend,\" replied Reeks.\n\n\"I have no friend here,\" said Auriol.\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" rejoined Reeks. \"I have come with Mr. Thorneycroft\nto deliver you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late. He has lost his daughter,\" replied\nAuriol.\n\n\"What has happened to her?\" demanded Reeks.\n\n\"She is in the power of the Fiend,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"I know she is detained by Cyprian Rougemont,\" said Reeks. \"But what has\nbefallen her?\"\n\n\"She has become like his other victims--like _my_ victims!\" cried Auriol\ndistractedly.\n\n\"Do not despair,\" rejoined Reeks. \"She may yet be saved.\"\n\n\"Saved! how?\" cried Auriol. \"All is over.\"\n\n\"So it may seem to you,\" rejoined Reeks; \"but you are the victim of\ndelusion.\"\n\n\"Oh that I could think so!\" exclaimed Auriol. \"But no--I saw her fall\ninto the pit. I beheld her veiled figure rise from it. I witnessed her\nsignature to the fatal scroll. There could be no illusion in what I then\nbeheld.\"\n\n\"Despite all this, you will see her again,\" said Reeks.\n\n\"Who are you who give me this promise?\" asked Auriol.\n\n\"As I have already declared, a friend,\" replied Reeks.\n\n\"Are you human?\"\n\n\"As yourself.\"\n\n\"Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of darkness,\" said\nAuriol.\n\n\"I have no fear of Cyprian Rougemont,\" rejoined Reeks, with a laugh.\n\n\"Your voice seems familiar to me,\" said Auriol. \"Tell me who you are?\"\n\n\"You shall know anon,\" replied Reeks. \"But, hist!--we are interrupted.\nSome one approaches.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE ENCHANTED CHAIRS\n\n\nMore than ten minutes had elapsed since Reeks' departure, and Mr.\nThorneycroft, who had hitherto had some difficulty in repressing his\nanger, now began to give vent to it in muttered threats and complaints.\nHis impatience was shared by the Tinker, who, stepping up to Ginger,\nsaid--\n\n\"Wot the devil can Mr. Reeks be about? I hope nuffin' has happened to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Don't mention a certain gent's name here,\" remarked Ginger; \"or if you\ndo, treat it vith proper respect.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the Tinker impatiently; \"I don't like a man stayin'\navay in this manner. It looks suspicious. I wotes ve goes and sees arter\nhim. Ve can leave the old gent to take a keviet nap by himself. Don't\ndisturb yourself, sir. Ve'll only jist giv' a look about us, and then\ncome back.\"\n\n\"Stay where you are, rascal!\" cried Thorneycroft angrily. \"I won't be\nleft. Stay where you are, I command you!\"\n\n\"Vell, ve've got a noo captain, I'm a-thinkin',\" said the Tinker,\nwinking at the others. \"Ve've no vish to disobleege you, sir. I'll only\njist peep out into the hall, and see if Mr. Reeks is anyvhere\nthereabouts. Vy, zounds!\" he added, as he tried the door, \"it's\nlocked!\"\n\n\"What's locked?\" cried Thorneycroft in dismay.\n\n\"The door, to be sure,\" replied the Tinker. \"Ve're prisoners.\"\n\n\"O Lord, you don't say so!\" cried the iron-merchant in an agony of\nfright. \"What will become of us?\"\n\nA roar of laughter from the others converted his terror into fury.\n\n\"I see how it is,\" he cried. \"You have entrapped me, ruffians. It's all\na trick. You mean to murder me. But I'll sell my life dearly. The first\nwho approaches shall have his brains blown out.\" And as he spoke, he\nlevelled a pistol at the Tinker's head.\n\n\"Holloa! wot are you arter, sir?\" cried that individual, sheltering his\nhead with his hands. \"You're a-labourin' under a mistake--a complete\nmistake. If it is a trap, ve're catched in it as vell as yourself.\"\n\n\"To be sure ve is,\" added the Sandman. \"Sit down, and vait a bit. I\ndessay Mr. Reeks'll come back, and it von't do no good gettin' into a\npassion.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I must resign myself, I suppose,\" groaned Thorneycroft,\nsinking into a chair. \"It's a terrible situation to be placed in--shut\nup in a haunted house.\"\n\n\"I've been in many much vurser sitivations,\" observed Ginger, \"and I\nalvays found the best vay to get out on 'em wos to take things quietly.\"\n\n\"Besides, there's no help for it,\" said the Tinker, seating himself.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" observed the Sandman, taking the chair\nopposite Thorneycroft. \"If Reeks don't come back soon, I'll bust open\nthe door.\"\n\n\"Plenty o' time for that,\" said Ginger, sauntering towards the table on\nwhich the provisions were spread; \"wot do you say to a mouthful o'\nwittles?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't touch 'em for the world,\" replied the Sandman.\n\n\"Nor I,\" added the Tinker; \"they may be pisoned.\"\n\n\"Pisoned--nonsense!\" cried Ginger; \"don't you see some von has been\na-takin' his supper here? I'll jist finish it for him.\"\n\n\"Vith all my 'art,\" said the Tinker.\n\n\"Don't touch it on any account,\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft. \"I agree with\nyour companions, it may be poisoned.\"\n\n\"Oh! I ain't afeerd,\" cried Ginger, helping himself to a dish before\nhim. \"As good a pigeon-pie as ever I tasted. Your health, Mr.\nThorneycroft,\" he added, filling a goblet from one of the bottles. \"My\nservice to you, gents. Famous tipple, by Jove!\" drawing a long breath\nafter the draught, and smacking his lips with amazing satisfaction.\n\"Never tasted sich a glass o' wine in all my born days,\" he continued,\nreplenishing the goblet: \"I wonder wot it's called?\"\n\n\"Prussic acid,\" replied Mr. Thorneycroft gruffly.\n\n\"Proossic fiddlestick!\" cried Ginger; \"more likely Tokay. I shall finish\nthe bottle, and never be the vorse for it!\"\n\n\"He's gettin' svipy,\" said the Tinker. \"I vonder vether it's really\nTokay?\"\n\n\"No such thing,\" cried Thorneycroft; \"let him alone.\"\n\n\"I must taste it,\" said the Tinker, unable to resist the temptation.\n\"Here, give us a glass, Ginger!\"\n\n\"Vith pleasure,\" replied Ginger, filling a goblet to the brim, and\nhanding it to him. \"You'd better be perwailed upon, Sandy.\"\n\n\"Vell, I s'pose I must,\" replied the Sandman, taking the goblet\nproffered him.\n\n\"Here's the beaks' healths!\" cried Ginger. \"I gives that toast 'cos\nthey're alvays so kind to us dog-fanciers.\"\n\n\"Dog-fanciers--say, rather, dog-stealers; for that's the name such\nvagabonds deserve to be known by,\" said Mr. Thorneycroft with some\nasperity.\n\n\"Vell, ve von't quarrel about names,\" replied Ginger, laughing, \"but\nI'll relate a circumstance to you as'll prove that wotever your opinion\nof our wocation may be, the beaks upholds it.\"\n\n\"There can be but one opinion as to your nefarious profession,\" said Mr.\nThorneycroft, \"and that is, that it's as bad as horse-stealing and\nsheep-stealing, and should be punished as those offences are punished.\"\n\n\"So I think, sir,\" said Ginger, winking at the others; \"but to my story,\nand don't interrupt me, or I can't get through vith it properly. There's\na gent livin' not a hundred miles from Pall Mall, as the noospapers\nsays, as had a favourite Scotch terrier, not worth more nor half-a-crown\nto any one but hisself, but highly wallerable to him, 'cos it wos a\nfavourite. Vell, the dog is lost. A pal of mine gets hold on it, and the\ngent soon offers a reward for its recovery. This don't bring it back\nquite so soon as he expects, 'cos he don't offer enough; so he goes to\nan agent, Mr. Simpkins, in the Edger Road, and Mr. Simpkins says to\nhim--says he, 'How are you, sir? I expected you some days ago. You've\ncom'd about that ere Scotch terrier. You've got a wallable greyhound, I\nunderstand. A man told me he'd have that afore long.' Seein' the gent\nstare, Mr. S. adds, 'Vel, I'll tell you wot you must give for your dog.\nThe party von't take less than six guineas. He knows it ain't vorth six\nshillin', but it's a great favourite, and has given him a precious sight\no' trouble in gettin' it.' 'Give _him_ trouble!' cries the gent\nangrily--'and what has it given me? I hope to see the rascal hanged! I\nshall pay no such money.' 'Werry vell,' replies Mr. Simpkins coolly,\n'then your dog'll be bled to death, as the nobleman's wos, and thrown\ndown a breathless carkis afore your door.'\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that such a horrid circumstance as that really\ntook place?\" cried Thorneycroft, who was much interested in the\nrelation.\n\n\"Only t'other day, I assure you,\" replied Ginger.\n\n\"I'd shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so, if I caught him!\"\ncried Mr. Thorneycroft indignantly.\n\n\"And sarve him right, too,\" said Ginger. \"I discourages all cruelty to\nhanimals. But don't interrupt me again. Arter a bit more chafferin' vith\nMr. Simpkins, the gent offers three pound for his dog, and then goes\navay. Next day he reads a report i' the _Times_ noospaper that a man has\nbeen taken up for dog-stealin', and that a lot o' dogs is shut up in the\ngreen-yard behind the police-office in Bow Street. So he goes there in\nsearch o' his favourite, and sure enough he finds it, but the inspector\nvon't give it up to him, 'cos the superintendent is out o' the vay.\"\n\n\"Shameful!\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft.\n\n\"Shameful, indeed, sir,\" echoed Ginger, laughing. \"Thinkin' his dog safe\nenough in the hands o' the police, the gent sleeps soundly that night,\nbut ven he goes back next mornin' he finds it has disappeared. The\ngreen-yard has been broken into overnight, and all the dogs stolen from\nit.\"\n\n\"Under the noses of the police?\" cried Thorneycroft.\n\n\"Under their werry noses,\" replied Ginger. \"But now comes the cream o'\nthe jest. You shall hear wot the beak says to him ven the gent craves\nhis assistance. 'I can't interfere in the matter,' says he, a-bendin' of\nhis brows in a majestic manner. 'Parties don't ought to come here vith\ncomplaints of vhich I can't take notice. This place ain't an advertisin'\noffice, and I sha'n't suffer it to be made von. I von't listen to\nstatements affectin' the characters of absent parties.' Statements\naffectin' _our_ characters,--do you tvig that, sir?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed,\" said Thorneycroft, sighing; \"and I am sorry to think\nsuch a remark should have dropped from the bench.\"\n\n\"You're right to say dropped from it, sir,\" laughed Ginger. \"I told you\nthe beaks vos our best friends; they alvays takes our parts. Ven the\ngent urges that it was a subject of ser'ous importance to all\ndog-owners, the magistrit angrily interrupts him, sayin'--'Then let\nthere be a meetin' of dog-owners to discuss their grievances. Don't come\nto me. I can't help you.' And he vouldn't if he could, 'cos he's the\ndog-fancier's friend.\"\n\n\"It looks like it, I must own,\" replied Thorneycroft. \"Such\nreprehensible indifference gives encouragement to people of your\nprofession. Government itself is to blame. As all persons who keep dogs\npay a tax for them, their property ought to be protected.\"\n\n\"I'm quite satisfied vith the present state of the law,\" said Ginger;\n\"here's the vorthy beak! I'll drink his health a second time.\"\n\n\"Halloa! wot's that?\" cried the Tinker; \"I thought I heerd a noise.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" rejoined the Sandman; \"a strange sort o' rumblin' sound\noverhead.\"\n\n\"There it goes again!\" cried Ginger; \"wot an awful din!\"\n\n\"Now it's underneath,\" said Mr. Thorneycroft, turning pale, and\ntrembling. \"It sounds as if some hidden machinery were at work.\"\n\nThe noise, which up to this moment had borne an indistinct resemblance\nto the creaking of wheels and pulleys, now increased to a violent\nclatter, while the house was shaken as if by the explosion of a mine\nbeneath it.\n\nAt the same time, the occupants of the chairs received a sharp\nelectrical shock, that agitated every limb, and caused Mr. Thorneycroft\nto let fall his pistol, which went off as it reached the ground. At the\nsame time, the Sandman dropped his goblet, and the Tinker relinquished\nhis grasp of the cutlass. Before they could recover from the shock, all\nthree were caught by stout wooden hooks, which, detaching themselves\nfrom the back of the chairs, pinioned their arms, while their legs were\nrestrained by fetters, which sprang from the ground and clasped round\ntheir ankles. Thus fixed, they struggled vainly to get free. The chairs\nseemed nailed to the ground, so that all efforts to move them proved\nfutile.\n\nBut the worst was to come. From the holes in the ceiling already alluded\nto, descended three heavy bell-shaped helmets, fashioned like those worn\nby divers at the bottom of the sea, and having round eyelet-holes of\nglass. It was evident, from the manner of their descent, that these\nhelmets must drop on the heads of the sitters--a conviction that filled\nthem with inexpressible terror. They shouted, and swore frightfully; but\ntheir vociferations availed them nothing. Down came the helmets, and the\nsame moment the monkey, which had been seen by Reeks, issued from a\ncupboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and gibbered at them.\n\nDown came the first helmet, and covered the Tinker to the shoulders. His\nappearance was at once ludicrous and terrible, and his roaring within\nthe casque sounded like the bellowing of a baited bull.\n\nDown came the second helmet, though rather more slowly, and the Sandman\nwas eclipsed in the same manner as the Tinker, and roared as loudly.\n\n[Illustration: The Enchanted Chairs.]\n\nIn both these instances the helmets had dropped without guidance, but in\nthe case of Mr. Thorneycroft, a hand, thrust out of the hole in the\nceiling, held the helmet suspended over his head, like the sword of\nDamocles. While the poor iron-merchant momentarily expected the same\ndoom as his companions, his attention was attracted towards the monkey,\nwhich, clinging with one hand to the side of the cabinet, extended\nthe other skinny arm towards him, and exclaimed--\"Will you swear to go\nhence if you are spared?\"\n\n\"No, I will not,\" replied the iron-merchant. He had scarcely spoken,\nwhen the helmet fell with a jerk, and extinguished him like the others.\n\nGinger alone remained. During the whole of this strange scene, he had\nstood with the bottle in hand, transfixed with terror and astonishment,\nand wholly unable to move or cry out. A climax was put to his fright, by\nthe descent of the three chairs, with their occupants, through the floor\ninto a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up again to the\nceiling, and the trap-doors closed upon the chairs, he dropped the\nbottle, and fell with his face upon the table. He was, however, soon\nroused by a pull at his hair, while a shrill voice called him by his\nname.\n\n\"Who is it?\" groaned the dog-fancier.\n\n\"Look up!\" cried the speaker, again plucking his hair.\n\nGinger complied, and beheld the monkey seated beside him.\n\n\"Vy, it can't be, sure_ly_,\" he cried. \"And yet I could almost svear it\nwas Old Parr.\"\n\n\"You're near the mark,\" replied the other, with a shrill laugh. \"It is\nyour venerable friend.\"\n\n\"Vot the deuce are you doing here, and in this dress, or rayther\nundress?\" inquired Ginger. \"Ven I see you this mornin', you wos in the\nserwice of Mr. Loftus.\"\n\n\"I've got a new master since then,\" replied the dwarf.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear it,\" said Ginger, shaking his head. \"You haven't sold\nyourself, like Doctor Forster--eh?\"\n\n\"Faustus, my dear Ginger--not Forster,\" corrected Old Parr. \"No, no,\nI've made no bargain. And to be plain with you, I've no desire to remain\nlong in my present master's service.\"\n\n\"I don't like to ask the question too directly, wenerable,\" said\nGinger, in a deprecatory tone--\"but is your master--hem!--is\nhe--hem!--the--the----\"\n\n\"The devil, you would say,\" supplied Old Parr. \"Between ourselves, I'm\nafraid there's no denying it.\"\n\n\"La! wot a horrible idea!\" exclaimed Ginger, with a shudder; \"it makes\nthe flesh creep on one's bones. Then we're in your master's power?\"\n\n\"Very like it,\" replied Old Parr.\n\n\"And there ain't no chance o' deliverance?\"\n\n\"None that occurs to me.\"\n\n\"O Lord! O Lord!\" groaned Ginger; \"I'll repent. I'll become a reformed\ncharacter. I'll never steal dogs no more.\"\n\n\"In that case, there may be some chance for you,\" said Old Parr. \"I\nthink I could help you to escape. Come with me, and I'll try and get you\nout.\"\n\n\"But wot is to become of the others?\" demanded Ginger.\n\n\"Oh, leave them to their fate,\" replied Old Parr.\n\n\"No, that'll never do,\" cried Ginger. \"Ve're all in the same boat, and\nmust row out together the best vay ve can. I tell you wot it is,\nwenerable,\" he added, seizing him by the throat--\"your master may be\nthe devil, but you're mortal; and if you don't help me to deliver my\ncompanions, I'll squeege your windpipe for you.\"\n\n\"That's not the way to induce me to help you,\" said Old Parr, twisting\nhimself like an eel out of the other's gripe. \"Now get out, if you can.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry,\" cried Ginger, seeing the mistake he had committed, and\ntrying to conciliate him; \"I only meant to frighten you a bit. Can you\ntell me if Mr. Auriol Darcy is here?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is, and a close prisoner,\" replied Old Parr.\n\n\"And the girl--Miss Ebber, wot of her?\"\n\n\"I can't say,\" rejoined Old Parr. \"I can only speak to the living.\"\n\n\"Then she's dead!\" cried Ginger, with a look of horror.\n\n\"That's a secret,\" replied the dwarf mysteriously; \"and I'm bound by a\nterrible oath not to disclose it.\"\n\n\"I'll have it out of you notvithstandin',\" muttered Ginger. \"I vish you\nwould lend me a knock on the head, old feller. I can't help thinkin'\nI've got a terrible fit o' the nightmare.\"\n\n\"Let this waken you, then,\" said Old Parr, giving him a sound buffet on\nthe ear.\n\n\"Holloa, wenerable! not so hard!\" cried Ginger.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" screamed the dwarf. \"You know what you're about now.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Ginger. \"I vish I wos fairly out o' this cursed\nplace!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have ventured into the lion's den,\" said Old Parr, in a\ntaunting tone. \"But come with me, and perhaps I may be able to do\nsomething towards your liberation.\"\n\nSo saying, he drew aside the tapestry, and opened a panel behind it,\nthrough which he passed, and beckoned Ginger to follow him. Taking a\npistol from his pocket, the latter complied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nGERARD PASTON\n\n\nBefore the chair, in which Mr. Thorneycroft was fixed, reached the\nground, terror had taken away his senses. A bottle of salts, placed to\nhis nose, revived him after a time; but he had nearly relapsed into\ninsensibility on seeing two strange figures, in hideous masks and sable\ncloaks, standing on either side of him, while at a little distance was a\nthird, who carried a strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked round for\nhis companions in misfortune, but, though the chairs were there, they\nwere unoccupied.\n\nThe masked attendants paid no attention to the iron-merchant's cries and\nentreaties; but as soon as they thought him able to move, they touched a\nspring, which freed his arms and legs from their bondage, and raising\nhim, dragged him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage, till they\ncame to a large sepulchral-looking chamber, cased with black marble, in\nthe midst of which, on a velvet fauteuil of the same hue as the walls,\nsat Cyprian Rougemont. It was, in fact, the chamber where Ebba had been\nsubject to her terrible trial.\n\nBewildered with terror, the poor iron-merchant threw himself at the feet\nof Rougemont, who, eyeing him with a look of malignant triumph, cried--\n\n\"You have come to seek your daughter. Behold her!\"\n\nAnd at the words, the large black curtains at the farther end of the\nroom were suddenly withdrawn, and discovered the figure of Ebba\nThorneycroft standing at the foot of the marble staircase. Her features\nwere as pale as death; her limbs rigid and motionless; but her eyes\nblazed with preternatural light. On beholding her, Mr. Thorneycroft\nuttered a loud cry, and, springing to his feet, would have rushed\ntowards her, but he was held back by the two masked attendants, who\nseized each arm, and detained him by main force.\n\n\"Ebba!\" he cried--\"Ebba!\"\n\nBut she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and remained in the\nsame attitude, with her eyes turned away from him.\n\n\"What ails her?\" cried the agonised father. \"Ebba! Ebba!\"\n\n\"Call louder,\" said Rougemont, with a jeering laugh.\n\n\"Do you not know me? do you not hear me?\" shrieked Mr. Thorneycroft.\n\nStill the figure remained immovable.\n\n\"I told you you should see her,\" replied Rougemont, in a taunting tone;\n\"but she is beyond your reach.\"\n\n\"Not so, not so!\" cried Thorneycroft. \"Come to me, Ebba!--come to your\nfather. O Heaven! she hears me not! she heeds me not! Her senses are\ngone.\"\n\n\"She is fast bound by a spell,\" said Rougemont. \"Take a last look of\nher. You will see her no more.\"\n\nAnd, stretching out his hand, the curtains slowly descended, and\nshrouded the figure from view.\n\nThorneycroft groaned aloud.\n\n\"Are you not content?\" cried Rougemont. \"Will you depart in peace, and\nswear never to come here more? If so, I will liberate you and your\ncompanions.\"\n\n\"So far from complying with your request, I swear never to rest till I\nhave rescued my child from you, accursed being!\" cried Thorneycroft\nenergetically.\n\n\"You have sealed your doom, then,\" replied Rougemont. \"But before you\nare yourself immured, you shall see how Auriol Darcy is circumstanced.\nBring him along.\"\n\nAnd, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr. Thorneycroft after him,\nhe plunged into an opening on the right. A few steps brought him to the\nentrance of the cell. Touching the heavy iron door, it instantly swung\nopen, and disclosed Auriol chained to a stone at the farther corner of\nthe narrow chamber.\n\nNot a word was spoken for some minutes, but the captives regarded each\nother piteously.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thorneycroft,\" cried Auriol, at length, \"I beseech you forgive\nme. I have destroyed your daughter.\"\n\n\"You!\" exclaimed the iron-merchant in astonishment.\n\n\"It is true,\" said Rougemont.\n\n\"I would have saved her if it had been possible!\" cried Auriol. \"I\nwarned her that to love me would be fatal to her. I told her I was\nlinked to an inexorable destiny, which would involve her in its\nmeshes--but in vain.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated Thorneycroft.\n\n\"You see you ought to blame him, not me,\" said Rougemont, with a\nderisive laugh.\n\n\"I would have given my life, my soul, to preserve her, had it been\npossible!\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels,\" cried\nThorneycroft. \"Merciless wretch!\" he added, to Rougemont,\n\"fiend--whatever you are, complete your work of ruin by my destruction.\nI have nothing left to tie me to life.\"\n\n\"I would have the miserable live,\" said Rougemont, with a diabolical\nlaugh. \"It is only the happy I seek to destroy. But you have to thank\nyour own obstinacy for your present distress. Bid a lasting farewell to\nAuriol. You will see him no more.\"\n\n\"Hold!\" exclaimed Auriol. \"A word before we part.\"\n\n\"Ay, hold!\" echoed a loud and imperious voice from the depths of the\npassage.\n\n\"Ha!--who speaks?\" demanded Rougemont, a shade passing over his\ncountenance.\n\n\"I, Gerard Paston!\" exclaimed Reeks, stepping forward.\n\nThe crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was seen the handsome\nand resolute features of a man of middle life. He held a pistol in\neither hand.\n\n\"Is it you, Gerard Paston?\" cried Auriol, regarding him; \"the brother of\nClara, my second victim!\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied the other. \"Your deliverance is at hand, Auriol.\"\n\n\"And you have dared to penetrate here, Gerard?\" cried Rougemont,\nstamping the ground with rage. \"Recollect, you are bound to me by the\nsame ties as Auriol, and you shall share his fate.\"\n\n\"I am not to be intimidated by threats,\" replied Paston, with a scornful\nlaugh. \"You have employed your arts too long. Deliver up Auriol and this\ngentleman at once, or----\" And he levelled the pistols at him.\n\n\"Fire!\" cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his towering height. \"No\nearthly bullets can injure me.\"\n\n\"Ve'll try that!\" cried Ginger, coming up at the moment behind Paston.\n\nAnd he discharged a pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the breast of\nRougemont. The latter remained erect, and apparently uninjured.\n\n\"You see how ineffectual your weapons are,\" said Rougemont, with a\nderisive laugh.\n\n\"It must be the devil!\" cried Ginger, running off.\n\n\"I will try mine,\" said Paston.\n\nBut before he could draw the triggers, the pistols were wrested from his\ngrasp by the two attendants, who had quitted Thorneycroft, and stolen\nupon him unperceived, and who next pinioned his arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PIT\n\n\nSo bewildered was the poor iron-merchant by the strange and terrible\nevents that had befallen him, that, though released by the two masked\nattendants, who left him, as before related, to seize Gerard Paston, he\nfelt utterly incapable of exertion, and would probably have made no\neffort to regain his freedom, if his coat had not been vigorously\nplucked behind, while a low voice urged him to fly. Glancing in the\ndirection of the friendly speaker, he could just discern a diminutive\nobject standing within the entrance of a side-passage, and reared up\nagainst the wall so as to be out of sight of Rougemont and his\nattendants. It was the monkey--or rather Old Parr--who, continuing to\ntug violently at his coat, at last succeeded in drawing him backwards\ninto the passage, and then grasping his hand tightly, hurried him along\nit. The passage was wholly unlighted, but Mr. Thorneycroft could\nperceive that it was exceedingly circuitous, and winded round like a\nmaze.\n\n\"Where are you taking me?\" he inquired, attempting to stop.\n\n\"Ask no questions,\" rejoined the dwarf, pulling him along. \"Do you want\nto be captured, and shut up in a cell for the rest of your life?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Thorneycroft, accelerating his movements; \"I\nhope there's no chance of it.\"\n\n\"There's every chance of it,\" rejoined Old Parr. \"If you're taken,\nyou'll share Auriol's fate.\"\n\n\"O Lord! I hope not,\" groaned the iron-merchant. \"I declare, you\nfrighten me so much that you take away all power of movement. I shall\ndrop in a minute.\"\n\n\"Come along, I say,\" screamed the dwarf. \"I hear them close behind us.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, shouts, and the noise of rapidly-approaching footsteps,\nresounded along the passage.\n\n\"I can't stir another step,\" gasped the iron-merchant. \"I'm completely\ndone. Better yield at once.\"\n\n\"What, without a struggle?\" cried the dwarf tauntingly. \"Think of your\ndaughter, and let the thought of her nerve your heart. She is lost for\never, if you don't get out of this accursed place.\"\n\n\"She is lost for ever as it is,\" cried the iron-merchant despairingly.\n\n\"No--she may yet be saved,\" rejoined the dwarf. \"Come on--come on--they\nare close behind us.\"\n\nAnd it was evident, from the increased clamour, that their pursuers were\nupon them.\n\nRoused by the imminence of the danger, and by the hope of rescuing his\ndaughter, Mr. Thorneycroft exerted all his energies, and sprang forward.\nA little farther on, they were stopped by a door. It was closed; and\nventing his disappointment in a scream, the dwarf searched for the\nhandle, but could not find it.\n\n\"We are entrapped--we shall be caught,\" he cried, \"and then woe to both\nof us. Fool that I was to attempt your preservation. Better I had left\nyou to rot in a dungeon than have incurred Rougemont's displeasure.\"\n\nThe iron-merchant replied by a groan.\n\n\"It's all over with me,\" he said. \"I give it up--I'll die here!\"\n\n\"No--we are saved,\" cried the dwarf, as the light, now flashing strongly\nupon the door, revealed a small iron button within it,--\"saved--saved!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he pressed against the button, which moved a spring, and\nthe door flew open. Just as they passed through it, the two masked\nattendants came in sight. The dwarf instantly shut the door, and finding\na bolt on the side next him, shot it into the socket. Scarcely had he\naccomplished this, when the pursuers came up, and dashed themselves\nagainst the door; but finding it bolted, presently ceased their efforts,\nand apparently withdrew.\n\n\"They are gone by some other way to intercept us,\" cried Old Parr, who\nhad paused for a moment to listen; \"come on, Mr. Thorneycroft.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" replied the iron-merchant, with a subdued groan, \"but I'm\ncompletely spent. Oh that I ever ventured into this place!\"\n\n\"It's too late to think of that now; besides, you came here to rescue\nyour daughter,\" rejoined Old Parr. \"Take care and keep near me. I wonder\nwhere this passage leads to?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" inquired the iron-merchant.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" returned the dwarf. \"This is the first time I've\nbeen here--and it shall be the last, if I'm allowed any choice in the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"You haven't told me how you came here at all,\" observed Thorneycroft.\n\n\"I hardly know myself,\" replied the dwarf; \"but I find it more difficult\nto get out than I did to get in. How this passage twists about! I\ndeclare we seem to be returning to the point we started from.\"\n\n\"I think we are turning round ourselves,\" cried Thorneycroft, in an\nagony of fright. \"My head is going. Oh dear! oh dear!\"\n\n\"Why, it does seem very strange, I must say,\" remarked the dwarf, coming\nto a halt. \"I could almost fancy that the solid stone walls were moving\naround us.\"\n\n\"They _are_ moving,\" cried Thorneycroft, stretching out his hand. \"I\nfeel 'em. Lord have mercy upon us, and deliver us from the power of the\nEvil One!\"\n\n\"The place seems on fire,\" cried the dwarf. \"A thick smoke fills the\npassage. Don't you perceive it, Mr. Thorneycroft?\"\n\n\"Don't I!--to be sure I do,\" cried the iron-merchant, coughing and\nsneezing. \"I feel as if I were in a room with a smoky chimney, and no\nwindow open. Oh!--oh!--I'm choking!\"\n\n\"Don't mind it,\" cried the dwarf, who seemed quite at his ease. \"We\nshall soon be out of the smoke.\"\n\n\"I can't stand it,\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft; \"I shall die. Oh!\npoah--pish--puff!\"\n\n\"Come on, I tell you--you'll get some fresh air in a minute,\" rejoined\nOld Parr. \"Halloa! how's this? No outlet. We're come to a dead stop.\"\n\n\"Dead stop, indeed!\" echoed the iron-merchant. \"We've come to that long\nago. But what new difficulty has arisen?\"\n\n\"Merely that the road's blocked up by a solid wall--that's all,\" replied\nOld Parr.\n\n\"Blocked up!\" exclaimed Thorneycroft. \"Then we're entombed alive.\"\n\n\"_I_ am,\" said the dwarf, with affected nonchalance. \"As to you, you've\nthe comfort of knowing it'll soon be over with you. But for me, nothing\ncan harm me.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that,\" cried a voice above them.\n\n\"Did you speak, Mr. Thorneycroft?\" asked the dwarf.\n\n\"N-o-o--not I,\" gasped the iron-merchant. \"I'm suffocating--help to drag\nme out.\"\n\n\"Get out if you can,\" cried the voice that had just spoken.\n\n\"It's Rougemont himself,\" cried the dwarf in alarm. \"Then there's no\nescape.\"\n\n\"None whatever, rascal,\" replied the unseen speaker. \"I want you. I have\nmore work for you to do.\"\n\n\"I won't leave Mr. Thorneycroft,\" cried the dwarf resolutely. \"I've\npromised to preserve him, and I'll keep my word.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" cried the other. \"You must obey when I command.\"\n\nAnd as the words were uttered, a hand was thrust down from above, which,\ngrasping the dwarf by the nape of the neck, drew him upwards.\n\n\"Lay hold of me, Mr. Thorneycroft,\" screamed Old Parr. \"I'm going up\nagain--lay hold of me--pull me down.\"\n\nWell-nigh stifled by the thickening and pungent vapour, the poor\niron-merchant found compliance impossible. Before he could reach the\ndwarf, the little fellow was carried off. Left to himself, Mr.\nThorneycroft staggered along the passage, expecting every moment to\ndrop, until at length a current of fresh air blew in his face, and\nenabled him to breathe more freely. Somewhat revived, he went on, but\nwith great deliberation, and it was well he did so, for he suddenly\narrived at the brink of a pit about eight feet in depth, into which, if\nhe had approached it incautiously, he must infallibly have stumbled, and\nin all probability have broken his neck. This pit evidently communicated\nwith a lower range of chambers, as was shown by a brazen lamp burning\nunder an archway. A ladder was planted at one side, and by this Mr.\nThorneycroft descended, but scarcely had he set foot on the ground, than\nhe felt himself rudely grasped by a man who stepped from under the\narchway. The next moment, however, he was released, while the familiar\nvoice of the Tinker exclaimed--\n\n\"Vy, bless my 'art, if it ain't Mister Thorneycroft.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's me, certainly, Mr. Tinker,\" replied the iron-merchant. \"Who's\nthat you've got with you?\"\n\n\"Vy, who should it be but the Sandman,\" rejoined the other gruffly.\n\"Ve've set ourselves free at last, and have made some nice diskiveries\ninto the bargin.\"\n\n\"Yes, ve've found it all out,\" added the Tinker.\n\n\"What have you discovered--what have you found out?\" cried the\niron-merchant breathlessly. \"Have you found my daughter? Where is she?\nTake me to her.\"\n\n\"Not so fast, old gent, not so fast,\" rejoined the Tinker. \"Ve ain't\nsure as 'ow ve've found your darter, but ve've catched a peep of a nice\nyoung 'ooman.\"\n\n\"Oh! it must be her--no doubt of it,\" cried the iron-merchant. \"Where is\nshe? Take me to her without a moment's delay.\"\n\n\"But ve can't get to her, I tell 'ee,\" replied the Tinker. \"Ve knows the\nplace vere she's a-shut up,--that's all.\"\n\n\"Take me to it,\" cried Mr. Thorneycroft eagerly.\n\n\"Vell, if you must go, step this vay, then,\" rejoined the Tinker,\nproceeding towards the archway. \"Halloa, Sandy, did you shut the door\narter you?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" replied the other; \"open it.\"\n\n\"Easily said,\" rejoined the Tinker, \"but not quevite so easily done. Vy,\nzounds, it's shut of itself and bolted itself on t'other side!\"\n\n\"Some one must have followed you,\" groaned Thorneycroft. \"We're watched\non all sides.\"\n\n\"Ay, and from above, too,\" cried the Sandman. \"Look up there!\" he added,\nin accents of alarm.\n\n\"What's the matter? What new danger is at hand?\" inquired the\niron-merchant.\n\n\"Look up, I say,\" cried the Sandman. \"Don't ye see, Tinker?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I see,\" replied the other. \"The roof's a-comin' in upon us.\nLet's get out o' this as fast as ve can.\" And he kicked and pushed\nagainst the door, but all his efforts were unavailing to burst it open.\n\nAt the same time the Sandman rushed towards the ladder, but before he\ncould mount it all egress by that means was cut off. An immense iron\ncover worked in a groove was pushed by some unseen machinery over the\ntop of the pit, and enclosed them in it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNEW PERPLEXITIES\n\n\nFor several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent medicaments, had\nbound up the senses of Auriol. On awaking, he found himself within a\ncell, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling of which were of solid stone\nmasonry. In the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous\nroof, stood a massive granite pillar, the capital of which was\ngrotesquely ornamented with death's-heads and cross-bones, and against\nthis pillar leaned Auriol, with his left arm chained by heavy links of\niron to a ring in the adjoining wall. Beside him stood a pitcher of\nwater, and near him lay an antique-looking book, bound in black vellum.\nThe dungeon in which he was confined was circular in form, with a coved\nroof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned, and was approached by a\nsteep flight of steps rising from a doorway, placed some six feet below\nthe level of the chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of\nlight, descending from a narrow aperture in the roof, fell upon his\nwasted and haggard features. His dark-brown hair hung about his face in\nelf-locks, his beard was untrimmed, and a fixed and stony glare like\nthat of insanity sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground--neither\nbench nor stool being allowed him--with his hand supporting his chin.\nHis gaze was fixed upon vacancy--if that can he called vacancy which to\nhim was filled with vivid images. His garb was not that of modern times,\nbut consisted of a doublet and hose of rich material, wrought in the\nfashion of Elizabeth's days.\n\nAfter remaining for some time in this musing attitude, Auriol opened the\nold tome before him, and began to turn over its leaves. It was full of\nmagical disquisitions and mysterious characters, and he found inscribed\non one of its earlier pages a name which instantly riveted his\nattention. Having vainly sought some explanation of this name in the\nafter contents of the book, he laid it aside, and became lost in\nmeditation. His reverie ended, he heaved a deep sigh, and turned again\nto the open volume lying before him, and in doing so his eye rested for\nthe first time on his habiliments. On beholding them he started, and\nheld out his arm to examine his sleeve more narrowly. Satisfied that he\nwas not deceived, he arose and examined himself from head to foot. He\nfound himself, as has been stated, attired in the garb of a gentleman of\nElizabeth's time.\n\n\"What can this mean?\" he cried. \"Have I endured a long and troubled\ndream, during which I have fancied myself living through more than two\ncenturies? O Heaven, that it may be so! Oh that the fearful crimes I\nsuppose I have committed have only been enacted in a dream! Oh that my\nvictims are imaginary! Oh that Ebba should only prove a lovely phantom\nof the night! And yet, I could almost wish the rest were real--so that\nshe might exist. I cannot bear to think that she is nothing more than a\nvision. But it must be so--I have been dreaming--and what a dream it has\nbeen!--what strange glimpses it has afforded me into futurity! Methought\nI lived in the reigns of many sovereigns--beheld one of them carried to\nthe block--saw revolutions convulse the kingdom--old dynasties shaken\ndown, and new ones spring up. Fashions seem to me to have so changed,\nthat I had clean forgotten the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely\nappeared the same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself? Is this the\ndress I once wore? Let me seek for some proof.\"\n\nAnd thrusting his hand into his doublet, he drew forth some tablets, and\nhastily examined them. They bore his name, and contained some writing,\nand he exclaimed aloud with joy, \"This is proof enough--I have been\ndreaming all this while.\"\n\n\"The scheme works to a miracle,\" muttered a personage stationed at the\nfoot of the steps springing from the doorway, and who, though concealed\nfrom view himself, was watching the prisoner with a malignant and\nexulting gaze.\n\n\"And yet, why am I here?\" pursued Auriol, looking around. \"Ah! I see how\nit is,\" he added, with a shudder; \"I have been mad--perhaps am mad\nstill. That will account for the strange delusion under which I have\nlaboured.\"\n\n\"I will act upon that hint,\" muttered the listener.\n\n\"Of what use is memory,\" continued Auriol musingly, \"if things that are\nnot, seem as if they were? If joys and sorrows which we have never\nendured are stamped upon the brain--if visions of scenes, and faces and\nevents which we have never witnessed, never known, haunt us, as if they\nhad once been familiar? But I am mad--mad!\"\n\nThe listener laughed to himself.\n\n\"How else, if I were not mad, could I have believed that I had swallowed\nthe fabled elixir vit\u00c3\u00a6? And yet, is it a fable? for I am puzzled still.\nMethinks I am old--old--old--though I feel young, and look young. All\nthis is madness. Yet how clear and distinct it seems! I can call to mind\nevents in Charles the Second's time. Ha!--who told me of Charles the\nSecond? How know I there was such a king? The reigning sovereign should\nbe James, and yet I fancy it is George the Fourth. Oh! I am mad--clean\nmad!\"\n\nThere was another pause, during which the listener indulged in a\nsuppressed fit of laughter.\n\n\"Would I could look forth from this dungeon,\" pursued Auriol, again\nbreaking silence, \"and satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of my\ndoubts by a view of the external world, for I am so perplexed in mind,\nthat if I were not distracted already, they would be enough to drive me\nso. What dismal, terrible fancies have possessed me, and weigh upon me\nstill--the compact with Rougemont--ha!\"\n\n\"Now it comes,\" cried the listener.\n\n\"Oh, that I could shake off the conviction that this were not so--that\nmy soul, though heavily laden, might still be saved! Oh, that I dared to\nhope this!\"\n\n\"I must interrupt him if he pursues this strain,\" said the listener.\n\n[Illustration: Rougemont's device to perplex Auriol.]\n\n\"Whether my crimes are real or imaginary--whether I snatched the cup of\nimmortality from my grandsire's dying lips--whether I signed a compact\nwith the Fiend, and delivered him a victim on each tenth year--I cannot\nnow know; but if it is so, I deeply, bitterly regret them, and would\nexpiate my offences by a life of penance.\"\n\nAt this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to that of the\nprisoner, marched up the steps, and cried, \"What ho, Auriol!--Auriol\nDarcy!\"\n\n\"Who speaks?\" demanded Auriol. \"Ah! is it you, Fiend?\"\n\n\"What, you are still in your old fancies,\" rejoined Rougemont. \"I\nthought the draught I gave you last night would have amended you.\"\n\n\"Tell me who and what I am,\" cried Auriol, stupefied with astonishment;\n\"in what age I am living; and whether I am in my right mind or not?\"\n\n\"For the first, you are called Auriol Darcy,\" replied Rougemont; \"for\nthe second, you are living in the reign of his most Catholic Majesty\nJames I. of England, and Sixth of Scotland; and for the third, I trust\nyou will soon recover your reason.\"\n\n\"Amazement!\" cried Auriol, striking his brow with his clenched hand.\n\"Then I _am_ mad.\"\n\n\"It's plain your reason is returning, since you are conscious of your\ncondition,\" replied Rougemont; \"but calm yourself, you have been subject\nto raging frenzies.\"\n\n\"And I have been shut up here for safety?\" demanded Auriol.\n\n\"Precisely,\" observed the other.\n\n\"And you are----\"\n\n\"Your keeper,\" replied Rougemont.\n\n\"My God! what a brain mine must be!\" cried Auriol. \"Answer me one\nquestion--Is there such a person as Ebba Thorneycroft?\"\n\n\"You have often raved about her,\" replied Rougemont. \"But she is a mere\ncreature of the imagination.\"\n\nAuriol groaned, and sank against the wall.\n\n\"Since you have become so reasonable, you shall again go forth into the\nworld,\" said Rougemont; \"but the first essay must be made at night, for\nfear of attracting observation. I will come to you again a few hours\nhence. Farewell for the present.\"\n\nAnd casting a sinister glance at his captive, he turned upon his heel,\ndescended the steps, and quitted the cell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDOCTOR LAMB AGAIN\n\n\nNight came, and the cell grew profoundly dark. Auriol became impatient\nfor the appearance of his keeper, but hour after hour passed and he did\nnot arrive. Worn out, at length, with doubt and bewildering\nspeculations, the miserable captive was beset with the desire to put an\nend to his torments by suicide, and he determined to execute his fell\npurpose without delay. An evil chance seemed also to befriend him, for\nscarcely was the idea formed, than his foot encountered something on the\nground, the rattling of which attracted his attention, and stooping to\ntake it up, he grasped the bare blade of a knife.\n\n\"This will, at all events, solve my doubts,\" he cried aloud. \"I will\nsheathe this weapon in my heart, and, if I am mortal, my woes will be\nended.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he placed the point to his breast with the full intent to\nstrike, but before he could inflict the slightest wound, his arm was\nforcibly arrested.\n\n\"Would you destroy yourself, madman?\" roared a voice. \"I thought your\nviolence was abated, and that you might go forth in safety. But I find\nyou are worse than ever.\"\n\nAuriol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground. The\nnew-comer kicked it to a distance with his foot.\n\n\"You shall be removed to another chamber,\" he pursued, \"where you can be\nmore strictly watched.\"\n\n\"Take me forth--oh! take me forth,\" cried Auriol. \"It was a mere impulse\nof desperation, which I now repent.\"\n\n\"I dare not trust you. You will commit some act of insane fury, for\nwhich I myself shall have to bear the blame. When I yielded to your\nentreaties on a former occasion, and took you forth, I narrowly\nprevented you from doing all we met a mischief.\"\n\n\"I have no recollection of any such circumstance,\" returned Auriol\nmournfully. \"But it may be true, nevertheless. And if so, it only proves\nthe lamentable condition to which I am reduced--memory and reason gone!\"\n\n\"Ay, both gone,\" cried the other, with an irrepressible chuckle.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Auriol, starting. \"I am not so mad but I recognise in\nyou the Evil Being who tempted me. I am not so oblivious as to forget\nour terrible interviews.\"\n\n\"What, you are in your lunes again!\" cried Rougemont fiercely. \"Nay,\nthen I must call my assistants, and bind you.\"\n\n\"Let me be--let me be!\" implored Auriol, \"and I will offend you no more.\nWhatever thoughts may arise within me, I will not give utterance to\nthem. Only take me forth.\"\n\n\"I came for that purpose,\" said Rougemont; \"but I repeat, I dare not.\nYou are not sufficiently master of yourself.\"\n\n\"Try me,\" said Auriol.\n\n\"Well,\" rejoined the other, \"I will see what I can do to calm you.\"\n\nSo saying, he disappeared for a few moments, and then returning with a\ntorch, placed it on the ground, and producing a phial, handed it to the\ncaptive.\n\n\"Drink!\" he said.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation Auriol complied.\n\n\"It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing potion,\" he remarked,\nafter emptying the phial.\n\n\"You are in no condition to judge,\" rejoined the other.\n\nAnd he proceeded to unfasten Auriol's chain.\n\n\"Now then, come with me,\" he said, \"and do not make any attempt at\nevasion, or you will rue it.\"\n\nLike one in a dream, Auriol followed his conductor down the flight of\nstone steps leading from the dungeon, and along a narrow passage. As he\nproceeded, he thought he heard stealthy footsteps behind him; but he\nnever turned his head, to see whether he was really followed. In this\nway they reached a short steep staircase, and mounting it, entered a\nvault, in which Rougemont paused, and placed the torch he had brought\nwith him upon the floor. Its lurid glimmer partially illumined the\nchamber, and showed that it was built of stone. Rude benches of antique\nform were set about the vault, and motioning Auriol to be seated upon\none of them, Rougemont sounded a silver whistle. The summons was shortly\nafterwards answered by the dwarf, in whose attire a new change had\ntaken place. He was now clothed in a jerkin of grey serge, fashioned\nlike the garments worn by the common people in Elizabeth's reign, and\nwore a trencher-cap on his head. Auriol watched him as he timidly\nadvanced towards Rougemont, and had an indistinct recollection of having\nseen him before; but could not call to mind how or where.\n\n\"Is your master a-bed?\" demanded Rougemont.\n\n\"A-bed! Good lack, sir!\" exclaimed the dwarf, \"little of sleep knows\nDoctor Lamb. He will toil at the furnace till the stars have set.\"\n\n\"Doctor Lamb!\" repeated Auriol. \"Surely I have heard that name before?\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied Rougemont, \"for it is the name borne by your\nnearest kinsman.\"\n\n\"How is the poor young gentleman?\" asked the dwarf, glancing\ncommiseratingly at Auriol. \"My master often makes inquiries after his\ngrandson, and grieves that the state of his mind should render it\nnecessary to confine him.\"\n\n\"His grandson! I--Doctor Lamb's grandson!\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"In sooth are you, young sir,\" returned the dwarf. \"Were you in your\nreason, you would be aware that my master's name is the same as your\nown--Darcy--Reginald Darcy. He assumes the name of Doctor Lamb to delude\nthe multitude. He told you as much yourself, sweet sir, if your poor\nwits would enable you to recollect it.\"\n\n\"Am I in a dream, good fellow, tell me that?\" cried Auriol, lost in\namazement.\n\n\"Alack, no, sir,\" replied the dwarf; \"to my thinking, you are wide\nawake. But you know, sir,\" he added, touching his forehead, \"you have\nbeen a little wrong here, and your memory and reason are not of the\nclearest.\"\n\n\"Where does my grandsire dwell?\" asked Auriol.\n\n\"Why here, sir,\" replied the dwarf; \"and for the matter of locality, the\nhouse is situated on the south end of London Bridge.\"\n\n\"_On_ the bridge--did you say _on_ the bridge, friend?\" cried Auriol.\n\n\"Ay, _on_ the bridge--where else should it be? You would not have your\ngrandsire live under the river?\" rejoined the dwarf; \"though, for ought\nI know, some of these vaults may go under it. They are damp enough.\"\n\nAuriol was lost in reflection, and did not observe a sign that passed\nbetween the dwarf and Rougemont.\n\n\"Will it disturb Doctor Lamb if his grandson goes up to him?\" said the\nlatter, after a brief pause.\n\n\"My master does not like to be interrupted in his operations, as you\nknow, sir,\" replied the dwarf, \"and seldom suffers any one, except\nmyself, to enter his laboratory; but I will make so bold as to introduce\nMaster Auriol, if he desires it.\"\n\n\"You will confer the greatest favour on me by doing so,\" cried Auriol,\nrising.\n\n\"Sit down--sit down!\" said Rougemont authoritatively. \"You cannot go up\ntill the doctor has been apprised. Remain here, while Flapdragon and I\nascertain his wishes.\" So saying, he quitted the chamber by a farther\noutlet with the dwarf.\n\nDuring the short time that Auriol was left alone, he found it vain to\nattempt to settle his thoughts, or to convince himself that he was not\nlabouring under some strange delusion.\n\nHe was aroused at length by the dwarf, who returned alone.\n\n\"Your grandsire will see you,\" said the mannikin.\n\n\"One word before we go,\" cried Auriol, seizing his arm.\n\n\"Saints! how you frighten me!\" exclaimed the dwarf. \"You must keep\ncomposed, or I dare not take you to my master.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Auriol; \"I meant not to alarm you. Where is the\nperson who brought me hither?\"\n\n\"What, your keeper?\" said the dwarf. \"Oh, he is within call. He will\ncome to you anon. Now follow me.\"\n\nAnd taking up the torch, he led the way out of the chamber. Mounting a\nspiral staircase, apparently within a turret, they came to a door, which\nbeing opened by Flapdragon, disclosed a scene that well-nigh stupefied\nAuriol.\n\nIt was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it above two centuries\nago. The floor was strewn with alchemical implements--the table was\ncovered with mystic parchments inscribed with cabalistic characters--the\nfurnace stood in the corner--crucibles and cucurbites decorated the\nchimney-board--the sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceiling--the\nskeletons grinned from behind the chimney-corner--all was there as he\nhad seen it before! There also was Doctor Lamb, in his loose gown of\nsable silk, with a square black cap upon his venerable head, and his\nsnowy beard streaming to his girdle.\n\nThe old man's gaze was fixed upon a crucible placed upon the furnace,\nand he was occupied in working the bellows. He moved his head as Auriol\nentered the chamber, and the features became visible. It was a face\nnever to be forgotten.\n\n\"Come in, grandson,\" said the old man kindly. \"Come in, and close the\ndoor after you. The draught affects the furnace--my Athanor, as we\nadepts term it. So you are better, your keeper tells me--much better.\"\n\n\"Are you indeed living?\" cried Auriol, rushing wildly towards him, and\nattempting to take his hand.\n\n\"Off--off!\" cried the old man, drawing back as if alarmed. \"You disturb\nmy operations. Keep him calm, Flapdragon, or take him hence. He may do\nme a mischief.\"\n\n\"I have no such intention, sir,\" said Auriol; \"indeed I have not. I only\nwish to be assured that you are my aged relative.\"\n\n\"To be sure he is, young sir,\" interposed the dwarf. \"Why should you\ndoubt it?\"\n\n\"O sir,\" cried Auriol, throwing himself at the old man's feet, \"pity me\nif I am mad; but offer me some explanation, which may tend to restore me\nto my senses. My reason seems gone, yet I appear capable of receiving\nimpressions from external objects. I see you, and appear to know you. I\nsee this chamber--these alchemical implements--that furnace--these\ndifferent objects--and I appear to recognise them. Am I deceived, or is\nthis real?\"\n\n\"You are not deceived, my son,\" replied the old man. \"You have been in\nthis room before, and you have seen me before. It would be useless to\nexplain to you now how you have suffered from fever, and what visions\nyour delirium has produced. When you are perfectly restored, we will\ntalk the matter over.\"\n\nAnd, as he said this, he began to blow the fire anew, and watched with\ngreat apparent interest the changing colours of the liquid in the\ncucurbite placed on the furnace.\n\nAuriol looked at him earnestly, but could not catch another glance, so\nintently was the old man occupied. At length he ventured to break the\nsilence.\n\n\"I should feel perfectly convinced, if I might look forth from that\nwindow,\" he said.\n\n\"Convinced of what?\" rejoined the old man somewhat sharply.\n\n\"That I am what I seem,\" replied Auriol.\n\n\"Look forth, then,\" said the old man. \"But do not disturb me by idle\ntalk. There is the rosy colour in the projection for which I have been\nso long waiting.\"\n\nAuriol then walked to the window and gazed through the tinted panes. It\nwas very dark, and objects could only be imperfectly distinguished.\nStill he fancied he could detect the gleam of the river beneath him, and\nwhat seemed a long line of houses on the bridge. He also fancied he\ndiscerned other buildings, with the high roofs, the gables, and the\nother architectural peculiarities of the structures of Elizabeth's\ntime. He persuaded himself, also, that he could distinguish through the\ngloom the venerable Gothic pile of Saint Paul's Cathedral on the other\nside of the water, and, as if to satisfy him that he was right, a deep\nsolemn bell tolled forth the hour of two. After a while he returned from\nthe window, and said to his supposed grandsire, \"I am satisfied. I have\nlived centuries in a few nights.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD LONDON MERCHANT\n\n_A SKETCH_\n\nFlos Mercatorum.--_Epitaph on Whittington_\n\n\nAt that festive season, when the days are at the shortest, and the\nnights at the longest, and when, consequently, it is the invariable\npractice of all sensible people to turn night into day; when the state\nof the odds between business and pleasure is decidedly in favour of the\nlatter; when high carnival is held in London, and everything betokens\nthe prevalence and influence of good cheer; when pastrycooks are in\ntheir glory, and green trays in requisition; when porters groan beneath\nhampers of game, and huge tubs of Canterbury brawn; when trains arriving\nfrom the eastern counties are heavy laden with turkeys and hares; when\nagents in town send barrels of oysters to correspondents in the country;\nwhen Christmas-box claimants disturb one's equanimity by day, and Waits\n(those licensed nuisances, to which even our reverence for good old\ncustoms cannot reconcile us) break one's first slumber at night; when\nsurly Christians \"awake,\" and salute the band of little carollers with\njugs of cold water; when their opposite neighbour, who has poked his\nnightcapped head from his window, retires with a satisfactory chuckle;\nwhen the meat at Mr. Giblett's in Bond Street, which, for the last six\nweeks, has announced the approach of Christmas by its daily-increasing\nlayers of fat, as correctly as the almanack, has reached the\nne-plus-ultra of adiposity; when wondering crowds are collected before\nthe aforesaid Giblett's to gaze upon the yellow carcass of that\nleviathan prize ox--the fat being rendered more intensely yellow by its\ncontrast with the green holly with which it is garnished--as well as to\nadmire the snowy cakes of suet with which the sides of that\nLeicestershire sheep are loaded; when the grocer's trade is \"in\nrequest,\" and nothing is heard upon his counter but the jingling of\nscales and the snapping of twine; when the vendor of sweetmeats, as he\ndeals forth his citron and sultanas in the due minced-meat proportions\nto that pretty housemaid, whispers something in a soft and sugared tone\nabout the misletoe; when \"coming Twelfth Nights cast their shadows\nbefore,\" and Mr. Gunter feels doubly important; when pantomimes are\nabout to unfold all their magic charms, and the holidays have fairly\ncommenced; when the meteorological prophet predicts that Thursday the\n1st will be fair and frosty, and it turns out to be drizzling rain and a\nsudden thaw; when intelligence is brought that the ice \"bears,\" the\nintelligence being confirmed by the appearance of sundry donkey-carts,\ncontaining ice an inch thick, and rendered indisputable by the discharge\nof their crystal loads upon the pavement before Mr. Grove's, the\nfishmonger's; when crack performers in paletots, or Mackintoshes, with\nskates in their hands, cigars in their mouths, and tights and\nfur-topped boots on their lower limbs, are seen hastening up Baker\nStreet in the direction of the Regent's Park; when a marquee is pitched\nupon the banks of the Serpentine, and a quadrille executed by the\nbefore-mentioned crack skaters in tights and fur-topped boots upon its\nfrozen waters; when the functionaries of the Humane Society begin to\nfind some employment for their ropes and punt; when Old Father Thames,\nwho, for a couple of months, appears to have been undecided about the\ncolours of his livery--now inclining to a cloak of greyish dun, now to a\nmantle of orange tawny--has finally adopted a white transparent robe\nwith facings of silver; when, as you pass down Harley Street, the lights\nin the drawing-room windows of every third house, the shadows on the\nblinds, and, above all, the enlivening sound of the harp and piano,\nsatisfy you that its fair inmate is \"at home\"; when\n\n    House-quakes, street-thunders, and door-batteries\n\nare heard from \"midnight until morn\"; when the knocker at No. 22 Park\nStreet responds to the knocker at No. 25; when a barrel-organ and a\npopular melody salute your ear as you enter Oxford Street; when the\ndoors of the gin-palaces seem to be always opening to let people _in_,\nbut never to let them _out_, and the roar of boisterous revelry is heard\nfrom the bar; when various vociferations arise from various courts and\npassages; when policemen are less on the alert, though their\ninterference is more requisite than usual; when uproarious jollity\nprevails; when \"universal London getteth drunk\"; and, in short, when\nChristmas is come, and everybody is disposed to enjoy himself in his\nown way. At this period of wassail and rejoicing it was that a social\nparty, to which I am now about to introduce the reader, was assembled in\na snug little dining-room of a snug little house, situated in that snug\nlittle pile of building denominated the Sanctuary in Westminster.\n\nWhen a man has any peculiarity of character, his house is sure to\npartake of it. The room which he constantly inhabits reflects his image\nas faithfully as a mirror; nay, more so, for it reflects his mind as\nwell as his person. A glance at No. 22 St. James's Place would satisfy\nyou its owner was a poet. We can judge of the human, as of the brute\nlion, by the aspect of his den. The room marks the man. Visit it in his\nabsence, and you may paint his portrait better than the limner who has\nplaced his \"breathing canvas\" on the walls. From that well-worn\nelbow-chair and the slippers at its feet (the slippers of an old man are\nnever to be mistaken), you can compute his age; from that faded brocade\ndressing-gown and green velvet cap, you can shape out his figure; from\nthe multiplicity of looking-glasses you at once infer that he has not\nentirely lost his vanity or his good looks; that gold-headed cane gives\nyou his carriage--it is not a crutch-handled stick, but a cane to\nflourish jauntily; that shagreen spectacle-case, that chased silver\nsnuffbox with the Jupiter and Leda richly and somewhat luxuriously\nwrought upon its lid, that fine S\u00c3\u00a8vres porcelain, that gorgeous\nBerlin-ware, those rare bronzes half consumed by the true hoary green\n\u00c3\u00a6rugo, those little Egyptian images, that lachrymatory, that cinerary\nurn, that brick from the Colosseum, that tesselated pavement from\nPompeii, looking like a heap of various-coloured dice, and a world of\nother rarities, furnish unerring indications of his tastes and habits,\nand proclaim him a member of the Arch\u00c3\u00a6ological Society; while that open\nvolume of Sir Thomas Urquhart's \"Rabelais\" (published by the Abbotsford\nClub) gives you his course of study; the _Morning Post_ his politics;\nthat flute and those musical notes attest the state of his lungs; and\nthat well-blotted copy of verses, of which the ink is scarcely dry,\nproclaims his train of thought. The door opens, and an old gentleman\nenters exactly corresponding to your preconceived notions. You require\nno introduction. You have made his acquaintance half-an-hour ago.\n\nThe apartment to which we are about to repair was a complete index to\nthe mind and character of its possessor, Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have\ncalled it a dining-room, from its ordinary application to the purposes\nof refection and festivity; but it had much more the air of a library,\nor study. It was a small comfortable chamber, just large enough to\ncontain half-a-dozen people, though by management double that number had\nbeen occasionally squeezed into its narrow limits. The walls were\ndecorated with curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black\nworm-eaten frames, and representing divers personages, places, and\nstructures connected with London and its history.\n\nOver the mantelpiece was stretched Vertue's copy of Ralph Aggas's famous\nsurvey of our \"great metropolis,\" made about the beginning of\nElizabeth's reign, or perhaps a little earlier, when it was scarcely so\ngreat a metropolis as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen\nof the press, cabmen, omnibus cads, and other illustrious personages\nwere unborn and undreamed of; when St. Giles's, in lieu of its\nmysterious and D\u00c3\u00a6dalian Seven Dials (which should have for their motto\nWordsworth's title, \"We are Seven\"), consisted of a little cluster of\ncountry houses, surrounded by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall\ngirded in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of\nstaghounds was kept in Finsbury Fields, and archers and cross-bowmen\nhaunted the purlieus of the Spital; when he who strolled westward from\nCharing Cross (then no misnomer) beheld neither Opera House nor\nclub-house, but a rustic lane, with a barn at one end, and a goodly\nassortment of hay-carts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames was\ncrossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like a street, and\nthe street itself like a row of palaces. On the right of this plan hung\na sketch of Will Somers, jester to Henry VIII., after the picture by\nHolbein; on the left an engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive\nattendant of Henrietta Maria. This niche was devoted to portraits of the\nbluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that to the melancholy\nCharles and his family. Here, the Great Fire of 1666, with its black\nprofiles of houses, relieved by a sheet of \"bloody and malicious\" flame,\nformed a pleasant contrast to the icy wonders of the Frost Fair, held on\nthe Thames in 1684, when carriages were driven through the lines of\ntents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the infinite delectation\nof the citizens. There Old Saint Paul's (in the words of Victor Hugo,\n\"one of those Gothic monuments so admirable and so irreparable\"), and\nwhich is but ill replaced by the modern \"bastard counterpart\" of the\nglorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable tower (not\ndome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St. Paul's came the reverend\nAbbey of Westminster, taken before it had been disfigured by the towers\nadded by Wren; and next to the abbey opened the long and raftered vista\nof its magnificent neighbouring hall. Several plans and prospects of the\nTower of London, as it appeared at different epochs, occupied a corner\nto themselves: then came a long array of taverns, from the Tabard in\nSouthwark, the Boar's Head in Eastcheap, and the Devil near Temple Bar,\nembalmed in the odour of poesy, to the Nag's Head in Cheapside,\nnotorious for its legend of the consecration of the Protestant bishops\nin 1559; there also might you see--\n\n              ----in Billinsgate the Salutation.\n    And the Boar's Head near London Stone,\n    The Swan at Dowgate, a tavern well known;\n    The Mitre in Cheap, and then the Bull's Head,\n    And many like places that make noses red;\n    The Boar's Head in Old Fish Street; Three Crowns in the Vintry;\n    And, now, of late, Saint Martin's in the Seutree;\n    The Windmill in Lothbury; the Ship at th' Exchange;\n    King's Head in New Fish Street, where roysters do range;\n    The Mermaid in Cornhill; Red Lion in the Strand;\n    Three Tuns in Newgate Market; in Old Fish Street the Swan.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: News from Bartholomew Faire.]\n\nAdjoining these places of entertainment were others of a different\ndescription, to wit, the Globe, as it stood when Shakspeare (how\ninsufferable is Mr. Knight's orthography of this reverend\nname--Shaks_pere_!) trod the stage; the king's play-house in Charles\nthe Second's time; the Bear Garden, with its flag streaming to the wind;\nand the Folly, as it once floated in the river, opposite old Somerset\nHouse. Then came the Halls, beginning with Guildhall and ending with Old\nSkinner's. Next, the Crosses, from Paul's to Charing; then, the\nchurches, gateways, hospitals, colleges, prisons, asylums, inns of\ncourt,--in short, for it is needless to particularise further, London\nand its thousand recollections rose before you, as you gazed around.\nScarcely an old edifice, to which an historical tradition could be\nattached (and what old London edifice is destitute of such traditions?),\nwas wanting. Nor were the great of old--the spirits, who gave interest\nand endurance to these decayed, or decaying structures, wanting. But I\nshall not pause to enumerate their portraits, or make out a catalogue as\nlong as the list of Homer's ships, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge.\nSufficient has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of the\nphysiology of the room. Yet stay! I must not omit to point out the\ncontents of those groaning shelves. In the goodly folios crowded there\nare contained the chronicles of Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian,\nand Stow; of Matthew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let him\nnot be terrified at the ponderous size of these admirable old\nhistorians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he should chance to\nopen a volume. Their freshness and picturesque details will surprise as\nmuch as they will delight him. From this wealthy mine Shakspeare drew\nsome of his purest ore. The shelves are crowned by a solitary bust. It\nis that of a modern. It is that of a lover of London, and a character\nof London. It is DOCTOR JOHNSON.\n\nHaving completed the survey of the apartment, I shall now proceed to its\noccupants. These were five in number--jolly fellows all--seated round a\ncircular dining-table covered with glasses and decanters, amidst which a\nportly magnum of claret, and a deep and capacious china punch-bowl, must\nnot pass unmentioned. They were in the full flow of fun and\nconviviality; enjoying themselves as good fellows always enjoy\nthemselves at \"the season of the year.\" The port was delectable--old as\nSaint Paul's, I was going to say--not quite, however--but just \"old\nenough\"; the claret was nectar, or what is better, it was Lafitte; the\npunch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party would have split\nyour sides--their laughter would have had the same effect on your ears.\nNever were heard peals of merriment so hearty and prolonged. You only\nwondered how they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow on\nthe heels of its predecessor. That they _did_ drink, however, was clear;\nthat they _had_ drunk was equally certain; and that they intended to\ncontinue drinking seemed to come within the limits of probability.\n\nSir Lionel Flamstead was a retired merchant--one of those high-souled,\nhigh-principled traders, of whom our City was once so justly proud, and\nof whom so few, in these days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained\nspeculations, can be found. His word was his bond--once passed, it was\nsufficient; his acceptances were accounted safe as the Bank of England.\nHad Sir Thomas Gresham descended from his niche he could not have been\ntreated with greater consideration than attended Sir Lionel's appearance\non 'Change. All eyes followed the movements of his tall and stately\nfigure--all hats were raised to his courteous but ceremonious\nsalutation. Affable, yet precise, and tinctured with something of the\npunctiliousness of the old school, his manners won him universal respect\nand regard, even from those unknown to him. By his intimates he was\nrevered. His habits were as regular as clockwork, and the glass of cold\npunch at Tom's, or the basin of soup at Birch's, wound him up for the\nday. His attire was as formal as his manners, being a slight\nmodification of the prevalent costume of some five-and-thirty years ago.\nHe had consented, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether\nlimbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction; but he\nresolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is something, by-the-bye, in a\npigtail, to which old gentlemen cling in spite of all remonstrance, with\nlover-like pertinacity. Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to\nyour great-uncle or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off\nwith a shilling yourself. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gathered his\nlocks, once sable as the riband that bound them, but now thickly strewn\nwith the silver \"blossoms of the grave,\" into a knot, and suffered them\nto dangle a few inches below his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre\nbeyond French polish, and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to\napproach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with a thick\npad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carried a black ebony\ncane in his hand, and was generally followed by a pet pug-dog, one of\nthe most sagacious and disagreeable specimens of his species. Sir Lionel\nFlamstead, I have said, was tall--I might have said he was very\ntall--somewhat narrower across the shoulders than about the hips--a\ncircumstance which did not materially conduce to his symmetry--with\ngrey, benevolent eyes, shaded by bushy, intelligent brows--a lofty,\nexpansive forehead, in which, in the jargon of phrenology, the organs of\nlocality and ideality were strongly developed, and which was rendered\nthe more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on either side of\nthe temples--with a nose which had been considered handsome and well\nproportioned in his youth, but to which good living had imparted a\nbottle form and a bottle tint--and cheeks from which all encroachment of\nwhiskers was sedulously removed, in order, we conclude, that his rosy\ncomplexion might be traced from its point of concentration, upon the\nprominent feature before mentioned, to its final disappearance behind\nhis ears. Such was Sir Lionel Flamstead.\n\n\n\n\nA NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSANTA MARIA MAGGIORE\n\n    The Pope was saying the high, high mass,\n      All on Saint Peter's day;\n    With the power to him given by the saints in heaven\n      To wash men's sins away.\n\n    The Pope he was saying the blessed mass,\n      And the people kneel'd around;\n    And from each man's soul his sins did pass,\n      As he kissed the holy ground.\n\n    --_The Grey Brother._\n\n\nChancing to be in Rome in the August of 1830, I visited the gorgeous\nchurch of Santa Maria Maggiore during the celebration of the anniversary\nof the Holy Assumption.\n\nIt was a glorious sight to one unaccustomed to the imposing religious\nceremonials of the Romish Church, to witness all the pomp and splendour\ndisplayed at this high solemnity--to gaze down that glittering pile, and\nmark the various ecclesiastical dignitaries, each in their peculiar and\ncharacteristic costume, employed in the ministration of their sacred\nfunctions, and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the papal guards, so\nstationed to keep back the crowd, and who, with their showy scarlet\nattire and tall halberds, looked like the martial figures we see in the\nsketches of Callot. Nor was the brilliant effect of this picture\ndiminished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set. Overhead\nflamed a roof resplendent with burnished gold; before me rose a canopy\nsupported by pillars of porphyry, and shining with many-coloured stones;\nwhile on either hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and\nboasting each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses proper to\nthe service were ever and anon chanted by the papal choir, and\noverpowering perfume was diffused around by a hundred censers.\n\nSubdued by the odours, the music, and the spectacle, I sank into a state\nof dreamy enthusiasm, during a continuance of which I almost fancied\nmyself a convert to the faith of Rome, and surrendered myself\nunreflectingly to an admiration of its errors. As I gazed among the\nsurrounding crowd, the sight of so many prostrate figures, all in\nattitudes of deepest devotion, satisfied me of the profound religious\nimpression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this feeling was not\nuniversal; and, as elsewhere, likewise, more zeal was exhibited by the\nlower than the higher classes of society; and I occasionally noted\namongst the latter the glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not\naltogether agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirations. Yet methought, on\nthe whole, I had never seen such abandonment of soul, such prostration\nof spirit, in my own colder clime, and during the exercise of my own\nmore chastened creed, as that which in several instances I now beheld;\nand I almost envied the poor maiden near me, who, abject upon the earth,\nhad washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins, in contrite tears.\n\nAs such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a pleasure in singling\nout particular figures and groups which interested me, from their\npeculiarity of costume, or from their devotional fervour. Amongst\nothers, a little to my left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from\nCalabria, for such I judged them to be from their wild and picturesque\ngarb. Deeply was every individual of this little knot of peasantry\nimpressed by the ceremonial. Every eye was humbly cast down; every knee\nbent; every hand was either occupied in grasping the little crucifix\nsuspended from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or\nfervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast.\n\nWhile gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an individual whom I had\nnot hitherto noticed, and who now irresistibly attracted my attention.\nThough a little removed from the Calabrian mountaineers, and reclining\nagainst the marble walls of the church, he evidently belonged to the\nsame company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate, though the\nnoble cast of his countenance was far superior to that of his comrades.\nHe was an old man, with a face of the fine antique Roman stamp--a bold\noutline of prominent nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut\nchin. His head and chin, as well as his naked breast, were frosted over\nwith the snowy honours of many winters, and their hoar appearance\ncontrasted strikingly with the tawny hue of a skin almost as dark and as\nlustrous as polished oak. Peasant as he was, there was something of\ngrandeur and majesty in this old man's demeanour and physiognomy. His\nhead declined backwards, so as completely to expose his long and\nmuscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by his side; one hand drooped\nupon the pavement, the other was placed within his breast: his eyes were\nclosed. The old man's garb was of the coarsest fabric; he wore little\nbeyond a shirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and canvas\nleggings bound around with leathern thongs. His appearance, however, was\nabove his condition; he became his rags as proudly as a prince would\nhave become his ermined robe.\n\nThe more I scrutinised the rigid lines of this old man's countenance,\nthe more I became satisfied that many singular, and perhaps not wholly\nguiltless, events were connected with his history. The rosary was in his\nhand--the cross upon his breast--the beads were untold--the crucifix\nunclasped--no breath of prayer passed his lips. His face was turned\nheavenward, but his eyes were closed,--he dared not open them. Why did\nhe come thither, if he did not venture to pray? Why did he assume a\npenitential attitude, if he felt no penitence?\n\nSo absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this old man's\ncountenance, as to be scarcely conscious that the service of high mass\nwas concluded, and the crowd within the holy pile fast dispersing. The\nmusic was hushed, the robed prelates and their train had disappeared,\njoyous dames were hastening along the marble aisles to their equipages;\nall, save a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were departing; and\nthe old man, aware, from the stir and hum prevailing around, that the\nceremonial was at an end, arose, stretched out his arm to one of his\ncomrades, a youth who had joined him, and prepared to follow the\nconcourse.\n\nWas he really blind? Assuredly not. Besides, he did not walk like as one\nhabituated to the direst calamity that can befall our nature. He\nstaggered in his gait, and reeled to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not\nventure to unclose his eyes within the temple of the Most High? What\nwould I not have given to be made acquainted with his history! For I\nfelt that it must be a singular one.\n\nI might satisfy my curiosity at once. He was moving slowly forward,\nguided by his comrade. In a few seconds it would be too late--he would\nhave vanished from my sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him down\nthe church, and laid my hand, with some violence, upon his shoulder.\n\nThe old man started at the touch, and turned. Now, indeed, his eyes were\nopened wide, and flashing full upon me,--and such eyes! Heretofore I had\nonly dreamed of such. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I\nquailed beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if I was,\nat first, surprised at the display of anger which I had called forth in\nhim, how much more was I astonished to behold the whole expression of\nhis countenance suddenly change. His eyes continued fixed upon mine as\nif I had been a basilisk. Apparently he could not avert them; while his\nwhole frame shivered with emotion. I advanced towards him; he shrank\nbackwards, and, but for the timely aid of his companion, would have\nfallen upon the pavement.\n\nAt a loss to conceive in what way I could have occasioned him so much\nalarm, I rushed forward to the assistance of the old man, when his\nson--for such it subsequently appeared he was--rudely repelled me, and\nthrust his hand into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent\nfurther interference.\n\nMeanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival of a third party,\nattracted by the cry the old man had uttered in falling. The new-comer\nwas an Italian gentleman, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and\nstately deportment, and with something sinister and forbidding in his\naspect. He was hastening towards the old man, but he suddenly stopped,\nand was about to retire when he encountered my gaze. As our eyes met he\nstarted; and a terror, as sudden and lively as that exhibited by the old\nman, was at once depicted in his features.\n\nMy surprise was now beyond all bounds, and I continued for some moments\nspeechless with astonishment. Not a little of the inexplicable awe which\naffected the old man and the stranger was communicated to myself.\nAltogether, we formed a mysterious and terrible triangle, of which each\nside bore some strange and unintelligible relation to the other.\n\nThe new-comer first recovered his composure, though not without an\neffort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he walked towards the old man,\nand shook him forcibly. The latter shrank from his grasp, and\nendeavoured to avoid him; but it was impossible. The stranger whispered\na few words in his ear, of which, from his gestures being directed\ntowards myself, I could guess the import. The old man replied. His\naction in doing so was that of supplication and despair. The stranger\nretorted in a wild and vehement manner, and even stamped upon the\nground; but the old man still continued to cling to the knees of his\nsuperior.\n\n\"Weak, superstitious fool!\" at length exclaimed the stranger, \"I will\nwaste no more words upon thee. Do, or say, what thou wilt; but beware!\"\nAnd spurning him haughtily back with his foot, he strode away.\n\nThe old man's reverend head struck against the marble floor. His temple\nwas cut open by the fall, and blood gushed in torrents from the wound.\nRecovering himself, he started to his feet--a knife was instantly in his\nhand, and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his aggressor, if he\nhad not been forcibly withheld by his son, and by a priest who had\njoined them.\n\n\"_Maledizione!_\" exclaimed the old man--\"a blow from _him_--from _that_\nhand! I will stab him, though he were at the altar's foot; though he had\na thousand lives, each should pay for it. Release me, Paolo! release me!\nfor, by Heaven, he dies!\"\n\n\"Peace, father!\" cried the son, still struggling with him.\n\n\"Thou art not _my_ son, to hinder my revenge!\" shouted the enraged\nfather. \"Dost not see this blood--_my_ blood--thy father's blood?--and\nthou holdest me back! Thou shouldst have struck him to the earth for the\ndeed--but he was a noble, and thou daredst not lift thy hand against\nhim!\"\n\n\"Wouldst thou have had me slay him in this holy place?\" exclaimed Paolo,\nreddening with anger and suppressed emotion.\n\n\"No, no,\" returned the old man, in an altered voice; \"not here, not\n_here_, though 'twere but just retribution. But I will find other means\nof vengeance. I will denounce him--I will betray all, though it cost me\nmy own life! He shall die by the hands of the common executioner;--there\nis one shall testify for me!\" And he pointed to me.\n\nAgain I advanced towards him.\n\n\"If thou hast aught to disclose pertaining to the Holy Church, I am\nready to listen to thee, my son,\" said the priest; \"but reflect well ere\nthou bringest any charge thou mayest not be able to substantiate against\none who stands so high in her esteem as him thou wouldst accuse.\"\n\nThe son gave his father a meaning look, and whispered somewhat in his\near. The old man became suddenly still.\n\n\"Right, right,\" said he; \"I have bethought me. 'Twas but a blow. He is\nwealthy, I am poor; there is no justice for the poor in Rome.\"\n\n\"My purse is at your service,\" said I, interfering; \"you shall have my\naid.\"\n\n\"Your aid!\" echoed the old man, staring at me; \"will _you_ assist me,\nsignor?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Enough. I may claim fulfilment of your promise.\"\n\n\"Stop, old man,\" I said; \"answer me one question ere you depart. Whence\narose your recent terrors?\"\n\n\"You shall know hereafter, signor,\" he said; \"I must now begone. We\nshall meet again. Follow me not,\" he continued, seeing I was bent upon\nobtaining further explanation of the mystery. \"You will learn nothing\nnow, and only endanger my safety. _Addio, signor._\" And with hasty steps\nhe quitted the church, accompanied by his son.\n\n\"Who is that old man?\" I demanded of the priest.\n\n\"I am as ignorant as yourself,\" he replied, \"but he must be looked to;\nhe talks threateningly.\" And he beckoned to an attendant.\n\n\"Who was he who struck him?\" was my next inquiry.\n\n\"One of our wealthiest nobles,\" he replied, \"and an assured friend of\nthe Church. We could ill spare him. Do not lose sight of them,\" he added\nto the attendant, \"and let the _sbirri_ track them to their haunts. They\nmust not be suffered to go forth to-night. A few hours' restraint will\ncool their hot Calabrian blood.\"\n\n\"But the name of the noble, father?\" I said, renewing my inquiries.\n\n\"I must decline further questioning,\" returned the priest coldly. \"I\nhave other occupation; and meanwhile it will be well to have these\nstains effaced, which may else bring scandal on these holy walls. You\nwill excuse me, my son.\" So saying, he bowed and retired.\n\nI made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of the church. He\nwas gone; none of the bystanders who had seen him go forth knew whither.\n\nStung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most unfrequented quarters of\nRome throughout the day, in the hope of meeting with the old Calabrian,\nbut in vain. As, however, I entered the courtyard of my hotel, I fancied\nI discovered, amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round the door,\nthe dark eyes of the younger mountaineer. In this I might have been\nmistaken. No one answering to his description had been seen near the\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE MARCHESA\n\n    Une chose t\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9breuse fait par des hommes t\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9breux.\n\n    --_Lucrece Borgia._\n\n\nOn the same night I bent my steps towards the Colosseum; and, full of my\nadventure of the morning, found myself, not without apprehension,\ninvolved within its labyrinthine passages. Accompanied by a monk, who,\nwith a small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fancied\nthat, by its uncertain light, I could discover stealthy figures lurking\nwithin the shades of the ruin.\n\nWhatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my course in silence.\nEmerging from the _vomitorio_, we stood upon the steps of the colossal\namphitheatre. The huge pile was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared\nitself in serene majesty before my view.\n\nWhile indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned by the hour and\nthe spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on a point of the ruin\nimmediately above me. Nothing but the head was visible; but that was\nplaced in bold relief against the beaming sky of night, and I recognised\nit at once. No nobler Roman head had ever graced the circus when Rome\nwas in her zenith. I shouted to the old Calabrian, for he it was I\nbeheld. Almost ere the sound had left my lips, he had disappeared. I\nmade known what I had seen to the monk. He was alarmed--urged our\ninstant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of the sentinel\nstationed at the entrance to the pile. To this proposal I assented; and,\nhaving descended the vasty steps and crossed the open arena, we arrived,\nwithout molestation, at the doorway.\n\nThe sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He returned with me to the\ncircus; and, after an ineffectual search amongst the ruins, volunteered\nhis services to accompany me homewards through the Forum. I declined his\noffer, and shaped my course towards a lonesome _vicolo_ on the right.\nThis was courting danger; but I cared not, and walked slowly forward\nthrough the deserted place.\n\nScarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I heard footsteps swiftly\napproaching; and, ere I could turn round, my arms were seized from\nbehind, and a bandage was passed across my eyes. All my efforts at\nliberation were unavailing; and, after a brief struggle, I remained\npassive.\n\n\"Make no noise,\" said a voice which I knew to be that of the old man,\n\"and no harm shall befall you. You must come with us. Ask no questions,\nbut follow.\"\n\nI suffered myself to be led, without further opposition, whithersoever\nthey listed. We walked for it might be half-an-hour, much beyond the\nwalls of Rome. I had to scramble through many ruins, and frequently\nstumbled over inequalities of ground. I now felt the fresh breeze of\nnight blowing over the wide campagna, and my conductors moved swiftly\nonwards as we trod on its elastic turf.\n\nAt length they came to a halt. My bandage was removed, and I beheld\nmyself beneath the arch of an aqueduct, which spanned the moonlit plain.\nA fire was kindled beneath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its\nwalls. Around the blaze were grouped the little band of peasantry I had\nbeheld within the church, in various and picturesque attitudes. They\ngreeted my conductors on their arrival, and glanced inquisitively at me,\nbut did not speak to me. The elder Calabrian, whom they addressed as\nCristofano, asked for a glass of _aqua vit\u00c3\u00a6_, which he handed\nrespectfully to me. I declined the offer, but he pressed it upon me.\n\n\"You will need it, signor,\" he said; \"you have much to do to-night. You\nfear, perhaps, it is drugged. Behold!\" And he drank it off.\n\nI could not, after this, refuse his pledge. \"And now, signor,\" said the\nold man, removing to a little distance from the group, \"may I crave a\nword with you--your name?\"\n\nAs I had no reason for withholding it, I told him how I was called.\n\n\"Hum! Had you no relation of the name of ----?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\" And I sighed, for I thought of my desolate condition.\n\n\"Strange!\" he muttered; adding, with a grim smile, \"but, however,\nlikenesses are easily accounted for.\"\n\n\"What likenesses?\" I asked. \"Whom do I resemble? and what is the motive\nof your inexplicable conduct?\"\n\n\"You shall hear,\" he replied, frowning gloomily. \"Step aside, and let us\nget within the shade of these arches, out of the reach of yonder\nlisteners. The tale I have to tell is for your ears alone.\"\n\nI obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the aqueduct.\n\n\"Years ago,\" began the old man, \"an Englishman, in all respects\nresembling yourself, equally well favoured in person, and equally young,\ncame to Rome, and took up his abode within the eternal city. He was of\nhigh rank in his own country, and was treated with the distinction due\nto his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the Marchese\ndi ----. I was his confidential servant--his adviser--his friend. I had\nlived with his father--carried him as an infant--sported with him as a\nboy--loved and served him as a man. Loved him, I say; for, despite his\ntreatment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now. Well,\nsignor, to my story. If his youth had been profligate, his manhood was\nnot less depraved; it was devoted to cold, calculating libertinism. Soon\nafter he succeeded to the estates and title of his father, he married.\nThat he loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was\nwildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she knew it. In\nItaly, revenge, in such cases, is easily within a woman's power; and,\nfor aught I know, the marchesa might have meditated retaliation. My\nlord, however, took the alarm, and thought fit to retire to his villa\nwithout the city, and for a time remained secluded within its walls. It\nwas at this crisis that the Englishman I have before mentioned arrived\nin Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the gaieties of the city, had\nnot beheld him; but she could not have been unacquainted with him by\nreport, as every tongue was loud in his praises. A rumour of his\nsuccesses with other dames had reached my lord; nay, I have reason to\nbelieve that he had been thwarted by the handsome Englishman in some\nother quarter, and he sedulously prevented their meeting. An interview,\nhowever, _did_ take place between them, and in an unexpected manner. It\nwas the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to drive, during\nthe heats of summer, within the Piazza Navona, which is flooded with\nwater. One evening the marchesa drove thither: she was unattended,\nexcept by myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that of the\nyoung Englishman.\"\n\n\"The marchesa was beautiful, no doubt?\" I said, interrupting him.\n\n\"Most beautiful!\" he replied; \"and so your countryman seemed to think,\nfor he was lost in admiration of her. I am not much versed in the\nlanguage of the eyes, but his were too eloquent and expressive not to be\nunderstood. I watched my mistress narrowly. It was evident from her\nglowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she was not\ninsensible to his regards. She turned to play with her dog, a lovely\nlittle greyhound, which was in the carriage beside her, and patted it\ncarelessly with the glove which she held in her hand. The animal\nsnatched the glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell\nover the carriage side. My lady uttered a scream at the sight, and I was\npreparing to extricate the struggling dog, when the Englishman plunged\ninto the water. In an instant he had restored her favourite to the\nmarchesa, and received her warmest acknowledgments. From that moment an\nintimacy commenced, which was destined to produce the most fatal\nconsequences to both parties.\"\n\n\"Did you betray them?\" I asked, somewhat impatiently.\n\n\"I was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,\" replied the old\nman. \"I told him all particulars of the interview. He heard me in\nsilence, but grew ashy pale with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my\nvigilance, he left me. My lady was now scarcely ever out of my sight;\nwhen one evening, a few days after what had occurred, she walked forth\nalone upon the garden-terrace of the villa. Her guitar was in her hand,\nand her favourite dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but\nwholly unperceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her\ninstrument, and then, resting her chin upon her white and rounded arm,\nseemed lost in tender reverie. Would you had seen her, signor, as I\nbeheld her then, or as one other beheld her! you would acknowledge that\nyou had never met with her equal in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick\ntresses over shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most perfect\nproportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown languidly on the ground, and\nher radiant features were charged with an expression of profound and\npensive passion.\n\n\"In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes, when she was\naroused by the gambols of her dog, who bore in his mouth a glove which\nhe had found. As she took it from him, a letter dropped upon the floor.\nHad a serpent glided from its folds, it could not have startled her\nmore. She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes, she was\n_irresolute_; and you may conjecture the rest. She paused, and by that\npause was lost. With a shrinking grasp she stooped to raise the letter.\nHer cheeks, which had grown deathly pale, again kindled with blushes as\nshe perused it. She hesitated--cast a bewildering look towards the\nmansion--placed the note within her bosom--and plunged into the\norange-bower.\"\n\n\"Her lover awaited her there?\"\n\n\"He did. I saw them meet. I heard his frenzied words--his passionate\nentreaties. He urged her to fly--she resisted. He grew more urgent--more\nimpassioned. She uttered a faint cry, and I stood before them. The\nEnglishman's hand was at my throat, and his sword at my breast, with the\nswiftness of thought; and but for the screams of my mistress, that\ninstant must have been my last. At her desire he relinquished his hold\nof me; but her cries had reached other ears, and the marchese arrived to\navenge his injured honour. He paused not to inquire the nature of the\noffence, but, sword in hand, assailed the Englishman, bidding me remove\nhis lady. The clash of their steel was drowned by her shrieks as I bore\nher away; but I knew the strife was desperate. Before I gained the house\nmy lady had fainted; and committing her to the charge of other\nattendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my master slowly walking\nhomewards. His sword was gone--his brow was bent--he shunned my sight. I\nknew what had happened, and did not approach him. He sought his wife.\nWhat passed in that interview was never disclosed, but it may be guessed\nat from its result. That night the marchesa left her husband's\nhalls--never to return. Next morn I visited the terrace where she had\nreceived the token. The glove was still upon the ground. I picked it up\nand carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole occurrence to him.\nHe took it, and vowed as he took it that his vengeance should never rest\nsatisfied till that glove had been steeped in her blood.\"\n\n\"And he kept his vow?\" I asked, shuddering.\n\n\"Many months elapsed ere its accomplishment. Italian vengeance is slow,\nbut sure. To all outward appearance, he had forgotten his faithless\nwife. He had even formed a friendship with her lover, which he did the\nmore effectually to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled\non, and the marchesa gave birth to a child--the offspring of her\nseducer.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" I exclaimed, \"was that child a boy?\"\n\n\"It was--but listen to me. My tale draws to a close. One night, during\nthe absence of the Englishman, by secret means we entered the palazzo\nwhere the marchesa resided. We wandered from room to room till we came\nto her chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side. The sight\nmaddened the marchese. He would have stricken the child, but I held back\nhis hand. He relented. He bade me make fast the door. He approached the\nbed. I heard a rustle--a scream. A white figure sprang from out the\ncouch. In an instant the light was extinguished--there was a\nblow--another--and all was over. I threw open the door. The marchese\ncame forth. The corridor in which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A\nglove was in his hand--it was dripping with blood. His oath was\nfulfilled--his vengeance complete--no, not complete, for the Englishman\nyet lived.\"\n\n\"What became of him?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ask me not,\" replied the old man; \"you were at the Chiesa Santa Maria\nMaggiore this morning. If those stones could speak, they might tell a\nfearful story.\"\n\n\"And that was the reason you did not dare to unclose your eyes within\nthose holy precincts?--a film of blood floated between you and heaven.\"\n\nThe old man shuddered, but replied not.\n\n\"And the child?\" I asked, after a pause; \"what of their wretched\noffspring?\"\n\n\"It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead father. If he were\nalive, that boy would be about your age, signor.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" I said; a horrible suspicion flashing across my mind.\n\n\"After the Englishman's death,\" continued Cristofano, \"my master began\nto treat me with a coldness and suspicion which increased daily. I was a\nburden to him, and he was resolved to rid himself of me. I spared him\nthe trouble--quitted Rome--sought the mountains of the Abruzzi--and\nthence wandered to the fastnesses of Calabria, and became--no matter\nwhat. Here I am. Heaven's appointed minister of vengeance. The marchese\ndies to-night!\"\n\n\"To-night! old man,\" I echoed, horror-stricken. \"Add not crime to crime.\nIf he has indeed been guilty of the foul offence you have named, let him\nbe dealt with according to the offended laws of the country. Do not\npervert the purposes of justice.\"\n\n\"Justice!\" echoed Cristofano scornfully.\n\n\"Ay, justice. You are poor and powerless, but means may be found to aid\nyou. I will assist the rightful course of vengeance.\"\n\n\"You _shall_ assist it. I have sworn he shall die before dawn, and the\nhand to strike the blow shall be yours.\"\n\n\"Mine! never!\"\n\n\"Your own life will be the penalty of your obstinacy, if you refuse; nor\nwill your refusal save him. By the Mother of Heaven, he dies! and by\nyour hand. You saw how he was struck by your resemblance to the young\nEnglishman this morning in the chiesa. It is wonderful! I know not who\nor what you are; but to me you are an instrument of vengeance, and as\nsuch I shall use you. The blow dealt by you will seem the work of\nretribution; and I care not if you strike twice, and make my heart your\nsecond mark.\"\n\nEre I could reply he called to his comrades, and in a few moments we\nwere speeding across the campagna.\n\nWe arrived at a high wall:--the old man conducted us to a postern-gate,\nwhich he opened. We entered a garden filled with orange-trees, the\nperfume of which loaded the midnight air. We heard the splash of a\nfountain at a distance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst\nsome taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the belvidere of the\nproud villa. We strode along a wide terrace edged by a marble\nbalustrade. The old man pointed to an open summer-house terminating the\nwalk, and gave me a significant look, but he spoke not. A window thrown\nopen admitted us to the house. We were within a hall crowded with\nstatues, and traversed noiselessly its marble floors. Passing through\nseveral chambers, we then mounted to a corridor, and entered an\napartment which formed the ante-room to another beyond it. Placing his\nfinger upon his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofano\nopened a door and disappeared. There was a breathless pause for a few\nminutes, during which I listened intently, but caught only a faint sound\nas of the snapping of a lock.\n\nPresently the old man returned.\n\n\"He sleeps,\" he said, in a low deep tone to me; \"sleeps as his victim\nslept--sleeps without a dream of remorse; and he shall awaken, as she\nawoke, to despair. Come into his chamber!\"\n\nWe obeyed. The door was made fast within side.\n\nThe curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the moonlight streamed\nfull upon the face of the sleeper. He was hushed in profound repose. No\nvisions seemed to haunt his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so\nsoundly? I half doubted the old man's story.\n\nPlacing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristofano approached the\nbed. A stiletto glittered in his hand. \"Awake!\" he cried, in a voice of\nthunder.\n\nThe sleeper started at the summons.\n\nI watched his countenance. He read Cristofano's errand in his eye. But\nhe quailed not.\n\n\"Cowardly assassin!\" he cried, \"you have well consulted your own safety\nin stealing on my sleep.\"\n\n\"And who taught me the lesson?\" fiercely interrupted the old man. \"Am I\nthe first that have stolen on midnight slumber? Gaze upon this? When and\nhow did it acquire its dye?\" And he held forth a glove, which looked\nblackened and stained in the moonlight.\n\nThe marchese groaned aloud.\n\n\"My cabinet broken open!\" at length he exclaimed--\"villain! how dare you\ndo this? But why do I rave? I know with whom I have to deal.\" Uttering\nthese words he sprung from his couch with the intention of grappling\nwith the old man; but Cristofano retreated, and at that instant the\nbrigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me forward. I was face to face\nwith the marchese.\n\nThe apparition of the murdered man could not have staggered him more.\nHis limbs were stiffened by the shock, and he remained in an attitude of\nfreezing terror.\n\n\"Is he come for vengeance?\" he ejaculated.\n\n\"He is!\" cried Cristofano. \"Give him the weapon!\"\n\nAnd a stiletto was thrust into my hand. But I heeded not the steel. I\ntore open my bosom--a small diamond cross was within the folds.\n\n\"Do you recollect this?\" I demanded of the marchese.\n\n\"It was my wife's!\" he shrieked in amazement.\n\n\"It was upon the infant's bosom as he slept by her side on that fatal\nnight,\" said Cristofano. \"I saw it sparkle there.\"\n\n\"That infant was myself--that wife my mother!\" I cried.\n\n\"The murderer stands before you! Strike!\" exclaimed Cristofano.\n\nI raised the dagger. The marchese stirred not. I could not strike.\n\n\"Do you hesitate?\" angrily exclaimed Cristofano.\n\n\"He has not the courage,\" returned the younger Calabrian. \"You\nreproached me this morning with want of filial duty. Behold how a son\ncan avenge his father!\" And he plunged his stiletto within the bosom of\nthe marchese.\n\n\"_Your_ father is not yet avenged, young man!\" cried Cristofano, in a\nterrible tone. \"You alone can avenge him!\"\n\nEre I could withdraw its point the old man had rushed upon the dagger\nwhich I held extended in my grasp.\n\nHe fell without a single groan.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Auriol, by W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":721,"split":"train"}
