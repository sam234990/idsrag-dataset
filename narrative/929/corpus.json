{"ori_id":"d66fe35ce1d4d1166add716e366c04a84618cabe","title":"Hesher (film)","context":"Hesher (film)\n Following the loss of his mother in a car crash, T.J. (Devin Brochu) falls into a state of depression. He becomes obsessed with the car his mother died in and follows it when it is towed away. He and his passive, depressed and pill-taking father Paul (Rainn Wilson) live with T.J.'s grandmother Madeleine (Piper Laurie), where they are soon joined by a squatter, Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a foul-mouthed, tattooed, heavy metal-loving lout.\nAfter school, Dustin, a bully from the towing service, finds his car vandalized and blames T.J., who is saved and taken home by Nicole (Natalie Portman), a grocery store clerk. Hesher witnesses Dustin attacking T.J., but does nothing. Later, Hesher sets Dustin's car on fire, leading to police questioning T.J., but lack of evidence forces them to let him go. T.J. proceeds to spy on Nicole at the grocery store when Hesher appears and follows her home with T.J. She causes a fender-bender and is verbally assaulted by the other driver, when Hesher comes to her rescue by threatening him. He then takes Nicole and T.J. to a random house that is for sale. There, Hesher trashes the swimming pool and lights the diving board on fire before he shocks Nicole and T.J. by leaving them there alone. When the pair get back to Nicole's broken down car, it has a ticket in the window, at which point Nicole breaks down and cries about how bad her life is.\nLater that night, T.J. and Paul get into an argument over dinner. Madeleine is saddened that there is 'nothing she can do', and goes to her room. Hesher says he'll walk with her in the morning, but the next morning, he finds her dead. T.J. steals his dad's credit card and takes money to buy the car back, but is told it's been removed. He decides to give the money to Nicole, but when he gets there she is having sex with Hesher, so he damages his van while telling both of them he doesn't want to see them again and leaves.\nHe threatens Dustin at his house and finds out the car was taken to be crushed. Dustin begins attacking T.J. until Hesher, who has been following him, appears and drags Dustin off him. T.J. tells him he still doesn't want to see him again and then goes to the junkyard. He climbs in the wrecked car and sleeps, dreaming of his mother's death. He wakes up when the car is going to be crushed and falls out. He returns home after seeing it destroyed. While getting ready for his grandmother's funeral, Nicole comes and asks for forgiveness and leaves him. At the funeral, T.J. is asked to say words for her, but has nothing to say.\nHesher walks in drunk and demands that the mourners listen to him. He tells a story about how when he was younger he blew up a car and shrapnel destroyed one of his testicles, and he was upset about it until he realized he still had one and a penis that works, and that Paul and T.J. both lost a loved one but still have each other, and that he promised to walk with Madeleine, so he takes the casket. He is followed by T.J. and Paul, who join him in walking her to the cemetery.\nThe next day, Paul shaves for the first time in weeks and shows T.J. the compacted remains of his mother's car, which Hesher has procured from the junkyard and dumped in the driveway. On their roof, he has painted in huge white letters \"Hesher was here.\"\n<html>\n<head><title>Hesher Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Hesher script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Hesher script, Hesher movie script, Hesher film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

TJ turns with it, running straight\n          into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off\n          his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,\n          stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.\n                         \n          TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in\n          the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and\n          continues after the truck.\n                         \n          TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck.

It's drawn in\n          perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the\n          naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'\n          have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car\n          toward TJ, narrowly missing him.

His bike lands on top of him.\n                         \n          Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle\n          of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,\n          cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to\n          wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.\n          He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.\n                         \n          And then a WOMAN'S VOICE -\n                         \n<b>           VOICE (O.S.)\n<\/b>           Hey!\n                         \n          Dustin ignores the voice.

I dropped that mouse in the\n           snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go\n           near him, and any time he tried that\n           mouse would just smack him with his\n           little, you know...\n                         \n          Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are\n          called.\n                         \n<b>                          HESHER (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           With his little mouse hand. So instead\n           of eating the mouse the snake just\n           curled up crying in the corner and the\n           mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And\n           this went on for weeks, the snake\n           wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse\n           used to sit in a little miniature lawn\n           chair scratching his balls and\n           shelling peanuts and this snake was\n           just too scared to go near it. And cuz\n           the snake was scared of that mouse I\n           had to feed him other mice, but every\n           time I dropped another mouse in the\n           tank, it'd hide behind the brave\n           mouse. And so eventually the snake\n           starved to death.
