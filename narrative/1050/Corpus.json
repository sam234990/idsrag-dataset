A sensitive, educated young man, Penrose had enlisted in the ranks in 1914, immediately after completing his second year at Oxford. After six months in training he had been prevailed upon by his relatives \u2013 like most educated volunteers \u2013 to take a commission as an officer.\nPenrose slowly asserts himself; the war takes a toll on his personality, but he begins to live up to his early dreams of heroism. However, his creeping self-doubt grows by degrees; he is reassigned from his post as scouting officer once on the Somme, knowing he cannot face another night patrol, and earns the wrath of his commanding officer \u2013 an irascible Regular colonel \u2013 over a trivial incident. The colonel piles difficult, risky work on him \u2013 remarking to the narrator that \"Master Penrose can go on with [leading ration parties] until he learns to do them properly\" \u2013 and Penrose submits, working doggedly to try to keep from cracking. After a long period of this treatment, by the winter of 1916, Penrose's spirit is worn down; when the narrator is invalided home with an injury in February 1917, his last support is gone. He is wounded in May at Arras \u2013 a friend remarking in a letter that \"you'd have said he wanted to be killed\" \u2013 and they meet again in London in November. Penrose has been offered a safe job in military intelligence; he comes within a moment of taking it, but at the last minute resolves to return to France.\nReturning to his battalion, he is detailed for a party to the front line by the colonel within an hour; when the narrator arrives six weeks later, he discovers Penrose is under arrest for cowardice in the face of the enemy. It transpired that each time the party advanced, it had to break for the ditches to avoid shellfire, then regroup and move further; after some time, Penrose decided to fall back and wait under cover for the shelling to halt. Seeing a dugout down the road, they make a run for it under shellfire \u2013 to find it occupied by a senior officer, himself sheltering from the shelling, who promptly reports that \"he had seen the officer in charge and some of the party running down the road \u2013 demoralized\" and is ordered to arrest him and return. Penrose is court-martialled on these charges, and convicted; the court's recommendation for mercy is ignored, and he is shot one morning, a week later, by a party of men from his own company.\nPenrose is presented in a glowing light throughout \u2013 \"never anything but modest and dutiful; he always tries his best to do his bit\" \u2013 but, ultimately, is failed by the system. He faces his trial honestly, without pleading circumstances (\"The real charge was that I'd lost my nerve \u2013 and I had. And I didn't want to wangle out of it like that\") but it is clear that whilst he is strictly guilty of the charge (\"on the only facts they had succeeded in discovering it could hardly have been anything else\") justice, by any sense of the word, had not been done to him.\n\"...[and] that is all I have tried to do. This book is not an attack on any person, on the death penalty, or on anything else, though if it makes people think about these things, so much the better. I think I believe in the death penalty \u2013 I do not know. But I did not believe in Harry being shot.\nThat is the gist of it; that my friend Harry was shot for cowardice \u2013 and he was one of the bravest men I ever knew.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Secret Battle, by A.

At times, it\nmay be, I shall seem to digress into the dreary commonplaces of all\nwar-chronicles, but you will never understand the ruthless progression\nof Penrose's tragedy without some acquaintance with each chapter of his\nlife in the army.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe joined the battalion only a few days before we left Plymouth for\nGallipoli, a shy, intelligent-looking person, with smooth, freckled skin\nand quick, nervous movements; and although he was at once posted to my\ncompany we had not become at all intimate when we steamed at last into\nMudros Bay. But he had interested me from the first, and at intervals in\nthe busy routine of a troopship passing without escort through submarine\nwaters, I had been watching him and delighting in his keenness and happy\ndisposition.\n\nIt was not my first voyage through the Mediterranean, though it was the\nfirst I had made in a transport, and I liked to see my own earlier\nenthusiasm vividly reproduced in him. Cape Spartel and the first glimpse\nof Africa; Tangiers and Tarifa and all that magical hour's steaming\nthrough the narrow waters with the pink and white houses hiding under\nthe hills; Gibraltar Town shimmering and asleep in the noonday sun;\nMalta and the bumboat women, carozzes swaying through the narrow,\nchattering streets; cool drinks at caf\u00c3\u00a9s in a babel of strange tongues;\nall these were to Penrose part of the authentic glamour of the East; and\nhe said so. I might have told him, with the fatuous pomp of wider\nexperience, that they were in truth but a very distant reflection of the\ngenuine East; but I did not. For it was refreshing to see any one so\nfrankly confessing to the sensations of adventure and romance. To other\nmembers of the officers' mess the spectacle of Gibraltar from the sea\nmay have been more stimulating than the spectacle of Southend (though\nthis is doubtful); but it is certain that few of them would have\nadmitted the grave impeachment.\n\nAt Malta some of us spent an evening ashore, and sat for a little in a\ntawdry, riotous little caf\u00c3\u00a9, where two poor singing women strove vainly\nto make themselves heard above the pandemonium of clinked glasses and\nbawled orders; there we met many officers newly returned from the\nlanding at Cape Helles, some of them with slight bodily wounds, but all\nof them with grievous injury staring out of their eyes. Those of them\nwho would speak at all were voluble with anecdotes of horror and blood.\nMost of our own party had not yet lost the light-hearted mood in which\nmen went to the war in those days; the 'picnic' illusion of war was not\nyet dispelled; also, individually, no doubt, we had that curious\nconfidence of the unblooded soldier that none of these strange, terrible\nthings could ever actually happen to _us_; we should for ever hang upon\nthe pleasant fringes of war, sailing in strange seas, and drinking in\nstrange towns, but never definitely entangled in the more crude and\ndistasteful circumstances of battle. And if there were any of us with a\nsecret consciousness that we deceived ourselves, to-night was no time to\ntear away the veil. Let there be lights and laughter and wine;\nto-morrow, if need be, let us be told how the wounded had drowned in the\nwired shallows, and reckon the toll of that unforgettable exploit and\nthe terrors that were still at work. And so we would not be dragooned\ninto seriousness by these messengers from the Peninsula; but rather,\nwith no injury to their feelings, laughed at their croakings and\ncontinued to drink.\n\nBut Harry Penrose was different. He was all eagerness to hear every\ndetail, hideous and heroic.\n\nThere was one officer present, from the 29th Division, a man about\nthirty, with a tanned, melancholy face and great solemn eyes, which, for\nall the horrors he related, seemed to have something yet more horrible\nhidden in their depths. Him Harry plied with questions, his reveller's\nmood flung impatiently aside; and the man seemed ready to tell him\nthings, though from his occasional reservations and sorrowful smile I\nknew that he was pitying Harry for his youth, his eagerness and his\nignorance.\n\nAround us were the curses of overworked waiters, and the babble of loud\nconversations, and the smell of spilt beer; there were two officers\nuproariously drunk, and in the distance pathetic snatches of songs were\nheard from the struggling singer on the dais. We were in one of the\nfirst outposts of the Empire, and halfway to one of her greatest\nadventures. And this excited youth at my side was the only one of all\nthat throng who was ready to hear the truth of it, and to speak of\ndeath. I lay emphasis on this incident, because it well illustrates his\nattitude towards the war at that time (which too many have now\nforgotten), and because I then first found the image which alone\nreflects the many curiosities of his personality.\n\nHe was like an imaginative, inquisitive child; a child that cherishes a\nsecret gallery of pictures in its mind, and must continually be feeding\nthis storehouse with new pictures of the unknown; that is not content\nwith a vague outline of something that is to come, a dentist, or a\nvisit, or a doll, but will not rest till the experience is safely put\naway in its place, a clear, uncompromising picture, to be taken down and\nplayed with at will.\n\nMoreover, he had the fearlessness of a child--but I shall come to that\nlater.\n\nAnd so we came to Mudros, threading a placid way between the deceitful\nAegean Islands. Harry loved them because they wore so green and inviting\nan aspect, and again I did not undeceive him and tell him how parched\nand austere, how barren of comfortable grass and shade he would find\nthem on closer acquaintance. We steamed into Mudros Bay at the end of an\nunbelievable sunset; in the great harbour were gathered regiments of\nships--battleship, cruiser, tramp, transport, and trawler, and as the\nsun sank into the western hills, the masts and the rigging of all of\nthem were radiant with its last rays, while all their decks and hulls\nlay already in the soft blue dusk. There is something extraordinarily\nsoothing in the almost imperceptible motion of a big steamer gliding at\nslow speed to her anchorage; as I leaned over the rail of the boat-deck\nand heard the tiny bugle-calls float across from the French or English\nwarships, and watched the miniature crews at work upon their decks, I\nbecame aware that Penrose was similarly engaged close at hand, and it\nseemed to me an opportunity to learn something of the history of this\nstrange young man.\n\nBeginning with his delight in the voyage and all the marvellous romance\nof our surroundings, I led him on to speak of himself. Both his parents\nhad died when he was a boy at school. They had left him enough to go to\nOxford upon (without the help of the Exhibition he had won), and he had\nbut just completed his second year there when the war broke out. For\nsome mysterious reason he had immediately enlisted instead of applying\nfor a commission, like his friends. I gathered--though not from anything\nhe directly said--that he had had a hard time in the ranks. The majority\nof his companions in training had come down from the north with the\nfirst draft of Tynesiders; and though, God knows, the Tynesider as a\nfighting man has been unsurpassed in this war, they were a wild, rough\ncrowd before they became soldiers, and I can understand that for a\nhigh-strung, sensitive boy of his type the intimate daily round of\neating, talking, and sleeping with them, must have made large demands on\nhis patriotism and grit. But he said it did him good; and it was only\nthe pestering of his guardian and relations that after six months forced\nhim to take a commission. He had a curious lack of confidence in his\nfitness to be an officer--a feeling which is deplorably absent in\nhundreds not half as fit as he was; but from what I had seen of his\nhandling of his platoon on the voyage (and the men are difficult after a\nweek or two at sea) I was able to assure him that he need have no\nqualms. He was, I discovered, pathetically full of military ambitions;\nhe dreamed already, he confessed, of decorations and promotions and\nglorious charges. In short, he was like many another undergraduate\nofficer of those days in his eagerness and readiness for sacrifice, but\nfar removed from the common type in his romantic, imaginative outlook\ntowards the war. 'Romantic' is the only word, I think, and it is\nmelancholy for me to remember that even then I said to myself, 'I wonder\nhow long the romance will last, my son.'\n\nBut I could not guess just how terrible was to be its decay.\n\n\nII\n\nWe were not to be long at Mudros. For three days we lay in the\nsweltering heat of the great hill-circled bay, watching the warships\ncome and go, and buying fruit from the little Greek sailing boats which\nfluttered round the harbour. These were days of hot anxiety about one's\nkit; hourly each officer reorganized and re-disposed his exiguous\nbelongings, and re-weighed his valise, and jettisoned yet more precious\narticles of comfort, lest the weight regulations be violated and for the\nsake of an extra shirt the whole of one's equipment be cast into the sea\nby the mysterious figure we believed to watch over these things.\nAfterwards we found that all our care was in vain, and in the\ncomfortless camps of the Peninsula bitterly bewailed the little luxuries\nwe had needlessly left behind, now so unattainable. Down in the odorous\ntroop-decks the men wrote long letters describing the battles in which\nthey were already engaged, and the sound of quite mythical guns.\n\nBut on the third day came our sailing orders. In the evening a little\ntrawler, promoted to the dignity of a fleet-sweeper, came alongside, and\nall the regiment of gross, overloaded figures, festooned with armament\nand bags of food, and strange, knobbly parcels, tumbled heavily over the\nside. Many men have written of the sailing of the first argosy of\ntroopships from that bay; and by this time the spectacle of departing\ntroops was an old one to the vessels there. But this did not diminish\nthe quality of their farewells. All the King's ships 'manned ship' as we\npassed, and sent us a great wave of cheering that filled the heart with\nsadness and resolution.\n\nIn one of the French ships was a party of her crew high up somewhere\nabove the deck, and they sang for us with astonishing accuracy and\nfeeling the 'Chant du D\u00c3\u00a9part'; so moving was this that even the stolid\nNortherners in our sweeper were stirred to make some more articulate\nacknowledgment than the official British cheer; and one old pitman,\nsearching among his memories of some Lancashire music-hall, dug out a\nrough version of the 'Marseillaise.' By degrees all our men took up the\ntune and sang it mightily, with no suspicion of words; and the officers,\nnot less timidly, joined in, and were proud of the men for what they had\ndone. For many were moved in that moment who were never moved before.\nBut while we were yet warm with cheering and the sense of knighthood, we\ncleared the boom and shivered a little in the breeze of the open sea.\n\nThe sun went down, and soon it was very cold in the sweeper: and in each\nman's heart I think there was a certain chill. There were no more songs,\nbut the men whispered in small groups, or stood silent, shifting\nuneasily their wearisome packs. For now we were indeed cut on from\ncivilization and committed to the unknown. The transport we had left\nseemed a very haven of comfort and security; one thought longingly of\nwhite tables in the saloon, and the unfriendly linen bags of bully-beef\nand biscuits we carried were concrete evidence of a new life. The war\nseemed no longer remote, and each of us realized indignantly that we\nwere personally involved in it. So for a little all these soldiers had a\nperiod of serious thought unusual in the soldier's life. But as we\nneared the Peninsula the excitement and novelty and the prospect of\nexercising cramped limbs brought back valour and cheerfulness.\n\nAt Malta we had heard many tales of the still terrifying ordeal of\nlanding under fire. But such terrors were not for us. There was a bright\nmoon, and as we saw the pale cliffs of Cape Helles, all, I think,\nexpected each moment a torrent of shells from some obscure quarter. But\ninstead an unearthly stillness brooded over the two bays, and only a\nMorse lamp blinking at the sweeper suggested that any living thing was\nthere. And there came over the water a strange musty smell; some said it\nwas the smell of the dead, and some the smell of an incinerator; myself\nI do not know, but it was the smell of the Peninsula for ever, which no\nman can forget. We disembarked at a pier of rafts by the _River Clyde_,\nand stumbled eagerly ashore. And now we were in the very heart of heroic\nthings. Nowhere, I think, was the new soldier plunged so suddenly into\nthe genuine scenes of war as he was at Gallipoli; in France there was a\nlong transition of training-camps and railway trains and billets, and he\nmoved by easy gradations to the firing-line. But here, a few hours after\na night in linen sheets, we stood suddenly on the very sand where, but\nthree weeks before, those hideous machine-guns in the cliffs had mown\ndown that astonishing party of April 25. And in that silver stillness it\nwas difficult to believe.\n\nWe shambled off up the steady slope between two cliffs, marvelling that\nany men could have prevailed against so perfect a 'field of fire.' By\nnow we were very tired, and it was heavy work labouring through the soft\nsand. Queer, Moorish-looking figures in white robes peered at us from\ndark corners, and here and there a man poked a tousled head from a hole\nin the ground, and blinked upon our progress. Some one remarked that it\nreminded him of nothing so much as the native camp at Earl's Court on a\nfine August evening, and that indeed was the effect.\n\nAfter a little the stillness was broken by a sound which we could not\nconceal from ourselves was 'the distant rattle of musketry'; somewhere a\ngun fired startlingly; and now as we went each man felt vaguely that at\nany minute we might be plunged into the thick of a battle, laden as we\nwere, and I think each man braced himself for a desperate struggle. Such\nis the effect of marching in the dark to an unknown destination. Soon we\nwere halted in a piece of apparently waste land circled by trees, and\nordered to dig ourselves a habitation at once, for 'in the morning' it\nwas whispered 'the Turks search all this ground.' Everything was said in\na kind of hoarse, mysterious whisper, presumably to conceal our\nobservations from the ears of the Turks five miles away. But then we did\nnot know they were five miles away; we had no idea where they were or\nwhere we were ourselves. Men glanced furtively at the North Star for\nguidance, and were pained to find that, contrary to their military\nteaching, it told them nothing. Even the digging was carried on a little\nstealthily till it was discovered that the Turks were not behind those\ntrees. The digging was a comfort to the men, who, being pitmen, were now\nin their element; and the officers found solace in whispering to each\nother that magical communication about the prospective 'searching'; it\nwas the first technical word they had used 'in the field,' and they were\nsecretly proud to know what it meant.\n\nIn a little the dawn began, and the grey trees took shape; and the sun\ncame up out of Asia, and we saw at last the little sugar-loaf peak of\nAchi Baba, absurdly pink and diminutive in the distance. A man's first\nfrontal impression of that great rampart, with the outlying slopes\nmasking the summit, was that it was disappointingly small; but when he\nhad lived under and upon it for a while, day by day, it seemed to grow\nin menace and in bulk, and ultimately became a hideous, overpowering\nmonster, pervading all his life; so that it worked upon men's nerves,\nand almost everywhere in the Peninsula they were painfully conscious\nthat every movement they made could be watched from somewhere on that\nmassive hill.\n\nBut now the kitchens had come, and there was breakfast and viscous,\nmilkless tea. We discovered that all around our seeming solitude the\nearth had been peopled with sleepers, who now emerged from their holes;\nthere was a stir of washing and cooking and singing, and the smoke went\nup from the wood fires in the clear, cool air. D Company officers made\ntheir camp under an olive-tree, with a view over the blue water to\nSamothrace and Imbros, and now in the early cool, before the sun had\ngathered his noonday malignity, it was very pleasant. At seven o'clock\nthe 'searching' began. A mile away, on the northern cliffs, the first\nshell burst, stampeding a number of horses. The long-drawn warning\nscream and the final crash gave all the expectant battalion a faintly\npleasurable thrill, and as each shell came a little nearer the sensation\nremained. No one was afraid; without the knowledge of experience no one\ncould be seriously afraid on this cool, sunny morning in the grove of\nolive-trees. Those chill hours in the sweeper had been much more\nalarming. The common sensation was: 'At last I am really under fire;\nto-day I shall write home and tell them about it.' And then, when it\nseemed that the line on which the shells were falling must, if\ncontinued, pass through the middle of our camp, the firing mysteriously\nceased.\n\nHarry, I know, was disappointed; personally, I was pleased.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI learned more about Harry that afternoon. He had been much exhausted by\nthe long night, but was now refreshed and filled with an almost childish\nenthusiasm by the pictorial attractions of the place. For this\nenthusiastic soul one thing only was lacking in the site of the camp:\nthe rise of the hill which here runs down the centre of the Peninsula,\nhid from us the Dardanelles. These, he said, must immediately be viewed.\nIt was a bright afternoon of blue skies and gentle air,--not yet had the\ndry north-east wind come to plague us with dust-clouds,--and all the\nvivid colours of the scene were unspoiled. We walked over the hill\nthrough the parched scrub, where lizards darted from under our feet and\ntortoises lay comatose in the scanty shade, and came to a kind of inland\ncliff, where the Turks had had many riflemen at the landing, for all the\nground was littered with empty cartridges. And there was unfolded surely\nthe most gorgeous panorama this war has provided for prosaic Englishmen\nto see. Below was a cool, inviting grove of imperial cypresses; all\nalong the narrow strip between us and the shore lay the rest-lines of\nthe French, where moved lazy figures in blue and red, and black\nSenegalese in many colours. To the left was the wide sweep of Morto Bay,\nand beyond the first section of Achi Baba rising to De Tott's Battery in\nterraces of olives and vines. But what caught the immediate eye, what we\nhad come to see and had sailed hither to fight for, was that strip of\nunbelievably blue water before us, deep, generous blue, like a Chinese\nbowl. On the farther shore, towards the entrance to the Straits, we\ncould see a wide green plain, and beyond and to the left, peak after\npeak of the mountains of Asia; and far away in the middle distance there\nwas a glint of snow from some regal summit of the Anatolian Mountains.\n\nThat wide green plain was the Plain of Troy. The scarcity of classical\nscholars in Expeditionary Forces, and the wearisome observations of\npressmen on the subject of Troy, have combined to belittle the\nsignificance of the classical surroundings of the Gallipoli campaign. I\nmyself am a stolid, ill-read person, but I confess that the spectacle of\nthose historic flats was not one, in diplomatic phrase, which I could\nview with indifference. On Harry, ridiculously excited already, the\neffect was almost alarming. He became quite lyrical over two little\nsweepers apparently anchored near the mouth of the Straits. 'That,' he\nsaid, 'must have been where the Greek fleet lay. God! it's wonderful.'\nUp on the slope towards De Tott's Battery the guns were busy, and now\nand then Asiatic Annie sent over a large shell from the region of\nAchilles' tomb, which burst ponderously in the sea off Cape Helles. And\nthere we sat on the rough edge of the cliff and talked of Achilles and\nHector and Diomed and Patroclus and the far-sounding bolts of Jove. I do\nnot defend or exalt this action; but this is a truthful record of a\nman's personality, and I simply state what occurred. And I confess that\nwith the best wish in the world I was myself becoming a little bored\nwith Troy, when in the middle of a sentence he suddenly became silent\nand gazed across the Straits with a fixed, pinched look in his face,\nlike a man who is reminded of some far-off calamity he had forgotten.\nFor perhaps a minute he maintained this rigid aspect, and then as\nsuddenly relaxed, murmuring in a tone of relentless determination, 'I\nwill.' It was not in me not to inquire into the nature of this\npassionate intention, and somehow I induced him to explain.\n\nIt seemed that in spite of his genuine academic successes and a moderate\npopularity at school and at Oxford, he had suffered from early boyhood\nfrom a curious distrust of his own capacity in the face of anything he\nhad to do. In a measure, no doubt, this had even contributed to his\nsuccesses. For his nervousness took the form of an intimate, silent\nbrooding over any ordeal that lay before him, whether it was a visit to\nhis uncle, or 'Schools,' or a dance: he would lie awake for hours\nimagining all conceivable forms of error and failure and humiliation\nthat might befall him in his endeavour. And though he was to this extent\nforewarned and forearmed, it must have been a painful process. And it\nexplained to me the puzzling intervals of seeming melancholy which I had\nseen varying his usually cheerful demeanour.\n\n'You remember last night,' he said, 'I had been detailed to look after\nthe baggage when we disembarked, and take charge of the unloading-party?\nAs far as I know I did the job all right, except for losing old\nTompkins' valise--but you can't think how much worry and anxiety it gave\nme _beforehand_. All the time on the sweeper I was imagining the\nhundreds of possible disasters: the working-party not turning up, and me\nleft alone on the boat with the baggage--the Colonel's things being\ndropped overboard--a row with the M.L.O.--getting the baggage ashore,\nand then losing the battalion, or the working-party, or the baggage. It\nall worked out quite simply, but I tell you, Benson, it gave me hell.\nAnd it's always the same. That's really why I didn't take a\ncommission--because I couldn't imagine myself drilling men once without\nbecoming a permanent laughing-stock. I know now that I was a fool about\nthat--I usually do find that out--but I can't escape the feeling next\ntime.\n\n'And now, it's not only little things like that, but that's what I feel\nabout the whole war. I've a terror of being a failure in it, a failure\nout here--you know, a sort of regimental dud. I've heard of lots of\nthem; the kind of man that nobody gives an important job because he's\nsure to muck it up (though I do believe Eccleston's more likely to be\nthat than me). But that's what I was thinking just now. Somehow, looking\nat this view--Troy and all that--and thinking how those Greeks sweated\nblood for ten years on afternoons like this, doing their duty for the\ndamned old kings, and how we've come out here to fight in the same place\nthousands of years afterwards, and we still know about them and remember\ntheir names--well, it gave me a kind of inspiration; I don't know why.\nI've got a bit of confidence--God knows how long it will last--but I\nswear I won't be a failure, I won't be the battalion dud--and I'll have\na damned good try to get a medal of some sort and be like--like Achilles\nor somebody.'\n\nSheer breathlessness put a sudden end to this outburst, and since it was\nfollowed by a certain shyness at his own revelations I did not probe\ndeeper. But I thought to myself that this young man's spirit of romance\nwould die hard; I did not know whether it would ever die; for certainly\nI had never seen that spirit working so powerfully in any man as a\npositive incentive to achievement. And I tell you all this, because I\nwant you to understand how it was with him in the beginning.\n\nBut now the bay was in shadow below us; on the hill the solemn stillness\nthat comes over all trenches in the hour before dusk had already\ndescended, and away towards the cape the Indians were coming out to\nkneel in prayer beside the alien sea.\n\nThe Romance of War was in full song. And scrambling down the cliff, we\nbathed almost reverently in the Hellespont.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThose first three days were for many of us, who did not know the mild\nautumn months, the most pleasant we spent on the Peninsula. The last\nweeks of May had something of the quality of an old English summer, and\nthe seven plagues of the Peninsula had not yet attained the intolerable\nviolence of June and July. True, the inhabited portion of the narrow\nland we won had already become in great part a wilderness; the myrtle,\nand rock-rose, and tangled cistus, and all that wealth of spring flowers\nin which the landing parties had fallen and died in April, had long been\ntrodden to death, and there were wide stretches of yellow desert where\nnot even the parched scrub survived. But in the two and a half miles of\nbare country which lay between the capes and the foot-hills of Achi Baba\nwas one considerable oasis of olives and stunted oaks, and therein, on\nthe slopes of the bridge, was our camp fortunately set. The word 'camp'\ncontains an unmerited compliment to the place. The manner of its birth\nwas characteristic of military arrangements in those days. When we were\ntold, on that first mysterious midnight, to dig ourselves a shelter\nagainst the morning's 'searching,' we were far from imagining that what\nwe dug would be our Peninsular 'home' and haven of rest from the\nfiring-line for many months to come. And so we made what we conceived to\nbe the quickest and simplest form of shelter against a quite temporary\nemergency--long, straight, untraversed ditches, running parallel to and\nwith but a few yards between each other. No worse form of permanent\ndwelling-place could conceivably have been constructed, for the men were\ncramped in these places with a minimum of comfort and a maximum of\ndanger. No man could climb out of his narrow drain without casting a\nshower of dust from the crumbling parapet on to his sleeping neighbour\nin the next ditch; and three large German shells could have destroyed\nhalf the regiment. Yet there were many such camps, most of them lacking\nthe grateful concealment of our trees. Such targets even the Turkish\nartillery must sometimes hit, There were no dug-outs in the accepted\nsense of the Western Front, no deep, elaborate, stair-cased chambers,\nhollowed out by miners with miners' material. _Our_ dug-outs _were_\ndug-outs in truth, shallow excavations scooped in the surface of the\nearth. The only roof for a man against sun and shells was a waterproof\nsheet stretched precariously over his hole. It is sufficient testimony\nto the indifference of the Turkish artillery that with such naked\nconcentrations of men scattered about the Peninsula, casualties in the\nrest-camps were so few.\n\nEach officer had his own private hole, set democratically among the\nmen's; and an officers' mess was simply made by digging a larger hole,\nand roofing it with _two_ waterproof sheets instead of one. There was no\nluxury among the infantry there, and the gulf which yawns between the\nlives of officer and man in France as regards material comfort was\nbarely discernible in Gallipoli. Food was dull and monotonous: for weeks\nwe had only bully-beef and biscuits, and a little coarse bacon and tea,\nbut it was the same for all, one honourable equality of discomfort. At\nfirst there were no canteen facilities, and when some newcomer came from\none of the islands with a bottle of champagne and another of chartreuse,\nwe drank it with 'bully' and cast-iron biscuit. Drinking water was as\nprecious as the elixir of life, and almost as unobtainable, but officer\nand man had the same ration to eke out through the thirsty day. Wells\nwere sunk, and sometimes immediately condemned, and when we knew the\nwater was clear and sweet to taste, it was hard to have it corrupted\nwith the metallic flavour of chemicals by the medical staff. Then indeed\ndid a man learn to love water; then did he learn discipline, when he\nfilled his water-bottle in the morning with the exiguous ration of the\nday, and fought with the intolerable craving to put it to his lips and\nthere and then gurgle down his fill.\n\nIn the spring nights it was very cold, and men shivered in their single\nblanket under the unimaginable stars; but very early the sun came up,\nand by five o'clock all the camp were singing; and there were three\nhours of fresh coolness when it was very good to wash in a canvas\nbucket, and smoke in the sun before the torrid time came on; and again\nat seven, when the sun sat perched on the great rock of Samothrace, and\nImbros was set in a fleecy marvel of pink and saffron clouds, there were\ntwo hours of pure physical content; but these, I think, were more nearly\nperfect than the morning because they succeeded the irritable fevers of\nthe day. Then the crickets in the branches sang less tediously, and the\nflies melted away, and all over the Peninsula the wood fires began to\ntwinkle in the dusk, as the men cooked over a few sticks the little\ndelicacies which were preserved for this hour of respite. When we had\ndone we sat under our olive-tree in the clear twilight, and watched the\nlast aeroplanes sail home to Rabbit Islands, and talked and argued till\nthe glow-worms glimmering in the scrub, and up the hill the long roll of\nthe Turks' rapid fire, told us that darkness was at hand, and the chill\ndew sent us into our crannies to sleep.\n\nSo we were not sorry for three days of quiet in the camp before we went\nup the hill; Harry alone was all eagerness to reach the firing-line with\nthe least possible delay. But then Harry was like none of us; indeed,\nnone of us were like each other. It would have been strange if we had\nbeen. War-chroniclers have noted with an accent of astonishment the\nstrange diversity of persons to be found in units of the New Army, and\nthe essential sameness of their attitude to the war. As though a man\nwere to go into the Haymarket and be surprised if the first twelve\npedestrians there were not of the same profession; were then to summon\nthem to the assistance of a woman in the hands of a rough, and be still\nsurprised at the similarity of their methods.\n\nWe were, in truth, a motley crowd, gathered from everywhere; but when we\nsat under that olive-tree we were very much alike--with the single\nexception of Harry.\n\nEgerton, our company commander, a man of about thirty, with a round face\nand a large head, was a stockbroker by profession, and rather\nimprobably, an old Territorial by pastime. He was an excellent company\ncommander, but would have made a still more admirable second-in-command,\nfor his training in figures and his meticulous habits in such things as\nthe keeping of accounts were just what is required of a\nsecond-in-command, and were lamentably deficient in myself. The\nintricacies of Acquittance Rolls and Imprest Accounts, and page 3 of the\nSoldier's Pay-Book, were meat and drink to him, and in general I must\nconfess that I shamefully surrendered such delicacies to him.\n\nHarry Penrose had the 14th Platoon. Of the other three subalterns\nperhaps the most interesting was Hewett. He, like Harry, had been at\nOxford before the war, though they had never come together there. He was\na fair, dreamy person, of remarkably good looks. Alone of all the 'young\nApollos' I have known did he at all deserve that title. Most of these\nhave been men of surpassing stupidity and material tastes, but Hewett\nadded to his physical qualifications something of the mental refinement\nwhich presumably one should expect of even a modern Apollo. Intensely\nfastidious, he frankly detested the war, and all the dirt and disgust he\nmust personally encounter. Like Harry, he was an idealist--but more so;\nfor he could not idealize the war. But the shrinking of his spirit had\nno effect on his conduct: he was no less courageous than Harry or any\none else, and no less keen to see the thing through. Only, at that time,\nhe was a little less blind. A year senior to Harry, he had taken Greats\nin 1914, and though his degree had been disappointingly low he had not\nyet lost the passionate attachment of the 'Greats' man to philosophy and\nthoughts of the Ultimate Truths. Sometimes he would try to induce one of\nus to talk with him of his religious and philosophical doubts; but in\nthat feverish place it was too difficult for us, and usually he brooded\nover his problems alone.\n\nEustace, of the 16th Platoon, was a journalist by repute, though it was\nnever discovered to what journal, if any, he was specially attached. His\ncharacter was more attractive than his appearance, which was long,\nawkward, and angular; and if he had ever been to school, he would have\nbeen quite undeservedly unpopular for not playing games:\nundeservedly--because one could not conceive of him as playing any game.\nPhysically, indeed, he was one of Nature's gawks; intellectually he was\nnimble, not to say athletic, with an acute and deeply logical mind. As a\ncompanion, more especially a companion in war, he was made tedious by a\nhabit of cynicism and a passion for argument. The cynicism, I think, had\ndeveloped originally from some early grievance against Society, had been\nadopted as an effective pose, and had now become part of his nature.\nWhatever its origin it was wearing to us, for in the actual scenes of\nwar one likes to cling to one's illusions while any shred of them\nremains, and would rather they faded honourably under the gentle\ninfluence of time than be torn to fragments in a moment by reasoned\nmockery. But Eustace was never tired of exhibiting the frailty and\nsubterfuge of all men, particularly in their relations to the war; the\n_Nation_ arrived for him as regularly as the German submarines would\nallow, and all his views were in that sense distinctly 'National.' If\nany of us were rash enough to read that paper ourselves, we were\ninevitably provoked to some comment which led to a hot wrangle on the\nPublic Schools, or Kitchener, or the rights of the war, and the pleasant\ncalm of the dusk was marred. For Eustace could always meet us with a\npowerfully logical case, and while in spirit we revolted against his\nheresies, we were distressed by the appeal they made to our reluctant\nreasons. Harry, the most ingenuous of us all and the most devoted to his\nillusions, was particularly worried by this conflict. It seemed very\nwrong to him that a man so loyal and gallant in his personal relations\nwith others should trample so ruthlessly on their dearest opinions.\n\nBurnett was of a very different type. Tall and muscular, with reddish\nhair and vivid blue eyes, he looked (as he wanted to look) a 'man of\naction' by nature and practice. He had 'knocked about' for some years in\nAfrica and Australia (a process which had failed equally to establish\nhis fortunes or soften his rough edges), and from the first he affected\nthe patronizing attitude of the experienced campaigner. The little\ndiscomforts of camp life were nothing to him, for were they not part of\nhis normal life? And when I emerged from my dug-out pursued by a\ncentipede of incredible ferocity, he held forth for a long time on the\nbest method of dispatching rattlesnakes in the Umgoga, or some such\nlocality. By degrees, however, as life became more unbearable, the\nconviction dawned upon us that he was no less sensible to heat and\nhunger and thirst than mere 'temporary' campaigners, and rather more\nready to utter his complaints. Finally, the weight of evidence became\noverwhelming, and it was whispered at the end of our first week at\nGallipoli that 'Burnett was bogus.' The quality of being 'bogus' was in\nthose days the last word in military condemnation; and in Burnett's case\nevents showed the verdict to be lamentably correct.\n\nSo we were a strangely assorted crowd, only alike, as I have said, in\nthat we were keen on the winning of this war and resolved to do our\npersonal best towards that end. Of the five of us, Hewett and Eustace\nhad the most influence on Harry. Me he regarded as a solid kind of wall\nthat would never let him down, or be guilty of any startling deviations\nfrom the normal. By Hewett he was personally and spiritually attracted;\nby Eustace alternately fascinated and disturbed. And it was a very bad\nday for Harry when Hewett's death removed that gentle, comfortable\ninfluence.\n\n\nII\n\nWe were ordered to relieve the ----'s at midnight on the fourth day, and\nonce again we braced ourselves for the last desperate battle of our\nlives. All soldiers go through this process during their first weeks of\nactive service every time they 'move' anywhere. Immense expectations,\nvows, fears, prayers, fill their minds; and nothing particular happens.\nOnly the really experienced soldier knows that it is the exception and\nnot the rule for anything particular to happen; and the heroes of\nromance and history who do not move a muscle when told that they are to\nattack at dawn are generally quite undeserving of praise, since long\nexperience has taught them that the attack is many times more likely to\nbe cancelled than to occur. Until it actually does happen they will not\nbelieve in it; they make all proper preparations, but quite rightly do\nnot move a muscle. We, however, were now to have our first illustration\nof this great military truth. For, indeed, we were to have no battle.\nYet that night's march to the trenches was an experience that made full\ncompensation. It was already dusk when we moved out of the rest-camp,\nand the moon was not up. As usual in new units, the leading platoons\nwent off at a reckless canter, and stumbling after them in the gathering\nshadows over rocky, precipitous slopes, and in and out of the clumps of\nbush, falling in dark holes on to indignant sleepers, or maddeningly\nentangled in hidden strands of wire, the rear companies were speedily\nout of touch. To a heavily laden infantryman there are few things more\nexasperating than a night march into the line conducted too fast. If the\ncountry be broken and strewn with obstacles, at which each man must wait\nwhile another climbs or drops or wrestles or wades in front of him, and\nmust then laboriously scamper after him in the shadows lest he, and\nthereby all those behind him, be lost; if the country be unknown to him,\nso that, apart from purely military considerations, the fear of being\nlost is no small thing, for a man knows that he may wander all night\nalone in the dark, surrounded by unknown dangers, cut off from sleep,\nand rations, and the friendly voices of companions, a jest among them\nwhen he discovers them: then such a march becomes a nightmare.\n\nOn this night it dawned gradually on those in front that they were\nunaccompanied save by the 1st platoon, and a long halt, and much\nshouting and searching, gathered most of the regiment together, hot,\ncursing, and already exhausted. And now we passed the five white Water\nTowers, standing mysteriously in a swamp, and came out of the open\ncountry into the beginning of a gully. These 'gullies' were deep,\nsteep-sided ravines, driven through all the lower slopes of Achi Baba,\nand carrying in the spring a thin stream of water, peopled by many\nfrogs, down to the Straits or the sea. It was easier going here, for\nthere was a rough track beside the stream to follow; yet, though those\nin front were marching, as they thought, with inconceivable\ndeliberation, the rear men of each platoon were doubling round the\ncorners among the trees, and cursing as they ran. There was then a wild\nhail of bullets in all those gullies, since for many hours of each night\nthe Turk kept up a sustained and terrible rapid fire from his trenches\nfar up the hill, and, whether by design or bad shooting, the majority of\nthese bullets passed high over our trenches, and fell hissing in the\ngully-bed.\n\nSo now all the air seemed full of the humming, whistling things, and all\nround in the gully-banks and the bushes by the stream there were vicious\nspurts as they fell. It was always a marvel how few casualties were\ncaused by this stray fire, and to-night we were chiefly impressed with\nthis wonder. In the stream the frogs croaked incessantly with a note of\nweary indifference to the medley of competing noises. At one point there\nwas a kind of pot-hole in the stream where the water squeezing through\nmade a kind of high-toned wail, delivered with stabbing emphasis at\nregular intervals. So weird was this sound, which could be heard many\nhundred yards away, and gradually asserted itself above all other\ncontributions to that terrible din, that many of the men, already\nmystified and excited, said to themselves that this was the noise of the\nhideous explosive bullets of which they had heard.\n\nSoon we were compelled to climb out of the gully-path to make way for\nsome descending troops, and stumbled forward with a curious feeling of\nnakedness high up in open ground. Here the bullets were many times\nmultiplied, and many of us said that we could feel them passing between\nus. Indeed, one or two men were hit, but though we did not know it, most\nof these near-sounding bullets flew high above us. After a little we\nwere halted, and lay down, wondering, in the sibilant dark; then we\nmoved on and halted again, and realized suddenly that we were very\ntired. At the head of the column the guide had lost his way, and could\nnot find the entrance to the communication trench; and here in the most\nexposed area of all that Peninsula we must wait until he did. The march\nwas an avoidable piece of mismanagement; the whole regiment was being\nunnecessarily endangered. But none of this we knew; so very few men were\nafraid. For we were still in the bliss of ignorance. It seemed to us\nthat these strange proceedings must be a part of the everyday life of\nthe soldier. If they were not, we raw creatures should not have been\nasked to endure them. We had no standard of safety or danger by which to\nestimate our position; and so the miraculous immunity we were enjoying\nwas taken as a matter of course, and we were blissfully unafraid. At the\nsame time we were extremely bored and tired, and the sweat cooled on us\nin the chill night air. And when at last we came into the deep\ncommunication trench we felt that the end of this weariness must surely\nbe near. But the worst exasperations of relieving an unknown line were\nstill before us. It was a two-mile trudge in the narrow ditches to the\nfront line. No war correspondent has ever described such a march; it is\nnot included in the official 'horrors of war'; but this is the kind of\nthing which, more than battle and blood, harasses the spirit of the\ninfantryman, and composes his life. The communication trenches that\nnight were good and deep and dry, and free from the awfulness of mud;\nbut they were very few, and unintelligently used. There had been an\nattack that day, and coming by the same trench was a long stream of\nstretchers and wounded men, and odd parties coming to fetch water from\nthe well, and whole battalions relieved from other parts of the line.\nOur men had been sent up insanely with full packs; for a man so equipped\nto pass another naked in the narrow ditch would have been difficult;\nwhen all those that he meets have also straps and hooks and excrescences\nabout them, each separate encounter means heartbreaking entanglements\nand squeezes and sudden paroxysms of rage. That night we stood a total\nof hours hopelessly jammed in the suffocating trench, with other troops\ntrying to get down. A man stood in those crushes, unable to sit down,\nunable to lean comfortably against the wall because of his pack, unable\neven to get his hand to his water-bottle and quench his intolerable\nthirst, unable almost to breathe for the hot smell of herded humanity.\nOnly a thin ribbon of stars overhead, remotely roofing his prison,\nreminded him that indeed he was still in the living world and not\npursuing some hideous nightmare. At long last some one would take charge\nof the situation, and by sheer muscular fighting for space the two\nmasses would be extricated. Then one moved on again. And now each man\nhas become a mere lifeless automaton. Every few yards there is a wire\nhanging across the trench at the height of a man's eyes, and he runs\nblindly into it, or it catches in the piling-swivel of his rifle;\npainfully he removes it, or in a fit of fury tears the wire away with\nhim. Or there is a man lying in a corner with a wounded leg crying out\nto each passer-by not to tread on him, or a stretcher party slowly\nstruggling against the tide. Mechanically each man grapples with these\nobstacles, mechanically repeats the ceaseless messages that are passed\nup and down, and the warning 'Wire,' 'Stretcher party', 'Step up,' to\nthose behind, and stumbles on. He is only conscious of the dead weight\nof his load, and the braces of his pack biting into his shoulders, of\nhis thirst, and the sweat of his body, and the longing to lie down and\nsleep. When we halt men fall into a doze as they stand, and curse\npitifully when they are urged on from behind.\n\nWe reach the inhabited part of the line, and the obstacles become more\nfrequent, for there are traverses every ten yards and men sleeping on\nthe floor, and a litter of rifles, water-cans, and scattered equipment.\nFor ever we wind round the endless traverses, and squeeze past the\nendless host we are relieving; and sometimes the parapet is low or\nbroken or thin, or there is a dangerous gap, and we are told to keep our\nheads down, and dully pass back the message so that it reaches men\nmeaninglessly when they have passed the danger-point, or are still far\nfrom it. All the time there is a wild rattle of rapid fire from the\nTurks, and bullets hammer irritably on the parapet, or fly singing\noverhead. When a man reached his destined part of the trench that night\nthere were still long minutes of exasperation before him; for we were\ninexperienced troops, and first of all the men crowded in too far\ntogether, and must turn about, and press back so as to cover the whole\nground to be garrisoned; then they would flock like sad sheep too far in\nthe opposite direction. This was the subaltern's bad time; for the\nofficer must squeeze backwards and forwards, struggling to dispose\nproperly his own sullen platoon, and it was hard for him to be patient\nwith their stupidity, for, like them, he only longed to fling off his\ncursed equipment and lie down and sleep for ever. He, like them, had but\none thought, that if there were to be no release from the hateful burden\nthat clung to his back, and cut into his shoulders and ceaselessly\nimpeded him, if there were to be no relief for his thirst and the urgent\naching of all his body--he must soon sink down and scream....\n\n\nIII\n\nHarry's platoon was settled in when I found him, hidden away somewhere\nin the third (Reserve) line. He had conscientiously posted a few\nsentries, and done all those things which a good platoon commander\nshould do, and was lying himself in a sort of stupor of fatigue.\nPhysically he was not strong, rather frail, in fact, for the infantry;\nhe had a narrow chest and slightly round shoulders, and his heart would\nnot have passed any civilian doctor; and--from my own experience--I knew\nthat the march must have tried him terribly. But a little rest had\nsoothed the intense nervous irritation whose origins I have tried to\ndescribe, and his spirit was as sturdy as ever. He struggled to his feet\nand leaned over the parados with me. The moon was now high up in the\nnorth-east; the Turks had ceased their rapid fire at moonrise, and now\nan immense peace wrapped the Peninsula. We were high up on the centre\nslopes of Achi Baba, and all the six miles which other men had conquered\nlay bathed in moonlight below us. Far away at the cape we could see the\nlong, green lights of the hospital ships, and all about us were\nglow-worms in the scrub. Left and right the pale parapets of trenches\ncrept like dim-seen snakes into the little valleys, and vanished over\nthe opposite slopes. Only a cruiser off shore firing lazily at long\nintervals disturbed the slumberous stillness. No better sedative could\nhave been desired.\n\n'How did you like the march?' I said.\n\n'Oh, all right; one of my men was wounded, I believe, but I didn't see\nhim.'\n\n'All right?' I said. 'Personally I thought it was damned awful; it's a\nmarvel that any of us are here at all. I hear A Company's still adrift,\nas it is.'\n\n'Well, anyhow _we_ got here,' said Harry. 'What a wonderful spot this\nis. And look at those damned glow-worms.'\n\nI was anxious to know what impression the night had made on Harry, but\nthese and other answers gave me no real clue. I had a suspicion that it\nhad, in truth, considerably distressed him, but any such effect had\nclearly given way to the romantic appeal of the quiet moon. I, too, was\nenjoying the sense of peace, but I was still acutely conscious of the\nunpleasantness of the night's proceedings; and a certain envy took hold\nof me at this youth's capacity to concentrate on the attractive shadow\nof distasteful things. There was a heavy, musty smell over all this part\nof the trench, the smell of a dead Turk lying just over the parapet, and\nit occurred to me, maliciously, to wake Harry from his dreams, and bring\nhome to him the reality of things.\n\n'Funny smell you've got here, Harry,' I said; 'know what it is?'\n\n'Yes, it's cactus or amaryllis, or one of those funny plants they have\nhere, isn't it? I read about it in the papers.'\n\nThis was too much. 'It's a dead Turk,' I told him, with a wicked\nanticipation of the effect I should produce.\n\nThe effect, however, was not what I expected.\n\n'No!' said Harry, with obvious elation. 'Let's find the devil.'\n\nForthwith he swarmed over the parapet, full of life again, nosed about\ntill he found the reeking thing, and gazed on it with undisguised\ninterest. No sign of horror or disgust could I detect in him. Yet it was\nnot pure ghoulishness; it was simply the boy's greed for experience and\nthe savour of adventure. Anyhow, my experiment had failed; and I found\nthat I was glad. But when I was leaving him for the next platoon, he was\nlying down for a little sleep on the dirty floor of the trench, and as\nhe flashed his electric torch over the ground, I saw several small white\nobjects writhing in the dust. The company commander whom we had relieved\nhad told me how under all these trenches the Turks and the French had\nburied many of their dead, and in a moment of nauseating insight I knew\nthat these things were the maggots which fed upon their bodies.\n\n'Harry,' I said, 'you can't sleep there; look at those things!' And I\ntold him what they were.\n\n'Rubbish,' he said, 'they're glow-worms gone to sleep.'\n\nWell, then I left him. But that's how he was in those days.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSo many men have written descriptions of trench life in France; there\nhave been so many poems, plays, and speeches about it that the majority\nof our nation must have a much clearer mental picture of life on the\nWestern Front than they have of life at the Savoy, or life in East Ham.\nBut the Gallipoli Peninsula was never part of the Western Front, and no\nman came back from that place on leave; lucky, indeed, if he came at\nall. The campaign was never, for obvious reasons, an important item in\nofficial propaganda, and the various non-official agencies which now\nbring home the war to Streatham had not begun to articulate when the\ncampaign came to an end. And so neither Streatham nor any one else knew\nanything about it. And though for a soldier to speak, however distantly,\nof the details of trench life in France, is now in some circles\nconsidered a solecism equivalent to the talking of 'shop,' I hope I may\nstill without offence make some brief reference to the trenches of the\nPeninsula. For, in truth, it was all very different. Above all, from\ndawn to dawn it was genuine infantry warfare. In France, apart from\nfull-dress attacks, an infantryman may live for many months without once\nfiring his rifle, or running the remotest risk of death by a rifle\nbullet. Patiently he tramps, and watches, and digs, and is shelled,\nclinging fondly to his rifle night and day, but seldom or never in a\nposition to use it; so that in the stagnant days of the past he came to\nlook upon it as a mere part of his equipment, like his water-bottle,\nonly heavier and less comforting; and in real emergencies fumbled\nstupidly with the unfamiliar mechanism. This was true for a long time of\nthe normal, or 'peace-time,' sectors of France.\n\nBut in those hill-trenches of Gallipoli the Turk and the Gentile fought\nwith each other all day with rifle and bomb, and in the evening crept\nout and stabbed each other in the dark. There was no release from the\nstrain of watching and listening and taking thought. The Turk was always\non higher ground; he knew every inch of all those valleys and vineyards\nand scrub-strewn slopes; and he had an uncanny accuracy of aim.\nMoreover, many of his men had the devotion of fanatics, which inspired\nthem to lie out behind our lines, with stores of food enough to last out\ntheir ammunition, certain only of their own ultimate destruction, but\ncontent to lie there and pick off the infidels till they too died. They\nwere very brave men. But the Turkish snipers were not confined to the\nmadmen who were caught disguised as trees in the broad daylight and\nfound their way into the picture papers. Every trench was full of\nsnipers, less theatrical, but no less effective. And in the night they\ncrept out with unbelievable stealth and lay close in to our lines,\nkilling our sentries, and chipping away our crumbling parapets.\n\nSo the sniping was terrible. In that first week we lost twelve men each\nday; they fell without a sound in the early morning as they stood up\nfrom their cooking at the brazier, fell shot through the head, and lay\nsnoring horribly in the dust; they were sniped as they came up the\ncommunication trench with water, or carelessly raised their heads to\nlook back at the ships in the bay; and in the night there were sudden\nscreams where a sentry had moved his head too often against the moon. If\na periscope were raised, however furtively, it was shivered in an\ninstant; if a man peered over himself, he was dead. Far back in the\nReserve Lines or at the wells, where a man thought himself hidden from\nview, the sniper saw and killed him. All along the line were\ndanger-posts where many had been hit; these places became invested with\na peculiar awe, and as you came to them the men said, 'Keep low here,\nsir,' in a mysterious whisper, as though the Turk could hear them.\nIndeed, so uncanny were many of the deaths, that some men said the Turk\ncould see impossibly through the walls of the trench, and crouched\nnervously in the bottom. All the long communication trenches were\nwatched, and wherever a head or a moving rifle showed at a gap a bullet\ncame with automatic regularity. Going down a communication-trench alone\na man would hear the tap of these bullets on the parapet following him\nalong, and break into a half-hysterical run in the bright sunlight to\nget away from this unnatural pursuit; for such it seemed to him to be.\n\nThe fire seemed to come from all angles; and units bitterly accused\ntheir neighbours of killing their men when it seemed impossible that any\nTurk could have fired the shot.\n\nFor a little, then, this sniping was thoroughly on the men's nerves.\nNothing in their training had prepared them for it. They hated the\n'blinded' feeling it produced; it was demoralizing always to be\nwondering if one's head was low enough, always to walk with a stoop; it\nwas tiring to be always taking care; and it was very dangerous to relax\nthat care for a moment. Something had to be done; and the heavy,\nmethodical way in which these Tynesiders of ours learned to counter and\nfinally overcome the sniper, is characteristic of the nation's effort\nthroughout this war. The Turks were natural soldiers, fighting in their\nown country; more, they were natural scouts. Our men were ponderous,\nuncouth pitmen from Tyneside and the Clyde. But we chose out a small\nbody of them who could shoot better than their fellows, and called them\nsnipers, and behold, they _were_ snipers. We gave them telescopes, and\nperiscopes, and observers, and set them in odd corners, and told them to\nsnipe. And by slow degrees they became interested and active and expert,\nand killed many Turks. The third time we came to those trenches we could\nmove about with comparative freedom.\n\nIn all this Harry took a leading part, for the battalion scout officer\nwas one of the first casualties, and Harry, who had had some training as\na scout in the ranks, was appointed in his place. In this capacity he\nwas in charge of the improvised snipers, and all day moved about the\nline from post to post, encouraging and correcting. All this he did with\ncharacteristic energy and enthusiasm, and tired himself out with long\nwanderings in the scorching sun. In those trenches all movement was an\nintense labour. The sun blazed always into the suffocating ditch, where\nno breath of air came; the men not on duty lay huddled wherever they\ncould steal an inch of shade, with the flies crawling about their eyes\nand open mouths. Progress was a weary routine of squeezing past men, or\nstepping over men, or running into men round corners, as one stooped to\nescape death. In little niches in the wall were mess-tins boiling over\nbox-wood fires, so that the eyes smarted from their smoke, and the air\nwas full of the hot fumes; and everywhere was the stuffy smell of human\nflesh. In the heat of the day these things produced in the healthiest\nman an intolerable irritation and fatigue: to a frail, sensitive youth\nlike Harry his day-long rambles must have been torture; but though he\ntoo became touchy he pursued his task with determination, and would not\nbe tempted away. The rest of us, when not on watch, lay torpid all the\nhot hours in the shallow holes we had scratched behind the trench, and\ncalled Company Headquarters. These places were roofed only with the\ninevitable waterproof sheet, and, had there been any serious shelling,\nwould have been death-traps. Into these dwellings came many strange\nanimals, driven from their nests among the roots of the scrub--snakes,\nlizards, and hideous centipedes. Large, clumsy, winged things, which\nsome said were locusts, fell into the trench, and for a few hours strove\nvainly to leap out again till they were trampled to death; they had the\ncolour of ivory, and shone with bright tints in the sun like shot silk.\nThe men found tortoises derelict in near shell-holes, and set them to\nwalk in the trench, and they too wandered sadly about till they\ndisappeared, no man knew where. The flies were not yet at full strength,\nbut they were very bad; and all day we wrestled with thirst. He was a\nlucky man who could sleep in the daylight hours, and when the cool\nevening came, beckoning him to sleep, he must rise and bestir himself\nfor the work of the night.\n\nThen all the line stirred with life again, with the cleaning of rifles\nthick with heavy dust, and the bustle of men making ready to 'Stand to\nArms.' Now, indeed, could a man have slept when all the pests of the day\nhad been exorcized by the cool dusk, and the bitter cold of the midnight\nwas not yet come. But there was no sleep for any man, only watching and\ndigging and carrying and working and listening. And so soon as Achi Baba\nwas swathed in shadow, and the sun well down behind the westward\nislands, the Turk began his evening fusillade of rapid fire. This was an\nastonishing performance. Night after night at this hour every man in his\ntrench must have blazed away till his rifle would do its work no more.\n'Rapid fire' has been a speciality of the Turkish infantryman since the\ndays of Plevna, and indeed he excels in it. Few English units could\nequal his performance for ten minutes; but the Turk kept up the same\nsustained deafening volume of fire for hours at a stretch, till the moon\ncame up and allayed his fears. For it was an exhibition of nervousness\nas well as musketry: fearful of a stealthy assault in the dark, he would\nnot desist till he could see well across his own wire. Captured orders\nby the Turkish High Command repeatedly forbade this reckless expenditure\nof ammunition, and sometimes for two nights he would restrain himself,\nbut in the early days never for more. Our policy was to lie down in the\ntrench, and think sardonically of the ammunition he was wasting; but\neven this was not good for men's minds. Most of the fire was high and\nwhizzed over into the gullies, but many hundreds of all those thousands\nof bullets hit the parapet. There was a steady, reiterant rap of them on\nthe sand-bags, very irritating to the nerves, and bits of the parapet\nsplashed viciously into the trench over the crouching men. In that\ntornado of sound a man must shout to make himself heard by his friends,\nand this produced in his mind an uncomfortable sense of isolation; he\nseemed cut off from humanity, and brooded secretly to himself. Safe he\nmight be in that trench, but he could not long sit alone in that\ntempestuous security without imagining himself in other\ncircumstances--climbing up the parapet--leaving the trench--walking into\nTHAT. So on the few murky nights when the moon would not show herself\nbut peeped temptingly from behind large bolsters of cloud, so that even\nthe Turks diminished their fire, and then with a petulant crescendo\ncontinued, men lay in the dust and prayed for the moon to come. So\ndemoralizing was this fire that it was not easy to induce even sentries\nto keep an effective watch. Not unnaturally, they did not like lifting\ntheir heads to look over, even for the periodical peeps which were\ninsisted upon. An officer on his rounds would find them standing on the\nfirestep with their heads well below the parapet, but gazing intently\ninto the heart of a sand-bag, with the air of a man whom no movement of\nthe enemy can escape. The officer must then perform the melancholy rite\nof 'showing the man how safe it is.' This consisted in climbing up to\nthe firestep, and exposing an immoderate amount of his head; gazing\ndeliberately at the Turks, and striving to create an impression of\nindifference and calm. He then jumped down, shouting cheerily, 'That's\nthe way, Thompson,' and walked off, thanking God. Personally I did not\nlike this duty. At the best it was an hypocrisy. For the reluctance of\nthe officer to look over was no less acute than the man's; and it was\none thing to look for a moment or two and pass on, and another to stand\nthere and repeat the process at brief intervals. Officers performed this\nrite according to their several characters: Eustace, for example, with a\ncynical grin which derided, with equal injustice, both himself and his\naction; he was notably courageous, and his nonchalance on the parapet\nwould have been definitely reassuring to the nervous sentry. But his\nexpression and attitude said clearly: 'This is all damned nonsense, my\ngood man; _you_ don't like standing up here, neither do I, and neither\nof us is deceiving the other at all.' Burnett did it with genuine and\nill-concealed distaste, too hasty to be convincing. Harry, alone, did it\nwith a gallant abandon, like a knight throwing down his challenge to the\nenemy; and he alone can have been really inspiring to the reluctant\nsentry. He had a keen dramatic instinct, and in these little scenes\nrather enjoyed the part of the unperturbed hero calming the timorous\nherd. Watching him once or twice I wondered how much was acting and how\nmuch real fearlessness; if it was acting he was braver then than most of\nus--but I think it was the other just then.\n\nThere were five or six hours between the end of the rapid fire and the\n'Stand to' before dawn. During these hours three of the company officers\nwere always on duty. We split the time in two, and it was a weary three\nhours patrolling the still trench, stumbling over sleeping men, sprawled\nout like dead in the moonlight, and goading the tired sentries to\nwatchfulness. Terrible was the want of sleep. The men fell asleep with\ntheir heads against the iron loopholes, and, starting up as the officer\nshook them, swore that they had never nodded. Only by constant movement\ncould the officer be sure even of himself; he dared not sit for a moment\nor lean in the corner of the traverse, though all his limbs ached for\nrest, lest he, too, be found snoring at his post, and he and all his men\nbe butchered in their guilty sleep. And so he drags his sore feet\nceaselessly backwards and forwards, marvelling at the stillness and the\nstars and the strange, musky night smell which has crept out of the\nearth. Far away he can see the green lights of a hospital ship, and as\nhe looks they begin to move and dwindle slowly into the distance, for\nshe is going home; and he thinks of the warmth and light and comfort in\nthat ship, and follows her wistfully with his eyes till she is gone.\nTurning back he sees a sentry, silent above him; he, too, is watching\nthe ship, and each man knows the other's thoughts, but they do not\nspeak.\n\nAt last comes the officer relieving him; cold and irritable from his\nbrief sleep. He is a little late, and they compare watches resentfully;\nand unless they be firm friends, at that moment they hate each other.\nBut the one who is relieved goes down to the dug-out in the Support\nLine, a little jauntily now, though his feet are painful, feeling\nalready that he could watch many hours more. And suddenly the moon is\nbeautiful, and the stars are friendly--for he is going to sleep. But\nwhen he comes to the little narrow hole, which is the dug-out, there are\ntwo officers already filling most of the floor, noisily asleep. One of\nthem is lying on his waterproof sheet: he tugs angrily at it, but it is\ncaught in something and will not come away. He shakes the man, but he\ndoes not wake. Too tired to continue he lies down awkwardly in the\ncrooked space which is left between the legs and arms and equipment of\nthe others. He draws his meagre trench-coat over his body, and pulls his\nknees up that they, too, may be covered; there is nothing over his feet,\nand already they are cold. His head he rests on a rough army haversack.\nIn the middle of it there is a hard knob, a soap-tin, or a book, or a\ntin of beef. For a little he lies uncomfortably like this, hoping for\nsleep; his ear is crushed on the hard pillow; there is something knobbly\nunder his hip. He knows that he ought to get up and re-arrange\nhimself--but he lacks the necessary energy. Finally he raises himself on\nhis elbow and tugs at the towel in his haversack to make him a pillow;\nthe strap of the haversack is fastened, and the towel will not emerge.\nHe unfastens the haversack, and in desperation pulls out the whole of\nits contents with the towel. His toothbrush and his sponge and his diary\nare scattered in the dust. Some of the pages of the diary are loose, and\nif he leaves it they will be lost; he feels in the darkness for his\nelectric torch, and curses because he cannot find it. He has lent it to\nthe damned fool who relieved him. Why can't people have things of their\nown?\n\nPainfully groping he gathers his belongings and puts them, one by one,\nin the haversack, arranging his towel on the top. His elbow is sore with\nleaning on it, but the pillow is ready. Lying down again he falls\nquickly to sleep. Almost at once there is a wild din in his dreams.\nRapid fire again. Springing up, he rushes into the trench with the\nothers. It is an attack. Who is attacking? The men in the trench know\nnothing. It started on the right, they say, and now the whole line is\nablaze again with this maddening rifle-fire. Running back to the dug-out\nhe gropes in the wreckage of coats and equipment for his belt and\nrevolver. He must hurry to the front line to take charge of his platoon.\nThere are no telephones to the firing-line. What the hell is happening?\nWhen he is halfway up the communication trench, cannoning into the walls\nin his haste and weariness, the firing suddenly stops. It was a wild\npanic started by the Senegalese holding the line on our right. Damn\nthem--black idiots!\n\nHe goes back swearing with the other officers, and they lie down anyhow;\nit is too late now to waste time on fussy arrangements. When he wakes up\nagain there is already a hint of light in the East. It is the 'Stand to\nArms' before dawn. His feet are numb and painful with cold, his limbs\nare cramped and aching, and his right forearm has gone to sleep. The\nflesh of his legs is clammy, and sticks to the breeches he has lived and\nslept in for five days: he longs for a bath. Slowly with the others he\nraises himself and gropes weakly in the muddle of garments on the floor\nfor his equipment. He cannot find his revolver. Burnett has lost his\nbelt, and mutters angrily to himself. All their belongings are entangled\ntogether in the narrow space; they disengage them without speaking to\neach other. Each one is in a dull coma of endurance; for the moment\ntheir spirit is at its lowest ebb; it is the most awful moment of\nwarfare. In a little they will revive, but just now they cannot pretend\nto bravery or cheerfulness, only curse feebly and fumble in the\ndarkness.\n\nThey go out into the trench and join their platoons. The N.C.O.'s are\nstill shaking and bullying the men still asleep; some of these are\nalmost senseless, and can only be roused by prolonged physical violence.\nThe officer braces himself for his duties, and by and by all the men are\nmore or less awake and equipped, though their heads droop as they sit,\nand their neighbours nudge them into wakefulness as the officer\napproaches. Mechanically he fills and lights a pipe, and takes a\ncautious sip at his water-bottle; the pipe turns his empty stomach, and\nan intolerable emptiness assails him. He knocks out the pipe and peers\nover the parapet. It is almost light now, but a thin mist hides the\nTurkish trench. His face is greasy and taut with dirt, and the corners\nof his eyes are full of dust; his throat is dry, and there is a\nloathsome stubble on his chin, which he fingers absently, pulling at the\nlong hairs.\n\nSteadily the light grows and grows, and the men begin to chatter, and\nsuddenly the sun emerges over the corner of Achi Baba, and life and\nwarmth come back to the numb souls of all these men. 'Stand to' is over;\nbut as the men tear off their hateful equipment and lean their rifles\nagainst the wall of the trench there is a sudden burst of shelling on\nthe right. Figures appear running on the skyline. They are against the\nlight, and the shapes are dark, but there seems to be a dirty blue in\ntheir uniforms. No one quite knows how the line runs up there; it is a\nsalient. The figures must be Turks attacking the French. The men gape\nover the parapet. The officer gapes. It is nothing to do with them. Then\nhe remembers what he is for, and tells his men excitedly to fire on the\nfigures. Some of the men have begun cooking their breakfast, and are\nwith difficulty seduced from their task. A spasmodic fire opens on the\nrunning figures. It is hard to say where they are running, or what they\nare doing. The officer is puzzled. It is his first glimpse of battle,\nand he feels that a battle should be simple and easy to understand. The\nofficer of the next platoon comes along. He is equally ignorant of\naffairs, but he thinks the figures are French, attacking the Turks.\nThey, too, wear blue. The first officer rushes down the line telling the\nmen to 'cease fire.' The men growl and go back to their cooking. It is\nfairly certain that none of them hit any of the distant figures, but the\nofficer is worried. Why was nobody told what was to happen? What is it\nall about? He has been put in a false position. Presently a belated chit\narrives to say that the French were to attack at sunrise, but the attack\nwas a fiasco, and is postponed.\n\nAnd now all the air is sickly with the smell of cooking, and the dry\nwood crackles in every corner; little wisps of smoke go straight up in\nthe still air. All the Peninsula is beautiful in the sunlight, and\nwonderful to look upon against the dark blue of the sea; the dew\nsparkles on the scrub; over the cypress grove comes the first aeroplane,\nhumming contentedly. Another day has begun; the officer goes down\nwhistling to wash in a bucket.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nSuch was life in the line at that time. But I should make the soldier's\nalmost automatic reservation, that it might have been worse. There might\nhave been heavy shelling; but the shelling on the trenches was\nnegligible--then; there might have been mud, but there was not. And\neight such days might have left Harry Penrose quite unaffected in\nspirit, in spite of his physical handicaps, by reason of his\nextraordinary vitality and zest. But there were two incidents before we\nwent down which did affect him, and it is necessary that they should be\ntold.\n\nOn the fifth day in the line he did a very brave thing--brave, at least,\nin the popular sense, which means that many another man would not have\ndone that thing. To my mind, a man is brave only in proportion to his\nknowledge and his susceptibility to fear; the standard of the mob, the\nstandard of the official military mind, is absolute; there are no fine\nshades--no account of circumstance and temperament is allowed--and\nperhaps this is inevitable. Most men would say that Harry's deed was a\nbrave one. I have said so myself--but I am not sure.\n\nEighty to a hundred yards from one section of our line was a small\nstretch of Turkish trench, considerably in advance of their main line.\nFrom this trench a particularly harassing fire was kept up, night and\nday, and the Brigade Staff considered that it should be captured. High\nofficers in shirt sleeves and red hats looked long and wisely at it\nthrough periscopes; colonels and adjutants and subalterns and sergeants\nstood silent and respectful while the great men pondered. The great men\nthen turned round with the air of those who make profound decisions, and\nannounced that 'You ought to be able to \"enfilade\" it from \"over\nthere,\"' or 'I suppose they \"enfilade\" you from there.' The term\n'enfilade' invariably occurred somewhere in these dicta, and in the\nlisteners' minds there stirred the suspicion that the Great Ones had not\nbeen looking at the right trench; if indeed they had focused the\nunfamiliar instrument so as to see anything at all. But the decision was\nmade; and for the purposes of a night attack it was important to know\nwhether the trench was held strongly at night, or occupied only by a few\nbusy snipers. Harry was ordered to reconnoitre the trench with two\nscouts.\n\nThe night was pitch black, with an unusual absence of stars. The worst\nof the rapid fire was over, but there was a steady spit and crackle of\nbullets from the Turks, and especially from the little trench opposite.\nLong afterwards, in France, he told me that he would never again dream\nof going out on patrol in the face of such a fire. But to-night it did\nnot occur to him to delay his expedition. The profession of scouting\nmade a special appeal to the romantic side of him; the prospect of some\nreal, practical scouting was exciting. According to the books much\nscouting was done under heavy fire, but according to the books, and in\nthe absence of any experience to the contrary, it was probable that the\ncareful scout would not be killed. Then why waste time? (All this I\ngathered indirectly from his account of the affair.) Two bullets smacked\ninto the parapet by his head as he climbed out of the dark sap and\nwriggled forward into the scrub; but even these did not give him pause.\nOnly while he lay and waited for the two men to follow did he begin to\nrealize how many bullets were flying about. The fire was now really\nheavy, and when I heard that Harry had gone out, I was afraid. But he as\nyet was only faintly surprised. The Colonel had sent him out; the\nColonel had said the Turks fired high, and if you kept low you were\nquite safe--and he ought to know. This was a regular thing in warfare,\nand must be done. So on like reptiles into the darkness, dragging with\nhands and pushing with knees. Progress in the orthodox scout fashion was\nsurprisingly slow and exhausting. The scrub tickled and scratched your\nface, the revolver in your hands caught in the roots; the barrel must be\nchoked with dust. Moreover, it was impossible to see anything at all,\nand the object of a reconnaissance being to see something, this was\nperplexing. Even when the frequent flares went up and one lay pressed to\nthe earth, one's horizon was the edge of a tuft of scrub five yards\naway. This always looked like the summit of some commanding height; but\nlabouring thither one saw by the next flare only another exactly similar\nhorizon beyond. So must the worm feel, wandering in the rugged spaces of\na well-kept lawn. It was long before Harry properly understood this\nphenomenon; and by then his neck was stiff and aching from lying flat\nand craning his head back to see in front. But after many hours of\ncrawling the ground sloped down a little, and now they could see the\nsharp, stabbing flashes from the rifles of the snipers in the little\ntrench ahead of them. Clearly they were only snipers, for the flashes\ncame from only eight or nine particular spots, spaced out at intervals.\n_Now_ the scouts glowed with the sense of achievement as they watched.\nThey had found out. Never again could Harry have lain like that, naked\nin the face of those near rifles, coldly calculating and watching,\nwithout an effort of real heroism. On this night he did it\neasily--confident, unafraid. Elated with his little success, something\nprompted him to go farther and confirm his deductions. He whispered to\nhis men to lie down in a fold of the ground, and crept forward to the\nvery trench itself, aiming at a point midway between two flashes. There\nwas no wire in front of the trench, but as he saw the parapet looming\nlike a mountain close ahead, he began to realize what a mad fool he was,\nalone and helpless within a yard of the Turks, an easy mark in the light\nof the next flare. But he would not go back, and squirming on worked his\nhead into a gap in the parapet, and gazed into a vast blackness. This he\ndid with a wild incautiousness, the patience of the true scout overcome\nby his anxiety to do what he intended as soon as possible. The Turks'\nown rifles had drowned the noise of his movements, and providentially no\nflare went up till his body was against the parapet. When at length the\nfaint wavering light began and swelled into sudden brilliance, he could\nsee right into the trench, and when the shadows chased each other back\ninto its depths as the light fell, he lay marvelling at his own\naudacity: so impressed was he by the wonder of his exploit that he was\nincapable of making any intelligent observations, other than the bald\nfact that there were no men in that part of the trench. He was still\nwaiting for another flare when there was a burst of rapid fire from our\nown line a little to the right. Suddenly he realized that B Company _did\nnot know he was out_; C Company knew, but in his haste he had forgotten\nto see that the others were informed before he left, as he had arranged\nto do with the Colonel. He and his scouts would be shot by B Company.\nObsessed with this thought he turned and scrambled breathlessly back to\nthe two waiting men. God knows why he wasn't seen and sniped; and his\nretirement must have been very noisy, for as he reached the others all\nthe snipers in the trench opened fire feverishly together. Harry and his\nmen, who were cold with waiting, wriggled blindly back; they no longer\npretended to any deliberation or cunning, but having come to no harm so\nfar were not seriously anxious about themselves; only it seemed good to\ngo back now. But after a few yards one of the men, Trower, gave a scream\nof agony and cried out, 'I'm hit, I'm hit.'\n\nIn that moment, Harry told me, all the elation and pride of his exploit\nebbed out of him. A sick disgust with himself and everything came over\nhim. Williams, the other scout, lay between him and Trower, who was now\nmoaning horribly in the darkness. For a moment Harry was paralysed; he\nlay there, saying feebly, 'Where are you hit? Where is he hit, Williams?\nWhere are you hit?' When at last he got to his side, the man was almost\nunconscious with pain, but he had managed to screech out 'Both legs.' In\nfact, he had been shot through the femoral artery, and one leg was\nbroken. In that blackness skilled hands would have had difficulty in\nbandaging any wound; Harry and Williams could not even tell where his\nwound was, for all his legs were wet and sticky with blood. But both of\nthem were fumbling and scratching at their field-dressings for some\nmoments before they realized this. Then they started to take the man in,\nhalf dragging, half carrying him. At every movement the man shrieked in\nagony. When they stood up to carry him bodily, he screamed so piercingly\nthat the storm of bullets was immediately doubled about them. When they\nlay down and dragged him he screamed less, but progress was impossibly\nslow. And now it seemed that there were Turks in the open scrub about\nthem, for there were flashes and loud reports at strangely close\nquarters. The Turks could not see the miserable little party, but\nTrower's screams were an easy guide. Then Harry bethought him of the\nlittle medical case in his breast-pocket where, with needles and aspirin\nand plaster and pills, was a small phial of morphine tablets. For\nTrower's sake and their own, his screaming must be stilled. Tearing open\nhis pocket he fumbled at the elastic band round the case. The little\nphial was smaller than the rest; he knew where it lay. But the case was\nupside-down; all the phials seemed the same size. Trembling, he pulled\nout the cork and shook out one of the tablets into his hand; a bullet\ncracked like a whip over his head; the tablet fell in the scrub. He got\nanother out and passed it over to Williams. Williams's hand was shaking,\nand he dropped it. Harry groaned. The next two were safely transferred\nand pressed into Trower's mouth: he did not know how strong they were,\nbut he remembered vaguely seeing 'One or two' on the label, and at that\nblack moment the phrase came curiously into his head, 'As ordered by the\ndoctor.' Trower was quieter now, and this made the other two a little\ncalmer. Harry told me he was now so cool that he could put the phial\nback carefully in the case and return them to his pocket; even, from\nsheer force of habit, he buttoned up the pocket. But when they moved off\nthey realized with a new horror that they were lost. They had come out\noriginally from the head of a long sap; in the darkness and the\nexcitement they had lost all sense of direction, and had missed the sap.\nProbably they were not more than fifty yards from friends, but they\nmight be moving parallel to the sap or parallel to the front line, and\nthat way they might go on indefinitely. They could not drag their\nwretched burden with them indefinitely; so Harry sent Williams to find\nthe trench, and lay throbbing by the wounded man. No one who has not\nbeen lost in the pitchy dark in No Man's Land can understand how easy it\nis to arrive at that condition, and the intense feeling of helplessness\nit produces. That solitary wait of Harry's must have been terrible; for\nhe had time now to ponder his position. Perhaps Williams would not find\nthe trench; perhaps he, too, would be hit; perhaps he would not be able\nto find the scouts again. What should they do then? Anything was\npossible in this awful darkness, with these bullets cracking and tearing\nabout him. Perhaps he would be killed himself. Straining his ears he\nfancied he could hear the rustle of creeping men, any moment he expected\na rending blow on his own tender body. But his revolver had been dropped\nin the dragging of Trower. He could do nothing--only try to bind up the\npoor legs again. Poor Harry! as he lay there bandaging his scout, he\nnoticed that the lad had stopped moaning, and said to himself that his\nmorphine tablets had done their work. That was something, anyhow. But\nthe man was already dead. He could not have lived for ten minutes, the\ndoctor told me. And when Williams at last returned, trailing a long\nstring from the sap, it was a dead man they brought painfully into the\ntrench and handed over gently to the stretcher-bearers.\n\nI was in the sap when they came, and dragged Harry away from it. And\nwhen they told him he nearly cried.\n\n\nII\n\nThe other incident is briefly told. On our last day in the line Harry's\nplatoon were working stealthily in the hot sun at a new section of\ntrench connecting two saps, and some one incautiously threw a little\nnew-turned earth over the parapet. The Turks, who seldom molested any of\nthe regular, established trenches with shell-fire, but hotly resented\nthe making of new ones, opened fire with a light high-velocity gun, of\nthe whizz-bang type. This was our first experience of the weapon, and\nthe first experience of a whizz-bang is very disturbing. The long shriek\nof the ordinary shell encourages the usually futile hope that by ducking\none may avoid destruction. With the whizz-bang there is no hope, for\nthere is no warning; the sound and the shell arrive almost\nsimultaneously. Harry's platoon did not like these things. The first\nthree burst near but short of the trench, filling the air with fumes;\nthe fourth hit and removed most of the parapet of one bay. Harry,\nhurrying along to the place, found the four men there considerably\nsurprised, crouching in the corners and gazing stupidly at the yawning\ngap. It was undesirable, if not impossible, to rebuild the parapet\nduring daylight, so he moved them into the next bay. He then went along\nthe trench to see that all the men had ceased work. He heard two more\nshells burst behind him as he went. On his way back two men rushing\nround a corner--two men with white faces smeared with black and a little\nblood--almost knocked him down; they were speechless. He went through\nthe bay which had been blown in; it was silent, empty; the bay beyond\nwas silent too, save for the buzzing of a thousand flies. In it he had\nleft eight men; six of them were lying dead. Two had marvellously\nescaped. The first whizz-bang had blown away the parapet; the second,\nfollowing immediately after, had passed miraculously through the hole,\nstraight into the trench--a piece of astounding bad luck or good\ngunnery. The men could not be buried till dusk, and we left them there.\n\nTwo hours later, as we sat under a waterproof sheet and talked quietly\nof this thing, there came an engineer officer wandering along the\ntrench. He had come, crouching, through those two shattered and yawning\nbays: he was hot and very angry. 'Why the hell don't you bury those\nTurks?' he said, 'they must have been there for weeks!' This is the kind\nof charge which infuriates the soldier at any time; and we did not like\nthe added suggestion that those six good men of the 14th Platoon were\ndead Turks. We told him they were Englishmen, dead two hours. 'But, my\nGod, man,' he said, 'they're black!' We led him back, incredulous, to\nthe place.\n\nWhen we got there we understood. Whether from the explosion or the\nscorching sun in that airless place, I know not, but those six men were,\nas he said, literally black--black and reeking and hideous--and the\nflies...!\n\nHarry and I crouched at the end of that bay, truly unable to believe our\neyes. I hope I may never again see such horror as was in Harry's face.\nThey were his platoon, and he knew them, as an officer should. After the\nexplosion, there had been only four whom he could definitely identify.\nNow there was not one. In two hours...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI do not wish to labour this or any similar episode. I have seen many\nworse things; every soldier has. In a man's history they are important\nonly in their effect upon him, and the effect they have is determined by\nmany things--by his experience, and his health, and his state of mind.\nBut if you are to understand what I may call the battle-psychology of a\nman, as I want you to understand Harry's, you must not ignore particular\nincidents. For in this respect the lives of soldiers are not uniform;\nthough many may live in the same regiment and fight in the same battles,\nthe experiences which matter come to them diversely--to some crowded and\noverwhelming, to some by kind and delicate degrees. And so do their\nspirits develop.\n\nThese two incidents following so closely upon each other had a most\nunhappy cumulative effect on Harry. His night's scouting, in spite of\nits miserable end, had not perceptibly dimmed his romantic outlook; it\nhad been an adventure, and from a military point of view a successful\nadventure. The Colonel had been pleased with the reconnaissance, as\nsuch. But the sight of his six poor men, lying black and beastly in that\nsunlit hole, had killed the 'Romance of War' for him. Henceforth it must\nbe a necessary but disgusting business, to be endured like a dung-hill.\nBut this, in the end, was inevitable; with all soldiers it is only a\nmatter of time, though for a boy of Harry's temperament it was an ill\nchance that it should come so soon.\n\nWhat was more serious was this. The two incidents had revived, in a most\nmalignant form, his old distrust of his own competence. I found that he\nwas brooding over this--accusing himself, quite wrongly, I think, of\nbeing responsible for the death of seven men. He had bungled the\nscouting; he had recklessly attracted attention to the party, and\nTrower, not he, had paid for it. He had moved four men into a bay where\nfour others already were, and six of them had been killed. I tried hard\nto persuade him, not quite honestly, that he had done absolutely the\nright thing. In scouting, of all things, I told him, a man _must_ take\nchances; and the matter of the two whizz-bangs was sheer bad luck. It\nwas no good; he was a fool--a failure. Unconsciously, the Colonel\nencouraged this attitude. For, thinking that Harry's nerve might well\nhave been shaken by his first experience, he would not let him go out on\npatrol again on our next 'tour' in the line. I think he was quite\nmistaken in this view, for the boy did not even seem to realize how\nnarrow his own escapes had been, so concerned was he about his lost men.\nNor did this explanation of the Colonel's veto even occur to him. Rather\nit confirmed him in his distrust of himself, for it seemed to him that\nthe Colonel, too, must look upon him as a bungler, a waster of men's\nlives....\n\nAll this was very bad, and I was much afraid of what the reaction might\nbe. But there was one bright spot. So far he only distrusted his\nmilitary capacity; there was no sign of his distrusting his own courage.\nI prayed that that might not follow.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nMid-June came with all its plagues and fevers and irritable distresses.\nLife in the rest-camp became daily more intolerable. There set in a\nsteady wind from the north-east which blew all day down the flayed\nrest-areas of the Peninsula, raising great columns of blinding,\nmaddening dust. It was a hot, parching wind, which in no way mitigated\nthe scorch of the sun, and the dust it brought became a definite enemy\nto human peace. It pervaded everything. It poured into every hole and\ndug-out, and filtered into every man's belongings; it formed a gritty\nsediment in water and tea, it passed into a man with every morsel of\nfood he ate, and scraped and tore at his inside. It covered his pipe so\nthat he could not even smoke with pleasure; it lay in a thick coating on\nhis face so that he looked like a wan ghost, paler than disease had made\nhim. It made the cleaning of his rifle a too, too frequent farce; it\nworked under his breeches, and gathered at the back of his knees,\nchafing and torturing him; and if he lay down to sleep in his hole it\nswept in billows over his face, or men passing clumsily above kicked\ngreat showers upon him. Sleep was not possible in the rest-camps while\nthat wind blew. But indeed there were many things which made rest in the\nrest-camps impossible. Few more terrible plagues can have afflicted\nBritish troops than the flies of Gallipoli. In May, by comparison, there\nwere none. In June they became unbearable; in July they were literally\ninconceivable. Most Englishmen have lain down some gentle summer day to\ndoze on a shaded lawn and found that one or two persistent flies have\ndestroyed the repose of the afternoon; many women have turned sick at\nthe sight of a blowfly in their butcher's shop. Let them imagine a\nsemi-tropical sun in a place where there is little or no shade, where\nsanitary arrangements are less than primitive, where, in spite of all\nprecautions, there are scraps of bacon and sugar and tea-leaves lying\neverywhere in the dust, and every man has his little daily store of food\nsomewhere near him, where there are dead bodies and the carcasses of\nmules easily accessible to the least venturesome fly--let them read for\n'one' fly a hundred, a thousand, a million, and even then they will not\nexaggerate the horror of that plague.\n\nUnder it the disadvantages of a sensitive nature and a delicate\nupbringing were easy to see. An officer lies down in the afternoon to\nsleep in his hole. The flies cluster on his face. Patiently, at first,\nhe brushes them away, with a drill-like mechanical movement of his hand;\nby and by he does it angrily; his temper is going. He covers his face\nwith a handkerchief; it is distressingly hot, but at least he may have\nsome rest. The flies settle on his hand, on his neck, on the bare part\nof his leg. Even there the feel of them is becoming a genuine torment.\nThey creep under the handkerchief; there is one on his lip, another\nbuzzing about his eye. Madly he tears off the handkerchief and lashes\nout, waving it furiously till the air is free. The flies gather on the\nwalls of the dug-out, on the waterproof sheet, and watch; they are\nwaiting motionless till he lies down again. He throws his coat over his\nbare knees and lies back. The torment begins again. It is unendurable.\nHe gets up, cursing, and goes out; better to walk in the hot sun or sit\nunder the olive-tree in the windy dust.\n\nBut look into the crowded ditches of the men. Some of them are fighting\nthe same fight, hands moving and faces twitching, like the flesh of\nhorses, automatically. But most of them lie still, not asleep, but in a\nkind of dogged artificial insensibility. The flies crowd on their faces;\nthey swarm about their eyes, and crawl unmolested about their open\nmouths. It is a horrible sight, but those men are lucky.\n\nThen there was always a great noise in the camp, for men would be called\nfor from Headquarters at the end of it or orders passed down, and so\ngreat was the wind and the noise of the French guns and the Turkish\nshells, that these messages had to be bawled from man to man. The men\ngrew lazy from sheer weariness of these messages, so that they were\nmutilated as they came and had to be repeated; and there was this babel\nalways. The men, too, like the officers, became irritable with each\nother, and wrangled incessantly over little things; only the officers\nargued quietly and bitterly, and the men shouted oaths at each other and\nfilthy epithets. There was only a yard between the holes of the officers\nand the holes of the men, and their raucous quarrelling grated on nerves\nalready sensitive from the trials of the day, and the officer came near\nto cursing his own men; and that is bad.\n\nSo there was no rest to be had in the camp during the day; and at night\nwe marched out in long columns to dig in the whispering gullies, or\nunload ships on the beach. There were many of these parties, and we were\nmuch overworked, as all infantry units invariably are; and only at long\nintervals there came an evening when a man might lie down under the\nperfect stars and sleep all night undisturbed. Then indeed he had rest;\nand when he woke to a sudden burst of shell-fire, lay quiet in his hole,\ntoo tired and dreamy to be afraid.\n\nDust and flies and the food and the water and our weakness joined forces\nagainst us, and dysentery raged among us. There were many who had never\nheard of the disease, and thought vaguely of the distemper of dogs.\nThose who had heard of it thought of it as something rather romantically\nEastern, like the tsetse fly, and the first cases were invested with a\ncertain mysterious distinction--especially as most of them were sent\naway. But it became universal; everybody had it, and everybody could not\nbe sent away. One man in a thousand went through that time untouched;\none in ten escaped with a slight attack. But the remainder lived\npermanently or intermittently in a condition which in any normal\ncampaign would have long since sent them on stretchers to the base. The\nmen could not be spared; they stayed and endured and tottered at their\nwork. Thus there was every circumstance to encourage infection and\nlittle to resist it. One by one the officers of D Company were stricken.\nThe first stages were mildly unpleasant, encouraging that comfortable\nsense of martyrdom which belongs to a recognized but endurable\ncomplaint. As it grew worse, men became querulous but were still\ninterested in themselves, and those not in the final stages discussed\ntheir symptoms, emulously, disgustingly--still a little anxious to be\nworse than their fellows.\n\nIn the worst stage there was no emulation, only a dull misery of\nrecurrent pain and lassitude and disgust. A man could not touch the\ncoarse food which was all we had; or, if from sheer emptiness he did,\nhis sufferings were immediately magnified. Yet always he had a wild\ncraving for delicate food, and as he turned from the sickening bacon in\nthe gritty lid of his mess-tin, conjured bright visions of lovely\ndainties which might satisfy his longing and give him back his strength.\nSo men prayed for parcels. But when they came, or when some wanderer\ncame back from the Islands with a basket of Grecian eggs, too often it\nwas too late for the sickest men, and their agonies were only increased.\nScientific dieting was impossible. They could only struggle on, for ever\nsick, yet for ever on duty: this was the awful thing. When a man reached\nthis stage, the army was lucky indeed if it did not lose him; he was\nlucky himself if he did not die. But so strong is the human spirit and\nso patient the human body, that most won through this phase to a\nspasmodic existence of alternate sickness and precarious health; and\nwhen they said to themselves 'I am well,' and ate heartily, and said to\ntheir companions 'This and that is what you should do,' the disease\ngripped them again, each time more violently. All this sapped the\nstrength of a man; and finally there came a terrible debility, a kind of\nparalysing lassitude when it needed a genuine flogging of the will for\nhim to lift himself and walk across the camp, and his knees seemed\npermanently feeble, as if a fever had just left him. Yet many endured\nthis condition for weeks and months till the fever definitely took them.\nSome became so weak that while they still tottered up to the line and\nabout their duties, they could not gratuitously drag themselves to the\nbeach to bathe. Then indeed were they far gone, for the evening swims\nwere the few paradisial moments of that time. When the sun had but an\nhour to live, and the wind and the dust and the flies were already\ndwindling, we climbed down a cliff-path where the Indians kept their\nsacred but odorous goats. There was a fringe of rocks under the cliffs\nwhere we could dive. There we undressed, hot and grimy, lousy, thirsty,\nand tired. Along the rocks solitary Indians were kneeling towards Mecca.\nSome of the old battered boats of the first landing were still nosing\nthe shore, and at a safe distance was a dead mule. The troops did not\ncome here but waded noisily in the shallow water; so all was quiet, save\nfor an occasional lazy shell from Asia and the chunk-chunk of a\npatrol-boat. The sea at this hour put on its most perfect blue, and the\nfoot-hills across the Straits were all warm and twinkling in the late\nsun. So we sat and drank in the strengthening breeze, and felt the clean\nair on our contaminated flesh; and plunging luxuriously into the lovely\nwater forgot for a magical moment all our weariness and disgust.\n\nWhen a man could not do this, he was ill indeed.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd by this time we had found each other out. We had discovered a true\nstandard of right and wrong; we knew quite clearly now, some of us for\nthe first time, what sort of action was 'dirty,' and we were fairly\nclear how likely each of us was to do such an action. We knew all our\nlittle weaknesses and most of our serious flaws; under that olive-tree\nthey could not long be hid. In the pleasant life of London or Oxford we\nhad had no occasion to do anything dishonourable or underhand; in our\nrelations with other men we had not even wished to be guilty of anything\nworse than mild unkindnesses or consistent unpunctuality. But behind the\nfootlights of Gallipoli we had found real burning temptations; and we\nhad found our characters. D Company on the whole was lucky, and had\nstood the test well. We knew that Burnett was 'bogus'; but we knew that\nWilliams of A Company was incalculably more 'bogus'; we had stood in the\ndark sap at night and reluctantly overheard the men of his company speak\nof him and his officers.\n\nBut little weaknesses beget great irritations in that life, and the\nintimate problems of communal feeding were enough to search out all our\nweaknesses. We knew that some of us, though courageous, were greedy;\nthat others, though not greedy, were querulous about their food and had\na nasty habit of 'sticking out for their rights': indeed, I think I\ndeveloped this habit myself. We had had trouble about parcels. Parcels\nin theory were thrown into the common stock of the mess: but Egerton and\nBurnett never had parcels, and were by no means the most delicate eaters\nof other people's dainties. Harry and Hewett reserved some portion of\neach parcel, a cake or a slab of chocolate, which they ate furtively in\ntheir dug-outs, or shared with each other in the dusk; Burnett\nostentatiously endowed the mess with his entire stock, but afterwards at\nevery meal hinted sombrely at the rapacity of those who had devoured it.\nHarry and Hewett each made contributions to the mess; but Harry objected\nto the excessive consumption of this food by Burnett, and Hewett, who\ngave ungrudgingly to the rest of us, had a similar reservation--never\nexpressed--as against Egerton. So all this matter of food set in motion\na number of antagonisms seldom or never articulate, but painfully\nperceptible at every meal.\n\nThe parcel question, I think, was one of the things which embittered the\nquarrel between Harry and Burnett. A parcel from home to schoolboys and\nsoldiers and prisoners and sailors, and all homesick exiles, is the most\npowerful emblem of sentiment and affection. A man would willingly\npreserve its treasures for himself to gloat over alone, in no mere\nfleshly indulgence, but as a concrete expression of affection from the\nhome for which he longs. This is not nonsense. He likes to undo the\nstrings in the grubby hole which is his present home, and secretly\nbecome sentimental over the little fond packages and queer, loving\nthoughts which have composed it. And though in a generous impulse he may\nsay to his companions, 'Come, and eat this cake,' and see it in a moment\ndisappear, it is hard for him not to think, 'My sister (or wife, or\nmother) made this _for me_; they thought it would give _me_ pleasure for\nmany days. Already it is gone--would they not be hurt if they knew?' He\nfeels that he has betrayed the tenderness of his home; and though the\ngiving of pleasure to companions he likes may overcome this feeling, the\ncompulsory squandering of such precious pleasure on a man he despises\ncalls up the worst bitterness of his heart. So was it between Harry and\nBurnett.\n\nIf, by the way, it be suggested that Burnett was entitled to feel the\nsame sentimental jealousy about _his_ parcels, I answer that Burnett's\nparcels came on his own order from the soulless hand of Fortnum and\nMason.\n\nAll of us were very touchy, very raw and irritable in that fevered\natmosphere. Men who were always late in relieving another on watch, or\nunreasonably resented a minute's postponement of their relief, or never\nhad any article of their own but for ever borrowed mess-tins and\nelectric torches and note-books from more methodical people, or were\noverbearing to batmen, or shifted jobs on to other officers, or slunk\noff to bathe alone when they should have taken their sultry\nplatoon--such men made enemies quickly. Between Eustace and Hewett, who\nhad been good friends before and were to be good friends again, there\ngrew up a slow animosity. Hewett was one of the methodical class of\nofficer, Eustace was one of the persistent borrowers. Moreover, as I\nhave said, he was a cynic, and he _would_ argue. He had a contentious\nremark for every moment of the day; and though this tormented us all\nbeyond bearing, Hewett was the only one with both the energy and the\nintellectual equipment to accept his challenges. So these two argued\nquietly and fiercely in the hot noon, or the blue dusk, till the rest of\nus were weary of them both, and the sound of Eustace's harsh tones was\nan agony to the nerves. They were both too consciously refined to lose\ntheir tempers healthily, and when they reached danger-point, Hewett\nwould slink away like an injured animal to his burrow. In this conflict\nHarry took no speaking part, for while in spirit and affection he was on\nHewett's side, he paid intellectual tribute to Eustace's conduct of the\nargument, and listened as a rule in puzzled silence. Eustace again was\nhis cordial ally against Burnett, while Hewett had merely the\nindifference of contempt for that officer.\n\nSo it was all a strange tangle of friendship and animosity and\ngood-nature and bitterness. Yet on the surface, you understand, we lived\non terms of toleration and vague geniality; except for the disputations\nof Hewett and Eustace there was little open disagreement. In the\nconfined space of a company mess permanent hostilities would make life\nimpossible; it is only generals who are allowed to find that they can no\nlonger 'act with' each other, and resign: platoon commanders may come to\nthe same conclusion, but they have to go on acting. And so openly we\nlaughed and endured and bore with each other. Only there was always this\nundertone of irritations and animosities which, in the maddening\nconditions of our life, could never be altogether silenced, and might at\nany moment rise to a strangled scream.\n\nHarry's appointment as Scout Officer was the first thing to set Burnett\nagainst Harry, though already many things had set Harry against Burnett.\nIt had been commonly assumed, in view of Burnett's 'backwoods'\nreputation, that he would succeed Martin as Scout Officer. The Colonel's\nselection of Harry took us a little by surprise, though it only showed\nthat the Colonel was a keener judge of character and ability than the\nrest of us. No one, I think, was more genuinely pleased that Burnett was\nnot to be Scout Officer than Burnett himself; but in the interests of\nhis 'dare-devil' pretensions he had to affect an air of disappointment,\nand let it be known by grunts and shrugs and sour looks that he\nconsidered the choice of Harry to be an injury to himself and the\nregiment. As far as Harry was concerned this resentment of Burnett's was\nmore or less genuine, for his reluctance to take on the job did not\nprevent him being jealous of the man who did.\n\nThen Burnett was one of the people who had nothing of his own, and\nseemed to regard Harry, as the youngest of us all, as the proper person\nto provide him with all the necessaries of life. In those days we had no\nplates or crockery, but ate and drank out of our scratched and greasy\nmess-tins. Harry's mess-tin disappeared, and for three days he was\ncompelled to borrow from Hewett or myself--a tedious and, to him,\nhateful business. One day Burnett had finished his meal a long way ahead\nof any of us, and Harry, in the desperation of hungry waiting, asked him\nfor the loan of his mess-tin. Automatically he looked at the bottom of\nthe tin, and there found his initials inscribed. It was his own tin.\nFurther, some one had tried to scratch the initials out. Harry kept his\ntemper with obvious difficulty. Burnett knew well that he had lost his\nmess-tin (we were all sick of hearing it), but he said he was quite\nignorant of having it in his possession. When Harry argued with him,\nBurnett sent for his batman and cursed him for taking another officer's\nproperty. The wretched man mumbled that he had 'found' it, and withdrew;\nand we all sat in silence teeming with distrustful thoughts. We were\nsorry for the batman; we were sorry for Harry. Burnett may not have\ntaken the mess-tin with his own hands, but morally he stood convicted of\nan action which was 'dirty.'\n\nThen Burnett and Harry took a working-party together to dig in the\ngully. Burnett was the senior officer, but left Harry to work all night\nin the whispering rain of stray bullets, while he sat in an Engineers'\ndug-out and drank whisky. Harry did not object to this, the absence of\nBurnett being always congenial to him. But next day there came a\ncomplimentary message from the Brigadier about the work of that\nworking-party. Burnett was sent for and warmly praised by the Colonel.\nBurnett stood smugly and said nothing. Harry, when he heard of it, was\nfurious, and wanted, he said, to 'have a row' with him. What he expected\nBurnett to say, I don't know; the man could hardly stand before his\nColonel and say, 'Sir, Penrose did all the work, I was in the Engineers'\ndug-out nearly all the time with my friends, and had several drinks.' A\nrow, in any case, would be intolerable in that cramped, intimate\nexistence, and I dissuaded Harry, though I made Egerton have a few words\nwith Burnett on the subject. Harry contented himself with ironic\ncomments on Burnett's 'gallantry' and 'industry,' asking him blandly at\nmeals if he expected to get his promotion over that working-party, and\nsuggesting to Egerton that Burnett should take Harry's next turn of duty\n'because he is so good at it.' This made Burnett beautifully angry. But\nit was bitter badinage, and did not improve the social atmosphere.\n\nThere were a number of such incidents between the two; they were very\npetty in themselves, some of them, like a fly, but in their cumulative\neffect very large and distressing. In many cases there was no verbal\nengagement, or only an angry, inarticulate mutter. Public, unfettered\nangers were necessarily avoided. But this pent-up, suppressed condition\nof the quarrel made it more malignant, like a disease. And it got on\nHarry's nerves; indeed, it got on mine. It became an active element in\nthat vast complex of irritation and decay which was eating into his\nyoung system; it was leagued with the flies, and the dust, and the\nsmells, and the bad food, and the wind, and the harassing shells of the\nTurks, and the disgustful torment of disease.\n\n\nIII\n\nFor Harry was a very sick man. He had endured through all the stages of\ndysentery, and now lived with that awful legacy of weakness of which I\nhave spoken. And the disease had not wholly left him, but some days he\nlay faint with excruciating spasms of pain. Slightly built and\nconstitutionally fragile at the beginning, he was now a mere wasted wisp\nof a man. The flesh seemed to have melted from his face, and when he\nstood naked on the beach it seemed that the moving of his bones must\nsoon tear holes in the unsubstantial skin. Standing in the trench with\nthe two points of his collar-bone jutting out like promontories above\nhis shirt, and a pale film of dust over his face, he looked like the wan\nghost of some forgotten soldier. On the Western Front, where one case of\ndysentery created a panic among the authorities, and in the most urgent\ndays they have never had to rely on skeletons to fight, he would long\nsince have been bundled off. But in this orgy of disease, no officer\ncould be sent away who was willing to stay and could still totter up the\ngully. And Harry would not go. When he went to the battalion doctor it\nwas with an airy request for the impotent palliatives then provided for\nearly dysentery, and with no suggestion of the soul-destroying sickness\nthat was upon him. One day he would not come down to the rocks and\nbathe, so feeble he was. 'I know now,' he said, 'the meaning of that bit\nin the psalms, \"My knees are like water and all my bones are out of\njoint.\"' 'Harry,' I said, 'you're not fit to stay here--why not go\nsick?' At which he smiled weakly, and said that he might be better in a\nday or two. Pathetic hope! all men had it. And so Hewett and I walked\ndown, a little sadly, alone, marvelling at the boy's courage. For it\nseemed to us that he wanted to stay and see it through, and if indeed he\nmight recover we could not afford to lose him. So we said no more.\n\nBut by degrees I gained a different impression. Harry still opened his\nmind to Hewett and myself more than to any one else, but it was by no\ndirect speech, rather by the things he did not say, the sentences half\nfinished, the look in his eyes, that the knowledge came--that Harry did\nwant to go away. The romantic impulse had perished long since in that\nruined trench; but now even the more mundane zest of doing his duty had\nlost its savour in the long ordeal of sickness and physical distress. He\ndid want to go sick. He had only to speak a word; and still he would not\ngo. When I knew this, I marvelled at his courage yet more.\n\nFor many days I watched him fighting this lonely conflict with himself,\na conflict more terrible and exacting than any battle. Sometimes the\ndoctor came and sat under our olive-tree, and some of us spoke jestingly\nof the universal sickness, and asked him how ill we must be before he\nwould send us home. Harry alone sat silent; it was no joke to him.\n\n'And how do _you_ feel now, Penrose?' said the doctor. 'Are you getting\nyour arrow-root all right?' Harry opened his mouth--but for a moment\nsaid nothing. I think it had been in his mind to say what he did feel,\nbut he only murmured, 'All right, thank you, doctor.' The doctor looked\nat him queerly. He knew well enough, but it was his task to keep men on\nthe Peninsula, not to send them away.\n\nOnce I spent an afternoon in one of the hospital ships in the bay: when\nI came back and told them of the cool wards and pleasant nurses, and all\nthe peace and cleanliness and comfort that was there, I caught Harry's\nwistful gaze upon me, and I stopped. It was well enough for the rest of\nus in comparative health to imagine luxuriously those unattainable\namenities. None of us were ill enough then to go sick if we wished it.\nHarry was. And I knew that such talk must be an intolerable temptation.\n\nThen one day, on his way up to the line with a working-party, he nearly\nfainted. 'I felt it coming on,' he told me, 'in a block. I thought to\nmyself, \"This is the end of it all for me, anyhow.\" I actually did go\noff for a moment, I think, and then some one pushed me from behind--and\nas we moved on it wore off again. I did swear----' Harry stopped,\nrealizing the confession he had made. I tried to feel for myself the\nawful bitterness of that awakening in the stifling trench, shuffling\nuphill with the flies.... But he had told me now everything I had only\nguessed before, and once more I urged him to go sick and have done with\nit.\n\n'I would,' he said, 'only I'm not sure ... I know I'm jolly ill, and not\nfit for a thing ... but I'm not sure if it's only that ... I was pretty\nbrave when I got here, I think' (I nodded), 'and I think I am still ...\nbut last time we were in the line I found I didn't like looking over the\ntop nearly so much ... so I want to be sure that I'm quite all right ...\nin that way ... before I go sick.... Besides, you know what everybody\nsays....'\n\n'Nobody could say anything about you,' I told him; 'one's only got to\nlook at you to see that you've got one foot in the grave.' 'Well, we go\nup again to-morrow,' he said, 'and if I'm not better after that, I'll\nthink about it again.'\n\nI had to be content with that, though I was not content. For my fears\nwere fulfilled, since in the grip of this sickness he had begun at last\nto be doubtful of his own courage.\n\nBut that night Burnett went to the doctor and said that he was too ill\nto go on. So far as the rest of us knew, he had never had anything but\nthe inevitable preliminary attack of dysentery, though it is only fair\nto say that most of us were so wrapped up in the exquisite contemplation\nof our own sufferings, that we had little time to study the condition of\nothers. The doctor, however, had no doubts about Burnett; he sent him\nback to us with a flea in his ear and a dose of chlorodyne. The story\nleaked out quickly, and there was much comment adverse to Burnett. When\nHarry heard it, he led me away to his dug-out. It was an evening of\nheavy calm, like the inside of a cathedral. Only a few mules circling\ndustily at exercise in the velvet gloom, and the distant glimmer of the\nScotsmen's fires, made any stir of movement. The men had gone early to\ntheir blankets, and now sang softly their most sentimental songs,\nreserved always for the night before another journey to the line. They\nsang them in a low croon of ecstatic melancholy, marvellously in tune\nwith the purple hush of the evening. For all its aching regret it was a\nsound full of hope and gentle resolution. Harry whispered to me, 'You\nheard about Burnett? Thank God, nobody can say those things about me!\nI'm not going off this Peninsula till I'm pushed off.'\n\nI said nothing. It was a heroic sentiment, and this was the heroic hour.\nIt is what men say in the morning that matters....\n\nIn the morning we moved off as the sun came up. There had been heavy\nfiring nearly all night, and over Achi Baba in the cloudless sky there\nhung a portent. It was as though some giant had been blowing\nsmoke-rings, and with inhuman dexterity had twined and laced these rings\ntogether, without any of them losing their perfection of form.... As the\nsun came up these cloud-rings stood out a rosy pink against the blue\ndistance, and while we marched through the sleeping camps turned gently\nthrough dull gold to pale pearl. I have never known what made this\nmarvel, a few clouds forgotten by the wind, or the smoke of the night's\nbattle; but I marched with my eyes upon it all the stumbling way to Achi\nBaba. And when I found Harry at a halt, he, too, was gazing at the\nwonder with all his men. 'It's an omen,' he said.\n\n'Good or bad?'\n\n'Good,' he said.\n\nI have never understood omens; I suppose they are good or bad according\nto the mind of the man who sees them: and I was glad that Harry thought\nit was good.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIt was one of the Great Dates: one of those red dates which build up the\ncalendar of a soldier's past, and dwell in his memory when the date of\nhis own birth is almost forgotten. It is strange what definite\nsign-posts these dates of a man's battle--days become in his calculation\nof time--like the foundation of Rome. An old soldier will sigh and say,\n'Yes, I know that was when Jim died--it was ten days after the Fourth of\nJune,' or, 'I was promoted the day before the Twelfth of July.'\n\nThe years pile up, and zero after zero day is added for ever to his\nprimitive calendar, and not one of them is thrust from his reverent\nmemory; but at each anniversary he wakes and says, 'This is the 3rd of\nFebruary, or the 1st of July,' and thinks of old companions who went\ndown on that day; and though he has seen glorious successes since, he\nwill ever think with a special tenderness of the black early failures\nwhen he first saw battle and his friends going under. And if in any\nplace where soldiers gather and tell old tales, there are two men who\ncan say to each other, 'I, too, was at Helles on such a date,' there is\na great bond between them.\n\nOn one of these days we sat under the olive-tree and waited. Up the hill\none of that long series of heroic, costly semi-successes was going\nthrough. We were in reserve. We had done six turns in the trenches\nwithout doing an attack. When we came out we were very ready to attack,\nvery sure of ourselves. Now we were not so sure of ourselves; we were\nwaiting, and there was a terrible noise. Very early the guns had begun,\nand everywhere, from the Straits to the sea, were the loud barkings of\nthe French 'seventy-fives,' thinly assisted by the British artillery,\nwhich was scanty, and had almost no ammunition. But the big ships came\nout from Imbros and stood off and swelled the chorus, dropping their\nhuge shells on the very peak of the little sugar-loaf that tops Achi\nBaba, and covering his western slopes with monstrous eruptions of black\nand yellow.\n\nDown in the thirsty wilderness of the rest-camps the few troops in\nreserve lay restless under occasional olive-trees, or huddled under the\nexiguous shelter of ground-sheets stretched over their scratchings in\nthe earth. They looked up and saw the whole of the great hill swathed in\nsmoke and dust and filthy fumes, and heard the ruthless crackle of the\nTurks' rifles, incredibly rapid and sustained; and they thought of their\nfriends scrambling over in the bright sun, trying to get to those\nrifles. They themselves were thin and wasted with disease, and this\nuncertainty of waiting in readiness for they knew not what plucked at\ntheir nerves. They could not rest or sleep, for the flies crawled over\ntheir mouths and eyes and tormented them ceaselessly, and great storms\nof dust swept upon them as they lay. They were parched with thirst, but\nthey must not drink, for their water-bottles were filled with the day's\nallowance, and none knew when they would be filled again. If a man took\nout of his haversack a chunk of bread, it was immediately black with\nflies, and he could not eat. Sometimes a shell came over the Straits\nfrom Asia with a quick, shrill shriek, and burst at the top of the\ncliffs near the staff officers who stood there and gazed up the hill\nwith glasses. All morning the noise increased, and the shells streamed\nup the hill with a sound like a hundred expresses vanishing into a\nhundred tunnels: and there was no news. But soon the wounded began to\ntrickle down, and there were rumours of a great success with terrible\nlosses. In the afternoon the news became uncertain and disturbing. Most\nof the morning's fruits had been lost. And by evening they knew that\nindeed it had been a terrible day.\n\nUnder our olive-tree we were very fidgety. There had been no mail for\nmany days, and we had only month-old copies of the _Mail_ and the\n_Weekly Times_, which we pretended listlessly to read. Eustace had an\nancient _Nation_, and Hewett a shilling edition of _Vanity Fair_. Harry\nin the morning kept climbing excitedly up the trees to gaze at the\nobscure haze of smoke on the hill, and trying vainly to divine what was\ngoing on; but after a little he too sat silent and brooding. We were no\nlonger irritable with each other, but studiously considerate, as if each\nfelt that to-morrow he might want to take back a spiteful word and the\nother be dead. All our valises and our sparse mess-furniture had long\nbeen packed away, for we had now been standing by for twenty-four hours,\nand we lay uneasily on the hard ground, shifting continually from\nposture to posture to escape the unfriendly protuberances of the soil.\nIn the tree the crickets chirped on always, in strange indifference to\nthe storm of noise about them. They were hateful, those crickets.... Now\nand then Egerton was summoned to Headquarters; and when he came back\neach man said to himself, 'He has got our orders.' And some would not\nlook at him, but talked suddenly of something else. And some said to him\nwith a painful cheeriness, 'Any orders?' and when he shook his head,\ncursed a little, but in their hearts wondered if they were glad. For the\nwaiting was bad indeed, but who knew what tasks they would have when\nthe orders came.... Often the Reserves had the worst of it in these\naffairs ... a forlorn hope of an attack without artillery ... digging a\nnew line under fire ... beating off the counterattack....\n\nBut the waiting became intolerable, and all were glad, an hour before\nsunset, when we filed off slowly by half-platoons. Every gun was busy\nagain, and all along the path to the hill batteries of 'seventy-fives'\nbarked suddenly from unsuspected holes, so close that a man's heart\nseemed to halt at the shock. The gully was full of confusion and\nwounded, and tired officers and odd groups of men bandying rumours and\narguing in the sun. Half-way up the tale came mysteriously down the line\nthat we were to attack a trench by ourselves; a whole brigade had tried\nand failed--there was a redoubt--there were endless machine-guns....\nSome laughed--'a rumour'; but most men felt in their heart that there\nwas something in it, and inwardly 'pulled themselves together.' At last\nthey were to be in a real battle, and walk naked in the open through the\nrapid fire. And as they moved on, there came over them an overpowering\nsense of the irrevocable. They thought of that summer day in 1914 when\nthey walked light-hearted into the recruiting office. It had seemed a\nsmall thing then, but that was what had done it; had brought them into\nthis blazing gully, with the frogs croaking, and the men moaning in\ncorners with their legs messed up.... If they had known about this gully\nthen and these flies, and this battle they were going to, then, perhaps,\nthey would have done something else in that August ... gone into a\ndockyard ... joined the A.S.C. like Jim Roberts.... Well, they hadn't,\nand they were not really sorry ... only let there be no more waiting ...\nand let it be quick and merciful, no stomach wounds and nastiness ... no\nlying out in the scrub for a day with the sun, and the flies, and no\nwater.\n\nLook at that officer on the stretcher ... _he_ won't last long ...\nremember his face ... his platoon relieved us somewhere ... where was\nit?... Hope I don't get one like him ... nasty mess ... would like one\nin the shoulder if it's got to be ... hospital ship ... get home,\nperhaps ... no, they send you to Egypt ... officer said so.... Hallo,\nhalting here ... Merton trench ... old Reserve Line.... Getting dark ...\nnight-attack?... not wait till dawn, I hope ... can't stand much more\nwaiting.... Pass the word, Company Commanders to see the Colonel ...\nthat's done it, there goes Egerton ... good man, thinks a lot of me ...\ntry not to let him down....\n\nBut what Egerton and the others heard from the Colonel made a vain thing\nof all this bracing of men's spirits. There was a muddle; the attack was\ncancelled ... no one knew where the Turks were, where anybody was ... we\nwere to stay the night in this old reserve trench and relieve the front\nline in the morning....\n\nWhen Egerton told his officers only Burnett spoke: he said 'Damn. _As_\nusual. I wanted a go at the old Turks': and we knew that it was not\ntrue. The rest of us said nothing, for we were wondering if it were true\nof ourselves. I went with Harry to his platoon; they too said nothing,\nand their faces were expressionless.\n\nBut they were cold now, and hungry, and suddenly very tired; and they\nhad no real fire of battle in them; they had waited too long for this\ncrowning experience of an attack, braced themselves for it too often to\nbe disappointed; and I knew that they were glad. But they did not mind\nbeing glad; they pondered no doubts about themselves, only curled up\nlike animals in corners to sleep....\n\nHarry, too, no doubt, had braced himself like the rest of us, and he,\ntoo, must have been glad, glad to lie down and look forward after all to\nseeing another sunrise. But I thought of his doubts about himself, and I\nfelt that this business was far from easing his burden. For me and for\nthe men it was a simple thing--the postponement of a battle with the\nTurks; for Harry it was the postponement of a personal test: the battle\ninside him still went on; only it went on more bitterly.\n\n\nII\n\nThere was a great muddle in front. Troops of two different brigades were\nhopelessly entangled in the shallow trenches they had taken from the\nTurks. They had few officers left, and their staffs had the most\nimperfect impressions of the whereabouts of their mangled commands. So\nthe sun was well up when we finally took over the line; this was in\ndefiance of all tradition, but the Turk was shaken and did not molest\nus. The men who passed us on their way down grimly wished us joy of what\nthey had left; their faces were pale and drawn, full of loathing and\nweariness, but they said little; and the impression grew that there was\nsomething up there which they could not even begin to describe. It was a\nstill, scorching morning, and as we moved on the air became heavy with a\nsickening stench, the most awful of all smells that man can be called to\nendure, because it preyed on the imagination as well as the senses. For\nwe knew now what it was. We came into a Turkish trench, broad and\nshallow. In the first bay lay two bodies--a Lowlander and a Turk. They\nlay where they had killed each other, and they were very foul and\nloathsome in the sun. A man looked up at them and passed on, thinking,\n'Glad I haven't got to stay here.' In the next bay there were three\ndead, all Englishmen; and in the next there were more--and he thought,\n'It was a hot fight just here.' But as he moved on, and in each\nsucceeding bay beheld the same corrupt aftermath of yesterday's battle,\nthe suspicion came to him that this was no local horror. Over the whole\nfront of the attack, along two lines of trenches, these regiments of\ndead were everywhere found, strung in unnatural heaps along the\nparapets, or sprawling horribly half into the trench so that he touched\nthem as he passed. Yet still he could not believe, and at each corner\nthought, 'Surely there will be none in this bay.'\n\nBut always there were more; until, if he were not careful or very\ncallous, it began to get on his nerves, so that at the traverses he\nalmost prayed that there might be no more beyond. Yet many did not\nrealize what was before them till they were finally posted in the bays\nthey were to garrison--three or four in a bay. Then they looked up at\nthe sprawling horrors on the parapet and behind them--just above their\nheads, and knew that these were to be their close companions all that\nsweltering day, and perhaps beyond. The regiment we had relieved had\nbeen too exhausted by the attack, or too short-handed, to bury more than\na few, and the Turkish snipers made it impossible to do anything during\nthe day. And so we sat all the scorching hours of the sun, or moved\nlistlessly up and down, trying not to look upwards.... But there was a\nhideous fascination about the things, so that after a few hours a man\ncame to know the bodies in his bay with a sickening intimacy, and could\nhave told you many details about each of them--their regiment, and how\nthey lay, and how they had died, and little things about their uniforms,\na missing button, or some papers, or an old photograph sticking out of a\npocket.... All of them were alive with flies, and at noon when we took\nout our bread and began to eat, the flies rose in a great black swarm\nand fell upon the food in our hands. After that no one could eat. All\nday men were being sent away by the doctor, stricken with sheer nausea\nby the flies and the stench and the things they saw, and went retching\ndown the trench. To keep away the awful reek we went about for a little\nin the old gas-helmets, but the heat and burden of them in the hot,\nairless trench was intolerable. The officers had no dug-outs, but sat\nunder the parapets, like the men. No officer went sick; no officer could\nbe spared; and indeed we seemed to have a greater power of resistance to\nthis ordeal of disgust than the men. But I don't know how Harry survived\nit. Being already in a very bad way physically, it affected him more\nthan the rest of us, and it was the first day I had seen his\ncheerfulness defeated. At the worst he had always been ready to laugh a\nlittle at our misfortunes, the great safety-valve of a soldier, and make\nironical remarks about Burnett or the Staff. This day he had no laugh\nleft in him, and I thought sadly of that first morning when he jumped\nover the parapet to look at a dead Turk. He had seen enough now.\n\nIn the evening the Turk was still a little chastened, and all night we\nlaboured at the burying of the bodies. It was bad work, but so strong\nwas the horror upon us that every man who could be spared took his part,\ncareless of sleep or rest, so long as he should not sit for another day\nwith those things. But we could only bury half of them that night, and\nall the next day we went again through that lingering torment. And in\nthe afternoon when we had orders to go up to the front line after dusk\nfor an attack, we were glad. It was one of the very few moments in my\nexperience when the war-correspondent's legend of a regiment's pleasure\nat the prospect of battle came true. For anything was welcome if only we\ncould get out of that trench, away from the smell and the flies, away\nfrom those bodies....\n\n\nIII\n\nI am not going to tell you all about that attack, only so much of it as\naffects this history, which is the history of a man and not of the war.\nIt was a one-battalion affair, and eventually a failure. D Company was\nin reserve, and our only immediate task was to provide a small\ndigging-party, forty men under an officer, to dig some sort of\ncommunication ditch to the new line when taken. Burnett was told off for\nthis job; we took these things more or less in turn, and it was his\nturn. And Burnett did not like it. We sat round a single candle under a\nwaterproof sheet in a sort of open recess at the back of the front line,\nwhile Egerton gave him his orders. And there ran in my head the old bit\nabout 'they all began with one accord to make excuse.' Burnett made no\nactual excuse; he could not. But he asked aggressive questions about the\narrangements which plainly said that he considered this task too\ndangerous and too difficult for Burnett. He wanted more men, he wanted\nanother officer--but no more could be spared from an already small\nreserve. He was full of 'the high ground on the right' from which his\nparty would 'obviously' be enfiladed and shot down to a man. However, he\nwent. And we sat listening to the rapid fire or the dull thud of bombs,\nuntil in front a strange quiet fell, but to right and left were the\nsounds of many machine-guns. As usual, no one knew what had happened,\nbut we expected a summons at any moment. We were all restless and jumpy,\nparticularly Harry. For a man who has doubts of himself or too much\nimagination, to be in reserve is the worst thing possible. Harry was\ntalkative again, and held forth about the absurdity of the whole attack,\nas to which he was perfectly right. But I felt that all the time he was\nthinking, 'Shall I do the right thing? shall I do the right thing? shall\nI make a mess of it?'\n\nI went out and looked over the parapet, but could make nothing out. Then\nI saw two figures loom through the dark and scramble into the trench.\nAnd after them came others all along the line, coming in anyhow, in\ndisorder. Then Burnett came along the trench, and crawled in under the\nwaterproof sheet. I followed. 'It's no good,' he was saying, 'the men\nwon't stick it. It's just what I told you ... enfiladed from that high\nground over there--two machine-guns....'\n\n'How many casualties have you had?' said Egerton.\n\n'One killed, and two wounded.'\n\nThere was silence, but it was charged with eloquent thoughts. It was\nclear what had happened. The machine-guns were firing blindly from the\nright, probably over the heads of the party. The small casualties showed\nthat. Casualties are the test. No doubt the men had not liked the stream\nof bullets overhead; at any moment the gun might lower. But there was\nnothing to prevent the digging being done, given an officer who would\nassert himself and keep the men together. That was what an officer was\nfor. And Burnett had failed. He had let the company down.\n\nEgerton, I knew, was considering what to do. The job had to be done. But\nshould he send Burnett again, with orders not to return until he had\nfinished, as he deserved, or should he send a more reliable officer and\nmake sure?\n\nThen Harry burst in: 'Let me take my platoon,' he said, 'they'll stick\nit all right.' And his tone was full of contempt for Burnett, full of\ndetermination. No doubts about him now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, we sent him out with his platoon. And all night they dug and\nsweated in the dark. The machine-gun did lower at times, and there were\nmany casualties, but Harry moved up and down in the open, cheerful and\nencouraging, getting away the wounded, and there were no signs of the\nmen not sticking it. I went out and stayed with him for an hour or so,\nand thought him wonderful. Curious from what strange springs inspiration\ncomes. For Harry, for the second time, had been genuinely inspired by\nthe evil example of his enemy. Probably, in the first place, he had\nwelcomed the chance of doing something at last, of putting his doubts to\nthe test, but I am sure that what chiefly carried him through that\nnight, weak and exhausted as he was, was the thought, 'Burnett let them\ndown; Burnett let them down; I'm not going to let them down.' Anyhow he\ndid very well.\n\nBut in the morning he was carried down to the beach in a high fever. And\nperhaps it was just as well, for I think Burnett would have done him a\nmischief.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nSo Harry stayed till he was 'pushed' off, as he had promised. And I was\nglad he had gone like that. I had long wanted him to leave the Peninsula\nsomehow, for I felt he should be spared for greater things, but, knowing\nsomething of his peculiar temperament, I did not want his career there\nto end on a note of simple failure--a dull surrender to sickness in the\nrest-camp. As it turned out, the accident of the digging-party, and the\nway in which Harry had seized his chance, sent him off with a renewed\nconfidence in himself and, with regard to Burnett, even a sense of\ntriumph. So I was not surprised when his letters began to reveal\nsomething of the old enthusiastic Harry, chafing at the dreary routine\nof the Depot, and looking for adventure again.... But I am anticipating.\n\nThey sent him home, of course. It was no good keeping any one in his\ncondition at Egypt or Malta, for the prolonged dysentery had produced\nthe usual complications. I had a letter from Malta, and one from the\nMediterranean Club at Gibraltar, where he had a sultry week looking over\nthe bay, seeing the ships steam out for England, he told me, and longing\nto be in one. For it took many months to wash away the taste of the\nPeninsula, and much more than the austere comforts of the hospital at\nGibraltar. Even the hot August sun in the Alameda was hatefully\nreminiscent. Then six weeks' milk diet at a hospital in Devonshire,\nconvalescence, and a month's leave.\n\nThen Harry married a wife. I did not know the lady--a Miss\nThickness--and she does not come into the story very much, though she\nprobably affected it a good deal. Wives usually do affect a soldier's\nstory, though they are one of the many things which by the absolute\nofficial standard of military duty are necessarily not reckoned with at\nall. Not being the president of a court-martial I did reckon with it;\nand when I had read Harry's letter about his wedding I said: 'We shan't\nsee _him_ again.' For in those early years it was generally assumed that\na man returned from service at the front need not go out again (unless\nhe wished) for a period almost incalculably remote. And being a newly\nmarried man myself, I had no reason to suppose that Harry would want to\nrush into the breach just yet.\n\nBut about May--that would be 1916; we had done with Gallipoli and come\nto France, after four months' idling in the Aegean Islands--I had\nanother letter, much delayed, from which I will give you an extract:\n\n_'I never thought I should want to go out again (you remember we all\nswore we never should) but I do. I'm fed to the teeth with this place_\n(the Depot, in Dorsetshire); _nothing but company drill and lectures on\nmarch discipline, and all the old stuff. We still attack Hill 219 twice\nweekly in exactly the same way, and still no one but a few of the\nofficers knows exactly which hill it is, since we always stop halfway\nfor lunch-time, or because there's hopeless confusion.... There's nobody\namusing here. Williams has got a company and swanks like blazes about\n'the front,' but I think most people see through him.... My wife's got\nrooms in a cottage near here, but they won't let me sleep out, and I\ndon't get there till pretty late most days.... Can't you get the Colonel\nto apply for me? I don't believe it's allowed, but he's sure to be able\nto wangle it. Otherwise I shall be here for the rest of the war, because\nthe more you've been out the less likely you are to get out again, if\nyou want to, while there are lots who don't want to go, and wouldn't be\nany earthly good, and stand in hourly danger of being sent.... I want to\nsee France....'_\n\nI answered on a single sheet:\n\n_'All very well, but what about Mrs. P.? Does she concur?'_ (I told you\nI was a married man.)\n\nHis answer was equally brief:\n\n_'She doesn't know, but she would.'_\n\nWell, it wasn't my business, so we 'wangled' it (I was adjutant then),\nand Harry came out to France. But I was sorry for Mrs. Penrose.\n\n\nII\n\nI do not know if all this seems tedious and unnecessary; I hope not, for\nit is very relevant to the end of the story, and if this record had been\nin the hands of certain persons the end of the story might have been\ndifferent. I do not know. Certainly it ought to have been different.\n\nAnyhow, Harry came to France and found us in the line at Souchez. The\nrecuperative power of the young soldier is very marvellous. No one but\nmyself would have said that this was not the same Harry of a year ago;\nfor he was fit and fresh and bubbling over with keenness. Only myself,\nwho had sat over the Dardanelles with him and talked about Troy, knew\nwhat was missing. There were no more romantic illusions about war, and,\nI think, no more military ambitions. Only he was sufficiently rested to\nbe very keen again, and had not yet seen enough of it to be ordinarily\nbored.\n\nAnd in that summer of 1916 there was much to be said for life in the\nSouchez sector. It was a 'peace-time' sector, where divisions stayed for\nmonths at a time, and one went in and out like clockwork at ritual\nintervals, each time into the same trenches, the same deep dug-outs,\neach time back to the same billets, or the same huts in the same wood.\nAll the deserted fields about the line were a mass of poppies and\ncornflowers, and they hung over one in extravagant masses as one walked\nup the communication trench. In the thick woods round Bouvigny and\nNoulette there were clusters of huts where the resting time was very\nwarm and lazy and companionable, with much white wine and singing in the\nevenings. Or one took a horse and rode into Coupigny or Barlin where\nthere had not been too much war, but one could dine happily at the best\nestaminet, and then ride back contentedly under the stars.\n\nIn the line also there was not too much war. Few of the infantry on\neither side ever fired their rifles; and only a few bombers with rifle\ngrenades tried to injure the enemy. There were short sectors of the line\non either side which became spasmodically dangerous because of these\nthings, and at a fixed hour each day the Germans blew the same portions\nof the line to dust with minenwerfers, our men having departed elsewhere\nhalf an hour previously, according to the established routine from which\nneither side ever diverged. Our guns were very busy by spasms, and every\nday destroyed small sections of the thick red masses of the German wire,\nwhich were every night religiously repaired. The German guns were very\nfew, for the Somme battle was raging, but at times they flung\nwhizz-bangs vaguely about the line or dropped big shells on the great\nbrows of the Lorette Heights behind us. From the high ground we held\nthere was a good view, with woods and red and white villages on the far\nhills beyond the Germans; and away to the left one looked over the\nbattered pit country towards Lens, with everywhere the tall pit-towers\nall crumpled and bent into uncouth shapes, and grey slag-heaps rising\nlike the Pyramids out of a wilderness of broken red cottages. To the\nsouth-east began the Vimy Ridge, where the red Pimple frowned over the\nlines at the Lorette Heights, and all day there was the foam and\nblackness of bursting shells.\n\nIn the night there was much patrolling and bursts of machine-gun fire,\nand a few snipers, and enormous labours at the 'improvement of the\nline,' wiring and revetting, and exquisite work with sand-bags.\n\nIt was all very gentle and friendly and artificial, and we were happy\ntogether.\n\nBurnett had left us, on some detached duty or other, and in that gentler\natmosphere Eustace was a good companion again.\n\nMen grew lusty and well, and one could have continued there indefinitely\nwithout much injury to body or mind. But sometimes on a clear night we\nsaw all the southern sky afire from some new madness on the Somme, and\nknew that somewhere in France there was real war. The correspondents\nwrote home that the regiments 'condemned so long to the deadening\ninactivity of trench warfare were longing only for their turn at the\nGreat Battle.' No doubt they had authority: though I never met one of\nthose regiments. For our part we were happy where we were. We had had\nenough for the present.\n\n\nIII\n\nBut I digress. And yet--no. For I want you to keep this idea of the\ndiversity of war conditions before you, and how a man may be in a\nfighting unit for many months and yet go unscathed even in spirit. Or in\nthe most Arcadian parts of the battle area he may come alone against\nsome peculiar shock from which he never recovers. It is all chance.\n\nWe made Harry scout officer again, and he was very keen. Between us and\nthe German lines was a honeycomb of old disused trenches where French\nand Germans had fought for many months before they sat down to watch\neach other across this maze. They were all overgrown now with flowers\nand thick grasses, but for the purposes of future operations it was\nimportant to know all about them, and every night Harry wriggled out and\ndropped into one of these to creep and explore, and afterwards put them\non the map. Sometimes I went a little way with him, and I did not like\nit. It was very creepy in those forgotten alleys, worse than crawling\noutside in the open, I think, because of the intense blackness and the\ninfinite possibilities of ambush.\n\nThe Boches, we knew, were playing the same game as ourselves, and might\nalways be round the next traverse, so that every ten yards one went\nthrough a new ordeal of expectancy and stealthy, strained investigation.\nOne stood breathless at the corner, listening, peering, quivering with\nthe strain of it, and then a rat dropped into the next 'bay,' or behind\nus one of our Lewis guns blazed off a few bursts, shattering the\nsilence. Surely there was some one near moving hurriedly under cover of\nthe noise! Then you stood again, stiff and cramped with the stillness,\nand you wanted insanely to cough, or shift your weight on to the other\nfoot, or your nose itched and the grasses tickled your ear--but you must\nnot stir, must hardly breathe. For now all the lines have become\nmysteriously hushed, and no man fires; far away one can hear the rumble\nof the German limbers coming up with rations to the dump, and the quiet\nbecomes unbearable, so that you long for some Titanic explosion to break\nit and set you free from waiting. Then a machine-gun opens again, and\nyou slip round the corner to find--nothing at all, only more blackness\nand the rats scuttling away into the grass, and perhaps the bones of a\nFrenchman. And then you begin all over again.... When he has done this\nsort of thing many times without any happening, an imperfect scout\nbecomes careless through sheer weariness, and begins to blunder noisily\nahead. And sooner or later he goes under. But Harry was a natural scout,\nwell trained, and from first to last kept the same care, the same\nadmirable patience, and this means a great strain on body and mind....\nIn those old trenches you could go right up to the German line, two\nhundred yards away, and this Harry often did. The Germans had small\nposts at these points, waiting, and were very ready with bombs and rifle\ngrenades. It was a poor look-out if you were heard about there, and\nperhaps badly wounded, so that you could not move, two hundred yards\naway from friends and all those happy soldiers who spent their nights\ncomfortably in trenches when you were out there on your stomach. Perhaps\nyour companion would get away and bring help. Or he too might be hit or\nkilled, and then you would lie there for days and nights, alone in a\ndark hole, with the rats scampering and smelling about you, till you\ndied of starvation or loss of blood. You would lie there listening to\nyour own men chattering in the distance at their wiring, and neither\nthey nor any one would find you or know where you were, till months\nhence some other venturesome scout stumbled on your revolver in the\ndark. Or maybe the line would advance at last, and some salvage party\ncome upon your uniform rotting in the ditch, and they would take off\nyour identity disk and send it in to Headquarters, and shovel a little\nearth above your bones. It might be many years....\n\nI am not an imaginative man, but that was the kind of thought I had\nwhile I prowled round with Harry (and I never went so far as he). He\neven had an occasional jest at the Germans, and once planted an old\ndummy close up to their lines. There was stony ground there, and, as\nthey took it there, he told me, it clattered. The next night he went\nthere again in case the Germans came out to capture 'Reggie.' They did\nnot, but every evening for many months they put a barrage of\nrifle-grenades all about that dummy.\n\nThen there was much talk of 'raids,' and all the opposite wire had to be\npatrolled and examined for gaps and weak places. This meant crawling in\nthe open close up to the enemy, naked under the white flares; and\nsometimes they fell to earth within a few feet of a scout and sizzled\nbrilliantly for interminable seconds; there was a sniper somewhere near,\nand perhaps a machine-gun section, and surely they could see him, so\nlarge, so illuminated, so monstrously visible he felt. It was easy when\nthere was not too much quiet, but many echoes of scattered shots and the\nnoise of bullets rocketing into space, or long bursts of machine-gun\nfire, to cover your movements. But when that terrible silence fell it\nwas very difficult. For then how loud was the rustle of your stealthiest\nwriggle, how sinister the tiny sounds of insects in the grass.\nEverywhere there were stray strands of old barbed wire which caught in\nyour clothes and needed infinite patience to disentangle; when you got\nrid of one barb another clung to you as the wire sprang back, or, if you\nwere not skilful, it clashed on a post or a rifle, or a tin can, with a\nnoise like cymbals. You came across strange things as you crawled out\nthere--dead bodies, and bits of equipment, and huge unexploded shells.\nOr you touched a rat or a grass-snake that made you shiver as it moved;\nthe rats and the field-mice ran over you if you lay still for long, and\nonce Harry saw a German patrol-dog sniffing busily in front of him.\nSometimes as you went up wind you put your hand suddenly on a dead man,\nand had to lie close beside him for cover. Or you scented him far off\nlike a dog nosing through the grass, and made him a landmark, whispering\nto your companion, 'Keep fifty yards from the dead 'un,' or 'Make for\nthe dead Boche.'\n\nWhen the lights went up you lay very close, peering ahead under your\ncap; and as they fell away to the ground all your vision became full of\nmoving things and fugitive shadows. The thick rows of wiring posts\nlooked like men working, and that cluster of stones like the head of a\nman in a shell-hole, watching ... watching you ... gone in an\ninstant.... Then you waited tensely for the next light. There is the\nmurmur of voices somewhere, very difficult to locate. For a long while\nyou stalk it, ready to attack some patrol, some working-party. Then you\nhear a familiar Tyneside curse ... it is A Company wiring, with much\nnoise.\n\nAll this, as I have said, is a heavy strain on mind and body and nerve.\nIt requires a peculiar kind of courage, a lonely, cold-blooded kind of\ncourage. Many men who would do well in a slap-dash fight in the light of\nday are useless as scouts. Not only are they noisy and impatient, but\nthey cannot stand it.\n\nAnd yet it is no job for a very imaginative man. There are too many\nthings you can imagine, if you once begin. The more you know about it,\nthe more there is to imagine, and the greater the strain becomes. Now\nHarry had a very vivid imagination, and he knew all about it--and yet he\nplayed this game nearly every night we were in the line for three\nmonths ... nothing theatrical, you understand, nor even heroic by popular\nstandards, no stabbing affrays, no medals ... but by my standards it\n_was_ very nearly heroic, and I don't know how he did it.\n\nBut this was forgotten later on.\n\n\nIV\n\nThen Harry had a shock. There was a large sap running out from our line\nalong the crown of a steep ridge. This sap was not held during the day,\nbut at night was peopled with bombers and snipers, and it was a great\nstarting-place for the patrols. One night Harry went out from this sap\nand crawled down the face of the ridge. It was a dark night, and the\nBoches were throwing up many flares. One of these came to earth ten\nyards from Harry. At that moment he was halfway down the slope, crouched\non one knee. However, when flares are about, to keep still in any\nposture is better than to move, so Harry remained rigid. But one of the\nnew scouts behind was just leaving the sap, and hovered uncertainly on\nthe skyline as the light flared and sizzled below. Possibly he was seen,\npossibly what followed was a chance freak of the Germans. Anyhow, a\nmoment later they opened with every machine-gun in the line, with\nrifles, rifle-grenades, and high-velocity shells. So venomous was the\nfire that every man in the line believed--and afterwards hotly\nasserted--that the whole fury of it was concentrated on his particular\nyard of trench. Few of us thought of the unhappy scouts lying naked\noutside. Harry, of course, flattened himself to the ground, and tried to\nwriggle into a hollow; on level ground you may with luck be safe under\nwild fire of this kind for a long time. Being on a slope, Harry was\nhopelessly exposed. 'I lay there,' he told me, 'and simply sweated with\nfunk; you won't believe me, but at one time I could literally _feel_ a\nstream of machine-gun bullets ruffling my hair, and thudding into the\nbank just above my back ... and they dropped half a dozen whizz-bangs\njust in front of me. While it was going on I couldn't have moved for a\nthousand pounds.... I felt _pinned_ to the ground ... then there was a\nlull, and I leapt up ... so did old Smith ... bolted for the sap, and\nsimply dived in head first ... they were still blazing off sixteen to\nthe dozen, and it was the mercy of God we weren't hit ... talk about\nwind-up.... And when we got in two bombers thought it was an attack, and\ntook us for Boches.... Rather funny, while the strafe was going on I\nkept thinking, \"Poor old Smith, he's a married man\" (he was a few yards\nfrom me) ... and Smith tells me _he_ was thinking, \"Mr. Penrose ... a\nmarried man ... married man....\" What about some more whisky?'\n\nWell, he made a joke of it, as one tries to do as long as possible, and\nthat night was almost happily exhilarated, as a man sometimes is after\nescaping narrowly from an adventure. But I could see that it had been a\nsevere shock. The next night he had a cold and a bad cough, and said he\nwould not go out for fear of 'making a noise and giving the show away.'\nThe following night he went out, but came in very soon, and sat rather\nglum in the dug-out, thinking of something. (I always waited up till he\ncame in to report, and we used to 'discuss the situation' over some\nwhisky or a little white wine.)\n\nThe following day the Colonel gave him a special job to do. There was\nthe usual talk of a 'raid' on a certain section of the enemy lines; but\nthere was a theory that this particular section had been evacuated.\nFlares were sent up from all parts of it, but this was supposed to be\nthe work of one man, a hard worker, who walked steadily up and down,\npretending to be a company. Harry was told off to test the truth of this\nmyth--to get right up to that trench, to look in, and see what was in\nit. It was a thing he had done twice before, at least, though myself I\nshould not have cared to do it at all. It meant the usual breathless,\ntoilsome wriggle across No Man's Land, avoiding the flares and the two\nsnipers who covered that bit of ground, finding a gap in the wire,\ngetting through without being seen, without noise, without catching his\nclothes on a wandering barb, or banging his revolver against a multitude\nof tin cans. Then you had to listen and wait, and, if possible, get a\nlook into the trench. When (and if) you had done that you had to get\nback, turn round in a tiny space, pass the same obstacles, the same\nsnipers.... If at any stage you were spotted the odds against your\ngetting back at all were extremely large....\n\nHowever, Harry was a scout, and it was his job. In the afternoon of that\nday I met him somewhere in the line and made some would-be jocular\nremark about his night's work. He seemed to me a little worried,\npreoccupied, and answered shortly. Hewett was sitting near, shaving in\nthe sun, and said to him: 'You're a nasty, cold-blooded fellow, Harry,\ncrawling about like a young snake every night. But I suppose you like\nit.'\n\nHarry said slowly, with a casual air: 'Well, so I did, but I must say\nthat strafe the other night put the wind up me properly--and when I went\nout last night I found I was thinking all the time, \"Suppose they did\nthat again?\" ... and when I got on the top of a ridge or anywhere a bit\nexposed, I kept imagining what it would be like if all those\nmachine-guns started just then ... simply dashed into a shell-hole ...\nand I found myself working for safe spots where one would be all right\nin case of accidents.... Sort of lost confidence, you know.'\n\nIt was all said in a matter-of-fact manner, as if he was saying, 'I\ndon't like marmalade so much as I used to do,' and there was no\nsuggestion that he was not ready to go and look in the Boche Front Line\nor the Unter den Linden, if necessary. But I was sorry about this. I\ntold him that he must not imagine; that that strafe was an unique\naffair, never likely to be repeated. But when I went back to the dug-out\nI spoke to the Colonel.\n\nThat night I went up with Harry to Foster Alley, and watched him\nwrithing away into the grey gloom. There were many stars, and you could\nfollow him for thirty yards. And as I watched I wondered, 'Is he\nthinking, \"_Supposing they do that again?_\" and when he gets over near\nthe wire, will he be thinking, \"_What would happen if they saw me now?_\"\nIf so,' I said, 'God help him,' and went back to Headquarters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree hours later he came into the dug-out, where I sat with the Colonel\nmaking out an Intelligence Report. He was very white and tired, and\nwhile he spoke to the Colonel he stood at the bottom of the muddy steps\nwith his head just out of the candlelight. All the front of his tunic\nwas muddy, and there were two rents in his breeches.\n\nHe said, 'Very sorry, sir, but I couldn't get through. I got pretty\nclose to the wire, but couldn't find a gap.' 'Was there much firing?'\nsaid the Colonel. 'The usual two snipers and a machine-gun on the left;\nfrom what I heard I should say there were a good many men in that part\nof the trench--but I couldn't swear.' Now what the Colonel had wanted\nwas somebody who _could_ swear; that was what the Brigade wanted; so he\nwas not pleased. But he was a kind, understanding fellow, and all he\nsaid was, 'Well, I'm sorry, too, Penrose, but no doubt you did your\nbest.' And he went to bed.\n\nThen I opened some Perrier (we still had Perrier then), and gave Harry a\nstrong whisky, and waited. For I knew that there was more. He talked for\na little, as usual, about the mud, and the Boche line, and so on, and\nthen he said: 'What I told the Colonel was perfectly true--I did get\npretty close to the wire, and there wasn't a gap to be seen--but that\nwasn't the whole of it ... I couldn't face it.... The truth is, that\nshow the other night was too much for me.... I found myself lying in a\nshell-hole pretending to myself that I was listening, and watching, and\nso on, but really absolutely stuck, trying to _make_ myself go on ...\nand I couldn't.... I'm finished as a scout ... that's all.'\n\nWell, it was all for the present. No thinking, human C.O. is going to\nrun a man in for being beaten by a job like that. It is a specialist's\naffair, like firing a gun. It is his business to put the right man on\nthe job, and if he doesn't, he can't complain.\n\nSo we made Harry Lewis gun officer. And that was the first stage.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nSoon after that we went down to the Somme. It was autumn then, and all\nthat desolate area of stark brown earth was wet and heavy and stinking.\nDown the Ancre valley there were still some leaves in Thiepval Wood, and\nthe tall trees along the river were green and beautiful in the thin\nOctober sun. But the centre of battle was coming up to that valley; in a\nmonth the green was all gone, and there was nothing to see but the\nendless uniform landscape of tumbled earth and splintered trunks, and\nonly the big shells raising vain waterspouts in the wide pools of the\nAncre gave any brightness to the tired eye.\n\nBut you know about all this. Every Englishman has a picture of the Somme\nin his mind, and I will not try to enlarge it. We were glad, in a way,\nto go there, not in the expectation of liking it, but on the principle\nof Henry V.'s speech on the eve of St. Crispin. We saw ourselves in\nhospitals, or drawing-rooms, or bars, saying, 'Yes, we were six months\non the Somme' (as indeed we were); we were going to be 'in the swing.'\nBut it was very vile. After Souchez it was real war again, and many\nSouchez reputations wilted there and died. Yet with all its horror and\ndiscomfort and fear that winter was more bearable than the Gallipoli\nsummer. For, at the worst, there was a little respite, spasms of repose.\nYou came back sometimes to billets, cold, bare, broken houses, but still\nhouses, where you might make a brave blaze of a wood fire and huddle\nround it in a cheery circle with warm drinks and a song or two. And\nsometimes there were estaminets and kind French women; or you went far\nback to an old ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, perched over the village, and there was bridge\nand a piano and guests at Headquarters. Civilization was within reach,\nand sometimes you had a glimpse of it--and made the most of it.\n\nBut we had a bad time, as every one did. After a stiff three weeks of\nholding a nasty bit of the line, much digging of assembly trenches, and\ncarrying in the mud, we took our part in a great battle. I shall not\ntell you about it (it is in the histories); but it was a black day for\nthe battalion. We lost 400 men and 20 officers, more than twice the\ntotal British casualties at Omdurman. Hewett was killed and six other\nofficers, the Colonel and twelve more were wounded. Eustace showed\nsuperb courage with a hideous wound. Harry and myself survived. Now I\nhad made a mistake about Harry. After that scouting episode at Souchez I\ntold myself that his 'nerve' was gone, that for a little anyhow he would\nbe no good in action. But soon after we got to the Somme he had\nsurprised me by doing a very good piece of work under fire. We were\ndigging a new 'jumping-off' line in No Man's Land, two hundred men at\nwork at once. They were spotted, the Boches dropped some Minnies about,\nand there was the beginnings of a slight stampede--you know the sort of\nthing--mythical orders to 'Retire' came along. All Harry did was to get\nthe men back and keep them together, and keep them digging: the\nofficer's job--but he did very well, and to me, as I say, surprisingly\nwell. The truth was, as I afterwards perceived, that only what I may\ncall his 'scouting' nerve was gone. It is a peculiar kind of\nsuper-nerve, as I have tried to show, and losing it he had lost a very\nvaluable quality, but that was all at present.\n\nOr I may put it another way. There is a theory held among soldiers,\nwhich I will call the theory of the favourite fear. Every civilian has\nhis favourite fear, death by burning or by drowning, the fear of falling\nfrom a great height, or being mangled in a machine--something which it\nmakes us shiver to think about. Among soldiers such special fears are\neven more acute, though less openly confessed, but in the evenings men\nwill sometimes lie on the straw in the smoky barns and whisper the\nthings of which they are most afraid.\n\nIt is largely a matter of locality and circumstance. In Gallipoli, where\nthe Turks' rapid musketry fire was almost incredibly intense and their\nsnipers uncannily accurate, men would say that they hated bullets, but\nshell-fire left them unmoved. The same men travelled to France and found\nrifle fire practically extinct but gun-power increasingly terrible, and\nrapidly reversed their opinions.\n\nMore often, however, there has been some particular experience which,\nout of a multitude of shocks, has been able to make a lasting\nimpression, and leave behind it the favourite fear.\n\nOne man remembers the death of a friend caught by the gas without his\ngas mask, and is possessed with the fear that he may one day forget his\nown and perish in the same agony. And such is the effect on conduct of\nthese obsessions that this man will neglect the most ordinary\nprecautions against other dangers, will be reckless under heavy\nshell-fire, but will not move an inch without his respirator.\n\nWith others it is the fear of being left to die between the lines,\ncaught on the wire and riddled by both sides, the fear of snipers, of\n5-9's, even of whizz-bangs. One man feels safe in the open, but in the\nstrongest dug-out has a horror that it may be blown in upon him. There\nis the fear of the empty trench, where, like a child on the dark\nstaircase, another man is convinced that there are enemies lying behind\nthe parapet ready to leap upon him; and there is the horror of being\nkilled on the way down from the line after a relief.\n\nBut most to be pitied of all the men I have known, was one who had\nserved at Gallipoli in the early days; few men then could have an\norderly burial in a recognized ground, but often the stretcher-bearers\nburied them hastily where they could in and about the lines. This man's\nfear was that one day a sniper would get him in the head; that unskilled\ncompanions would pronounce his death sentence, and that he would wake\nup, perhaps within a few yards of his own trench, and know that he was\nburied but not dead.\n\nThat was how it was with Harry. The one thing he could not face at\npresent was crawling lonely in the dark with the thought of that tornado\nof bullets in his head. Nothing else frightened him--now--more than it\nfrightened the rest of us, though, God knows, that was enough.\n\nSo that he did quite well in this battle in a sound, undistinguished\nway. He commanded a platoon for the occasion, and took them through the\nworst part of the show without exceptional losses; and he got as far as\nany of the regiment got. He held out there for two days under very heavy\nshell-fire, with a mixed lot of men from several battalions, and a\ncouple of strange officers. In the evening of the second day we were to\nbe relieved, and being now in command I sent him down with a runner to\nBrigade Headquarters to fix up a few points about our position and the\nrelief. There was a terrific barrage to pass, but both of them got\nthrough. When his business was done he started back to rejoin the\nbattalion. By that time it was about eleven o'clock at night, and the\nrelief was just beginning; there was no reason why he should have come\nback at all; indeed, the Brigade Major told him he had better not, had\nbetter wait there in the warm dug-out, and join us as we passed down.\nNow when a man has been through a two days' battle of this kind, has had\nno sleep and hardly any food for two days, and finished up with a\ntwo-mile trudge over a stony wilderness of shell-holes, through a\nvicious barrage of heavy shells; when after all this he finds himself,\nworn and exhausted so that he can hardly stand, but safe and comfortable\nin a deep dug-out where there are friendly lights and the soothing\nvoices of calm men; and when he has the choice of staying there, the\nright side of the barrage, till it is time to go out to rest, or of\ngoing back through that same barrage, staggering into the same\nshell-holes, with the immediate prospect _of doing it all over again\nwith men to look after as well as himself_--well, the temptation is\nalmost irresistible. But Harry did resist it--I can't tell you how--and\nhe started back. The barrage was worse than ever, all down the valley\nroad, and, apparently, when they came near the most dangerous part,\nHarry's runner was hit by a big splinter and blown twenty yards. There\nwere no stretchers unoccupied for five miles, and it was evident that\nthe boy--he was only a kid--would die in a little time. He knew it\nhimself, but he was very frightened in that hideous valley where the\nshells still fell, and he begged Harry not to leave him. And so we came\nupon them as we stumbled down, thanking our stars we were through the\nworst of it, Harry and the runner crouched together in a shell-hole,\nwith the heart of the barrage blazing and roaring sixty yards off, and\nstray shells all round.\n\nFrom a military or, indeed, a common-sense point of view, it was a\nfutile performance--the needless risk of a valuable officer's life.\n\nThey do not give decorations for that kind of thing. But I was glad he\nhad stayed with that young runner.\n\nAnd I only tell you this to show you how wrong I was, and how much stuff\nhe had in him still.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd now Colonel Philpott comes into the story. I wish to God he had kept\nout of it altogether. He was one of a class of officer with which our\ndivision was specially afflicted--at least we believed so, if only for\nthe credit of the British Army; for if they were typical of the Old Army\nI do not know how we came out of 1914 with as much honour as we did. But\nI am happy to think they were not. We called them the Old Duds, and we\nbelieved that for some forgotten sin of ours, or because of a certain\nstrong 'Temporary' spirit we had, they were dumped upon us by way of\npenalty. We had peculiarly few Regular officers, and so perhaps were\ninclined to be extra critical of these gentlemen. Anyhow, at one time\nthey came in swarms, lazy, stupid, ignorant men, with many years of\nservice--retired, reserve, or what not--but no discoverable distinction\neither in intellect, or character, or action. And when they had told us\nabout Simla and all the injustices they had suffered in the matter of\npromotion or pay, they ousted some young and vigorous Temporary fellow\nwho at least knew something of fighting, if there were stray passages in\nthe King's Regulations which he did not know by heart; and in about a\nweek their commands were discontented and slack. In about two months\nthey were evacuated sick (for they had no 'guts,' most of them), and\nthat was the finest moment of their careers--for them and for us.\n\nLt.-Col. (Tem'y) W. K. Philpott (Substantive Captain after God knows how\nmany years) out-dudded them all, though, to give him his due, he had\nmore staying power than most of them. He took over the battalion when\nColonel Roberts was wounded, and the contrast was painfully acute. I was\nhis adjutant for twelve months in all, and an adjutant knows most things\nabout his C.O. He was a short, stoutish fellow, with beady eyes and an\nunsuccessful moustache, slightly grey, like a stubble-field at dawn. He\nhad all the exaggerated respect for authority and his superiors of the\nold-school Regular, with none of its sincerity; for while he said things\nabout the Brigadier which no colonel should say before a junior officer,\nhe positively cringed when they met. And though he bullied defaulters,\nand blustered about his independence before juniors, there was no\nsuperior military goose to whom he would have said the most diffident\n'Bo.' He was lazy beyond words, physically and mentally, but to see him\ndouble out of the mess when a general visited the village was an\neducation. It made one want to vomit....\n\nThen, of course, he believed very strongly in 'The Book,' not Holy Writ,\nbut all that mass of small red publications which expound the whole art\nof being a soldier in a style calculated to invest with mystery the most\nobvious truths. 'It says it in The Book' was his great gambit--and a\ngood one too. Yet he betrayed the most astonishing ignorance of The\nBook. Any second lieutenant could have turned him inside out in two\nminutes on Field Service Regulations, and just where you expected him to\nbe really efficient and knowledgeable, the conduct of trials, and\nMilitary Law, and so on, he made the most hideous elementary howlers.\n\nBut ignorance is easily forgivable if a man will work, if a man will\nlearn. But he would neither. He left everything to somebody else, the\nsecond-in-command, the adjutant, the orderly-room. He would not say what\nhe wanted (he very seldom knew), and when in despair you made out his\norders for him he invariably disagreed; when he disagreed he was as\nobstinate as a mule, without being so clever. When he did agree it took\nhalf an hour to explain the simplest arrangement. If you asked him to\nsign some correspondence for the Brigade, he was too lazy and told you\nto sign it yourself; and when you did that he apologized to the Brigade\nfor the irregularities of his adjutant--'a Temporary fellow, you know.'\nFor he had an ill-concealed contempt for all Temporaries; and that was\nperhaps one reason why we disliked him so much. He would not believe\nthat a young officer, who had not spent twenty years drinking in\nmess-rooms, could have any military value whatever. Moreover, it annoyed\nhim intensely (and here he had my sympathy) to see such men enjoying the\nsame pay or rank as he had enjoyed during the almost apocryphal period\nof his captaincy. And having himself learned practically nothing during\nthat long lotus-time, it was inconceivable to him that any man, however\nvigorous or intelligent, could have learned anything in two years of\nwar.\n\nNow let me repeat that I do not believe him to be typical of the Old\nArmy, I know he was not (thank God); but this is a history of what\nhappened to Harry, and Colonel Philpott was one of the things which\nhappened--very forcibly. So I give him to you as we found him, and since\nhe may be alive I may say that his name is fictitious, though there are,\nunhappily, so many of him alive that I have no fears that he will\nrecognize himself. He would not be the same man if he did.\n\nWe went out for a fortnight's rest after that battle, and Harry had\ntrouble with him almost at once. He had amused and irritated Harry from\nthe first--the Old Duds always did--for his respect for authority was\nvery civilian and youthful in character; he took a man for what he was,\nand if he decided he was good stood by him loyally for ever after; if he\ndid not he was severe, not to say intolerant, and regrettably lacking in\nthat veneration for the old and incapable which is the soul of military\ndiscipline.\n\nPhilpott's arrogance on the subject of Temporaries annoyed him\nintensely; it annoyed us all, and this I think it was that made him say\na very unfortunate thing. He was up before the C.O. with some trifling\nrequest or other (I forget what), and somehow the question of his\nseniority and service came up. Incidentally, Harry remarked, quite\nmildly, that he believed he was nearly due for promotion. Colonel\nPhilpott gave as close an imitation of a lively man as I ever saw him\nachieve; he nearly had a fit. I forget all he said--he thundered for a\nlong time, banging his fist on the King's Regulations, and knocking\neverything off the rickety table--but this was the climax:\n\n'Promotion, by God! and how old are you, young man? and how much service\nhave you seen? Let me tell you this, Master Penrose, when I was your age\nI hadn't begun to _think_ about promotion, and I did fifteen years as a\ncaptain--fifteen solid years!'\n\n'And I don't wonder,' said Harry.\n\nIt was very unfortunate.\n\n\nIII\n\nWhen we went back to the line, Harry was detailed for many\nworking-parties; and some of them, particularly the first, were very\nnasty. The days of comfortable walking in communication trenches were\nover. We were in captured ground churned up by our own fire, and all\ncommunication with the front was over the open, over the shell-holes.\nHarry was told off to take a ration-party, carrying rations up to the\nbattalion in the line, a hundred men. These were bad jobs to do. It\nmeant three-quarters of a mile along an uphill road, heavily shelled;\nthen there was a mile over the shell-hole country, where there were no\nlandmarks or duckboards, or anything to guide you. For a single man in\ndaylight, with a map, navigation was difficult enough in this uniform\nwilderness until you had been over it a time or two; to go over it for\nthe first time, in the dark, with a hundred men carrying heavy loads,\nwas the kind of thing that makes men transfer to the Flying Corps. Harry\ngot past the road with the loss of three men only; there, at any rate,\nyou went straight ahead, however slowly. But when he left the road, his\nreal troubles began. It was pitch dark and drizzling, and the way was\nstill uphill. With those unhappy carrying-parties, where three-fourths\nof the men carried two heavy sacks of bread and tinned meat and other\nfood, and the rest two petrol tins of water, or a jar of rum, or rifle\noil, or whale oil, besides a rifle, and a bandolier, and two\nrespirators, and a great-coat--you must move with exquisite slowness, or\nyou will lose your whole party in a hundred yards. And even when you are\njust putting one foot in front of another, moving so slowly that it\nmaddens you, there are halts and hitches every few yards: a man misses\nhis footing and slides down into a crater with his awful load; the hole\nis full of foul green water, and he must be hauled out quickly lest he\ndrown. Half-way down the line a man halts to ease his load, or shift his\nrifle, or scratch his nose; when he goes on he can see no one ahead of\nhim, and the cry 'Not in touch' comes sullenly up to the front. Or you\ncross the path of another party, burdened as yours. In the dark, or\nagainst the flaring skyline, they look like yours, bent, murky shapes\nwith bumps upon them, and some of your men trail off with the other\nparty. And though you pity your men more than yourself, it is difficult\nsometimes to be gentle with them, difficult not to yield to the intense\nexasperation of it all, and curse foolishly....\n\nBut Harry was good with his men, and they stumbled on, slipping,\nmuttering, with a dull ache at the shoulders and a dogged rage in their\nhearts. He was trying to steer by the compass, and he was aiming for a\npoint given him on the map, the rendezvous for the party he was to meet.\nThis point was the junction of three trenches, but as all trenches\nthereabouts had been so blotted out as to be almost indistinguishable\nfrom casual shell-holes, it was not so good a rendezvous as it had\nseemed to the Brigade. However, Harry managed to find it, or believed\nthat he had found it--for in that murk and blackness nothing was\ncertain; if he had found it, the other party had not, for there was no\none there. They might be late, they might be lost, they might be waiting\nelsewhere. So Harry sent out a scout or two and waited, while the men\nlay down in the muddy ruins of the trench and dozed unhappily. And while\nthey waited, the Boche, who had been flinging big shells about at random\nsince dusk, took it into his head to plaster these old trenches with\n5-9's. Harry ran, or floundered along the line, telling the men to lie\nclose where they were. There was indeed nothing else to do, but it gave\nthe men confidence, and none of them melted away. As he ran, a big one\nburst very near and knocked him flat, but he was untouched; it is\nmarvellous how local the effect of H.E. can be. For about ten minutes\nthey had a bad time, and then it ceased, suddenly.\n\nAnd now was one of those crucial moments which distinguish a good\nofficer from a bad, or even an ordinary officer. It was easy to say,\n'Here I am at the rendezvous' (by this time Harry had got his bearings a\nlittle by the lights, and knew he was in the right spot) 'with these\nsomething rations; the men are done and a bit shaken; so am I; the other\npeople haven't turned up; if they want their rations they can damned\nwell come here and get them; I've done my part, and I'm going home.' But\na real good officer, with a conscience and an imagination, would say:\n'Yes--but I've been sent up here to get these rations to the men in the\nline; my men will have a rest to-morrow, and some sleep, and some good\nfood; the men in the line now will still be in the line, with no sleep,\nand little rest, and if these rations are left here in the mud and not\nfound before dawn, they'll have no food either; and whatever other\npeople may do or not do, it's up to me to get these rations up there\nsomehow, if we have to walk all night and carry them right up to the\nFront Line ourselves, and I'm not going home till I've done it.' I don't\nknow, but I think that that's the sort of thing Harry said to himself;\nand anyhow after the row with Philpott he was particularly anxious to\nmake good. So he got his men out and told them about it all, and they\nfloundered on. It was raining hard now, with a bitter wind when they\npassed the crest of the hill. Harry had a vague idea of the direction of\nthe line so long as they were on the slope; but on the flat, when they\nhad dodged round a few hundred shell-holes, halting and going on and\nhalting again, all sense of direction departed, and very soon they were\nhopelessly lost. The flares were no good, for the line curved, and there\nseemed to be lights all around, going up mistily through the rain in a\nwide circle. Once you were properly lost the compass was useless, for\nyou might be in the Boche lines, you might be anywhere.... At such\nmoments a kind of mad, desperate self-pity, born of misery and weariness\nand rage, takes hold of the infantryman, and if he carries a load, he is\ntruly ready to fall down and sleep where he is--or die. And in the\nwretched youth in charge there is a sense of impotence and\nresponsibility that makes his stomach sink within him. Some of the men\nbegan to growl a little, but Harry held on despairingly. And then by\nGod's grace they ran into another party, a N.C.O. and a few men; these\nwere the party--or some of them--that should have met them at the\nrendezvous; they too had been lost and were now wandering back to the\nline. Well, Harry handed over the rations and turned home, well pleased\nwith himself. He was too sick of the whole affair, and it was too dark\nand beastly to think of getting a receipt. It was a pity; for while he\ntrudged home, the N.C.O., as we afterwards heard, was making a mess of\nthe whole business. Whether he had not enough men, or perhaps lost them,\nor miscalculated the amount of rations or what, is not clear, but half\nof all that precious food was found lying in the mud at noon the next\nday when it was too late, and half the battalion in the line went very\nshort. Then the Colonel rang up Philpott, and complained bitterly about\nthe conduct of the officer in charge of our ration-party. Philpott sent\nfor Harry and accused him hotly of dumping the rations carelessly\nanywhere, of not finishing his job.\n\nHarry gave his account of the affair quite simply, without enlarging on\nthe bad time he had had, though that was clear enough to a man with any\nknowledge. _But he could not show a receipt._ Philpott was the kind of\nman who valued receipts more than righteousness. He refused to believe\nHarry's straightforward tale, cursed him for a lazy swine, and sent him\nto apologize to the Colonel of the Blanks. That officer did listen to\nHarry's story, believed it, and apologized to _him_. Harry was a little\nsoothed, but from that day I know there was a great bitterness in his\nheart. For he had done a difficult job very well, and had come back\njustly proud of himself and his men. And to have the work wasted by a\nbungling N.C.O., and his word doubted by a Philpott....\n\nAnd that I may call the beginning of the second stage.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nFor after that Harry began to be in a bad way again. That shelling in\nthe night and the near concussion of the shell that knocked him over had\nbeen one of those capital shocks of which I have spoken. From that time\non, shell-fire in the open became a special terror, a new favourite\nfear; afterwards he told me so. And all that winter we had shell-fire in\nthe open--even the 'lines' were not trenches, only a string of scattered\nshell-holes garrisoned by a few men. Everywhere, night and day, you had\nthat naked feeling.\n\nYet in France, at the worst, given proper rest and variety, with a\nchance to nurse his courage and soothe his nerves, a resolute man could\nstruggle on a long time after he began to crack. But Harry had no rest,\nno chance. The _affaire Philpott_ was having a rich harvest. For about\nthree weeks in the February of that awful winter the battalion was\nemployed solely on working-parties, all sorts of them, digging,\ncarrying, behind the line, in the line, soft jobs, terrible jobs. Now as\nadjutant I used to take particular care that the safe jobs in the rear\nshould be fairly shared among the companies in a rough rotation, and\nthat no officers or men should have too many of the bad ones--the night\ncarrying-parties to the front line. But about now Colonel Philpott began\nto exert himself about these parties; he actually issued orders about\nthe arrangements, and whether by accident or design, his orders had this\nparticular effect, that Harry took about three times as many of the\ndangerous parties as anybody else. We were in a country of rolling down\nwith long trough-like valleys or ravines between. To get to the front\nline you had to cross two of these valleys, and in each of them the\nBoche put a terrific barrage all night, and every night. The second\none--the Valley of Death--was about as near to Inferno as I wish to see,\nfor it was enfiladed from both ends, and you had shell-fire from three\ndirections. Well, for three weeks Harry took a party through this valley\nfour or five nights a week.... Each party meant a double passage through\ntwo corners of hell, with a string of weary men to keep together, and\nencourage and command, with all that maddening accumulation of\ndifficulties I have tried already to describe ... and at the end of that\nwinter, after all he had done, it was too much. I protested to the\nColonel, but it was no good. 'Master Penrose can go on with these\nparties,' he said, 'till he learns how to do them properly.'\n\nAfter ten days of this Harry began to be afraid of himself; or, as he\nput it, 'I don't know if I can stand much more of this.' All his old\ndistrust of himself, which lately I think he had very successfully kept\naway, came creeping back. But he made no complaint; he did not ask me to\nintercede with Philpott. The more he hated and feared these parties, the\nworse he felt, the keener became his determination to stick it out, to\nbeat Philpott at his own game. Or so I imagine. For by the third week\nthere was no doubt; what is called his 'nerve' was clean gone; or, as he\nput it to me in the soldier's tongue, 'I've got complete wind-up.' He\nwould have given anything--except his pride--to have escaped one of\nthose parties; he thought about them all day. I did manage, in sheer\ndefiance of Philpott, to take him off one of them; but it was only sheer\ndogged will-power, and perhaps the knowledge that we were to be relieved\nthe following week, which carried him through to the end of it....\n\nIf we had not gone out I don't know what would have happened. But I can\nguess.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd so Philpott finally broke his nerve. But he was still keen and\nresolute to go on, in spite of the bitterness in his heart.\nPhilpott--and other things--had still to break his spirit. And the\n'other things' were many that winter. It was a long, cold, comfortless\nwinter. Billets became more and more broken and windowless and lousy;\nfirewood vanished, and there was little coal. On the high slopes there\nwas a bitter wind, and men went sick in hundreds--pneumonia, fever,\nfrost-bite. All dug-outs were damp and chilling and greasy with mud, or\nfull of the acrid wood-smoke that tortured the eyes. There were night\nadvances in the snow, where lightly wounded men perished of exposure\nbefore dawn. For a fortnight we lived in tents on a hill-top covered\nwith snow.\n\nAnd one day Harry discovered he was lousy....\n\nThen, socially, though it seems a strange thing to say, these were dull\ndays for Harry. Few people realize how much an infantryman's life is\nlightened if he has companions of his own kind--not necessarily of the\nsame class, though it usually comes to that--but of the same tastes and\neducation and experience--men who make the same kind of jokes. In the\nline it matters little, a man is a man, as the Press will tell you. But\nin the evenings, out at rest, it was good and cheering to sit with the\nOld Crowd and exchange old stories of Gallipoli and Oxford and London;\neven to argue with Eustace about the Public Schools; to be with men who\nliked the same songs, the same tunes on the gramophone, who did not\nalways ask for 'My Dixie Bird' or 'The Green Woman' waltz.... And now\nthere was none of the Old Crowd left, only Harry and myself, Harry with\na company now, and myself very busy at Headquarters. And Harry's company\nwere very dull men, promoted N.C.O.'s mostly, good fellows all--very\ngood in the line--but they were not the Old Crowd. Now, instead of those\ngreat evenings we used to have, with the white wine, and the music, and\nold George dancing, evenings that have come down in the history of the\nbattalion as our battles have done, evenings that kept the spirit strong\nin the blackest times--there were morose men with wooden faces sitting\nsilently over some whisky and Battalion Orders....\n\nAnd Hewett was dead, the laughing, lovable Hewett. That was the black\nheart of it. When a man becomes part of the great machine, he is\ngenerally supposed--I know not why--to surrender with his body his soul\nand his affections and all his human tendernesses. But it is not so.\n\nWe never talked of Hewett very much. Only there was for ever a great\ngap. And sometimes, when we tried to be cheerful in the evenings, as in\nthe old times, and were not, we said to each other--Harry and I--'I wish\nto God that he was here.' Yet for long periods I forgot Hewett. Harry\nnever forgot him.\n\nThen there was something about which I may be wrong, for Harry never\nmentioned it, and I am only guessing from my own opinion. In two years\nof war he had won no kind of medal or distinction--except a 'mention' in\ndespatches, which is about as satisfying as a caraway-seed to a starving\nman. In Gallipoli he had done things which in France in modern times\nwould have earned an easy decoration. But they were scarce in those\ndays; and in France he had done much dogged and difficult work, and a\nfew very courageous, but in a military sense perfectly useless things,\nnothing dramatic, nothing to catch the eye of the Brigade. I don't know\nwhether he minded much, but I felt it myself very keenly; for I knew\nthat he had started with ambitions; and here were fellows with not half\nhis service, or courage, or capacity, just ordinary men with luck,\nablaze with ribbon.... Any one who says he cares nothing about medals is\na hypocrite, though most of us care very little. But if you believe you\nhave done well, and not only is there nothing to show for it, but\nnothing to show that other people believe it ... you can't help caring.\n\nAnd then, on top of it, when you have a genuine sense of bitter\ninjustice, when you know that your own most modest estimate of yourself\nis exalted compared with the estimate of the man who commands you--you\nbegin to have black moods....\n\n\nIII\n\nHarry had black moods. All these torments accumulated and broke his\nspirit. He lost his keenness, his cheerfulness, and his health. Once a\nman starts on that path, his past history finds him out, like an old\nwound. Some men take to drink and are disgraced. In Harry's case it was\nGallipoli. No man who had a bad time in that place ever 'got over' it in\nbody or soul. And when France or some other campaign began to work upon\nthem, it was seen that there was something missing in their resisting\npower; they broke out with old diseases and old fears ... the legacies\nof Gallipoli.\n\nHarry grew pale, and nervous, and hunted to look at; and he had a touch\nof dysentery. But the worst of the poison was in his mind and heart. For\na long time, as I have said, since he felt the beginning of those old\ndoubts, and saw himself starting downhill, he had striven anxiously to\nkeep his name high in men's opinion; for all liked him and believed in\nhim. He had been ready for anything, and done his work with a\nconscientious pride. But now this bitterness was on him, he seemed to\nhave ceased to care what happened or what men thought of him. He had\nunreasonable fits of temper; he became distrustful and cynical. I\nthought then, sometimes, of the day when he had looked at Troy and\nwanted to be like Achilles. It was painful to me to hear him talking as\nEustace used to talk, suspicious, intolerant, incredulous.... I thought\nhow Harry had once hated that kind of talk, and it was most significant\nof the change that had come over the good companion I had known. Yet\nsometimes, when the sun shone, and once when we rode back into Albert\nand dined quietly alone, that mask of bitterness fell away; there were\nflashes of the old cheerful Harry, and I had hopes. I hoped Philpott\nwould be killed....\n\n\nIV\n\nBut he survived, for he was very careful. And though, as I have said, he\nstuck it for a long time, he was by no means the gallant fire-eater you\nwould have imagined from his treatment of defaulters. Once round the\nline just before dawn was enough for him in that sort of country.\n'Things are quiet then, and you can see what's going on.' He liked it\nbest when 'things were quiet.' So did all of us, and I don't blame him\nfor that.\n\nBut that winter there was a thick crop of S.I.W.'s. S.I.W. is the short\ntitle for a man who has been evacuated with self-inflicted wounds--shot\nhimself in the foot, or held a finger over the muzzle of his rifle, or\ndropped a great boulder on his foot--done himself any reckless injury to\nescape from the misery of it all. It was always a marvel to me that any\nman who could find courage to do such things could not find courage to\ngo on; I suppose they felt it would bring them the certainty of a little\nrespite, and beyond that they did not care, for it was the uncertainty\nof their life that had broken them. You could not help being sorry for\nthese men, even though you despised them. It made you sick to think that\nany man who had come voluntarily to fight for his country could be\nbrought so low, that humanity could be so degraded exactly where it was\nbeing so ennobled.\n\nBut Philpott had no such qualms. He was ruthless, and necessarily so;\nbut, beyond that, he was brutal, he bullied. When they came before him,\nhealed of their wounds, haggard, miserable wisps of men, he kept them\nstanding there while he told them at length exactly how low they had\nsunk (they knew that well enough, poor devils), and flung at them a rich\nvocabulary of abuse--words of cowardice and dishonour, which were\nstrictly accurate but highly unnecessary. For these men were going back\nto duty now; they had done their punishment--though the worst of it was\nstill to come; all they needed was a few quiet words of encouragement\nfrom a strong man to a weaker, a little human sympathy, and that appeal\nto a man's honour which so seldom fails if it is rightly made.\n\nWell, this did not surprise me in Philpott; he had no surprises for me\nby now. What did surprise me was Harry's intolerant, even cruel,\ncomments on the cases of the S.I.W.'s. He had always had a real sympathy\nwith the men, he knew the strange workings of their minds, and all the\nwretchedness of their lives; he understood them. And yet here he was, as\nscornful, as Prussian, on the subject of S.I.W.'s as even Philpott. It\nwas long before I understood this--I don't know that I ever did. But I\nthought it was this: that in these wrecks of men he recognized something\nof his own sufferings; and recognizing the disease he was the more\nappalled by the remedy they took. The kind of thing that had led them to\nit was the kind of thing he had been through, was going through. There\nthe connection ceased. There was no such way out for him. But though it\nceased, the connection was so close that it was degrading. And this\nscorn and anger was a kind of instinctive self-defence--put on to assure\nhimself, to assure the world, that there was no connection--none at\nall.... But I don't know.\n\n\nV\n\nAt the end of February I was wounded and went home. Without any conceit,\nwithout exaggerating our friendship, I may say that this was the final\nblow for Harry. I was the last of the Old Crowd; I was the one man who\nknew the truth of things as between him and Philpott.... And I went.\n\nI was hit by a big shell at Whizz-Bang Corner, and Harry saw me on the\nstretcher as we came past D Company on the Bapaume Road. He walked with\nme as far as the cookers, and was full of concern for my wound, which\nwas pretty painful just then. But he bucked me up and talked gaily of\nthe good things I was going to. And he said nothing of himself. But when\nhe left me there was a look about him--what is the word?--_wistful_--it\nis the only one, like a dog left behind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was still in hospital I had two letters from the battalion. The\nfirst was from Harry, a long wail about Philpott and the dullness of\neverybody now that the Old Crowd were extinct, though he seemed to have\nmade good friends of some of the dull ones. At the end of that endless\nwinter, when it seemed as if the spring would never come, they had\npulled out of the line and 'trekked' up north, so that there had been\nlittle fighting. They were now in shell-holes across the high ridge in\nfront of Arras, preparing for an advance.\n\nThe other letter was from old Knight, the Quartermaster, dated two\nmonths after I left.\n\nI will give you an extract:\n\n     _'Probably by now you will have seen or heard from young\n     Penrose. He was hit on the 16th, a nasty wound in the chest\n     from a splinter.... It was rather funny--not funny, but you\n     know what I mean--how he got it. I was there myself though I\n     didn't see it. I had been up to H.Q. to see about the rations,\n     and there were a lot of us, Johnson (he is now Adj. in your\n     place) and Fellowes, and so on, standing outside H.Q. (which is\n     on a hill--what you people call a forward slope, I believe),\n     and watching our guns bombarding the village. It was a\n     remarkable sight, etc. etc._ (a long digression).... _Then the\n     Boche started shelling our hill; he dropped them in pairs,\n     first of all at the other end of the hill, about 500 yards off,\n     and then nearer and nearer, about 20 yards at a time ... the\n     line they were on was pretty near to us, so we thought the\n     dug-out would be a good place to go to.... Penrose was just\n     starting to go back to his company when this began, and as we\n     went down somebody told him he'd better wait a bit. But he said\n     \"No, he wanted to get back.\" I was the last down, and as I\n     disappeared (pretty hurriedly) I told him not to be a fool. But\n     all he said was, \"This is nothing, old bird--you wait till you\n     live up here; I'm going on.\" The next thing we heard was the\n     hell of an explosion on top. We ran up afterwards, and there he\n     was, about thirty yards off.... The funny thing is that I\n     understood he rather had the wind-up just now, and was anything\n     but reckless ... in fact, some one said he had the Dug-out\n     Disease.... Otherwise, you'd have said he wanted to be killed.\n     I don't know why he wasn't, asking for it like that.... Well,\n     thank God I'm a Q.M., etc. etc.'_\n\nI read it all very carefully, and wondered. '_You'd have said he wanted\nto be killed._' I wondered about that very much.\n\nAnd there was a postscript which interested me:\n\n     '_By the way, I hear Burnett's got the M.C.--for Salvage, I\n     believe!_'\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nI was six months in that hospital, and I did not see Harry for seven.\nFor I was at Blackpool, and he at Lady Radmore's in Kensington. His was\na quicker business than mine; and when I had finished with the hospitals\nand the homes and came to London for a three weeks' laze, he was back at\nthe Depot. Then he got seven days' leave for some mysterious reason (I\nthink there was a draft leaving shortly, and everybody had some leave),\nand I dined twice with him at home. They had a little house in Chelsea,\nvery tastefully furnished by Mrs. Penrose, whom I now saw for the first\ntime. But I saw more of her that evening than I did of Harry, who was\nhopelessly entangled with two or three 'in-laws.' She was a dark, gentle\nlittle person, with brown, and rather sorrowful, eyes. When I first saw\nher I thought, 'She was never meant to be a soldier's wife,' but after\nwe had talked a little, I added, 'But she is a good one.' She was\nclearly very much in love with Harry, and delighted to meet some one who\nhad been with him in France, and was fond of him--for, like all wives,\nshe soon discovered that. But all the time I felt that there were\nquestions she wanted to ask me, and could not. I will not pretend to\ntell you how she was dressed, because I don't know; I seldom notice, and\nthen I never remember. But she appealed to me very much, and I made up\nmy mind to look after _her_ interests if I ever had the chance, if there\nwas ever a question between Harry and a single man. I had no chance of a\ntalk with Harry, and noticed only that he seemed pretty fit again but\nsleepless-looking.\n\nThe second night I went there was the last night of Harry's leave. If I\nhad known that when I was asked I think I should not have gone; for\nwhile it showed I was a privileged person, it is a painful privilege to\nbreak in on the 'last evening' of husband and wife; I know those last\nevenings. And though Harry was only going back to the Depot in the\nmorning, it was known there had been heavy losses in the regiment; there\nwas talk of a draft ... it might well be the last evening of all.\n\nI got there early, at Harry's request, about half-past five, on a\nmiserable gusty evening in early November. Harry was sitting in a kind\nof study, library, or den, writing; he looked less well, and very\nsleepless about the eyes.\n\nIt was the anniversary of one of the great battles of the regiment; and\nwe talked a little of that day, as soldiers will, with a sort of gloomy\nsatisfaction. Then Harry said, slowly:\n\n'I've been offered a job at the War Office--by Major\nMackenzie--Intelligence.'\n\n'Oh,' I said, 'that's very good.' (But I was thinking more of Mrs. Harry\nthan Harry.)\n\nHarry went on, as if he had not heard. 'I was writing to him when you\ncame in. And I don't know what to say.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'Well,' he said, '_you_ know as well as any one what sort of time I've\nhad, and how I've been treated--by Philpott and others. And I've had\nabout enough of it. I remember telling you once on the Peninsula that I\nthought myself fairly brave when I first went out ... and, my God, so I\nwas compared with what I am now.... I suppose every one has his\nbreaking-point, and I've certainly had mine.... I simply feel I can't\nface it again.'\n\n'Very well,' I said, 'take the job and have done with it. You've done as\nmuch as you can, and you can't do more. What's the trouble?'\n\nBut he went on, seemingly to convince himself rather than me. 'I've\nnever got over those awful working-parties in that ---- valley; I had two\nor three 5-9's burst right on top of me, you know ... the Lord knows how\nI escaped ... and now I simply dream of them. I dream of them every\nnight ... usually it's an enormous endless plain, full of shell-holes,\nof course, and raining like hell, and I walk for miles (usually with\nyou) looking over my shoulder, waiting for the shells to come ... and\nthen I hear that savage kind of high-velocity shriek, and I run like\nhell ... only I can't run, of course, that's the worst part ... and I\nget into a ditch and lie there ... and then one comes that I know by the\nsound is going to burst on top of me ... and I wake up simply sweating\nwith funk. I've never told anybody but you about this, not even Peggy,\nbut she says I wake her up sometimes, making an awful noise.'\n\nHe was silent for a little, and I had nothing to say.\n\n'And then it's all so different now, so damnably ... dull.... I wouldn't\nmind if we could all go out together again ... just the Old Crowd ... so\nthat we could have good evenings, and not care what happened. But now\nthere's nobody left (I don't expect they'll let _you_ go out again),\nonly poor old Egerton--he's back again ... and I can't stand all those\nboot-faced N.C.O. officers and people like Philpott, and all the Old\nDuds.... You can't get away from it--the boot-faces _aren't_ officers,\nand nothing will make them so ... even the men can't stand them. And\nthey get on my nerves....\n\n'It all gets on my nerves, the mud, and the cold, and the futile\nBrigadiers, and all the damned eyewash we have nowadays ... never having\na decent wash, and being cramped up in a dug-out the size of a\nchest-of-drawers with four boot-faces ... where you can't move without\nupsetting the candle and the food, or banging your head ... and getting\nlousy. And all those endless ridiculous details you have to look after\nday after day ... working-parties ... haversack rations ... has every\nman got his box-respirator?... why haven't you cleaned your rifle?...\nas if I cared a damn!... No, I won't say that ... but there you are, you\nsee, it's on my nerves.... But sometimes' (and though I sympathized I\nwas glad there was a 'but') 'when I think of some of the bogus people\nwho've been out, perhaps once, and come home after three months with a\nnice blighty in the shoulder, and got a job, and stayed in it ever\nsince ... I feel I can't do that either, and run the risk of being taken\nfor one of them....'\n\n'I don't think there's any danger of that,' I remarked.\n\n'I don't know--one \"officeer\" is the same as another to most people....\nAnd then, you know, although you hate it, it does get hold of you\nsomehow--out there ... and after a bit, when you've got used to being at\nhome you get restless.... I know I did last time, and sometimes I do\nnow.... I don't say I hunger for the battle, I never want to be in a\n\"stunt\" again ... but you feel kind of \"out of it\" when you read the\npapers, or meet somebody on leave ... you think of the amusing evenings\nwe used to have.... And I rather enjoyed \"trekking\" about in the back\nareas ... especially when I had a horse ... wandering along on a good\nfrosty day, and never sure what village you were going to sleep in ...\nmarching through Doullens with the band ... estaminets, and talking\nFrench, and all the rest of it....\n\n'And then I think of a 5-9--and I know I'm done for.... I've got too\nmuch imagination, that's the trouble (I hope you're not fed up with all\nthis, but I want your advice).... It's funny, one never used to think\nabout getting killed, even in the war ... it seemed impossible somehow\nthat _you yourself_ could be killed (did you ever have that\nfeeling?) ... though one was ready enough in those days ... but now--even\nin the train the other day, going down to Bristol by the express, I found\nI was imagining what would happen if there was a smash ... things one\nreads of, you know ... carriages catching fire, and so on ... just\n\"wind-up.\" And the question is--is it any _good_ going out, if you've got\ninto that state?... And if one says \"No,\" is one just making it an\nexcuse?... It's no good telling a military doctor all this ... they'd\njust say, \"Haw, skrim-shanker! what you want is some fresh air and\nexercise, my son!...\" And for all I know they may be right.... As a\nmatter of fact, I don't think I'm physically fit, really ... my own\ndoctor says not ... but you're never examined properly before you go out,\nas you know.... You all troop in by the dozen at the last moment ... and\nthe fellow says, \"Feeling quite fit?...\" And if you've just had a good\nbreakfast and feel buckish, you say, \"Yes, thank you,\" and there you\nare.... Unless you _ask_ them to examine you you might have galloping\nconsumption for all they know, and I'm damned if I'd ask them.... After\nall, I suppose the system's right.... If a man can stick it for a month\nor two in the line, he's worth sending there if he's an officer ... and\nit doesn't matter to the country if he dies of consumption afterwards....\nBut my trouble is--_can_ I stick it for a month or two ... or shall I\ngo and do some awful thing, and let a lot of fellows down?... Putting\naside my own inclinations, which are probably pretty selfish, what is it\nmy duty to do?... After friend Philpott I don't know that I'm so keen on\nduty as I was ... but I do want to stick this ---- war out on the right\nline, if I can.... What do _you_ think?'\n\n'Before I answer that,' I said, 'there's one consideration you seem to\nhave overlooked--and that is Mrs. Penrose.... After all, you're a\nmarried man, and that makes a difference, doesn't it?'\n\n'Well, does it? I don't really see why it _should_ make any difference\nabout going out, or not going out ... otherwise every shirker could run\noff and marry a wife, and live happily ever after.... But it certainly\nmakes it a damned sight harder to decide ... and it makes the hell of a\ndifference when you're out there.... You can make up your mind not to\nthink of it when you're at home ... like this ... but out there, when\nyou're cold and fed up, and just starting up the line with a\nworking-party ... you can't help thinking of it, and it makes things\nabout ten times more difficult ... and as you know, it's jolly hard not\nto let it make a difference to what you do.... But, damn it, why did you\nremind me of that? I didn't want to think about it.'\n\nAnd then Mrs. Penrose came in, and we went down to dinner.\n\n\nII\n\nI did not enjoy that dinner. To begin with, I felt like a vulgar\nintruder on something that was almost sacred, and certainly very\nprecious. For all the signs of the 'last evening' were there. The dishes\nwe had were Harry's favourites, procured at I know what trouble and\nexpense by Mrs. Harry; and she watched tremulously to see that he liked\nthem. She had gone out and bought him a bottle of well-loved Moselle,\nfor a special surprise, and some port; which was a huge extravagance.\nBut that was nothing, if these things could only give a special\nsomething to this meal which would make him remember it; for the flowers\nhe never saw, and the new dress went unnoticed for a long time. But I\nfelt that it would all have gone much better, perhaps, if I had not been\nthere, and I hoped she did not hate me.\n\nAnd Harry was not at his best. The question he asked me I had had no\ntime to answer, and he had not answered it himself. Through most of that\ndinner, which by all the rules should have been, superficially at least,\ncheerful and careless, as if there were no such thing as separation\nahead, Harry was thoughtful and preoccupied. And I knew that he was\nstill arguing with himself, 'What shall I say to Mackenzie? Yes or\nNo?'--wandering up and down among the old doubts and resolutions and\nfears.... Mrs. Harry saw this as well as I ... and, no doubt, she cursed\nme for being there because in my presence she could not ask him what\nworried him.\n\nBut the Moselle began to do its work: Harry talked a little and noticed\nthe new dress, and we all laughed a lot at the pudding, which came up in\nsuch a curious shape.... We were very glad to laugh at something.\n\nThen Mrs. Harry spoke of some people in the regiment of whom she had\nheard a good deal--George Dawson, and Egerton, and old Colonel Roberts.\nI knew that in a minute we should stumble into talking about the\ntrenches or shells, or some such folly, and have Harry gloomy and\nbrooding again. I could not stand that, and I did not think Mrs. Harry\ncould, so I plunged recklessly into the smoother waters of life in\nFrance. I told them the old story about General Jackson and the\nbillet-guard; and then we came on to the famous night at Forceville, and\nother historic battalion orgies--the dinner at Monchy Breton, when we\nput a row of candles on the floor of the tent for footlights, and George\nand a few subs made a perfect beauty chorus. Those are the things one\nlikes to remember about active service, and I was very glad to remember\nthem then. The special port came in and was a great success; Harry\nwarmed up, and laughed over those old gaieties, and was in great form.\nAt that moment I think his answer to Major Mackenzie would have been\ndefinitely 'No.'\n\nMrs. Harry laughed very much too, and said she envied us the amusing\ntimes we had together 'out there.' 'You men have all the fun.' And that\nmade me feel a heartless ass for having started on that topic. For I\nknew that when Harry was away there was little 'fun' for her; and\nwhether he was lying on his stomach in a shell-hole, or singing songs in\nan estaminet, not thinking much of his wife, perhaps, except when they\ndrank 'Sweethearts and Wives'--it was all one uniform, hideous wait for\nher. So I think it was hollow laughter for Mrs. P....\n\nMoreover, though I did not know how much she knew about Harry's\ndifficulties, the 'job' and so one, I felt sure that with the\nextraordinary instinct of a wife she scented something of the conflict\nthat was going on; and she knew vaguely that this exaggerated laudation\nof the amenities of France meant somehow danger to her.... So that just\nas I was beginning to congratulate myself on the bucking up of Harry, I\ntardily perceived that between us we were wounding the wife. And I more\nthan ever wished myself anywhere than sitting at that pretty table with\nthe shaded lights.\n\nWell, we nearly finished the port--Harry still in excellent form--and\nwent upstairs. Harry went off to look for smokes or something, and I\nknew at once that Mrs. Harry was going to ask me questions about him.\nYou know how a woman stands in front of the fire, and looks down, and\nkind of paws the fender with one foot when she is going to say something\nconfidential. Then she looks up suddenly, and you're done. Mrs. Harry\ndid that, and I was done. At any other time I should have loved to talk\nto her about Harry, but that night I felt it was dangerous ground.\n\n'How do you think Harry is looking?' she said. 'You probably know better\nthan I do, nowadays.'\n\nI said I thought he seemed pretty fit, considering all things.\n\n'Do you think he'll have to go out again?' she asked. 'I don't think he\nought to--but they seem so short of men still. He's not really strong,\nyou know.'\n\nSo she knew nothing about the 'job'; and this put me in a hole. For if I\ntold her about it, and he did not take it, but went out again, the\nknowledge would be a standing torture to her. On the other hand, I\n_wanted_ him to take it, I thought he ought to--and if she knew about it\nshe might be able to make him. Wives can do a great deal in that way.\nBut that would be disloyal to Harry....\n\nWell, I temporized with vague answers while I wrestled with this\nproblem, and she told me more about Harry. 'You know, he has the most\n_terrible_ dreams ... wakes up screaming at night, and quite frightens\nme. And I don't think they ought to be _allowed_ to go out again when\nthey're like that.... I don't _want_ him to go out again.... At least,'\nshe added half-heartedly (as a kind of concession to convention), 'if\nit's his duty, of course....' Then, defiantly, 'No, I _don't_ want him\nto go ... anyhow ... I think he's done his bit ... hasn't he, Mr.\nBenson?'\n\n'He has, indeed,' I said, with sincerity at last.\n\n'Well, you have some influence with him. Can't you----'\n\nBut then Harry came in, and I had lost my chance. I have noticed that\nwhile on the stage, conversations which must necessarily be private are\ninvariably concluded without interruption, in private life, and\nespecially private houses, are always interrupted long before the end.\n\nMrs. Harry went to the piano, and Harry and I sat down to smoke; and\nsince it was the last night Harry was allowed to smoke his pipe. The way\nMrs. Harry said that nearly made me weep.\n\nSo I sat there and watched Harry, and his wife played and played--soft,\nmelancholy, homesick things (Chopin, I think), that leagued with the\nwine and the warm fire and the deep chairs in an exquisite conspiracy of\nrepose. She played for a long time, but I saw that she too was watching.\nAnd the fancy came to me that she was fighting for Harry, fighting,\nperhaps unconsciously, that vague danger she had seen at dinner, when it\nhad beaten her ... fighting it with this music that made war seem so\ndistant and home so lovable....\n\nAnd soon I began to see that she was winning. For when she began playing\nHarry had sat down, a little restless again, and fidgeted, as if the\nmusic reminded him of good things too much ... and his eyes wandered\nround the room and took in all the familiar things, like a man saying\ngood-bye--the old chair with the new chintz, and the yellow curtains,\nand the bookcase his father left him--and the little bookcase where his\nhistory books were (he looked a long time at them) ... and the firelight\nshining on the piano ... and his wife playing and playing.... And when\nhe had looked at her, quickly, he sat up and poked the fire fiercely,\nand sat back, frowning. He was wondering again. This music was being too\nmuch for him. Then she stopped, and looked across at Harry--and smiled.\n\nWhen she played again it was, I think, a nocturne of Chopin's (God knows\nwhich--but it was very peaceful and homesick), and as I watched, I made\nsure that she had won. For there came over Harry a wonderful repose. He\nno longer frowned or fidgeted, or raised his eyebrows in the nervous way\nhe had, but lay back in a kind of abandonment of content.... And I said\nto myself, 'He has decided--he will say \"Yes\" to Mackenzie.'\n\nMrs. Harry, perhaps, also perceived it. For after a little she stopped\nand came over to us. And then I did a fateful thing. There was a copy of\n_The Times_ lying by my chair, and because of the silence that was on\nus, I picked it up and looked aimlessly at it.\n\nThe first thing I saw was the Casualty List, buried in small type among\nsome vast advertisements of patent foods. I glanced down the list in\nthat casual manner which came to us when we knew that all our best\nfriends were already dead or disposed of. Then my eye caught the name of\nthe regiment and the name of a man I knew. CAPTAIN EGERTON, V.R. Killed.\nThere was another near it, and another, and many more; the list was\nthick with them. And the other battalions in the Brigade had many names\nthere--fellows one had relieved in the line, or seen in billets, or\ntalked with in the Cocktail Caf\u00c3\u00a9 at Noeux-les-Mines. There must have\nbeen a massacre in the Brigade ... ten officers killed and ten wounded\nin our lot alone.\n\nI suppose I made that vague murmur of rage and regret which slips out of\nyou when you read these things, for Harry looked up and asked, 'What's\nthat?' I gave him the paper, and he too looked down that list.... Only\ntwo of those names were names of the Old Crowd, and many of them were\nthe dull men; but we knew them very well for all that, and we knew they\nwere good men ... Egerton, Gordon, young Matthews, Spenser, Smith, the\nbombing fellow, Tompkinson--all gone....\n\nSo we were silent for a long minute, remembering those men, and Mrs.\nHarry stared into the fire. I wondered what she was thinking of, and I\nwas sorry for her. For when Harry got up there was a look about him\nwhich I had seen before, though not for many months--not since the first\ndays on the Somme....\n\nWhile I was groping after my coat in the hall, Harry came out of his den\nwith a letter which he asked me to 'drop in the box.' I looked at it\nwithout shame; it was addressed to Major Mackenzie, D.S.O., etc.\n\n'And what have you said?' I asked.\n\n'No,' said Harry, with a kind of challenging look.\n\n'Well, I think you're wrong----' I told him, though I knew then that I\nwas too late. Mrs. Harry was beaten now, finally beaten, poor thing....\n\n'And what are you two talking about?' said Mrs. Harry.\n\n'About a dinner, my dear.'\n\nI went out and posted that accursed letter, thanking God that I was not\na wife.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nHarry went to France again a month later, after the futile kind of\nmedical examination he had foretold. I had a letter from him from the\nBase, and after that there was silence. I even began to hunt about in\nthe casualty lists, but he was never there. And seven weeks later they\nlet me go out again myself, to the astonishment of all but the military\ndoctors.\n\nAt the Base I heard of Harry. Some one had been wanted for some kind of\njob down there, an officer to instruct the Details in the mysteries of\nIron Rations, or something of the sort. Harry, happening to be there at\nthe time, and pleasing the eye of the aldermanic officer in command of\nour Base Depot, had been graciously appointed to the post. But he had\ncaused a considerable flutter in the tents of the mighty by flatly\ndeclining it, and stating insanely that he preferred to go up to the\nline. This being still the one topic of conversation in the camp, I did\nnot linger there longer than was absolutely necessary. Infantry Base\nDepots are bad places, and that one was very bad; you had worse food,\nworse treatment, and worse company than you ever had in the line--much\ndiscomfort, and no dignity. I never understood why officers should be\ntreated with such contempt whenever there were a number of them\ntogether. If you went about by yourself, or with another officer or two,\nyou had a certain amount of politeness and consideration from military\nofficials; but as soon as you got with a 'herd' of officers you were\ndoomed--you were dirt. If the intention at the Base was to make the line\nseem a haven of refuge and civility, it was highly successful as far as\nI was concerned....\n\nI got back to the battalion under the usual conditions ... a long jog in\nthe mess-cart under the interminable dripping poplars, with a vile wind\nlashing the usual rain over the usual flat fields, where the old women\nlaboured and stooped as usual, and took no notice of anything. The heart\nsinks a little as you look at the shivering dreariness of it all. And if\nit is near the line you hope secretly that the battalion is 'out' for at\nleast a few days more, that you may have just two days to get used to\nthis beastliness again, and not be met by some cheery acclimatized ass\nwith a 'Glad to see you, old son--just in time--going up to-night, doing\na \"stunt\" on Tuesday!' Yet, as you come to the village, there is a\nstrange sense of home-coming that comes with the recognition of familiar\nthings--limbers clattering and splashing along, and the regimental\npostman trudging back with the mail, and C Company cooker steaming\npleasantly under an outhouse, and odd men with waterproof sheets draped\nover the shoulders, wet and glistening.... To-day I was lucky, for the\nbattalion was a long way back, resting, so that this home-coming sense\nwas strong upon me. And I wanted to see Harry.\n\nWhen I came near to the usual main street I saw the battalion marching\nin by a side road, coming back from a route march. I sent my gear ahead,\nand got down to see them pass. It was strangely pleasant. The drums of\nthe little band were covered because of the wet, and only the bugles\nbrayed harshly, but very cheerfully. Old Philpott was ahead of them,\nriding fatly on his mild black mare, and returned my salute quite\npleasantly. You could see a lot of young recruits among the men, and\nthere were many officers I had never seen, but the welcoming grins of\nthe old men we had had from the beginning, mostly N.C.O.'s now, made up\nfor that. Young Smith I saw, in command of C Company now, and Tarrant,\nour late Transport Officer, was squelching at the head of a platoon,\nobviously not liking it much. Then came D Company, and I looked eagerly\nfor Harry. Stephenson I knew, in command (how young the company\ncommanders were!), but there were only two other officers, and they both\nstrange. The last of them tramped past, and I was left silent in the\nrain, foolishly disturbed.... Where was Harry? Ass--no doubt he is\norderly officer, or away on a course. But I _was_ disturbed; and the\nthought came to me that if anything had happened to him I, too, should\nbe lonely here, with none of the Old Crowd left.\n\nI walked on then, and came to the little flag of D Company headquarters\nflapping damply outside an estaminet. In the mess they greeted me very\nkindly and gave me tea--but there was still no Harry. But they all\ntalked very fast, and the tea was good.\n\n'And where's Penrose?' I asked at last. 'I haven't seen him yet?'\n\nI had spoken to Stephenson. He did not answer immediately; but he picked\nup his cup and drank, assiduously; then he kind of mumbled, very low and\napologetic:\n\n'He's in his billet--under close arrest.'\n\n'Under arrest! My God, what for?'\n\nStephenson began to drink again; he was a good fellow, who knew that\nHarry and I were friends; also he had known Harry in the Souchez days,\nand he did not like having to tell me this.\n\nBut one of his young subalterns, a young pup just out, was less\nsensitive, and told me, brutally:\n\n'Running away--cowardice in the face of--_et cetera_--have some more\ntea?'\n\n\nII\n\nBit by bit I heard the whole miserable story--or rather that naked\nkernel of it which passed publicly for the whole story. I had to make my\nown footnotes, my own queries.\n\nThe first night Harry was with the battalion Philpott had sent him up\nwith a carrying-party to the Front Line, or thereabouts, fifty men and\nsome engineering stuff of sorts, wiring trestles, barbed wire, or\nsomething. It was shell-hole country, no communication trenches or\nanything, and since there had been an attack recently, the Boche\nartillery was very active on the roads and back areas. Also there was\nthe usual rotten valley to cross, with the hell of a barrage in it. So\nmuch these young braves conceded. Harry had started off with his party,\nhad called at the Brigade Dump, and picked up the stuff. Later on some\none rang up Brigade from the line and said no party had arrived. Brigade\nrang up Philpott, and he sent up the Assistant Adjutant to investigate.\nSomewhere in the Arras Road he had come upon Harry, with most of the\nparty, _running down the road--towards the Dump--away from the line_.\nThe stores were urgently needed at the front; they never got there. That\nwas all. The court-martial was to-morrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, it was a black story, but I made one or two footnotes at once.\n\n_The very first night he was back._ The awful luck--the cruelty of it!\nJust back, in the condition of nerves I knew him to be in, with that\nfirst miserable feeling upon him, wondering probably why the hell he had\ndriven himself out there, and praying to be let down easy for one night\nat least--and then to be sent straight up on a job like that, the job\nthat had broken him before.\n\nAnd by Philpott! I seemed to see Philpott arranging that, with a kind of\nsavage glee: 'Oh, here's Master Penrose again--well, he'd better take\nthat party to-night--instead of Mr. Gibson....'\n\nAnd who was the Assistant Adjutant? God knows, if every working-party\nthat went wrong meant a court-martial, there would be no officers left\nin the army; and if some busy-body had been at work....\n\n'Who's the Assistant Adjutant?' I asked.\n\n'Fellow who was attached to Division--used to be in this battalion in\nyour time, I believe--what's-his-name?--Burnett--Burnett--he rang up the\nColonel and told him about it.'\n\n_Burnett!_ I groaned. The gods were against Harry indeed. Burnett had\nbeen away from the battalion for eighteen months, drifting about from\nodd job to odd job--Town Major here, Dump Officer there, never in the\nline.... Why the devil had he come back now to put his foot in it--and,\nperhaps----But I could not believe that.\n\nStephenson's two young officers--Wallace and Brown--made no footnote,\nnaturally. They had come out by the same draft as Harry, one from\nSandhurst, the other from a cadet school; they were fresh, as Harry had\nbeen, and they had no mercy. And while I resented their tone, I tried to\nremember that they knew not Harry, and said nothing.\n\nBut when young Wallace summed up the subject with 'Well, all I can say\nis he's a cold-footed swine, and deserves all he gets,' I exploded. 'You\n---- young pup,' I said, 'just out, and hardly seen a shot fired--you\ndare to say anything about Penrose. I tell you you're not fit to lick\nhis boots. Do you know that he joined up in the ranks in August '14, and\nwent through Gallipoli, and had done two years' active service before\nyou even had a uniform? Do you know he's just refused a job at home in\norder to come out here, and another job at the Base? Does that look like\ncold feet? You wait till you've been out a year, my son, before you talk\nabout cold feet. You----' But I couldn't control myself any further. I\nwent out, cursing.\n\n\nIII\n\nThen I got leave to go and see Harry. He was in his billet, in a small\nbedroom on the ground floor. There was a sentry standing at the window,\nfixed bayonet and all, so that he should neither escape nor make away\nwith himself.\n\nHe was surprised and, I think, really pleased to see me, for before me,\nas he said, or any one who knew his history, he was not ashamed.... It\nwas only when the ignorant, the Wallaces, were near that he was filled\nwith humiliation, because of the things he knew they were thinking.\n'That sentry out there,' he told me, 'was in my platoon at\nGallipoli--one of my old men; just before you came in he tapped on the\nwindow and wished me luck; he said that all the \"old lads\" did the\nsame.... It bucked me up no end.'\n\nNot that he needed much 'bucking up.' For he was strangely quiet and\nresigned--more nearly at peace with everything than I had seen him for\nmany months. 'Only,' he said, 'I wish to God that I was a single man,\nand I wish to God they would get on with it....' He had been under\narrest for six weeks, six solid weeks ... carted about from place to\nplace like some animal waiting for slaughter; while the Summaries of\nEvidence and the Memos and the Secret Envelopes went backwards and\nforwards through 'Units' and through 'Formations,' from mandarin to\nmandarin, from big-wig to big-wig; while generals, and legal advisers,\nand judge advocates, and twopenny-halfpenny clerks wrote their miserable\ninitials on the dirty forms, and wondered what the devil they should\ndecide--and decided--nothing at all. All this terrible time Harry had\nbeen writing to his wife, pretending that all was well with him,\ndescribing route marches and scenery, and all the usual stuff about\nweather and clothes and food.... Now at least somebody _had_ decided,\nand Harry was almost happy. For it was an end of suspense.... 'Once they\nsettled on a court-martial,' he said, 'I knew I was done ... and except\nfor Peggy, I don't care.... I don't know what they've told you, but I'd\nlike you to know what really happened. I found the battalion at Monval\n(the same old part), and got there feeling pretty rotten. Old Philpott,\nof course, sent me off with a working-party like a shot out of a\ngun--before I'd been there an hour. I picked up some wiring stuff at the\nBrigade Dump--it was a long way up the road then, not far from Hellfire\nCorner. Fritz was shelling the road like hell, going up and down,\ndropping them in pairs, fifty yards further every time, _you_ know the\ngame.... I had the wind-up pretty badly, and so had the men, poor\ndevils ... but what was worse, they seemed to know that I had.... We had\na lot of shells very close to us, and some of the men kept rushing\ntowards the bank when they heard one coming.... Well, you don't get on\nvery fast at that rate, and it's damned hard to keep hold of them when\nthey're like that.... And knowing they were like that made me even worse.\nWhen we got to Dead Mule Tree about ten of them were missing ... just\nstayed under the bank in the holes.... I don't say this to excuse\nmyself ... I just tell you what happened. Then we got to that high bit\nwhere the bank stops and the valley goes up on the left.... You know the\nawful _exposed_ feeling one has there, and they had a regular barrage\njust at the corner.... I got the men under the bank, and waited till a\nshell burst ... and then tried to dash them past before the next. But the\nnext one came too fast, and fell plunk into the middle of the\ncolumn--behind me.... Three men were killed outright, and those of us who\nhadn't flung themselves down were knocked over. I fell in a kind of\nnarrow ditch by the road. When I put my head up and looked back I saw\nsome of the men vanishing back under the bank. Then another one\ncame--8-inch I should think they were--and I grovelled in the ditch\nagain.... It was just like my awful dreams.... I must have been there\nabout ten minutes. After every one I started to get up and go back to the\nmen under the bank, meaning to get them together again. Every time the\nnext one came too quick, and I was pinned, simply pinned in that ditch.\nThen Fritz stopped for a minute or two--altering the programme, I\nsuppose--and I got up and ran like hell for the bank. The four or five\nmen lying near me got up and ran too.\n\n'When we got under the bank we lay down and I looked round ... there was\nnot a man to be seen. I shouted, but at first nothing happened. And, I\ntell you, I was glad.... Some of the men who had gone back, not seeing\nme anywhere, had melted away home.... I don't blame _them_.... Then a\nfew drifted along from further down the bank.... By degrees most of the\nparty turned up ... there must have been between thirty and forty of\nthem in the end....\n\n'And then, you see, I knew I should have to go on again ... get past the\ncorner somehow.... And----\n\n'And I couldn't.... I simply couldn't face it.... Peters (the N.C.O.)\nsaid something about \"Going to have another shot, sir?\" He was pretty\nshaken himself--they all were ... but he'd have gone.... We _ought_ to\nhave gone on.... I know that.... But.... Anyhow, I told him I didn't\nthink we should ever get by at present, and said we'd better go back a\nbit and wait under cover ... some yarn or other.... So we started back\ndown the road.... The Boche was still doing the up and down game on the\nroad, only about twice as much.... By this time I can tell you there was\nno shame between those men and me ... we understood each other ... every\ntime we heard that damned shriek we fell into shell-holes and prayed....\nThey were following us down the road, getting nearer and nearer.... You\nknow that dug-out in the bank where Headquarters used to be. Well, just\nwhen it looked as if the next lot must come right on top of us, I saw a\nlight coming from the dug-out, and most of us ran hell for leather for\nthe door. Some one was standing at the entrance as we dashed in ... just\nin time ... we nearly knocked him over.... And guess who it was,' said\nHarry, with a horrible kind of hysterical laugh, 'guess who it was ...\nit was Burnett--Burnett of all people.... He had been sent up to find\nout what had happened. Well, he asked what the hell I was doing, and\nsaid I was to go on at once.... I said I was going to wait a bit, there\nwas too much of a barrage.... Then he said, very offensively, he\ncouldn't help that ... my orders were to go on at once.... That annoyed\nme, and I said I'd see him damned first, and told him if it was so\nurgent he could take the party up himself if he liked.... But he didn't,\nnaturally ... no reason why he should.... Then he rang up Philpott and\ntold him that he had seen the officer in charge and some of the party\n_running down the road--demoralized_. So he had, of course,--he saw me\nrunning for the dug-out ... though the joke of it is--the joke of it\nis ... _he was sheltering there himself_!' And at the enormity of that\njoke Harry went off into that hideous laughter again. 'He said I refused\nto obey orders, and asked for instructions. Philpott said it was too late\nnow, the stuff had been wanted by midnight.... He told Burnett to put me\nunder arrest ... and come back.\n\n'That's what happened,' he went on, 'and I don't care--only I wish it\nhad been anybody but Burnett--though I suppose he was quite right; but\nit makes no odds ... I _had_ got the wind-up, and I _had_ failed with\nthe party, and I don't deny it ... even if I wasn't really running when\nhe saw me.... One thing I _can_ say--if I did have the wind-up I've\nnever had cold feet--till that night.... I'm glad I came out this time\nif I did fail at the pinch.... Burnett wouldn't have.... I knew I was\ndone when I came ... and I know I'm done now.\n\n'But I wish you'd just explain it all to Peggy and the people who don't\nknow.'\n\nAnd that is what I am trying to do.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe Court-Martial was held in an old farm lying just outside the\nvillage. There was a large courtyard where the chickens clucked all day,\nand children and cattle roamed unchecked in the spacious midden. The\ncourt-room was unusually suitable to its purpose, being panelled all\nround in some dark wood with great black beams under a white-washed\nceiling, high and vaulted, and an open hearth where the dry wood\ncrackled heartlessly all day. Usually these trials are conducted in the\nbest bedroom of some estaminet, and the Court sits defensively with a\nvast white bed at their backs. But this room was strangely dignified and\nlegal: only at first Madame persisted in marching through it with\nsaucepans to the kitchen--all these curious English functions were the\nsame to her, a Christmas dinner, or a mess-meeting, or the trial of a\nsoldier for his life.\n\nThe Court impressed me rather favourably--a Major-General, and four\nothers. The Major-General, who was President of the Court, was a square,\nfatherly-looking person, with a good moustache, and rather hard blue\neyes. He had many rows of ribbons, so many that as I looked at them from\na dark corner at the back, they seemed like some regiment of coloured\nbeetles, paraded in close column of companies. All these men were very\nexcellently groomed: 'groomed' is the right word, for indeed they\nsuggested a number of well-fed horses; all their skins were bright, and\nshiny, and well kept, and the leather of their Sam Brownes, and their\nfield boots, and jingling spurs, and all their harness were beautiful\nand glistening in the firelight. I once went over the royal stables at\nMadrid. And when all these glossy creatures jingled heavily up to their\ntable I was reminded of that. They sat down and pawed the floor\nrestively with their well-polished hoofs, cursing in their hearts\nbecause they had been brought so far 'to do some damned court-martial.'\nBut all their faces said, 'Thank God, at least I have had my oats\nto-day.'\n\nAnd there was an atmosphere of greyness about them. The hair of some of\nthem was splashed with grey; the faces of most of them were weathered\nand grey; and one felt that the opinions of all of them were grey, but\nnot weathered.\n\nFor they were just men, according to their views. They would do the\nthing conscientiously, and I could not have hoped for a better Court.\nBut as judges they held the fatal military heresy, that the forms and\nprocedure of Military Law are the best conceivable machinery for the\ndiscovery of truth. It was not their fault; they had lived with it from\ntheir youth. And since it is really a form of conceit, the heresy had\nthis extension, that they themselves, and men like them, blunt, honest,\nstraightforward men, were the best conceivable ministers for the\ndiscovery of truth--and they needed no assistance. Any of them would\nhave told you, 'Damn it, sir, there's nothing fairer to the prisoner\nthan a Field General Court-Martial'; and if you read the books or\nwitness the trial of a soldier for some simple 'crime,' you will agree.\nBut given a complex case, where testimony is at all doubtful, where\nthere are cross-currents and hidden animosities, the 'blunt, honest' men\nare lost.\n\nTo begin with, being in their own view all-seeing and all-just, they\nconsider the Prisoner's Friend to be superfluous: and if he attempts any\ngenuine advocacy they cannot stomach the sight of him. 'Prisoner's\nFriend be damned!' they will tell you, 'the Prosecutor does all that!\nand anything he doesn't find out the Court will.' Now the Prosecutor is\nindeed charged with the duty of 'bringing out anything in the favour of\nthe Accused': that is to say, if Private Smith after looting his\nneighbour becomes afterwards remorseful and returns his loot to its\nowner, the Prosecutor will ask questions to establish the fact. In a\ncase like Harry's it means practically nothing. The Prosecutor will not\ncross-examine a shifty or suspicious witness--dive into his motives--get\nat the secret history of the business, first, because it is not his job,\nand secondly, because being as a rule only the adjutant of his\nbattalion, he does not know how.\n\nThe Court will not do this, because they do not know anything about the\nsecret history, and they are incapable of imagining any; because they\nbelieve implicitly that any witness, officer or man (except perhaps the\naccused), is a blunt, honest, straightforward man like themselves, and\nincapable of deception or concealment.\n\nThis is the job of the Prisoner's Friend. Now 'The Book' lays down very\nfairly that if he be an officer, or otherwise qualified, Prisoner's\nFriend shall have all the rights of defending counsel in a civil court.\nIn practice, the 'blunt men' often make nothing of this safeguard. Many\ncourts I have been before had never heard of the provision; many, having\nheard of it, refused flatly to recognize it, or insisted that all\nquestions should be put _through them_. When they do recognize the\nright, they are immediately prejudiced against the prisoner if that\nright is exercised. Any attempt to discredit or genuinely cross-examine\na witness is regarded as a rather sinister piece of 'cleverness'; and if\nthe Prisoner's Friend ventures to sum up the evidence in the accused's\nfavour at the end--it is too often 'that damned lawyer-stuff.' Usually\nit is safer for a prisoner to abandon his rights altogether in that\nrespect.\n\nBut that should not be in a case like Harry's. The question of counsel\nwas vital in his case. I make no definite charges against Philpott and\nBurnett. All I say is that it was _unfortunate_ that the two men most\ninstrumental in bringing Harry to trial should have been the only two\nmen with whom he had ever had any bitterness during his whole military\ncareer. It was specially unfortunate that Burnett should be the first\nand principal accuser, when you remembered that almost the last time\nHarry had seen Burnett he had shown courage where Burnett had shown\ncowardice, and thus humiliated him. This case could have been passed\nover; hundreds such have been passed over, and on their merits, from any\nhuman standpoint, rightly. Why was this one dragged up and sent stinking\nto the mandarins? Well, one possible answer was--'Look at the history of\nthese three men.' And in the light of that history I say that Philpott\nand Burnett should have been ruthlessly cross-examined by a really able\nman, till the very heart of them both lay bare. Whether the issue would\nhave been different I don't know, but at least there would have been\nsome justice on both sides. And it may even be that a trained lawyer\ncould not only have got at the heart of the matter, but also prevailed\nupon the Court not to be prejudiced against him by his getting at it.\nFor that brings you back to the real trouble. I could have done it\nmyself and gladly; if any one knew anything about these men, I did. But\nif I, acting for Harry, had really cross-examined Burnett, asked him\nsuddenly what _he_ was doing in that dug-out, and when he hesitated,\nsuggested that he too was sheltering, and quite rightly, because the\nfire was so heavy; or if I brought out the history of that night at\nGallipoli, and suggested that the animosity between the two men might\nboth explain Harry's conduct in the dug-out, and account for Burnett\nhaving made the charge in the first place, thus throwing some doubt on\nthe value of his evidence--all that would have been 'cleverness.' And if\nI had suggested that Philpott himself, my C.O., might have some slight\nspite against the accused, or asked him why he had applied for a\nCourt-Martial on this case after hushing up so many worse ones, I think\nthe Court would have become apoplectic with horror at the sacrilege.\n\nThen again it had been fixed that Travers should be Prisoner's Friend;\nhe knew more about the Papers and the Summary of Evidence, and so on,\nthan any one (though as the papers had only been sent down the morning\nbefore, he did not know a great deal). So we left it at that. Travers\nwas a young law student in private life, but constitutionally timid of\nauthority, and he made no great show, in spite of the efforts of the\nDeputy Judge Advocate, a person supposed to assist everybody. But, as I\nhave said, perhaps it was as well.\n\nFor what they thought of as the 'hard facts of the case' were all that\nmattered to the Court, and as related by Philpott and Burnett and\nPeters, they were pretty damning. That bit about the 'running' was\nfatal. It made a great impression. Both the Prosecutor and two of the\nCourt asked Burnett, 'Are you sure he was _running_?' If he had only\nbeen _walking_ away from the enemy it would have made so much\ndifference!\n\nTravers did ask Burnett why was he in the dug-out entrance; and it\nshowed you what a mockery any kind of cross-examination would have been.\nIn the absence of short-hand writers every question and almost every\nanswer was written down, word for word, by the Deputy Judge Advocate.\nAfter a question was put there was a lengthy pause while the officer\nwrote; then there was some uncertainty and some questions about the\nexact form of the question. Had Travers said, 'Why were you in the\ndug-out?' or 'Why did you go to the dug-out?' Finally, all being\nsatisfactorily settled and written down, the witness was allowed to\nanswer. But by then the shiftiest witness had had time to invent a dozen\nsuitable answers. No liar could possibly be caught out--no deceiver ever\nbe detected--under this system. That was 'being fair to the witness.'\n\nBurnett answered, of course, that he had gone there to inquire if the\nworking-party had been seen.\n\nTo do Burnett justice, he did not seem at all happy at having to tell\nhis tale again. If his original report had really been made under a\nsudden impulse of spite and revenge (and, however that may be, he could\ncertainly have made a very different report), I think perhaps he had not\nrealized how far the matter would go--had not imagined that it would\ncome to a Court-Martial, and now regretted it. But it was too late. He\ncould not eat his words. And that was the devil of it. Burnett might\nhave made a different report; Philpott could have 'arranged things' with\nthe Brigade--could have had Harry sent to the Base on the ground of his\nrecord and medical condition, and not have applied for a Court-Martial.\nBut once those 'hard facts' came before the Court, to be examined under\nthat procedure, simply as 'hard facts'--an officer ordered up with a\nparty and important stores; some of the party scattered; officer seen\nrunning, _running_, mind you--in the wrong direction; officer 'shaken'\non the evidence of his men, and refusing to obey an order--it was too\nlate to wonder whether the case should ever have come there. That was\nPhilpott's business. _He_ did not seem disturbed. He even\nmentioned--casually--that 'there had been a similar incident with this\nofficer once before, when his conduct with a working-party by no means\nsatisfied me.' Quite apart from the monstrous misrepresentation of the\nthing, the statement was wholly inadmissible at that stage, and the\nPresident stopped him. But that also was too late. It had sunk in....\n\nAnd so the evidence went slowly on, unshaken--not that it was all\nunshakable; no one tried to shake it.\n\nAfter Philpott came Peters, the N.C.O., a good fellow.\n\nHe told the Court what Harry had said about 'going back to wait a bit,'\ninstead of going straight on when the party collected again.\n\nThey asked him, 'Was there any reason why the party should not have gone\non then?'\n\n'Well, sir,' he said, 'the shelling was bad, and we should have had some\ncasualties, but I daresay we should have got through. I've seen as bad\nbefore.'\n\nThen there was one of the men who had been with Harry, a good fellow,\nwho hated being there. He told the story of the movements of the party\nwith the usual broken irrelevances, but by his too obvious wish to help\nHarry did him no good. When asked 'in what condition' the officer was,\nhe said, 'Well, sir, he seemed to have lost his nerve, like ... we all\nof us had as far as that goes, the shelling was that 'eavy.' But that\nwas no defence for Harry.\n\nHarry could either 'make a statement' not on oath, or give evidence on\noath and be cross-examined. He chose the latter--related simply the\nmovements of the party and himself, and did not deny any of the facts of\nwhich evidence had already been given.\n\n'When you had collected the party under the bank by this corner you\nspeak of,' said the President, 'why did you not then proceed with the\nparty?'\n\n'I thought the shelling was too heavy, sir, just then; I thought it\nwould be better to go back and wait a bit where there was more cover\ntill the shelling got less....'\n\n'But Sergeant Peters says the party would probably have got through?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'In view of the orders you had received, wouldn't it have been better to\ngo straight on?'\n\n'I don't know, sir--perhaps it would.'\n\n'Then why didn't you do that?'\n\n'At the time, sir, I thought it best to go back and wait.'\n\n'And that was what you were doing when you were seen--er, running to the\ndug-out?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nWell, the Court did not believe it, and I cannot blame them. For I knew\nthat Harry was not being perfectly ingenuous. I knew that he _could_ not\nhave gone on....\n\nYet it was a reasonable story. And if the Court had been able to imagine\nthemselves in Harry's condition of mind and body, crouching in the wet\ndark under that bank, faint with weariness and fear, shaken with those\nblinding, tearing concussions, not knowing what they should do, or what\nthey _could_ do, perhaps they would have said in their hearts, 'I will\nbelieve that story.' But they could not imagine it. For they were\nnaturally stout-hearted men, and they had not seen too much war. They\nwere not young enough.\n\nAnd, indeed, it was not their business to imagine that....\n\nAnother of the Court asked: 'Is it true to say, as Private Mallins said,\nthat you had--ah--lost your nerve?'\n\n'Well, sir, I had the wind-up pretty badly; one usually does at that\ncorner--and I've had too much of it.'\n\n'I see.'\n\nI wondered if he did see--if he had ever had 'too much of it.'\n\nHarry said nothing about Burnett; nothing about Philpott; probably it\nwould have done no good. And as he told me afterwards, 'The real charge\nwas that I'd lost my nerve--and so I had. And I don't want to wangle out\nof it like that.'\n\nThat was the end of it. They were kind enough, those grey men; they did\nnot like the job, and they wanted only to do their duty. But they\nconceived that their duty was 'laid down in The Book,' to look at the\n'hard facts,' and no further. And the 'hard facts' were very hard....\n\nThe Court was closed while they considered their verdict; it was closed\nfor forty minutes, and when it reopened they asked for evidence of\ncharacter. And that meant that the verdict was 'Guilty.' On the only\nfacts they had succeeded in discovering it could hardly have been\nanything else.\n\nThe Adjutant put in formal evidence of Harry's service, age, record, and\nso on; and I was allowed to give evidence of character.\n\nI told them simply the sort of fighting record he had, about Gallipoli,\nand the scouting, and the job he had refused in England.\n\nI am glad to believe that I did him a little good; for that evening it\ngot about somehow that he was recommended to mercy.\n\nAnd perhaps they remembered that he was twenty-three.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThat evening I sat in C Company mess for an hour and talked with them\nabout the trial. They were very sad and upset at this thing happening in\nthe regiment, but they were reasonable and generous, not like those D\nCompany pups, Wallace and the other. For they were older men, and had\nnearly all been out a long time. Only one of them annoyed me, a fellow\nin the thirties, making a good income in the City, who had only joined\nup just before he had to under the Derby scheme, and had been out a\nmonth. This fellow was very strong on 'the honour of the regiment'; and\nseemed to think it desirable for that 'honour' that Harry should be\nshot. Though how the honour of the regiment would be thereby advanced,\nor what right he had to speak for it, I could not discover.\n\nBut the others were sensible, balanced men, and as perplexed and\ntroubled as I. I had been thinking over a thing that Harry had said in\nhis talk with me--'If I did have the wind-up I've never had cold feet.'\nIt is a pity one cannot avoid these horrible terms, but one cannot. I\ntake it that 'wind-up'--whatever the origin of that extraordinary\nexpression may be--signifies simply 'fear.' 'Cold feet' also signifies\nfear, but, as I understand it, has an added implication in it of _base\nyielding_ to that fear. I told them about this distinction of Harry's,\nand asked them what they thought.\n\n'That's it,' said Smith, 'that's just the damned shame of the whole\nthing. There are lots of men who are simply terrified the whole time\nthey're out, but just go on sticking it by sheer guts--will-power, or\nwhatever you like--that's having the wind-up, and you can't prevent it.\nIt just depends how you're made. I suppose there really are some people\nwho don't feel fear at all--that fellow Drake, for example--though I'm\nnot sure that there are many. Anyhow, if there are any they don't\ndeserve much credit though they do get the V.C.'s. Then there are the\npeople who feel fear like the rest of us and don't make any effort to\nresist it, don't join up or come out, and when they have to, go back\nafter three months with a blighty one, and get a job, and stay\nthere----'\n\n'And when they are here wangle out of all the dirty jobs,' put in\nFoster.\n\n'Well, they're the people with \"cold feet\" if you like,' Smith went on,\n'and as you say, Penrose has never been like that. Fellows like him keep\non coming out time after time, getting worse wind-up every time, but\nsimply kicking themselves out until they come out once too often, and\nstop one, or break up suddenly like Penrose, and----'\n\n'And the question is--ought any man like that to be shot?' asked Foster.\n\n'Ought any one who _volunteers_ to fight for his ---- country be shot?'\nsaid another.\n\n'Damn it, yes,' said Constable; he was a square, hard-looking old boy, a\npromoted N.C.O., and a very useful officer. 'You must have some sort of\nstandard--or where would the army be?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Foster, 'look at the Australians--they don't have a\ndeath-penalty, and I reckon they're as good as us.'\n\n'Yes, my son, perhaps that's the reason'--this was old Constable\nagain--'the average Australian is naturally a sight stouter-hearted than\nthe average Englishman--they don't need it.'\n\n'Then why the hell do they punish Englishmen worse than Australians, if\nthey can't even be _expected_ to do so well?' retorted Foster; but this\npiece of dialectics was lost on Constable.\n\n'Anyhow, I don't see that it need be such an absolute standard,' Smith\nbegan again, thoughtfully; he was a thoughtful young fellow. 'They don't\nexpect everybody to have equally strong arms or equally good brains; and\nif a chap's legs or arms aren't strong enough for him to go on living in\nthe trenches they take him out of it (if he's lucky). But every man's\nexpected to have equally strong nerves in all circumstances, and to _go\non having them_ till he goes under; and when he goes under they don't\nconsider how far his nerves, or guts, or whatever you call it, were as\ngood as other people's. Even if he had nerves like a chicken to begin\nwith he's expected to behave as a man with nerves like a lion or a Drake\nwould do....'\n\n'A man with nerves like a chicken is a damned fool to go into the\ninfantry at all,' put in Williams--'the honour of the regiment' person.\n\n'Yes, but he may have had a will-power like a lion, and simply made\nhimself do it.'\n\n'You'd be all right, Smith,' somebody said, 'if you didn't use such long\nwords; what the hell do you mean by an absolute standard?'\n\n'Sorry, George, I forgot you were so ignorant. What I mean is this. Take\na case like Penrose's: All they ask is, was he seen running the wrong\nway, or not going the right way? If the answer is Yes--the punishment is\ndeath, _et cetera, et cetera_. To begin with, as I said, they don't\nconsider whether he was _capable_ physically or mentally--I don't know\nwhich it is--of doing the right thing. And then there are lots of other\nthings which _we_ know make one man more \"windy\" than another, or\nwindier to-day than he was yesterday--things like being a married man,\nor having boils, or a bad cold, or being just physically weak, so that\nyou get so exhausted you haven't got any strength left to resist your\nfears (I've had that feeling myself)--none of those things are\nconsidered _at all_ at a court-martial--and I think they ought to be.'\n\n'No,' said Foster, 'they ought to be considered _before_ they decide to\nhave a court-martial at all. A case like Penrose's never ought to have\ngot so far.'\n\n'You're right--I don't know why the devil it did.'\n\n'After all,' said Williams, 'you've got to consider the name of the\nregiment. What would happen----'\n\nBut I could not stand any more of that. 'I think Smith's on the right\nline,' I said, 'though I don't know if it would ever be workable. There\nare, of course, lots of fellows who _feel_ things far more than most of\nus, sensitive, imaginative fellows, like poor Penrose--and it must be\nhell for them. Of course there are some men like that with enormously\nstrong wills who manage to stick it out as well as anybody, and do\nawfully well--I should think young Aston, for instance--and those I call\nthe _really_ brave men. Anyhow, if a man like that really does stick it\nas long as he can, I think something ought to be done for him, though\nI'm damned if I know what. He oughtn't....'\n\n'He oughtn't to be _allowed_ to go on too long--that's what it comes\nto,' said Smith.\n\n'Well, what do you want,' Foster asked, 'a kind of periodical Wind-up\nExamination?'\n\n'That's the kind of thing, I suppose. It _is_ a medical question,\nreally. Only the doctors don't seem to recognize--or else they aren't\nallowed to--any stage between absolute shell-shock, with your legs\nflying in all directions, and just ordinary skrim-shanking.'\n\n'But damn it, man,' Constable exploded, 'look at the skrim-shanking\nyou'll get if you have that sort of thing. You'd have all the mothers'\ndarlings in the kingdom saying they'd had enough when they got to the\nBase.'\n\n'Perhaps--no, I think that's silly. I don't know what it is that gives\nyou bad wind-up after a long time out here, nerves or imagination or\nemotion or what, but it seems to me the doctors ought to be able to test\nwhen a man's really had enough; just as they tell whether a man's knee\nor a man's heart are really bad or not. You'd have to take his record\ninto account, of course....'\n\n'And you'd have to make it a compulsory test,' said Smith, 'because\nnowadays no one's going to go into a Board and say, \"Look here, doctor,\nI've been out so long and I can't stand any more.\" They'd send you out\nin the next draft!'\n\n'Compulsory both ways,' added Foster: 'when they'd decided he'd done\nenough, and wasn't _safe_ any longer, he oughtn't to be _allowed_ to do\nany more--because he's dangerous to himself and everybody else.'[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: It is only fair to say that, long after the supposed date\nof this conversation, a system of sending 'war-weary' soldiers home for\nsix months at a time was instituted, though I doubt if Foster would have\nbeen satisfied with that.]\n\n'As a matter of fact,' said Williams, 'that's what usually does happen,\ndoesn't it? When a chap gets down and out like that after a decent spell\nof it, he usually gets a job at home--instructor at the Depot, or\nsomething.'\n\n'Yes, and then you get a fellow with the devil of a conscience like\nPenrose--and you have a nasty mess like this.'\n\n'And what about the men?' asked Constable. 'Are you going to have the\nsame thing for them?'\n\n'Certainly--only, thank God, there are not so many of them who need it.\nAll that chat you read about the \"wonderful fatalism\" of the British\nsoldier is so much bunkum. It simply means that most of them are not\ncursed with an imagination, and so don't worry about what's coming.'\n\n'That's true; you don't see many fatalists in the middle of a big\nstrafe.'\n\n'Of course there _are_ lots of them who _are_ made like Penrose, and\nwith a record like his, something----'\n\n'And it's damned lucky for the British Army there are not more of them,'\nput in Constable.\n\n'Certainly, but it's damned unlucky for them to be in the British\nArmy--in the infantry, anyhow.'\n\n'And what does that matter?'\n\n'Oh, well, you can take that line if you like--but it's a bit Prussian,\nisn't it?'\n\n'Prussia's winning this dirty war, anyhow, at present.'\n\nSo the talk rambled on, and we got no further, only most of us were in\ntroubled agreement that something--perhaps many things--were wrong about\nthe System, if this young volunteer, after long fighting and suffering,\nwas indeed to be shot like a traitor in the cold dawn.\n\nNine times out of ten, as Williams had said, we knew that it would not\nhave happened, simply because nine men out of ten surrender in time. But\nought the tenth case to be even remotely possible? That was our doubt.\n\nWhat exactly was wrong we could not pretend to say. It was not our\nbusiness. But if this was the best the old men could do, we felt that we\ncould help them a little. I give you this scrap of conversation only to\nshow the kind of feeling there was in the regiment--because that is the\nsurest test of the rightness of these things.\n\nThey were still at it when I left. And as I went out wearily into the\ncold drizzle I heard Foster summing up his views with: 'Well, the whole\nthing's damned awful. They've recommended him to mercy, haven't they?\nand I hope to God he gets it.'\n\n\nII\n\nBut he got no mercy. The sentence was confirmed by the higher\nauthorities.\n\nI cannot pretend to _know_ what happened, but from some experience of\nthe military hierarchy I can imagine. I can see those papers, wrapped up\nin the blue form, with all the right information beautifully inscribed\nin the right spaces, very neat and precise, carefully sealed in the long\nenvelopes, and sent wandering up through the rarefied atmosphere of the\nHigher Formations. Very early they halt, at the Brigadier, or perhaps\nthe Divisional General, some one who thinks of himself as a man of\n'blood and iron.' He looks upon the papers. He reads the evidence--very\ncarefully. At the end he sees 'Recommended to Mercy.'--'All very well,\nbut we must make an example sometimes. Where's that confidential memo.\nwe had the other day? That's it, yes. \"Officer who fails in his duty\nmust be treated with the same severity as would be awarded to private in\nthe same circumstances.\" Quite right too. Shan't approve recommendation\nto mercy. Just write on it, \"See no reason why sentence should not be\ncarried out,\" and I'll sign it.'--Or, more simply perhaps: 'Mercy! mercy\nbe damned! must make an example. I won't have any cold feet in my\nCommand.' And so the blue form goes climbing on, burdened now with that\nfatal endorsement, labouring over ridge after ridge, and on each\nsuccessive height the atmosphere becomes more rarefied (though the\npopulation is more numerous). And at long last it comes to some Olympian\npeak--I know not where--beyond which it may not go, where the air is so\nchill and the population so dense, that it is almost impossible to\nbreathe. Yet here, I make no doubt, they look at the Blue Form very\ncarefully and gravely, as becomes the High Gods. But in the end they\nshake their heads, a little sadly, maybe, and say, 'Ah, General\nB---- does not approve recommendation to mercy. He's the man on the\nspot, he ought to know. _Must_ support _him_. Sentence confirmed.'\n\nThen the Blue Form climbs sadly down to the depths again, to the low\nregions where men feel fear....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thing was done seven mornings later, in a little orchard behind the\nCasquettes' farm.\n\nThe Padre told me he stood up to them very bravely and quietly. Only he\nwhispered to him, 'For God's sake make them be quick.' That is the worst\ntorment of the soldier from beginning to end--the waiting....\n\n\nIII\n\nAfter three months I had some leave and visited Mrs. Harry. I had to.\nBut I shall not distress you with an account of that interview. I will\nnot even pretend that she was 'brave.' How could she be? Only, when I\nhad explained things to her, as Harry had asked, she said: 'Somehow,\nthat does make it easier for me--and I only wish--I wish you could tell\neverybody--what you have told me.'\n\nAnd again I say, that is all I have tried to do. This book is not an\nattack on any person, on the death penalty, or on anything else, though\nif it makes people think about these things, so much the better. I think\nI believe in the death penalty--I don't know. But I did not believe in\nHarry being shot.\n\nThat is the gist of it; that my friend Harry was shot for cowardice--and\nhe was one of the bravest men I ever knew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Secret Battle, by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1050,"split":"train"}
